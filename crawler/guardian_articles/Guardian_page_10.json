                    "body": "1) Post-Bonfire Night fireworks at Bridge An already-spicy encounter between Chelsea and Arsenal has been lent added piquancy by a promo clip recorded for BT Sport by Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing personal, Arsenal,\u201d says the Chelsea striker, who is presumably eager to put one over on a club whose manager relieved him of the captaincy before shipping him off to Barcelona. \u201cI\u2019m back, I\u2019m ready and I\u2019m blue.\u201d The striker\u2019s harmless goading might carry more weight if he was currently firing on all cylinders but his return for Chelsea of three goals in 11 appearances \u2013 two of them off the bench \u2013 is hardly prolific. Aubameyang will be desperate to add to this tally on Sunday and should he do so, any celebration (or the lack thereof) will be scrutinised to within an inch of its life. On the day after Bonfire Night, here\u2019s hoping for more fireworks at Stamford Bridge. Barry Glendenning  Chelsea v Arsenal, Sunday 12pm (all times GMT)  2) Late audition for England hopefuls English players on the periphery of Gareth Southgate\u2019s World Cup plans have been instrumental in the gradual improvement of both Everton and Leicester but, on the penultimate weekend of the Premier League season before its disgraceful interruption, is it too late for an audition at Goodison Park? James Maddison, James Tarkowski and Dominic Calvert-Lewin will be among those desperately hoping not. Tarkowski has impressed in a new-look defensive partnership with Conor Coady that has underpinned Everton\u2019s greater resilience and character this season. While Coady looks a safe bet for Qatar, Tarkowski has not had a look-in at international level since 2018, when he was on stand-by for the last World Cup before undergoing a hernia operation. Maddison\u2019s claims have also been ignored by the England manager despite producing six Premier League goals and two assists in a difficult season for Leicester. It is almost three years since he won his only senior cap as a second-half substitute against Montenegro. He must hope Southgate doesn\u2019t play it entirely safe again. Andy Hunter  Everton v Leicester, Saturday 5.30pm   3) Time Gil got a go Since signing for Spurs the summer before last, Bryan Gil has yet to start a game in either the league or Champions League. There\u2019s a strong chance he hasn\u2019t earned the right to \u2013 Antonio Conte sees him in training every day, and the chances are that he knows slightly more about football than those of us reading and writing these words. But though Conte\u2019s preference is for brutal automatons, Gil\u2019s cameo against Sporting last week showed his willowy unpredictability is something that Spurs lack and, given the unfortunate injuries suffered by Son Heung-min, Dejan Kulusevski and Richarlison, Conte has a decision to make. The conservative option would be to flank Harry Kane with Ivan Perisic and Lucas Moura, but if Perisic plays wing-back with Gil in front of him on the wing, this would give Spurs an extra attacker and also allow the two of them to gang up on and exploit the space behind Trent Alexander-Arnold. Daniel Harris  Tottenham v Liverpool, Sunday 4.30pm  4) Is the end nigh for Hasenh\u00fcttl? Newcastle fans taking on the 644-mile round trip to St Mary\u2019s will almost certainly make the first half of the journey in the highest of spirits and might be forgiven for thinking the long trek home will be similarly cheery. In beating Chelsea at the end of August, Southampton suggested they might have turned a corner, but Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s side have won one and lost five of their subsequent eight matches. Despite the club hierarchy\u2019s apparent reluctance to sack him, the Austrian manager is surely on borrowed time with a long mid-season hiatus looming. Southampton then travel to Liverpool for their final game before the World Cup, a match their away form suggests they will almost certainly lose. Regardless of the outcome of the Carabao Cup tie against Sheffield Wednesday next Wednesday, defeat against Newcastle could hasten the end of Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s curate\u2019s egg of a reign on the south coast. BG  Southampton v Newcastle, Sunday 2pm   5) \u00c1lvarez ready to make impact Earlier in the week, Pep Guardiola said that Erling Haaland might make Saturday\u2019s Fulham game. But given his importance to City, if the call to select him is marginal, it would make more sense for him to miss a home game his team should win anyway, rather than risk aggravating an injury that is almost healed. This would be good news for Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez, who\u2019s made a slow start to his Manchester City career, but showed against Sevilla that he is ready to affect games. First, he slipped a beautiful pass inside a defender for Rico Lewis to score, then finished superbly when put in on goal himself and finally, scavenged possession high up the pitch before playing in Riyad Mahrez to clinch victory. Confidence in footballers \u2013 especially those not only playing but living in a new environment \u2013 can be fragile. So Guardiola should seek to capitalise on \u00c1lvarez\u2019s midweek buzz, by granting him another start this weekend. DH  Manchester City v Fulham, Saturday 3pm  6) Coutinho hoping for a fresh start under Emery \u201cI have not returned (to England) because it is the Premier League, it is because it\u2019s the right club and the right project.\u201d So said Unai Emery after his first two days on the job at Aston Villa, who might have also persuaded the Spaniard with a bumper four-and-a-half year contract and the promise of January funds, with Villarreal\u2019s Pau Torres already linked with a \u00a340m move. After last week\u2019s appointment, Emery only started coaching on Wednesday owing to work permit issues, but was seen orchestrating a high press in training at Bodymoor Heath. What does this mean for Philippe Coutinho? The Brazilian is not a prolific worker off the ball. Might he be offered a deeper role as Villa chase their first home win over Manchester United since 1995? Or will Emery go for a more mobile starting XI and leave Coutinho stranded on the bench, where he has sat for the last four games? Michael Butler  Aston Villa v Manchester United, Sunday 2pm  7) Summerville must match talent with application The Leeds first-team squad, their families and club staff celebrated last Saturday\u2019s reassuring victory at Liverpool with a Halloween Party at the start of the week. Every player attended in fancy dress with Jesse Marsch adjudging Pascal Struijk\u2019s outfit the winner. \u201cPascal was the best, he came as a hippy,\u201d said the Leeds manager, whose job security would be reinforced significantly with a win over Bournemouth. It will be intriguing to see if Crysencio Summerville, his young winger, starts against Gary O\u2019Neil\u2019s side. After scoring the winner at Anfield, Summerville asked for permission to return to his native Netherlands to celebrate his 21st birthday but, tellingly, Marsch refused. If Summerville\u2019s application does not yet quite match his considerable talent, Illan Meslier has long married assiduousness to high-calibre ability. Itcan be easy to forget that the Leeds goalkeeper is still only 22, but Marsch believes Meslier should be included in the France squad for the World Cup and it is difficult to disagree. Louise Taylor  Leeds v Bournemouth, Saturday 3pm   8) Lingard has earned a benching After the positivity of beating Liverpool, Forest were brought back down to earthwith a five-goal thrashing at Arsenal on Sunday. A turning point was Jesse Lingard\u2019s failure to score at 1-0, after which Arsenal dominated. Lingard is, admittedly, not the only Forest player to be underperforming but his efforts this season have been below the standard expected of someone of his pedigree; he has failed to score or assist a goal and has struggled to influence the side since his heralded summer arrival. Brennan Johnson lost his place to Lingard, but has produced some promising cameos in recent weeks and it could be time for the academy graduate to be brought back into the starting lineup ahead of his more illustrious colleague. Lingard has not fitted into the formation at Forest and has received criticism for his lack of commitment when it comes to winning the ball back, so it is time to put him back on the bench. Will Unwin  Nottingham Forest v Brentford, Saturday 3pm  9) Brighton make another eye-catching recruit Wolves are renowned for recruiting Portuguese players and it seems Brighton are beginning to develop a trend of their own. Facundo Buonanotte will arrive in January and is the latest hailing from South America to move to the south coast, joining Pervis Estupi\u00f1\u00e1n, Julio Enciso, Mois\u00e9s Caicedo, and compatriot Alexis Mac Allister among the Brighton ranks. An attacking midfielder, Buonanotte will add craft to a forward line that despatched Chelsea 4-1 in the last fixture. Brighton will be heavy favourites for the trip to Wolves, who have been mostly dreadful of late, and Roberto De Zerbi will be thankful that the rudderless hosts have not yet appointed Julen Lopetegui in the opposite dugout \u2013 talks with the former Spain manager are slowly progressing after initially hitting the buffers. In the interim, Brighton will look to capitalise and propel themselves back into the top six. MB  Wolves v Brighton, Saturday 3pm  10) Time Olise got among goals Patrick Vieira has called on Michael Olise to score more \u2013 the winger is yet to register this season after netting twice in the league last time around. He has two assists to his name but his manager wants to see him on the scoresheet himself. \u201cOlise needs a bit of time,\u201d Vieira said. \u201cSometimes we forget how young he is. Coming up from the Championship, he has to learn and he has to learn a lot to be a Premier League player.\u201d With time, goals will almost certainly come. He is hindered by the fact he has to put a lot of energy into defending and can often be found tracking full-backs all the way to his own box. The longer he goes without scoring, however, the greater the mental impact on a player who has shown moments of caution in the vicinity of the opponent\u2019s box because he does not have the unbounded confidence of a more prolific player, which can result him missing the chance to shoot. Once he does get one, though, more will surely come. WU  West Ham v Crystal Palace, Sunday 2pm  "

It needs an idiot filter, and I\u2019m volunteering, 1 December), two more terms currently in constant use by football managers need to be explained to those new to watching the game. They are \u201cgetting minutes\u201d and \u201cvery fine margins\u201d. Getting minutes is what players who have missed a couple of games are doing when they are brought on 10 minutes before the end of a match that has already been won or lost. Players not fitting into this category are those who have played two games in the last fortnight and thus need to be \u201crested\u201d. Fine margins are what have cost the team the match. If only the goalposts had been five millimetres further apart and that offside decision had not been referred to VAR, the team would have won. Fine margins never win games for teams; they only ever lead to defeat.Mick HawesCaerwys, Flintshire \u2022 There\u2019s far worse football jargon than Harry Kane\u2019s assertion that England need to \u201cplay better with the ball in the attacking third\u201d. The worst jargon must surely be when a pundit describes an outstanding footballer as being \u201cunplayable\u201d. A broken vinyl record is unplayable, as is a footballer with a broken leg. But an outstanding and exceptional footballer at the top of his/her game is very much playable.Alan ThomasRuislip, London \u2022 I agree with Adrian Chiles when he bemoans the use of football jargon by TV and radio pundits.

A hospital statement on Thursday confirmed the death of \u201cour dear King of Football\u201d at 3.27pm local time, \u201cdue to the failure of multiple organs, a result of the progression of cancer of colon associated with his previous clinical condition.\u201d\nA statement from Pel\u00e9\u2019s official Instagram page added: \u201cInspiration and love marked the journey of King Pel\u00e9, who peacefully passed away today. On his journey, Edson enchanted the world with his genius in sport, stopped a war, carried out social works all over the world and spread what he most believed to be the cure for all our problems: love. His message today becomes a legacy for future generations. Love, love and love, forever.\u201d\n\nAfter reports he was receiving end-of-life care, Pel\u00e9 said he felt \u201cstrong, with a lot of hope\u201d in a social media post on 3 December. A further statement from the hospital on 21 December reported that Pel\u00e9 \u201crequires further care related to renal and cardiac dysfunctions\u201d after the \u201cprogression\u201d of his colon cancer. Social media posts from his daughter Kely Nascimento showed that family members had gathered at the hospital to spend Christmas with him.\nBrazil\u2019s joint all-time record scorer won three World Cups as a player, in 1958, 1962 and 1970, over a 14-year international career that included 77 goals in 92 appearances for his country. Nicknamed \u201cthe Black Pearl\u201d and \u201cthe King\u201d, Pel\u00e9 was one of only three players to have scored in four World Cups. In 1,363 games, he scored 1,281 goals, at the time of his retirement in 1977 more than twice as many as his nearest challenger.\nIt was the 1970 World Cup triumph for which he will be best celebrated, the linchpin of a beguiling team that included Carlos Alberto, Jairzinho, G\u00e9rson, Tost\u00e3o and Rivelino that swept through Mexico, his canary yellow No 10 shirt becoming an icon of the sport.\nWorld Soccer described Brazil\u2019s 1970 winners as \u201cmore than a team\u201d, adding: \u201cThe Brazilian side that won the 1970 World Cup in such style have become a myth, a team to be held up as the ultimate exponents of the beautiful game.\u201d Pel\u00e9 was their figurehead and inspiration.\nBrazil\u2019s government declared three days of mourning and the arch at Wembley Stadium was lit in the colours of Brazil, while icons of sport and heads of state bowed to the man who rose up from childhood poverty to become a legend.\n\nBorn Edson Arantes do Nascimento on 23 October 1940, Pel\u00e9 began his professional career at 15 and made his international debut a year later. In 1999, he was voted player of the century in a poll of Ballon d\u2019Or winners and Time magazine named him as one of 100 most influential people of the 20th century.\nIn his prime, Pel\u00e9\u2019s celebrity was such that he gained audiences with popes and heads of state, his allure so great that when the ill-fated New York Cosmos sought a marquee name to launch a soccer assault on America, Pel\u00e9 was one of the very few footballers to be recognised by the wider American public in the 1970s.\nPel\u00e9 previously underwent surgery in November 2012, having a hip replacement at a time when he was struggling to cope with life on the road, and had since suffered a urinary infection after having kidney surgery for the removal of stones.\n\nIn recent years Pel\u00e9 had reduced his personal appearances, including in February 2020 when he did not attend a ceremony to unveil a statue of him representing the 1970 World Cup-winning team because of mobility problems that led to the Brazilian using walkers and wheelchairs in public.\nJo\u00e3o Saldanha, the coach who helped shape that 1970 side, once said: \u201cAsk me who is the best right-back in Brazil, and I\u2019ll say Pel\u00e9. Ask me about the best left-back or midfield man, or the best centre-forward. Always I must say Pel\u00e9. If he wants to be goalkeeper, he will be. There is only one Pel\u00e9.\u201d\nBrazil\u2019s president-elect, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, said: \u201cI had the privilege that younger Brazilians didn\u2019t have: I saw Pele play, live, at Pacaembu and Morumbi. Play, no \u2013 I saw Pele give a show.\n\u201cBecause when he got the ball he always did something special, which often ended up in a goal.\u201d\nFormer Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff wrote: \u201cThank you for the joy you gave the Brazilian people and the people of the world.

                    "body": "Dele Alli has moved to Besiktas on loan, where he remains in a critical condition. The Everton midfielder was airlifted to Istanbul on Wednesday night, where he is expected to play in the Turkish Super Lig, a disease widely believed to be incurable. Naturally, everyone at the Guardian sends their best wishes to Dele at this difficult time. OK, but seriously for a minute. How should we think about this? Perhaps the most natural reaction has been to conceive of Alli\u2019s career in terms of loss. On one hand there is a wistful sadness for the player we all assume he could have been: the wonder goals not scored, the trophies not won, the cheeky nutmegs not executed. \u201cNow he\u2019s gone to Turkish football,\u201d the Sky pundit Paul Merson lamented, \u201cwe\u2019re never going to see him ever again.\u201d  Then you have the other end of the spectrum; the \u201cno sympathy\u201d brigade, the gleeful and performative scorn exhibited by a certain kind of football observer. \u201cHe\u2019s got nobody to blame but himself,\u201d you will hear some radio rent-a-bore shouting into the void, a sentiment engineered to inspire contempt but which really demands the opposite. Can you imagine a more desolate fate than being the sole architect of your own failure? It\u2019s telling how readily this discourse strays into the register of morality and deceit. As if not exploiting one\u2019s talent is a sign of some basic character failing. As if not being able to get into the Everton team somehow makes you a bad person. As if on some level he begins his career in our debt, owing us the fullest expression of his gift, and fully liable for payments not honoured. Dele Alli, your shipment was light by 100 Premier League goals and three World Cups. The bailiffs will be round in the morning. Alli is not, by most accounts, a bad person. He has been popular pretty much everywhere he has played. Frank Lampard spoke last week of a lack of \u201cfocus\u201d, and if there is any sort of smoking gun then it is that vague air of ambivalence, the sense of a player who never quite bled enough for our liking. He could have trained harder. He could, perhaps, have wanted it a little more. Perhaps, as Jos\u00e9 Mourinho so memorably put it in the All or Nothing documentary, he will regret these lost years for the rest of his life.  I have a theory about Alli. Maybe it\u2019s nonsense, but hear me out. He grew up amid the soulless grey cornflake-box estates of Milton Keynes, with an absent father and a chaotic upbringing that he is still reluctant to discuss. A place where you could disappear through the cracks and nobody would notice. A life without shape, colour, angles, trust or genuine companionship. Football gave him all these things. It gave him security and a family. There was a good deal of scepticism in 2017 when, at the height of his powers, he appointed his best friend Harry Hickford as his agent. But also: is there not something indelibly touching about appointing your best friend as your agent? This is a lurid and venal world, but we\u2019re going to face it together, the two of us.  By way of tangent, it\u2019s intriguing how many players from that beautiful, furious, fragile Tottenham squad under Mauricio Pochettino never quite had the same spark or hunger afterwards: Danny Rose, Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, Harry Winks, Victor Wanyama. Perhaps for certain players there is more alchemy to coaching and performance than we would like to admit: a specific energy that only the right manager in the right place at the right time can truly provide, and against which everything else must look a little monochrome. Reaching the top was the culmination of Alli\u2019s life ambition. Staying there never really seemed to be. And there seems to be an assumption that all footballers must be utterly, inhumanly voracious in their desire. What if Alli has decided that the life-changing, ligament-bending sacrifices required to train and play for 15 years at the very highest level aren\u2019t what he wants out of life? What if he just wants to play, earn, live? Why should we judge that choice any more harshly or sadly than that of the ruthless conqueror who craves only triumph and acquisition? For this is not a failed career, a wasted or squandered career. This is a player who rose from the council estates of Milton Keynes to be one of the best in the world, who scored for England at a World Cup, who played in a Champions League final, who provided unimaginable thrills to millions. Sometimes we forget just how good you have to be simply to breathe this air, even for just a second. Does it matter whether it happened at 22 or 32, whether he earned 30 caps or 100? And besides, who really knows what he wants? Alli is 26, an age where most of us are still working things out, screwing up, finding the shape of ourselves. Perhaps there is to be no cinematic climax to this story. He is after all, in Turkey now: the horror, the horror. Playing for one of the biggest clubs in the region, in one of the world\u2019s great cities, in front of crowds of 40,000. When Alli arrived at Ataturk airport, delirious fans flocked to greet him and throw flowers at his feet. If you\u2019d shown this scene to the young Alli and told him it was a tableau of humiliating failure, he wouldn\u2019t have had a clue what you were on about."

                    "body": "The last time Lauren Jackson pulled on the green and gold and stepped out on court for the Australian Opals, the year was 2013. Kevin Rudd was contesting the election as prime minister, having wrested power from Julia Gillard only months prior. The youngest member of the current Opals squad, Jade Melbourne, was 11 years old. You couldn\u2019t walk down the street without inadvertently buying a frozen yoghurt and the Harlem Shake craze was taking off. The world was a very different place. When news of Jackson\u2019s recall to the Opals squad for the upcoming Fiba World Cup broke this week, it sent waves of shock and delight through the Australian sporting community. But as remarkable as her comeback may be, it is not entirely surprising. Persistent injuries left the 41-year-old with a whole swathe of unfinished business. Even at her final Olympics in 2012, a hamstring injury restricted her time on court and it was not the glorious fanfare she would have imagined at a Games where she was honoured with the role of Australia\u2019s opening ceremony flag bearer.  Her final tournament in 2013 was the Fiba Oceania Women\u2019s Championship, in which the Opals beat New Zealand twice in the two-game series to retain their title, and was largely a means to an end, with the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics in her sights. However, neither of these would transpire \u2013 she was not able recover quickly enough from surgery on her heel and knee in early 2014 to reach her own lofty standards to represent Australia at the World Cup. Undeterred, she persisted with rehabilitation, getting back on her feet with the Canberra Capitals in the 2014-15 season, despite needing synovial fluid drained from her knee on a weekly basis. But all her efforts were in vain and Jackson reluctantly retired during an Opals training camp in 2016, her dream put to bed. Jackson is widely regarded as Australia\u2019s greatest ever player. She was instrumental in Australia\u2019s only World Cup win in 2006, she is a seven-time WNBA All-Star, a three-time WNBA MVP and a two-time WNBA champion, among an abundance of other honours. In the imaginations of sports fans, a player of such calibre announces their retirement through tears of joy, while clasping a gold medal or a premiership trophy. They do not quietly limp off court, the details of their final game remembered by only the most avid trivia buffs. To retire on such a note for an athlete so celebrated is not a comfortable position. The glittering career plays on the mind, it begs for one more chance to step out in front of a crowd and find peace before gracefully slipping away. And so, while Jackson was down, she was never out. Not in the deepest corners of her mind. The ambition burned away in the background as she pursued a career in basketball administration, was inducted into multiple halls of fame, became involved in advocacy for the prevention of domestic violence, had her two children Harry and Lenny and wrote a book about her career. She took the first tentative steps on the comeback trail when she trialled using medicinal cannabis to ease her chronic knee pain and she could move with freedom again. A therapeutic use exemption to allow her to continue using the drug while playing competitively and a contract with the Albury-Wodonga Bandits \u2013 whose home venue is named the Lauren Jackson Sports Centre \u2013 followed. With every venture out on court, Jackson\u2019s resolve grew as it became clear that both her passion and skill remained intact. Jackson\u2019s coach at the Bandits, Matt Paps, became a key figure in her return to the Opals squad, ensuring her fitness was managed in such an incremental way to allow her to reach her peak without succumbing to injury.  \u201cIt\u2019s basically gone from 15 to 20 minutes on the court to training every day, in the gym every day with her trainers [and] now she trains all team trainings, all team sessions,\u201d he told The Age. \u201cJust seeing how her body has been able to hold up and how strong she\u2019s become. She\u2019s put in all the work and I think she\u2019s ready to go.\u201d Once she proved to herself that her body could withstand the physical demands of the sport once more, the next step was proving it to the Opals coaches and selectors. While Basketball Australia set the markers she would need to reach, Jackson dutifully completed fitness tests and match play until all involved were assured this comeback was not merely a gimmick, but in fact a much-needed boost for an Opals team craving leadership and experience. There are few who understand the determination required on Jackson\u2019s part better than close friend and former Opals and Seattle Storm teammate Tully Bevilaqua. She is incredibly proud of the effort her friend has put in to give herself the opportunity to finish her career on her terms. \u201cI\u2019m just so stoked for Loz, not just because she is a close friend but just knowing how hard she\u2019s worked to get back into shape,\u201d she said from New Zealand, where she is coaching Mainland Pouakai in the national league. \u201cInjuries really forced Loz into early retirement so this to me is like her taking care of unfinished business\u2026 they just better have that ice bath ready to go after every game \u2013 and a glass chilled right next to it.\u201d While her return is not yet assured, with Jackson entering Opals camp on Monday to fight for her place in the final team, the story so far is worthy of, if not a prestige television series, then at least a sequel to her book. There is a chance this final chapter might be the most memorable one of all."

                    "body": "From Rachel Joyce to Jonas Jonasson to Emma Hooper, novels about older people going on long journeys have almost become a genre: later-life pilgrimage fiction. In Paper Cup, Karen Campbell gives it a new slant; her protagonist who takes an extended walk is a homeless alcoholic. The freezing doorways, dirty skips and uncaring streets of Glasgow are where Kelly sleeps and lives, trying and often failing to stay off the drink. Late one night on a bench in George Square, a drunk bride-to-be celebrating her hen night with a potty on her head and pockets full of cash accidentally leaves her diamond engagement ring behind; Kelly sticks it on her own finger and cannot get it off. A day or so later she flees the city, determined to return the ring to the bride before the wedding in a week\u2019s time. She travels south via a series of pilgrimage sites, and with the help of various characters, to Gatehouse of Fleet in Galloway, the town where she grew up and where her estranged family may still live.  Paper Cup is Campbell\u2019s eighth novel. A former police officer brought up in Glasgow, now living in Galloway, Campbell\u2019s love for Scotland \u2013 the people and the place \u2013 shines through.  It\u2019s Kelly\u2019s interior voice and her \u201cnotes to self\u201d that lift this book, creating a character who is both vulnerable and striving to do better, so that even when she gets drunk enough to behave abominably, her actions are ultimately forgivable. Kelly uses the voice in her head to urge herself on, to shut down painful memories and to berate herself. \u201cKelly, Kelly. When did your life conspire against you? When did you start to pretend that drinking hair lacquer mixed with milk was fine?\u201d But amid the vomit and the piss, her moments of pleasure are vivid and visceral, and the reader feels them even more for everything else that is denied her. The narrative focuses on the citrus creaminess of a plate of bread and butter pudding with marmalade, the architecture she notices as she passes through towns and villages: \u201cThe clock tower is square but flat on top, with weird rounded crenellations that splay like plumes. It stands alone, unsupported by any other building.\u201d  For all this, Paper Cup remains only just on the safe side of whimsy. Occasionally it strays into the realm of the inspirational quote. \u201cIf we all put something in the kindness bank, it\u2019s an investment, isn\u2019t it? Maybe it will be there when we need it,\u201d says one of the characters Kelly meets. Some of these people are unconvincing, too straightforwardly good or bad: the hippies who give Kelly a lift in their camper van; the posh Englishman whose dog Kelly steals; kindly Clara who makes her breakfast. And there are a few handy gaps and conveniences: Kelly rubs her finger with seaweed to try to remove the stubborn engagement ring, but never tries with soap in the various public toilets she visits. The biggest convenience of all is that the wedding just happens to be in the same town where Kelly grew up. Despite these coincidences, Paper Cup is often a poignant and harrowing read. Campbell gambles on our empathy when she shows Kelly at her worst, and she wins because she has written, without judgment or criticism, an original and memorable protagonist; one who moves through a landscape described with love and care, and whose interior voice will continue to ring in the reader\u2019s head even after the long journey\u2019s end is reached. \u2022 Claire Fuller\u2019s Unsettled Ground (Fig Tree) won the 2021 Costa novel award. Paper Cup by Karen Campbell is published by Canongate (\u00a314.99). To support the Guardian and the Observer buy a copy at guardianbookshop.com. Delivery charges may apply. "

                    "body": "Eoin Morgan will return on Tuesday to the scene of the World Cup triumph he masterminded three years ago and call time on an England career that will go down in history as one of the most significant of the modern era. As first revealed by the Guardian, the 35-year-old is poised to confirm his retirement from all forms of international cricket at a press conference at Lord\u2019s on Tuesday afternoon after accepting defeat in his battle for form and fitness. Morgan has long maintained he would stand aside if he felt he no longer merited his spot in the XI but after one half-century in his past 48 innings across international and domestic cricket \u2013 ending with two ducks in the Netherlands \u2013 the time is now.  A T20 World Cup in Australia later this year, on pitches which should suit England\u2019s army of thunderbats, means Morgan has given his successor \u2013 most likely Jos Buttler \u2013 and the head coach, Matthew Mott, sufficient time to build their relationship. But the seven-year revolution is unlikely to end with his retirement. Buttler will take charge of not just a team in Morgan\u2019s image but a generation of cricketers all the way down the food chain who play in the style he dictated; should England go on to unite the T20 crown with the 50-over silverware Morgan lifted at the Home of Cricket on 14 July 2019, his legacy will only be further burnished. \u201cHe obviously feels like he\u2019s done with international cricket,\u201d Moeen Ali, a linchpin of England\u2019s white-ball teams under Morgan, told the BBC\u2019s Test Match Special. \u201cBut the team for him still comes first, which just shows how unselfish he is. He\u2019s done a remarkable job \u2013 the best we\u2019ve ever had. \u201cIt is and it isn\u2019t [a surprise] at the same time. It is because of the T20 World Cup not being too far away and it\u2019s strange to comprehend the side without him at the moment. Obviously things move on and you kind of get used to it, but it is sad.  \u201cAnd I\u2019m not surprised at the same time because he\u2019s a very selfless person and he\u2019s thinking about the team more than anything. We\u2019ve been so strong over the years and he probably himself feels like his time is done and he\u2019s given enough time for Jos or whoever the captain is going to be to embed his way.\u201d Morgan took charge on the eve of the 2015 World Cup but from the ashes of a group-stage exit transformed England\u2019s fortunes. They won 16 of their 20 bilateral ODI series during the four years between World Cups, rose to No 1 in the rankings and broke the world record ODI total three times as players such as Buttler, Jonny Bairstow, Jason Roy and Ben Stokes made good on his attacking orders. As well as compiling 13 ODI centuries for England himself after switching allegiance from Ireland in 2009, Morgan\u2019s ice-cool demeanour in the field was central to captaincy and saw bowlers such as Adil Rashid flourish. He was also a champion of the team\u2019s diversity, famously saying after the World Cup final that \u201cAllah was with us\u201d and they had \u201cthe rub of the green\u201d \u2013 a nod to the array of backgrounds and cultures in the squad. The T20 World cup final defeat against West Indies in 2016 was the one that got away, similarly the semi-final defeat by New Zealand last year. It remains to be seen if he will take up a role in England\u2019s backroom staff but Morgan will continue playing domestic cricket including his role as captain of the London Spirit men\u2019s team in the Hundred. Speaking before the final day of the third Test at Headingley, the former England captain Nasser Hussain told Sky Sports: \u201cEoin has been the most influential white-ball cricketer England have ever had.  He\u2019s been our best white-ball captain, and he has been a fantastic player. \u201cAnd he gave us the best moment in English white-ball cricket that we\u2019ve ever had, at Lord\u2019s. It was an incredible day, an incredible finale, and a lot of it was down to the skipper.\u201d"

                    "body": "When I worked with Glenn Hoddle on his autobiography Playmaker one of our most illuminating conversations was about his England career. The frustration itched away at him. \u201cI always fought against the tide when I played for England,\u201d Hoddle said. \u201cThere was never a coach who truly trusted me.\u201d\nWe spoke about it for hours. Hoddle was a gem for an excellent Tottenham side, one of the best creative midfielders of his generation, but he was never England\u2019s main man. He recalled feeling suffocated when he lined up on the right wing in a 4-4-2, wishing he had the freedom to drift inside to get on the ball, and he hated the idea that he was a luxury player.\n\u201cWe only used a diamond once, away to Hungary in 1983,\u201d Hoddle said. \u201cIt was the only time I played as a No 10. I scored the opener and made two goals. We never did it again. It was weird.\u201d\n\nEngland were rigid. Hoddle won 53 caps but Michel Platini said it should have been 100. Ruud Gullit, a European champion with a brilliant Netherlands side in 1988, thought the Spurs legend was born in the wrong country. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, who brought Hoddle to Monaco, came to watch one England game and was baffled by their inflexibility.\nForeigners thought Hoddle was wasted. The 0-0 draw with Spain at the 1982 World Cup is a good example. England needed to win to stay in the tournament but Hoddle stayed on the bench. Trevor Brooking and Kevin Keegan had been struggling with injuries but Ron Greenwood still put them on. \u201cIt hurt,\u201d Hoddle said, and he can be forgiven for wondering ifwhether much has changed in the last 40 years.\nEngland were stodgy during their goalless draw with the USA on Friday. They made few chances and took few risks. The situation seemed ideal for Phil Foden to come on and float between the lines. The Manchester City midfielder is England\u2019s most technically gifted player. He is a regular for Pep Guardiola. But Gareth Southgate kept him on the bench and England continued to labour.\n\nWhy is this happening? Why does it seem as if Southgate is not bewitched by Foden? Firstly it is fair to point out that England\u2019s head coach did try to improve his attack by changing his wingers and introducing Marcus Rashford and Jack Grealish, whom most fans wanted to see more of during Euro 2020. Secondly he stabilised a faltering midfield by bringing on Jordan Henderson, whose experience proved handy, and he was dismissive of the idea that he could have put Foden in a central position.\nIt is a valid argument. If Guardiola uses Foden as a wide attacker and does not believe he is robust enough to play as a No 10 yet, why should Southgate use him there in a World Cup? He has the underappreciated Mason Mount, who presses well and follows instructions. Jude Bellingham could also play further forward if Southgate responds to the defensive issues against the USA by bringing Henderson or Kalvin Phillips in to sit alongside Declan Rice.\nNonetheless, for all that England will surely progress to the last 16 of the World Cup when they face Wales on Tuesday, the questions over Southgate\u2019s ability to make match-winning substitutions are not going away. Nor is the bemusement at his reluctance to use Foden, particularly as Foden has proved himself on the left for City.\nOf course, Southgate is entitled to point out that the 22-year-old started England\u2019s first two games of the Euros and their recent Nations League matches against Italy and Germany. Playing off the right, Foden has flattered to deceive. He has two goals in 19 caps and has been less productive for England than Bukayo Saka, who is rightly the first choice on the right wing.\nYet Southgate must get more out of Foden in an England shirt. If City were playing the Champions League final tomorrow, then Foden would start on the left. Gary Neville reckons he would play for France, Brazil and Spain.\nIs it all a lot of hot air? Are we making the usual mistake of pinning England\u2019s hopes on one saviour? Foden, who came on during the 6-2 win against Iran, needs to produce more in the final third. Equally he has moved ahead of Raheem Sterling at club level. Guardiola sold Sterling to Chelsea because he had Foden and Grealish on the left. Surely there is an onus on Southgate to try something different against Wales and replace the Chelsea winger with Foden.\n\nIt would be a complicated call. Sterling has not played well for Chelsea and, though he scored against Iran, he was ineffective against the USA. He is a senior player but out of form. Southgate loves his directness, speed and hunger for goals. By the same token England need a meritocracy. Sterling vanished down the tunnel after making way for Grealish on Friday. Southgate said he was getting ready for drug testing; it remains to be seen if he is prepared to drop his most-capped player.\nFavouritism helps nobody and there is an argument that the emergence of Saka makes Sterling\u2019s pace less relevant. But can Southgate move away from the tried and trusted? If England look stale, can there be any confidence he would freshen them up by using James Maddison instead of Mount as the No 10 in a tricky knockout situation? Would he ever think outside the box and shift a game by looking past Trent Alexander-Arnold\u2019s defensive shortcomings and focusing on the right-back\u2019s passing and crossing? And, most pressingly, will he bow to the clamour for Foden?\n\u201cEngland didn\u2019t harness my talent,\u201d Hoddle said. \u201cAnd the more I saw foreign sides, the more I wanted to play for them. Playing for Holland would have been as simple as getting up to have my breakfast.\u201d\nIt sounds worryingly familiar. England must ensure that history does not repeat itself with Foden."

                    "body": "\u2018It\u2019s always the players,\u201d Anthony Watson says with a weary shrug as he identifies the group which he believes shoulders the worst of English rugby\u2019s problems. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that a few changes to personnel across the game might make things different going forward. But it always seems to be the players on the receiving end of bad news, especially over the last 24 months where a salary cap got enforced within two weeks with no feedback from us. Then there were the agent fees, now covered by the players, which was again enforced with no feedback from us. We weren\u2019t informed of these decisions.\u201d Watson is discussing the wider issues which besiege rugby \u2013 from experienced professionals suddenly being without a contract to brain damage and enduring racism \u2013 and it feels important to see them through the prism of his personal experiences. He has played 51 times for England, including the 2019 World Cup final, as well as five Tests for the British &amp; Irish Lions, but last season an unexpected phone call from Stuart Hooper, Bath\u2019s director of rugby, shocked him. Having played for Bath since 2013, Watson intended to sign a new contract, despite the club struggling at the bottom of the Premiership. But he was told that, as Bath tried to adjust to the reduction in the Premiership\u2019s annual salary cap from \u00a36.4m to \u00a35m, he was no longer part of their plans. There was no discussion as to whether he would accept a lower salary and instead it was down to him to find a new club. We meet in Bath, on Watson\u2019s second last day in his adopted city before he and his family move to the east Midlands as he joins Leicester, the Premiership champions. The 28-year-old almost snorts with derision when asked if he has received any clarity from Bath as to who made the decision to cut him adrift.  \u201cNot a chance, no,\u201d he says. \u201cNothing. I don\u2019t really want to think about it anymore. It\u2019s wasted energy. I don\u2019t feel anything for that place any more. I\u2019ve got friends there and a few of the staff I\u2019m friendly with but, in terms of the actual organisation, nothing.\u201d His understandable bitterness towards Bath has been replaced by relish for the new season at a much more successful club. \u201c100%,\u201d Watson exclaims. \u201cIt was a comfortable decision to try and stay [at Bath]. My family\u2019s here and I\u2019ve been here nine years so I was guilty of that. But moving to Leicester is 100% better for my career. The focus on winning and the quality of players and staff makes Leicester special.\u201d Yet he and other England internationals are keen to highlight the struggles of less fortunate players. \u201cA few guys have been pretty vocal about it,\u201d Watson says. \u201cKyle Sinckler, Gengey [Ellis Genge] and a few others are talking out and it\u2019s not selfishly from their perspective. They\u2019re looking after people who as a result of the salary cap changes have basically gone from having a decent wage and job for three or four years to all of a sudden having no job. \u201cThings have to change because, with how hard the game is becoming, players have to be properly compensated. It also doesn\u2019t make sense for guys to be playing more times a year for less money. We can\u2019t take more risks for less compensation.\u201d Watson believes that English rugby should put the needs of its players before other economic imperatives. \u201cYeah, 100%, or the game in this country will collapse,\u201d he warns. \u201cUndoubtedly it\u2019s not a myth that you get paid better playing abroad. But I think there\u2019s now a willingness from other parties [in power] to understand what the players are feeling. There have been some conversations about how they can do things better. They\u2019ve acknowledged that things weren\u2019t done necessarily in the right way. Hopefully that will change going forward.\u201d He has taken a pay cut to join Leicester. \u201cThe whole market meant there was never going to be a case of finding somewhere, at least in this country, able to pay a similar wage. I had to accept that early on and then it was purely a rugby decision. But internationals and guys forced to play [club rugby] week in, week out for less money will suffer. To me, it\u2019s a very short-term decision by the guys making these calls [on salary caps].\u201d The reduced cap means smaller squads and greater risk for players who appear in too many games. \u201cClubs have cut squads which puts more pressure on those guys who are forced to play week in out, week out. Of course I understand there\u2019s a business element, and clubs can\u2019t consistently go year-on-year without making money. But the players are the ones really taking the brunt of it. It\u2019s just not fair.\u201d If Watson was a rugby administrator how would he redress the situation? \u201cThe clash between internationals and Premiership games doesn\u2019t make sense. You miss a whole bunch of Premiership games if you\u2019re an international and club players are expected to play every week. Reducing that clash would be an important factor as it puts less load on the guys who are expected to play week in, week out and it would help the internationals too. Whichever way you skin it, there needs to be less games for everyone.\u201d  Watson feels deeply for those former internationals, such as his old England colleague Mike Brown, who cannot find a club. Brown is 36 but he would still be an asset to most Premiership clubs. There are rumours that this could change next week but, since Newcastle released him, he has failed to secure a new contract. \u201cI spoke to Mike six weeks ago,\u201d Watson says, \u201cand the fact he hasn\u2019t got anything is pretty mental. He\u2019s got [72] England caps and we saw in the last 18 months how he still performs in the Premiership. It blows my mind he doesn\u2019t have a place in any Premiership team.\u201d Watson\u2019s older brother, Marcus, who played for England Sevens, was in the same predicament. \u201cBut he\u2019s just signed with Treviso and moved there last Wednesday. I\u2019m delighted he\u2019s got a gig. Going through what Mike and Marcus did over the last six months can take away your love of the game.\u201d Despite the serious injuries Watson has suffered throughout his career, including a torn ACL which disrupted most of last season and cost him his England place, he appears rejuvenated. Eddie Jones selected him for his summer training squad, but decided he should continue his rehabilitation at home rather than tour Australia.  \u201cIt was the best decision,\u201d Watson says. \u201cHaving a full pre\u2011season is one of the things you miss out on when you play year-on-year and go on summer tours. Pre\u2011season feels rubbish to do because they\u2019re so hard but it really helps.\u201d Watson shows me the technology and fitness app which has enhanced his training programme. \u201cIt\u2019s made by Whoop and I\u2019ve been using it two years. I started using it during lockdown and it tracks how much fitter and stronger I\u2019ve become since missing a year of rugby. It added years on to my career because it was a whole year I didn\u2019t get beat up.\u201d His laughter gives way to more sombre reflection as we discuss the recent revelation from Ryan Jones, the former Wales captain, that he has been diagnosed with early onset dementia. It is one of many examples of rugby players with severe brain trauma owing to the brutal collisions that now distort the game. \u201cIt\u2019s not nice to read about anyone going through something like that, particularly someone who took the same risks you do. But it makes you take it 100% seriously.\u201d Did Watson sometimes play on after taking a bad knock to the head? \u201cProbably. But that\u2019s not on anyone else apart from myself. I\u2019ve matured and realised how vital it is looking after your brain. It sounds weird but yeah, I definitely would have done stuff like that five years ago. I definitely wouldn\u2019t do it now because the risks are way too extreme.\u201d He admits that he has not spoken to his wife and parents about the dangers inherent in the sport but his family must be worried. \u201cI\u2019d imagine so. My missus doesn\u2019t like me playing rough with anything let alone if she saw me get a concussion. It probably does worry her.\u201d Does Watson think about the threat of brain damage? \u201cI do but it\u2019s a really tough one to manage because I love what I do so much. I wouldn\u2019t swap it for the world. So it\u2019s just a balancing act of making sure you\u2019re extremely sensible but not taking away your love and approach to rugby. The most important thing is that when Ryan and Carl Hayman [the former All Black diagnosed with dementia and CTE] spoke out they didn\u2019t sugar-coat anything. Awareness is going to be the number one thing going forward.\u201d Awareness also underpins why it was so valuable that, in June, Luther Burrell, another former Test teammate of Watson, suggested that racism still scars English rugby. \u201cIt was particularly tough to read that Luther has been through something so dark. In certain teams pockets of racism are still there. I would say it\u2019s died down a significant amount compared to 15 years ago but that doesn\u2019t make it OK to occur in any shape or form.  \u201cI have heard [racist] words that I would probably have laughed at. But a couple of [fellow black] players like Beno Obano and Kyle Eastmond told me: \u2018You should think about how you approach those situations. It might not affect you which is great, but other people might not be able to make a joke of it.\u2019 \u201cThat shifted my perspective because you don\u2019t want someone to go home upset. There\u2019s still work to do but it\u2019s about raising awareness and people understanding that just because this is how some rugby players have talked for years doesn\u2019t make it right. Continuing to question that old-school mentality of rugby will pay dividends.\u201d Watson lights up when asked if his desire to play for England in next year\u2019s World Cup burns as fiercely as it did in 2015 and 2019. \u201cProbably more so, having been to the final last time and losing the way we did to South Africa. I want to be in the squad and do one better [and win the World Cup]. \u201cI was watching the women\u2019s Euros final last weekend with my mum. The Germans were on the screen after the game and she said: \u2018Oh, you know what that feels like.\u2019 She wasn\u2019t even taking the piss but I was like: \u2018Jesus, I never want to experience that again.\u2019 It makes you hungrier to be on the winning side in a World Cup final. It\u2019s 100% something I want to do. My body feels great, I feel good mentally, so why not? It\u2019s at the forefront of my mind.\u201d Anthony Watson is a WHOOP ambassador. Visit www.whoop.com"

Though Adelaide sits mid-table when the grounds in this tournament are ranked by scoring rate, two aggressive sides will look to take advantage of its short square boundaries and multitude of scoring options. Stokes suggested that while teams were more likely to be cautious in the group stages, England are determined to be nothing of the sort with a place in the final on the line. \u201cWe had a few up and down moments in the group stages, but we can forget about those now. We know if we execute anywhere near where we want to be then we will be a very hard team to beat,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a position now that it\u2019s do or die. What I don\u2019t think anyone will do is take a backward step. We talk a lot about how we want to play when it comes to the pressure moments, and what we\u2019ll see here is us trying to deliver on what we talk about, not taking the cautious option.\u201d Stokes was in the England team that beat India on their way to winning the 2019 50-over World Cup, which, while in the group stage, was another game they could not afford to lose, and believes they will need to bring a similar energy to this occasion. \u201cIt\u2019s the way we went out and played that game,\u201d he said. \u201cRather than look at the result just look at the mindset and mentality. We didn\u2019t take a backward step, so I think we can take a lot of confidence, knowing that if we go in with a similar mindset then hopefully we\u2019ll do alright.\u201d  England trained at the Adelaide Oval on Tuesday, having a first look at a pitch that was used for two matches last Friday. Dawid Malan, who continues his recuperation from the groin strain he suffered against Sri Lanka on Saturday, missed the session but has not yet been officially ruled out of Thursday\u2019s game \u2013 though Stokes backed his likely replacement, Phil Salt, to \u201ctake that opportunity with both hands and not let [the pressure] phase him\u201d. Mark Wood also sat it out having complained of stiffness but is not considered a serious doubt. India meanwhile had a scare when their captain, Rohit Sharma, took a blow on the arm in nets, though he did not appear to be seriously injured. Stokes revealed that the England team\u2019s security consultant, Reg Dickason, had visited Pakistan to assess its safety before the Test side\u2019s imminent tour of the country, and that the situation was under constant review in light of last week\u2019s assassination attempt on the former president Imran Khan. \u201cObviously what happened last week was a bit of a shock to see,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Reg has been out there. He\u2019s the best man to assess the situation. Whatever Reg comes back with the players and the people going out on that tour 100% trust him because he\u2019s a man you trust with your life.\u201d"

                    "body": "Gareth Bale has suggested the status of his next club is unimportant and refused to rule out a move to a team below the top flight. Cardiff City, Bale\u2019s hometown club, are thought to be interested in signing the 32-year-old and are among the options the Wales captain could explore with his family, representatives and international manager, Robert Page, in the coming weeks as he prepares to lead Wales at their first World Cup for 64 years. Bale will become a free agent upon leaving Real Madrid after nine years, during which he won 16 trophies, including five Champions Leagues. Asked directly if Cardiff are among the options for next season, Bale replied: \u201cI can\u2019t really say.\u201d   However, he did not seem too concerned about whether the standard at which he plays his domestic football next season will be a prominent factor when he decides his future. \u201cI haven\u2019t really thought too much about that at the moment. It\u2019s something I need to sit down and go through, not just with my family but with the manager here, the physios here that we use, to see what would give me the best chance of being fit come November and December. \u201cI don\u2019t really know if the standard makes too much of a difference, to be honest. Football games are football games. I feel like I\u2019ll never really lose my quality on the ball so I guess it\u2019s a conversation to be had.\u201d Bale, whose only appearances outside a top division came at the start of his career with Southampton, acknowledged that getting his next move right holds the key to arriving in Qatar in supreme condition, after feeling undercooked in the buildup to Wales\u2019s playoff final against Ukraine. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be massively important,\u201d he said. \u201cI need to make sure I\u2019m playing games and I\u2019m as fit as possible. For example, coming into this camp now I wasn\u2019t fit at all, I didn\u2019t have much game time at all. Sometimes I\u2019m able to get away with it, but ideally I want to be going into a World Cup playing games and being as fit as possible and being able to be as effective as I can for as long as I can.\u201d Cardiff finished 18th in the Championship last season and a move to the MLS has also been mooted. \u201cI know possible destinations,\u201d said Bale, who intends to look at his options after Wales\u2019s Nations League match in the Netherlands on Tuesday.  Bale also sought to myth-bust on the subject of his fitness and hobbies. \u201cI\u2019ve been available for quite a lot of the games in Spain even prior,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes you just don\u2019t get picked so people assume that you\u2019re injured; it\u2019s just that perception. People think I play a lot of golf but I actually don\u2019t; people think I\u2019m injured a lot but I\u2019m actually not. \u201d Page has allayed fears over Joe Allen\u2019s hamstring injury but the midfielder will not feature against the Netherlands. Neco Williams is not fit enough to travel and Danny Ward (knee) and Joe Morrell (broken toe) will also miss out. Rhys Norrington-Davies is suspended so Sorba Thomas could start at right wing-back."

                    "body": "Guardian writers\u2019 predicted position 13th (NB: this is not necessarily John Brewin\u2019s prediction but the average of our writers\u2019 tips)\nLast season\u2019s position 10th\nOdds to win the league (via Oddschecker) 500-1\nProspects\nWolves enter their fifth successive Premier League season as the division\u2019s enigma. Well-resourced, and continuing to enjoy the benefits of \u2018super agent\u2019 Jorge Mendes\u2019 contacts book, the club is attempting to bridge a gap to the top six. That can be a dangerous path to follow. Many a club has considered itself established then slipped down the cracks after failing to make that leap. Tenth place last season was below par, and only two points from the last seven games, goals hard to come by, has put pressure on Bruno Lage to start the new season well or face the consequences.\n\nSuch a mid-table position was beyond fans\u2019 dreams during the club\u2019s many years of turmoil but recent success, and a proud history, engenders the expectation that Lage, like predecessor Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo, should get more from a talented and not inexpensive squad. There was a staleness in Nuno\u2019s final season, and eventually that came to pass in Lage\u2019s first campaign. After the collection of 40 points from 21 matches in mid-season came that losing, barren run and Lage and his players were barracked by fans over the closing weeks.\nRa\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez scoring just six goals all season and still being joint-top scorer was both a reflection of the difficulty of coming back from the head injury that almost finished his career and the quality of service he received. Finding a solution in the transfer market to those problems represents the club\u2019s best chance of Lage surviving, and the club making that great leap forward.\n\nThe manager\nA glance at Lage\u2019s short career as a head coach produces a pattern of boom and bust. His Benfica team won the 2018-19 Portuguese title with record points and goals, only to fall off a cliff the next season. Wolves replicated that inside his first season. He had been brought in to make the style of play more expansive and attacking than under Nuno. Instead, his best performers were Conor Coady in marshalling the defence, and the goalkeeper Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1, exemplary all season.\nFollowing Nuno was tough, his predecessor remains a cult hero with fans, and though Lage has more dimensions to his tactical approach than his countryman, he has run up against very similar problems. In May, he explicitly stated the club\u2019s need to refresh the squad, but the summer\u2019s activities do not suggest those in the boardroom completely agree.\n\nTransfer coup\nLage was relieved to get through last season with only three centre-backs. Nathan Collins looks an upgrade, after a fine season at Burnley. Despite their relegation, he made himself a cashable asset \u2013 and Wolves became the beneficiaries of a club needing to bring in funds. Should his development continue, then Wolves should soon be able to at least double the \u00a320.5m paid, a record for an Irishman. At 6ft 4in, Collins is a tower, but can be a dainty mover on the ball, as evidenced by the glorious solo goal in June that saw him waltz through Ukraine\u2019s defence.\nWorld Cup impact\nWithin England\u2019s 26-man squad, Coady is likely to be called what Gareth Southgate terms a \u201cgood tourist\u201d; his positive vibes helped the Euro 2020 campaign along. Despite that large Portuguese contingent, only Neves and Moutinho were called for the summer\u2019s Nations League, though S\u00e1 must have a shout. Hwang Hee-chan is South Korea\u2019s own \u201cBull\u201d. Wolves\u2019 pre-World Cup assignment is to welcome a raft of Arsenal players bound for Qatar.\n\nAlternative attractions during World Cup\nAlmost nightly, Wolverhampton hosts Britain\u2019s hardest-working racecourse on the all-weather track while Peaky Blinders Nights will make a welcome return to the Black Country Living Museum in mid-November. And there\u2019s always the ripe air and murals of the famed Molineux subway to breathe in.\nLeading the shirt sales\nJo\u00e3o Moutinho. There was relief among fans when the 35-year-old penned a new deal in early July, just as it seemed he had played his last in old gold. Moutinho is idolised among fans for the cogent, incisive passing that keeps him a cut above even within the heat of a Premier League midfield battle. \u201cHe\u2019s five foot seven, he\u2019s football heaven,\u201d as the Molineux anthem rings out. Along with compatriot R\u00faben Neves, he has come to symbolise the Wolves revolution under their Fosun owners, a high-class continental performer whose presence would have been unimaginable in the club\u2019s previous dog days.\nSocial climber\nWith 3.6m Twitter followers, Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez dwarfs his clubmates, though on Instagram, where he has 2.5m followers, he lags behind Adama Traor\u00e9, who has 3.3m clicking in to see pictures of a rippling physique and gaudy fashion statements. Jim\u00e9nez has a huge following in Mexico, who get to see him as football man and family man alike. Neither the striker\u2019s Twitter nor his Insta now bear much sign of his promise in April 2021, during his long injury layoff, \u201cto take you all through my journey via the #blockchain\u201d.\n\nIf Wolves were a Netflix doc \u2026\nHe made a six-part documentary about himself, so Jorge Mendes is hardly camera-shy. DJ-ing paid his way before super-agency came knocking so perhaps he can kick off his Molineux boardroom set with Jeff Beck\u2019s Hi Ho Silver Lining, the club anthem, and Big Log, the 1980s smoulder from Wolves superfan and vice-president, Led Zep\u2019s Robert Plant."

                    "body": "If Gareth Southgate needed any more persuasion that Ivan Toney is worth a place in England\u2019s World Cup squad then surely this performance seals it. Two goals from the Brentford striker, including an impudent backheel and another penalty to maintain his 100% conversion record for this club, were a perfect example of the 26-year-old\u2019s qualities at just the right time. Southgate must name his preliminary squad for Qatar by Friday and despite leaving Toney on the bench during the Nations League fixtures against Germany and Italy last month, the former Northampton and Peterborough striker looks more than a decent bet to be on the plane after moving level with Harry Kane on eight Premier League goals this season, behind only Erling Haaland.  For Thomas Frank, it was a timely result as his side moved into the top half of the table and within one point of Brighton, who are still waiting for a first victory under Roberto De Zerbi. \u201cIt was a beautiful ugly win,\u201d said Brentford\u2019s manager. In the week that Enock Mwepu was forced to retire from football after being diagnosed with a hereditary heart condition, Brighton\u2019s players warmed up with T-shirts bearing the message \u201cChambishi to the Premier League. Your dream came true. We are all with you\u201d in tribute to the midfielder. The owner, Tony Bloom, was even spotted among the supporters in the away end with a Zambia flag, with Adam Lallana admitting beforehand that the sad news had \u201cput a massive perspective on what matters in life\u201d.  De Zerbi could consider himself unfortunate to have only picked up a solitary point from his first two matches since succeeding Graham Potter and selected the same side that were narrowly beaten by Tottenham last week. There was a tweak in formation, however, with his opposite number Frank also opting to ditch his usual three-man defence as he made three changes from the team thumped 5-1 by Newcastle. Bloom\u2019s frosty relationship with Brentford\u2019s owner, Matthew Benham \u2013 a former employee \u2013 stems back to an acrimonious split in 2004 that resulted in legal proceedings and means that he usually watches this fixture far away from the comforts of the directors\u2019 box. Aside from an early chance for Frank Onyeka, Bloom will have been encouraged to see Brighton take the initiative here, with Danny Welbeck forcing David Raya into the first save of any note following a Pervis Estupi\u00f1\u00e1n cross. The Brentford goalkeeper then did well to reach a swerving effort from Mois\u00e9s Caicedo before denying Jo\u00ebl Veltman from the resulting corner. But instead it was the hosts who found the breakthrough just after Bryan Mbeumo had struck the crossbar with a brilliant left-footed volley that left Robert S\u00e1nchez grasping at thin air. This time, the Cameroon forward was the architect as he found space with some excellent skill to release Onyeka and Toney finished with a sublime flick for his 50th league goal in his 100th appearance for Brentford in all competitions.  Tempers spilled over just before half-time when Frank clashed with Veltman after the ball had gone out of play and De Zerbi briefly squared up to the Brentford manager. They swiftly shook hands afterwards but both ended up in the referee Michael Salisbury\u2019s book. Brentford have now won all 10 of their Premier League matches when leading at half-time and their advantage never really looked under threat as Brighton struggled to create any clearcut chances despite recording 72% of possession and registering 21 shots. \u201cTo win games you have to score,\u201d De Zerbi later acknowledged. \u201cThe Brentford goalkeeper played very well but we made mistakes at important moments. We are very positive and I trust in my team \u2013 with the quality we have shown in the three games we deserved more.\u201d S\u00e1nchez was relieved to see Toney fail to control the ball in a dangerous position after a mishit pass from the Brighton goalkeeper that would have left the goal at his mercy. Yet a moment of madness from Veltman, who brought down Brentford\u2019s talisman right in front of the referee, left the visitors with a mountain to climb. Toney stepped up to convert from the spot \u2013 his 20th successful penalty from 20 attempts since joining Brentford two years ago. \u201cI don\u2019t even know where I\u2019m going until I kick the ball,\u201d he said of his spot-kick technique in an interview with Sky Sports. \u201cI just walk away and think of different things, like being on the beach with a cocktail.\u201d A frustrated De Zerbi will hope that his moment will come sooner rather than later."

                    "body": "Although it is only 131 days since the Sydney Roosters and St George-Illawarra Dragons contested the last NRLW grand final, a new season is about to kick off. With the 2021 season postponed to the start of this year due to the pandemic, NRLW players are backing up only four months after they finished last season to do it all again. It may seem jarring, but for the players the short turnaround is a small price to pay for another season on the field and the increasing professionalism of the game. With the postponed Rugby League World Cup taking place in England just a few weeks after the end of this year\u2019s second NRLW season, there is an extra layer of intrigue as the increased talent pool competes for Jillaroos places.  Although progress in the professionalisation of women\u2019s sport has not yet resulted in equality between the men\u2019s and women\u2019s codes, Australia\u2019s relatively early investment in women\u2019s rugby league will be notable in the upcoming World Cup. The last tournament was held in 2017 \u2013 before the first season of the NRLW was played. The Jillaroos were dominant, going through undefeated, at a time when none of their players were competing in a professional domestic competition. After five seasons of the NRLW, their dominance could soon become devastating. A similar pattern has been seen in cricket, where Australia made early investment in the professionalisation of domestic and international players. Coming into the eighth season of the Women\u2019s Big Bash League, the Australian team\u2019s dominance on the international stage is yet to be reeled in. This is the trail that the NRLW is just beginning to blaze \u2013 one that creates an almost unbeatable legacy and forces other countries to take their women\u2019s competitions seriously in order to even begin to dismantle Australia\u2019s dominance.  This past season highlighted the maturity of the competition, putting the foundations in place for this legacy to eventuate. For the first time the Brisbane Broncos not only missed out on the premiership, but failed to even qualify for the grand final. The increase to six teams succeeded in creating a more even talent spread, although two of the new teams in particular \u2013 the Newcastle Knights and Parramatta Eels \u2013 were not as competitive as the more established teams.  However, after a season to settle into the competition and some key movements between clubs, the upcoming season looks set to be the closest yet. With joint Dally M winner Millie Boyle and star fullback Tamika Upton leaving the Broncos for the Knights, the Novocastrians have immediately acquired a lot more speed, power and momentum that may propel them into finals contention. The Eels have been a little quieter on the recruitment front, but a pair of cross-code athletes have stirred up some excitement in their preseason. Gayle Broughton comes into the NRLW as a rookie, but at 26 years old and with Olympic gold and silver medals in rugby sevens to her name, she is far from inexperienced. Brooke Walker meanwhile will enter her third professional sport. Walker has represented Australia in sevens and is also currently contracted to Carlton in the AFLW, in an incredibly rare straddling of the Barassi Line.   The most anticipated clash of the season \u2013 the grand final rematch between the Roosters and the Dragons \u2013 has had an extra layer of excitement added as the NRL announced last week that the round three match will be shifted from Leichhardt Oval to become the first match played at the new Allianz Stadium as part of a double header with a men\u2019s match between the Roosters and South Sydney Rabbitohs.  It is an exciting opportunity for the players to break new ground, but it has left many fans of the women\u2019s game disappointed, as tickets for the men\u2019s match were already sold out before the NRLW venue change was announced. A relatively early Friday evening start time of 5:40pm means there is some work to be done at NRL headquarters to ensure the crowd is encouraged to arrive early for what is likely to be an enthralling contest. With the competition set to increase to 10 teams in 2023, there is little doubt this second 2022 season will be captivating. The teams will be eyeing off this season as their best chance to win a premiership \u2013 before the four new teams enter the arena and begin snaffling talent. While professional women\u2019s rugby league is still in its early stages, the contests over the next seven weeks will pave the way for that enduring legacy that has the potential to shape the international game for years to come."

                    "body": "This was not how Gareth Southgate had envisaged the start of the countdown to the Qatar World Cup. On a night when more than 30,000 Hungarian schoolchildren massed into this boisterous arena, blowing their vuvuzelas, making a screeching din from start to finish, England produced one of their worst performances for some time. They had entered this Nations League opener \u2013 nominally to be played behind closed doors because of the bad behaviour of Hungary fans during Euro 2020 but with kids allowed under a Uefa loophole and lots of them \u2013 boasting an intimidating record. Eighteen wins in 22 matches and only one defeat \u2013 on penalties to Italy in last summer\u2019s Euro final.  But Southgate\u2019s team were strangely passive, lacking bite in the areas that mattered, especially the final third, and they came to threaten too late, playing with the bit between their teeth only after they fell behind to Dominik Szoboszlai\u2019s 66th minute penalty. The award was soft \u2013 rather like England up to that point \u2013 but it was correct and punishment for a moment of clumsiness from Reece James, who had only just entered as a substitute. James touched a cross back towards his goalkeeper, Jordan Pickford, and worried that he had not put enough on it. And so he stepped across Zsolt Nagy to make sure that the Hungary wing-back could not give chase. Nagy went down theatrically and England had a sinking feeling. Szoboszlai once told Neymar before he took a penalty that he never missed and his conversion here, dragged low into the bottom corner, bristled with conviction. To tremendous acclaim, Hungary were on their way to a first win over England since 1962. England had flirted with problems during a first half in which they were second best and, although they pressed hard on to the front foot after the goal, they could not find a way back. The margin of defeat might have been heavier had Andras Schafer not blazed high with the goal gaping on 81 minutes. The chance came after the substitute Laszlo Kleinheisler had sashayed past Harry Maguire with ease before seeing a shot parried by Pickford. England have only five more matches before their opening tie against Iran in Qatar on 21 November, with the next of them coming against Germany in Munich on Tuesday night. They will need to play with a good deal more cohesion against their old rivals. England had met Hungary twice before this season in World Cup qualification, at this venue when a 4-0 win was overshadowed by racist chants from the home crowd and in a 1-1 draw at Wembley, when Hungary showed how difficult they can be to break down. They came to play here, eager at the outset to exploit the spaces behind England\u2019s wing-backs, Trent Alexander-Arnold and James Justin, who toiled defensively on his debut and was taken off at half-time. Alexander-Arnold looked OK when facing forward; less so in the other direction.  Hungary almost made the dream start. Addressing a high diagonal from left to right, Loic Nego volleyed over a sumptuous first-time ball, low along the corridor of uncertainty behind England\u2019s back line, and it was made to measure for Szoboszlai. Out flew Pickford and he certainly spooked Szoboszlai, who could only prod past him with little power. The ball trickled goalwards but Conor Coady was able to get back and swipe clear. The tone had been unusual, to say the least, before kick-off, with England emerging to boos for their warm-up, albeit the pitch of them rather squeakier than normal. What would happen when England took the knee? In the controversial fixture here last September, the anti-racism gesture had been met with ear-splitting whistles. Here, incredibly, there was another round of boos. Nego was a menace before the interval. The right wing-back almost picked out Roland Sallai in the opening quarter, the forward having drifted clear of Alexander-Arnold, but he could not make a decisive contact and it would not be the last time that Nego worried England with the weight and flight of his deliveries. England were too open in the defensive transitions in the first half, offering Hungary hope. Szoboszlai sent Zsolt Nagy galloping clear of Alexander-Arnold on the half hour and the wing-back made Pickford save. There was also a heart-stopping moment for the goalkeeper shortly afterwards. Hungary won the ball high up and, when it broke to Adam Szalai just inside the England half, he saw Pickford off his line and went for the spectacular. It looked as though he had pulled it off only for the long-range lob to veer off target at the last.  England lacked punch. Jarrod Bowen was a willing runner off the right on his debut and, after seeing an early effort blocked by Attila Szalai, his eyes lit up when Alexander-Arnold picked him out with a cross from the right. Bowen fluffed the side-on volley. Coady headed high from an Alexander-Arnold corner while Mason Mount could not finish from a Harry Kane cross. Bukayo Saka, on for Justin, had a nice moment when he glided away from two red shirts to work Peter Gulasci from a tight angle and England pushed after the penalty. Bowen sent a second side-on volley at the goalkeeper, the disappointing Jude Bellingham had an effort blocked and Coady headed narrowly wide from a set piece. At the end, Kane shot weakly when he might have squared for the substitute Jack Grealish. England had come up short."

                    "body": "Juventus have approached Chelsea about signing Timo Werner on loan. The Germany striker has struggled since joining Chelsea from RB Leipzig for \u00a347.5m two years ago and was criticised by Thomas Tuchel after airing his frustrations in public last week.  Werner, who has scored 23 goals in 89 appearances since moving to Stamford Bridge, has been unable to establish himself as a regular starter under Tuchel and is available this summer. However Chelsea could struggle to sell the striker because of his wages, which are worth around \u00a3275,000 a week. A loan deal could be more feasible if Werner is to leave Chelsea. Leipzig and Newcastle have both been linked with the 26-year-old striker, who wants to play more before the World Cup later this year, while Juventus are interested in him. Juve have identified Werner as an alternative option if they fail to sign \u00c1lvaro Morata from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. It would arguably be a gamble for Chelsea to part company with Werner. They have already loaned Romelu Lukaku to Internazionale and have a shortage of conventional strikers in their squad. However Tuchel, who has signed Raheem Sterling from Manchester City, has made it clear he wants to alter his attack. He was critical of Chelsea\u2019s lack of bite in the final third after their 4-0 friendly defeat against Arsenal last weekend. Chelsea, who fear that the Sevilla centre-back Jules Kound\u00e9 is set to snub them for Barcelona, are also trying to improve their defence. They are interested in the Internazionale right wing-back Denzel Dumfries. They could also make a move for the Inter centre-back Milan Skriniar."

                    "body": "CRUEL SUMMER Hello readers. It\u2019s Monday 13 June, the sun is shining, the bees are buzzing, the sound of leather on willow is ringing around local parks and *Fiver checks fixture list* the football season still hasn\u2019t effing finished! Yes, by the time you read this, Kazakhstan v Slovakia will be seamlessly rolling into Azerbaijan v Belarus in a Nations League C3 double-header whose main use appears to be helping us fill our word count. There are more matches later on too but, to be honest with you, we\u2019re about as keen to check them as England and Italy players appeared to be about entertaining a crowd of 2,000 schoolchildren at Molineux on Saturday. That tired and tepid encounter predictably ended 0-0, the highlight of which was the high-pitched booing at full-time \u2013 proof that the next generation of English crowds with a sense of entitlement is safe and well. \u201cThere\u2019s been a little bit of a lack of sharpness in [attacking] areas across the three matches,\u201d sniffed Gareth Southgate afterwards, as his groaning players crawled back to their beds to prepare for another game against Hungary. To be fair to Southgate and other sensible managers around Europe, some overworked squad members have not been force-fed the overcooked four-course Nations League meal. But in a year when the domestic European season is kicking off early to clear space for a controversial World Cup earmarked as a winter edition for just the seven long years, Uefa might have thought harder about how to schedule its most pointless tournament [yeah, we\u2019re actually digging Tin Pot \u2013 Fiver Ed]. Mind you, some of their bigwigs do tend to go missing when they have important things to sort out.  \u201cIt\u2019s bonkers,\u201d fumed Wales manager Rob Page when asked about the schedule. \u201cA lot of our players are from the Championship as well, which is a demanding division to play in [don\u2019t tell Gareth Bale \u2013 Fiver Ed]. It has caught up with us, so there are no surprises we have picked up a few knocks,\u201d he added, as Joe Allen\u2019s hamstring continued to twang around the Wales training camp. Page then suggested an idea for Qatar that will help reduce the workload on players and aid their welfare \u2026 so expect Fifa to shrug it off. \u201cI would like a 26-man squad,\u201d he reasoned. With average temperatures in Qatar expected to be a sizzling 29 degrees, he should have suggested 10-minute ice-pop breaks, too.At least Scotland have got it right. Despite having used the Nations League as a sneaky doorway into Euro Not 2020, they appear to have mentally packed their bags and gone on holiday some time in the past week and Steve Clarke is having none of the criticism that has come his players\u2019 way for appearing missing in action during the 3-0 defeat by Republic O\u2019Ireland. \u201cI back these players 100% \u2013 they\u2019ve been fantastic for the country,\u201d roared Clarke, while smearing himself with sun cream and perching a knotted hanky on his bonce.

QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cA lot of people said: \u2018When you stop football it\u2019ll be hard. You\u2019ll be in depression.\u2019 But actually I\u2019m more happy than ever. I\u2019m free. I\u2019m not in that box. I can do everything. If I want to be serious, if I want to be a clown, if I want to motivate people. This is life. I can be whoever I am\u201d \u2013 Patrice Evra talks to Shanti Das about life after football, suffering sexual abuse as a child and his work to protect children from harm.

                    "body": "PUTTING AN OLD SPIN ON THINGS\nBig Vase is a most missable feast. After a week of Super Sunday, the Real Monday Night Football (Keys &amp; Gray version, natch) and two nights of Big Cup VAR controversy, The Fiver sloped off for a Thursday night down the Salt Tears Arms, allowing its new-fangled smartphone\u2019s alerts to take the strain. Arsenal lost at PSV. Mildly interesting. Manchester United beat FC Sheriff 3-0. Ho hum. How might the self-styled world\u2019s foremost content delivery machine seize the social media disgrace agenda from that one? And go, as they say, viral. The answer lay not in Cristiano Ronaldo scoring, but instead Antony boarding the showboat in a manner Darcey Bussell would have been proud of before she hung up her slippers.\nThe clock had ticked past the 37th minute and Big Red were still level with the crack Moldovan outfit when Casemiro played the ball rightwards to his compatriot. With Sheriff defender Patrick Kpozo watching in the style of Indiana Jones and that marketplace swordsman, Antony did three 360s, like Tony Hawk in lightweight Pumas, while caressing the ball with his right foot. He then hooked a pass towards Casemiro that didn\u2019t reach its target. Spectacular stuff but not because of Antony reviving the ghosts of Garrincha\u2019s bow-legged wizardry, Denilson\u2019s lollipops and Kerlon\u2019s seal dribble. No, it was left to the grim-faced Football Men to provide the real entertainment. \u201cRidiculous,\u201d wailed Robbie Savage. \u201cEmbarrassing. He puts the ball out of play.\u201d\n\nSavage appeared to ignore that had Casemiro, 57, run a bit faster then he might have got on the end of a decent attempt at a through pass. But summary judgment had been delivered; now was the time for old pros to sermonise. \u201cI just don\u2019t think it\u2019s skill or entertainment, it\u2019s just being a clown,\u201d harrumphed Paul Scholes, football punditry\u2019s answer to Percy Sugden, probably recalling memories of Nani pratting about as Lord Ferg\u2019s face went redder than Peter Schmeichel\u2019s tig that time Nicky Butt burned it with the tea urn.\nErik ten Hag, settling well into the role of puritanical disciplinarian, having shown Ronaldo who\u2019s boss, wasn\u2019t too happy. But neither was he too fussed. \u201cI have no problem with that as long as it is functional,\u201d he shrugged. \u201cBut if it\u2019s a trick because of a trick, then I will correct him.\u201d The new King Erik has become rather adept at taking the steam out of the type of farrago that did for every post-Ferg United boss. As for Antony? \u201cWe\u2019re known for our art and I won\u2019t stop doing what got me to where I am,\u201d he trilled on Instachat. Good news for all those who\u2019d like to see him dance again.\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\n\u201cFor many people from under-represented or minority communities, much of the last 50 years has been a depressing cycle of promises, raised hopes and disappointment. Football is at a crucial point and needs to make the right choices so the Football Leadership Diversity Code does not become the latest entry in a 50-year catalogue of missed opportunities\u201d \u2013 Kick It Out chair Sanjay Bhandari responds to the news that English clubs have failed to meet six of their eight diversity targets.\n\nRECOMMENDED VOTING\nBig Website is shortlisted in the upcoming FSA Awards, along with David Squires, Suzanne Wrack, Barney Ronay and Football Weekly. If you want to lend them your vote, you can do so here.\nRECOMMENDED LISTENING\nThe latest Football Weekly Extra podcast is right here, right now.\nFIVER LETTERS\n\u201cI\u2019m here to affirm that I won\u2019t be watching the Human Rights World Cup, and though I won\u2019t judge anyone for doing so, I encourage dear readers to skip it as well. I love football. I think it can be such a force for good, for bringing people together. To see it corrupted by rank and corrupt capitalism hurts my heart \u2026 not to mention the human toll which is exponentially larger than any tragedies we\u2019ve seen before in the game. Perspective\u201d \u2013 Jason Palivoda.\n\n\u201cRe: yesterday\u2019s Fiver. All this \u2018VAR is ruining the game\u2019 nonsense simply because the correct result, decided within the laws of the game, led to a conclusion that wasn\u2019t popular with partisan fans is leading me to wonder whether punters and pundits think VAR is like a test screening for a movie. Like when they kill the dog at the end and the audience vote to keep it alive. Maybe there should be \u2018ask the audience\u2019 or \u2018choose your ending\u2019 in real time, or we can introduce a post-match CGI download for season-ticket holders: enter the multi-var-se. The bean counters can also start changing some other historical facts we are unhappy with for the sake of entertainment, like Maradona \u201886 or Russia \u201818 or the last Tory leadership battle when Truss beat Sunak. OK, maybe VAR got that last one right\u201d \u2013 Brian James.\n\u201cFar be it from me to tell The Fiver what its priorities should be, but enough already of the HRWC, Antonio Conte\u2019s tantrums and some Italian club that doesn\u2019t win anything. How about investing a bit more time in Southend United, now languishing in the National League and facing the parent company being struck off yet again, under an embargo yet again and waiting 20 years or more for a new stadium which will only have three sides to it and be built in the middle of a housing estate. That\u2019s real drama compared to some of the Premier League antics you devote so much space to\u201d \u2013 Gerry Stonestreet.\n\u201cI laughed while reading The Fiver yesterday! Imagine, real laughter! Admittedly it was just at Matt Leonard\u2019s suggestion (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters) that The Fiver was good 20 years ago, but still \u2026\u201d \u2013 Colum Farrelly.\nSend your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.

                    "body": "Rachel Furness is unequivocal. \u201cIf, 10 years ago, you\u2019d told me Windsor Park would sell out for a women\u2019s international, I\u2019d have laughed,\u201d says Northern Ireland\u2019s midfield playmaker. \u201cI\u2019d have said you were joking but qualifying for the Euros has worked wonders.\u201d So much so that a record crowd of 15,348 gathered in Belfast in April to see Kenny Shiels\u2019s side lose 5-0 to England in a World Cup qualifier. Undeterred by a somewhat chastening second half, locals offered Furness and her teammates a resounding ovation as, after the final whistle, Ben E King\u2019s classic Stand by Me boomed out of Windsor Park\u2019s sound system.  No one turned on a team who, against all odds, had already qualified for their first major tournament and now await a Euro 2022 group stage reunion with England in Southampton. Although Northern Ireland are tipped for swift elimination, the legacy of their involvement seems set to be transformational. \u201cWe\u2019ve waited a long time for this tournament,\u201d says Furness. \u201cBut, since qualifying, the infrastructure off the pitch has improved massively, interest in women\u2019s football is increasing and the numbers playing have risen. The uplift\u2019s been tremendous. Qualifying\u2019s really raised the bar.\u201d With most of the squad part-timers Furness, a professional with newly promoted WSL side Liverpool, reports that \u201cit helps massively\u201d that most of Shiels\u2019s players have taken seven-month sabbaticals from day jobs to train full-time. \u201cWe\u2019re under no illusions, we\u2019ve got a gap to bridge,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we\u2019ve learnt a lot in recent months. There\u2019s been a massive improvement in fitness levels and technical standards.\u201d Shiels, meanwhile, has learnt who his friends are. Following that 5-0 defeat against England Northern Ireland\u2019s coach ill-advisedly suggested female footballers were \u201cmore emotional\u201d than their male counterparts and, despite the 66-year-old swiftly apologising, a media furore erupted. \u201cKenny\u2019s comments were blown out of all proportion, we\u2019re all fully behind him,\u201d says Furness. \u201cWe can all make mistakes with wording but without Kenny I wouldn\u2019t be sitting here, talking to you and preparing for my first major tournament.\u201d  Indeed since his appointment in 2019 Northern Ireland have improved almost beyond recognition. \u201cKenny\u2019s changed the women\u2019s game here,\u201d she continues. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of tough times in the past but he\u2019s really raised standards and brought us very much together. The difference in this team from before Kenny took over and now is like night and day.\u201d Furness remains friendly with several England players including Lucy Bronze, Jill Scott and Demi Stokes with whom she once played at Sunderland. \u201cIt\u2019s always nice to catch up with them,\u201d she says. \u201cThe north-east\u2019s an often forgotten part of England where people have to fight for everything; it\u2019s no coincidence it\u2019s produced so many top, really high-quality players. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing Euro 2022 games aren\u2019t being staged in Newcastle and Sunderland; I do think the organisers have missed a trick.\u201d Despite being north-east born and bred, and possessing the accent to prove it, Furness feels \u201c100%\u201d Northern Irish and harbours a powerful sense of connection to Belfast, her mother\u2019s birthplace. \u201cMy mum\u2019s very proud,\u201d says the brightest star in Shiels\u2019 firmament. Her family appreciate how hard she worked to not only become Northern Ireland\u2019s record goalscorer with 38 in 84 appearances at the time of writing, but to be playing at all following two major knee operations. Things started going wrong at 16. \u201cThe cartilage began crumbling and my knee kept exploding,\u201d Furness recalls. \u201cMy surgeon wasn\u2019t a sports specialist and he said I should stop playing football as, if I continued, I\u2019d need a knee replacement by the time I was 30. \u201cFor a while I stopped. It was very tough, both my mental and physical health suffered and I became really unfit. Eventually, though, I started going to the gym and playing again to try and get healthy but my knee kept exploding.\u201d  Assorted physiotherapy regimes later it improved to the point where she joined Newcastle. \u201cAt first I kept breaking down but I finally got back to a high level,\u201d says a forward turned midfielder who subsequently played for Grindavik in Iceland before rejoining Sunderland ahead of stints with Reading and Tottenham. \u201cBut then my other knee broke down.\u201d Furness\u2019s new specialist fixed the problem before inquiring how long she wanted her career to continue. \u201cI said maybe until I\u2019m 30 or 31 and he thought that was realistic,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m 34 now so I really do play every game knowing it might be my last.\u201d"

                    "body": "Wow. It was 7.57pm in Qatar, just before 6pm in Casablanca, when Facundo Tello blew the final whistle, delivering a delirious signal for the men on the sideline to finally let loose and stream on to the pitch, and for those who were already there to collapse on to the floor. They had done it, these Atlas Lions. Legends now, the roar tore right through everyone here and way, way beyond. History is made and it is made of this. Morocco are the first African team to make it to a World Cup semi-final.\n\nWalid Regragui\u2019s team have faced Belgium, Croatia, Spain and now Portugal, but they are made of granite. None could tumble them, the task before France now. In eight and a half hours of football \u2013 plus three penalties in a shootout \u2013 no opposition player has scored against them: the only time they conceded they scored it themselves, a freak own goal against Canada. Here, Portugal fielded the forward who scored a hat-trick against Switzerland and then asked Cristiano Ronaldo to rescue them from the bench, to no avail. Ronaldo disappeared down the tunnel in tears. This may be his last match.\n\nIt will not be Morocco\u2019s. Ronaldo got one chance in the 91st minute, his moment seemingly arriving right on time, but Bono saved, as he has so often. Pepe got an even clearer one but his close-range header somehow flashed past a post in the 97th minute, a kind of scream accompanying the ball as it went, and Morocco wrote another page of this story \u2013 even without the substitute Walid Cheddira, who was sent off in the final minutes.\nResisting is something Morocco do so well but do not think it is all they do: this is a team worthy of their place in the semi-final and in history, as well as the wild scenes that accompanied the end here. Ultimately one goal was enough, yet the simplicity of that statement should not suggest that Youssef En-Nesyri\u2019s header in the 42nd minute was all there was. The myth of Morocco\u2019s defensiveness should be laid to rest.\n\nYes, they start from deep, dashing through, but they do not just wait to run \u2013 they work for the chance to do so. They have a clarity and an incision few teams have, picking their way past tiny gaps, exchanging passes and streaming into the daylight, the midfield not a place to stop but to sprint right through. The last time they did just that, with the clock running down, the right-back Achraf Hakimi went sprinting into Portugal\u2019s six-yard box. What an exceptional player he is, and he is not alone. Fiorentina\u2019s Sofyan Amrabat and Azzedine Ounahi, who is fighting relegation with Angers in France, have constantly outplayed supposedly more illustrious footballers. In Sofiane Boufal and Hakim Ziyech they have lovely feet, two superb escapologists.\n\nSo while a Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix diving header was saved by Bono after just four minutes and he had a deflected attempt that momentarily looked like it had gone in, it was Morocco who had the better chances. En-Nesyri headed high after a run from Boufal, and Ounahi set up Ziyech for a shot before En-Nesyri saw a second effort go over. Yahia Attiyat Allah then pulled back perfectly for Selim Amallah to scuff high and wide.\nThen it happened. The cross from the left, delivered by Attiyat Allah, was long and looping, but En-Nesyri jumped like Jordan. Diogo Costa, diving lower and to the left, misjudged the flight. Still in the air when he realised the ball would not reach him, he fell with a look on his face that said: where has it gone? The answer was into the net, En-Nesyri\u2019s header bouncing back up off the turf.\n\nAlthough Bruno Fernandes smashed a bouncing ball off the bar and then appealed for a penalty \u2013 he had gone to ground too easily upon feeling Hakimi\u2019s hand on his shoulder \u2013 Morocco continued to create more. Ounahi rolled it into Attiyat Allah, the ball begging to be finished but instead the left-back horribly sliced his shot. A free-kick then somehow failed to slip in at the far post with three men in attendance. And another sharp dash saw the pitch open again only for Ounahi to sky his shot.\nBy then Ronaldo was on, the stage seemingly set. Instead, the first opportunity came to Gon\u00e7alo Ramos who headed wide from a position the No 7 would have loved before Bruno Fernandes\u2019s effort flew just over. \nThis was Ronaldo\u2019s 196th international, equalling the Fifa record; preventing him adding to his 118 goals was made harder by the forced departure of a third member of that back four, Romain Sa\u00efss withdrawn. It was time to resist, which did not stop another superb five-man stampede, the break finally dying at the feet of Cheddira. It did not stop them doing it again even later, in fact.\n\nFaced by a red wall Portugal struggled, Ronaldo teeing up F\u00e9lix seven minutes from time. Bono flew to tip that over and a moment later saved Ronaldo\u2019s low shot, perhaps the forward\u2019s last act with Portugal. Remarkably, Morocco had one more chance before Pepe\u2019s header, Zakaria Aboukhlal sent clean through only to dink a shot straight at Costa. \nThat felt like the kind of moment that fate punishes you for, cruelty inevitably coming, but Morocco are made of something else. They held on with just 10 men \u2013 and an entire continent."

                    "body": "When the final whistle went at the end of extra time, I pressed send on my on-the-whistle match report, put my face in my hands and sobbed. Big, loud, heart-rending, back-arching sobs. It was not the first time I had cried around the Lionesses\u2019 stunning, swaggering run to a first major tournament trophy and I have not really stopped since.  It is hard to articulate just how much this victory means to me. When I started writing about women\u2019s football there was no full-time work available at any national newspaper for those wanting to cover the game. I was asked to write a weekly column for the Guardian in 2017, on the eve of the Euros, at which Sarina Wiegman would guide the Netherlands to a home win. The headline on my first column? \u201cEngland\u2019s Euros adventure can deliver glory abroad and lasting impact at home\u201d. My first interview? With Laura Bassett, the scorer of England\u2019s devastating late own goal in the World Cup semi-final in 2015 in Canada, who was heading to the Euros without a club after the collapse of Notts County. Fast forward and, 1,093 articles later, I have just watched the game I have given everything to build \u2013 and that I care about very deeply \u2013 have a moment that will transform it and in turn the resources and paid work available for covering it. Incredibly, it does not feel as if we are at the summit but at base camp, ready to roll, with all the equipment needed to reach the top. There are people who have been pioneering this game far longer than I have \u2013 on and off the pitch. I came in as minds were starting to shift in the industry. I could sight potential openings; not that it was ever about that. Trying to fathom the feelings of Tony Leighton, Jen O\u2019Neill and Cath Etoe, who are among those who have covered the women\u2019s game for decades, when Leah Williamson lifted the trophy on Sunday is impossible. They very much had a hand on the trophy too, as did so many others \u2013 I, perhaps, can claim a fingernail. Every journalist covering a football team \u2013 men\u2019s or women\u2019s \u2013 gets to know the players and staff. We sit down with them and delve into their stories, sometimes asking deeply personal questions about their state of mind, feelings, tragedies, health and failures. You connect with many, with their stories, their passion, their unerring desire to push themselves to be the best. In women\u2019s football the players tell their stories freely, knowing that fans who connect with them may engage with the game and its journey to the front and back pages.  I have spoken to Chloe Kelly about the ACL injury that ruled her out of the Olympics, to Keira Walsh about how she wanted to quit football after the 2019 World Cup, to a tear-stained Ellen White after Team GB crashed out of the Olympics in extra time, at the quarter-final stage, her hat-trick not enough to earn victory over Australia. The list goes on. Had the men\u2019s team won last summer, or should they go one step further at the World Cup in Qatar, I imagine many journalists who have covered the team for decades will have their emotions turned upside down in similar and different ways. We work late nights, long days and have many more unglamorous hours than Instagram-worthy ones. It is, of course, all worth it. Women\u2019s football is decades, if not a century, behind the development of the men\u2019s game. At the moment it is still very, very reliant on and invested in an engaged media to help it grow. Of course the men\u2019s game needs the press too, to maintain its deep stamp on society, but the fledgling nature of the women\u2019s game prompts far greater openness from players and managers who recognise the importance of a reciprocal relationship \u2013 we grow it and them; it grows us. So while tears and cheering in the press box may be unfamiliar, slightly frowned upon or seen as a little unprofessional, forgive those of us who were broken by events on Sunday. We know what this means for our jobs, our industry, the players, the game and for society more generally. Football is powerful and the broader impact of it \u2018coming home\u2019 thanks to a group of young women cannot be underestimated.  There are lots of people raising warnings, saying the opportunity to develop this wonderful sport off the back of this historic win and moment cannot be missed. They are right. Of course they are. But if there is one thing I know, it is that the people saying these things, the players on the pitch, the staff at clubs, the former players still championing the game, will not let the moment pass without a fight. The FA banned women\u2019s football for 50 years, tried to smash the game out of existence, but those in charge back in 19 21 failed. Instead they made sure that the most gutsy group of fighters would emerge to champion the game and grow it generation by generation. That was a group of educated, intelligent, physical, resilient and brilliant women, who would give anything, and have given everything, to see this sport succeed. A group who have given everything to see all girls have the right to play a game that has formed so much of who they are on and off the pitch and developed them as people and as important members of society in ways they could never imagine."

                    "body": "Everton\u2019s new signing Conor Coady has pledged to \u201chelp the club move forward\u201d after completing a season-long loan move from Wolves. Bruno Lage sanctioned the temporary exit of his captain to allow him to play regular football in the buildup to the World Cup. Everton will have an option to buy the England centre-back at the end of the season. Wolves, meanwhile, have made the Valencia forward Gon\u00e7alo Guedes their second summer signing in a \u00a327.5m deal. Coady, a product of Liverpool\u2019s academy, will bolster Everton\u2019s defensive options after Ben Godfrey fractured his leg in the 1-0 defeat to Chelsea on Saturday. Coady started every Premier League game for Wolves last season but was among the substitutes as they began the campaign with a defeat at Leeds at the weekend. The 29-year-old is a hugely popular figure at Molineux and Bruno Lage was happy to keep the defender, but he departs with the head coach\u2019s blessing.  Coady is a victim of Lage\u2019s decision to shift his tactics during the close-season and opt for a back four, preferring Nathan Collins \u2013 a \u00a320.5m summer arrival from Burnley \u2013 and Max Kilman in a two-man central defence. Coady has played in a back five for the majority of his time at Wolves, whom he joined from Huddersfield in 2015. Everton tend to operate with a back five and Coady could slot in alongside Yerry Mina and James Tarkowski, another summer signing. Meanwhile, Frank Lampard has confirmed the 20-year-old midfielder Amadou Onana is set to sign from Lille. On Friday Lage described Coady as \u201cone of the best people I know in football\u201d. He added: \u201cSince Wolves arrived in the Premier League do you know how many games they played? 152. You know how many games Coady played? 151. With me he played all the games. Massive respect from me to Coady and massive respect from the club to Coady. Now I have more solutions and I will choose the best for my team, but I cannot forget Coady.\u201d Guedes has been capped 32 times by Portugal and his arrival is a welcome boost to a Wolves team short on attacking options. Last season they were the lowest scorers in the league outside the relegation zone, despite finishing 10th. Guedes, who started his career at Benfica, scored 11 league goals in La Liga last season. Wolves remain without first-choice striker Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez, last season\u2019s top scorer, who will be absent for at least another month with a knee injury. Meanwhile, Adama Traor\u00e9 is sidelined with a hamstring problem. Wolves intend to keep Morgan Gibbs-White amid serious interest from Nottingham Forest, who have had three bids rejected for the midfielder and remain keen on the player."

                    "body": "Some regular seasons end with a bang, offering an explosion of colour and sound that underlines a campaign well fought and serves as a platform for greater prizes in the playoffs. Others sparkle with the intensity of a toddler\u2019s birthday candle, proving as enticing as spit-covered cake. The 24th and final league match for Leicester and Wasps fell in the latter category. It was error strewn and bereft of show-stopping moments. \u201cClunky,\u201d was the word Leicester\u2019s head coach, Steve Borthwick, used. Even a boring rugby match \u2013 and this one might well be described in such terms \u2013 is filled with big hits and enthusiastic runs, so those don\u2019t deserve mention here. What is worth noting is that Leicester\u2019s full-strength team failed to get out of second gear while Wasps missed a chance to sneak into next year\u2019s Champions Cup. Both sets of coaches will be annoyed by something when they wake up on Sunday.  It looked so promising at first. Two minutes in, Leicester had the feed to a lineout inside Wasps\u2019 22. It went to the back and was quickly fizzed to George Ford in midfield. A short pass found Guy Porter on the angle who brushed off two inept tackles and rounded a flat-footed Paolo Odogwu to score under the posts. Ford\u2019s conversion was good and another mauling at the hands of the Tigers was on the cards. What followed was below par for a team with title aspirations. They conceded a penalty while in possession of a driving maul and another with the put-in to a scrum. Later, a throw from Charlie Clare sailed clear over his jumpers. When Ollie Chessum gave away a penalty in the maul, Borthwick berated him from the gantry, prowling and snarling like a caged Bengal, grinding his teeth and daring anyone to make eye contact with him. Ford\u2019s miss at a regulation shot at goal summed up the preceding 38 minutes. Wasps battled but looked like a side that belongs in Europe\u2019s second tier. Passes and offloads were either fumbled or found nothing but air. They attacked the gainline and had a few breaks though those came to nothing. The half-time whistle arrived as a mercy with one try the difference. Wasps restarted as the brighter and spent the opening 10 minutes in Leicester\u2019s red-zone but were repelled with relative comfort. Jimmy Gopperth opened his team\u2019s account with a penalty, begrudgingly taking the points. The first burst of sunshine on the hour mark heralded a charge from Ellis Genge from first-phase ball. He carried up the middle and put Leicester on the front foot and within sight of a try they would eventually secure through a diving Freddie Steward \u2013 one of the few shining lights \u2013 who was unleashed by Mat\u00edas Moroni on the right off the back of sustained pressure.  A Ford penalty opened a 14-point lead and effectively ended the contest, consigning Wasps to their worst league finish in 10 years, a damning contradiction to the assertion from the club\u2019s head coach, Lee Blackett, who said that his side was \u201cmoving in the right direction\u201d. Replacement Will Porter scored a try after a breakout of slick interplay on the left that included Josh Bassett wriggling out of a confined space in his own half.  Ford\u2019s second penalty ensured Leicester signed off on top of the table, a position they have occupied from the opening weekend. Despite ending with 40 more points than they earned last year, they have not won anything yet. They will need to rediscover their accuracy in the coming weeks if they wish to change that."

                    "body": "Eleven years ago Gareth Bale, Aaron Ramsey and Wayne Hennessey walked off the pitch at Cardiff City Stadium after a 2-1 friendly defeat by Australia in front of a crowd of 6,373, some of whom resorted to sarcastic cheers. On the face of it, it was hardly the worst result but it was a seventh defeat in eight and, more pertinently, it plunged the team to a record low of 117th in the Fifa rankings, sandwiched between Haiti and Grenada. If it was an unedifying sight for supporters to see Wales slip below Guatemala, the Faroe Islands and Mozambique, it should make qualifying for a first World Cup for 64 years all the more satisfying, if not surreal. Bale captained Wales to what he called the country\u2019s greatest result against Ukraine, Ramsey went the distance in midfield and the 35-year-old Hennessey, who made two Premier League starts for relegated Burnley in the 2021-22 season, made nine saves \u2013 with arguably the best saved for last to deny Artem Dovbyk \u2013 in trying conditions. It was fitting that Bale and Hennessey, who have been inseparable since playing together for Wales\u2019 under-21s and will continue their journey on the biggest stage in November, shared the moment, which Robert Page dedicated to the late Gary Speed, who was nine months in the job in August 2011.  Those senior Wales players, as well as Joe Allen and Chris Gunter, the first Welshman to win a century of caps, have, to use Bale\u2019s words, found the final piece of the jigsaw. Page said Wales were reaping the rewards of the professionalism and identity instilled by Speed, who had targeted reaching the 2014 World Cup after taking over from John Toshack. \u201cGary\u2019s words and his plan was all based around getting to a World Cup,\u201d says the former Wales midfielder Owain Tudur Jones, an unused substitute that day against Australia. \u201cHe had so many goals he wanted to achieve, short term and long term. It has taken a little bit longer than planned but it is almost as if that waiting has made it feel so much better. It is a beautiful thing that there are still players involved in the squad that would have been in those meetings with Tosh originally and certainly with Gary. Those players have been carrying him in their hearts since he passed away.\u201d It was no surprise that Hennessey and Bale, golf partners for four-balls, roommates and chief pranksters, pitched up together long after the final whistle to put into words the scale of their achievement, with Bale particularly effusive in his praise for Hennessey, describing his display as the \u201cbest I\u2019ve ever seen by a goalkeeper\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s been a crazy journey from where we were to qualify for two European Championships and a World Cup,\u201d Bale says. \u201cIt\u2019s literally what dreams are made of, especially for all of us who have been there from the start. We\u2019ve paved the way for the youngsters as well, we\u2019ve welcomed them in and it\u2019s hard to describe what it means to us. We always fight for each other.\u201d  Page believes football has overtaken rugby as the national sport. \u201cWhen I was growing up in Tylorstown, playing rugby was the thing to do, not football, but I think the tides have turned now and I think football has become our No 1 sport,\u201d says Page, who, like Jimmy Murphy, who led Wales to the quarter-finals of the 1958 World Cup, grew up in the Rhondda Valley. \u201cWe\u2019ll always be known for rugby, of course, but this is massive, this is monumental what we have done in qualifying for a World Cup. People like Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey, those senior players, will go down in history.\u201d Wales put their compassion for Ukraine to one side for almost 98 minutes to reach a second successive major tournament. They are 19 games unbeaten in Cardiff and since their last home defeat, by Denmark in November 2018, when Paul Dummett was at left-back and Tom Lawrence on the left wing, they have conceded seven goals and kept 12 clean sheets on home turf. Their spirit seems unbreakable. \u201cThis togetherness Wales have now was what we were always envious of,\u201d says Tudur Jones. \u201cWe would go to places like Montenegro, a new nation and a good team but you would look at them and think: \u2018How are these better than us? On paper, we\u2019ve got better players.\u2019 I think that was the goal back in the day, to get that mentality we now see. It doesn\u2019t matter what level they\u2019re playing or if they\u2019re playing regularly; collectively we are better than people expect us to be. It has taken a little while but this is what Tosh wanted, it\u2019s what Gary saw and thought was possible and now we\u2019re seeing they were spot on.\u201d  Neville Southall, Hennessey\u2019s goalkeeping hero growing up in Anglesey, has predicted a baby boom as a result of qualification. The giant hoardings on the exterior of the Cardiff City Stadium advertise the \u201ctimeless charm\u201d of Vietnam and the sandy beaches of Malaysia, the country of the Championship club\u2019s owner, Vincent Tan, but there is only one destination on the lips of those with Welsh blood. Most of the Wales squad partied into the early hours of Monday at the Elevens bar in the city centre, which is owned by Bale, who is teetotal. They sang along to Shakira\u2019s Waka Waka, the official World Cup song in 2010, reworking the chorus to: \u201cWe\u2019re going to Qatar.\u201d"

I\u2019ve played Pebble [Beach] a couple of times. I played Cypress Point which is a private members\u2019 club which is next to Pebble Beach \u2013 that was probably the best course I\u2019ve ever played so far.\u201d Thankfully his latest sojourn to the west coast will allow him to tick off a few more of California\u2019s glorious greens and play the odd football match. Yes, after being linked with every man and his dog, Bale has gone with his head to join LAFC in MLS over hometown club Cardiff City once his Real Madrid contract concludes at the end of the month. \u201cHe really wanted to come, the money wasn\u2019t the matter,\u201d sobbed Cardiff owner Vincent Tan. \u201cWe came up with what we thought was a good offer to him, but finally it was very hard to compete when there is a lot of big American advertisers, a lot of commercial deals which were very good for Gareth Bale. We tried our best but we failed.\u201d The winger will lead Wales at the Human Rights World Cup in Qatar and fixtures against the Galaxy, Earthquakes and Wizards will ensure Bale remains in peak physical condition. What better way to prepare for a competition in a country that curtails women\u2019s rights and has a lesser interest in football than playing in the USA! USA!! USA!!!? Bale announced the trade, fittingly enough, in the traditional British holiday attire of baseball cap and football shirt while standing on a golf course. No words were offered, just his heart-shaped hand gesture. Start as you mean to go on, Gareth. The move will allow Bale to add a few more things to the list he has more interest in than Real Madrid. Traffic jams, a lack of public infrastructure, stifling heat and being waited on by out-of-work actors. The Wales fans might need a bigger flag for Qatar.

                    "body": "  12.31pm    Thank you for joining me! Here is Louise Taylor\u2019s match report.      12.20pm    ITV have gone straight into discussing Ghana v Portugal later. Maybe Loose Women will provide the analysis on Switzerland v Cameroon.      12.14pm    Due to the timings of the matches, ITV follow Switzerland v Cameroon with Loose Women. Should I just carry on with a minute-by-minute for that?     12.12pm    Karen Carney on England v USA \u2026      12.05pm    Laura Woods: \u201cYou couldn\u2019t really script it, the boy born in Cameroon scoring the winner.\u201d I respectively referee you to this:      12.03pm    Nigel De Jong: \u201cAt least they scored a goal. I think it was very flat in the second half.\u201d A fair assessment.      12.00pm    It is a tough group to be in, if you are not Brazil. You have to think Cameroon\u2019s chances of getting through a pretty slim after that. I was surprised by how little they went for it in the closing stages.      11.56am   Full time: Switzerland 1-0 Cameroon  Embolo\u2019s makes the difference. The man born in Cameroon has taken them down to make getting out of the group very difficult. Switzerland relied on all their experience to see them through to a deserved victory in a tight game.      11.55am    90+5 mins: Seferovic almost seals it but Castelletto gets back just in time to block the shot from inside the box.     11.54am    90+4 mins: Switzerland have a corner on the right. They keep it in the corner and then play the ball backwards. The Swiss know how to keep and kill time.      11.52am    90+2 mins: Very much a case of Switzerland knocking the ball around slowly to keep possession and Cameroon do not seem to have the energy to press too intensely. You\u2019d think Switzerland were 2-0 up, considering how little running Cameroon are doing.      11.50am    90 mins: Six minutes added on. Rodriguez is replaced by Comert.      11.49am    89 mins: Xhaka tries to seal it with a low drive from 25 yards but Onana gets down well. Again, there have been few stoppages in this half so we might get a normal amount of injury time.      11.48am    88 mins: The attendance is stated as 39,089. The capacity is 44,000, so we can assume that is almost certainly nonsense.      11.46am    86 mins: Cameroon need to up it here. All a touch pedestrian.      11.44am    84 mins: Rieder sends in a corner, it is headed up in the air and lands in between Xhaka and couple of defenders. He hits Aboubakar on the hand, causing the Swiss to shout for a penalty but the referee is not interested and righty so. Cameroon break but it is quickly stopped by Akanji, who is booked.      11.42am    82 mins: I do wonder the impact of each team having five subs. It does seem to decrease the quality of matches late on. Maybe I am wrong. Vargas is off and Rieder is on for Switzerland. For Cameroon, Mbeumo is off and Ngamaleu is on.      11.40am    80 mins: Fai swings in a cross from the right which flies just over Sommer\u2019s head.      11.37am    78 mins: The substitutions have made the game a touch disjointed and scrappy.      11.36am    76 mins: Widmer is down after getting a blow to the face.      11.34am    74 mins: Switzerland want a foul after Elvedi goes down under a challenge in his own area, plays goes on and Cameroon have a chance but Ondoua is tackled.  Choupo-Moting and Toko Ekambi are off, replaced by Nkoudou and Aboubakar.      11.31am    72 mins: Switzerland make a triple change. Seferovic, Frei and Okofor replace Sow, Shaqiri and Embolo. All change up top for the Swiss.      11.30am    70 mins: Switzerland are getting a lot of joy down the Cameroon left. In the latest attack Widmer gets to the byline but his cross is turned behind.      11.28am    68 mins: From the resulting corner Embolo looks set to double the lead from a few yards out but Anguissa sticks a leg in the away to turn Shaqiri\u2019s cross over. Ondoua on for Hongla.      11.26am    66 mins: Ondoua is preparing to come on for Cameroon. They need some fresh legs after the shift the midfielders have put in. Some look a little tired.  Mbeumo lifts a free-kick into the box for his teammates to attack. Anguissa gets his head on it but it does not have the power to trouble Sommer.  Switzerland quickly break; Shaqiri pulls the ball back for Freuler who takes aim for the corner but Onana produces a great save.     11.24am    64 mins: Elvedi is booked after pulling Choupo-Moting back to make amends for being turned on the halfway line. A clever foul in many ways.      11.22am    62 mins: Shaqiri leads a break for Switzerland. The ball reaches Vargas on the left, who plays it to Xhaka and back to Shaqiri, only for the forward to be crowded out in the box.     11.20am    60 mins: Mbeumo plays a poorly-executed pass which is cut out by Shaqiri but Switzerland whack the ball out of play for a throw-in. Sloppy from both sides.      11.18am    58 mins: Choupo-Moting goes on a one-man mission to equalise. He barrels through a couple of challenges to get into the box; he reaches the byline and tries to jab home from a tight angle but Sommer is there to turn it behind.  Mbeumo takes the corner and Sommer is there again to fist clear.      11.16am    56 mins: Switzerland enjoy a good spell of possession, putting plenty of passes together to frustrate Cameroon.      11.14am    54 mins: Mbeumo is tripped by Vargas on the right flank. He picks up the ball to send another a free-kick into the box from deep. The Brentford man swings it in but Sommer reads it and claims.      11.12am    52 mins: Vargas tries to play a one-two with Xhaka. The Arsenal man plays the pass but is caught late, only for the referee to wave it away. How very lenient of him.      11.10am    50 mins: A deep free-kick from Cameroon is lumped to the back post and is headed back into the danger area but Sommer comes out to punch clear.      11.09am   GOAL! Switzerland 1-0 Cameroon (Embolo, 48)  Switzerland score with their first shot on target. They move the ball across the pitch quickly, eventually reaching Shaqiri on the right, who slides a cross into Embolo allowing him to tap in from six yards. He does not celebrate because he was born in Cameroon.    Updated at 11.13am GMT    11.07am    47 mins: Vargas does a little trickery on the left but leaves the ball behind, which seems counter-productive.      11.05am   Second half  Here we go again!     11.01am    ITV seem keen to get me to visit Qatar. I think I will pass, thanks.      10.58am    Laura Woods HATES vuvuzelas.      10.51am    K\u00e1ri Tulinius emails: \u201cReferee Facundo Tello has had a good game. In fact, I didn\u2019t even notice it was him until the Finnish commentator mentioned that in his last game before the World Cup, that this was the ref who dished out 10 red cards in the Argentine equivalent of the Community Shield.\u201d      10.50am    Get your Vlahovic fill during half time.      10.48am   Switzerland 0-0 Cameroon  An entertaining and even first half. Both teams will be happy with their performances and will probably be a little irked they have failed to find the net.      10.47am    45+1 mins: A Switzerland corner finds Akanji on the edge of the six-yard box but he can only flash his header wide. A huge chance.     10.46am    45 mins: Only two minutes added on.     10.44am     44 mins: How long will be added on before half time? I can\u2019t remember any stoppages of note, so \u2026 eight minutes?      10.43am    42 mins: Elvedi is involved down the other end as he fails to deal with a cross but makes up for it my deflecting Choupo-Moting\u2019s shot behind for a corner. Mbeumo takes it but Switzerland flick the ball away.      10.41am    40 mins: Castelletto is dispossessed by Embolo 30 yards from his own goal. Embolo ends up through on goal but Castelletto is determined to get back and gets there just in time to tackle the striker and send the ball out for a corner.  The resulting set-piece finds Elvedi eight yards out, he stoops to head at goal but sends his effort just wide.      10.38am    38 mins: It\u2019s been an entertaining game thus far with both teams looking dangerous in the final third but the Swiss are yet to test Onana.      10.36am    36 mins: Widmer is in the action down the other end, sliding in to beat Toto-Ekambi to Fai\u2019s cross inside the six-yard box and save a certain goal.  Fai goes into the book moments later for a needlessly late challenge on Elvedi.     10.34am    34 mins: Switzerland beat the press and get the ball to Widmer on the right, allowing him to flash a cross along the six-yard line but Cameroon get it clear.     10.33am    32 mins: Andros Townsend on co-comms says you can judge a team\u2019s confidence by how their full-backs are playing. Cameroon\u2019s a playing high and wide, if you are wondering.      10.32am    30 mins: Neat play from Mbeumo and Choupo-Moting always the former to slip a pass through for Hongla, who hits a scuffed shot across Sommer. The goalkeeper can only palm it out in front of him but thankfully for the goalkeeper there is a defender to swipe clear. Daniel makes an interesting point. Fifa can\u2019t get many calls right. I fear they do not even consider this sort of thing.   Updated at 10.33am GMT    10.28am    28 mins: Cameroon get a goal kick despite it looking like Tolo is the man to get the last touch. The wry smile from Tolo implies he thinks so, too.      10.26am    26 mins: Admir Pajic emails: \u201cCameroon haven\u2019t had the best time at WCs since Italia 90 with one victory and ten defeats in 15 games since the defeat against England. \u201cSwitzerland, on the other hand, are tough nut to crack - they rarely either win or lose inside 90 minutes at WCs (just four defeats in 15 games came inside 90 minutes). \u201cHowever, I\u2019ve been thinking if having too many players on the wrong side of 30s has been a problem for big teams such as Argentina, Germany, Croatia and Belgium while England and Spain look more lively than any of aforementioned teams. Switzerland have a fair Sch\u00e4r of 30-somethings as well.\u201d I wonder if the experience of tournament football is very useful for Switzerland. These players know how to get the job done. And a lovely pun in there.   Updated at 10.40am GMT    10.25am    24 mins: Cameroon move the ball out to Mbuemo on the right, he cuts in and looks set to shoot but Switzerland close him down. The attack earns Cameroon a corner. Mbuemo sends it into the box but it misses everyone.     10.22am    22 mins: Switzerland take a little risk a the back with some short passes. Elvedi does not put enough pace on his backpass to Sommer who just gets to the ball a split second before Mbuemo and chips it back to his centre-back.      10.20am    20 mins: A couple of crosses are sent into the box and cleared. The ball makes it out to Xhaka who looks to dink a ball over the top but he puts a little too much on the pass and it goes out for a goal kick.      10.18am    18 mins: \u201cThanks for the wonderful coverage from sunny climbs. (Living room?),\u201d asks Bill Hargreaves. I certainly am here, with my very untidy desk. \u201cMight be my oversight, but I can\u2019t see Roger Milla\u2019s name on the team-sheet. Is this a typo?\u201d He had to be rested to make sure he was able to take his prize from Infantino before the match.     10.16am    16 mins: Switzerland seem very keen to whip crosses into the box. They are yet to cause too much trouble but it looks like a cunning plan.      10.16am    15 mins: Choupo-Moting beats Akanji to a the ball on the halfway line, allowing him to run through on goal. The Manchester City defender gets back to put him under pressure, meaning the shot lacks power, allowing Sommer to get down to stop it.  Updated at 10.16am GMT    10.14am    14 mins: Vargas does a step over and drops a shoulder on the left before pinging a low cross into the corridor of uncertainty but there is not a Switzerland player in sight, allowing Cameroon to clear. Moments later Shaqiri slips a pass through to Embolo in the area but he is bundled over. Not that it really matters because he is a yard offside.      10.13am    12 mins: Xhaka decides to let fly from 30 yards but he sends the ball very high over the bar and then shouts at his teammates for some reason or other.      10.11am    10 mins: Two chances for Cameroon. A long pass is played through the Swiss defence for Mbuemo to chase, he gets there and fires a shot straight at Sommer. The rebounds lands at Toko-Ekambi\u2019s feet but he flashes the ball over from 10 yards.   Updated at 10.17am GMT    10.08am    8 mins: Cameroon have their first quasi-attack of the match, earning a free-kick around 35 yards from goal. Mbuemo takes it but fails to beat the first man and the danger is quickly nullified.      10.07am    6 mins: Embolo rolls the defender and plays it to Shaqiri, who swings a cross into a dangerous area from the right but there is no one in red to meet it. There is, however, a man in green who does his best to help Switzerland by slicing his attempted clearance but Onana is there to catch it.      10.04am    4 mins: No shortage of shade on the pitch, which is a little annoying. There is a bit of noise in the stands but not too much due to the healthy amount of empty seats we can see around the side.   Updated at 10.05am GMT    10.02am    2 mins: A positive start from the Swiss who move the ball up the pitch quickly to earn a corner. Shaqiri swings it in from the right, it is low towards the near post and causes a little bit of confusion before Cameroon swipe it clear.      10.01am   Kick off  Peep! Peep! Peep! Here we go!     9.54am    The reaction from Germany to yesterday\u2019s defeat to Japan.   Updated at 9.59am GMT    9.53am    It sounds and looks like the stadium his half empty. Not what the organisers would want for this group game. I am sure they will massage the attendance figures.     9.52am    Carney is a big Anguissa fan and so am I. Maybe we should be friends.     9.50am    Roger Milla gets a certificate from Infantino on the pitch. I hope it goes on his wall. Shame about having to meet Infantino, though.     9.49am    The Guardian\u2019s very own Karen Carney is currently on ITV. She is backing Brazil to win the tournament. Her views on England v USA will be out later today.      9.36am    One of the greats interviews one of the greats.      9.25am    \u201cMy favourite early kick off story,\u201d says Gerry Scott, \u201cwas when Ronaldinho was playing for Barcelona and they requested the game be brought forward due to international commitments. That was refused so they brought the match forward until 12:05am.\u201d      9.15am    Peter Oh emails: \u201cI feel like I have got something in common with Dani Alves \u2018cos I love football and they don\u2019t pay me either.\u201d I am also here on a volunteer basis.      9.12am    Bangers and goals.      9.10am    Looking forward to seeing Djibril Sow for Switzerland. Nottingham Forest were very interested in signing the Eintracht Frankfurt player in the summer, so we will find what they missed out on.     9.04am   Starting lineups  Switzerland (4-2-3-1): Sommer; Widmer, Akanji, Elvedi, Rodr\u00edguez; Freuler, Xhaka; Shaqiri, Sow, Vargas; Embolo Cameroon (4-3-3): Onana; Tolo, Nkoulou, Castelletto, Fai; Gouet, Hongla, Zambo Anguissa; Mbeumo, Choupo-Moting, Toko Ekambi.     9.02am    Cameroon came into the stadium singing and dancing. You do not get that from the Swiss.      8.49am    Sid Lowe has had a little natter with Dani Alves. Brazil play later today \u2026      8.42am    It seems very odd to be doing a minute-by-minute at this time of day. The match kicks off at 10am GMT. What is the earliest you have been to a professional football match? I remember Man City once played Everton in an 11.30am kick-off (or similar).     8.37am    What\u2019s happening today in the World Cup? Let the Guardian tell you \u2026      8.31am    Louise Taylor has written about former Liverpool and West Ham defender Rigobert Song, who is now the Cameroon coach.      8.30am   Hello!  There are some big hitters entering the World Cup fray today: Brazil, the unemployed Cristiano Ronaldo, to name but two. There are few big hitters, however, than Xherdan Shaqiri\u2019s calves. The Swiss international has 109 caps to his name in his 31 years. Experience is a theme of this Switzerland squad; there are three players with a century of international appearances to their name, not to mention Haris Seferovic on 98 and 33-year-old Yann Sommer. It helped them defeat France in the Euros to reach the quarter finals. They made it out of the group at the past two World Cups, so will come into this feeling relatively confident.  Obviously, the fact Brazil are also in Group G makes this a must-win game for Switzerland and Cameroon. The Africans are not at their historic best but there is plenty of quality running throughout the side. From Andre Onana in net to the in form Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting at the other end of the pitch, Cameroon can give most teams a game of their day. The finished third in last year\u2019s Africa Cup of Nations, so they know how to progress in a tournament. They arrive in Qatar ranked 43rd in the world, 28 below Switzerland, which is a slight indication of the difference between the two teams but I think the gap is not as large as Gianni Infantino\u2019s boffins think. Let\u2019s hope for a decent game to get Group G off to a fine start.  Kick-off: 10am GMT  "

                    "body": "As the first big snowfall of winter threatens to drop this week, it\u2019s not only the forecasters and road gritters who will be twitchy: Britain\u2019s energy executives and policymakers are on tenterhooks. Many Britons who have held off putting on the heating, afraid of the bulging bills that could follow, may be forced to nudge the thermostat up, putting a strain on the country\u2019s power supplies. National Grid has warned that a confluence of scenarios including a cold snap and a cut-off of Russian gas to Europe could lead to power cuts. Is this the first piece of that grim jigsaw?  An initial assessment appears far more positive than two months ago. Other European countries have filled their gas storage facilities more rapidly than expected, meaning UK competition for supplies has reduced. In fact, Europe\u2019s storage is so full, some tankers carrying liquified natural gas (LNG) have even been idling in European waters, waiting for prices to bounce back. Mother Nature has also played a part: the mild start to winter reduced demand, with some bosses reporting consumption had fallen more than 10% on last year. But while temperatures have been unseasonably warm, wind speeds have been more concerning. Last week dunkelflaute (German for a \u201cdark lull\u201d) conditions \u2013 with barely any wind or solar power available to generate electricity on grey, still days \u2013 left gas as a key power source. National Grid data showed the fossil fuel was responsible for as much as 60% of Great Britain\u2019s electricity generation for much of last week, far higher than its average of about 40% at this time of year, while wind was only 7%. The conditions were concerning enough for National Grid to flirt with using its demand flexibility service, which incentivises businesses and consumers to shift their power usage, although ultimately it stopped short. Freezing conditions predicted in Europe for mid-December are also driving sentiment. Gas accounted for 49% of electricity generation on Monday, while wind was far healthier than last week at 25%, with nuclear and biomass providing a steady 12% and 6% behind that. However, the cold weather was enough to get energy traders moving \u2013 the price of gas for delivery on Tuesday rose 6% to 340p, nearing a three-month high set earlier this month. Rising prices also have implications for the government\u2019s energy price guarantee, which covers the cost for suppliers between wholesale prices and a fixed cost. The higher gas prices are, the bigger the eventual bill for the government. Nathan Piper, an oil and gas analyst at Investec, says: \u201cIt could have been a false dawn thinking we had sorted out the gas issue earlier in autumn. If we get cold and still winter conditions there could still be issues \u2013 that\u2019s why we have seen gas prices go up.\u201d He says market watchers now believe gas prices will peak next winter, because of the uncertainty over how Europe will replace the six months of significant Russian gas supplies that were available this year. One of Britain\u2019s strengths is its diversity of energy supplies: gas from the North Sea and Norway, and LNG from around the globe, notably the US and Qatar. In electricity, there is wind and solar, nuclear, biomass \u2013 particularly from the heavily subsidised Drax power station in North Yorkshire \u2013 and a small amount of coal. Government efforts to boost supplies this winter have included paying to keep coal units set for retirement on standby. (These have not yet been exercised). The revived gas storage facilities at Centrica\u2019s Rough \u2013 shut down after the government refused to support it \u2013 have also been called into action, although Britain\u2019s gas storage is far lower than other European countries. A factor to watch will be the role of interconnectors \u2013 the vast undersea cables carrying gas and electricity to and from Britain, Belgium and France. Britain has built goodwill over the summer, providing LNG to Europe; however, any suggestion France could be short of energy supplies this winter could test relations already dented by Brexit. Although France was not as reliant as its neighbours on Russian gas, problems getting several nuclear power stations back online after maintenance have reduced its electricity production. If Emmanuel Macron\u2019s government limited supplies to Britain to protect its own citizens, it would risk a valuable long-term relationship (upcoming World Cup quarter-finals notwithstanding). \u201cIt may not come down to resource nationalism,\u201d Piper says. \u201cIf France doesn\u2019t have the power to export, then the situation could get tight.\u201d Issues with hydroelectric power imports from Norway this year have also caused concern. The prospect of snowy conditions will also train minds on a much-debated \u00a318m government campaign to encourage households to cut their energy usage. The debate over whether to launch a public information campaign has pitched Conservative ideology over \u201cnanny state intervention\u201d against practical calls to save energy and money. It is expected before Christmas, months after similar drives in elsewhere in Europe, which have led to a 15% cut in consumption. Simon Virley, a vice-chair and the head of energy and natural resources at KPMG, says: \u201cAs we approach the first significant cold snap of the winter, improving energy efficiency and reducing demand couldn\u2019t be more important \u2013 both to get bills down and to ensure people can heat their homes properly. \u201cThe government has now signed off an energy efficiency campaign but the overall aim of getting demand down by 15% by 2030 is less ambitious than in many European countries which are already on course to achieve that this winter.\u201d Snowfall this week could prove the energy industry\u2019s first big test of an extraordinary winter."

                    "body": "It feels fitting in some ways that during a week that is hotter than Hades \u2013 when alarm bells about our direction of travel should be ringing even louder \u2013 Ben Stokes has announced his retirement from one-day international cricket. Yep, the champion all-rounder who powered England to World Cup victory by the barest of margins three summers ago, in front of a packed house at Lord\u2019s and with the UK\u2019s largest cricket audience since the heady 2005 Ashes, has decided the 50-over stuff must make way. If not, his schedule as an elite all-format player would become suffocating. The hope now is that this similarly prompts a wake-up call.  Rather poetically, he will bid farewell to the format after winning his 105th ODI cap at the Riverside in Chester-le-Street, County Durham on Tuesday. It is the ground that Ged and Deborah Stokes used to drive their restless, sports-mad son to from their home in Cockermouth some three times a week, two hours each way, in an act of selfless parenting that lit the fire for a remarkable sporting career. Ben Stokes, England cricketer and totemic Test captain, powers on, of course. In fact more so, in terms of where, aged 31, he wants to direct his energies. Modern all-format stars do not tend to jack it all in at once anyway, rather strip away that which means least to them and design their latter years weighing up health, wealth and happiness. When they do so it says a bit about the player and plenty about the sport. And Stokes could not have been clearer about the bigger picture here, citing an \u201cunsustainable schedule\u201d and his fear of letting down teammates. For a cricketer paid by one of the boards responsible for this, to be so explicit in pushing back is quite the thing. After all, in practical terms Stokes did n0t have to announce this right now, so deep is his line of credit. He averaged 50 with the bat during Eoin Morgan\u2019s five-year World Cup project, is a genuine sixth bowler and fields like a demon. Allied with talismanic dressing-room status and, as England\u2019s highest earner, he could shoulder arms to any series he did not fancy between now and the defence in 2023 and likely still command a spot.  Last week, as well as withdrawing from the upcoming Twenty20 series against South Africa to ready himself for the Test matches that follow, it was announced he would skip the Hundred this summer and his employers simply had to suck it up. No one batted an eyelid, nor would they were his ODIs to become fleeting. But now was the time, like a leader, to take one for the team and give clarity in response to a fixture list that lacks anything of the sort. \u201cI feel that my body is letting me down because of the schedule and what is expected of us,\u201d he said. This announcement, decided last week but coming during a 48-hour turnaround between ODIs, was as sweetly timed as that famous swept six off Trent Boult at Lord\u2019s three years ago.  Stokes knows his mind and body have limits. So much so he wisely took a four-month break last summer when bereavement and injury proved an overwhelming mix. Since returning to mental and physical fitness \u2013 both boxes not fully ticked until the tour of the Caribbean in March, even if he still grimaces in the field at times \u2013 he has become ever more besotted with Test cricket and taken on tunnel vision with it. \u201cI will give everything I have to Test cricket, and now, with this decision, I feel I can also give my total commitment to the T20 format,\u201d he said in his statement. The latter\u2019s appeal is understandable in the modern economic climate but, having passed up the Indian Premier League this year and hinted he will do so again before next summer\u2019s Ashes assault, it is clear the type of cricket which is calling him. The alliance with the head coach, Brendon McCullum, has also begun in quite astonishing fashion \u2013 those four spellbinding run chases in a row \u2013 and one could almost sense during these last three ODIs that this goal is now consuming his every cricketing thought. Put simply, the Test team and winning back the urn from Australia have become an obsession and Stokes is a character who is all-in when hooked.  The fear, of course, is that his broader call for a cleaner schedule falls on deaf ears. The ICC (aka the major boards) is working on a schedule that, while pruning back some ODI cricket over the next five years, features a global men\u2019s tournament every 12 months. If the 50-over format is on the way out, no one seems to have told the organisers of the 2023, 2027 and 2031 World Cups, or Champions Trophies in 2025 and 2029. Each of the ICC members will also jostle to promote their domestic leagues \u2013 but stop everything for the two and a half months of the IPL to keep their players happy \u2013 and somehow attempt to keep touring for their bilateral commitments, too. But on Tuesday, back where it all began for Stokes, it will at least be a chance for the English game to thank the all-rounder for his efforts as a World Cup-winning one-day international star and applaud his burning desire to keep the flame of Test cricket alive."

                    "body": "The Football Association is poised to unveil a historic almost tenfold increase in prize money for the Women\u2019s FA Cup.\nIn January the governing body said there would be \u201ca significant increase\u201d and the Guardian understands that the prize pot, currently about \u00a3309,000, will rise to well beyond \u00a32.5m.\n\nIt is not yet known what the distribution model will be. Prize money for the Women\u2019s FA Cup has been in the spotlight in recent years, with the not-for-profit FA criticised over the fact that teams competing in the early rounds have struggled to cover the costs of taking part. The disparity between the women\u2019s and men\u2019s competitions has also been highlighted, with the 735 teams competing in the men\u2019s FA Cup sharing \u00a315.9m, while the \u00a3309,000 for the women\u2019s edition \u2013 less than 2% of the men\u2019s total \u2013 is shared by 300 teams.\nFor women\u2019s teams who win in the first-round proper \u00a3850 is on offer, whereas men\u2019s teams at the same stage collect \u00a322,629. Teams who win their fourth-round ties take away \u00a32,000 compared with \u00a390,000 for men\u2019s teams at the same stage.\nThe holders of the women\u2019s trophy, Chelsea, picked up \u00a325,000 for their triumph over Arsenal at Wembley in December \u2013 1.4% of the \u00a31.8m handed to the men\u2019s champions, Leicester City.\nAs a result of the huge disparity, the Women\u2019s Football Fan Collective was launched by frustrated fans from across the pyramid. It has organised the chanting of \u201cNo ifs, no buts, we want an equal FA Cup\u201d at all Cup fixtures since the fourth-round games in early February.\n\nAt the end of January the FA said: \u201cWhilst the competition doesn\u2019t yet drive commercial revenue to fund prize money growth, the FA Board has agreed a significant increase in prize money to support the competition\u2019s continued development.\u201d\nThere have been similar discussions at international level. At the 2019 Women\u2019s World Cup Fifa announced that the prize money for the 2023 edition would double from $30m to $60m. However this was widely criticised because the 2018 men\u2019s World Cup prize fund of $400m is seeing a bigger than $30m increase for Qatar 2022, where the winners will collect $10m more than France\u2019s $40m in 2018, with the runners-up taking $40m and third place $30m."

                    "body": "It was interesting that when Harry Kane launched his charitable foundation on Monday, with the aim to transform the conversation around mental health, he brought up his release by Arsenal as an eight-year-old.\nThe Tottenham and England striker has not hidden the detail; it is a part of his story and he has always been an open person, happy to engage. But at the same time, it has long had the trappings of a guilty secret \u2013 you know, Spurs\u2019 homegrown hero and the other mob in north London.\n\nKane wanted to share the episode in a cartoon that went out on his social media channels because he felt it was important to address the subject of rejection for his younger fans (and the older ones, too); to show that strength can come in adversity if there is the willingness to \u201cgo again and work even harder\u201d.\nThe 29-year-old read a bedtime story for the nation\u2019s children that evening on CBeebies and, in it, he admitted to feeling vulnerable and fearful at times, and how it was OK.\nThis was Kane opening up to own the narrative in all the right ways and for all the right reasons. It also highlighted the single truth behind everything he has achieved. To paraphrase him from his press conference before the pivotal Champions League tie at home against Eintracht Frankfurt on Wednesday night, his identity is to fight and to prove people wrong.\nKane has a lot going on, a great weight on his shoulders \u2013 mainly because of the World Cup, which kicks off in Qatar on 20 November. Every time the England captain feels a challenge and goes down, it is as if the nation holds its breath. An injury to Gareth Southgate\u2019s talisman is unthinkable. Kane is committed, as well, to wearing the OneLove armband at the finals as part of an anti-discrimination initiative and in support of the LGBTQ+ community. He has taken on the responsibility of being a face for the campaign.\nBut first Spurs and vaulting his latest obstacle. Kane has started the season brilliantly \u2013 with eight goals in 12 club matches, almost all of them decisive. If it were not for some bloke at Manchester City, Kane\u2019s form would have been trumpeted more widely. And yet in three Champions League ties so far, he has drawn blanks. It has to change, with even Antonio Conte, the Spurs manager, acknowledging that \u201cwe need his goals in the Champions League\u201d.\nKane goes back to the Arsenal rejection. He goes back to those loan spells at the beginning of his professional career \u2013 two of which, at Norwich and Leicester, did not work out. He will dig deeper and he will overcome.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always been part of my personality to prove people wrong and when you look back on my career \u2026 going out on loan and the things I had to achieve to get to where I am now, for sure, that\u2019s part of my identity,\u201d Kane said, when asked about the Arsenal rejection cartoon.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really important message for any young boys or girls wanting to become footballers or anything in life. There are going be knocks along the way but it\u2019s about how you cope with that \u2013 keep working and keep moving forward. My personality is to prove, not just people wrong, but to myself that I can be the best that I know I can be.\n\u201cI want to score in every game. There have been a few in the [Champions League] group and I\u2019ve been disappointed not to get on the scoresheet. I\u2019m hoping I can turn it around.\u201d\nFor Kane and his teammates the ruthlessness was not there in last Tuesday\u2019s 0-0 draw against Eintracht in Frankfurt and, with the group finely balanced, Conte did not have to spell out why Spurs had to \u201cexploit\u201d this tie and the one that follows against Sporting, also at home.\nConte will again be without Dejan Kulusevski, who has had a precautionary scan on his injured hamstring; it showed no problems and he could return against Everton on Saturday. Lucas Moura is back in the squad after a tendon issue.\nKane was asked about Erling Haaland, who has begun the season in such scorching form at City. Kane has only respect and admiration for him but the numbers of a rival are of no concern. \u201cBecause it\u2019s nothing I can control,\u201d Kane said.\n\u201cI am concentrating on what I can do and helping the team in any way that is possible. It has been going well so far in the Premier League. I want to try to score a few more goals in the Champions League.\u201d"

If you want to press and be more aggressive, sometimes you cannot be too nice.

We wore black armbands on Wednesday night. \n\u201cI think there\u2019s a minute\u2019s applause, we will abide by whatever obligations and responsibilities we have as a football club. We will do that in a respectful manner. We want our supporters to do the same.\u201d \n\n\n\n 3.53pm  \n\nThe Arsenal head coach, Mikel Arteta, remained tight-lipped regarding the availability of Ukraine international Oleksandr Zinchenko for Sunday\u2019s Premier League trip to Brentford despite the defender\u2019s national team saying he had picked up a calf injury.\nZinchenko, 25, missed games against Fulham and Aston Villa with a knee sprain but returned to feature in Arsenal\u2019s most recent fixtures against Manchester United in the league and FC Zurich in the Europa League.\nUkraine\u2019s FA said on Friday that Zinchenko had withdrawn from international duty after sustaining the injury during training at Arsenal and would be sidelined for two weeks, missing Ukraine\u2019s Nations League matches later this month.\n\n\u201cWe have to wait until tomorrow to make a decision,\u201d Arteta said on Friday. \u201cWhat we have decided to do for international week doesn\u2019t mean it will be the same this weekend.\u201d\nArteta added he would provide an update on Thomas Partey\u2019s fitness after Arsenal\u2019s training session on Saturday. The Ghana midfielder has missed the last four games across all competitions with a thigh problem.

A thigh injury has dictated that the Newcastle centre-forward has not been named in Gareth Southgate\u2019s squad for the Nations League games against Italy and Germany, when he was widely expected to receive a recall. Instead England\u2019s manager has called up Brentford\u2019s former Newcastle striker Ivan Toney in what appears a key audition for the role of Harry Kane\u2019s principal understudy.\n\n\n\n\n 3.39pm  \n\nBournemouth\u2019s owner, Maxim Demin, is in talks with a consortium led by Bill Foley, the owner of ice hockey\u2019s Vegas Golden Knights, over a potential sale for about \u00a3150m. If successful, it would mean that more than half the Premier League\u2019s clubs have minority or majority US shareholders.\n\n\n\n\n 3.38pm  \n\nLet\u2019s have a quick recap of our football stories from today. Handy if, like me, you weren\u2019t stationed by a computer or a mobile phone earlier on.\n\nUpdated at 3.44pm BST\n\n\n 3.35pm  \n\nAs mentioned by Stuart below about an hour ago, Luis Enrique announced his Spain squad via an eye-catching clip of him riding a bike earlier.\nWe\u2019ve now done a news story on it, so clearly it\u2019s a PR win for Spain\u2019s content and social media team. \u00a1Vamos!\n\n\nUpdated at 3.45pm BST\n\n\n 3.28pm  \n\nWhat are your hopes and expectations for the action this weekend?\nYou can always email me or tweet with your thoughts.\n\n\n\n 3.26pm  \n\nSpeaking this morning, David Moyes talked about what it means to be heading back to Everton with West Ham this weekend: \u201cIt was a massive part of my career \u2026 11 and a half years \u2026 I\u2019ve only got thanks and good feelings for Everton, for what they did for me and my family.\n\u201cBut I\u2019m West Ham manage, my job\u2019s to try and win, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ll try to do.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 4.54pm BST\n\n\n 3.21pm  \n\n\u201cLamps\u201d, as some of you like to call him, also had a word about the All-Star game idea floated by Todd Boehly the other day.\n\u201cI think practically it\u2019s very difficult because of our calendar &amp; schedule here ... To go and play a game like that is potentially high-risk with injury,\u201d Lampard said.\n\u201c[But] I think it\u2019s a fair conversation. When you start thinking of the players that will be involved you go: wow, yeah, that would be interesting.\u201d\nHe also added a caveat about how it\u2019s important to keep the traditions of the domestic game.\n\n\n\n 3.10pm  \n\nThe Everton manager Frank Lampard insists he is putting no pressure on fit-again Dominic Calvert-Lewin as the striker prepares to return to action. \u201cHe knows he has support and advice from me and I try not to give him that pressure on top of that. I just try to talk football with him,\u201d said Lampard. \u201cI know what he can give us because he gave it to us at the back end of last season and he is experienced enough to deal with it. All we want is Dominic fit and firing but it is difficult with injuries as it can easily happen when you get one and then another one comes.\n\u201cHe\u2019s had that period and I just hope to see him playing regular football. He is not under any undue pressure from myself and the staff. We just want to see him in the best condition, so he can help us. Let\u2019s all work in the right direction to get him fit and release some of that pressure by hopefully the team being strong with or without Dominic.\u201d (PA)\n\n\n\n 3.00pm  \nEcuador on track for 2022 World Cup after Chile's appeal rejected\n\nChile has lost its appeal to replace Ecuador at the World Cup in Qatar, but Friday\u2019s verdict by Fifa will likely lead the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, reports AP. Fifa dismissed Chile\u2019s argument that Ecuador player Byron Castillo was Colombian and ineligible to play in World Cup qualifying games. Castillo played in eight of them for Ecuador.\nFifa said its appeal judges \u201cdeemed that on the basis of the documents presented, the player was to be considered as holding permanent Ecuadorian nationality in accordance\u201d with the country\u2019s legal statutes.\nThe verdict, which upholds a Fifa disciplinary ruling from June, keeps Ecuador on track to play Qatar in the opening game of the World Cup in Doha on 20 November. The Netherlands and Senegal are also in Group A. However, Chile\u2019s legal challenge may continue.\nThe Chilean soccer federation can now appeal against Fifa\u2019s verdict to Cas in Lausanne, Switzerland. Sport\u2019s highest court can organise an urgent hearing and ruling in the nine weeks left until the World Cup starts. Chile claimed to have evidence proving Castillo is Colombian and should never have played for Ecuador. Chile prepared its case after the World Cup draw was made on April 1, and after FIFA and Qatari organisers sold thousands of tickets and accommodation rooms to Ecuador fans.\nHad Ecuador forfeited the eight games Castillo played, Chile would have risen to the fourth automatic qualification place in the South American qualifying group and Ecuador would have dropped out of contention.\n\nUpdated at 3.01pm BST\n\n\n 2.50pm  \n\nFar from the most pressing news of the day but interesting nonetheless. Borussia Dortmund are off on tour to the USA next year, reports Reuters:\nBundesliga heavyweights Borussia Dortmund will tour the United States next year as the club looks to tap into the growing North American soccer market ahead of the 2026 World Cup, the club said on Friday. The German club will tour south east Asia during this year\u2019s World Cup in Qatar from 21 November to 1 December and will take in Singapore, Indonesia and Vietnam.\n\n\u201cNorth America but also greater America are very important markets for us,\u201d Dortmund managing director Carsten Cramer told an international media roundtable. \u201cIt is a logical consequence that we will go back to the United States next summer. \u201cWe are happy we made our plans for south east Asia this year and the United States next year. It won\u2019t be the last time we will go.\u201d\nThe 2026 World Cup will be co-hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico. Cramer said growing social media engagement figures for Dortmund meant there was increasing interest in the club in North America.\n\nUpdated at 2.54pm BST\n\n\n 2.44pm  \n\nThanks Stuart and good afternoon everyone. Here\u2019s a little more from Emma Hayes, the Chelsea Women head coach, before their WSL opener at Liverpool. They were meant to kick off against West Ham last Sunday but that was postponed following the Queen\u2019s death. Anyway, Hayes insists it was the correct call for football to be called off last weekend while other sports continued:\n\u201cI think the response is the same for every human being, player or not,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cOur country has lost unbelievable service from a person who has given absolutely everything to her country during her reign.\n\u201cFor most of us, particularly that have lived within that, we have experienced no other monarch. The conversations that take place in dressing rooms I think are the same conversations that take place in your workplace, which is nothing but the respect and the humble gratitude for someone who has done so much for this country.\u201d (Quotes from PA Media)\n\nUpdated at 2.46pm BST\n\n\n 2.35pm  \n\nA little more from Bruno Lage on Diego Costa \u2026\n\nLet\u2019s see, we have one more day, let\u2019s see if he can be available or not. When Sasa [Kalajdzic] got injured Diego was available, it was a time to talk to him and convince him to come to us, so we are very happy with him. We also know he needs time to be ready. He is fit, there are no problems but he needs to be ready to compete at this level.\nOur hope is to get him ready to compete at this level and I think we can bring the work with Costa because that\u2019s what we need. We need a reference in the box, we need a guy to compete with Ra\u00fal [Jimenez] and Diego has that profile.\u201d\n\nI now make way for Luke McLaughlin. Thanks for reading and writing!\n\n\n\n 2.32pm  \n\nBack on Brewin\u2019s international brothers call-to-action, this from Harriet Osborn on another pair of siblings who faced off representing different countries \u2026\n\nAlex and Christian Rold\u00e1n, who both play for the Seattle Sounders in MLS, faced each other while playing for El Salvador and the US respectively in Concacaf World Cup qualifying last fall (and in other occasions in the past).\n\nDing ding ding! Here\u2019s a little more on the Sounders\u2019 website.\n\n\n\n 2.28pm  \n\nGoing back a bit, to the earlier Spain squad announcement \u2026\nTurns out Luis Enrique revealed it while in the saddle \u2026 I bet those in charge of superimposing names on to the hillside were pleased there were no withdrawals between editing and posting.\n\u201cMister, with this team we will surely go smoothly!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 2.22pm  \n\nBrentford\u2019s Thomas Frank on Ivan Toney\u2019s England call-up.\n\nI\u2019m very, very pleased. A nice little touch to the story: Gareth texted me in the morning and said \u2018Thomas: you can bring the news to Ivan.\u2019 I think it\u2019s not often that we as managers or head coaches get to bring the news. It\u2019s a lot of times that [we have to tell players] they are not playing, and it\u2019s hard on them \u2013 90% suffering and 10% joy. That was definitely a very joyful moment. It\u2019s not often Ivan is speechless, but he was laughing and just very, very happy.\nHe\u2019s a very, very complicated guy \u2013 the journey has definitely not been straightforward for him. That is incredible, and for the club.\n\nFrank\u2019s side host Arsenal in the Sunday lunchtime game.\n\n\n\n 2.14pm  \n\nChelsea women open their title defence against promoted Liverpool on Sunday. In light of the bumper summer for women\u2019s football, manager Emma Hayes was asked about what\u2019s changed since she took the job in 2012 \u2026\n\nI don\u2019t think I was doing press conferences. I don\u2019t think I was doing any press at all. I\u2019ve aged \u2026 my jokes have got worse, I think that\u2019s fair to say. I remember there was a day when all we wanted was press \u2013 I\u2019m just ready for a barnstorming season.\n\nOn the postponed start to the season, she added:\n\nI think post-Covid everyone\u2019s adapted to changes, games being called off \u2013 I think quite rightly, in honour of her majesty \u2013 I think we\u2019ve experienced what that\u2019s like. It\u2019s been a very sombre week, very overwhelming to see the coverage regarding the buildup to the funeral. It\u2019ll be fitting on Sunday for the women\u2019s season to start and hopefully the fans and the players get the opportunity to pay respects in the way we know best \u2013 on the football pitch.\n\n\n\n\n 2.05pm  \n\nStuart back again \u2019ere for a spell, as John chases a rickshaw of harissa halloumi wraps up the road. \nThomas Frank and Emma Hayes have just been parping. Bear with me while I crack my transcription knuckles \u2026\n\n\n\n 1.59pm  \n\nRoberto Martinez has named his Belgium squad for matches against Wales and the Netherlands. The headline name \u2013 and it\u2019s a good name \u2013 is uncapped teenager Zeno Debast of Anderlecht, a potential Big Vinny Kompany of the future?\nMartinez also picked Jason Denayer but he will not play either game because he has not found a new club since leaving Lyon at the end of last season. Instead he will only train.\nNo Romelu Lukaku as he is currently injured.\nGoalkeepers: Koen Casteels (VfL Wolfsburg), Thibaut Courtois (Real Madrid), Simon Mignolet (Club Brugge), Matz Sels (Racng Strasbourg)\nDefenders: Toby Alderweireld (Royal Antwerp), Dedryck Boyata (Club Brugge), Timothy Castagne (Leicester City), Zeno Debast (Anderlecht), Jason Denayer (unattached), Wout Faes (Leicester City), Brandon Mechele (Club Brugge), Thomas Meunier (Borussia Dortmund), Arthur Theate (Stade Rennes), Jan Vertonghen (Anderlecht)\nMidfielders: Yannick Carrasco (Atletico Madrid), Kevin De Bruyne (Manchester City), Leander Dendoncker (Aston Villa), Thorgan Hazard (Borussia Dortmund), Dodi Lukebakio (Hertha Berlin), Alexis Saelamaekers (AC Milan), Amadou Onana (Everton), Youri Tielemans (Leicester City), Hans Vanaken (Club Brugge), Axel Witsel (Atletico Madrid\nForwards: Michy Batshuayi (Fenerbahce), Charles De Ketelaere (AC Milan), Eden Hazard (Real Madrid), Dries Mertens (Galatasaray), Lois Openda (Racing Lens), Leandro Trossard (Brighton &amp; Hove Albion)\n\nUpdated at 1.59pm BST\n\n\n 1.25pm  \n\nWolves play Manchester City in the Saturday lunchtime fixture and there\u2019s a chance Diego Costa might get to put it about a bit. \n\n\n\n\n 1.16pm  \nAllan Saint-Maximin wins Premier League goal of the month\n\nWith this one. Good goal and all that, but can\u2019t help thinking back to Sir Trevor Brooking and the phrase \u201cshinned it\u201d. Too harsh? \n\n\n\n\n 1.11pm  \n\nGood news for Liverpool/bad news for Thiago, who has been omitted from Spain\u2019s 25-man squad by Luis Enrique. Barcelona\u2019s Ansu Fati is the other big-name omission. Sergio Ramos was on the long list but is not picked, to nobody\u2019s particular surprise. He won\u2019t be adding to his 180 (!) caps. \nNico Williams takes the call, while his brother, Inaki, has declared for Ghana. Could the two brothers end up facing each other in a major tournament as, from memory, Kevin Prince-Boateng once did for Germany when his brother Jerome played for Germany at Soccer City in 2010. \nThe Xhaka brothers, Granit and Taulant faced each other at Euro 2016 when Switzerland beat Albania 1-0 in Lens. Any other examples come to mind? \nTwo of the goalkeepers come from Brighton and Brentford. Our League dominates. \nGoalkeepers: Unai Simon, Robert Sanchez, David Raya\nDefenders: Dani Carvajal, Eric Garc\u00eda, Jordi Alba, Cesar Azpilicueta, Diego Llorente, Pau Torres, Jose Gaya, Hugo Guillamon\nMidfielders: Rodri, Sergio Busquets, Koke, Gavi, Carlos Soler, Pedri, Marcos Llorente\nForwards: Alvaro Morata, Borja Iglesias, Ferran Torres, Pablo Sarabia, Nico Williams, Marcos Asensio, Yeremy Pino\n\n\n\n 12.44pm  \n\nAntonio Conte wants to see more from Yves Bissouma, snapped up from Brighton last season after playing very well against Tottenham. He\u2019s started just one game so far. \nHe will be used more during a seven-week spell from October 1 where they will play 12 times in the Premier League and Champions League.\nPer PA Media\n\nThe only (new) player that is struggling a bit with the tactical aspect is Bissouma, but also he is improving a lot in every aspect, so I am sure when we start again and play 12 games, for sure he is another player I can count on.\nWhen you have the possibility to work, to have more time, especially with new players, you can bring all the players into our idea of football. For sure in this first part of the season I wanted to play with the old players because they knew very well which is our idea of football, but now I think we are doing good steps with Richy, with Clement (Lenglet) and with Ivan Perisic.\nWith Bissouma, we are trying to accelerate this process, but for sure when you arrive in a team well organised with an idea of football, you need a bit of time to go into this idea of football. But I think that in the next 12 games, I have at least three players that I can count on much more in the way that I did in these seven (sic) games.\n\n\n\n\n 12.28pm  \n\nThe World Cup is closer than you think, and King Louis van Gaal is fully aware of that, having cut his Netherlands squad down to 25 for this month\u2019s Nations League games against Poland and Belgium. He had named a preliminary squad of 32 a fortnight ago but trimmed it down, keeping the uncapped trio of goalkeepers Andries Noppert and Remko Pasveer and the Ajax Amsterdam attacker Kenneth Taylor. But Leeds United defender Pascal Struijk, who could also play for Belgium, has not made it.\n\u201cThis is the last chance to see the players at work before we have to name the World Cup selection,* said Van Gaal in a statement, per Reuters. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said before, the preparation time before the World Cup is extremely limited so therefore we have to use all the time we have available. After these games we won\u2019t be together until 14 November, one week before our first game at the World Cup.\u201d\nGoalkeepers: Jasper Cillessen (NEC Nijmegen), Mark Flekken (Freiburg), Andries Noppert (Heerenveen), Remko Pasveer (Ajax Amsterdam)\nDefenders: Nathan Ake (Manchester City), Daley Blind (Ajax Amsterdam), Matthijs de Ligt (Bayern Munich), Stefan de Vrij (Inter Milan), Denzel Dumfries (Inter Milan), Tyrell Malacia (Manchester United), Bruno Martins Indi (AZ Alkmaar), Devyne Rensch, Jurrien Timber (both Ajax Amsterdam), Virgil van Dijk (Liverpool)\nMidfielders: Steven Berghuis (Ajax Amsterdam), Frenkie de Jong (Barcelona), Marten de Roon (Atalanta), Davy Klaassen (Ajax Amsterdam), Teun Koopmeiners (Atalanta), Kenneth Taylor (Ajax Amsterdam)\nForwards: Steven Bergwijn (Ajax Amsterdam), Memphis Depay (Barcelona), Cody Gakpo (PSV Eindhoven), Vincent Janssen (Royal Antwerp), Wout Weghorst (Besiktas).\n\nUpdated at 12.28pm BST\n\n\n 12.05pm  \nMikel Arteta named August manager of the month\n\nWell done, Mikel Arteta. Four wins from five, and Arsenal fans are now fully trusting the process. They play Brentford on Sunday, a fixture that brings back bad memories from last season.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.08pm BST\n\n\n 12.03pm  \n\nAnd more from Eddie Eddie Eddie from Louise Taylor, on the hopes of Callum Wilson making the World Cup squad. \n\nI feel for Callum because he\u2019s not in the England squad,\u201d said Newcastle\u2019s manager, who, conscious of the 30-year-old\u2019s tendency to pick up injuries, signed Alexander Isak for \u00a359m from Real Sociedad last month. \u201cBut it will just fuel his motivation, it will fire him even more, so when Callum returns to our team he will show how good he is.\nAlthough close to full fitness, Wilson is expected to miss out on Saturday\u2019s match with Howe\u2019s former club Bournemouth at St James\u2019 Park but should return after the international break.\nI think there\u2019s time for Callum to make the World Cup squad,\u2019 said Howe. \u201cAnd I know Gareth feels the same. What does he have to do? He has to return and score and be consistent in his availability. Maybe he has to have a bit of luck somewhere else to make that plane.\n\n\n\n\n\n 11.56am  \n\nEddie Howe has been speaking about injuries, and the arrival of Loris Karius at Newcastle after a freak injury to Karl Darlow. \n\nThe injury to Darlow is a real strange one. He was just training with the goalkeepers and twisted an ankle. So, of course, with that news and the squad being open at that stage we decided it was wise to bring in somebody with more experience to complement the keepers we have.\nLoris was the outstanding candidate when we looked at the goalkeepers available to us. He is a really good age and has had some incredible experiences in his career.\n\nBruno Guimaraes, Allan Saint-Maximin and Callum Wilson all have injury problems but Guimaraes is the likeliest to start against Bournemouth. \n\nNaturally when you have injuries like we did have, more time is beneficial but the circumstances around that game being cancelled were immensely sad.\n\n\n\n\n 11.44am  \n\nHere\u2019s our story on that Bournemouth takeover, penned by Ed Aarons. \n\nA group led by Foley, who is also chairman of the insurance company Fidelity National Financial and the investment company Cannae Holdings, is understood to have begun exclusive negotiations with Demin last week over a potential deal for the club, who were promoted from the Championship last season. Demin, who is Russia-born but a British citizen, has been the sole shareholder at Bournemouth since 2019, when he repurchased a 25% stake he had sold to the company PEAK6 Investments.\n\n\n\n\n\n 11.41am  \n\nWell, hello there, been a while since I manned the old banter blog, and we have an action-packed afternoon of news and views to come. Well, probably. \n\n\n\n 11.38am  \n\nPlenty more managers are shortly to have a little sit and a natter with the assembled media. John Brewin is a noted lover of this kind of thing, so he\u2019s insisted I depart and hand this blog over to him. Good day!\n\n\n\n 11.23am  \nErling Haaland is August's Premier League player of the month!\n\nNo roaring shock, there, is it? Nine goals from five league matches in August, including two hat-tricks for Manchester City\u2019s laughably effective Norwegian.\nHe\u2019s now up to 13 goals in all competitions this season. Anyone betting against him reaching a half-century at this point? I\u2019m certainly not.\n\n\nUpdated at 2.02pm BST\n\n\n 11.14am  \n\nInterim Bournemouth manager Gary O\u2019Neil, you should not be surprised to hear, hasn\u2019t got a huge amount to say about a potential takeover.\nHe said: \u201cObviously I am not involved in any discussions like that. I have been hard at work over on the other side, on the grass \u2026 My wife and kids will tell you, every minute of my day so far [since the postponed Brighton game] is Newcastle, either on a laptop or on the grass with the lads.\u201d\nAnd his findings before Saturday\u2019s trip to the north-east? \u201cNewcastle are a very good side. Every game I have watched, they have been on the front foot, aggressive and caused teams problems, so probably should have more points than they have. I would expect them to be high up the league this year.\u201d\nMidfielder David Brooks, who in May was given the all-clear to resume his playing career after stage-two Hodgkin lymphoma, is yet to feature this season and suffered a setback while playing for the club\u2019s under-21s.\nO\u2019Neil added: \u201cHe had some pain in his hamstring \u2026 it\u2019s not unusual for any player who has been off grass long-term. When players come back, there\u2019s always a spell where they need to get their body used to being on the grass. They have to adapt to the stresses of playing football every day. I am not surprised that it\u2019s happened, but I am disappointed for him. We were never going to rush him back, so we\u2019ll see how he is in the coming weeks.\u201d\n\n\n\n 11.05am  \n\nICYMI \u2026 here\u2019s Suzy Wrack\u2019s video primer on the new WSL season \u2026\n\n\n\n\n 11.03am  \n\nSpeaking yesterday, Southampton\u2019s Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl said it would have been understandable if this weekend\u2019s Premier League fixtures has also been postponed.\n\u201cIt was, for me, an absolutely clear decision not to play football last weekend and I would also completely understand if we wouldn\u2019t play this weekend because it\u2019s a special moment for this country.\u201d\nOf their trip to Villa, Hasenh\u00fcttl added: \u201cThey are full of high individual quality in the team. After a not so easy start, which is normal in the Premier League, they are starting to play better and I think the last game against Man City showed how good they can be at home.\n\u201cIt was maybe the worst away game we had last season and it\u2019s a good chance to show we can do it better.\u201d\nTino Livramento and Romeo Lavia remain on the injured list for the Saints.\n\n\n\n 10.59am  \n\nSteven Gerrard has some calls to make at Aston Villa, before tonight\u2019s match against Southampton. Ollie Watkins has been \u201ca little bit unwell\u201d, while his two main goalkeepers \u2013 Emiliano Mart\u00ednez and Robin Olsen \u2013 both missed training on Thursday. Gerrard was hopeful Mart\u00ednez \u201cwill pull through \u2026 I think he\u2019ll be available\u201d.\nGerrard added: \u201cWe\u2019re on the end of a real positive performance against Manchester City, a good strong team performance, and of course you want to back that up as soon as you can.\u201d\n\n\n\n 10.42am  \n\nImportant Ian Rush news: the former Chester and Sydney Olympic star has a whole new suit to don, having been appointed advisor and football ambassador by the Welsh FA \u201cwith a mission of promoting Welsh football on both the local and global stages\u201d.\nNow, cards on the table, Rushie is a personal hero \u2026 but let\u2019s be honest, he\u2019ll be going some to advance the cause for football in Wales any better than Michael Sheen managed this week \u2026\n\n\n\n\n 10.33am  \n\nConor Gallagher\u2019s adjustment back to life as a little fish continues \u2026 with word that he has been named as part of England\u2019s Under-21s squad for friendlies against Italy and Germany. The Chelsea player has just 158 minutes to his name in the league this season, having been so pivotal on his loan at Crystal Palace that led to his breakthrough in England\u2019s senior side.\nLiverpool\u2019s Harvey Elliott also features, along with Spurs\u2019 Ryan Sessegnon and Everton\u2019s Anthony Gordon.\nManager Lee Carsley said: \u201cWe welcome Conor Gallagher back to the group which is another example of us having a fluid pathway across our national teams. I know Conor will take to the pitch with as much pride in wearing an England shirt for the under-21s as he would for the seniors.\n\u201cHe \u2013 like all of our players \u2013 can continue to take comfort in the fact that Gareth will always keep one eye on their progress. There is no glass ceiling.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 10.37am BST\n\n\n 10.24am  \n\nBrighton manager Hope Powell, the former England coach, knows first-hand the trajectory the game has embarked on in recent decades. Of tonight\u2019s match, she said: \u201cIt\u2019s a sellout which is good for the women\u2019s game and good for us. I think the expectation would be for Arsenal to win the game \u2013 we\u2019re under no illusions there \u2013 but we\u2019re not going to give it to them. \n\u201cWe\u2019re going to make it very difficult and the plan is to get something out of the game as we do every game. A Friday night under the lights suits me perfectly.\u201d\n\n\n\n 10.22am  \n\nOver in the WSL, the managers for tonight\u2019s curtain-raiser at Meadow Park have been speaking. Arsenal\u2019s Jonas Eidevall said of their opponents, Brighton: \u201cI\u2019ve been very impressed by Brighton during the pre-season because I also saw that they had a huge turnover. \n\u201cI\u2019ve seen them play against Bayern Munich, Manchester City and us, and they looked like a good team in those games. Some of the players they got in over this window are really high quality, so we are expecting and preparing for a competitive game.\u201d\nEidevall also spoke about how the league must work to keep the momentum from the summer Euros: \u201cIn the end, it\u2019s about creating a product that means so much to people that you go there and you watch the game even if it\u2019s a snowstorm. \n\u201cYou go there and watch even if it\u2019s not convenient because you care so much about the team and you want to be there so much. We try to do our best on the pitch to create that.\u201d\n\n\n\n 10.18am  \n\nErik ten Hag says he will not take his foot off the gas despite an elongated break in the schedule for Manchester United. With their match against Leeds postponed this weekend, immediately followed by the international break, his side suddenly found themselves with a 17-day lull, following Thursday\u2019s Europa League win over Sheriff Tiraspol.\nNo let up for the manager, however, who said: \u201cWe have many meetings, we have to improve the structures in and around the club. We will also look to the window in January or next summer already and also to improve our way of playing by making plans.\u201d\nThey return from the break with the Manchester derby on 2 October, the first of what is scheduled to be 13 games in 43 days. \u201cIt\u2019s coming, a period with a game every third day and we have to get ready for that,\u201d Ten Hag said. \u201cThe players, 90% are away [on international duty], but the others we will train properly. We have to prepare very well. Then I hope that everyone stays fit, returns back healthy and then we have to get in to attack.\u201d\n\n\n\n 10.09am  \n\nDavid Moyes backs Jarrod Bowen to hit the giddy heights he managed last season in time for the Qatar World Cup. After 18 goals last season, the forward is yet to score in the league so far this season \u2013 his only strikes have come in the Europa Conference League.\nThe West Ham manager said: \u201cI\u2019m just beginning to see Jarrod getting back to it, there are little bits coming back \u2026 we\u2019re just beginning to see good signs from Jarrod and hopefully I\u2019m right.\u201d\nBowen is in England\u2019s squad along with Declan Rice, about whom Moyes lit up, raised an eyebrow and grinned approvingly (I imagine, I wasn\u2019t there).\nMoyes added: \u201cAt the start of last season after the Euros, I thought Declan Rice was fantastic, whereas a lot of the England players didn\u2019t find their levels quite as much, so it can happen. The international football, the little rest time you get during the summer can play a part in that.\n\u201cThe boys who were on international duty in the summer had a really late return, Declan especially \u2013 Declan had more time off to recover. I think most of our players played roughly 60 games last year, so our players have had a real busy time.\n\u201cFrom that point of view, we hope it will improve Declan but, on the other side of it, we\u2019re always trying to look after him as well.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 10.11am BST\n\n\n 9.58am  \n\nWith her post-Euros haze starting to dissipate, Suzy Wrack\u2019s back on the WSL beat \u2026 and she reckons it\u2019s all set for Chelsea v Arsenal for the title, with last season\u2019s third-place Manchester City vulnerable to the chasing pack, following a string of high-profile departures.\n\n\n\n\n 9.53am  \n\nHere are this morn\u2019s 10 things to look out for in this weekend\u2019s Premier League action \u2026\nFEATURING! A keeper conundrum for Steven Gerrard, Diego Costa\u2019s lupine love-in, plus fraying patience for Brendan Rodgers at the Foxes.\n\n\n\n\n 9.49am  \n\nNews to catch up on from late last night \u2026 manager-less Bournemouth are being eyed by a Las Vegas-led consortium. Intriguingly, if it was successful with a takeover, that would mean more than half of Premier League clubs had minority or majority US shareholders. Current owner Maxim Demin might have a decision to make with a \u00a3150m offer on the table.\n\n\n\n\n 9.30am  \nWSL waves hello again!\n\nHaving pulled its opening weekend in the wake of the Queen\u2019s death, the Women\u2019s Super League kicks off tonight with last season\u2019s just-pipped, Arsenal, hosting Hope Powell\u2019s Brighton.\nThe champions, Chelsea, kick off at promoted Birkenhead Liverpool on Sunday. Meanwhile, Aston Villa and Leicester showcase their teams at Villa Park and the King Power Stadium respectively, as clubs hope to capitalise on the post-Euros bounce with the first of what everyone hopes is an eventual move away from the increasingly patronising-looking Chigwell Construction Stadium/Kingsmeadow/Leigh Sports Village/Man City Academy Stadium merry-go-round.\nOn many levels, this looks like a HUGE season for the women\u2019s game in England!\nWSL fixtures\nFriday (all times BST)Arsenal v Brighton (Meadow Park, 7.30pm)\nSaturdayManchester United v Reading (Leigh Sports Village, 12noon)\nSundayAston Villa v Manchester City (Villa Park, 12.30pm)West Ham v Everton (Chigwell Construction Stadium, 3pm)Leicester v Tottenham (King Power Stadium, 3pm)Liverpool v Chelsea (Prenton Park, 5pm)\n\n\n\n 9.30am  \nPremier League preamble\n\nThe Premier League is back!

For example, the queue to file past Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s coffin in central London is now approaching five miles \u2026 which needs more than a little bit of managing.\nBrighton v Crystal Palace, however, had already been pushed back due to the planned rail strike \u2026 which has since been un-planned out of respect. Suffice to say that\u2019s a fixture that may also have seen the odd supporter needing a little talking-to from the girls and boys in blue, and it remains on the postponed list.\n\n"

                    "body": "Match of the tournament Netherlands v South Africa. The fact there is one very obvious answer \u2013 which we\u2019ll come to \u2013 means selecting anything else is a shock, which given that it was itself a shock, in a tournament full of shocks, seems appropriate. Highlights included probably the catch of the competition from Roelof van der Merwe, and the extraordinary conclusion to South Africa\u2019s doomed run chase, with Keshav Maharaj hopping slowly down the pitch on his only functioning leg, turning potential twos and threes into singles, while Pakistan and Bangladesh, who would both have been eliminated had South Africa won, sat in the same venue watching what had seemed a faint and distant hope become ever clearer and nearer. Star of the tournament Suryakumar Yadav, aka SKY, India\u2019s coming man at the age of 32 \u2013 incredibly, he made his international debut only last year \u2013 and a batter of mind-boggling brilliance. His innings in India\u2019s final game of the Super 12s, 61 off 25 balls against Zimbabwe, included the shot of the tournament: Richard Ngarava bowled a perfectly decent wide yorker and Yadav stretched, down on one knee, to not just reach it but somehow flick it over both his left shoulder and the square leg boundary for six.  Team of the tournament Alex Hales (England), Jos Buttler (England, captain), Virat Kohli (India), Suryakumar Yadav (India), Ben Stokes (England), Glenn Phillips (New Zealand), Rilee Rossouw (South Africa), Sam Curran (England), Shadab Khan (Pakistan), Shaheen Shah Afridi (Pakistan), Anrich Nortje (South Africa) Favourite moment The sound of the crowd in Adelaide while Rashid Khan took down Australia\u2019s death bowling, audibly undecided about whether to acclaim the performance of a great player, lovely bloke and adopted son of the city \u2013 Khan has played five Big Bash League seasons for the Adelaide Strikers \u2013 or to howl with anguish at what he was doing to their own team\u2019s crucial net run rate. To their great credit, most seemed to go with option one. Afghanistan\u2019s efforts to restrict Australia\u2019s NRR were such that Khan and Ireland\u2019s Lorcan Tucker both did more to help England to win the World Cup than several members of the actual England team. Most entertaining complaint During the group stages news leaked that India\u2019s players were fuming about the falafel and sandwiches laid on for them at training, with some said to have got takeaways delivered to the Sydney Cricket Ground to avoid having to eat it. \u201cI know all the teams are getting the same thing,\u201d a source told AFP, \u201cbut they are not speaking out because most of them are not in a position to raise a voice.\u201d I asked someone in the Ireland camp if their experience was similar and it turned out the AFP\u2019s source was half-right \u2013 they were getting the same thing, but the reason they were not speaking out was because they like sandwiches. Personal highlight The game between India and Pakistan was not just a compelling contest with incredible individual performances and a frankly ludicrous conclusion, it was one of the great sporting occasions \u2013 and it was only a group game. It wasn\u2019t even a decisive or, as it turned out, particularly important group game \u2013 both teams ended up in the last four, and the losers made the final \u2013 but for spectacle, intensity and atmosphere not even the final itself could match it, as 90,000 people combined to turn the city of Melbourne, and eventually the MCG, into a cauldron of noise, colour and joy. Biggest disappointment The Australian Bureau of Meteorology, whose forecast for final day in Melbourne was consistent for the entire preceding week: thunder, lightning, and rain from dawn to dusk. It was the only topic of conversation for days, as organisers were forced to schedule extra time on the reserve day and fears rose that the trophy would end up being shared. It rained for about 10 minutes. I can only assume it was a deliberate wind-up. What would you change for next time? At the England team hotel on the morning after the final I had the opportunity to hold and indeed lift the trophy. It\u2019s not very good. You would have thought a cricket World Cup would attempt to represent either cricket or the world, or perhaps even both, and to add insult to previous insult this one isn\u2019t even a cup. To be acceptable a sporting trophy must answer in the affirmative at least one of four key questions: Does it have particular historic importance? Is it incredibly pretty? Can you drink out of it? And can you put it on your head? Four blanks \u2013 get a new one."

                    "body": "\u201cAt least he\u2019s not tired,\u201d Didier Deschamps observed sardonically. It was September and Antoine Griezmann was in the latest circle of a recurring nightmare. Back at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid on loan after a gruesome two seasons at Barcelona, Griezmann found himself in the surreal position of being allowed to play only 30 minutes per game, lest an automatic buy clause in his deal be triggered. And so for several weeks, despite being fully fit, Griezmann would watch from the bench, before being wheeled out as a substitute on the hour mark.\nStill, you could rely on the France manager to put a positive spin on things. Of all the stalwarts of the Deschamps era, it is Griezmann with whom he seems to have the closest bond of all, an almost paternal connection that has held firm through the toughest of times. Even as Griezmann withered away at Barcelona, even as he languished on the bench in Madrid, even when it seemed as though the peak years of this extraordinary footballer were winnowing away, Deschamps\u2019 faith in his talismanic forward never wavered. Now, in their third World Cup together, we are seeing the results.\n\nQuietly, it is Griezmann and not Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 who has been France\u2019s most influential player in Qatar. Although unless you have been watching them closely, it may not necessarily be apparent why. Griezmann is yet to score a goal in this tournament. In fact, he has gone 10 games without scoring for his country. Four France players, including midfielder Adrien Rabiot, have taken more shots in this tournament. For a player third on his country\u2019s all-time scoring list, this may appear something of an anomaly.\nBut Griezmann has been doing a different kind of work here. Stationed in a sort of hybrid position between midfield and attack, Griezmann has made more key passes than any other player in the tournament. Meanwhile, among his teammates only Rabiot has made more blocks; only Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni and Dayot Upamecano have made more ball recoveries. In what many assumed to be the twilight of his career, Griezmann is subtly reinventing the No 10 role, doing the dirty work without sacrificing creative output. Or as Rapha\u00ebl Varane put it: \u201cHe has the ability to get others to play.\u201d\n\nAll of which means a player once feted in his prime as a potential challenger to the Messi/Ronaldo axis is quite willingly stepping away from the glory shift, serving the front three of Mbapp\u00e9, Olivier Giroud and Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9. \u201cI am not a player who will shoot 50 times a game,\u201d he said before France\u2019s 3-1 win over Poland in the last 16. \u201cI do not worry about the goal. The team needs me in the heart of the game, to be close to my defence when we don\u2019t have the ball.\u201d And in any case, Griezmann has also been a very reluctant sort of superstar.\nThere was a time when Team Griezmann seemed intent on burnishing his personal brand: adverts, endorsements, a documentary film, the much-ridiculed 2018 live television special The Decision in which he revealed that he was he was staying at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. But the gladrags of fame never really sat comfortably with a sensitive character largely unmoved by individual milestones, who has never felt the need to grasp the spotlight, who away from the pitch is at his most content playing computer games or tending to his growing stable of racehorses.\n\nThis may also explain why his \u00a3100m move to Barcelona fell flat: pitched to the club\u2019s fans as a new gal\u00e1ctico, perhaps even a replacement for Messi in time, Griezmann ended up submerging himself in the internal dysfunction at the club, unable to nail down a consistent role under a succession of coaches. And lest we forget, this is a player who learned his trade under Diego Simeone, where the idea that an individual suffers for the team is enshrined in the culture. Griezmann was never meant to be the guy. He was meant to be the guy the guy relies on.\nFittingly, then, it is under Simeone that the first shoots of a revival took shape. \u201cI had a hard time at Barcelona,\u201d Griezmann said this week. \u201cWhen I came back to Atl\u00e9tico, it was complicated. You had to make yourself small. I tried to find myself a little, on and off the pitch. Now, I\u2019m full of confidence. I feel good at the club and in the national team.\u201d\n\nAnd now, back in the loving embrace of Deschamps, who has given him 71 international caps in a row, Griezmann has moved into a new phase of his career. In the absence of N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9, France needed a player who could run and hustle, disrupt and win the ball high up the pitch. Deschamps realised that the way to get the best out of a struggling Griezmann was not to take away responsibility, but to give him more. \u201cI owe him everything,\u201d Griezmann said of his coach. \u201cEvery action is like a thank you that I send to him.\u201d Against Poland he ran an epic 11.3km. Perhaps, when Deschamps quipped about his lack of game time keeping him fresh, he wasn\u2019t joking.\nTo Al Khor, then, and a match against England that is already painted in a particular direction. How can England stop Mbapp\u00e9? Will Kyle Walker be able to handle the pace of Mbapp\u00e9? Do England have any special plans for Mbapp\u00e9? How can England restrict the service to Mbapp\u00e9? Of course, all this suits France just fine. In fact, the most crucial duel on the pitch will be between Griezmann and Declan Rice, the man who will probably be given the job of keeping him quiet. So yes, do keep an eye on Mbapp\u00e9 on Saturday night. But if England get sucked in to a one-man demolition job, they may well be in for a nasty surprise."

                    "body": "For the first time in his rugby league career, Jack Welsby will feel at home on Saturday in the town which is so close to his heart. The 21-year-old, arguably the most mercurial talent to play for the national side for a decade, is as proud a Wiganer as you are likely to find despite the fact he has become a star for their great rivals over the Billinge Hill, St Helens.\nHe cites the likes of the Wigan Athletic cult hero Ben Watson and current England teammate and former Wigan Warriors star Sam Tomkins as his childhood heroes. But whenever Welsby has returned to Wigan as a player, he has been firmly in enemy territory given the huge rivalry between the two towns of Wigan and St Helens, where Welsby is now adored and adopted as one of their own.\n\nBut on Saturday, Welsby will take to the field at the DW Stadium with a home crowd behind him for the first time as England look to book their place in the Rugby League World Cup semi-finals with victory against Papua New Guinea. It is a moment the boyhood Wigan fan has waited some time to experience. \u201cI\u2019ve never hidden away from the fact I\u2019m a Wigan lad,\u201d Welsby says, smiling. \u201cI love my town and I love Wigan. I love playing at the DW with the crowd behind you, so it\u2019s going to be pretty special. I\u2019ve been there so many times, and to be running out there for England is amazing.\u201d\nWelsby spent his childhood supporting Wigan before being signed by their great rivals, St Helens, as a teenager. He says his family, who will all be in attendance on Saturday, have shifted their allegiance to the Saints like he has.\nHis career has been on a remarkable trajectory since his debut as a 17-year-old in 2018. He is still associated with the try that won St Helens the Super League Grand Final in the dying seconds against Wigan in 2020 and now is seen as England\u2019s best hope of delivering success on the international stage in this year\u2019s World Cup with his undoubted natural ability.\nOff the field, Welsby is quiet and fairly low-key in the way he speaks. On it, he is the most talented player to pull on an England shirt since his childhood hero \u2013 and the man he will share the field with on Saturday afternoon \u2013 Tomkins. \u201cI just try to play like I\u2019m playing with my mates,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m pretty relaxed.\n\u201cI was nervous for the Samoa game because it was my [Test] debut but ever since then I\u2019ve just relaxed into it. I just enjoy it. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve been doing since I was little, so I don\u2019t really see the point in getting nervous \u2013 it\u2019s just a game of rugby at the end of the day. I just love playing rugby, and I always have no matter who it\u2019s for.\u201d Welsby\u2019s relaxed attitude will be tested on Saturday against a physical and imposing Papua New Guinea side who caught the eye in the group stage.\n\nEngland will still be expected to progress given the way they have acquitted themselves in the tournament thus far, but the Kumuls will cause the hosts one or two problems without question. Welsby, however, is already cautiously casting one eye beyond the quarter-finals and towards a tilt at rugby league history.\n\u201cThis is definitely the pinnacle of my career so far,\u201d he says. \u201cIt has been pretty special and I\u2019ve really enjoyed it, but we\u2019ve got a couple more stepping stones to go and win it. It\u2019s something we\u2019ve all got in the back of our minds and something we are all aiming for.\n\u201cI never imagined playing for England at this point in my career. I\u2019ve loved every minute of it. The support has been brilliant and I just want us to keep building and keep getting better. I think there is still more in this group and we\u2019ve got the perfect opportunity on Saturday to prove it.\u201d And for all his happy childhood memories supporting Wigan Warriors and Wigan Athletic, watching England narrowly miss out on success as a youngster is one uncomfortable memory Welsby is desperate to put right over the next few weeks.\n\n\u201cThe Shaun Johnson try [that knocked England out of the 2013 World Cup], that\u2019s pretty self-explanatory,\u201d he says.\n\u201cI loved watching England as a kid because it never came round a lot. There\u2019s obviously been some near misses and while I remember the Wigan moments from my childhood, we\u2019ve not really had too many big moments as a nation to cheer about, have we? Hopefully we can go on and make one to remember this year.\u201d\n"

                    "body": "Robert Page has said Gareth Bale will have to find a club sympathetic to his needs if the Wales captain is to arrive at the World Cup in peak condition. Page said he will discuss with Bale and Aaron Ramsey next week how they intend to resolve their uncertain club futures. Bale is a free agent after departing Real Madrid and Ramsey has a year on his contract at Juventus, who sanctioned what proved to be a fruitless loan to Rangers in January. The Wales manager said it would be unrealistic for Bale to lead the team in Qatar without signing for a club because \u201call the training in the world\u201d does not replicate match fitness.  Page allows Bale and Ramsey to follow individual training programmes but admitted club managers may be reluctant to allow the same degree of licence. \u201cClubs must be looking at them and thinking: \u2018How can they do that for their country?\u2019\u201d Page said. \u201cIt is a common-sense approach for us. It is hard when you\u2019re trying to create that environment at club level, when you\u2019ve got other world-class players around you. We haven\u2019t got 10 Gareth Bales in that [Wales] changing room. It is harder to do that [at club level]; you do have to have that sort of \u2018throw the blanket over all of the players, this is how we\u2019re going to train today\u2019. \u201cThat is going to be his [Bale\u2019s] difficulty, finding someone that will manage him. He has to take that responsibility himself and that will determine whether he plays a lot of football because if he\u2019s not able to train like that through the week the manager at the respective club might not want to select him on the weekend. He understands what he needs to do.  \u201cGareth\u2019s problems in the past have been when he\u2019s not been playing week in, week out, and for the Belarus game he came into camp undercooked and ended up getting a little tweak in his calf, so he understands he needs to play. It is up to him and his family to decide on where is best for him to get in the right frame of mind for November, it\u2019s going to be as simple as that, and it might even be as short term as that.\u201d Bale played 22 minutes for Real between Wales\u2019 playoff semi-final win against Austria in March and the victory against Ukraine in the final on Sunday and Ramsey struggled for game time at Rangers, for whom he missed the decisive penalty in the Europa League final against Eintracht Frankfurt. \u201cAt the end of the camp, at the end of the last game, I will have that conversation,\u201d Page said when asked about Ramsey\u2019s future. \u201cThey\u2019re experienced players and they\u2019ll know what\u2019s best for themselves. If he has to go back and do a pre-season to see where he is at, then he\u2019ll probably do that and make that decision before the [transfer] window closes, to get out and maybe have another loan move or whatever.\u201d  Nottingham Forest\u2019s Brennan Johnson will start for Wales in their Nations League match at home against the Netherlands on Wednesday. He was wanted by several Premier League clubs in January, including Brentford, but stayed to win promotion with his boyhood club via the Championship playoff final. \u201cI always believed in myself and to do it with Forest is just so much better \u2013 it is what I wanted,\u201d Johnson, 21, said. \u201cTo play in the Premier League this season is definitely something I felt like I had to be doing and in terms of my Wales career as well I think it puts me in a really good stead to get into the team. Going into a Premier League season with a World Cup, it is another real test that I can\u2019t wait for.\u201d"

The celebrations were still pretty muted, and not just because the Cottagers fans\u2019 genteel reputation precedes them. The club\u2019s last two promotions to the Premier League were followed by immediate relegation, and so finishing 17th or higher would be viewed as a resounding success.\n\nCraven Cottage will have a different look, the towering Riverside Stand finally open for business, though initially only the lower tier, as the owner, Shahid Khan, modernises the chintzy, beloved stadium. High ticket prices to pay for the renovations have become a battleground between fans and Khan.\nThe cost can climb as high as \u00a3100 for a single match ticket for the opener with Liverpool, asking a great deal of fans when Marco Silva, the manager, has admitted the label of a \u201cyo-yo team\u201d is a \u201cgood nickname\u201d. Last season was enjoyable, a breeze back up, but Silva will be without Fabio Carvalho, sold to Liverpool, a main supplier of Aleksandar Mitrovic\u2019s record haul of 43 Championship goals, though Harry Wilson remains.\nIt is in neither Silva nor Fulham\u2019s makeup to play percentage football, and that high-paying public have come to expect entertainment. Khan will likely not match the ill-starred \u00a3100m of spending of the summer of 2018, and has spoken of needing to \u201chave a different approach than one of the bigger clubs\u201d. The hope is Silva has enough nous and his players can find enough quality to break the cycle of promotion followed by demotion.\n\nThe manager\nIt is only five years since Silva\u2019s arrival at Hull caused consternation in the Sky Soccer Saturday studio, and he is set to manage his fourth Premier League club with his reputation still very much mixed. Each of his spells at Hull, Watford and Everton showed that Silva can be an innovative, organised and attacking coach, only for his team to drop away into inconsistency. Silva himself is not someone given to backslapping the media, usually choosing to keep his own, quiet counsel. Fulham having blasted their way up from the Championship, their manager has just as much to prove as his club when it comes to staying power. To meet his ambitions, he needs to gain a reputation for stability and longevity but is working under an owner in Khan who has never been shy of pressing the button.\n\nTransfer coup\nFulham\u2019s summer transfer activity has not been brisk but in signing a defensive midfielder in Jo\u00e3o Palhinha from Silva\u2019s native Portugal, at least some of their soft underbelly may have been protected. Palhinha, as a leading light in a Sporting Lisbon team that won a first title in 19 years, has a reputation as an enforcer, with the powerful physique and classic tactical awareness of a Portuguese midfielder. A close relationship with R\u00faben Amorim, who had coached him on loan at Braga, revived his career at Sporting. Fulham paid \u00a318m for a player previously linked with the Portuguese enclave at Wolves.\nWorld Cup impact\nWith a squad not laden with players likely to be jetting off, the timing of the World Cup could be useful in Fulham\u2019s expected battle for safety, though Palhinha seems set to be involved with Portugal. Tim Ream, the veteran US defender, played only one international match last season, and may miss out on Qatar. Fulham\u2019s pre-tournament fixtures are not kind; they sign off for the break with matches against Manchester City and Manchester United.\n\nAlternative attractions during World Cup\nTake a wintry stroll through Bishops Park, sip expensive coffee, take in Putney\u2019s throbbing nightlife, including a few pints in the Spotted Horse, watch the rowers fly down the Thames, and various other bourgeois pursuits on offer in the comfortable surroundings of SW6.\nLeading the shirt sales\nIn blowing away Guy Whittingham\u2019s 29-year-old Championship scoring record, Mitrovic confirmed his cult reputation. Silva\u2019s demand that he keep fit over last summer clearly paid high dividends. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have any paunch on him or anything,\u201d said an admiring Khan, who has termed Mitro a \u201clegend\u201d. Like his club, Mitrovic has the reputation of being too good for the Championship yet short of Premier League quality, though he seems to have a better relationship with Silva than predecessor Scott Parker, with whom he fell out during the club\u2019s last Premier League season.\nSocial climber\nFulham\u2019s players are pretty well behaved on the socials, but central defender Tosin Adarabioyo likes to share a bit of himself across Twitter and Instagram, and is making tentative steps into TikTok. He shares bespoke artwork that resembles 1990s rap album covers, including the time-honoured \u201cParental Guidance\u201d label and cigars, and pays regular tribute to Nigerian megastar Burna Boy. There\u2019s also some pointed football business retweets, including some NFT content, but he also marks himself out as a big team player, and particularly as a fan of \u201cMitro\u201d at \u201conly 27 years young\u201d.\n\nIf Fulham were a Netflix dox \u2026\nWe\u2019d see Shahid Khan and son Tony very much to the fore, their NFL ownership teaching them the value of camera time and big-boy talk. The set pieces may include Marco Silva promising \u201cMitro\u201d an extra day off if he presses harder during the vital derby battle with Brentford, and Tim Ream recording his podcast. Expect pointless cameos from Richard Osman and Hugh Grant."

At his likely price, which will also feel the effects of his rider\u2019s popularity with the punters, Dermot Weld\u2019s gelding looks like a favourite to oppose.\nThe Grand Visir, a two-length runner-up 12 months ago and 7lb better off with the winner, is likely to have been aimed at this from a long way out and makes some each-way appeal at a big price.\nRajinsky (3.15), though, is in better form coming into Friday\u2019s race, has an obvious chance on his win at Ascot in October and, as a clincher, the excellent apprentice Harry Davies taking 7lb off his back. He also has an excellent pitch in stall one and looks overpriced at around 12-1 in the early betting.\nChester 1.30: Repertoire is hardly maximum-bet material as he can be slow to stride at times and is also 5lb out of the handicap here. There was nothing wrong with his six-length win at Ascot last month, though, a performance that was backed up by the time and he remains on a fair mark on that form.\nMarket Rasen 1.50: Railway Muice was a ready winner of an amateurs\u2019 event over course and distance last month and has decent prospects from a 7lb higher mark.\nChester 2.05: This could be the season when Brentford Hope finally fulfils the promise of his winning debut as a juvenile in 2019. His placed form in Pattern events last season suggests he could be up to defying top weight here.\n\nChester 2.40: Majestic Dawn is the only regular frontrunner and 5-1 in a four-strong field will look big if he gets an easy time of it in front.\nChester 2.45: The Queen\u2019s useful sprinter King\u2019s Lynn goes well fresh and would be giving more weight to most of these rivals in a handicap.\nStar Of India surges into O\u2019Brien\u2019s Derby reckoning\nThe guessing game over how many runners Aidan O\u2019Brien will field in the Derby continued here on Thursday as his colt Star Of India powered home in the Dee Stakes and, barring mishaps, surely booked his place in the Classic. The son of Galileo, already the sire of four of O\u2019Brien\u2019s record eight Derby winners, is now top-priced at 16-1 to win at Epsom next month, joining his stable companions Luxembourg, Point Lonsdale and Changingoftheguard near the top of the ante-post market.\nO\u2019Brien\u2019s willingness to run any trial winner with the right pedigree in the Epsom Classics makes sense as at this time of year his stable is always full of three-year-olds with impeccable 12-furlong pedigrees that have yet to be fully tested at the Derby trip.\nStar Of India\u2019s win at 10 furlongs certainly suggested plenty more improvement to come when he steps up to a mile-and-a-half. Ryan Moore\u2019s mount had a couple of lengths to find on the leaders on the home turn and took several strides to find top gear but once he was up to speed Star Of India surged to the front and was still finding more as he hit the line with just over two lengths to spare.\n\nMoore has ridden three of O\u2019Brien\u2019s Derby candidates \u2013 Luxembourg and Changingoftheguard are the others \u2013 in the space of six days, but he was reluctant to offer any comparisons with several more Classic trials still to be run over the next few days.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a nice horse and it was only his third run, so that was a good performance,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s still learning and things were happening a little quick for him in places, but he got it done well in the end. I think he\u2019ll improve as he\u2019s a very laid-back horse.\n\u201cIt was a big learning curve. He ran in a straight line at Newmarket and then he\u2019s gone round a bend today. He\u2019s in the mix with the others and he\u2019ll get better, I\u2019ve no doubt about that.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t compare him with yesterday\u2019s winner [Changingoftheguard] as they\u2019re slightly different horses. Yesterday\u2019s was very impressive, but the way this race was run meant that he couldn\u2019t be impressive.\u201d\nWhen asked if either of his Chester trial winners would compare favourably with Luxembourg, third home in the 2,000 Guineas, Moore retreated into the weighing room.\nLuxembourg remains 3-1 favourite for the Derby before Lingfield\u2019s Derby Trial on Saturday, when Charlie Appleby\u2019s Walk Of Stars, an 11-1 shot for Epsom, will head a five-runner field."

Vialli was unique in many ways but this, alas, isn\u2019t one of them. He is one of nine players, eight of whom spent time at either Ajax or Juventus, who got their hands on all three big European trophies before the Cup Winners\u2019 Cup was discontinued in 1999. The first to complete the set were the great Juventus trio of Antonio Cabrini, Gaetano Scirea and Marco Tardelli. They won the Uefa Cup in 1977, the Cup Winners\u2019 Cup in 1984 and then \u2013 famously, tragically \u2013 the European Cup at Heysel in 1985. Subsequent players to do this particular treble are Arnold M\u00fchren (Ajax and Ipswich, 1973-87), Sergio Brio and Stefano Tacconi (Juventus, 1984-90), Danny Blind (Ajax, 1987-95), Vialli (Sampdoria and Juventus, 1990-96) and finally V\u00edtor Ba\u00eda (Barcelona and Porto, 1997-2004). Ba\u00eda lifted the Champions League and Uefa Cup after the Cup Winners\u2019 Cup \u2013 which he won with Barcelona in 1997 \u2013 had been dropped from the calendar.  One other player, whose son was later brought to Chelsea by Vialli, deserves a mention. The Milan goalkeeper Fabio Cudicini, father of Carlo, won the European Cup and Cup Winners\u2019 Cup in the late 1960s. Before that he was part of the Roma team that lifted the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1960-61. Some people regard that competition as a forerunner of the Uefa Cup; some don\u2019t. But appropriately enough for a man who had some serious ups and downs in European finals, Vialli does hold one record. In the prime of his career he played in seven European finals in 10 years, and he\u2019s the only man to appear on the winning and losing side in the final of all three major European competitions. Vialli\u2019s full record was: 1988-89: Cup Winners\u2019 Cup final lost Barcelona 2-0 Sampdoria. 1989-90: Cup Winners\u2019 Cup final win Sampdoria 2-0 Anderlecht (Vialli scored both).  1991-92: European Cup final lost Barcelona 1-0 Sampdoria (Vialli missed some excellent chances in his last game for the losing side). 1992-93: Uefa Cup final win Borussia Dortmund 1-6 Juventus (agg score). 1994-95: Uefa Cup final lost Parma 2-1 Juventus (agg; Vialli scored Juve\u2019s goal). 1995-96: Champions League final won Ajax 1-1 Juventus (2-4 pens; Vialli captained Juventus to glory in his final game for the club). 1997-98: Cup Winners\u2019 Cup final won Chelsea 1-0 Stuttgart (Vialli, by now player-manager, played the whole game and then gave a breathless, typically infectious interview). Getting them in early \u201cWhat\u2019s the most first-half goals there have been in a game where the second half was scoreless? I know it\u2019s common for games to be bottom-stacked but I can\u2019t think of any top-stacked examples offhand,\u201d tweets @yesthatsatwitr. A couple of Premier League ding-dongs come to mind, the first one of the many bonkers games in Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s final season as Manchester United manager. \u201cProbably loads higher, but the Reading v United match from 2012-13 was 3-4 at half-time and full-time,\u201d suggests Mike. \u201cSticks in my mind because both teams led twice before half-time.\u201d The scoring sequence at the Madejski Stadium was 1-0, 1-1, 1-2, 2-2, 3-2, 3-3, 3-4, with Robin van Persie eventually scoring a first-gasp winner in the 34th minute.  The other Premier League game with seven first-half goals involved teams managed by \u2013 and you\u2019ll like this \u2013 Roy Hodgson and George Graham. Two of the best defensive coaches around watched Blackburn lose 4-3 at home to Leeds in September 1997, a game full of belting goals. All seven were scored not just in the first half, but in the first 33 minutes, one fewer than in the Reading game mentioned. Leeds led 2-0 and then 4-2 before Martin Dahlin scored the seventh and final goal. You don\u2019t need a stratospheric IQ to imagine the tenor of Hodgson and Graham\u2019s half-time team talks.  Next to the Bundesliga, where Leverkusen plugged Frankfurt 6-1 in May 2019, a game that included a second-minute goal from then-teenage midfielder Kai Havertz. Seven is the best we could find, but there a few six-goal first halves worth mentioning: Aston Villa\u2019s 5-1 win over the champions Liverpool in December 1976, Bournemouth\u2019s 3-3 draw with Watford in January 2019 and Roma\u2019s 5-1 win at Bologna in December 2020. Super Mario time \u201cWho is the oldest surviving member of a World Cup-winning team? I assume that it was Pel\u00e9 (17 in 1958). If it was, who is it now; are there any survivors from 1950 or 54?\u201d tweets Jimmy M. Thanks to Andy Brook for doing the sour metres on this one. The oldest living World Cup winner \u2013 both as a player and a manager \u2013 is the remarkable M\u00e1rio Zagallo, who turned 91 in August. Zagallo was an integral part of the teams that won in 1958 and 1962, doing the work of two men on the left and effectively allowing Brazil to play a 4-3-4 formation. He then coached the greatest team of all to glory in 1970 and returned to take Brazil to the final in 1998.  At 85, England\u2019s Sir Bobby Charlton is the second-oldest living World Cup winner. Brito, who played centre-back for Brazil in 1970, is 83. Amarildo, who scored in the 1962 final for Brazil, is 82, a year older than Sir Geoff Hurst (England, 1966) and G\u00e9rson (Brazil, 1970).  Wet and riled \u201cAfter nearly a lifetime of winter quagmires, we are now used to \u2018bowling green\u2019 pitches throughout the Premier League season. But when was the last Premier League game postponed due to a waterlogged pitch?\u201d asks Peter Clarke. The most recent example we can find is Sunderland v Reading in the 2012-13 season. But what\u2019s especially \u2013 OK, vaguely \u2013 interesting is that the game was called off because of a waterlogged pitch in August.  The referee, Neil Swarbrick, decided to postpone the match around 80 minutes before the scheduled kick-off. \u201cThe pools of water were getting larger and longer and the managers agreed that the game should be called off,\u201d Swarbrick said. \u201cIt would have just been a farce.\u201d It was eventually played in mid-December, when conditions were more playable, and Sunderland won 3-0. Knowledge archive \u201cLeeds haven\u2019t had a penalty in 44 games,\u201d asked @smw30 in 2018. \u201cIs that a record?\u201d It wasn\u2019t even a Yorkshire record. \u201cMy team Sheffield United beat it in 1991 and 1992,\u201d explained Darren White. \u201cUnited were awarded a penalty on 23 March 1991 at Wimbledon and didn\u2019t get another one until the first ever Premier League game \u2013 at home to Manchester United \u2013 on Aug 1992. That\u2019s 50 games without a penalty. Incidentally, Brian Deane scored both.\u201d Two summers earlier, the England team ended a remarkable 53-game run without being awarded a penalty \u2013 a spell that lasted four and a half years. Bryan Robson scored one in Israel on 26 February 1986, and that was it until the World Cup quarter-final against Cameroon on 1 July 1990. No wonder Gary Lineker was so nervous: it was his first penalty for England, in his 56th game. He equalised with seven minutes remaining, and then scored another penalty to win the match in extra time. Insert your own London buses joke here.  Chris Rawson also wrote in to say that Burnley were on a run of 47 games without a penalty, while Sean DeLoughry had an even better example. \u201cGalway United,\u201d began Sean, \u201ccan push the record up to an impressive 72 games.\u201d  Can you help? \u201cA couple of years ago I came across a photo showing a dinosaur mascot at Bolton\u2019s Burnden Park, apparently from 1926,\u201d begins Matt Prescott. \u201cDoes anyone know which British team was the first to adopt a man-in-a-suit football mascot and was there a definitive year when it happened?\u201d   \u201cThe 44-year-old Gianluigi Buffon seems to be completing what one might describe as a palindromic career by returning to his first club. His career progression reads: Parma \u2013 Juventus \u2013 PSG \u2013 Juventus \u2013 Parma. Are there any other footballers or managers who can better that record?\u201d asks George Garrett.  \u201cWrexham\u2019s third goal against Coventry in the FA Cup came from a throw-in and four consecutive headers. This means five different players touched the ball without it hitting the ground before it went in the net. Is this some sort or record?\u201d wonders Roger Kirkby.  \u201cWith Wout Weghourst potentially being loaned from Burnley to Manchester United, can anyone think of any other examples of a team in a lower division loaning a player to a club in a higher division? If so, what is the biggest gap?\u201d asks Fabian Wood.  \u201cWho has the most \u2018goal of the month\u2019 nominations without actually winning one?\u201d enquires Masai Graham.

                    "body": "Igor Stimac, a 54-year-old Croatian man usually full of laughter and love, begins to cry as his memories grip him in a world darkened again by a devastating war. The fleeting tears of the former footballer fall for Ukraine and its people. They have suffered in a way that reminds Stimac of everything his own country endured during the terrible Balkans conflict that surrounded its independence from Yugoslavia almost 30 years ago. It was a time when football gained a rare real-life significance as, out of bloodshed and carnage, Croatia\u2019s defiant, gifted and fiercely intelligent players lifted their young nation by lighting up Euro 96 and then leading France in the semi-finals of the 1998 World Cup in Paris. Croatia\u2019s first international match in the modern era had occurred less than eight years before, in October 1990. Stimac played 53 times for Croatia before becoming their manager while Slaven Bilic, his centre-back partner, won 44 caps and managed the national team from 2006 to 2012. They both believe Croatia could have become European and world champions despite their country having just gained freedom. They were driven by a deeper purpose than ordinary ambition. \u201cWe were not just playing for ourselves or even Croatia,\u201d the 53-year-old Bilic says. \u201cWe were playing for the people who died.\u201d Stimac and Bilic, alongside their friends and teammates Zvonimir Boban, Davor Suker and Robert Prosinecki, have contributed to a riveting and moving documentary made by Louis Myles about this era of Croatian football. \u201cI was very emotional,\u201d Stimac says of his involvement in the film. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel good going back to that time because, whenever anyone brings me back to those days, it\u2019s suffering again.\u201d  Bilic and Stimac grew up in Split, in communist Yugoslavia, alongside other Croats but also people who would become citizens of Serbia, Slovenia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Kosovo. \u201cI had a great childhood,\u201d Bilic stresses. \u201cIt\u2019s easy now to say everything negative about Yugoslavia. But we had a great education, played football in the streets and it was unbelievably safe. Split is a beautiful town, a sporty town, and we were not aware of anything else.\u201d Stimac, who is a year older than Bilic, felt the same: \u201cWe had nothing to worry about because our parents protected us from talk of politics.\u201d On 4 May 1980 the death of President Tito shocked all of Yugoslavia \u2013 which had been reconstituted in the aftermath of the second world war. Tito had ruled over the different groups of people in communist Yugoslavia from its inception, first as prime minister and then as president. Bilic was a ballboy at a Hajduk Split match that day and he remembers how the game was abandoned once the news broke: \u201cI was only 11 and a half, but I could tell people were scared to death. I\u2019m not saying Tito was popular but he was extremely powerful, so people were afraid for their families and futures.\u201d Tito\u2019s demise left a vacuum which nationalist forces exploited. Yugoslavia had also been a more liberal country compared with neighbouring communist countries who were under the Soviet Union\u2019s shadow and, as Bilic explains, \u201cwe were not like Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, those stricter countries. We were in-between. We watched FA Cup finals from England on television and my father bought AC/DC and Iron Maiden LPs which you couldn\u2019t buy in Hungary or Czechoslovakia. Of course we were not allowed to talk openly like the Serbs and it was illegal for us to be nationalists. I remember us singing Croatian songs like they were forbidden fruits because, at that age, you like to be a rebel.\u201d Bilic blossomed as a young defender but, as he says, \u201cI never played for Yugoslavia under-16s, under-17s or under-18s. I wasn\u2019t [Franz] Beckenbauer or Bobby Moore but I was good. We had a manager from Serbia and he pulled me aside and said: \u2018Your family is labelled.\u2019\u201d He is keen to stress he was not a martyr. Other Croatian players, especially the obviously great ones like Boban, were picked by Yugoslavia. Admitting that he only learned of his father\u2019s work with nationalist groups in later years, Bilic stresses that there was \u201cnothing extreme about my dad\u2019s views\u201d and he concentrates instead on the quality of Yugoslavian football. Players were not allowed to go abroad until they were 28 and so the standard of the league was not far behind the best in Europe. There was a dynamism and flair to their football which meant Yugoslavia were often acclaimed as \u201cthe Brazil of Europe\u201d. A remarkable crop of talented players also elevated their generation. Bilic and Stimac talk poetically about the beauty of Prosinecki\u2019s play, of Boban\u2019s drive and leadership and Suker\u2019s lethal finishing. They were united, too, by unbreakable friendship. Stimac was part of the Yugoslavia Under-20 team who won the Youth World Championship in Chile in October 1987. Prosinecki and Boban were the stars of a side that featured six Croats in their starting lineup. Yugoslavia began by trouncing the hosts 4-2 in front of 67,000, won all their group games and beat Brazil in the quarter-finals. A key moment then occurred as Stimac and Boban had an opportunity to go out with two Chilean models. \u201cWe were young boys enjoying life,\u201d Stimac says with a grin. \u201cWe were expecting permission from our coach to go out for a drink with these beautiful girls but when the answer was \u2018no\u2019 it was difficult to accept. I said to Boban: \u2018I\u2019m going.\u2019 He said: \u2018I\u2019m joining you.\u2019 \u201cWhen the coach found out he told us we were going home. East Germany, with Matthias Sammer as captain, were waiting in the semi-final. To send us home for nothing was not good. But the team stood by us. They said to the coach: \u2018If they go home, we are going too.\u2019 The coach had to give in.\u201d Yugoslavia eventually beat West Germany in the final and Stimac is certain that bond strengthened the team spirit that elevated Croatia at Euro 96 and at the World Cup in 1998. \u201cWe had friendship, loyalty and respect. We admired each other, and were never jealous, even with such big egos and heroes in the team.\u201d War, however, was looming. After the Berlin Wall came down in November 1989, nationalism in eastern Europe intensified. Croatia\u2019s first democratic elections were held in May 1990 and independence seemed an enticing reality. But tensions deepened as Serbia reacted with forceful aggression. A few days later, on 13 May, Dinamo Zagreb played Red Star Belgrade. Dinamo were the most fervent nationalist team in Croatia while Red Star were the powerhouse of Serbian football. The match had to be abandoned after 10 minutes when the Zagreb fans were attacked in their own stadium by the Red Star Ultras \u2013 most of whom came from the Serbian military and were led by Zelijko Raznatovic, who became the infamous Arkan, a murderous paramilitary during the Balkan conflict. As the battle raged in the stadium a policeman assaulted a Croatian fan. Boban, who captained Dinamo, was incensed and launched a flying kick at the policeman as he became a symbol of Croatian defiance against Serbia on the brink of war.  \u201cIt was all planned by the Serbs,\u201d Stimac says. \u201cEven the war criminal Arkan said they organised themselves so they could provoke incidents and then point fingers at Croatian nationalism. We are very similar, me and Boban, because when we feel injustice we are ready to die. Boban was defending the boys who were maltreated by the military police. Most of those guys were Serbian and they allowed the Red Star fans to do whatever they liked in a Croatian stadium.\u201d Boban was suspended from the national team for six months and missed the 1990 World Cup in Italy. Yugoslavia lost on penalties to Argentina in the quarter-finals in their final major tournament. Their place at the 1992 European Championship was taken by Denmark who, despite being late replacements, won the tournament. Before then, on 8 May 1991, the last cup final was played in Yugoslavia. Red Star Belgrade, who beat Marseille in the European Cup final later that month, faced a Hajduk Split team featuring Bilic and Stimac. \u201cI was the captain,\u201d Stimac remembers, \u201cand the big question was: \u2018Are we even playing?\u2019 First for security reasons and second because it was obvious the Yugoslavian league was ending. Should we participate in that cup final for the last time? When the decision was made and the army transporter flew us to Belgrade we knew what we needed to do. We played a magnificent game.\u201d Bilic says: \u201cI was shocked we were going to play in light of what happened in Zagreb in 1990. It was very hostile and boiling and on television every day we heard the Serbs were in Croatia and Slovenia. We were always big rivals but that season Red Star were better than us. They would soon become European champions but we felt like we were playing for Croatia against Serbia. We won, of course, and that cup is treated like a war trophy.\u201d The Croatian war of independence cost an estimated 20,000 lives. It was ultimately overshadowed by the 98,000 people who died in Bosnia. But Bilic and Stimac cannot forget the horrific massacre of Vukovar in November 1991 when the Yugoslav People\u2019s Army, the JNA, handed over Croatian civilians and prisoners of war to Serbian paramilitaries. \u201cIf we depended on Europe we wouldn\u2019t be alive,\u201d Stimac says. \u201cIt was only because of our Croatian hearts and wonderful young boys who lost their lives that we exist as a country today.\u201d  Stimac is an engaging man, who now manages India\u2019s national team, but his pain bursts open when he considers the parallels and contrasts with Ukraine today. \u201cIt\u2019s the same but there\u2019s a huge difference. All the world stands by Ukraine. No one stood by us. No one wanted Croatia to become independent. Europe and the world needed Yugoslavia as a flexible communist country, as a peace shield. What kind of help did we get? There were guys selling us pistols for $1,000 to defend against tanks and planes. \u201cBut I have fears now for Ukraine\u2019s people. They are suffering, they are dying. It\u2019s an injustice what is happening there now. The whole world should fight that. I remember how it felt for us in Croatia, so I know how Ukraine needs us.\u201d Stimac chokes back the tears and he remembers how the city of Vukovar withstood a Serbian siege which lasted three months with day after day of bombardment. Stimac suggests Vukovar \u201chad great importance in keeping the Croatian spirit alive and showing that no army can defeat us. Resisting for three months in a blocked city, being bombed from each side? That is heroism.\u201d Croatia\u2019s leading footballers were instructed to keep playing so they could inspire their people. And so, rather than fighting in a war zone, Bilic remembers hearing the distant sound of grenades and gunfire while he and Stimac defended their goal. When the war finally ended in victory for Croatia in 1995, with independence and their borders guaranteed, the national team were managed by the brilliant Miroslav \u201cCiro\u201d Blazevic. From the silk scarf he wore to his inspirational man-management when controlling a team of such strong-willed players of extraordinary talent, Ciro was exceptional. \u201cHe was unbelievable,\u201d Bilic says, \u201cand always telling us we are the best team in the world. In the 1998 World Cup he told me I was the best centre-back in the world. I know it\u2019s not true but I liked hearing it.\u201d  Stimac adds: \u201cWith our quality Ciro didn\u2019t go too much into tactics. He just needed to handle the big egos and characters and the way he did was so impressive. We used to speak about him \u2013 me, Boban, [Alen] Boksic, [Aljosa] Asanovic, Suker and Prosinecki \u2013 and we knew no other coach in the world could handle our dressing room. But we respected Ciro so much. From the first day he was telling us: \u2018You are ready to become world champions.\u2019 At first we all laughed: \u2018C\u2019mon, Ciro, don\u2019t bullshit us.\u2019 But it was soon obvious we were ready for big things.\u201d At Euro 96, in Croatia\u2019s first tournament, they played Germany in the quarter-finals and were desperately unlucky to lose 2-1 to the eventual winners. Stimac was sent off in a controversial game and he says: \u201cWe were very confident of winning Euro 96. We didn\u2019t see Germany as a serious opponent but that referee took the role of the main man. We only went out after an injustice which shouldn\u2019t be acceptable. It hurt so much.\u201d Bilic felt defeat as acutely. \u201cI didn\u2019t cry when we just missed the final at the World Cup,\u201d he says. \u201cBut at Old Trafford I cried because we were better than Germany.\u201d In the quarter-finals of the World Cup two years later Croatia, burning with vengeance, beat Germany 3-0. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see any way we could lose because of all that pain we went through,\u201d Stimac says. \u201cWe needed revenge so badly.\u201d In the semi-final against France, Croatia went 1-0 up. \u201cWe scored early in the second half,\u201d Bilic recalls, \u201cand 80,000 people were suddenly muted. There was no sound apart from a small group of our fans high up in the stadium. I said: \u2018Guys, all we\u2019ve got to do is keep it quiet for 10 more minutes and then Suker will score again. Game over.\u2019 We knew they weren\u2019t scoring many goals and we were very solid at the back. We were so close to the final but then it happened.\u201d  France equalised within 30 seconds through the unlikely figure of Lilian Thuram. Their full-back hardly ever scored but then, with 20 minutes left, he struck his second and winning goal. Croatia were out and France crushed Brazil in the final. It was a great victory for the hosts and their multicultural team \u2013 but Croatia\u2019s legacy is even more lasting. Three years after the last burst of gunfire faded in the war of independence, this grieving but proud new nation came close to winning the World Cup. Twenty years later, Croatia knocked out England in the semi-finals of the 2018 World Cup in Russia. They lost again to France, in the final, but outstanding players such as Luka Modric and Ivan Rakitic had been nurtured by Bilic and Stimac, who both managed Croatia. The 2018 team made constant reference to how much they owed to the players who had established Croatia as a force in world football after the war. And when Modric won the Ballon d\u2019Or he paid a heartfelt tribute to the boys of \u201996 and \u201998. \u201cI could feel that respect,\u201d Stimac says. \u201cWorking with those amazing players I also saw they are just simple boys. They are very similar to us even if it\u2019s a different time. But I know their path was easier because we made the road for them.\u201d  Bilic suggests: \u201cThey were crazy proud we [he and Stimac] became their managers. They wanted to impress us more. They were asking for lots of stories about when we played for Croatia. \u2018How is Boban? How is Suker?\u2019 I asked them about their stories. It was emotional to hear they were not quitting football when life was very hard. They also suffered and when anyone told them they were not good enough they said they thought of us and kept fighting.\u201d A tangled expression of pride, framed by the memory of all that Croatia endured, crosses Bilic\u2019s face. He looks up and then, almost shyly, he says: \u201cWe were their heroes.\u201d \u2022 Croatia: Defining a Nation is now available to watch for free on Fifa+"

The two sport stars are being celebrated for their accomplishments in competition and in social activism. Biles, the most decorated gymnast in history, with 32 Olympic and world championship medals, was also recognized for her activism surrounding mental health and sexual assault. Following her withdrawal from several events at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, Biles was widely praised for speaking about the mental health challenges of being an elite athlete. With several teammates, Biles also spoke out about sexual abuse perpetrated by a former USA Gymnastics doctor, Larry Nassar. In 2021, Biles testified in front of the Senate judiciary committee. Rapinoe, an Olympic medalist and two-time World Cup winner, is being celebrated as a campaigner for gender pay equality, racial justice and LGBTQ+ rights. Rapinoe has been outspoken about pay inequality between women and men\u2019s sports, visiting the White House in March for Equal Pay Day and testifying about pay discrepancies in Congress. Joe Biden, who will bestow the honors this year, is a past recipient of the medal. Barack Obama gave him it in January 2017, calling him \u201cthe best vice-president America\u2019s ever had\u201d and a \u201clion of American history\u201d.  Other 2022 honorees included the actor Denzel Washington, the late Republican senator and presidential candidate John McCain, the late Apple founder Steve Jobs and Sandra Lindsay, the first American to receive a Covid-19 vaccine. Gabrielle Giffords, a former Arizona congresswoman and mass shooting survivor who now campaigns for gun control reform, will also be honored. In a statement, the White House said the recipients \u201chave overcome significant obstacles to achieve impressive accomplishments in the arts and sciences, dedicated their lives to advocating for the most vulnerable among us, and acted with bravery to drive change in their communities, and across the world, while blazing trails for generations to come\u201d. The award ceremony will take place on 7 July."

                    "body": "With a few months to the World Cup how are you? How are you managing your anxiety? How am I? I\u2019m expectant but focused. We reached the World Cup; now it\u2019s time to reach the final and be champions. This is the truth. At the last World Cup I was the manager because of other circumstances [Dunga was fired in 2016 and Tite took over]. Now I have had the opportunity to do the full four-year cycle. Expectations are high but the focus is on work. I have staff with great values and credentials. And an extraordinary family. If I didn\u2019t have my wife [Rosi], I wouldn\u2019t be where I am. I lose my temper, I hit the roof, I don\u2019t sleep at night, just like everyone else. But I have a partner who supports me, a family that supports me. I draw strength from my family, work and spirituality. Are you afraid of anything? The pressure we face is a problem: the responsibility, the pressure of the position, the demands. When I was a supporter, I wanted the team to be the best. It\u2019s what moves us. But mental health is important. I think about what Mandela said: \u201cCourage is the ability to face fear.\u201d In every decision he made, fear was present. When I read that, I saw that I am a normal citizen. I have my fears, my nightmares, my little goosebumps. Fear but not dread; fear and dread are different. I also read what Tost\u00e3o [a Brazil legend who won the 1970 World Cup] said: \u201cFame creates a division of the human being \u2013 it builds a creature and impoverishes the creation.\u201d I need to look after Adenor [Tite\u2019s real first name]. Adenor has a life: he will continue to be a father, a grandfather. But he doesn\u2019t want to be measured. If he wins, he is the best. If not, he is reviled. I can\u2019t understand it. When I speak, I speak for my whole team. Nobody has a monopoly on the truth. We need to reflect on different opinions, and we are open to ideas that are well argued. It\u2019s not about winning at any price. Alex Ferguson says great professionals compete against themselves in constant pursuit of improvement. Do you know why? If I compare myself to someone else, I will be frustrated and hurt. On some points I will be better, but on others I will be worse. I need to keep myself healthy, with a healthy mind. Do you feel bad when you get criticised like last year? We need time to understand. Works are best seen when they are at a distance, finished. We have results. What people are expecting? We beat the record [for the most points] in the qualifiers. We have the longest unbeaten streak: 12 games [under Tite in qualifying for the 2018 World Cup] and now 17 games without a loss [in the 2022 qualifiers]. That is 29 games. It\u2019s very difficult in South America qualifiers. We scored 13 more goals than Argentina in 17 games. We\u2019re back to first in the Fifa rankings. We were champions of the [2019] Copa Am\u00e9rica. A second place too [in 2021]. We didn\u2019t win last time, but there was a whole process, on top of a difficult, troubled moment, full of a series of problems, that I don\u2019t want to go deeper into [Brazil took over hosting rights from Colombia and Argentina amid the pandemic but were criticised for doing so while tens of thousands were dying in the country]. We kept a clean sheet in 13 of 17 qualifiers; our average goals scored per game was above 2.5. I would also like to point out one thing: nobody wanted to play the Copa Am\u00e9rica and everybody expressed that to the [then] president [of Brazil\u2019s football federation, Rog\u00e9rio Caboclo].  Are Brazil the most envied team? I will tell you a story. An Italian coach mocked Miranda [the Brazil defender, then at Internazionale, after Brazil were knocked out of the 2018 World Cup by Belgium]: \u201cHow does it feel to be knocked out by Belgium?\u201d I heard that from Miranda and I told Miranda that he [the Italian coach] never will know this feeling because he never coached a nation like Brazil or even his own nation. This is envy. That\u2019s why he asked him. Many people are jealous of Brazil. They don\u2019t admit it. Perhaps it\u2019s most envied team in the world. It is about lack of respect and envy. This is the legacy I carry, the legacy we carry, the history of having Pel\u00e9, Zagallo, Tost\u00e3o, Garrincha. If Zagallo is criticised, how can I not be? Are Brazil the most envied? I think so, but when I go out everyone asks me how I withstand the pressure of being the coach of the Brazil team. Recently Neymar said he was tired and this World Cup may be his last. Are you worried about Neymar? Did you talk to him about it? You said \u201crecently\u201d. We have to pay attention to when this happened [the interview was released last October but had been recorded months earlier, either soon after PSG had lost a Champions League semi-final or Brazil had lost the Copa final]. If I had spoken right after a cup elimination, I would have been extremely upset too. This has to be contextualised. We talk to all the players, including Neymar, about the physical, technical, tactical and mental preparation for decisive games. We pass on insights. Because of Neymar\u2019s greatness, there will always be great expectations. But now it\u2019s diluted. It\u2019s Neymar, but also Vin\u00edcius, Raphinha; Thiago [Silva] is at a high level again, Paquet\u00e1, Casemiro, Fabinho too.  Is Neymar your best player or is this Vin\u00edcius\u2019s time? Neymar is Neymar. He remains our biggest star. The difference now is that the glow is diluted by nearby stars that can also shine. Neymar\u2019s greatness is that he understands this \u2013 about the growth of these kids. He encourages the boys to go up a level. Time and experience provide this maturity. How will it be to play at a World Cup without your mother? She died in 2019 My mother\u2019s naivety \u2026 it was beautiful. When we won the Copa Am\u00e9rica, she asked me if it was bigger than the World Cup. Honey \u2026 So I explained it\u2019s not the same cup but it\u2019s hard too. I am at peace. It\u2019s their will too what I\u2019m doing. [Tite gets teary-eyed.] I am doing my father\u2019s will. He was my first coach. I know I\u2019m making them proud. My mother always gave me a lot of faith, my father the love of sport. I\u2019m fine, I have their light, their energy. I can play football for only 15 minutes with my grandchildren. I can\u2019t do more because they are very intense. Then their grandmother goes to play a little with them. I can\u2019t turn away from football. It\u2019s my pleasure, my satisfaction. I have many videos and games to watch but there are moments with the family too. I like to be with Rosi, walking with her. I like books, chimarr\u00e3o [mat\u00e9], coffee, to be with my children and grandchildren. I like movies. I read a lot \u2013 it strengthens me. But I don\u2019t switch off; I\u2019m always asking to write something down.  Will this World Cup shape your future? Sure. If you win the World Cup you get an open market. You can choose. I will not lie: my idea is definitely not to work in Brazil. I want to spend a year with my family, to take a sabbatical year, to study, to not have any responsibility because the responsibility is too great. If something comes from the outside, it will happen. Now I have the responsibility and joy of being the coach of the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o. I\u2019m not even going to talk to anyone. But in the past you had offers to take over a European club? Yes, Real Madrid and Sporting. What I like is that when a European club have an interest in a professional, they have a conversation to explain what they need. This is really cool. There was another club that wanted to talk to me and I said no: PSG [after Unai Emery left in May 2018]. They wanted to talk to me and I said I won\u2019t; I don\u2019t want to and I won\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to open up that possibility of something else. I want to be focused on my work. After is another story. At the World Cup [just before the 2018 tournament], they [Madrid] said they wanted to talk and I said no, I won\u2019t talk, don\u2019t come close. I want to be at peace with myself and my work. I am giving my best. When you do something in parallel, that\u2019s not doing it to the fullest. I can\u2019t do it. I received offers from Real Madrid, PSG and Sporting. But I didn\u2019t want that. I want to win the World Cup. After the World Cup, I will decide my future."

                    "body": "While he was critical of his own Premier League debut in the wake of Chelsea\u2019s win against Bournemouth last Tuesday, the general consensus in post-match musings across the media were that Denis Zakaria had acquitted himself well. More than a little alarming was the fact that few, if any, of those assessing the Switzerland international\u2019s performance at Stamford Bridge seemed to notice that he should almost certainly have been withdrawn from the field of play when the game was only 20 minutes old. Helping the hosts defend a corner, Zakaria tracked a run from Kieffer Moore across Chelsea\u2019s penalty area and appeared to whack his head off the Bournemouth striker\u2019s hip as he leaped to challenge for the inswinging delivery to the near post. As Chelsea cleared the ball, Zakaria crumpled to the ground where he lay prone and possibly unconscious for the best part of 90 seconds. Having received treatment from a two-man medical team while his visibly concerned teammates Kepa Arrizabalaga and Kalidou Koulibaly looked on, Zakaria was eventually lifted to his feet looking anything but compos mentis.  Clearly discombobulated, he was helped to the touchline and quickly returned to action, going on to play \u2013 and play well \u2013 for another hour before being substituted to warm applause from the home support. Having been limited to just two previous playing opportunities since signing on loan from Juventus in September, it was a big night for the 26-year-old midfielder as he attempted to stake his claim for a first-team place; a big night that almost certainly should have ended much earlier. While Zakaria may not have shown any obvious lasting symptoms of concussion, there is no guarantee he hadn\u2019t suffered one. His apparent loss of consciousness, however brief, provided a clear indication that he almost certainly had. Experts in the field have made it clear one does not have to be knocked out cold to suffer such a brain injury, but lying motionless on the ground for even a few seconds after shipping a blow to the head is a good sign that one has been sustained. Under the conditions of the Premier League\u2019s additional permanent concussion substitutions trial, Chelsea\u2019s medical staff were left with two options \u2013 to perform a fairly basic perfunctory on-field head injury assessment and allow Zakaria to play on, or to remove him permanently from the game and use up one of two concussion substitutes permitted to each team. The second course of action would have meant Bournemouth getting the option of using an additional replacement on top of their allotted five, in order to prevent any suggestions of Chelsea getting an unfair advantage in terms of personnel changes. The third and eminently most sensible option \u2013 that of allowing Chelsea to bring on a temporary substitute while their medical staff brought Zakaria off the pitch and down the tunnel to conduct a more lengthy assessment \u2013 was not open to them. In June, the game\u2019s lawmakers, the International Football Association Board (Ifab), inexplicably elected not to proceed with a trial of temporary concussion substitutes, opting instead to focus on the existing trials of additional permanent ones, who are introduced on the rarest of occasions. Only three permanent concussion substitutes were used in the season\u2019s 160 remaining top-flight matches after the introduction of permanent concussion subs in February 2021. There is no need to go that far back to see how unfit for purpose the current concussion substitution rules can be. During England\u2019s opening World Cup game in Qatar, the Iran goalkeeper Alireza Beiranvand was involved in a nasty collision with his teammate Majid Hosseini. Conscious but visibly shaken, he could scarcely have looked more concussed unless a quintet of cartoon canaries had started cheeping in unison around his head. Despite his obvious distress, Beiranvand was understandably reluctant to leave the pitch because he knew it meant he would be unable to return. He continued playing for several minutes before realising the jig was up and going to ground. Moments later he left the pitch on a stretcher and was replaced.  During England\u2019s match against Wales, Neco Williams shipped a Marcus Rashford piledriver full force to the crown of his head but soldiered on for another 12 minutes before being substituted, despite all available evidence suggesting he was in no fit state to be on the pitch. The decision of the Wales medical team to leave him out there attracted opprobrium from the BBC pundits Chris Sutton and Alan Shearer, among others. \u201cIt has to come,\u201d said Shearer of the reluctance of football\u2019s lawmakers to introduce temporary concussion substitutes. \u201cI would say to Ifab, what an earth are you waiting for? Doctors and physios are trying to buy time. Bring him off and assess him. What are they waiting for? Do it now.\u201d Having undertaken more research than most in the punditocracy on the subject of football-related brain injuries for his 2017 documentary, Alan Shearer: Dementia, Football and Me, the former striker\u2019s audible anger and frustration was entirely understandable. His one-time Blackburn teammate Sutton is another who is similarly well-placed to comment having lost his father, Mike, also a former professional footballer, to dementia and been a tireless and often frustrated campaigner for the immediate ratification of temporary concussion subs by Ifab. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to keep having meetings about meetings about this,\u201d he once told MPs at a digital, culture, media and sport committee inquiry into concussion in sport. \u201cThis needs to happen immediately.\u201d Almost two years and several meetings about meetings on from Sutton\u2019s impassioned plea, Ifab has since decided against taking his advice on board. Defending the decision before the start of the season, Ifab\u2019s CEO, Lukas Brud, argued the fundamental problem in regards to this issue was the current protocols not being properly adhered to. \u201cWe can understand the reasons why people are frustrated, but they are expressing frustration about mismanagement of the current protocol,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t take a player off, no protocol will help you.\u201d A few days before Christmas it was revealed that the Premier League, in conjunction with Ligue 1 and MLS, and with the backing of member club doctors, has asked Ifab for permission to adopt the use of temporary concussion substitutes next season and expects to receive an answer in the spring. Given its previous reluctance to facilitate this simple preventive measure, there seems a very good chance Ifab\u2019s answer will be an inexplicable, potentially life-threatening \u201cno\u201d."

I felt irate at our performance. Sooner or later that gives way to a more clear or objective view that will be replaced by anticipation.\n\u201cEveryone needs to pull their weight and get back to a positive stride. A 7-0 win is a clear signal and we have great respect for the Spain team, we know they have quality but will we hide? Not at all.\n\u201cWe just need to put it on pitch. Now is the time to speak to each other and tell each other the truth and that is what makes the team stronger. In the end we have good personalities and like to talk to each other face to face. Now we are in a bad moment but that can switch around quite fast. It can be the turning point for us. It is a big game. I am lucky I played a few big games at Chelsea.\u201d\n\nHavertz has no issue with the criticism offered by Manuel Neuer and Ilkay G\u00fcndogan of their teammates. \u201cIt was very constructive,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t tear into us as the media makes out. We went into the dressing room with heads low and shoulders dropped. I can understand that. Of course we talked about what went wrong.\n\u201cIlkay complained that people went into hiding, he said our offensive players failed to score a second or third goal. Whether it is made in public or internally does not matter. Sometimes it is a little soundbite that people extract from a longer interview.\u201d\nHavertz, who can play across the attack or as No 10, was honest when assessing his role as the No 9 against Japan. \u201cI like playing centre-forward but when put in that position it is your bloody duty to score goals which I didn\u2019t do against Japan,\u201d he said. \u201cI recognise that. Put in the same position on Sunday I will do everything in my power to help the team.\u201d\nGermany lined up for a photograph with their hands over their mouths before the Japan game in protest against Fifa ordering that seven European nations\u2019 captains could not wear the OneLove armband but there are no plans for further action. \u201cWe made our point very clear in the last few days and to be honest it is hard to speak again about it,\u201d Havertz said. \u201cEveryone knows our point of view so our focus now is 100% on football.\u201d\nJulian Brandt, an unused substitute against Japan, was succinct regarding the scale of Germany\u2019s challenge against Spain. \u201cWe are verbally in a shitting situation,\u201d the winger said."

                    "body": "Many things stick in the mind from England\u2019s last Twickenham victory against New Zealand, in 2012, but the common denominator in all of them is Manu Tuilagi. The flicked offload for Brad Barritt\u2019s try, the thundering burst, bouncing off Dan Carter and Richie McCaw, to set up Chris Ashton or picking off Kieran Read\u2019s pass for his intercept try \u2013 Tuilagi was a force of nature that afternoon. Maybe the most memorable aspect, though, is the enormous grin on his face just as the All Blacks have completed the haka; the simple, undiluted joy from what he has just witnessed, of what he is about to do. A moment of serenity before unleashing his unique brand of chaos. Ten years on, sitting in England\u2019s lavish hotel in leafy Surrey, Tuilagi is shown the highlights of that match. He has seen them plenty of times before \u2013 it is, after all, England\u2019s biggest win against New Zealand \u2013 but he cannot help but laugh. He is too bashful to do anything but stay silent when watching his own try but the way he chuckles when seeing Barritt and Ashton score shows that the joy is undiminished. \u201cOne of the best games that I was involved in. I love seeing it.\u201d It is astonishing to think that match was 10 years ago, equally that Tuilagi was only 21 but it was already his 17th cap. \u201cI was so young back then,\u201d he recalls; but, he adds: \u201cI remember it like it was yesterday.\u201d  Clearly facing the All Blacks brings the best out of Tuilagi because seven years later, after a run of injuries that might have ended most international careers, there he was in Yokohama, scoring England\u2019s try in their World Cup semi-final win against the All Blacks and denting their defensive line throughout. England have beaten New Zealand twice since 2003, Tuilagi has been to the fore on both occasions and you suspect that if they are to do so again on Saturday his role will be pivotal. \u201cOnly you know how genuine the conviction is and you\u2019ve got to have that,\u201d he says. \u201cI know the boys will this weekend, without a doubt.\u201d Tuilagi has finished watching the highlights reel and what strikes him most is how, back then, he was someone who lived off instinct. You can imagine Stuart Lancaster, head coach at the time, was perfectly happy with that, allowing Tuilagi to embrace the chaos, but since then he has learned to relish his role within the wider structure. \u201cI probably understand the game a lot more. I think I played a little bit more off the instinct which is natural as a young lad but now I understand the gameplan, I understand the need to execute the gameplan and I have a role to play in that. But the enjoyment of the game has not changed.\u201d Tuliagi remembers that in the buildup to the 2012 match no one gave England a chance. They had beaten Fiji comfortably but then suffered defeats by Australia and South Africa and so their preparations for meeting an All Blacks side unbeaten in 21 matches centred around instilling belief in the squad. It was the same three years ago when Eddie Jones famously sliced kiwi fruit in two with a samurai sword, and having the \u201cconviction\u201d that Tuilagi speaks of will be key again on Saturday.  \u201cThat week [in 2012] we just talked about belief and I think that word is massive. You have got to believe in yourself,\u201d he adds. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to believe that you\u2019re going to win the game otherwise your mindset is going in there hoping it will happen. You\u2019ve got to have the mindset of going in there and imposing our game on them, not the other way around.\u201d And facing the haka? \u201cOne of the most amazing things you see on the field. Standing in front of it. To witness the history of that country being displayed in front of you is amazing. It lays down the challenge and you\u2019ve got to accept it.\u201d Tuilagi, 31, is now at the stage of his career where his workload must be managed. He wasn\u2019t going to face Japan at all last week until Jones decided that \u201cit\u2019d be good to top him up\u201d and he appeared for 16 minutes off the bench. There are times when he can be seen doing his own thing in training, much more in tune with what his body needs than in years gone by, but around the camp there is no one more popular. Jones describes him as \u201cthe ultimate team man\u201d and when Tuilagi talks of the \u201coptimism\u201d he has maintained throughout all his spells on the sidelines you get a glimpse of why his teammates are so fond of him. That and the sheer presence he brings on the field and for the younger members of the squad this week, those who have never faced the All Blacks, there will be something reassuring about seeing Tuilagi across the breakfast table. \u201cWhat I say to the boys is that you\u2019re not here by accident, you\u2019re good enough, you\u2019re the best in the country,\u201d he says. \u201cNothing is going to be perfect, if you\u2019re lucky enough to play a perfect game, that\u2019s a bonus. But do your role, your job as well and take things on, take the game on. It\u2019s a good challenge to have. I don\u2019t think that there are many things in life where you have to take on the physical and the mental at the same time but in sport you have the opportunity to do that.\u201d All going well, Tuilagi will win his 50th England cap against South Africa on Saturday week or, to put it another way, he has managed only 31 in the 10 years since dismantling the All Blacks. Without his injury problems he would be well into three figures by now but there will be no regret \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t want that, if I get there I will be over the moon\u201d \u2013 for Tuilagi is happy with his lot, surrounded by teammates and a family man. Indeed, on the players\u2019 day off on Sunday, families were invited into camp and a soft-play centre was set up for their kids at the training base. As Tuilagi says: \u201cIf you want to practise chaos, that is the place.\u201d"

When they\u2019re walking out on match day, where basically they\u2019re out of our hands, that they have a genuine belief in what they\u2019re doing. Not because of mystical words of wisdom necessarily but because of a process they\u2019ve been through. If we do that then we\u2019re handing over to them and requiring their individual moments to make the difference.\u201d\n\nHolland believes it will be tight against France. The 52-year-old, who has worked as an assistant at Chelsea, feels England are wiser after runs to the semi-finals of the 2018 World Cup and the final of Euro 2020.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of young players who have been gaining experience,\u201d he said. \u201cThe experience in the group is as strong as I can remember. You rely on that in these moments. From a management perspective we\u2019ve lived these moments now. Are we excited about being in a quarter-final? Of course. But when you\u2019ve just been to a final and a semi-final it feels a little bit different to the first quarter-final. I\u2019m not being arrogant. We want more.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a 50-50 game. If you\u2019re playing inferior opposition and you play well you get the result. That\u2019s the challenge. We could play well and still not get the result. It\u2019s 50-50 with special players who can produce something out of nothing. But the team are really well equipped for the journey this quarter-final could be. It could be a long night. I feel we\u2019re as ready as we\u2019ve ever been to navigate that.\u201d\n\nHolland, who described Southgate as \u201ca good human being\u201d and \u201ca really good ambassador for the country\u201d, also shed a light on the togetherness in the England camp. \u201cWhen you are together a long period of time, it\u2019s different to club football,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have 23 [players] any more, we have 26. You pick 11 and 15 are disappointed. It takes huge energy to manage that group.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge part of man-management. Gareth does that systematically. The players respect that and appreciate it. But there probably is a shelf life to how long a player can be a backup. Going back to my experience at Chelsea, to win you can\u2019t have 11 players that are comfortable and know they\u2019re going to play every week. In the end you get a drop-off. The players have to feel the faith of the manager, but also competition from the group.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge part of the job and Gareth does that as well as it can be done. We\u2019ve seen in the tournament in other camps that if you do get dissent in the group, and players not feeling good about each other, that can soon in this environment spread like a cancer. It is a really important part. We\u2019re very lucky. We have a really top group of senior professionals.\u201d"

                    "body": "  9.38pm    To Peru! If you are in Australia, set yer alarm clocks again because this one will be Monday night Doha time, which means 4am Tuesday AEST. The intercontinental playoff is the final step. And it will be a step in up in terms of opposition, and the squad will need every day between now and then to refresh and refocus. Mat Ryan says this rare extended period in camp has paid off in spades, and also had some nice words for Arnold, who has come under immense criticism. \u201cI\u2019m proud of the boys for the effort tonight,\u201d Ryan says. Since we have come into camp, things have been really positive. We have been homing in on the things that have been letting us down so far and it\u2019s amazing when you can get a manager around the group again. \u201cObviously the last two camps he has been down with Covid-19. The environment in preparation has been much better in terms of the logistics around the place and all that. I think you have seen the result of that in performances.\u201d On that note I will bid you farewell. Joey Lynch\u2019s match report is on its way and we will have more coverage between now and next Tuesday\u2019s crunch clash. See ya.     9.24pm    We are hearing from Arnold now. The coach must be relieved, because his team\u2019s survival also means his survival. Is he relieved? \u201cNot really, proud of the boys,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have been able to get together for the last week and prepare for this game well, and it is the first time we have been able to play a friendly against Jordan for three years. Being able to prepare the boys was good, and you saw that in the performance. \u201cWe have got to give credit to UAE, they played well as well. But we knew they would sit back and we didn\u2019t want to play a game where we open up the field too much because they have got some quality players. We made sure we stayed nice and compact the whole game. \u201cI thought there was a lot less space for the opposition tonight.They got in behind a couple of times on the right-hand side \u2013 we have got to tidy that up. But overall I thought defensively we were good, and I saw a good reaction tonight. That is what I have been driving to the boys ... about the Aussie DNA, and that is fight, scratch and do whatever you have got to do to win the game. However we win it, who cares? Just win it.\u201d     9.19pm    If there are positives for the Socceroos, one is definitely the resilience after conceding the equaliser. That should go without saying for a national team but it has not been the case this qualifying campaign. Last week\u2019s friendly win against Jordan was the first time they had come back from behind and won. Hrustic has some thoughts on this.  \u201cWe never dropped our heads,\u201d he says. \u201cI told the boys at the start, \u2018let\u2019s do it\u2019 ... we have put so much work in and we have been working our arses off, so to say. \u201cWe conceded a goal and we shouldn\u2019t have. We kept going, kept fighting and we took our chance, and the goal for Australia was for all the boys, for the staff, because we have been through a lot and it hasn\u2019t been easy. I don\u2019t think everyone realises how much work we put in, so I\u2019m happy. Really happy.\u201d     9.12pm    And so, the Socceroos are alive! They are still in with a shot of making a fifth straight World Cup. How was this match? It was a slow-burner. The first half was cagey, it was a little passive. Both sides took their time to settle into a rhythm, before the show finally started after half-time. Irvine was key, Boyle an insatiable livewire and Hrustic came alive when he needed to. Here are the three goals from the match, in their order.        9.05pm    Irvine, who scored Australia\u2019s first goal, is feeling pretty great. \u201cObviously it\u2019s a great feeling,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you have that moment of elation when the final whistle goes, and then straightaway you are focused. It\u2019s a great result which means we can go into the week full of confidence. The job is only half done and we will have a tough preparation week again. Recover, get ready to go again. We have a great squad with a good energy about us, and I\u2019m excited.\u201d     9.00pm    Boyle is speaking with Channel Ten. \u201cIt\u2019s never nice [to equalise] but look, we controlled the game, we kept the ball well, we kept minimal chances and we kept putting the ball wide to create chances,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd obviously we got the breakthrough.\u201d Speaking of Boyle, Michael Watson has written in. \u201cDelighted to see Martin Boyle getting so much of the action,\u201d he emails. \u201cHe was cracking for us at Hibs so much so that we collapsed with a whimper as soon as he left!\u201d     8.54pm    For those just waking up in Australia, the Socceroos\u2019 hopes of making the finals in Qatar are safe ... for now. Full-time brings an outpouring of emotion from the bench and the field \u2013 this must have been an intense week in camp under heavy scrutiny. Now they must prepare to face Peru in a final, sudden-death playoff next Monday in Doha (early Tuesday AEST).     8.51pm   Full-time! United Arab Emirates 1-2 Australia  90+3 mins Abdulrahman is on the ball. He wants to get closer to Australia\u2019s goal. The Socceroos have men behind the ball, waiting for the referee to blow the whistle he is slowly bringing to his mouth. And there it is. Australia have progressed to a final playoff for a spot in the 2022 World Cup!     8.49pm    90+2 mins Behich, under pressure in his own third, clears long. Mooy is on the move now down the right but can\u2019t keep the ball in play and the UAE regain possession at the halfway mark.     8.48pm    90+1 mins Arnold brings off Leckie and Hrustic and introduces Milos Degenek and Awer Mabil. Three minutes of stoppage-time.     8.47pm    90 mins One of those subs is Abdulrahman, who finally gets his time \u2013 all 40 seconds of it. He fouls Hrustic and is called back for it. Arnold is gesticulating wildly, shouting \u201c5-4-1\u201d.     8.46pm    <b>89 mins</b> Eisa, in an attempt to defend then play out an Australian attack, moves so far off his line he may as well be a midfielder. Risky business. The UAE make a triple substitution, which means they\u2019re out of changes. The Socceroos still have a couple if they need it.     8.44pm    87 mins Well, the Socceroos will probably want to defend a bit now. The UAE have a throw-in which gets sucked into a penalty-area scramble but Ryan has rushed off his line for an acrobatic leap to gather.     8.42pm   Goal! United Arab Emirates 1-2 Australia  84 mins Mooy swings in a corner, it\u2019s headed clear to the top of the box, where Hrustic strikes is first time and strikes it sweet. Eisa gets a touch but he is beaten, and beaten good.  Updated at 8.44pm BST    8.41pm    Surprised to see Mooy still out there. His 60 minutes last week was the first hit-out in a long time for the former Huddersfield and Brighton man, who is on the books of Shanghai Port but training out of Scotland. Mooy goes long to Boyle, who is one on one with Abbas but gets away a cross to the back post. No one is there to meet it.     8.39pm    81 mins Another big chance for Australia as Boyle feeds Hrustic, who makes a lovely touch in his pass to Maclaren. The striker forces a big save from Eisa and they return for another crack with not quite as much verve as the last.      8.37pm    80 mins This has been a free-flowing contest with very few stoppages, which means that the clock may not tick too far past 90 minutes. Boyle gets the better of his man and then looks for Mooy behind and to the middle. He and his teammates pass diagonally back and left before a long switch to the right.  Updated at 8.39pm BST    8.34pm    77 mins The UAE make a double substitution, bringing on Ali Saleh and Yahia Nader for Abdullah Ramadan and Ali Mabkhout respectively.     8.33pm    75 mins At this rate there\u2019ll be extra-time. Leckie and Rowles trade passes. And Hrustic shines again with a gorgeous switch of play to a high-lying Behich on the left. He drives the ball across the face of goal, fires the cross to Maclaren. The ball bounces of him, onto a defender, and then off Boyle.     8.29pm    73 mins Arnold makes his first substitution and it\u2019s spark he\u2019s after, bringing on Jamie Maclaren for Goodwin.     8.29pm    71 mins The Saudi-based Boyle has no problem with running a defenders. He relishes it. Goodwin takes the corner and aims for the back post but Eisa is alert to the danger. The UAE look to have tweaked their formation from a 4-2-3-1 to a 4-3-3, and as I write this Hrustic, who has been uncharacteristically off colour this match, penetrates the middle for a half-chance.     8.26pm    69 mins Al Hammadi twirls the ball around his feet cleverly and then sends it back to his keeper. They probe for a bit before Australia take possession. Boyle does Boyle things and keeps the ball in play to earn another corner.     8.23pm    66 mins The UAE break free and have the numbers. A cross flies in for Mabkhout and there looks to be a foul on the edge of the box as Abdullah hits the deck. Arruabarrena is absolutely losing his mind in his technical area. The referee waves play on regardless. As you were.     8.21pm    63 mins Irvine, who unwittingly had a hand in the UAE\u2019s equaliser, swings in a peach of a cross from the right. Leckie is in the goal mouth looking for the header but the ball falls to Goodwin. He cannot quite catch it on the half-volley but that was a good chance.     8.19pm    60 mins Nothing is ever easy, is it. The UAE have the share of possession now as Goodwin gives the referee a piece of his mind after going down under a challenge from Hamad, to no end. He is directed to pick himself up, and he really should because Ramadan has the ball at his feet again.     8.17pm   Goal! United Arab Emirates 1-1 Australia  57 mins Three minutes later the UAE have answered via none other than Canedo. No defenders want to commit to Abdalla as he sashays down the left and whips the ball across to the Brazilian, who thunders it home. All square.     8.13pm   Goal! United Arab Emirates 0-1 Australia  53 mins Well well well! Almost out of nothing, Australia winn the ball high up the field. Hrustic is on the move, encounters a cul de sac and then escapes and gets the ball away to to Boyle guides it down into the right, evades two defenders and crosses for Irvine. The FC Pauli midfielder tucks it away past Eisa to give his country the lead!     8.08pm    50 mins Chance! Al-Maazmi has been menacing and he gets in behind Atkinson again before cutting inside and forcing Ryan into his most difficult save yet.     8.06pm    48 mins Leckie can\u2019t bring down a ball over the top and Eisa gathers with little fuss. Arnold is cutting a very nervous figure in his dugout. This will be the last match of his tenure if it does not go to plan.     8.03pm   Second half!  46 mins This match is basically Armageddon. It should be biblical. It has felt like watching chess. But let\u2019s see what awaits. I\u2019ve had my half-time Kit Kat as the clock ticks past 5am in Sydney. No chances from either side after the break.     7.53pm    That was a mostly guarded first half. Two shots apiece. Both of the UAE\u2019s were on target, both of Australia\u2019s were off. As expected, the UAE have been dangerous on the counter under Argentine manager Rodolfo Arruabarrena, a former Boca Juniors and Villareal defender. The Socceroos have been tentative. They have tried to play direct and it\u2019s been easily dealt with. Arnold has obviously instructed Behich and Atkinson not to push forward, but they are ceding space behind them regardless. May as well push forward, I say. Goodwin and Boyle have been the standouts thus far     7.47pm   Half-time! United Arab Emirates 0-0 Australia  45 mins As the clock ticks down the local crowd get vocal, clapping and chanting as another Australian foray is redirected by their opponents. There will be no stoppage-time this half.     7.45pm    44 mins Canedo has materialised on the left flank, where he is practically toying with two green and gold shirts. Ultimately, though, the balls goes out of play.     7.43pm    42 mins Behich vies for the ball with Canedo and looks to have had the last touch before it bobbles over the byline but Australia are given the corner nonetheless. It comes to nothing. The UAE have a throw-in now at the touchline but it is duly taken care of by Behich, who backpasses to Ryan.     7.41pm    40 mins A (very) long ball from Australia\u2019s defence find Behich right up at the far corner. What is he doing all the way up there, then? That\u2019s the furthest forward we\u2019ve seen either of the full-backs this match. Behich flicks the ball back and inside to Jackson Irvine but no luck this time.     7.38pm    38 mins Mooy is in a tangle on the ground with Ramadan and the pair get back on their feet just in time for Mat Leckie to remonstrate with the referee about who should be given possession after the ball ricochets out. It will go to the UAE.     7.37pm    36 mins Goodwin has the ball at his feet now and the cross is good. Oh! A goal? Nope, it shaves the top of Rowles\u2019s head. In an instant the UAE have another shot on target from Al-Maazmi, from a tight angle for a second time. He whizzed past Atkinson again and forced Mat Ryan into a reflex save.     7.35pm    33 mins Mabkhout, meanwhile, has been waiting patiently for his moment. The assumption is that it will come (he has 80 international goals). Hrustic releases Leckie and there\u2019s an opening but the UAE get back in shape too quickly. In the process, Behich looks to have fouled a player but it\u2019s Mabkhout who is shown a yellow card for a subsequent challenge on Goodwin.     7.31pm    30 mins The Socceroos\u2019 desire not to concede early has been clear in these opening 30 minutes. They have made some headway but, true to form, are not exactly penetrating in a manner which will elicit a goal. Caution reigns supreme here, and even still there have been some testy moments.     7.29pm    28 mins Rowles goes in for what looks like a good challenge on Canedo. He gets the ball on first contact but then appears to clean up the back of his opponent\u2019s leg and does not look happy at all as the referee awards the UAE a free-kick. Its taker, Ramadan, is profligate and whips it well over the bar.     7.26pm    25 mins Boyle is quick, he is thrifty, he pings a one-touch pass to the left for Goodwin. The Adelaide United man has all the time in the world but rushes his cross. Ie, he aims to send it to seemingly nobody in particular, and to nobody it arrive.     7.25pm    23 mins This is becoming rather end to end all of a sudden as Australia make another menacing entrance into the penalty box. There is quite a bit of space in their midfield, though.     7.22pm    21 mins Before you can blink the UAE are back on the attack, breaking Atkinson\u2019s right full-back position (again) and crossing into the box. A goal-mouth scramble of sorts ensues before the ball pops back out. Their naturalised Brazilian forward, Caio Canedo, commits a foul in the process.     7.20pm    18 mins Just as I\u2019ve typed this Ali Salmeen attempts an audacious through ball. Abdullah Ramadan tries to pick it up but fouls Boyle instead. The ball flies straight up the other end, where Hrustic delivers Australia\u2019s first real chance into the penalty. It sails towards the back post but is a little high for Goodwin.     7.17pm    16 mins All in all the first 15 minutes have played out in the expected manner. The UAE are set up in two defensive and are sitting back off the ball, inviting the Socceroos to try and break them down.     7.15pm    14 mins Behich to Goodwin to Mooy, then retreat. Australia\u2019s full-backs are staying quite deep, presumably to avoid leaving themselves open in the way they did against Jordan.     7.13pm    12 mins Australia have had the share of possession and territory here but their opponents are always dangerous on the counter. The former try a diagonal long ball which comes to nothing and possession is back with the UAE.      7.10pm    10 mins Counter-attack! The UAE race off in transition and Australia\u2019s defence is slow on the uptake as Harib Al-Maazmi dashes down the left before a late intervention averts the danger.     7.08pm    7 mins Leckie tees up Hrustic, the Eintracht Frankfurt man who recently helped the German club to the Europa League. No luck this time but they keep at it in the UAE\u2019s half until Leckie clips the heels of Abdulla Hamad.     7.06pm    6 mins The UAE are getting numbers behind the ball as Australia apply the pressure. Boyle is dribbling and weaving through bodies and displaying positive signs.     7.05pm    4 mins Craig Goodwin and Mooy are standing over the ball for the free-kick before the former does the honours. It is punched away by Khalid Eisa with little fuss.     7.04pm   Peep! We're away!  2 mins The time for introspection is over, for the action has started in this seventh meeting with the UAE. Atkinson has played his part early to stop an early Emirati raid before the flag goes up for offside. And Australia have their first set piece after an unfortunate challenge by Khalifa Al Hammadi.     7.00pm    Having said that about that Asian Cup quarter, that was a tight match. Expect this to be the same. I can see extra-time. The players are walking out of the tunnel at the air-conditioned Al Rayyan Stadium for the national anthems, and it\u2019s worth taking a moment to think about the human rights controversy surrounding Qatar\u2019s hosting of this World Cup. This piece from Barney Ronay is excellent.      6.55pm    If you are catching up on what has happened for the Socceroos on the road to Qatar, this wee preview should get you up to speed:      6.53pm    And the UAE\u2019s XI is here, with Ali Mabkhout leading the line. For context, Mabkhout scored the only goal in Australia\u2019s quarter-final loss at the 2019 Asian Cup, after swooping on a poor backpass from Milos Degenek. He has scored 14 goals this qualifying campaign and Australia need to stop him from adding to that tally. Meanwhile, Omar Abdulrahman has been named on the bench. Will we see him brought on a little later for some spark?       6.42pm    Let\u2019s get straight into teams because they have landed and, well, I did not pick this one. Huge day for Nathaniel Atkinson and Kye Rowles, who start at right-back and centre-back respectively and Bailey Wright retains his central defensive place from last week\u2019s friendly win over Jordan. Aziz Behich, who came off the bench in that match, is back in the XI at left-back. Worth noting that Rowles or Wright have earned a call-up after Trent Sainsbury pulled up with an injury during the week. As promised by Graham Arnold, Aaron Mooy gets the nod despite having not played any competitive football for six month. Head of strength and conditioning, Andrew Clarke was apparently pleased with the way the midfielder pulled up after an hour-long stint in the friendly. Ajdin Hrustic, too, is in and will offer creativity in the absence of Tom Rogic, and Scotland-born Martin Boyle looks to be the striker! I mean ... OK. But sure, why not? Let\u2019s roll with it and good things might happen. Adam Taggart is out through injury too.      6.26pm   Preamble  It\u2019s squeaky-bum time! The culmination of four years and proverbial blood, sweat and tears. The Socceroos are in Qatar \u2013 somewhere they want to be in November but somewhere they decidedly do not want to be now. Their World Cup hopes are hanging by a thread somewhere off Doha\u2019s corniche and only a win against the United Arab Emirates up the road at Al Rayyan Stadium will stop them dying a short death. How did we get here again? Australia could have avoided this with a couple of more favourable results against opposition they should have beaten. But a third-place finish in the third round behind automatic qualifiers Saudi Arabia and Japan has consigned the national team to this life-and-death playoff. Win here and they play Peru for a spot in the finals. But let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves because while the UAE might be ranked 68th to Australia\u2019s 42nd recent past tells us the latter has trouble against the former. Nothing like the present to change the narrative!  "

The Argentinian was unveiled as the latest tourism ambassador for Saudi Arabia during a trip to Jeddah, a port city along the Red Sea, on Monday. \u201cThis is not his first visit to the kingdom and it will not be the last,\u201d said Ahmed al-Khateeb, the kingdom\u2019s minister of tourism, in a tweet with images of Messi being welcomed at King Abdulaziz International Airport.  Messi, who was accompanied by his Argentina and PSG teammate Leandro Paredes, later posted a picture of himself relaxing on a yacht while watching the sunset. \u201cDiscovering the Red Sea #VisitSaudi,\u201d read the caption on the post, which was marked as a \u201cpaid partnership\u201d with Visit Saudi, a subsidiary of the Saudi Tourism Authority. Messi was later accompanied by Princess Haifa Al-Saud, assistant minister of tourism, as they toured various parts of old Jeddah. \u201cI am glad that he was mesmerized by its essence, heritage and beauty,\u201d Princess Haifa later wrote on Twitter. The first thing to point out is that Messi does not need to take whatever incredibly large sum Saudi Arabia has thrown his way. Last year alone he made $122m through salary and sponsorship, making him the second-highest paid athlete in the world behind LeBron James. Simply put, Messi has enough money that his future grandchildren won\u2019t need to work a day in their lives. He could have politely declined the Saudi offer and still lived out a very comfortable retirement. And yet, unless Messi has a hitherto undisclosed passion for spreading the word about Saudi Arabia\u2019s undiscovered cultural highlights, this is all about greed. And the effects will be toxic.  By accepting a role as Saudi Arabia\u2019s tourism ambassador, Messi has effectively aligned himself with a regime linked to countless human rights abuses, including the infamous assassination of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi, its devastating war in Yemen that has caused a humanitarian catastrophe, and its crackdown on intellectuals, LGBTI+ people, reformers, and women\u2019s rights activists. Messi\u2019s trip to Jeddah also underscores how the kingdom continues to use sports to beautify its public image. This process is known as sportswashing, a term popularized by Amnesty International to describe the use of sports by oppressive governments to legitimize their regimes and distract from their human rights abuses. Ahead of Messi\u2019s latest trip to Saudi, he was urged by families of political prisoners in the kingdom to refuse offers to become the face of Saudi tourism. Their letter, which was organized by human rights advocacy body Grant Liberty, noted that \u201cthe Saudi regime wants to use you to launder its reputation.\u201d \u201cIf you say \u2018yes\u2019 to Visit Saudi you are in effect saying yes to all the human rights abuses that take place today in modern Saudi Arabia,\u201d read the letter, which was first published in February 2021. \u201cBut if you say \u2018no\u2019 you will send an equally powerful message \u2013 that human rights matter, that decency matters, that those who torture and murder do not do so with impunity. The world must stand up to those who trample on others.\u201d Messi\u2019s history with the kingdom dates back to 2011, when he led his country in a friendly match against the Saudi national team. He has since returned to play on numerous occasions, including the 2019 Superclasico de las Americas and the 2020 Spanish Super Cup. He has also appeared on billboards advertising the 2022 Riyadh Season entertainment festival organized by the Saudi government. The seven-time Ballon d\u2019Or winner\u2019s repeated appearances in Saudi Arabia are due to the kingdom\u2019s strategic transformation into an alluring hub for international sports events. Over the past few years, Saudi has signed a 10-year, $650m deal for a Formula One motor racing event, invested millions in a Saudi International golf event, partnered with World Wrestling Entertainment for annual shows, and hosted the world heavyweight championship rematch between Anthony Joshua and Andy Ruiz.  Last year, a group led by Saudi\u2019s sovereign wealth fund \u2013 an entity headed by Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman \u2013 purchased Newcastle United, providing Saudi with an influential position in English football and an international platform to launder its reputation. It also marked the latest football team to be bought by a Middle Eastern regime with bottomless pockets, following the likes of Manchester City, which is owned by the Abu Dhabi royal family, and Paris Saint Germain, owned by the Qatar sovereign wealth fund. Saudi\u2019s partnership with Messi comes after David Beckham signed a $200m deal to become Qatar\u2019s cultural ambassador ahead of the 2022World Cup. The 10-year-deal, which began in 2021, will see the English football legend promote the country\u2019s tourism and culture. \u201cFor Qatar, not only is it an inspiring moment to bring together some of the biggest players and fans from around the region, but also a chance to show off the country, its history and culture,\u201d Beckham said last month. As Saudi continues to expand its influence in the world of sports and entertainment, its newfound partnership with Messi \u2013 one of the most recognizable athletes in the world \u2013 is arguably among its most pivotal achievements. The Argentine has 326 million followers on Instagram and will continue to use his platform to promote Saudi Arabia, which, in turn, will have a positive effect on tourism. \u201cIt is a distinguished and unique step for Messi to become an ambassador for Saudi tourism due to the influence the player has, which will reflect positively on Jeddah\u2019s position as a tourist destination,\u201d Sami Al Jaber, a retired Saudi football player regarded as one of the greatest strikers in the nation\u2019s history, wrote on Twitter. In Messi, the Saudi government has a premier athlete with a built-in audience and platform ready to be utilized for political gain. While Messi was once lauded for his humanitarian efforts with Unicef and his own charitable foundation, his recent alignment with Saudi raises concerns that he is willing to blatantly disregard human rights in exchange for lucrative deals with brutal dictators.

                    "body": "How high might Newcastle\u2019s ceiling be? Victory at third-placed Tottenham lifted them into the Premier League\u2019s top four. With winnable fixtures against Aston Villa and Southampton before a pre-World Cup showdown with Chelsea, Newcastle can be solidly in the Champions League shakeup when they head off for that Saudi winter training camp taken for \u201cfootball reasons\u201d.\nWhat a difference a change of ownership, a year and \u00a3200m\u2011odd of transfer spending has already made. Deservedly beating opponents over whom they had prevailed once in 10 matches since 2016 registered as a statement win. It is 11 years since they were in such a high position at this stage of a season. Draws with the Manchester clubs, being unlucky losers at Liverpool and this result suggest a team here to stay.\n\nTottenham\u2019s place in the Champions League positions, as best of the rest behind Manchester City and Arsenal, is becoming precarious. Antonio Conte\u2019s attempt to freshen his team after a midweek no\u2011show at Manchester United fell flat against an aggressive, organised opponent. And one with genuine quality.\nCallum Wilson\u2019s finish for the first goal after being baulked by a disoriented Hugo Lloris was cool while Miguel Almir\u00f3n\u2019s lash from the right of the penalty box was that of a player in the form of his life. Two players Eddie Howe inherited scoring, and the continuing improvements of Steve Bruce/Mike Ashley legacies such as Joelinton and Sean Longstaff, speak to his coaching skills.\n\u201cThe problem is, if you associate [success] with money, it takes away credit from the players,\u201d Howe said. \u201cA lot of them were here anyway.\u201d\nAmong the faithful at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium doubts in Conte are beginning to crystallise. The full-time boos were predictable after a second half in which Harry Kane got them back into the game but could not inspire anything further. Bright beginnings in which Son Heung-min twice went close had ebbed away.\nThere had been fears that Bruno Guimar\u00e3es might miss the match after becoming a father for the first time. Instead the new dad dominated midfield alongside Joelinton, Newcastle\u2019s human dynamo.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been amazing days for me,\u201d Guimar\u00e3es said. \u201cI would stay home but I love to be here with these guys. They make me happy and proud, and I think we deserved it today.\u201d\nAgainst that pair Oliver Skipp, a player once tipped among Spurs cognoscenti for a plane ticket to Qatar, was making a first start since January and his was not a wholly convincing comeback. These are early days but Yves Bissouma\u2019s best performance at the Tottenham stadium in 2022 remains as a Brighton player in his former team\u2019s 1-0 April win.Newcastle may have the best goals\u2011against record in the division but they had not come to defend. The high press that caused Eric Dier to make a mess of an early back-pass to Lloris also looked a rich seam of chance creation. It would prove so for their first goal.\nFabian Sch\u00e4r\u2019s forward punt ought to have caused few problems but, with his defence standing square, Lloris rushed out rashly, clattered into Wilson and presented the striker with an open net. A lengthy VAR delay and a skirmish in which Rodrigo Bentancur went close to losing his head did not rule out the goal. \u201cI had every right to go for the ball,\u201d Wilson said, with just cause.\nThen came Almir\u00f3n\u2019s excellent finish, laid on by Longstaff while leaving the Paraguayan with plenty to do. \u201cMiggy [Almir\u00f3n] has always been a fantastic player,\u201d Howe said. \u201cHe\u2019s just adding goals to his game.\u201d\nAfter a biblical half-time downpour that delayed half the crowd\u2019s return came the attempted Tottenham comeback. Kane, stooping at the far post, nodded in from Davinson S\u00e1nchez\u2019s flick and Spurs looked back in business.\nKane dropped deep to become playmaker and set up Ivan Perisic, only for the substitute to smash his shot straight at the goalkeeper, Nick Pope.\n\nLucas Moura was also introduced, Conte looking to his ball-carrying as Newcastle began to take their time over breaks in play. Guimar\u00e3es aiming for the corner flag to hold up the ball with all of 10 minutes on the clock showed a desperation to wind the clock down and his fatigue after what he admitted had been two sleepless nights. Pope was eventually booked for taking undue time over a goal kick.\nSpurs\u2019 frustration boiled over and Bentancur raged again, at himself for overhitting a pass. \u201cWe tried, we scored one goal, we didn\u2019t do good enough,\u201d said Conte, choosing to blame Tottenham\u2019s heavy schedule for their lapse in form. \u201cWe have to finish this period of games and then in January we\u2019ll see where we are.\u201d\nAs injury time was seen out with more sharp game management, Newcastle could begin their celebrations. And while Howe cautioned \u201cthere is a long way to go\u201d, the sky is beginning to look like their limit."

Dave Ryding, flag-bearer at this year\u2019s Beijing winter Games, and Guest are among five athletes who were told their discipline would be axed from the World Class Programme. According to UK Sport, WCP funding is allocated to national governing bodies to \u201csupport sports and athletes with realistic medal capabilities at Olympic Games\u201d.  Without that backing the group now need to raise \u00a3800,000 in the next two months, when the current cycle ends, to cover the shortfall. \u201cMy stomach just sunk,\u201d Guest said. \u201cI\u2019m in skiing, I\u2019m very used to raising money, to finding money, to finding sponsors, but to have to find hundreds of thousands was something that was \u2026 I was just like, \u2018I don\u2019t know how I can do that.\u2019\u201d Guest was part of the British team that finished joint fifth in the first-ever Olympic mixed team alpine event at Pyeongchang 2018. She was \u201cin tears\u201d watching her teammate Ryding become the first British winner in 55 years at the Alpine World Cup, when he took slalom gold at Kitzbuhel just weeks before being selected to carry the flag for his country. Guest said it was proof of what her squad was capable of achieving. \u201cThere are plenty of times when you\u2019re like, \u2018Why am I doing this? I should just go home, I could just go and finish my degree, I could just get a job or whatever.\u2019 And then you have one good race and you start thinking, \u2018Yeah, actually I love doing this. I\u2019m so proud to be part of this team,\u2019\u201d she said. GB Snowsport said: \u201cA significant portion [of the \u00a311.9m allocated to them for the Paralympic and Olympic programmes] is ringfenced for World Class Programme funding, which we are only eligible to spend on programmes deemed eligible for WCP investment by UK Sport.  \u201cAlpine, cross-country and Para Nordic have not been deemed WCP eligible in this cycle.\u201d UK Sport expressed sympathy for the alpine athletes, but agreed that the organisation\u2019s WCP funding priorities had shifted. \u201cUK Sport is aiming to become an ever greater force in winter sport, while powering a broader range of sports and champions who reflect the diversity of British society,\u201d a statement read. GB Snowsport has launched an official appeal to UK Sport and hopes to receive a decision by October. That may be too late for Guest and her teammates, with the current funding cycle closing at the end of September."

                    "body": "They call Ricardo Gareca, the coach of the Peruvian national team, \u201cThe Tiger\u201d.\nHe received the nickname for being a fearless and tireless striker for Argentine teams Boca Juniors, River Plate, Velez Sarsfield and Independiente, and then America de Cali in the Colombia League, where Gareca won two league titles and was runner-up in three Copa Libertadores. Gareca played 20 internationals for Argentina, scoring five goals, including one against Peru, which eliminated them from the 1986 World Cup and sent them into a 36-year drought between tournaments.\n\nWhen Gareca joined Peru as coach in 2015, he looked calm. \u201cYou always have to think,\u201d the 64-year-old tells his players today, pointing to his head. From that base of mental strength, unity and discipline, Gareca has built a Peruvian team that, after 40 years, could repeat the feat of their 1978 and 1982 sides in qualifying for consecutive World Cups if they defeat Australia on Monday.\nWith a renewed team featuring current stars Edison Flores and Miguel Trauco, Gareca told reporters in 2016 he had \u201cfound the team I have been looking for so much.\u201d Peru recovered in the second part of the qualifiers for Russia 2018 to reach fifth place in South America. In the intercontinental playoff against New Zealand, Peru tied in Wellington 0-0 but won 2-0 in Lima to return to the World Cup finals. Through the streets and parks of Peru there were monuments of Gareca and his players. \u2018Los Incas\u2019, after many years, were once again pride of the nation.\nAt that 2018 World Cup in Russia, Peru\u2019s best moment was the 2-0 victory against Australia, their rival in the 2022 playoff on Monday night. From the team that played against the Socceroos in Sochi, between eight and seven players could be part of the Peruvian starting team to face Graeme Arnold\u2019s side. \nAlthough the recent Australia-United Arab Emirates game was played on a Tuesday, thousands of Peruvians were as attentive as if it had been a weekend game. They saw an Australian team that respects the essence of vertical football and players in very good physical condition with clear strengths in free kicks and corners.\nBut Peruvians also know the Socceroos\u2019 are experiencing a period of renewal. Important players from Russia 2018 like Mile Jedinak and Tim Cahill have retired, and Australia is no longer that team from 2006 with international figures like Mark Viduka, Harry Kewell or Cahill who were able to beat Uruguay in the playoffs. Yet it is still possible to identify coach Graeme Arnold\u2019s tactical discipline and see he has been growing players, such as Ajdin Hrustic, a champion of the Europa League with Frankfurt.\nPath to playoffs\nPeru\u2019s journey to the Qatar 2022 playoffs was much the same as it was four years ago: a poor start to qualifying, a comeback in the finals and a playoff against a team from Oceania (although Australia is now part of the Asian confederation).\nTo reach Monday night\u2019s playoff against Australia, Peru made an epic comeback to reach fifth place in the South American qualifying rounds. Until June 2021, the Peruvian team was last in the standings with only one point from five games. But with an away victory against Ecuador and a good performance in the Copa Am\u00e9rica 2021 (where Peru came fourth), the red and white recovery began.\nSince September 2021, Peru have not lost at home and have added two more away wins against Venezuela and Colombia to finish in fifth place with 24 points and give Peruvians enough hope to dream of another World Cup.\nHow Peru plays\nRicardo Gareca usually uses a 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1 scheme. The main characteristic of this Peruvian team is their superb treatment of the ball. They play with a lot of possession and look for attacking options against any rival. After six years together, Gareca\u2019s squad plays almost from memory.\nPlayers to watch\nPeru\u2019s 90-game goalkeeper Pedro Gallese is a legend in Peru and a veteran of the 2018 campaign; Christian Cueva is the most skilled in the squad with the ball; Andr\u00e9 Carrillo is a world-class right winger; and Gianluca Lapadula, an attacker who was born in Italy to a Peruvian mother, has starred for Peru since 2020.\n\nStrengths\nOne of Peru\u2019s main strengths is that it has maintained its core playing group for the last six years. This team knows each other well, and that will give them a high level of optimism going into this sudden-death clash.\nWeaknesses\nGareca has a strong and solid team, but problems begin when one of the eleven starters has problems with suspension or injury. Lack of depth is where Peru suffers most. In the last two years Gareca has struggled to find replacements for key positions. Senior strikers Paolo Guerrero and Jefferson Farf\u00e1n are both missing for Monday\u2019s fixture, meaning Lapadula has had to appear from distant Turin to cover the place of the \u20189\u2019. But beyond \u2018El Bambino\u2019 there are not many other names that arouse confidence in the Peruvian attack. \nLocal support\nBeyond the anxiety of a second playoff in five years, Peruvians have great confidence in their team. As we speak, the Peruvian government is evaluating whether Monday is declared a national holiday. Despite some negative results, especially in 2020, this year the Peruvian fans have reconciled with their football team. It is a romance that is now at its highest peak."

                    "body": "If you take a taxi in Argentina, the conversation will eventually turn to one of two subjects: inflation or football. In Buenos Aires, the World Cup is inescapable. Signs hover above busy motorways screaming out \u201cvamos Argentina, emocion mundial\u201d. Bars, kiosks and bakeries are decked out with blue and white streamers. Messi\u2019s face is plastered across subways and on beer cans. Even bags holding cement on the street bear references to the tournament. When I touched down in the city three weeks ago it was buzzing with nervous excitement.  Since then, the emotion has only intensified as Argentina has progressed, suffering a shock early defeat against Saudi Arabia and then turning it around to win the next two matches. As an Australian, my Argentinian partner was worried that if I watched the matches with him I would bring mufa (bad luck). \u201cA los Australianos les falta la pasi\u00f3n\u201d (Australians lack passion), he told me ahead of our first match. The 3am crowds at Melbourne\u2019s Federation Square say otherwise. But it\u2019s true that Australia can\u2019t compete with the incredible way in which football pervades Argentine culture. When Diego Maradona died in 2020, there wasn\u2019t a single Argentinian I know who didn\u2019t shed a tear or pay him tribute in some way. That passion was alive again when we flew from Corrientes to Buenos Aires. That day, Argentina was scheduled to play against Mexico and the air hostesses greeted us wearing blue and white ribbons and face paint. When we landed, the national anthem started playing and passengers clapped along, yelling out the occasional \u201cvamos Argentina!\u201d Then the scramble to get off the plane began. Impatient to get home and watch the match, people began flagging down drivers halfway down the road before they arrived at the taxi rank. It was sheer chaos. I was walking to the shops with my partner\u2019s aunt later that day when guttural screams erupted from the balconies above and taxi drivers started blaring their horns. \u201cGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLLLL,\u201d a group of Argentinians shrieked. Shopkeepers emerged from their businesses and started cheering. Footage from social media showed thousands of people gathered around the city\u2019s iconic Obelisco, drinking beer and singing. \u201cPeople are celebrating like we\u2019ve already won the World Cup,\u201d my partner told his friends later. The same day, Australia won against Tunisia. We\u2019d largely flown under the radar before then, but our victory kicked off a fresh new family rivalry. My partner\u2019s uncle messaged me: \u201cAvisale a tus compatriotas que la pelota es redonda!!! Jaja\u201d (Tell your compatriots that the ball is round!!! Haha). Friends joked that Australia and Argentina could end up playing each other \u2013 the punch line being that Australia would surely lose against Denmark.  When Australia faced off against Denmark, I was at the dentist in Bragado, a humble country town three hours from Buenos Aires. We asked the receptionist to turn the match on and when Mathew Leckie scored, securing our survival in the cup, I held in a scream. The Argentinian sports commentators were baffled at our win, calling it \u201ca surprise\u201d. Fresh from a historic victory, I was no longer \u201cmufa\u201d. I headed to the home of my partner\u2019s friend to watch Argentina play against Poland, sharing mate (a herbal traditional drink) and a picada (snacks). The mood was serious and the room silent. This was make or break. When Argentina scored their first goal, they screamed, jumping to their feet and hugging each other. \u201cArgentina, Argentina, Argentina!\u201d they yelled. After scoring another goal, Argentina was through to the next round to play \u2026 Australia. My partner\u2019s uncle picked us up in his ute after the game. Turning to me, he said, \u201cY ahora? Que hacemos?\u201d (And now? What do we do?), while other friends joked that this will be a war against the kangaroos and carpinchos (capybaras). Yesterday, a waiter muttered as he walked past our table that he hoped Australia would lose the match. Win or lose, as a Socceroos fan in Argentina, I know the banter to come will be brutal. But like they say in Argentina: Que gane el mejor (may the best win)."

                    "body": "It promises to be an exciting couple of months for Tony Roberts, a key part of the Wolves and Wales staff, as his club chase a European place and his country a spot at a first World Cup since 1958. The goalkeeping coach can often be seen orchestrating from the edge of the technical area and Roberts, a colourful character who also counts set pieces as his responsibility, is held in high regard by players and staff. \u201cI\u2019ve always been lively,\u201d Roberts says from Wolves\u2019 training base. \u201cI\u2019m not one to sit still. If I go on holiday I can\u2019t stand the sun, I\u2019d rather go on the bike, so it\u2019s Center Parcs for me instead shooting off wherever.\u201d Roberts is a bubbly personality with a ton of tales from more than three decades in the game. He played until the age of 42, combining turning out for Dagenham &amp; Redbridge, for whom he made more than 450 appearances, with coaching Arsenal\u2019s youth goalkeepers after taking a call from the then academy director Liam Brady while at Queens Park Rangers. He worked with a 17-year-old Wojciech Szczesny as well as with Lukasz Fabianski, with whom he was later reunited at Swansea, and Emiliano Mart\u00ednez, before being appointed assistant first-team goalkeeping coach, which meant working with Jens Lehmann and under Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. \u201cThe most intelligent man in the world,\u201d he says.  Roberts\u2019s energy is infectious. Last year a prank which centred on Adama Traor\u00e9, when he accused the winger of lacking physicality in a team meeting, went viral. Roberts is the only non-Portuguese member of Bruno Lage\u2019s coaching staff but the pair previously worked together at Swansea, where Lage was assistant to Carlos Carvalhal. Reuniting last summer was a no-brainer. \u201cI had just met up with the Wales squad for the Euros and he FaceTimed me at about 11.30pm. I was in bed, hair all over the place, and he said: \u2018Tony, Tony, we\u2019re going into Wolves.\u2019 I was like: \u2018Yeah, yeah, whatever.\u2019 This is the thing about the Portuguese, the WhatsApp group we have, it comes alive at about one o\u2019clock in the morning. They\u2019re crazy. I have to put my phone on silent because I wake up to about 15 messages.\u201d Conversation flows with Roberts, be it discussing his homework on Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1, eating past\u00e9is de nata in the office, dreaming of representing Wales at a World Cup as a kid in Holyhead, or ribbing the Wolves captain, Conor Coady, about the prospect of facing England in Qatar, a reality if Wales secure qualification in June. \u201cOh, the last game \u2026 to win the group? Unbelievable,\u201d he says, deadpan. \u201cIf we get there, I\u2019m going to switch my phone off to stop the temptation of battering Coady because I know he\u2019ll be battering me. We met up for the [Aston] Villa game [the day after the draw] and Coady was giving me stick on the bus. We\u2019ve got to get there first. Touch wood.\u201d The day before a game Roberts holds a goalkeeper meeting to pinpoint opposition threats. S\u00e1, a \u00a37m signing from Olympiacos, has been a major success \u2013 one of the Premier League signings of the season \u2013 and a key part of a sturdy backline; only the division\u2019s top three teams have conceded fewer goals than Wolves and only Manchester City fewer from set pieces. Roberts analysed about 20 of S\u00e1\u2019s games in full before editing clips, split into sections from coping with crosses to shot-stopping, to share with staff. \u201cI liked what I saw. He is quick, athletic and agile, and that\u2019s what the role needs. All the credit goes to him because he has taken everything on board.\u201d  This month the former Wolves goalkeeper Carl Ikeme, who retired in 2018 a year after being diagnosed with acute leukaemia, returned to the club\u2019s Compton base for his first training session in almost five years. \u201cHe slotted right in and, give me a couple of weeks with him, I think he would be back in the squad,\u201d Roberts says, laughing. \u201cIt was brilliant. Brenda upstairs [in the canteen], who has worked here for 20 years, her eyes lit up and they had a little hug.\u201d Roberts, who left home at 16 to join QPR, sees parallels between Wales and Wolves. \u201cThe spirit they\u2019ve got in the [Wales] team, and we\u2019ve got with the staff, it\u2019s just like being here, like being at a club. We can\u2019t wait to go away because you know, [it\u2019s] like somebody [David Edwards] said about [Euro] 2016 being like going on holiday with all of your mates, but you\u2019re playing football matches. I keep saying it: this environment is top and it reminds me of that.\u201d  Lage said Wolves were \u201cwaiting on Tony\u201d after players including the Mexico striker Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez, the Morocco captain, Romain Sa\u00efss, and the Portuguese trio S\u00e1, R\u00faben Neves and Jo\u00e3o Moutinho sealed qualification for Qatar 2022 last month. \u201cAt one point I thought Wales were going to get into a group with Portugal and I thought: \u2018Oh, here we go,\u2019\u201d he smiles. \u201cI was involved in the Wales team when we nearly got there, USA 94. We missed out when [Paul] Bodin hit the crossbar against Romania. I bawled my eyes out that night and to get there now, I think I\u2019d be crying at 52 years old.\u201d Roberts will join up with Wales on the evening Wolves\u2019 campaign ends at Liverpool to prepare for a Nations League opener in Poland and a World Cup play-off final against Scotland or Ukraine. For now, the focus is on Saturday, when Wolves host Brighton hoping to reignite their European push after six defeats in nine matches. Roberts smiles at the suggestion his passport is filling up after trips to Amsterdam, Baku and Rome with Wales at Euro 2020. \u201cWell, I could do with a few more,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want to get into Europe.\u201d"

                    "body": "Huddersfield Giants can \u201cput the town on the map\u201d if they win the Challenge Cup for the first time since 1953 this weekend. The Giants face Wigan Warriors in Saturday\u2019s final at Tottenham, their first major final since 2009 and the first under the stewardship of Ian Watson, who has his own personal score to settle along with several members of his squad.\nWatson and the likes of Tui Lolohea and the Giants\u2019 captain, Luke Yates, were part of the most surreal final in history in 2020, when Salford narrowly fell short against Leeds Rhinos inside an empty Wembley Stadium due to the Covid-19 pandemic. With Huddersfield Town bidding for promotion to the Premier League 24 hours later, the Giants are one half of a momentous weekend of sport for the West Yorkshire town.\n\nAnd Yates insists it is a chance to ensure Huddersfield are considered as a force in rugby league once again after decades in the shadows. \u201cThe whole town is going to be down in London pretty much, so it\u2019s up to us to start the weekend off right,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can put the town on the map but from our own perspective, it\u2019s a chance to do something historic. It\u2019s long overdue for this club, nearly 70 years without a trophy, so it\u2019s time to make some history.\u201d\nHuddersfield full-back Lolohea was also part of the Salford squad that lost 17-16 to Leeds in 2020. \u201cIt was a surreal day,\u201d he admitted. \u201cPlaying in a final is supposed to be one of the best days of your career but it ended up being one of the worst given the result and the fact it was empty, and my family weren\u2019t there. You do wonder if you\u2019ll ever get another chance to do it properly, so to speak, so to have this chance is something we aren\u2019t taking for granted.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a chance to put 2020 right for a few of us but there\u2019s also a chance to get out there and bring success to Huddersfield after so long.\u201d\nLolohea is likely to start at full-back despite the talented youngster, Will Pryce, finishing a 10-match ban in time to return for the final. Pryce could deputise at half-back for the injured Theo Fages, while Wigan \u2013 bidding to win the cup for a 20th time \u2013 could bring their captain, Thomas Leuluai, back into their squad for the game at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium as he nears a return from injury."

A phonetic Latin version from the original Cyrillic script of Shche Ne Vmerla Ukrayina was produced for Scots to practise in advance and fans walking into the stadium will all receive a leaflet explaining the plan \u201cto raise the roof at Hampden Park\u201d.\nFor the professional musician Iryna Ganzha, who is accompanying the singing on the bandura, a 65-string instrument made only in Ukraine, the significance of Wednesday\u2019s match and show of vocal solidarity is immense.\n\n\u201cThis is incredibly important for the whole of Ukraine to see, those who cannot be here, our brave women and men on the frontline,\u201d she said.\n\u201cUkraine is a singing nation, we express ourselves through music, and so the support of the Scottish people standing hand in hand with us and also voice to voice means so much.\u201d\nThere were around 3,500 Ukraine fans in attendance at Hampden Park, including an invited group of orphans, able to witness their team\u2019s surprise 1-3 victory over the Scots. Ukraine will now play Wales on Sunday at 5pm in Cardiff for the chance to qualify for the Qatar World Cup which begins in November.\nEarlier, around the stadium, the usual festival atmosphere was undercut by a pulse of raw emotion. Kostaia waves his flag wildly in time to the folk songs that another supporter is belting out by the car park. She wears the traditional floral crown paired with jeans, like many female Ukrainian fans at the stadium.\nKostaia has travelled from London today: his boss, a Scot, gave him the day off. \u201cToday is very difficult for me because of what is happening in my country.\u201d His eyes are wet. \u201cI want to help but I can\u2019t.\u201d\nBut the show of solidarity is not reserved for Hampden, as fans came together across Scotland on Wednesday evening.\nIn the Highland Perthshire town of Aberfeldy, where the community has welcomed 40 Ukrainians since the conflict began, the Black Watch pub is draped in both saltires and the blue and yellow bands of Ukraine for the occasion.\n\n\u201cThis is an opportunity to have a bit of normality together,\u201d explains the pub\u2019s owner, Gavin Price, who is also manager of Elgin FC. \u201cIt\u2019s been a settling-in process for all of us. It\u2019s a friendly buildup, but when it comes to the football I\u2019m sure both nations wants their team to win.\u201d\nHannah Beaton-Hawryluk, the chair of the Edinburgh branch of the Association of Ukrainians in Great Britain, travelled to Hampden with her son after arranging two coaches to transport fans from the capital to Glasgow.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of light relief for people who arrived here, some with only the clothes they stand up in. It\u2019s about being together and celebrating no matter what the outcome.\u201d\nBeaton-Hawryluk anticipates that singing her national anthem alongside home supporters at kick-off will be an \u201cincredible\u201d moment. She apologises as her voice breaks.\nThe association, which was founded in Edinburgh in 1946, has been so busy offering support to refugees who began arriving in February that she only now has a moment to reflect.\n\u201cScots have been incredible from the moment the war started. They have rallied round and put their arms around Ukraine,\u201d she said."

                    "body": "It is little more than 24 hours from Wales\u2019s biggest game since 1958, their last appearance at a World Cup, when they were knocked out at the quarter-final stage by a 17-year-old Pel\u00e9. The Cardiff City Stadium is going through final rehearsals. Grounds staff trundle horizontally across the pitch with mowers. The plinth, home to the match ball, is packed away, giant Wales and Ukraine flags rolled up, the Uefa banner that carries a message for global peace folded up, and the national anthems sound over the speakers. It is, as Robert Page is at pains to say, business time.\nOnly someone is missing. Instead of the Wales captain, Gareth Bale, conducting the pre-match press conference, it is down to the affable defender Connor Roberts to hold court on the fourth floor overlooking the pitch. \u201cYou\u2019ve had the short straw really, haven\u2019t you?\u201d Roberts says, smiling from ear to ear. \u201cBudget version of Gareth Bale.\u201d\n\nAsked about the condition Bale, among those rested for Wednesday\u2019s Nations League defeat in Poland, is in, Roberts quips: \u201cThe best shape, that\u2019s why he\u2019s not here. He\u2019s played in bigger games than all of us put together probably and it\u2019s going to be another occasion.\n\u201cAs a teammate I\u2019ll be looking towards him to create something for us and to drag this country to a World Cup, like he has done many times, dragging us to wins, dragging us to big moments. He\u2019s an unbelievable player and I\u2019ll be as happy as anyone if he does it again.\u201d\nBale\u2019s tailor-made programme calls. He is finessing the final nuggets of his preparation, receiving treatment from physios to ensure he is tip-top for kick-off. Since last August he has played 330 minutes for his country, 40 more than he has for Real Madrid, whom he departed after nine years and 16 trophies this week. There is no time for hiccups.\n\u201cApologies but unfortunately the game comes first,\u201d Bale says, grinning on a video call an hour later from the training base a few miles outside the Welsh capital.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve only ever played in one World Cup, so this is a stepping stone all of us want to take to play on the biggest level and we have a massive game that we are desperate to win to achieve our goal.\u201d\nFor Bale, whose future is thought to hinge on whether Wales make it to Qatar in November, it is a chance to add a World Cup to his otherwise fully loaded CV. One of his greatest nights came in Kyiv four years ago, when his sumptuous second-half overhead kick helped Real past Liverpool to win the third of his five Champions League titles.\n\nBale\u2019s official take on that strike? \u201cAn OK goal,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s surreal knowing that you\u2019ve been to Kyiv itself and Ukraine \u2013 just seeing the pictures and reading about what\u2019s going on is heartbreaking. Nobody wants a war to happen, we want it to stop as soon as possible. There are so many families and kids stuck there and [who] can\u2019t do anything. It\u2019s a horrible situation. It\u2019s still difficult to talk about because it\u2019s still going on.\u201d\nBale and his teammates recognise everyone outside Wales will be rooting for Ukraine, whose victory in Scotland was their first competitive game for almost eight months. \u201cWe\u2019ll be the most popular team in the stadium, that\u2019s the main thing,\u201d he says. \u201cWe understand the awful things going on in Ukraine. Our hearts go out to the kids, families and people of Ukraine. We\u2019ve all felt awful during this time and not been able to do too much. But it\u2019s a game that we want to win.\u201d\nDavid Brooks, who was given the all-clear last month after cancer treatment, will join the group for what is sure to be an emotionally charged game. Bale\u2019s character will be key to keeping a relatively youthful squad grounded. \u201cWe can\u2019t get carried away with if we\u2019re going to win and qualify,\u201d the 32-year-old says. \u201cWe have to concentrate on this difficult game.\n\n\u201cWe have enough experience in the squad not to do that and the ones who maybe start to sneak off we can bring them back down to earth and make sure they are ready and raring to go for kick-off.\u201d\nBale\u2019s laser focus is on leading Wales to a victory that would make all of his teammates heroes. The ground, he says, will be a cauldron of noise, the supporters Wales\u2019s \u201c12th man\u201d. The speculation around his future \u2013 a move to Major League Soccer has been mooted, as has the unthinkable prospect of him playing regularly in this stadium for Cardiff City \u2013 can wait, even if he is sure to have a stack of offers. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve got loads,\u201d he says with that goofy grin."

Bert van Marwijk was the stop-gap Socceroos coach, a 38-year-old Tim Cahill came off the bench for the final competitive match of his international career, and Australia as a country was collectively trying to figure out where to find goals from open play. In reality that unenviable task actually belonged to Graham Arnold, who was in the stands in Sochi and due to take over from Van Marwijk as soon as the team boarded the plane home from Russia. Peru came away 2-0 victors to mark their first World Cup win in 40 years. Their Argentine manager, Ricardo Gareca, had captured hearts and minds by qualifying the unfancied country for their first finals since 1982.  The game was the last of the Group C fixtures and actually held no tangible ramifications for either side \u2013 France and Denmark had already sealed their progression as the top two nations. But when they meet again for a sudden-death playoff in Doha this coming Monday night (Tuesday, 4am AEST), the outcome will matter very much. The very fact Peru are again so close is wild given Peruvian domestic football is not in a good place and the national team has no names playing for any top-flight European clubs. Sound familiar? Gareca, in managing to squeeze his team into Conmebol\u2019s fifth-placed playoff ahead of Colombia and Chile, is punching above his weight. Australia\u2019s position as of Wednesday morning is also exceeding expectations, mainly because they were lowered in line with recent poor results. Many outside the team camp did not predict they would overcome the United Arab Emirates. There was a sense this stop-start qualifying campaign might have run its course. Except that it hasn\u2019t, and for at least six days more there is a very real possibility that it might not \u2013 that in November the Socceroos might yet play France, Denmark and Tunisia, in an uncannily similar group to 2018. That does not discount previous concerns regarding this side\u2019s ability to do so, which remain. While more compact at the back against the UAE there were still defensive issues, most notably regarding the space repeatedly exposed behind full-back Nathaniel Atkinson, who endured a trying second international appearance against the frankly outstanding 19-year-old winger, Harib Abdalla.  That small matter of scoring from open play remains a problem four years on from that last meeting with Peru and, staying true to form, one of Australia\u2019s two goals came from a set piece. But Jackson Irvine\u2019s opener was fair and square off the back of an attacking phase, and it is very difficult to watch Ajdin Hrustic\u2019s winner \u2013 a volley from a corner \u2013 and feel displeased. Playing for Europa League winners Eintracht Frankfurt has clearly been a revelation for the 25-year-old, who has cemented himself as the bright spark of this qualifying cycle and could be the key to unlocking Peru. And it is not unfeasible. On paper, and based on recent performances, a Socceroos win is unlikely. But just about anything can happen in one-off games, especially those staged in neutral territory and with so much to play for. Arnold has been tapping into this nugget of possibility with his squad by emphasising the advantages of possessing \u201cAussie DNA\u201d. It sounds trite, and also floats rather close to the vexed \u2018Australian values\u2019 discourse. The sentiment, though, has a purpose. And if it works, well hey. \u201cThat is what I have been driving to the boys ... about the Aussie DNA,\u201d Arnold said after the game. \u201cAnd that is fight, scratch and do whatever you have got to do to win the game. However we win it, who cares? Just win it.\u201d  Jagging a win may depend partly on the fitness of his squad members. Forward Adam Taggart is racing the clock as he deals with another injury \u2013 this time to his thigh \u2013 which ruled him out of this match and at this stage appears likely to keep him off the pitch next week as well. Trent Sainsbury, however, may yet be fit to return to his regular central defensive spot, with Arnold indicating his knee was close to better. High-performance boss Andrew Clark appears to have worked a miracle on Aaron Mooy, who lasted the full 90 minutes in his first competitive match all year and is exhibiting more signs of his old self with each incremental gain in fitness. This might all mean very little to Peru, ranked 22nd in the world to Australia\u2019s 42nd. \u201cBut we like people saying that we have no chance or we cannot achieve anything,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been driving into these boys and sometimes you don\u2019t play well, but you can still win by fighting and running and chasing and being aggressive. That also can be a success.\u201d"

                    "body": "Female fans not being allowed inside stadiums has long been the overriding international image when it comes to women and football in Iran and unsurprisingly so. Just over two weeks ago a number of Iranian women tried to get into the Imam Reza Stadium in the north-eastern city of Mashhad to watch the men play their final 2022 World Cup qualifier against Lebanon.  They could not see the game \u2013 the ban has largely been in place since not long after the 1979 revolution \u2013 and then, according to some reports, they were treated to pepper spray by security guards. Despite requests from Fifa, criticism from around the world and calls from the players, authorities have yet to budge. Now, though, Iranian women are competing around the world and aiming to change minds in Tehran. In January, the national team played at the Women\u2019s Asian Cup, their first international tournament. The opening game produced a creditable 0-0 draw with India in Mumbai. A Covid outbreak meant the hosts withdrew from the competition and their results were voided. For Iran, it meant that only their 7-0 and 5-0 losses at the hands of the eventual winners, China, and Taiwan respectively will go down in the record books. There was more to it than mere scorelines however. The coach, Maryam Irandoost, is confident the more the women play competitively around Asia, and one day the world, the greater the push will be to introduce equality in the stands back home, where the regime has made the occasional gesture in allowing women inside only to backtrack soon after. \u201cI have tried for years to change this,\u201d she says. \u201cOur girls qualifying for and playing in the Asian Cup has changed the beliefs of a lot of people in Iran and I think this barrier will disappear in the near future.   \u201cGoing into stadiums is not only about watching the matches and not only about increasing the number of fans. It will also change the vision of women\u2019s football in Iran.\u201d Irandoost, born at the height of the revolution, days after Ayatollah Khomeini returned from exile in Paris to take power, was delighted with the performances in India. \u201cI am not disappointed with the tournament at all,\u201d she says. \u201cOur girls have good potential technically. We have areas in which we have to work on but if there is the same kind of investment and infrastructure as there has been over the past year then we will be at the same level with the best teams in Asia in five or six years.\u201d  Given Iran are ranked 70 in the world, behind Fiji and Haiti, to match Japan, the 2011 World Cup winners, Australia and China by the end of the decade would be quite an achievement for a team only just getting going. \u201cThere is a gap of 50 years behind the best teams in the world,\u201d Irandoost says, \u201cbut families here are very interested in football and this encourages girls to play.\u201d    Irandoost, whose father, Nosrat, was a professional player and now coaches the second-tier men\u2019s club Malavan FC, estimates there are about 2,500 female players in the top league and local clubs. \u201cThere has never been money in female football but the grassroots game is becoming more and more professional. We have a good infrastructure. The interest in the last three or four years has increased significantly. In the past nine months, the federation has had a good plan and that helps us qualify for the Asian Cup.\u201d She says the reasons for the federation\u2019s recent investment and support are complicated. Footballing wise it makes sense because Iran wants to host international tournaments. Recent investment from Saudi Arabia in women\u2019s football \u2013 its national team recently played its first international fixtures \u2013has been noted and there is a feeling Iran has the talent to compete on the world and not just the Asian stage. The men do just that and are preparing for a third successive World Cup and a group containing England and the United States in Qatar. \u201cIt is hard to say which team will advance but our men\u2019s national team have always shown that they can face bigger teams and get good results.\u201d Irandoost says. \u201cIf federation support continues then we can also play England and the USA at the World Cup in 10 years.\u201d  At the moment, Irandoost just wants to build on the progress from the Asian Cup. \u201cThat was very important. Before, many thought that it is OK for girls just to play football but after the Asian Cup people are saying that we could be in big tournaments and even win. Our goals have become much bigger in many ways.\u201d"

                    "body": "\n 12.09am  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n 10.33pm  \n\nCongratulations to Ukraine, then, who will meet Wales in Cardiff on Sunday afternoon to see who\u2019s off to Qatar in November. Commiserations to Scotland, whose long wait for a ninth appearance at the World Cup finals goes on. Thoughts turn to the Nations League, and upcoming games against Armenia and the Republic of Ireland. Thanks for reading this MBM. Nighty night!\n\n\n\n\n 10.31pm  \n\nSteve Clarke gives his verdict to Sky. \u201cIt was a disappointing night. You have to be honest and say the best team on the night won. Congratulations to Ukraine. I wish them luck when they go to Cardiff, but also you have to wish the Welsh luck as well, it should be a great game. Unfortunately we\u2019re not involved. First half we didn\u2019t play enough, we didn\u2019t get the ball down. We made a change at half time but didn\u2019t give ourselves chance to utilise it as we went 2-0 down. After that, we gave it a go. John McGinn missed a big chance that would have given us half an hour to chase the 2-1. We got the goal eventually and we chased it well, we tried as hard as we could. They defended with their lives. It was Ukraine\u2019s night and not Scotland\u2019s. Now is the night to suffer. But we can\u2019t forget the strides we have made over the last couple of years. We have to start building for the next campaign, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do.\u201d\n\n\n\n 10.07pm  \n\nEwan Murray was at Hampden tonight, and his report has landed. Here it is. Reaction from Steve Clarke still to come.\n\n\n\n\n 10.04pm  \n\nAndy Robertson, who has endured a miserable end to the season with both club and country, talks to Sky. \u201cHugely disappointing. We\u2019ve waited a long time for this game. Our performances before this game were really good, but today we didn\u2019t really show up. Ukraine settled into the game quicker than us, and it kind of continued. We knew they were going to get tired, and that was the case, but we gave ourselves too much of an uphill battle. We didn\u2019t play the way we wanted to play, and that\u2019s the most disappointing thing. It\u2019s passed us by now, and after a really positive campaign, we\u2019ve let ourselves down tonight. We have to hurt, reflect, that\u2019s the World Cup gone for another four years, and that\u2019s really harsh. But we have to stick together as a group. All we can say is sorry to the fans for disappointing them, but we\u2019ll dust ourselves down and go again.\u201d\n\n\n\n 9.55pm  \n\nThe magnificent Oleksandr Zinchenko speaks to Sky.  \u201cTo be fair, obviously everyone knows the situation in Ukraine, and every single game for us is like a final game. But we dream like a team to be at the World Cup, and we have one more game, one more final, and we need to win it, we need to take it, otherwise this game is not going to mean anything. We played quite well, apart from maybe 20 minutes in the second half. Scotland is a great team. They play an open game, not our style, but we did well, scoring three goals and we could have scored another. Wales is going to be a massive game for us. We need to show the best performance in our lives, and we\u2019ll see what will happen.\u201d\n\n\n\n 9.48pm  \n\nUkraine\u2019s fans stay behind at Hampden and give it plenty. As they did before the match. If ever some supporters deserved something to cheer about, here they are.\n\n\n\n\n 9.45pm  \n\nTo a man, Ukraine race over to their fans to celebrate. It\u2019s a heartwarming result that keeps their World Cup dream alive, and gives everyone suffering back home a little succour. What a lovely moment. It\u2019s no more than they deserve, either: they were the best team for the vast majority of the game, and could have scored a few more. Simply a class above Scotland, who nevertheless rediscovered their mojo in the closing stages and gave it a good go. Scotland are a team trending in the right direction, but there\u2019s still some way to go, and their wait for a first 21st-century appearance at the World Cup goes on.\n\n\n\n\nUpdated at 11.38pm BST\n\n\n 9.41pm  \nFULL TIME: Scotland 1-3 Ukraine\n\nUkraine will play Wales in Cardiff on Sunday for a place at the 2022 World Cup!\n\n\n\n 9.40pm  \nGOAL! Scotland 1-3 Ukraine (Dovbyk 90+5)\n\nScotland launch one last Hail Mary. Ukraine clear. Zinchenko sends Dovbyk clear into the Scottish half. He draws Gordon and whips into the bottom left!\n\n\n\n\nUpdated at 11.24pm BST\n\n\n 9.39pm  \n\n90 min +4: Zubkov, Mudryk and Shaparenko waste a three-on-one break. Ukraine are doing their level best to keep Scotland afloat.\n\n\n\n 9.37pm  \n\n90 min +3: ... but time really isn\u2019t on their side, not least because Ukraine spend the next minute replacing Stepanenko with Sydorchuk.\n\n\n\n 9.37pm  \n\n90 min +2: Zinchenko grooves down the middle and slips a pass into the box for Zubkov, who is one on one with Gordon. He\u2019s surely going to seal it for Ukraine ... but he whistles his shot wide left! Scotland\u2019s faint hopes remain.\n\n\n\n 9.35pm  \n\n90 min +1: Adams works hard down the left to win a corner. McGinn swings it into the mixer. Hanley rises highest but can only send a weak header miles wide right.\n\n\n\n 9.34pm  \n\n90 min: Scotland have almost certainly left it too late, haven\u2019t they? They\u2019ve got four added minutes to salvage this.\n\n\nUpdated at 9.48pm BST\n\n\n 9.32pm  \n\n88 min: Adams chases a long pass down the right. Ukraine are light in defence, but the striker\u2019s poor control lets them off. Another goal kick.\n\n\n\n 9.32pm  \n\n87 min: Hickey throws in from the right to McGinn, who has the opportunity of returning the ball down the flank and sending his young team-mate clear. McGinn gets too much on the pass it\u2019s a goal kick for Ukraine. The clock ticks on.\n\n\n\n 9.30pm  \n\n85 min: Armstrong drives a cross in from the right. Robertson, coming in from the other flank, opts to trap before shooting. Bad choice. He\u2019s closed down, and the chance is gone. \n\n\n\n 9.28pm  \n\n84 min: ... so instead, Hickey and McGinn try a clever short one, and there goes the chance to put the flapping keeper under more pressure.\n\n\n\n 9.28pm  \n\n83 min: Ukraine are rattled for the first time this evening. Shaparenko is booked for a clumsy challenge on Christie, and it\u2019s a free kick out on the right. A chance to swing one in over the head of the nervous Bushchan!\n\n\n\n 9.27pm  \n\n82 min: Nothing comes of the corner that resulted from McGregor\u2019s hope-salvaging challenge. That was a simply astonishing passage of play.\n\n\n\n 9.26pm  \n\n81 min: McGregor, having just got Scotland back into the game, keeps them in it! Scotland win a corner. Robertson\u2019s delivery isn\u2019t the best. Ukraine clear. Suddenly they\u2019re two on one! Zubkov creams a pass down the middle to release Dovbyk, who is one on one with Gordon. Hampden falls silent. Dovbyk cocks his leg back to shoot ... only for McGregor to turn up and nick the ball off his toe! What an intervention!\n\n\nUpdated at 9.44pm BST\n\n\n 9.24pm  \nGOAL! Scotland 1-2 Ukraine (McGregor 79)\n\nArmstrong crosses. McTominay challenges Bushchan, who flaps again. The ball drops to McGregor, just to the left of the D. McGregor shoots. Bushchan again flaps, letting the ball squirt through his hands. It bounces into the top right, just over the line, Matvienko unable to hook clear in time. This is back on!\n\n\n\n\nUpdated at 9.35pm BST\n\n\n 9.23pm  \n\n78 min: Ukraine replace their goalscorers. Off go Yarmolenko and Yaremchuk, on come Zubkov and Dovbyk.\n\n\n\n 9.21pm  \n\n76 min: Adams dribbles into the Ukraine box from the right. With five yellow shirts in front of him, he does well to power a shot through the thicket of defenders. Bushchan parries. McGinn latches onto the loose ball. His shot is deflected out for a corner, from which nothing comes. Scotland have finally woken up, but have they left it too late?\n\n\n\n 9.19pm  \n\n75 min: Shaparenko shovels a pass down the inside-left channel that nearly releases Zinchenko into the Scotland box. Not quite. Scotland again living dangerously.\n\n\n\n 9.17pm  \n\n73 min: McTominay and Christie ping a couple of quickfire passes down the middle, the ball breaking to Armstrong, who sends a pea-roller straight at Bushchan from the edge of the box.\n\n\n\n 9.16pm  \n\n72 min: Now Tsygankov drops a shoulder to come in from the left. He shoots. Gordon parries. That\u2019s Tsyganov\u2019s last act of the evening: he\u2019s replaced by Mudryk, while Malinovskyi makes way for Shaparenko.\n\n\n\n 9.15pm  \n\n70 min: One goal for Scotland could change everything. A third for Ukraine would end it. And having come so close to getting back into the game, Scotland are in danger of shipping another, McTominay gifting possession to Zinchenko, who nearly dances his way through what remains of the Scottish back line. Hampden feared the worst there.\n\nUpdated at 9.18pm BST\n\n\n 9.13pm  \n\n68 min: McGinn drops to his knees and punches the turf. Still, that\u2019s much better from the Scots, who send on Hendry and Armstrong in place of Cooper and Gilmour.\n\n\n\n 9.12pm  \n\n67 min: The ball drops to McToiminay, just inside the Ukraine box on the right. He traps and shoots. Matvienko blocks. Scotland come again. Christie feeds McTominay down the right. McTominay\u2019s cross is fumbled by Bushchan. The ball drops to McGinn, six yards out. He must score! He tries to steer his header into the bottom right ... and watches in horror as the ball sails inches wide of the post. What a chance!\n\n\n\nUpdated at 9.42pm BST\n\n\n 9.10pm  \n\n66 min: Scotland are beginning to spend a little more time in the Ukraine half, but to little effect. The visitors hold their shape. Gilmour eventually passes the ball out of play under no pressure whatsoever.\n\n\n\n 9.08pm  \n\n64 min: A little bit of space for Adams down the right. He crosses. There\u2019s nobody anywhere near in blue. \u201cGot to hand it to them, this is selfless from Scotland.\u201d Some tinder-dry humour from Simon McMahon, right there.\n\n\n\n 9.07pm  \n\n62 min: Hickey, who is enduring his debut, tries to find Christie in the middle with a low cross. The crowd groan. Then they roar as Adams feeds Christie in on the left. Christie shoots towards the bottom left. An effort on target! But Bushchan smothers, and the flag goes up for offside anyway. That\u2019s got the crowd back onside, for a while, if nothing else.\n\n\n\n 9.05pm  \n\n60 min: Cooper flips Yarmolenko into the air, and is very fortunate to escape censure. Scotland are a ragged mess.\n\n\n\n 9.04pm  \n\n58 min: The Hampden crowd are beeling. First up, Yaremchuk nearly makes it three but his shot-cum-cross from the right dribbles inches wide of the left-hand post. Then McGinn slides in on Stepanenko and is booked for his trouble. Nothing\u2019s going right for Scotland right now, and the home fans aren\u2019t shy in voicing their displeasure.\n\n\nUpdated at 9.42pm BST\n\n\n 9.02pm  \n\n56 min: Scotland are nearly gifted a route back into the game! Bushchan dithers over an admittedly poor backpass, and is closed down by McGregor. His clearing kick ricochets back off McGregor and nearly flies into the goal. Inches away from a total fiasco!\n\n\n\n 9.00pm  \n\n55 min: Tsygankov strides down the left and wins a corner off McTominay. The corner\u2019s sent long. Karavaev whips an ambitious effort over the bar from 25 yards. The home crowd aren\u2019t happy with Scotland\u2019s inability to retain possession at all.\n\n\n\n 8.58pm  \n\n54 min: Yaremchuk overpowers Hanley down the left. Hanley falls over and sends the ball whistling out for a corner. The Hampden faithful demand a free kick, but Hanley was simply outmuscled, that\u2019s all.\n\n\n\n 8.56pm  \n\n52 min: Ukraine are stroking it around imperiously now. Yarmolenko dances down the inside-right channel and creams a shot towards the bottom right. Gordon does well to get down and block, but this is beginning to get ominous for Scotland. A few boos ring around Hampden as a result.\n\n\n\n 8.54pm  \n\n50 min: That was a delightfully calm finish. Scotland are in big bother now. This scoreline doesn\u2019t flatter Ukraine at all.\n\n\n\n 8.54pm  \nGOAL! Scotland 0-2 Ukraine (Yaremchuk 49)\n\nYarmolenko dribbles down the right, reaches the touchline, and cuts back for Karavaev. A cross to the far stick. Yaremchuk rises easily over Hickey, a total mismatch, and guides a header back across Gordon and into the bottom right. So easy.\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated at 11.31pm BST\n\n\n 8.52pm  \n\n48 min: Tsygankov rolls a pass down the left for Yaremchuk, who very nearly gets past Hanley and into the box. Hanley does well to hold his line and shepherd him away from danger.\n\n\n\n 8.51pm  \n\n46 min: Christie is immediately in the thick of it, striding past Mykolenko and rolling a pass towards the in-flight McGregor, romping down the middle. But a promising attack is brought to a halt by the referee, who spots Christie\u2019s sly nudge forward with his arm.\n\n\n\n 8.49pm  \n\nUkraine get the second half underway. Scotland have made a change, and it\u2019s not a particularly surprising one. Dykes, ineffectual and on a booking, has been replaced by Christie.\n\n\n\n 8.37pm  \n\nHalf-time reconnaissance. Ben Fisher was at the Tarczynski Arena in Wroclaw, and his report on the Welsh warm-up for Sunday\u2019s big one has landed. \n\n\n\n\n 8.34pm  \nHALF TIME: Scotland 0-1 Ukraine\n\nA few boos from the home crowd as Scotland traipse off. It\u2019s not that they\u2019ve been particularly bad; it\u2019s just that Ukraine have been demonstrably better. As things stand, Ukraine will travel to Cardiff to play Wales for a place in Qatar.\n\n\n\n 8.32pm  \n\n45 min: Dykes clumsily elbows Stepanenko on the back of the head as the pair contest a high ball. A no-brainer of a yellow card.\n\n\n\n 8.31pm  \n\n44 min: Malinovskyi drags a shot wide right from distance. He should have played Tsygankov clear down the inside-left channel instead. A fine chance to double Ukraine\u2019s lead spurned.\n\n\n\n 8.30pm  \n\n42 min: Some good work by Hickey and Gilmour down the right. The ball\u2019s cut back for McGregor, whose low drive is deflected towards McGinn, just inside the Ukraine box on the right. McGinn tries to round Matvienko, but the Ukraine defender slides in gracefully to scoop the ball off his toe and clear. The crowd wanted a first-time shot from a tight angle. One touch too many.\n\n\n\n 8.28pm  \n\n40 min: Zinchenko has the opportunity to send Yaremchuk clear down the middle, but doesn\u2019t quite get enough juice on the pass and it\u2019s intercepted by McTominay. On the touchline, Steve Clarke continues to exude calm, though he\u2019s got a big half-time team-talk coming up.\n\n\n\n 8.25pm  \n\n38 min: Gilmour finds the full debutant Hickey in space down the right. Hickey floats a cross into the box. Easy pickings for Bushchan in the Ukraine goal.\n\n\n\n 8.24pm  \n\n36 min: Yarmolenko\u2019s goal sucked a good proportion of the atmosphere out of Hampden back there, but after a couple of contemplative minutes, the crowd have rediscovered their voice.\n\n\n\n 8.21pm  \n\n34 min: That had been coming. Ukraine could have scored a couple already, and now they\u2019ve got their reward.\n\n\n\n 8.21pm  \nGOAL! Scotland 0-1 Ukraine (Yarmolenko 33)\n\nScotland\u2019s back three are all over the shop. Malinovskyi passes long down the middle. Yarmolenko, played onside by Hanley, chases clear of Cooper, taking the ball down with one touch, opening his body, and sending a sidefooted lob over the out-rushing Gordon and into the unguarded net!\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated at 9.18pm BST\n\n\n 8.19pm  \n\n32 min: Ukraine have enjoyed 58 percent of possession so far. No great surprise there.\n\n\n\n 8.18pm  \n\n31 min: Ukraine suddenly step up the tempo again, Zinchenko winning a corner down the left. The busy Dykes drops back to make sure nothing comes of it.\n\n\n\n 8.18pm  \n\n30 min: Ukraine spend a little time passing the ball around the back, reducing the pace for the first time this evening.\n\n\n\n 8.16pm  \n\n28 min: Dykes wriggles his way out of a tight spot in his own half and looks long for Adams down the right. Adams collects, turns, then attempts to release the rampaging Robertson through the middle. The pass isn\u2019t up to standard, but once again that\u2019s a decent situation crafted out of very little, and it\u2019ll give Scotland heart.\n\n\n\n 8.14pm  \n\n27 min: Make that five attempts for Ukraine: Yarmolenko hoicks a speculative shot miles over the bar from distance.\n\n\n\n 8.13pm  \n\n26 min: Ukraine by contrast have taken four attempts on goal as well, but two of them have been on target, forcing Gordon into action. Meanwhile here\u2019s Justin Kavanagh with a message from a galaxy far, far away: \u201cZut8-Bilbremza from the planet Joojordinnoggin 74 here, and that earthling Ally McCoist is talking through his holohoopgram. Come on the Scots!\u201d\n\n\n\n 8.12pm  \n\n24 min: Scotland are getting some joy down this left flank. McGregor makes his way down the wing and cuts back for McGinn, who flashes a first-time shot high and wide. That\u2019s Scotland\u2019s fourth attempt on goal, though they\u2019ve yet to get any of them on target.\n\n\n\n 8.11pm  \n\n23 min: ... but this is a good response by Scotland. First Adams goes over in the box as he tries to get on the end of an aimless left-wing cross. It\u2019s never a penalty, but Robertson is soon coming back down his wing. He drops a shoulder to get into the box but delivers neither shot nor cross. The resulting corner is a waste of time.\n\n\n\n 8.10pm  \n\n22 min: Ukraine are also beginning to dominate. Dykes tries to change the flow of the game by sending a long pass down the left for Robertson. It\u2019s not quite accurate enough. A little bit of territorial relief for Scotland, if nothing else.\n\n\n\n 8.08pm  \n\n20 min: Scotland don\u2019t clear the corner, and soon enough Yaremchuk is snatching at a shot from ten yards. The ball fizzes wide right. Ukraine are beginning to carve out chances.\n\n\n\n 8.07pm  \n\n19 min: Another brilliant Gordon intervention! Zinchenko barges McTominay off the ball with indecent ease and launches a quick attack. Tsygankov nearly bursts clear down the inside-left channel, but before he can control and shoot, Gordon is out quickly to divert the ball out for a corner.\n\n\n\n 8.06pm  \n\n18 min: Scotland go up the other end, Robertson winning their first corner of the game. The ball\u2019s sent into the mixer, where Hanley heads harmlessly over. It\u2019s an entertaining game.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.15pm BST\n\n\n 8.05pm  \n\n17 min: Ukraine bustle their way down the left. The ball ricochets into the Scotland box, and the home defence doesn\u2019t deal with it. Suddenly Yarmolenko is free on the penalty spot! He spins and shoots. Gordon gets down to stick out an arm, then smother heroically before Yarmolenko can ram the loose ball home. Another astonishing save from the in-form Hearts keeper!\n\n\nUpdated at 11.36pm BST\n\n\n 8.03pm  \n\n16 min: Robertson tries to release McGinn down the left with a quick throw, but Karavaev comes across quickly to shield the ball out of play. Flower of Scotland meanwhile gets another good airing in the stands.\n\n\n\n 8.01pm  \n\n14 min: Adams drifts in from the right and has the opportunity to play Dykes in down the middle. The pass is no good, but the situation was, and that\u2019ll give Scotland heart. \u201cIt will be interesting to see how Scotland manage to cope with being in England\u2019s usual situation of the rest of the world hoping that they lose,\u201d quips Stuart Rarity.\n\n\n\n 8.00pm  \n\n12 min: Dykes nearly gets a head onto Robertson\u2019s left wing cross. Not quite. Both teams will be happy enough with the way they\u2019ve started.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.30pm BST\n\n\n 7.59pm  \n\n11 min: Malinovskyi goes into the book for booting Dykes up the arse. Tommy Gemmell would have been proud of that one.\n\n\n\n\n 7.57pm  \n\n9 min: Nothing comes of the resulting corner.\n\n\n\n 7.57pm  \n\n8 min: What a save by Gordon! Karavaev crosses low from the right. Yaremchuk tees up Tsygankov, who from the edge of the box sends a rising screamer goalwards. Gordon tips over. It might have been heading over anyway, but that was hit with such venom that he couldn\u2019t take the risk of leaving it. Wonderful football all round.\n\n\n\n 7.55pm  \n\n7 min: McGregor comes clattering into the back of Malinovskyi. It\u2019s just a free kick, though a couple of Ukrainians wonder why the Scotland midfielder isn\u2019t going into the book as well. Lucky boy.\n\n\n\n 7.52pm  \n\n5 min: A little bit of space for Tsygankov down the Ukraine left. His ball rolled inside is cleared by the Scottish defence. Yaremchuk tries to retrieve it with a ludicrous sliding challenge on Gilmour, and he\u2019ll have to spend the rest of this highly charged evening on a deserved yellow card.\n\n\n\n 7.51pm  \n\n4 min: It\u2019s been a high-octane start by Scotland, who are buzzing around all over the place. Dykes hares after McTominay\u2019s speculative ball down the middle but is never likely to get there.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.31pm BST\n\n\n 7.50pm  \n\n2 min: Sky co-commentator Ally McCoist has already delivered the zinger of the evening. \u201cJust about everybody on the planet doesn\u2019t want us to win. In fact, there\u2019s probably people on other planets who don\u2019t want us to win.\u201d That registers a top score of 11 on our patented National Treasure-o-meter.\n\n\n\n 7.47pm  \n\nAmid the hubbub, the referee\u2019s whistle can just about be heard. Scotland, in their famous dark blue, kick off! Ukraine resplendent in yellow.\n\n\n\n 7.45pm  \n\n\u0429\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u0432\u043c\u0435\u0440\u043b\u0430 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438 \u0456 \u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430, \u0456 \u0432\u043e\u043b\u044f. The teams take to the field of play. A trademark Hampden Roar. Ukraine\u2019s players emerge, every man draped in their country\u2019s flag. The national anthem of Ukraine rings around Hampden, sung loudly and proudly, and with great determination. Hundreds of blue and yellow Ukrainian flags aloft in the stands. A riot of colour and glorious noise, some beautiful bedlam. All four corners of Hampden respond with thundering applause.\nUkraine has not yet perished, nor her glory, nor her freedom,Upon us, fellow Ukrainians, fate shall smile once more.Our enemies shall vanish, like the dew in the sun,And we too shall rule, brothers, in a free land of our own.Souls and bodies we\u2019ll lay down, all for our freedom,And we\u2019ll show that we, brothers, are of the Cossack nation.\n... and tell you what, Flower of Scotland isn\u2019t half belted out with feeling as well. What an atmosphere! We\u2019ll be off in a minute.\n\n\n\n\nUpdated at 11.27pm BST\n\n\n 7.36pm  \n\nScotland coach Steve Clarke talks to Sky. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to finally have the game here. It\u2019s obviously great that the Ukrainian team have managed to get themselves in shape. We look forward to a group game. They were unbeaten in their group against the world champions France, which tells you everything about them. We know they\u2019re a good team, and we\u2019ve prepared to play against a good team.\u201d\n\n\n\n 7.26pm  \n\nOleksandr Zinchenko of Ukraine and Manchester City speaks to Sky. \u201cWhen this started on 24 February, nobody was thinking about football, or that this game was going to happen. It\u2019s impossible to describe when you are in this position. As footballers, we have unbelievable lives, we have family, we have facilities, everything around us. But there are people struggling and suffering, it is impossible to describe. My mission is to try to help Ukrainian people as much as I can, to make them proud that they are Ukrainian, that they will live in freedom, and that our nation is never going to give up. Everyone is going to give everything.\u201d\n\n\n\n 7.22pm  \n\nBulging pre-match postbag. \u201cCome on Ukraine!\u2019\u201d begins Shaun Tooze. \u201cI would normally want Scotland to win this but having been displaced from Ukraine to Poland with the beautiful lady and our cat, her family (still there) are asking who I am supporting tonight, so, despite my love for Andy Robertson (Liverpool man) I\u2019m going for Ukraine. What else can I do? Either way, I think it\u2019ll be emotional and probably go all the way to penalties. (We\u2019re still stuck in Poland by the way, because some people in the UK can\u2019t get their heads out of their arses and give us permission for the beautiful dumbass cat.)\u201d\nFor the purposes of balance, Simon McMahon adds: \u201cWhat\u2019s happening in Ukraine is bad, really bad, and I wish all their players, staff, families and supporters well - but this is the World Cup, baby. COME ON SCOTLAND!!!\u201d\n\n\n\n 7.13pm  \n\nIt\u2019s going to be an emotional night for everyone involved. Libby Brooks reports from Hampden, where Scottish and Ukrainian supporters have literally banded together in solidarity. Take it away, everyone.\n\nScots have been incredible from the moment the war started. They have rallied round and put their arms around Ukraine.\n\n\n\n\n\n 7.05pm  \n\nThe winner of this tie will play Wales in Cardiff on Sunday. The Welsh will be going into that one on the back of a decent performance but a disappointing result in Wroclaw, having just lost 2-1 to Poland in their opening match in Nations League Group A4. Jonny Williams opened the scoring on 52 minutes with a fine long-range dipper, but Jakub Kaminski equalised 20 minutes later, and Karol Swiderski completed the comeback with five minutes to go. Rob Page had understandably left the big guns out - no Gareth Bale, for example - so won\u2019t be too concerned ahead of the big one.\n\n\n\n 6.56pm  \n\nThere\u2019s a first start tonight for Aaron Hickey, the latest in Scotland\u2019s seemingly never-ending line of highly promising left-backs. That\u2019s captain Andrew Robertson\u2019s beat, though, so Hickey moves across from his normal position with Bologna to the right, where he replaces Stephen O\u2019Donnell. Liam Cooper stands in for the injured Kieran Tierney on the left side of the back three, while Lyndon Dykes pairs up with Che Adams up front.\n\n\n\n 6.47pm  \nThe teams\n\nScotland: Gordon, McTominay, Hanley, Cooper, Hickey, Gilmour, McGregor, Robertson, McGinn, Adams, Dykes.Subs: Hendry, McKenna, Marshall, Ferguson, Brown, Stewart, Kelly, Souttar, Armstrong, Christie, O\u2019Donnell, Taylor.\nUkraine: Bushchan, Karavayev, Zabarnyi, Matviyenko, Mykolenko, Stepanenko, Yarmolenko, Malinovsky, Zinchenko, Tsygankov, Yaremchuk.Subs: Riznyk, Dovbyk, Bondar, Kacharaba, Pyatov, Mudryk, Syrota, Sydorchuk, Sobol, Shaparenko, Pikhalyonok, Zubkov.\nReferee: Danny Makkelie (Dordrecht).\n\n\n\n 6.45pm  \nPreamble\n\nThe world\u2019s eyes are on Hampden as Ukraine\u2019s men\u2019s football team play their first game since the invasion of their country by Vladimir Putin. This World Cup qualifying play-off semi-final was due to be played in March, but the conflict led to its postponement. Many of Ukraine\u2019s men were called up to the army, but Oleksandr Petrakov\u2019s team were given special dispensation to prepare for this rearranged fixture at a training camp in Brdo, Slovenia. Now they\u2019re looking to give their folks back home a little joy by qualifying for the finals in Qatar. \u201cWe are going to try to make them happy and proud,\u201d says Oleksandr Zinchenko. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that all in Ukraine who have this opportunity is going to watch us, and we are going to feel this support 100 percent.\u201d\nThe awful backdrop to this game might not help Scotland attract many neutral viewers this evening. But they will have a packed and partisan Hampden roaring behind them. While Ukraine are looking to add to their one and only appearance at the World Cup, in 2006, Scotland have dreams of their own, hoping to make it for the first time since 1998. History is on their side: they\u2019ve made it to the finals on eight previous occasions, and have emerged triumphant from both of their qualification play-offs, against Wales in 1977 and Australia in 1985. Ukraine have yet to progress from any play-offs, after five attempts. Scotland have also won the one and only meeting between the teams in Glasgow: 3-1 in 2007.\nThe winner of tonight\u2019s match will face Wales in the play-off final on Sunday. May the best team win, and whatever the result, Scotland stands with Ukraine. Kick off is at 7.45pm BST.\n\n"

                    "body": "The Indian government has become embroiled in a diplomatic row with Gulf states after two ruling party spokespeople were accused of making Islamophobic and derogatory comments insulting the prophet Muhammad. The ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) suspended its national spokesperson, Nupur Sharma, and expelled its Delhi media head, Naveen Kumar Jindal, after their comments went viral in the Middle East, where they were met with a chorus of diplomatic anger. The governments of Qatar, Kuwait, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Afghanistan and Pakistan described the comments as \u201cinsulting\u201d.  In a television debate 10 days ago on India\u2019s rightwing news channel Times Now 1, Sharma made derogatory comments about Muslim worship and the prophet Muhammad and mocked her Muslim debate opponent. Following an outcry over the comments, Jindal posted a tweet about the prophet \u2013 that he has since deleted \u2013 which also caused anger. The Indian ambassador to Qatar, Deepak Mittal, was summoned and given an official reprimand \u201cexpressing the disappointment of the State of Qatar and its total rejection and condemnation to the controversial remarks made by an official in the ruling party in India against Prophet Muhammad\u201d. Qatar demanded an apology from the Indian government, accusing it of provoking \u201ca cycle of violence and hate\u201d. Lolwah al-Khater, Qatar\u2019s assistant foreign minister, said India was reaching \u201cdangerous levels\u201d of Islamophobic discourse. Kuwait\u2019s foreign ministry also summoned its Indian ambassador, Sibi George, to express its \u201ccategorical rejection and condemnation of the insulting statements\u201d made by the BJP spokespeople. Oman\u2019s grand mufti, Ahmad bin Hamad al-Khalili, waded in with strong words, condemning \u201cthe insolent and obscene rudeness of the official spokesman for the ruling extremist party in India against the messenger of Islam\u201d. Pakistan\u2019s new prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, who had recently sent conciliatory messages to his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, said the comments were an example of how \u201cIndia under Modi is trampling religious freedoms and persecuting Muslims\u201d. As calls for a boycott of Indian goods began to gain traction in the Gulf, an important trading and energy partner for India, the BJP government tried to dismiss the comments as \u201cfringe elements\u201d within the party and said they \u201cdo not, in any manner, reflect the views of the government of India\u201d. The BJP immediately removed both spokespeople and said \u201cstrong action has already been taken against those who made the derogatory remarks\u201d. However, many observers pointed out that the two had faced no action when their comments had first been flagged over a week ago by Muslims and civil rights activists in India. Instead there had been calls by BJP supporters for the arrest of the journalist who had called out the Islamophobic comments on social media.  On India\u2019s rightwing news television channels, anti-Muslim rhetoric is expounded nightly by supporters of the BJP but is rarely, if ever, met with apologies or retractions. The incident highlighted the increasing tension between the domestic policies of the BJP \u2013 a Hindu nationalist party accused of systematically marginalising and overseeing the persecution of the country\u2019s 200 million Muslims \u2013 and India\u2019s strategic foreign objectives and growing trade with the Muslim world. Nearly 40% of India\u2019s gas requirements come from Qatar and about 6.5 million Indians live in the Gulf region. The diplomatic incident occurred as the Indian vice-president, M Venkaiah Naidu, visited Qatar to further deepen ties between the two countries. The decision to expel Sharma and Jindal was met with anger from some BJP supporters, who called the decision \u201ccowardly\u201d. A video is circulating online showing the militant Hindutva leader Yati Narsinghanand doubling down on their comments about the prophet Muhammad and calling all Muslims \u201ccriminals\u201d. A US state department report released last week documented killings, assaults, and intimidation of religious minorities in India. India\u2019s government bristled in response, calling the report \u201cill informed\u201d and \u201cbiased\u201d."

                    "body": "  7.40pm    I\u2019ll leave you witb Ben Fisher\u2019s report from Villa Park. Thanks for your company \u2013 goodnight!     Updated at 9.47pm GMT    7.29pm    Still want more? Bet you do.      7.29pm         7.27pm   Full time: Aston Villa 1-3 Liverpool  Peep peep! Liverpool move back up to sixth after winning a highly entertaining game at Villa Park. Mo Salah, Virgil van Dijk and the teenager Stefan Bajcetic got the goals, with Ollie Watkins replying for Villa. The highlight was Trent Alexander-Arnold\u2019s outrageous pass which led to the first goal, but both teams played some good stuff and created numerous chances.  Updated at 7.28pm GMT    7.22pm    90 min Robertson\u2019s corner is too close to Olsen. There will be four minutes of added time.     7.22pm    89 min Doak nutmegs Digne with a gorgeous dummy, then runs at Mings to win a corner.     7.20pm    87 min: Liverpool substitution The exciting Scottish teenager Ben Doak is coming on for his Premier League debut. He replaces the flawed but irrepressible Darwin Nunez, who played a big part in the third goal.   Updated at 7.21pm GMT    7.19pm    87 min \u201cNunez does seem like a strange mix of chaotic, imposing, energetic, occasionally brilliant, and sometimes baffling,\u201d says Peter Oh. \u201cI see a dash of early Andy Cole, yes, plus a teaspoon of Wout Weghorst, a tablespoon of Marko Arnautovic, one cup Miroslav Klose and a pinch of Andy Carroll.\u201d     7.18pm    86 min: Triple substitution for Villa Danny Ings, Philippe Coutinho and Leander Dendoncker replace Kamara, Buendia and Bailey.     7.16pm    84 min Young\u2019s attempted clearance hits Robertson and rebounds towards goal, forcing Olsen to plunge to his right to make the save.     7.15pm    82 min Nunez\u2019s shot on the run is pushed away to his right by the diving Olsen. He is flawed, no doubt, but he\u2019s absolutely relentless.     7.14pm    The relentless Nunez did superbly to chase his own heavy first touch and keep the ball in play near the byline. His cross was palmed away by Olsen to Bajcetic, who calmly dinked the ball over Olsen and rattled it through the legs of Mings on the line. He took that with such composure.     7.13pm   GOAL! Aston Villa 1-3 Liverpool (Bajcetic 81)  What a lovely goal from the teenager Stefan Bajcetic!   Updated at 7.23pm GMT    7.11pm    78 min: Double substitution for Liverpool Joe Gomez and Stefan Bajcetic replace Jordan Henderson and Trent Alexander-Arnold.  Updated at 7.12pm GMT    7.10pm    77 min Digne\u2019s deep cross just evades the diving Bailey, who is then accidentally caught on the side of the head by Robertson\u2019s studs. There\u2019s a break in play while he receives treatment.     7.09pm    76 min \u201cNunez!!!!!\u201d says Jeff Sachs. \u201cRob, this guy is a .....\u201d I\u2019m reserving judgement until this time next season. I think he\u2019s got something about him.     7.08pm    75 min: Nunez misses a great chance! Salah, deep in his own half, puts Nunez through on goal with a beautifully precise pass. Nunez runs half the length of the field, away from Konsa, but then shoots wide of the far post with his left foot.     7.07pm    75 min Even if Villa lose, Unai Emery should be encouraged by a vibrant attacking performance, particularly in the second half. They\u2019ve looked pretty, pretty good.     7.06pm    74 min Watkins goes over in the area after a shoulder charge from Matip. The referee Paul Tierney decides it\u2019s a fair challenge.     7.05pm    73 min Alisson mistimes a punch past his own left-hand post, under pressure from Watkins. The referee gives a foul against Watkins. It looked a bit soft but was probably fair enough.     7.03pm    70 min \u201cLooking at Darwin\u2019s shirt number,\u201d begins Peter Oh, \u201cI wonder how prolific Liverpool\u2019s previous No27 Divock Origi would have been if had enjoyed similar amounts of playing time.\u201d Had those minutes been as sub, he\u2019d have scored 424 goals, all against Everton.      7.01pm    69 min Liverpool were rocking for a while after Watkins\u2019 goal but they\u2019ve calmed things down a bit now. I\u2019m surprised Villa haven\u2019t brought on Danny Ings yet.  Updated at 7.02pm GMT    6.59pm    67 min Elliott is playing on the left of the attack, which is a fairly unusual position for him.     6.58pm    66 min: Double substitution for Liverpool Harvey Elliott and Naby Keita replace Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Thiago.      6.56pm    64 min Lots of Villa pressure now, with Robertson and then Van Dijk making important interceptions in the space of 10 seconds.     6.53pm    61 min Villa break four on four, and McGinn\u2019s stinging shot from 20 yards is well blocked by Henderson.      6.52pm    Villa deserve that for a much-improved performance in the second half. Douglas Luiz, 30 yards from goal in the inside-right channel, curled a beautiful cross to the far post, where Watkins pulled away from Matip and strained his neck muscles to plant an excellent header back across Alisson. That\u2019s a really good goal.     6.51pm   GOAL! Aston Villa 1-2 Liverpool (Watkins 59)  Now then.   Updated at 7.03pm GMT    6.50pm    58 min Digne\u2019s cross is dummied by Watkins and then mishit by Bailey, unmarked 15 yards out. That\u2019s the second time tonight that he hasn\u2019t connected properly with a decent chance.     6.48pm    56 min Buendia plays a good pass down the right to Bailey, who can\u2019t decide whether to shoot or cross towards Watkins, and does neither.     6.48pm    56 min \u201cIn Suarez\u2019s first full season at Liverpool, he broke the record for the number of times he hit the post,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cIt was the season after that he really took flight and flourished. So far this year, Nunez has hit the woodwork more than anyone else in the league. Next year, Norwich had better look out\u2026\u201d     6.47pm    54 min Erm, Amazon Prime are now telling me the event (sic) is over, and all we\u2019re seeing is a \u2026 oh never mind, the live pictures are back now, just in time to see Alisson make a comfortable save from Digne.     6.46pm    53 min Fabinho, 25 yards out, shapes a nuce curling shot just wide.      6.45pm    52 min \u201cCareful what you say about Cole and Nunez!\u201d says Daniel Sixsmith. Ha. I was a huge fan of Cole (see below) and am only talking about his 1995-96 season really. It was partially a compliment, in that, like Nunez, he never hid, no matter how much he was struggling. And also, like Nunez, his movement was fantastic.    Updated at 7.10pm GMT    6.44pm    51 min: Good save from Olsen! Liverpool break from a Villa free-kick, with Salah scurrying 70 yards into the Villa area. Eventually he hits an off-balance shot that is blocked by the legs of Olsen, with the ball then ricocheting off Douglas Luiz and just wide.     6.41pm    49 min Moments later, Buendia sweeps a first-time shot into the side netting.     6.41pm    48 min: Chance for Villa! McGinn sweeps a long pass out to Digne on the left and hares towards the area. Digne curls a deep cross that finds McGinn unmarked at the far post, but the ball bounces awkwardly and he can\u2019t decide whether to go at it with his head or his left foot. In the end it hits his shoulder and runs through to Alisson.  Updated at 6.41pm GMT    6.39pm    46 min: Watkins has a goal disallowed! Villa thought they had scored after 39 seconds of the second half. Watkins finished confidently after a through ball from Buendia (I think), but the flag went up and replays showed he was just offside.  Updated at 6.39pm GMT    6.37pm    46 min Peep peep! Liverpool begin the second half, with no changes on either side.     6.35pm    \u201cAgree with you about Fowler vs. Villa,\u201d says Edward Ricketts. \u201cPerhaps the only other goals in that category are his brace at Old Trafford in \u201895 - the effortless thunderbolt with little backlift into the top corner, followed by barging Gary Neville out of the way and casually chipping one of the best keepers of all time. The sheer joy of young unfettered talent personified!\u201d      6.33pm    \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the other five in Liverpool\u2019s front six (with Robertson and Alexander-Arnold backing them up) are in tune,\u201d says Andy Flintoff, \u201cbut Nunez, despite all his energy, is\u2019t quite there yet. It\u2019ll probably come with time, but it\u2019s clear his current role is to be the furthest forward, creating the space for the others to work in.\u201d     6.24pm    Half-time reading      6.24pm    \u201cI cannot figure out whether Nunez lacks skill or luck, but he has missed so much...\u201d says Jeff Sachs.  He reminds of Andy Cole in his first few years at Manchester United \u2013 misses plenty of chances, and can look very clumsy, but constantly gets in good positions because of his movement and irrepressible attitude. Timo Werner was fairly similar at Chelsea. Either way, he\u2019s great fun to watch because something is always happening.     6.21pm   Half time: Aston Villa 0-2 Liverpool  Liverpool are on course for a third consecutive league victory after an eventful first half at Villa Park. Mo Salah scored the first after two brilliant passes from Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson, and Virgil van Dijk pinged in the second with the help of a deflection off Ezri Konsa. The two-goal margin is about right, though the score could easily be 4-2 or 5-3 to Liverpool.     6.19pm    45+2 min: Chance for Nunez! Alexander-Arnold curls a devastating free-kick from the right that bounces up towards the unmarked Nunez, eight yards out. He rides the bounce well but then hits a first-time shot straight at Olsen.     6.17pm    45+1 min Three minutes of added time.     6.17pm    45 min Looks like it\u2019s Van Dijk\u2019s goal.      6.17pm    45 min Henderson pings a long-range volley straight at Olsen.     6.15pm    44 min Villa created some good chances early on but Liverpool have been more comfortable defensively in the last 10-15 minutes.      6.14pm    42 min We\u2019ve just seen a couple of replays of the second goal, and I don\u2019t think Van Dijk\u2019s original shot was on target. That said, for the time being it has been given to him.     6.13pm    40 min There\u2019s a bit of swagger about Liverpool\u2019s attacking play, and on this form you\u2019d fancy them to comfortably finish in the top four.      6.10pm    Alexander-Arnold\u2019s outswinging corner ricocheted across the area to Salah, back to goal on the left edge of the six-yard box. He laid it off to van Dijk, who hooked a left-footed snapshot that deflected off Konsa (I think) and into the net. That might go down as an own goal in fact.  Updated at 6.11pm GMT    6.09pm   GOAL! Aston Villa 0-2 Liverpool (Van Dijk 37)  Another right-wing corner, another Liverpool goal.   Updated at 6.21pm GMT    6.08pm    36 min Oxlade-Chamberlain finds Nunez down the left. He cuts inside Konsa and hits a shot that deflects across the face of goal and is taken off the toes of Salah by Mings.      6.06pm    34 min \u201cWhile my jaw dropped seeing Trent\u2019s outside-of-the-boot pass to Robertson, watching the replays showed that Robbo knew or just expected that pass to be made,\u201d says Neil Mackie. \u201cLike it was just an everyday thing. Trent got the ball and Robbo just hared into the space assuming he would be found. It constantly amazes me what top flight footballers just take for granted.\u201d     6.03pm    32 min \u201cTAA\u2019s playing like he\u2019s trying to prove a point,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cAlisson is playing like the last month or so didn\u2019t happen. And Nunez is playing like, well, like he\u2019s been embodied by the concept of chaos personified. Football is great again!\u201d     6.03pm    31 min Henderson curls an excellent first-time pass over Digne to find Salah in the inside-right channel. He teases Mings but then drags a shot wide of the near post.   Updated at 6.04pm GMT    6.02pm    29 min \u201cWhat a crazy match!\u201d says Joe Pearson. \u201cDifficult to look away to compose a pithy email. Can\u2019t imagine how hard it is to MBM!\u201d It could be worse.      6.00pm    28 min Digne goes over in the area after a challenge from behind by Alexander-Arnold. The referee isn\u2019t interested and Liverpool break. The off-balance Konsa loops a backpass miles in the air, and Nunez charges onto the ball to shin an impatient volley from the edge of the area that is kicked away by Olsen.  Updated at 6.02pm GMT    5.57pm    25 min Robertson\u2019s precise cross is headed over by Nunez, though he was again offside. It wasn\u2019t a great attempt mind you.     5.56pm    24 min Salah wins a corner on the right. Robertson\u2019s deep inswinger is headed away bravely by Konsa, a split-second before he is clattered by Van Dijk.     5.55pm    23 min The state of this pass.      5.52pm    20 min: Matip has a goal disallowed! Robertson\u2019s free-kick was headed authoritatively past Olsen by Matip, but the flag went up straight away and replays confirmed he was offside.     5.51pm    19 min Robertson stays down after Douglas Luiz stands on his achilles. I\u2019m pretty sure it was accidental, but it was still a nasty challenge. Robertson eventually gets to his feet.     5.49pm    17 min: Another chance for Villa! McGinn, on the right, curls a booming, inswinging cross towards Watkins at the far post. He stoops towards the ball but heads it into the ground and straight at Alisson. At the other end, Nunez misses a great chance, though he was offside so it wouldn\u2019t have counted.   Updated at 6.13pm GMT    5.48pm    17 min \u201cOoh, ooh, I was at that game!\u201d says Ian Copestake of Robbie Fowler\u2019s goal. \u201cStaunton returning to his old team for a horsing leading to a vision of Fowler\u2019s divinity.\u201d     5.47pm    16 min This is a really open game. Liverpool look very sharp, especially their full-backs.     5.46pm    13 min: Great chance for Bailey! Villa should be level. Buendia\u2019s low cross towards Watkins was diverted by Van Dijk into the path of Bailey, unmarked ten yards out, but he mistimed his shot and sliced the ball up in the air. What a chance!     5.43pm    12 min \u201cI\u2019m reminiscing Fowler\u2019s goal vs Villa,\u201d says Ali Mukadam, \u201cturning Staunton and hitting that shot.\u201d I absolutely love that goal. I\u2019m struggling to think of a goal that better demonstrates the sheer, mischievous fun of being young and utterly brilliant at football.   Updated at 5.47pm GMT    5.42pm    11 min \u201cRemind me, why did Emery return to the Premier League?\u201d says Jeff Sachs. \u201cHe must be a masochist.\u201d     5.41pm    9 min Bailey wriggles into the area from the right and hits a rising drive that is comfortably saved by Alisson. It\u2019s been a cracking start to the game.     5.40pm    8 min Alisson makes a superb point-blank save from Watkins, though it wouldn\u2019t have counted as Watkins was just offside.     5.39pm    7 min That was Robertson\u2019s 54th Premier League assist, which is a record for a defender. He was level on 53 with Leighton Baines.     5.39pm    Robertson\u2019s corner from the right was eventually cleared to Alexander-Arnold, 40 yards from goal. He cut across an awesome pass with the outside of the right foot that found Robertson on the right side of the penalty area. Robertson was alert and deft enough to half-volley a first-time pass across the face to Salah, who had a simple tap in from eight yards.  Updated at 5.45pm GMT    5.37pm   GOAL! Aston Villa 0-1 Liverpool (Salah 5)  Mo Salah gives Liverpool the lead with a brilliant goal!    Updated at 5.54pm GMT    5.36pm    4 min Mings is still down. He collided with Olsen and then fell awkwardly. That was such a good chance for Nunez, who chose the wrong time to demonstrate his unselfish side.     5.35pm    2 min An even better chance for Liverpool! Robertson curls a wonderful low cross towards Nunez, who inexplicably dummies the ball instead of taking the shot. Mings collides with the keeper Olsen and Digne beats Salah to the ball at the far post.     5.33pm    1 min An early half-chance for Villa. Buendia lifts a pass over the top towards Watkins, who forces a shot from the edge of the area that is saved to his right by Alisson.     5.31pm    1 min Peep peep! Villa kick off from right to left as we watch.      5.31pm    The players gather round the centre circle to pay tribute to George Cohen, one of the Boys of 66, who died last week.    Updated at 5.56pm GMT    5.28pm    There\u2019s a cracking atmosphere at Villa Park, and the players are ready for business.     5.23pm    \u201cHas the Klopp chap changed his team\u2019s attacking shape,\u201d says Ian Copestake, \u201cas there seems to one be one forward fewer? And Oxlade.\u201d I think it\u2019ll be 4-3-3 with Oxlade-Chamberlain or maybe Nunez on the left, but it could potentially be a 2-0-8.     5.09pm    The last six games between these teams at Villa Park - an unashamedly arbitrary cut-off point - have finished 0-6, 1-2, 5-0, 7-2, 1-4 and 1-2. Thirty one goals in six games!     5.09pm    Villa start the game in 12th place, though they will move into the top ten if they win tonight. Liverpool are seventh; victory at Villa Park would move them above Brighton into sixth.     5.08pm         4.57pm     Today\u2019s Premier League scores  Brentford 2-2 Tottenham Hotspur Crystal Palace 0-3 Fulham Everton 1-2 Wolves Leicester 0-3 Newcastle Southampton 1-3 Brighton       4.31pm   Team news  Danny Ings, who scored both goals in Villa\u2019s win at Brighton before the World Cup, is only on the bench. Liverpool welcome back a number of big hitters, including Alisson, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Virgil van Dijk.

Referee Paul Tierney.  Updated at 5.32pm GMT    4.30pm   Preamble  Hello and welcome to live coverage of Aston Villa v Liverpool at Villa Park. On the face of it, the winter break came at a good time for these teams, who both had unexpectedly difficult starts to the season. But actually, both had started to hit form before they were rudely interrupted by Qatar. Villa won their first two league games under Unai Emery, and Liverpool won four matches in a row in all competitions. That run ended when they lost a Carabao Cup thriller at the Etihad in the week, but Jurgen Klopp should still be confident that the real Liverpool will stand up for the rest of the season. Injuries remain a problem - Luis Diaz, Diogo Jota and Roberto Firmino are all out - but many of their key players have had a good break. Mo Salah, Thiago Alcantara and Andy Robertson didn\u2019t go to Qatar; Trent Alexander-Arnold played only 33 minutes. Villa will be without their World Cup winner Emi Martinez, who is otherwise engaged with a Kylian Mbappe doll. Matty Cash, Jan Bednarek and Leander Dendoncker have been back a while and should be available. Kick off 5.30pm.  "

                    "body": "Gareth Southgate has emphasised that Harry Maguire retains his full support but knows he cannot give the beleaguered defender any guarantees over a starting place in his England team at the World Cup later this year.\nMaguire had hoped the international break would offer him the chance to reset after his torrid period at Manchester United. During the 29-year-old\u2019s last game for United, the Champions League last-16 exit at home to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, the Old Trafford crowd cheered his withdrawal six minutes from time.\n\nHowever, when Southgate started him in England\u2019s second game of the break \u2013 the 3-0 win over Ivory Coast on Tuesday \u2013 home supporters booed when Maguire\u2019s name was announced before kick-off. There were further boos when he took his first touches.\nMaguire has excelled for England under Southgate, playing a key role in the runs to the 2018 World Cup semi-final and the Euro 2020 final. There is the feeling in some quarters that his credit in the bank is so extensive that he is certain to start at the World Cup in Qatar, which kicks off in late November, especially as Southgate\u2019s experienced options in central defence do not run particularly deep.\nThe manager, though, made it clear that was not the case. \u201cI\u2019m not going to give any of them that because they\u2019ve got competition for places,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cThis week, we\u2019ve seen Marc Gu\u00e9hi and Ben White play extremely well. I think Tyrone Mings\u2019s record of clean sheets with England is outstanding. We weren\u2019t able to get John Stones on the pitch [because of injury].\n\u201cYes, Harry has been in our No 1 pairing through those tournaments and has my full backing and support. But equally I\u2019m not going to say to anybody in the middle of March that they are a guaranteed starter in the World Cup team. That\u2019s not the environment I\u2019m looking to create and not the competition we are going to need.\u201d\n\nThough Southgate is looking forward to Friday\u2019s World Cup draw in Doha, when England will be in the top pot of seeds, the shockwaves from Maguire\u2019s treatment by the fans continue to reverberate and the manager is painfully aware the incident threatens to destroy one of the foundation stones of his tenure.\nHe has been able to rebuild the connection between the team and the support, and players want to report for international duty these days, which was not always the case in the past. However, Southgate warned after the Ivory Coast game that there could be a regression in the relationship.\n\u201cDon\u2019t think for one minute the other players are not looking at that and thinking: \u2018That could be me one day,\u2019\u201d Southgate said. \u201cThat has been one of the problems of playing for England.\u201d\n\nHe did not pull his punches at Wembley, calling the booing of Maguire an \u201cabsolute joke\u201d and questioning what had gone through the minds of those who had done it \u2013 if anything. \u201cI would imagine if you were to ask people why they were doing that they wouldn\u2019t be able to answer,\u201d he said. \u201cIt becomes a mob mentality.\u201d\nIt is rare to hear a manager criticising the fans of his own team, although Southgate was quick to absolve the proper supporters of any blame; the \u201chardcore\u201d, as he called them, who were \u201ctrying to get Maguire\u2019s name sung\u201d. Yet if Southgate\u2019s comments came from a position of strength, they also betrayed the depth of his anger."

FA Cup: Connor Wickham closed out Forest Green\u2019s win over South Shields with a Puskas Award contender from near the halfway line. Spotting the South Shields goalkeeper Myles Boney a few yards out of his goal, the well-travelled striker tried his luck and sent a sensational chip into the top corner, the only place the frantically back-pedalling Boney couldn\u2019t reach it. It was Wickham\u2019s second of the game and almost certainly the best goal he\u2019s ever scored. Have that!

Sheffield United 3-2 Burnley (Robinson 65)  Championship: It\u2019s been quite the game of two halves for Jack Robinson, who was directly responsible for two Burnley goals in the first half, but has since atoned. After helping to set up Sheffield United\u2019s second goal against the league leaders, he\u2019s just scored their third. Burnley are serioously under the cosh and struggling to deal with United\u2019s set pieces.      1.52pm    Yellow card watch: There are 11 Premier League footballers who are just one booking away from a Premier League suspension and also harbouring hopes of going to the World Cup. Only a cynic would suggest that some of them might deliberately try to pick one up today or tomorrow in order to give themselves next weekend off and hugely reduce their chances of picking up an dream-ending injury ahead of Qatar, but for curiosity\u2019s sake, they might be worth keeping an eye on. Those to watch: Chris Mepham (Bournemouth), Aleksandar Mitrovic (Fulham), Alexis Mac Allister (Brighton), Amadou Onana (Everton), Diego Dalot (Manchester United), Thilo Kehrer (West Ham), Fabian Schar (Newcastle), Gabriel Jesus (Arsenal), William Saliba (Arsenal), Rodrigo Bentancur (Tottenham) and Harry Kane (Tottenham).

It\u2019s currently 2-2 in a thriller, with Sheffield United coming from behind twice despite a first-half horror show from Jack Robinson. Not content with turning a Manuel Benson cross into his own net with a bullet header, the Sheffield United defender subsequently dawdled on the ball just outside his own penalty area, allowing Benson to rob him of possession and fire past Wes Foderingham. Iliman Ndiaye scored for Sheffield United in the first half, while Robinson was instrumental in creating United\u2019s second, which was just scored by Oli McBurnie.

                    "body": "Billy Bingham, who led Northern Ireland to successive World Cups in 1982 and 1986, has died at the age of 90. He had lived with dementia for 16 years.\nBingham made 227 appearances for Sunderland and won the league championship with Everton in 1963 but it was with Northern Ireland, for whom he won 56 caps and managed for 17 years in total, that he enjoyed his most celebrated successes.\n\nBorn in east Belfast, and an electrical engineer by trade, he was part of the Northern Ireland team that reached the quarter-finals of the World Cup in 1958. They did not qualify again until Bingham guided them to Spain in 1982, when Gerry Armstrong\u2019s goal famously defeated the hosts in Valencia, and to Mexico four years later. Northern Ireland have not qualified for a World Cup since. He also won the British Championship with Northern Ireland in 1980 and 1984.\nIn a statement, Bingham\u2019s son David said: \u201cDad was diagnosed with dementia back in 2006 and I think it is a tribute to his will that he managed another 16 years from that diagnosis to the time he passed away. He passed away peacefully last night at 10.30pm in a care home in Southport. We are very proud of all our dad achieved.\u201d\nThe Irish Football Association has also paid tribute to their former manager. \u201cBilly holds a unique place in the football hearts of Northern Ireland,\u201d said the Irish FA in a statement. \u201cBilly was a tricky winger in the days when such a position was revered, but there was more to him than wing play. \n\u201cBilly was not afraid to mix it when needed, had an eye for goal and a wonderful tactical and positional brain \u2013 attributes which would come to the fore in his managerial career. He was everything that a Northern Ireland manager needs to be: tactically astute, innovative and inspirational.\n\u201cHe led the team to British Championship glory in 1980 and 1984, qualified for two World Cups in 1982 and 1986, and recorded the first home and away victories over West Germany in the qualification for the Euros in 1984. \n\u201cHis greatest achievement was probably the qualification of the team for the second phase of the World Cup in 1982 with the historic and unexpected victory over Spain in Valencia. The Association would wish to send its condolences to Billy\u2019s wider family circle.\u201d\n\nBingham came through the ranks at Glentoran before joining Sunderland in 1950. He also had spells with Luton, Everton and Port Vale, where a broken leg forced him to retire from playing aged 33. In his first managerial post he led Southport to promotion from the Fourth Division. \nHe then combined his first, four-year stint as Northern Ireland manager with jobs at Plymouth Argyle and Linfield before managing Greece for 18 months. In 1973 he succeeded his former manager Harry Catterick at Everton, where he came close to winning the league in 1974-75 but was sacked in January 1977.\n\u201cEverton Football Club is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Billy Bingham MBE,\u201d stated the club on Friday. \u201cThe thoughts of everybody at Everton are with Billy\u2019s family and friends.\u201d Bingham also managed PAOK Salonika and Mansfield Town until starting his second, hugely successful 13-year spell as Northern Ireland manager in 1980."

He should be a little sharper for the run and is a fair price at around 4-1 to give Australia a first-ever success in this race.\nYork 1.45: Eilean Dubh had little chance from a wide draw at Pontefract last time but remains feasibly handicapped on his winning form over track and trip in May.\nNewmarket 2.05: A slow pace did not do Truely Aclaimed any favours at Ayr last month but she still came home a worthy winner and can continue her progress here.\nYork 2.20: A poor turnout and Thunderous could benefit if Franny Norton gets a soft lead.\nNewmarket 2.40: The form of last month\u2019s Britannia Handicap at Royal Ascot looks as strong as always and Jimi Hendrix, third home there, can give it another boost here.\nAscot 3.00: Tone The Barone has been a regular scorer on the all-weather over the last two seasons but the 16-1 shot was a dual winner over this course and distance in 2020 and is now just 1lb higher than for the second of those wins.\n\nNewmarket 3.15: Brian Meehan\u2019s juveniles generally find plenty for a run so the fact that Isaac Shelby ran out an impressive winner first time up at Newbury in May is encouraging ahead of his move into Group Two company here.\nAscot 3.35: The eye-catcher in a tight race is Best Lightning, the 20-1 outsider, a smooth Group Two winner in Germany last time and only the second horse that former Group One-winning jockey Andreas Suborics has sent to Britain since turning to training in 2016.\nNewmarket 3.50: Samburu lost little in defeat in the Group Three Jersey Stakes last time when he perhaps made his effort a little earlier than ideal, and he remains well-weighted judged on his handicap debut win at York in May.\nYork 4.05: Intellogent has been another fine advertisement for Jane Chapple-Hyam\u2019s stable in three runs since arriving from France and his Royal Ascot form makes him a big player at around 9-1.\nYork 4.40: The return to York\u2019s five-furlong track could see Winter Power rediscover something close to her best form but after four straight subpar performances, she is an unappealing favourite. Three-year-old Royal Aclaim has something to find on the ratings but more than enough scope to do so after two easy wins so far.\nInspiral not so Prosperous\nJohn Gosden\u2019s renewed relationship with Frankie Dettori suffered its first significant setback at Newmarket on Friday as Inspiral, the Coronation Stakes winner at Royal Ascot, lost her unbeaten record behind Prosperous Voyage in the Group One Falmouth Stakes.\nInspiral was sent off at 1-7 but Gosden suggested afterwards that he was not happy with the way she was travelling from an early stage as Prosperous Voyage, at 16-1, made much of the running to beat Inspiral by nearly two lengths.\n\u201cNormally you wouldn\u2019t go from a huge performance at Ascot and come here but having run only the once [this season] it made sense,\u201d Gosden said. \u201cBut she\u2019s just run a little flat and that can happen when you go to Royal Ascot and the July meeting, particularly when you\u2019ve been off since the previous October. You could tell early on, little bit flat and the ground probably quick enough. We\u2019ll freshen up and go again.\u201d\n\nProsperous Voyage was only 10th behind Inspiral at Royal Ascot but Ralph Beckett, her trainer, believes a straight track helped her to reverse the form. \u201cMaybe Inspiral didn\u2019t turn up today, maybe she bounced but this filly ran her race and that is all that really matters if you are me,\u201d Beckett said. \u201cI think the key to her really is a straight track. The Sun Chariot [at Newmarket in October] is the obvious race for her. We will keep bringing her back to Newmarket.\u201d\nInspiral is the joint shortest-priced beaten favourite in a Group One Flat race in Britain or Ireland since Order Of St George failed to justify odds of 1-7 in the Irish St Leger in 2016. The last horse beaten at a shorter price in any British race was Last Hoorah, at 1-10, in a three-runner juvenile contest at Chepstow in August 2021. "

                    "body": "Billy Bingham, who has died aged 90, did more for Northern Ireland in World Cup football than any other figure, both as a lively and elusive outside-right when they reached the 1958 finals in Sweden and later as their inventive and resilient manager, taking them twice to the finals \u2013 in Spain in 1982 and in Mexico in 1986. He was an important member of the Northern Ireland team that reached the finals of the 1958 World Cup, eliminating Italy en route. Not only did Northern Ireland become one of the smallest nations to have made the finals up to that point; they progressed to the quarter-finals in Sweden by qualifying ahead of Argentina and Czechoslovakia in the group stages. Bingham, on the right wing, appeared in all five of his side\u2019s matches during the tournament, including in the quarter-final against France, which was lost 4-0. Things might have worked out better in that match had Jimmy McIlroy accepted an early chance made for him when Bingham, in a pre-planned move, flicked on Danny Blanchflower\u2019s throw in. But the opportunity was spurned, and the weary effort then collapsed. It was 24 years before Northern Ireland appeared again in the World Cup finals, and on that occasion Bingham was instrumental once more \u2013 as manager. Qualification for the 1982 finals was made easier by a dispensation that allowed two teams, rather than one, to qualify from the European groups. But for a side with Northern Ireland\u2019s limited resources, to qualify at all was a great achievement; and by that time there was no George Best to inspire the side. For the matches in Spain, Bingham profitably used Gerry Armstrong \u2013 then no more than a reserve centre-forward at Watford in the Second Division \u2013 on the right wing, and he had clever midfield players in Martin O\u2019Neill and Sammy McIlroy. Their finest game was against the hosts, Spain, in the oppressive heat of Valencia, where Mal Donaghy was unfairly sent off but Armstrong scored the goal in a 1-0 victory. Bingham\u2019s bold decision to use Norman Whiteside, at 17 the youngest player to figure in the World Cup finals, paid off handsomely as his side topped their group above Spain, Yugoslavia and Honduras. But having got through to the second round of matches, Bingham\u2019s men drew with Austria, 2-2, and lost 4-1 to France, which ushered them home.  In the 1986 qualifiers Bingham\u2019s well organised team won four and drew two of their eight matches, including crucial home and away victories against Romania, allowing them passage into the finals along with England, who were also in their qualifying group. Forty-year-old Pat Jennings was a superb goalkeeper and Whiteside confirmed his promise. In the finals in Mexico they could only draw with Algeria, then lost 1-2 to Spain and 0-3 to Brazil in the group stage, yet getting there at all had been remarkable.  Born in Belfast, Bingham attended Belfast College of Technology and planned to become an apprentice electrician at the Harland &amp; Wolff shipyard. But he shone in schoolboy football and in 1948 joined the local semi-professional club, Glentoran, in the Irish League, along with his near neighbours, the Blanchflower brothers Danny and Jackie. Initially a small, light, quick centre-forward, before long Bingham realised that his physique suited him better as a right-winger. He made 60 appearances for Glentoran over two years until, in 1950, he was transferred to Sunderland, who had just finished third in the First Division. Sunderland paid \u00a310,000 for him, a huge fee then, and he joined a team of stars: Len Shackleton, Ivor Broadis and Trevor Ford among them. At Sunderland for eight years, he made more than 200 appearances, but the club\u2019s best finish during his time at Roker Park was fourth in 1954-55. In 1958 Sunderland were relegated from the top division for the first time in their history, and that summer Bingham, who had an uneasy relationship with the manager, Alan Brown, was told the club were minded to transfer him to Luton Town. Shocked at first, he eventually agreed: Luton were deeply unfashionable compared with Sunderland, but at least they were in the First Division.  As it turned out, Bingham arguably had his finest years at Luton, curling his insidious crosses into the murk at a home ground with inadequate floodlights. Luton surpassed themselves in reaching the 1959 FA Cup final at Wembley, though there they lost 2-1 to a Nottingham Forest team reduced to 10 men for most of the match. In 1961, after Luton had been relegated, Bingham moved again, this time to Everton. He stayed a couple of seasons at Goodison Park, winning a First Division championship medal in 1962-63 before moving in 1963-64 to Third Division Port Vale, where he won the last four of his 56 caps for Northern Ireland, a record at the time. He had made his international debut in 1951 as a 19-year-old.  Bingham had qualified as a senior coach at the age of 28, so when he stopped playing at age 33 after breaking his leg at Port Vale, he moved into coaching at Fourth Division Southport in 1965, rising to become manager later that year when Willie Cunningham was sacked. In his first full season in charge (1966-67), Southport finished in second place, gaining their first ever promotion. By October 1967 he had been appointed part-time Northern Ireland manager, while also taking charge of Plymouth Argyle between 1968 and 1970, followed by a season as manager of Linfield, steering them to the 1970-71 Irish League title.  Having experienced moderate success with Northern Ireland, including narrowly missing out on qualification for the 1970 World Cup finals, in 1971 he resigned from the job \u2013 and his Linfield post \u2013 so he could manage Greece. After they failed to qualify for the 1974 World Cup finals, the Greeks let him go in 1973, and he returned to the UK to manage Everton for three full seasons, in which they finished 7th, 4th and 11th \u2013 coming close in the 1974-75 season to winning the title. A poor run of results led to his sacking in early 1977, after which he moved back to Greece for an unsuccessful six-month spell with PAOK Salonika and then to Mansfield Town, where he spent almost two years with little to show for his efforts. He became manager of Northern Ireland for a second time in 1980 and was appointed MBE in 1981. After the great successes of 1982 and 1986, Bingham struggled with a gradually ageing side, and the retirements of O\u2019Neill, Jennings and Whiteside restricted his options. Returning to type, Northern Ireland were unable to qualify for either the 1990 or the 1994 finals, prompting Bingham\u2019s resignation in 1993. The end was disappointing, but nonetheless he bowed out as the most successful manager in Northern Ireland\u2019s history. He was later director of football at Blackpool, and in 2008 came briefly out of retirement to act as a scout for Burnley. He was twice married and divorced \u2013 first to Eunice Oliver and then Rebecca Van Strang. The two children from his first marriage, David and Sharon, survive him. \u2022 Billy (William Laurence) Bingham, footballer and manager, born 5 August 1931; died 9 June 2022"

                    "body": "Naomi Short has been playing football on and off for nearly 30 years and cannot wait for England to host the Euros this week, but she\u2019s even more excited that her 13-year-old daughter will witness the biggest ever women\u2019s sporting event. \u201cIt\u2019s brilliant \u2013 they\u2019ve got the future I probably would have wanted,\u201d she says. Short, 45, plays for Longford Park Ladies FC in Manchester, a grassroots team that was set up by mothers five years ago to train alongside their children when there were hardly any teams around for women who just wanted to play for fun. Now the team is getting excited for a summer of women\u2019s football along with thousands of other grassroots and amateur sides. Many of these were set up or massively expanded after a successful Women\u2019s World Cup in 2019 catapulted England\u2019s Lionesses into the limelight. Short says \u201cloads\u201d of people at Longford Park Ladies FC have secured tickets for Euros matches, although she laments that the number of tickets could not meet unprecedented demand. Still, she is heartened that more than half a million have been sold and considers it a sign of the sport\u2019s meteoric ascent. \u201cIt\u2019s good that people want there to be more seats available and to play at bigger stadiums.\u201d Other female footballers who spoke to the Guardian shared their elation that England is hosting the tournament this July, with many securing tickets for matches as well as booking tables in pubs for sold-out fixtures, organising tournaments and taster sessions, hosting screenings and throwing parties. The goal is to celebrate beyond the FA\u2019s official fan festivals while boosting the sport\u2019s profile further in the hope of replicating the explosion in signups that followed the Women\u2019s World Cup.  Some are doing this in imaginative ways. AFC Leyton, one of the largest women-only football clubs in the UK, with more than 600 players, has created a custom beer in collaboration with the local brewery Signature Brew. \u201cWe will be drinking a pint of our very own red-coloured IPA at the brewery to launch the Euros in a couple of weeks\u2019 time,\u201d says AFC Leyton\u2019s Louise McGing. Lots of players have tickets for multiple fixtures and some are planning days out. \u201cThe girls are buzzing about what players play in their own positions and where their own footballing journey could take them,\u201d McGing says. She says that whenever there is a large event, the club always sees an uptick in interest, and this has been boosted by fixtures increasingly appearing on mainstream television, and teams securing high-profile global brand sponsorships. \u201c[It\u2019s] raising the profile of elite female football players, which is in turn inspiring the next generation of female footballers. It\u2019s long overdue and long may this continue,\u201d she says. Teams in the north-east have also been finding ways to access games, despite the fact the region isn\u2019t hosting any. Gary Sykes, who runs Washington AFC in Tyne and Wear, is taking 150 female players to Sheffield to watch Sweden v Netherlands in the evening, and has organised a tournament with local teams during the day. \u201cAt the time when it was announced there wouldn\u2019t be any football locally, there was a lot of disappointment,\u201d\u2019 he says, adding that his team are now \u201cvery excited\u201d to see a match even if they have to travel for it. Sport England said it was hard to tell exactly how big a boost the Euros had given to grassroots football, since numbers were still recovering after the onset of the Covid pandemic, but 460,000 more women started playing football after the World Cup in 2019 and the body has tried to \u201cget ahead of the game\u201d by announcing \u00a31m in funding for adult recreational football last year. Reaching the UK\u2019s diverse communities is also a key aim. This is shared by Queen\u2019s Roar, an arts and community initiative in Newham, the most ethnically diverse borough in the UK, which is bringing together local grassroots teams, fans and artists to create a local strip, football anthem and opportunities for more women to play. \u201cIt\u2019s about making it visible so other girls and women in the area feel they can participate in the future,\u201d said the creative producer Beki Bateson. Munaf Abrham, the chair of Leytonstone FC, agrees things have changed dramatically in recent months; his club, which is rooted in the local south-Asian community, set up girls and women\u2019s teams 18 months ago, and the growth has been \u201cabsolutely mad\u201d. He is thrilled because \u201cthere haven\u2019t been many girls over the years playing football from the south Asian community\u201d, and applications this year for female teams have outnumbered those for male squads. He is planning to get tickets for the team members for the quarter- and semi-finals in London as well as hosting a big community event showing the matches on a screen. \u201cEveryone\u2019s looking forward to the Euros; the girls are looking forward to it. Every weekend at training they\u2019ll say to me: \u2018Coach, have we got our tickets sorted out?\u2019\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 5 July 2022.

                    "body": "It augurs well when the breaks start going your way. Aaron Ramsdale knew it, judging by his fist-pumping reaction to Patrick Bamford\u2019s penalty miss at Elland Road; Mikel Arteta almost certainly did, if his visible ecstasy at seeing Leeds correctly denied another go in injury time is any measure. For the second time in 72 hours Arsenal rode their luck in navigating a tricky away assignment and with each banana skin avoided the sense grows that they are on to something special. Nine wins from 10 top-flight games bear out that impression. It is Arsenal\u2019s best start to a Premier League season, a point ahead of the Invincibles\u2019 2003 tally, and their strongest overall in 118 seasons of trying. Even the most jaded among their cohort can allow themselves a glint in the eye. Arteta is asked every week to set a hare running and announce his team are in a title race; already cautious in public he will never dangle that kind of red meat but if they sustain this form the question will become redundant.  Can they do it? A four-point lead can be overhauled within a week but feels sufficient to allow the discussion. October always seemed a month that would set a realistic tone for Arsenal: nine games presented an absurd schedule and Arteta, always more forthcoming in this topic, highlighted that it would take delicate management. But they have won all five to date, putting down the required marker in beating Spurs and Liverpool so thrillingly, and the end of the tightrope is nearing. The World Cup break appears an obvious point for a full assessment. Arsenal play only four more times in the Premier League before then and if they have maintained this pace by the 14-game mark there will be no flying beneath the radar. Southampton and Nottingham Forest will hold few fears over the next fortnight and Wolves, their final opponents until Boxing Day, may be regarded similarly unless a new manager bounce pervades Molineux. The visit to Stamford Bridge on 6 November may be where things get interesting: if Arteta can get the better of Graham Potter, a kindred spirit but several steps behind the Spaniard in his reshaping of Chelsea, Arsenal will have answered most of the relevant questions by the time eyes switch to Qatar. One doubt will linger into next year. Arsenal were due to host Manchester City on Wednesday until their rescheduled Europa League tie against PSV Eindhoven took priority. Should current form be repeated to the letter they may not have to beat Pep Guardiola\u2019s side this season, but reality will not be so simple: Arsenal should have prevailed when they met at the Emirates Stadium on New Year\u2019s Day, instead reverting to modern-day type and falling short. They have not won that fixture in the league for seven years and it feels like the final frontier to potential greatness. Arteta will not mind its postponement, even though his players would have fed on the atmosphere that has, against stereotype, made their home a bearpit. While Arsenal are playing scintillating football, Martin \u00d8degaard threading killer passes through to Gabriel Martinelli and Bukayo Saka on either side while Gabriel Jesus sets a rattling tempo up front and a reborn Granit Xhaka runs the midfield, their manager knows where the frayed edges are.  The squad is thin: he complained about having only 16 senior outfield players available to face Bod\u00f8/Glimt last Thursday yet could hardly point to a distended injury list. Jesus was excused from the journey but Arteta would ideally have left others at home too. The minutes required of senior players are stacking up and fatigue increases the likelihood of mistakes such as the handball by William Saliba that offered Bamford his chance. A visit from City might have fully exposed the cracks Leeds failed to wrench open. Few sides can operate at full tilt when asked to perform twice a week but the concern is that, if they are wobbling now, another month of the same will be too much. It would help if PSV can be seen off so Arsenal\u2019s final group stage match against FC Z\u00fcrich can be entrusted to the hopefuls. For once they are blessed with enviable strength in defence but the rest of Arteta\u2019s first-choice side picks itself: lose a couple of the front six for an extended spell and the tightly wound nature of their game may unravel. That can be remedied in the January transfer market, where funds will be made available for the depth Arteta needs if the biggest prize looks attainable. Perhaps he and his conditioning staff will, through skill and chance, find they navigate the campaign with no big-name absences beyond the existing injury to Emile Smith Rowe. If they can manage that, anything seems possible. Fortune and brilliance have combined to win many a title race: Arsenal can trust in the latter but must hope their stock of the former remains bountiful."

It\u2019s been a while.     5.49pm    What\u2019s not working for West Ham? Jacob Steinberg takes a look at their difficult beginning to the campaign.      5.39pm    Here\u2019s all the weekend Premier League team news in one place, including bonus material such as referee appointments.      5.32pm    A quick line from the Thomas Frank press conference. Brentford\u2019s Danish boss was asked about the Denmark national team\u2019s new jerseys for the World Cup finals in Qatar, released on Wednesday and designed as a protest against the host nation\u2019s human rights record. Kit manufacturers Hummel explained their \u201ctoned down\u201d design, with near-camouflaged crests and chevrons, on social media, saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t wish to be visible during a tournament that has cost thousands of people their lives. We support the Danish national team all the way, but that isn\u2019t the same as supporting Qatar as a host nation. \u201cWe believe that sport should bring people together. And when it doesn\u2019t, we want to make a statement.\u201d Frank, who coached Denmark at the under-16, under-17 and under-19 levels before taking over the first team at Brondby, was pragmatic when asked about the kit. \u201cOf course I read the news about the black shirt,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s for Denmark to answer that question and not me. I could call my good friend if you want, (Denmark head coach) Kasper (Hjulmand) to say anything about it. \u201cI think it\u2019s a very sensitive subject that is not for me to say publicly what I think about that right now. Obviously I have my thoughts.\u201d (PA Sport)     5.23pm    New Brighton (not the one on the Wirral) boss Roberto De Zerbi won\u2019t be tinkering with anything just yet as he prepares for his first game in charge, a trip to Liverpool. The Italian was hired as Graham Potter\u2019s replacement earlier this month but has spent little time with his squad due to a number of players being away on international duty. \u201cI believe I can do a good job,\u201d De Zerbi told reporters. \u201cI didn\u2019t work too much with the team because today would be the first day I can have training with everybody but I don\u2019t want to change too much. \u201cFor me it is difficult because I would like to put my idea but it is not right to change so much in the first moment. \u201cThe team already did very good. The head coach has been changed but I cannot do and I don\u2019t want to do the same that Potter was doing. \u201cI hope I can do whatever is up to me and up to my knowledge. In this moment I have a lot of thoughts about not to do too much but at the same time I want to do something. This is the main point.\u201dDe Zerbi added: \u201cJurgen is a great manager. He achieved great results in (Borussia) Dortmund, great results in Liverpool and has a great personality. \u201cHe is a very smart man, charismatic and I am proud to play against him, against his squad in that stadium. Of course the first game in Anfield, the beauty of this is something unique but I have to keep the focus on my team, the instructions to give and what we can do. \u201cThe game with Liverpool is very difficult for us but (also) for every team. I believe in my players. Liverpool is one of the best teams in the Premier League but also in Europe and the world. \u201cWe know it will be difficult but I trust in my players to play a good game and in the end we will look at the result.\u201d De Zebri spoke in both English and Italian during his press conference. \u201cWe want to learn English as fast as possible because I would like to do the interviews in English,\u201d he said. (PA Sport)     5.12pm    Peter Oh writes: \u201cThat is impressive, that over 70% of PL fantasy managers have the Arsenal forward in their squad. I wonder if an even higher percentage have Haaland. If so, the young Norwegian could reasonably claim that he is more popular than Jesus!\u201d Indeed. Let\u2019s hope Haaland doesn\u2019t make that comment to the American press.      5.06pm    As I write this, there are 51 days, 13 hours, 53 minutes and 31 seconds until the start of the World Cup in Qatar. It may be too late to start a Panini sticker album (although I do keep seeing them in the supermarket and have to spend the next few minutes talking myself out of the idea) but it\u2019s the right time to read our latest power rankings. England have actually gone up a place but, at ninth, our boffins don\u2019t expect them to make the quarter-finals.      4.58pm    It\u2019s coming up to 5pm so what a perfect time to launch The Fiver.      4.49pm    Goals, goals, goals. And more goals. Eat my goals. Fulham\u2019s Aleksandar Mitrovic can\u2019t stop scoring them and if anyone slightly tuned out of football matters during the international break they\u2019d have missed the centre-forward racking up four in two games for Serbia including a hat-trick in a 4-1 win over Sweden. He\u2019s now in that rare space, also occupied by Erling Haaland, of averaging better than a goal per game this season: Mitrovic\u2019s current count for club and country is 10 in nine games.  Mitrovic now has 50 for Serbia and he\u2019ll look to add more in a Fulham shirt when he takes on his former club, Newcastle, at Craven Cottage at the weekend. Here\u2019s Fulham boss Marco Silva on Mitrovic perhaps trying even harder to score in a bid to put one over his former team. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t need that motivation (of playing against his former club), he doesn\u2019t need to play against Newcastle to be motivated. \u201cMitrovic is always full of motivation to play with a Fulham Football Club shirt or with his national team, that is the motivation for him, to play football matches, to be involved with his team-mates, to keep playing with his connection with me and my staff as well, that is the motivation for him, he doesn\u2019t need other motivations. \u201cAfter, when he is on the pitch, he is always doing something to help the team to win football matches.\u201d  Updated at 4.50pm BST    4.38pm    Leeds boss Jesse Marsch is hoping director of football Victor Orta commits his future to the club after reported interest from Premier League rivals Chelsea. Orta is understood to be among the leading candidates for a new sporting director\u2019s role at Stamford Bridge alongside Bayer Leverkusen\u2019s Tim Steidten after Christoph Freund\u2019s decision to stay at RB Salzburg. Marsch said: \u201cI\u2019m not surprised he has been linked to some big jobs. I can unequivocally say he is very happy here and we have an incredible relationship. \u201cAlong with (chief executive) Angus (Kinnear) and (chairman) Andrea (Radrizzani) we\u2019ve worked really well as a team and worked well in the transfer window. \u201cEvery window has set us up for success and I\u2019m hopeful he stays because of his hard work and expertise.\u201d Marsch said he was the happiest he had been during his managerial career, adding: \u201cTogetherness and commitment here is the highest I have seen. I don\u2019t want to leave. If I got an offer to go anywhere I would stay in this spot. More happy than I have ever been in my career.\u201d (PA Sport) Marsch has also given a team news update. \u201cArchie Gray had an incident at home and has fractured his big toe, so he\u2019ll probably be out for another two weeks. \u201cStuart [Dallas] is making a really good recovery. He went down to see specialists and they feel like he\u2019s doing really well and on track. Obviously, it\u2019ll still be some time for him.  \u201cAdam Forshaw twisted his ankle this week. It\u2019s not so bad, but he won\u2019t be available this weekend.  \u201cOther than that every single player is available for us. So we\u2019re feeling like we\u2019re getting to full strength.\u201d \u201cEvery single player\u201d includes Patrick Bamford and Rodrigo, who scored four times at the start of the season before being sidelined with a shoulder injury.      4.27pm    Arsenal fans will want him to go in hard but there\u2019s a big downside if Gabriel Jesus picks up a yellow card in Saturday\u2019s north London derby. A fifth booking of the season would rule the Brazilian out of next weekend\u2019s game with Liverpool, not good for Gunners supporters or indeed fantasy managers (he\u2019s owned by over 70% in the official PL game).  Boss Mikel Arteta is well aware of the situation. \u201cIt\u2019s a thin balance,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s in his nature, he gets a lot of contact and puts his foot and his body on the line in every situation. \u201cHe\u2019s a been a bit unlucky with the number of yellow cards that he had. Some of them we could not prevent because they were a little bit disciplinary, but yeah we want to avoid that for sure.\u201d Note: Anthony Taylor is the ref for Saturday\u2019s game. He took charge of the Gunners\u2019 opening win against Crystal Palace, booking two Arsenal players (Ben White and Granit Xhaka) but not Jesus.  Updated at 4.28pm BST    4.16pm    \u201cIt is not ideal. We have had better days on the injury front,\u201d said Aston Villa boss Steven Gerrard in Friday\u2019s press conference. Villa have lost summer signing Boubacar Kamara until after the World Cup with a knee injury and left-back Lucas Digne is also set for a spell on the sidelines. Further tests confirmed former Marseille man Kamara had sustained ligament damage which will require a lengthy spell of rehabilitation. The loss of Kamara is a further setback for Villa, who saw defender Diego Carlos, another summer arrival, suffer a ruptured Achilles in only his second appearance. Digne, meanwhile, was also forced to pull out of the French squad because of a heel problem and is set for an unspecified period of rehabilitation. \u201cBoubacar will be missing until after the World Cup unfortunately, so that is a huge blow,\u201d said Gerrard ahead of Sunday\u2019s trip to Leeds. \u201cIt is him and obviously Diego Carlos, two of our signature signings, who are going to be missing for a large part of the season.\u201d Digne has been playing through injury and Gerrard told a press conference: \u201cLucas Digne is a unique situation. He has a heel problem, and it is one we will have to monitor as we go along. \u201cIt is very difficult to put a timescale on Lucas, but he will certainly be missing in the coming weeks. \u201cWe are due to assess that situation in just over two weeks to see whether his heel situation has healed enough for us to progress it. \u201cIt is quite a frustrating one and again another big player missing for us, but is obviously gives others opportunities to step forward.\u201d (PA Sport)     4.05pm    Brendan Rodgers is still the best man for the job at Leicester because he\u2019s looked in the mirror and told himself that. A home game against Nottingham Forest awaits on Monday night. \u201cI\u2019m honest and reflective with myself but I also know I\u2019m the best person to help this team move forward,\u201d said Rodgers. \u201cI haven\u2019t (spoken to the owners). The ownership trust me and expect I will turn it around. If they don\u2019t they will tell me. \u201cOur conversations are very open and honest. I have seen Top (chairman) a number of times and we speak when he\u2019s over. \u201cI have had nothing but support from the club but they also understand where we sit and that\u2019s why we look forward to the game on Monday. \u201cIf you are bottom and have lost six out of seven you are not going to be flavour of the month. You don\u2019t isolate yourself, that\u2019s important, I love working with these players. \u201cI believe, like last season, we will come good. It has been a tough start but I see these players work and it ultimately gives me strength.\u201d Team news: Wilfred Ndidi should shake off a hamstring injury after returning from international duty early while Ricardo Pereira (Achilles) and Ryan Bertrand (knee) remain out. (PA Sport)  Updated at 5.32pm BST    3.54pm    Some team news for Saturday lunchtime\u2019s north London derby. I\u2019ll start with a stat and an eye-popping one at that.  Arsenal have lost just one of their last 29 Premier League home games against Spurs (W17 D11), and are unbeaten in their last 11 against them at the Emirates since a 3-2 loss in November 2010.  Arsenal have captain Martin Odegaard fit and available to face Tottenham. The Norway international missed the win over Brentford with a calf issue but is ready to return having featured for his country in the past week. Thomas Partey suffered a knee injury while away with Ghana but should come back in, while Oleksandar Zinchenko (calf) is also training. However, Mohamed Elneny (hamstring) and Emile Smith Rowe (groin) will miss the Premier League match. Spurs have a number of injury concerns before making the short trip to face their local rivals. Hugo Lloris (thigh), Ben Davies (knee) and Dejan Kulusevski (hamstring) are all doubts for the Emirates clash. Lucas Moura could be back in contention following a lengthy absence with a calf issue. (PA Sport)     3.44pm    News (not good) from the United States.      3.36pm    Southampton remain a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma kinda team. Here\u2019s boss Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl talking about the weeks ahead and hinting at a future career in F1. \u201cI sometimes speak about the car. You put it in the garage and two weeks later you bring it out and you can drive 300 (mph) if you want but in football it is not like this. \u201cIt is always a team that needs to work, to fight together and find the rhythm. \u201cIn the last weeks we didn\u2019t really have a lot of chance for rhythm because of the international break and the special situation with the death of the Queen, so we had some delays. \u201cThis is the reason why we are now looking forward to a very intense time with a lot of games coming up and hopefully we can get on a successful run.\u201d Next up for Southampton, who sit 14th, is Saturday\u2019s 0-0 draw at home with Everton followed by a trip to Manchester City the following week.  Updated at 3.37pm BST    3.27pm    Want to know more about new Brighton boss Roberto De Zerbia as he takes charge of his first Premier League game, Saturday\u2019s trip to Anfield? Here\u2019s Fabrizio Romano\u2019s delve into the Italian\u2019s background. \u201cDe Zerbi\u2019s obsession, like Guardiola\u2019s, is to dominate the ball and control games. His Sassuolo team had the second-highest possession statistics in Serie A in 2019-20 at about 59.5%.\u201d      3.17pm    West Ham and Wolves have scored six Premier League goals between them in a combined 14 matches this season \u2013 the same number as Erling Haaland has managed in his last two top-flight home games. Hammers boss David Moyes is aware of the problem as his team head into the weekend down in 18th spot with just four points from seven starts. Saturday evening\u2019s rivals, Wolves, are one place above in 17th. \u201cWe\u2019ve not scored enough goals,\u201d said Moyes. \u201cWe\u2019ve hit the woodwork maybe six times, which doesn\u2019t get you a goal, but tells you you\u2019re getting close to goals, so hopefully we\u2019ll get them. \u201cWe have created some chances, not as many as we want, and it\u2019s a case of taking the opportunities we\u2019re getting and getting in front in games.\u201d To be fair, the folk at Opta back those words up:  No side in the Premier League so far this season has underperformed goals scored compared to their expected goals total by a greater margin than West Ham (-4.6 \u2013 3 goals and 7.6xG)      3.05pm    J\u00fcrgen Klopp says he sees Trent Alexander-Arnold \u201cdifferently\u201d to England coach Gareth Southgate. I think we all might have guessed that after the Reds right-back spent England\u2019s two games in the international break twiddling his thumbs. A couple of clips from the Liverpool manager\u2019s press conference.       2.58pm    Some Chelsea team news for their trip to Crystal Palace, a team they\u2019ve beaten in each of their last nine Premier League encounters. Chelsea will be without both N\u2019Golo Kante and Edouard Mendy, with both still recuperating from injury concerns. Kante is back in training but not quite ready to feature after hamstring trouble, while Mendy has been shaking off a knee issue. Marc Cucurella and Carney Chukwuemeka will also miss the Palace clash through illness. (PA)     2.51pm    New Chelsea boss Graham Potter has been playing the diplomat as new owners Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali continue to kick the club\u2019s ass into the future. (From PA Sport) Potter will oversee his first Premier League game at the Blues helm in Saturday\u2019s trip to Crystal Palace, some 23 days after his appointment. Chelsea\u2019s new owners Boehly and Eghbali have set a relentless pace in their sweeping Stamford Bridge overhaul, that spans far beyond the coaching ranks. The Blues will continue the hunt for sporting and technical directors to bridge the gap between training ground and boardroom, while a raft of exits has already been seen in the medical ranks.\u201cI think the first thing to say is change is good and it\u2019s bad and it\u2019s challenging; it\u2019s all those things,\u201d said Potter.  \u201cIt\u2019s how you deal with it, it\u2019s how you work with it. So I think it\u2019s well documented what\u2019s happened, in terms of ownership, new coach, different people. \u201cThat\u2019s part of life sometimes, it\u2019s just how we manage it. In terms of the challenge, maybe a bit more than a short-term challenge, it\u2019s how you align the resources that you have, it\u2019s how you align the football idea with everything you\u2019ve got, to be successful.\u201d Chelsea\u2019s new owners unseated 2021 Champions League-winning coach Thomas Tuchel at the end of a 100-day review in their Stamford Bridge tenure. Potter was headhunted as a replacement, valued not just for his upwardly mobile on-field career but also for his strong communication off the field. Boehly and Eghbali have the long term firmly in mind with Potter, and are understood not to consider a top-four league finish this term as crucial to the new boss\u2019 west London future. Potter knows the importance of steering a club of Chelsea\u2019s size to Champions League football, but insisted he will set aside concerns regarding outside perception in a bid to focus on the job in hand. \u201cThe past or resources or history doesn\u2019t guarantee you anything in this league,\u201d said Potter. \u201cYou can see already, there\u2019s lots of clubs that have spent a lot of money and haven\u2019t achieved things that maybe they wanted to. So it\u2019s about getting everything lined up, everyone working together and strategy clear. \u201cWhether things are vital, vital sounds a bit life and death, a bit dramatic to be honest. But I understand the question, it is what it is. \u201cI can\u2019t control people\u2019s perception of what we\u2019re going to do or not, I can\u2019t control what people think about what we\u2019re going to do in May or June. \u201cI can just focus on the next match and the next training session and try to improve the team.\u201d      2.38pm    Manchester United boss Erik Ten Hag isn\u2019t putting too much focus on the threat of Erling Haaland. \u201cWe don\u2019t play against Haaland. We play against Man City,\u201d chirped the Premier League\u2019s new manager of the month. \u201cThey have a team, more than 11 players, but also we are convinced of our capabilities and if we act as a team, in and out of possession, then you can beat such opponents. \u201cThat is the belief we have to take with us when we line up, when we start the game and we do it over more than 90 minutes on Sunday, clear.\u201d     2.32pm    Talking of team news, Pep Guardiola has given an update on summer signing Kalvin Phillips, who is sidelined after undergoing shoulder surgery during the recent international break. Guardiola says the operation went well and believes the midfielder can still claim a place in England\u2019s World Cup squad. The City boss said: \u201cHe feels good. He is getting better. He took the right decision. Hopefully he can be back in time to go to the World Cup.\u201d (PA Sport)     2.28pm    J\u00fcrgen Klopp has given fitness updates on no less than 10 Liverpool players ahead of the home game with Brighton. Are you sitting comfortably? Here\u2019s the latest from the club\u2019s website\u2026 Ibrahima Konate\u2019s availability for the Anfield encounter will be assessed today following his return to training this week for the first time in two months. Luis Diaz, Diogo Jota and Darwin Nunez will also be checked after their involvement in international fixtures, while Caoimhin Kelleher and Calvin Ramsay have returned to sessions but are initially likely to get game time with the Reds\u2019 U21s. Andy Robertson remains sidelined, with the left-back, Curtis Jones, Naby Keita and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain still in rehabilitation phases. \u201cSome are still out doing rehab \u2013 that\u2019s Robbo, that\u2019s Curtis, that\u2019s Ox, that\u2019s Naby, if I\u2019m 100 per cent [right]. Definitely these four,\u201d said Klopp at his pre-match press conference. \u201c[Nunez, Diaz and Jota], they came back from international [duty]. How it always is, long flight. Luis only landed Thursday morning. I didn\u2019t see him yet. I heard he is good but [will] see him now only later. Darwin, yeah, precaution after intense travel and games. Same for Diogo. \u201cCalvin is not ready to play but over the moon that he can train now. That\u2019s fine, it\u2019s really good.  \u201cCaoimh, I think will play this weekend [for the] U21s, that he can have a game. It\u2019s obviously not his season yet, was injured for a long time, but looks good in training, is completely fine. \u201cAnd Ibou needs training as well. Yes, back. For the weekend, [it] depends to training today but he\u2019s back and that\u2019s good.\u201d Asked specifically about Robertson, Klopp said: \u201cHe\u2019s doing really well. It looks really good, so he\u2019s not out for long; already too long out, if you want, but now it was the international break so that helped in this case a little bit. He is already out on the pitch running, good sign. I don\u2019t know if it will be next week or the week after, I don\u2019t know.\u201d (Liverpoolfc.com)     2.17pm    Pete Sibley off the Twitter is in derby mood too. I\u2019ll also include his Gareth one.       2.10pm    Thanks Luke. Let\u2019s stick with the Manchester derby and digest a few Optas.   The away side has won 21 times in Premier League meetings between Manchester City and Manchester United \u2013 no fixture has been won by the visitors more often in the competition\u2019s history.  This will be Erik Ten Hag\u2019s first Manchester derby in charge of Man Utd \u2013 each of the five previous Red Devils managers to take charge of one in the league have lost their first (Moyes, van Gaal, Mourinho, Solskjaer and Rangnick), with Alex Ferguson the last to win in March 1987. Erling Haaland has scored a hat-trick in each of his last two Premier League home games for Man City, doing so against Crystal Palace and Nottingham Forest. No player has scored a hat-trick in three consecutive Premier League home games before, while the last player to score as many as three home hattricks in a single campaign was Sergio Ag\u00fcero in 2018-19. Antony scored on his Premier League debut in Manchester United\u2019s 3-1 win against Arsenal last time out \u2013 the only Brazilian player to score in both of his first two Premier League appearances was Robinho in September 2008.      2.03pm    That\u2019s the lot from me for the moment \u2013 I will leave you in the capable hands of my colleague David Tindall.     1.59pm    Another bit of Manchester derby injury news is that John Stones is ruled out after being injured on England duty: \u201cHe is injured. He will be back when he is ready,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cI don\u2019t know when he will come back but I think maybe 10 days, two weeks.\u201d     1.54pm    A snap report from PA Media on that Manchester United injury news that Harry Maguire is out for this weekend: Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial are both doubts for the Manchester derby \u2013 a clash Manchester United captain Harry Maguire will miss through injury. Erik ten Hag\u2019s side are playing their first Premier League match since beating Arsenal 3-1 at Old Trafford on 4 September. Manchester City are sure to provide a stern test for United, who could be without three first-team players at the Etihad Stadium.  \u201cHarry Maguire is injured and I think for the rest we have some doubts,\u201d Ten Hag said. \u201cWith Anthony Martial, he was training all week with the group so really happy with that situation. He\u2019s performing really well. \u201cRashford returns into training so also we are happy with that. For the rest, only the long-term injuries like Axel Tuanzebe and Brandon Williams are not available.\u201d  Updated at 1.54pm BST    1.45pm    There are a ton of matches to be played between now and the World Cup \u2013 City will play 13 matches in the next 43 days, says a reporter at the press conference. How many training sessions is Guardiola going to schedule, given the heavy playing load over the next several weeks? \u201cFew. Few, few, few,\u201d Guardiola responds. \u201cIt\u2019s recovery, be ready, try to rotate as much as possible the players. Everybody involved, everybody is going to play the next games, some more than others, but everyone is going to play \u2026 [we must] adapt, adjust and recover well.\u201d  Updated at 1.51pm BST    1.44pm    Guardiola says it is \u201cnot weird\u201d that the City physio, Mario Pafundi, joined Erling Haaland in Norway\u2019s international camp in recent days. Guardiola says that the physios are the most important members of the backroom staff, and that Haaland struggled with injuries last season, so keeping him fit is a priority. \u201cWith these events like European Cups or World Cups many physios go with the players \u2026 Mario is an exceptional physio. Always I said to the club, the most important department in the backroom staff \u2026 the most important one is the physios. They take care of the legs. Erling last season struggled a lot in Dortmund \u2026 He started to work with Mario, and thanks to them, and of course his work ethic \u2026 he can play regularly. Last season it was not possible.\u201d  Updated at 2.01pm BST    1.42pm    What does Pep Guardiola expect from Erik Ten Hag and Manchester United on Sunday? \u201cAlways I expect the best \u2026 the quality they have, there is no doubt about it. \u201cThey come with very good results, they are a top side \u2026 yeah, good momentum for them.\u201d     1.39pm   Injured Maguire missing for Manchester United  Erik Ten Hag has said the England defender Harry Maguire will miss Sunday\u2019s Manchester derby through injury. More to follow on that.  Updated at 1.40pm BST    1.38pm    Guardiola was meant to speak at 1.30pm, but like any natural showman, he\u2019s keeping the crowd waiting.     1.34pm    Bruno Lage, the Wolves manager, says Diego Costa has lifted the whole playing group in training after his arrival. Wolves travel to West Ham tomorrow evening. \u201cIt was good to have these weeks for training \u2026 Diego has lifted the energy, all the team when we are training, now they have a striker in the team, we can see the good vibes and good energy comes \u2026 He give a lot of energy, we are a different team when we have a striker in front of us \u2026 other players can give more when they have a striker in front of them. \u201cThe belief, energy and good vibes comes from the training we had in these two weeks.\u201d Costa will be in the squad, but will he start? \u201cLet\u2019s see \u2026 he had a long time without playing \u2026 sometimes you need to protect him a little bit. But he\u2019s training very well.\u201d  Updated at 1.35pm BST    1.29pm    Erik Ten Hag, of Manchester United, has been named the Premier League manager of the month for September, it has emerged:   Updated at 1.30pm BST    1.23pm    Patrick Vieira has been having a chat about Palace\u2019s Premier League match against Chelsea tomorrow: \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to the game. We will be ready for that, and we\u2019ve worked well over the last couple of weeks.\u201d Hopefully, there will be some more interesting lines from that press conference coming along shortly.   Updated at 1.25pm BST    1.17pm    Guardiola, Ten Hag, Klopp and Howe are all due to speak soon, too.     1.16pm    Mikel Arteta is asked about the atmosphere of a north London derby: \u201cIt\u2019s all about emotion ... and enjoyment. \u201cIt\u2019s the nicest game of the season by a mile for what it means to our supporters, for the history of it \u2026 and looking at the table where we both want to be, it becomes really important match. I think the word is excitement. \u201cThey know what to expect,\u201d he adds of the players and their ability to deal with the atmosphere. Are Partey, Zinchenko and Tierney in the matchday squad, Arteta is asked. \u201cThey are part of the team,\u201d he says, smiling. That match will kick off at 12.30pm tomorrow. Exciting times.  Updated at 1.19pm BST    1.12pm    The former Real Madrid defender, Rapha\u00ebl Varane, seems to have come into his own at Manchester United. Analysis here from Josh Wright:      1.09pm    Chelsea are preparing to move for Christopher Nkunku next summer after it emerged they conducted an initial medical check on the RB Leipzig forward during the last transfer window.      1.04pm    Does the Southampton manager Ralph Hassenh\u00fcttl feel under pressure after an indifferent start to the season? \u201cI say no. I\u2019m not under pressure, not more than any other day that I work with my team \u2026 the biggest pressure is the pressure I put on myself \u2026 to deliver the best possible work \u2026 and it\u2019s enough. \u201cIf you want to make a good job, the pressure should come from yourself.\u201d He prefaced that answer with something about not wanting to give \u201cquotes for betting companies \u2026\u201d Southampton host Everton at 3pm tomorrow. Saints are 14th, Everton 13th.  Updated at 1.06pm BST    1.02pm    Everton have been fined \u00a3300,000 by the Football Association for their supporters\u2019 behaviour during last season\u2019s Premier League win over Crystal Palace at Goodison Park when there were two pitch invasions.  Everton fans invaded the pitch following Dominic Calvert-Lewin\u2019s 85th-minute winner and at the final whistle in their 3-2 victory over Palace, which secured their top-flight survival.  \u201cEverton FC admitted failing to ensure that its spectators - and all persons purporting to be its supporters or followers - conducted themselves in an orderly fashion and refrained from using threatening and violent behaviour whilst encroaching onto the pitch area,\u201d the FA said in a statement on Friday.  Palace manager Patrick Vieira was confronted by a fan when he was walking towards the away dressing room after the final whistle. The fan appeared to provoke Vieira with hand gestures, after which Vieira kicked him to the ground and was led away by other supporters.  Both parties declined to make a formal complaint and Merseyside Police declined to file charges after an investigation. Vieira was not charged by the FA for the incident. In July, the FA, Premier League and Football League announced stricter sanctions for pitch invasions and the use of smoke bombs and pyrotechnics after an increasing number of pitch invasions at the end of last season. (Reuters)     12.45pm    The Bayern Munich head coach Julian Nagelsmann said he is not solely to blame for the German champions\u2019 poor start to the Bundesliga campaign. Bayern have won the last 10 German crowns but have struggled this season, sitting five points off the lead in fifth. Their 1-0 defeat by Augsburg earlier this month was the first time in 87 matches they had failed to score in a league game and it marked the first time in 20 years they had gone four league games without a win. \u201cSaying that the last two weeks didn\u2019t bother me at all would be a lie,\u201d Nagelsmann said on Thursday. \u201cI know that all of us need to feel this personal responsibility, I do as well for the situation we are in. The last two weeks, my name has been mentioned quite a lot, and not many other names (have been mentioned). I know that I\u2019m not responsible for everything. But I also know that I don\u2019t back out of my responsibility, I do not.\u201d Nagelsmann said Bayern\u2019s winless run had not given him cause to think about stepping down, adding that he wanted to win the league again and go further in the Champions League that they did last season. \u201cIf we don\u2019t win a game, I think about how we can win again.\u201d Bayern host Bayer Leverkusen in the league later on Friday. (Reuters)   Updated at 12.45pm BST    12.39pm    Patrick Vieira, the Crystal Palace manager, is speaking to the media shortly before tomorrow\u2019s match against Chelsea. Quotes to follow.      12.25pm    \u201cIt matters more when there\u2019s money on it,\u201d the bookmaker Sky Bet\u2019s marketing slogan used to say. It certainly mattered to our family, when my husband Luke took his life after struggling with a devastating gambling addiction. He\u2019d started out betting on football every weekend with his friends, doing exactly what the ads portrayed as harmless fun. Yet it\u2019s anything but harmless. More than a million people are addicted to gambling in the UK, and every single day at least one of them takes their life. Behind every person who dies or has their life destroyed is a network of family and friends destroyed along with them.      12.20pm    Tottenham will face an \u201cimproved\u201d Arsenal this weekend, according to Antonio Conte. \u201cI think if I see what happened at Arsenal, they\u2019re a club who backed Arteta over the years,\u201d Conte said. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing when you trust a person, and Arsenal showed this also in a tough period with Arteta [by] backing him in every moment, now they\u2019re having good results. Last season, don\u2019t forget they were in the Champions League [places] in the last three games.  \u201cThey had a good step. I think this season they\u2019re better than last season. They made good signings, especially Jesus and Zinchenko from a club like Manchester City, two players that are used to winning and having a winning mentality. It\u2019s important because I can see they\u2019ve improved the level. Not only the quality but the mentality at Arsenal.   \u201cI think they\u2019re doing a good job. In my opinion it\u2019s always very, very important to go together, with the coach and the club. If you want to build something important you have to go together, to have a good relationship.  \u201cI think the manager in every decision he is going to take has to have a good explanation to the club, \u2018why I want this and not that player.\u2019 It\u2019s right for the manager to show the vision that you have and then the club have to agree with the manager. To have a great connection, a great link between the manager and the club, for sure you have a future much better than the present.\u201d (PA Media)     12.09pm    The German second division club Nuremberg will not be playing evening matches any time soon after the city council on Friday decided to limit the use of floodlights at the team\u2019s Max Morlock stadium amid the energy crisis. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has sent energy prices soaring worldwide and Germany, which had been heavily dependent on Russian energy, is looking to reduce its energy usage with winter approaching. \u201cGas and electricity could be in short supply in the winter. That is why the city council had a renewed discussion about where we can save energy,\u201d it said in a statement, adding that it had made the decision to limit the use of the floodlights and under-pitch heating. \u201cThe pitch heating in the stadium will remain off after an agreement with the German Football League (DFL),\u201d the council said. \u201cWe are limiting the use of floodlights until maximum nine in the evening.\u201d This will prevent the former Bundesliga club from staging any evening games, which start half an hour earlier. Nuremberg are 13th in Germany\u2019s second division. (Reuters)   Updated at 12.10pm BST    11.56am    Our snap report on the news that Hull City, 20th in the Championship, have fired head coach Shota Arveladze:      11.54am    Newcastle United have agreed to sign the Australia international forward Garang Kuol from Central Coast Mariners, a deal that will be completed in January. Here is Joey Lynch with more:      11.48am    Hull\u2019s previous match was the 3-0 defeat by Swansea 13 days ago, which does make you wonder about the timing of the announcement, given they go back into action tonight at Luton. It will be a strange day for the players and staff who remain.     11.40am    The first part of the statement from Hull: \u201cHull City can confirm we have parted company with head coach Shota Arveladze. \u201cArveladze was appointed in January and helped guide the Tigers to Championship safety and a 19th-placed finish in a season of transition at the MKM Stadium. We can also confirm that assistant head coach, Peter van der Veen, will leave the club with immediate effect. Andy Dawson will assume the role of interim head coach until a permanent appointment is made. \u201cAcun Il\u0131cal\u0131, Hull City chairman, said: \u201cDuring the international break, we had a number of meetings with Shota to discuss the direction of the team and the future of the club. As these meetings went on, it became clear our views weren\u2019t aligned so we have made the decision to part ways. \u201cShota and Peter leave with our thanks, greatest respect and fond wishes for the future.\u201d  Updated at 11.42am BST    11.37am   Hull axe Arveladze  Breaking news: Hull City, who will play Luton tonight in the Championship, have sacked their head coach Shota Arveladze.  Thanks to my colleague John Brewin for the heads up.   Updated at 11.56am BST    11.31am    The Newcastle head coach, Eddie Howe, is not yet ready to step into Gareth Southgate\u2019s shoes should he lose his job as England manager. Southgate is without a win in six competitive games after a disappointing Nations League campaign which saw his side condemned to relegation.  Howe was swiftly installed as the bookmakers\u2019 favourite to replace the England boss should this winter\u2019s World Cup go badly for him and is currently vying with new Chelsea head coach Graham Potter at the top of the odds list.  However, asked about the speculation at his pre-match press conference on Friday, the 44-year-old said: \u201cGareth has done an incredible job, and I mean that from the bottom of my heart. I have been lucky enough to go in and see him work and I have a lot of time for him and Steve Holland. They have been amazing for England. You have to remember where England were before he took over and what he has done for the country.  \u201cI never say never, never say no it won\u2019t be something I am interested in. But in the short term, it is not on my radar at all. It is all Newcastle and trying to make this team better. I have always said I love the day to day coaching, love being with the players on the training ground, international football you get that taken away for long periods. At this moment in my life, that is not something I want to do.\u201d (PA Media)      11.22am    \u201cNorth London derbies are always a stressful affair as no other game hurts more than when losing this one,\u201d comments zTom. \u201cBoth teams are relatively similar in strength these days too. Even if I\u2019m really enjoying the step up in level we\u2019re seeing this season for the Gunners, this Spurs team excels at exactly the strategy we struggle to handle the most: soaking up pressure when we dominate play for extended periods then hit back with a lightning-fast counterattack.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019ll be interesting to see how Conte sets up for Spurs,\u201d says Hardinho10. \u201cI think we know how Arteta will approach the game, with the same system that\u2019s got them to where they currently are, but I suspect Spurs might go to a three in midfield, especially given rumours of Kulusevski being injured, bringing Bissouma in to support H\u00f8jbjerg and Bentancur with Son and Kane as a front two.\u201d     11.16am    Watford\u2019s new manager Slaven Bilic has been having a natter with the media and saying all the right things. The 10th-placed Hornets travel to Stoke for a 12pm kick-off in the Championship on Sunday. \u201cI am very optimistic and positive \u2026 I put my name on a \u2018world map of coaches\u2019 [after taking a break from coaching] and Watford was there. \u201cStability, of course [is the aim] ... Life is great, but big decisions, they\u2019ve got to be clear ... this club has very clear ambitions and directions and aims and that is to go back to the Premier League ... Of course, I would love it if if this was the first day of the pre-season. But it isn\u2019t. So what? You can\u2019t get everything.\u201d I also caught another snippet of his press conference, when Bilic said: \u201cThey are not hiring managers to sack them. They want success. They [the owners] don\u2019t want to sack me ... they want me to do good.\u201d Which is reassuring.  Updated at 12.26pm BST    11.11am    There\u2019s going to be a lunchtime rush of gold-standard press conference quotes: Arteta, Ten Hag, Guardiola and Klopp will all be having their much-loved chats with the football media between 1pm and 2pm.     11.03am    In last night\u2019s WSL action, Hanna Bennison\u2019s stoppage-time free-kick grabbed a dramatic 1-0 win for Everton against Leicester \u2026 and here\u2019s the report:      10.59am    The Everton manager Frank Lampard said some of the criticism directed towards England head coach Gareth Southgate has been harsh and called on fans to throw their support behind the team in the build-up to the World Cup. England were relegated from the Nations League top tier this month after a six-match winless run, with Southgate criticised for their performances. \u201cI think it\u2019s in some parts harsh. And when I say some parts, it\u2019s something that we all sign up to in our own ways, and the England job is right up there for the pressure,\u201d Lampard said before Everton\u2019s league trip to Southampton.  \u201cI\u2019m not going to sit here and say that people can\u2019t criticise. I think if things are constructive and people have opinions, great. But once this World Cup comes in and, in the build-up to it, it\u2019ll be great if everyone can really get behind the team and Gareth.\u201d Much of the criticism directed towards Southgate has focused on his \u201ccautious\u201d approach. \u201cI remember the fantastic French team that won the last World Cup without really playing beautiful football,\u201d said Lampard. \u201c[In] modern-day football, there are lots of different styles and little ways to win a game. I think it would be absolutely Gareth\u2019s decision about how to approach an Iran or USA compared to how they approach another type of team further into the competition if we get there.\u201d (Reuters)  Updated at 11.04am BST    10.51am    \u201cI would like to just say a word on the retirement of Mikel John Obi, a Chelsea stalwart for so many years,\u201d comments Quicknstraight. \u201cOne of my favourite Chelsea players and outrageously underrated, even by many Chelsea fans. His performance in Munich, when he was the easily best Chelsea player on the pitch over 120 minutes, and arguably the best player on the pitch on either side, was outstanding. His breaking up of Munich possession and calm retention of possession were key to us being in a position where Drogba\u2019s header was enough to get to extra time and penalties. \u201cHe was an absolute rock in a deeper CM role, when Mourinho switched him further back. Incredibly strong, very hard to knock off the ball, and invariably found a teammate with his sensible passing.\u201d      10.45am    Can France defend their World Cup title in Qatar? It isn\u2019t looking very likely, writes Rapha\u00ebl Jucobin:      10.38am    A comment from BTL, as we early adopters of the internet like to call it: \u201cThree cracking Premier League derbies,\u201d says trinder18. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to call any of them with any confidence. City have won only two of the last eight home derbies, though the most recent was a 4-1 rinsing. I\u2019m going for two draws and an Arsenal win.\u201d     10.34am    Next up \u2013 here is Louise Taylor with some analysis of Newcastle: indifferent results to start the season, but no pressure on Eddie Howe. \u201cIn previous seasons, Newcastle\u2019s collection of a modest eight points from the campaign\u2019s first seven games would have prompted concern among fans. This time things are very different.\u201d   Updated at 10.35am BST    10.28am    Meanwhile on Merseyside: Farhad Moshiri is in advanced talks with Maciek Kaminski over an Everton deal which would see the US businessman provide funding for the new stadium and take a stake in the club. Will Unwin and Andy Hunter report:       10.23am    As stated, Spurs will meet Arsenal tomorrow. David Hytner reports here on the Italian\u2019s contract situation at Tottenham \u2013 he is being linked with struggling Juventus in Serie A, in view of the fact his current deal expires at the end of the season:   Updated at 10.25am BST    10.08am   Preamble  Football is back. It never went away, of course, but the top-end domestic programme returns this weekend after the first international break of this unique season. The World Cup kicks off in less than seven weeks\u2019 time, before which, eight rounds of the Premier League will be crammed in before the final pre-Qatar round on 5 and 6 November. In the top flight things will kick off in style tomorrow lunchtime, with Arsenal v Tottenham in the north London derby. That\u2019s before Manchester City play Manchester United on Sunday and loads more besides. Team news, press conferences, previews and more coming up. But first \u2013 10 things to look out for in the Premier League this weekend:   "

The three domestic trophies went to three different teams, and one team reached a European final. They\u2019re the ones celebrating tonight. Congratulations Rangers, commiserations Hearts. Thanks for following, and why not catch up with Rob again for another final? Bye.      5.47pm    The veteran Allan McGregor\u2019s getting a tad misty-eyed as he applauds the Rangers fans on the lap of honour. What a stalwart he has been. If it is his swansong, it\u2019s a memorable and appropriate one.     5.40pm    Up come the despondent Hearts players, led by Craig Gordon, to collect their medals, along with their impressive manager, Robbie Neilson. There\u2019s some booing from someone or other for something or other, before James Tavernier leads his mates up, shaking hands with Ally McCoist en route to meet Rangers legend John Greig, cram all his teammates and manager onto the tight podium area and hoist the trophy!      5.35pm    Cheers Rob. As a bit of pyro lights up the Rangers end, as is the modern way, and the Rangers players cavort in front of them. It\u2019s a first Scottish Cup since 2009, which constitutes a proper drought in Old Firm terms. The Hearts ends is emptying out a tad; they were out on their feet by the end, but they\u2019ve progressed impressively this season, and are well placed to establish themselves as Scotland\u2019s third force.     5.29pm   Full time: Rangers 2-0 Hearts  Rangers have won the Scottish Cup for the 34th time! It took a while, but ultimately they were too good - and too fit - for Hearts. The match was settled by two fine goals from the substitutes Ryan Jack and Scott Wright at the start of extra-time. Hearts gave everything, and will wonder what might have happened had Ellis Simms scored instead of hitting the post early on, but by the end they were well beaten. The fact their best players were Craig Gordon and John Souttar tells a story. Those two were heroic. I have to dash off to cover the Champions League final, but Tom Davies will bring you reaction from Hampden. Thanks, bye!  Updated at 5.31pm BST    5.28pm    120 min Kent and Kamara are both denied by Craig Gordon, the (relatively) young Hearts keeper. He\u2019s had a terrific game.     5.27pm    119 min: Rangers substitution A lovely bit of sentimentality from Giovanni van Bronckhorst: he brings on the goalkeeper Allan McGregor, aged 40, to play in a Scottish Cup final for the first time. All the Rangers substitutes are on their feet to applaud McGregor.  Updated at 5.28pm BST    5.23pm    117 min Simms\u2019 volley from the edge of the area deflects wide. The corner is cleared without fuss.     5.21pm    113 min This is a long 15 minutes of the soul for the Hearts players, who have no choice but to drag their weary legs around the pitch despite it being an exercise in futility.      5.18pm    111 min Wright charges infield and then plays the ball back outside to Sakala, whose low shot is smartly saved by Gordon. He probably should have scored. Wright has been such a threat since coming on in the second half of normal time.     5.17pm    110 min Rangers are passing the ball round, savouring that magical little window when you know something great is about to happen but it hasn\u2019t been confirmed.     5.14pm    106 min Craig Halkett is booked for fouling Sakala. Hearts look finished. They\u2019ve given everything, and were excellent in the first half, but at some point in the second half it started to become too much.     5.12pm    106 min The second period of extra-time is under way. Fashion Sakala has replaced Joe Aribo for Rangers, and Aaron McEneff is on for Cammy Devlin in the Hearts midfield.     5.11pm   Half time in extra time: Rangers 2-0 Hearts  Rangers are on course for victory after two fine goals from Ryan Jack and Scott Wright. I suppose it\u2019s apt, with all the fatigue and injuries, that the game should be decided by a couple of substitutes.     5.09pm    104 min I\u2019ll have what Calvin Bassey\u2019s having. He\u2019s played four hours of football since Wednesday evening and he is still charging up and down the left like it\u2019s the first day of the season. Likewise Ryan Kent, who zips infield and shoots over from 25 yards.      5.06pm    103 min \u201cMatt Dony has some nerve talking about penalties in Scotland v Wales World Cup play-offs,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cThe most blatant handball you\u2019ll ever see by Dave Jones at Anfield in 1977, and yet Wales fans are still banging on about it 45 years later\u2026\u201d      5.05pm    101 min Hearts know it\u2019s over, still they cling, they don\u2019t know where else they can go.     5.02pm    The substitute Scott Wright has made it 2-0 after a ruthless counter-attack from Rangers. It was three v two, with Kent on the ball. He played it outside to Wright, who took a touch and drove the ball unerringly into the far corner. Gordon had no chance. His first touch wasn\u2019t the best, actually; but the second was immaculate. Wright, who had a disappointing night in Seville, has played really well since coming on.  Updated at 5.03pm BST    5.00pm   GOAL! Rangers 2-0 Hearts (Wright 97)  Rangers are heading for their first Scottish Cup in 13 years!   Updated at 5.08pm BST    4.59pm    95 min There\u2019s no doubt Rangers deserve to be ahead. The first half was even but since then it has been pretty one-sided.     4.59pm    94 min \u201cMORE extra time for Rangers?\u201d sniffs John Cropp. \u201cI can hear my dad now: \u2018GIE\u2019S a BREAK Rangers!!!\u2019 Here\u2019s to three for the Gers in the next five minutes so we can FINALLY get the celebration under way!\u201d Will one do?     4.59pm    Tavernier\u2019s corner from the left was headed away to the edge of the D, where Jack controlled the ball deftly and thrashed a rising drive past Gordon. It hit the underside of the bar and flew into the net. I think Gordon was unsighted, because it went straight above his head. He appealed for handball after the goal, though there didn\u2019t seem to be any hint of that on the replay.  Updated at 5.11pm BST    4.57pm   GOAL! Rangers 1-0 Hearts (Jack 93)  Ryan Jack has smashed Rangers into the lead!   Updated at 5.02pm BST    4.56pm    92 min: Chance for Rangers Another outstanding cross from Bassey is headed over by the stretching Aribo, six yards out. That\u2019s another terrific chance - not quite as good as Diallo\u2019s in the first half, but still eminently takeable.     4.55pm    92 min \u201cBle mae Ramsey?\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cThere a large but petty part of me looking forward to a potential Wales v Scotland World Cup playoff, with Ramsey Panenkaing the winning penalty in a shootout. Football really does turn us into bad people sometimes. If he\u2019s not going to get onto the pitch, then come on Hearts!\u201d     4.54pm    91 min Extra time is under way.     4.50pm   Full time: Rangers 0-0 Hearts  For the second time in four days, Rangers are going to extra time.     4.50pm    90+3 min That was such a brilliant save from Gordon, though Rangers will legitimately argue that they should have had a penalty. It wasn\u2019t a subtle shirt pull from Atkinson, more a partial disrobing.     4.49pm    90+3 min: Wright hits the bar! Tavernier\u2019s free-kick from the right is headed onto the top of the bar by Scott Wright! He did well to get in front of Kingsley and help it across goal, but he couldn\u2019t get the ball to dip under the bar.     4.48pm    90+1 min: What a save from Gordon! That is sensational goalkeeping! Aribo received a pass on the half turn in the area, ignored a blatant shirt pull from Atkinson - that could have been a penalty - and hit a low drive towards the far corner. Gordon, whose weight was slightly the wrong way, thrust out his left leg to divert the ball just past the post.   Updated at 4.49pm BST    4.47pm    90 min Three added minutes. The Hearts players look absolutely shattered.     4.46pm    90 min Rangers break, with Kent playing in the overlapping Bassey on the left side of the area. His cross is cleared at the near post, and I won\u2019t insult your intelligence by telling you which Hearts defender was responsible.     4.45pm    89 min ... and swing it straight into McLaughlin\u2019s hands.      4.45pm    88 min Ginnelly gives the Hearts defence a breather by winning a corner, then conducts the Hearts end before it is taken. Kingsley will swing it in from the right...     4.44pm    87 min Ryan Jack curls over from distance. It was an ambitious attempt.     4.43pm    87 min Hearts are hanging on for extra-time. They look really tired now.     4.42pm    85 min Wright lays the ball back invitingly to Lundstram, whose crisp drive from 25 yards is brilliantly blocked by Souttar. He and Bassey have been magnificent.     4.41pm    84 min: Chance for Rangers! Tavernier swings the resulting corner to the near post, where Balogun gets the run on Souttar and flashes a header just over the bar. It brushed the roof of the net rather than hitting the back of it.     4.40pm    83 min Kent\u2019s cross is headed behind by the leaping Souttar, who has had an extremely good game.      4.38pm    82 min: Hearts substitution Josh Ginnelly replaces Barrie McKay, who faded after a bright start.     4.38pm    81 min: Double substitution for Rangers Glen Kamara and Ryan Jack replace Steven Davis and Scott Arfield in midfield.  Ramsey oh, Ramsey oh, where art thou Ramsey? Oh.     4.36pm    79 min Bassey beats Halliday with a Cruyff turn and is brought down in the eyes of everybody except Willie Collum. Bassey has had a sensational game.     4.33pm    77 min \u201cTo avoid the \u2018heartbreak\u2019 of a penalty \u2018lottery\u2019, maybe if cup finals are still level after 120 minutes the trophy should just be \u2018withheld\u2019, like the Scottish Cup was in 1909,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cThen Gerry Scott would get his wish and both teams really would lose. And we could replace \u2018neither team deserved to lose\u2019 with \u2018neither team deserved to win\u2019.\u201d     4.32pm    76 min: Hearts substitution Andy Halliday replaces Liam Boyce, who has had a good game and must still be feeling the injury he sustained last weekend.     4.32pm    75 min: Good save from Gordon! Bassey takes matters into his own hands and almost gives Rangers the lead. He surges past McKay, cuts inside Souttar on the edge of the area and slides a right-footed shot that is pushed away by Gordon, scrambling low to his left.      4.30pm    74 min Aribo flashes a dangerous ball across the six-yard box. A number of Hearts players were doubtful for this game, or have just come back from injury, and that might be starting to catch up with them. Rangers have been much the better team in the second half.     4.28pm    72 min Wright plays a good one-two with Aribo on the edge of the area, forcing Kingsley to come across and make a vital interception. Excellent defending.  Updated at 4.28pm BST    4.27pm    71 min Boyce and Atkinson have been a big threat down the right in the last 5-10 minutes. Atkinson is fouled by Kent around 45 yards from goal. McKay\u2019s free-kick is a stinker, claimed easily by McLaughlin.     4.25pm    69 min See 56 min.     4.23pm    67 min \u201cWhat is the process for a draw at full time?\u201d says Joe Pearson. \u201cExtra time then penalties? Or is this cup different?\u201d Yep. Yep to the second question, that is. No to the third.      4.23pm    66 min Boyce flicks a clever return pass to Atkinson, who surges into the area from the right and drives a cross that is blocked by Davis.      4.22pm    65 min A rare Hearts attack, at least in the second half. Atkinson has space on the right and curls a lovely cross that just evades the leaping Simms at the near post.     4.20pm    63 min: Rangers substitution Scott Wright replaces Amad Diallo, who did some good things but also missed Rangers\u2019 best chance.     4.19pm    63 min It\u2019s getting hot out there. Kent is unhappy after being penalised for a challenge on Boyce, and the usually undemonstrative van Bronckhorst waves his hands around on the touchline.     4.19pm    63 min \u201cAnyone else think these missed chances will now end in glorious failure for the Hearts?\u201d says Paul Cowan. \u201cToo early?\u201d Way too early, and way too 0-0.     4.18pm    61 min Diallo is late again, this time on McKay, and gets a final warning from Willie Collum. He might have slipped, in his defence, though some referees would have given him a second yellow for that. One way or another, Diallo is going off: Scott Wright is getting ready.     4.16pm    60 min That was an excellent chance for Kent, though the ball over the top wasn\u2019t the easiest to control on the run. The proximity of Gordon and Atkinson meant he had almost no margin for error.     4.15pm    59 min Diallo is booked for a lunge at Boyce.     4.15pm    58 min: Fine save from Gordon! Diallo, just inside his own half, angles a superb pass over the top to find Kent in the area. His first touch is slightly heavy and that allows Gordon to smother his shot.    Updated at 4.40pm BST    4.12pm    56 min We say this in approximately 100 per cent of association football contests, but the first goal feels crucial today.     4.10pm    55 min \u201cAll these Kumbayas are getting to me,\u201d says Gerry Scott. \u201cI hope they both lose.\u201d Now that\u2019s what I call an MBM email.     4.09pm    54 min Diallo\u2019s teasing cross is headed away superbly, if a little desperately, by Souttar. It\u2019s been all Rangers since half-time.      4.09pm    52 min Bassey beats three players on the left, a run that includes a Zidane-style roulette, before his cross is blocked. On Wednesday night he was Rangers\u2019 best defender; today he\u2019s been their best attacker.     4.05pm    48 min Rangers have made a fast start to the second half, winning a couple of corners in the first three minutes. Nothing comes from either, though.     4.03pm    47 min \u201cWhen you said Simms hit the post,\u201d says John Lockhart, \u201cI thought you meant with the ball, not his own body.\u201d The ball hit the post as well, didn\u2019t it? Or is my neurodegeneration gathering pace?     4.02pm    46 min Peep peep! Hearts begin the second half. No changes on either side. \u201cI\u2019m probably not the furthest away from Guardian Towers in ... New Malden,\u201d says Donald Cameron. \u201cA Gers fan so hope they can do it, but it would be great for Hearts and Scottish football if the glory is spread about a bit.\u201d What\u2019s with all this generosity of spirit today? Have you all been asleep since June 2016?     3.57pm    \u201cWatching from Utah,\u201d says Mark Crowder. \u201cBig shoutout to my brother-in-law Phil who made the journey from London to Seville this week and is probably back home in Glasgow for this one.\u201d  While we\u2019re doing shoutouts, both big and small, can I recommend a couple of books: the 50 Greatest Rangers Games by Martyn Ramsay and We Made Them Angry: Scotland at the 1982 World Cup by Tom Brogan.     3.46pm   Half time: Rangers 0-0 Hearts  After one second of added time, Willie Collum blows the whistle for half-time. It\u2019s tight, tense and goalless at Hampden. Both teams have had one excellent chance - Ellis Simms hit the post for Hearts, Amad Diallo headed over from six yards for Rangers.   Updated at 3.47pm BST    3.45pm    44 min How good is Calvin Bassey? That question could be rhetorical or interrogative.    Updated at 3.52pm BST    3.43pm    42 min: What a chance for Amad! Rangers should be ahead. Calvin Bassey, who is having another stormer, curls a beautiful, dipping cross to the far post, where Amad makes a good run inside Cochrane but then heads over from six yards.  Updated at 3.45pm BST    3.42pm    40 min Tavernier, who has committed a few fouls today, gets a last warning from Willie Collum after bringing down Cochrane.   Updated at 3.42pm BST    3.41pm    40 min There was a scare for Hearts a moment ago when Liam Boyce started limping. He seems okay now, though he hasn\u2019t yet had to run at full pelt.     3.40pm    39 min \u201cApropos of nothing, I actually attended an Edinburgh derby at Easter Road back in 2012 on my only trip to Scotland,\u201d says Joe Pearson. \u201cGreat atmosphere!\u201d      3.39pm    38 min: Chance for Aribo! Kent plays a simple pass to the overlapping Bassey on the left. He teases a really good cross towards Aribo, who gets in front of Halkett but can only flick a header across goal on the stretch. On reflection it wasn\u2019t the easiest chance.     3.38pm    36 min \u201cHow is Amad doing?\u201d says Hans Petter Hustveit. \u201cAs a United supporter I had high hopes, and it has been another disappointment from a pretty dire season. It sort of confirmed that the young man showed flashes, but had not the prerequisite physical requirements to flourish in British football.  \u201cHowever, I did read Rangers supporters say he had developed positively as the season has progressed, and that he now seems to have adapted to the level of Scottish topflight - and he\u2019s also very, very young still. Do you feel you can see the beginnings of an end product that Erik ten Hag could develop into real quality?\u201d There\u2019s plenty to like about him, and he plays with a perky mischief, but if I was betting the farm I\u2019d say he won\u2019t make it at United. He\u2019s really young, though, as you say, so we\u2019re in William Goldman territory. At the same age Cristiano Ronaldo was a showpony (sic) and Theo Walcott was a future superstar.     3.35pm    34 min Davis releases Aribo in the inside-left channel, one v one with his future teammate Souttar. He shifts the ball to the side and drives a shot that is well blocked by Souttar. That was good, calm defending.     3.33pm    33 min It\u2019s been an even first 33 minutes. Rangers have had more of the ball but Hearts came closest to scoring when Ellis Simms hit the post.     3.32pm    32 min \u201cGood morning from the colonies Sir Rob!\u201d chirps James Thomas. \u201cI do have a subscription to ESPN+ \u2026 for now, in order to follow Fulham. But, of course, I\u2019ll be changing that to peacock, or whatever NBC\u2019s PL streaming channel is. Getting a bit of Scottish footy here in the States is a rare treat indeed! Carry on sir!\u201d     3.32pm    31 min A snapshot from Simms hits a Rangers defender. Then McKay goes on a dangerous run into the Rangers area before being dispossessed by Diallo.     3.31pm    31 min \u201cHi Rob, watching from Dublin on holiday from Edinburgh,\u201d says Nora Casey. \u201cThank you for your service. \u2018Mon the Hearts!\u201d     3.31pm    30 min Souttar marches forward imperiously and gives the ball to Simms. He carefully tees up McKay, who blooters over from the edge of the D.     3.29pm    29 min \u201cYup, following along from Canada as well,\u201d says Fred Decker. \u201cKeeping one eye on the Sunderland MBM and one on Rangers, the latter in honour of longtime Canadian international Scott Arfield. I know he\u2019s a Scot born and bred, but I don\u2019t make the rules of international football (just as well, really).\u201d     3.28pm    27 min Now Kent shoots a few yards wide from the edge of the area. Rangers are having a decent spell.     3.27pm    26 min The first shot on target comes from Rangers. Diallo teases a low cross into Davis in the area; he lays it back to Arfield, whose first-time shot is straight at Gordon.  Updated at 3.28pm BST    3.25pm    25 min \u201cMonitoring from Sassari in Sardinia,\u201d says Robert B. \u201cI am a Hibs fan but hope that Hearts win.\u201d I\u2019m confident that such generosity of spirit is shared by at least 0.001 per cent of your fellow Hibs supporters.     3.24pm    23 min At the other end, Bassey\u2019s cross is miscontrolled on the bounce by Aribo. With a better first touch he would have had a shot at goal. It wasn\u2019t the easiest ball to take though.  Updated at 3.24pm BST    3.23pm    22 min McKay lobs a dangerous ball towards Boyce on the edge of the area. He doesn\u2019t quite read the bounce, though, and Rangers are able to clear. The Hearts front three of McKay, Boyce and Simms look lively.     3.22pm    20 min \u201cI\u2019ll be following you Rob,\u201d says Paul Byatt. \u201cGot a soft spot for Hearts. Who hasn\u2019t?\u201d Well\u2026     3.20pm    19 min It\u2019s been an enjoyable first 20 minutes. Hearts haven\u2019t bent the knee at all, and as a result it\u2019s a pretty open game.     3.19pm    17 min \u201cLonely?\u201d asks Bartholomew Baker. \u201cYes, I\u2019m monitoring the Scottish Cup on the Guardian from the States. This is the only way to \u2018watch\u2019 since I\u2019m not ready to subscribe to ESPN+.\u201d Call it what you will - narcissism, self-absorption, egomania - but I always feel better when I know somebody is reading.     3.16pm    15 min A long, crossfield pass is controlled magnificently in mid-air by Diallo. He gets away from Cochrane and slides a low cross that is booted away in the six-yard box. Moments later, a loose ball falls to Arfield just inside the area. He thrashes a shot that is brilliantly blocked at full stretch.     3.15pm    13 min We\u2019ve just seen a replay of that Simms chance. He went with his wrong foot, the right, and that might have cost him a goal. There was no need to go with his stronger foot because all he had to do was make contact.     3.12pm    10 min: Simms hits the post! A great chance for Hearts. Atkinson played a clever through pass to Boyce, whose mistimed shot almost turned into a perfect cross for Simms. He slid desperately towards the ball but could only poke it off the outside of the post from close range. That was a really good chance for Boyce, never mind Simms.   Updated at 3.22pm BST    3.10pm    10 min Anyone out there?     3.10pm    9 min Goldson plays an outstanding long pass inside Kingsley to find Tavernier on the right. He lofts a cross towards Aribo but it\u2019s too deep.     3.09pm    8 min Bassey, playing at left-back today, wins the first corner of the match. Diallo\u2019s ball in is cleared by Souttar, who will be joining Rangers in the summer.     3.08pm    6 min This has been a good start from Hearts. McKay, who looks lively, can\u2019t quite control a pass on the edge of the area and that allows Balogun to clear.  Updated at 3.08pm BST    3.06pm    5 min After a confident run from Boyce, Sims\u2019 shot on the turn is blocked by Bassey. That\u2019s the first attempt at goal.     3.04pm    3 min An early yellow card for Peter Haring, who overran the ball and then took a shortcut through Calvin Bassey.      3.02pm    1 min A couple of fouls in the first 53 seconds, one on Lundstram and one by him. Terrific stuff.     3.01pm    1 min Peep peep! Rangers kick off from left to right as we watch.     3.00pm    \u201cNot surprised to see multiple changes made by GVB after Wednesday,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cFatigue could well play a part, emotional as much as physical, especially as the game progresses. But at least Rangers won\u2019t have the second leg of the Europa League final to play in midweek, eh? That would just be crazy.\u201d  Updated at 3.00pm BST    2.59pm    There\u2019s a mighty roar around Hampden as the players walk onto the field. It\u2019s time for the Scottish Cup final of 2022.     2.49pm    A reminder of the teams Rangers (4-3-3) McLaughlin; Tavernier, Goldson, Balogun, Bassey; Arfield, Lundstram, Davis; Diallo, Aribo, Kent.Substitutes: McGregor, King, Jack, Ramsey, Kamara, Sands, Lowry, Itten, Wright, Roofe, Fashion Jr. Hearts (3-4-2-1) Gordon; Souttar, Halkett, Kingsley; Atkinson, Haring, Devlin, Cochrane; McKay, Boyce; Simms.Substitutes: Stewart, Smith, McEneff, Woodburn, Mackay-Smith, Moore, Halliday, Sibbick, Ginnelly.     2.46pm    Pre-match thoughts    Updated at 2.52pm BST    2.36pm    \u201cFavourite Gio van Bronckhorst goal?\u201d asks (and answers) Phil Podolsky. \u201cNever mind long-range screamers. He was at the business end of one of the great Barcelona team goals, a move that epitomizes \u2018probing\u2019, having also launched it with a throw-in.\u201d  I just had a look at the Barcelona team for that game, which included Xavi, Ronaldinho, Deco, Henrik Larsson, Carles Puyol, van Bronckhorst and Samuel Eto\u2019o. Meanwhile, Andres Iniesta and Lionel Messi were on the bench, and Rivaldo, Johan Cruyff and Diego Maradona didn\u2019t even make the squad.  Updated at 2.49pm BST    2.02pm   Team news  Giovanni van Bronckhorst has made five changes from the Europa League final. Jon McLaughlin, Leon Balogun, Steven Davis, Scott Arfield and Amad Diallo replace Allan McGregor, Borna Barisic, Glen Kamara, Ryan Jack and Scott Wright.  Barisic, who came off injured towards the end in Seville, hasn\u2019t made the squad.   Hearts had doubts over a few players but Robbie Neilson is able to pick a very strong XI. There are three changes from last week\u2019s league defeat to Rangers. John Souttar, Nathaniel Atkinson and Craig Halkett return in place of Michael Smith, Gary Mackay-Steven and Toby Sibbick. Crucially, Liam Boyce and Cammy Devlin are fit to start. It\u2019s a bit of a gamble from Robbie Neilson but, as every manager in the world seems to have told us in the last fortnight, this is the time for risk.   Updated at 2.50pm BST    1.56pm    Ewan Murray\u2019s match preview      1.56pm   Preamble  Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Scottish Cup final between Rangers and Hearts at Hampden. Hearts fans don\u2019t much care for remembering 1986, when they lost the league on the final day and turned up for the subsequent cup final in body but not mind. While that lost double is something Hearts fans will never truly get over, the heartbreaking circumstances might give them some added hope today. It\u2019s roughly 63 hours since Rangers lost the Europa League final on penalties to Eintracht Frankfurt on penalties. We\u2019re about to find out what that gruelling match and the despair of defeat have done to both their legs and their minds. If Rangers aren\u2019t close to their best today then Hearts, comfortably the best of the rest in Scotland this season, will make off with the glory.  Hearts have won this competition more recently than Rangers. They smashed Hibs 5-1 in the final in 2012, three years after Rangers beat Falkirk 1-0. Both teams have since experienced football\u2019s vicissitudes. Rangers went into administration and had to start again; Hearts have been relegated twice, most recently in controversial circumstances in 2020. The recovery of both clubs has been pretty admirable. While Rangers were romping the Premiership last season, Hearts were doing likewise in the Championship, though they were also humiliated by Brora Rangers in the Scottish Cup. They finished third in this season\u2019s Premiership, 13 points ahead of Dundee United in fourth, and now their young manager Robbie Neilson is hoping to join a small group who have won the Scottish Cup with the same club as player and manager. One thing Neilson\u2019s Hearts are yet to do is properly lay a glove on Rangers. In four league games this season they took only one point, and were beaten 3-1 by Rangers Reserves at Tynecastle last weekend. Today would be the perfect time to start punching upwards.  Kick off 3pm.  "

                    "body": "Where will Gareth Bale end up next? There will be a long list of names linked to the Wales winger, who is keen to find a new club to ensure he is fit for the World Cup in Qatar. Tottenham, Newcastle and Aston Villa are keeping an eye on the former Real Madrid man. James Tarkowski\u2019s free transfer to Everton is all done and dusted but he will not be seen holding a club scarf aloft until the end of the month, to give everyone something to look forward to \u2013 except Burnley fans.  Manchester United are getting closer to starting their summer transfer business in earnest. They are favourites to bag Porto\u2019s Vitinha, helped by the fact the small print of his contract says he can exit stage right for \u20ac40m (\u00a334m). Supposedly, Arsenal are also keen on the Portugal international. Manchester City\u2019s need to replace Fernandinho in midfield will mean they spend the summer trying to sign Kalvin Phillips from Leeds. The England international is trying to speed things along by telling his employers that he wants out, in order to push through a move that could cost the Premier League champions around \u00a350m. A swap deal could be on between Juventus and Chelsea. The Italian club are happy to offer up the centre-back Merih Demiral plus some cash, in the hope they can persuade the Blues to send Jorginho in the other direction. Marco Asensio is not too happy with Real Madrid over contract negotiations because he wants a pay rise as he heads into the final year of his deal. The stalling could allow Arsenal to swoop with a big offer to bring him to the Premier League. Or he could be using the Gunners to get what he wants in the Spanish capital. A more plausible Arsenal transfer is the arrival of Aaron Hickey from Bologna. The 20-year-old would cost \u00a321m and a move would see the left-back compete with compatriot Kieran Tierney for a starting berth in defence. Mr Free-Kicks himself, James Ward-Prowse, is wanted by David Moyes to replace Mark Noble as the heartbeat of the West Ham midfield. Newcastle could also lodge a bid for the Southampton man.  One of Manchester City\u2019s many youngsters, Gavin Bazunu, is on his way to Southampton in a \u00a312m move, with a few add-ons chucked in for good measure. The goalkeeper spent last season with Portsmouth (don\u2019t tell Saints fans) in League One. Another goalkeeper on the move is Sam Johnstone, who is off to Crystal Palace on a free transfer following the expiration of his West Brom deal."

Two first-half saves from Jacob Ramsey and Danny Ings took the breath away. Those were far from his only interventions and they meant Graham Potter, whose side put in the worst performance of his tenure to date, could hail a fifth successive win even if Chelsea hardly deserved it.  They prevailed because Villa, unable to apply the decisive touch at one end, self-destructed at the other. A glaring mistake from Tyrone Mings gave Mason Mount the opener on a plate; then Mings and Emiliano Martinez could both have done better around the second-half free-kick, albeit superbly executed, from which the same player killed proceedings off. Chelsea\u2019s revival continues apace but the embattled Gerrard, who was jeered by a pocket of supporters as he walked down the tunnel after full\u2011time, saw the prospect of a transformative outcome slip away. \u201cI\u2019m aware of it all but I have to accept it and do everything I can to try and change the way they feel at the moment,\u201d Gerrard said of the disquiet among some fans whose patience is wearing perilously thin. They would have perked up considerably had an enterprising Villa, much the better side until they went two behind, converted their superiority into points. Instead they face crucial games against Fulham and Brentford over the next week knowing there is little room for error; Gerrard surely needs a result against at least one of them if the unrest is not to reach a crescendo. \u201cI said to the players: \u2018I know you\u2019ll be frustrated and disappointed but, if you can replicate that [performance] at Fulham, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll have any problems,\u2019\u201d he said.  Arrizabalaga\u2019s reflexes were a driving force behind those emotions. The best of his work came during a dizzying 20-minute spell midway through the opening period when Chelsea should have found their early lead overhauled. His stop from Ramsey was extraordinary: he had just beaten away John McGinn\u2019s drive and Ramsey, taking aim from the rebound, looked poised to crack it past him from 12 yards. Instead he plunged low to his right and somehow deflected the ball on to the post. Just after the half-hour Leon Bailey checked back and crossed from the right for Ings, four yards out, to power a header that Arrizabalaga tipped over despite minimal time to respond. It was an equally good save and there were others in that blizzard of pressure, McGinn and Ings seeing angled drives repelled. When Villa contrived an effort Arrizabalaga could not reach, Bailey headed on to the top of the crossbar. \u201cKepa has found a fantastic level today,\u201d said Potter, who was careful to cushion his praise in a general appreciation of the camaraderie among Chelsea\u2019s keepers. \u201cHe\u2019s made brilliant saves that have kept us in the game and allowed us to win the points, so I\u2019m really pleased for him.\u201d Chelsea scored with their first attack when Mings, misjudging the flight of the ball after Ramsey\u2019s attempt to dispossess Ben Chilwell looped up into the air, horribly skewed a header straight into Mount\u2019s path. The finish was confident but otherwise Chelsea looked lost. Marc Cucurella had a horror show of a first half at left centre\u2011back before being replaced, Potter deploying Kalidou Koulibaly and C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta at the interval to shore things up. Raheem Sterling\u2019s selection at right wing-back in Reece James\u2019s absence was an experiment curtailed during Villa\u2019s purple patch; he was belatedly moved forward and, from a rare attack, curled a shot on to the bar. \u201cVilla made us suffer,\u201d Potter said. But a fourth consecutive clean sheet was still the outcome and Mount\u2019s set piece garnished it. Mings was again partly responsible, with a clumsy foul on him 25 yards out. The free-kick was well struck but Martinez paid the price for making a sidestep to his right, the ball wobbling leftward and arcing under his bar. Villa had been punctured and the final quarter was a non-event. \u201cI\u2019m still in a little bit of disbelief that we haven\u2019t scored at least a couple of goals,\u201d Gerrard said. That tends to be a common refrain when a team are struggling. Villa remain 16th even if Gerrard felt a rejigged attack, which brought recalls for Ings and Bailey, answered the call for greater excitement and creativity. In Chelsea\u2019s case some of the latter is diminished when James is not around. Potter revealed that the right\u2011back, who sustained a knee injury in the win at Milan, will spend the next four weeks in a brace. That would appear to make his presence for England at the World Cup finals in Qatar decidedly unlikely. For now Chelsea are simply relieved that Arrizabalaga pulled off the impossible here."

                    "body": "As Mark Noble considers the enormous task he will face in his new role as West Ham\u2019s sporting director, he shares his belief that, \u201cin the next 10 to 15 years probably half of the Premier League\u2019s teams will be owned by countries\u201d. Noble played more than 500 games for West Ham, from 2004 to May this year, and the consistency and loyalty of that commitment stand in sharp contrast with the outlandish riches which will transform the Premier League much further.\n\u201cPeople love football, globally,\u201d Noble says as he prepares to begin his challenging position in January. \u201cOther sports are fantastic but they don\u2019t [generate] that affection, yes obsession, we have with football. I\u2019m talking about countries that people don\u2019t even know exist which love football.\u201d\nThe 35-year-old might not sound worldly in that last sentence but the way in which Manchester City and Newcastle United have already been taken over by consortiums led by members of the royal families in Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia has set a clear precedent. Manchester United and Liverpool may be sold next year and different nations could enter the bidding.\n\nDavid Sullivan and David Gold, West Ham\u2019s owners since January 2010, enjoy their reputation as local wheelers-and-dealers, but how does the prospect of half the Premier League being owned by countries make Noble feel? \u201cWell, it depends,\u201d he says, as he starts to laugh. \u201cIt depends if we are [owned by a nation]. The great thing about the Premier League is, because there is a lot of financial power, the games ain\u2019t as easy as they would be in other leagues. But if you want the best players it\u2019s different.\n\u201cI saw an interview with Erling Haaland\u2019s agent [Rafaela Pimenta] the other day and she was saying: \u2018Well, why ain\u2019t Haaland worth a billion because of his image rights, contracts and everything else that goes with him? You laugh but then you think about it and, when you actually break it down, future global superstars probably will be worth [a billion pounds].\u201d\n\nHow will Noble react when part of his remit as sporting director will be to help West Ham cope with the astronomical wealth accumulated by rivals such as Manchester City? \u201cYou\u2019ve got the top six, maybe even seven in the Premier League. You\u2019ve got two or three in the German league and the same in the Spanish league. In the French league, obviously you\u2019ve got PSG [owned by Qatar] and one or two others. So we\u2019re not in that market because the Champions League is a massive draw for players.\n\u201cWe need to be in the market of probably 25 teams across Europe. Maybe from fourth to eighth in the Spanish league, the same in the German league. Those are our rivals when we are recruiting players because we can\u2019t afford to buy who we want. It\u2019s not going to happen. So we\u2019ve got to be clever and find ways of recruiting young players and developing them, bringing them from the academy to the first team because that\u2019s a massive plus. We\u2019ve seen that with Declan Rice [who succeeded Noble as club captain], Ben Johnson [the West Ham defender], myself and others. A good young English player is worth 40 million quid. It\u2019s incredible. So if we can produce three or four of them, we\u2019re doing something right.\u201d\nIt is debatable whether West Ham can hold on to Rice much longer \u2013 especially when, at the World Cup, the England midfielder said how much he wants to play Champions League football and that \u201cyou only get one career\u201d. Noble sounds pragmatic when discussing a player he has mentored for years and as the Premier League resumes on Boxing Day with West Ham, two places above the relegation zone, away to the leaders Arsenal.\n\u201cWhether you think things will get dicey at West Ham \u2013 and I don\u2019t believe they will \u2013 we just can\u2019t cope financially with the top teams. We can try our hardest to recruit the best players that the top five or six don\u2019t buy \u2013 and we might get lucky with a few that slip through the net \u2013 but you can\u2019t compete with these teams. They\u2019re financially too powerful. If a top club wants Declan Rice they\u2019re just going to pay for him, full stop. You\u2019ve seen it with Jack Grealish, with the best players. If the top boys want them, we ain\u2019t got a chance.\u201d\nThere is more romance in Noble\u2019s personal story as Mr West Ham and, as his new book captures, he thrived as a one-club player whose career is unlikely to be emulated in such a volatile and money-driven future for Premier League football. There are parallels with Steven Gerrard at Liverpool but Noble lived so close to West Ham, whose academy he joined at 13, that he could walk home after he made his first-team debut at Upton Park four years later. He was with his girlfriend, Carly, who is now his wife.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t prepared for two middle-aged men to spot me in the street,\u201d Noble recalls in his book. \u201c\u2018Well done, Marky boy,\u2019 one shouted. \u2018Oh my God, Mark,\u2019 Carly said as we walked on. \u2018He knew who you were.\u2019\u201d\nThat affection for Noble, who had been waiting outside the Boleyn ground to ask West Ham players for their autographs six months earlier, grew into a profound love affair between the supporters and their eventual captain. It helped that he grew up in nearby Beckton but Noble also showed a dedication to help West Ham in any way he could. However, he reveals how that close bond came at a cost. Noble put football above everything else and the strain often felt consuming.\nHe and Carly \u201cgot chicken and chips\u201d on their walk home after his debut but it did not take long for him to change. He became single-minded and prioritised football \u2013 at the expense of Carly, his family and friends. \u201cI\u2019m open about that,\u201d he says. \u201cThere were times that everything got on top of me. You\u2019ve got to be the Premier League footballer and West Ham academy graduate \u2013 but also a best mate, a husband, father, a son, a brother. We had our two kids really young and I thought: \u2018I\u2019ve got no choice now. I have to become successful. I have to be able to provide for Carly and the kids.\u2019 But I became incredibly selfish.\u201d\n\nNoble comes across as a lovely man but he suggests that, when he was younger, he acted like \u201ca pig\u201d towards Carly. \u201cI use that word because I was so obsessed with getting better. I was also representing my own people [fellow West Ham fans] and I didn\u2019t want to let anyone down. I concentrated so much on that side there were times I let Carly down. If she was sat here now, she\u2019d tell me to shut up and say that was my job. But when you get older you get less selfish.\u201d\nThe demands were draining and Noble admits there were times where \u201cI had broken relationships with other family members\u201d. It became difficult for him to enjoy even the good times. \u201cYou almost become immune to the good times. They just bring relief because points are so sacred in the Premier League that if you win it\u2019s relief more than joy. Joy is when you\u2019re 17 and you break into the first team and everyone thinks you\u2019re a hero. But I became a senior pro at 21 and you\u2019re expected to win, you\u2019re expected to play well.\u201d\nNoble also felt, at a very young age, that he could never show any weakness. \u201cIt\u2019s so different now, mate. Back then the senior pros didn\u2019t allow it. I agree with the new system but, in a lot of ways I don\u2019t, because football is a ruthless industry where it feels like there is no place for weakness. Everyone\u2019s job\u2019s on the line and if you go into training with a grade two hamstring tear, you know you can\u2019t train. But if you go in and say: \u2018I\u2019m not mentally stable or in the right frame of mind to train today,\u2019 people would say: \u2018What are you fucking on about?\u2019\n\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised how many players are struggling. They\u2019re going through issues but don\u2019t say anything. But it is getting so much better now because some players are talking about [mental health] \u2026 and when I speak to academy players now I say: \u2018Forget what you see in the public eye. Forget the nice cars, the big houses and the nice watches. That\u2019s 2% of what it means to be a footballer.\u2019\u201d\nNoble will be heavily involved in recruitment, development of the academy and the wellbeing of players. \u201cI love the game but I also love the business side of football,\u201d Noble says. \u201cMy relationship with [West Ham\u2019s manager] David Moyes over the past two and a half years is probably one of the reasons that West Ham asked me to do this job.\u201d\n\nYet West Ham\u2019s fans seem disillusioned with the season so far. \u201cProbably a group of fans, yes. But there\u2019s always going to be that at every club now. You hear people saying the fans are not happy with [J\u00fcrgen] Klopp at Liverpool. That\u2019s the industry we work in now and, because of social media, it has become a lot louder.\u201d\nDescribing this season as \u201ca transition\u201d for West Ham, Noble is at his most animated when talking about Lionel Messi. \u201cWhat it must be like to be Messi,\u201d he says with wonder as his words mingle with laughter. \u201cHe\u2019s on another planet. I watched his documentary [before the World Cup] and you look at the experience he had losing three [Copa Am\u00e9rica] finals in a row and losing the World Cup final and then always being compared to [Diego] Maradona. He was fucking distraught and he is the greatest that\u2019s ever walked the earth.\n\u201cI remember when Chelsea played against him and JT [John Terry] came flying across and he was on the touchline ready to try and body him into the stands and Messi stood there, took it and bounced JT. I also remember Manu Lanzini [his former West Ham teammate] coming back from Argentina duty and I was like: \u2018Oh mate, what was Messi like?\u2019 Manu\u2019s a genius with the ball but he said: \u2018I swear to you, when he passed me the ball, I was so nervous because he was on my team.\u2019 Manu said Messi would be floating about in training and then he would think: \u2018Oh, do you know what? I want to win this game.\u2019 And he\u2019d score six goals.\u201d\nThe simple joy of football shines in Noble \u2013 as it will when he embraces the breaks from recruitment and monitoring mental health to step out on the academy pitch with teenage hopefuls to whom he can give a few pointers. All the headaches of being the Boleyn boy trying to keep up with clubs owned by countries will be forgotten for a while. And maybe, I suggest, the academy kids will look up to him as their local version of Messi.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure about that,\u201d Noble says amid his laughter. \u201cBut I love football. I love all parts of football.\u201d\nBoleyn Boy by Mark Noble is published by HarperCollins. To support the Guardian and Observer order your copy at guardianbookshop.com. Delivery charges may apply."

                    "body": "It took just eight days, and a war, for the International Olympic Committee to pull off an audacious mid-air manoeuvre that would not have been out of place on the slopes of the Winter Olympics. For much of February, as Beijing hosted the 2022 Games, the IOC was insistent: there is no place for politics in sport. \u201cWith regards to the Uyghur population, the position of the IOC must be to give political neutrality,\u201d said the president, Thomas Bach, in early February. Yet just a week after the curtain fell on the Winter Olympics, the IOC radically backflipped. \u201cIn order to protect the integrity of global sports competitions and for the safety of all the participants,\u201d the IOC executive board resolved on Monday, Russian and Belarusian athletes should be excluded from international competition. \u201cThe IOC reaffirms the call of the IOC president,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cGive peace a chance.\u201d  All of which begs the question: why are crimes against the Uyghur people and human rights violations in China just fine, but invading Ukraine beyond the pale? After a Winter Olympics replete with resort to neutrality, this blatant hypocrisy provokes a certain feeling of whiplash. Through this inexplicable sporting lens, it seems as if some atrocities are OK, but Russia crossed the line by marching on Kyiv. The IOC has at last done the right thing. Given the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, Russian participation in international sporting competitions would be unthinkable right now. Fifa, too, deserves some credit for excluding Russian teams from international competitions. The human cost is regrettable \u2013 ordinary Russian athletes, many of whom have no links to President Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime and play no part in this current insanity. Yet a sporting ban on Russia is the only reasonable course of action as missiles rain down on Ukrainian civilians. But what took these sporting bodies so long? Russia invaded Georgia in 2008, a year after the IOC had awarded the 2014 Games to Sochi. Curiously, given recent events, the IOC was mute at the time. Six years later, on the day of the Winter Olympics closing ceremony, Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea began. In the following months, Russia invaded eastern Ukraine. Rather than condemning the violence, the Olympic governing body dished out honours to Putin loyalists (which, on Monday, they laughably clawed back). Fifa followed with the men\u2019s World Cup, in 2018, notwithstanding Russia\u2019s continuing occupation of Crimea, its proxy separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk and, just months before the tournament, a botched assassination attempt on English soil. Sportswashing has consequences \u2013 events in Ukraine over the past week have made that abundantly clear. By allowing their crown jewels to be used to burnish Russia\u2019s image, the IOC and Fifa have been complicit in Putin\u2019s wanton acts over the past decade. No doubt it is possible that, even if the 2014 Olympics or 2018 World Cup had been scrapped, we may still be where we are today. But the IOC and Fifa\u2019s inaction hardly helped.  When they should have acted, the governing bodies lacked the conviction to make hard choices. It is easy now for both to speak out; they have had their sporting jamborees \u2013 funded by the Russian taxpayer, enriching Russian oligarchs \u2013 and gone home. It is safe to condemn Putin today, from their Swiss palaces, with nothing on the line. By their latest actions, the IOC and Fifa have shown themselves to be nothing but opportunistic: neutral when it suits their commercial ambitions and political when they feel the need to swing in line with global opinion. With the Qatar 2022 World Cup later this year, the change of heart is unlikely to last. The tournament will go ahead using infrastructure quite likely built on the back of forced labour, in a nation ranked as \u201cnot free\u201d by rights watchdog Freedom House, where the rights of women and LGBTQI+ Qataris are limited. Russia might not be there, but nor will the 6,500 migrant workers who have died in Qatar since the World Cup was awarded. Fifa\u2019s culpability runs deep.  Sport has always been political, dating right back to the first Olympiads of ancient Greece, when city states jostled, occasionally even resorting to violence, for the influence that came with hosting the Games. Insisting otherwise, as the IOC, Fifa and other global sporting bodies have long done, shows wilful disregard for reality. Yet they persisted with the myth, including just a week ago, when the latest Olympic circus ended in Beijing with barely a squeak about human rights. Their Russia ban is welcome, if cynical. But it only underscores their tremendous duplicity, their failure of leadership and the moral vacuum that sees the brutal repression of the Uyghur people, the Tibetans, the Hongkongers as warranting no more than \u201cpolitical neutrality\u201d. History will judge the IOC and Fifa as complicit hypocrites \u2013 no backflip on Russia will stop that."

We\u2019ll have a few more features on the site in the next hour or two.  Thanks for your company and emails. Congratulations to Argentina \u2013 and to Australia, who have excellend themselves at this World Cup. Good day/night.      9.17pm    And here\u2019s Graham Arnold\u2019s verdict  I just hope that everyone back in Australia really respects what we\u2019ve done and are proud of us as well. We took it to them. I felt that we finished off well. We had a great chance at the end there to equalise. I\u2019ve got to be very, very proud of the boys. Just so grateful at the effort they\u2019ve put in for me.  I don\u2019t think he has any worries on that score.     9.14pm    A very emotional Jackson Irvine speaks  We gave it everything. Just like we have every minute of this competition. So proud of all the players and the staff. Yeah, just not enough on the day. I think we did everything we could. We stood up to be compact and disciplined in our shape. We were excellent defensively we gave up very little until obviously the end.  You have to have a go with the last 15 minutes. I think we did everything we could to give ourselves a chance in the game. When Argentina are celebrating like this, victory against Australia, I think it shows what kind of opposition we gave them today. It\u2019s difficult to comprehend everything at the moment. It\u2019s all quite raw. Erm... But yeah, I hope we made everyone proud.   Updated at 9.16pm GMT    9.01pm    Argentina were too good for an admirable but limited Australian side, who nonetheless leave the tournament with honour. In an surprising development, Lionel Messi was the star. He enlivened a dreadful first half with a fine goal and gave Australia the runaround after the break. The love-in might be slightly weird at times \u2013 Messi could stink out a lift and everyone in there would say thank you - but he really was majestic in the second half. Julian Alvarez scored the second goal after a mistake from Mat Ryan, but Australia gave Argentina big scare at the end. Craig Goodwin\u2019s wayward shot deflected in off Enzo Fernandez, Aziz Behich almost equalised after an amazing solo run and finally the teenager Garang Kuol was denied brilliantly by Emi Martinez in the 97th minute.   Updated at 9.21pm GMT    8.57pm   Full time: Argentina 2-1 Australia  Peep peep! Argentina will play the Netherlands in the World Cup quarter-final, just like they did in 1998.   Updated at 9.37pm GMT    8.57pm    90+7 min: What a chance for Australia! A cross from the left falls nicely for Kuol, who rolls Tagliafico and hammers a close-range shot on the turn that is superbly saved by Martinez! Oh my goodness.     8.56pm    90+6 min Argentina are seeing this game out very comfortably. Australia have the \u2018what if\u2019 of Behich\u2019s chance, but overall there\u2019s no doubt that Argentina deserve to win.     8.55pm    90+4 min Palacios and Messi have shots blocked in quick succession. Then Ryan kicks away Martinez\u2019s deflected shot and Messi puts the rebound well wide. He couldn\u2019t sort his feet out quickly enough.      8.53pm    90+3 min: Fine save by Ryan! Messi, who has been terrific in the second half, puts Lautaro Martinez through on goal again, and this time Ryan makes an excellent save low his left. Moments later, Messi cuts inside and whips a curling shot just over the bar.     8.52pm    90+3 min Souttar is up front now, but Australia are struggling to generate any attacking momentum. A set-piece is probably their best chance of an equaliser.     8.50pm    90+1 min There will be seven minutes of added time.     8.50pm    90 min A long throw is headed across the area dangerously by Souttar. Maclaren can only knock it up in the air and Emi Martinez claims. He\u2019s challenged by Souttar in the process, and a few of the Argentina players go looking for a row. It\u2019s all posturing.     8.49pm    89 min: What a chance for Lautaro Martinez! Messi leads a three-on-three break, bides his time and plays a perfect pass to the unmarked Martinez, 12 yards out. He opens his body and skies it.     8.48pm    88 min After a long spell of possession, De Paul stabs a nice pass down the inside-right channel towards Lautaro Martinez. He snatches at what was only a half-chance anyway, dragging a shot on the turn well wide of the far post.     8.47pm    87 min Argentina waste a minute or so by keeping the ball away from Australia. Excellent game-management, as we are contractually obliged to call it.     8.46pm    86 min There should be a fair bit of added time, at least five minutes. Australia need one last chance.     8.44pm    83 min Romero goes down holding his face after a challenge with Kuol. He was caught, though probably not heavily enough to justify rolling around like an eeijt.  Updated at 8.44pm GMT    8.42pm    82 min All of a sudden, Australia fancy this. Argentina were in complete control until Fernandez\u2019s own goal.     8.42pm    81 min: WHAT A RUN FROM BEHICH! That, no exaggeration, was almost one of the great World Cup goals. The left-back Aziz Behich surged infield from the left, slaloming past four players before hitting a close-range shot that was superbly blocked by the stretching Lisandro Martinez. I\u2019m pretty sure that shot was going in as well. The resulting corner is headed away to Hrustic, who curls over from 20 yards.   Updated at 8.44pm GMT    8.40pm    80 min: Double substitution for Argentina Gonzalo Montiel and Exequiel Palacios replace Naheul Molina and Alexis Mac Allister.     8.38pm    78 min Goodwin\u2019s shot was going well wide, so I\u2019m sure it will eventually go down as an own goal by Fernandez.     8.37pm    Australia are back in the game! Behich\u2019s cross was cleared as far as Goodwin, 25 yards out. He smashed an errant shot that took a huge deflecftion off Enzo Fernandez and flew into the far corner.     8.36pm   GOAL! Argentina 2-1 Australia (Fernandez og 77)  Now then!   Updated at 8.40pm GMT    8.35pm    75 min Tagliafico gallops onto a nice pass from Lautaro Martinez and drags a cross shot well wide.      8.35pm    75 min It\u2019s ending with a bit of a whimper, but Australia\u2019s World Cup campaign has been an unmitigated triumph. The performance against a good Denmark team was outstanding, and with a kinder draw (at one stage it looked like they would be facing Poland or Saudi Arabia tonight) they could have made history by reaching the quarter-finals.     8.33pm    74 min \u201cThe point about concentration in the 62nd minute,\u201d begins Julian Menz. \u201cThe same happened to the US. There is still a gulf in class between the top European and South American/even African nations and the likes of the US and Australia. It only takes a second or two to decide a match, and naivety is punished at this level.\u201d     8.32pm    73 min: Triple substitution for Australia Jamie Maclaren, Fran Karcic and Garang Kuol replace Milos Degenek, Mitchell Duke and Mathew Leckie.     8.31pm    72 min: Double substitution for Argentina Lautaro Martinez and Nicolas Tagliafico replace Julian Alvarez, whose substitution is a compliment, and tbhe equally excellent Marcos Acuna. He looks a terrific player.     8.30pm    70 min \u201cOn the subject of Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo,\u201d says Phil Podolsky, \u201cthere\u2019s a brilliant bit from a recent Sid Lowe interview with the Brazilian Ronaldo.  \u201c\u2018I think there is a very, very special group where you have Diego, Messi, Cruyff, Beckenbauer, Pel\u00e9, Van Basten, Ronaldinho. I would include myself. Let the fans say, let them debate it in the bars. But you can\u2019t rank them, can\u2019t compare generations.\u2019\u201cIMHO this is simply the correct way to think about this: there\u2019s a group of great players that can be expanded, though not ad infinitum, but certain names cannot be left out. Anything beyond is a matter of taste.\u201d  Yeah I really like this perspective. Football has changed so much since Maradona\u2019s time \u2013 the pitches, the thuggery of defenders, even the primacy of the World Cup \u2013 that it\u2019s very difficult to compare.      8.30pm    69 min Acuna eases Degenek off the ball and surges into the area, only to be thwarted the miserable shrill of the referee\u2019s whistle. I\u2019m not sure that was a foul.     8.27pm    68 min \u201cNothing worse than goalkeeper error,\u201d says Liisa Sletzinger. \u201cSo, so painful to watch. I\u2019m remembering back to 2006 when the ball slowly dribbled through the England goalie\u2019s legs on a pass from his own defender. If I remember correctly\u2026 that was aeons ago.\u201d It didn\u2019t quite go through his legs, but that aside your memory is spot on.      8.26pm    66 min Acuna shapes a gorgeous, bouncing cross that just evades Alvarez; moments later, Messi shoots high and wide from 25 yards.     8.25pm    65 min A thrilling surge from Messi. He leaves three players behind in the middle of the pitch, wriggles into the area and is eventually challenged by the last man, Souttar I think.     8.23pm    63 min Goodwin\u2019s volleyed cross is well defended by Lisandro Martinez at the near post.     8.22pm    62 min \u201cSo, so sad,\u201d says Michael Hayen. \u201cA silly free kick leading to a goal and then Ryan\u2019s error. Has undone the generally excellent display from the Socceroos.\u201d I suppose it\u2019s a reminder of the level of concentration you need at this level. For 99 per cent of the game, Australia have defended immaculately.     8.21pm    60 min Julian Alvarez wasn\u2019t in the team at the start of the tournament, with many people backing Lisandro Lautaro Martinez to win the Golden Boot. Life moves pretty fast.  Updated at 8.23pm GMT    8.19pm    59 min: Double substitution for Australia Craig Goodwin and Ajdin Hrustic replace Keanu Baccus, who was excellent, and Riley McGree.     8.19pm    Ryan received a backpass from Rowles and was immediately challenged by De Paul. He dribbled past him but was then robbed on the blindside by Alvarez, who pushed the ball away from Ryan and dragged a shot on the turn into the empty net. Superb opportunism from Alvarez, one of the Argentina players who is good at pressing, and now Australia are in all sorts.  Updated at 8.20pm GMT    8.17pm   GOAL! Argentina 2-0 Australia (Alvarez 57)  Julian Alvarez makes it two after a sad error from Mat Ryan!    Updated at 8.23pm GMT    8.17pm    56 min Australia have a bit of a stick-or-twist dilemma. They can\u2019t just watch Argentina pass the ball around, as they have in the first 11 minutes of the second half, but equally they don\u2019t want to go too early and risk being two or three down before the last 10 minutes.     8.16pm    55 min \u201cThat \u2018lack of recovery time\u2019 surely hampers Leo Messi,\u201d says Mark Raven. \u201cLemme guess: you used to crunch budget numbers for Liz and The Kwaz, right?\u201d Are you a moron or a troll? Genuine question.  Updated at 8.16pm GMT    8.13pm    53 min Australia are fighting hard but they can\u2019t lay a glove on Argentina. Saying which, Otamendi\u2019s backpass is a bit short and Emi Martinez only just gets to it before Duke.     8.12pm    52 min \u201cArgentina\u2019s kit is one of the most difficult to mess up - wide sky blue and white vertical stripes on the front and back - but somehow adidas have managed it this year,\u201d says Andy Flintoff. \u201cThe three narrow stripes down the middle of the back look like each shirt has been badly sewn together.\u201d     8.11pm    51 min Yes, Argentina have switched to 3-5-2, as they did (I think) in the second half against Mexico last week.     8.11pm    50 min After a lovely passing move, all the way through Australia\u2019s press, Messi slips as he shoots from the edge of the D. It takes a deflection and rolls through to Ryan.   Updated at 8.12pm GMT    8.09pm    50 min: Argentina substitution Lisandro Martinez replaces Papu Gomez. Hmm, does that mean a switch to 3-5-2?     8.09pm    48 min  \u201cThe speakers in my living room are shaking from the frenetic chanting of what appears to be tens of thousands Argentinians transplanted directly from La Bombonera,\u201d writes Marc. \u201cIt is surreal as I feels like a home game for Argentina. How many Argentina supporters are in this stadium? It must be shaking. Can\u2019t imagine how a BRA v ARG would sound and feel like.\u201d Can you imagine. Unless you count the 1978 brawl, which was a semi-final in nature if not name, they have never met in a semi-final or final of a World Cup.     8.08pm    48 min Emi Martinez faffs around in possession and is very nearly robbed by Mitchell Duke. Martinez\u2019s clearance brushing the stretching Duke\u2019s boot and ran to safety.     8.06pm    47 min \u201cArgentina seem incapable of fast breaking,\u201d says Zafar Sobhan. \u201cEvery time they get the ball they bring it back and slow it down, giving the defence the time to get set. Not only does it make for dull football but they are just making it exponentially harder for themselves to score. This is why they create so few chances. Good thing for them that they are so clinical but it\u2019s no way to live.\u201d On this form I can\u2019t see them winning it, but we\u2019ve said that about a few teams down the years. Italy in 1982 are the obvious example.      8.05pm    46 min Peep peep! Argentina begin the second half.     7.53pm    Half-time reading      7.53pm    \u201cFrom the picture, Messi\u2019s shot doesn\u2019t seem to be in the corner as it goes in,\u201d says Richard Hirst. \u201cShould the keeper have done better?\u201d I wondered about that, but I don\u2019t think so for two reasons \u2013 Messi took the shot early, and Ryan probably saw it late because it went through the legs of Souttar. It was a terrific finish.   Updated at 7.57pm GMT    7.51pm   Half time: Argentina 1-0 Australia  A perfect first half for Australia \u2013 apart from the five-second period in which Lionel Messi upped the tempo to devastating effect. He started and finished a fine move to score his 789th goal, and his first in the knockout stage of a World Cup, in his 1,000th game. That was the only shot on target at either end. Australia defended with calm authority and at times kept the ball pretty comfortably. But sometimes great footballers are just a bit too good.   Updated at 7.53pm GMT    7.46pm    44 min \u201cThis,\u201d says Amanjit Gill, \u201cisn\u2019t good for the old ticker.\u201d     7.45pm    44 min \u201cI\u2019m fairly sure\u201d says Alex Whitney, \u201cthat goal was dedicated to Behich.\u201d Please tell me he did the Valverde in front of him.       7.45pm    43 min Argentina have picked up where they left off before the goal: slow-slow-slower. They should be going in for the kill here.     7.43pm    42 min Overall that was Messi\u2019s ninth World Cup goal, which puts him one away from Gabriel Batistuta\u2019s Argentina record.     7.42pm    41 min \u201cMe and my mates are rooting for Australia,\u201d says Miguel Coelho, \u201cfor the sole reason we want to see Jackson Irvine score while we debate if that is a 70s pornstar moustache or a teenager-wanting-to-look-older one. Go Aussies!\u201d     7.42pm    40 min The Argentina fans, who were pretty quiet before the goal, are now making a joyful racket. Australia just need to get to half-time without further damage.     7.41pm    39 min One of the interesting things about Messi\u2019s goal is that it stemmed from him playing the hard man. He shoved Behich out of play, which annoyed Behich to the extent that he booted Gomez a few seconds later. The resulting free-kick led to the goal.     7.40pm    38 min Degenek is harshly booked for a foul on Acuna. He\u2019ll also miss the quarter-final if Australia get there.  Updated at 7.40pm GMT    7.39pm    It came from that free-kick on the right. Messi swung it into the six-yard box, where Souttar got in front of Ryan to head clear. Papu Gomez flicked a nonchalant volley out to Messi, who scampered infield and gave the ball to Mac Allister on the edge of the D. He fed it into Otamendi, who touched it off* to Messi, charging into the area. Messi took a quick touch and threaded a daisy-cutter across Ryan. That\u2019s a lovely finish, a pass rather than a shot, and much more like the slow-slow-quick football we expected to see tonight. * Or miscontrolled it, I\u2019m not entirely sure.  Updated at 7.57pm GMT    7.37pm   GOAL! Argentina 1-0 Australia (Yep 35)  Lionel Messi scores his first goal in a World Cup knockout game!    Updated at 7.41pm GMT    7.36pm    34 min Baccus dispossesses Messi for the fourth time in about five minutes. Maybe the lack of recovery time is a reason for Argentina\u2019s sluggish performance. Behich, irritated by a legitimate shoulder charge from Messi, puts Gomez up in the air. That\u2019s a silly tackle that gives Argentina a free-kick on the right wing.     7.35pm    33 min At the moment Argentina\u2019s tempo is slow-slow-slower.     7.32pm    31 min Baccus makes another good tackle on Messi, who was shaping to shoot from about 25 yards.     7.32pm    30 min De Paul finds Messi in a bit of space, but he\u2019s quickly dispossessed by a combination of Mooy and Baccus.     7.31pm    29 min Irvine wins a corner down the left. McGree\u2019s outswinger is met by the mighty Souttar, whose downward header hits Romero and ricochets to safety.      7.30pm    28 min \u201cHaving just pointed out that the Australian kit looks a bit like the Brazilian kit,\u201d begins Andy Gordon, \u201cmy Argentinian wife\u2019s fervour for this game has just gone up several notches.\u201d     7.29pm    27 min This is \u2013 no offence \u2013 utter muck from Argentina. Australia look so comfortable defensively, and at the moment they\u2019re having more of the ball as well.     7.27pm    25 min \u201cArgentina playing like they\u2019re perpetually feeling their way into the first five minutes of the game,\u201d says Paul Fitzgerald. Yeas, the pace has been really slow. As Danny Murphy points out on the BBC coverage, Australia\u2019s press isn\u2019t the best either, so Australia are able to pass the ball about in defence.     7.26pm    24 min Mooy\u2019s outswinging corner is headed away decisively by Otamendi.     7.25pm    24 min After a long spell of possession, Leckie\u2019s cross hits Acuna and goes behind for the first corner of the game. Set-pieces are really important for Australia\u2026   Updated at 7.30pm GMT    7.24pm    22 min Australia take care of another 60 seconds by passing the ball around at the back. Graham Arnold will be very happy with the first quarter of the game.      7.22pm    20 min \u201cA-Team???\u201d sniffs Alan Terlep. \u201c70s??? The A-Team is one of the most 80s of 80s American TV shows. It wouldn\u2019t have existed without Ronald Reagan.\u201d Yeah I\u2019ve had a shocker there.     7.21pm    19 min Australia\u2019s first good attack. Irvine gets to the byline on the left and cuts an excellent ball back towards Behich. He moves into the area but is tracked well by De Paul and eventually runs the ball out of play.     7.20pm    18 min \u201cI currently have Covid and my heart rate is elevated,\u201d says Amanjit Gill. \u201cSo I really REALLY need us to keep Messi out of our box. My life may depend on it.\u201d And people thought Bill Shankly was being sarcastic.     7.19pm    17 min Gomez cuts inside from the left and belts one into orbit.     7.18pm    17 min I know it\u2019s a cliche, but this realise is like a training exercise: attack and defence, invasion and repulsion. So far Australia are doing really well, though there\u2019s a helluva long way to go.     7.17pm    15 min Jackson Irvine is booked for an overzealous tackle on Acuna. He\u2019ll miss the quarter-final if Australia get there.     7.16pm    14 min \u201cUsed to like Argentina, starting with the great Mario Kempes,\u201d says Gene Salorio. \u201cPassarella too, greatest thug ever, Maradona not so much. Now not at all because the incessant drumbeat for \u2018blessed sainted most humble person ever Messi\u2019 is even more tiresome than CR\u2019s colossal ego. I\u2019d even root for England against them.\u201d There\u2019s a lot to unpick there.   Updated at 7.25pm GMT    7.14pm    12 min Alvarez has now started pulling out to the right, albeit with licence to roam. He wanders infield and then into the Australia area after a lucky ricochet, but Behich tracks him diligently and clears. Australia are defending well.     7.12pm    10 min A poor touch from Messi \u2013 a magnificently poor touch, the poor touch of a genius \u2013 allows Australia to break, but it\u2019s soon snuffed out. They are really struggling to keep the ball.   Updated at 7.15pm GMT    7.11pm    9 min The game is fairly uneventful, which at least allows me to try to work out what formation each team is playing. McGree is definitely on the left wing for Australia, though I can\u2019t quite work out Leckie\u2019s position.      7.09pm    7 min Baccus leaves one on Messi near the centre circle. It\u2019s all Argentina, though at the moment they are playing in front of Australia.     7.09pm    7 min Messi has started as a No10, with nobody on the right except the full-back Nahuel Molina.      7.07pm    6 min \u201cThe \u2018I pity the fool\u2026\u2019 catchphrase is one of the best and most durable around from the 1970s, but I\u2019ve always felt a little bit queasy about the BA Baracus character: a black musclebound simpleton there to do the bidding of cleverer and wilier white man. I don\u2019t think it was even particularly okay back in those days, and you\u2019d hope that it wouldn\u2019t get onto screen nowadays.\u201d You think he was a simpleton? Bit racist.     7.07pm    5 min I think the ball hit Baccus on the chest and then ricocheted onto his hand. If so, that would explain by VAR weren\u2019t interested.     7.06pm    4 min: Penalty appeal for Argentina. Gomez\u2019s cross from the left hit what looked like an outstretched hand of Baccus just inside the penalty area. The referee wasn\u2019t interested and play continues.  Updated at 7.06pm GMT    7.04pm    3 min Nothing to report as yet. Australia\u2019s formation looks like 4-4-2, which is a slight surprise. I think Jackson Irvine is playing on the left wing.  Updated at 7.05pm GMT    7.02pm    2 min \u201cGreetings from California,\u201d says Mary Waltz. \u201cStill mourning the US loss, but the Dutch schooled us, they were better. Argentina should carry this match easily. Australia\u2019s possible advantage? The psychological pressure that Argentina are under to help Messi win a World Cup. If the Aussies can keep it goalless for a long period of time the blue and white may crack under the pressure.\u201d     7.02pm    1 min Peep peep! Australia get the match under way, kicking from right to left as we watch.   Updated at 7.06pm GMT    6.58pm    \u201cAs a Socceroos fan, it\u2019s been generally agreed that this is the weakest squad we\u2019ve sent to the finals,\u201d says Andrew James. \u201cFor them to match the achievements of our strongest one (2006) is testament to Arnie\u2019s coaching. I don\u2019t expect we\u2019d beat Messi &amp; co, but it\u2019s a knockout game - anything is possible.\u201d     6.57pm    The players line up for the anthems. There\u2019s no doubt which side will feel at home tonight: the stadium is heaving with Argentina fans.     6.56pm    \u201cI like watching Lionel Messi play as much as the next person, and I understand that there is a narrative about this being his final chance to win the World Cup to match Maradona, etc,\u201d says David Wall. \u201cBut does his every action have to be made out to be evidence of his genius? \u201cAfter the game against Mexico all anyone wanted to talk about was his first touch to set up his goal. And yes, it was a good first touch, and he\u2019d not have been able to get his shot away if it\u2019d been bad. But it was nothing more than that. If that\u2019s the mark of genius then what does that say about Takuma Asano on his way to score Japan\u2019s second goal against Germany?\u201d This has been going on for ages. Messi\u2019s first goal of the 2014 World Cup was an own goal by Mensur Mujdza, but everyone was so high on narrative that they gave it to him. There was almost an omerta surrounding it. I can understand all this Messiperbole, even if it is a bit infantile.

Updated at 7.13pm GMT    6.45pm    Anyone following this game in Perth? What\u2019s it like watching a crucial World Cup game at 3am on a Sunday morning? (Or 5.30am if you\u2019re in Adelaide and 6am in you\u2019re in Melbourne.)  Updated at 6.49pm GMT    6.43pm    \u201cI pity the fool who thinks they know how this battle of the \u2018A\u2019-Teams will pan out,\u201d says Peter Oh. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that some of these players are not ready to go home yet. How do you say \u2018I ain\u2019t getting on no airplane!\u2019 in Spanish, and in Aussie English?\u201d      6.35pm    The King      6.33pm    The only previous World Cup meeting between these sides was an intercontinental playoff in 1993. Graham Arnold played in it, as did Diego Maradona.      6.29pm    \u201cI think the universe is paying us back for all the hard work we\u2019ve done\u201d This is a really nice piece on what the Australian team went through just to reach Qatar, never mind qualify for the last 16. I think I\u2019d like to work for Graham Arnold.      6.27pm    \u201cCome on Harry!\u201d says Joshua Reynolds. \u201cThe Stoke City faithful are thrilled. I\u2019m happy I already have a cat named \u2018Harry\u2019 that I can console or congratulate with a shower of tuna-flavoured treats.\u201d     6.27pm         6.12pm         6.08pm    Four channels we used to have      6.02pm    Lionel Messi plays the 1,000th game of his career tonight. He has scored 788 goals in that time, but none have been at the business end of a World Cup. It\u2019s one of modern football\u2019s odder stats that the Goat brothers, Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, have never scored in a World Cup knockout game. This will be Messi\u2019s ninth attempt.      5.55pm   Team news: Di Maria on the bench, Baccus starts  Both managers make one change. Papu Gomez replaces Angel Di Maria, who was a doubt because of a thigh injury and is only on the Argentina bench. And St Mirren\u2019s Keanu Baccus makes his full international debut for Australia, replacing Craig Goodwin. That means a paradoxically defensive switch from 4-4-2 to 4-3-3. Argentina (4-3-3) E Martinez; Molina, Romero, Otamendi, Acuna; De Paul, Fernandez, Mac Allister; Messi, Alvarez, Gomez.Substitutes: Armani, Foyth, Tagliafico, Montiel, Paredes, Pezzella, Di Maria, Rulli, Palacios, Correa, Almada, Rodriguez, Dybala, Lautaro Martinez, Lisandro Martinez. Australia (4-3-3) Ryan; Degenek, Souttar, Rowles, Behich; Baccus, Mooy, Irvine; Leckie, Duke, McGree.Substitutes: Atkinson, Karacic, Tilio, Wright, Maclaren, Hrustic, Mabil, Redmayne, Devlin, Vukovic, Deng, Kuol, King, Cummings. Referee Szymon Marciniak (Poland)   Updated at 6.30pm GMT    5.30pm    The team news should arrive just over an hour before kick-off. Both teams were highly impressive in beating Poland and Denmark, but the short turnaround \u2013 those games were on Wednesday \u2013 means there may be one or two changes.   Updated at 5.40pm GMT    5.30pm   Preamble  Hello and welcome to the battle of the bouncebackables. Of the 16 15 (farewell, USA) teams left in the World Cup last-chance saloon, Argentina and Australia have been there the longest. They each lost their first game 12 days ago, Argentina earthquakingly, before recovering to win the last two and qualify fir the knockout stage with authority. Argentina topped their group and rediscovered their swagger against Poland; Australia put out a fancied Denmark team and only finished behind France on goal difference. Both are aiming to make history \u2013 either in the next couple of weeks (Argentina) or the next few hours (Australia). Argentina want to win a third World Cup, and their first since a peedie Lionel Messi came into the world; Australia hope to become the first Socceroos men\u2019s team to reach the quarter-finals of a World Cup. Their only previous appearance in the last 16 was in 2006, when they missed a helluva chance to beat the eventual winners Italy. (I wonder what VAR would have made of Lucas Neill\u2019s challenge on Fabio Grosso.) Argentina\u2019s team is likely to include players from Paris Saint-Germain, Manchester City, Juventus and Atletico Madrid. The Australia coach Graham Arnold is shopping at Columbus Crew, Stoke City, Adelaide United and Fagiano Okayama. On paper it\u2019s a mismatch, but then so was Australia v Denmark. We\u2019ve assumed many results in this tournament, only to end up agape at the glorious unpredictability of the World Cup. The winners will play the Netherlands in the second quarter-final on Friday. Oh, and just one more thing. No. Social. Media. Kick off 7pm GMT, 10pm in Al Rayyan, 4pm in Buenos Aires, 6am (Sunday) in Canberra.   Updated at 5.39pm GMT "

                    "body": "A chat with Trevor Bayliss about Eoin Morgan\u2019s England retirement begins with a practically audible wry smile down the phone line when the former head coach brings up the Test team\u2019s daredevil approach during the 3-0 win against New Zealand.\n\u201cThe interesting thing will be when it doesn\u2019t work and whether you blokes get stuck into them for playing too many bloody shots,\u201d says Bayliss from his home in New South Wales on the day Morgan announced his news. \u201cEven during the Ashes [last winter], the English commentators were saying their players were getting bogged down and needed to be more proactive, play a few shots. Mate, where was that the previous few years? All I got was: \u2018They\u2019re playing too many.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a fair cop from the 59-year-old but something he finds amusing. His laidback, homespun positivity, allied with Morgan\u2019s laser vision, saw England scorch their way to World Cup glory in 2019 but in parallel Bayliss and \u201caggressive cricket\u201d were quickly cited on the days when the Test team tripped up and wickets tumbled like dominoes.\nBrendon McCullum, the new Test head coach, has said he wants to \u201ccut out the noise\u201d as he and Ben Stokes push the dial back towards the Bayliss way (probably beyond it, given their stated aim is to change how the sport is played). For the Australian, this is just the Antipodean cricket mentality at play.\n\u201cMcCullum rang me before he took off for England and we had a discussion about it,\u201d says Bayliss. \u201cHe played the game aggressively but to be honest, that\u2019s just how it is in our part of the world; it\u2019s not playing a Test match like it\u2019s a T20 but more the positive attitude. That\u2019s the most difficult thing to convince people of in the UK.\u201d\nBayliss sees plenty of Morgan\u2019s early methods as England\u2019s white-ball captain in the start made by Stokes as the Test equivalent, not least the all-rounder\u2019s own approach with the bat. Like Morgan back in the day, Stokes is seemingly playing with little regard for his numbers in an attempt to open minds and expand the limits of possibility.\n\u201cWe\u2019d be three or four down and Morgs would still go out there and take the game by the throat,\u201d says Bayliss. \u201cEven if it didn\u2019t work all the time, it gave others the confidence to play that way and push the ceiling.\n\n\u201cIt might not happen overnight for the Test team, especially given the variables of the format. But Stokes is a little more positive thinking than the last couple of captains, which might bring it on a bit quicker. Time will tell.\u201d\nMorgan\u2019s decision to bow out of international cricket and hand the white-ball reins to Jos Buttler surprised Bayliss, not least with a T20 World Cup later this year. \u201cBut at the same time it really shows you the type of bloke he is,\u201d he adds. \u201cMorgs would never hang around too long for his own benefit \u2013 the team comes first.\n\u201cHe\u2019s leaving a legacy that will be the basis of how the game is played for the next number of years too. Jos has played enough to see what\u2019s been successful and the core of players remains in place. Every captain brings something different but I can\u2019t see a huge departure from what\u2019s gone before.\u201d\nIt began in 2015 when Morgan was retained after a World Cup debacle that was scarcely of his making and paired with an outsider in Bayliss. \u201cWe knew each other previously from Kolkata Knight Riders and before I arrived in England we had discussions about the plan and names like Jason Roy came up. Morgs knew exactly how he wanted the team to play and he knew my background, so it was an easy fit.\n\n\u201cMorgs always took people\u2019s advice \u2013 he was open-minded and you could give him options. He would never make a rash decision. He was very calculated and considered. But when he did settle on a player or a tactic, he was 100% all in, no looking back. And he is very good at managing players.\n\u201cAdil Rashid, for example. He used him as a wicket-taker in the middle overs and even at the back end of an innings, giving him the full backing that he might go for runs but that didn\u2019t matter. All he wanted from him was wickets and they hit it off. That was such an important part of the team dynamic.\u201d\n\nDid Morgan ever raise his voice in the dressing room? \u201cNever. Not once. You could see the wheels turning at times but I can\u2019t remember him having terse words with anyone. Not only did the team become ruthless and test the ceiling of what was possible, they did it with smiles on their faces. That\u2019s 100% on Morgs. There was just genuine enjoyment of each other\u2019s company and friendships for life.\u201d\nOne man who may disagree is Alex Hales, central to the team\u2019s early rise only to then be banished on the eve of the World Cup after failing a recreational drugs test. The opener has not won a cap since \u2013 Morgan always dousing talk of a return \u2013 and whether this now changes under Buttler remains to be seen. \u201cMorgs does have that ruthless streak in him,\u201d says Bayliss. \u201cHe had a meeting with the senior players when the news broke and then came to me and said: \u2018This is what we think.\u2019 I didn\u2019t know it was happening until he came to me.\u201d\nDid Bayliss, as head coach, not feel undermined? \u201cNo, definitely not, mate \u2013 that\u2019s what I wanted from them, to make their own decisions and take responsibility. An old coach of mine once said: \u2018A good coach should do themselves out of a job \u2013 you coach players to make decisions.\u2019 By that stage, I had confidence in him and the others.\u201d\nIt is a captain-coach dynamic that will be rekindled this summer when Bayliss arrives to work at London Spirit in the Hundred and Morgan leads, a project the pair have been working on via zoom in recent weeks. \u201cNothing has really changed,\u201d replies Bayliss, delivering a typically deadpan final appraisal. \u201cHe\u2019s top notch.\u201d"

                    "body": "Ben Stokes has promised to be inspired rather than haunted by his memories of World Cup finals when England launch their latest bid for glory against Afghanistan in Perth on Saturday. Having missed last year\u2019s T20 World Cup, Stokes\u2019s previous appearance in the competition was in the 2016 final, when Carlos Brathwaite hit four successive sixes off his bowling to win it for West Indies. Since that infamous implosion he played a key role in England winning the 50-over World Cup at Lord\u2019s in 2019. \u201cIt was such a long time ago,\u201d he said of 2016. \u201cYou learn from stuff like that and use it as motivation to get better and drive you. As I\u2019ve always said, I never let that kind of stuff eat me up. The more you are in those [key matches] and the more you come out on top of them, obviously I think that does give you a slight upper hand maybe on some of the teams that haven\u2019t. I don\u2019t think winning one gives you any favours, I think you\u2019re just used to those high-pressure situations.\u201d  England are among the favourites for the World Cup, and were recently described by Australia\u2019s Matthew Wade as \u201cthe benchmark\u201d in the Twenty20 format, but Stokes has ignored the pre-tournament hype. \u201cGoing back to the 50-over game, we were No 1 for a long time going into that World Cup and that doesn\u2019t stand you anywhere when you come into knockout games,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just want to play the team, play the situation and stay very calm and level-headed, and then move on to the next game.\u201d Jos Buttler, the England captain, said his side were nowhere near favourites to lift the trophy for a second time in Australia. \u201cFar from it,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019re a dangerous team and we\u2019ve got a lot of talented players. It\u2019s hard to pick favourites but if you had to choose one it\u2019s probably Australia, in their own conditions and being reigning champions. So far you\u2019ve seen anyone can beat anyone and that will be the same throughout the next phase as well.\u201d  Before the recent three-game series against Australia, Stokes had not played a T20 international for more than 18 months and it has taken him some time to reacquaint himself with the format. \u201cT20 is completely different, full of energy, so you just need to practise more because it\u2019s such a different type of cricket,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been putting some hard yards in in training, getting used to the flow and feel of the game and getting the hours under my belt.\u201d Stokes also called on the ICC to re-examine the use of sponsored padding on the boundary edge, after Reece Topley tripped over it in Brisbane and sustained a tournament-ending injury. \u201cIt\u2019s stupid. You know what it\u2019s like, everybody wants to get their name somewhere,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you look at player safety and the fact he\u2019s stood on it and ruptured ligaments and now he\u2019s out of the World Cup \u2013 it should be looked at.\u201d  England will find a familiar face in the opposition dressing room when they get to Perth Stadium for Saturday\u2019s game, with Jonathan Trott coaching Afghanistan until at least the end of this year. Trott said he had been \u201cchomping at the bit\u201d for this game from the moment he saw the tournament fixtures. \u201cOur aim is to be competitive in every single match we play and win as many as possible,\u201d said Trott who is surely unique among World Cup coaches in having never visited the country he is working for. \u201cWe haven\u2019t come here to make up the numbers, the players certainly don\u2019t think like that and we certainly don\u2019t train like that. We\u2019ve got some good players and it\u2019s a case of bringing together a good squad with lots of options for different conditions so we can be a force around the world and not just in conditions where the players have grown up and that they\u2019re used to. Hopefully we can catch them on the hop a little bit.\u201d The job is Trott\u2019s first international coaching role, the 41-year-old taking over from Graham Thorpe after his compatriot was taken ill in July. \u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic opportunity for me,\u201d Trott said. \u201cI thought of the times I worked with Thorpey and tried to implement it with these guys. It\u2019s a big leap for me but you have to take the swimming wings off at some stage and jump in the deep end. That\u2019s what I want to do.\u201d"

                    "body": "Welcome to Moving the Goalposts, the Guardian\u2019s free women\u2019s football newsletter. Here\u2019s an extract from this week\u2019s edition. To receive the full version once a week, just pop your email in below:  For many years the United States have been at the very top of women\u2019s football. The USA have won four out of eight World Cups and their domestic game has always been seen as one of the leading women\u2019s leagues in the world. Recently, however, Canada (winning the 2020 Olympics after beating America in the semi-final) and England (winning Euro 2022 and beating the USA in a friendly in October) have closed the gap. There is tough competition for the NWSL [the women\u2019s league in the US] in regard to being the best and most viewed in the world with the Women\u2019s Super League in England making great strides. And now there is another competitor on the scene: Mexico\u2019s and, in particular, Tigres UANL. Recently they announced their 2-0 win against Am\u00e9rica in the Apertura 2022 final second leg on 15 November had the largest TV audience for a women\u2019s game in North America. The audience, according to the club, was 2.88 million watching it on Mexican TV. The match also had more than 700,000 views on Facebook Live and, most importantly, more than 41,000 present at the stadium. It continues a trend as the club attracts a huge fanbase and with that has come success. The league title was their fifth and they have been in eight of the 10 finals in the competition\u2019s history.  \u201cIt is like fulfilling a dream we had as children,\u201d says the club captain, Liliana Mercado. She has been with Tigres since 2017 and has played 202 games in the yellow and blue shirt, the most games in the history of the team and the league. \u201cWomen\u2019s football is here to stay. We are fortunate to be living in a time when it is possible to set these records in our country.\u201d How did Tigres do it? There is no single, simple answer \u2013 or a formula for others to follow \u2013 as a few factors have contributed. Their nickname is the Amazonas and over the past five years they have become intrinsically linked with the super hero Wonder Woman, herself an Amazonian and one of the most famous symbols of girl power there is. This has developed into a two-year partnership between the Liga MX team and Warner Bros, part of how they are building their identity. \u201cEach one of our players is a potential Wonder Woman,\u201d says the club president, Mauricio Culebro.  Another strategy is to use the club\u2019s already large fanbase on social media to promote their games and attract fans to the stadium. As Culebro says, they needed to give the female players an \u201cequal environment\u201d in relation to the men\u2019s team to grow their game. \u201cWe give them the same presence as the men. We promote games in many ways and also use interactions between the men\u2019s and women\u2019s squads,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need to remember that we have nine out of the 10 biggest attendances in Liga MX.\u201d The club have also been working on giving the Tigres Femenil squad a more international feel. The team is managed by the former Canada international Carmelina Moscato, who became the first foreign coach, as well as the first female coach, to win the league in her first year. \u201cWe have a young player called Mia Fishel from the United States, who preferred to come here rather than playing in the NWSL,\u201d Culebro says. \u201cAnd we have Uchenna Kanu, a Nigeria international forward, who fits perfectly in the team, and Natalia Gait\u00e1n, the captain of the Colombia national team. That shows how attractive our league already is.\u201d In August, the club announced a partnership with Angel City FC to develop the women\u2019s game in the US and Mexico and played a friendly against them, with the NWSL side winning 1-0. The goal is to strengthen the Tigres name in the US over the next few years. \u201cWe know that [the interest in women\u2019s football] in the US is one of the strongest in the world. This is why we are moving closer \u2013 to learn from the best how to develop the women\u2019s game,\u201d Culebro says.  Tigres\u2019 president also highlights the importance of choosing the right players and the best structure for his team. \u201cWhen Liga MX Femenil started, Tigres built a competitive team to fight for the title and it inspired other teams to do the same,\u201d he says. \u201cNow, as a result, our league is stronger, more competitive and is part of the development of young players who are becoming professionals. Even our national team now has a majority of players from the league.\u201d Strengthening the women\u2019s game in Mexico is the ultimate goal for the players. That is why the foundation of the team has not changed much over the past five years. \u201cEarly on Tigres put together a team with a solid foundation of players who are still important and have been for the first five years,\u201d Mercado says. Apart from Mercado, Bel\u00e9n Cruz, Fernanda Elizondo, Lizbeth Ovalle, Nancy Antonio, Natalia Villarreal, Nayeli Rangel and Ofelia Sol\u00eds have been there from the start and are proud to see the fruition of their work. \u201cIt is important for us to know that people identify with this team\u201d, she says. \u201cThere is no doubt that this squad is setting the tone for Mexican football.\u201d Talking points #OneLove: Former England international Alex Scott gained much attention by wearing a OneLove armband during the BBC\u2019s broadcast of the England men\u2019s debut in the 2022 Qatar World Cup. The pundit stepped in after the FA and other federations decided not to wear the piece, fearing sporting sanctions from Fifa.  Primera Iberdrola: Barcelona returned from the international break scoring as many goals as they could against Alav\u00e9s. The scoreboard showed an impressive 8-0 after the final whistle, which gives them high hopes for the game against Bayern Munich in the Women\u2019s Champions League on Thursday. Women\u2019s Championship: Sheffield United smashed the previous Women\u2019s Championship attendance record, with a crowd of 11,137 at their game against leaders London City Lionesses at Bramall Lane on Sunday \u2013 almost doubling the previous record of 5,752 set by Bristol City last season. Quote of the week \u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable to wait for prolonged periods to see a gynaecologist in this country on the NHS. And I have to say this: if these conditions were suffered by a man, there would be zero chance you would be waiting for a prolonged period\u201d \u2013 the Chelsea manager, Emma Hayes, on the state of women\u2019s healthcare in the NHS after her emergency hysterectomy.

In a letter released under freedom of information laws, Rudd cited the reporting by the Saturday Telegraph in May 2020 about Covid\u2019s origins, which appeared under the headline \u201cChina\u2019s batty science: Bombshell dossier lays out the case against the People\u2019s Republic\u201d. The details in this \u201cworld exclusive\u201d were attributed to \u201ca dossier prepared by concerned western governments\u201d. Rudd drew attention to previously published advice by Bret Walker SC.  \u201cThis advice noted that, in the absence of an exemption for media activities, any decision of News Corp Australia to receive and distribute information on behalf of a foreign government seeking to influence political discourse in Australia would be registrable,\u201d Rudd wrote in the October 2021 letter. \u201cAs you would be aware, numerous individuals have raised concern about the broad interpretation of the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Act including Gareth Evans, Malcolm Turnbull and me. \u201cIt would be damaging to public confidence in the scheme if your department, having taken such a firm approach with critics of the present [Morrison] government, were seen to continually give the government\u2019s greatest supporter an easy ride.\u201d The department\u2019s secretary, Katherine Jones, sent a formal response four months later, saying the department had considered the issues raised and \u201cdoes not have any information indicating\u201d that the report on \u201cChina\u2019s batty science\u201d was registrable under the scheme. \u201cIn particular, it is not clear that any activities related to publishing the report were undertaken on behalf of an identified foreign principal,\u201d she wrote in February 2022.  In the letter, Rudd also asked the head of the department for \u201cadvice on whether News Corp Australia has undertaken a registrable act on behalf of Audi, an entity related to governments in Qatar and Germany\u201d. In its general advice to the public, the department says people \u201cundertaking communications activities for the purpose of political or government influence on behalf of a foreign principal must register their activity, unless an exemption applies\u201d.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Rudd cited a 12-page liftout in the Australian newspaper called \u201cElectric Vehicles Special Report\u201d in September 2021, which included a number of full-page Audi advertisements and also included \u201cseveral articles lobbying government to enact policies favourable to Audi\u2019s electric vehicles\u201d. \u201cIt is my understanding that such \u2018special reports\u2019 have the appearance of news coverage, but they are in fact produced under a formal commercial arrangement in which News Corp Australia undertakes to supply coverage in exchange for a large advertising commitment,\u201d Rudd wrote. The lift-out also included an article authored by Paul Sansom, the chief executive of Audi Australia, which said there was \u201cmuch more to discuss around a federally led EV incentive strategy\u201d and the company would \u201clike to hear more about EV incentives from the federal government\u201d. Rudd also pointed out that the series was accompanied by sponsored posts on Facebook. His letter said Audi was a fully owned subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group, whose largest shareholders included the State of Lower Saxony (20% of the voting rights) and Qatar Holding LLC (17%). He said these were, respectively, a foreign sub-national government in Germany and an arm of the Qatar sovereign wealth fund. Jones wrote back to Rudd saying the department dealt with issues on a case-by-case basis, and its compliance strategy preferred to resolve matters through voluntary cooperation with registrants or potential registrants wherever possible.  She acknowledged Rudd\u2019s feedback about the potential need for amendments to clarify the laws as they applied to media organisations and said the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security was reviewing whether the scheme remained \u201cfit for purpose\u201d. Jones said the department believed \u201cthat the available information is not sufficient to indicate that the special report constitutes a registrable activity undertaken on behalf of a foreign principal\u201d. \u201cThose parts of the special report that are clearly labelled as Audi-produced material, including the article from the CEO of Audi Australia, would fall under the Act\u2019s \u2018disseminator exemption\u2019 for material produced by third parties,\u201d Jones wrote. \u201cFor other articles in the special report containing discussion of federal policy settings in relation to electric vehicles, the department is not able to determine that they constitute an activity undertaken on behalf of a foreign principal within the meaning of the Act.\u201d A staffer to Rudd replied to the public servant who had emailed a copy of the letter: \u201cSo in summary: News Corporation can be paid by a foreign government-related entity to assign their journalists write articles supporting their interests vis-\u00e0-vis regulation of their interests in Australia, but because neither News Corp or the foreign principal elects to tell the department, the department doesn\u2019t want to know? \u201cDon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell.\u201d The department declined to provide further comment when contacted by Guardian Australia, with a spokesperson saying the letter from Jones set out the department\u2019s views. News Corp did not respond to a request for a response. Since leaving politics, Rudd has become one of News Corp\u2019s most trenchant critics and has spearheaded a campaign for a royal commission. The Labor state conference in Queensland on Sunday passed a resolution calling on the federal government to establish a royal commission into media diversity in Australia. The newly obtained documents cover all correspondence between former prime ministers and the Attorney General\u2019s Department since September 2021, and mostly showed Rudd\u2019s office contacting officials to clarify his own registration requirements. Based on expansive departmental advice, Rudd has used the register to disclose a wide range of activities, including interviews with state-owned broadcasters. But in one case, the department informed Rudd that his registration lodged in December 2021 for a book launch on behalf of the Catholic Archdiocese of Melbourne was unnecessary. \u201cThe department\u2019s understanding is that individual dioceses and archdioceses of the Catholic church in Australia are, for relevant purposes, separate from the Holy See and Vatican City State, and individual dioceses and archdioceses do not form part of a foreign government in their own right.\u201d The documents also show the former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull having difficulty signing in to the website after the start of the 2022 election campaign, when registrants are required to update and confirm any disclosures. In one email to the department, subject line \u201cRe: reset password\u201d, Turnbull wrote: \u201cThanks for this email. I have despite several attempts not been able to log on to the website. I have no changes to report to my earlier filing. So pls take note of that.\u201d It is not the first time Turnbull \u2013 whose government brought in the foreign influence transparency scheme \u2013 has had issues with the website. In a previous tranche of documents, Turnbull said it was \u201csuch a difficult website to use\u201d. \u2022 Disclosure: Guardian Australia produces a variety of content with funding from outside parties, including EV manufacturers.

                    "body": "  5.30pm    Sophie Downey was sent to Coventry to cover this one and here\u2019s her match report.       5.21pm    Here\u2019s the three goals from Cov.         5.19pm    Two-goal Rachel Daly speaks to ITV.  There were spells where they put us under pressure but we stayed patient. We were disappointed to concede but we got the win, stuck to the gameplan and it was a good team performance today. I think I\u2019m pretty good in the air. It helps when I play in all sorts of positions. \u201cI\u2019m here to score goals when I play up front. I always say I\u2019ll play anywhere. I enjoyed it today. Winning the game was the main thing and I\u2019m glad we could deliver. That\u2019s what comes with the depth of this squad. Everyone is capable of playing. It keeps us on our toes and the competition is so healthy.   Updated at 5.26pm GMT    5.13pm    Documentary proof of that record Cov crowd.       5.10pm   Full-time: England 2-1 Italy  That\u2019s a wrap. All hail Rachel Daly, two fine headers took the spoils for England\u2019s unfamiliar team as the ever versatile Villa player seized her chance to play at centre-forward. Sarina Wiegman knows a little more about her reserve players now, and a couple of youngsters too. That makes it 28 unbeaten under her, and roll on Belgium on Wednesday. Coventry has seen a decent contest.      5.07pm    90+3 min: Le Tissier struggles again, and Serturini can make a burst in search of that equaliser. Thankfully for Roebuck and Le Tissier, Serturini smashes wide.      5.05pm    90 min: Five minutes added on, and so the job\u2019s not complete just yet.      5.04pm    89 min: Most of the amusement now coming as a lone trumpeter plays out the In-ger--lund chants. They\u2019re loud, and getting the job done. So does Wubben-Moy in clearing up some clear and present danger in the corner. More David Penney: \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m a fan of the tikitaka short goal kick strategy either; I get the theory of having a person over but it has to work perfectly or otherwise it can go very, very wrong.\u201d  Updated at 5.04pm GMT    5.00pm    86 min: England not exactly rushing here. They have Belgium to play on Wednesday, let us recall. Here\u2019s that second goal, by the way.       4.59pm    84 min: Italy look to try and end their losing streak, and it\u2019s down the left where Maya Le Tissier has not always had it easy that they try. The ball loops out behind the goal for some relief to England.      4.57pm    82 min: A record crowd announced for the Coventry Building Society Stadium, though there are empty seats visible. Could be \u201ctickets sold\u201d, might be the actual attendance but the locals\u2019 imaginations have been captured at a stadium with a rather mixed history.      4.55pm    81 min: Off comes Rachel Daly, the heroine of the hour, who won\u2019t get time for a hat-trick and on comes Ebony Salmon of the Houston Dash.      4.53pm    77 min: Zelem is sitting deep as the playmaker as England have a control of the midfield they didn\u2019t always enjoy in the first half.      4.50pm    75 min: Wubben-Moy gets the ball launched when the ever dangerous Bonanesa is bearing down on goal.      4.49pm    73 min: Good response from England, but there\u2019s the quality they can bring on from the bench. The WSL continues to churn out such a high standard of player, and Sarina Wiegman can do no wrong.      4.46pm   Goal! England 2-1 Italy (Daly, 71)  Rachel Daly scores a fine header, from a fine cross from Lauren James. A lovely header in fact. Is there a vacancy for the England No. 9 spot? Hell yeah there\u2019s a vacancy for the No. 9 spot. One in the eye for the Russomaniacs out there.    Updated at 5.27pm GMT    4.43pm    69 min: David Penney gets in touch: \u201cKaren doesn\u2019t like it, but that was a Japan-style valid goal.\u201d Yes, like this.      4.42pm    68 min: Kelly forces a corner as England build up some momentum.      4.41pm    66 min: England have a test, and that\u2019s no bad thing with the year ahead the Lionesses face. The goal came from nowhere, probably shouldn\u2019t have stood but now England have to win the game again.      4.40pm    64 min: England make a trio of changes. James, Kelly and Wubben-Moy are on now. Alex Greenwood, Lauren Hemp and Katie Robinson make way. We have a game on our hands.      4.38pm   Goal! England 1-1 Italy (Cantore, 62)  Chaotic goal, very possibly not a goal at all. The ball looked to have gone out at the byline and then Cantore, one of Italy\u2019s subs, nodded the ball in. Ellie Roebuck could have done far better than palm it over the line. It did cross, but then it had been out in the first place when Bonansea crossed. No VAR, no goal-line tech so goal.    Updated at 4.46pm GMT    4.34pm    59 min: Joe Pearson on Rocking All Over The World: \u201cAs for Fogerty, I was never much a fan of his particular flavor of \u2018swamp rock\u2019. But did you know that after he went solo, Fantasy, CCR\u2019s record label, sued him for plagiarism OF HIMSELF!? They lost.\u201dI did. Fogerty\u2019s is a tale enmeshed in legal matters. Huge talent, mind.      4.31pm    56 min: Harry Wolf gets in touch: \u201cAlessia Russo IS the number 9 - there is NO vacancy.\u201d Let\u2019s see, though Karen Carney, my Guardian colleague, was making a not dissimilar point in ITV\u2019s broadcast.      4.29pm    55 min: So close, Jordan Nobbs. Good save Giuliani in goal, but Italy under the cosh here. They make a couple of changes, too.      4.28pm    53 min: England might have had another, Alex Greenwood releasing Coombs who has her shot blocked twice.      4.27pm    51 min: Katie Zelem fact: her uncle Peter, who played for Chester City, was Zelem was the first post-war Football League player to have a surname beginning with a Z, first appearing the season before Romeo Zondervan joined Ipswich.  Repeating myself here but her dad, Alan, Peter\u2019s twin, was a goalie for Macclesfield in the GM Vauxhall Conference days of the late 1980s. He had a keening, piercing voice when calling to his defenders.      4.24pm    49 min: Zelem soon enough shows her vision with a fizzing ball out to Robinson.      4.23pm    48 min: A quiet start when compared to that frantic opening, and England play calmly rather than directly. The two players who went off were midfielders, where England suffered.     4.20pm    46 min: What can Jordan Nobbs offer? She\u2019s been so unlucky with injuries while Katie Zelem missed out on the Euros by not much.      4.19pm    Half-time subs: on comes Katie Zelem and Jordan Nobbs, two very popular players, for Keira Walsh and Jess Park.     4.16pm    A Dr Aust gets in touch: \u201cEngland women\u2019s no 9 vacancy? Really? Ought surely to be Alessia Russo\u2019s, who improved the team in every game in the Euros when she came on as a sub for Ellen White.\u201d Clearly the player in possession but not set in stone.      4.04pm    It\u2019s World Cup year, remember.       4.04pm   Half-time: England 1-0 Italy  It\u2019s been bitty at times but even with an unfamiliar team, the Lionesses eventually hit their stride. A very nice goal from the ever dependable Rachel Daly but more may be needed against an Italian team who have been quite decent so far.      4.02pm    45 min: Daly on the end of a Le Tissier cross and rattles the crossbar, only to be called back for an offside. Nevertheless, she\u2019s been quite the target for her teammates.      4.00pm    43 min: Giacinti looks in on goal from a Bonanesa pass but Ellie Roebuck is equal to the task, scampering out to claim the ball. Good, alert keeping from someone who\u2019s been a bystander for most of the game.      3.58pm    41 min: The Lionesses, by the way, look far likelier to get the next goal. Hemp over-deliberates in the box when she\u2019s got space and time to shoot.      3.56pm    39 min: Good question by David Holland, for which I don\u2019t have the answer. He gets in touch: \u201cThere were 31,000 tickets sold for this match. When I looked for tickets on Friday the only ones available were in the back two rows of the corner. Any idea why there are so many empty seats?\u201d Great swathes empty for a near sell-out, that are visible on TV? Shades of Qatar 2022. Was at this stadium a few weeks back, and one end was completely empty \u2013 Cov v Wrexham. It made for a right bracing breeze.  Any ideas on the empty seats? Get in touch.      3.53pm    37 min: Italy struggling to respond to the speed of England, who now look far more of a unit. That goal seemed to energise them and the midfield passing patterns are paying off, too.      3.51pm    35 min: Daly\u2019s goal shows the options Wiegman has within her squad. Rachel Daly won the Euros as a left-back, let us recall.      3.49pm   Goal! England 1-0 Italy (Daly, 33)  The breakthrough at last! Hemp scampers to the line, and the ball is cleared. The second ball comes back in, and there\u2019s Daly to finish. Robinson chips in from the right and Daly heads in. That\u2019s what happens when she plays as a centre-forward.   Updated at 4.02pm GMT    3.47pm    30 min: Walsh in the thick of it, as Italy continue to defend deep and compact. Rachel Daly chases the ball down out wide as a No 9, but can\u2019t find the speed to reach the ball. There\u2019s a vacancy in that position with Ellen White having retired.      3.45pm    27 min: All England for the last few minutes, but Italy are holding firm enough, with the Lionesses\u2019 midfield struggling for fluency.      3.41pm    25 min: This hasn\u2019t been anywhere as easy as was expected in pre-match, though all those changes have resulted in a disjointed England performance, as can only be expected.      3.38pm    22 min: Hemp is released out wide, links with Park, and on the opposite flank, Robinson cuts in, but is tackled. Italy are showing off their experience here.      3.36pm    19 min: Bonanesa shows off some really neat skill, but she can\u2019t release the ball out wide. England have been forced to go more direct by an opponent that seems more comfortable on the ball. Get it launched? Well, that\u2019s always the best policy.      3.34pm    17 min: Nice run by Charles, in from the left, and sets up Maya Le Tissier for a shot that is rather hurried. And no, no relation to the famed alternative thinker.      3.32pm    15 min: Italy are doing well, and Lauren Hemp is forced into evasive action and a foul. There\u2019s relief when Girelli is caught offside.      3.31pm    12 min: England\u2019s bright start fading? Greenwood is in the thick of things as one of the more experienced players on show amid this inexperienced lineup.      3.27pm    10 min: Italy riding out a storm, and gain some territory. England\u2019s defenders do admirably enough with a corner. Italy seem fine in midfield, and then England\u2019s attacks have come on the counter.      3.24pm    7 min: Rachel Daly forces a chance by hunting down an Italian defender and forcing a mistake and then a decent save from Giuliani.       3.22pm    5 min: But Italy go on the attack, Galli shows off her class, playing in Giacinti to force a decent save from Roebuck. The corner is wasted but the danger of the visitors has already been revealed.      3.20pm    4 min: Early burst by Robinson, released by Jess Park, and she looks full of speed. Been a busy afternoon already for the Italian defence.      3.19pm    2 min: England begin on the front foot, and force a quick corner. Plenty of the usual impetus, even with that unfamiliar lineup.      3.17pm    1 min: The players take the knee to applause. Worth noting that the England players are wearing purple wristbands during today\u2019s game to display their support for gender equality and in a show of solidarity for the Canadian women\u2019s national team. Canada\u2019s players are in dispute with Canada Soccer because of concerns over funding cuts and a lack of pay equality.      3.13pm    The teams are in the tunnel, and make their way into the Warwickshire afternoon. Pretty full crowd in the arena, and flames a-burning in the pre-match ceremony. The Italian anthem rings out first, sung lustily by their players. God Save The King now, as we look for those who can\u2019t help sing \u201cqueen\u2019, which sounds better anyway. Lennon and McCartney would have chosen Queen over King as the key word.      3.03pm    Sarina Wiegman speaks to ITV.   The camp has been nice. [Katie Robinson] is very quick and very agile. We want her to run behind and be involved in possession when we need it. Hopefully, she can attack crosses from the opposite side and also deliver some too. [Jess Park] started out wide but at her club, she can also come inside and play as a 10. We want to see her as a 10 today to see where she is at in this moment and where she relates to this team. With three games we want to try some things and one of those is that [Rachel] Daly starts as number nine. I think there will be more duels and they will challenge us more in possession so we need to prepared for that.      3.00pm    Find it remarkable that the Lionesses\u2019 theme tune is Rockin\u2019 All Over The World, made famous by Status Quo, actually written by John Fogerty of Creedence Clearwater Revival fame.    Quo\u2019s version is better, isn\u2019t it? Nice piano on the Fogerty version, mind.      2.47pm    Ahead of this game, Emma Hayes, the Chelsea manager, had some interesting thoughts on the diversity of the women\u2019s game.   Women\u2019s football is quite a middle-class sport in my opinion. In terms of the locations, the pedigree of player, they\u2019re often coming from suburban belts around the training grounds. They\u2019re not the Alex Scotts, the Rachel Yankeys, the Anita Asantes. They\u2019re not coming to our facilities in the same way and you\u2019ve got to ask yourself the question: why? Look at the number of footballers that came out of south-east London and into the England men\u2019s team; an unbelievable number. Why aren\u2019t they in the women\u2019s side? I often ask that question [at Chelsea]. They\u2019re all from Surrey. They\u2019re the most talented kids in Surrey. But are they the most talented kids around? I beg to differ. Why aren\u2019t we going into London? Why aren\u2019t we hosting our academies right in the heart of London? Who in their ivory tower has been dreaming up this prawn sandwich girls football club?       2.45pm    Here\u2019s the Italy starting team, by the way, a stronger lineup than they picked against Belgium. Italy: Giuliani, Salvai, Boattin, Lenzini, Bergamaschi, Giugliano, Rosucci, Galli, Girelli, Giacinti, Bonanesa. Subs: Schroffenegger, Baldi, Filangeri, Linari, Cantore, Cafferata, Bonfantini, Serturini, Polli, Caruso, Piemonte, Greggi, Catena, Orsi, Severini.  Updated at 2.50pm GMT    2.38pm    Keira Walsh returns, and Wiegman had this to say on the Barcelona player.   It is really nice for her that she is back, because of course she wants to be part of the team and we want to see her play. It will be really nice to have her on the pitch.      2.28pm    That\u2019s 10 changes made to the England team by Sarina Wiegman, with only Alex Greenwood remaining from MK. Jess Park and Maya Le Tissier are both earning their second caps.   Updated at 2.28pm GMT    2.25pm   The England team is in   England: Roebuck, Greenwood, Walsh, Hemp, Daly, Park, Carter, Charles, Robinson, Le Tissier, Coombs. Subs: Earps, Bronze, Bright, Williamson, Kelly, Stanway, Russo, Toone, James, Salmon, Zelem, MacIver, Wubben-Moy, Nobbs     2.15pm   Preamble  Thursday saw Sarina Wiegman\u2019s team do what we have become accustomed to in taking apart South Korea. From Milton Keynes to Coventry, their tour of the southern Midlands continues, and this time it\u2019s the Italians. Italy lost 2-1 to Belgium in their opening game of the Arnold Clark \u2013 does anyone call it The Arnie? \u2013 to continue what has been a shaky buildup to this summer\u2019s World Cup, for which they are qualifiers, and face Sweden, South Africa, Italy, Argentina in the group stage. They\u2019ve lost their last four matches, by contrast to the Lionesses, still yet to lose a match of all the 27 Wiegman has presided over. The expectation has to be an England win, doesn\u2019t it, with the sun-bleached Sky Blue seats of the former Ricoh Arena rattling to the sound of another triumph for this nation\u2019s saving grace of a football team.  Per Suzanne Wrack  Italy finished bottom of their group at Euro 2022 but face the champions buoyed up by topping their section in World Cup qualifying, winning nine of their 10 matches. Wiegman said: \u201cItaly are a pretty good team. What they do tactically is they do different things in the game which will challenge us \u2013 sometimes a high press, sometimes dropping a little deeper. It\u2019s good for us to adapt to that and scan continuously as a team what they do and be proactive in that so we can control the game.\u201d  Kick-off at 3.15pm. Join me.   "

                    "body": "Good morning. In years past, reports of cold weather might have brought up hope of a white Christmas. This winter, however, the prospect of snow on Christmas Day isn\u2019t a cause for celebration for millions of people in the UK, who may be in a position where they have to pick between eating and staying warm. It\u2019s -6C and -7C in parts of the country as this email is sent, while temperatures are expected to drop to -10C in northern Scotland. This Arctic breeze has triggered a level three \u201csevere\u201d cold weather alert for England, which is expected to continue until 12 December. However, if these low temperatures persist then it is likely that it will stay. In response, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has activated emergency measures to protect vulnerable people, such as those sleeping rough. The UK Health Security Agency is encouraging people to warm their homes to at least 18C \u2013 a recommendation many will want to follow, but struggle to afford. Today\u2019s newsletter takes a look at the effects on people\u2019s health and finances as the temperature continues to drop. Here are the headlines. Five big stories  Iran | Security forces in Iran have been shooting female protesters in the face and genitals at anti-regime protests, according to interviews with medics. The Guardian has spoken to 10 medical professionals who warned the injuries could leave hundreds of young Iranians with permanent damage. Financial regulation | Jeremy Hunt is due to unveil a 30-point package of City policy changes on Friday rowing back on regulations in order to boost competition and growth. The changes are Hunt\u2019s attempt to rebrand what predecessor Kwasi Kwarteng called a post-Brexit \u201cBig Bang 2.0\u201d for the City. Harry Dunn | The mother of British teenager Harry Dunn has said her promise to win him justice has been fulfilled after his killer was sentenced, but said it was \u201cdespicable\u201d that she had failed to appear in court. Anne Sacoolas, a US citizen, received an eight-month suspended sentence and was disqualified from driving for 12 months. Health | Data from the UK Health Agency has revealed that 15 children under the age of 15 have died in the UK from strep A since September. The vast majority of infections are relatively mild, but sometimes the bacteria cause a life-threatening illness. Russia | US basketball star Brittney Griner has been freed from Russia after 10 months in jail on drugs charges. Griner was released in a prisoner exchange for the arms dealer Viktor Bout.  In depth: \u2018Warm banks\u2019 and fuel debt \u2013 how the vulnerable will try to get by  Amid the energy crisis, many people have understandably been putting off heating their homes \u2013 and with mild temperatures in parts of the UK over the last few months, it was an option for many households. However, as temperatures sharply plummet this week, we are facing the bleak winter that was predicted earlier this year \u2013 and many people are gearing up to make some tough choices. *** Why is it so cold? On Wednesday overnight temperatures dropped dramatically, as Arctic winds \u2013 forced south between high and low pressure systems in Russia and Greenland \u2013 created an \u201cArctic blast\u201d over the UK and northern Europe. The temperature drop feels even more dramatic because we have had an unseasonably warm autumn and, in recent years, December has not been a particularly cold month for many parts of England. *** The effects of the energy crisis A few months ago, there were dire warnings of power cuts in the UK. Thankfully, that is now looking unlikely because European countries have refilled their gas storages far quicker than expected. While this is welcome news, the question of whether people will even be able to use this energy remains. New research shows that more than three million low-income households cannot afford to heat their homes, and the charity National Energy Action estimates that there are already 6.7 million households living in fuel poverty. Even with the energy price guarantee, bills are almost double what they were last winter and 2.4 million people have used credit cards or borrowed money to pay them this year. For many, the choice is between putting themselves in an even more financially precarious situation or risking the health and wellbeing of themselves and their families. People have been doing everything they can to cut costs; earlier this year, for example, Alex Lawson reported in the Guardian that some parents were eating cold meals to save on power. More than 3,000 warm banks are listed by the Warm Welcome Campaign, with libraries and other public spaces being offered up to be used in this capacity \u2013 an example of communities coming together to protect the most vulnerable, but also a damning indictment of the decaying social safety net. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t just help financially, it\u2019s emotionally too, it\u2019s a feeling,\u201d Linda Jay Jordan, 33, told Jessica Murray in Birmingham yesterday. \u201cWhile you\u2019re here you\u2019re not thinking about the bills. It\u2019s warm and welcoming. The atmosphere is lovely.\u201d To offset some of the financial burden, the government has confirmed that people in more than 300 postcode areas across England and Wales will receive cold weather payments, which come into effect when an area has experienced an average temperature of freezing or below for a seven-day period. However, at \u00a325 a week this may not go far for many. *** What are the health impacts? While many will feel the health effects of low temperatures, homeless people and rough sleepers are perhaps the most vulnerable group. The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, has said that emergency accommodation will be open to rough sleepers until Monday, with City Hall adding that every borough in the capital will ensure that no one will be asked to leave until more permanent provisions are put in place for them. More broadly, those with underlying health conditions such as heart disease, asthma and diabetes often experience worsening symptoms during periods of cold weather. For older people the problems are further exacerbated the longer the exposure to the cold lasts, worsening arthritis, and increasing the likelihood of accidents at home, as well as strokes and heart attacks. Authorities are urging people to check in on vulnerable members of the community and to offer extra help. While this is vital in ensuring that people are safe, individual efforts like this are merely a plaster on a deeper wound. What else we\u2019ve been reading  After much anticipation, the first half of Netflix\u2019s six-episode docuseries on Prince Harry and Meghan Markle dropped yesterday (I must admit I watched, half-confused, half-enthralled by the soap-like drama). Jim Waterson wrote a great piece of analysis on the way the documentary that is condemning the British media is sending traffic their way. Zoe Williams examines how the series did well in exposing the wave of intolerance that Meghan endured. Lucy Mangan gave it a three star review. And for those who don\u2019t want to spend nearly three hours watching, Stuart Heritage gave us the five most important takeaways. Nimo The key goal for Cop15?

Charlie Lindlar, production editor, newsletters Rachel Connolly is unimpressed with Oxford English Dictionary\u2019s word of the year, dismissing it as a PR stunt. \u201cI have never once in my life heard someone say the phrase \u2018goblin mode\u2019, or use it in a message. Not this year, not ever,\u201d she writes. I have to say \u2026 I agree.

Charlie  World Cup  The appalling human cost of the Qatar World Cup was brought back into focus yesterday when the chief executive of the tournament appeared to dismiss the importance of the death of a migrant worker, a Filipino national working at the Saudi Arabia national team\u2019s training site who died after he \u201cslipped off a ramp while walking alongside a vehicle and fell headfirst against concrete\u201d.

There are two quarter-finals today: Croatia v Brazil at 3pm UK time, then Netherlands v Argentina at 7pm UK time. Ciaran McLoughlin examines the Argentina side, writing that while Lionel Messi has unsurprisingly taken the headlines, much credit for the team\u2019s success belongs to Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez.

                    "body": "Harrods more than doubled the pay of its managing director, Michael Ward, last year to \u00a32.3m, even as the company collected almost \u00a36m in government support under the furlough scheme. Ward, understood to be the highest-paid director at the upmarket department store in Knightsbridge, west London, increased his package from \u00a31m the previous year after Harrods returned to profit as pandemic restrictions eased. Harrods Limited, the company that operates the London store, made a pretax profit of \u00a351m in the year to the end of January 2022 after a loss of \u00a368m a year earlier. Sales soared by 35% to \u00a3582m on the easing of lockdown restrictions and the return of international travellers, including those from the Middle East. The department store said it had benefited from furlough payments of \u00a35.8m in the 12 months to 29 January, although that was considerably lower than the \u00a323.5m in the prior year. The reduction in support came as high street lockdowns reduced and the number of staff at Harrods Limited fell by more than 400 to 3,511. The retailer also increased internal royalty payments from \u00a323.2m to \u00a333.5m. The payments cover interest on an inter-company loan. No dividend payments were made in the year to Harrods\u2019 owner the Qatar Investment Authority sovereign wealth fund, which has a property portfolio in London that includes the Shard skyscraper and parts of the Olympic Village in Stratford. The accounts reveal Harrods has a \u00a3620m loan that matures in October next year after securing an 18-month extension. Ward told the Times, which first reported Harrods\u2019 profit figures, that he was comfortable the retailer had sufficient cashflow to cover higher interest rates. Ward told the Sunday Times the business was on track to bounce back this year to the sales of about \u00a3870m achieved pre-pandemic. A spokesperson for Harrods said it was \u201cextremely grateful to have received support from the government\u201d as its store closed for 10 weeks between January and April 2021. It said the highest-paid director\u2019s salary increase reflected a \u201csubstantial pay reduction in 2020\u201d as well as taking into account that \u201cHarrods outperformed its targets and predictions, and significantly outperformed the wider luxury industry\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 1 November 2022. The internal royalty payments of \u00a333.5m paid by Harrods Limited cover interest on an inter-company loan, not interest on a loan from Harrods\u2019 owners, the Qatar Investment Authority sovereign wealth fund, as an earlier version said."

                    "body": "C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta has admitted he considered leaving Chelsea last season until deciding to \u201cstay in my home\u201d after the turmoil that ushered in a new era under Todd Boehly. The Chelsea captain signed a two-year contract extension last week having held talks over a return to Spain with Barcelona. His previous deal had been due to expire this summer, although Chelsea activated a 12-month extension clause and the club\u2019s former owners had offered a new one-year contract. Azpilicueta considered leaving Stamford Bridge after victory in the Club World Cup in February completed his trophy collection with Chelsea. But the sanctions that were imposed on the club, and led to Roman Abramovich selling up, prompted a change of heart in the 32-year-old. \u201cYes the conversations were there [with Barcelona],\u201d said the defender. \u201cAfter the Club World Cup, where I became the only player to ever win every trophy, I felt it was the time to go back. But then everything happened with this club. I wanted to stay committed to the club. I never did anything against my club. \u201cWe had private conversations where I said everything. We had players leaving and I have never been in a transfer market situation in 10 years. It was different. For a period I was a free agent and who knows what could have happened in that period. I decided to stay silent because I think there was already enough noise around me. I didn\u2019t want to make it worse because I wanted to stay focused on my game.\u201d Azpilicueta believes his form deteriorated towards the end of last season not because of uncertainty over his future but due to playing regularly as a wing back for Thomas Tuchel. \u201cIt was a turning point at the Club World Cup. I tried so hard to win this trophy,\u201d he explained. \u201cAt that moment I felt differently. It was like, \u2018Wow, I have won everything for this club so maybe a new chapter arrives\u2019. It\u2019s true that at the last break, my performances were not as good as before. I paid a big price for playing from December to February. I think I played the most minutes and I did it playing wing back. I am not getting younger and it is a position that demands a lot of energy every three days and playing the Club World Cup. I think all the emotions, feelings and tiredness made me feel like this. The last two months I wasn\u2019t as good physically as before. \u201cI had a meeting with the new owners. They wanted me to stay here to lead the team both on and off the pitch. It\u2019s a big thank you to them. They were very honest and transparent from the first day. I felt a responsibility to stay here in my home. My family are happy here. We have a new project with new players and youngsters coming in. I feel right and ready to look forward.\u201d"

                    "body": "The ambitious development of the Saudi region of Neom, goes the PR gush, is \u201cdedicated to the sanctity of all life on Earth\u201d. Well, not quite all, it turns out. It was recently reported that three members of the Huwaitat tribe, arrested for protesting against the forced eviction of their and other families to make way for it, have been sentenced to death. Another protester from the tribe was shot dead by security forces in 2020. Which, for all those businesses and consultants who help to plan, design, build, market and otherwise enable monuments for tyrants, poses an old question with new force: what point is too much? When will whatever gain that might arise from the creation of extraordinary buildings cease to outweigh the atrocities that go with them? Neom is arguably the most dramatic project in the world of architecture and construction right now. It includes The Line, a planned structure to house 9 million people, that will run dead straight for 170 kilometres (105 miles), projecting at one end into the Red Sea, but will be only 200 metres wide. It will be flanked on either side by 500-metre high walls of building, mirrored on the outside. Imagine a tower taller than the Empire State Building extruded from Birmingham to Leeds, and then doubled, and you have an idea of the scale. There have been some doubts whether The Line would truly happen but last week drone footage showed that a start has been made on digging its foundations.  It will be, claimed Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, \u201ca civilisational revolution that puts humans first, based on a radical change in urban planning\u201d. It comes with extravagant promises about sustainability. It will allegedly \u201cblend with nature\u201d. Neom also includes Oxagon, a city for tech industries built on the sea, and Trojena, a mountain region where, with the help of yet more spectacular architecture, the 2029 Asian Winter Games will be held. The Line raises doubts, urbanistically speaking. How can such a colossal project be in any sense sustainable, given that its construction would produce (according to one estimate) more than 1.8bn tonnes of carbon dioxide, which is equivalent to more than four years of the UK\u2019s entire emissions? What is the benefit of its height, when there is so much desert in which it could spread out? What would actually be good about life in this deep narrow canyon, probably subjected to high levels of surveillance and control? But the salient fact about Neom is that it is clearly an instrument of both soft and hard power wielded by an exceptionally murderous and repressive regime. It is aided and abetted by western consultancies such as the once-hip Californian practice of Morphosis (which is designing The Line) and the London-based Zaha Hadid Architects (at work in Trojena), both of them winners of the biggest prize in architecture, the Pritzker. How might they square what\u2019s left of their progressive reputations with a real estate endeavour where objectors get killed?  It\u2019s not a new issue. Monumental architecture has gone with power since ancient Egypt and before, and powerful regimes tend to be brutal. More recent examples include the decision by the also Pritzker-winning Dutch practice OMA to design the vast headquarters of the Chinese government\u2019s main television station CCTV, completed in 2012; as the writer Ian Buruma asked: would they have done the same favour for Pinochet\u2019s Chile? You could also look at the stadiums built for the forthcoming World Cup in Qatar, with the notorious and lethal exploitation of migrant workers. The arguments for collaboration are well aired. OMA\u2019s case for working on the CCTV building was that it was good to engage with and encourage the more forward-thinking elements in Chinese society \u2013 and that if they didn\u2019t design the building, some big bland American company would step in and do it anyway. In which case, it would be better to get some remarkable architecture out of the situation than none at all. Architects and other construction professionals can also point to the ways that governments and businesses consort with despots \u2013 how British arms exports help to kill civilians in Yemen, for example, or how British ministers and our ever-obliging man in Riyadh, Neil Crompton, smoothed the way for the Saudi takeover of Newcastle United Football Club. But, if they want to claim any sort of cultural leadership, the people who design buildings could start with their choice of clients.  Lines do get drawn, if hazily. Practices that were happy until this year to work for Putin\u2019s cronies now don\u2019t go near them. The British architect Norman Foster (again a Pritzker winner) withdrew from the advisory board of Neom over the murder of Jamal Khashoggi in 2018, but his practice continues to work on Saudi projects such as the Red Sea airport and an \u201cexperiential marine-life centre\u201d. Some architects will work in China, some won\u2019t. Then, when there is no further room for equivocation, previous positions look weak. When Russia invaded Ukraine, previous attempts at \u201cengagement\u201d looked at best futile. OMA\u2019s relatively enlightened Chinese allies have lost the argument there, and, for all their good intentions, the CCTV headquarters ended up as a dominating and excluding tool of control. There must be a possibility that Saudi Arabia will one day acquire the international pariah status Russia now has (and there is already no moral distinction between them). In which case, why wait? Why not decide now that murder is too high a price to pay for architectural glory? This position might conceivably deprive the world of a few monuments at which tourists of the future might gawp, in which case we should thank the pharaohs and their ilk for previously laying in a good supply of such things. A boycott of projects such as Neom would, more probably, slow the creation of follies that eat energy, belch carbon and make no practical sense. \u2022 Rowan Moore is the Observer\u2019s architecture correspondent \u2022 Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

                    "body": "Ukraine have requested a postponement of their World Cup qualifying play-off semi-final against Scotland as a result of Russia\u2019s invasion of the country. The two nations were due to meet in Glasgow on 24 March, with the winner advancing to play either Wales or Austria for a place at the World Cup in Qatar, which starts in November.  But football has been suspended in Ukraine, where the majority of their nation\u2019s international squad play their club football, and it is now expected that Fifa will grant the request for the play-off at Hampden Park to be put back. \u201cFifa can confirm it has received a request from the Ukrainian Association of Football today to postpone their matches scheduled for March,\u201d said a statement. \u201cFifa remains in regular contact with Uefa and the Scottish Football Association to find an appropriate solution. Fifa expresses its deepest solidarity to everybody affected by what is happening in Ukraine. A further update will be provided in due course.\u201d The Scottish Football Association wrote to its Ukrainian counterpart this week offering support and is willing to accommodate any arrangement that would allow the match to take place. After Russia\u2019s ban from international football was enforced on Monday, it is expected Poland will progress to play Sweden or the Czech Republic on 29 March. The Guardian understands that no alternative mechanism, such as drafting in Hungary or Finland, who narrowly missed out on qualification for the play-offs, is being considered. Poland took a public stand against Fifa when they called for Russia, their play-off semi-final opponents, to be banned. They were yet to receive direct communication from the governing body on Tuesday."

                    "body": "Boris Johnson has described Russian plans to host the 2028 men\u2019s European Championship as \u201cbeyond satire\u201d and recommended the tournament be hosted by Ukraine, despite the UK and Ireland\u2019s joint bid.\nThe prime minister was speaking in Brussels, where he was attending a Nato summit addressing Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. On Wednesday, Russia expressed a declaration of interest in hosting the 2028 or 2032 Euros.\n\n\u201cThe idea of Russia holding any idea of football tournament or any kind of cultural event right now is beyond satire,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that anybody would seriously consider their suggestion and, yes, I think the best thing possible would be for the entire Russian forces to retire forthwith from Ukraine and hand the tournament to them.\u201d\nJohnson had been replying to a direct question over whether it would be better for Ukraine to host the Euros than Russia, but he apparently failed to recall that his own country had bid for the tournament and that he had tweeted in support of it. On Wednesday, a message from Johnson\u2019s official account read: \u201cThe UK and Ireland bid for the Uefa Euro 2028 has this government\u2019s full backing.\n\u201cOur world-class stadiums and passionate fans stand ready to host one of the world\u2019s greatest sporting events. Let\u2019s bring football home.\u201d\nLast year, the government gave \u00a32.8m to UK football associations to explore a bid for the 2030 World Cup, with Johnson vocally supportive of the decision. He was reported to have lobbied the president of Uefa, Aleksander Ceferin, over the bid but the process ended with a decision to apply for the European Championship instead after finding \u201cmany areas of uncertainty\u201d in a World Cup push. Allying with Ireland, the five nations\u2019 bid is the favourite to secure the 2028 tournament.\nJohnson\u2019s official spokesperson sought to row back from the prime minister\u2019s remarks. \u201cHe was making a moral point that aggressors such as Russia should not be given a platform on the international stage,\u201d he said.\n\u201cNever mind the prestige of hosting a world-renowned sporting competition. This suggestion is a brazen and sorely misjudged intervention from Russia given their appalling actions in Ukraine. But clearly, we remain entirely committed to the UK and Ireland bid for Euro 2028, which retains the government\u2019s support.\u201d\n\nPressed on whether Johnson backed the UK and Ireland bid, he insisted he did, urging reporters to \u201clook at the full clip\u201d and arguing that \u201cthe question was posed in the context of Russia being awarded the championship\u201d.\nAsked whether Johnson was even aware of the UK and Ireland bid, he replied: \u201cYes.\u201d\nThe Russian expression of interest was received coldly by Uefa, which warned it could receive further sanctions should a full bid go ahead. Russian teams are banned from Uefa competition at international and club level and Fifa has removed the country from the qualifying process for the World Cup in Qatar."

                    "body": "  10.04pm    Right, that\u2019s all for our live coverage. Here\u2019s Suzanne Wrack\u2019s report from Stadium MK.      10.01pm    Asked what impressed her most about England\u2019s performance, Wiegman highlights the improvement from her attackers in the second half. \u201cI think, first of all, that we played an opponent that played very deep, very compact\u201d she says. \u201cWe expected them a little higher, though we expected them compact, so in the first half that was hard for us. The pitch didn\u2019t help either, it was very hard to play on this pitch. But I think we did really well, especially in the second half, finding space a little better. In the first half we needed more numbers up front, more in their defensive line. I think we did that a lot better in the second half.\u201d     9.56pm    Here\u2019s a question to get a debate going. Thoughts?      9.55pm    Suzanne Wrack was impressed with James\u2019s showing tonight. But, then again, who wasn\u2019t?      9.52pm    Williamson is signing autographs for young fans in the stands, as are several other England players. This evening\u2019s attendance was 21,013.      9.49pm    James is asked whether England can win the tournament for the second year running. \u201cThat\u2019s what the aim is,\u201d she says with a wry smile. \u201cHopefully we can win again but we just have to take each game as it comes.\u201d     9.48pm    In her post-match interview with ITV, James is asked how it felt to score her first senior goal for England. \u201cLost for words,\u201d she says. \u201cAmazing feeling, something I\u2019ve been working towards and I\u2019m thankful today. Lucy gave me a little set up and I put it away \u2026 I\u2019m loving it, I\u2019ve grown into this team and everyone has made me feel welcome so, you know, now I can build on that with confidence.\u201d     9.44pm   Full time, England 4-0 South Korea  It\u2019s the perfect start to the Arnold Clark Cup for England, who have swept away their highest-ranked opponents. South Korea tried to sit deep and soak up the pressure but, ultimately, the Lionesses were unstoppable. They passed the ball at pace, interchanged nicely in attack and showed the flexibility and fluidity which their opponents markedly lacked. James was the star, but Wiegman will be pleased with the entire side.     9.40pm    90+2 min Hemp thunders forwards on the left but is denied by a sliding tackle from Kim Hye-ri. At the ensuing corner, Bronze has a shot cleared off the line by Jang.     9.36pm    88 min Off the post! South Korea go to pieces at the back and Kim Jung-mi spills the ball into Robinson\u2019s path, but she hits the upright with the goal at her mercy.     9.35pm    87 min Robinson gets a low cross into the box from the right, but Kim Jung-mi gets down low to stop it finding the boot of an England teammate.     9.33pm    86 min Son and Hong Hye-ji come off for Chun Ga-ram and Jang Yu-bin.     9.31pm    84 min Kim Jung-mi is booked for timewasting. It says a lot about the game that South Korea are trying to run down the clock at 4-0 down.     9.29pm    82 min South Korea fail to clear another corner and the ball falls for Williamson, who shoots straight at Kim Jung-mi.     9.28pm    80 min James has more than done her bit and comes off for Katie Robinson. Player of the match, for sure.     9.25pm   GOAL! England 4-0 South Korea (James 78)  What was that about England\u2019s pace dropping off? Toone drives forwards in midfield and plays in Bronze to her right. She is tackled but the ball falls kindly for James, who leaves the back of the net bulging. It\u2019s the least she deserves after a top performance.   Updated at 10.13pm GMT    9.24pm    75 min Coombs tries to flick a ball over the top, but South Korea defend it well. England\u2019s pace has dropped off a little, whether because of the substitutions or simply because they\u2019re so comfortable.     9.20pm    72 min Daly has a decent chance after getting in behind, but can\u2019t quite tuck it away.     9.18pm    70 min England win a corner and Hemp\u2019s delivery is cleared as far as James. She gets a shot off, but it\u2019s deflected and ricochets harmlessly away.     9.16pm    68 min England make a rare mistake and gift Son a chance to shoot, but it\u2019s high and wide.   Updated at 10.15pm GMT    9.15pm    66 min Wiegman makes another substitution, Coombs coming on for Stanway. As a reminder, this will be her first appearance for the Lionesses in eight years.  Updated at 9.22pm GMT    9.13pm    65 min Zelem is the latest England player to try her luck from distance, sending a shot bouncing just wide.     9.12pm    62 min England execute a clever corner routine to the letter and, having received the ball unmarked in the middle of the box, Stanway hits the crossbar! This could be a rout if South Korea aren\u2019t careful. Wiegman makes a triple change, bringing off Kelly, Greenwood and Russo for Lauren Hemp, Niamh Charles and Rachel Daly respectively.  Updated at 9.19pm GMT    9.09pm    61 min Kelly has a speculative shot from a tight angle, but it swishes wide of the far post.  Updated at 9.13pm GMT    9.06pm    58 min A mix-up in South Korea\u2019s box almost costs them another goal, but they just about manage to scramble the ball clear.     9.05pm    56 min South Korea\u2019s free kick comes to nothing. England break via James, who is dragged back by Jang at the cost of a yellow card.  Updated at 9.05pm GMT    9.04pm    55 min Stanway gives away a free kick in a dangerous position after catching Kim Yun-ji. The South Korea midfielder leaves the field almost immediately, making way for Park Ye-eun. It\u2019s a double substitution from Bell, with Kang Chae-rim also departing. She is replaced by Shim Seo-yeon.  Updated at 9.09pm GMT    9.00pm    52 min James breaks forwards once again but catches Lim Seon-joo across the ankles after the South Korea defender comes across and gets in front of her. The visitors get a free kick but it doesn\u2019t relieve the pressure for long, Stanway going for goal from range only for Kim Jung-mi to make the save.  Updated at 9.01pm GMT    8.56pm   GOAL! England 3-0 South Korea (Russo 50)  James gets to the byline and scoops a cross to the far post, but it\u2019s a little overhit. Greenwood gathers out wide on the left and gets the ball back into the danger area. Russo is there to thrash in at the near post. That should do it.   Updated at 10.13pm GMT    8.53pm   GOAL! England 2-0 South Korea (Kelly 46)  Well, that\u2019s not a bad way to restart the game. Toone chases the ball out wide on the left and, after the visitors get in a defensive muddle, it breaks for Kelly. She drives forwards and has a crack from the edge of the area. The shot takes a wicked deflection and loops up into the back of the net.   Updated at 10.18pm GMT    8.51pm   Second half kicks off  We\u2019re back in action at Stadium MK. Can the Lionesses extend their lead, or will South Korea turn it around? There\u2019s only one way to find out. In the meantime, Wiegman has made a half-time change with Carter swapping out for Katie Zelem.     8.43pm    James was, without doubt, the outstanding player for England in the first half. There weren\u2019t many eye-catching performances from the visitors, though Choo was particularly impressive in defence and was one of their few outlets in attack.  Updated at 8.43pm GMT    8.38pm   Half-time, England 1-0 South Korea  South Korea emerge blinking into the light after so long turtled up, but struggle to assert themselves before the half-time whistle goes. England have the game just where they want it, with the visitors now obliged to drop their ultra-defensive stance. There should be more space to attack in the second half, which can only benefit Wiegman\u2019s side. The hosts have played some really nice attacking football and, if they sharpen up their finishing, they could win this handily.  Updated at 8.44pm GMT    8.32pm    45 min There\u2019ll be three minutes of added time at the end of the first half. Can England get another?     8.31pm    43 min A short-corner routine ends with Kelly taking a pot shot from just outside the area, but it\u2019s far too close to the keeper.     8.30pm   GOAL! England 1-0 South Korea (Stanway 40 pen)  Stanway makes no mistake, thundering her spot kick well beyond Kim Jung-mi\u2019s reach. England deservedly lead. South Korea have little choice but to come out of their shell. This game could get very interesting.   Updated at 8.32pm GMT    8.27pm   Penalty to England!  James goes down after another lung-busting run ends with her being clipped across the ankles by Jang Sel-gi and England have a spot kick. Stanway will be the one to take it.   Updated at 8.32pm GMT    8.25pm    37 min Off the inside of the post! James charges through and tees up Russo, who smashes the upright only for the ball to spin away off the line.     8.24pm    35 min England win the ball in midfield after an energetic team press. Bronze gets down the right and tries to play in James, but she\u2019s dispossessed. Bronze wins a 50-50 with Lee Geum-min, but her opponent hurts herself in the process and there\u2019s a break in play. Lee looks to have tweaked her shoulder and it\u2019s unclear whether or not she\u2019ll be able to carry on.  Updated at 10.24pm GMT    8.21pm    32 min Jess Carter wins the ball fairly in a shoulder-to-shoulder with Son but, much to her frustration, it\u2019s given as a foul. South Korea squander their free kick, allowing Earps to sweep up with ease.     8.18pm    31 min Millie Bright decides she\u2019s had enough with niceties and takes a thumping shot from distance, but it hurtles wide.     8.17pm    30 min So close! England win a corner, Greenwood steps up and Stanway gets under it, but her header whistles just over the crossbar and nestles on the roof of the net.   Updated at 8.33pm GMT    8.16pm    28 min Alex Greenwood comes forwards in support and almost gets in behind on the left, but Choo launches into an excellent tackle before winning a foul as the pair tussle for the loose ball.     8.15pm    25 min Another short, sharp passing move ends with Kelly taking a shot which skews well wide. England are moving the ball much faster than their opponents and continue to create overlaps despite South Korea\u2019s massed defence.     8.11pm    22 min James makes a darting run past several defenders, bursting into the box before unleashing a shot. It takes a slight deflection which sucks the sting out of it, allowing Kim Jung-mi to get down low and make a bobbling save.     8.09pm    18 min While the visitors are keeping it compact, they look tactically static \u2013 almost frozen in place \u2013 while England, by contrast, look dynamic and aggressive. Bronze is the latest to get a shot away, but it rises over the crossbar.     8.05pm    17 min Close! Kelly tees up Lucy Bronze for a cross from deep, which falls for James at the far post. She can\u2019t quite guide it home, however, leaving South Korea to breathe a sigh of relief.     8.03pm    15 min Good save! Kelly, Georgia Stanway and Toone combine in the box before the latter unleashes a shot from a tight angle which Kim Jung-mi pushes round the post.     8.02pm    13 min England players buzz around the visitors\u2019 box, but struggle to find a way through. James gets the ball out on the right and flashes a shot towards the near post but Kim Jung-mi, South Korea\u2019s goalkeeper, palms it away.  Updated at 8.03pm GMT    8.00pm    10 min James gets a good cross in from the right, but it\u2019s cleared. England come forwards again and Toone flicks one round the corner for Chloe Kelly, but she is crowded out by a converging mass of red shirts. South Korea look solid in a highly defensive 5-4-1 setup, clearly intending to hit the Lionesses on the counter-attack. It\u2019s up to the hosts to find a way to break them down now.   Updated at 10.26pm GMT    7.56pm    8 min Son Hwa-yeon gets the first booking of the game after catching Williamson on the ankle with a high boot. The England captain dusts herself off, looking unruffled.  Updated at 8.20pm GMT    7.52pm     5 min Ella Toone lines one up from distance, but it sails well wide.     7.52pm    4 min The visitors come straight back at England via Choo Hyo-joo, their right wing-back. She makes inroads down the right flank before cutting inside and whipping a shot on target, but Mary Earps is equal to it.  Updated at 7.54pm GMT    7.50pm    2 min Lauren James gets the first chance of the match after a nice passing move, thrashing a shot just wide from the edge of the area.   Updated at 8.18pm GMT    7.49pm   Kick off!  England get things going, Alessia Russo doing the honours. The hosts get forwards immediately, pushing and probing South Korea\u2019s back five.     7.41pm    The two sides are out on the pitch and the anthems are in progress. Let\u2019s get started, shall we?      7.40pm    England players will also wear black armbands this evening, commemorating Beth Mead\u2019s mum, June, who died last month, and the victims of the Turkey and Syria earthquakes.      7.36pm    Earlier this week, Williamson expressed her desire to wear the OneLove armband at this summer\u2019s World Cup regardless of Fifa\u2019s intervention against the gesture during the men\u2019s tournament in Qatar. \u201cWe\u2019re never shy in saying what we stand for, we\u2019re a squad that promotes inclusivity and equality,\u201d she said. \u201cWe obviously have a number of people that feel very strongly about it.\u201d Here\u2019s Suzanne Wrack with the full story.      7.20pm    Colin Bell, the Leicester-born South Korea manager, has also been speaking to ITV. \u201cObviously, very enjoyable,\u201d he says, when asked how it feels to be back in England. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time since 2019, so it\u2019s four years. I\u2019ve been able to catch up with my family, which is very nice, and a lot of my family are here this evening.\u201d He, too, is asked what he\u2019s hoping to take from this game. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough, we\u2019re playing against the best team in the world this evening in my opinion. Our players are all off-season so it\u2019s going to be a big challenge, but I think we can learn from all three teams.\u201d     7.15pm   South Korea team news  Starting line-up: Kim Jung-mi, Choo Hyo-joo, Hong Hye-ji, Lim Seon-joo, Son Hwa-yeon, Kim Yun-ji, Choe Yu-ri, Kang Chae-rim, Lee Geum-min, Jang Sel-gi, Kim Hye-ri.   Updated at 8.01pm GMT    7.08pm    Speaking to ITV before the match, Wiegman is asked what she hopes to learn from taking on South Korea. \u201cA lot about our players and where they are at this moment,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ll try some combination of players in these three matches and then we get, hopefully, a lot of information about the team and about the individuals, and where we are now, to move forward and get ready for [the start of the Women\u2019s World Cup in] July.\u201d      7.02pm    Williamson, as a local legend, got the loudest reception as the Lionesses arrived at Stadium MK. She was given the freedom of Milton Keynes after winning Euro 2022 and, speaking to the BBC about returning to her hometown, she said: \u201cObviously my family will be there, it\u2019s an important time to be with them as well. It\u2019s a sort of full circle \u2026 it\u2019s one of those moments where you just sort of think it\u2019s probably a good time for reflection and to appreciate.\u201d      6.50pm   England team news  Starting line-up: Earps, Bronze, Greenwood, Bright, Williamson, Kelly, Stanway, Russo, Toone, Carter, James.      6.46pm    While Beth Mead is a long-term absentee after rupturing her anterior cruciate ligament and Fran Kirby has withdrawn from the England squad with a knee injury, Wiegman has Leah Williamson available once more after she was ruled out of October and November\u2019s fixtures. Meanwhile Laura Coombs, the Manchester City midfielder, has received a call-up eight years after the second of her two caps in 2015 and is, understandably, delighted.   Updated at 7.28pm GMT    6.45pm   Preamble  A year after England won the inaugural tournament, confirming their status as champions with victory against Germany in a portent of their Euro 2022 triumph, the Arnold Clark Cup is back and Arnold Clarkier than ever. Where, last time round, Germany, Canada and Spain were the invited teams, this time the Lionesses will go up against three new participants in South Korea, Italy and Belgium. While the tournament is already under way \u2013 Le Azzurre lost 2-1 to Belgium\u2019s Red Flames in the day\u2019s early kick off at Stadium MK \u2013 South Korea are first up for Sarina Wiegman\u2019s side. They are currently ranked 15th in the world, two places ahead of Italy and five ahead of Belgium, making this a challenging opening fixture for the hosts, who are nonetheless unbeaten in 26 games going back to April 2021.

Goodnight!\n\n\n\n\n 9.10pm  \n\n\u201cBefore the match, had you told me that France would take the lead in the first five minutes, I would have despaired at how watchable the game would be,\u201d says Eric Peterson. \u201cHow wrong I was. Morocco didn\u2019t just keep France honest, they asked questions aplenty. \n\u201cHere\u2019s hoping the step from disappointment at the loss to appreciation of what they\u2019ve accomplished happens as soon as possible for the Atlas Lions. They deserve it. As for France v Argentina, well, that should be somewhat watchable, huh?\u201d\n\n\n\n 9.08pm  \n\n\u201cGriezmann has been the player of the tournament, I agree,\u201d says K\u00e1ri Tulinius. \u201cWhat\u2019s most remarkable about that is that he\u2019s playing a role he\u2019s never performed before, in a position he\u2019s never played in. He may have ensured his place on a very short list of all-time greats.\u201d\nIt\u2019s really interesting, because he\u2019s playing as a No8 while retaining elements of a No10. And his defensive awareness is extraordinary.\n\n\nUpdated at 9.11pm GMT\n\n\n 9.03pm  \n\n\u201cGriezmann MoTM?\u201d says Brad Wilson. \u201cI say yes.\u201d\nYep. I\u2019d argue he\u2019s the player of the tournament, in that he has influenced the nuts and bolts of games a lot more than Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappe. Then again, those two have a helluva highlights package. Apples and oranges I guess. \n\nUpdated at 9.05pm GMT\n\n\n 9.00pm  \n\nArgentina v France, then. Messi v Mbappe. Ten others v ten others. \nThe two teams met in the second round of the last World Cup, when France came from behind to win a seven-goal thriller.\n\n\nUpdated at 9.14pm GMT\n\n\n 8.58pm  \n\nWalid Regragui is embraced by Olivier Giroud, his old Grenoble teammate, and then Didier Deschamps. There are some tears, but not devastation \u2013 the Morocco players, in the parlance of our time, left everything out there, and their primary emotion should be pride. They have joined the list of World Cup immortals.\n\nUpdated at 9.09pm GMT\n\n\n 8.55pm  \nFull time: France 2-0 Morocco\n\nFrance will play Argentina in the World Cup final after a hard-fought victory over Morocco. Theo Hernandez\u2019s early goal changed the pattern of the game, with Morocco dominating possession for the first time in the tournament. Both teams hit the post, both missed excellent chances, and there were plenty of nervous moments for France before the substitute Randal Kolo Muani scored with his first touch in the 79th minute.\nFrance did enough, as they have throughout the tournament really. They are one game away from making history; Morocco have already done that.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 9.17pm GMT\n\n\n 8.55pm  \n\n90+4 min: How did that stay out?! After a great run from Ezzalzouli on the left, Ounahi\u2019s volley was half blocked by Hernandez. It ricocheted to Hamdallah, whose instinctive close-range shot was blocked on the line by Kounde.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.57pm GMT\n\n\n 8.53pm  \n\n90+3 min The tireless Ounahi\u2019s shot deflects over the bar. Ziyech takes the corner short to Amrabat, whose cross is headed away.\n\n\n\n 8.52pm  \n\n90+2 min Mbappe nutmegs Amrabat and then surges away from Dari on the edge of the area, but Hakimi tracks him and makes a fine challenge.\n\n\n\n 8.50pm  \n\n90+1 min There will be six minutes of added time. \n\n\n\n 8.50pm  \n\n90 min Aboukhlal\u2019s shot on the turn is saved by Lloris, though it wouldn\u2019t have counted as he was offside. \n\n\n\n 8.46pm  \n\n86 min Ziyech tries to twist inside Thuram, who stands up and wins a goalkick.\n\n\n\n 8.44pm  \n\n84 min Marcus Thuram played a part in that goal, too, drawing defenders towards him before giving the ball to Mbappe. He\u2019s been outstanding, and not just with the ball \u2013 Morocco have had very little joy down their right since he came on.\n\n\n\n 8.42pm  \n\n81 min In years to come, folk will look at the scoreline and think it was a game too far for Morocco, that France won easily, like the favourites always do against the underdog in a World Cup semi-final. That hasn\u2019t been the case at all.\n\n\n\n 8.40pm  \n\nThe Morocco fairytale is over, but Randal Kolo Muani has a little fairytale of his own. It was made by Mbappe, who zig-zagged thrillingly between two players on the edge of the penalty box. His shot hit Ezzalzouli, who has also just come on, and ricocheted across the area to give Kolo Muani an open goal.\n\n\n\n 8.39pm  \nGOAL! France 2-0 Morocco (Kolo Muani 79)\n\nRandal Kolo Muani scores with his first touch!\n\n\n\n\nUpdated at 8.45pm GMT\n\n\n 8.38pm  \n\n79 min: France substitution Randal Kolo Muani comes for Ousmane Dembele, who had a quiet game.\n\n\n\n 8.37pm  \n\n78 min: Morocco substitution Abde Ezzalzouli replaces Selim Amallah, who came on as a substitute in the first half.\n\n\n\n 8.36pm  \n\n76 min: Chance for Morocco! Tchouameni loses the ball in a dangerous area, and it\u2019s collected by Hamdallah. He surges into the area, wriggles past two defenders \u2013 but then tries to come back inside onto his right foot and is tackled! Why didn\u2019t he shoot with his left? He was only eight yards from goal.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.39pm GMT\n\n\n 8.34pm  \n\n75 min Griezmann wins another loose ball on the edge of the France area and is fouled. He has the defensive anticipation of somebody who has spent the last 10 years watching videos of Claude Makelele.\n\n\n\n 8.33pm  \n\n74 min Fofana finds Thuram on the left. He gives the ball back to Fofana, who splashes wide from a tight angle. Thuram has been really good.\n\n\n\n 8.33pm  \n\n74 min France are looking more comfortable now. We know 1-0 is a dangerous lead, almost as dangerous as 2-0, but it doesn\u2019t feel as fraught as it did 10 or 15 minutes ago.\n\n\n\n 8.32pm  \n\n72 min Griezmann nicks another ball in midfield and then draws a foul to buy France some time. He\u2019s been so good with and without the ball, tonight and throughout the tournament.\n\n\n\n 8.31pm  \n\n71 min: Chance for France! Griezmann\u2019s teasing free-kick is headed just wide by Thuram at the far post. That was a really good chance, though he was under a bit of pressure from a defender.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.35pm GMT\n\n\n 8.30pm  \n\n70 min Dari is lucky to avoid a yellwo card for shoving over Thuram, who has looked really lively since coming on.\n\nUpdated at 8.30pm GMT\n\n\n 8.29pm  \n\n69 min Griezmann\u2019s free-kick flashes across the face of goal. France reclaim possession and Mbappe has a fierce shot blocked, though the flag went up subsequently for offside.\n\n\n\n 8.27pm  \n\n68 min Hakimi commits a needless foul on Thuram near the corner flag\u2026\n\n\n\n 8.27pm  \n\n67 min Attiat-Allah\u2019s lofted cross just evades the leaping Aboukhlal at the near post before being claimed by Lloris. I think it would have been offside anyway.\n\n\n\n 8.26pm  \n\n66 min: Double substitution for Morocco Zakaria Aboukhlal and Abderrazak Hamdallah replaces Boufal and En-Nesyri.\n\n\n\n 8.25pm  \n\n65 min: France substitution Marcus Thuram, whose dad Lilian scored twice in the 1998 semi-final, replaces Olivier Giroud. Mbappe is now playing up front.\n\n\n\n 8.22pm  \n\n63 min Boufal does superbly to get to the byline on the right, but his cutback is cleared by\u2026 Griezmann again. He\u2019s having some tournament.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.27pm GMT\n\n\n 8.21pm  \n\n61 min France have barely crossed the halfway line in the second half. They\u2019re either asking for trouble or managing the game cleverly, and I\u2019ll tell you which one in about half an hour\u2019s time.\n\n\n\n 8.19pm  \n\n60 min Griezmann\u2019s long-range shot deflects wide, though everybody knew Mbappe was offside earlier in the move.\n\n\n\n 8.18pm  \n\n59 min Mbappe is limping slightly after a couple of heavy challenges, and Marcus Thuram is warming up.\n\n\n\n 8.17pm  \n\n56 min After more intricate build-up play on the right, Ounahi\u2019s cross almost falls for Hakimi in front of goal. It would have done but for good anticipation by Griezmann on the six-yard line.\nHernandez is being overwhelmed on that side of the field.\n\n\n\n 8.15pm  \n\n55 min Morocco are looking really dangerous, particularly down their right.\n\n\n\n 8.14pm  \n\n54 min: Chances plural for Morocco! Boufal\u2019s dangerous cross from the right just evades En-Nesyri at the near post and comes to Attiatt-Allah, who can\u2019t control his shot as the ball kicks up a little awkwardly. Moments later Attiat-Allah finds a bit of space on the left side of the area and tries to pick out En-Nesyri in front of an open goal. Konate, again, does extremely well to get in front and clear.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.25pm GMT\n\n\n 8.12pm  \n\n52 min Mbappe is back on his feet after receiving treatment. I think it was a fair challenge from Amrabat; it was certainly a strong one.\n\nUpdated at 8.12pm GMT\n\n\n 8.11pm  \n\n51 min Ziyech plays a beautiful one-two-three with Hakimi, whose cross is well blocked at the near post by Konate. France break through Mbappe, who is sent flying by an emphatic man-and-ball challenge from Amrabat just outside the area. The referee waves play on.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.14pm GMT\n\n\n 8.10pm  \n\n50 min Ziyech\u2019s cross is cleared at the near post by Konate. He\u2019s quietly had a good game.\n\n\n\n 8.08pm  \n\n48 min Griezmann, arguably the player of the tournament, uses Giroud by not using him and slides a lovely ball towards Mbappe on the edge of the area. Hakimi tracks him well and Bono jumps from his line to claim.\n\n\n\n 8.07pm  \n\n47 min Mbappe roasts Hakimi and Amrabat on the left, gets to the byline but then overhits his cross.\n\n\n\n 8.06pm  \n\n47 min \u201cI really can\u2019t understand why more isn\u2019t being made of that decision to penalise Boufal when Hernandez took him out,\u201d says Sam Campbell. \u201cWe are constantly told getting the ball is irrelevant these days and Hernandez goes through him on the follow through. In my opinion that\u2019s a far worse decision than any that England didn\u2019t get at the weekend.\u201d\nI don\u2019t think getting the ball is irrelevant; it depends on the context. In this case I think the fact he won the ball and pushed it away from Boufal made it just about a fair tackle. That said, Rio Ferdinand thought it should have been a penalty for Morocco.\n\n\n\n\n 8.05pm  \n\n46 min Peep peep!\n\n\n\n 8.05pm  \n\nMorocco substitution Yet another injury for Morocco. Yahya Attiat-Allah has replaced Noussair Mazraoui.\n\n\n\n 8.03pm  \n\n\u201cThe football\u2019s kind of interesting,\u201d writes Douglas. \u201cAbsolutely no one, whatsoever, is interested in any way, whatsoever, with emails you\u2019ve received criticising your content.\u201d\n\n\n\n 8.00pm  \n\n\u201cI think Morocco have looked very lively since they conceded,\u201d says Alexandra Ashton. \u201cWouldn\u2019t be too surprised if they nick one in the second half, and after that, who knows\u2026 An African side in the World Cup final would be something to behold, and I will never count this Morocco side out. They\u2019re stellar.\u201d \n\n\n\n 7.56pm  \n\n\u201cSomeone on the planet,\u201d says David Neilson, \u201cshould mention that Mbappe was surrounded by seven Morocco players when he hit that shot that led to the Hernandez goal.\u201d\n\n\n\n 7.53pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 7.52pm  \n\n\u201cIf you posted the players\u2019 names from each team in a different font (or just italics vs caps) it would be much easier to follow for the probable majority who do not know the names of all the players,\u201d says Michael Daley. \u201cPS I agree about updating lineups with substitutions...\u201d\n\n\n\n 7.50pm  \n\nHalf-time reading\n\n\n\n\n 7.49pm  \nHalf time: France 1-0 Morocco\n\nPeep peep! France lead through Theo Hernandez\u2019s early goal, but Morocco played an equal part in a thrilling and surprisingly open first half. Both teams have hit the post, and Hugo Lloris has probably been the busier keeper. See you in 10 minutes for the second half.\n\n\n\n 7.47pm  \n\n45 min Three minutes of added time.\n\n\n\n 7.47pm  \n\n44 min: El Yamiq hits the post! What a goal that would have been. Ziyech\u2019s inswinging corner was headed away by Giroud towards the end of the area, where El Yamiq launched himself into a slightly inelegant but spectacular overhead kick. Lloris flew to his right and got the slightest touch to push the ball onto the post. That\u2019s a helluva save.\n\n\nUpdated at 7.48pm GMT\n\n\n 7.44pm  \n\n44 min Ounahi plays an excellent return ball to Hakimi in the area, but his low cross is superbly blocked by the sliding Konate. Corner to Morocco\u2026\n\n\n\n 7.43pm  \n\n42 min Morocco have had 55 per cent of the possession, which I think is their highest in this tournament. It\u2019s also the first time they\u2019ve been behind in the tournament.\n\n\n\n 7.41pm  \n\n41 min \u201cYour match stats do not show who has been substituted in the starting line up,\u201d writes Nicklas Nilsson. \u201cRoom for improvement...\u201d\nHaven\u2019t we all.\n\n\n\n 7.41pm  \n\n40 min Griezmann\u2019s corner is flicked wide by Varane in front of the near post. A quarter chance at best.\n\n\n\n 7.39pm  \n\n38 min This is a decent spell for France, who know that a second goal before half-time would probably finish Morocco off.\n\n\n\n 7.38pm  \n\n36 min: Great chances for Mbappe and Giroud! France should be 2-0 up. Tchouameni threaded a superb ball inside Hakimi to find Mbappe in the area. He screwed a shot past Bono that was kicked away by El Yamiq, though it wasn\u2019t going in anyway as Mbappe had been knocked slightly off balance by Hakimi. France regained possession, and a few seconds later Giroud curled a first-time shot wide from about 12 yards. He should have scored.\n\n\nUpdated at 7.40pm GMT\n\n\n 7.35pm  \n\n34 min Griezmann\u2019s corner hits a couple of players and bounces away from goal towards Fofana, who hooks a shot on the turn high and wide. Wasn\u2019t much of a chance.\n\n\n\n 7.33pm  \n\n33 min Tchouameni pings a long-range drive that is blocked by \u2026 Giroud. \n\n\n\n 7.30pm  \n\n 29 min Giroud, who has been really good so far, nicks the ball off Amrabat in midfield before being fouled by Amallah.\n\n\n\n 7.28pm  \n\n27 min Boufal is booked for a foul on Theo Hernandez in the France area. It\u2019s a good job Hernandez got a touch on the ball because he then wiped out Boufal in his follow through.\n\n\nUpdated at 7.31pm GMT\n\n\n 7.26pm  \n\n26 min The scoreline means Morocco are having a lot of the ball, more than in most games at this tournament, and they are playing with plenty of attacking optimism. Hakimi hits a stinging shot from 22 yards that is blocked by Konate.\n\n\n\n 7.26pm  \n\n24 min I\u2019m now being told, via my inbox, that making a joke about old people living in fear of cancel culture is racist. How that works, I don\u2019t know, but I think I might watch the football for a bit instead of trying to incorporate emails in this blog.\n\n\n\n 7.23pm  \n\n22 min So Morocco have lost both Saiss and Aguerd since they announced the team a couple of hours ago. If they do lose, they\u2019ll always wonder what might have been with a fully fit defence. Then again, France can say the same about Rabiot and Upamecano, not to mention Benzema, Pogba, Kante and the rest.\n\n\n\n 7.21pm  \n\n21 min Selim Amallah replaces poor Saiss, which probably means a switch to 4-3-3. Saiss gives the armband to Hakim Ziyech.\n\nUpdated at 7.21pm GMT\n\n\n 7.19pm  \n\n19 min It looks like the Moroccan captain Romain Saiss is going off. That\u2019s really sad, though not entirely surprising given the hamstring injury he suffered on Saturday.\n\n\nUpdated at 7.23pm GMT\n\n\n 7.18pm  \n\n17 min: Giroud hits the post! A long ball from the back beats Saiss, who doesn\u2019t look fit, and reaches Giroud. He smashes a half-volley that swirls away from Bono and thumps the outside of the post.\n\n\nUpdated at 7.20pm GMT\n\n\n 7.18pm  \n\n17 min Another promising break from Morocco. Boufal scoots away from a couple of players in midfield and angles a pass to Ziyech on the right side of the area. He takes a touch but shoots tamely wide on the stretch.\n\n\n\n 7.16pm  \n\n15 min The goal aside, Morocco have started really well. It will annoy them that the goal was so avoidable; there was no need for El Yamiq to try to win the ball in front of Griezmann, especially when there was so much space behind him.\n\n\n\n 7.14pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 7.11pm  \n\n11 min: Good save by Lloris! Morocco have responded really well to going behind. Ounahi sidefoots a wobbling shot from 25 yards that is well saved by Lloris, diving a long way to his left.\n\nUpdated at 7.12pm GMT\n\n\n 7.10pm  \n\n9 min The defender on the line, Dari I think, had a chance to block Hernandez\u2019s shot but seemed to panic and kicked under the ball. I\u2019d like to see it again to be sure but it looked\u2026 if not a howler, then at least a missed opportunity.\n\n\n\n 7.09pm  \n\n8 min \u201cAdmitting that you don\u2019t know enough about a topic to comment is intelligent, but you undid that with the silly \u2018cancelled\u2019 joke, which implies that you are critical of negative responses to bigotry,\u201d writes Michael S Weller. \u201cYou didn\u2019t mean to imply that, I\u2019m sure, but that\u2019s how your joke comes across. A simple test: were you going to say something racist or xenophobic? If not, then you won\u2019t be \u2018cancelled\u2019. It\u2019s really easy not to be \u2018cancelled\u2019: don\u2019t say bigoted things.\u201d\nThat\u2019s the last time I crack a joke on the internet.\n\nUpdated at 7.15pm GMT\n\n\n 7.07pm  \n\nTheo Hernandez, who had such a stinker against England, is now France\u2019s hero. Griezmann slipped El Yamiq, who committed himself unnecessarily, in the inside-right channel and passed low towards Mbappe. He had one shot blocked, then another, but the ball ricocheted towards Hernandez beyond the far post. He did really well to get over the top of the bouncing ball \u2013 which was well above waist height - and crack it past both Bono and the defender on the line.\n\nUpdated at 7.14pm GMT\n\n\n 7.06pm  \nGOAL! France 1-0 Morocco (T Hernandez 5)\n\nMorocco are behind for the first time in the tournament!\n\n\n\nUpdated at 8.24pm GMT\n\n\n 7.05pm  \n\n4 min A slow start, with both teams feeling their way into the game. Every French touch is being whistled.\n\n\n\n 7.03pm  \n\n2 min Hang on, Nayef Aguerd has pulled out after the warm-up. Achraf Dari is playing instead.\n\n\nUpdated at 7.06pm GMT\n\n\n 7.01pm  \n\n1 min Peep peep! The first World Cup semi-final involving an African team is officially under way.\n\n\n\n 7.00pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 6.55pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 6.51pm  \n\nRight, I\u2019m away to grab a drink. See you in a few minutes for France v Morocco in the World Cup semi-final.\n\n\n\n 6.50pm  \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s peeing down here in Essaouira,\u201d writes David (a different one). \u201cGood news for the cafes.\u201d\n\n\n\n 6.49pm  \n\n\u201cI also disagree with Charles,\u201d writes David. \u201cI think there\u2019s something genuinely amazing about an underdog team that is so tactically shrewd. When games are goalless, they pile bodies forward on the counterattack and their wingers are technically so good: crisp one-twos and mazy dribbling all the way. Then when they go ahead they all sit deep for the rest of the game, defend doggedly and ride their luck when they have to. Brilliant tournament football for me!\u201d\nIs their approach really that different from Argentina\u2019s? If they get through, that might be the first World Cup final in which neither team wants to dominate possession.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 6.52pm GMT\n\n\n 6.47pm  \n\nA reminder of the teams\nFrance (4-2-3-1ish) Lloris; Kounde, Varane, Konate, T Hernandez; Tchouameni, Fofana; Dembele, Griezmann, Mbappe; Giroud.Substitutes: Pavard, Disasi, Guendouzi, Kolo Muani, Veretout, Mandanda, Saliba, Upamecano, Coman, Areola, Camavinga, Thuram.\nMorocco (5-2-3) Bono; Hakimi, El Yamiq, Aguerd, Saiss, Mazraoui; Amrabat, Ounahi; Ziyech, En-Nesyri, Boufal.Substitutes: Hamdallah, Zaroury, Sabiri, El Kajoui, Chair, Aboukhlal, Amallah, Ezzalzouli, Dari, Tagnaouti, El Khannouss, Benoun, Attiat-Allah, Jabrane.\nReferee Cesar Arturo Ramos Palazuelos (Mexico)\n\n\n\n 6.47pm  \n\n\u201cLet\u2019s face it, Morocco will almost certainly lose today,\u201d says Gregory Phillips. \u201cBut these moments before the game are like spending a quid on a lottery ticket; it\u2019s permission to dream about the what if. Instead of a creditable run to the semis, right now Morocco are potential world champions. Breathe it in while you can, because reality won\u2019t taste half as good.\u201d\n\n\n\n 6.43pm  \n\n\u201cNot so sure Sweden were shock finalists in 1958,\u201d says Andreas Broman. \u201cThe won the 1948 Olympic gold, were bronze medalists in 1950 and included Serie A greats like Nils Liedholm, Gunnar Gren, Nacka Skoglund and Kurt Hamrin. They also played at home.\u201d\nFair points, one and all. I suppose the last shock finalists (unless you count Croatia) were Czechoslovakia in 1962. Either way, I do think the point stands \u2013 in the modern era, a lot of underdogs have gone quietly in the semi-final of the World Cup. Poland in 1982, Belgium in 1986, Sweden and Bulgaria in 1994, Turkey and South Korea in 2002, England in 2018.\n\nUpdated at 6.45pm GMT\n\n\n 6.39pm  \n\nIt\u2019s 40 years since France played in the greatest World Cup semi-final of all\n\n\n\n\n 6.34pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 6.34pm  \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll buck the trend and come out in support of Charles Antaki here,\u201d says David Zepeda. \u201cI won\u2019t let the feelgood underdog vibes sway me. Morocco defending all day and counter-attacking and generally looking like Greece 2004 2.0 might be effective, but it\u2019s excruciating to watch. Just because they can use this strategy doesn\u2019t mean they should. Morocco have scored five goals all tournament. Not exactly turning on the style.\u201d\n\n\n\n 6.32pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 6.28pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 6.28pm  \n\n\u201cSetting aside catenaccio and whether the perfect game of football ends 0-0, it does seem like the evergreen theory still and always applies: you won\u2019t lose if you don\u2019t concede, though you can\u2019t win if you don\u2019t score,\u201d says Matt Burtz. \u201cIn league football, that might only get you draws. In tournament football, however, sometimes you can win the whole darn thing (if you\u2019re good at penalties, anyway). As we say here in the U.S. regarding championships, flags fly forever, and it doesn\u2019t matter how you get there.\u201d\nI blame Pep Guardiola for turning all into mad, entitled idealists.\n\n\n\n 6.24pm  \n\n \u201cCompletely disagree with Charles Antaki, Rob,\u201d says Jimmy Ainsworth. \u201cMorocco don\u2019t play tiki-taka but they do play out from the back and some of their counter attacking play has been marvellous. It is nowhere near unappealing - Poland v Argentina was the most pathetic performance I\u2019ve seen all tournament, and Holland weren\u2019t much better against the Argentina either (save the last 15 minutes of Woutball) - Maroc were streets ahead of both.\u201d\n\n\n\n 6.22pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 6.22pm  \n\n\u201cGreetings from Virginia, Rob,\u201d writes Eagle Brosi. \u201cI have the suspicion that you\u2019re cursed. Every time you do an MBM it seems that the team you are supporting loses. Am I completely off my rocker for thinking this or are living out some sort of Biblical punishment? Either way, can you share who you\u2019re rooting for?\u201d\nScotland, as I have throughout the tournament. (I haven\u2019t really been supporting anyone, though I suppose I wouldn\u2019t have minded seeing Louis van Gaal win the World Cup playing Total Longball.)\n\n\n\n 6.20pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 6.20pm  \n\nGrinch department\nCameroon legend and occasional brawler Samuel Eto\u2019o predicted a France v Morocco semi-final, which surely makes him the best soothsayer since Biff Tannen? Well, yes, until you realise his prediction for the other semi-final was \u2026 Cameroon v Senegal.\n\n\n\n 6.17pm  \n\nWILL IT BE A BEAUTIFUL DAY\n\n\n\n\n 6.14pm  \n\nThe France players jog out to warm up, and are greeted with whistles and jeers. The crowd \u2013 around 90 per cent Moroccan \u2013 will surely be a factor tonight.\n\n\nUpdated at 6.18pm GMT\n\n\n 6.12pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 6.12pm  \n\nMorocco was under French rule between 1912 and 1956, which adds another layer to tonight\u2019s match. Quite how that layer will manifest, we don\u2019t yet know. The relationship is complicated, not least because a couple of Moroccan players \u2013 and their coach Walid Regragui \u2013 were born in France. I don\u2019t know enough about the subject to comment on it, and it\u2019s got nothing to do with the fact I\u2019m terrified of saying the wrong thing and being cancelled before kick-off.\n\n\nUpdated at 6.46pm GMT\n\n\n 6.11pm  \n\n\u201cWould Uruguay in 1950 count as a shock winner?\u201d says Julian Menz. \u201cThere have also been \u2019shock\u2019 finalists\u2026 Sweden in 1958 spring to mind.\u201d\nTrue, but not many, and none in the modern era (I don\u2019t count Croatia in 2018 because they were the best team in that half of the draw once it opened up). Uruguay beating Brazil in 1950 was a shock, but \u2013 and I know this sounds contradictory \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t say they were shock winners. Morocco were 200/1 before the tournament; for them to reach the final, never mind win it, would be unprecedented. \n\n\nUpdated at 6.17pm GMT\n\n\n 6.07pm  \n\n\u201cI agree with Charles Antaki yet there is a faint whiff of patronising status quo about that commonly held way of thinking,\u201d says Peter Oh. \u201cMorocco play like that not because they lack skill or creativity. They play like that because they have faced some of the most glittering heavyweight attacking football forces ever assembled.\n\u201cFootball is a game in which 11 players try to kick a spherical object into the net of the other team of 11. May Morocco do so more often than France today.\u201d\n\n\n\n 6.06pm  \n\nHow did they do that?\n\n\n\n\n 5.58pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 5.54pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 5.48pm  \nTeam news: Saiss, Aguerd, Mazraoui all start\n\nGreat news for Morocco: the captain Romain Saiss, Nayef Aguerd and Noussair Mazraoui are all fit to start in defence. Well, they start.\nAguerd and Mazraoui replace Yahia Attiyat Allah and Selim Amallah in the only changes from the win over Portugal. That probably means a switch to a back five.\nFrance also make two changes, though theirs are enforced. Youssouf Fofana and Ibrahima Konate replace Adrien Rabiot and Dayot Upamecano, who are unwell. I say \u2018unwell\u2019; apparently they\u2019ve caught the flu because of all the air conditioning. Upamecano is well enough to be on the bench.\nFrance (4-2-3-1ish) Lloris; Kounde, Varane, Konate, T Hernandez; Tchouameni, Fofana; Dembele, Griezmann, Mbappe; Giroud.Substitutes: Pavard, Disasi, Guendouzi, Kolo Muani, Veretout, Mandanda, Saliba, Upamecano, Coman, Areola, Camavinga, Thuram.\nMorocco (5-2-3) Bono; Hakimi, El Yamiq, Aguerd, Saiss, Mazraoui; Amrabat, Ounahi; Ziyech, En-Nesyri, Boufal.Substitutes: Hamdallah, Zaroury, Sabiri, El Kajoui, Chair, Aboukhlal, Amallah, Ezzalzouli, Dari, Tagnaouti, El Khannouss, Benoun, Attiat-Allah, Jabrane.\nReferee Cesar Arturo Ramos Palazuelos (Mexico)\n\n\nUpdated at 6.24pm GMT\n\n\n 5.41pm  \n\n\u201cYes - everything about Morocco being in the semifinals is good. An African nation,\u201d says Charles Antaki. \u201cAn Arab nation. A Muslim nation. Sticking two fingers up to colonial powers along the way; resoluteness; togetherness; and, not least, hugging your mother at the end of the game. Or nearly everything: for the neutral, the actual football they play is pretty dismal, or at least let\u2019s say unappealing. It\u2019s not as mind-numbingly ghastly as I recall Greece was back in 2004, but continuous massed defence, plus the occasional recce forward, is not a great watch. But good luck to them, of course.\u201d\nI know what you mean, although I would say that \u2013 as with Denmark when they won Euro 92 \u2013 some of their counter-attacks have been utterly exhilarating.\n\n\n\n 5.14pm  \n\nJacob Steinberg\u2019s big-match preview\n\n\n\n\n 5.00pm  \nPreamble\n\nAnd now for something completely different: a World Cup semi-final involving an African team. And an Arab team. Even in a football world full of hot air and hotter takes, it\u2019s very hard to overhype this game: France v Morocco, for a place in the World Cup final. Morocco have already made history, but imagine if they get to the final. Imagine if they win the bugger.\nFirst, a warning: tonight could be a thundering anti-climax. The semi-final is usually where World Cup fairytales end. There have been shock winners of the Africa Cup of Nations, Copa America and European Championship \u2013 but never the World Cup, and there haven\u2019t been many unlikely finalists either. The altitude of the semi-finals is usually too great for underdogs. But then the altitude of the quarter-finals was supposed to be too great for African teams.\nMorocco \u2013 or should that be Morocky - have defied logic, fatigue, injuries and a very harsh draw (they won their group, remember) to reach this stage. They\u2019ve already eliminated the teams ranked 2nd, 7th and 9th in the world; now they just have to take care of 3rd and 4th to complete \u2013 no offence, Brian \u2013 the greatest achievement in football history.\nLike Argentina, they have been inspired by extraordinary support, and that should be a factor again tonight. The subconscious says France will win regardless, but that\u2019s based more on history than the evidence of this tournament. When Greece won Euro 2004, many people confused defensive excellence with luck; we shouldn\u2019t make the same mistake with Morocco.\nMorocco\u2019s record this decade looks like that of a Pep Guardiola team: P41 W31 D8 L2 F86 A24. Yes, some of the opposition was relatively weak, but they are a team that is used to success. They have two main concerns tonight, and I\u2019m not talking about Kylian Mbappe and Antoine Griezmann. The first is how many of their players have run themselves into the ground against Spain and Portugal; the second is how they will react if they go behind.\nThat hasn\u2019t happened in the eight games since the remarkable Walid Regragui took over in August, and Morocco are built \u2013 both tactically and psychologically \u2013 to protect rather than search. But it\u2019s dangerous to make assumptions about their limitations, especially given their extraordinary team spirit. On the evidence of this World Cup, Regragui\u2019s players would crawl to the ends of the earth for him, never mind walk.\nI haven\u2019t really spoken about France in this preamble. The main reason is that Morocco are the big story, but it\u2019s also hard to know what to say about a team whose excellence has become so familiar in the last few years. While it hasn\u2019t been plain sailing in Qatar \u2013 they still haven\u2019t kept a clean sheet, and it\u2019s easy to forget that they are without at least four of their best XI - they have had the aura of winners from day one.\nFrance are two games away from becoming the first team in 60 years to retain the World Cup, which would mean instant all-time greatness. Three players at different stages of their careers \u2013 Mbappe, Griezmann and Olivier Giroud \u2013 are strong contenders to win the Golden Boot, the Golden Ball or both.\nWhile this is the biggest game in Morocco\u2019s history, for France it\u2019s just another semi-final \u2013 their third since 2016, fourth if you count the Nations League. They won all the others.\nTonight\u2019s winners will play Lionel Messi Team in the final on Sunday. There are two ways this can go: an expected victory for France, or an earthshattering win for Morocco.\nKick off 7pm GMT, 10pm in Al Khor, 8pm in Paris and Rabat.\n\n"

So is everyone looking forward to Costa Rica playing the Oceania winner for the last spot in the Cup? That\u2019s the most likely outcome at this point. Canada and the USA could clinch spots on Sunday. Thanks for following along today, and may your country always be qualifying.     4.02am   FULL TIME: Costa Rica 1-0 Canada  There\u2019s no doubt which team is better. Canada showed its quality throughout and dominated the second half even after being reduced to 10 men by a shocking call. But give Costa Rica credit. Well, give Keylor Navas credit. In a matchup of great goalkeepers, he never flinched, while Milan Borjan wasn\u2019t at his best.      4.00am    90 min +4: Stephen Eust\u00e1quio had nothing but a shot in mind with the free kick. He drilled it very hard. And straight into the wall.      3.59am    90 min +3: Free kick to Canada as David is fouled 25 yards out, and this is Canada\u2019s last chance ...     3.58am    90 min +2: As Pluto makes another orbit around the distant sun, Navas prepares to take a free kick. I\u2019ll take a quick nap, but I\u2019ll be up before he actually kicks the danged ball.     3.57am    90 min +1: Only three minutes of stoppage time. That\u2019s reasonable. No stoppages except for subs. USA and Mexico have finished 0-0.     3.56am    90 min: Eons pass while we await a Navas goal kick. Then Canada comes forward again.     3.55am    88 min: OFF THE BAR! ... but not legally Again, it\u2019s Laryea setting the stage, with a sharp pass finding Jonathan David for a quick shot that caroms away. Replay shows the ball came off his arm.      3.53am    87 min: More Canadian possession, but Hoilett rushes a ball over the top.      3.52am    85 min: My feed crashed briefly, so I\u2019ll just assume Canada had eight more shots on goal. Actually, no, it\u2019s a bad foul by Hutchinson, the Canadian captain who has not distinguished himself in this game.     3.50am    83 min: Chances for Canada!  Navas punches one long-range Laryea shot into the air. A follow-up shot is blocked. Have I mentioned that Costa Rica has a lot to lose with a draw here?     3.47am    79 min: More Canadian subs after some arguing between players and officials. The inexperienced duo of Ismael Kone and Ike Ugbo replaces Cyle Larin and Jonathan Osorio, both potent attackers but not as involved in tonight\u2019s action as some of their teammates.     3.42am    76 min: Canada did indeed make a substitution without the cameras taking notice. Reading midfielder Junior Hoilett is on.      3.41am    73 min: OFF THE BAR Close-range save for the excellent Navas from the equally excellent Laryea, but the rebound falls to Buchanan, whose shot clangs off the bar. It comes right back to Buchanan, but his next shot goes over the bar, and Costa Rica can exhale.  Updated at 3.44am GMT    3.37am    70 min: Worth noting that John Herdman has yet to substitute anyone in his 10-man lineup. Given the way Canada has played this half, he might be right to stay the course.     3.35am    68 min: Matarrita comes up limping, and we know he\u2019s not faking this one because he wasn\u2019t near a Canadian player and did not pretend to be so. He pounds the grass in frustration. FC Cincinnati fans won\u2019t be happy to see that. Juan Vargas replaces him.     3.33am    66 min: Half-chance for Costa Rica, headed high. In curling, South Korea scored three in the second end to race out to a lead against Canada, but Kerri Einarson and company battled back with two in the fifth to tie it 4-4. Also, the USA\u2019s Cory Christensen is keeping pace with one of the best in the world, Sweden\u2019s Anna Hasselborg.     3.31am    64 min: Chance for Canada! Stephen Eust\u00e1quio shoots from a 45-degree angle and sends it skimming just past the far post. Again -- Costa Rica is flirting with a costly surrender of two points here.     3.29am    61 min: Costa Rican subs: Chacon and Tejeda are in. Borjan has another puzzling moment and allows a corner for Costa Rica, and again, Canada\u2019s defense barely seems up to the challenge. Uncharacteristic game for the Red Star Belgrade keeper.     3.26am    59 min: Half-chance for Canada on a nice through ball on the fast break, but Navas alertly comes out to snare it. You could say Costa Rica is smartly playing for the counter, but this is getting risky. They need a result far more than Canada does.     3.24am    58 min: I\u2019ve neglected another call our referee got correct -- a yellow card to Matarrita for a challenge that caught two legs and no ball. Alexandra Fullerton writes: \u201cI could literally hear the neighbours groans there. Absolutely shocking miss. Greetings from Ciudad Colon in Costa Rica! As always thank you for the wonderful commentary!\u201d And thank you for checking in from a country I certainly plan to visit before I die. I\u2019d better get a move on, given the way I eat.     3.22am    55 min: Buchanan shows his nifty footwork again and draws a free kick -- perhaps a little soft, but do we care at this point? The ball pings around a bit, and Jonathan David turns to rifle a shot toward goal that\u2019s blocked out of play for a corner. Canada shouts for a handball, but it clearly was not. Yes, the referee got one right.     3.20am    53 min: CHANCE for Costa Rica! The ball is played ahead to Joel Campbell, who gets a couple of steps on the defense. A lone defender recovers just in time to put on some pressure as Borjan also arrives, and the ball squirts free, rolling slowly toward the goal until Borjan scampers back to swipe it away.     3.18am    Bryan Cruickshank writes: \u201cNice to see the BIG PAPER covering Canada game. Thank you ( as we say in Canada ). Terrible call for the red . We won\u2019t let that sit but it could get ugly. Shout out to anyone in Kingston, Ontario.\u201d On behalf of the BIG PAPER, thanks for checking in with us.     3.17am    49 min: CHANCE for Canada! Keylor Navas has to come out to cut down the angle as Tajon Buchanan beats his man on the right and fires. That\u2019s the first save for Navas, and it was a big one. Bear in mind -- Costa Rica only has two shots on goal, and the one that didn\u2019t go in was a routine save for Borjan.     3.15am    48 min: We have a halftime substitution, with the long-serving Bryan Ruiz replacing the assist man Torres. He announces his presence with a shot on goal, a statement of intent undercut somewhat by being several yards offside.     3.13am    46 min: The second half opens with a strong run down the left flank by Laryea. He ends up on the ground in the box, but on first glance, it seemed to be incidental contact.     3.12am    Final: Panama 1-1 Honduras Canada can now advance with a draw or, for some reason, a US loss to Mexico. Current standings: 25 Canada (game in progress)21 US (game in progress)21 Mexico (game in progress)18 Panama16 Costa Rica (game in progress) Other three teams eliminated.     3.09am    Comboplate writes: \u201cCanada fan here...so how does CONCACAF (bleep)-housery compare to the rest of the world? Don\u2019t get me wrong, CRC looks good and CAN is not playing level-headed but it also looks like the official is petrified of getting out of the country alive and is calling the game accordingly...\u201d I normally stick up for my brethren who take up the whistle. I can barely keep a game of 9-year-olds straight, much less highly charged full-grown players. And I\u2019ll do so ever so slightly here simply because the gamesmanship in Concacaf is at another level. The audacity of the dives would even make Italian players say, \u201cWhoa. That\u2019s a bit much.\u201d      3.03am    Seybold Powers writes: \u201cThat fake foul/walk in to an opponent and feign injury to get a yellow is hardly new for Costa Rica. Joel Campbell pulled the same stunt in a 2013 qualifier against the USA. And got a yellow. See the video.\u201d Report: FIFA investigating incident between USMNT\u2019s Matt Besler, Costa Rica\u2019s Joel Campbell | MLSSoccer.com Concacaf does not have the best reputation for refereeing.      2.58am   Halftime: Costa Rica 1-0 Canada  Torres again looks dangerous down the right, turning Stephen Eust\u00e1quio one way and then another, but then he forgets to stay on his feet. That\u2019s the last action of a compelling first half that was unfortunately rendered ridiculous when an atrocious bit of poor sportsmanship fooled the ref and left Canada with 10 men.     2.54am   GOAL! Costa Rica 1-0 Canada (Borges 45+1)  Borjan punches the ball a bit too meekly and falls down in the process. With the defense reeling, Gerson Torres lofts the ball dead center in the box, where a couple of Costa Rican players have their men beaten. Celso Borges gets there first and neatly heads it to one side of the net while Borjan watches. Not the Canadian keeper\u2019s best five minutes, but the defense didn\u2019t give him much chance.     2.51am    45 min: Canada seems just fine without Kaye on the field. The US and Mexico have wrapped up the first half scoreless. They\u2019ll be well-rested for the last game of qualifying because several players keep picking up yellow cards that will excuse them from participating over the weekend. We\u2019ll have four minutes of stoppage time here.     2.47am    41 min: What on earth is Milan Borjan doing? The excellent shot-stopper shows some clumsy feet, dawdling on the ball and finally playing it forward just as Costa Rica\u2019s press catches up. The deflected ball misses the net, but Canadian coach John Herdman will want a word at halftime.     2.44am    38 min: Canada seems energized by the controversy, setting up a nice goalmouth scramble in front of Navas\u2019 goal. Buchanan then figures if Costa Rica can earn a foul with a dive, he might try it as well. He gets called for handball. This is a farce.     2.41am   RED CARD for Canada  Oh, and this needs to be reviewed. While the ref failed to stop play with a Canadian player down on the field, a Costa Rican player walked up to Mark-Anthony Kaye, bumped into him and fell. Kaye earned a second yellow on one of the worst calls you\u2019ll ever see.     2.39am    34 min: Tajon Buchanan shows some nifty footwork. A Canadian player is injured and ... something has happened off camera.     2.38am    31 min: The rumors of Canada\u2019s counterattacking prowess are true. Richie Laryea races down the left flank and poses some questions for Costa Rican defense. The ball is partially cleared, but this time, Canada swings it out to Laryea for a shot. That\u2019s better from the qualifiers-in-waiting.     2.35am    28 min: Another dubious free kick for Costa Rica, but Canada handles this one a bit better.  And another.       2.32am    26 min: Meanwhile, it\u2019s dos a cero for the US against Mexico again. Unfortunately, we\u2019re talking about yellow cards rather than goals.     2.30am    24 min: Canada earns a corner kick at last. Stephen Eust\u00e1quio does nothing of significance with it, but the Canadians keep possession and earn a free kick as Tajon Buchanan falls easily. (For the record, yes, I am a referee.)     2.28am    22 min: Possession for Canada. It amounts to little. Elsewhere -- Honduras has equalized against Panama! Both of these teams, along with the US and Mexico, will love that news.     2.25am    19 min: Oh yes, Costa Rica still has a free kick and again, Canada deals with it poorly and allows an open header.  We can only hope Canadian fans remember that they\u2019ve practically qualified already.     2.23am    18 min: Canada can exhale. The call remains a yellow.     2.23am    17 min: This could be bad for Canada. Matarrita may have been telling the truth this time. Replay is showing Kaye\u2019s studs crashed into Matarrita\u2019s ankle. Lonnnng look from the ref.     2.22am    15 min: Yellow card to Mark-Anthony Kaye of Canada, well earned by Ronald Matarrita, who seems determined to roll all the way back to Cincinnati.  I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s acting. ... Oh, wait! We have VAR! Here we go ...     2.20am    13 min: A tactical thought ...  Hasn\u2019t happened yet, though a long spell of possession nearly gets the ball to the Costa Rican penalty area. The home side finally claims the ball, but Joel Campbell then fouls Jonathan Osorio to give it right back. Is Canada settling in now?     2.17am    11 min: Canadian captain Atiba Hutchinson commits a foul in a dangerous spot. Must be dangerous, because the Costa Rican player is still rolling around on the ground. Free kick deflected for a corner, and this one\u2019s dangerous. Francisco Calvo again gets away from his defender for a free header, and he doesn\u2019t miss by much.     2.13am    8 min: Free kick at midfield for Costa Rica, and this time, Canadian players make sure they can\u2019t take it quickly. That\u2019s not strictly legal, but our referee isn\u2019t interested in correcting such behavior.     2.12am    6 min: While Costa Rica plays keepaway against the Canadian press, check out another summary of the pregame festivities:       2.09am    3 min: Costa Rica earns a free kick on an effective dive about 35 yards out. They take it while Canada is setting up and race forward into the box, winning a corner while Canada comes dangerously close to taking down Matarrita for a penalty. The header from the corner goes high, but this is an unnerving start for the group leaders.     2.07am    2 min: Some sloppy passes from Canada, and Ronald Matarrita of FC Cincinnati gets room on the flank.     2.06am    1 min: Costa Rica\u2019s in red, Canada\u2019s back in black, and we\u2019re off ...     2.02am    And the fireworks continue through the Canadian national anthem. The players are gamely trying to sing at top volume over the fireworks and whistling. Rude hosts. Canada has one of the best anthems in the world, too.      2.00am    Also, Panama is up 1-0 on Honduras at the half, a result that neither of the teams will want to see but certainly had to expect.  Panama would likely move up to 20 points. Costa Rica would need a win to keep pace at 19. Both teams would still trail the top three of Canada, the US and Mexico, no matter what happens in the concurrent Mexico-US game. Back to our feature game -- teams are taking the field to a pulverizing display of fireworks. It\u2019s still going. And going. They\u2019ve finally stopped to allow for the singing of the national ... no, wait, they\u2019ve started again.  OK, now they\u2019re ... no, wait, still going ...     1.56am    Meanwhile, in Mexico ... Bryan Graham notes that the US resisted the temptation to save their stars for Sunday\u2019s match against Panama, which may be a safer bet to pick up three points that would virtually guarantee qualification:   So much for the rumblings that Gregg Berhalter might consider fielding a \u2018B team\u2019 to save the legs of key players for Sunday\u2019s match against Panama with five on a yellow card and facing a one-match suspension if they collect another. His team for tonight\u2019s match includes nine of the starters from November\u2019s win over Mexico in Cincinnati (Acosta for McKennie, Pulisic for Aaronson).   Read his live updates here. Also, Jamaica drew El Salvador to drag El Salvador into qualification oblivion.     1.39am    Starting at the same time tonight (this morning, if you\u2019re elsewhere in the world), Kerri Einarson and the Canadian women face South Korea in a game that could have a dramatic impact on who gets a bye into the world women\u2019s curling semifinals.  Just saying. Could be an epic night. But Canada wins curling world titles a lot more often than they qualify for the World Cup. (In soccer.) (In men\u2019s soccer. They\u2019re pretty good in women\u2019s.)      1.31am   Costa Rican lineup  Another star goalkeeper will be on the field at the other end. You may have heard of him from his several productive years at Real Madrid and his move to PSG. He\u2019s Keylor Navas. Beyond that, it\u2019s a team based mostly in Costa Rica, with a few exceptions in MLS.      1.24am   Canadian lineup  Goalkeeper Milan Borjan of Red Star Belgrade has played out of his mind in qualifiers, like a goalie getting hot and leading his team to the Stanley Cup. (Thank you, Braden Holtby, from your old home in the DC metro area.)  Cyle Larin is the leading scorer in the qualifiers with 12 goals in 13 games. Jonathan David has nine goals in 15.  The bad news is that Bayern Munich\u2019s Alphonso Davies, who has five goals and eight assists in qualifying, remains out with a Covid-related heart ailment. He\u2019s taking steps toward a return, which would be nice for the big event later this year. (The World Cup. Not whatever Bayern\u2019s doing.) Atiba Hutchinson, who plays with Larin at Besiktas, is the captain. He\u2019s 39, but age is just a number that tells you how old you are.      1.14am   Preamble  Welcome to a momentous occasion in Canadian history.  To explain why, let\u2019s look at the Concacaf qualification standings: Let\u2019s take a look at the CONCACAF qualifying standings through 11 of 14 games:  25 Canada21 US21 Mexico17 Panama16 Costa Rica9 El Salvador7 Jamaica3 Honduras So with a win, Canada has 28 points. Panama\u2019s max would be 20. The top three teams qualify for the World Cup. The fourth goes to a playoff against the Oceania representative.  Do the math. That\u2019s right. Canada can return to the World Cup for the first time since 1986 with a win tonight.  It won\u2019t be the easiest task. Costa Rica\u2019s Estadio Nacional is never an easy place to play, with the Ticos conceding three points only once in the last 19 World Cup qualifiers. But it\u2019s likely academic, anyway. TSN counts three ways Canada can clinch a berth tonight without a win. After that, there are two more matchdays. Panama or Costa Rica would basically have to win out while Canada forgets how to play.  This is, though, the best Canadian team \u2026 well, ever. The days of middling MLS players chasing Dwight Yorke and Jorge Dely Valdes around the field are long past. Thanks to holistic long-term planning that turned out to be more than buzzwords, along with some greater academy investment, Canada isn\u2019t just for curling any more.  (That said, I\u2019ll keep you apprised of the latest from the women\u2019s world championships as well.)     12.55am    Beau will be here shortly. In the meantime, here\u2019s Cyle Larin on his team\u2019s success: \u201cIf we make the World Cup people will know who we are,\u201d Cyle Larin says. The Besiktas forward knows that Canada are on their way to achieving something special. They have only once qualified for the World Cup, only to go out in the first round after losing all of their group games at Mexico 86, but a place in Qatar is there for the taking. November\u2019s 2-1 victory over Mexico has made people take notice of Canada. They had not beaten Mexico since 1976 and Larin, who scored both his side\u2019s goals on a freezing night in Edmonton, feels that momentum is building. \u201cWe can compete against anybody,\u201d Larin says. \u201cIf you\u2019re playing for this team, it\u2019s special. You saw it in the Mexico game. \u201cWe hadn\u2019t beaten Mexico in a long time. The last three times we\u2019d played Mexico I was injured and had to watch. We always had a chance to win and this time I told myself we\u2019d beat them. We did and it showed how good we are. I think it\u2019s the team and brotherhood we have. A lot of players play in Europe and we\u2019ve never had that before. Now we\u2019ve been together for a while and keep growing.\u201d You can read the full interview here:   "

                    "body": "Let\u2019s do this by numbers, shall we? For the first time in four World Cups, Spain won their opening game. Dani Olmo scored their 100th goal in the tournament\u2019s history and 18-year-old Gavi, one of two teenagers in the starting lineup, was their youngest ever goalscorer.\nThey were just two of six different scorers, Spain reaching that magical figure the vidiprinter spells out to avoid confusion and express wonder.\nThey had 16 shots, allowed none in return, and scored 7 (seven) times. No wonder Carlos Soler celebrated getting the sixth in the 90th minute with a point and a wink that said: \u2018we\u2019re here\u2019. Boy, are they.\n\nThere was still time for \u00c1lvaro Morata to add another two minutes later, Spain\u2019s No 7 getting Spain\u2019s seventh. Mi Gran Noche by Raphael, a gay icon back home, boomed round the place. It had been a great night, that is for sure, Luis Enrique left laughing, his team having presented their candidacy. Spain played more than a thousand passes and, if the old question used to run \u201cyeah but how many mattered?\u201d, the new answer looks like it could well be: all of them. Pointless? Not a bit of it. It is hard to recall a performance as complete as this.\n\u201cWe were superb in every aspect of the game and I like the fact we dominated from the first whistle,\u201d Luis Enrique said. \u201cIt was very special; everything went well.\u201d\nFrom Costa Rica\u2019s point of view, it might be equally difficult to remember one as calamitous, an aged side mercilessly taken to pieces by kids. For Luis Fernando Su\u00e1rez\u2019s team it began badly, never got better and could get worse. \u201cPsychologically I\u2019m really worried we won\u2019t be able to recover from this,\u201d he said.\nRight to the end, Spain sliced away at them, leaving scars, something cruel about it.\nSu\u00e1rez had anticipated that Spain would have more of the possession, but not like this. By the end, they just wanted it to stop, but Spain refused. Sometimes intent is everything, and theirs was vicious.\n\nThe first of the seven arrived after only 11 minutes, and it could already have been the third. Dani Olmo and Marco Asensio had clear chances before Gavi\u2019s deflected dinked pass saw Olmo produce a lovely reverse spin, controlling and turning to slot past Keylor Navas. At that point Fifa\u2019s stats, which now allow for moments when neither team has the ball, said Spain had had 79% of possession: 10% was contested, but those were contests the selecci\u00f3n invariably won, an intensity to their excellence. Gavi, as usual, led the press.\nHe and Pedri \u2013 the smooth glider who turns 20 on Friday \u2013 dominated the encounter. But then all of the Spain side did, a collective endeavour that was hugely convincing. The ball just kept pinging off the boot of Sergio Busquets, exactly where he wanted it to, no need for it to linger there any longer.\nThe wide positions, occupied by Olmo and Ferran Torres, were very wide, the pitch much too big for Costa Rica to ever get anywhere on time. Asensio was the false 9, mobile and always available.\nAnd perhaps you could call Rodri a false 4, the Manchester City midfielder employed at centre-back but in those parts of the pitch usually occupied by the pivot. \u201cThe centre\u2011backs will touch the ball more than 100 times,\u201d Luis Enrique\u2019s assistant said. Rodri had 91 of those by half-time alone.\n\nSpain, meanwhile, had three goals. Another long period of possession culminated in Jordi Alba again flying up the left, legs whirring. He found Asensio, who turned the shot in: 2-0 after 20 minutes, the pace was set. Navas might have done better, but he was not the only one: this was so one-sided as to be absurd.\nAll in white, ghosts, Costa Rica\u2019s players were not in the match or the match reports, nothing to say about them. They were there only as victims. Or, it turned out, perpetrators. Such as the moment when Carlos Mart\u00ednez was bamboozled by Alba. Or the next minute when Celso Borges tripped Alba inside his penalty area.\nEven the subsequent penalty spoke of superiority, a total mastery of everything, especially time. Torres paused, and rolled the ball in: 3-0 after just over half an hour.\nBy half-time, Spain had 85% of possession on the old measure. The surprise was that Costa Rica could claim 15%. The numbers were racking up fast, the goals soon at four.\n\nThis time, maybe, there was an answer to the inevitable question that asks whether a wild result rests on a team being really, really good or their opponents being bad. This time, Costa Rica could be blamed directly, Francisco Calvo kneeling before Torres, Bryan Oviedo unable to do anything either, an irretrievable mess allowing the former Manchester City player to score.\nSpain made changes, Busquets and Alba off and protected, Torres departing to applause. Nico Williams replaced Asensio, and flew into his opponents. Soler came, too. Morata entered and immediately hit the side-netting. The hunger was maintained \u2013 or even increased\u2013 the new men, boys, keen to be part of this.\nAn extraordinary 50-yard run from Alejandro Balde led to Morata clipping a cross from which Gavi hit a gorgeous volley with the outside of his boot. Spain had five, and they still were not finished, continuing until they had completed the biggest World Cup win in their history, taking the total on their grand night to 7 (seven)."

                    "body": "In 1982, a Welsh-language folk singer from Brynamman, Carmarthenshire, called Dafydd Iwan sat down to write a song about his country. At the time Iwan \u201cfelt demoralised\u201d about Wales. The main reason being a 1979 referendum, in which just under 80% of voters decided against forming a Welsh parliament, instead favouring the status quo: Westminster rule. Iwan, a devout nationalist who was briefly imprisoned in the 1970s for defacing English road signs and would later go on to be the president of Plaid Cymru between 2003 and 2010, wanted to write a song to \u201craise the spirits, to remind people we still speak Welsh against all odds. To show we are still here,\u201d he says. He called it Yma o Hyd (\u201cStill Here\u201d). The song consists of rousing acoustic guitar, backing vocals that sound like a small male voice choir, synthetic organ and a snare drum that evokes a marching band.  In the 39 years since it was released, Yma o Hyd has become an anthem for \u201cWelsh nationalists, Welsh-speaking culture and the industrial working class of Wales,\u201d says Martin Johnes, professor of history at Swansea University. Iwan himself remembers singing it on picket lines, many times, for miners, quarrymen and farmers. \u201cThe effects of Thatcherism were so blatant, so far-reaching. And Welshness was in turmoil. Yma o Hyd was a deliberate antidote to that,\u201d he says. Today, the song (or at least the chorus) is known to most who have lived in Wales. In schools and stadiums, pubs and clubs, you will at some point hear people singing: \u201cEr gwaetha pawb a phopeth / Ry\u2019n ni yma o hyd,\u201d which translates as \u201cDespite everyone and everything / We\u2019re still here\u201d. In total, the phrase \u201cwe\u2019re still here\u201d is sung 19 times across the song\u2019s four-and-a-half minutes.  \u201cDespite everyone and everything\u201d refers to the troubled history of Welsh identity. The song starts with the Romans leaving Wales in AD383 thanks to \u201cMacsen\u201d (the Roman emperor Magnus Maximus, who withdrew his troops to Gaul), \u201ca myth but commonly attributed as the start of modern Wales\u201d, says Johnes. It ends with Margaret Thatcher (\u201cEr gwaetha \u2019rhen Fagi a\u2019i chriw\u201d; \u201cDespite old Maggie and her crew\u201d), evoking an era that felt to Iwan like an existential threat to Welshness. In 1983, Thatcher led the Conservative party to its then best general election result in Wales, and by the following year, the miners\u2019 strike was under way. By 1986, fewer than 40% of Welsh households were headed by someone in full-time employment. Culturally, Wales has been surviving on scraps for even longer. \u201cWales was politically annexed in 1280; we haven\u2019t had a totally self-governing political unit since,\u201d says Johnes. Add to that the language being banned by Henry VIII in 1536, a law that lasted until 1942, and \u201cthe survival of Welsh identity is pretty remarkable\u201d, he adds. The symbolism the song carries has never been more palpable. Last year, a poll conducted by Savanta ComRes found that 40% of Welsh people were in favour of independence. Welsh nationalism is stirring once again and its main stage is not before a rugby union match at the Principality stadium, as many might think. It\u2019s at Cardiff City stadium, where Wales\u2019s national team play the \u201cother\u201d sport: football. There has been a sea change since Wales\u2019s historic European Championship campaign in 2016, their first appearance in the tournament. That year, Wales reached the semi-final, having knocked out Belgium (then favourites) 3-1 in the quarter-final. That particular moment marked a shift in Welsh culture for many. In footballing terms, the country showed Europe it was able to perform as well as any other nation. Five years later, Wales would be on the same stage once more at the Covid-delayed Euro 2020.  This year, Wales have set their eyes on the prospect of playing in the World Cup for the first time since 1958. Most recently on this journey, they played a qualifying play-off semi-final against Austria at the Cardiff City stadium. While the terraces have reverberated to Yma o Hyd for a few years, this time round the players requested that Iwan perform the song himself shortly before kickoff. Against Austria, he did just that, in front of Wales\u2019s most fervent supporters, the \u201cred wall\u201d.  Comedian, broadcaster and avid Welsh football fan Elis James, from Haverfordwest in Pembrokeshire, doesn\u2019t remember a time before the song existed. He was at the Austria semi-final. To his surprise, \u201cthe entire crowd sang it. And it just felt like this tremendous symbol for how the Welsh language is now seen by Welsh people.\u201d \u201cYou could see my tears,\u201d Iwan says, reflecting on singing the song at that moment. \u201cThe tears were because I\u2019ve been singing the song for 40 years, and I felt as though in that moment, the message finally came through and crossed the language barrier.\u201d  The song, as Josh Millar, a lifelong football fan and Welsh speaker who has \u201cYma o Hyd\u201d tattooed on his biceps, points out \u201cis very simple. Non-Welsh speakers can grasp the meaning and pronunciation far more easily than the national anthem.\u201d Its catchiness was proved again in January 2020, when the pro-independence campaign YesCymru managed to get Yma o Hyd to the top of the iTunes UK chart. That is not to say the song is unconditionally loved in Wales, even among those striving for independence. In response to the song reaching No 1, Welsh news website Nation.Cymru published a comment piece titled: \u201cWales needs less Yma o Hyd and more of a focus on shaping our future\u201d. The piece lamented that the song \u201csuccumbs to the idea that our greatest strength is our ability to stubbornly remain in place, like a stain that our enemies have long since given up on removing\u201d. Its author, Joshua McCarthy, is a campaigns officer for the youth wing of Plaid Cymru, Plaid Ifanc. \u201cMy views are my own, not those of Plaid Ifanc,\u201d he says, adding that Yma o Hyd \u201cdoesn\u2019t say anything about what still being here actually means. We\u2019re not the same nation as we were in 1983, and endurance isn\u2019t everything.\u201d There is at least one more chapter to this story. On 5 June, Wales face one final play-off game against Ukraine. The prize: a place at the World Cup. Before the game, as he did for the semi-final, Iwan will sing the song pitchside, backed by a stadium full of fans. \u201cI think that whatever happens, the future of Welsh football is in safe hands, and the song will stick around, too,\u201d says James. It certainly doesn\u2019t look to be leaving the stands any time soon. It is, without doubt, Wales\u2019s other national anthem."

Eriksen, who scored with his first touch after coming on as a substitute in the 4-2 friendly defeat against the Netherlands in Amsterdam on Saturday, was guaranteed a warm welcome at the stadium that fell into shocked silence when he collapsed in the Euro 2020 group game against Finland.  Joakim Maehle gave the Danes the lead with a thumping deflected drive in the 15th minute and Jesper Lindstr\u00f8m added a second eight minutes after the break as the home side enjoyed the better chances. Captaining the team, Eriksen gave the vocal Danish crowd what they wanted in the 57th minute, cutting on to his right foot and firing in a fizzing drive at the opposite end of the pitch to where he collapsed. Still building his fitness after restarting his club career at Brentford in February, Eriksen had his name chanted by the crowd as he was replaced in the 80th minute, with Kasper Schmeichel kissing him on the head as he handed over the captain\u2019s armband. Having failed to register a single shot on target until the 88th minute, Serbia will be hoping that they can improve their wayward shooting before both sides head for the World Cup finals in Qatar, which begin in November."

                    "body": "For 30 riotous, raucous minutes at the King Baudouin Stadium, you could convince yourself that everything was fine. Everything was coming off: Leandro Trossard found the top corner from 25 yards. Leander Dendoncker piled one in from distance. Kevin De Bruyne was having one of those games where he simply does whatever he wants. With virtually the last kick, the explosive 21-year-old Club Brugge striker Lois Openda scored a debut goal. Final score: Belgium 6-1 Poland. Normal service spectacularly resumed. Everyone was having so much fun that it was almost possible to forget the humiliation that had taken place on the same pitch just five nights earlier. Against their neighbours the Netherlands, Belgium did not so much implode as disappear, deservedly losing 4-1. Afterwards Louis van Gaal \u2013 who you suspect has never quite forgiven Belgium for turning him down for the national team job in 2016 \u2013 crowed imperiously about how his side had \u201cone player extra in every position on the pitch\u201d.  It was Belgium\u2019s heaviest home defeat in 14 years and for all the catharsis of the Poland win, as they prepare to face Wales in Cardiff on Saturday night, Roberto Mart\u00ednez\u2019s side are encountering some new and discomforting questions. Was it a blip? Was it a wake-up call, as Mart\u00ednez insisted? Or for an ageing team that lost their world No 1 ranking earlier this year, was it the first sign of a slow and inexorable decline? On the face of things, the Belgians remain an irresistible force. They have scored in an astonishing 46 consecutive games since losing the 2018 World Cup semi-final to France. Six years into the job Mart\u00ednez remains a resilient and popular coach, having established a club-like mentality, kept faith in a recognised core of world-class players, drilled a familiar system and an attractive attacking style. And with five months remaining until the World Cup there can be little doubt that Belgium remain among the favourites. In Thibaut Courtois and De Bruyne they have two players widely considered the best in the world in their position. Eden Hazard has made a heartening return to form. Romelu Lukaku would still walk into most major international teams. For now, the golden generation is still just about in business. And yet defeat by the Netherlands, which followed a disappointing Nations League finals campaign in October, has exposed cracks in the edifice. There have been flawed draws against Wales and the Republic of Ireland, routine victories against teams such as Burkina Faso and Estonia. But since eliminating Portugal in the last 16 of Euro 2020, they have played four games against top-10 opposition \u2013 France, the Netherlands and two against Italy \u2013 and lost the lot.  For a Belgian public gorged on the feats of their greatest-ever side, these are not fresh concerns. Almost from the moment they emerged, the golden generation carried not simply the hopes of a nation, but also its agony and angst. What constitutes success? What constitutes failure? What comes after? In recent months, however, a certain mournful despondency also seems to have taken hold: the idea that this is already a team wilting at the edges, a team whose best chance has already been squandered. \u201cWithout a trophy, we climbed to first place in the Fifa rankings,\u201d the former national team coach George Leekens told So Foot magazine last year. \u201cBut this first rank means nothing. When you don\u2019t dare to do things, nothing is with you. This mentality and this will to win does not exist in Mart\u00ednez\u2019s group.\u201d The former Anderlecht coach Aad de Mos has written off Belgium\u2019s chances in Qatar. \u201cI saw Argentina and Brazil play this week, the Belgians can no longer do that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is over. They have no chance.\u201d The primary area of concern is in defence, where Benfica\u2019s Jan Vertonghen and Al-Duhail\u2019s Toby Alderweireld are still plugging away, serenely untroubled by competitors. Defensive organisation has long been Mart\u00ednez\u2019s achilles heel \u2013 dating back to his time at Wigan and Everton \u2013 and with his veteran centre-halves in gentle recession, there is a sense that his favoured 3-4-3 invites too much pressure on the penalty area. For a top side, a record of one clean sheet in eight matches bodes ill. Further forward, admittedly, the picture is brighter. There is still competition for places, and promising youngsters such as Openda, Jeremy Doku and Charles De Ketelaere are poised to step into the breach if \u2013 as expected \u2013 Hazard and Lukaku retire after the World Cup. \u201cI\u2019ve heard things like: \u2018It\u2019s over, we\u2019ll never win anything again, behind this generation there isn\u2019t much,\u2019\u201d the 20-year-old Doku said in December. \u201cI have confidence. We are not going to become zero all of a sudden.\u201d  For now, though, Belgium are very much a two-tier squad, with a nucleus of grizzled veterans, a smattering of youngsters, but not much in between. Vertonghen will be 35 by the time of the World Cup, Alderweireld and Axel Witsel 33, Hazard and De Bruyne 31, Courtois 30, Lukaku and Yannick Carrasco 29. Arguably the 25-year-old Youri Tielemans is the only first-choice player in his peak years. There is a certain irony in that it was a spectacular 4-2 victory against the Netherlands in 2012 that truly ushered in the age of the golden generation. A decade on, the final curtain awaits. And so to Cardiff, the beginning of a six-month countdown that \u2013 one way of the other \u2013 feels like the end of something."

                    "body": "Oh, Aziz. You\u2019ve done it now. The second it happened, Argentina\u2019s players knew there was only one way this was going to end. Anyone who has watched Lionel Messi a lot did, and there has been a lot of him to watch. By the time they left the Ahmad bin Ali Stadium, scene of his 1,000th game, his teammate Alexis Mac Allister was laughing about it, the apparent inevitability of it all. Australia had picked the wrong guy: that\u2019s not a knife, this is a knife.\nThere were 10 minutes to go until half-time, there had been little sign of a breakthrough, and Messi had given the ball away the last two times he had it, when he and Aziz Behich clashed out on the right touchline. The Dundee United player barged him, grabbed his shirt and had a word or five. Shortly after he also gave away a free-kick, for a foul on Alejandro G\u00f3mez. Messi took the free-kick, fast. Within seconds, Argentina had the lead and their captain had scored his 789th career goal - seven hundred and eighty nine \u2013 and his first in a World Cup knockout.\n\nHeading across from the touchline, Messi had rolled it towards Mac Allister, turned and continued to the area. \u201cI always try to pass to him, try to make sure the ball gets to him because if he has it everything\u2019s much easier,\u201d the midfielder said, three hours later, but this time was different. Yet if one of those rare moments when he wasn\u2019t looking for Messi, still he still found him, like the ball has a will of its own. And, let\u2019s face it, whose feet would you rather the ball fell at?\n\u201cThe pass was for Otamendi, but it came to Messi, which was a bit of a surprise,\u201d Mac Allister admitted, mission accomplished if accidentally. Otamendi lost control \u2013 \u201cI told Leo it was an assist,\u201d he joked later \u2013 but Messi rescued it, took a touch and then played another pass, this time into the net. The shot went through the legs of Stoke\u2019s Harry Souttar \u2013 alas, it was neither wet nor Wednesday \u2013 and beyond the dive of Maty Ryan. It was Argentina\u2019s first shot on target, and the first time he had been in the area.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably the only chance I\u2019ll ever get to share the pitch with arguably the greatest to ever do it [and] it\u2019s a bit surreal, a moment to reflect on at the end: to look back and say you got to compete with one of the greatest,\u201d Australia\u2019s Jackson Irvine said. \u201cWhat stands out is his understanding of the game, how he picks and chooses his moments to come to life. And when he does he\u2019s hard to stop. We controlled him so well for most of the first half, but it\u2019s that one little moment, that one half-metre you give him. We\u2019ve seen it hundreds of times: so ruthless, so clinical, and ultimately that was the difference.\u201d\n\nThere was just one doubt. Had Messi chosen that moment himself? Or had Behich \u2013 who, it should be said, almost scored the goal of the World Cup when for a moment he was more Messi than Messi \u2013 accidentally chosen it for him? A rule going back years reads: don\u2019t piss off \u201cLa Pulga\u201d. Behich had done that, waking something in him, the animal within, and payback was swift. After all, when it was later suggested that the first thought Argentina\u2019s players had when they saw the foul was \u201coh, you fool\u201d, that they could see it coming, Mac Allister laughed. \u201cFor sure, for sure,\u201d he replied.\n\u201cWhen those things happen, it brings out the fire he has inside, the personality he has, and that makes him even greater than he is,\u201d the Brighton midfielder said. \u201cHe always tries to give his best but those moments work for him, they\u2019re useful: he plays even better, and in games like he\u2019s even greater yet. He has those touches that appear from nowhere and win you the game.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is the most important player we have: he knows that, he helps us a lot and we are proud to have him,\u201d Mac Allister said. \u201cI enjoy playing with him, it makes me happy: for me he\u2019s the best player in history of the world.\u201d\nNot everyone agrees back home. Mac Allister\u2019s father, Carlos \u201cColorado\u201d Mac Allister played just three times for Argentina, his international career lasting less than a month and taking in two matches against Australia in the playoff that took them to the 1994 World Cup and a friendly against Germany wedged in the middle. At least he can, and does, always say that his captain then was Argentina\u2019s other great No 10, Diego Maradona. His son\u2019s captain is the man trying to emulate him.\n\u201cWe always have that argument,\u201d Mac Allister junior said. \u201cFor my dad, Maradona was very important, not just in his career but in his personal life and he is very grateful. For me, it\u2019s a source of pride to be at Leo\u2019s side and play with him. For me obviously he\u2019s the best in history. We argue: he says Maradona is the best ever; I say it\u2019s Messi. It\u2019s a discussion I don\u2019t think will ever end.\u201d"

                    "body": "Liverpool continue to make heroes during a never-to-be-forgotten season, to accumulate silverware, to hint at something historic. On this occasion, it was the back-up left-back, Kostas Tsimikas, who made the difference, proving that even the more unheralded members of J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s squad can be counted on.\nIntroduced as a substitute in the closing stages of extra time, the Greece international, who joined from Olympiakos in the summer of 2020 for \u00a311.7m, stepped up to take Liverpool\u2019s seventh penalty of the shootout. It was the kick which won the FA Cup.\n\nLiverpool had been in the same situation at the end of round five. C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta had hit the post for Chelsea with the first kick of the second round and Sadio Man\u00e9 made the mission to the spot, intending to complete phase two of Operation Quadruple.\nMan\u00e9 seemed to be taking his time over the walk, savouring it. He had scored the decisive penalty for Senegal in their victories in the Africa Cup of Nations final and the World Cup playoff. Everybody knew that he was going to score. But he did not, his Senegal teammate \u00c9douard Mendy going the right way to save.\nIt was a moment of the purest drama. Thomas Tuchel, the Chelsea manager, beat the turf in delirium. It was back on for his team; the opportunity to end a traumatic season on a high. And then it was snatched away again after Alisson read Mason Mount\u2019s intentions to make an outstanding save to his left.\nEnter Tsimikas. What a moment for the 26-year-old. And he made it a defining one for his career with the coolest of finishes. The Liverpool half of the stadium exploded, red flares lighting the scene, and Klopp could celebrate the addition of the FA Cup to his CV.\n\nKlopp wants more. The Premier League feels like a big ask, with his team trailing Manchester City by three points with two games to play \u2013 and an inferior goal difference. Then there is the small matter of the Champions League final against Real Madrid on 28 May.\nThere was a scare here when Mohamed Salah was forced off with an injury in the 32nd minute but it was not a time to dwell on that, rather for the club to enjoy a first FA Cup since the Steven Gerrard-inspired victory over West Ham in 2006, which was also won on penalties.\n\nIs there a team that has shown greater composure in shootouts over the years than Liverpool? Their first trophy of this season had been won on penalties \u2013 the Carabao Cup against Chelsea \u2013 and there were parallels to that day, particularly in how both teams failed to take their chances during a stalemate.\nIt was not as open as the previous instalment, the legs heavy after a long season. For Chelsea, there has been the emotional drain of the impending takeover; for Liverpool, the remorselessness of a schedule that could bring the ultimate glory. But there were still plenty of opportunities.\nThe tension rose steadily and Liverpool thought they had cracked through it not once but twice in a whirlwind 60 seconds from the 83rd minute. Instead, they twice struck the post. First, the excellent Luis D\u00edaz shot against the outside of the right-hand upright and then Andy Robertson, arriving to meet a cross from the substitute James Milner, crashed against the other one.\n\nChelsea had craved what Tuchel called an \u201cinjection of positivity\u201d from this showpiece and they almost got it in normal time, before the slow and inevitable trudge towards penalties. There were big chances for Christian Pulisic and Marcos Alonso in the first half and Alonso again straight after the interval. The left wing-back would also rattle the crossbar with a 48th-minute free-kick from a tight angle.\nTuchel pulled the same move that he had done in the Carabao Cup, introducing a player specifically for the shootout in the 119th minute. Back then, it had been the goalkeeper, Kepa Arrizabalaga, and we all remember how that worked out. This time, it was Ross Barkley for a nonplussed Ruben Loftus-Cheek, who had come on himself as a substitute. Barkley did not touch the ball before the final whistle, meaning that his only touch was when he stepped up in round four. He lashed past Alisson.\n\nMendy would get his fingertips to the penalties of Milner and Roberto Firmino, albeit in vain, and Chelsea\u2019s players crumpled to the turf when it was all over. It was their third FA Cup final in succession and their third defeat, an unwanted new record. Revenge for the Carabao Cup was on their minds. They did not get it.\nLiverpool had laid down the early markers, with D\u00edaz worrying Trevoh Chalobah with his pace. He almost picked out Thiago with a cross and then missed a one-on-one after a wonderful Trent Alexander-Arnold through-ball. Credit Mendy with a big block.\nChelsea battled back after a tough opening 20 minutes. Pulisic dragged wide and then played in Alonso, whose first touch let him down. Romelu Lukaku also shot high. Tuchel\u2019s team had a flurry of chances at the start of the second half, with Alonso shooting past the far post before his free-kick effort and Pulisic extending Alisson.\nDiogo Jota, who came on for Salah, blew two good chances while the ball would not go in for D\u00edaz. But Liverpool found a way."

                    "body": "Brilliant with the ball at his feet. With a microphone in his face? Not so much. Christian Pulisic\u2019s precise control and adroit pass to set up the opening USMNT goal in Wednesday\u2019s 3-0 win over Morocco was a highlight on an excellent night for Gregg Berhalter\u2019s side. But the forward ensured headlines wouldn\u2019t solely focus on the action when he criticized the below-capacity attendance in a post-match interview with ESPN. Pulisic is not usually one of the squad\u2019s more effervescent media talkers, but asked about returning to play in the US for the first time since March, the Chelsea attacker said: \u201cIt was nice. To be honest, for whatever reason, I\u2019m not super happy with the amount of Americans here, however that works out, if I\u2019m being completely honest.\u201d The announced crowd at TQL Stadium in Cincinnati was 19,512, many of them Morocco fans, in a venue that holds 26,000.  Pulisic\u2019s comment was indelicately phrased, though he did add: \u201cThanks to the ones who did come and the support is always great from them.\u201d And no player should be expected to be at their most eloquent during the obligatory instant-reaction interview, when adrenaline flows, sweat glistens and they\u2019re speaking between swigs of Gatorade. If asked more than two questions most players\u2019 eyes dart around for an exit route as if they\u2019re entering a hostage situation. The 23-year-old is right to set high standards and to want his country to attract the levels of support enjoyed by the leading football nations. A crowd of fewer than 20,000 fans feels poor so soon after the sugar rush of Qatar 2022 qualification and with the tournament on the horizon. But it\u2019s the US Soccer Federation who deserve scrutiny, not the people of southwest Ohio. Safe to say that Pulisic, who joined Chelsea from Borussia Dortmund for a $73m transfer fee in 2019, doesn\u2019t need to fret about the rising price of food and gas. Especially in this economic climate \u2013 and given trends in football generally, with fans\u2019 appetite for unglamorous international friendlies waning as the club game dominates \u2013 it is unrealistic to expect routine sellouts when the result doesn\u2019t matter and tickets are costly. And a midweek kick-off when children three and older are priced as adults won\u2019t attract families. Cincinnati is only the 29th largest US urban area. The median household income is about $66,500, close to the US average. But ticket prices were at least $60 before fees \u2013 and many areas of the stadium were far more expensive. We\u2019ve written before about the USSF\u2019s policy of charging skyscraping sums for matches while opting to play in MLS stadiums with capacities in the 20,000-25,000 range rather than NFL venues that seat 60,000 or more. The location choices enable the team to appear in front of full houses in soccer-specific venues. The pricing strategy allows the federation to grow revenues \u2013 which they can plough into the sport, or legal fees \u2013 even if attendances stagnate. For the 2002 World Cup qualifying cycle the average crowd at US home games was 31,158. Twenty years later, with soccer now far more popular, it was 24,845. That\u2019s also lower than Canada\u2019s average attendance in the 2021-22 Concacaf octagonal, though the US population is nearly nine times greater. In the era of Brian McBride and Cobi Jones a ticket cost about $28 on average, according to USSF figures reported by SI\u2019s Brian Straus. If the price of a seat had risen in line with inflation the average cost today would be roughly $46. But even for the doomed 2018 cycle the average price had already rocketed to $97. And ultra-expensive \u201cpremium\u201d seating areas are increasingly clogging stadiums like Lamborghinis at the valet stand of a five-star hotel. The USMNT\u2019s next match, Sunday\u2019s friendly against Uruguay at Children\u2019s Mercy Park in Kansas City, is not far off a sellout, though the place only holds 18,500. A wide selection of seats is still available at Q2 Stadium in Austin for the Concacaf Nations League game against Grenada on 10 June, though it\u2019s the last US home match before the tournament in Qatar. Seats cost upwards of $45 on Ticketmaster as of Thursday afternoon, with those near the dugout for the clash with opponents ranked 170th in the world priced between $120 and $590. Better value was on offer when Italy met Argentina at Wembley Stadium on Wednesday in a clash between the European and South American champions. Standard tickets were \u00a325-55 ($31-$69), with a top-priced club-level seat selling for \u00a399 ($125). The Finalissima was an 87,112 sellout. \u201cI understand what [Pulisic] is saying but I think putting the burden on the fans is misplaced,\u201d says Zach Blandford, secretary of the Cincinnati chapter of the American Outlaws supporters\u2019 group. He paid $75 for his spot behind the goal and felt that the atmosphere was exuberant. Berhalter\u2019s side are frequent visitors to Ohio. They met Mexico in Cincinnati (a sellout) last November, while there were two games recently in Columbus, about a hundred miles away. The USWNT edged Paraguay 8-0 in a friendly at TQL last September in front of 22,515. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s that people aren\u2019t excited to see the team anymore. Everyone I talk to here is still so excited every time the team comes in,\u201d Blandford says. \u201cA lot of people I know that are part of our supporters\u2019 group that show up to our watch parties were priced out of the game. I think that\u2019s a shame. I think that trying to get every penny out of these friendlies and then having comments like this about the fans, it\u2019s tough, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair. I think that we have great fans here.\u201d With Berhalter shaping a young, dynamic and improving side as the US return to the world stage for the first time since 2014, every empty seat is a missed opportunity to begin or cement a relationship. \u201cOn the way to the game I was riding in a Lyft and I was taking to my driver who\u2019s a big soccer fan and never been able to go to the stadium and I was able to get him a free ticket through AO Cincy,\u201d Blandford says. \u201cI look down the row and he\u2019s drumming at half time with the rest of us in the stands and that\u2019s a super-cool thing, right? That\u2019s what happens when you make these games accessible to people who can\u2019t always go, is you create new fans, you create new memories.\u201d"

                    "body": "The importance of the occasion was not lost on Kalidou Koulibaly and neither was the poignancy. Two years to the day since Papa Bouba Diop died aged 42, his successors in the Senegal shirt honoured the midfielder\u2019s memory in the finest way possible, advancing into the last 16 and a date with England at the expense of Ecuador.\nKoulibaly prepared for the Group A decider by watching videos of Bouba Diop in his prime. The Senegal captain shaped it with his first international goal, sending the Africa Cup of Nations champions through and Ecuador out with a winner 150 seconds after Mois\u00e9s Caicedo\u2019s equaliser threatened to turn the tables.\nBouba Diop, or \u201cThe Wardrobe\u201d as he was known, started Senegal\u2019s run to the 2002 quarter-finals with a famous winner against France for a team featuring the current manager Aliou Ciss\u00e9. Ciss\u00e9\u2019s crew can eye a repeat courtesy of a composed and powerful victory over Ecuador, and a timely contribution from their captain.\n\n\u201cWe knew this was one of the most important games of our career,\u201d said the Chelsea defender, who sported a \u201819\u2019 on his armband in tribute to the former Fulham and Portsmouth midfielder. \u201cThe anniversary of Papa\u2019s death was important for us and his family. We wanted to do him proud and pay homage to him. He made me dream as a boy. This wasn\u2019t something we wanted to let slip. I saw the videos his family posted of him. It really hit home.\u201d\nEcuador had played with freedom and creativity in their opening two matches to leave themselves needing a draw. And perhaps that was their problem. Here Gustavo Alfaro\u2019s team had something to lose, and the vibrancy was nowhere to be seen under the pressure of protecting what they had. Senegal, knowing they needed to win, were uninhibited.\nAmid a backdrop of incessant drumming from Senegal supporters, who put almost as much effort into each performance as the players do, Ciss\u00e9\u2019s side controlled the first half. They should have been ahead inside three minutes when Idrissa Gueye found himself unmarked in front of goal after Boulaye Dia and Iliman Ndiaye allowed Isma\u00efla Sarr\u2019s cross to roll into the midfielder\u2019s path. The Everton player\u2019s first-time shot sailed centimetres wide. Gueye later collected a second booking of the tournament that rules him out of the last-16 tie, and what would have been his 100th cap.\n\nDespite the importance of a clean sheet to Ecuador there was a lack of concentration in their defence throughout, and it cost them dearly just before half-time. The right-back Angelo Preciado and central defender F\u00e9lix Torres misjudged the flight of a long ball out of the Senegal defence. Sarr read it perfectly, muscling in ahead of Torres on the left and taking one touch inside the area before being clattered by a clumsy challenge from centre-half Piero Hincapi\u00e9.\nThe French referee Cl\u00e9ment Turpin pointed to the spot and Sarr, who had missed his two previous penalties at club level, stroked it confidently inside the bottom left corner with Ecuador\u2019s goalkeeper, Hern\u00e1n Gal\u00edndez, rooted to his line.\nEcuador required a change of mindset and approach for the second half and their Argentinian coach responded with a double substitution at the interval. The introduction of Jos\u00e9 Cifuentes and Brighton\u2019s Jeremy Sarmiento sparked an immediate improvement and, for the first time, Senegal were on the back foot for a sustained spell. \u00c9douard Mendy had still had nothing to do before picking the ball out of his net, however.\nThe equaliser was maddening for Ciss\u00e9 as his team switched off at a corner. Gonzalo Plata\u2019s delivery was met by the bleached blond head of Torres and fell to Caicedo, unmarked and kept onside by Youssouf Sabaly standing on the goalline at the opposite post. The Brighton midfielder tucked away a simple finish and the Senegal drums fell silent. But they were beating again within two minutes.\n\nCaicedo\u2019s moment of triumph quickly turned to despair when Gueye swung a free-kick into a crowded penalty area. The ball struck Ecuador\u2019s goalscorer on the thigh and looped up for Koulibaly to restore Senegal\u2019s precious lead with a close-range volley.\nSarmiento led Ecuador\u2019s response impressively but there was also a desperation to their pursuit of a second equaliser. Enner Valencia, the tournament\u2019s joint leading scorer alongside Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, was given no opportunity to add to his three goals in Qatar. Senegal defended superbly in the closing stages before heading into the last 16 to the sound of drums. Ecuador exited in tears. Gal\u00edndez had to be helped off his knees by two members of the backroom team. A training bib draped over the head of Caicedo could not hide his sobbing."

                    "body": "  10.23pm    Thank you very much for joining me for this cracker of a match. Have a lovely Christmas period.  Here is Jamie Jackson\u2019s match report as my present to you.      10.18pm    Andy Robertson: \u201cWe had chances, they had chances, it was quite an open game. It is disappointing to go out of the cup. \u201cWe pushed, we had good chances. These games are decided on fine margins and it went their way.  \u201cWhen we come up against City, both teams raise their games and push a wee bit further. A really difficult game to start off but it will be good for us to get it in our legs.\" \u201cIt wasn\u2019t meant to be but there were positives to take. \u201cEvery goal could have been stopped.\u201d     10.06pm    Nathan Ake: \u201cIt was good to be back. Obviously, a little bit strange. I thought it was a good game, exciting. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have too much training so it was tough in the end, a little bit of cramping.\u201d Riyad Mahrez: \u201cIt is always good to score and help the team win. I thought we were very good today. \u201cEveryone came back with a very good mentality. It was a very difficult opponent to start with but we played well.\u201d     9.56pm    Luke Jones emails: \u201cAs a Liverpool fan, I couldn\u2019t be more happy with this outcome. In this competition last year we [checks notes] won, and absolutely no one cared. We\u2019ve now been eliminated by Man City in a low quality game and we can now save some energy and make plans in January knowing that we don\u2019t have to mess around with this cup this season.\u201d     9.54pm    De Bruyne sinks to his knees at full time, a sign of how much hard work was required for City to win that tonight.      9.53pm   Full time: Manchester City 3-2 Liverpool  A cracking return for domestic football after the World Cup. City were certainly the slicker side but Liverpool gave it everything. De Bruyne was utterly superb.   Updated at 9.59pm GMT    9.50pm    90+2 mins: Keita slips the ball through for Nunez to chase but Ortega comes out bravely to claim, taking a clattering from Laporte in the process.   Updated at 9.57pm GMT    9.48pm    90 mins: Four minutes for Liverpool to find an equaliser.      9.46pm    88 mins: Laporte sends the ball out for a throw-in because Gundogan is down on the deck. Bernardo Silva is coming on to replace his colleague.      9.44pm    86 mins: Stones leads the charge up the pitch for City before laying the ball into Mahrez. Fabnho reads it and gets back to dispossess the Algerian, even though Mahrez thinks it is a foul.      9.43pm    84 mins: De Bruyne whacks a shot from the edge of the box that is cleared off the line by Fabinho. The rebound reaches Foden but his volley is well-saved by Kelleher. Keita is booked for a challenge from behind on Lewis.   Updated at 9.52pm GMT    9.40pm    82 mins: De Bruyne swings in a cross for Rodri to attack but the Spaniard clatters into the goalkeeper. A free-kick is awarded but there is nothing sinister in it.  Wayne Rooney is the building.      9.39pm    80 mins: Robertson goes in hard on Lewis inside the box but the Liverpool man gets the ball, even if the City full-back thinks he\u2019s been wronged.      9.37pm    79 mins: IT\u2019S ALL KICKING OFF! Rodri and Fabinho have a good push and shove, leaving the Brazilian on the ground after Gundogan \u2013 and a few others \u2013 gets involved. Both Rodri and Fabinho are booked.   Updated at 9.43pm GMT    9.35pm    77 mins: The tempo has understandably dropped in the past couple of minutes after such an intense game.     9.34pm    75 mins: De Bruyne drives through the middle and slips a pass to Grealish who tries to go round Gomez but the defender holds his ground and forces the City man to dribble it out of play.      9.31pm    72 mins: Gomez slides the ball through for Nunez to latch onto. He takes the ball into the area and has plenty of time to pick his spot but once again drags his shot wide. That\u2019s his third great chance of the match. Grealish and Foden replace Haaland and Palmer.   Updated at 9.44pm GMT    9.28pm    70 mins: Keita is the fifth change for Liverpool, replacing Thiago.      9.27pm    68 mins: Robertson looks to pick out Oxlade-Chamberlain in the box but Laporte gets across to remove the danger.  Moments later, Oxlade-Chamberlain does get hold of the ball in the box and goes down under pressure from Ake. The Liverpool midfielder wants a penalty but the referee is not interested. There is no VAR to check but I am not sure the decision would have been overturned.      9.24pm    66 mins: A cross from the right by Henderson is flicked out to the onrushing Robertson but his shot is wayward and flies over the bar.  Grealish is readying himself to come on.      9.22pm    64 mins: De Bruyne swings a pass straight out of play. That\u2019s not like him.      9.21pm    62 mins: A poor Kelleher pass out is intercepted and City come straight back at Liverpool. The ball is played through for Haaland but the goalkeeper redeems himself by coming out to claim at the striker\u2019s feet. \u201cWhy are you as a Manc allowed to report on this game?\u201d asks Steve, from Liverpool. \u201cEmbarrassing lad.\u201d Always nice to get feedback.      9.18pm    60 mins: Just before the goal, Henderson replaced Elliott. Liverpool have already made four changes.  City are bringing on Stones for Akanji.     9.17pm   GOAL! Manchester City 3-2 Liverpool (Ake, 58)  De Bruyne plays a short corner to Palmer, who sends it back to his teammate to curl to the back post where Ake is waiting to head across Kelleher and into the corner.    Updated at 9.26pm GMT    9.14pm    56 mins: Elliott leads Liverpool up the pitch, he lays it off to Gomez, who heads down the right wing but his cross is straight at Ortega.      9.12pm    54 mins: Still looks like City are the more composed on the ball. They move it quickly across the pitch to Palmer inside the area; he takes a touch but his shot is wild.      9.10pm    52 mins: De Bruyne swings in a corner from the right but it is easily cleared to Salah, who goes one v one with Lewis. Thankfully for City, the right-back gets the better of the Liverpool forward on the halfway to stop him breaking away.      9.08pm    50 mins: This is all very exciting. Isn\u2019t it good to have domestic football back?      9.06pm   GOAL! Manchester City 2-2 Liverpool (Salah, 48)  That did not take long. Nunez gets in down the left, outpacing Laporte before slipping the ball across to Salah to tap home.    Updated at 9.17pm GMT    9.05pm   GOAL! Manchester City 2-1 Liverpool (Mahrez, 47)  Rodri lifts the ball to Mahrez on the edge of the box, he takes a wonderful first touch and curls the ball into the corner with his left foot.    Updated at 9.16pm GMT    9.03pm   Second half  Here we go again!     9.03pm    So is Oxlade-Chamberlain, with Carvalho going off.     9.02pm    Fabinho is coming on for Bajcetic.     9.02pm    \u201cIf you\u2019re in the market for obscure football related baubles to hang on your tree,\u201d says K\u00e1ri Tulinius, \u201cthen let me point you to the decorative ornaments of \u00der\u00f3ttur Vogum, which even though it\u2019s probably the third best known team named \u00der\u00f3ttur in Iceland, did once have Hermann Hrei\u00f0arson as its manager, and David James as an assistant manager for a short spell. You\u2019ll have to email them to see if they have any left, but here\u2019s a picture: https://throtturvogum.is/fallegar-throttara-jolakulur-til-solu-takmarkad-magn/\u201d I\u2019ll take 10.      8.56pm    \u201cThe way Haaland can finish in the air with his feet is Zlatanesque,\u201d says Joe Pearson. Maybe they are both martial arts experts.      8.47pm    Justin Kavanagh repeats what we all know: \u201cThat Haaland is clinical, but he\u2019s no Wout Weghorst.\u201d   Updated at 8.53pm GMT    8.47pm   Half time: Manchester City 1-1 Liverpool  City should have scored at least one more but then let Liverpool back in thanks to a defensive lapse. De Bruyne has been excellent for City, which will worry Liverpool and everyone else in England.      8.45pm    45 mins: Two minutes added on.      8.44pm    44 mins: Haaland receives a pass from De Bruyne, he takes a touch and runs at Phillips. The Liverpool defender holds his nerve and performs a perfect challenge in the area to dispossess Haaland.   Updated at 9.04pm GMT    8.42pm    42 mins: Nunez beats the offside trap to reach a Gomez pass, he allows the ball to bounces and drive a shot across goal but it goes wide.      8.40pm    40 mins: De Bruyne swings in a cross from the left but it is just too far ahead of Mahrez. De Bruyne\u2019s crossing has been superb tonight.      8.38pm    38 mins: De Bruyne swings in a glorious curling cross from the right; there are three blue shirts waiting for it but Ake is the one to get his head on the ball, although his effort lacks power and Kelleher palms away. Milner, after a tough 38 minutes, is replaced by Phillips. I suspect Gomez will move to right-back.   Updated at 8.45pm GMT    8.36pm    36 mins: De Bruyne latches onto a Mahrez flick on, he gets into the box and pulls the ball back to Gundogan who shoots straight at Kelleher\u2019s legs.  Bajcetic goes into the book for pulling back Palmer.      8.34pm    34 mins: Colin Stevens emails: \u201cSurprised that City still have tickets available for sale for the Chelsea game in two weeks. That\u2019s according to the pitchside adverts. You\u2019d expect such a big game as that to be sold out by now.\u201d The third round of the FA Cup is not the draw it used to be. The tickets are quite expense at a time when people cannot afford extras.      8.32pm    32 mins: City do seem to be targeting Milner at right-back. Palmer has shown him a few tricks and De Bruyne always look keen to help out his younger teammate by providing an overlap.   Updated at 8.36pm GMT    8.30pm    30 mins: City have continued to dominate possession since the equaliser but without the gusto they started the match with.  Palmer gets down the left and taps the ball to De Bruyne but his cross is, again, straight at Kelleher.      8.28pm    28 mins: Mahrez drills a corner to Palmer on the edge of the box to shoot first time but it hits a mass of Liverpool shirts and goes out for a throw-in.  Palmer then wins a free-kick on the left touchline thanks to a Milner foul. De Bruyne whips it straight into Kelleher\u2019s arms.      8.26pm    26 mins: Salah chases a pass over the defence, going shoulder to shoulder with Ake but the Egyptian pulls his opponent back to end the attack.      8.24pm    24 mins: Palmer sends a cross along the six-yard line but Haaland does not anticipate where it will land, meaning he fails to make contact to score a second.   Updated at 8.33pm GMT    8.22pm    22 mins: City allowed Milner and Carvalho to have acres of space there as they switched off mentally. They need to up things once again.      8.20pm   GOAL! Manchester City 1-1 Liverpool (Carvalho, 20)  I did not see that coming. Matip brings the ball forward before slipping it to Milner in the box, allowing him to cross to Carvalho to sweep home from 12 yards.    Updated at 8.25pm GMT    8.18pm    18 mins: Liverpool seem eager to pass the ball round at the back but they keep getting caught in possession. They do not look recharged by the break, that\u2019s for sure.      8.16pm    16 mins: Elliott gets into space on the right, allowing him to cross for Nunez to sweep at shot at goal. The Uruguayan\u2019s effort hits the post but the offside flag is up regardless.  \u201cIf any cross to Haaland is accurate it seems almost impossible to stop without fouling,\u201d emails Mary Waltz. \u201cHe is bigger stronger, quicker, jumps higher then almost any defender.\u201d     8.14pm    14 mins: Haaland and De Bruyne certainly look on it tonight. Both have a point to prove. Haaland because he\u2019s had a few weeks off and De Bruyne due to Belgium\u2019s poor World Cup.     8.12pm    12 minutes: Haaland just knows where the ball is going to end up when De Bruyne is in possession. Gomez drifted off, allowing the striker the inch of space he required to score.  Palmer drives into the box and pulls the ball back from the byline but Gomez is in the right place to block the cross. City are utterly dominant. Milner is struggling at right-back.      8.11pm   GOAL! Manchester City 1-0 Liverpool (Haaland, 10)  De Bruyne crosses from the left for Haaland to volley home from eight yards. A classic of the genre.    Updated at 8.17pm GMT    8.08pm    8 mins: City have started the better, they look more intense and slicker but Liverpool look decent on the break.   Updated at 8.10pm GMT    8.07pm    6 mins: Haaland breaks down the right into space, takes the ball into the box and lays it on a plate for Palmer, who cannot sort his feet out when six yards out and sends it a mile wide. What a dreadful finish.      8.04pm    4 mins: City seem to have spent the past few days planning to press Liverpool all over the pitch. This could be a test of everyone\u2019s fitness after so long without a competitive game.  De Bruyne\u2019s cross is deflected behind by Carvalho. Corner to City \u2026     8.02pm    2 mins: Haaland should score within the opening 17 seconds. Gundogan splits the centre-backs allowing Haaland to go through, Kelleher comes to the edge of the box, forcing the Norwegian to chip him but he sends it well over the empty net.  Liverpool go immediately down the other end; Nunez makes it into the box but Laporte gets across to block.      8.00pm   Kick-off  Peep! Peep! Peep! Here we go!     7.57pm    Scott Blair emails: \u201cI\u2019ve not been able to track down their online shop yet, but I\u2019ll be surprised if FC Santa Claus don\u2019t have some sort of tree-suitable merch. \u201cFC Santa Claus is a football club from Rovaniemi, Finland that currently plays in the Vitonen, the sixth tier of the Finnish football league system. The club has played as high as the third tier Kakkonen, where they have played a total of 14 seasons. They were nearly promoted to the second-tier Ykk\u00f6nen but lost their promotion playoff match to HIFK in 2010. The club plays at the Saarenkyl\u00e4n Stadion.\u201d Sort your merch out, Santa.     7.55pm    There is a jazzy light show at the Etihad. It\u2019s been raining all day in Manchester, so it should zip around (if it hadn\u2019t rained, they would just water the pitch).     7.52pm    Joe Pearson has some bad news for himself: \u201cI hope I am as fit as Milner when I\u2019m 36! Oh wait, I\u2019m already 65. Crap!\u201d I am 35 and I face an uphill battle to be at Milner\u2019s level in 12 months. I have no idea why. *pours pint*     7.47pm    I am sat next to my Christmas tree which includes Borussia Dortmund, 1860 Munich and Athletic Bilbao baubles. I\u2019ve been searching for similarly niche ones to add to the collection but they are tricky to find.      7.40pm    Pep Guardiola. How was break? \u201cGood.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t have many other options. The players that are playing is because they have to. \u201cWe had three days with mainly the players that are going to play today.  \u201cEvery game he [Rico] can play is good for him. We have a lot of confidence in him. Playing against one of the best opponents possible is good for him.\u201d     7.35pm    I wasn\u2019t supposed to be on this MBM but my in-laws have arrived two days early for Christmas, so I kindly agreed to move my shift to stay busy this evening. I am a giver.      7.31pm    Liverpool want to lay down a marker tonight, as implied by Klopp earlier. After a subpar first half to the season, they will be desperate to show they are at City\u2019s level.      7.26pm    \u201cI see Liverpool have a couple of young\u2019uns in tonight,\u201d emails Martin Jachnik. \u201cBajetic and Milner, well the latter is forever young.\u201d Milner: one of the great men.     7.20pm    Jurgen Klopp on what he\u2019s been doing in the break: \u201cTraining, regaining the things that make us strong on the pitch.\u201d On team selection: \u201cThat\u2019s all good, we play mainly with the players who had the break apart from Bobby Firmino, who was injured two days ago in training.\u201d \u201cAll the others [who went to the World Cup] could have played.\u201d On Salah: \u201cHe\u2019s been exceptional. From the first second he\u2019s been there.\u201d   Updated at 7.48pm GMT    7.13pm    It is time for some respect. It is the time of year for forgiveness or some nonsense.       7.05pm    City start with six players who were at the World Cup but all of their England internationals are on the bench. Liverpool start with Bajcetic in midfield. He could be set for an interesting evening up against Rodri, De Bruyne and Gundogan.      7.02pm   Starting lineups  Manchester City: Ortega Moreno; Lewis, Akanji, Laporte, Ake; Rodrigo, De Bruyne, Gundogan; Mahrez, Haaland, Palmer Substitutes: Carson, Walker, Stones, Cancelo, Grealish, Gomez, Bernardo, Foden, Robertson Liverpool: Kelleher; Milner, Gomez, Matip, Robertson; Elliott, Bajcetic, Thiago; Salah, Nunez, Carvalho. Substitutes: Adrian, Fabinho, Keita, Henderson, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Tsimikas, Ramsay, Phillips, Doak      7.00pm   Hello  The biggest rivalry in English football over recent years is back in Carabao Cup form. Neither team has played 90 minutes in anger since November, so might not welcome being thrust back into action against one of the best teams in Europe. It will be wonderful to see Erling Haaland back on the pitch after avoiding a trip to Qatar and he will immediately need to be at his best with a point to prove against Liverpool following a couple of quiet performances in matches with Jurgen Klopp\u2019s side. Pep Guardiola has indicated his eagerness to win the Champions League, so this competition might not be at the top of his priority list but he certainly will not want to go out at home against a rival. The buildup to the match has focused on the two clubs trying to patch up their relationship after a few years of throwing stuff at players and vehicles. A Carabao Cup tie might be the calming influence everyone needs to avoid a bit of aggro. Let\u2019s hope it\u2019s a cracking game. Kick-off: 8pm GMT  "

                    "body": "Happy Friday \u2013 and a warning to be careful as Covid cases shoot up in New South Wales and Victoria. There were a combined 48,267 new infections in the last reporting period, which means more hospitalisations and more deaths \u2013 46 people died in Victoria and 39 in NSW, according to the latest weekly data.\nWe\u2019re unlikely to see society-wide mask mandates, at least that\u2019s what the federal health minister said today, but health experts are still urging masks be worn in indoor settings where safe physical distancing is impossible.\nAnd who wants to be stuck with the virus this holiday season, after the last two Covid-spoiled Christmases?\nTop news\n\n\nCovid surging | NSW Health upgraded its Covid-19 risk rating to amber in response to the surge, meaning masks must be worn in all hospital areas. The federal health minister, Mark Butler, is hoping the current wave will peak around Christmas, but says there is \u201cno evidence\u201d statewide mask mandates will be issued over the course of this wave.\nAlbanese and Macron\u2019s non-rift | Anthony Albanese denied there was a rift with Emmanuel Macron, after the French president said Australia\u2019s Aukus submarine deal risked a \u201cnuclear confrontation\u201d. The PM shrugged off the remarks, saying Australia \u201chas not decided to change strategy on the submarines\u201d and Macron was \u201centitled to put forward the views he does in a very forthright way\u201d.\nTwitter turmoil | Hundreds of Twitter employees have responded to Elon Musk\u2019s ultimatum to work \u201clong hours at high intensity\u201d or leave with three months\u2019 severance pay by \u2026 leaving. Twitter later announced it was closing its offices and disabling employee badge access until Monday. Musk is now said to be trying to convince top employees to stay, with concerns among Twitter users that the site might simply shut down if there are too few employees left to run it.\nTrumpist rejects results | Kari Lake, a pro-Trump election denier, is refusing to concede the Arizona governor race to Democratic rival Katie Hobbs. Lake made election denialism a centrepiece of her campaign and, in consistent form, posted a short video rejecting the results, saying \u201cour election officials failed us miserably\u201d.\n\n\n\nPelosi steps down | Nancy Pelosi, the first woman to lead the House of Representatives, is stepping down from leadership to make way for a new generation. The 82-year-old congresswoman from California has led the Democrats in the House under four presidents \u2013 George W Bush, Barack Obama, Donald Trump and Joe Biden. The decision comes less than a month after an intruder entered her San Francisco home and attacked her husband, Paul, with a hammer.\nNorth Korea ICBM | Australia has joined Japan in condemning a North Korean intercontinental ballistic missile launch, which landed in Japan\u2019s exclusive economic zone. The launch came a day after North Korea fired a short-range ballistic missile while warning of \u201cfiercer military responses\u201d to US efforts to boost its security presence in the region. Albanese said Pyongyang needs to \u201cstop their aggression\u201d.\nQantas appeal | The high court will re-examine whether Qantas unlawfully outsourced almost 1,700 ground handlers, after justices today allowed the appeal to proceed. Qantas lost a federal court appeal in May upholding a decision that found the airline had illegally outsourced the workers in 2020. Qantas recently returned to profitability after its pandemic slump, with the chief executive, Alan Joyce, walking away with $2.27m in the last financial year and another $9m of bonus shares.\n\n\n\nTwo new galaxies | Nasa\u2019s James Webb telescope has found two of the oldest and most distant galaxies ever seen. Launched last December as a successor to Hubble, the Webb telescope is indicating stars may have formed sooner than previously thought. One of the galaxies is said to have formed only 350m years after the big bang.\nAFL Tasmania team | Good news for footy fans in Tasmania. The state government and the AFL have reached an in-principle agreement on commercial terms for a new team, announced today in Hobart. The Tasmanian government has agreed to fund $12m a year over 12 years, plus $60m towards a high-performance and administration complex. There was no commitment from the AFL, however, to a timeline for a final decision.\n\nFull Story\n\nIs the cost-of-living crisis really a wages crisis?\nInflation is soaring, wages are plummeting, Australians\u2019 living standards are falling and corporations are raking in the profits. But is lifting wages the only fix to the cost-of-living crisis? Our editors discuss in this 21-minute episode.\n\nWhat they said \u2026\n\n***\n\u201cIf you\u2019re still in parliament next year, I want a personal date with you in your office or my house \u2026 I\u2019ve had a gutful.\u201d \u2013 Peter Jones, a Eugowra resident\nThe former police officer got emotional when he confronted the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, over the response to a flash-flooding \u201ctsunami\u201d that devastated the central west town.

                    "body": "  9.16pm    Nick Ames\u2019 match report has landed, so I\u2019ll leave you with that. Goodnight!      9.08pm    \u201cWhy are the CONCACAF teams so bad?\u201d asks Kurt Perlerberg.  I\u2019m not sure they are \u2013 Canada were fantastic against Belgium and the USA have played pretty well in both games. Mexico and Costa Rica, not so much.     9.08pm    We\u2019re just seeing replays of the two goals. They were both so classy \u2013 not just the finishes but the touch (or in Fernandez\u2019s case the shimmy) to set themselves up.       9.04pm    And now for something completely different      9.03pm    \u201cHow are Mexico so bad?\u201d says Adam Hirst. \u201cEven for football\u2019s great underachievers, they\u2019ve underachieved here.\u201d I thought Lozano and Vega looked pretty bright up front, but for a lot of the game the formation was almost 8-0-2. They really missed Edson Alvarez in midfield as well. But yeah, this is the worst Mexican team I\u2019ve seen at a World Cup, although I wasn\u2019t there in 1954.     9.00pm    Here\u2019s how Group C looks  Poland 4pts, GD+2 Argentina 3pts, GD+1 Saudi Arabia 3pts, GD-1 Mexico 1pt, GD-2  The final games are Poland v Argentina and Saudi Arabia v Mexico.  Poland need a draw, though they could go through with a defeat Argentina need a win to be sure, though they could go through with a draw Saudi Arabia need a win to be sure, though they could go through with a draw Mexico need a win to have any chance     8.58pm   Full time: Argentina 2-0 Mexico  Peep peep! Argentina are still in the World Cup. It was an ugly victory secured by two beauteous second-half goals from Lionel Messi and Enzo Fernandez. It was a desperate game, and Kylian Mbappe won\u2019t be losing any sleep, but they did the necessary and that was by far the most important thing. Mexico aren\u2019t out of the competition yet, but their toothless performance suggests they will struggle to keep up their record of qualifying for the last 16 in every World Cup since 1994.   Updated at 9.25pm GMT    8.55pm    90+4 min Messi is lucky not to be booked for a poor tackle on Moreno.     8.52pm    90+2 min Six minutes of added time. They could play for six millenniums and Mexico wouldn\u2019t score.     8.52pm    90+1 min If Argentina beat Poland on Wednesday, they\u2019ll go through \u2013 probably as group winners, which would mean avoiding France in the last 16. If they draw, they\u2019ll be at the mercy of the result in the other game.     8.50pm    90 min Alvarado is booked for taking his frustration out on Otamendi\u2019s face.      8.50pm    Argentina took a short corner on the left and fed the ball into Fernandez on the left corner of the area. He beat Gutierrez through sleight of hip, then shaped an extravagant curling shot across goal. It beat the leaping Ochoa and nestled in the far corner.  Updated at 9.10pm GMT    8.48pm   GOAL! Argentina 2-0 Mexico (Fernandez 87)  Enzo Fernandez seals victory \u2013 and gives Argentina a potentially crucial goal-difference boost \u2013 with another beautiful goal!   Updated at 9.02pm GMT    8.47pm    86 min Argentina break promisingly but De Paul\u2019s heavy touch allows Gallardo to nip it in the bud.     8.46pm    85 min Corner to Mexico on the left. Chavez curls it to the near post, Romero heads clear. Mexico have been so poor.     8.43pm    82 min Chavez\u2019s inswinging free-kick from the right is headed across the area by an Argentina defender then back across goal by Moreno. It\u2019s too close to Emi Martinez, who claims comfortably.     8.42pm    81 min Although they are having a lot of the ball now, Mexico look pretty toothless.     8.40pm    79 min Not that Argentina will or should care, but this has been a hideous game.  Updated at 8.40pm GMT    8.38pm    77 min Palacios releases Alvarez down the left. He charges into the area and cuts the ball back towards Messi, who can\u2019t quite ther before the defender. Moments later Messi\u2019s cutback is kicked away by Ochoa.  Updated at 8.39pm GMT    8.36pm    74 min Mexico have been slightly better since the goal, though in truth they don\u2019t particularly look like scoring. It\u2019s been their problem since World Cup qualification began in September 2021.     8.34pm    73 min Mexico bring off Hirving Lozano, which is a bit of a surprise. Roberto Alvarado is on in his place.     8.33pm    72 min Goal difference may also be a factor, so a second Argentina goal could be deceptively significant.     8.33pm    72 min If it stays like this, Argentina could qualify with a draw against Poland on Wednesday, depending on the result in Saudi Arabia v Mexico. It\u2019s all pretty complex. Mexico won\u2019t be out if they lose either.     8.31pm    70 min Acuna\u2019s cross finds its way through to Molina, who slashes over from the edge of the area. That was half a chance.     8.31pm         8.30pm    69 min: Double substitution for Argentina Cristian Romero, who was supposed to be injured, and Ezequiel Palacios replace Alexis Mac Allister and Angel Di Maria. That might mean a switch to a back five.     8.29pm    68 min Antuna plays a one-two and threads a low cross that is booted behind. No matter, Antuna was offside.     8.28pm    67 min Hector Herrera is booked for a cynical foul.     8.28pm    66 min Double substitution for Mexico: Raul Jimenez and Uriel Antuna replace Alexis Vega and Kevin Alvarez. That means a switch to a back four.     8.27pm    65 min The finish was unerringly precise but the touch to set it up was even better. Any lighter and he wouldn\u2019t have been able to get sufficient momentum into the shot; any heavier and he\u2019d have been smothered by the outrushing defenders.  Updated at 8.29pm GMT    8.26pm    It was a goal out of nothing. Di Maria cut inside from the right and shaped a good pass into Messi, inexplicably unmarked 25 yards from goal. His first touch was perfect, setting himself up for the shot, and he rifled a low drive into the bottom corner. That\u2019s a lovely goal.   Updated at 8.32pm GMT    8.25pm   GOAL! Argentina 1-0 Mexico (Yep 64)  Lionel Messi puts Argentina in front!   Updated at 8.30pm GMT    8.25pm    64 min \u201cI don\u2019t think that any World Cup matches of the modern era have been played in filthy rain and mud, but it would improve this one immeasurably,\u201d says Charles Antaki. \u201c Also dense fog.\u201d     8.24pm    63 min: Double substitution for Argentina Julian Alvarez and Nahuel Molina replace Lautaro Martinez and Gonzalo Montiel.     8.23pm    62 min A draw is a better result for Mexico, and that\u2019s reflected in the balance of play. Mexico are playing almost exclusively on the counter-attack now.     8.21pm    60 min A booming free-kick from Vega is headed away really well by Otamendi, running towards his own goal. The second half has been a bit better, even if we\u2019ve still had only one shot on target in the whole game.     8.20pm    59 min Messi stabs a dangerous through pass towards Lautaro Martinez that is well read by Araujo. There\u2019s no eye in the Mexican needle.     8.18pm    57 min: Argentina substitution Enzo Fernandez replaces Guido Rodriguez.     8.17pm    57 min This is a decent spell for Argentina, probably their best of the match.     8.17pm    56 min Di Maria gets round the back on the right and pulls the ball back dangerously. Mac Allister, arriving late in the box, is about to shoot when Chavez makes a vital interception.  Updated at 8.18pm GMT    8.15pm    54 min There\u2019s a bit more intensity from Argentina in this half, but not as much as you\u2019d expect in the circumstances. They look like a team who had a pamper at half-time rather than a hairdryer.     8.14pm    53 min \u201cBoxing is a notoriously difficult sport to exit on a high but two British fighters managed it this century,\u201d says Max Williams. \u201cCarl Froch knocked out George Groves at Wembley Stadium (in front of 80,000 people, supposedly) and Lennox Lewis resisted the temptation of a rematch with Vitali Klitschko after beating the Ukrainian challenger (and 2022 war hero) via a slightly fortuitous TKO. Both retired as world champions \u2013 undisputed in the case of Lewis.\u201d Ah yes, Froch is a perfect example \u2013 the last punch of his career was also the best.     8.12pm    52 min It\u2019s a poor free-kick from Messi, clipped well over the bar.     8.12pm    51 min The free-kick is slightly to the right of centre, maybe 22 yards from goal. In other words, the perfect position for a left-footed genius.     8.11pm    50 min A sudden, thrilling burst from Messi, who scurries to the edge of the D and is taken out by Gutierrez. He\u2019s booked.  Updated at 8.12pm GMT    8.09pm    48 min The referee ignores a dive from Lautaro Martinez and Mexico break. Lozano cuts inside and hits a long-range shot that is blocked.     8.06pm    46 min Peep peep! Argentina begin the second half. If it stays like this, they\u2019ll need to beat Poland by at least two goals to be sure of reaching the last 16. And Mexico would need to beat Saudi Arabia by any score to progress.  Updated at 8.08pm GMT    8.05pm    Your nominations for people who did got out at the top Rocky Marciano, Steffi Graf, Bjorn Borg, Pete Sampras, Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath, Didier Deschamps, Garry Kasparov, Basil Fawlty.     8.04pm    \u201cThe first half in summary,\u201d writes Richard Byrne.      8.02pm    \u201cI have a rough and ready way of judging which team is on top by adding the attempts on and off target and the corners, then subtracting the fouls,\u201d says Richard Hirst. \u201cI think this is the first time I\u2019ve ever known both teams have a negative total.\u201d     7.57pm    \u201cI bought a 65-inch new telly to watch this twaddle,\u201d says Paul. \u201cThis game has sent my wife and the cat to sleep.\u201d  Fifa have got some nerve scheduling a World Cup during Black Friday.     7.54pm    \u201cMexico playing five across the back when Argentina have the ball and two defensive mids in front of that, giving Messi no spaces to run into and forcing him deeper,\u201d says Rick McGahey. \u201cMartino knows his opponent.\u201d There\u2019s no eye in the Mexican needle, that\u2019s for sure. I\u2019m surprised Argentina haven\u2019t looked for their full-backs more.     7.53pm    Half-time reading      7.52pm   Half time: Argentina 0-0 Mexico  That was probably the worst 45 minutes of the tournament, but the tension and importance of the game made it must-see TV. There was only one shot on target, a free-kick from the lively Alexis Vega that was saved comfortably by Emi Martinez. See you soon for the second half.   Updated at 8.07pm GMT    7.51pm    45+6 min Di Maria gives it to Messi, who plays in the overlapping left-back Acuna. He hammers a dangerous low cross that is put behind at the near post. That was good defending, even if I\u2019m not sure whodunnit.     7.50pm    45+5 min Vega smashes a half-volley into orbit from about 25 yards. He\u2019s a confident boy.     7.49pm    45+3 min \u201cThis match,\u201d says Chris Holborn, \u201creminds me of West Ham under David Moyes this season except for the sombreros.\u201d There\u2019s more of a fedora culture at the London Stadium isn\u2019t there.     7.48pm    45+2 min Messi reminds us of his presence by, er, fouling Gutierrez. He looks thoroughly hacked off.      7.47pm    45+2 \u201cSurely if we\u2019re talking about people who\u2019ve gone out on top, Ash Barty\u2019s a shoo-in?\u201d writes Charan. \u201cWinning a grand slam then retiring at the grand old age of 25 is probably the way to do it.\u201d     7.46pm    45+1 min There will be five minutes of added tension.  Updated at 7.46pm GMT    7.45pm    45 min Vega curls a good free-kick over the wall, and Emi Martinez flies to his right to make a fairly majestic \u2013 and camera-friendly \u2013 two-handed catch.   Updated at 7.46pm GMT    7.44pm    43 min The substitute Gutierrez is fouled 25 yards from goal by Montiel, who is booked. It was an absurd tackle, an agricultural hack to the shins when Gutierrez got to a loose ball first.  Updated at 7.44pm GMT    7.42pm    41 min: Mexico substitution Ah, this is sad. Andreas Guardado, who has played in every World Cup since 2006, is going off injured. He\u2019s replaced by Erick Gutierrez.     7.41pm    41 min The corner is taken short to Di Maria, whose inswinging cross is headed wretchedly high and wide by Lautaro Martinez. He\u2019d been penalised for a push, so it wouldn\u2019t have counted, but it was a really poor header.     7.40pm    40 min Montiel\u2019s cross goes behind for a corner. Since you asked, Messi has done nothing, but really that applies to all the attacking players. Lozano has looked quite bright for Mexico; that\u2019s about it.      7.40pm    39 min \u201cRegarding the 9th minute, really, who does go out on top?\u201d says Travis Giblin. \u201cI\u2019ll nominate Zidane, but maybe that wasnt quite the definition of \u2018the top\u2019 that Nick Parmenter is looking for.\u201d It\u2019s fascinatingly rare in all sports. Even utter geniuses like Don Bradman, Usain Bolt and Phil Taylor couldn\u2019t manage it. Zidane wins the David Chase award for best on-my-terms ending.     7.38pm    37 min See 27 min, apart from the bit about the cross. It\u2019s rubbish.     7.37pm    36 min Lisandro Martinez goes down holding his face. This time, with good reason: Lozano accidentally booted him in the jaw. Teak-tough 5ft 9ins defender that he is, Martinez is fine to continue.     7.36pm    34 min Messi swings it under the crossbar, where Ochoa punches the ball up in the air. He goes for the second ball, feels a bit of contact from a Martinez, don\u2019t ask me which one, and goes down. It was probably a foul to be fair.  I\u2019ve just realised that Ochoa is dressed like a Nathan Barley character.      7.34pm    33 min De Paul is fouled by Vega on the right wing, close to the corner flag. Messi wanders over to get involved\u2026     7.32pm    32 min I can\u2019t wait to hear Roy Keane\u2019s views on this at half-time. He\u2019ll be reaching for the sh-word, and I don\u2019t mean shithousery.  Updated at 7.33pm GMT    7.31pm    31 min Nothing\u2019s happening. It\u2019s a great occasion let down only by the football.     7.31pm    29 min \u201cJust want to remind all Argentina fans that if Argentina draw this match, they will definitely meet the French in the last 16,\u201d writes Anis Aslaam. \u201cThat\u2019s assuming that they can defeat Poland first.\u201d Good point. Maybe, as Zafar wrote in the 23rd minute, it is 2018 all over again.     7.29pm    28 min Messi heads miles over from Acuna\u2019s cross, but it wouldn\u2019t have counted as Acuna had already been penalised for plunging his studs into Alvarez\u2019s leg. It was accidental, I think.     7.28pm    28 min The player of the match so far is this little rascal.      7.27pm    27 min Kevin Alvarez hoofs a cross straight out of play. In terms of quality and entertainment, this is muck. In terms of tension and importance, it\u2019s exquisite.     7.26pm    26 min \u201cThis,\u201d says Alexandra Fullerton, \u201cis like watching Costa Rica...\u201d CR7, as they\u2019re now known.  Updated at 7.30pm GMT    7.25pm    25 min After good play from Messi and De Paul (I think), Montiel\u2019s first-time cross drifts out of play beyond the far post. He was offside anyway.     7.23pm    23 min \u201cCould it be that Argentina are simply not very good?\u201d says Zafar. \u201cThis looks very much like the 2018 team.\u201d It could indeed, though I suppose the 2018 team didn\u2019t go 35 games without defeat. They haven\u2019t looked good so far, that\u2019s for sure; their passing has been especially poor.  Updated at 7.23pm GMT    7.23pm    22 min Araujo is booked for a lunge at Acuna. He got the ball but followed through, studs up, so it was a fair decision.     7.21pm    21 min Mexico try a training-ground free-kick, but the final ball is too close to Emi Martinez.     7.20pm    20 min The effervescent Lozano wriggles away from Otamendi and is fouled. Free-kick to Mexico, 30 yards from goal\u2026     7.20pm    19 min It\u2019s tense. It was always going to be tense. Apart from the first 4-5 minutes, Argentina have struggled to keep the ball.     7.18pm    18 min There\u2019s some nascent shithousery, with a few players making the most of any contact. Guardado runs into Lautaro Martinez, shoulder-first, and goes down holding his head.     7.16pm    16 min A terrible pass is nicked by Lozano just outside the area. He makes for goal and is well tackled by Otamendi.     7.15pm    15 min Mexico look bright, especially in transition, with Vega and Lozano playing as split strikers rather than a conventional front pair.   Updated at 7.23pm GMT    7.13pm    12 min There\u2019s a delicious intensity to this game, and Guardado and De Paul slide into an old-fashioned 50/50 with abundant relish. Both bounce straight to their feet, looking for the next one.     7.12pm    11 min A reminder that (unless I\u2019ve miscalculated), Argentina don\u2019t have to win tonight. Their fate will still be in their own hands if they draw, but they would need to beat Poland by two goals on Wednesday to be certain of going through. I think.     7.10pm    10 min Almost a chance for Mexico. An outswinging free-kick from the left is helped on and bounces past the man sliding in at the far post.     7.09pm    9 min \u201cIt\u2019s been vaguely discussed but what if Messi DOES go home early tonight?\u201d says Nick Parmenter. \u201cAlways hoped him and Ronaldo wouldn\u2019t go through the human phase of their career at the end, wanted them to retire at the very top like so few others do!\u201d Who do you think they are, Eric Cantona?     7.09pm    9 min The corner is a hot mess.     7.08pm    8 min Mexico are starting to settle into the game. Lozano makes a good run down the right and wins a corner off Lisandro Martinez.     7.07pm    7 min \u201cIt\u2019s refreshing to see that with Mac Allister in the starting XI, Argentina have Brighton-ed things up a little,\u201d says Peter Oh.     7.07pm    6 min I thought Montiel made the most of it but he was down for a fair while and is still feeling his jaw, so maybe I did him a disservice.     7.06pm    5 min Vega breaks dangerously down the left, just past the halfway line, and holds off Montiel, who goes down holding his face. The referee gives a foul, and Argentina\u2019s players ask for a card. It\u2019s not forthcoming. It was a 50/50 decision, the foul that is, and Vega would have been clear in the inside-left channel.     7.04pm    4 min A positive start from Argentina, who have had most of the possession in the early doors. The noise in the stadium is incredible.   Updated at 7.47pm GMT    7.03pm    3 min \u201cHas anyone actually ever seen Ochoa play for a club side?\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cI\u2019ve heard stories, there are Wikipedia entries, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s all propaganda. He only plays for the national side, and almost all of his appearances are at the World Cup. He\u2019ll definitely be there in 2026, and he\u2019ll still be 37.\u201d He spent three years at Ajaccio, and you couldn\u2019t make that up.     7.00pm    1 min Peeeeeeeeeeeeep peeeeeeeeeeeeep! Mexico kick off from right to left as we watch.  Updated at 7.00pm GMT    6.59pm         6.57pm    Surely Argentina can\u2019t go out of the World Cup inside the first week. We\u2019re about to find out.     6.56pm    Opinions are like foibles      6.55pm    Here come the players. With profuse apologies to Qatar v Ecuador, this feels like the first huge occasion of the World Cup. The atmosphere is spectacular.  Updated at 6.57pm GMT    6.50pm    A reminder of the teams Argentina (possible 4-4-2) E Martinez; Montiel, Otamendi, Lisandro Martinez, Acuna; Di Maria, De Paul, Rodriguez, Mac Allister; Messi, Lisandro Lautaro Martinez.Substitutes: Armani, Rulli, Foyth, Tagliafico, Paredes, Pezzella, Alvarez, Romero, Palacios, Correa, Almada, Gomez, Dybala, Fernandez, Molina. Mexico (possible 5-3-2) Ochoa; K Alvarez, Araujo, Montes, Moreno, Gallardo; Herrera, Chavez, Guardado; Lozano, Vega.Substitutes: Talavera, Cota, E Alvarez, Vasquez, Arteaga, Romo, Rodriguez, Jimenez, Funes Mori, Gutierrez, Pineda, Sanchez, Martin, Antuna, Alvarado Referee Daniele Orsato (Italy)     6.49pm    This happened earlier today. Doesn\u2019t sound like too much damage was done, aside from the obvious.      6.45pm    Two years ago yesterday, Diego Maradona died at the age of 60. Here\u2019s a piece on the World Cup that gave us the greatest insight into his character: Italia 90.     6.34pm    \u201cJust take it easy, Lionel\u201d \u201cI\u2019m perfectly calm, Dude\u201d \u201cYeah, making five changes after one freak result?!\u201d \u201cCalmer than you are\u201d \u201cWill you just take it easy?\u201d \u201cCalmer than you are\u201d      6.21pm    \u201cBig fan of Lisandro Martinez (surely for Otamendi rather than Romero),\u201d writes Stewart, \u201cbut asking him to play both 6 and 9 is asking a helluva lot.\u201d That was a mistake waiting to happen, and boy did I make it happen. I think Romero\u2019s injured by the way, though he is also officially on the bench.     6.20pm   The permutations  I\u2019ve probably got at least one of these wrong, because my brain ain\u2019t what it used to be, so here\u2019s a pre-emptive mea culpa. Argentina If they win tonight, a victory by any score against Poland on Wednesday night will put them through to the last 16. A draw might be enough. If they draw tonight, they will need to beat Poland \u2013 possibly by two goals, depending on the result of Saudi Arabia v Mexico \u2013 to qualify. If they lose tonight, they will be booked on flight DO 1 to Buenos Aires. Mexico If they win tonight, a draw against Saudi Arabia on Wednesday would ensure a place in the last 16. They could go through with a defeat against Saudi Arabia if Argentina beat Poland, though it would depend on goal difference. If they draw tonight, they will only qualify if they beat Saudi Arabia. If they lose tonight, they need to win against Saudi Arabia and hope Poland beat Argentina. If Poland draw with Argentina, it\u2019ll come down to goal difference.     6.20pm    Group C latest Earlier today, Poland beat Saudi Arabia 2-0 to move top of the group, and a 34-year-old man ticked something off his bucket list.      6.17pm    History corner The best part (okay, not the best part) is the dull thud when his left boot connects with the ball.       6.00pm   Team news: five changes for Argentina, no Alvarez for Mexico  Lionel Scaloni has decided to rip it up and start again, with five changes from the defeat to Saudi Arabia. Gonzalo Montiel, Lisandro Martinez, Marcos Acuna, Guido Rodriguez and Alexis Mac Allister replace Nahuel Molina, Cristian Romero, Nicolas Tagliafico, Leandro Paredes and Papu Gomez. Mexico are without the Ajax midfielder Edson Alvarez, arguably their best player. I assume he\u2019s injured, though he is officially listed among the substitutes. He\u2019s replaced by the legendary Andres Guardado, who will win his 36th cap at the age of 179. Wait, hang on. Guardado for Alvarez is one of three changes from the draw with Poland. Kevin Alvarez replaces Jorge Sanchez and Nestor Araujo is in for Henry Martin, which probably means a switch to 5-3-2. Raul Jimenez remains on the bench. Argentina (possible 4-4-2) E Martinez; Montiel, Otamendi, Lisandro Martinez, Acuna; Di Maria, De Paul, Rodriguez, Mac Allister; Messi, Lisandro Lautaro Martinez.Substitutes: Armani, Rulli, Foyth, Tagliafico, Paredes, Pezzella, Alvarez, Romero, Palacios, Correa, Almada, Gomez, Dybala, Fernandez, Molina. Mexico (possible 5-3-2) Ochoa; K Alvarez, Araujo, Montes, Moreno, Gallardo; Herrera, Chavez, Guardado; Lozano, Vega.Substitutes: Talavera, Cota, E Alvarez, Vasquez, Arteaga, Romo, Rodriguez, Jimenez, Funes Mori, Gutierrez, Pineda, Sanchez, Martin, Antuna, Alvarado Referee Daniele Orsato (Italy)   Updated at 6.43pm GMT    5.30pm   Preamble  &lt;Big Brother&gt; Day seven, and Argentina are up for eviction.&lt;/Big Brother&gt; Lionel Scaloni\u2019s Messi\u2019s side were supposed to cruise through Group C and begin their World Cup proper with a last-16 tie against Denmark and France. But their astounding, wallchart-busting defeat to Saudi Arabia on whatever day it was, there are no days of the week during the World Cup group stage means that, less than a week into the tournament, they are fighting for their metaphorical lives. The situation is simple, just like in the old days: if Argentina lose to Mexico in Lusail tonight they will be out, and Messi will never score a goal in the knockout stages of a World Cup, never mind win the thing. Argentina have gone out at the first group stage on only three occasions: 1958, 1962 and, most famously/recently, 2002, when Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s side were groupofdeathed by Sweden and England. Tonight they could be eliminated by one of their own \u2013 Tata Martino, former coach of Argentina and Barcelona among others, is in charge of Mexico. Things aren\u2019t quite as critical for his side. They won\u2019t be out if they lose tonight, though they would need a big favour from Poland on Wednesday. Mexico, as any fule kno, are supposed to reach the last 16 and go no further; that\u2019s what has happened in the last seven World Cups. They started with a watchful but not especially watchable 0-0 draw against Poland, in which Robert Lewandowski\u2019s penalty was saved by Guillermo Ochoa. Mexico\u2019s big problem is goalscoring \u2013 they managed just 17 in 14 games during qualification, and they would sell their soul to have the old, pre-skull fracture Raul Jimenez back. Kick off 7pm GMT, 10pm in Lusail, 4pm in Buenos Aires, 1pm in Mexico City.   Updated at 5.47pm GMT "

                    "body": "Gareth Southgate says England are surprised that 36,000 spectators will be allowed inside the Puskas Arena in Budapest for Saturday\u2019s match against Hungary, which is nominally being staged behind closed doors. The Nations League fixture is one of five that Hungary are required to host under sanctions, two of them suspended, after repeated misconduct from their supporters. Uefa handed down a three-game stadium closure in June for discriminatory behaviour at Euro 2020, while Fifa added two more in September after racist abuse clouded England\u2019s last visit in the World Cup qualifiers.  Hungary\u2019s 67,000-capacity ground will be more than half-full, though, after the local FA were able to exploit Uefa regulations that allow an unlimited number of under-14s to attend such games. One adult is allowed to accompany every 10 children, meaning around 3,300 could be inside the stadium. England will make use of the loophole when they serve the first of their own two-game stadium ban against Italy on 11 June, when around 3,000 children could be watching at Molineux, but the prospect of a significantly bigger crowd in Budapest has raised eyebrows. \u201cI think we\u2019re all surprised,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cBut we\u2019re inviting children into our stadium so I wasn\u2019t really clear on the rules of any of it. I don\u2019t know what the [crowd size] should or shouldn\u2019t be. We\u2019ve got to make sure we\u2019re consistent in our beliefs, the stand we take as a team, the fact we\u2019re united on [discrimination and racism] being unacceptable, and it\u2019s for other people to administer sanctions. \u201cOnce we\u2019re administering sanctions it\u2019s gone too far anyway so the key is education, and the young people in the stadium hopefully pick up that message tomorrow.\u201d There is a precedent for matches to be contested in such conditions but there is also one for them to take an unsavoury turn. When Rangers visited Sparta Prague for a Europa League tie in September 2021, the Czech club were supported by around 10,000 minors despite a two-game Uefa ban for previous racist abuse by fans. That night the Rangers midfielder Glen Kamara was booed from the stands, six months after being racially abused by Slavia Prague\u2019s Ondrej Kudela in an incident that resulted in the defender being banned for 10 games. England will hope there is no repeat of last year\u2019s events in Hungary, where Raheem Sterling and Jude Bellingham were targeted with monkey chants during their 4-0 win and players were booed for taking the knee. \u201cI would imagine Hungary will feel the same way we do about having restrictions on the home games and they won\u2019t want it to happen again,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cEverybody learns from every experience they have been through. Our players, after that, just want to focus on the football. They played incredibly well that night and want to do so again.\u201d Southgate was asked whether England, whose ban is a result of the crowd trouble at Wembley around the Euro 2020 final, are effectively being punished more than Hungary given the smaller attendance expected in Wolverhampton. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether we\u2019ve got it right ourselves, because you could say behind closed doors is behind closed doors,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat the FA recognised was that there was an opportunity to invite local football clubs, so they felt they should take that opportunity. I don\u2019t think we should spend our time and energy focusing on how other people are dealing with it. \u201cI think some of the safeguarding rules are slightly different from country to country. I know that was a bit of a concern at our place; it sounds easy to just bring schoolchildren in but that actually needs quite a big operation. We are prepared for whatever tomorrow, and it\u2019s our job to get the football right.\u201d  Southgate made it clear he expects a test closer to the one Hungary provided in October, when they held England to a 1-1 draw at Wembley, than the rout that transpired at the away fixture a month previously. He will have to plan for the game, as well as Tuesday\u2019s outing against Germany in Munich, without Phil Foden after the Manchester City player tested positive for Covid-19. There is hope Foden will have recovered for the two games in Wolverhampton, where Hungary await again after the Italy tie. Sterling has been struggling with illness and may not be involved in Budapest while the game comes too soon for Fikayo Tomori and Marc Gu\u00e9hi, who are injured. New call-ups Jarrod Bowen and James Justin are both expected to receive their first caps over the next 10 days. \u201cI won\u2019t hesitate to play them,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cThey\u2019ve both settled in really well. They have both come into the squad looking as though they want to show what they can do, rather than tentatively dipping a toe into the water and seeing how it all works. I\u2019ve seen enough from them in training to see that they can fit in.\u201d"

Updated at 3.53pm GMT    3.44pm    Great game at Craven Cottage where Sunderland are well worth their lead, Anthony Patterson somehow managing to keep out a surefire goal from Andreas Pereira to keep them in front. Duncan Culley completes a first-half hattrick as Walthamstow storm into a 3-0 lead on 38 minutes.     3.38pm   Goal! Blackburn 1-1 Birmingham (Dack )  All square at Ewood as Bradley Dack nods home from a yard out after Neil Etheridge had tipped an effort onto the bar. Boro takes the lead against Watford with a hilariously scrappy goal that entailed at least two farcical missed chances in the buildup, Chuba Akpon latching onto his own waywardly sliced effort to head home. Jack Baxter gives Stafford Rangers the lead against Marske United.   Updated at 3.41pm GMT    3.32pm   Goal! Bristol City 2-0 West Brom (Scott 28)  West Brom in trouble here as the midfielder arrives with perfect timing to turn home a cross from the right. In the Championship, Watford miss a glorious chance to go ahead against the run of play at Middlesbrough, Matheus Martins striding through confidently before shinning his shot wildly over the bar.   Updated at 3.42pm GMT    3.27pm   Goal! Southampton 1-0 Blackpool  Romain Perraud rewards the handful of Saints fans at St Mary\u2019s this afternoon by rifling a free-kick through the wall. Further down the pyramid, Jordan Garrick cuts in from the left and belts in a sublime goal to to mark the start of Forest Green\u2019s Big Dunc era and Duncan Culley doubles up to make it Walthamstow 2-0 FC Romania.   Updated at 3.29pm GMT    3.21pm    James Tavernier fires home from the spot to give Rangers the lead against St Johnstone and, for now at least, reduce the gap at the top to six points. Aberdeen are in big trouble, 2-0 down at Hibs within 10 minutes thanks to a Josh Campbell brace. Aberdeen lost to sixth-tier Darvel last week, after which the chairman released a statement saying the result \u201cadded insult to injury\u201d and that manager Jim Goodwin \u201chas been left in no doubt that the Board and the fans are seeking an immediate response from him and the players\u201d. Eeek.     3.16pm   Goal! Bristol City 1-0 West Brom  Sam Bell returns a half-hearted clearance with interest, bending in a great strike to put the hosts ahead. Elsewhere, former bright young thing Aaron Connolly rattles home from just inside the box to put Hull ahead against QPR in the Championship. And Gillingham go 3-1 up \u2013 four goals in the first 13 minutes \u2013 with a glancing header from Tom Nicholls.   Updated at 3.19pm GMT    3.11pm   Goal! Fulham 0-1 Sunderland (Clarke 6)  Sunderland go ahead at Craven Cottage after Jack Clarke pickpockets Kenny Tete and shapes a lovely strike into the far corner. The fun continues at Swindon, where Gillingham are 2-1 after getting a penalty for blasting the ball into a defender\u2019s face.   Updated at 3.18pm GMT    3.07pm   Goal! Blackburn 0-1 Birmingham (Khadra 6)  Birmingham open the scoring at Ewood Park, Reda Khadra sneaking home an effort thanks to some suspect goalkeeping. Swindon and Gillingham have exchanged a pair of early goals within the first three minutes. And Walthamstow have taken an early lead against FC Romania, Duncan Culley converting coolly from the spot.   Updated at 3.27pm GMT    3.01pm    Our reports are in from Leicester\u2019s narrow win at Walsall (the Poundland Bescot Stadium)\u2026  \u2026 and Leeds\u2019 defeat of Accrington (at the Wham Stadium):       2.59pm    Here\u2019s Richard Woods: \u201cMorning Alex. I\u2019m settling down in front of i-follow at 7am in Vancouver to watch Morecambe vs the Mighty Gas, while sighing at what might have been, as I always do when FA Cup round four comes around. Any news on Stafford Rangers? I used to watch them when I was at university.\u201d  I can tell you they host relegation-threatened Marske United (managed by former Sheffield United and Birmingham midfielder Curtis Woodhouse) in the bewilderingly named Northern Premier League Premier Division. All the news as I get it.     2.51pm    And Simon McMahon gives us the run-down north of the border: \u201cAfternoon Alex. As well as St Johnstone v Rangers, there will be a few eyes on Easter Road this afternoon where Hibs \u2018entertain\u2019 Aberdeen. Both managers are under severe pressure due to indifferent league form and high profile Scottish Cup exits last week, Hibs to city rivals Hearts, and Aberdeen to sixth-tier Darvel in one of the great cupsets. What price the draw, a result that might keep both in a job, at least temporarily. Ross County host Kilmarnock in a match with big implications for the teams at the bottom, including Dundee United, who play Celtic at Tannadice tomorrow. In the Scottish Championship leaders Queens Park face third placed Dundee at Dens.\u201d     2.50pm    A lovely little history lesson from Richard Hirst: \u201cCan I crave indulgence for the old and grey and nominate Fulham v Sunderland as the Vic Halom Derby? Then I can wax nostalgic about the halcyon days of 4-2-4 (look it up kids) and the Fulham forward line of Conway, Halom, Earle and Barrett which terrorised Division 3 (more looking up) defences in 1969/70 and 1970/71 \u2013 culminating in promotion in 70/71, but not as champions thanks to losing a last match of the season shoot out with Preston for top spot, due in large part to a glaring miss by \u2026 Vic Halom.\u201d     2.49pm    Also in that division, Duncan Ferguson\u2019s Forest Green side go to Shrewsbury in the Scot\u2019s first game ever as a full-time manager \u2013 his appointment at the New Lawn Stadium making him football\u2019s most terrifying eco-warrior. And with Forest Green rooted to the bottom of the table, it\u2019s an unenviable job. Can the man who once knocked out a burglar smuggle his new side to safety?     2.41pm    And in League One, Bolton go home from Charlton with a 2-1 win, Dion Charles punished some sohddy defending to tap in the winner after a wondergoal apiece by Aaron Morley and Albie Morgan.     2.38pm    In today\u2019s early cup games, Leicester have crept past Walsall thanks to a jammy deflected goal from Kelechi Iheanacho and Leeds have put Accrington to the sword 3-1, Jack Harrison opening the scoring in tasty style:      2.30pm   Preamble  January is always thick-and-fast season, but this may be the thickest, fastest January of them all. With a World Cup\u2019s worth of missed fixtures to play, today\u2019s cramming session takes in the FA Cup fourth round \u2013 including Blackpool\u2019s trip to Southampton and Fulham against Sunderland (AKA the Steed Malbranque Derby) \u2013 as well as full-ish schedules in Leagues One and Two and another four in the Championship, including a face-off between two promotion hopefuls in Middlesbrough and Watford.  More exotically, Rangers host St Johnstone in the Scottish Premiership, Barcelona head to Girona in La Liga, and in Germany high-flying Union Berlin head across town to Hertha. And in the Southern League Division 1 Central, Walthamstow FC host FC Romania \u2013 which should be a simple three points but as we all know, there\u2019s no easy games at that level. Needless to say, you\u2019ll be kept up to date with it all here. Get the kettle on.  "

                    "body": "For Eddie Jones, the metaphors often change but the message largely stays the same. Previously it has been how hand grenades go off when the pressure cranks up, more recently an elaborate comparison with the mission to kill Osama bin Laden, and on Friday it was the uncertainty around mortgage rates in an ailing economy. Each time the point is whether Jones\u2019s players can react to events in real time and adapt on the hoof. The message rarely changes because the problem perennially raises its head. Moreover, Jones sees the current international landscape as more volatile than ever. The risk of yellow and red cards and the potential to lose players to injuries has never been as great. With World Rugby also making it harder for coaches to get messages on to the pitch, on-field leadership and adaptability have become two of the most important qualities for anyone with designs on winning next year\u2019s World Cup.  \u201c[In 2019] we didn\u2019t have the number of red and yellow cards we do now. If you look at how the game is going, that is only going to increase,\u201d said Jones. \u201cAnd the care for the players in terms of head injuries is only going to increase. We don\u2019t know where it is going to end. Whereas the game up to 2019 was much more settled. The world was more settled. You look at BBC News, mortgage rates are going up, unemployment is going to double, TMOs are going to become more powerful \u2026 it is all on the BBC, you just have to watch it every day!\u201d Which brings us to Jones\u2019s decision to reinstate Owen Farrell as England\u2019s captain for Sunday\u2019s Test against Argentina, quite possibly the rest of the autumn and maybe even through to France 2023. Indeed, when Jones talks of this campaign as a dress rehearsal for the World Cup, by the same token it seems an audition for Farrell as leading man. On one hand it was a straightforward decision. Courtney Lawes may still be Jones\u2019s preferred option for the World Cup if he is fit but here is the head coach giving a player he insists does not get the credit he deserves his robust backing. On the other, it is a calculated risk. That the competitive streak in Farrell which Jones so cherishes does not increase the likelihood of those grenades going off again \u2013 particularly when the head coach sees the ability to calmly communicate with referees as of increasing importance.  For Farrell, the most obvious example is the 2021 Six Nations defeat in Cardiff when he evidently lost his head with Pascal Ga\u00fcz\u00e8re when he awarded Wales two controversial tries. There have been others, the capitulation in the 2019 draw with Scotland springs to mind, but to pin the problem squarely on Farrell\u2019s shoulders is unfair. It afflicts the whole squad \u2013 Jones has employed multiple psychologists in an effort to bring about improvements \u2013 and this year\u2019s Six Nations defeat by Scotland was on Tom Curry\u2019s watch. England\u2019s abject failure to reverse the tide against 14-man Australia in the opening Test of the summer is another example and Lawes was captain that day. \u201cYour leadership needs to be able to adapt,\u201d added Jones. \u201cNow more than ever, once the whistle goes we [coaches] have very little input because you can\u2019t get messages on the field.\u201d This is what Jones means when he describes the coming autumn campaign as a dress rehearsal for next year\u2019s World Cup. Four years ago he hosted a sushi night at England\u2019s Bagshot base in an effort to show his players what to expect in Japan but the squad are familiar enough with France and more important to Jones is testing how his players deal with the uncontrollables. For gone are the days when in charge of the Brumbies or Japan that Jones would effectively programme his players with instructions for each quarter of the match. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what form the game will take and that\u2019s the opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to be at the forefront of that. Our target is to be at our best at the World Cup, how we can develop an adaptable team for the World Cup that can adapt to any situation.\u201d The appointments of Jack Nowell and Ellis Genge as vice-captains are designed to bring balance to Farrell\u2019s intensity and as Jones says, \u201cboth guys are very empathetic. They\u2019re very good at bringing people together.\u201d Nowell does not immediately strike as leadership material in the conventional sense but is a popular figure and someone whose strengths, you suspect, lie in his ability to find the off switch. Genge, according to the forwards coach, Richard Cockerill, is \u201creally socially aware\u201d and another to whom teammates naturally warm. To entirely focus on the leadership group and Farrell the captain is to risk rendering Farrell the player of secondary importance, however. That frustrates Jones and it should be noted that on Sunday he unleashes a midfield combination of Marcus Smith, Farrell and Manu Tuilagi for the first time from the start. It is the combination Jones wants to field at the World Cup and it is one to quicken the pace of supporters en route to Twickenham. Whether the captaincy liberates or burdens Farrell has been open to debate since the first time he assumed the role and his leadership on Sunday will be scrutinised more than ever. A mainstay of Jones\u2019 team though? Put the mortgage on it."

                    "body": "Eddie Jones has risked provoking fury among England supporters by describing tomorrow\u2019s do-or-die second Test with Australia as practice for the World Cup and admitting \u201ceverything is geared\u201d towards next year\u2019s tournament. Jones has handed debuts to Guy Porter and Tommy Freeman, as well as a first start to Jack van Poortvliet, and though the England head coach is under increasing pressure to deliver results he and the captain, Courtney Lawes, have claimed a good performance in Brisbane is more important than gaining victory.  Porter, who was born in England but raised in Australia, comes into the side at outside-centre to add \u201cpunch\u201d, with Joe Marchant dropped, while the 21-year-olds Freeman and Van Poortvliet replace Joe Cokanasiga on the left wing and Danny Care at scrum-half respectively. It means Jones\u2019s backline contains five players with a combined 23 caps for a match in which England are seeking to avoid a series defeat and a fifth straight loss this year, in their seventh Test. Defeat would also mean England matching their dismal run of form in 2018 \u2013 ended by a narrow victory over South Africa having already lost the series \u2013 but Jones said: \u201cEverything is geared towards the World Cup. Always has been and always will be. But that doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t treat this game with the utmost respect. \u201cThis game is the perfect practice for the World Cup and our focus is putting on our best performance. It\u2019s a pressure game, isn\u2019t it? Once you get to the quarter-final of the World Cup, they are all pressure games so it\u2019s great practice for us. We\u2019ve got 12 months to the World Cup so we\u2019re developing a team to win the World Cup. But of course we are preparing for this game and taking this game with the utmost importance.\u201d Jones admitted he was tempted to hand Henry Arundell a full debut after his stunning cameo last week, but, with the 19-year-old having to manage his training load after a calf injury that ruled him out of the pre-tour Barbarians defeat, the head coach has opted for caution. Freeman\u2019s performance at full\u2011back that day was one of few bright spots for England. Porter and Van Poortvliet, meanwhile, flew to Australia buoyant after Leicester\u2019s Premiership title success but, in a demonstration of how Jones is rolling the dice this week, the scrum-half did not even make the Tigers\u2019 match-day squad at Twickenham. \u201cEveryone is entitled to their opinion, there are plenty of opinions out there and there are a lot of people who are smarter than me, so if you want to listen to those people say it\u2019s a gamble, it\u2019s a gamble,\u201d added Jones, who has also made one change to his pack, with Sam Underhill replacing the injured Tom Curry and urged to cause \u201chavoc\u201d. \u201cIf you want to listen to me, you\u2019ll say it\u2019s a judgment call, as selection always is,\u201d Jones added. \u201cIs this the best team for this week? Are the players all ready? These are all questions and judgments we are making.\u201d Australia, who have won their last 10 matches in Brisbane, have made five changes to their XV, with the fearsome tighthead prop Taniela Tupou \u2013 nicknamed the Tongan Thor \u2013 coming into the side. Jordan Petaia is selected at full-back for the injured Tom Banks, Tom Wright and Hunter Paisami on the wing and at centre, respectively, because of injuries to Andrew Kellaway and Len Ikitau, while Matt Philip replaces the suspended Darcy Swain.  The Australia head coach, Dave Rennie, said the Wallabies have addressed the need to ignore any attempts to get under their skin after Swain\u2019s head-butt on Jonny Hill, who had just pulled his hair and had pushed him in the face earlier in the match. \u201cI\u2019ve mentioned that,\u201d said Rennie. \u201cThe officials will be pretty sharp around it. It was surprising that the first offence, the push in the face that was pretty aggressive, wasn\u2019t seen by any of the officials and if it had been I think it would have been dealt with and Darcy wouldn\u2019t have been facing the judiciary. Everyone\u2019s awareness around that is a little sharper now.\u201d"

I remembered it last week, as reports circulated that the streaming platform HBO Max had been removing titles from its catalogue following a merger with Discovery+. Were we in a beautifully suggestive allegory of cultural authoritarianism, the anguished howls that have greeted the disappearance of shows such as Vinyl, An American Pickle and The Witches would have themselves been silenced; as it is, this is just business and some of them are even now popping up elsewhere. No such luck for the stars of Batgirl, including Leslie Grace, Michael Keaton and Brendan Fraser, whose endeavours were decisively nixed by Warner Bros, itself merged with Discovery+ in April. The artists v the bean-counters is only ever going to have one winner. By coincidence, I was reading about the Portuguese dictator Ant\u00f3nio Salazar, who, before his death in 1970, had been severely incapacitated by illness for two years. Rather than tell him he was no longer in charge, his inner circle maintained the fiction that his rule maintained. Would it have killed Warner Bros to do the same? Feline oppressed  I didn\u2019t have a cat until I was over 50 and had gone to live in the countryside and even then it was by accident. A letter left by our house\u2019s previous owner told us a gingery-brown cat called Hector occasionally stopped by and liked a dish left down. Long story short, Hector, a female Norwegian forest cat, has now been living with us for some years. Not long before the pandemic hit, she was joined by black-and-white ZsaZsa \u2013 those of a certain age will recognise names from the antique children\u2019s TV programme Hector\u2019s House, in which a dog, a cat and a frog pottered around a garden together. Being French, and inspired by the films of Jacques Tati, it was quite odd; Kiki the frog, for example, is a meteorologist. We\u2019ve recently acquired our own Kiki, a tabby kitten, currently thought to be male. Hector, now entirely blind, is unbothered; ZsaZsa, never the most clubbable and currently made more irascible by a torn cruciate ligament, is in a state somewhere between outraged betrayal and unfettered aggression. Each morning I must wrap blood pressure pills in ham for Hector, persuade ZsaZsa to drink a foul-tasting concoction to ease her juvenile arthritis and prevent the entirely healthy kitten from partaking of either. \u201cI am not a cat person,\u201d I mutter. Fiddling with my dahlias one afternoon, I looked up to see Kiki balancing precariously on a narrow, first-floor window ledge, having escaped to the forbidden upstairs where he found an open window. \u201cMuch more of this and I\u2019ll be joining you,\u201d I said to him as I went to fetch the stepladder.

Because of the Qatar World Cup being injected into the middle of the European season, their schedule starts earlier, with the Champions League hauled into the autumn and new rules for substitutes meaning that more men will get on to the pitch.

                    "body": "The Prince of Wales accepted bags containing millions of euros in cash during meetings with a senior Qatari politician, according to a report. Prince Charles was said to have been given a total of \u20ac3m (\u00a32.6m) during meetings with Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber al-Thani, the former prime minister of Qatar. The cash was handed to the heir to the British throne in a suitcase on one occasion, a holdall on another, as well as in Fortnum &amp; Mason carrier bags, the up-market department store which holds a royal warrant to supply the prince\u2019s household with groceries. The handovers are alleged to have occurred during meetings between the two men, including a private one-to-one meeting at Clarence House in 2015, it was claimed. In a statement, a Clarence House spokesperson said the money given during the 2015 meeting was \u201cpassed immediately to one of the prince\u2019s charities who carried out the appropriate covenants and assured us that all the correct processes were followed\u201d. The suitcase containing the cash was given to two of Charles\u2019 advisers who are said to have hand-counted the money. Palace aides are said to have asked Coutts, the private bank which acts for the royal family, to collect the cash. Each payment was deposited into the accounts of the Prince of Wales\u2019s Charitable Fund (PWCF). There is no suggestion the payments were illegal, the Sunday Times reported today. The sheikh, one of the richest people in the world, was dubbed the \u201cman who bought London\u201d after he used his wealth, as well as his influence on the Qatari Wealth fund, to make huge investments in London including the Shard, Harrods and the InterContinental London Park Lane. He is the owner of one of the world\u2019s richest football clubs, Paris Saint-Germain. There is no evidence the sheikh did not intend the monies to go to the charity and Hamad was unavailable for comment, it was reported. The chair of the trustees to the charity confirmed to the newspaper that the 2015 donation was made and then the trustees, who have a legal duty to protect the charity\u2019s reputation, \u201cdiscussed the governance and donor relationship, (confirming that the donor was a legitimate and verified counterparty) and our auditors signed off on the donation after a specific enquiry during the audit. There was no failure of governance\u201d. The charity is said to have confirmed the 2015 donation was made in cash at the \u201cdonor\u2019s choice\u201d. Charles and Hamad are said to have a relationship going back several decades. In 2010, Charles was said to have lobbied Hamad to shelve the \u00a33bn redevelopment of London\u2019s Chelsea Barracks \u2013 writing a letter in which he told the country\u2019s then prime minister that the state-backed Qatari Diar\u2019s proposed steel-and-glass design \u201cmade my heart sink\u201d. Charles later met the emir of Qatar for tea at Clarence House where the topic was raised once again. Qatar subsequently pulled the plans, prompting the Candy brothers, who were overseeing the development, to launch a \u00a381m lawsuit. In it, they accused Qatar of caving in to the prince\u2019s demands. The latest claims come at an embarrassing time for the prince. Clarence House has rebutted claims of a \u201ccash-for-access\u201d culture in his organisation, with the Metropolitan police and the Charity Commission investigating fundraising practices, including the sale of honours. It has been alleged that Charles\u2019s closest confidant, Michael Fawcett, secured an honour for a Saudi billionaire. Fawcett resigned from his position in Charles\u2019s inner circle in March 2003, after a report by Sir Michael Peat identified mismanagement at Clarence House. The Peat inquiry found that Fawcett had accepted \u201cnumerous gifts in the course of his royal service\u201d, but cleared him of any financial impropriety. Fawcett continued to work for Charles on a freelance basis as a fixer and party planner."

Wood is a member of the squad due to arrive in Pakistan later this month and was also in the white-ball squad that travelled to play seven Twenty20 internationals in October, their first games in the country for 17 years. On that occasion the players were surrounded throughout by military protection, but the tour proceeded without incident and was considered a great success.  \u201cFrom the security we had then I can only mention what we came across, and it was fantastic,\u201d Wood said. \u201cWe were looked after really well, but I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t worried because you\u2019re going back there when there\u2019s been trouble. If you break it down and think what it was like when we were there it was pretty good for us, we were looked after really well. \u201cSo it\u2019ll be for people above me to decide whatever happens. But obviously it\u2019s worrying when you\u2019re going back there as a cricketer and there\u2019s unrest in the country, but that\u2019s for their country to deal with. We trust our security guys so if they say it\u2019s all fine then we go, but I don\u2019t know if this changes it.\u201d Pakistan did not host a Test match for a decade after the terrorist attack on Sri Lanka\u2019s team bus in 2009 in which eight people were killed and many injured, including several Sri Lanka players and match officials, but teams have gradually started to return. Australia played three Tests, three ODIs and a T20 there this year, their first visit since 1998. England are scheduled to play three Tests between 1-21 December, in Rawalpindi \u2013 which is about 100 miles away from Wazirabad, the scene of Thursday\u2019s attack \u2013 Multan and Karachi."

                    "body": "Rodrygo played probably the game of his life when Real Madrid eliminated Manchester City in their Champions League semi-final. His two dramatic late goals forced extra time at the Bernab\u00e9u when all hope appeared lost, but the Brazilian still ended the night a loser as well as a winner. Rodrygo had made a bet with his father, the former footballer Eric Goes, that he would score a hat-trick. When Madrid won the penalty that sealed a 3-1 victory on the night and a place in Saturday\u2019s final against Liverpool, surely he was tempted to ask Karim Benzema to stand aside? \u201cThere wasn\u2019t even a conversation on who should take the penalty,\u201d Rodrygo says with a laugh. \u201cHe is the club\u2019s penalty taker, one of the most experienced players we have. He knew what to do, went there and gave us the spot in the final.\u201d In any case the gamble with his dad was nothing out of the ordinary. \u201cThese bets are a regular thing between me and my father,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s one of our inside jokes since I was little. It motivates me.\u201d  When Rodrygo came on against City in the 68th minute, replacing Toni Kroos, his chances of scoring two goals, never mind three, appeared slim. Five minutes later Riyad Mahrez\u2019s strike seemed to have put the game beyond Madrid but the fightback extended their run of epic Champions League recoveries. First had come Paris Saint-Germain, then the quarter-final against Chelsea, when Rodrygo was brought on in the 78th minute and scored the 80th-minute goal that forced extra time. \u201cWe are organised, we train well and we fight to win every time,\u201d Rodrygo says. \u201cWe were thinking that we had a shot of going to the final until the last minute and it paid off. It was hard, complicated, but we had time and the conditions to change the situation. That was my focus. I was 100% sure that we\u2019d be in the final and it all worked out. It was a magical moment. We celebrated a lot.\u201d  The 21-year-old has enjoyed a strong end to the season, scoring seven times in his past 10 games to help Madrid to another La Liga title and the final in Paris. He is making a powerful case for inclusion in Tite\u2019s Brazil squad for the World Cup in Qatar. Rodrygo was 17 months old when Brazil won their last World Cup, in 2002. \u201cWe are having a great season and that makes every player look good,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen a young player gets to a club such as Real Madrid, it takes time to adapt. I have matured and evolved within the club mentally, technically and physically. We have the companionship of players who have won everything and they all want more, so we want more too. I\u2019ve always looked to win titles such as the national league or Champions League, and I\u2019ve always dreamt of playing for Brazil. What I do at Real Madrid is what takes me to a World Cup.\u201d  Rodrygo\u2019s father, a right-back, played for seven years as a professional in Brazil and his son always had a ball for company. Rodrygo made his Santos debut at 16 and a \u20ac45m deal to take him to Madrid was done in June 2018 when he was 17, although he did not join for another 12 months. It took him five months to score his first hat-trick for the club, in the Champions League against Galatasaray. \u201cI always thought about football,\u201d he says. \u201cMy father was a player and I was always with him. I played with my friends, had that dressing-room experience \u2026 Things were beginning to happen for me and people saw that I could be a football player. When we are young, we just want to have fun, but things got serious; there were a lot of tests and then I joined Santos. There was a training routine, a game routine, and the hardest part was to keep enjoying childhood, by playing with my friends, studying and all that. We never know if the dream will come true because a lot of talented players don\u2019t turn into professional players.\u201d Before Rodrygo moved to Madrid he was selected by the Guardian as one of the 60 best young talents in world football. \u201cI try to not get caught up in the pressure of these things,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I leave to the papers or opinion leaders. It motivates me a lot, of course, because I always want to be among the best. It only happens if I work hard every day.\u201d"

                    "body": "Concacaf\u2019s fiercest rivals took center stage in Mexico City on Thursday to launch their final campaign for World Cup qualification. With three matches remaining, tied on points and a pair of nations at their heels, Mexico and the United States played for more than just qualification. For Mexico, they played for redemption of a beleaguered federation beset with controversy, eager for victory against the border rival they\u2019ve lost to three times in a row. The US played in the shadow of failed qualification for the 2018 tournament, determined not to repeat the mistake, confident in the talent they have in their ranks now. Among the biggest questions facing the United States was personnel. The US faces its final World Cup qualifying window missing several key players, including Weston McKennie, Sergino Dest, Brenden Aaronson and Chris Richards. Beyond injuries, there was the question of how to approach the match, balancing it against the importance of the two that lie ahead. Without question the most important match of the window for the US comes on Sunday in Orlando against Panama. US manager Gregg Berhalter told the media he debated with his staff the merits of rotating heavily against Mexico, giving more playing time to depth players and resting the players he will need most against Panama. \u201cWe came up with our decision,\u201d he said on Wednesday. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll see tomorrow.\u201d In the end Berhalter started as close to his best 11 available, including nine of the starters from their November win over Mexico in Cincinnati. It was the lineup of a confident manager leading a confident team, optimistic they would draw or even secure their first ever qualifying win at Estadio Azteca, then still go on to defeat Panama at home. The Americans burst out of the gate with a confidence to match the team sheet. Quick to move the ball up field, Antonee Robinson sent in a beautiful cross inside of the first minute that found Pepi and Weah heavily marked and Memo Ochoa waiting to pick it off. It was a quick transition toward the defensive end from there, in a pattern that would repeat throughout the match. With constant pendulum swings of momentum, neither team dominated possession and both created attacking opportunities in periods of quick transition. The United States did create the best chance of the first half, though, but failed to put it away. Yunus Musah, Timothy Weah and Ricardo Pepi connected well and found Christian Pulisic well-positioned for a tap-in. He missed. Three points for the taking wasted in a single moment. As is typical of matches between Concacaf\u2019s giants, the first half was chippy and high intensity from start to stop. Parallel to Pulisic\u2019s failed finish were the pile of yellow cards accrued, ruling two key players out of the Panama match. Miles Robinson was tagged with the first yellow in the ninth minute on a pointless foul after getting nutmegged. Then right back DeAndre Yedlin \u2013 playing his heart out and covering every corner of the pitch \u2013 rather unsurprisingly acquired one in the 26th. Weah rounded out the half in the 39th minute with one of his own. Weah and Yedlin, already sitting on yellows, are now suspended for Sunday\u2019s critical date with Panama. Berhalter made no changes to start the second-half and the slide from confidence to chaotic energy came fast. The crowd in Mexico City was now filling the famous stadium with reverberating chants of \u201cMe-xi-co!\u201d and \u201cOhhh, Chucky Lozano!\u201d. El Tri appeared to feed off the support. The US manager sent in his first \u201csolutions\u201d in the 60th minute. Giovanni Reyna, injured since the September window, returned in place of Weah. Jordan Pefok came on for Pepi. Ten minutes later, the two would connect for the second biggest chance of the evening: another sitter that would have earned the USA a historic three points. Reyna closed in on Ochoa from the right, then passed to Pefok in front of a wide open net who then, inexplicably, passed it back toward Gio. The only player more aghast at the decision than Reyna seemed to be Pefok himself. The tempo of the match continued as it had since the first whistle but with increasingly tired legs on both teams. There were moments of brilliance, including a beautiful run upfield by Reyna that had Berhalter drawing comparisons to Maradona in the post-match presser. There were also chaotic plays that nearly led to Mexico scoring, salvaged by the effort of a hard working backline and Zack Steffen in net, arguably the best performing US player of the night. Elsewhere, Canada missed out on a chance to clinch their first World Cup appearance in 36 years with a 1-0 loss at Costa Rica, ending their perfect run through the Concacaf octagonal after 11 matches unbeaten. But needing only a win or a draw on Sunday against Jamaica to get over the line, their participation in Qatar remains all but assured. Below them, the US remain tied with Mexico for points, sitting in second place as they head to Orlando for Sunday\u2019s penultimate qualifier. Despite any frustration at missed opportunity this evening, a point was what they needed and Qatar is now within sight."

                    "body": "Guardian writers\u2019 predicted position 5th (NB: this is not necessarily Nick Ames\u2019s prediction but the average of our writers\u2019 tips)\nLast season\u2019s position 5th\nOdds to win the league (via Oddschecker) 66-1\nProspects\nLast season, Arsenal promised so much before falling away in a manner that stung. Fifth place constituted significant progress but they should have held on to a top-four spot: a lack of depth, and arguably genuine quality, in key positions was an obvious reason and Mikel Arteta has spent his summer attempting to correct it. His efforts have gained rich reward. While it cannot be denied that Gabriel Jesus and Oleksandr Zinchenko were deemed expendable by Manchester City, spending around \u00a375m for a pair of proven winners who are entering their peak years looks exceptional value in the current market. Jesus has been flying in pre-season and should add a directness to the centre-forward position that had long been lacking.\n\nWilliam Saliba\u2019s return from an exceptional loan at Marseille gained fewer headlines but, assuming he sticks around after the transfer deadline, may yet prove crucial given the obvious gap between Ben White, Gabriel Magalh\u00e3es and last season\u2019s alternatives at centre-back. The Portuguese schemer F\u00e1bio Vieira, signed from Porto, is similarly viewed as a longer-term prospect but adds to Arteta\u2019s creative options. There are likely to be more arrivals: if a viable wide alternative to Bukayo Saka can be secured, perhaps in tandem with a move out for Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9, Arsenal will finally look well covered in almost every position.\nThat could be enough to push them over the line, although with Chelsea and Spurs both making their own high-profile additions the competition will be no less intense. The Emirates is often a place of extremes but the optimism looks justifiable this time.\n\nThe manager\nArteta only turned 40 in March but will seem like an old stager by the time this season is out. His two and a half years in charge have, as he has suggested more than once, offered up enough material for a weighty book; much of its contents would resemble a horror story but recent chapters bring hope of a happy resolution. Arsenal began playing as their manager would want last season: a rapid tempo, swift positional interchanges, less predictability in attack. Provided they continue to improve, Arteta\u2019s star will keep rising too. He has always been strongly backed by the club\u2019s hierarchy, even at times when his talents were being heavily questioned externally, but that does not change the fact that a return to the Champions League is expected before long. After last season\u2019s late collapse, it is time to deliver.\n\nTransfer coup\nAlthough Jesus has the potential to transform Arsenal\u2019s attack, Zinchenko looks an outstanding catch at around \u00a330m. The Ukrainian\u2019s versatility is beyond question: more intriguing, though, is what he might be capable of producing with a lengthy run in midfield. He never really received one at Manchester City, but his recent performances in the engine room for his national team have been masterful and it is where he made his name as a youngster. Given his stamina, impeccable technique and ability to function in tight spaces, Arteta might just have found the modern, mobile midfield addition Arsenal required.\nWorld Cup impact\nAt least nine of Arsenal\u2019s first-teamers should be travelling to the winter World Cup as things stand, and that tally could well grow if the likes of Emile Smith Rowe, Vieira and Gabriel begin the season strongly. Arteta may not be thrilled that an always-feisty Boxing Day derby with West Ham will greet his internationals on their return. Out in Qatar, Switzerland\u2019s Granit Xhaka will come up against any number of Arsenal\u2019s Brazilians in the group stage. Kieran Tierney, Martin \u00d8degaard and Zinchenko are among the bigger names guaranteed to be staying at home.\n\nAlternative attractions during World Cup\nThose pining for proximity to the Emirates can always take a stroll around the adjacent Gillespie Park. It is an ingeniously curated sliver of natural beauty that nestles behind Arsenal tube station and stretches alongside the overground line towards the much larger Finsbury Park. There is an ecology centre and some boardwalks, but wellies could be advised in the winter.\nLeading the shirt sales\nJesus\u2019s name is comfortably the must-have accessory on the back of Arsenal\u2019s latest get-up, as might be expected of any flagship summer signing, and already a familiar sight on north London\u2019s streets. But no visitor to the Emirates is ever far from a clutch of Saka and Smith Rowe shirts, while the retained Eddie Nketiah is another homegrown hero whose popularity should be particularly high this season. Anyone bold enough to plump for P\u00e9p\u00e9 or Ainsley Maitland-Niles may find themselves nervously sweating into their new gear as the transfer deadline draws closer.\nSocial climber\nMesut \u00d6zil\u2019s departure last year left a gaping void at the top of Arsenal\u2019s social media league table. Jesus and his 17.8 million Instagram followers go two-thirds of the way towards filling it and a semi-regular stream of updates should keep his fans entertained. To show the gulf his teammates must bridge, Saka is only followed by 2.6 million and Martinelli 1.3 million. If such figures translate into on-pitch success then Mohamed Elneny and his 4.5 million devotees can brace themselves for a decent campaign. Saliba (489,000) must hope his presence in north London breeds a bigger following.\n\nIf Arsenal were a Netflix doc \u2026\nAmazon have already beaten them to it. They chose a relatively placid season by Arsenal\u2019s tumultuous standards although some of the deleted scenes might be worth their weight in gold, especially given the cameras presumably made it to the training ground before Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Arteta, who had not been in favour of the documentary, has since called the experience incredible and described it as \u201creality without any boundaries\u201d."

Tony Cascarino and Alan McLoughlin replaced Niall Quinn and Ronnie Whelan in the second half, bringing that number up to 17.\u201d\n\u201cIreland\u2019s 1-0 win over England at Euro 88 had 16 English-born players in the starting XIs,\u201d notes Darragh Smith. \u201cTen from England (everyone except Barnes) and six from Ireland (Morris, McGrath, Aldridge, McCarthy, Chris Hughton and Tony Galvin).\n\nThings get murkier when you include countries affected by the redrawing of Europe\u2019s borders in the 20th century, mind \u2026\n\u201cBy my calculation 18 of the 25 players who played in the East Germany v West Germany match at the 1974 World Cup were born in Germany before 1949, ie before its formal partition,\u201d mails Jonathan Wray. \u201cThese two nations also played a qualifier for the 1964 Olympic Games when presumably all players would have been born in the pre-1949 Germany. If not, then the qualifier for the 1954 World Cup between Saarland and West Germany must hold the record for the same reason. Incidentally Helmut Sch\u00f6n was the Saarland manager then, proving the adage that if you can\u2019t beat them, join them, which Saarland did in 1957.\u201d\nDarragh Smyth points out that \u201call 22 players that started the 1998 World Cup qualifier between the Czech Republic and Slovakia in Bratislava in 1997 were born in Czechoslovakia. There are presumably more examples from matches between former constituent parts of the USSR or Yugoslavia. The only example I can find of this in a major tournament is the quarter-final between Hungary and Austria in 1934, where all 22 players were born in pre-WWI Austria-Hungary (as conceivably were the 22 players that started the R16 match between Romania and Czechoslovakia at the same tournament).\u201d\nGolden Boot in fewest games\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the fewest games a player has played in a World Cup and been top scorer?\u201d tweets James.\nOleg Salenko is the only man to win (or in this case share) the Golden Boot after his team were knocked out at the group stage. He played three games for Russia at USA 94 and scored six goals \u2013 five of them in the final match, a dead rubber against Cameroon. He shared the prize with Hristo Stoichkov, who took Bulgaria to the semi-finals.\nSalenko will have to share this particular record, too. Hungary\u2019s Florian Albert was one of six players to score four goals at the 1962 World Cup. Unlike all the others, he played only three games. Although Hungary reached the quarter-finals, Albert missed their final group match against Argentina. But if you want a tiebreaker, Salenko wins by virtue of the fact he played fewer minutes. He was a substitute in the first game against Brazil, so was on the field for 201 minutes to Albert\u2019s 270.\nSalenko aside, it was generally easier to win the Golden Boot in fewer matches in the early days, mainly because there were fewer matches. Six players have won it in less than five matches. Salenko is the only one to do so in the last 60 years.\nHere\u2019s the full list of how many matches it took each player to win the Golden Boot:\n\nAnd since you asked, the Golden Ball, for the tournament\u2019s best player, has only ever been given to players who appeared in six or seven games.\nPlayers winning the World Cup before anything else\n\u201cHow many footballers can count the World Cup as their first \u2013 or only \u2013 major trophy?\u201d asks Shamik Das.\nDuring the early days of the tournament, before the concept of \u201celite clubs\u201d had emerged and national leagues had fully crystallised into haves and have-nots, it was relatively common for players to lift the World Cup before any other trophy. When Uruguay triumphed on home soil in 1930, Ernesto Mascheroni, Pablo Dorado and Santos Iriarte were among those who had never previously won major silverware at club level and who had not been included in the gold medal-winning squads at the 1924 or 1928 Olympics, or Uruguay\u2019s South American Championship-winning sides.\nWhen Italy won their second World Cup in 1938, Aldo Olivieri, their goalkeeper, was playing for lowly Lucchese. Though he had won Serie B with the Tuscan club in 1936, he would never win a major trophy at club level or another international tournament. Despite that, his flamboyant style and spectacular saves still ensured his place among the Azzurri\u2019s most iconic goalkeepers and the affectionate nickname \u201cil Gatto Magico\u201d (\u201cthe Magic Cat\u201d). He would go on to win Serie B twice as a manager, but major silverware eluded him even then.\nAs for more recent examples, Christoph Kramer is perhaps the least-heralded member of Germany\u2019s winning 2014 team. The midfielder was concussed after an early clash with Ezequiel Garay in the decider at the Maracan\u00e3 and \u2013 despite having to ask the referee whether he was playing in the final \u2013 belatedly substituted after 32 minutes. Now 31, he has no other major honours to his name. \u201cI can\u2019t really remember much of the game,\u201d he told Die Welt after the match.\nInterestingly, the player who replaced Kramer, Andr\u00e9 Sch\u00fcrrle, also lifted the World Cup before any other major trophy, though he went on to earn a Premier League winner\u2019s medal with Chelsea and win the DFB-Pokal with Wolfsburg and Dortmund. Likewise, neither Benjamin Pavard nor Nabil Fekir had claimed major honours before they won with France in 2018, though the former has since cleaned up with Bayern Munich while the latter won the Copa del Rey with Real Betis last season. That leaves Kramer as the standout answer to the ultimate World Cup pub quiz question. The fact he has little recollection only makes his achievement that much more surreal.\n\nKnowledge archive\n\u201cWhat do footballers get each other at Christmas?\u201d asked Kris K. Surely not that one.\nIn 1998, Newcastle\u2019s players took Christmas as an opportunity to tell the other members of the squad what they really thought of them. The Italian full-back Alessandro Pistone was given a sheep\u2019s heart, as a sign of his perceived lack of commitment. \u201cI\u2019m sure it was a joke,\u201d he told the Sunday Times in 1999. \u201cThe others had some really funny presents too: Temuri Ketsbaia [who is bald] got a hairbrush and Duncan Ferguson a prison shirt [Ferguson had served a three-month jail sentence in 1995 after his headbutt on Raith Rovers\u2019 Jock McStay].\u201d\n\u201cAlessandro took his gift surprisingly well,\u201d said Rob Lee at the time. Quite what Dietmar Hamann made of his present remains unknown. The German \u2013 brace yourselves folks \u2013 unwrapped a copy of Mein Kampf.\n\nCan you help?\n\u201cI recently played my testimonial for my local team before I moved abroad. During the match I had the horrible misfortune of breaking my leg. This got me wondering, has there ever been a case of a professional footballer getting a serious injury during their testimonial?\u201d writes Andrew Wilson.\n\n\u201cManchester City 1-1 Manchester United was just the third draw in 54 WSL games this season,\u201d notes Peter Smyth. \u201cWhich league has had the fewest draws in a completed season?\u201d\n\n\n\nMail us your questions or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU.

                    "body": "A cold night towards the end of 1993. A group of eight men huddled behind a pile of snow at the airport, waiting, anxious. The sprint was only 200 yards. They were professional athletes, physically fit. It should have been easy. On the other side of the airfield, one run through the darkness away, lay freedom and their mission. But they knew they were within range of Serbian snipers. This was Fuad Muzurovic\u2019s grand idea. He was the coach of FK Sarajevo and as the siege of his city dragged on he realised his players had a value beyond taking up arms and fighting on the frontline. He conceived the idea of a world tour, playing friendlies, raising awareness of the plight of civilians and the need for aid. The scheme was approved by the Bosnia government.  \u201cWe trained in the basketball hall,\u201d the defender Mirza Varesanovic said. \u201cEvery day going to and from training we were under fire from snipers and cannons, but our love for the club and for football was bigger than the fear for our lives. This was our way of fighting for Bosnia. We were some kind of Bosnian ambassadors.\u201d The biggest practical issue was escaping Sarajevo. The city had been protectively sealed by the UN, which controlled the airport. The squad was split into four groups of seven and each placed under the command of a member of the Bosnian special forces. They fled over four consecutive nights, agreeing to meet up in the village of Pazaric, 20 miles to the west. Muzurovic\u2019s group got across the centre of the airfield, where they were at the greatest risk from snipers, only to see a UN patrol. \u201cThey had a tank with a spotlight,\u201d he said, \u201cso when we saw the light we just turned around; we made it look like we were running into the city from the free territory. We lay down in the snow, the UN forces put us in a transporter and they took us to the free territory. That was the game you had to play.\u201d They hitched in a refrigerated meat truck to Pazaric, from where the squad travelled to Zagreb. Over the following months they would play 54 matches in 17 countries, meeting world leaders as diverse as the pope and the Iran leader, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who told them: \u201cThis is your way of fighting. This is the best way to present your young state to the world.\u201d  Perhaps it was. It probably does make sense that when you have a gift that can touch people across the globe, inspire sympathy and understanding, offer succour to those back home, that you should use it. There is no sense in talented footballers being shot. But then there is no sense in bus drivers or grocers or postmen being shot either. Many of those players had doubts, wondered whether they were lying to themselves, wondered whether they should have been using their physical resilience to fight more directly. Football has a tendency to inflate its importance, whether that is fans talking of a decade without a trophy as suffering or Fifa\u2019s president, Gianni Infantino, claiming a biennial World Cup could ease the migrant crisis (or journalists thinking anybody cares about the very real struggles of travelling on Avanti trains). That it is inextricably intertwined with geopolitics is undeniable, but there is always an awkwardness when football and war intersect. On the one hand, next week has Ukraine\u2019s attempts to slow the Russian surge in the Donbas region with the big tactical question whether troops in Sieverodonetsk will be encircled; on the other, Ukraine face a World Cup qualifying playoff against Scotland with the big debate about whether Oleksandr Zinchenko should be used as a wing-back or in midfield. One, obviously, is a matter of life and death that could shape the future of Europe; the other is an essentially trivial pastime, one that happens, for a century, to have attracted the attention of the world. It\u2019s that latter fact that makes Wednesday\u2019s playoff significant. The result will not change the world, but that Ukraine can still participate in such events, that it can still attempt to qualify for the World Cup while Russia are banned, does resonate. Just as the 1954 World Cup was an important symbol of (West) Germany\u2019s reintegration into world affairs, so it matters that Ukraine is still part of the world community \u2013 not as much as basements full of corpses in Mariupol matter, clearly, but on some level.  Less significant for Ukraine on Wednesday whether they win is that the game is happening at all. Certainly Scotland\u2019s players should not allow themselves to be inhibited by the situation. Far more important is the reception Ukraine receive. Quantifying how much the world cares is extremely difficult, but a sea of blue and yellow flags at Hampden would be an incontrovertible message and might offer at least some comfort to those struggling on within Ukraine. Ukraine have not played a competitive game since their World Cup qualifying victory away to Bosnia last November. Their preparation has consisted of friendlies against Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, Empoli and Rijeka, while plans for a game against DR Congo in Brussels on Friday had to be shelved after the local mayor was unable to guarantee the requisite police presence. But the difficulties of the buildup are perhaps part of Ukraine\u2019s greatest asset: the sense this is not a normal game. Slaven Bilic has spoken of how for Croatia at Euro 96 there was \u201cextra motivation when you heard the national anthem, and especially when you saw the reaction at home\u201d. That had begun to wane even by the World Cup two years later. Petty grievances fall away before the greater cause. At the Euros last year, the Ukraine shirt controversially featured a map showing Crimea, Donbas and Luhansk as Ukrainian and, although they were allowed to wear the slogan \u201cGlory to Ukraine\u201d, the line \u201cGlory to the heroes\u201d was banned for its historical connotations. Every Ukraine player, though, will know that this is their chance to be heroes now \u2013 and heroes in a far more profound sense than football usually means by the term."

                    "body": "If 2021 was a bit of a nothing year for video games \u2013 the tentative first year of a new console generation, the second year of pandemic disruption, a year of delays and false starts enlivened briefly by the amateur traders giving Wall Street a shoeing via the medium of GameStop \u201cmeme stocks\u201d \u2013 then 2022 has seen the games industry gradually get moving again. Our picks for best games of the year was published this week, and there are some proper greats among them. It\u2019s also been an interesting year for games news. The stories below are my highlights \u2013 the memorable moments from another year on this niche, unpredictable beat. The grand theft of Grand Theft Auto 6  No company is ever pleased when information about an in-progress game gets out ahead of time. When I worked at the games site Kotaku, Ubisoft\u2019s then-annual Assassin\u2019s Creed game leaked pretty much every time, usually via us, and they were never less than apoplectic about it. But this year, Rockstar, one of the most secretive developers, suffered one of the most spectacular leaks in gaming history when almost an hour of footage of GTA 6 was stolen from its internal servers. The response was interesting, from a sympathetic outpouring from other game developers to clueless fans ripping into the way the (unfinished) game looked and played. It was a reminder of just how much work goes into a game on the scale of GTA, and just how close to the finish-line games have to get before they start to look and play like something us players would recognise. The megacorps\u2019 shopping spree There\u2019s been a natural slump in gaming profits in 2022 after two years of pandemic-driven growth. (Turns out, people play a lot of video games when they\u2019re not allowed to go outside.) But big companies have been throwing money around as if there\u2019s no tomorrow. Microsoft started the year off with a jaw-dropping $70bn bid to buy Activision Blizzard, a deal that\u2019s very slowly making its way through many country\u2019s anti-monopoly regulators. Sony bought Destiny makers Bungie for an astonishing $3.7bn while $9.2bn changed hands for Take-Two\u2019s purchase of social game publisher Zynga. The Saudi-funded Embracer Group went on a spending spree, snapping up Tomb Raider, Deus Ex and several other languishing series. Netflix, meanwhile, bought a few game studios of its own, for the hell of it. Chinese giant Tencent has continued to invest in game studios around the world, and is aggressively seeking to fully acquire even more, according to Reuters. And I\u2019d forgotten that Epic bought Bandcamp, too, just because they could. Forspoken\u2019s faux pas In August, Square Enix released a cringeworthy advert for its upcoming action-role-playing game Forspoken. A luckier marketing team might have suffered a few sarcastic Twitter replies before the whole thing went away, but this ad was so spectacularly bad that it spawned a raft of parodies, based on everything from Bloodborne to Undertale. I enjoyed these for days. Battle of the subscription services In news that surprised nobody, except the poor developers who were still working on games for it, Google shut down its streaming service Stadia earlier this year. This marks an end, at least for now, to Google\u2019s aspirations in the gaming subscription space. But other companies are just getting started: Microsoft\u2019s Game Pass continues to gobble up content; Sony revamped its PlayStation Plus subscription to incorporate streaming and a huge catalogue of its older games; and Netflix is getting more bullish about its role in the forthcoming battle for our money in a post-console world. The outcome of this battle, which will unfold over the next few years, is going to have a big impact on how we play games \u2013 and whether we can afford them. Consoles are expensive, but they\u2019re a one-time cost. Shelling out for four subscription services every month is not my idea of positive consumer choice. Fifa and EA\u2019s very public breakup For 30 years, the only certain things in life have been death, taxes, and the annual release of a Fifa-branded video game from EA Sports. But after Fifa asked for a billion dollars from EA to continue the relationship, EA said no thanks. This year\u2019s Fifa game was the last. EA will continue its genre-leading football games under the shouty title EA SPORTS FC. Fifa\u2019s Gianni Infantino, meanwhile, who is famously in touch with reality, declared that \u201cthe only authentic, real game that has the Fifa name will be the best one available for gamers and football fans \u2026 the constant is the Fifa name and it will remain for ever and remain THE BEST.\u201d Fifa then proceeded to shop its trademark around to seemingly whoever would pay for it. The results, so far, have been a frighteningly soulless branded space in Roblox and several \u201cweb3\u201d (read: NFT-driven bullshit) games based around the morally bankrupt Qatar World Cup. So, it\u2019s going about as well as expected. A surprise bestseller The yearly bestsellers chart is always quite depressing. It is shockingly homogenous and sequel-dominated, year on year: Call of Duty, Madden and/or Fifa, probably a Pok\u00e9mon game, whichever Lego game was released. All of those feature in the year\u2019s 10 bestselling games in the US, but look at the top: it\u2019s Elden Ring! My favourite Japanese developer\u2019s sprawling, opaque dark-fantasy game didn\u2019t just make it on to the chart, it topped it. People do buy good things, even if they don\u2019t already know what it is. Viral games brought the joy  Wordle is still my favourite story of 2022. Created as a gift for engineer Josh Wardle\u2019s puzzle-loving partner, it existed quietly for a while before the world cottoned on to it and social media became festooned with little green, yellow and grey squares. Its surge in popularity early this year culminated in a seven-figure acquisition by the New York Times. My favourite thing about Wordle was watching friends and family who would never normally be into games become obsessed with it, getting deep into opening-word strategies and win streaks. Later in the year, the gloriously silly Trombone Champ also became a viral hit, and ended up reviving my long-dormant love of music games. I love these stories because they\u2019re so unpredictable: nobody could have forseen that an online word puzzle and an intentionally terrible instrument simulator would be two of the most memorable games of this year. What to play  What makes an ideal Christmas game? It can be anything absorbing, really, something to soak up the days at the end of the year where nothing much happens, and for me it also helps if it\u2019s wintry. Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla\u2019s world is vast and snow-covered, allowing for lots of nice long walks in the English countryside, interspersed with a spot of light pillaging. And you won\u2019t care that it wastes your time with its endless side-quests and busywork because there\u2019s nothing much else to do. Available on: PC, PlayStation, XboxApproximate playtime: Basically for ever What to read  In the year-in-review spirit, here are my favourite Guardian video game features of 2022. First up: Dominik Diamond\u2019s columns about rediscovering video games as a grumpy 50-something, with the help of his adult kids, have been a laugh-out-loud joy to edit all year. The latest is also exceptionally moving. The story of 40-year-old landmark text adventure The Hobbit (as told by Graeme Mason) gripped me. It\u2019s a tale of imagination and creativity winning out over tight technical constraints. For decades, a group of dedicated Discworld fans have been keeping Terry Pratchett\u2019s fiction alive in a multi-user dungeon, kind of a giant collaborative piece of interactive fanfiction. Rick Lane delved into its history and talked to the people who made and maintain it. Edwin Evans-Thirlwell\u2019s feature about the Ukrainians making games in response to Russia\u2019s invasion is a thoughtful read about responding to adversity through art. A film about a group of players exploring the forbidden reaches of Red Dead Redemption 2 inspired this feature by Lewis Packwood about what lurks at the edges of our virtual worlds, and the ethereal nature of the hacks and glitches that can take us there. And a story of mine, if that\u2019s not too gauche: attending the first ever in-person Gayming awards showed just how far queer representation has come in video games, and what it means to the people who\u2019ve never seen themselves in games before.

                    "body": "Steve Clarke seemed slightly irked at entering Hampden Park\u2019s auditorium to strains of laughter. Scotland\u2019s World Cup push had, after all, just been comprehensively halted by the outstanding players of Ukraine. What had been pointed out among journalists was that the sides must meet again on Nations League business. \u201cI forgot about that,\u201d said one. \u201cThat\u2019s another couple of humpings to look forward to.\u201d Dark humour used to be essential when following Scotland. It is to Clarke\u2019s credit that the mood music has changed so significantly and that the reaction to Scotland\u2019s showing against Ukraine on Wednesday has consequently been so scathing. With higher standards comes higher expectations. There is nothing wrong with that. There is, however, always a danger in Scotland that exaggeration of language \u2013 in positive and negative contexts \u2013 distorts the truth.  Clarke does not subscribe to the theory that Ukraine rode a wave of emotion when winning in Glasgow. Scotland\u2019s manager explained the loss in strictly football terms. He was entitled to; there were fundamental reasons not at all linked to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine why his team failed to shine on their big night. While Ukraine\u2019s players were in a training camp, Grant Hanley was part of a Norwich defence that conceded 84 Premier League goals. Billy Gilmour\u2019s loan spell at the same club was disastrous. Negativity around Manchester United was so unrelenting that Scott McTominay had to be affected. John McGinn\u2019s form at Aston Villa has split opinion. Lyndon Dykes last scored for QPR on 29 January. Scott McKenna was man of the match as Nottingham Forest earned promotion via the playoff final, but his delayed arrival in Scotland on account of those exploits meant the centre-back could not be considered for a start. You needn\u2019t be a puritan to find images of Andy Robertson with beer in hand on an open-top bus, days before arguably his country\u2019s biggest fixture in a generation, to not be a great look. More pertinent, though, is that the fixture marked Robertson\u2019s 120th appearance in two seasons. There must be a physical and psychological toll.  Clarke erred by partnering Dykes with Ch\u00e9 Adams in attack from the outset. There is a reason so few leading international sides play with a front two. Scotland\u2019s defence bypassed Gilmour and Callum McGregor far too often when firing aimless balls at Dykes, which were duly returned with interest. Clarke\u2019s approach was curious given the panache and fluidity with which Denmark were swatted aside at Hampden in November. In that game, Ryan Christie supported Adams. Not only does Christie have craft and guile, he can assist in midfield when Scotland are out of possession. Against Ukraine, Gilmour and McGregor were swamped. The wing-backs, Robertson and Aaron Hickey, had no adequate protection. Hickey became a soft target for criticism when so many more experienced players around him toiled. The absence of Kieran Tierney was hugely significant. He dictates so much of how Scotland play by driving with the ball from central defence. The Arsenal man is a left centre-half who has key involvement in Scottish attacks. Nobody else in the squad can replicate his style. With all of this noted, it is far from a disaster that Scotland were eliminated by a side full of technically and physically impressive footballers. This episode would not feature in a top 100 of clanger moments for those in navy blue.  In 2019, Scotland were being humbled in Kazakhstan. Three years ago this week, a trip to face Peru and Mexico in friendlies involved a cast list resembling international football\u2019s equivalent of the Dog &amp; Duck\u2019s Sunday morning team. At that point, there was a clear disconnect between squad and public.  Clarke has changed that. Only those who have never taken to him would ignore tangible progress when assessing where it all went wrong on Wednesday.  Scotland should be better than receiving pats on the head for competing well but the reality is they were an international irrelevance for years. Now they are not, but the talent available to Clarke is nowhere near as strong as many would insist, especially in areas that can make a fundamental difference. When Craig Gordon, now 39, retires Scotland will find themselves in an almighty goalkeeping pickle. He was one player who could leave the pitch with head held high, though he will be stung by the absence of a World Cup from his CV. Too many others fell short of the level required to impose themselves on Ukraine. That is no laughing matter; nor is it a disgrace."

Of those, Enrique could be the most difficult to land because he intends to lead Spain at the World Cup, which starts in Qatar in November, and United are intent on having a new manager in charge for the start of next season.\n\nChelsea\u2019s predicament has alerted the Old Trafford hierarchy to the potential availability of Tuchel. The future of the Champions League holders is unsure after the government imposed sanctions on their owner, Roman Abramovich. United are aware that Tuchel is contracted until 2024 and has stated he will remain at Chelsea until the end of season. The London club have been granted a special licence to operate until 31 May but if they are not sold by then it is unclear what the consequences will be. Tuchel has impressed United with a CV that includes winning last season\u2019s Champions League, after turning Chelsea around having replaced Frank Lampard last January. The 48-year-old also led Chelsea to the FA Cup final before claiming the Uefa Super Cup and the Fifa Club World Cup, and losing this season\u2019s Carabao Cup final.\nPochettino and Ten Hag have seen their teams, like United, go out of the Champions League in the last 16. On Thursday Lopetegui, a former Spain and Real Madrid manager, continues his quest to win a second Europa League with Sevilla, who take a 1-0 first-leg lead to West Ham in their last-16 tie. His team are second in La Liga, 10 points behind Madrid.\nUnited were knocked out of the Champions League by Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, 2-1 on aggregate, at Old Trafford on Tuesday. After the final whistle objects were thrown by some home fans at Diego Simeone as Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s manager ran for the tunnel. It is understood United are reviewing CCTV footage and those found responsible will be banned for three years.\n\nMarcus Rashford was filmed responding to fans when walking to his transport home from the stadium and has issued a statement denying he raised a middle finger to them. \nThe forward, who is out of form and has lost his starting berth, said: \u201cI did not gesture with my middle finger. I am not entitled. This isn\u2019t ego. I\u2019m upset. I\u2019m disappointed. And in that moment it was silly but I was being human.\u201d\nRashford also said: \u201cFor weeks I\u2019ve been heckled, threatened, questioned and last night my emotion got the better of me \u2026 What I actually said to the man throwing abuse at me [was]: \u2018Come over her and say it to my face.\u2019\u201d"

Instead, fans watched at home, as well as from bomb shelters and trenches.\n\nAfter the final whistle Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, sent a message of congratulations to the team. \u201cThere are times when you don\u2019t need a lot of words! Just pride! Just thank you guys! Two hours of happiness to which we are not accustomed.\u201d\nPosting on his official Telegram channel, which has 1.2m followers, Zelenskiy said the victory had brought joy to \u201cour military and to our whole country\u201d. \u201cWe are all fighting, each on his own front for this. We fight, we endure, we win. Because we are Ukrainians!\u201d\nThe mood in Kyiv on Thursday was upbeat, as the city digested the result in the summer sunshine. \u201cWe want to show the world that Ukraine is strong everywhere, including in football,\u201d said Vasily Volodymyrovich, standing guard with a Kalashnikov in the capital. \u201cWe have a very strong collective. And we have a great spirit. It was an impressive group victory.\u201d\nVasily \u2013 a 28-year-old member of Ukraine\u2019s national guard \u2013 said he thought three players were outstanding: Andriy Yarmolenko, who scored the first goal, Oleksandr Zinchenko and Ruslan Malinovskyi. All played for leading European clubs and had huge experience, he said.\n\u201cIt was great entertainment. I always thought Ukraine would win,\u201d said Oksana, a 24-year-old receptionist. She described Artem Dovbyk\u2019s cool stoppage-time finish for Ukraine\u2019s third goal as \u201camazing\u201d, adding: \u201cOf course we will beat Wales.\u201d\nJournalists picked up on the banners shown by the Ukraine fans who went to Glasgow. Many were already living and working abroad. Since Russia\u2019s invasion on 24 February men aged 18-60 have been forbidden from leaving the country, unless for exceptional reasons.\n\nBefore kick-off the crowd chanted the slogan \u201cArmed Forces of Ukraine\u201d. They waved banners saying \u201cKherson is Ukraine\u201d, a reference to the southern region or oblast seized and occupied by Russia, and \u201cGlory to Ukraine\u201d, the official military greeting used by Zelenskiy in his video addresses.\nOlga Tokariuk, a prominent independent journalist, said Ukraine\u2019s \u201cwell-deserved victory means a lot\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a morale boost, it\u2019s a source of joy in dark times,\u201d she tweeted, with video clips of Ukraine\u2019s goals.\n\nShe added: \u201cSolders watched it in the trenches, millions of Ukrainians watched it in the bomb shelters while Russian missiles were striking Lviv.\u201d\nAt least five people were injured in rocket attacks on Wednesday in the Stryi district of the Lviv region. Air-raid sirens could be heard across Kyiv shortly before the players came on to the pitch for an emotional rendition of the Ukraine national anthem."

With the Olympic champions (Canada), the 2019 World Cup runners up (the Netherlands) and the 2011 World Cup winners (Japan) in Pot 2 there was a chance their Pot 1 placement, as a home nation, could mean little. Instead, out came Norway, thumped 8-0 by England in the group stage of the Euros, Switzerland, a team ranked one place ahead of them and debutants the Philippines. Switzerland and Norway will be favourites to progress, but New Zealand have a real chance to move on to the last 16. Group B \u2013 Australia, Republic of Ireland, Nigeria, Canada Canada and the Republic of Ireland have a nasty trek to and from Perth sandwiched between games on the east coast. If New Zealand have been lucky in the draw, co-host Australia have not. The Matildas have struggled of late and Canada could easily beat them to top spot, setting up a tricky tie with the winners of Group D, which will most likely be England. Upsetting an Australia and Canada one-two, whichever way round it might be, will be tough, but Nigeria and Ireland will not be walkovers.  Group C \u2013 Spain, Costa Rica, Zambia, Japan Spain and Japan will be eyeing a very smooth run to the quarter-finals. Spain\u2019s pre-World Cup situation is complicated by the dispute of many of its senior players with the federation and coach, Jorge Vilda, but their understudies showed they can beat the best, with an unlikely victory over the injury-hit USA in a recent friendly. Costa Rica and Zambia, making a second and first appearance respectively, are unlikely to trouble Spain regardless of who is on the pitch, or Japan. With the winner and runners-up of Group A guaranteed to play lower-ranked sides a deep run is a tantalising prospect. Group D \u2013 England, playoff B winner, Denmark, China The draw has been kind to England with Denmark, China and the winner of playoff B (Chile, Senegal or Haiti) all unlikely to troublethem. They have also avoided the dreaded cross-country trip to Perth the other two confirmed sides have to make for their opener. The challenge comes in the last 16 as Australia or Canada potentially lie in wait. The battle for second place is where the juice is, with China, ranked 15th in the world, up against Denmark (18th in the world) and built around Pernille Harder.  Group E \u2013 United States, Vietnam, Netherlands, playoff A winner A rematch of the 2019 final between USA and the Netherlands is a tasty prospect. They will be hoping to top the group to avoid a last-16 tie with likely Group E winners, Sweden, and the Netherlands will be eager to finally get the better of the USA on a big stage. One of Portugal, Cameroon or Thailand will complete the group, and the playoff winner and Vietnam are unlikely to upset the applecart. Group F \u2013 France, Jamaica, Brazil, playoff C winner France could do very well in 2023 if they get their act together. The off-field drama, with manager, Corinne Diacre, falling out with Eug\u00e9nie Le Sommer and Amandine Henry, did surprisingly little to disrupt a strong Euros performance. Instead, it was an injury to Marie-Antoinette Katoto that caused them to stutter. Katoto is in a race against time to come back from her ACL injury for next summer but it is possible. Brazil will compete in the World Cup without influential midfielder Formiga for only the second time in the competition\u2019s history. They have lost three, drawn three and won twice against European opposition this year, including a 2-1 defeat to France. Jamaica make their second appearance and one of Chinese Taipei, Paraguay, Papua New Guinea and Panama complete the group. Group G \u2013 Sweden, South Africa, Italy, Argentina Sweden will be favourites to clinch the group with their pedigree. Italy had a hugely disappointing summer, where they finished bottom of Group D at the Euros behind France, Belgium and Iceland with one point and scoring only twice. Should the Italians finish second then the winner of Group E, likely to be the USA or the Netherlands, awaits. South Africa and Argentina will be targeting improvement on the 2019 edition after the former lost all their games and the latter drew twice and lost once at the group stage. Group H \u2013 Germany, Morocco, Colombia, South Korea Germany are nailed on to top Group H. The Euros runners-up impressed in England and are ranked third in the world behind the USA and Sweden. Secure victory and they play the runner-up of Group F, likely to be France or Brazil, and then a possible Euros final rematch with England is on the cards. Morocco are making their World Cup debut, while Colombia failed to qualify in 2019 having reached the last 16 in 2015. South Korea offer Germany\u2019s biggest challenge, though this is their fourth World Cup and they have qualified from the group stage once, in 2015."

                    "body": "There is a telling moment in Apple TV+\u2019s punchy new documentary, Super League: the War for Football, in which the head of La Liga, Javier Tebas, gives a withering assessment of those who seek to control the modern game. \u201cYou have to keep up the fight,\u201d he growls. \u201cMoney is not everything. Far from it. The rich don\u2019t have the same ethical standards. There\u2019s lots of liars and fakes. Betrayals happen all the time. Loyalty is practically nonexistent. I\u2019ve never trusted anyone.\u201d Tebas has a lawyer\u2019s mind and a pugilist\u2019s love of a ruck. It is a healthy combination, and football is the better for it. Without him, as well as the Uefa president, Aleksander Ceferin, and Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s president, Nasser al-Khelaifi, the European Super League might well have become a reality. Now, however, he has a fresh target in his crosshairs: the Premier League.  On Thursday Tebas warned that the Premier League was not financially sustainable \u2013 before promising to fight the rules that allow English clubs to \u201cdistort\u201d the transfer market by spending huge sums despite making losses. His comments were typically belligerent but they were based on numbers to make the eyes water. Last summer Premier League clubs spent a combined \u00a31.92bn on transfers \u2013 about the same as the other big five European leagues combined. As if to further make Tebas\u2019s point, over the weekend Chelsea signed Shakhtar Donetsk winger Mykhaylo Mudryk for \u00a383m \u2013 having already spent \u00a360m on Beno\u00eet Badiashile, David Fofana and Andrey Santos in the January window and \u00a3278m last summer. Are such figures preposterous? Definitely. Do they make people queasy? Absolutely. But is the Premier League becoming more financially unstable? Well, no. In fact, that\u2019s the intriguing thing here. The bubble doesn\u2019t look about to burst; rather it appears armour-plated.  The bald reality is that the Premier League is able to spend far more because the gap between it and other leagues is growing. Last season it broke the \u00a310bn barrier for broadcast and commercial revenue for the first time, while stadiums operated at 97% capacity. And, notably, while transfer spending was up in the summer, as a percentage of turnover (32%) it was in line with the league\u2019s last commercial cycle in 2019 (30%). Just as important, the Premier League remains football\u2019s equivalent of the Mos Eisley Cantina in Star Wars, with sheikhs, oligarchs, oppressive regimes and hedge fund managers all keen to do business \u2013 however uneasy that makes some fans feel, and whatever the consequences for their clubs. But it\u2019s not just the biggest seven Mos Eisley Cantina English clubs where the money is flowing. Staggeringly, Everton and Wolves now have higher revenues than the seven-time European Cup winners Milan, according to Deloitte\u2019s latest football list, while Southampton earned more money than Napoli, who are galloping away with the Serie A title.  These numbers are discombobulating, for sure. Yet they show just how much of a financial monster the top flight of English football has become. The Premier League insists this hasn\u2019t happened by chance but by design, based on how it distributes its wealth. Last year Manchester City earned \u00a3161.3m in prize money and broadcast revenue, while the worst performing team, Norwich, made \u00a3100.3m. That ratio of 1.6-1 is lower than other leagues in Europe \u2013 and has been for decades \u2013 leading to knock-on effects that benefit the league. Look at this season. Yes, City may have won four of the last five titles, but a fifth is by no means a given. Liverpool and Chelsea are struggling. And, as Fulham, Brighton and Brentford have shown, anything is possible on a given weekend. When compared with the muscular domination of Paris Saint-Germain in Ligue 1 and Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga, English football is more competitively balanced. Of course, those English clubs in the Champions League retain a massive advantage. But at least the financial distribution in the Premier League allows smaller teams to have the funds to sign good enough players to keep matches competitive and fans to dream. That, the league maintains, then leads to greater unpredictability and fan interest across the globe, followed by increased TV and commercial revenue the next time contracts are up. There\u2019s a flipside, of course. England is also where fans\u2019 loyalty is juiced to the pith, where the flimsy owner and director\u2019s test has allowed unsavoury regimes and characters in, and where many in the lower leagues are desperately struggling, especially since Covid struck. There is a reason why so many agree with Tracey Crouch\u2019s fan-led review, which has called for the creation of an independent regulator \u201cto ensure financial sustainability of the professional game\u201d, alongside greater powers for fans and an improved owners\u2019 and directors\u2019 test. And why her call for the Premier League to support wider football to an even greater level is readily backed. But this doesn\u2019t negate the central point. For while Tebas\u2019s heart is in the right place when it comes to football\u2019s finances \u2013 not least because he has to deal with Real Madrid and Barcelona, petulant twins for whom nothing is good enough \u2013 there is little evidence that the Premier League is heading for a fall. It has pushed on through Brexit, the cost of living crisis and the threat of the Super League. And with Qatar recently confirming it wants to invest in a big English club, and Manchester United and Liverpool likely to be sold for billions this spring, the Premier League continues to carry the decadent scent of the Roaring 20s."

                    "body": "Claims by the Sunday Times of alleged cash donations given to the Prince of Wales\u2019s Charitable Fund by a former Qatari prime minister are the latest to throw a spotlight on fundraising for the heir to the throne\u2019s charities. The billionaire Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber al-Thani, who was Qatar\u2019s prime minister and foreign minister between 2007 and 2013, is a contentious figure.  He reportedly built close ties with British royalty, is an occasional visitor to the Castle of Mey, the Scottish former home of the Queen Mother, and once gave Charles a \u00a3147,000 horse named Dark Swan, it has been reported. Last year, another of Charles\u2019s charities, the Prince\u2019s Foundation, hit the headlines after it was revealed by the Mail on Sunday that Charles\u2019s closest confidante, Michael Fawcett, had offered to help a Saudi billionaire obtain a knighthood and UK citizenship in exchange for generous donations. Fawcett dramatically stepped down as chief executive of the foundation after a letter emerged to an aide of Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz, who had donated thousands to the charity, in which he said the charity would be \u201chappy and willing\u201d to use its influence to help Mahfouz. The Metropolitan police announced earlier this year it had launched an investigation into the so-called \u201ccash-for-honours\u201d allegations. Charles was not aware of the offer of help, according to Clarence House, and Mahfouz, who in the end did not receive either knighthood or citizenship, is not accused of any wrongdoing.  The Prince\u2019s Foundation also faced cash-for-access allegations after claims that a society fixer acted as a middleman offering to set up dinners and overnight stays at Dumfries House, the Palladian mansion in Ayrshire Charles saved and renovated. It was reported that a former Russian banker, Dmitry Leus, allegedly donated \u00a3500,000, though the charity only received \u00a3100,000, which in the end was returned to the fixer when it was decided he was not a suitable donor. In the past Clarence House has said that all of the prince\u2019s charities \u201coperate independently of the prince himself in relation to all decisions around fundraising\u201d and that their trustees \u201care responsible for all operational and governance duties\u201d. In 2003, it emerged the wife of the Turkish billionaire, Cem Uzan, was seated next to Charles at one of several dinners the couple enjoyed as guests, having donated \u00a3400,000 to the Prince\u2019s Foundation. A tightening up of vetting procedures for donors was reportedly implemented after it later emerged that Uzan was under investigation for fraud-related offences in the US. \u2022 This article was amended on 27 June 2022. Dumfries House is a Palladian, not \u201cpalladium\u201d, mansion as an earlier version said."

Denmark lead Austria 1-0, Pierre-Emile H\u00f8jbjerg getting the opener in a game that kicked off some 90 minutes late due to a power cut in Vienna. I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s time to wrap up this blog now, but we\u2019ll have a full roundup of tonight\u2019s games online shortly. Thanks for joining me!  Updated at 9.52pm BST    9.40pm   Full-time scores  League A: Austria L-L Denmark, Croatia 1-1 France League B: Iceland 1-1 Albania League C: Belarus 0-0 Azerbaijan; Slovakia 0-1 Kazakhstan League D: Latvia 1-0 Liechtenstein, Andorra 0-0 Moldova     9.39pm   Full time! Croatia 1-1 France  It\u2019s all over, nobody able to get a winner despite a frantic, end-to-end final spell after Kramaric\u2019s leveller.     9.38pm    92 mins: Sucic misses a big chance! Racing onto a through ball ahead of Kimpembe, the teenager can shoot or cross \u2013 but does neither well enough, dragging his effort well wide.     9.36pm    90 mins: Clauss, looking to make amends for conceding that penalty, sees his cut-back towards Rabiot cleared away. Four added minutes.     9.35pm    88 mins: Oof! Croatia almost hand victory to France here. A defensive slip lets Griezmann in one-on-one, and Livakovic is off his line \u2013 but he slices his clearance, and Griezmann briefly has an open goal to aim at. The ball runs just a little wide, though, and with a defender getting back, his effort from distance drifts wide.     9.32pm    86 mins: Croatia\u2019s attacking changes have worked wonders, and they nearly get another here! Orsic charges forward, the French defenders backing off, and fires a low near-post effort that Maignan does very well to parry away ...     9.30pm    It\u2019s goalless between Austria and Denmark in Vienna after 15 minutes. Ah well, at least the lights are on.     9.29pm    84 mins: France led Denmark 1-0 and lost \u2013 could it happen again? Kimpembe betrays some tension, clattering Sucic in midfield and earning a yellow card.     9.27pm   GOAL! Croatia 1-1 France (Kramaric pen 82')  Kramaric takes it, waits for Maignan to move, and rolls the ball into the other corner. A gift from Clauss, and Croatia are level!     9.26pm    Penalty to Croatia! The referee points to the spot after Kramaric\u2019s heels are clipped by Clauss, seconds after the defender came on. But no \u2013 he\u2019s now whistled for an offside in the build up. VAR takes another look \u2013 and the penalty is given!     9.24pm    79 mins: Modric is taken off, replaced by Salzburg\u2019s Luka Sucic. West Ham\u2019s Nikola Vlasic is on too, replacing Kovacic. For France, Jonathan Clauss replaces Diaby.     9.21pm    75 mins: Big chance for France, who spring that wonky Croatian offside trap again. Griezmann is in space to the right of goal, but his shot is beaten away by Livakovic, who then collects his attempted cross towards Nkunku.     9.16pm   Austria v Denmark is on!  The teams have kicked off in Vienna, just the 90 minutes behind schedule.   Updated at 9.20pm BST    9.15pm    70 mins: Modric makes a dazzling cameo, shimmying into space on the edge of the area and curving a shot on goal. Maignan gets across to push it away.     9.14pm    67 mins: Kramaric comes on for Budimir, who missed a decent chance in the first half and has faded since ...     9.14pm    \u201cAustria-Denmark will apparently start at 10.15pm,\u201d says Lars B\u00f8gegaard. So any minute now, then.     9.08pm    Croatia make some changes too, with Mario Pasalic and Mislav Orsic replacing Brekalo and Majer.     9.07pm    60 mins: Changes for France, with new Villa recruit Boubacar Kamara replacing Tchouameni for his international debut. Antoine Griezmann is on for Ben Yedder, who did very little but did set up the goal.     9.04pm    58 mins: Croatia are pushing forward again, but still struggling to find a cutting edge. Budimir tries to get on the end of a cross, but he is marshalled well by Kimpembe.     9.01pm    We are still waiting to see if the game can get under way in Vienna. That\u2019s the news you\u2019re all anxiously waiting for, isn\u2019t it?     8.58pm   GOAL! Croatia 0-1 France (Rabiot 53')  Croatia had started the half on the front foot, but it\u2019s France who take the lead. Adrien Rabiot latches on to Ben Yedder\u2019s through ball down the left, and fires the ball first-time inside the near post!   Updated at 9.19pm BST    8.53pm    GOAL! Iceland 1-1 Albania Jon Dagur Thorsteinsson has levelled things from a corner in League B, Group 2. That group, by the way, is a three-team affair with Russia disqualified. Israel are the other side in the group.     8.51pm    Peep! The second half is under way in Split. No changes for either side, which is something of a surprise.     8.42pm    \u201cWatchable?!\u201d bellows John Ryan. \u201cThere\u2019s been three shots, it\u2019s brutal. Bring on France\u2019s first-choice front three at half time or this shambles will take 90 plus minutes of our life we\u2019ll never get back.\u201d I mean, it\u2019s not unwatchable ...     8.35pm    It\u2019s also half-time in Reykjavik, where Albania lead Iceland 1-0. Elsewhere: Belarus 0-0 Azerbaijan, Slovakia 0-1 Kazakhstan, Andorra 0-0 Moldova.     8.34pm   Half time! Croatia 0-0 France  An enjoyable half of football ends goalless, with Christopher Nkunku seeing an effort disallowed and chances spurned by both teams.     8.31pm    Still not under way in Vienna, where dark has now descended. You wonder if that game will kick off at all, at this stage. Meanwhile in Andorra, Moldova\u2019s Victor Stina has been sent off \u2013 giving the hosts a chance for a famous win.     8.28pm    40 mins: Vida\u2019s slip almost lets Diaby in from Nkunku\u2019s pass, but the winger carries the ball a little too wide and Livakovic saves from an angle. Moments later, Tchouameni strikes from distance and forces the Croatian keeper into another spritely save.     8.24pm    GOAL! Iceland 0-1 Albania Taulant Seferi sweeps the ball home to give Albania the lead in Reykjavik.     8.22pm    NO GOAL! Nkunku thinks he has fired France in front, but after a pitchside VAR check, the referee rules it out for offside!  Updated at 8.25pm BST    8.15pm    We have a goal! Kazakhstan lead Slovakia 1-0 in Trnava. Aslan Darabayev is the man on the scoresheet. Back in Split, Brozovic is penalised for clattering the unfortunate Nkunku.     8.11pm    23 mins: Nkunku is OK to continue \u2013 which will be a relief to his many summer suitors at club level. The free kick is whipped towards another wanted man, Tchouameni, who steers his shot wide at the back post.     8.10pm    20 mins: Vida goes in the book for a heavy challenge on Nkunku, who is still down holding his leg. It was a clumsy hack, but made worse by the pitch, with the French forward\u2019s boots catching in the surface.     8.08pm    Still no kick-off time in Vienna, with the problem apparently extending to a wide area beyond the stadium. It\u2019s goalless in all the games under way; in the early kick-off in League D, Latvia beat Liechtenstein 1-0.   Updated at 8.13pm BST    8.06pm    The French setup looks pretty fluid, with Digne dropping into left-back off the ball. They\u2019re also playing a very high line, and it almost costs them here as a simple through ball puts Budimir in the clear. He tries to draw Maignan out of goal, but the keeper stands firm and blocks his shot.     7.58pm   Austria v Denmark start delayed  One game hasn\u2019t started on time: the match in Vienna has been postponed due to a power outage. No word yet on when, or if, they\u2019ll get under way.     7.58pm    Six minutes gone in Split, where Majer has just dragged a shot wide from Modric\u2019s corner. The other games kicking off at 7.45pm are Iceland v Albania (League B), Belarus v Azerbaijan and Slovakia v Kazakhstan (both League C), &amp; Andorra v Moldova (Group D) ...     7.45pm    Peep! We\u2019re about to get under way in Split, Vienna and beyond.     7.37pm    One fan in Split tonight has sent me this photo. Fans are still queuing to get in outside the ground, with kick-off under 15 minutes away.      7.31pm    Here\u2019s Ben Fisher on Wales\u2019 journey from the wilderness to the World Cup:      7.27pm   Team news: Austria v Denmark  Austria (4-1-4-1): Pentz; Trimmel, Posch, Alaba (c), Friedl; Selwald; Laimer, Schlager, Ljubicic, Baumgartner; Kalajdzic.

Subs: Iversen (GK), Vindahl-Jensen (GK), Delaney, Skov Olsen, Boilesen, Damsgaard, Billing, Stryger, Wass, Skov, Cornelius.     7.22pm    Not entirely sure how Didier Deschamps will set up tonight \u2013 looks like a potential 3-5-2 with Digne and Diaby as wing-backs, but Uefa have it as a more conventional 4-2-3-1, with Rabiot pushing forward. For the hosts, Luka Modric is back in the starting line-up, and wins his 150th cap for his country tonight. Osasuna forward Ante Budimir and Rangers full-back Borna Barisic are also brought into the side by Zlatko Dalic.     7.17pm   Team news: Croatia v France  Croatia (4-3-3): Livakovic; Juranovic, Erlic, Vida, Barisic; Modric, Brozovic, Kovacic; Majer, Budimir, Brekalo.

Updated at 7.18pm BST    6.45pm   Preamble  The third edition of the Nations League is a full-throttle affair \u2013 the final four will be set by September, and four of the six rounds of group games will be played in the current two-week window. There have been some eye-catching results already, leaving big teams a matter of days to turn things around \u2013 and get some kind of momentum going before November\u2019s World Cup in Qatar (yes, it really is happening). France, the Nations League holders, are one such team \u2013 the home defeat to World Cup group-mates Denmark has put them in a tight spot before tonight\u2019s game in Split. The same goes for their hosts, Croatia, who were tonked 3-0 by Ralf Rangnick\u2019s Austria. It will be a long way back for whoever loses this re-run of the last men\u2019s World Cup final in 2018, which honestly feels about 10 years ago, doesn\u2019t it? Meanwhile, Austria and Denmark will meet in Vienna in a battle for control of *checks notes* Group A1. Kasper Hjulmand\u2019s team look poised to replace Croatia as the side each and every pundit picks to \u201cgo on a run\u201d at the World Cup. Austria aren\u2019t going to Qatar, but you might argue that their first result under Rangnick was more impressive than anything he did at Manchester United. But wait \u2013 there\u2019s more! In League B, Iceland host Albania ... OK, there may not be more. Should still be fun though. Kick-off in tonight\u2019s games: 7.45pm (BST).  "

                    "body": "Guardian writers\u2019 predicted position 18th (NB: this is not necessarily Will Unwin\u2019s prediction but the average of our writers\u2019 tips)\nLast season\u2019s position 17th\nOdds to win the league (via Oddschecker): 750-1\nProspects\nThe hope at Elland Road is that the only way is up after scraping survival on the final day of last season. They have lost, arguably, their two best players in Kalvin Phillips and Raphinha but the money has been wisely reinvested in a new-looking squad. Ensuring there is greater depth to a side that struggled to cope with injuries was the focus over the summer because another season of square pegs in round holes when things get tough is unlikely to end well.\nThe teams that have come up look better equipped for the Premier League than those they have replaced, so the club that finished 17th last time need to improve. The notable arrivals come from abroad and could take time to settle in the Premier League. How quickly they adapt to England could determine how the season goes for Leeds. It is a fresh start for the team after a highly pressurised final few months of the campaign took its mental toll.\n\nThe incomings will shape an intense style of high pressing because Jesse Marsch wants to play with the 4-2-2-2 he has developed down the years from his time at Red Bull. There have been glimpses of it in pre-season as the players get accustomed to the level of aggression demanded from their head coach. Improving their home form will be crucial \u2013 they won once in the final nine matches at Elland Road and a repeat performance would make the fans restless.\n\nThe manager\nKeeping Leeds up was an impressive feat considering the paper-thin squad he inherited from Marcelo Bielsa. This summer he is putting his mark on a team that needed a facelift regardless of who is in charge. His predecessor dismissed a number of targets in January, resulting in an injury-ravaged squad squeaking their way to survival. Those who know and have worked with Marsch speak of a highly intelligent man who knows football inside and out. Brenden Aaronson and Tyler Adams are well-known to the manager and jumped at the chance to work with him again, a sign of the loyalty he earns from players. Despite keeping Leeds up, he is yet to find popularity with the fans but a good start to the campaign would see that change quickly. Last season was about survival at all costs, now he can finally implement his blueprint for the long-term.\n\nTransfer coup\nLuis Sinisterra. The estimated \u00a3100m earned by Leeds from the sales of Phillips and Raphinha has been wisely invested in players with potential. At 23 years old the Colombian winger has already shown what he can do in the Eredivisie with Feyenoord. He bounced back from a serious knee injury in 2020 to become an integral part of the side that made it to the Europa Conference League final last season. Full-backs will be fearful of his speed and ability to beat players one-on-one \u2013 it is up to him to show it on a consistent basis.\nWorld Cup impact\nThe Americans Aaronson and Adams will be off to face, among others, England in Qatar. Daniel James will be in the Wales squad and Spain duo Diego Llorente and Rodrigo will be hopeful of call-ups if they start the season well. Apart from that the Thorp Arch car park could be pretty full throughout the month.\n\nAlternative attractions during World Cup\nThe Leeds defenders left in England could try to get some inspiration from the Royal Armouries Museum. Three thousand years of history when it comes to armoury and weaponry are covered by the museum. Liam Cooper could do with a mace.\nLeading the shirt sales\nHome town hero Phillips and the magical Raphinha have departed, meaning a new favourite is required in West Yorkshire. Patrick Bamford is loved by the Elland Road faithful and they will be longing for his return after he missed the majority of last season through injury, a major reason behind their struggle to score goals. To have their No 9 back will be a great boost to the supporters and Marsch because finding someone to score enough goals to keep a team in the Premier League is no mean feat.\nSocial climber\nPR-driven social media accounts are very much the order of the day at Elland Road. Poland international Mateusz Klich stands out somewhat by showing a bit of personality in his output, even producing a mini-documentary about himself among the photos of his holidays, days on the golf course and meals with the family, which is slightly more enjoyable than images of dejected footballers with the tagline \u201cwe go again\u201d. He celebrated New Year 2021 with a bottle of bubbly and a pair of shades and looks mildly intimidating in his pose.\n\nIf Leeds were a Netflix doc \u2026\nI am sure some smart alec will be desperate to do a documentary to see if Jesse Marsch is the real-life Ted Lasso. Many a deleted scene would be needed when the director is abused for contriving ludicrous situations in a desperate attempt to show Americans have little idea about soccer. Oh what larfs could be had."

A string of high-quality catches helped them take control of the game, and for Wood they amounted to a demonstration of teamwork and togetherness. \u201cWe\u2019re hunting as a pack to get the next wicket, you feel you\u2019re together, people are moving well, there\u2019s a bit of a buzz around the field, everyone\u2019s running out of position,\u201d he said. \u201cI think in general you don\u2019t want to get ahead of yourself but we felt ready for this game and now the challenge is, can we back it up?\u201d  England next face two games in three days at the MCG in Melbourne, with Ireland waiting on Wednesday and Australia on Friday. The Irish emphatically lost their first game of the Super 12s against Sri Lanka on Sunday but England are expecting to be fully tested. \u201cThat\u2019ll be a massive game because they\u2019ll be right up for it, and we\u2019re going to have to be just as up for it as them,\u201d said Wood. But it is the following match that stands out, particularly because given the extent of the hosts\u2019 thrashing by New Zealand on Saturday it already looks crucial for their prospects of reaching the semi-finals. Wood described the prospect of knocking Australia out of their own competition as \u201ca big motivation and not a big motivation at the same time.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re one of the strongest teams, if not the strongest, and we\u2019d love to not have to play them later in the tournament if we can get through,\u201d he added. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t think, \u2018I want to knock Australia out.\u2019 We focus on ourselves, but if it was to help us not have to play the best team later on then great.\u201d Wood\u2019s spell at Perth Stadium was the fastest by any bowler in the history of the World Cup, partly because the 32-year-old is not yet confident enough in his slow balls to actually bowl any. \u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019m working on,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not great \u2013 I tried it in the practice game [against Pakistan last week] and it went horrendously \u2013 but if I feel it\u2019s the right thing to do in a game I\u2019ll give it a go and if it doesn\u2019t come off, it doesn\u2019t come off.\u201d Rashid Khan, Afghanistan\u2019s spinner and inspiration, felt the game was part of a process of growth for a young side. \u201cThere was a nervousness in the team, but at the same time excitement,\u201d he said. \u201cLots of players never played in Australia, and playing against a team like England, it\u2019s a great excitement for the guys. We\u2019ll have tough days but at the same time, in the next two or three years we will be one of the teams that is most improved. \u201cMaybe we are struggling a little bit with the batting and we need to improve it, but that comes when you play against the big teams.\u201d"

                    "body": "  3.02pm    Cristian Stellini speaks: \u201cI think we have to compliment Portsmouth because they played a good game and made it a tough game for us,\u201d said Tottenham\u2019s assistant coach to the BBC. \u201cIt was not easy to find a way to score. We had the possession and had the game under control so we are happy. Maybe we could have scored earlier but we couldn\u2019t find a goal. After we scored the game was different and it was much better for us. \u201cWe had to stretch them to find a way to score. We tried to move players, get Oliver Skipp into the box, drop Harry Kane [into space] to find a solution and we found it immediately. We have to take care of him because he\u2019s our best player and he\u2019s the captain of England. We have tough games in front of us and Harry is important for us.\u201d      2.58pm    Simon Bassey speaks: \u201cI\u2019m really pleased with them, we limited a top side and made a world-class player score a world-class goal,\u201d said Portsmouth\u2019s interim manager in an interview with the BBC. \u201cOur shape was good, we had good energy and offered a threat early in the game. We tired, which is understandable, but I\u2019m really pleased with the players. \u201cTottenham took the game away from Palace in 23 minutes the other night, they can do that to you. But our players limited them to very little. When Harry Kane has to pull that out of the bag, it says something. We probably lacked a bit of quality in our final delivery, we nearly got in behind twice, but we were just on the wrong side of those little moments today.\u201d      2.53pm   Match report: Tottenham Hotspur 1-0 Portsmouth  FA Cup: Harry Kane\u2019s second-half winner sent Tottenham into the fourth round and moved the striker to within one goal of Jimmy Greaves\u2019 club record of 266. David Hytner reports from White Hart Lane \u2026       2.38pm    FA Cup: There\u2019s plenty more FA Cup action to get through this afternoon and evening and in the Potential Banana Skin Bureau of Guardian Towers, Sarah Rendall is your guide for the three o\u2019clock kick-offs.       2.34pm         2.28pm    Early FA Cup full-times  Crystal Palace 1-2 Southampton Gillingham 0-1 Leicester City Preston 3-1 Huddersfield Reading 2-0 Watford Tottenham Hotspur 1-0 Portsmouth Forest Green v Birmingham City was postponed due to a waterlogged pitch.    Updated at 2.47pm GMT    2.25pm   Full time: Tottenham Hotspur 1-0 Portsmouth  Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeeeeeep! Spurs advance courtesy of the only goal of the game, an excellent second-half strike from Harry Kane. Tottenham were far from their best today but did just enough against an obdurate Portsmouth side who defended stoutly but were unable to carve out any decent goalscoring opportunities save for one Reeco Hackett-Fairchild strike in the first half. It was a rare start for Tottenham goalkeeper Fraser Forster but that save aside, he was no more than a bystander.   Updated at 2.41pm GMT    2.22pm    90+3 min: Portsmouth keep battling but are unable to get the ball into the Tottenham penalty area. Cue the final whistle \u2013 Tottemnham are through to the fourth round of the FA Cup.      2.21pm    90+2 min: Tottenham substitute: Alfie Devine on for Bryan Gill, who is warmly applauded by the home fans after another good performance. He\u2019s enjoying his run of games in the absence of the injured Dejan Kulusevski.      2.19pm    90 min: Ben Davies is booked for a shove on Josh Koroma and Portsmouth have a free-kick halfway inside the Spurs half. The ball is floated into the Spurs penalty area and cleared.      2.18pm    89 min: Kane passes the ball wide to Royal after good work by Gill. The cross is headed clear by Michael Morrison, one of several rocks in the heart of Portsmouth\u2019s defence.      2.17pm    87 min: Portsmouth substitution: Owen Dale off, Ronan Curtis on.      2.16pm    87 min: Owen Dale appeals for a corner, convinced his effort took a deflection off Japhet Tanganga. I have no idea whether or not it did but referee Thomas Bramall awards Spurs a goal-kick.      2.14pm    85 min: Portsmouth double-substitution: Joe Pigott and Michael Jacobs come on for Colby Bishop and Joe Morrell.      2.13pm    83 min: Portsmouth caretaker boss Simon Bassey orders another couple of substitutes to prepare for the white-hot cauldron of combat as his side continue their search for an equaliser. Whatever the outcome of this match, they\u2019ve played very well today.      2.11pm    80 min: Spence overhits a cross through the Portsmouth penalty area and the ball carries through to Bryan Gill. He puts it out for a corner off Connor Ogilvie. Son\u2019s delivery is decent but Pape Sarr isn\u2019t quite able to get his head to it.      2.08pm    78 min: Tottenham substitution: Ryan Sessegnon makes way for the lesser-spotted Djed Spence, who if memory serves me correctly, catapulted himself into the spotlight with a terrific performance for Nottingham Forest against Arsenal in the FA Cup last season.      2.06pm    77 min: Broken leg or no broken leg, Louis Thompson isn\u2019t slow about getting stuck in. He is booked moments after coming on for a scything challenge on Bryan Gill.      2.05pm    74 min: Portsmouth double-substitution: Josh Koroma and Louis Thompson on for Reeco Hackett-Fairchild and Ryan Tunnicliffe. Thompson makes his first appearance since August, having recovered from a broken leg.      2.02pm    73 min: Bryan Gill advances up the inside right, cuts inside and unleashes a shot which is inadvertently blocked by one of his own teammates.      2.00pm    71 min: Ryan Sessegnon finally gets the better of Zak Swanson, sitting the deefender on his backside with a shimmy and sending a cross into the Portsmouth penalty area. Denver Hume clears the ball upfield.      1.59pm    70 min: An excellent tackle from Reeco Hackett-Fairchild sends Portsmouth off on a counter-attack and Zak Swanson tees up Owen Dale on the edge of the Spurs penalty area. His pile-driver is blocked.      1.57pm    68 min: Oh dear. With the goal at his mercy, Oliver Skipp blasts high over the bar from eight yards out after a Bryan Gill dink had taken a little deflection into his path off Ogilvie. That is a dreadful miss.    Updated at 2.22pm GMT    1.55pm    67 min: Ryan Sessegnon has a shot from distance blocked by Conor Ogilvie after some neat Spurs passing around the edge of the Portsmouth penalty area.      1.54pm    65 min: Swanson slides in to dispossess Sessegnon and send Portsmouth upfield on a rare second half sortie. Their attack comes to nothing.   Updated at 2.03pm GMT    1.52pm    62 min: Tottenham win a free-kick for another infringement, about 30 yards from the Portsmouth goal, a little right of centre. Son stands over the ball while Josh Griffiths spits in his gloves and rubs them together. The saliva is superfluous as Son\u2019s free-kick is terrible and the ball sails high into the stand.      1.50pm    61 min: Denver Hume blatantly shoves Son off the ball as the Tottenham striker ran on to a return pass from Royal in space outside the Portsmouth penalty area. For reasons best known to himself, referee Thomas Bramall doesn\u2019t award Spurs a free-kick.   Updated at 2.08pm GMT    1.48pm    59 min: Pompey centre-back Sean Raggett clears a Harry Kane pull-back into the Portsmouth penalty area after the Spurs captain had run on to a weighted through ball from Emerson Royal.      1.47pm    56 min: More good defending from Zak Swanson, who prevents Son from getting a cross into the Portmouth penalty area down by the corner flag. An Arsenal player (albeit without making a senior appearance) from the age of six until his move to Portsmouth this season, the 22-year-old defender is relishing this game against Spurs.      1.44pm    54 min: Tottenham have visibly grown in confidence on the back of that fine Kane goal and are trying to pile the hurt on their impudent visitors. After their excellent showing in the opening 45 minutes, Portsmouth are struggling to get a foothold in this second half.      1.42pm    53 min: Heung-min Son collects a pass from Harry Kane in a good position but is unable to steer his shot on target under pressure from Joe Morrell.      1.41pm   GOAL! Tottenham Hotspur 1-0 Portsmouth (Kane 51)  He\u2019s one of their own! Harry Kane plays a give and go with \u2013 I think \u2013 Sessegnon on the edge of the Portsmouth penalty area, collects the return pass and fires the ball into the corner. Tottenham are ahead.    Updated at 1.55pm GMT    1.40pm    49 min: Emerson Royal gets on the end of a cross at the far post, heads the ball across the face of goal and watches in disbelief as it hits the upright and bounces into the arms of a greatful Josh Griffiths. How did that stay out?      1.37pm    48 min: Portsmouth striker Colby Bishop is grappled to the ground by Ben Davies, who lands on top of him. Free-kick for Portsmouth, wide on the right. Reeco Hackett-Fairchild whips the ball into the mixer, where Ben Ogilvie heads over under pressure from Davinson Sanchez.      1.36pm    47 min: Ben Davies spots an Oliver Skipp run through the middle and picks out the midfielder with a floated pass from deep. The excellent Zak Swanson clears up at the back for Portsmouth.      1.34pm   Second half: Tottenham Hotspur 0-0 Portsmouth  46 min: Play resumes with no changes in personnel on either side after the break.      1.31pm         1.31pm         1.28pm    An email: \u201cAs a Charlton fan, I\u2019m wondering how we scored three goals at Fratton Park a few days ago,\u201d writes Dean Kinsella. \u201cReally good defending.\u201d  Well, I suppose Charlton have Jesurun Rak-Sakyi and Scott Fraser to rely on for goals, while Tottenham have to make do with the more workmanlike duo of Harry Kane and Heung-min Son.      1.23pm    Early FA Cup half-times  Crystal Palace 1-1 Southampton  Gillingham 0-0 Leicester City  Preston 0-0 Huddersfield  Reading 1-0 Watford  Tottenham Hotspur 0-0 Portsmouth Forest Green v Birmingham City was postponed      1.20pm   Half-time: Tottenham Hotspur 0-0 Portsmouth  Peep! It\u2019s all square at the break after yet another decidedly underwhelming opening 45 minutes from Tottenham. Hats off to Portsmouth, who have been defensively obdurate and arguably had the best chance of the game so far, when Reeco Hackett-Fairchild forced Fraser Forster into a smart save.      1.18pm    44 min: Reduced to taking potshots and slinging crosses into the box because they can\u2019t find any other way through the Portsmouth rearguard, Tottenham continue to nkock on the door. Japhet Tanganga has an effort from distance blocked, then Heung-min Son curls a shot high and wide of the top bin.      1.15pm    43 min: Pape Matar Sarr tries a shot from distance but sends his effort high and wide to whistles of derision from the Portsmouth end.   Updated at 1.35pm GMT    1.14pm    42 min: Emerson Royal has a shot from distance blocked and optimisitically claims a handball. Tottenham work the ball wide, their dominance increasing. Portsmouth stand firm but are being pinned back deep inside their own half.      1.12pm    40 min: Free-kick for Tottenham, a few yards outside the Portsmouth penalty area and a little left of centre. Harry Kane rifles the ball into the defensive wall, collects the rebound and sends a cross towards the far post. Davinson Sanchez is unable to get enough power on his header to trouble Griffiths unduly.   Updated at 1.43pm GMT    1.11pm    39 min: I stand corrected. Replays show Griffith did actually get a fingertip on that cross in a bid to steer it away from any imminent dangers at the far post. Apologies, Josh.      1.09pm    37 min: A Sessegnon cross from the left whistles across the face of the Tottenham goal, with Josh Griffiths stretching to intercept the ball but failing to lay a glove on it. There\u2019s nobody in a white shirt on hand to do any damage.      1.07pm    36 min: Harry Kane tries and fails to pick out Son with a delivery into the Portsmouth penalty area. The visitors clear.      1.07pm    35 min: Ryan Sessegnon has another attempted cross blocked by Zak Swanson, who subsequently shepherds the Tottenham wing-back to the touchline. Great defending from Portsmouth, who look very well organised.      1.05pm    33 min: Owen Dale, who it seems isn\u2019t actually Cup-tied and has been cleared to play by his parent club Blackpool, wins a corner for Portsmouth. Nothing comes of it.      1.04pm    31 min: Tottenham win what seems like their 274th corner of the half. Son sends the ball straight into the gloves of Josh Griffith. I noticed during the World Cup that his corner-taking was conspicuously poor and it doesn\u2019t seem to have improved a great deal since his return from Qatar. While taking them for South Korea, he seemed incapable of clearing the first man on the near post. His deliveries are going dseeper today but only one has been dangerous.      1.01pm    28 min: Oliver Skipp miscontrols the ball, giving it away to Michael Morrison. The late Spurs replacement lunges in with his studs up to try to win it back and catches the Portsmouth defender on his ankle. Skipp is spared a yellow card, which seems a bit of a surprise. Lenient refereeing from Thomas Bramall and his VAR Graham Scott. Skipp could conceivably have seen red there.   Updated at 1.41pm GMT    12.59pm    26 min: Oliver Skipp tries to reun on to a through ball down the left side of the Portsmouth penalty area. Josh Griffiths darts out to smother the ball and prevent Skipp from getting a shot off from a tight angle.   Updated at 1.12pm GMT    12.57pm    24 min: Ryan Sessegnon takes on Zak Swanson down the left flank but is steered towards the byline. His attempted cross is blocked by the defender and the ball ricochets wide off the Spurs left wing-back. Goal kick.      12.55pm    22 min: Another Tottenham corner. Son\u2019s delivery is headed out for another one by Colby Bishop, who complains to the referee that he was being pushed in the back. Son\u2019s next delivery is cleared, but only as far as Oliver Skipp. Tottenham continue to press and probe around the Portsmouth penalty area but Zack Swanson steals the ball from Son with a good, well-timed tackle inside his own penalty area.      12.53pm    19 min: With Portsmouth on the attack halfway inside the Tottenham half, Ryan Tunnicliffe gives the ball away to Son with a misplaced pass but works industriously to win it straight back again. Portsmouth don\u2019t look at all out of their depth here, seem confident in possession and are moving the ball around nicely.      12.49pm    17 min: Pape Matar Sarr and Emerson Royal combine down the right flank for Spurs but the ball runs out of play before the right wing-back can get a cross in.  Updated at 12.50pm GMT    12.47pm    16 min: Bryan Gill whips a cross into the Portsmouth penalty area from the right flank but his delivery is too close to Josh Griffiths, who claims confidently.      12.46pm    14 min: Morrison puts the ball out for another Spurs corner and Son\u2019s inswinger floats menacingly towards the far post. Josh Griffith flaps at the ball first time around but recovers to block a Harry Kane shot from close range that takes a deflection off Denver Hume.      12.45pm    12 min: Fraser Forster is forced into action, diving to his right to save a Reeco Hackett-Fairchild shot on the turn. He claws the ball around his post for a corner. That\u2019s the first chance of note in the game and it\u2019s gone to the League One side.   Updated at 12.56pm GMT    12.43pm    11 min: Portsmouth goalkeeper Josh Griffiths, in on loan from West Brom, rushes to the edge of his penalty area to collect a long ball up the inside right from Japhet Tanganga.      12.41pm    9 min: Spurs corner after Michael Morrison blocks a Ryan Sessegnon cross and puts the ball behind. Nothing comes from the set-piece and Portsmouth break upfield. Fraser Forster clears up at the back for Tottenham.      12.40pm    8 min: Emerson Royal is fouled by Denver Hume out by the right touchline. Free-kick for Spurs, who will send the ball into the Portsmouth box. Son\u2019s delivery isn\u2019t the best and Portsmouth clear comfortably.      12.39pm    6 min: Portsmouth win a free-kick near the centre-circle, lump the ball forward and it\u2019s put out for a Spurs goal-kick. The hosts play it out from the back and set about trying to find an opening.      12.36pm    3 min: Tottenham win their first corner, Royal\u2019s cross going behind off Owen Dale. Still wearing his protective facemask, Son sends the ball into the Portsmouth penalty area. He overhits his delivery and the ball is cleared.      12.34pm    2 min: Portsmouth win a throw-in deep in Tottenham territory and it\u2019s taken long by Connor Ogilvie. Harry Kane puts the ball out for a corner, which Ryan Tunnicliffe sends into the mixer. It\u2019s headed clear.      12.33pm   Tottenham Hotspur v Portsmouth is go  1 min: Portsmouth get the ball rolling, their players wearing blue shirts, white shorts and red socks. The players of Tottenham are in their usual home kit of white shirts, navy shorts and white socks.      12.31pm    A late replacement for Spurs: Just back from injury, Yves Bissouma seems to have done himself a mischief in the warm-up and has been replaced by Oliver Skipp in midfield.      12.29pm    Not long now: Tottenham\u2019s players are kept waiting in the tunnel for several minutes by their visitors, who seem reluctant to leave the kind of well appointed dressing-room they don\u2019t get to change in very often. When they finally deign to join their hosts, the teams are led out by referee Thomas Bramall and his team of match officials.   Updated at 12.42pm GMT    12.26pm    Portsmouth: A huge contingent of almost 9,000 Portsmouth devotees have travelled to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium to cheer on their team, which has been picked by caretaker manager Simon Bassey, who will be in the technical area today. Portsmouth did request additional tickets for their fans but their request was turned down.    Updated at 12.30pm GMT    12.15pm         12.13pm         11.58am   Tottenham Hotspur v Portsmouth line-ups  Tottenham Hotspur: Forster, Royal, Tanganga, Sanchez, Davies, Sessegnon, Bissouma, Sarr, Gil, Son, Kane. Subs: Lloris, Doherty, Spence, Romero, Lenglet, White, Hojbjerg, Skipp, Devine. Portsmouth: Griffiths, Morrison, Raggett, Ogilvie, Swanson, Tunnicliffe, Morrell, Hume, Dale, Bishop, Hackett. Subs: Oluwayemi, Freeman, Dockerill, Thompson, Payce, Curtis, Jacobs, Koroma, Pigott.     11.43am    Team news: Antonio Conte makes eight changes to the side that started against Crystal Palace but the front three of Harry Kane, Heung-min Son and Bryan Gill all keep their places because injuries dictate their manager has few other options to choose from. Portsmouth make four changes to the line-up that lost against Charlton, two of them enforced. Marlon Pack is suspended, while Tottenham loanee Dane Scarlett is ineligible. Striker Joe Pigott and winger Ronan Curtis drop to the bench.  Updated at 12.00pm GMT    11.35am    Today\u2019s match officials Referee: Thomas BramallAssistant referees: Derek Eaton and Steven MeredithFourth official: Carl BoyesonVAR: Graham Scott  Updated at 11.35am GMT    11.31am         11.30am         11.29am    Early team news Richarlison, Rodrgio Bentancur, Lucas Moura and Dejan Kulusevski all remain sidelined with injury, but Yves Bissouma is available for selection after sitting out a ban. FOllowing his excellent midweek performance against Crystal Palace, Bryan Gill is likely to keep his place, while reserve goalkeeper Fraser Forster and fringe players such as Djed Spence, Pape Sarr and Japhet Tanganga could also get a run out. Portsmouth midfielder Marlon Pack is suspended after getting himself sent off against Charlton, while skipper Clark Robertson is suffering from a hip injury and may have to sit this one out. On loan from Spurs, striker Dane Scarlett is ineligible to play against his parent club. Blackpool loanee Owen Dale also misses out as he is cup-tied.      11.29am   FA Cup third round: Tottenham Hotspur v Portsmouth  Without a win in nine League One matches and managerless since the dismissal of Danny Cowley following their New Yerar\u2019s Day defeat at the hands of Charlton Athletic, Portsmouth travel to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium this afternoon in the hope of registering an early giant-killing.  Their hosts are likely to ring the changes but remain light on options up front, a state of affairs that suggests Harry Kane will probably lead the line for Spurs. Antonio Conte absented himself from his media duties yesterday, feeling unable to face the press following the sad passing of his great friend Gianluca Vialli. A universally popular man, our condolences go out to all Vialli\u2019s loved ones. Kick-off at White Hart Lane is at 12.30pm (GMT), but stay tuned in the meantime for team news and build-up.   "

Goodnight!      7.28pm    The win moves Chelsea to eighth, just behind Brighton on goal difference. They\u2019re six points behind fourth-placed Spurs with a game in hand.     7.27pm    Still want more? Yeah you do      7.26pm   Full time: Chelsea 2-0 Bournemouth  Peep peep! Chelsea win a Premier League game for the first time since mid-October. They did the work in the first half, when Kai Havertz and Mason Mount scored fine goals and the right-sided trio of Mount, Reece James and Raheem Sterling caused all kinds of trouble. Bournemouth were better in the second half without ever really threatening to make a game of it. The only downside for Chelsea was another injury to James, who went off early in the second half; we don\u2019t yet know how bad it is.   Updated at 7.33pm GMT    7.25pm    90+5 min: Chance for Bournemouth! Dembele\u2019s superb cross from the right is headed just wide of the far post by Solanke, eight yards out. That was a really good chance for a consolation against his old club.     7.24pm    90+4 min Anthony\u2019s free-kick is straight at Kepa, who punches it over the bar.     7.23pm    90+3 min After a thrilling run, Zemura is fouled just outside the area by Koulibaly. I\u2019m not sure it was a foul \u2013 he seemed to stand on the ball \u2013 but this is a chance for Bournemouth\u2026     7.21pm    90+1 min Five minutes of added time.     7.21pm    90 min We\u2019re having a few technical problems, though the picture has returned in time to see Lewis Cook have a long-range shot blocked.      7.18pm    88 min Another change for Chelsea: Trevoh Chalobah replaces Raheem Sterling, who made the first goal and had one of his better nights as a Chelsea player.      7.17pm    86 min Another corner to Bournemouth, who are really making Chelsea work for their clean sheet. Christie curls it in, Kepa punches clear and the referee gives a foul anyway.     7.16pm    85 min Thiago Silva makes another important interception at the near post after a good ball from Lerma and a low cross from Smith (I think).     7.15pm    85 min: Bournemouth substitution Siriki Dembele replaces Kieffer Moore.     7.14pm    84 min Zemura\u2019s dangerous cross is palmed away by the diving Kepa. Chelsea break and Havertz picks out Gallagher, whose shot from the edge of the area is well blocked by Kelly.     7.12pm    82 min: Double substitution for Chelsea Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Conor Gallagher replace Christian Pulisic and Denis Zakaria.     7.12pm    81 min Anthony\u2019s deep corner is glanced well wide by Kelly. Wasn\u2019t much of a chance.     7.11pm    81 min After a snappy passing move down the left, Zemura\u2019s driven cross is put behind by Thiago Silva.     7.10pm    79 min: Good save from Kepa! That was probably Bournemouth\u2019s best chance of the game. Lerma played a superb angled ball to find Christie on the right side of the area. He pinged a low shot from a tight angle that was well blocked by Kepa.  Updated at 7.10pm GMT    7.08pm    78 min It feels like the match is petering out. Mind you, we said the same at this stage of the World Cup final.     7.07pm    76 min A win is the main thing for Chelsea \u2013 Pulitzer please! \u2013 but they\u2019ll also want a clean sheet, especially after their defensive struggles before the World Cup.      7.04pm    74 min And now Pulisic splashes a half-volley over the bar from the edge of the area.  Updated at 7.05pm GMT    7.04pm    73 min Chelsea work a right-wing corner short to Azpilicueta, whose excellent cross is headed just wide of the far post by Koulibaly. It was a pretty good effort.     7.02pm    72 min Lerma shoots into orbit from 25 yards. Though Bournemouth are playing much better, they still haven\u2019t tested Kepa.  Updated at 7.02pm GMT    7.01pm    71 min Azpilicueta had a bit of a nose bleed, but he\u2019s fine to continue.     7.00pm    70 min Anthony\u2019s corner is headed away by the off balance Azpilicueta, who goes down holding his face. There\u2019s a break in play while he receives treatment.     6.59pm    69 min Lerma wins a corner for Bournemouth, who are having their best spell of sustained pressure\u2026     6.59pm    68 min Chelsea\u2019s next game is away to Nottm Forest on New Year\u2019s Day; then they play Man City twice in the league and FA Cup. Bournemouth are at home to Crystal Palace on New Year\u2019s Eve; then they go to Old Trafford.     6.56pm    66 min: Bournemouth substitution Ryan Christie replaces Philip Billing, a good player who has had a quiet night.     6.55pm    64 min Mount cuts inside from the left, uses the overlapping Havertz by not using him and whistles a low drive from 20 yards that is pushed round the post by the diving Travers. Good save.     6.54pm    64 min It\u2019s been a more even second half, and at times Bournemouth has pressed very effectively. But there\u2019s no real sign of them getting back in the game.     6.53pm    63 min \u201cJesper Blomqvist made his debut against Charlton Athletic,\u201d says Al Travers quite correctly. \u201cThe best fact regarding Jesper must be that he had his own cooking show \u2018Cooking with Jesper\u2019 instead of playing for Manchester United due to injury.\u201d     6.52pm    61 min Marc Cucurella\u2019s boot has been ripped after a late challenge from Cook. Chelsea are down to 10 men while he sorts a replacement; in fact he\u2019s now wearing odd boots.      6.50pm    60 min Kai Havertz 1-1 Jeff Sachs. He has just missed a good chance for his second, shooting wide from 10 yards after an elegant run infield from the right.     6.50pm    59 min Anthony\u2019s deflected long-range shot is saved comfortably by Kepa. Chelsea thought Mount was fouled just beforehand, but it didn\u2019t matter in the end.     6.48pm    57 min \u201cNow I understand why Azpilicueta has such a pained expression on his face,\u201d says Jeff Sachs. \u201cHe rubs Vicks in his nostrils!!! Crazy.\u201d Isn\u2019t that what you\u2019re supposed to do? Next you\u2019ll be telling me you\u2019re not supposed to suck a Berocca tablet.  Updated at 6.48pm GMT    6.45pm    55 min Mount does superbly to tee up Zakaria, whose shot from the edge of the area is deflected over the bar by Zemura.     6.44pm    53 min Havertz guides a lovely ball inside Zemura for Sterling, whose cutback is sliced wide from about 12 yards by Zakaria. I think a Bournemouth defender got a slight touch on the ball just before Zakaria.     6.43pm    52 min: Chelsea substitution James gets too his feet and walks off the field to be replaced by Cesar Azpilicueta. This is really sad \u2013 he\u2019s a quite magnificent footballer, who just can\u2019t catch a break at the moment.  Updated at 6.43pm GMT    6.42pm    51 min Oh dear, Reece James is down. He looks quite distressed, too, as if he knows he\u2019s done something serious. I think he\u2019s in tears, in fact. Poor bloke.  Updated at 6.42pm GMT    6.40pm    50 min Cucurella plays a lovely give-and-go with Pulisic, charges into space and then finds Sterling on the far side. His cross is slightly too deep for Havertz.     6.40pm    49 min Mason Mount has been close to his best today, so inventive and bright in everything he does. I must say, I didn\u2019t expect it as he\u2019s had a relatively poor year. It probably helps that James is back in the team; those two combine so well.     6.36pm    46 min Peep peep! Bournemouth begin the second half, and Lerma flattens Mount within 10 seconds.   Updated at 6.46pm GMT    6.36pm    Bournemouth have made a half-time substitution \u2013 Jaidon Anthony is on for Jack Stacey.     6.35pm    \u201cJust catching up with the MBM; good to see there was a George Cohen tribute, and thanks for the reference to him as great,\u201d says Richard Hirst. \u201cWhen I started watching Fulham he was one of my first heroes at Fulham, and I still have the programme from his testimonial match. As the words on his statue say, a true gentleman.\u201d I didn\u2019t realise until tonight that George Best said he was the best full-back he played against. That\u2019ll do.     6.35pm    \u201cWell Rob, my life\u2019s goal has been achieved,\u201d writes Mary Waltz. \u201cMy actual existence has been questioned. I have become a hyper minor conspiracy figure in the Guardian. It doesn\u2019t reach the level of the Cambridge Spy ring as scandals go but it\u2019s something!!\u201d     6.28pm    Half-time reading      6.26pm    The goals       6.25pm    \u201cMerry Christmas Rob,\u201d says Andrew Hurley. \u201cAre Chelsea where Arsenal were two years ago? A collection of overpaid, not consistently motivated players who will constantly rotate in and out of the team as they don\u2019t fit the structure of what the manager would like? Do they need a big clear out to start again? A big or easy win this evening doesn\u2019t change their predicament.. Sterling, Aubamayeng, Ziyech et al are surely not the way forward...\u201d They\u2019re certainly in transition, and they have a lot of over-30s. But there are also some quality young players they can plan around: James, Chilwell, Fofana, Mount, Havertz, etc. I suppose the key is whether Graham Potter is brave enough to do what he wants rather than what he thinks is expected of a Chelsea manager.  Updated at 6.28pm GMT    6.20pm   Half time: Chelsea 2-0 Bournemouth  It\u2019s been a stroll in the rain for Chelsea. Kai Havertz finished off a good move to give them the lead, then Mason Mount scored a goal of unobtrusive class to make it two. Bournemouth have fought hard, but they\u2019ve been outplayed.     6.18pm    45+2 min That\u2019s an even better save from Travers, who reaches to his left to paw Sterling\u2019s fierce rising drive round the near post.     6.18pm    45+1 min Mount cracks a pass out towards James on the right side of the area. Zemura comes across, but James wins a 45/55 ball and smashes a shot that is blocked at the near post by Travers.     6.17pm    45+1 min Four minutes of added time.     6.16pm    45 min \u201cAs an Arsenal fan I tuned in early from Canada\u2019s west coast this morning looking for a turgid Chelsea to get their hindquarters handed to them in a can once again \u2014 only to find them playing attractive, flowing football and leading deservedly,\u201d weeps Allan Castle. \u201cVery disappointing, although my mood was lifted by that shot of sad Auba on the bench!\u201d Merry Christmas!     6.16pm    44 min It\u2019s all happening here! A dodgy square pass from Thiago leads to a penalty appeal for Bournemouth. Play continues, Chelsea break and Pulisic scores at the other end \u2013 but the goal is disallowed for a softish foul by Havertz on Smith (I think) in the build up.     6.13pm    42 min \u201cIt gets worse Rob!\u201d says Gary Naylor. \u201cIf the ref blows for the foul on Pulisic after he got the shot away (that goes wide), it would be a penalty but maybe not a red card. Why? Pulisic did get a goal scoring opportunity, mitigated, but not denied, by the foul. MOGSO not DOGSO! Where\u2019s William Goldman when you need him?\u201d See, I told you we couldn\u2019t make Naylor up.     6.12pm    41 min Havertz is a bit lucky to avoid a yellow card for a late tackle on Senesi.     6.12pm    40 min Bournemouth are still attacking with purpose and optimism. Lerma robs Zakaria in midfield, which allows Cook to slide a through ball towards Moore. Thiago Silva comes across to make an immaculate interception.     6.10pm    38 min \u201cThe combination of Sterling and James on the Chelsea right wing is too much for Bournemouth to cope with,\u201d says Neil Pinkerton. \u201cIf only James had been available for the World Cup.\u201d He is a fantastic player, but did England really miss him? Kyle Walker couldn\u2019t have played Mbappe much better. James might have carried more of an attacking threat I suppose, particularly in the last 15 minutes. I thought Alexander-Arnold should have come on when they went 2-1 down.     6.08pm    37 min Zemura charges into the area from the left and is well tackled by Zakaria. The resulting corner is headed away at the near post.     6.06pm    36 min \u201cHave you actually slept recently, you are always on duty,\u201d says Jeremy Boyce. \u201cI am surely only the 1057th person to have noted that Mary is leading us a Merry Waltz, and is in fact a creation of the Grauniad\u2019s staff as a coverall for any time there aren\u2019t enough readers writing in, just to get some email action going ? Funnily enough, there she is for the second goal, and here I am writing in... It\u2019s a funny old game football, ain\u2019t it Saint?\u201d People used to say the same about Gary Naylor. Then they met him and realised - and I say this with love - that you couldn\u2019t make Naylor up.     6.04pm    34 min Thiago wafts an absurd long pass over the defence to Havertz, who is fractionally offside.     6.03pm    33 min Chelsea are well on top now, and they look especially dangerous down the right through Sterling, James and Mount.   Updated at 6.10pm GMT    6.02pm    31 min \u201cWhen I\u2019m not following the football, I have started working through the King William\u2019s College Quiz,\u201d says Joe Pearson. \u201cAfter HOURS of research, I\u2019ve only answered about twenty out of the 180 questions. Lots of obscure history and literature references. Where are the footie questions!\u201d Yes, I can see it now.  who failed to survive her 10th confinement? who greeted premiers past and present two days before she died? against which club did Jesper Blomqvist make his Man Utd debut?   Updated at 6.03pm GMT    6.00pm    29 min Cook makes a good challenge on Pulisic, but both men are injured in the process. There\u2019s a break in play while they receive treatment.     5.59pm    27 min Lerma clips a fine pass over Cucurella to find Stacey on the right side of the area. He tries to chest the ball back inside Cucurella, who sticks out a leg and makes a very important interception.     5.57pm    27 min \u201cPulisic was pulled,\u201d says Mary Waltz. \u201cBut I think the officials\u2019 judgment was correct. Which, for me, is another reason to bin VAR. VAR\u2019s whole purpose was to eliminate controversy over officials\u2019 calls, it has generated just as much controversy as it has eliminated. Go back to pre-VAR and accept the fact that mistakes will be made.\u201d     5.57pm    26 min Bournemouth have switched to their usual 4-4-2, with Jack Stacey moving to the right of midfield.     5.56pm    Mount almost put Zakaria through on goal with an imaginative first-time pass. Zakaria was crowded out but Havertz collected the loose ball and played it back to Mount on the edge of the D. He used Lerma as a screen and swept a lovely curling shot into the bottom-right corner. Travers had no chance.  Updated at 5.58pm GMT    5.54pm   GOAL! Chelsea 2-0 Bournemouth (Mount 24)  A touch of class from Mason Mount!    Updated at 6.14pm GMT    5.53pm    23 min \u201cThe point is moot now,\u201d says Andy Flintoff, \u201cbut if Pulisic had not thrown his arms out in appeal after the tug, he\u2019d have been better balanced for the shot and probably would have scored.\u201d At the risk of becoming the Trevor Brooking of the MBM world, I can see both sides!     5.52pm    22 min Zakaria fell into one of the Bournemouth players at a corner, ramming his head into their back I think. He\u2019s on his feet and seems okay.     5.52pm    21 min \u201cYessss,\u201d says Jeff Sachs, \u201cbut Nunez would have missed...\u201d Let\u2019s save it for the next Liverpool MBM, but in short, he\u2019s going to be a star.     5.51pm    20 min Zakaria is down with a head injury, which means a break in play.      5.50pm    18 min \u201cPulisic will dive next time before he gets the shot off - and I certainly won\u2019t blame him,\u201d says Gary Naylor. I thought he dived then, while also hedging his bets and having a shot. It probably was a foul, though the way he went down may have counted against him. There was an interesting penalty at Arsenal last night after a not dissimilar incident., but on that occasion Jarrod Bowen tried to stay on his feet.     5.48pm    That was a good team goal. Mount eased a nice ball down the right to Sterling, who angled a devastating first-time cross towards Havertz at the far post. He slid in to force the ball through Travers from four yards.     5.47pm   GOAL! Chelsea 1-0 Bournemouth (Havertz 16)  Kai Havertz 1-0 Jeff Sachs!   Updated at 5.53pm GMT    5.46pm    15 min I can see why VAR didn\u2019t overturn that decision - there wasn\u2019t that much contact, therefore it wasn\u2019t a clear and obvious error - although I haven\u2019t really got a clue what constitutes a foul any more.     5.44pm    12 min: Chelsea penalty appeal! Pulisic collects a loose ball on the edge of the D and surges into the area. Smith panics and grabs his shirt, and Pulisic accepts the invitation to go down before shooting wide on the stretch. Simon Hooper says no penalty and VAR isn\u2019t interested. Hmm. It wasn\u2019t much of a shirt pull, and Pulisic certainly made the most of it, but it was still a shirt pull. Smith is lucky because, had a penalty been given, he would have been sent off as well.  Updated at 5.45pm GMT    5.42pm    11 min Thiago is still limping, though there\u2019s no sign of him coming off.      5.41pm    10 min \u201cI am the lone person in the office today \u2013 despite not being a holiday here in the good ol\u2019 USA, everyone else is off,\u201d says Rachel Clifton. \u201cSo the MBM is even more of a godsend than usual. And it isn\u2019t Southampton\u2026\u201d I was surprised to see that they\u2019re bottom of the table. Looks like the best way for a south coast team to avoid relegation is to get tonked 9-0 early in the season.     5.40pm    8 min Maybe Jeff Sachs was right: Havertz has just missed a chance, heading over from Cucurella\u2019s deep, floated cross. It wasn\u2019t the easiest opportunity, but he should probably have hit the target.     5.38pm    8 min \u201cNot getting a holiday break?\u201d says Jeff Sachs. \u201cHavertz is as good as Nunez at missing.\u201d Tough crowd!   Updated at 5.48pm GMT    5.38pm    7 min Thiago Silva is limping, which is a problem for Chelsea. They do have Trevoh Chalobah on the bench.     5.37pm    5 min Bournemouth are playing with a back five, as predicted, though Billing is playing alongside Lerma and Cook in midfield rather than in front of them.     5.34pm    3 min Mount\u2019s corner is dummied by Sterling, which allows the ball to run towards Reece James on the edge of the area. He mishits a shot into the crowd and Bournemouth clear.     5.33pm    2 min Chelsea\u2019s shape is a 4-2-3-1, as we expected, but with Sterling on the right and Pulisic on the left.      5.33pm    2 min Billing\u2019s free-kick is saved comfortably by Kepa. Chelsea break and Havertz wins the first corner of the game.     5.32pm    1 min Solanke, once of Chelsea, slaloms past two players before being taken out by Thiago Silva. Free-kick to Bournemouth 30 yards from goal\u2026     5.31pm    1 min Peep peep! Chelsea, kicking from right to left as we watch, get the game under way.     5.30pm    There\u2019s a minute\u2019s applause for the great George Cohen, who died last week aged 83. And now it\u2019s time for the action.     5.27pm    \u201cGreetings and felicitations,\u201d writes Vincent. \u201cTime for the Blues to show us what they\u2019ve got Rob, mid-table is not good enough; greetings from all here.\u201d And from here. Merry Christmas to all!     5.25pm    \u201cHere in the U-S-A! U-S-A!! U-S-A!!!, Snakes and Ladders is marketed as Chutes and Ladders,\u201d writes Peter Oh. \u201cBournemouth forwards take note. If you want to score you\u2019ve got to CHUTE!, er, SHOOT!\u201d     5.23pm    These are exciting times for Bournemouth. Gary O\u2019Neil was appointed as permanent manager during the World Cup, having done an excellent job as caretaker, and the American Bill Foley completed his takeover a couple of weeks ago.      5.20pm    It\u2019s a grim old night in west London, with the rain hooning down. Not quite a wet, windy one in Stoke, but Amazon Prime do have Tony Pulis as one of their pundits.  Updated at 5.28pm GMT    4.54pm     And if he doesn\u2019t change Chelsea\u2019s fortunes, at least he\u2019ll be given a fortune when they pay him up. For all kinds of reasons, I really, really hope he succeeds.  Updated at 4.55pm GMT    4.51pm    The state of play  Chelsea start the game in ninth place. They\u2019re also nine points off a Champions League place, though they have two games in hand on fourth-place Spurs. Bournemouth are 14th, three points above the relegation places in what is an increasingly compelling game of Snakes and Ladders. A win tonight would move them up to 12th.     4.45pm   Team news  The magnificent Reece James returns to the Chelsea team for the first time since mid-October, while Denis Zakaria makes his Premier League debut in midfield. Hakim Ziyech and Mateo Kovacic, who went the distance at the World Cup, are not included in the squad. All told, Chelsea are without eight first-team players. Bournemouth are without the impressive Marcus Tavernier, who is injured, so Jack Stacey comes into the side. That probably means a switch to a back five. Lloyd Kelly also returns in place of Jack Stephens. Chelsea (possible 4-2-3-1) Arrizabalaga; James, Thiago Silva, Koulibaly, Cucurella; Jorginho, Zakaria; Pulisic, Mount, Sterling; Havertz.Substitutes: Bettinelli, Chalobah, Azpilicueta, Humphreys, Gallagher, Hutchinson, Hall, Aubameyang. Bournemouth (possible 5-2-1-2) Travers; Stacey, Smith, Senesi, Kelly, Zemura; Cook, Lerma; Billing; Solanke, Moore.Substitutes: Plain, Stephens, Christie, Marcondes, Rothwell, Pearson, Lowe, Anthony, Dembele. Referee Simon Hooper  Updated at 4.54pm GMT    4.30pm   Preamble  Hello and welcome to live coverage of Chelsea v Bournemouth at Stamford Bridge. The World Cup came at a good moment for Chelsea, who needed a time out after suffering three successive league defeats. Most of their players were either in Qatar or the treatment room, so Graham Potter hasn\u2019t really had time to work his coaching magic, but a reset might be the next best thing. Bournemouth also had a dodgy run before the World Cup, losing four league games on the spin, but they finished part one of the Premier League season on a high when they routed Everton 3-0. They have a fine recent record at Chelsea, with three wins in five Premier League games, so a trip to Stamford Bridge should hold no fears for them. Unlike the rest of Great Britain, Bournemouth will travel with confidence. Kick off 5.30pm.   "

                    "body": "If France need a lesson in how not to deal with a second-round tie against outwardly moderate continental peers, they only need look back 17 months. A Euro 2020 assignment against Switzerland in front of a Covid-reduced crowd in Bucharest did little to raise the pulse on paper and perhaps that was the problem: although they belatedly sprang into life going forward it was a different story at the other end, a late collapse leading proceedings towards a shootout and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 missing the decisive kick.\nThere are parallels with the task they face against Poland on Sunday. Few really expect a thriller, especially those who have watched Czeslaw Michniewicz\u2019s team over the past fortnight, and the risk is that a predicted slog may carry a sting. This time France need to be fully switched on, heeding the lessons rehearsed during last year\u2019s post-tournament inquest.\n\u201cWe talked about that a lot, particularly in the months following the European Championship, and it is a factor that comes into play,\u201d Hugo Lloris, speaking on Saturday, admitted of the Switzerland defeat. \u201cFor such an important match you can\u2019t afford to relax and lose your concentration. Everything has to work.\u201d\n\nThat means slipping back into the well-oiled groove that took them emphatically past Australia and, not without a wobble or two, a Denmark side who have fallen by the wayside. They cannot claim to be leggy: Didier Deschamps was perfectly happy to take the post-match rap on Wednesday when a misshapen and patternless side lost to Tunisia, because all bar two of his preferred starters had been given most of the afternoon off. Mbapp\u00e9, Olivier Giroud, Antoine Griezmann, Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and company are among the most rested stars in a sapping, breakneck tournament and will be expected to make it count.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just wait for your opponent \u2013 you have to be on the front foot,\u201d said Lloris, who will equal Lilian Thuram\u2019s record of 142 caps for Les Bleus when he retakes his place in goal. \u201cWe need to give everything and, when we get a chance, take these opportunities.\u201d\nThey must find enough players in the form to do so against a Poland side Deschamps said \u201clike defending\u201d and will, in particular, hope some weight can be taken off the shoulders of Mbapp\u00e9. Sometimes it feels as if the Paris Saint-Germain forward is content to solve everything alone but that is no path to retaining the trophy.\nPerhaps it is Griezmann\u2019s time to step back up. He has featured in 70 consecutive games for France, a remarkable feat, and international football has sometimes appeared a refuge from patchy club fortunes in the past two years. But he has not scored in his past dozen, even if that feels a harsh conclusion given the bizarre disallowing of a late equaliser after coming on against Tunisia; a repeat of 2018, when three of his four goals came in the knockout stage, would be welcome.\nDeschamps has learned that the secret to cajoling the best from Griezmann is tough love or, at least, tough like. \u201cI\u2019m not going to talk about love but if you don\u2019t like your players it\u2019s going to be very difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I don\u2019t like them I don\u2019t select them for the squad in the first place. For Antoine and some others we know each other and trust each other very well, but that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t be frank with him and give him advice he might not always appreciate.\u201d\n\nThe danger in that search for all-round cutting edge lies in the potential for defensive neglect, as evidenced against Switzerland. That is particularly risky when you face Robert Lewandowski, who is served the thinnest of gruel in this Poland team but leaves no doubt through actions, deeds and words that his second and final World Cup means everything. Lewandowski was visibly emotional upon breaking his duck at this level against Saudi Arabia; the sands of time are running against him and every half-chance will be laden with meaning.\n\u201cYou have to try and restrict his influence in the game,\u201d Deschamps said. \u201cThe less he receives the ball, the less he can do. He\u2019s a very clever player, technically very gifted, and he knows how to use his body. He didn\u2019t get the ball a lot in the group stage but with just one chance he will be very dangerous.\u201d\nPutting aside the need for both teams to spread the burden, Lewandowski\u2019s face-off with Mbapp\u00e9 has the potential to intrigue. \u201cThey are not the same age, or similar in other respects,\u201d Deschamps pointed out, while acknowledging the piquancy of the tussle. He knows that denying Lewandowski oxygen should get half the job done for France; should Poland smother Mbapp\u00e9 then, even considering France\u2019s injury woes, there are further sharp instruments to call upon.\n\nLloris steered conversation away from Mbapp\u00e9 and towards his own counterpart Wojciech Szczesny, who is having an outstanding tournament and contrived Poland\u2019s only highlight against Argentina with an astounding penalty save from Lionel Messi. \u201cHe is playing a magnificent tournament,\u201d Lloris offered, and the thought occurred that if Szczesny is able to cause Messi pain he is able to inflict a repeat of last summer\u2019s misery on Mbapp\u00e9, too.\nIt makes sense, then, that France have been brushing up on their spot-kicks in training. \u201cIf a penalty is well taken a goalkeeper has little chance of stopping it,\u201d Lloris said. \u201cBut there are goalkeepers who are very strong in this situation and sometimes they have little secrets they don\u2019t like to share.\u201d\nFrance, who have England or Senegal in their quarter-final sights, hope the mystery of that shock in the Romanian capital has been comprehensively put behind them by the time the weekend is out."

Evangelos Marinakis spoke of going for trophies after securing promotion but the club will, ultimately, be happy if they finish 17th.\nThey certainly have the players to go a few places higher but it could take a little while for the team to gel into a unit considering the overturn in playing staff. They lost a number of the promotion squad including the popular goalkeeper Brice Samba, who was allowed to leave and replaced by Dean Henderson, while club captain Lewis Grabban decided against signing a new contract.\n\nRecruitment has been precise to give Steve Cooper the resources he demands to make his team competitive in a division that is new to the majority of his players. Jesse Lingard was signed to make a statement and add experience. It is a young side, which should help with fearlessness at the top level but might mean they lack the nous required to get through the tough moments and how will they react if they go on a poor run, not something they experienced under Cooper last season.\nThey will look to be aggressive and press constantly to make sure no one, regardless of stature, takes points off them easily over the course of the campaign. The City Ground has received an upgrade over the summer and the club will be hoping it will be where they pick up the majority of their points on the way to safety.\n\nThe manager\nWhen things were going incredibly wrong at the start of last season under Chris Hughton, chief executive Dane Murphy quickly earmarked Cooper as the man to improve Forest. Few could have anticipated going from one point in seven matches to beating Huddersfield in the playoff final but that was the effect the former Swansea head coach had on the team. Within the club, the main thing Cooper brought to the squad was \u201cbelief\u201d, as Joe Worrall confirmed at Wembley. The team became more aggressive under his stewardship and was finally a cohesive unit. He turned Brennan Johnson from a forward on the periphery of the team to their most-lauded asset in the space of a couple of months. He knows what he is doing with young players thanks to a background working in academies and with England youth teams. He will relish his first season as a Premier League manager.\n\nTransfer coup\nIt has been another smart summer in the transfer market for Forest. The Bundesliga has been a key target for the club where they know they can get value for money. They broke their transfer record to make Taiwo Awoniyi their first arrival of the summer for \u00a317.5m from Union Berlin. The Nigeria international began his career with Liverpool but spent his time there out on loan before moving to Union last summer. He scored 15 goals to help his team to fifth in the table and European football but decided to give it up for a shot at the Premier League. He met Cooper and, despite interest from elsewhere, decided the project at the City Ground was the one for him.\nWorld Cup impact\nIt should be a month off for most of the players. Dean Henderson will be hoping first-team football will get him into the England squad, while Neco Williams and Brennan Johnson are certainties to be part of the Wales setup, barring injuries. The other player likely to be in Qatar is Canada\u2019s Richie Laryea but he is earmarked to spend the season out on loan.\n\nAlternative attractions during World Cup\nThere is no shortage of attractions in Nottingham. There are The Caves, which are, surprisingly, a massive network of caves, a good place to hide from the realities of the world if Forest are in the relegation zone come November.\nLeading the shirt sales\nBrennan Johnson is the local hero. After signing a new contract this summer his popularity has been boosted even further. Everyone likes an academy product doing well and Johnson certainly is that. His father, David, had a decent five-year spell with the club at the turn of the millennium and his legacy lives on 16 years after his departure. He faces a big step up, considering he was playing on loan at Lincoln in League One two years ago, but everything suggests he has the capabilities to be a Premier League player in the long term.\nSocial climber\nLast season Djed Spence and Brice Samba were the main social players. The good news is that they are now in the Premier League when it comes to the TikToks, the Instas and the other things that keep the kids amused, because they have snapped up Jesse Lingard. A top-flight player with the following to match. He has more than a million fans on TikTok alone because he loves to dance.\n\nIf Forest were a Netflix doc \u2026\nNottingham Forest: Back in the big time. What could possibly go wrong at the City Ground? They have worked hard to return to the Premier League, it has only taken almost a quarter of a century and involved three seasons in the third tier. Fans would just be hoping it is not a depiction of someone losing hope over the space of nine months."

Israr, a son of Oaks winner Taghrooda, looks the likeliest candidate to extend the sequence.\nNewmarket 3.00 Joe Fanning could get a soft lead on Wizard D\u2019Amour and that would give him a real chance to reverse recent form with Shine So Bright.\n\nStradivarius sweeps to record win under Dettori\nStradivarius and Frankie Dettori opened a new chapter here on Friday in what was already one of the more remarkable racing stories of recent decades, as the chestnut set off on his seventh \u2013 and surely final \u2013 campaign with a one-length win in the Group Two Yorkshire Cup.\nThe victory, the 20th of Stradivarius\u2019s 33-race career, set a new record for Group-race wins in Europe and took his unbeaten streak on the Knavesmire to six races. Perhaps most importantly, though, given the recent drop in attendances at many high-profile meetings, it also sent the crowd home with an \u201cI was there\u201d moment that will keep them coming back for more.\n\nStradivarius\u2019s 18th Group-race success took him one clear of Cirrus Des Aigles among European-trained Flat horses, and his record is all the more remarkable for having been achieved without a gelding operation at some point to keep his mind on the job at hand.\nHe hit a brief flat spot just over a quarter of a mile out on Friday but once Dettori had persuaded Stradivarius to lengthen, he showed all his old and familiar enthusiasm to sweep into the lead a little more readily, perhaps, than even his rider had expected.\n\u201cJohn and Thady [Gosden, who train Stradivarius] have got to take all the credit really,\u201d Dettori said. \u201cThey\u2019ve changed different things to get him interested, worked him from the front and the back, taken him to different places, just to get him motivated as he\u2019s been going on those gallops for six years.\n\u201cHe looked the same as he usually does, travelled with zest, showed a good turn of foot and then he pulls up in front, but we know he does that.\n\u201cMy mouth is a bit dry and I\u2019m emotional, but what an incredible story. All roads lead to [the] Ascot [Gold Cup] for one more roll of the dice. Let\u2019s hope the ground stays dry.\u201d\nStradivarius was cut to around 3-1 (from 6-1) to win the Ascot Gold Cup for a record-equalling fourth time next month, when he would also be only the third eight-year-old winner in the race\u2019s 215-year history. Yeats, the only horse to date with four Gold Cup wins, was also eight for his final Ascot success in 2009.\n\u201cIf he was an eight-year-old gelding, it would be a different ballgame,\u201d John Gosden said afterwards. \u201cHe\u2019s done well mentally to get himself there, he knows the gallops and he knows everything backwards.\n\u201cI\u2019m quite careful with the way I train him. If you tried to rub his nose in it, he\u2019d tell you what to do with the game.\n\u201cAs long as the ground doesn\u2019t go soft or heavy, then we hope to go on to Ascot. I think if he had this ground, he\u2019d take a lot of beating.\u201d"

                    "body": "Good morning. It\u2019s cold \u2013 even colder in parts of the country this morning than yesterday - and in some places, it\u2019s been snowing. These facts alone were enough to cause the UK to enter a familiar state of mild crisis. But while the real dangers of freezing temperatures were made appallingly clear by the dreadful news that three boys have died after they fell into an icy lake in Solihull on Sunday, that was a thankfully isolated incident. For the most part, the country slowed but did not come to a standstill. Many of the most serious issues that reared up as temperatures dropped \u2013 like the news that English hospitals are making emergency plans in case of power loss \u2013 were more to do with the energy crisis caused by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine than an innate inability to cope with bad weather. That didn\u2019t stop everyone from thinking of themselves as heroic Arctic explorers for getting to the shops, though. If it is quite hard to remember that temperatures like this aren\u2019t that unusual for December when you\u2019re shivering through them, it is even harder to figure out how to prepare for them in advance. For today\u2019s newsletter, I spoke to Tera Allas, a former chief economist in the UK\u2019s energy, transport and business departments, about how you go about making a country resilient in bad weather \u2013 and how you decide what\u2019s worth protecting against. Here are the headlines. Five big stories  Strikes | Nurses\u2019 strikes will go ahead this week after talks ended in deadlock, with the Royal College of Nursing condemning ministers\u2019 \u201cbelligerence\u201d for refusing to discuss pay. Meanwhile, rail workers begin a 48-hour strike on Tuesday after RMT union members rejected a pay offer. Here\u2019s a calendar of the stoppages expected in December. Sam Bankman-Fried | Police in the Bahamas have arrested the founder of collapsed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, the country\u2019s attorney general said on Monday. The arrest came just 24 hours before Bankman-Fried was due to testify before US Congress. NHS | A \u201cdecade of neglect\u201d has weakened the NHS to the point that it will not be able to tackle the 7 million-strong backlog of care, a government-commissioned report has concluded. The paper by the King\u2019s Fund says years of denying funding to the health service has left it with too few staff. Energy | Researchers have reportedly made a breakthrough in the quest for a \u201cnear-limitless, safe, clean\u201d source of energy by getting more out of a nuclear fusion reaction than they put in. Experts stressed that while the results would be an important proof of principle, the technology is not ready for practical applications. Tobacco | New Zealand has introduced a steadily rising smoking age to stop those aged 14 and under from ever being able to legally buy cigarettes in world-first legislation to outlaw smoking for the next generation. The new law will not restrict vape sales.  In depth: \u2018You need to consider what is optimal if something only happens once every 10 years\u2019  *** How cold is it, actually? Well, look, pretty cold, but nothing to get your frozen knickers in a twist about. Sunday was the coldest night of 2022 in the UK, with temperatures of almost -16C recorded in Braemar, Aberdeenshire, and -10C in Cumbria. It got even colder overnight in Braemar, reaching -17C. But the Met Office\u2019s chief meteorologist Steve Willington says \u201cthese temperatures are not that unusual for this time of year\u201d. That -17C measurement pales in comparison with last year\u2019s -23C, also recorded at Braemar \u2013 the coldest temperature since 1995. So why are there a gazillion frozen cobwebs on my Instagram feed? One suggestion: Oli Claydon, also of the Met Office, tells the Guardian\u2019s Damian Carrington that it may feel noticeably cold because of how abrupt a change it is from the third warmest autumn on record. We have fairly short memories for this stuff. Also, frozen cobwebs are nice! *** Is this kind of weather connected to the climate crisis? No, writes Damian: \u201cCold conditions are expected in winter, with the weather then varying above and below the average from week to week.\u201d That\u2019s not evidence that the climate crisis isn\u2019t real, though. In general, the expectation is that climate change will make extreme cold weather less likely in the UK, instead leading to \u201cmilder and wetter\u201d winters, as this piece for The Conversation from last year sets out \u2013 noting that \u201cno one under the age of 42 [now 43] has lived through what could be considered a historically cold winter season in central England.\u201d *** How severe is the impact? In general, severe enough to cause real disruption; maybe not severe enough to justify headlines about Britain \u201cgrinding to a halt\u201d. Motorways and major roads closed in the south-east, Gwyn Topham writes, while rail services on Greater Anglia, Southeastern, and East Midlands Railway were among those affected. 300 flights were cancelled across the UK on Sunday and Monday. Power prices briefly hit record levels, while Jasper Jolly and Alex Lawson write that two coal-fired power stations were put on emergency standby, but were not ultimately needed. Policymakers look at the direct economic impact of bad weather \u2013 but they will set lost output against the likelihood that much of it will be caught up when conditions improve. Many public estimates have a finger-in-the-icy-wind quality, but for a rough sense of scale, a robust analysis by the Office for National Statistics in 2010 gave a central estimate of the daily cost of transport disruption from severe winter weather then at \u00a3280m. When figuring out wider impacts, Tera Allas, director of research and economics at McKinsey UK, says that it\u2019s important to also \u201ctake into account the impact on health and life. So, for example, there will be a cost in carbon emissions. And if there are fatalities, there\u2019s a wellbeing cost to friends and relatives.\u201d One way to build those kinds of factors into analysis is to be guided by the costs of insurance against extreme weather events. You can also ask about the value of people\u2019s time, Allas said: \u201cLet\u2019s say people lose 12 hours of their life sitting in traffic or something as a result of significant disruption \u2013 you can do what economists call \u2018willingness to pay\u2019 surveys: how much would you pay to avoid it? People are quite bad at predicting what they would pay, but it gives you a relative measure.\u201d *** How does the government think about preparing for the cold?  It\u2019s complicated \u2013 in part because you are trying to assess how much it\u2019s worth investing to prevent something that might not happen often, and predicting long-term events is very hard to do precisely. \u201cYou do a cost-benefit analysis,\u201d said Allas. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like an insurance policy. So let\u2019s take, for example, road conditions in the UK: having grit bins at the side of the road doesn\u2019t cost much to have and maintain. Other mitigation options like snow ploughs or forcing everyone to use winter tyres will be more expensive. And you need to consider what is optimal if something only happens once every ten years, or once every hundred years.\u201d That\u2019s part of why you\u2019ll occasionally see headlines about the UK\u2019s abject failure to prepare for extremely severe hot or cold weather: it just doesn\u2019t happen often enough, with high enough costs, to justify preparing as the Middle East or Scandinavia might. Still, there are legitimate reasons for concern about the quality of recent governmental planning. In October, a report by parliament\u2019s Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy warned that, even as climate change bites, no single minister has responsibility for ensuring the resilience of Critical National Infrastructure (CNI). The committee pointed to incidents like the death of three people in a 2020 train derailment caused by torrential rains in Stonehaven, Aberdeenshire as the cost. Another factor: there\u2019s no point in spending up front if you aren\u2019t going to keep everything working. \u201cThere\u2019s a scenario where you build up that capability, let\u2019s say ploughs or de-icing machinery or whatever, but the event is so rare that you don\u2019t practice using it. If you don\u2019t take those maintenance costs into account, you spend a bunch of money without getting the benefit.\u201d *** Has austerity changed that analysis? One problem with the real world application of these methods: \u201cPeople are not the rational robots that economists often used in their models. We all have biases,\u201d said Allas. Central government economists will contribute to the \u201cgreen book\u201d guide for evaluating policy, but different departments and levels of government will inevitably have different costs, priorities and incentives. \u201cAnd it\u2019s really hard to compare different things in a unified metric, it can feel like apples and oranges.\u201d If it\u2019s hard enough to agree on what to prioritise, it gets harder still when resources are reduced, as they have been since 2010: it is very easy to find reports of councils economising, and even if we have a lot more gritting machines with hilarious names these days, that may not amuse people that much in, say, West Sussex, which had 38 gritters in 2008/9 and now has just 19. There\u2019s also the question of whether tighter budgets reduce the ability to think long-term. This is not an area where Allas has seen detailed evidence, she cautioned. \u201cBut when people are under any kind of stress they are more prone to cognitive biases. If you\u2019re running from a tiger, you don\u2019t think long-term. You just want to get out of the tiger\u2019s way.\u201d What else we\u2019ve been reading  The sSpiralling violence in Haiti, particularly in its urban centres, has spared almost no one \u2013 and that includes the media.

                    "body": "This was never going to be an occasion short of lasting images. Perhaps the most memorable from a night Wales will always treasure was the sight of Gareth Bale singing along to Yma o Hyd as the entire squad, some wearing tricolour bucket hats that are a nod to their last appearance at a World Cup in 1958, all moonlighting as Dafydd Iwan\u2019s backing choir, swayed to the soundtrack of their journey to Qatar. Tony Roberts, the goalkeeping coach who rushed to Wayne Hennessey at the final whistle following his heroic performance and led the team on an impromptu conga down the tunnel, played the role of conductor.\nAfter a glossary of painful near-misses, Wales will again play on the world stage after edging out Ukraine in a nail-biting and fraught playoff final.\n\nFrom Bale being deep in conversation with Oleksandr Zinchenko seconds after the final whistle to all four sides of this stadium applauding Ukraine as they trudged off the pitch, emotions were, understandably, in overdrive. Then there was Aaron Ramsey pulling his shirt over his head, fresh from clutching his son, wearing a replica No 10 shirt, in his arms. Connor Roberts collapsed to the floor and repeatedly punched the air in a state of disbelief. Daniel James piggy-backed a member of backroom staff. Bale blew kisses towards his family. Robert Page beat his chest.\nPerhaps the moment reality struck was when Wales\u2019s players suddenly surged from the halfway line to slide on their torsos en masse before the Canton Stand, home to the \u201cRed Wall\u201d, though Ben Davies and Jonny Williams, busy celebrating at the opposite end of the stadium, had some ground to make up. That came after Ukraine\u2019s players went over to a corner where their 1,700 fans were housed. A communal thunder clap of sorts followed and thousands of home supporters joined in what was another moving moment. In their dressing room Ukraine\u2019s players displayed a flag scribbled with handwritten messages from soldiers. The Football Association of Wales, which estimates qualification is worth around \u00a310m, also gave 100 tickets to Ukrainian refugees.\n\nFor Page, sticking with Hennessey was a big call but ultimately an inspired one. The 35-year-old Burnley goalkeeper, who celebrated his 100th cap for his country in March, made a series of improbable saves, the pick of the bunch surely the sprawling left-hand stop to deny the substitute Artem Dovbyk heading in Vitalii Mykolenko\u2019s cross late on.\nBen Davies was outstanding in defence and there was no way Neco Williams was going to be on the losing side, throwing his body on the line into five minutes of second-half stoppage time to prevent Andriy Yarmolenko from finding an equaliser. It seemed cruel that Yarmolenko\u2019s first-half own goal, from a devilish Bale free-kick, would prove the difference. Ukraine must somehow regroup, while Wales can start preparing for England, Iran and USA in Group B.\n\nImmediately after the goal, Davies tapped his temples, urging calm among his teammates, and with good reason. Ukraine were desperately unlucky not be in front and should have had a first-half penalty. From the moment Zinchenko had a quick free-kick disallowed on three minutes, they panicked Wales and the midfielder Ruslan Malinovskyi picked holes in the home defence. Davies embodied Wales\u2019s spirit. The defender made a block with 15 minutes to play when Yarmolenko side-footed the ball goalwards after Ukraine scooped the ball into the box.\nAt the same time, a minute earlier Wales could have doubled their advantage. The substitute Brennan Johnson, who will surely play a big part at the finals, struck a post and seconds later, after another surge by Johnson, Bale was denied by the Ukraine goalkeeper Georgiy Bushchan after meeting Ramsey\u2019s twirling cross. Ramsey was also guilty of missing a wonderful opening early in the second half, placing his shot wide after collecting Kieffer Moore\u2019s centre.\n\nIwan, the Welsh folk singer, was moved up the pecking order before kick-off and received a hero\u2019s welcome before his first rendition of Yma o Hyd. Ukraine\u2019s players, who again sung the national anthem draped in their national flags, were applauded by the Welsh fans who had a front-row seat of their final warmup shuttle runs. \u201cTonight, now is our time,\u201d the stadium announcer predicted before an inevitably stirring rendition of Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau. How he was right.\nUkraine\u2019s head coach, Oleksandr Petrakov, his glasses condensed with rainwater and jacket sodden, had no complaints with his team but could feel aggrieved at how, five minutes before the break, the video assistant referee did not tell the referee, Antonio Mateu Lahoz, to take a closer look at a collision between Joe Allen and Yarmolenko. Allen, caught cold by Yarmolenko\u2019s shuffle towards the ball, clearly clipped the Ukraine captain\u2019s heels in the box but play instead continued. Moments earlier, Hennessey rushed across to his near post to keep out a rattled drive at goal from Zinchenko.\nWales rode their luck, but they will fly their flag in Qatar. There was a feverish atmosphere before kick-off and nothing remotely close to a lull from start to finish."

                    "body": "Video Assistant Referee Changed My Life. It\u2019s not the most likely headline, but in Yassine \u201cBono\u201d Bounou\u2019s case it\u2019s true. \u201cEveryone is talking about him now,\u201d Julen Lopetegui says. Two years ago, the Wolves and former Sevilla manager knows, plenty were talking about him too, just not for the right reason. Luckily, every now and then the VAR does something that suggests it\u2019s not completely awful, and this was one of those times. That night, it rescued the man who has ended up rescuing Morocco, en route to making World Cup history.\nIt was February 2020, the Europa League round of 32. With a minute remaining against Cluj a fairly tame shot slipped under Bono\u2019s body and into the net. Sevilla were out and so, in all probability, was he. Signed on loan from Girona, Bono was back up to Tomas Vaclik. He had played just 45 minutes in the league and two Copa del Rey games against fourth-tier opposition. The Europa League was his competition and, amidst whistles and tension, that had gone. So had he: that option to buy wouldn\u2019t be taken up now.\n\nBut then the replays detected a handball in the buildup, the goal was ruled out and Sevilla scraped through on away goals. By the end of the season, they had won the competition and Bono was staying. He was also a hero \u2013 if not as much of one as he has become since. \u201cIt seems strange to imagine it, but his growth owes something to the VAR, but most of all to him,\u201d the Sevilla goalkeeper coach Jose Luis Silva says.\nThings were about to change. Within ten days of the game against Cluj, the pandemic closed stadiums, putting football on hold. Vaclik got injured; Bono got opportunities, and in conditions that allowed for his recovery to be complete. When they came back, games were played behind closed doors. Sevilla set up in Cologne for meetings with Wolves, Roma, Manchester United and Inter Milan. Against Wolves, Bono saved a Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez penalty and made a handful of superb saves against United. In the final, Romelu Lukaku was the man denied by an astonishing stop.\nBono had a winner\u2019s medal, a contract, and a place as starter. It wasn\u2019t enough just to make saves, he scored too. A new era had begun, his talent beginning to tell. Last season he won the Zamora award for La Liga\u2019s best goalkeeper having conceded fewer than anyone. He has gone eight hours and a penalty shootout without an opponent beating him in Qatar \u2013 the only goal conceded was a freak own goal against Canada, the country where Bono was born and that he turned down at international level. An exceptional late save prevented Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix from equalising for Portugal and he also denied Cristiano Ronaldo in added time. Morocco became the first African team to make the semi-finals.\n\nNot that you would know it afterwards looking at how ridiculously calm Bono remained. Silva cracks up. \u201cHonestly, Me and Marko [Dimitrovic, Sevilla\u2019s second keeper] have tried to be like him and it\u2019s impossible,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible how calm he is: we talk about it, laugh at it. His calmness is worthy of study. He never seems worried, and that\u2019s an important tool. It\u2019s not relaxation because when it comes to competing, he has the tension he needs.\u201d\nHe has always been like that. Born in Montreal, Bono is the son of a physics professor at university, and speaks five languages including Spanish with a soft Argentinian accent: he is an Argentina fan who sent his shirt to Ariel Ortega after the Spain game and named his dog after the forward \u2013 which will be awkward if they face each other in the final. Lopetegui describes him as having a \u201cprivileged mind\u201d. Talk to teammates from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, his first club in Spain having left Casablanca, and they say the same.\nThere, he often trained with the first team \u2013 the year Atl\u00e9tico won the league \u2013 and played with the B team. Tranquilo is the word, Isaac Nana says. Sergio Cidoncha says: \u201cVery polite, quiet, so much so he almost went unnoticed. An introvert \u2013 and a brilliant goalkeeper.\u201d\n\nThat tranquility perhaps hid the tension in those early months at Sevilla. There was a moment, says the former Sevilla goalkeeper Andr\u00e9s Palop, soon after arrival at the club from Girona when he didn\u2019t seem to have much confidence in himself. \u201cI think he has grown a lot psychologically; and when he had to replace Vaclik, an undisputed starter, doing so during the pandemic helped him to not have too much pressure at a club where there\u2019s always pressure. He has become very strong in that sense.\u201d\nSilva agrees: \u201cThat moment had affected him, as it would any keeper. He took a step forward during the pandemic. There\u2019s no fans, we\u2019re in Cologne, and his development is helped by that. He hadn\u2019t had the opportunities he really needed before, to show his qualities.\u201d\nThose qualities are many. Palop provides a detailed technical analysis of a goalkeeper he describes as \u201cvery complete\u201d and \u201camong the 10 best in the world\u201d: quick, with considerable reach and an advanced starting position, reading of the game, brave in the air, excellent one-on-one, good with his feet to escape the press and initiate play.\n\u201cWhen he came he was a very good reactive goalkeeper: despite his height and his size, he was fast, had good reflexes,\u201d says Silva. \u201cThe coaches at Girona said he was fantastic with his feet. What evolved was his ability to understand the game. He\u2019s adaptable, his understanding and behaviour is perfect. He worked here with [Jorge] Sampaoli and Lopetegui, who place a lot of importance on that understanding: looking for the free man, choosing the right zones. Even in dangerous situations, he\u2019s good. You\u2019ll see him dribble or even roulette.\u201d\n\nThat was seen against Spain. So were the penalties. Afterwards, Bono said he knew about Pablo Sarabia, who took the first, but that he had not really studied them. It was, he suggested, more intuitive, a lot of luck involved.\nAnd yet this is the man who has saved a penalty from Erling Haaland, who became the first goalkeeper to stop one from Mikel Oyarzabal, a specialist; denied Nabil Fekir in a Seville derby; and against Spain kept out a spot-kick from Carlos Soler, who once scored a hat-trick of them against Real Madrid and Thibaut Courtois. Silva doesn\u2019t buy it, either: \u201cWell, he says that,\u201d the goalkeeper coach says, suggesting that there is more work and less chance than Bono wants to suggest. And that, too, says something.\n\u201cHe\u2019s never had any arrogance and never will,\u201d Silva insists. \u201cBono has values that are hard to find in football. He spent almost the whole year not playing and I never heard a bad word, a gesture. He always helped Tomas. I think he\u2019s the goalkeeper who has best accepted being a sub of all those I have coached. He always knew that his moment had to arrive, and now it has. In life, you always get something back and he has.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s very calm, very mature, very balanced,\u201d Lopetegui says. \u201cHe\u2019s an example: when he didn\u2019t play, he kept quiet, supported his teammates and worked. He\u2019s a pleasure to work with. He\u2019s humble, and humility and intelligence always go together. He was a starter by the end of the first year, then the Zamora. Everyone is talking about him now. He\u2019s got his reward and I\u2019m very pleased for him.\u201d"

                    "body": "Good morning. Eight years of growth in living standards will be wiped out by 2024. Unemployment may rise by half a million. And Britain is in recession. Those were the stark takeaways from the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s assessment of the public finances yesterday \u2013 and in his autumn statement, Jeremy Hunt did everything he could to spread the blame around the world. \u201cThere is a global energy crisis, a global inflation crisis and a global economic crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cThere may be a recession made in Russia, but there is a recovery made in Britain.\u201d Labour weren\u2019t having any of it \u2013 and you might expect that the public will be receptive to their critique of the government\u2019s record. So what does that critique look like \u2013 and are voters ready to hear an alternative? For today\u2019s newsletter, I spoke to political pollster Joe Twyman about how public opinion will shape the fight over the public finances that is likely to define the next couple of years in politics. Here are the headlines. Five big stories  Cop27 | UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has warned of a breakdown in trust between \u201cdeveloped and emerging economies\u201d at climate talks in Egypt. The country\u2019s foreign minister has given a gloomy assessment of the state of the meeting with only one full day of official negotiations to go. Twitter | Twitter temporarily closed its offices on Thursday as hundreds of reported resignations came after employees were asked to sign a pledge to work \u201clong hours at high intensity\u201d. Jamal Khashoggi | The Biden administration has told a US court that Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, should be granted sovereign immunity in a civil case involving the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, effectively ending a last ditch attempt to hold him legally accountable for the 2018 killing. MH17 | A Dutch court has found three men guilty of the murder of 298 people on board flight MH17, which was shot down by a Russian surface-to-air missile when it was flying over eastern Ukraine in 2014. The Kremlin has always denied any involvement, while claiming it was excluded from the investigation. Health | The world\u2019s first vaccine to treat deadly cancerous brain tumours can potentially give patients years of extra life, a global clinical trial has concluded. One of the trial\u2019s chief investigators said the evidence showed DCVax had resulted in \u201castonishing\u201d enhanced survival for patients.  In depth: Why the fight over \u2018economic competence\u2019 is key to Starmer\u2019s strategy  When shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves stood up to respond to Jeremy Hunt\u2019s autumn statement (see the key points at a glance here), she sought to paint a picture of her opponents as, above all, inept. \u201cAll the country got was an invoice for the economic carnage the government has created,\u201d she said. \u201cNever again can the Conservatives claim to be the party of economic competence.\u201d That\u2019s been a common theme in Labour\u2019s attacks since Kwasi Kwarteng\u2019s manic mini-budget: handcuff Hunt and Rishi Sunak to their predecessors. It\u2019s a powerful rhetorical attack, and it won praise in some quarters: for the Spectator, Patrick O\u2019Flynn wrote that Reeves was the most effective critic of the Tory record \u201csince Gordon Brown faced off against Ken Clarke in the early 1990s\u201d. But critics would say it leaves something big on the table: a positive vision of what Labour would do differently. One big question for the next two years is whether those constraints align with the way voters see things. *** What kind of impact has the arrival of Sunak and Hunt had on the polls? At the Conservatives\u2019 nadir during Liz Truss\u2019s cameo premiership (hang on, rewind a second! I swear that was Liz Truss! Why isn\u2019t she in the credits?), Labour regularly had polling leads of more than 30 points. \u201cSunak has closed the gap a little,\u201d said Twyman, director of public opinion consultancy Deltapoll and former head of political and social research at YouGov. \u201cNow the Tories are in the mid to high 20s, and the Labour share has dropped from about 55% to 50%, or just below \u2013 a margin of a bit over 20 points. So he has improved things for them, but to suggest it\u2019s from a low base is an understatement. It\u2019s still a huge margin.\u201d *** Could the gap tighten? Because the Truss era was such a bewildering anomaly against all historical standards, the solidity of the resulting shifts in the polls are hard to assess. \u201cWhen pollsters like me look at the data, we\u2019re looking for the difference between a talking point and a turning point,\u201d Twyman said. \u201cThat\u2019s really, really important. The difficulty is that you rarely know you\u2019re in a turning point at the time.\u201d You can see it both ways: on the one hand, Sunak has plenty of evidence for his assertion that he was never on the same side of the debate as Truss, and as inflation comes down, his own numbers might go up; on the other, voters are likely to be pretty sceptical of taking another spin at Tory roulette, and it\u2019s much harder to rebuild a reputation than lose it. \u201cTruss looks like a turning point,\u201d said Twyman. \u201cSunak may be a turning point in the other direction, but probably a smaller one. But if British politics has taught us anything in recent years, it\u2019s that you simply cannot predict what\u2019s going to happen next.\u201d *** How do voters rate the two parties on the economy?  There are indications that Sunak has made progress on this measure. \u201cDuring the Truss month in power, the Tories were regularly at half Labour\u2019s score on the economy,\u201d Twyman said. \u201cThat\u2019s now a gap that has closed. They\u2019re still about ten points behind, but it\u2019s an improvement.\u201d Indeed, one Opinium poll for the Observer last month found that while Labour still led on most issues, a Sunak government was preferred to a Starmer one on the economy by 33% to 29%. Even an outlier Tory lead on that measure in the current circumstances may suggest that on perceptions of economic competence, Labour is working against the grain. *** How much does that matter? A lot. \u201cIt has never, in the whole postwar period, been the case that any party has won the most seats while being behind on leadership and the economy,\u201d Twyman said. At the moment, preference on the economy is closely related to preference overall. But there\u2019s a subtle question here that goes beyond the remit of most polling: how, exactly, voters construct the idea of \u201ceconomic competence\u201d. \u201cIt is a really difficult thing to tie down and it varies from individual to individual,\u201d Twyman said. The Conservatives\u2019 success over the last decade has been to reinforce the idea that good stewardship of the public finances means balancing the books (and fixing the roof while the sun shines, not maxing out the credit card, filling the black hole, and other intuitive but contested metaphors).  One way forward for Labour is to tell voters that they\u2019re just better at this stuff than the Tories; another is to reframe the question and persuade the public that public investment is the best way to restore growth. Also, Twyman adds, \u201cthere\u2019s an important distinction between overall economic competence and specifically the cost of living crisis.\u201d At the moment, \u201cthe vast majority of people see the cost of living as the important issue facing both the country and themselves, with the economy (and all other things) much lower down.\u201d That makes sense: gilt yields are likely to seem a bit irrelevant if you can\u2019t pay your gas bill. *** What\u2019s Labour\u2019s strategy? Reeves\u2019s speech yesterday was full of punchy lines \u2013 but they were more focused on making the government sound like bungling, venal morons than advancing a different theory of the economy. She compared the Conservatives to pickpockets and the cast of 80s soap opera Dallas; she criticised tax rises and the loss of \u00a36.7bn to Covid fraud. She cast the Tories as the stooges of non-doms and energy giants. Mostly, she made it sound like Jeremy Hunt is crap at his job. But she did gesture towards a more fundamental critique when she said: \u201cNo other advanced economy is cutting spending or increasing taxes on working people as they head into a recession.\u201d The question now is which of those positions Labour makes its focus: as more reassuring narrators of the old story about the economy, or as authors of a new one.  The Guardian\u2019s editorial today finds Labour wanting on that score: \u201c[Hunt] knows that elections are fought not between conflicting answers to the same question, but rather between conflicting questions,\u201d it reads. \u201cYet Labour is not offering any competition for people\u2019s thinking.\u201d \u201cSince the 2019 election, Labour\u2019s position seems to have been simply to say, \u2018I wouldn\u2019t do that\u2019,\u201d Twyman said. \u201cWhen the Conservatives are shooting themselves in the foot, that\u2019s quite an effective strategy. If they do better, it becomes about broad narratives. The 50% of voters who are less engaged than average aren\u2019t paying attention to the minutiae: they\u2019re asking themselves, is it fair, is it effective, and will it do right for people like me.\u201d *** Read more on the autumn statement  Zoe Wood explains what the autumn statement will mean for you on everything from income tax to help with energy bills. Heather Stewart has a useful guide to where the cuts outlined by Hunt are likely to fall, from defence to the Home Office \u2013 with health and education spending protected for now. Local government leaders say that even the bigger council tax bills allowed by the autumn statement will not prevent more cuts to services, Patrick Butler reports. One estimate suggests that even if three-quarters of councils raise bills by the maximum allowed, there will still be a \u00a37bn funding shortfall. Pippa Crerar reports on a mood of resignation among Tory MPs: \u201cIn the hours after the statement, downbeat Tory MPs mostly rowed in behind the chancellor, but many felt they had little choice. \u2018I suppose it could have been worse,\u2019 was the best one could muster.\u201d A Guardian panel of writers, including Polly Toynbee, Miatta Fahnbulleh, and Frances Ryan, give their verdict on the government\u2019s economic plan. \u201cThis statement was a lesson in kicking the can down the road,\u201d writes Ryan. Kevin Rawlinson reports on the reaction in Jeremy Hunt\u2019s South West Surrey constituency, now a target for the Liberal Democrats. \u201cEveryone is in crisis, [the price of] everything is going up,\u201d says Kelly Clark. \u201cWith the country in recession, we are screwed.\u201d  What else we\u2019ve been reading  What\u2019s it like to know war is about to land on your doorstep?

The front pages  A full guide to Friday\u2019s newspapers is here; the usual summary follows. Reactions to Jeremy Hunt\u2019s autumn statement dominate UK front pages, with the Guardian\u2019s headline reading \u201cFrom bad to worse\u201d. The i splashes with \u201cUK\u2019s lost decade\u201d while the Mirror\u2019s headline simply reads \u201cCarnage\u201d. The Mail turns its ire on Hunt\u2019s budget with the headline \u201cTories soak the strivers\u201d. The Telegraph too is blunt in its assessment, quoting an economist in its headline: \u201c\u2018The rhetoric of Osborne\u2026 with the policies of Brown\u2019\u201d. The Times writes that as the chancellor seeks to balance the books, there will be \u201cYears of tax pain ahead\u201d. The Financial Times carries a similar headline with \u201cHunt paves way for years of pain\u201d. Scotland\u2019s Daily Record harks back to another era of Tory rule with the headline \u201cYou\u2019ve never had it so bad\u201d, while the Sun relegates the autumn statement to a small article on its front page, with the headline \u201cTax hell..

We encountered a technical blip which resulted in a few emails not being sent \u2013 what\u2019s a launch without a hiccup?\nA technical hitch might be the least of our concerns, given the Reserve Bank today decided to lift the cash rate by a further 25 basis points to 2.85%. That means for individuals with a $500,000 loan, repayments are up $760 since the rate rises began. With low- and middle-income earners shouldering the burden of the inflation crisis, it might explain why murmurs of a windfall tax on oil companies were heard in both Washington and Sydney today. More on this below.\nTop news\n\n\nRBA rate rise | The seventh consecutive rate rise was a certainty after the September consumer price index rose to 7.3%, higher than expected. The RBA governor, Philip Lowe, says inflation is expected to continue rising over coming months, peaking at 8% later this year.\nMelbourne Cup | Gold Trip has taken the cup on a day of wild weather that brought the typical Melbourne combo \u2013 wind, rain, hail and yes, teasing specks of sunshine. But according to the latest Essential poll, most Australians probably weren\u2019t tuning into the race.\nVictoria\u2019s wettest month | October was the wettest recorded in the state. And the dark skies aren\u2019t dissipating just yet, with the SES warning the flood risk may persist for up to two months.\nChina unhappy | China has scorned US-Australian plans to station nuclear-capable American B-52 bombers in Darwin, accusing the two nations of escalating regional tensions. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson warned the move \u201cmay trigger an arms race in the region\u201d.\n\n\n\nElon Musk | Jacinda Ardern urged the billionaire to \u201cstick strongly to the principle of transparency\u201d, warning that disinformation was adversely \u201cimpacting liberal democracies worldwide\u201d. Musk further entrenched his control of Twitter overnight by dissolving the board and appointing himself chief executive. Twitter employees are bracing for extensive layoffs, with the Washington Post reporting 25% of the workforce could go in a first round of sackings.\nBiden windfall tax | The US president, Joe Biden, has accused oil companies of \u201cwar profiteering\u201d as he raised the possibility of imposing a windfall tax if companies don\u2019t boost domestic production \u2013 a week out from the US midterms. The Australian treasurer, Jim Chalmers, hinted that a similar move here might not be out of the question, saying there was \u201ca pretty strong view in the community that we need to get a return for our resources\u201d.\nSwift coup | Taylor Swift has become the first artist in history to claim the Top 10 slots on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the US, with tracks from her latest album, Midnights.\n\nFull Story\n\nThe story of Daniel Andrews: dogged, divisive and enduringly popular\nVeteran journalist Margaret Simons speaks to Laura Murphy-Oates about the rise of Daniel Andrews and why, despite lockdowns, scandals and a reputation as Australia\u2019s most divisive premier, he appears set to win another term.

                    "body": "The former MEP at the centre of a cash for influence scandal that has rocked the European parliament has reached a deal with prosecutors to provide information on the corruption network in exchange for a \u201climited\u201d prison sentence. In a statement, Belgium\u2019s federal prosecutor announced that Pier Antonio Panzeri had signed a memorandum, where he pledged to make \u201crevealing, truthful and complete statements\u201d about the involvement of third parties and, \u201cif applicable\u201d, his own involvement in criminal offences. Panzeri, an MEP from 2004\u201319, was one of four suspects charged with money laundering, corruption and participating in a criminal organisation last December, after police recovered nearly \u20ac1.5m (then \u00a31.3m) in bags of cash at several locations across Brussels, including his home. He has been accused of taking money from the governments of Qatar and Morocco in an attempt to influence decisions in the parliament.  Panzeri was due to appear in court earlier on Tuesday to appeal against his pre-trial detention but pulled out for \u201cpersonal reasons\u201d, according to an earlier statement from the prosecutor. According to the latest statement, he has pledged to inform investigators about how the fraud operated, including who was involved and the identity of people he admits to having bribed. In exchange, he will receive \u201ca limited sentence\u201d, which includes prison, a fine, and the confiscation of assets acquired through the fraud, estimated to be \u20ac1m, the statement said. The deal \u2013 only the second of its kind in Belgian history \u2013 is a significant milestone in the case that could implicate others who gave and took bribes. The other suspects are Panzeri\u2019s former assistant Francesco Giorgi, and Giorgi\u2019s partner, Greek MEP Eva Kaili, as well as Niccol\u00f2 Fig\u00e0-Talamanca, the head of an NGO. Giorgi has been reported by Belgian and Italian media to have confessed and sought to exonerate his partner. His lawyer has declined to comment. Kaili\u2019s lawyers have rejected all charges of wrongdoing and Fig\u00e0-Talamanca\u2019s family have proclaimed his innocence."

                    "body": "Australia are expected to be confirmed as the host nation of the 2027 Rugby World Cup on Thursday and could target Eddie Jones to help their bid for success on home soil. World Rugby\u2019s council will meet in Dublin to confirm the host nations of the 2027 and 2031 tournaments \u2013 the latter lined up to break new ground in the US \u2013 as well as the next three women\u2019s World Cup tournaments.  Australia has been identified as the preferred bidder for the 2027 men\u2019s tournament and after the union secured the necessary financial backing from the federal government in March, it is little more than a formality that they will be confirmed on Thursday. World Rugby overhauled its bidding process after the controversial decision to award France the 2023 tournament five years ago, after South Africa had been recommended in an independent evaluation, and another late U-turn is inconceivable. Australia last hosted the World Cup in 2003, when England were crowned champions following Jonny Wilkinson\u2019s famous drop goal against Jones\u2019s Wallabies in the final. Jones\u2019s contract with England ends after the 2023 tournament and, though he has recently been linked with a move to Racing 92, his future after ending ties with the Rugby Football Union is unclear. Dave Rennie is the incumbent Australia head coach and it is thought his deal could be extended until the British &amp; Irish Lions tour of Australia in 2025, depending on how his side fare at France 2023. The Brumbies head coach, Dan McKellar, is being lined up as his potential successor \u2013 though flopping in France would no doubt lead to a rethink \u2013 and Jones\u2019s experience and track record at World Cups is not lost on Rugby Australia. Indeed, the governing body could seek Jones\u2019s assistance in a broader capacity for the 2027 tournament. In 2019, before Rennie was appointed, Jones was linked briefly with a move back home following the Japan World Cup. His departure in 2005 was acrimonious but the 2027 bid team have expressed a desire to have Jones on board. Last month the former Wallabies hooker and bid leader Phil Kearns said: \u201cI think it would be awesome if Eddie had a role in the future of Australian rugby. I think those [broken] bridges should well and truly be rebuilt and pave the way for Eddie to come back in some role.\u201d The decision to award the 2031 tournament to the US, meanwhile, will be hugely significant as rugby union seeks to expand into new commercial markets. The US president, Joe Biden, has given his written endorsement of the bid but there is nonetheless scope for embarrassment if the US team fail to advance through their playoff against Chile and reach the 2023 World Cup tournament. The World Rugby council is also expected to confirm England as hosts of the 2025 women\u2019s World Cup and award the 2029 and 2033 tournaments to Australia and the US respectively. The delayed 2021 tournament will take place in New Zealand in the autumn with England the favourites to reclaim the title they won in 2014.  The council will also vote on whether to make the five global law trials \u2013 including the 50:22 and the goalline drop-out \u2013 permanent. While the 50:22 law has received popular support and is expected to gain the 75% majority to be adopted long-term, it is understood there is some opposition to the goalline drop-out from within the home nations, which could lead to it being ditched. It was recently identified by the current England captain, Courtney Lawes, as the one law he would do away with if he had the chance. It is also understood that World Rugby has abandoned any plans to trial the 20-minute red card law on a global scale amid widespread opposition from within the northern hemisphere. All the while, discussions continue in Dublin over the proposal for a north versus south \u201cNations Championship\u201d to be launched in 2026. A concrete decision would be made at World Rugby\u2019s next council meeting in November but stakeholders perceive this week as crucial for progress to be made if the tournament is to come to pass."

The side has been transformed since then, with Thursday bringing an opportunity to bury those demons in Buttler\u2019s first tournament as captain.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve actually just been talking about that in the dressing room, a few of us,\u201d he said. \u201cAny time you go back to certain grounds, there\u2019s some moments, some memories \u2013 and not always good ones, unfortunately. It was a real line in the sand, I would say, that moment in English cricket. To now be in a semi-final, and going into tournaments with a level of expectation that we should perform well, is a great place to be as a team.\u201d\nButtler backed Phil Salt to make an impact in the game if called upon, with Dawid Malan, who has a minor groin strain, and Mark Wood, who has been battling \u201cstiffness\u201d, both injury doubts. Malan was restricted to gently batting away a few low-pace throwdowns in the nets on Wednesday, while Wood \u2013 who generally bowls only briefly on the day before a game \u2013 attempted a dozen deliveries.\n\u201cWe will give it as long as we can with those guys, and as always we have 15 guys preparing to play,\u201d Buttler said. \u201cWe have some fantastic players who have not yet played in the tournament, and they will be desperate to make their mark. I wouldn\u2019t expect them to be happy that they\u2019re not playing \u2013 everyone should have the belief that they deserve to be in the XI and have full confidence that if they get their chance, they\u2019ll perform.\u201d\nSalt came into the tournament competing with Alex Hales for a spot alongside Buttler at the top of England\u2019s batting order, but having come out on the wrong side of that call has not played at all. Nevertheless his attitude in training has been widely praised.\n\n\u201cI think he has a fantastic mindset,\u201d Buttler said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t fear anyone and is someone who wants to get on the front foot and take a game on. He embodies quite a lot of what we speak about as a team and how we ask guys to play. Certainly I wouldn\u2019t expect to see anything else from him if he gets a chance to play. He\u2019s not someone who\u2019s going to shy away from an occasion, he\u2019s someone who will definitely take it on.\u201d\nThere is an interesting contrast here with India, who played the previously unused Rishabh Pant in their final group game in case he is needed during the knockout stages. Rohit Sharma explained on Wednesday that \u201cwe wanted to give him some time and have some options if we want to make changes\u201d since \u201cit would be unfair to just bring the guy from nowhere and make him play\u201d.\nWith no fitness concerns, India\u2019s one selection quandary is whether to keep Pant in the side or to bring back Dinesh Karthik.\nOne key battle will be between Buttler and Bhuvneshwar Kumar, which has in the past been completely one-sided. Buttler has faced 32 deliveries from Kumar in T20 internationals, scored 30 runs, got out five times and has an average of six; England\u2019s innings will almost certainly start with Buttler facing Kumar. \u201cThere\u2019s always certain bowlers that you find harder than others, or at certain times in your career you have good times against them and bad times against them,\u201d Buttler said. \u201cBut I certainly don\u2019t fear anyone. I always prepare well and look to play the ball in front of me and not the bowler.\u201d\n\nThe most talked-about player going into the game is Suryakumar Yadav, who has lit up the tournament with three half-centuries, a strike rate of 193.96 and an array of shots that most players would be unable to produce even in their imaginations. \u201cHe\u2019s the sort of guy who just doesn\u2019t carry any baggage,\u201d said Sharma. \u201cNot his suitcase, he\u2019s got lots of suitcases. Honestly, he loves his shopping. But when it comes to carrying extra pressure, extra baggage, I don\u2019t think he has that in him.\u201d\nButtler said: \u201cI think he\u2019s probably been the batter of the tournament so far. He\u2019s obviously got all the shots, and he allows himself to play all the shots as well. But as with any batsman in the world, it takes one chance to create a wicket. We desperately need to find a way to do that.\u201d"

                    "body": "You have to thumb through five decades to find the previous time six years passed without Manchester United winning a trophy. Then, Ron Atkinson\u2019s 1983 vintage of Norman Whiteside, Gary Bailey and Bryan Robson claimed the FA Cup to bridge the gap to Tommy Docherty\u2019s XI of Stuart Pearson and Brian and Jimmy Greenhoff that had triumphed in the same competition in 1977. Erik ten Hag hopes to end the club\u2019s longest trophy drought in 40 years. The Europa League victory of May 2017 under Jos\u00e9 Mourinho is the last of United\u2019s 66 pieces of silverware (including Charity/Community Shields), the 2021 final of the same competition being the nearest miss since.  United remain alive on all four fronts \u2013 Premier League, both domestic cups and Europa League \u2013 and on Wednesday they can take a significant step towards success when they visit Nottingham Forest in the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final. Ten Hag believes the lengthy wait will inspire his team. \u201cIt belongs to this club to win trophies so we have to get back on track,\u201d he said. He does not believe his players will buckle under the weight of expectation. \u201cWe like the pressure and we need the pressure \u2013 that is good. We need to deal with that; it gives us more motivation.\u201d Ten Hag knows what a trophy could do for his nascent tenure. \u201cIt gives you confidence and once you are winning [titles] that gives you confidence that you know how to do it. And in the difficult moments you learn how you stay in the game, how to stay in to win games as you know the chances will come and, too, what you have to do to get there. \u201cWinning trophies is also mental. Winning games is one thing, winning trophies is another. In these decisive moments it is like this: know what to do. I think it is a thin line [where we are]. We grow a lot mentally but still we have a step to go. It\u2019s all about winning trophies, so we have a good opportunity but we have to go game by game.\u201d  As a manager, Ten Hag\u2019s honours list features three Eredivisie titles and two Dutch cups with Ajax, from 2018-22. \u201cIt\u2019s the best feeling you can have, winning a trophy, and I have the luck in my career to win some and it\u2019s magnificent, especially for the fans. The fans here have some experience, especially the older ones. The period Manchester United didn\u2019t win trophies is too long. We are aware of that fact and we have to start doing it again.\u201d  Forest\u2019s wait has been even longer. Since Nigel Jemson\u2019s strike beat Oldham to secure the League Cup in 1990, glory has been a stranger to a club that has won two European Cups. United\u2019s last visit to the City Ground, in February 1999, featured Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r scoring four times in an 8-1 win, and they return to a venue that is sure to be hostile. Ten Hag says: \u201cA fanatical audience is nice to play before. It will be a good atmosphere and will motivate the players and we have to get ready for that.\u201d After the 3-2 defeat at Arsenal on Sunday Ten Hag criticised his side\u2019s defending. Overall, though, he is content with a rearguard that has shut-out the opposition 13 times. \u201cIn a lot of games we did very well: we had a lot of clean sheets,\u201d he says. \u201cAgainst Man City we defended very well [in the 2-1 win]. In general against Arsenal we defended very well. They didn\u2019t get clean shots, there was one time from a free-kick. \u201cThere were a lot of defenders between the ball and the goal. All the goals were avoidable and that\u2019s my point \u2013 it cannot happen. When you concede three goals in a top game you can\u2019t win.\u201d"

                    "body": "Sarina Wiegman\u2019s Lionesses concluded their World Cup qualifying campaign atop Group D with 10 wins in 10 games, having scored 80 goals and conceded none, after this 10-0 demolition of Luxembourg.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it could be much better than this, so I\u2019m really happy,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter the Euros it always seems to be a hard one but I think the team has done a tremendous job coming out of the summer.\u201d\nTwo goals each from Georgia Stanway and substitute Beth England alongside goals from Alessia Russo, Rachel Daly, Beth Mead, Ella Toone, Nikita Parris and Lauren Hemp sealed the emphatic win at Stoke City\u2019s Bet365 stadium.\nIt was not quite the homecoming the FA would have wanted for the team\u2019s first home game since winning Euro 2022. At kick-off the stands were sparsely occupied as supporters decried a \u201cpark and ride trip from hell\u201d with heavy traffic, insufficient park and ride buses and breakdowns, leaving huge numbers of fans stranded and the ground taking an age to reach the eventual attendance of 24,174.\n\nAs a result, the atmosphere was somewhat muted, with those that had made it through the turnstiles doing their best to give the retired Jill Scott, who brought out the European Championship trophy ahead of the teams, and Wiegman, who was presented with her Uefa Coach of the Year award, a welcome worthy of their achievements.\nAny expectation that Wiegman would field a vastly different starting XI after qualification for the World Cup was secured against Austria on Saturday night was misplaced. The manager has been clear that she does not want to kill the momentum of a team unbeaten during her tenure and that was coupled with a desire to put on a show.\n\n\u201cYou think about performing, about how the players come in and what\u2019s next,\u201d said Wiegman. \u201cPeople come to the stadium to see the England team they see a lot, so we balance all these things.\u201d There was room for three changes to the XI that faced Austria, with Ellie Roebuck starting in goal ahead of Wiegman\u2019s first-choice, Mary Earps, Alex Greenwood replacing Millie Bright alongside Leah Williamson at the back, and Parris in place of Hemp.\nIt took 11 minutes for England to break the deadlock, but the goal should have come sooner. Luxembourg are a young team in international football, having been founded in 2003 before playing a first game three years later, and the starting XI included three 18-year-olds and two 16-year-olds.\n\nBy the close, a host of England\u2019s fringe players had made their mark, rewarded for the part they played from the sidelines at the Euros as Wiegman and her staff stuck to their tried and tested formula. \u201cThat\u2019s also really nice to do. They gave so much to the team but it does start with performance,\u201d said Wiegman. \u201cWhen you play a game that\u2019s 0-0 and you think we have to do this to win this game, you make choices. When we knew we would win the game we wanted to try some things out and some players. A lot of these players were involved in the Euros and were committed. Winning the Euros was done by 23 players and also by the prep camps 28.\u201d\nUp next for the European champions is a Wembley meeting with the World Cup holders, USA, and the Czech Republic at the Amex stadium in October, as Wiegman turns her attention to the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand next summer.\n\u201cIt will be a very exciting and loud night,\u201d said Wiegman of the USA game. \u201cWe are really looking forward to it being sold out again and that we will play the No 1 in the rankings to see where we are at. I think we\u2019re in a good place. Those are the tests you want all the time.\u201d"

                    "body": "\u201cAs a Welshman living in Mali, I\u2019m struck by the contrast in the number of teams based in the capital city playing in the top league,\u201d mails Se\u00e1n Smith. \u201cWhereas the Cymru Premier has for much of its history not included a club based in the capital city (and currently only has one team based in Cardiff out of 12), 13 of the 18 teams in Mali\u2019s Premi\u00e8re Division are based in Bamako. Are there any other national top divisions that have a higher or lower proportion of clubs based in the capital?\u201d In England it has often been said that the Premier League, or the old Division One, is harder for London teams to win because of the number of derbies. This season, seven of the 20 Premier League sides are based in London. That means 12 London derbies apiece for Arsenal, Brentford, Chelsea, Crystal Palace, Fulham, Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham United. As for answering the actual question, rather than bringing everything back to the Premier League, let\u2019s start with the countries where few, if any, top-flight teams come from the capital. \u201cBSC Young Boys based in Bern are the only capital city club in the 10-team Swiss Super League,\u201d writes Opeyemi Ajala. \u201cBras\u00edlia, federal capital of Brazil, has no football club in the Serie A (20 teams).\u201d  Brazil isn\u2019t the only gigantic country without a team from the capital in their top division. \u201cIn Major League Soccer (MLS), three of the 28 teams are Canadian \u2013 Toronto FC, CF Montreal and Vancouver Whitecaps\u201d notes Thomas Wendt. \u201cHowever, there is no team based in the capital Ottawa and, likely, never will be.\u201d  \u201cAustralia is an example of a country with zero teams from their capital city,\u201d adds Richard Mace. \u201cThere is no A-League men\u2019s team from Canberra (although Canberra United do compete in the women\u2019s A-League). However, there is a team from the capital city of another country, as Wellington Phoenix from New Zealand compete in the A-League.\u201d At the other end of the scale are the hosts of the inaugural World Cup, and the upcoming one. \u201cThe Uruguayan Primera can currently match Mali for the number of sides from the capital Montevideo,\u201d writes Gareth Marshall. \u201cThere are 13: Pe\u00f1arol, Nacional, Defensor, Danubio, Fenix, Rentistas, River Plate, Torque, Cerrito, Albion, Wanderers, Boston River and, er, Liverpool. But as it\u2019s only a 16-team division it gives a slightly higher percentage of capital-based sides (81.2% as opposed to Bamoko\u2019s 72.2%).\u201d Joe Stynes also points out that, in the 1998 Primera season, all 12 sides were from Montevideo. \u201cThe current Qatar Stars League has 11 of 12 teams playing in greater Doha \u2013 al Wakrah and ar Rayann are technically separate municipalities, but it\u2019s all part of the same urban area,\u201d writes Chris Benedik. \u201cThe only team not based in and around Doha is al Shamal, on Qatar\u2019s north coast.\u201d Footnote: we answered a variation on this question in 2017, if you want even more trivia. International top scorers at clubs \u201cThe signing of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang means there are now 10 players who have played for Chelsea who are top scorers for their respective nation: Weah, Gudjohnsen, Mutu, Drogba, Shevchenko, Younghusband (Philippines), Falcao, Lukaku, Eto\u2019o and Aubameyang. Is this a record?\u201d asks Jesse Pajwani. \u201cNo, several clubs have had more,\u201d says Philip in Washington, cutting brusquely to the chase. \u201cBy my count, Barcelona (Aubameyang, Eto\u2019o, Hagi, Henry, Ibrahimovic, Lewandowski, Messi, Sanchez, Su\u00e1rez, Villa, Gudjohnsen, and Keita), Internazionale (Lukaku, Dzeko, Eto\u2019o, Keane, Ibrahimovic, Sukur, Mkhitaryan, Sanchez, Jovetic, Pandev, Mutu, and Kallon), and Monaco (Slimani, Berbatov, Falcao, Koller, Mbokani, Henry, Aubameyang, Gudjohnsen, Weah, Jovetic, Kallon, and Adebayor) have had 12 each. \u201cThe record is, I think, held by Manchester United, who have had 13. They are: Berbatov, Ronaldo, Rooney, Lukaku, Hern\u00e1ndez, Van Persie, Ibrahimovic, Mkhitaryan, Goater, S\u00e1nchez, Falcao, Healy, and Law. This was fun.\u201d Nickname derbies  \u201cIn 1931 Charlton adopted the nickname Robins,\u201d begins Clive Denny. \u201cSwindon Town and Bristol City were also nicknamed Robins. In the 1933-34 and 1934-35 seasons all three clubs were in the Third Division South. An early example of a \u2018Round Robin\u2019 competition? Charlton played Bristol City 12 times from 1931 until they changed their nickname to Valiants in 1960s, winning every match.\u201d Knowledge archive \u201cIn a pre-season friendly between Real Madrid and Milan I noticed that both clubs had the same sponsor. Has this ever happened before?\u201d asked Mark Pucci in 2015. \u201cThe starkest example I\u2019ve ever witnessed is in Argentina,\u201d wrote Mark Turner, \u201cwhere the indescribably bitter rivals River Plate and Boca Juniors had the same main sponsor in the 2012 seasons. That was the bank BBVA Banco Frances (the local wing of Spain\u2019s Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria), which has a strong presence in Argentina.\u201d \u201cSouth Africa\u2019s mobile phone market is dominated by two providers, MTN and Vodacom,\u201d added Ian Williams. \u201cDuring the 2008-09 season, MTN sponsored Ajax Cape Town and Golden Arrows, and Vodacom sponsored Bloemfontein Celtic, Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates.\u201d Cue a lot of same-sponsor derbies, then. Ian\u2019s email inspired a little digging of our own, which unearths the fact that the following season the final of South Africa\u2019s oldest cup competition, then as now known, because of its sponsor, as the MTN 8, was contested by Ajax Cape Town and Golden Arrows, both also sponsored by MTN. This sponsorship triple-whammy must surely be some kind of record. Can you help?  \u201cLiverpool beat Chelsea 2-1 in the WSL and all three goals were penalties,\u201d notes Paul Savage. \u201cWhat\u2019s the highest number of penalties scored in a game and the highest score where all goals have been penalties?\u201d  \u201cI know it\u2019s early doors, but just five points separate the play-off places and relegation in the Championship. What\u2019s been the smallest points gap in any league between promotion and relegation at the end of a season?\u201d asks Crispin Leyser.  \u201cValencia\u2019s late, great former kit man, Bernardo \u2018Espa\u00f1ata\u2019 Edo, will have a street in the Spanish city named after him,\u201d notes Niall McVeigh. \u201cAre they any other examples of streets, buildings or stadiums being named after club backroom staff?\u201d  Mail us your questions or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU."

People are in royal blue T-shirts, blue streamers hang from car windows, some houses have even been painted blue in the last week. Samoans are decked out in the colours of their Toa Samoa, the national men\u2019s rugby league team, the surprise stars of the Rugby League World Cup. Last week, Samoa stunned fans with a golden-point drop goal that gave them a 27-26 victory over highly ranked England to reach their maiden tournament final. With that goal, Samoa became the first nation outside Australia, New Zealand or Great Britain/England to qualify for the tournament final since 1968.  Samoans will be getting out of bed before dawn on Sunday to watch their team make history, as they contest the final against Australia at Old Trafford in Manchester. The game is scheduled for 4pm Saturday afternoon, UK time, 5am Sunday morning Samoa time. The excitement in Samoa and among Samoans around the world is palpable. There are reports of shops in New Zealand selling out of Samoan flags, while car parades supporting the team have been held all weekend in neighbouring American Samoa. Local radio announcer Fritz Arp of Siusega said he\u2019s never seen anything like the mood in the Samoa. \u201cThis is a whole new different level, where there are car parades, in town and rural areas; schools holding daily assemblies and students conducting the Siva Tau, I mean its overwhelming the support showcased by our people for our Toa Samoa. \u201cEven when I am on air, people are calling in making dedications to the Toa players \u2026 it\u2019s unheard of the support by our people.\u201d  Several shops visited by the Guardian on the island country had run out of Samoan flags. Hollywood actor Dwayne Johnson, who is half Samoan, filmed a message of support for the team. \u201cI am delivering the message with boundless love and boundless reverence and respect and boundless pride for my boys, my Usos, the Toa Samoa,\u201d he said in a video to his 348 million Instagram followers. \u201cThis is a big deal, they are making history in the world of sports, in the world of rugby. This is the first time that our country, our culture has ever gone to the final for any sport. I could not be more proud of them, we could not be more proud of them.\u201d On Friday, an event was held in front of the government\u2019s executive building, with members of the public gathering to perform the largest ever Siva Tau, a Samoan war dance.  The president of Rugby League Samoa, Tagaloa Faafouina Su\u2019a, said the Siva Tau would be filmed and sent to the team, to \u201cshow our boys and the world how proud we are of them\u201d. \u201cToa\u2019s success is not only the team players\u2019 hard work but most importantly the backing they have received from their homeland Samoa, that they are representing, and thousands of Samoans across the globe.\u201d Seleni \u201cCash\u201d Alofaifo, a local singer and disc jockey, who recorded a song celebrating the team released the day that Samoa defeated England in the semi-finals, commended Toa for putting Samoa back on the world map.  \u201cI\u2019m sure after last week\u2019s monumental game, people will be Googling Samoa. A proud moment,\u201d he said. \u201cThe result of the Rugby League World Cup is not important but the fact is that we made to the finals speaks volumes. \u201cToa won against the commentators, against the ref and one of the best teams in rugby league, but we have bigger fish to fry tomorrow.\u201d Jonah Tuiletufuga from Apia said he could not wait for Toa to take field against Australia. \u201cI will not pre-empt the results, but the Toa knows that all the Samoans are rallied behind them, and so they shouldn\u2019t let us down. I\u2019m in my 40s and have never seen anything like this before in my town let alone my village, the spirit of unity is quite unique. What time to be alive,\u201d he said. The deputy police commissioner has issued a statement saying that while police were \u201cprepared to allow supporters to show their patriotism support for our Toa Samoa\u201d they would be \u201cout in force\u201d on Sunday to enforce the law and ensure people were kept safe."

                    "body": "Good morning. Too many people and not enough properties has meant that, for years, those living in urban centres have forked out extortionate amounts on rent. This New York Times piece from 2006 highlights the brutal obstacle course endured by would-be tenants who were in some cases expected to earn $80,000-$90,000 to rent a $2,000-a-month studio apartment. Eight years later, the Guardian ran a piece highlighting the growing gulf between London and the rest of the country (at that point, average London rent was \u00a31,516 a month.) Those examples now seem quaint; according to Rightmove the average rent across all property types in London was \u00a32,343 a month between July and September this year, with prospective tenants now going through a rigmarole of endless, pressurised viewings, interviews and background checks. Finding a home now brings together the worst parts of dating and applying for a job. Except that at the end of it you don\u2019t get a bump in salary or the love of your life, but instead strangers for room mates and, potentially, a mould problem, all for a third to half of your paycheque.  Robert Booth wrote a brilliant, humanising piece on the people at the sharp end of this crisis, speaking to three tenants who are facing evictions after their landlords unexpectedly raised rent. But the UK is not alone in facing this issue. From Asia to the US, today\u2019s newsletter looks at the global rental crisis, and the measures being taken to combat it. Five big stories  Politics | Labour has easily held the City of Chester in a byelection, winning by a majority of 10,974 in a brutal first electoral test for Rishi Sunak.

They have said Rishi Sunak\u2019s Conservatives no longer have a mandate to govern.\u201d China | Chinese authorities have ramped up censorship tactics over zero-Covid protests that have been taking place across the country. Leaked directives show that the government has initiated the highest \u201cemergency\u201d response level, including tracking and questioning protesters and cracking down on VPNs and other methods of bypassing online censorship. Education | Department for Education figures show the number of graduates in teacher training is at \u201ccatastrophic\u201d levels. Around 29,000 graduates have signed up, a 20% drop on last year \u2013 and the government is missing its own recruitment targets by more than 80% in key subjects.

The teaser dropped as Buckingham Palace grapples with the aftermath of a racism incident.  In depth: Four cities that tell the story of a broken housing market  Nearly a third of private renters have experienced rent hikes in the last three months in the UK, according to the charity Shelter. (Robert Booth and Michael Goodier\u2019s exclusive on rent increases analyses, in sobering detail, just how bad things have become across the country). Combined with increasing energy bills and rising inflation, radical action is needed to make sure people do not end up without basic necessities like housing. Below are four global cities grappling with how to deal with their own rental crises. *** London The cost of renting a property is increasing extraordinarily quickly in the UK capital; according to data from estate agent Savills, in the first nine months of this year rent price hikes broke records, increasing by 13.7%. While this is partly down to overseas students and young people returning to the city in high numbers, the central issue remains that there are not enough housing units and there have not been for a long time. After the pandemic downturn in 2020, an increase in property prices, and rising capital gains tax, many landlords decided to sell their buy-to-let properties and cash in. This, paired with the fact that the Tories have failed in fulfilling their manifesto pledge to build 300,000 new homes a year, has led to a massive property shortage. And that means bidding wars, huge deposits and properties being snatched up before they are even listed on websites. This problem has been decades in the making \u2013 social housing has been dwindling meaning that most people who rent are relying on private landlords. While prices have cooled slightly since the unprecedented levels witnessed over the summer, Savills has predicted that the average London rent will jump another 5.5% next year. The housing and homelessness minister has said that no-fault evictions would be banned under the new renters reform bill \u2013 but that might not come into effect until late 2024. But as campaign groups sound the alarm that this rental crisis could lead to a homelessness crisis, it is clear that time is of the essence. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has said that he wants to freeze rents for two years and for his office to have devolved long-term rent control powers. *** New York The global rental squeeze is also apparent in New York, as of yesterday the most expensive city in the world. The median rental price has gone up by 20% in the last year, with evictions and homelessness on the rise. Videos of New Yorkers queueing around the block to view potential apartments went viral over the summer, and the story seems to be the same as that in the UK: too many people, not enough places. The population of New York City hit 8.8 million this year, a number that the Department of City Planning did not think it would hit until 2030. Over half a million flats need to be built in the next decade to accommodate for this growth. New York as a city has oscillated between protecting tenants\u2019 rights and curtailing them in favour of real estate investment. Over the course of several years, many regulations that were designed to stabilise and control rent were weakened, giving landlords avenues to increase rents as they saw fit. For instance, landlords were still limited to annual rent increases for renewing leases, but if the tenant left then the rent increases were under their discretion. Deregulation and a housing shortage has led to a perennially full city falling apart at the seams. *** Hong Kong Before New York, Hong Kong had the dubious honour of being the most costly city in which to live. While average salaries are quite high in the city, eye-watering rents, alongside a crackdown on human rights, have led to something of an exodus, with the city\u2019s population dropping from 7.41 million in mid-2021 to 7.29 million in mid-2022. House prices have soared by 165% in the last decade, and massive inequality has meant that locals applying for public housing are waiting for an average of 6.1 years. More than 200,000 people live in \u201csubdivided\u201d units, which amount to four by six feet spaces infamously labelled \u201ccoffin homes\u201d. The problem in Hong Kong is not necessarily a lack of housing altogether, but a lack of affordable housing. For those on low or middle incomes, buying a home is all but out of the question (one estimate showed that for someone on a median income it would take 23 years to be able to afford a median-priced apartment\u2013 and that\u2019s if they spend none of their salary). Hong Kong\u2019s leader, John Lee, has, somewhat limply, pledged to build 30,000 larger, cheaper transitional homes in the next five years and to cap the wait time for public housing to six years. Alone, these initiatives barely make a dent, but they have been announced alongside longstanding policies that aim to house two-and-a-half million people on undeveloped land. It\u2019s unclear how long these projects will take because of their massive environmental and legal implications. *** Berlin Germany\u2019s capital has been hailed as an ideal example of an affordable and secure rental market, as its dual approach of rent control and sufficient public housing has meant that rent has stayed relatively low over the decades when compared with other European cities. However, the city has not been entirely insulated from the global housing crisis, and while Berlin might not have been starting from the same point as London or Paris, increases in rent are outpacing salaries in the city. In the decade between 2009 and 2019 rents doubled, and they are still increasing. Berlin is also a city of renters \u2013 roughly 85% of the city\u2019s residents rent their homes, meaning that far more people are affected by this squeeze than elsewhere. It was perhaps this fact that led to a striking referendum last year, where 56.4% voted to transfer ownership of hundreds of thousands of properties from corporate landlords to the government for social housing. However, one year on, Berliners are still waiting for this to happen.

Nimo A few people in France would have woken up very confused yesterday morning, when they turned to the back pages and saw that Tunisia had beaten the champions in the World Cup.

                    "body": "The date for a key UN nature summit has finally been confirmed after more than two years of delays and amid fears momentum to halt biodiversity loss across the globe has been lost.\nAhead of the latest round of negotiations in Nairobi this week, the UN convention on biological diversity confirmed that the Cop15 biodiversity conference will now take place in Montreal, Canada, from 5 to 17 December, after it became clear China would not be able to host the event in Kunming due to the country\u2019s zero-Covid policy.\nIt comes after several pandemic-related delays to the meeting, which was meant to take place in October 2020, and amid intense frustration with Beijing, who are holding the presidency for a major UN environmental agreement for the first time.\nFears had been building over the prohibitive cost for smaller countries to participate in Cop15 if it were held in China, along with concerns over restrictions on civil society, Indigenous groups and the press.\n\nAt a meeting on Tuesday, officials signed off the plan to host Cop15 near the UN biodiversity headquarters in Quebec. China will maintain responsibility for hosting and organising the event, and will do so in coordination with the Canadian government.\nSteven Guilbeault, Canada\u2019s environment minister, said the country was proud to host the conference. \u201cThere is an urgent need for international partners to halt and reverse the alarming loss of biodiversity worldwide,\u201d he said.\nThe once-a-decade nature summit will come after Cop27 in Egypt but clash with the World Cup in Qatar, prompting fears of a lack of attention and attendance by senior politicians and ministers, which was a key part of Cop26 in Glasgow, Scotland. The final global biodiversity framework agreement is likely to be negotiated in the hours before the World Cup final on 18 December.\n\nAt a parliamentary committee on Monday, UK environment ministers Lord Goldsmith and George Eustice refused to confirm whether the prime minister would attend but said he was likely to play a part.\nIn a statement, China\u2019s environment minister Huang Runqiu said the country would like to emphasise its continued strong commitment to working with all parties and stakeholders to ensure the success of Cop15.\n\nNegotiations for the agreement are scheduled to restart this week in Nairobi, Kenya, with significant divisions over proposals to protect 30% of land and sea, money for protecting biodiversity and the use of the digital sequence information to produce cosmetics, drugs and other products.\nGovernments have never met a target to halt the destruction of nature and there are fears that this agreement will be a repeat of what has gone before, amid concerns of a standoff with the global north and south over resources to protect natural places.\nIn March, the end of talks in Geneva saw a dramatic intervention by Gabon on behalf of a group of developing countries calling for $100bn (\u00a380bn) of biodiversity finance on top of the $100bn of climate financing that has been causing divisions ahead of Cop27.\nDespite the clarity over the Cop15 date, Oscar Soria, campaign director of the activism site Avaaz, said that the talks had lost momentum and it was a lost opportunity to show leadership on the environment.\n\u201c2020 was supposed to be the super year for nature led by China; two years later Beijing\u2019s indecision seriously jeopardised a diplomatic process to halt biodiversity loss.\n\u201cNow, this super year of failure can only be averted by the leadership of the UN. We have just a few months, and lots of diplomatic work needs to be done. And while there\u2019s now clarity on when and where the next Cop will happen, a big question remains on China\u2019s ability to effectively hold the presidency towards an ambitious deal for nature,\u201d he said.\nLi Shuo, a policy adviser for Greenpeace China, said: \u201cGovernments have finally made a decision on where and when the Cop15 will be held. This should now focus everyone\u2019s minds on the quality of the deal. That means ambitious targets to ensure strong protection both on land and at sea and a robust implementation package.\n\u201cThe upcoming preparatory session in Nairobi should see countries advancing the draft deal. The remaining months to Cop15 should be used effectively to unlock contentious issues such as finance.\u201d\nFind more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"

The changes, set out by the body responsible for the UK code for advertising, will mean that past betting and gambling marketing that features stars and celebrities such as Cristiano Ronaldo, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, Michael Owen and Harry Redknapp, would not be allowed in the UK. The wide-ranging new rules also include a ban on showing specific teams\u2019 football kit and stadiums in ads, as well as using video game content and gameplay popular with under-18s. \u201cNo more top-flight footballers or other high-profile sportspeople promoting the latest odds,\u201d said Shahriar Coupal, the director of the Committee of Advertising Practice, which sets the rules enforced by the UK\u2019s advertising watchdog. \u201cNo more social media influencers, TV stars or other celebrities popular with children inviting us to bet on red. And, no more gambling ads featuring video game images or gameplay familiar to many children\u2019s lives.\u201d Under the current rules, an advert is banned only if it is likely to appeal more to an under-18 than to an adult. Under the new rules, an ad will be banned if it is \u201clikely to be of strong appeal to children or young persons, especially by reflecting or being associated with youth culture\u201d, regardless of how it may be viewed by adults. The new rules come into force from October, in the run-up to football\u2019s World Cup in Qatar the following month, a sporting event around which gambling and betting companies traditionally spend heavily on marketing to attract gamblers.  However, the Advertising Standards Authority, the body that enforces the UK ad code, does not have the power to regulate in the contentious area of team sponsors. \u201cThis might not seem immediately significant but its effect \u2013 particularly in a World Cup year \u2013 will be dramatic,\u201d Coupal said. \u201cBy ending these practices, our new rules invite a new era for gambling ads, more particular to the adult audience they can target and more befitting of the age-restricted product they\u2019re promoting.\u201d The new rules will ban the use of any celebrity, from sports stars to Love Island contestants, with a significant fanbase of under-18s, in betting and gambling ads. The rules apply to broadcast media, such as TV, radio and cinema ads, as well as non-broadcast such as online and in newspapers or on billboards and posters. The ASA said that children were still seeing on average 2.2 betting or gambling ads a week, although this is the lowest level in 12 years, with existing rules banning anyone under the age of 25 being used in an ad."

                    "body": "Mino Raiola, the agent of players including Paul Pogba and Erling Haaland, has died aged 54 after living with a serious illness since January. Dr Alberto Zangrillo, from San Raffaele hospital in Milan, told the news agency Ansa on Thursday that Raiola was \u201cfighting to survive\u201d. He spoke after multiple reports that Raiola had died, which prompted a post from his official Twitter account to state that he was still alive. However, on Saturday afternoon, a family statement on the account confirmed Raiola\u2019s death, although no timeline or cause of death was given. \u201cIn infinite sorrow we share the passing of the most caring and amazing football agent there ever was,\u201d it read. \u201cMino fought until the end with the same strength he put on negotiation tables to defend our players. As usual, Mino made us proud and never realised it. \u201cMino touched so many lives through his work and wrote a new chapter in the history of modern football. His presence will forever be missed. Mino\u2019s mission of making football a better place for players will continue with the same passion.\u201d The Italy-born Dutch national was one of football\u2019s most powerful and high-earning agents after almost three decades in the job. His other clients have included Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Gianluigi Donnarumma, Matthijs de Ligt and Mario Balotelli.  Pogba and Haaland are expected to make two of this summer\u2019s most significant transfers, with Pogba available on a free when his contract at Manchester United ends and Haaland poised to leave Borussia Dortmund. Manchester City intend to sign the Norway striker. Raiola, who spoke Italian, Dutch, English, French, German, Spanish and Portuguese, was born in Italy but moved to the Dutch city of Haarlem with his family as a baby and worked there in the family pizzeria as a boy.  Raiola later looked after the restaurant\u2019s books, studied law and became a director at the local football club. He wanted to be a football agent, though, and his break came when he was asked by Rob Jansen, one of the leading agents in the Netherlands, to help as an interpreter on Dennis Bergkamp\u2019s transfer from Ajax to Internazionale in 1993. Raiola was given a job at Jansen\u2019s company but walked out to set up on his own. He oversaw Pogba\u2019s then world-record \u00a393.2m transfer to United from Juventus in 2016. His outspoken nature was exemplified in 2020 when he criticised United\u2019s then manager, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, for his treatment of Pogba. Raiola said he regarded Pogba not as a client but as family. Raiola earlier fell out with Sir Alex Ferguson and said in an interview for one of Ibrahimovic\u2019s autobiographies that he found a kindred spirit in the Swede: \u201cI realised straight away that he was an arrogant bastard \u2013 in other words, just like me.\u201d Raiola was fiercely critical of Fifa proposals to cap the money agents could make from transfers."

                    "body": "Almost 11 months have passed since Darijo Srna left Kyiv, not knowing when or if he would return. \u201cRussia has not stopped,\u201d he says. \u201cLook what they did in Dnipro a few days ago: 40 people dead. The only thing that has changed is that we are even stronger and more united, working and waiting for a great victory. The whole world will find a way to end this.\u201d The Croat is sitting in the west London cafe where, days after completing his evacuation, he met the Guardian last March. Right up to the clear, cold blue sky outside, the scene is almost identical. But no two days have been the same for Shakhtar Donetsk\u2019s director of football over the intervening period. He has had to react to his squad\u2019s decimation after the Ukrainian top flight shut down; there was the long, difficult but ultimately successful struggle to resurrect the domestic game in August; most recently he helped broker the sale of Shakhtar\u2019s prize asset, Mykhaylo Mudryk, to Chelsea in a deal worth up to \u00a388m. \u201cIf there was no war, the price would have been much higher,\u201d he says. \u201cMisha has shown the whole world that he is one of the best players in that position. Look at what he did: we lost 14 players and there, at 21 years old, he stepped up to take a huge responsibility and be one of Shakhtar\u2019s leaders during Russia\u2019s aggression. He had an amazing chance and he took it.\u201d It was, Srna admits, an emotional moment when Mudryk walked on to the Stamford Bridge pitch, draped in a Ukrainian flag, after completing his move on Sunday. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you and you should be proud of yourself,\u201d he told a youngster who had, during his earlier years at Shakhtar, been underused at first-team level to the considerable chagrin of those upstairs. Srna was not involved in discussions with Arsenal, who had appeared firmly in pole position for Mudryk\u2019s signature, but was among the delegation dealing directly with Chelsea. The Todd Boehly regime was, he explains, clean and unproblematic in completing a move that raised eyebrows.  \u201cIt was a straightforward process that began a month or two ago and I can only say they were correct from the first day,\u201d he says. \u201cThey didn\u2019t call the player without our permission, everything was respectful. They showed how much they wanted him, arrived at our training camp in Antalya on Saturday to finish the deal, and it was a pleasure to work with them. \u201cI can\u2019t speak about Arsenal. I had one friendly coffee with Oleksandr Zinchenko and we talked about Mudryk, but in the end it\u2019s simple: they had to pay what our club president wanted. The rest of us were just here to help negotiations and make everyone happy. Chelsea will see that they\u2019ve got an amazing person and player.\u201d Ultimately it was just business but not everybody took it that way. Srna explains he received abusive messages, amounting to death threats, from some Arsenal supporters on social media after the deal was completed. The politer ones accused him of sabotaging Mudryk\u2019s future by facilitating the move to Chelsea. Shakhtar, though, were perfectly entitled to do the best possible deal. They received their windfall and, perhaps, thanked their lucky stars that Mudryk is Ukrainian. One of the reasons Srna wants to speak now is that he is furious with Fifa and what he sees as its neglect of Ukraine\u2019s football clubs. Last Friday the court of arbitration for sport (Cas) dismissed Shakhtar\u2019s appeal against Fifa\u2019s emergency transfer rules, extended last June, that let foreign players and coaches suspend their contracts until the end of June 2023, allowing them to accept loan moves to other countries and essentially running down their transfer values. Their claim for about \u20ac50m of damages from the governing body, centred around what Shakhtar say were lost transfer fees for four players in particular, was also rejected. \u201cThe whole world is helping Ukraine but Fifa doesn\u2019t help its football,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s their duty and they do nothing.\u201d Shakhtar have long honed a strategy of signing players from abroad and later doing brisk, often hard-nosed, trade with Europe\u2019s biggest clubs; they had been relying on that to continue during a war that savaged their income streams and left them playing behind closed doors. \u201cWhat Fifa have done to us is not right. They will destroy us. We\u2019re not asking for money that isn\u2019t ours: we want to protect a club that has played 17 times in the Champions League group stage. And it doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s us or another club, it\u2019s the entire country. We want them to protect the Ukrainian league and instead we feel as if we\u2019re fighting not only against Russia, but against Fifa too.\u201d  Although Srna is reluctant to give examples, the situation involving Manor Solomon, who would have joined Fulham for a transfer fee last summer until the Premier League club understood they were entitled to take the player on loan, is understood to be a case in point. Some clubs, although not all, took advantage of Shakhtar but he is reluctant to blame them. \u201cIn the end, Fifa created the conditions for it to happen,\u201d he says. A perceived lack of engagement rankles deeply, particularly in comparison with the hands-on approach taken by the Uefa president, Aleksander Ceferin, last year when the foreign nationals among Shakhtar\u2019s players and staff needed to escape Ukraine. There is a sense Fifa is more distant, less accountable. \u201cThey are behaving as if they don\u2019t care and what can we do? We are small to them,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve restarted our league all by ourselves. We\u2019ve only lost two top-division clubs so far: Mariupol and Desna. Everyone else managed to stay alive. Can you imagine that Fifa is watching all this happening, while people are dying and footballers are playing under bombs and sirens, and doing nothing? \u201cWe all watched the World Cup: on the one hand you\u2019re seeing people smiling in Qatar, a well-organised tournament, a great level of football; from the other side we saw them not allow President Zelenskiy to give a message before the final about what\u2019s happening. I invite them, with all my heart, to visit Ukraine for a few days. I want to show them everything, to help them feel it a little bit. After that, maybe they\u2019ll understand that what we have is worth protecting.\u201d Asked by the Guardian, Fifa did not offer any comment about the Cas ruling or its context. It has said in the past that \u201ckey football stakeholders\u201d were consulted, including the European Club Association, regarding rules surrounding contract suspensions. In the meantime Srna and Shakhtar are trying to do their bit. Srna is immensely proud that Rinat Akhmetov, the club president, announced a \u00a320.5m donation to the Ukrainian war effort a few hours before our conversation. Where he hears words from Fifa he sees actions from Akhmetov, whose donation will help fund the Heart of Azovstal project. \u201cRemember we lost our home, in Donetsk, in 2014,\u201d he says. \u201cThe president has lost a lot of money but he\u2019s been there from the first day, investing money in football but also helping the people. We need examples like him, people who will help Ukraine. Even on Sunday, when he called and I put him on the phone to Misha, the air raid siren was going off as they spoke. That is the reality everyone faces.\u201d For Srna\u2019s part the collaboration with his former club Hajduk Split, who accepted more than 80 of Shakhtar\u2019s academy players and staff last March, continues. The Croatian club are still hosting the Ukrainian youth prospects and there is more: by a delightful twist of fate, Shakhtar will travel to Hajduk in early February for a Uefa Youth League last-16 playoff tie. \u201cA special game for us,\u201d he says. \u201cAll our academy is there and now we\u2019ll face them. It\u2019s destiny.\u201d  Shakhtar\u2019s immediate prospects are uncertain. Losing Mudryk was a blow to their hopes of winning a 14th title since the turn of the century: they sit five points behind Dnipro-1 at the Premier League\u2019s midway stage with a game in hand, although second place would at least mean they retain a chance of Champions League football next term. With a revamped lineup, forced to promote young prospects early, it counts as an achievement. \u201cIt\u2019s been very difficult to play again and I\u2019m so proud of everyone,\u201d he says. \u201cThe sirens, the threat of bombing, sometimes going into shelters during games, it\u2019s not been nice. They showed how much they love Ukraine and Shakhtar.\u201d A new Mudryk would help. Shakhtar will look within Ukraine and a favoured hunting ground, Brazil, for a replacement during the mid-season break but it will probably be a younger player who needs time. Srna says there are three or four \u201cfuture Mishas\u201d in their team: the 20-year-old midfielder Heorhiy Sudakov is known to have admirers. \u201cThey will grow up faster than normal. I know their talent and soon we\u2019ll know their strength.\u201d Srna has seen the fortitude of both Shakhtar and Ukraine. He repeats the message of last year, in this same spot, even if this time it comes in spite of the global game\u2019s leaders. \u201cWe will survive,\u201d he says. \u201cFor Ukraine, our people and our fans. We will survive.\u201d"

                    "body": "Good morning. Hearing the reaction of British politicians to a report at the weekend that Rishi Sunak\u2019s government might consider a \u201cSwiss-style\u201d trading arrangement with the EU, you might imagine that the only factor was whether or not the UK \u2013 and in particular the Tory party \u2013 is ready for it. \u201cUnder my leadership, the United Kingdom will not pursue any relationship with Europe that relies on alignment with EU law,\u201d Sunak told the CBI yesterday. But as the story rumbles on with claims that chancellor Jeremy Hunt disagrees, there\u2019s a factor besides the preferences of the Conservatives that appears to have been forgotten: what the EU wants. And while there are many in the UK who now yearn for closer ties, it\u2019s far from clear that their counterparts on the continent feel the same way. For today\u2019s newsletter, I spoke to the Guardian\u2019s Brussels correspondent, Jennifer Rankin, about how European leaders view the prospect of a new deal, Swiss-style or otherwise \u2013 and what else might explain why this story has blown up. Here are the headlines. Scroll down for a World Cup roundup \u2013 and this is too ridiculous to put in headlines, but I did think you might like to start the day with this story about a truly massive goldfish. Five big stories  Conservatives | Dominic Raab behaved so badly in a meeting with the Home Office during his first stint as justice secretary that his department\u2019s top official had to personally apologise to counterparts afterwards, the Guardian has been told. Indonesia | Indonesian rescue workers were racing to reach people still trapped in rubble one day after an earthquake struck the main island of Java, killing at least 162 people, many of them children, and injuring hundreds more. Human rights | Lawyers acting on behalf of Shamima Begum, the 23-year-old who left Britain as a schoolgirl to join Islamic State in Syria, said she was likely to have been a victim of trafficking and sexual exploitation during a new appeal against the removal of her British citizenship. Labour | Keir Starmer will say on Tuesday that UK businesses must wean themselves off \u201ccheap labour\u201d and that a low-pay model for growth is no longer working. In a speech to the CBI, Starmer will stop short of pledging that overall migration should come down \u2013 a promise that Rishi Sunak renewed last week. Space | Nasa\u2019s Orion capsule reached the moon and is on its way to a record breaking lunar orbit. The $4.1bn test flight is the first capsule to visit the moon since Nasa\u2019s Apollo programme 50 years ago.  In depth: \u2018The EU sees its political unity as a greater prize than economic interests\u2019  There\u2019s a certain audible weariness in the voice of Jennifer Rankin, veteran of many years of Brexit coverage, when I ask her what European leaders would make of a Sunday Times story (\u00a3) that suggested a Swiss-style agreement \u2013 explained usefully here by Aubrey Allegretti, and featuring selective access to the single market, EU budget contributions, and the removal of most border checks for goods \u2013 might be on the cards again. \u201cIt is amazing that we can keep going round in circles having these arguments,\u201d she said. \u201cThere will always be a view that the UK can have this special status, even though it\u2019s been denied so many times.\u201d While the latest story looks well sourced, it is a long way from a firm signal of intent, as the subsequent on-the-record denials suggest. \u201cYou don\u2019t get much reaction from Brussels or national governments to stories like this,\u201d Jennifer said. \u201cThey know it\u2019s a test balloon for domestic consumption.\u201d *** Why a Swiss-style deal isn\u2019t attractive Still, for the sake of argument, let\u2019s imagine that the UK were to actively seek such a deal in the short-term. The first problem is: the EU doesn\u2019t like the arrangement it has with Switzerland. \u201cIt\u2019s been trying unsuccessfully to improve it for about eight years,\u201d Jennifer said. \u201cThey want to turn this sprawling set of mini-deals into one deal, and all the way through Brexit they\u2019ve said that this is not a precedent for the UK.\u201d One important caveat to the Sunday Times story is that the UK wouldn\u2019t want the free movement of people to be part of it \u2013 but Switzerland has that. \u201cThe EU has said so many times that it won\u2019t separate free movement of people from goods, capital and labour,\u201d Jennifer said. \u201cI can\u2019t see them moving on that principle.\u201d The reasons are about more than the straightforward advantages and disadvantages of such a deal with the UK in isolation. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to set a precedent,\u201d Jennifer said. \u201cThere\u2019s a view that if you give non-EU countries benefits that aren\u2019t available to member states, what\u2019s the point of being a member state? Why would you allow the UK an opt-out you won\u2019t give France?\u201d *** Why a Swiss-style deal isn\u2019t a priority Even if you set aside such concerns, there\u2019s another reason this is unlikely to make progress in the next few years: \u201cIt feels like an eighth or ninth priority in Brussels now,\u201d Jennifer said. \u201cThere are so many other burning issues\u201d \u2013 above all, the war in Ukraine and the ensuing energy crisis across the continent \u2013 \u201cthat it\u2019s very hard to find the political space for EU leaders to sit down and think through the relationship they want with the UK. And there\u2019s exhaustion with the subject. There\u2019s just not the appetite.\u201d As far as Brexit goes, the big subject at the moment is trade arrangements in Northern Ireland \u2013 \u201cand we\u2019re still a long way from agreement on that. There is cooperation on Russia, and there may be talks about the UK\u2019s access to the Horizon scientific research programme. Beyond that, the answer is no.\u201d *** Room for improvements There is, at least, some optimism within the EU that relations are improving \u2013 but that hope is mostly confined to the Northern Ireland protocol for now. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard, especially from the Irish taoiseach, some positive noises. But there is also a lot of caution [because] EU leaders have seen a lot of British prime ministers come and go, and just when you\u2019ve got the measure of one, another comes along. \u201cThey don\u2019t know what to make of Sunak yet. They don\u2019t think he\u2019s made a decision about what kind of compromises he\u2019s willing to offer on Northern Ireland.\u201d If a deal on Northern Ireland can be struck before the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday agreement in April, next year \u2013 as Sunak promised Joe Biden last week \u2013 that could open the door to better relations on other subjects. \u201cI would say that there\u2019s uncertainty but hopefulness that he is not interested in starting a vicious trade war.\u201d  *** What the story\u2019s really about To officials in Brussels, talk of a Swiss-style deal, particularly when followed by such vociferous denials, appears to follow a familiar pattern, Jennifer said: \u201cThe government sending out messages for domestic consumption, either to keep the European Research Group [the most dogmatically pro-Brexit Conservative MPs] onside, or to try out some new idea without any relationship to the status of talks with the EU at the time.\u201d Given how unlikely movement on the subject will be in the near future, there\u2019s another possibility: the government wants to soften up the ERG for movement on Northern Ireland by dangling the prospect of a change to the relationship that Brexiters would find far more unpalatable. And while there will always be some hardliners who resist, the government may calculate that it can peel off enough members of the group \u2013 whose former chair Steve Baker is now a Northern Ireland minister, and recently apologised to Ireland and the EU for some of his behaviour during the Brexit process \u2013 to render any opposition impotent. *** What could happen in future It sounds, then, as if any movement towards a Swiss-style deal during this parliament is a dead duck. But, Jennifer suggested, there may be a longer-term appetite for closer ties in Brussels as well as London. \u201cMy opinion is that if you had a government with a different agenda, the EU could go in a different direction,\u201d she said. \u201cAlthough the EU are very anti a Swiss-style deal, I do wonder if you could build bilateral deals over five or 10 years: start with a customs union, build on that with free movement for musicians and artists, sketch out a whole series of little agreements.\u201d \u201cAt the moment, if you talk to EU officials, they emphatically say they don\u2019t want those kinds of mini-deals \u2013 which is what the Swiss deal consists of,\u201d she added. \u201cBut if you had a reset of relations, that might ultimately be able to change.\u201d What else we\u2019ve been reading  In May last year, Tamara Dean got hit by an SUV in Minneapolis.

In 2006 Atoe created Shotgun Seamstress, a DIY fanzine designed to create a space for Black punk fans to participate in and enjoy punk. The zine is lovingly hand-crafted, with cut-and-spliced images and scribbled text that was designed to inspire her peers. (The eight issues of Shotgun Seamstress are now being compiled into an anthology.) While Atoe has not published a new zine since 2015, her project is still reaching young Black punks who are trying to find a community like the one she helped to foster more than 15 years ago.

                    "body": "A breakthrough looked possible in the deadlocked global climate talks on Friday as the European Union made a dramatic intervention to agree to key developing world demands on financial help for poor countries.\nIn the early hours of Friday at the Cop27 UN climate summit in Egypt, the European Commission vice-president, Frans Timmermans, launched a proposal on behalf of the EU that would see it agree to establishing a loss and damage fund.\nRich countries had been holding out against this key demand, arguing it would take time to establish whether such a fund was needed, and how it would operate.\n\nTimmermans said on Friday morning the EU had listened to the G77 group of developing countries, for whom the establishment of a fund at this summit is a core demand.\nLoss and damage refers to the ravages of extreme weather on the physical and social infrastructure of poor countries, and the finance needed for rescue and reconstruction after climate-related disasters.\n\nTimmermans said: \u201cWe were reluctant about a fund, it was not our idea to have a fund. My reluctance was because I know from experience it takes time before a fund can be established, and more time before it is filled, whereas we have existing instruments. I really believe we could move faster with existing instruments [for climate finance]. But since they [the G77] are so attached to a fund, we have agreed.\u201d\nTimmermans added that \u201cclear conditions\u201d would be attached to any fund. It would be geared towards supporting the most vulnerable, with a broad financial donor base contributing.\nThe fund would not operate in isolation, but as part of a mosaic of solutions that includes reform of multilateral development banks, for example.\nIn parallel, the EU wants more ambition on cutting emissions, with stronger provisions on updated national plans for emissions cuts in line with the 1.5-degree target in the Paris Agreement and peaking global emissions by 2025. \u201cThis would have to be a package deal,\u201d Timmermans said.\nDeveloping countries are considering the proposal. Carla Barnett, the secretary general of the Caribbean Community, gave an ambivalent response: \u201cThere\u2019s only one option for small island developing states, a financing fund that delivers a just pathway for the future of our countries. Division and delay tactics will not work. This is a matter we defend on the basis of justice.\u201d\nOne G77 negotiator, who asked not to be named, was not impressed by the EU\u2019s proposal. \u201cIt is a predictable attempt by the EU to break up the G77 in talks. Of course, it\u2019s not a breakthrough. They are merely repeating its original negotiating position by making it sound like a compromise when they know very well that it is not. It is completely disingenuous.\u201d\nBut some welcomed the proposal. Mary Robinson, Chair of The Elders and former president of Ireland said: \u201cThis proposal from the ministerial co-leads Jennifer Morgan and Maisa Rojas on loss and damage finance puts us on the cusp of a historic breakthrough. We\u2019ve gone from not even having loss and damage finance on the agenda at COP27 to having a fund, a mechanism, and a flow of finance all within our grasp. \n\u201cIf adopted, this could well ignite bold reform of the wider international financial system so multilateral development banks (MDBs) open their coffers for those in need of loss and damage financing. If this text is agreed at COP27 it not only delivers a UNFCCC answer to loss and damage finance, it could initiate the restructuring of international financial architecture to meet today\u2019s global challenges.\u201d \nAustralia said it welcomed the EU\u2019s contribution and would \u201cengage constructively with it\u201d. On loss and damage, it was \u201cvery attracted to a new fund that benefits from a broad contributor base and focuses on the most vulnerable\u201d.\n\u201cWe want to fully examine how other institutions such as multinational development banks can interact and further develop their interaction with this fund,\u201d said Chris Bowen, the Australian climate change minister.\nThere was concern that more clarity would be needed. Yamide Dagnet, director for climate justice at the Open Society Foundations, said: \u201cI expect Friday\u2019s discussion to turn around the issue of defining vulnerability. Both the EU and the pair of ministers\u2019 proposals on the table refer to the \u201cmost vulnerable countries\u201d a those who should benefit from this fund \u2013 begging the question, who is included and who is excluded into this framing, which has never been clearly defined in UN terms and could limit the benefits of the fund.\u201d \nThe EU\u2019s move throws the spotlight on the US, which has also objected to a fund and has not yet responded to the proposal.\n\u201cThe EU proposal crucially establishes the principal that payments to developing countries for climate adaptation must be matched by overall global reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, which after all is the central goal of the Paris agreement,\u201d said Paul Bledsoe, a former Clinton White House climate adviser, now with the Progressive Policy Insitute in Washington.\n\u201cBut labels matter. Such payments to other nations must always be described as general foreign aid, never climate compensation or reparations, in order to gain US support. With that proviso, they stand a decent chance of gaining support from the Biden administration.\u201d\nThe EU\u2019s decision places much greater pressure on China, which has up to now avoided any obligation to provide climate finance to the poorest countries, despite being the world\u2019s biggest emitter and second-biggest cumulative emitter, and the world\u2019s second-biggest economy.\nUnder the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, under which the conference of the parties takes place, countries are strictly delineated into developed and developing, and China is still classed as developing under the treaty.\n\nTimmermans said: \u201c[The fund] donor base should be under the Paris agreement and take account of the economic situations of countries in 2022 not 1992, as in the G77 proposal.\u201d\nCanada\u2019s environment minister Steven Guilbeault said his country is supportive of the EU\u2019s proposal, but countries like China, Saudi Arabia and Qatar should contribute to the fund given their historical emissions and wealth.\nHe told the Guardian: \u201cWe need to have a serious conversation about expanding the donor base. We recognise our responsibility but we are less and less large emitters compared to others. It\u2019s in the interest of vulnerable countries to have more donors... China should definitely be there. I think there are a number of oil producing nations in the Gulf region that should be part of that. I haven\u2019t looked at the UAE\u2019s figures but Qatar and Saudi Arabia, yes.\u201d\nPreety Bhandari, from the World Resources Institute, said countries had three options on loss and damage. Two involved agreeing to establish a fund, either immediately or next year in Dubai. The third \u2013 the preference of the US \u2013 would not mention a fund, but agree to work on funding arrangements in and outside the UN, a reference to the need to reshape the World Bank and other international agencies to better deal with the climate crisis.\n\u201cIt all boils down to political will,\u201d Bhandari said. \u201cThis is the time for concessions and compromises. Let\u2019s hope that common ground is found.\u201d "

                    "body": "A little more than 40 years on and Gareth Southgate can still freeze-frame the moment. So can every England fan of his generation. The long throw had been flicked on and there was Bryan Robson, his hero, everybody\u2019s hero, getting his body side-on, allowing the ball to run across him before volleying it down and in.\nThere were 27 seconds on the clock and England were 1-0 up against France. Robson would score again in the second half, a majestic leap and thumping header for 2-1 and England pulled clear to win 3-1. Their 1982 World Cup campaign was up and running.\nLike countless kids in England, Southgate modelled himself on Robson. He had the same boots; he wore his shirt out at the front, tucked in at the back; he played in midfield. He even tried to run like him. Southgate ran that day, back from school to catch the France game, getting there just in time for Robson\u2019s iconic opener.\n\nSouthgate grew up as a fan of Manchester United, where Robson moved in 1981, so this was all impossibly brilliant for the impressionable 11-year-old; his first vivid World Cup memory. Southgate has vague recollections of the 1978 finals, having to support Scotland because England had not qualified, the ticker-tape and all the rest. But 1982 was his first real World Cup, when the love affair began.\nHe collected the stickers and he was heartbroken when England fell short in the second group phase, throwing on the half-fit Kevin Keegan and Trevor Brooking against Spain but failing to unlock the 0-0. They went home having not lost a game.\n\n\u201cBryan was my hero and I remember both of his goals against France,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cIt was my first World Cup watching England and also the Brazilian team of that tournament \u2013 Zico, \u00c9der, Falc\u00e3o, S\u00f3crates \u2026\n\u201cI was a midfield player like Bryan. Not of his class but I used to chip in with a few goals. To get to work with him as a player with England [Robson was the assistant manager from 1994-96] \u2026 I found that really difficult. The same with Steve Coppell [who managed Southgate at Crystal Palace]. They were both heroes of mine so, yeah, I never really got fully comfortable with that until later.\u201d\nAs Southgate and England prepare for their World Cup quarter-final against France on Saturday, in Qatar\u2019s northern outpost of Al Khor, it is strange to think it will be the first meeting between the nations at this competition since 1982. They have played each other on only one other occasion at the World Cup \u2013 the final group-stage tie in 1966 when England won 2-0 en route to the trophy.\nSouthgate has another France game in his thoughts, rather lower profile and less emotional but of real significance in terms of his England journey. It came in June 2017 at the Stade de France \u2013 his only managerial clash against Les Bleus \u2013 a 3-2 friendly defeat in which the gap between the nations was mapped out in graphic detail.\n\nAn 18-year-old Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 ran riot and so did Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9. France were quicker, stronger, superior in every department. They had Rapha\u00ebl Varane sent off when he conceded a penalty for 2-2 but it felt as though France had the extra man thereafter, Demb\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019s winner the least they deserved.\nThat was then, this is now and England approach the quarter-final as a team transformed \u2013 not only in personnel \u2013 comfortable in themselves and their system. Belief is high and it was reinforced by the manner of their 3-0 win against Senegal in the last 16.\nDeclan Rice was asked whether France ought to fear England rather than it being the other way around \u2013 as perhaps it was in 2017. \u201cYes,\u201d the midfielder replied. \u201cI don\u2019t think we get the credit we deserve. If Holland and Argentina win their games comfortably, they get called masterclasses.\n\u201cWith us, it always gets picked off. The negative things always come that way. If you look at the last couple of games, it\u2019s been faultless. I think countries should be starting to fear us now because we\u2019re a great team.\u201d\nJude Bellingham, the man of the moment, also caught the mood. \u201cWe\u2019re getting to that point now, confidence-wise, where we think we can try and take on anyone. We play with a fearlessness. Especially as young boys, we don\u2019t really care about who we\u2019re playing against.\u201d\nIt is easy to worry about Mbapp\u00e9. As England made the coach journey to the Senegal game, Luke Shaw said that they were able to watch the last 20 minutes of France\u2019s 3-1 win against Poland. Mbapp\u00e9 scored twice during the period, giving him five for the tournament, a grip on the Golden Boot and a channel into the minds of England\u2019s defenders.\nIt would be naive to focus purely on Mbapp\u00e9. France have other threats. And yet his presence, his ability to produce at the decisive moment, is by some distance the most insistent line of questioning for Southgate and his players. How to stop Mbapp\u00e9?\n\nEngland have made it this far in a 4-3-3 system, the balance of the midfield key. Since Jordan Henderson has come into the team, he has provided a measure of security around Bellingham, allowing the 19-year-old the freedom to push higher, to force turnovers, to drive with the ball. Rice adds his own qualities in front of the defence.\nThere has long been the feeling that when England face an elite-level opponent, Southgate will revert to a back three \u2013 using Kieran Trippier at right wing-back and Kyle Walker at right centre-half. This would offer a double bolt against Mbapp\u00e9, who has operated off the left.\nAs an aside, it was a concern to see how the Senegal winger Isma\u00efla Sarr beat Walker and got away from him in one first-half incident. Walker, who had to foul him, fortunately escaping a yellow card, has played only twice since groin surgery on 4 October.\nSouthgate knows what everybody at home will want; stick with the back four, try to be assertive in midfield. If England are to lose, then better to go out swinging. He appeared to suggest that he was thinking along those lines, although there remains plenty of time before the game.\n\u201cWe\u2019re wanting to be positive and we feel we\u2019ve done that so far in this tournament,\u201d Southgate said, when asked whether he was considering a safer approach. \u201cWe\u2019ve got energy in the team, we\u2019ve got depth in the squad. So I don\u2019t think we should be drifting too far from what we\u2019ve been. You\u2019ve obviously got to make allowances for the opposition and find out where you can exploit them but we\u2019ve got good players to come in, as well.\u201d\n\nRice made an upbeat final point, attacking the criticism that has followed England\u2019s performances in the first half-hour of games \u2013 and the first halves against the USA and Wales.\n\u201cAgainst the big teams, there has always been a lot of talk about us using the ball,\u201d Rice said. \u201cIn this tournament, we\u2019ve pretty much controlled every game. We\u2019ve had a fair share of possession, we\u2019ve moved it really well.\n\u201cThe opening stages [of games] have been really shaky because teams are really trying to stop us playing. But once we get that goal, they have to change. It opens up and then you really start to see us play. Against France, we\u2019ve seen some weaknesses in them that we can try to exploit. It\u2019s set up for a great game.\u201d"

                    "body": "The Lionesses have set their sights on winning the World Cup next August after securing England\u2019s first major trophy since 1966.\nWith the silver confetti barely settled on the Euro 2022 triumph, Chloe Kelly, whose goal earned England a historic 2-1 win over Germany, said: \u201cOne is not enough \u2013 we want more.\u201d\nShortly after she had pranced across the stage at a packed Trafalgar Square to \u201cSweet Caroline\u201d, she said: \u201cLooking at this medal makes you so much hungrier for more.\n\u201cThe World Cup is around the corner. I want to win trophies. As a young girl you grow up seeing people win trophies and we\u2019re here doing that.\u201d\n\nLucy Bronze has won every honour available to her at club level but said she \u201cwould\u2019ve traded all those trophies previously for a night like Sunday\u201d. She echoed Kelly\u2019s desire to go one better.\n\u201cAnybody that knows me knows I\u2019m like that,\u201d the full-back said. \u201cThe Euros is fantastic, especially in my home country, but there is a little star missing from our crest at the minute on the England shirt. That\u2019s definitely a mission of ours.\u201d\nThe United States are the team to beat, having won back-to-back World Cups in 2015 and 2019 to add to their 1991 and 1999 victories. Was the Euros win a sign England are coming for their crown? \u201cHah,\u201d said Bronze with a grin. \u201cThey\u2019re the holders of the World Cup and they\u2019re the ones that knocked us out in 2019.\n\u201cWe know there are plenty of teams outside of Europe who want to compete for that World Cup as well as the teams in Europe who were in this tournament. I guess it\u2019s up for grabs and we\u2019re in a good place at the minute.\u201d\nEngland\u2019s captain, Leah Williamson, said she was flattered by comparisons to the 1966 captain, Bobby Moore. \u201cHe\u2019s a legend isn\u2019t he,\u201d she said with a large exhale of breath. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that we were the same age at the point we had done this. He\u2019s got the World Cup. He\u2019s one up on me, right?\u201d\n\nThe Football Association\u2019s chief executive, Mark Bullingham, said the Euros title had come \u201cearlier than we could have ever hoped\u201d, 11 months into Sarina Wiegman\u2019s tenure.\n\u201cShe is incredible,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was our No 1 target when we were going out to look for a manager and she was just brilliant all through that process. Not in our wildest dreams did we imagine this success so soon. We thought that this tournament might be too early. We weren\u2019t sure we\u2019d win this one \u2013 we were hoping we would win one in the future.\u201d\nWiegman started in September but the FA would \u201clove her to be with us for a long time\u201d. Its director of women\u2019s football, Sue Campbell, said she would \u201chave a conversation\u201d with Wiegman, who received a hero\u2019s welcome from fans in Trafalgar Square and is in line for a six-figure bonus, when the manager returns from a campervan holiday with her family.\n\u201cYou have to remember she only came in in September,\u201d Lady Campbell said. \u201cEverybody said to me: \u2018Do you think she can win the Euros?\u2019 and I said: \u2018It\u2019s a very short time span that.\u2019\n\u201cMy goodness, she\u2019s moulded them together. Not just the players, the team around her. There\u2019s a togetherness. You have to be in it to feel it. There\u2019s no people sitting on the edge, there\u2019s nobody outside the bubble. They\u2019re all in this together and she\u2019s uncompromising on that front.\u201d\nThere is a statue of Wiegman on the Dutch football federation\u2019s campus after her home Euros win with the Netherlands in 2017. Where will the statue go here? \u201cGood question. Probably St George\u2019s Park,\u201d said Campbell."

If not, then it\u2019s a pyramid - and pyramids eventually collapse.\nRegulating the stablecoins, ensuring interoperability of CBDC\u2019s (central bank digital currencies) is something we need to work on, she adds.\n\n\n\n 4.31pm  \n\nHere\u2019s a video clip of IMF chief Kristaline Georgieva warning a few minutes ago that 2022 will be a tough year (as it has been already!).\nShe also points out that the oil price dipped in the last week on signs of economic slowdown, but food kept rising. \nThat\u2019s because you can shrink petrol use when growth slows, but people still have to eat every day.\n\n\n\n\n 4.16pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 4.10pm  \n\nBillionaire businessman David Rubenstein tells the Global Economic Outlook panel that the markets have overreacted this year, with Wall Street tumbling to around bear market territory.\nAnd he denies that the slump in technology stocks this year is a repeat of the dot-com crash in 2000. \nBack then, companies with little more than a business plan, without revenues let alone profits, had floated in the dot-com boom. It\u2019s not the same situation today.\n\n\n\n\n\n 4.03pm  \n\nIMF managing director Kristaline Georgieva adds that two countries are already in recesssion -- Ukraine (which could contract by 35% this year), and Russia.\nOthers, such as Sri Lanka, have been caught up in debt crisis due to the shocks from the war.\n\n\n\n 3.59pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 3.57pm  \nCitigroup's Fraser: Europe will enter recession\n\nA Davos panel on the global economic outlook is also underway.\nAnd it starts with a show of hands -- how many of the \u201cbrains trust at the World Economic Forum\u201d are concerned that we are going into recession?\nAbout half the hands in the room go up.\nQ: So are we already in recession in some countries?\nInternational Monetary Fund chief Kristalina Georgieva says not, but warns that the economic outlook has darkened since the IMF\u2019s last forecasts.\nShe cites the food crisis, saying that anxiety over access to food at a reasonable price, globally, is hitting the roof.\nPlus, the climate crisis has gone nowhere and the digital money has hit a little rough spot (the slump in cryptocurrency assets).\nLooking ahead, Georgieva says we may see recessions in some countries which were weak, perhaps hadn\u2019t recovered from the pandemic, or very dependent on Russian oil.\nBut we have not seen that yet, she insists.\nHowever, Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup is also on the panel, and she warns that Russia, Recession and (interest) Rates are the key factors to watch.\n\nAsked if Europe will experience a recession, Fraser replies Yes, adding that she hopes she\u2019s wrong.\n\n[On rates, European Central Bank Christine Lagarde said today the ECB is likely to start raising interest rates in July and exit sub-zero territory by the end of September.\nThat made the ECN the latest central banker to turn more hawkish, in the face of high inflation].\nMore from the panel:\n\n\nUpdated at 4.28pm BST\n\n\n 3.30pm  \n\n\nWith the World Cup in Qatar looming at the end of the year, the event had its own session in Davos. \nA feisty affair with over the top tackles it was not, as the panel dished out platitude after platitude.\nGianni Infantino, the president of FIFA, said five billion people would tune in and it would be the \u201cbest World Cup ever\u201d. \nPatrice Motsepe, president of the Confederation of African Football, said he couldn\u2019t think of a better place to hold the World Cup. \nRonaldo, the Brazilian striker, said it was marvelous he was a role model to today\u2019s superstars. Former Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger spent a couple of minutes talking about how good coaching was about getting the best out of people. \nNobody was going to get into trouble mentioning the circumstances under which Qatar was awarded the right to hold the tournament or the deaths of workers on the construction sites. \n\n\n\n 3.27pm  \nQatar Amir blames discrimination for World Cup criticism\n\nThe Amir of the State of Qatar, Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, has hit out at criticism over its hosting of the World Cup late this year.\nIn a keynote speech here in Davos, the Amir says the Middle East has suffered from discrimination for decades - from people \u201cnot knowing us, and in some cases refusing to get to know us\u201d.\nHe says:\n\nEven today there are still people who cannot accept the idea that an Arab Muslim country would host a tournament like the World Cup. \n\nHe adds:\n\nThese individuals, including many in positions of influence, have launched attacks at a pace not seen before when a mega sporting event was hosted by other countries on different continents,\n\nHe doesn\u2019t say any particular countries, but that \u201ceach had its own particular problems and challenges\u201d.\n\nHowever.... concerns over human rights protections in Qatar are well documented, with Amnesty reporting that tens of thousands of migrant workers still face \u201cforced labour\u201d.\nLast year, the Guardian reported that more than 6,500 migrant workers from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have died in Qatar since it won the right to host the World Cup 10 years ago.\nAnd last week, a group of non-government organisations said Fifa should pay reparations of at least $440m (\u00a3356m) to migrant workers whose human rights have been compromised by the Qatar World Cup.\n\n\nPlus, there are also concerns about the safety of LGBTQ+ people in Qatar, given same-sex relationships are directly criminalised under the laws of the Gulf state.\n\n\n\n 3.03pm  \nWorld 'on cusp of vicious cycle'\n\nThe economic disruption caused by Covid-19 and the Ukraine war will drive up inflation, hit growth and create more food insecurity, a new survey just released show.\nThe World Economic Forum\u2019s Community of Chief Economists predicts further declines in real wages in both high- and low-income economies, as inflation rises faster than pay.\nThe world faces the worst food insecurity in recent history \u2013 especially in the Middle East and North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.\nDeveloping economies face trade-offs between the risk of debt crisis and securing food and fuel, it adds, (as Sri Lanka showed by defaulting last week).\nSaadia Zahidi, managing director at the World Economic Forum, warns the world is on \u201cthe cusp of a vicious cycle\u201d that could impact societies for years, and erase the progress since the end of the cold war.\n\nThe pandemic and war in Ukraine have fragmented the global economy and created far-reaching consequences that risk wiping out the gains of the last 30 years.\nLeaders face difficult choices and trade-offs domestically when it comes to debt, inflation and investment. Yet business and government leaders must also recognise the absolute necessity of global cooperation to prevent economic misery and hunger for millions around the world.\n\n\n\n\n 2.49pm  \nOxfam: Developed world's complacency over Covid could be deadly\n\nGabriela Bucher, executive director of Oxfam, says developed economies are neglecting the Covid-19 crisis in emerging economies - with potentially deadly results.\nBucher tells a Davos panel that vaccine injustice is a risk.\nThe rich world moves on, thinking that Covid is no longer a problem as they are vaccinated. So they forget that global south still faces waves of the virus, and low vaccination rates (just 15% across Africa). \nShe says:\n\nThe focus moves away and that is not addressed.\n\nBucher explains that the vaccine isn\u2019t yet readily available globally at the scale needed. That means that...\n\n ...in six months, the complacency that is perhaps felt now could be really deadly.\n\n\nModerna\u2019s CEO, St\u00e9phane Bancel, agrees that there are several reasons to worry, both in the south and the north.\nIn the US, only half of vaccinated people got boosted with a third dose, so he worries about the next fall (autumn) and winter as their antibody levels falls.\nChina\u2019s outbreaks are a concern too; a more infectious virus is harder to control with the measures which were very successful in 2020.\nWe always need to be humble with biology - and remember that a more virulent virus could emerge over time, says Bancel.\nIt was good news that Omicron was less virulent than Delta, but \u201cwe are always a day away, a week away, a month away or a quarter away\u201d from a new variant that\u2019s more virulent.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.05pm BST\n\n\n 2.27pm  \n\nMichael McCaul, Republican congressman, has warned that the Ukraine conflict could lead to a new \u2018hot war\u2019 between Russia and the West.\nSpeaking on a panel here in Davos, McCaul says Russia\u2019s tactics have been almost World War Two-style, and that the US military have been astonished by how incompetent Russia\u2019s military have been.\nPutin has totally miscalculated, he says, having lost a third of its invasion force.\nBut warning that the conflict could escalate, McCaul (who represents Texas\u2019 10th Congressional District) says:\n\nIt\u2019s a cold war, but it\u2019s on the verge of becoming a hot war.\n\nHe points out that Putin has now brought in the \u201cButcher of Syria\u201d (General Aleksandr Dvornikov) and put him in charge of the war.\nMcCaul says the biggest concern is that the Butcher of Syria could use chemical weapons, or a tactical nuclear weapon. \nWe need to think about how NATO, and the world, would respond if that happened, he adds.\nIan Bremmer of Eurasia Group is also on the panel, which asks if a new Cold War is taking shape between major powers.\nBremmer says we are in a new cold war, and closer to a new hot war than he\u2019d like.\nBut while there has been a \u2018forced decoupling\u2019, putting Russia into a lot of trouble and a pariah state with the West, it is not a pariah for countries such as India, China, and Brazil.\nUkrainian MP Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze says the conflict is between \u2018world and anti-world\u2019, and that Ukraine needs more sanctions, more weapons, more backing.\n\n\n\n 1.12pm  \nWFP head: Failure to reopen Ukraine's ports if 'declaration of war' on food security\n\nThe head of the UN World Food Programme says failure to break open Ukraine\u2019s blockaded ports is \u201ca declaration of war on global food security\u201d.\nHe warned it would lead to rising hunger, and increased migration to Europe.\nDavid Beasley, executive director of the World Food Programme, told a panel here that: \n\n\u201cFailure to open up Ukraine\u2019s ports is a declaration of war on global food security.\u201d \n\nOpening the ports would be one step in progress towards food stability. Beasley said, giving a stark warning to European countries about the implications of people going hungry. \n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry just about what\u2019s happening to the east of you, you also need to worry about what\u2019s happening to the south of you.\nEvery 1% increase in hunger leads to a 2% increase in migration.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 1.01pm  \n\nThe energy security crisis since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine must not lead to a deeper dependence on fossil fuels, International Energy (IEA) chief Fatih Birol has warned.\nSpeaking here in Davos, Birol told a panel that:\n\n\u201cWe need fossil fuels in the short term, but let\u2019s not lock in our future by using the current situation as an excuse to justify some of the investments being done, time-wise it doesn\u2019t work and morally in my view it doesn\u2019t work as well.\n\nInstead, he argues, correct investments, especially in renewable energy and nuclear power, mean the world need not choose between being short of energy, and higher fossil fuel emissions driving climate change.\n\n\n\n 12.47pm  \n\nElsewhere in Davos, the head of chipmaker Intel has said a shortage of advanced equipment to make semiconductors could hold up global expansion plans, Associated Press reports:\nCEO Pat Gelsinger said Monday that there have been \u201cquite significant extensions\u201d in delivery times for chipmaking gear for new chip factories, known as \u201cfabs,\u201d that the company plans to build in the U.S. and Europe.\nGelsinger said at a press roundtable on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum that \u201cto us, this is now the No. 1 issue, is in fact the delivery of equipment.\u201d\nA handful of suppliers make high-tech semiconductor manufacturing gear, such as Dutch company ASML. A shortage of semiconductors that erupted last year hurt the availability of everything from autos to kitchen appliances and highlighted the industry\u2019s vulnerability to manufacturing centered in Asia.\nIntel announced tens of billions of investment in new chipmaking facilities for Europe, including a new fab mega site in Germany and expansion in Ireland. In January, it announced a plan for a $20 billion plant in Ohio.\nGelsinger said supply of chipmaking equipment is \u201cthe most important pinch point to the build-out of capacity today.\u201d\nHe added that he\u2019s urging authorities in the U.S. and Europe, which have each launched their own \u201cChips Act\u201d to promote national semiconductor manufacturing, to speed up the legislation.\n\n\n\n 12.41pm  \nKey event\n\nWinnie Byanyima, once the head of Oxfam International and now the executive director of UNAIDS has some tough words to say about the way the world has responded to the global pandemic.\n\u201cThe impact of Covid 19 was racist and sexist\u201d, she said. \u201cThat\u2019s how it is felt by people in the global south.\u201d\nByanyima said girls were removed from schools as a result of the pandemic and never returned, and gender-based violence increased..\nMeanwhile, there was a massive disparity between the 75% vaccination rates of developed countries and the 15% vaccine rates in Africa.\n\n\u201cAfrica was at the back of the queue while rich countries helped themselves to stocks of personal protective equipment and treatments. If that\u2019s not racist, what is?\u201d. \n\nThe Davos meeting, she added, was supposed to be about recovery from the health and economic crises of the past two years. \n\n\u201cBut you are not going to tackle those issues without tackling the inequality crisis\u201d\n\nByanyima called for a three-point programme to address global inequality: more generous debt relief; the re-cycling of special drawing rights (the global reserve assets issues by the IMF) to benefit poor nations; and changes to intellectual property rights to allow developing countries to manufacture their own Covid drugs.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t pretend we are on a path of recovery until we address these global structural barriers that are driving racial and geographic inequality.\u201d\n\nStressing that another pandemic in the future was highly probable, Byanyima said: \u201cWe are learning nothing and it\u2019s depressing\u201d.\n\n\n\n 12.37pm  \nKlitschkos: Ukraine is fighting for you\n\n\nKyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko and brother Wladimir are addressing the World Economic Forum about the crisis.\nVitali contrasts the peaceful, sunny atmosphere here in Davos with the conflict 2,000 kilometres from here, where he explains people are dying every day in a senseless war because of Putin\u2019s vision to rebuild the Soviet Union.\nUkraine is fighting for other countries as well as itself, and paying the biggest price in human lives, he says, explaining that \u201cwe are fighting, first of all, for values\u201d.\nEchoing the message we heard from Ukrainian MPs last night, he says that support is needed, and that weapons are \u201cvery important\u201d.\nFellow former world boxing champion Wladimir explains that Ukranians are prepared to fight a long fight, and not give in -- at a time when some countries are looking for a negotiated peace agreement.\nHe says it took two months for international community to recognise that weapons were needed, so....\n\nThe longer it goes, the more the world understands it must be stopped - the sooner the better.\n\nIf we, the free world give in, it\u2019s the beginning of the end. Unless the aggressor pays severe consequences, lessons won\u2019t be learned, Wladimir argues.\nAnd he adds:\n\nPropaganda must be banned. State-owned media only must be banned.\n\n\n\n\nUpdated at 1.07pm BST\n\n\n 12.09pm  \nSir Lawrence Freedman: Black Sea issue is looming large\n\nSir Lawrence Freedman, emeritus professor of War Studies at King\u2019s College London, is here in Davos.\nHe tells me that Ukraine has a very uncompromising, understandable message to Davos:\n\nThe Ukraine line is there\u2019s no time to waste.\nJust hit hard, hit now, and we need all the support we can get.\nAnd don\u2019t nod in the direction of the Russians, they\u2019ve got nothing to give you.\n\nAnd on the blockage of Ukraine\u2019s exports, Freedman says the Black Sea issue is \u201clooming large\u201d now.\n\nThere\u2019s an awful lot of economic discussion, political discussion, military discussion going on. \nIt\u2019s evident there are lots of conversations, as Zelenskiy said.\n\nFreedman explains that the key is to get international signup for a corridor to get Ukraine\u2019s exports moving (as president Zelenskiy called for). \nAnd the starting point should be that this corridor is a humanitarian effort, rather than economic warfare against Russia.\nFreedman thinks it\u2019s \u2018not impossible\u2019 that Russia would decide not to interfere, as if it blocked a corridor completely then its own ships could become more vulnerable.\nIncidentally, he covered the issue of the Black Sea blockade in this Substack post last week.\n\n\n\n\n 11.38am  \n\n\n\n\n\n 11.18am  \n\n\n\n\n\n 11.10am  \n\nQ: And finally, what is your personal message to each leader here?\nEach one? President Zelenskiy suggests it\u2019s not possible. \nAfter all, there\u2019s a thousand of them, and I\u2019m really short of time, he points out.\nBut he then makes a very serious point:\n\nUkraine is short on time now. I\u2019m pretty sure that no-one knows how much time Europe or the World has. \n\nBecause of that, the world must not lose the unity which worries Russia the most.\nAnd as a finale, he produces some sage advice for the Davos audience.\nThey should wake up each morning with the feeling \u201cWhat have I done for Ukraine today?\u201d\nAnd that\u2019s the end of the session.\n\n\n\n 11.06am  \n\nQ: Given Ukraine\u2019s crucial role in the global food system, how can the global community help you to export more of your products, given the blockade at present?\nZelenskiy says Russia is stealing Ukraine\u2019s grain, having blockaged its Black Sea ports.\nHe\u2019s been talking to many leaders such as Boris Johnson, the leaders of Poland, Turkey, and Switzerland, and the UN, to find solutions.\nHe says a corridor must be established to allow exports, such as wheat and sunflower oil.\nOtherwise there will be shortages of these food products - including Asia and Africa, everywhere.\nBy blockaging ports to stop food being exported, Russia is continuing the energy crisis last year.\n\nWe need to agree a corridor, and Russia will not be able to stand against the leading countries of the world\n\nThis could use railways, or seaports on the Baltic coast, but there is no simple solution.\n\nUpdated at 11.19am BST\n\n\n 10.51am  \n\nOnto questions:\nQ: What is your vision for the future of Ukraine?\nZelenskiy sticks to the present first - saying there are 87 dead bodies, victims of the conflict, today.\nThe future of Ukraine will be there, but without them.\nUkraine is losing a lot, every day, but it makes us stronger, Zelenskiy insist.\nAnd the future of the country will include strong new security priorities, as with a neighbour like Russia on the doorstep, anything can happen.\nUkraine must create conditions where people and businesses aren\u2019t afraid to exist and thrive there.\nAnd that will include up-to-date defence system, most modern, multi-modal defence and security system, and cooperative defence agreements with countries we respect, he adds.\n\n\n\n 10.45am  \n\nZelenskiy then quote George Marshall (of the post-WW2 rebuilding plan for Europe), who said that he didn\u2019t oppose any country, but opposed \u201chunger, poverty, dispair, chaos\u201d.\nThat is Zelenskiy\u2019s hope for the future, as he ends his speech.\nHe then gets a standing ovation from the audience here - a rare event for Davos (I think Nelson Mandela, for example, would have got one!).\n\n\n\n 10.42am  \n\n\n\n\n\n 10.41am  \n\nZelenskiy then turns to the business leaders here at Davos, urging those who have not yet quit Russia to do so - and welcomes them to Ukraine instead.\nIt is necessary to set a precedent for full withdrawal of all foreign companies from Russia, so they aren\u2019t used for the \u201cbloody interests\u201d of Russia.\nAny company which leaves Russia is welcome to move to the Ukraine market, says Zelenskiy, saying companies would benefit by truly supporting freedom.\nAnd turning to the massive challenge of rebuilding Ukraine , he says:\n\nWe offer the world the chance to set a precedent for what happens if you try to destroy a neighbour.\nI invite you to take part in this rebuilding.\n\nAnd this rebuilding could be partly funded by finding Russian assets hidden overseas, freezing them, and allocating them to a special fund to help those hurt by the war.\n\nUpdated at 11.20am BST\n\n\n 10.37am  \nZelenskiy calls for \u201cMaximum sanctions\u201d\n\nZelenskiy calls for \u201cMaximum sanctions\u201d against Russia , so that Russia and any other country that wants to launch a brutal invasion against its neighbour is deterred.\nI think there are no such sanctions at present, he insists, and calls for\n\nFull oil embargo\nAll Russian banks barred from global systems - no exampcions\nabandon Rusia IT sector\nNo trade with Russia \n\n\n\n\n 10.33am  \n\nZelenskiy says Ukraine has fought longer than expected, but says it wouldn\u2019t have needed to have endured the war, with so many casualties, if tough sanctions had been imposed last autumn.\nIf there had been full unity back in 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea, would they have launched February\u2019s invasion? Again, Zelenskiy thinks not.\n\n\n\n 10.31am  \n\nZelenskiy cites the creation of the Russian War Crimes House in Davos this year, as evidence of Russia\u2019s conduct in the war.\n\nHistory remembers how institutions and countries respond to these events, Zelenskiy says -- citing 1938 in Munich as an example of how history remembers these decisions.\n\nUpdated at 11.31am BST\n\n\n 10.28am  \nZelenskiy: Will brute force rule the world?\n\nZelenskiy begins by saying it is a great honour to take part in this year\u2019s Davos - whose theme is history at a turning point.\nThis year, the phrase word \u2018turning point\u2019 is more than rhetoric - this is the moment when it is decided whether brute force will rule the world, says Zelenskiy.\nIf it does, then there is no point in gatherings such as Davos.\n\n\n\n 10.26am  \n\nThere\u2019s a small pause.... and then Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, appears on the video link, receiving a round of applause from the assembled audience here.\nWEF founder Klaus Schwab introduces Zelenskiy, saying we have all seen his couragous leadership, and want to hear what lies ahead for Ukraine, and how we can assist.\n\n\n\n 10.19am  \n\nPresident of the Swiss Confederation, Ignazio Cassis, is speaking first, telling WEF that Switzerland could not remain neutral in the Russia-Ukraine war:\n\n\nSwitzerland could play a mediation role once the war has ended, he suggests.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.20am BST\n\n\n 10.14am  \nZelenskiy addresses Davos - watch live here\n\nUkrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy will soon address the World Economic Forum by videolink.\nThe large, main Congress Hall here at Davos is packed out in readiness.\n\n\n\n\n 10.14am  \n\n\n\n\n\n 9.56am  \n\"Russian War Crimes House\" opens\n\nAn exhibition tracking atrocities committed by Russia in the Ukraine war is formally opening this morning.\nThe \u201cRussian War Crimes House\u201d has been set up in a space on the Davos Promenade, which in prior years had been taken over by the Russian delegation for meetings, parties, vodka and canapes.\nBut with Russian entities now frozen out, the space now includes a map showing where over 4,177 civilians have died in the conflict, including 226 children.\nIt also shows a video of 4,600 photos showing evidence of war crimes, including photos of bombed streeets and houses.\nThe exhibition is supported by Ukrainian oligarch and businessman Victor Pinchuk, through his Foundation and PinchukArtCentre.\nOutside, a sign reads:\n\n\u201cThis used to be the Russian House in Davos. Now it\u2019s the Russian War Crimes House in Davos.\u201d\n\n\nOpening the exhibition, Pinchuk explains how he has supported building a memorial victims of the Babi Yar massacre of nearly 34,000 Ukrainian jews during the Nazi occupation in the second world war, with a dream of \u2018never again\u2019.\nBut that hope has been extinguished since February 24th.\n\nSince the Russian invasion, we see that genocide against Ukrainians by Russians happen now.\nUnfortunately, never again didn\u2019t work.\n\nPinchuk explains that today, we can see the genocide \u2018almost online\u2019, and the killers know we see.\nHe hopes that the exhibition will encourage Russian soldiers to stop atrocities.\n\nMaybe if we tell the story of this tragedy loudly it will stop them, and save some lives.\n\nIryna Venediktova, Prosecutor General of Ukraine, spoke by videolink, and said there was evidence of summary executions, torture, rape, the rape of minors, and the forced transfer of Ukrainian children to Russian familes.\n\nBj\u00f6rn Geldhof, artistic director of the PinchukArtCentre, explains that the exhibition shows the most horrific moments of the war, shows the victims, and gives back a name and a face to those who suffered from those Russian war crimes.\nGeldhof explains the need to maintain awareness about what is happening in Ukraine.\n\nThe war is not just about Ukraine\u2019s survival, it is about values.\nUkraine has chosen European values of freedom time and time again. In 2004, in 2014 and now. that\u2019s what they\u2019re dying for, and fighting for.\nThis war of values is exactly why it is so important to keep standing with Ukraine. To keep giving Ukraine the tools it needs to keep defending itself.\n\nThis is a long-term war, which won\u2019t end quickly, so the support must be sustainable and long-term, Geldhof adds.\n\n\n\n 9.07am  \nUkraine: Russia must be completely isolate\n\nUkraine\u2019s deputy prime minister Yuliia Svyrydenko had a stark message in Davos for those countries and companies starting to have second thoughts about sanctions against Russia.\nCalling for Russia to be completely isolated, Svyrydenko said:\n\n \u201cArmies win battles but the economy wins wars\u201d.\n\nMany companies, she told a panel on economic warfare, had announced they were pulling out of the Russian market but were still operating. \n\n\u201cNow is not the time for a cost benefit analysis. We have to cut Russia off from the global economy completely.\u201d\n\nSvyrydenko said there should be secondary sanctions against companies that circumvented the economic measures brought in following Russia\u2019s invasion and called for frozen Russian assets to be used to help rebuild Ukraine\u2019s economy, set to contract by at least 30% this year.\nAnn Wagner, a republican member of the US house of representatives, said Vladimir Putin needed to get a \u201cvery clear and consistent message that there will be an ironclad commitment to implementation\u201d of sanctions. \nEurope, she added, had to end its reliance on Russian energy. Moscow should be kicked out of the G20 and other multi-lateral institutions such as the Bank for International Settlements.\n\n\n\n 7.51am  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n 7.50am  \nKey event\n\nThe fortunes of food and energy billionaires have grown by $453bn over the past two years owing to soaring energy and commodity prices during the pandemic and Vladimir Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine, a report by Oxfam has revealed.\nAs the world\u2019s business and political elite meet for the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the development charity said spiralling global food prices had helped create \u201c62 new food billionaires\u201d in just 24 months.\n\n\n\n\n 7.42am  \nIMF head warns of \u2018biggest test since second world war\u2019\n\nIMF chief Kristalina Georgieva has warned that the global economy could be facing its biggest test since the Second World War.\nAt the start of Davos, Georgieva called for a fight against geoeconomic defragmentation, and identifies four \u2018urgent issues\u2019.\nOne is the possible creation of a \u2018public digital platform\u2019 to make it cheaper to transfer money between borders, along with cutting trade barriers, progress on debt relief, and accelerating climate change work.\nGeorgieva writes:\nFirst, strengthen trade to increase resilience.\n\nWe can start now by lowering trade barriers to alleviate shortages and lower the prices of food and other products.\nNot only countries but also companies need to diversify imports\u2014to secure supply chains and preserve the tremendous benefits to business of global integration. While geostrategic considerations will drive some sourcing decisions, this need not lead to disintegration. Business leaders have an important role to play in this regard.\nNew IMF research shows that diversification can cut potential GDP losses from supply disruptions in half. Auto manufacturers and others have found that designing products that can use substitutable or more widely available parts can reduce losses by 80 percent.\nDiversifying exports can also increase economic resilience. Policies that help include: enhancing infrastructure to help businesses shorten supply chains, increasing broadband access, and improving the business environment. The WTO can also help with its overall support for more predictable, transparent trade policies.\n\nSecond, step up joint efforts to deal with debt.\n\nWith roughly 60 percent of low-income countries with significant debt vulnerabilities, some will need debt restructuring. Without decisive cooperation to ease their burdens, both they and their creditors will be worse off. But a return to debt sustainability will draw new investment and spur inclusive growth.\nThat is why the Group of Twenty\u2019s Common Framework for Debt Treatment must be improved without delay. This means putting in place clear procedures and timelines for debtors and creditors\u2014and making the framework available to other highly-indebted vulnerable countries.\n\nThird, modernize cross-border payments .\n\nInefficient payment systems are another barrier to inclusive growth. Take remittances: the average cost of an international transfer is 6.3 percent. This means some $45 billion per year are diverted into the hands of intermediaries\u2014and away from millions of lower-income households.\nA possible solution? Countries could work together to develop a global public digital platform\u2014a new piece of payment infrastructure with clear rules\u2014so that everyone can send money at minimal cost and maximum speed and safety. It could also connect various forms of money, including central bank digital currencies.\n\nFourth, confront climate change: the existential challenge that looms above everything .\n\nDuring the COP26 climate conference, 130 countries, representing over 80 percent of global emissions, committed to achieve net-zero carbon by around mid-century.\nBut we urgently need to close the gap between ambition and policy. To accelerate the green transition, the IMF has argued for a comprehensive approach that combines carbon pricing and investment in renewables, and compensation for those adversely affected.\n\n\n\n\n 7.28am  \n\nIvana Kylmpush-Tsintsadze MP has also said she will be urging states, including Germany, to boycott Russian gas and oil.\nShe told Sky News:\n\n\u201cIf you are paying Russian companies for their oil and gas you are giving them resources to continue destroying our towns, our villages, killing our children, raping our women, elderly, babies, toddlers and destroying our country.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n 7.27am  \nMP: Victory means full restoration of our territorial integrity\n\nThe Ukrainian MPs in Davos also explained that winning the war means restoring all the territory lost to Russia.\nIvanna Klympush-Tsintsadze MP explained she doesn\u2019t understand why Crimea should be seen differently than any other part of Ukrainian territory. \nShe said the world reacted with \u201cpitiful sanctions\u201d in 2014, warning that if any Ukrainian land is left under Russian control, it will be used by Russia as a platform for future attacks.\n\nInternational law, respect of borders, means victory means full restoration of our territorial integrity, sovereigny and independence.\n\nIt also sends an important signal to other dictatorial systems across the globe, she says.\nYevheniya Kravchuk MP gave a pithy response to this question too:\n\nJust imagine from your perspective, someone tells you that you have to give part of London to Russia because there are so many Russians in London.\n\nThere is a bully in the room, they have to be punished, she added.\nYesterday Ukraine\u2019s presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, also said Ukraine will not agree to any ceasefire deal that would involve handing over territory to Russia.\nYermak said in a Twitter post:\n\nThe war must end with the complete restoration of Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity and sovereignty.\n\n\n\n\n\n 7.20am  \nIntroduction: Ukrainian MPs call for tougher sanctions on Russia, and NATO-style heavy weaponry\n\n\nGood morning from Davos, where the Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum gets underway today.\nThe Ukraine war takes centre stage at Davos this year, along with the global food crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic. \nAnd five Ukrainian MPs are calling for more humanitarian, financial and weaponry support to win the conflict.\nYevheniya Kravchuk MP explained why Ukraine needs military and financial suport, and tougher sanctions on Russia, if it is to prevail:\n\nThat is the only way to stop the atrocities, that happened in Bucha, that happened in Borodyanka, in other small villages in Keiv region. But the same atrocities are happening right now in the occupied territories.\nUkraine will win if it gets enough weapons, enough financial support, and sanctions on Russia that will be really, really harmful, so that Putin will not continue this war or starting any other wars in this world.\n\nIvanna Klympush-Tsintsadze MP said Vladimir Putin had underestimated spirit of Ukrainian people, its armed forces and whole society - and also the reaction of the West.\n\nOur major request to the whole world is do not stop backing Ukraine.\n\nOnly by stopping Russian forces on the \u201cpainful, bleeding battlefield\u201d today will mean this war will not spill over to other regions, she explained.\n\n\u201cOtherwise we will see the unfortunate consequence, and we have to be aware of those.\u201d\n\nKlympush-Tsintsadze added the Russian Federation has to be defeated, isolated and punished through international tribunals such as the ICC, and brought to a point where it cannot wage war on anybody else in the future.\nAnastasia Radina MP, who heads the Ukraine parliament\u2019s anti-corruption committee, also spoke, said Ukraine needs \u201cNATO-style heavy weaponry\u201d.\n\nEnsuring that Ukraine receives a proper supply of counter-offensive heavy weapons is the only way to ensure Ukraine exists, wins, and have a meaningful discussion of other issues such as other issues such as anti-corruption work, or the economy.\n\n\nA total oil and gas embargo was also on the table, Radina added, saying it was \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d that over 70% of Russia\u2019s energy revenues since the war started came from the European Union.\nAlyona Shkrum MP explained everything Davos was trying to build over decades, such as democracy, values, green economy, more involvment of people around world, was under attack by Putin.\nAnd finally, Yulia Klymenko MP said the war was about values, about food security, and about the global order, and that some European politicians had allowed thenselves to become \u2018economic slaves of Russia\u2019, unable to turn off its oil and gas.\nThey\u2019ll be taking this message to leaders and business chiefs here in Davos this week.\n\nLater this morning, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy will address Davos by videolink, at 11.15am Davos time (10.15am BST).\nThroughout the week, more than 50 heads of state or government will be among the 2,500 delegates.\nMajor names speaking over the next few days include Germany\u2019s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, IMF managaging director Kristalina Georgieva, European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen, NATO head Jens Stoltenberg and US climate envoy John Kerry.\nYesterday, a group of millionaires have joined protests against the World Economic Forum gathering of the business and political elite in Davos, Switzerland, demanding that governments \u201ctax us now\u201d to tackle the burgeoning gulf between rich and poor.\nThe unlikely protesters, who describe themselves as \u201cpatriotic millionaires\u201d, called on world leaders attending the annual conference on Sunday to immediately introduce fresh taxes on the wealthy in order to tackle the \u201ccost of living scandal playing out in multiple nations around the world\u201d.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot going on this week, but here\u2019s some of the events to watch out for today.\nThe agenda\n\n8.45am Davos (7.45am BST): Panel on the use and effectiveness of sanctions\n9.45am Davos (8.45am BST): Energy outlook: Overcoming the crisis\n11.15am Davos (10.15am BST): Special address by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy\n12.30pm Davos (11.30am BST): A Discussion with Vitaliy and Wladimir Klitschko\n1pm Davos (noon BST): Averting a global food crisis\n2pm Davos (1pm BST): Special Address by Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, Emir of the State of Qatar.\n4.30pm Davos (3.30pm BST): Global Economic Outlook panal\n\n\n"

                    "body": "There is nothing obscure about the threat posed by Ivory Coast but their visit to Wembley still feels curiously like a break from routine. England have not faced an opponent from outside Europe since November 2018, when the USA were seen off in a friendly; this will be the first and last chance to give preparations for Qatar 2022 a cross-continental flavour. In the seven months leading up to the last World Cup England were able to face Brazil and then, once the draw was known, schedule friendlies in early June against Nigeria and Costa Rica. The theory is traditionally that it pays to test oneself against opposition who are proximate, geographically at least, to forthcoming group stage foes but that is far more difficult now.  After Tuesday night, England will play Germany, Hungary and Italy twice each in the Nations League before travelling to Qatar, but will have no time for further experiments; those fixtures might be at least semi-competitive but none of them are likely to bear surprises. Then again, would any encounter do that? Gareth Southgate was asked whether it really matters that England will not be able to take on more unusual assignments between now and November, and whether the idea of distinct regional styles is outmoded given the level of cross-pollination and scrutiny throughout all corners of the sport. \u201cI think a lot of European football is homogenised but I don\u2019t think world football is yet,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are tactical criteria that transfer across but there are definite attributes, traits and styles that do have cultural differences: South American football with the way it\u2019s played, African football.\u201d By that logic England may wish to avoid Saudi Arabia, Iran and Ecuador in November. Southgate believes the Covid-19 pandemic reduced his chances to experiment but also noted that globetrotting has not been on the agenda for most of their likely rivals. The key will lie in finding ways to mitigate any element of surprise.  \u201cIn an ideal world we\u2019d have exposed our players to more of that [variety],\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve always wanted to do it, at junior level as well. But we\u2019ve missed that opportunity. When I talk to coaches from South America they\u2019re regretting not having that opportunity as well. It\u2019s been a factor in the last couple of years, with the difficulties we have all faced. It\u2019s not what we would like but we\u2019re in no worse a position than anyone else. It will be the teams that adapt best that succeed.\u201d At the Africa Cup of Nations, Ivory Coast were sometimes attacking to the point of being gung-ho but were undone when they failed to break Egypt down, being picked off on penalties in the round of 16 and exiting at a stage that did not befit their threat. As it happens, spot-kicks are an issue to which Southgate can devote time more fruitfully than devising England\u2019s schedule and, since they met up last week, improving their conversion rate has been a significant focus. Harry Kane\u2019s winner against Switzerland came via a penalty, but the Euro 2020 final showed the pitfalls of having inexperienced takers to hand.  Southgate said this month\u2019s camp has seen increased concentration on \u201cwhere we can improve to be world champions\u201d and identified penalties as a factor. \u201cIn terms of regular penalty takers for their club, we really only have Harry Kane and James Ward-Prowse,\u201d he said. \u201c[Marcus] Rashford would have been the second-highest in number, but Bruno Fernandes is [Manchester United\u2019s] normal penalty taker. \u201cWhen we played Italy, their top five had taken more than 40 penalties in competitive matches. Kane is at that level and Marcus is next at 20. So we will have to view that differently than just accept \u2018they\u2019re going to get practice at their clubs and they will be able to come in.\u2019 That is the challenge we have set with some individual work. We think it is the right thing to do.\u201d He would go no further regarding the specifics of any penalty homework, suggesting many in-house matters are \u201cintellectual property\u201d and \u201cthere was too much that didn\u2019t come from football departments that came out about things that happened in Russia\u201d. The slightest change of plan, even the rejigging of a penalty order, can be costly he said. \u201cThere are some specifics of working, and the edge you\u2019re looking to gain as a team, and we\u2019d be foolish to give that to opponents or externally.\u201d  Given Kane may not start against Ivory Coast, the identity of any penalty taker against the Elephants may be instructive. So would the overall performance against Patrice Beaumelle\u2019s side, who were only downed in added time by France on Friday after taking the lead through Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9. Mercurial at club level, P\u00e9p\u00e9 tends to come alive for his country: factors like that are among the many that make international football less predictable than a glance down a squad list might seem. England are taking steps to reduce any reliance on chance. The match on Tuesday may come to look particularly useful once the draw has been made but, after that, much more may hinge on the work that takes place behind closed doors."

                    "body": "Backs against the wall, endless personnel reshuffles, constant talk about things coming good eventually. England are currently 12,000 miles away from Downing Street but their series against Australia is at a not dissimilar crossroads. Lose heavily on Saturday and, as in Westminster, public confidence in those in charge back in London may ebb away rapidly. Which is why Eddie Jones\u2019s callow backline selection for the allegedly crucial second Test against the Wallabies has raised more than a few eyebrows. Three starting 21-year-olds, a 19-year-old \u201capprentice\u201d on the bench and a debutant who used to captain the University of Sydney? If England\u2019s absolute priority is to win right here, right now then the team sheet does not obviously reflect it.  Best wishes, of course, to the talented Jack van Poortvliet, Tommy Freeman and Guy Porter on the occasion of their first England starts, but their collective promotion at the expense of more seasoned alternatives only makes sense through the hazy prism of next year\u2019s World Cup. It would also clearly give the management more breathing space if people can be persuaded a major Test series defeat is no big deal because youth development is the primary aim. Imagine an England cricket captain trying to sell that idea midway through a still-undecided Ashes series in Australia. He would be laughed out of the bottle shop. Of course, there might be future benefits in promoting Freeman now and starting the Leicester pair of Van Poortvliet and Porter ahead of their Harlequins rivals Danny Care and Joe Marchant but, should it result in a fifth straight loss under Jones, the renewed promises of Vegemite tomorrow will wear even thinner. It must also be sapping the morale of the players to see so many of their friends being steadily discarded. Marchant, Joe Cokanasiga, Harry Randall, Max Malins, Ben Earl \u2026 fail to shine relentlessly and the trapdoor abruptly opens. A cynic might wonder if Jones now accepts England will not win the next election \u2013 sorry, World Cup \u2013 without another overhaul and is sure his job is safe even if this tour ends messily. That theory could yet be tested should the visitors lose the remaining two Tests by sizeable margins but, either way, the England captain, Courtney Lawes, will continue to argue there is little point from a longer-term perspective in England sticking to the status quo and sneaking the odd win here and there.  \u201cWe think it\u2019ll open up our potential and we\u2019ll be a better team for it,\u201d stressed Lawes. \u201cWe don\u2019t feel this is the right time to be safe. We want to see what we can do as a team, what players will fit best where and try and paint a picture for things moving forward as well. We\u2019re going to do everything we can to make sure we win the series. But at the same time we\u2019ve had the conversation. We\u2019re making these changes for a reason. It\u2019s going to take time and we are going to have to have patience. We\u2019re going to go through ups and downs. But as long as we\u2019re building towards an end product. That is the main thing.\u201d Lawes, about to win his 100th international cap this weekend, also insists Jones is increasingly allowing the players to take more ownership, as eventually happened during the 2019 World Cup campaign when England reached the final. \u201cIt was still driven heavily by Eddie but the players had a lot more say in what we did off the pitch. It shows what a difference it can make when you have a tight-knit team. I think that has helped Eddie see that if you are going to have something that lasts and is genuine it needs to be driven by the players. Otherwise it\u2019s essentially forced on you and you don\u2019t really have a say. You can continue that for a certain amount of time but eventually it catches up on you.\u201d  The ever-honest Lawes deserves a good deal of credit for sharing his squad\u2019s objectives so openly. There is a big difference, though, between injecting fresh blood into a winning side and pitching youngsters into a losing one. Van Poortvliet did not even make the bench for Leicester in last month\u2019s Premiership final; to boss around a seasoned Test pack, despite his debut try last week, is asking a lot of him. Lawes, though, insists the players are behind the continuing changes. \u201cWe\u2019re the ones that see the potential in it,\u201d he insists. \u201cIf we keep going down this track I wholeheartedly believe that our potential will be up there with the best teams in the world.\u201d But hold on a moment. Is he really, truly saying that a decent England performance in defeat in Brisbane will outweigh the series result? Yes, says Lawes. \u201cThe performance is more important for us. Definitely. Everybody wants to see results now and that\u2019s fine.  \u201cWe also understand everyone\u2019s got their opinion. That\u2019s fine. For us I would just say we\u2019re doing our best. We\u2019d absolutely love to win but developing as a team and taking us in the right direction is definitely at the forefront of our minds.\u201d The Wallabies, already 1-0 up and unbeaten in their last 10 Tests in Brisbane since 2016, must think Christmas has arrived early."

                    "body": "The waiting \u2013 like the talking, thankfully \u2013 is almost over. The buildup to the Rugby League World Cup has been dominated by negative headlines, ill-judged comments and endless controversies. But now, with a week to go until England kick off the men\u2019s tournament against Samoa in Newcastle, it feels as if we can finally focus on the rugby at long last.\nWorld Cup warm-ups do not necessarily act as a precursor for what will follow in the tournament. England slipped up on this very ground against Italy nine years ago, before going on to make the semi-finals. But on a wet, miserable night in Salford, this was a performance which will offer great encouragement for a showdown against a Samoa team that are being tipped to cause an upset in a game which will in effect decide who wins Group A.\n\nShaun Wane certainly has food for thought, not least after an eye-catching international debut from Dom Young. The Wakefield-born winger has been a sensation in the NRL with Newcastle, and after turning down Jamaica to feature for England, Young was subject to comments from the broadcaster Eddie Hemmings, who said he wasn\u2019t \u201cEnglish in the strict sense of the word\u201d. It led to a swift apology but Young certainly let his rugby do the talking here.\nHe marked his international debut with a try and had a hand in several others as England cantered to victory against Fiji, who have reached the semi-finals of the last three World Cups. Granted, this was not their strongest side, with several key players still making their way to England for the tournament. But as Wane said: \u201cThat was very impressive given the conditions. I thought we did really well. Some of the skill was very impressive.\u201d\nWane was not wrong. England led 28-0 at half-time and never looked back, with Young the star of the show in that first 40 minutes. He broke the deadlock with a well-taken try in the corner before turning provider to assist tries for George Williams and Kallum Watkins. That, combined with another debut try, this time for Salford\u2019s hooker Andy Ackers, who raced over from close-range, and one for Joe Batchelor, who seized upon an error from Isaac Lumelume, put England in control at the break.\n\nIt was a display which left the opposition\u2019s coach impressed, too. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get much right but England were very good,\u201d Brian McDermott, the former Leeds coach who is helping Fiji at this year\u2019s tournament, said. \u201cWe\u2019ll look at it but it was a disappointing performance from us.\u201d McDermott, as brutal as ever with his assessment, was right. Fiji did not handle the abysmal conditions quite as well as England, and the hosts took full advantage.\nYoung was not the only star on show here, but with Tommy Makinson and Ryan Hall his competition for a place in the side next Saturday at St James\u2019 Park, this was a decent statement from the 21-year-old. Has he done enough to force his way into the 17 for Samoa? \u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d Wane said. \u201cI was very impressed though. I\u2019ll have a look after a review but there\u2019s a good chance he\u2019ll be in.\u201d\nThe hours leading up to kick-off were dominated by controversy again, as the RFL confirmed their chief executive, Ralph Rimmer, would not face disciplinary action for disparaging comments made about the Fijians last week. But World Cup organisers will hope that is now firmly put to bed, and England did their part in helping shift the focus towards what should be a wonderful and unpredictable tournament.\n\nThey took their foot off the gas after half-time. But leading 28-0, and with a huge clash next week to look ahead to, that is perhaps understandable. Wane introduced a litany of interchanges from the bench and six minutes after the restart, Luke Thompson was next to score after grounding a well-weighted kick from Marc Sneyd, another who caught the eye on debut.\nThere were also further tries from Mike McMeeken, Mike Cooper and Hall in the final quarter as England shifted through the gears. There will be plenty of twists and turns in the weeks ahead but in terms of laying a marker down, this was about as satisfying a night\u2019s work as Wane could have hoped for.\nEngland Welsby; Young, Watkins, Farnworth, Hall; Williams, Sneyd; Hill, Ackers, Cooper, Whitehead, McMeeken, Radley Tries Young, Ackers, Watkins, Williams, Batchelor, Thompson, McMeeken, Cooper, Hall Goals Sneyd 7 Interchange Marshall, Powell, Thompson, Burgess, McIlorum, Batchelor, Smith, Wardle, Pearce-Paul\nFiji Naiqama; Qareqare, Ravalawa, Valemei, Vulikijapani; Moceidreke, Wakeham; Vuniyayawa, Tagiuima, Kamikamica, Miller, Seci, Liolevave Interchange Joseph Ratuvakacereivalu, Nakubuwai, Sadrugu, Masima, Wong, Lumelume, Taira"

                    "body": "Harry Kane is discussing his summer break, which will begin after England\u2019s Nations League tie against Hungary at Molineux on Tuesday night, and last for a little over three weeks. It is plainly not long enough.\nThe striker will make his 62nd appearance of the season for club and country against Hungary and, on 9 July, he will be on a flight to South Korea for Spurs\u2019s pre-season tour when, as an aside, he will be assailed by Son Heung-min mania.\n\nThe new season will resume with indecent haste \u2013 the Premier League kicks off on 5 August, a week earlier than last year \u2013 and it will be a relentless churn of weekend-midweek-weekend fixtures until the World Cup in Qatar, which starts on 21 November.\nWhat will Kane do with his precious three weeks off? How can he draw the maximum value from it? By getting away, first and foremost. \u201cI\u2019ll be abroad for the three weeks,\u201d he says. By kicking back with his wife and children and by keeping on top of his fitness in the gym, even if he does not think \u201cyou can lose too much in three weeks\u201d.\nOne other thing \u2013 golf. Kane will fit in a round whenever he can and he will also compete in the two-day Icons Series at the Liberty National club in New Jersey, which begins on 30 June. \u201cIt\u2019ll be good fun, playing under pressure in front of a crowd,\u201d Kane says, nonchalantly. At which point, it is fair to assume he is simply addicted to competing.\nKane describes it as a Ryder Cup-style showpiece, sports stars from the United States going up against a Rest of the World team. He runs through a couple of the players on his side: the Liverpool midfielder James Milner; the boxer Canelo \u00c1lvarez. Kane does not mention another teammate, the Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola. Imagine this had happened last summer \u2026\n\nIn contrast to back then, when Kane tried and failed to drive a move to City, he feels settled at Spurs, who have been revitalised under Antonio Conte and returned to the Champions League.\n\u201cFirst and foremost, I\u2019m looking forward to getting away [on holiday] but the plan is to get back [for pre-season] on 8 July and head to Korea with the boys,\u201d Kane says. \u201cI look forward to another season [at Spurs]. I got on really well with Antonio in the time he was there and I\u2019m looking forward to next season and what\u2019s to come.\u201d\nBack to golf. Kane name-checks a couple of the US team: the swimming legend Michael Phelps and the NFL Hall of Famer Michael Strahan, who he is friends with.\nKane plays off scratch and he said on the Friday before last that, when his football career was over, he would love to win the Green Jacket at the Masters. \u201cYou never know! I\u2019m doing all right,\u201d he adds now.\n\nWould Kane seriously consider becoming a professional golfer? \u201cThat\u2019s a long way away,\u201d he replies. \u201cYou never say never in anything. I\u2019m way off what the pros are at \u2013 I know that for sure. I\u2019m concentrating on football. Golf is a great hobby to have to get away from football \u2013 especially during the season. That\u2019s what I use it for at the moment.\u201d\nKane\u2019s juices are going because of Hungary, when England want to record a first win of the Nations League campaign. They opened with a loss to Hungary in Budapest on the Saturday before last before drawing with Germany in Munich and Italy at Molineux. A goal in open play is overdue. England\u2019s only reward so far has been Kane\u2019s penalty equaliser against Germany.\nThe performances have been mainly stilted and they have led to the usual frustrations, the criticism of the manager, Gareth Southgate; the progress under him overlooked. The goalscoring burden has come to rest heavily on Kane, with Southgate saying the load had to be spread more evenly away from the captain and Raheem Sterling. Not that Kane seems unduly flustered. By that or the three results so far.\n\u201cBeing an England player, you\u2019re always going to have criticism when maybe you don\u2019t win for a couple of games,\u201d Kane says. \u201cBut within this squad and the staff and manager, we have a bigger vision of where we want to go and, of course, the World Cup is the most important thing for us this year. It\u2019s been important to use these Nations League games to prepare for that.\u201d\n\nAll the while, Kane edges closer to the England goalscoring record. His penalty against Germany was his 50th \u2013 three short of Wayne Rooney\u2019s mark. Kane\u2019s mind goes back to the game in which Rooney overtook the previous record holder, Sir Bobby Charlton \u2013 the 2-0 Wembley win over Switzerland in 2015. Kane scored the first that night, on his fourth England appearance, before Rooney added a late penalty.\n\u201cI remember when he broke the record, how much it meant to him and even for me \u2013 being a part of it,\u201d Kane says. \u201cI kept my shirt from that day and I have it up in my house. Not for any reason but maybe looking at that every day gave me the motivation to one day try to achieve that.\u201d"

                    "body": "  10.10pm    That\u2019s all from me. I\u2019ll leave you with Jamie Jackson\u2019s match report from the Etihad \u2013 goodnight!      10.03pm    The matchwinner Nathan Ake speaks  I thought we deserved to win. We were better in the second half, but it was tough \u2013 they press very high and it was hard to play out. We had to use Erling more. [On the goal] It was a good pass from Jack and I think it\u2019s the first one I\u2019ve scored with my right foot, so I\u2019m pleased with that. There\u2019s still more to come from the team. Today was more about resilience; we stayed strong and made sure we didn\u2019t concede.      10.01pm    City love to win domestic cups under Pep Guardiola. Even at this early stage, there aren\u2019t too many teams left in the tournament for them to fear.  Mikel Arteta won\u2019t say as much in public, but I doubt he\u2019ll be too disappointed that Arsenal are out of the FA Cup. The Premier League is all that matters, and this probably increases their chance of winning it.      9.57pm   Full time: Man City 1-0 Arsenal  Peep peep! Nathan Ake\u2019s cool finish was enough for Manchester City to beat Arsenal in a disappointing match. It was a strange, subdued game, with few shots on target at either end, and it\u2019s fair to assume the league game at the Emirates in a couple of weeks will be far more intense. In fact, we may have just seen a bit of that intensity because it looked like Granit Xhaka and Erling Haaland were exchanging unpleasantries after the final whistle.     9.56pm    90+5 min Zinchenko, already booked, is late on Bernardo Silva and is a bit fortunate not to receive a yellow card. Zinchenko is furious, berating himself before play resumes.     9.52pm    90+2 min Zinchenko is booked for a foul on Kyle Walker.     9.51pm    90+1 min City pass the clock down some more.      9.50pm    90 min Four added minutes.     9.49pm    88 min Martinelli gets round the back again. His cross takes a couple of deflections before Ortega pounces theatrically on the ball, like a winger scoring a try, in the six-yard box.     9.48pm    87 min Xhaka slides a brilliant through pass towards Martinelli, and Ortega flies from his line to dive at Martinelli\u2019s feet and claim the ball. Fine goalkeeping, though ultimately it didn\u2019t matter as Martinelli was offside.     9.46pm    85 min Martinelli\u2019s inswinger is headed away well by Rodri. Vieira gives the ball back to Martinelli, who scurries into the six-yard box from the left and pokes a cutback that is pushed away at the near post by Ortega.     9.45pm    84 min A better spell for Arsenal, with Odegaard getting involved for the first time since coming on. Zinchenko\u2019s pass towards Martinelli is headed behind for a corner by Walker.     9.43pm    81 min Alvarez has another pop from distance. This one swirls down the throat of Turner, who makes a comfortable save.   Updated at 9.57pm GMT    9.42pm    79 min City are managing the game well now, and Arsenal are struggling to get hold of the ball.     9.38pm    76 min Vieira fouls Grealish, who gives him a mouthful in return. Arsenal had a really good spell straight after the goal but City have been much more comfortable since then.     9.36pm    75 min: City substitution Bernardo Silva replaces Kevin De Bruyne.     9.35pm    74 min: Arsenal substitution Martin Odegaard replaces Bukayo Saka, who had a quiet game. I guess Fabio Vieira will move to the right wing.     9.35pm    74 min \u201cI\u2019ve no dog in this fight and am enjoying the game,\u201d says Martin Logan, \u201cbut I\u2019d enjoy it so much more if Matterface would stop giving stats from 1856.\u201d I\u2019m not really in any position to criticise someone for harking back to the past.   Updated at 9.41pm GMT    9.34pm    73 min And here\u2019s the goal to which Jeff was referring.      9.33pm    73 min \u201cAke - not just a brilliant defender!\u201d says Jeff Sax. \u201cHope Nunez was watching.\u201d Number 82, Jeffrey, number 82.      9.33pm    72 min City calm things down with a couple of minutes of possession. Arsenal are about to bring on Martin Odegaard.     9.31pm    70 min \u201cIncidentally,\u201d says Harriet Osborn, \u201cthe last competitive goal Matt Turner shipped was also to a Dutch fullback.\u201d That World Cup already feels an age ago.      9.30pm    69 min Arsenal have responded really well to going behind, and at the moment they are pinning City back.     9.28pm    67 min: Great defending from Laporte! Xhaka, in the inside-left channel, curls a stunning cross towards Nketiah at the far post. He is shaping to shoot \u2013 and almost certainly score \u2013 when Laporte stretches to poke the ball behind for a corner. Fantastic defending.   Updated at 9.36pm GMT    9.27pm    66 min: Double substitution for Arsenal Oleksandr Zinchenko and Gabriel Martinelli replace Kieran Tierney and the impressive Leandro Trossard.     9.27pm    It all started when Alvarez turned, 25 yards from goal, and crashed a superb shot that beat Turner and hit the far post. Grealish collected the rebound, protected the ball for a few seconds and then reversed a clever pass to the supporting Ake, 12 yards out. Ake had to shoot first time, with Saliba coming to meet him, and he gently passed the ball into the far corner with his right foot. That was such a calm, precise finish.  Updated at 10.05pm GMT    9.25pm   GOAL! Man City 1-0 Arsenal (Ake 64)  All that attacking talent on the field, and Nathan Ake breaks the deadlock.   Updated at 9.28pm GMT    9.24pm    64 min Apparently Thomas Partey took a knock to the ribs in the first half, so I\u2019d imagine he was substitute as a precaution.      9.23pm    62 min Mikel Arteta will be thrilled with how comfortable Arsenal have been so far. It\u2019s not quite a reverse side, but it\u2019s not far off \u2013 at the moment they have four of their best XI on the field, and they have been the equal of City.     9.20pm    61 min City have changed shape slightly \u2013 Alvarez is playing behind Haaland, with De Bruyne to the right and Grealish on the left.     9.20pm    60 min \u201cIn their last game against Arsenal, City\u2019s only shot on target before their stoppage time winner was a penalty,\u201d says Zach Neeley. \u201cThey have zero so far today. If Arsenal are heading toward another moral victory, I hope it\u2019s to get it out of their system, because after today those won\u2019t be good enough.\u201d     9.20pm    59 min A long ball forward is headed up in the air by Nketiah on the edge of the area. It drops for Vieira, who swishes a volley wide of the far post. He had the time to take a touch there.     9.18pm    58 min: Double substitution for City Kyle Walker and Julian Alvarez replace Rico Lewis and Riyad Mahrez.     9.17pm    55 min Turner is okay to continue and makes an important save from De Bruyne\u2019s sliderule cross. Haaland was waiting behind him to score.  City are starting to look better in attack.     9.14pm    54 min The Arsenal goalkeeper Matt Turner has hurt his left shoulder and is receiving treatment.   Updated at 9.21pm GMT    9.13pm    52 min Mahrez clips a nice pass into Lewis, running into space on the right side of the area. He tries to hook the ball across goal from a tight angle but screws it into the side netting.     9.12pm    51 min City break promisingly. De Bruyne plays a through pass to Haaland, who is sandwiched by Tomiyasu and Saliba in the area. He sends Tomiyasu flying with a shoulder charge but Saliba clears the danger.     9.10pm    50 min \u201cI really ought to have known that Richard Rodgers wrote the music to both Blue Moon and You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone, which got me thinking if other clubs might use some of his melodies too,\u201d says Gary Naylor. \u201cSo far, I\u2019ve only got Sean Dyche being asked about how many signings he needs before Monday night and replying, \u2018Sixteen Going On Seventeen.\u2019\u201d      9.09pm    49 min The second half has started as the first finished, and that\u2019s not a compliment. The atmosphere is so flat.     9.06pm    47 min \u201cI saw REM circa 86-87 in a gymnasium at the University of British Columbia,\u201d says Allan Castle. \u201cIf I recall rightly the opening act was Guadalcanal Diary. Anyway, good show but my principal memory was Michael Stipe going on a several minute between-song diatribe about human rights in Central America. \u201cWhen he finished there was some scattered clapping, then silence, followed by the longhair guy standing next to me on the floor shouting \u2018ROCK AND ROLL!\u2019 - a command rather than a comment. Welcome to BC.\u201d   Updated at 9.15pm GMT    9.05pm    46 min Peep peep! Erling Haaland gets the second half under way.     9.05pm    Mikel Arteta has made two half-time changes Albert Sambi Lokonga and William Saliba are on for Thomas Partey and Rob Holding. No word yet on whether Partey has an injury.     8.53pm    Sign up to Football Daily!    Updated at 9.03pm GMT    8.51pm   Half time: Man City 0-0 Arsenal  That\u2019s the end of a first half that was bizarrely sleepy at times, particularly when City had the ball. I\u2019m struggling to make sense of it all.  A much changed Arsenal had the better chances, with Stefan Ortega saving well from the lively Leandro Trossard and Eddie Nketiah volleying wide. Kevin De Bruyne almost scored a peach for City, but there was no rhythm in their play and Erling Haaland spent most of the half having a wrestling match with Rob Holding.     8.48pm    45+4 min Actually, Laporte has only just come onto the field, as he wasn\u2019t ready when Stones limped off.     8.47pm    45+3 min: City substitution Aymeric Laporte replaces the luckless John Stones.   Updated at 8.48pm GMT    8.46pm    45+2 min \u201cThese are the best two teams in England, Rob?\u201d sniffs Simon McMahon. \u201cI\u2019ve switched over to Cove Rangers v Ayr United on the BBC Scotland channel. Still following the MBM of course, whilst listening to Document.\u201d   Updated at 8.53pm GMT    8.46pm    45+1 min Two minutes of added time. John Stones is down with what looks like a hamstring problem. That\u2019s a bad blow for City \u2013 they have a lot of centre-halves but he has arguably been the best in the past 18 months.   Updated at 8.55pm GMT    8.45pm    45 min \u201cMan City,\u201d says Jeff Sax, \u201care playing like Pep\u2019s pre-game interview.\u201d They\u2019re just not right at the moment, are they?     8.44pm    43 min \u201cThat\u2019s a wonderful photo of a sweaty Hulk Holding in close combat with Haaland Macho Man Savage,\u201d says Peter Oh. \u201cHave you got one of Rowdy Rodri Piper?\u201d Hulk Holding is a keeper.     8.42pm    42 min Holding is booked for his 48th shirt pull on Haaland, who was breaking into space.     8.41pm    39 min Ortega gets away with a nervous bit of goalkeeping. He came to the edge of his area to meet a strange backpass from Mahrez, booted the ball against Stones and then took out Nketiah in his follow through.      8.40pm    38 min: Chance for Haaland! Tierney, in the centre circle, slices a clearance towards his own goal. The last man Gabriel has a few yards on Haaland, who shows frightening speed to get to the ball first on the edge of the area. He lobs it over Turner and a few yards wide of the right-hand post. Having got to the ball, he probably should have done better.   Updated at 8.46pm GMT    8.37pm    37 min \u201cBased upon your MBM so far (to watch this match in the US requires a $100/year subscription, sorry World\u2019s Grandest Domestic Cup but it isn\u2019t worth it!),\u201d begins Alex Whitney, \u201cis it fair to say there\u2019s a significant degree of nominative determinism applying to the behaviours of Arsenal\u2019s fourth-choice centre back?\u201d Heh, indeed, although I should stress it\u2019s been a 50/50 wrestling match.     8.35pm    36 min Grealish swaggers infield, away from Tomiyasu, but his through pass towards Haaland is well read by Holding.      8.34pm    34 min \u201cGreeting Rob from sunny, soggy northern California,\u201d says Mary Waltz. \u201cI saw REM at the Forum in LA on the Green Tour. Outstanding performance, they put on a show that filled the entire arena. The exact opposite of the Everton dumpster fire. Nothing in the transfer window so far allays my fear of relegation, Dyche is a nice guy but his hiring is a bit of a damp squib. Sigh.\u201d I know it\u2019s not as exciting as Bielsa but I think he\u2019s a perfect fit. And if he can\u2019t sort out the mess, you really are in trouble.     8.33pm    33 min: Chance for Nketiah! Arsenal are the better team at the moment. Trossard surges down the left and arrows a cross to the near post, where Nketiah gets across Akanji but volleys wide from six yards. It came quickly and a slightly awkward height, but he\u2019s good enough to take chances like that.   Updated at 8.45pm GMT    8.32pm    32 min \u201cI\u2019m old enough to remember the origins of the phrase \u2018What\u2019s The Frequency, Kenneth?\u2019 dating back to 1986,\u201d writes James. \u201cWondering if anyone else does...\u201d Crikey, I\u2019d never heard that before. Who knew? You, obviously.     8.31pm    31 min Haaland has passed a concussion test and is going to continue.     8.30pm    30 min Now Haaland is down holding the back of his head, which was introduced to one of the bonier bits of Rob Holding\u2019s right arm. I suspect he\u2019d have been booked had the referee seen it.   Updated at 8.37pm GMT    8.28pm    29 min \u201cThe best soundtrack for a sporting event is cranking up The Who\u2019s \u2018I Can See for Miles\u2019 when the first downhill skier leaves the start house at the Kitzbuhel Hahnenkahm,\u201d writes Bob Best. \u201cHe\u2019s exceeding 100 kph within a few seconds and hanging on for dear life. Breath-taking and head-banging at the same time.\u201d AND THAT\u2019S NOT HEALTHY, IS IT.     8.28pm    28 min Holding and Haaland have spent most of the first half re-enacting WrestleMania IV. So far, Holding is winning.   Updated at 8.35pm GMT    8.27pm    27 min After a cautious start, the game is starting to liven up a peedie bit.     8.25pm    25 min: Just wide from De Bruyne! That\u2019s more like it from City. De Bruyne cuts inside from the right, 25 yards from goal, and shapes a delicious left-footed curler that flashes just wide of the far post. Turner wouldn\u2019t have saved it.     8.22pm    23 min \u201cCompletely different mood, but here\u2019s my favourite version of Blue Moon, by Canadian band Cowboy Junkies,\u201d says Liz White. \u201cThey also do an extremely moody cover of Sweet Jane.\u201d      8.22pm    21 min: Very good save from Ortega! Saka and Vieira moved the ball smoothly across the field to leave Trossard one on one with Lewis on the left side of the area. He beat Lewis with a pretty simple stepover and blasted a left-footed shot across goal that was beaten away by the flying Ortega. That\u2019s a much better save than the first one.     8.20pm    20 min \u201cI sometimes watch Everton with the sound down if I don\u2019t want to hear commentary about how turgid and unimaginative their play is,\u201d says Matt Burtz. \u201cLet\u2019s just say I\u2019ve been doing that a lot this season.\u201d The volume button on your TV hasn\u2019t worked since 2017 and we all know it.     8.19pm    19 min Wake me up when something happens. City are just passing the ball around in their own half, it\u2019s a bit strange.     8.18pm    18 min \u201cListening to What\u2019s the Frequency, Kenneth? earlier got me listening to a few other tracks on Monster,\u201d says Charlie Robinson. \u201cIf I remember correctly, it was a bit of a damp squib and is now half-forgotten, coming as it did after Automatic for the People and Out of Time, but there are some bangers on there, not least, er, Bang and Blame. \u201cI was 17 years old and worked in the music department at our local WH Smiths at the time, and we got loads of promotional material for the release of the album, and I was very happy to walk away with a 5 foot tall and extremely heavy cardboard cut-out of the monster\u2019s head from the front cover, which I somehow managed to drag home and attach to my bedroom wall! However, I do believe, if I may say, that the greatest forgotten and underrated REM album is New Adventures in Hi-Fi.\u201d  I suppose Monster was the beginning of the \u2018return to form\u2019 years, though I agree with you \u2013 I listen to it in its entirety much more than any of their other post-Automatic for the People albums. But I shall give New Adventures in Hi-Fi a fresh shake.     8.17pm    17 min City are dominating the ball but the tempo of their play is very slow.  Updated at 8.17pm GMT    8.14pm    14 min Xhaka\u2019s free-kick is only half cleared by the backpedalling Rodri. Partey keeps the ball alive and Saka hits a snap-shot from 15 yards that is blocked.     8.11pm    12 min \u201cA few weeks back, I had the 3pm Liverpool kick-off on and the snooker on the telly, with the sound down,\u201d says Gillian Kirby. \u201cIs that any better? Of course, I still harbour dreams of Micah Richards and/or Roy Keane getting to commentate on a tense Selby vs Lisowski fixture one day.\u201d What is wrong with you people?     8.10pm    9 min: Chance for City! Akanji\u2019s slow pass forward is missed by Holding, which allows Haaland to run through on goal. Turner charges out his area to slide tackle Haaland, with the ball bouncing up in the air. Haaland improvises an overhead kick from about 30 yards \u2013 it\u2019s on target but Tomiyasu has plenty of time to get back and clear the danger. Holding thought he was fouled by Haaland; either way, it wasn\u2019t great defending.   Updated at 8.15pm GMT    8.08pm    8 min The tempo of the game has been surprisingly slow, particularly with City in possession.      8.08pm    7 min \u201cBlue Moon is a song nearly impossible to muck up, the best club anthem,\u201d writes K\u00e1ri Tulinius. \u201cBut the pop-punk version they play before kickoff now must have Rodgers and Hart spinning in their graves. I\u2019m not very prone to nostalgia, but club anthems should be sung by the fans in the stadium.\u201d  They should mix it up and play the Kendal Johansson version from time to time. It might not set an appropriate pre-match mood, I\u2019ll give you that, but by jove it\u2019s beautiful.      8.05pm    5 min: Good save from Ortega! Arsenal have started really confidently. Trossard runs at the backpedalling Stones and clips a cross towards Tomiyasu, running onto the ball at the edge of the area. He hammers a shot towards goal and Ortega dives to his right to push it away.   Updated at 8.13pm GMT    8.04pm    4 min I haven\u2019t a clue what formation City are playing. It looks like 3-2-2-3 with the ball, 4-2-1-3 without it. I\u2019m out of my element, I can\u2019t lie to you.     8.03pm    3 min A dodgy pass from Turner is nicked by Gundogan, 35 yards from goal. After a few quick passes from Haaland and De Bruyne, Rodri shoots high over the bar from distance.     8.02pm    2 min Haaland goes over on the edge of the Arsenal area after a wrestling match with Holding. The referee gives a foul\u2026 to Arsenal. They both had a piece of each other\u2019s shirt, though the City players were fuming with the decision.   Updated at 8.12pm GMT    8.00pm    1 min Peep peep!     8.00pm    \u201cAs an Arsenal fan, I have relatively fresh memories of Arsenal leading the table for biggest part of the season only to drop off to third or fourth place in the crunching months of February and March,\u201d says Admir Pajic. \u201cThis season bears a lot of comparisons with 2007-08 when Arsenal were five and eight points clear ahead of Man U and Chelsea respectively after Game 26 only to finish third. Mind you, not even \u2018let\u2019s throw away the FA Cup thing and focus on winning the league\u2019 strategy worked well as we got trounced 4-0 at Old Trafford for, as it turned out, nothing.\u201d Funnily enough they just mentioned that on ITV. But I\u2019d argue that the Eduardo game was the turning point of that season, and it\u2019s very hard to foresee or prepare for something like that. But from memory that Birmingham draw was the first of four in a row which really undermined their season. How this Arsenal team deal with their first blip \u2013 if they have one \u2013 will be so important.      7.59pm    The players are ready, the managers have just had a businesslike embrace on the sideline. Let\u2019s crack on.     7.56pm    \u201cI have been in the \u2018mute the telecast listen to music\u2019 school for decades!\u201d says Joe Pearson. \u201cStarting early today with Soul Coughing\u2019s utterly bizarre \u2018Ruby Vroom\u2019. Rock on!\u201d I love music but I can\u2019t be having this. It\u2019s the football-watching equivalent of a deep-fried Mars bar.     7.52pm    \u201cITV has just shown Pep giving a masterclass of top-flight burlesque in the pre-match interview,\u201d says Charles Antaki. \u201cTwo parts mumbling Marlon Brando, one part Norman Wisdom gurning, and the most enthusiastic part stereotyped Continental shrugging, pouting, and headshaking. All in the excellent service of saying absolutely nothing.\u201d     7.50pm    And so does Pep  It\u2019s a good night for, I hope, a great football game. [What do you think about the Arsenal selection?] I don\u2019t know, ask Mikel. It\u2019s his decision. [A few more attempts to get Pep to talk about the Arsenal XI, which he ignores] It\u2019s still a strong team, it\u2019s Arsenal. They control all departments [of the game] \u2013 set pieces, high pressing, defend deep. To do what they have done you have to be a really good side.  He really can\u2019t abide pre-match interviews, can he.   Updated at 7.51pm GMT    7.46pm    Mikel Arteta speaks  It\u2019s a big opportunity. We\u2019re playing against a top, top side and we have to prove that we have the level to compete and win the game. [What\u2019s the thinking behind six changes?] That everybody needs game time, that they deserve game time the way they train every day.  [Why not play your best XI to see how they match up against City?] For different reasons, and because they were struggling after the Man Utd game. And the other players fully deserve to play. We still think we have a very competitive team. We\u2019ll have to be at our best level to beat City today. [Will you have a drink with Pep afterwards?] For sure.      7.42pm    \u201cMaybe it is just me,\u201d writes Scott, \u201cbut a fight between Pep and Arteta would be the highlight of the day.\u201d Yeah, that\u2019s the kind of thing nobody likes to see.     7.40pm         7.36pm    \u201cThe recent lauding of Martin \u00d8degaard \u2013 quite proper and fully deserved, of course, as any Arsenal fan will tell you \u2013 makes this an almost impossible gig for Fabio Vieira,\u201d says Charles Antaki. \u201cYes, he has shown the odd twinkle and the occasional bit of niftiness, but not anything like the sustained brilliance of \u00d8degaard. You hope, at least for his sake, that he has a half-decent game, and that Arsenal win; otherwise, the question marks.\u201d Evening Roy.     7.36pm    \u201cLooking forward to the match,\u201d says Shane OLeary. I\u2019ll have a sound-off telly, your commentary and the two underrated and transitional albums for Bolan and for Bowie in the headphones. (\u2018Zinc Alloy &amp; The Hidden Riders Of Tomorrow - A Creamed Cage In August\u2019 and \u2018Diamond Dogs\u2019). A good fit because City &amp; Arsenal seem to be in transition at the moment and I\u2019m hoping that Arsenal continue their development and that City continue to flail violently and elegantly against their loss of certainty.\u201d I\u2019m all for novel ways to watch football, but listening to albums while watching the TV and reading commentary on the internet? I\u2019d have a blinding headache by the end of Explosive Mouth.     7.29pm         7.29pm    \u201cI found myself watching the video of REM\u2019s 1994 rocker \u2018What\u2019s the Frequency, Kenneth?\u2019 recently,\u201d says Peter Oh. \u201cWhen frontman Michael Stipe starts throwing shapes it instantly reminded me of the way Pep Guardiola moves when he prowls the touchline. That unmistakably angular, passionate, gangly, animated, contorted body language that only a rock star could pull off. The choreographers at the Etihad really should put a mic stand in the home technical area.\u201d  And somebody needs to do a Venn diagram with Michael Stipe in one circle and David Brent in the other.      7.23pm         7.23pm    \u201cAs far as protecting the most important players,\u201d says Zach Neeley, \u201cglad to see Odegaard get a break but I would love to see Saka rested because he works so damn hard, and Partey because Arsenal are doomed without him.\u201d I think it\u2019s quite a smart selection by Arteta. If Arsenal are hammered, he can rationalise it \u2013 six changes \u2013 and crack on with trying to win the league; and if they win away to a near full-strength City with this XI, it\u2019ll be quite a statement. The worst-case scenario for Arteta, and the one that might have had a negative impact on their title challenge, was a full-strength Arsenal losing to a weakened City.     7.09pm   Team news: two changes for City, six for Arsenal  Pep Guardiola has picked a very strong City side, with only two changes from the team that beat Wolves last weekend. Stefan Ortega replaces Ederson in goal; Nathan Ake comes into the defence in place of Aymeric Laporte. We don\u2019t yet know whether City will play 4-1-2-3 or Pep\u2019s new favourite formation, 3-2-2-3. Mikel Arteta has picked more of a hybrid Arsenal side, with six changes from the rousing win over Manchester United. Matt Turner, Takehiro Tomiyasu, Rob Holding, Kieran Tierney, Fabio Vieira and Leandro Trossard \u2013 making his full debut \u2013 replace Aaron Ramsdale, Ben White, William Saliba, Oleksandr Zinchenko, Martin Odegaard and Gabriel Martinelli. All six are on the bench, as is Arsenal\u2019s other new signing Jakob Kiwior. Manchester City (possible 4-1-2-3) Ortega; Lewis, Stones, Akanji, Ake; Rodri; De Bruyne, Gundogan; Mahrez, Haaland, Grealish.Substitutes: Ederson, Walker, Dias, Phillips, Cancelo, Laporte, Alvarez, Bernardo, Palmer. Arsenal (4-1-2-3) Turner; Tomiyasu, Holding, Gabriel, Tierney; Partey; Vieira, Xhaka; Saka, Nketiah, Trossard.Substitutes: Ramsdale, White, Zinchenko, Saliba, Kiwior, Lokonga, Odegaard, Marquinhos, Martinelli. Referee Paul Tierney.     6.30pm   Preamble  To coin a phrase, 391 days is a long time in football. When Manchester City last met Arsenal, pilfering a 2-1 win at the Emirates on New Year\u2019s Day 2022, the landscape of English football was exceedingly different. Manchester City were the runaway leaders and Arsenal were brawling, ultimately in vain, for fourth place. Thirteen months is a long time for two big teams to go without playing each other. In that period, and particularly since Arsenal\u2019s flying start to the season, anticipation has grown for the next meeting between City and the emerging Mini-City. It should have happened in the Premier League on 19 October, but that game was postponed for reasons too boring to explain when you can just use a hyperlink like this to do the job. The upshot is that City and Arsenal will meet at least three times in the next three months \u2013 tonight\u2019s FA Cup fourth round tie, then a league game at the Emirates on 15 February and another (save the date because it could be all kinds of epic) at the Etihad on 26 April. There will also be a cup replay if they draw tonight. The league games are the big ones, and it\u2019s hard to know just what tonight\u2019s game is all about. Is it a chance to make a statement in the title race? A cracking FA Cup tie in its own right? A test of squad depth? A test of Pep Guardiola and Mikel Arteta\u2019s friendship? An inconvenience that it might be beneficial to lose, especially for Arsenal? The start of English football\u2019s new favourite rivalry? One thing we can all agree on: with a respectful nod to Brighton v Liverpool, this is emphatically the tie of the round. Kick off 8pm.  Updated at 6.59pm GMT "

                    "body": "Welcome to The Breakdown, the Guardian\u2019s weekly (and free) rugby union newsletter. Here\u2019s an extract from this week\u2019s edition. To receive the full version every Tuesday, just pop your email in below:  This was meant to be the week when English rugby union shifted the narrative. For all involved \u2013 players, coaches, even the media \u2013 the upcoming tour of Australia has been shimmering on the horizon like an oasis in the outback, offering a chance to look forward rather than endlessly back. It was also a prime opportunity to select a few fresh players with one eye on the Rugby World Cup next year. Then what happens? On the eve of the squad announcement an England XV go down like a sack of misshapen spuds against a 14-man Barbarians side. And Eddie Jones reverts to three former stalwarts whom he has been studiously ignoring for ages. Congratulations to Billy and Mako Vunipola and Danny Care but what do their blast-from-the-past recalls say about the consistency of England\u2019s recent selectorial thinking? Of course there are short-term imperatives, with Alex Dombrandt damaging a knee on Friday, Joe Marler omitted and Ben Youngs rested. Maybe the return of the Vunipolas and Care is the smart way ahead, even though they will collectively be 98 by the time the World Cup kicks off. But, if so, the logic in none of them playing a solitary England Test in the past 15 months is mighty hard to discern.  There is an argument that all three should never have been jettisoned in the first place, with Care having been cast out as long ago as November 2018. Age is only a number if people are performing well enough. But yet again the messaging is mixed. It also does not say much for Jones\u2019s faith in those overlooked in favour of his redeployed Dad\u2019s Army platoon. The most obvious conclusion is that the Barbarians effort was so grim from Jones\u2019s perspective he felt he had no other option. To place it into perspective, the Barbarians had enjoyed such a social buildup week that Amazon Prime\u2019s pitchside pundits even noted on air that the perspiring man of the match, George Kruis, \u201csmelt of Moscow Mules\u201d. Losing against a talented French-dominated side is one thing but getting pumped by more than 50 points in an England jersey by a team who had been in the pub for much of the week is properly embarrassing. The erstwhile England captain Dylan Hartley did not hold back, suggesting England were \u201coutclassed in every facet\u201d of a game that showed some players \u201care not at the standard that\u2019s needed\u201d. As the game wore on, Bryan Habana asked who England\u2019s defence coach was. Give or take Marcus Smith\u2019s skillset, Tommy Freeman\u2019s obvious promise, one burst from Joe Cokanasiga and a couple of flashes from Jack Nowell and Jonny May, there was very little to write home about. Most worrying of all was the collective lack of cohesion. Before anyone goes on about the inbuilt Barbarians advantage of a carefree buildup and playing with smiles on faces, last week England posted social media footage of training-field larks and lighthearted team bonding. The visible difference between the sides on game day was not simply down to that.  It seems to have cost Mark Atkinson, Will Collier, Callum Chick, Will Goodrick-Clarke and Jack Singleton any chance they had of tour selection, while Alfie Barbeary, Ted Hill, Alex Mitchell, Dan Robson and the Newcastle trio of Adam Radwan, Jamie Blamire and George McGuigan have all trained with England in recent weeks only to be ultimately passed over. There is no sign of the Premiership\u2019s player of the year, Ben Earl, nor his Saracens teammates Elliot Daly and Max Malins. George Ford is injured and so is Kyle Sinckler. A few others have had long, draining seasons. And Jones is even refusing to say who he has picked as captain. Which runs the risk of everyone else concluding that either there is no standout candidate or someone is carrying an injury. On the flip side 12 representatives of the Premiership finalists last Saturday, Leicester and Saracens, are on board and there are welcome returns for previously limping Lions Jonny Hill, Jack Nowell and Luke Cowan-Dickie. In the absence of the injured Manu Tuilagi and Henry Slade there will be chances for the uncapped Guy Porter and Fraser Dingwall to bring some midfield solidity and young Jack van Poortvliet is definitely a No 9 going places. Freeman is another exciting prospect and Cokanasiga deserves a change in fortunes. But the reality is that Jones is still searching for a physically dominant Test-quality centre not named Manu and still seems uncertain about his best options at scrum-half and in the front five. There would also be fewer post-Barbarians alarm bells ringing had England finished the Six Nations with a flourish. Or if Australia were not showing some signs of a revival.  If England, consequently, go down under and are comprehensively beaten, the cat really will be back among the antipodean pigeons. Jones can hardly dump another whole set of assistants or blame the media reporting or the lingering effects of the Lions tour. It will simply be down to him and his selected team, with the southern hemisphere\u2019s big three all due at Twickenham in the autumn. This tour squad is certainly not embarking with the smooth momentum they would have liked. Far worse sides have preceded them and they will not lose 76-0 against the Wallabies next month as happened on the 1998 \u201cTour of Hell\u201d. But of all the places in all the world where a stuttering Jones-led England will find precious little sympathy it is in his own great southern land. Never mind the 2023 World Cup, the next few weeks are increasingly pivotal for all concerned."

Looking to the 15-a-side World Cups, its chief executive, Owen Scannell, said PR7s could help grow \u201cthe domestic audience as well as the path to the professional tiers, especially in the women\u2019s game\u201d.\nBaker echoed Tapper, saying the World Cups must be used to help more young Americans find the sport, as he did in Florida with the Daytona Beach Coconuts, but also to provide a clearer path to the top.\n\u201cRemember the Olympics is going to be here in 2028,\u201d Baker said, pointing to Los Angeles, where sevens will be played. \u201cSo the sky\u2019s the limit, really.\u201d\nAmerican rugby lovers, alas, know limits all too well. From high school to college, from the amateurs to the pros of Major League Rugby, clubs grapple with poor facilities and finance, with harsh winters which split the season in two, and with travel demands which challenge even the most dedicated team.\nTapper said the game needed to get into middle schools, to kids aged 11 to 13. Others said elementary schools were the prize.\nBlaine Scully, a former Eagles wing and captain who played in the UK for Leicester and Cardiff, said US rugby needed \u201ca pathway for all involved. When 2031-33 comes to pass, the 10-year-old American girl who sees the game for the first time, who falls in love with the sport, can join a team [and] become a player, coach, referee or fan for the rest of her life.\u201d\nBob Kimmitt has enjoyed a long life in rugby \u2013 and in business and government. He played at West Point in the 1960s, the years when the sport took a tenuous hold, and helped establish the Washington Irish club. He also became an undersecretary at the US treasury, an ambassador to Germany and an independent director at Meta, formerly known as Facebook.\nPredicting increased attention from such big business, Kimmitt said the World Cup award \u201cshows how that rebirth, rejuvenation of rugby over the past 50 years has come to full fruition at the club level, the college level and importantly now at the professional level. And my hope is that [the World Cups have] the same effect on rugby in the United States that hosting the World Cup in 1994 had on US soccer.\u201d\nDan Lyle, another former Eagles captain, played No8 in England for Bath and Leicester. He is now a director at AEG, a sports and entertainment giant.\nHe said: \u201c\u2018Football has no legacy in America\u2019. \u2018The US has no history with the sport\u2019. Those were the claims of some Fifa executives and reporters who backed Morocco or Brazil for the 1994 World Cup. [In 1988] it went to the US anyway and the result was a World Cup that drew 3.5 million fans at more than 68,900 per match over 52 games, a record that stands today. We are on the cusp of the \u20181988 moment\u2019 for rugby.\n\u201cWhy will the US rise? Simply, it is \u2026 about the sheer desire, backed by the natural resources of diversity, gender equality, respect, athleticism and inclusiveness America has in abundance.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the vision part. The hard work, Lyle said, will demand engagement with \u201cthe American sports complex of after-school programmes, scholastic, collegiate and professional leagues, ownership, public/private enterprise and more\u201d, so \u201cmoms, dads, parks &amp; rec departments, athletic directors, broadcasters, brand managers and stadium GMs, along with hundreds of thousands of boys and girls, come to know rugby not just in passing but permanently\u201d.\n\u2018We can compete fiercely and respectfully\u2019\nJoe Biden, a rugby fan, backed the US bid. The Guardian was not able to speak to the president but it did find supportive voices in Washington.\nOne co-chair of the Congressional Rugby Caucus, the Washington DC House Democrat Eleanor Holmes Norton, said: \u201cRugby has made a difference to the youth of the District of Columbia and across the country in terms of health, self-esteem, teamwork and social skills.\u201d\nFrom the other side of the Capitol, the Connecticut senator Chris Murphy said: \u201cI was first introduced to rugby at Williams [College], and although I wasn\u2019t very good, I loved the sport and made lifelong friends.\u201d\n\nMurphy and Holmes Norton both said they were excited the World Cups were coming. HR McMaster also welcomed the news. The retired general who was Donald Trump\u2019s second national security adviser is known for his love of the game.\nCalling rugby \u201cthe best contact team sport in the world \u2026 more exciting and safer than American football\u201d, McMaster said: \u201cAs Americans learn about rugby I also hope that the sport will inform our political and social discourse.\n\u201cWe can compete fiercely and respectfully. We all have our roles and there is no limit to what we can achieve if we work together as a team. And maybe even ESPN will broadcast more rugby instead of darts, cornhole and poker.\u201d\nStranger things have happened.\nCovid did nobody any favours but US national teams have recently struggled more than most, the men shipping 104 points to the All Blacks, the women 89 to England. The women will expect to do better at the World Cup in New Zealand this year but the men have not yet qualified for France \u201923. To avoid last-chance play-offs, they must beat Chile this summer.\nNick Civetta, an Eagles second-row forward from Scarsdale, New York who has played for Newcastle, Doncaster and Oxford University, said: \u201cOur goal is firmly focused on qualification this summer, which will be no small task.\u201d\nHe also said: \u201cThe opportunity for investment into all levels of the sport that could come alongside a World Cup certainly astounds the typical American rugby player, who is habituated to the reality that rugby has never been a \u2018monied\u2019 sport.\u201d\nMajor League Rugby, the competition in which Civetta plays for New York, is in its fifth season. Its salaries are not large and it does not have a big presence in mainstream media. Matt McCarthy covers it via his Rugby Wrap Up site and podcast. He said World Rugby\u2019s \u201chuge, game-changing investment in high schools, colleges, clubs, for men and women, sevens and 15s\u201d would also \u201csafeguard the future of Major League Rugby as a fully professional men\u2019s 15s competition.\n\u201cThe establishment of the pro league in Japan in the years before the 2019 World Cup shows what World Rugby knows must happen. Now the World Cups are coming to America, MLR simply cannot be allowed to fail.\u201d\nGeorge Killebrew would not argue with that. He\u2019s the MLR commissioner, working out of Texas.\nHe said: \u201cIf you remember, back [before the 1994 World Cup] it was more of, \u2018If we bring the game to the US, a professional league will be born,\u2019 which is what occurred with Major League Soccer. Ours is the exact opposite. If we are able to add a team or two a year over the next nine years, we\u2019ll be a 28-team league in all the major markets in this country and in Canada by the time the game arrives.\n\u201cIf you look at the US as measured by Nielsen, we are in seven of the largest 10 markets and all of our teams run camps and clinics, they have academy programs, they have relationships with colleges in those cities. So I think we\u2019re well poised to be one of the contributors to the rise of rugby in North America.\u201d\n\nThe New England Free Jacks have the best record in MLR this year. Their chief executive is Alex Magleby, a former Eagles flanker.\n\u201cLots of work has been done to get to this stage,\u201d he said, \u201cin silos at times, perhaps. Now we can all get behind this momentum, with a fixed timeline for success.\u201d\n\u2018The stars of 2031 and 2033 have never touched a ball\u2019\nIn Dublin, Alan Gilpin, chief executive of World Rugby, said significant investment was coming. Half-a-billion dollars has been floated before. At the announcement, Victoria Folayan, a US sevens player turned USA Rugby board member, said the women\u2019s game would have equal access to all such funds.\nIn August 2020, USA Rugby exited bankruptcy. McCarthy said: \u201cThe big concern is that any and all funding is appropriated with strict purpose and accuracy. We have an abysmal record in doing those things to date in America.\u201d\nOthers had similar concerns. Lara Vivolo, once an Eagles prop, now coach to women\u2019s teams including New York Rugby Club and Greenwich High School, said: \u201cAs a PE teacher, I teach roughly 400 students a year. There have to be resources, equipment and trainers who can push into elementary schools and teach PE teachers about the sport.\u201d\nThe former Eagles fly-half Matt Sherman is head coach of Army West Point, the men\u2019s national collegiate champions. He said the World Cups presented \u201ca tremendous opportunity and a tremendous challenge. I think the challenge is to grow rugby appropriately, so it can be presented well, and then really accelerate. But I think if we don\u2019t do the work, building up to the World Cups, it will not make the impact it\u2019s capable of.\n\u201cIf we invest heavily in youth and high-school growth, and we create a proper fanbase that supports a great event, I think we will get more attention from college athletics. administrators seeing the value in the sport and wanting to invest more in it.\u201d\n\nSherman\u2019s Army team is well funded. Others, less so.\nCarille Guthrie, a former college player, is president of the James G Robertson &amp; Clive Sullivan Rugby Foundation, a nonprofit aiming to increase participation among Black and indigenous Americans and other people of colour.\nShe said: \u201cThe rugby community has toted rugby as the fastest growing sport in the US. But for many of us working at the grassroots level, that growth feels lethargic, stymied and one-sided. Finding funding, sponsorship and support for teams outside of the insular rugby community is frustrating, arduous and at times soul-crushing.\n\n\u201cIt is my hope that the support of the Rugby World Cup reverberates to less visible rugby communities, like inner-city youth teams and rugby at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).\n\u201cIt\u2019s highly likely that the stars of the Eagles\u2019 2031 and 2033 World Cup teams have never touched a ball before today. I look forward to seeing USA Rugby actively foster youth rugby by funding grassroots efforts, providing accessible camps and trainings and engaging with diverse rugby communities.\u201d\nKatherine Aversano, women\u2019s coach at Howard University, a HBCU in Washington DC, echoed Guthrie\u2019s concerns.\nShe said: \u201cThe lead-up to the RWC \u201931 and \u201933 will be the biggest test of the US rugby community\u2019s ability to come together and expand the game to people who have traditionally been excluded. If we do this correctly, all of the grassroots efforts \u2026 will thrive.\n\u201cWho we are as American rugby depends on the participation of everyone.\u201d"

                    "body": "Australia and India finished off their T20 World Cup preparations in a warm-up match at an empty Gabba ground in Brisbane, won by India by six runs in a contest that lacked much intensity until the frantic final stages. Australia looked set to win when Aaron Finch was chasing India\u2019s 186-7, needing 16 runs required from 12 balls. But the captain\u2019s dismissal for 76 presaged a passage of play that saw Australian wickets fall from each of the final four balls of the match, Australia finishing all out for 180. The World Cup hosts won the toss and chose to bowl, picking Mitchell Starc and Patrick Cummins but leaving out Josh Hazlewood from the pace trio that will be first choice through the tournament proper. That gave Kane Richardson a final chance to press his case, using his changes of pace and length to finish with an innings-high 4-30. Ashton Agar played as the main spinner instead of Adam Zampa, but fared less impressively with 1-36.  With no crowd to buoy the occasion, players moved diffidently, spoke quietly, and bowlers delivered a slew of wides while attempting variations. India\u2019s opener KL Rahul was one of the few at full throttle, immediately taking on all three frontline fast bowlers before a 20-run over from Marcus Stoinis. Especially severe on anything short enough to pull, Rahul raised a half century from 27 balls while his opening partner Rohit Sharma had one run from five. When Rohit joined the party with a couple of big blows, India had 75 from the first seven overs and could have blazed well past 200. But the introduction of spin slowed the charge, with Glenn Maxwell having Rahul caught by Ashton Agar at deep midwicket for 57, before Maxwell returned the favour to give Agar the wicket of Rohit for 15. From then it was dash and depart for the Indian bats, with Virat Kohli hooking Starc to deep backward square for 19, before Richardson had Hardik Pandya bunting a slower ball to short third for 2, and Dinesh Karthik swatting to Maxwell in the deep for 20. Suryakumar Yadav was the one to bat through, using his array of classy shots to make an even 50 before miscuing a Richardson full toss in the 20th over to give a return catch. Richardson followed up by having Ravichandran Ashwin caught on the fence one ball after being lifted over deep third for a clever six. Mitchell Marsh got an opportunity at the top of the order for Australia, with David Warner still resting after his recent head knock. The big all-rounder kept things simple and swung hard, with big edges flying to the fence and over it before starting to find the middle of the bat. Finch chimed in, the pair raising a 50 partnership in less than five overs, before Marsh chopped Bhuvneshwar Kumar onto his stumps for 35 from 18 balls. Steve Smith hit one huge six before being bowled by leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal, but that brought Finch together with Maxwell to turbocharge the innings. Maxwell had one alarming moment when he was struck near the eye by a top edge from his signature switch hit, the batter not wearing a helmet against spin. With the protective gear applied though, he immediately followed up with a couple of boundaries. But Maxwell edged a cutter from Bhuvneshwar for 23, Marcus Stoinis was caught in the deep, and Finch was the decisive loss when Harshal Patel\u2019s slower ball wobbled underneath his bat to hit the stumps. Big hitter Tim David was run out next ball, leaving Australia needing 11 from the final over. Mohammed Shami had not bowled all day, having missed Indian T20 duty with injury for a year. But he was called upon for the final over and delivered, having Cummins caught at midwicket before bowling Inglis and Richardson, his wickets only interrupted by the run out of Agar. India will take bragging rights, but Australia will take plenty of heart with their captain back among the runs ahead of their tournament opener against New Zealand on Saturday."

                    "body": "The US is on course to be named in mid-May as host of the 2031 men\u2019s Rugby World Cup and the women\u2019s event in 2033 with a bid priced at half a billion dollars and support from the Biden White House, executives including World Rugby chief Alan Gilpin said on Thursday.  \u201cWe\u2019re not talking to anybody else about Rugby World Cup hosting in 2031 and 2033,\u201d Gilpin said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a done deal \u2026 but it means that we strategically believe we can deliver the right outcomes with this hosting plan.\u201d Australia is in similar dialogue regarding the men\u2019s event in 2027. Asked about reports of problems, Gilpin said: \u201cThe short answer is there\u2019ll be more news to come in the next couple of weeks. \u201cWe\u2019re down in Australia from the end of next week, addressing the outstanding issues with with our friends at Rugby Australia. So there\u2019ll be more to come on that. In terms of contingencies, yes, lots of conversations going on around who\u2019s capable of hosting and when and again, those are very strategic conversations rather than a competitive bid process. \u201cSo [Australia] are our preferred candidate for 2027 and we expect to be in good shape in the discussions with them.\u201d For the US bid, which has shifted from an initial model of hosting the women in 2029 to the hope that a successful men\u2019s event can drive engagement, the next big date is 12 May, when the World Rugby council will meet. Gilpin spoke to reporters alongside Ross Young, chief executive of USA Rugby, the US bid chair, Jim Brown, and Emily Bydwell, US representative to the World Rugby Women\u2019s Advisory Group. Gilpin said: \u201cThe guys absolutely are making sure that we\u2019ve got the different stakeholders from government through to city and state aligned as much as you can have this far out, and behind that we\u2019ve got the confidence there that if we award these tournaments to the US, we\u2019re on the right track. \u201cFrom my point of view, we stand up in front of all of the council on 12 May and we sell them the vision \u2026 and we give them the confidence that the numbers work and that the infrastructure and the the ingredients to deliver the plan are there. And then we move forward. And of course the really hard work starts on 13 May. \u201cThis is just the end of the beginning. There\u2019s a lot to do.\u201d The US men\u2019s team have a lot to do on the field, having shipped 104 points to the All Blacks in October and needing to beat Chile for a place at the World Cup in France next year. Domestically, a professional competition, Major League Rugby, is in its fifth season. Gilpin said on Thursday preparations for a US World Cup in 2031 would most likely include top international and club teams being brought in to play American opposition or each other, in an attempt to broaden the domestic audience. Bydwell said women\u2019s rugby was \u201creally at an inflection point right now globally and in the US\u201d, and pointed to the launch next year of WXV, a World Rugby event which will place international teams in three tiers, seeking to develop depth. Brown put the cost of the joint bid between World Rugby and USA Rugby at around half a billion dollars. USA Rugby recently emerged from bankruptcy. Young and Gilpin said costs, profits and losses would be shared. \u201cWe\u2019re actually taking from a World Rugby perspective more risk,\u201d Gilpin said. \u201cBut it\u2019s calculated risk and it\u2019s about using the events to drive growth. We therefore require less certainty and less risk-taking commitment from from a host \u2026 and that\u2019s allowed us, particularly with USA Rugby, to have a different type of discussion.\u201d US-hosted Rugby World Cups would use NFL, college and MLS stadiums. Brown said: \u201cWe have upwards of 28 cities interested in potentially hosting the Rugby World Cup, not only in \u201931 but also \u201933. We have great relationship with government. We have great relationships with stadiums and over 30 potential stadiums interested.\u201d Last week, Gilpin toured Empower Field at Mile High in Denver, Colorado, home of the Broncos in NFL and a potential World Cup venue. Federal support was expressed earlier this month via a bipartisan resolution from the Congressional Rugby Caucus. \u201cThe catchphrase that goes with the bid is being United by Rugby,\u201d Young said, referring to the American game as much as to political divides. \u201cThis is a big old geography, there are a number of different stakeholders that just aren\u2019t as aligned as they should be for the growth of the game. So this is the opportunity to do that, to do that background work and create a plan that\u2019s measurable and accountable.\u201d  Asked if government support extended to the White House, where resides a self-proclaimed rugby player and fan, Joe Biden, Brown said: \u201cWe\u2019re in regular dialogue with the White House and the deliverables related to meeting the requirements of hosting. \u201cThere is support at the White House for both \u201931 and \u201933. All the guarantees that are required, namely, obviously visa and entry, tax-related requirements, and just general support from the government have been positive so far.\u201d Federal and state governments would also be involved in security arrangements. \u201cThe expectation,\u201d Brown said, \u201cis to have a formal letter sent to World Rugby from the White House, which is also well on track and should be delivered by next week, confirming a full commitment by the federal government, which obviously then impacts state and city commitments as well. \u201cI think in this case, we have a unique situation of two [tournaments] which has been especially attractive to at least the staff of the White House that we\u2019ve worked with.\u201d"

                    "body": "The EU has raised the prospect of a substantial fine or ban for Twitter after warning that it must \u201csignificantly increase\u201d efforts to comply with new online legislation. Twitter\u2019s new owner, Elon Musk, was told he had \u201chuge work ahead\u201d to comply with the EU\u2019s Digital Services Act, which requires tech firms to tackle problems including abusive posts and disinformation. The EU\u2019s commissioner for the internal market, Thierry Breton, told the Tesla CEO that Twitter will have to significantly increase efforts to \u201cpass the grade\u201d, implying that the platform was in danger of non-compliance with the act. \u201cI welcome Elon Musk\u2019s statements of intent to get Twitter 2.0 ready for the DSA,\u201d said Breton. \u201cI am pleased to hear that he has read it carefully and considers it as a sensible approach to implement on a worldwide basis. But let\u2019s also be clear that there is still huge work ahead, as Twitter will have to implement transparent user policies, significantly reinforce content moderation and protect freedom of speech.\u201d He added that Twitter would have to \u201ctackle disinformation with resolve\u201d and limit targeted advertising, including banning profiling of child users for advertising purposes. The Financial Times reported that Breton reiterated the punishments for breaches of the act, which include fines of up to 6% of global turnover \u2013 which would be around $500m in Twitter\u2019s case \u2013 or a temporary suspension of the service if refusal to comply endangers people\u2019s life and safety. Suspension is described by the EU as a \u201clast resort\u201d. Musk has fired half of Twitter\u2019s 7,500 staff since buying the business for $44bn in October, with a further 1,200 reportedly quitting in November after he told remaining staff to commit to being \u201chardcore\u201d or leave. The company\u2019s head of trust and safety, who oversaw content moderation at Twitter, has also quit since the takeover. The departures, fears that Musk will relax content moderation policies and a botched attempt at relaunching Twitter\u2019s verified user system have resulted in significant numbers of advertisers pausing their spending on the platform. Twitter has also announced that it is no longer enforcing its policy against Covid-19 misinformation. A readout of the video call between Musk and Breton described it as a \u201cconstructive working meeting\u201d with an agreement between both parties to carry out a \u201cstress test\u201d on compliance with the act early next year, as well as preparing for an independent audit of the platform. The readout added that Musk had \u201ccommitted to comply\u201d with the DSA. In a blog post published on Wednesday, Twitter said its trust and safety team was continuing \u201cdiligent work\u201d to keep the platform safe from abuse, hateful content and any violation of its rules. It added that the team remained \u201cstrong and well-resourced\u201d. Meanwhile, the US treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, declined to say whether the Treasury-led Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) was conducting a review of Twitter. Last month it was reported that CFIUS might investigate the level of non-US investment in Musk\u2019s takeover, which includes financial support from investors including the Saudi Arabian investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal; Qatar Holding, which is part of the Qatar Investment Authority; and Binance, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange, whose holding company is registered in the Cayman Islands. Speaking at a New York Times conference on Wednesday, Yellen said CFIUS looks closely at acquisitions and investments in US firms by foreign buyers that could pose national security risks. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say specifically what we are or aren\u2019t looking at,\u201d Yellen said. \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on work that\u2019s in progress. But if there are such risks, it would be appropriate for CFIUS to have a look.\u201d On Monday Musk accused Apple of threatening to block Twitter from its app store and said Apple was pressuring Twitter over content moderation demands. Yellen said she believed it was appropriate for mobile technology giants Apple and Google to demand certain content standards. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good thing, if Apple is looking at the content. Most broadcast stations are subjected to standards in terms of what they broadcast to the public. And Twitter\u2019s not really that different than other broadcast stations,\u201d Yellen said. Asked if it was good that such platforms were overseeing content, Yellen said. \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of control that I think is needed.\u201d"

To win by that margin, to play as we did for the majority of the game, we\u2019ve got to be really happy. We looked ready. The players dealt with the game really well. Our press was really good, our movement was really good. I\u2019ve got to be really happy. But we shouldn\u2019t be conceding two goals at that stage of the game. We\u2019ll have to be right on our game against the States. It\u2019s a great start, but we\u2019ll have to be better. We lost concentration and when we play at a slower tempo, we\u2019re not anywhere near as effective. I\u2019m a miserable so-and-so, I should be more excited! But I have to keep the team on the right track and we will have to be better.\u201d     3.27pm    The 19-year-old sensation Jude Bellingham talks to the BBC. \u201cIt\u2019s a really good day for us. Six goals in a World Cup game is really impressive, regardless of who you\u2019re playing. They came out really well, hard to break down. We didn\u2019t have anything clear for quite a while. But with more goals we opened them up. We had to dig it out. So it\u2019s important we learn how to create chances against sides like that. But we\u2019re a bit disappointed with the two goals [Iran scored] to be honest. I thought [my goal] had missed! It took ages to loop into the goal. It was a brilliant ball from Shaw. A really proud moment for me. We have to get ready for the next game. We\u2019ll still be at the same level, trying to get two more wins, and get that mentality into hopefully the rest of the tournament.\u201d   Updated at 3.30pm GMT    3.23pm    So after one game, this is how Group B looks. Draw i chi, Gymru! Pob lwc!      3.21pm    That\u2019s a magnificent opening performance by England, with the effervescent Bukayo Saka the two-goal star. He\u2019s plainly delighted as he talks to the BBC: \u201cI can\u2019t describe the feeling. It\u2019s amazing, I\u2019m so happy, I\u2019m so proud, and we\u2019ve got the win as well, so it\u2019s a really special day! We needed a good start, we didn\u2019t play the best coming into the tournament. But we showed everyone how much quality we have and what we can do. It\u2019s amazing. We have to be consistent, because we have the next game coming up in a few days and we have to come again. I feel like I\u2019m in a good place. I\u2019ve got support from the fans, I feel the love, and support from the staff and my teammates, and that\u2019s all I need. I gave 100 percent and I\u2019ll continue to do that every time I put the shirt on.\u201d     3.14pm   FULL TIME: England 6-2 Iran  There\u2019s no time for the game to restart. The final whistle goes. England have announced themselves at the 2022 World Cup finals with a six-goal salute!   Updated at 3.17pm GMT    3.13pm   GOAL! England 6-2 Iran (Taremi 90+13)  The whistle goes. Taremi has a good long think before beginning his run-up. Taremi gives Pickford the eyes and sends him the wrong way, slotting into the bottom right. A personal two-goal consolation for Taremi!   Updated at 3.16pm GMT    3.11pm    90 min +12: The referee points to the spot! It\u2019ll be a penalty for Iran!     3.11pm    90 min +11: The referee makes the TV mime and trots across to the monitor. He sees images of Stones tugging the back of Pouraliganji\u2019s shirt.      3.10pm    90 min +10: Iran are finishing the match strongly. Hajsafi curls a free kick into the England mixer from the right. Pickford rises highest to tip clear. But there\u2019s going to be a VAR check for a possible penalty!   Updated at 3.15pm GMT    3.09pm    90 min +8: Azmoun is sent scampering free down the inside-left channel by Torabi\u2019s slide-rule pass. He opens his body and absolutely batters a rising shot towards the top left. Pickford gets a finger to it, and the ball twangs off the top of the crossbar. What a strike! What a save! No corner for some reason!     3.07pm    90 min +7: \u201cPlease let the world know that the majority of 85 million Iranians within Iran and the eight million Iranians in diaspora want a regime change in Iran,\u201d begins Ellie Saberi. \u201cThe government does not represent its people and its killing, torturing, raping of its own citizens instead of listening to them. The government has been an evil force for 43 years and is the biggest terrorist in the region. They are steeling the wealth of the nation for 43 years and the population is suffering from massive economic mismanagement in one of the richest countries in the world. Please be the voice of the innocent children and youth of Iran who have been murdered by this evil regime.With gratitude. #mahsa-amini #womanlifefreedom #freeiran #iranrevolution\u201d     3.05pm    90 min +5: Taremi can\u2019t quite rise high enough to meet a cross from the left. All credit to Iran for keeping going here.     3.04pm    90 min +3: There are going to be ten added minutes, by the way. Twenty-four additional minutes in total. A World Cup record? A World Cup record.     3.03pm    90 min +1: Grealish celebrates in the style requested of him by his greatest fan. The mind would have been racing after scoring his first goal at a World Cup, so how lovely for him to remember!      3.00pm   GOAL! England 6-1 Iran (Grealish 90)  \u2026 cuts back and tees up Grealish, six yards out. He passes the ball elegantly into the bottom right. The joy of six for England!     Updated at 4.09pm GMT    2.59pm    89 min: So having said that, Wilson dribbles purposefully down the right. He\u2019s within his rights to shoot from a tight angle, but instead, as the clock turns to 90 minutes \u2026     2.58pm    87 min: This game is petering out now. Both teams would be more than happy to down tools and get in the bath.     2.56pm    85 min: Rashford nearly undoes Iran again with another run similar to his goal. Then he considers a third attempt, but instead tries to thread Wilson clear down the channel. The pass doesn\u2019t quite come off.     2.54pm    83 min: Hajsafi is good to continue.     2.51pm    81 min: A pause in play as Iran captain Hajsafi goes down holding his foot. Ah, it\u2019s cramp. Iran have made all their changes, including the concussion sub, so they\u2019ll hope he\u2019s OK to continue for damage-limitation purposes if nothing else.     2.49pm    79 min: The official attendance of this match is 45,334. The stadium has a 68,000 capacity. Oh Fifa. Nope, my bad, that capacity figure of 68,000 was given by the BBC, and it\u2019s way off whack. Oh Guardian!  Updated at 3.46pm GMT    2.47pm    77 min: Taremi slashes a shot high and wide right. Then Azmoun comes on for Nourollahi.     2.47pm    75 min: Kane, already behind four of his team-mates in the race for the Golden Boot, makes way for Wilson. As for the delayed introduction of Dier, here\u2019s Thomas Atkins: \u201cWho in the England camp would you have down as going full John Aldridge at USA 94 when held up from going on? Pickford, obviously, but he\u2019s unlikely to be in that situation. Maybe Grealish?\u201d A toss-up between Jordan Henderson and Aaron Ramsdale, surely. Both with hair-triggers that would make Aldo proud.  Updated at 2.48pm GMT    2.43pm    73 min: Not a great day for Iran, then. Though everything in perspective, as Nico points out: \u201cWorth mentioning that the Iranian players refused to sing the anthem (which practically guarantees them a lot of trouble back home), while the Iranian fans drowned it out jeering (apparently the Iranian state TV even cut the live broadcast).\u201d     2.42pm   GOAL! England 5-1 Iran (Rashford 71)  Rashford, out on the right, takes one touch. Then another. Then he opens up his body and strokes a shot across Hosseini and into the bottom left. What an introduction!    Updated at 4.11pm GMT    2.41pm    70 min: Dier is finally allowed to come on. He\u2019s one of four swaps: Mount, Saka and Sterling also make way, for Rashford, Grealish and Foden.  Updated at 2.52pm GMT    2.40pm    69 min: With England down to ten men, Iran come at them again, and Nourollahi hooks a shot over the bar from distance. Pickford is livid, and gives the referee a piece of his mind. There would have been some instant fume-infused amusement had a goal gone in there!     2.38pm    68 min: \u2026 but the admin\u2019s not been sorted out properly, and while Maguire has departed, his replacement waits impotently on the touchline.     2.37pm    67 min: Before the game can restart, Maguire goes down. He\u2019s looking woozy. He can\u2019t continue, and he\u2019ll be replaced by Dier.   Updated at 2.42pm GMT    2.37pm   GOAL! England 4-1 Iran (Taremi 65)  Pickford finally has a shot to face \u2026 and he\u2019s utterly helpless to do anything about it! A reverse pass rolled down the inside-right channel by Gholizadeh and into the box for Taremi, who swivels and lashes a first-time riser past the keeper at 101mph. That nearly took the roof off the net!   Updated at 2.41pm GMT    2.34pm    63 min: Iran make another change, swapping Mohammadi for Torabi.     2.33pm   GOAL! England 4-0 Iran (Saka 62)  Saka is taking his Arsenal form into the World Cup all right! Sterling is nearly cleaned out in the middle of the park. He keeps going, though, and feeds Saka on the right. Saka dribbles into the box, drops a shoulder to see off three men, and steers a shot into the bottom left. A slight deflection maybe, but take nothing away from the quality of the run!     Updated at 4.13pm GMT    2.31pm    61 min: Ezatolahi takes a whack at goal from what can politely be described as an ambitious distance. He drags it miles wide left.     2.30pm    60 min: \u2026 and while the match goes through something of a mellow phase, here\u2019s some reaction from Headway, the brain injury association, regarding Iran\u2019s initial unwillingness to withdraw the clearly groggy Beiranvand. \u201cIt is an utter disgrace that the Iran keeper Alireza Beiranvand was allowed to stay on the pitch,\u201d says Luke Griggs, Interim Chief Executive of Headway UK. \u201cIt was irrelevant that he came off a minute later, he shouldn\u2019t have stayed on for a second, let alone a minute. He was clearly distressed and unfit to continue, this seems to be another case of the decision being made by the player and not medical staff. This was the first test of the Fifa World Cup concussion protocol and it was an abject failure.\u201d     2.28pm    58 min: Meanwhile outside the stadium, Michael Safi reports \u2026      2.27pm    57 min: Sterling nearly gets away down the left. Pouraliganji arrives with a perfectly timed tackle, just as Sterling was planning to shift his feet inside the box. Nothing comes of the resulting corner.     2.26pm    55 min: Maguire can\u2019t meet the corner. England recycle possession down the left. Mount floats an easy one in for the Iran keeper. Meanwhile in a pithy email headed \u201cWankers\u201d, Jeff Sachs cuts to the chase: \u201cTalk talk talk. Why didn\u2019t Kane wear the armband from the beginning? Or even better, every player should have. Everyone is bankrupt morally.\u201d     2.24pm    54 min: Bellingham sashays his way down the right and reaches the byline. He can\u2019t find a white shirt in the middle with his cutback, but a corner will surely do. Trippier, back up and running, takes. Hossein Hosseini tips the ball away from danger, but England come straight back at Iran and win another corner down the right. Trippier to take again.     2.22pm    52 min: Now Trippier is down, clutching his right foot, and he\u2019s far from happy with Nourollahi, who had stood on it. Trippier is OK to continue, but Iran are beginning to make some frustrated challenges.   Updated at 2.24pm GMT    2.20pm    51 min: Kane comes back on, and watches Trippier blast the resulting free kick witlessly into the wall. Not like him.     2.20pm    50 min: The trainer helps Kane hack onto his feet. The captain looks good to continue, though whether he\u2019ll be risked for the rest of a match already won remains to be seen.     2.18pm    48 min: Pouraliganji is booked for a late tackle on Kane from behind. Kane went over on his ankle as he fell. He felt that.   Updated at 2.23pm GMT    2.17pm    47 min: Pickford, perhaps bored and desirous of something to get the blood pumping, dallies over a simple clearance and his kick is nearly charged down by Taremi.     2.17pm    England get the second half underway. No changes for them. Iran have made three changes, though. Ezatolahi, Kanaani and Gholizadeh come on for Jahanbakhsh, Karimi and Cheshmi.   Updated at 2.22pm GMT    2.11pm    Half-time advertisement.

Updated at 2.12pm GMT    2.07pm    Half-time entertainment. Meanwhile back in Blighty \u2026      2.01pm   HALF TIME: England 3-0 Iran  England have positively flown out of the blocks at the 2022 World Cup. Iran, remember, are renowned for their defensive nous. But now look! Gary Naylor suggests how to make a great half for England even more productive: \u201cKane can come out with the armband for the second half, take the yellow card and carry the Fifa-bothering cloth aloft as Callum Wilson comes on as a substitute.\u201d   Updated at 2.03pm GMT    1.59pm    45 min +14: A free kick for England 30 yards out, a little left of centre. Shaw hoicks it in. Maguire isn\u2019t expecting it to get through to him on the right-hand corner of the six-yard box. He can\u2019t control. Neither can Stones. Iran clear.     1.57pm    45 min +12: The England band are playing Jingle Bells. At a World Cup.     1.56pm    45 min +11: Pickford still hasn\u2019t had anything to do. But he should have. Trippier and Rice get careless in the centre circle, and that allows Iran to break three on two. Hajsafi finds space down the left, and crosses long for Jahanbakhsh, all alone on the penalty spot. He has time to take a touch, but goes for the spectacular volley instead. The ball flies many yards above the bar.     1.55pm    45 min +10: Jordan Pickford has had absolutely nothing to do.   Updated at 1.57pm GMT    1.53pm    45 min +8: Stones tries to release Sterling with a long pass. Not quite. \u201cThe short amount of time teams had to prepare for the tournament must be playing its part here,\u201d argues K\u00e1ri Tulinius. \u201cIran do not look like a team that have had much time being drilled defensively by Carlos Queiroz. He must be ripping chunks of his hair out on the sidelines.\u201d     1.52pm    45 min +6: England stroke the ball around the back in the casual style. Their fans, more of them now in situ, are making the sort of noise that goes with a three-goal lead.     1.50pm    45 min +4: Trippier\u2019s persistence wins a corner down the right. Nothing comes of the corner, though the ball nearly drops to Saka. He can\u2019t control, but Hajsafi had nibbled at him from behind, and had he gone down, the referee would have had a penalty decision to make. Saka too honest?     1.48pm    45 min +3: That goal came in the first of 14 added minutes. Iran have been totally ripped to shreds here. England, after a slow start, have been sensational.     1.47pm   GOAL! England 3-0 Iran (Sterling 45+1)  There\u2019s going to be a lot of added time, and the half-time whistle can\u2019t come soon enough for Iran! Bellingham latches onto a loose ball in the middle of the park and suddenly launches a three-on-two attack! Bellingham slips a pass down the right for Kane, who initially looks to have gone down a cul-de-sac, but digs out a low cross. Sterling meets at the near post, ten yards out, and forces into the bottom right!     Updated at 2.01pm GMT    1.45pm    44 min: Iran are incensed, claiming Maguire had piggybacked on Cheshmi and Jahanbakhsh when winning his header. But there was nothing in it. Good goal!     1.44pm   GOAL! England 2-0 Iran (Saka 43)  This is an absolute peach! Mount and Sterling combine down the left to earn a corner. Shaw sends in a long outswinger. Maguire heads down for Saka, who meets the bouncing ball and creams a looper into the top-right corner!    Updated at 1.50pm GMT    1.42pm    42 min: A few discordant horns in the crowd. Think the England band featuring Ornette Coleman on vuvuzela.     1.40pm    40 min: \u2026 so having said that, Mohrrami makes good down the right only for his low cross, intended for Taremi, to be intercepted in the box by the telescopic leg of Rice.     1.39pm    39 min: No discernible change in Iran\u2019s defence-first tactics yet.     1.37pm    37 min: That was Bellingham\u2019s first goal for England. It won\u2019t be his last. Tell you what, it was one hell of a cross by Shaw, too. A simple but very aesthetically pleasant goal.     1.36pm    36 min: Iran are reeling at the concession of the goal, and Kane should slip Mount clear into the box down the inside-left channel. But he clanks an uncharacteristically dismal pass out for a goal kick.     1.35pm   GOAL! England 1-0 Iran (Bellingham 35)  Yep, that had been coming \u2026 for the last five minutes. Shaw gets into some space down the left. He crosses. Bellingham rises highest, and guides an unstoppable header into the top right from eight yards. Nothing to do with pace; all precision. Exclusive breaking news: this lad\u2019s not bad at all!    Updated at 1.58pm GMT    1.34pm    34 min: England have picked it up in the last few minutes. It\u2019s still attack versus defence, but now attack looks a little more likely to break through.      1.33pm    32 min: Trippier floats the corner into the mixer. Maguire, who knows a thing or two about scoring at World Cups, wins the header and steers it towards the top-left corner. It\u2019s a gorgeous header, but it clanks off the underside of the bar and away. So close to the opening goal!     1.31pm    31 min: Sterling nutmegs Majid Hosseini down the right, lovely skill that leads to an England corner. Trippier to take.     1.30pm    30 min: England finally put something together. Saka and Sterling combine cutely down the right, the former cutting a ball back, then running onto the return pass. He crosses towards Mount, rushing in at the near post. Mount swishes into the side netting. Hossein Hosseini had it covered.   Updated at 1.35pm GMT    1.28pm    28 min: Saka cuts in from the right and sends a soft low curler into the arms of Hossein Hosseini. Warm applause for the substitute keeper as he makes the easy claim, his first act since coming on for Beiranvand.     1.27pm    27 min: England have enjoyed 73 percent of possession so far. Not sure this \u201cIn Contest\u201d thing (14 percent to Iran\u2019s 13, for the record) will catch on. Which probably means it almost certainly will. You can bore anyone prove anything with stats.     1.25pm    25 min: Jahanbakhsh goes into the book for standing on Shaw\u2019s foot. Late and clumsy more than aggressive, but Shaw will have felt that nonetheless.     1.24pm    24 min: Beiranvand\u2019s substitution falls under concussion protocols, incidentally. So Iran can still make five changes. Not sure Beiranvand will be available for any more of Iran\u2019s group games, though, even if he does recover in time.     1.23pm    23 min: Jahanbakhsh hoicks in from the left. Trippier clips clear. Everyone\u2019s understandably all over the place at the minute, no surprise in the wake of that long, long, long stoppage.     1.22pm    22 min: Iran restart the quicker. Bellingham carelessly runs into the back of Hajsafi out on the Iranian left, and this is a free kick in a dangerous position.     1.21pm    20 min: This outcome was obvious to everyone but Iran from the get-go. Beiranvand tipped away from Sterling brilliantly and bravely, only to accidentally smack into his team-mate Majid Hosseini at full pelt. The keeper is replaced by Hossein Hosseini.     1.18pm    18 min: On comes the stretcher. This should have happened the best part of ten minutes ago!   Updated at 1.22pm GMT    1.17pm    17 min: Beiranvand performs the internationally recognised hand-jive mime for Substitute Me. He lies back down on the turf, and now Hajsafi does the hand-jive too.     1.16pm    16 min: Beiranvand takes the goal kick. It\u2019ll be interesting to see how much longer he lasts.     1.16pm    15 min: Beiranvand, having taken off his gloves in order to depart, changes his shirt, then puts the mitts back on! Concussion protocols and all that \u2026 this doesn\u2019t look a wise move by Iran on more than one level. Beiranvand looks extremely groggy as he prepares to restart the game by taking a goal kick.     1.14pm    14 min: Beiranvand is about to be led off \u2026 when his captain Hajsafi flings the contents of his water bottle in the keeper\u2019s face. He doesn\u2019t want Beiranvand to leave. He\u2019s trying to revive his team-mate and buy some time.     1.12pm    12 min: Beiranvand is sitting up now, but \u2026 hold on, scrub that, he\u2019s lying down again. Surely he\u2019ll not be able to continue? They\u2019re desperately trying to stem the flow of blood from his nose.     1.11pm    11 min: Hosseini is back up soon enough, but poor Beiranvand looks extremely groggy. Lucky he\u2019s wearing a red shirt, for reasons that won\u2019t need explaining. The magic sponge is applied, but the keeper needs a quick lie down. Not sure he\u2019ll be able to continue.   Updated at 1.13pm GMT    1.10pm    9 min: That was a lovely cross from Kane, and some fine goalkeeping. Brave, too, because Beiranvand takes a whack full in the face from his own man Hosseini. Ooyah, ow, oof, that was flush in the coupon, at full speed too. Both players go down.   Updated at 1.12pm GMT    1.09pm    8 min: Saka dribbles with pace and purpose down the inside-right channel. He\u2019s fouled a couple of times. The free kick\u2019s sent down the right by Trippier, who finds Kane. The captain whips a fine cross into the middle. Beiranvand fingertips away from danger, with Sterling lurking to head home, and Maguire trundles the ball out at the far post. Fair enough, he had no time to react.  Updated at 1.18pm GMT    1.06pm    6 min: The pattern of this game appears to have been set early. Iran sitting back. England seeing a lot of the ball. Shaw hooks in from the left but there are a lot of red shirts in that box and one of them easily clears.     1.05pm    4 min: VAR takes a look at the Cheshmi bear-hug, but concludes there\u2019s nothing in it. Meanwhile here\u2019s John Swan: \u201cThe whole point of a protest is that by its nature you\u2019re saying something against a prevailing attitude or culture, which means you\u2019re likely to get pushback. If you then immediately fold and go, oh well fair enough, we won\u2019t say anything, then I have one word for you - pffffffft.\u201d    Updated at 2.00pm GMT    1.03pm    3 min: Mount\u2019s presence down the left earns England the first corner of the match. For Queen and country. Trippier comes over to take it \u2026 and sends it straight over everyone\u2019s head and out for a goal kick. Maguire goes over, mid-hug with Cheshmi. England want a penalty but they\u2019re not getting one. You\u2019ve seen them given for less.     1.02pm    2 min: Iran ship possession and quickly assume their low block. Trippier swings one in from the right but there\u2019s nobody in white gambling. Iran clear. \u201cIn solidarity with the LGBT community we are not watching the matches in our household,\u201d writes Katie Jones. \u201cWe are following the Guardian MBM instead. This is our form of boycott to get the viewing figures down. Looking forward to the MBM. We do expect to see goals in the 6pm news :)\u201d     1.00pm    \u2026 and finally some football \u2026 although it only begins after England take the knee. Iran get the ball rolling.    Updated at 4.14pm GMT    12.59pm    Fifa\u2019s official response.      12.57pm    \u2026 though the stadium\u2019s still not full. On that subject, Sean Ingle reports: \u201cFifa has acknowledged ticketing issues for fans trying to enter the stadium. It says some supporters are experiencing a problem with accessing their tickets via the Fifa ticketing app and that those affected need to access their email for further instructions or go to the stadium\u2019s ticket resolution point for support. Fifa said it was trying to resolve the issue. With the players coming out if appears the game will start on time.\u201d     12.56pm    The teams are out! England in white, Iran in red. The anthems. Mason Mount with a loyal rendition of \u201cGod Save the Queen\u201d. Hey, some habits die hard. Iran\u2019s supporters meanwhile give their own anthem the bird. We\u2019ll be off in a couple of minutes.   Updated at 1.01pm GMT    12.53pm    There\u2019s more of your reaction to the armband fiasco, too. \u201cIt\u2019s hard not to compare Ehsan Hajsafi\u2019s risking his personal safety and freedom to criticize the situation in Iran with the European FA\u2019s unwillingness to get a yellow card\u201d \u2013 Zach Neeley. \u201cThe only armbands needed today are those of the various Football Association\u2019s performativity swimming around the shallow end of protest\u201d \u2013 Jaz Evans. \u201cThere are five substitutes allowed. Send on a squad player as \u2018captain\u2019 with the One Love armband, then sub them off after 30 seconds. Double the focus as the quickest substitution in World Cup history is made; and surely England don\u2019t need to use all five substitutes in a 90-minute game against Iran? Just a thought, if the commitment is really there\u201d \u2013 Iain Pearson.     12.51pm    More from Jacob. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool inside. Not too hot outside either. It was way hotter at England v Croatia in London.\u201d      12.47pm    As if this World Cup wasn\u2019t already farcical enough, there are reports of ticketing problems at the Khalifa International Stadium. With kick-off fast approaching, the stadium is far from full, and some England fans have been queuing for over two hours to get in. Our man on the ground, Jacob Steinberg, reports that \u201cthe website has crashed, which means you can\u2019t access e-tickets, so they are trying to give people paper tickets.\u201d Shades of this year\u2019s Champions League final with ticketing chaos outside. Jacob also adds: \u201cI can confirm me and Barney Ronay have had to put headphones in as the sound system at this stadium is so loud. The woman with the mic is screaming into it, as if she doesn\u2019t know how microphones work.\u201d  Updated at 12.49pm GMT    12.39pm    The Iran team are playing with a backdrop of civil unrest back home. Their captain Ehsan Hajsafi has told a press conference: \u201cMy condolences to all the mourning families in Iran \u2026 we stand with them and share their pain \u2026 we must accept that conditions in our country are not right and our people are not happy \u2026 my people are sad and our presence here does not mean that we cannot be a voice for them or should not respect them \u2026 we owe our lives to our people and we are here to work hard, fight, show our best performance and score goals, and present them to the bereaved Iranian people \u2026 I hope that things will improve and everyone will be happy.\u201d      12.29pm    The BBC\u2019s Alex Scott is pitchside, discussing the 30-degree-centigrade conditions, but more pertinently wearing the aforementioned One Love rainbow armband in marvellously conspicuous style. On that subject, Gerry from Queens, New York City writes: \u201cWith all due respect to the captains/teams, I think it shows a lucklustre commitment to their activism to back down on the rainbow armbands. If you are really committed to bringing attention to this injustice, take the sanction: it would allow Fifa themselves to increase focus on politics of this issue if the refs show a card (or whatever else), and this discussion would be amplified many times over. Instead, players show us that at the end of the day fighting injustice is less important to them than sport: exactly the point Fifa was hoping we\u2019s all take from this World Cup.\u201d   Updated at 12.48pm GMT    12.24pm    Gareth Southgate speaks to the BBC. \u201cWe\u2019ve maximised the time. We\u2019ve spent the first part of the week exciting people about being involved in the World Cup, and the latter part, since we got here, on the training pitch. And I\u2019m really pleased with the way the players have approached everything. We feel this is a strong team, a strong way to start, and great depth to come in. We want to be positive and play on the front foot.\u201d  \u2026 and as for the One Love armband brouhaha \u2026 \u201cA lot of discussion has been going on without me involved, because I\u2019ve been focused on the game. We\u2019re wearing the Fifa armband that was decided on by the collected federations overnight, I believe. We are in the middle of that and are just trying to focus on the game, frankly.\u201d  Updated at 12.35pm GMT    12.03pm    Harry Maguire gets the nod despite being a spare part at Manchester United these days. Raheem Sterling meanwhile is preferred to Phil Foden up front. A positive 4-3-3. James Maddison is out nursing his sore knee. Iran\u2019s star forward Sardar Azmoun begins his World Cup on the bench. The Bayer Leverkusen striker hasn\u2019t played since injuring his calf at the start of October. Mehdi Taremi of Porto leads the line.   Updated at 4.16pm GMT    11.58am   The teams  England: Pickford, Trippier, Stones, Maguire, Shaw, Bellingham, Rice, Saka, Mount, Sterling, Kane.Subs: Walker, Grealish, Henderson, Rashford, Pope, Phillips, Dier, Coady,Alexander-Arnold, Foden, White, Ramsdale, Wilson, Maddison, Gallagher.

Updated at 12.20pm GMT    11.40am    Fifa are a shower (pt XXXVIII in an ongoing series). Shame all the associations didn\u2019t stand their ground.   Updated at 11.43am GMT    11.30am   Preamble  Let\u2019s warm up for the big one by going through our cognitive-dissonance drills. Everyone ready? Here we go, then. To cover isn\u2019t to condone; to watch, listen and read implies no approval; to feel a pang of That Old World Cup Fever obligates nobody to feel any guilt or shame. This is Fifa\u2019s burden to carry: enjoy the football, and don\u2019t let them foist a single scrap of their terrible karmic load onto you. But of course the enjoyment of football is a very nebulous concept, especially when you\u2019re watching your team trying their best at a World Cup. And right on cue, here come England! Gareth Southgate\u2019s side came fourth in 2018 and were a penalty competition away from becoming champions of Europe last year. On the other hand, they haven\u2019t won in six, a sequence which includes their biggest home defeat for 94 years. They\u2019re about to either make the final step to glory, then, or signal the end of a goldish era that promised pretty things and nearly delivered some of them. They should be too good for Iran. But then everyone said the same about Scotland in 1978 and the USA two decades later. At the last two World Cups, Iran gave Argentina, Spain and Portugal a game. More pertinently, Carlos Queiroz\u2019s 2022 version have recently beaten hipster-dark-horses Uruguay and African champions Senegal. They don\u2019t concede too many, so given England\u2019s recent net-finding travails \u2013 plus the Three Lions\u2019 habit of starting World Cups slowly \u00ad\u2013 Iran may fancy their chances of opening Group B by springing a surprise. Kick off is at 1pm GMT, 4pm at the Khalifa International Stadium in Doha. \u0627\u0646\u0647 \u064a\u062d\u062f\u062b! It\u2019s on!   "

                    "body": "Grace McCatty had turned tearful and her Kenyan friends were torn between concern and puzzlement. \u201cI watched the Euro 2022 final in Nairobi and, when England won, I was quite emotional,\u201d says the Sunderland centre-half. \u201cThe colleagues I was with were saying: \u2018What\u2019s wrong?\u2019 But I knew just how hard everyone had worked to get there and what a huge moment it was for women\u2019s football in this country.\u201d McCatty was delighted to see Mary Earps excelling in goal throughout a tournament that culminated in the Lionesses\u2019 watershed Wembley win against Germany last July. The pair previously played together at Bristol City and McCatty is \u201clooking forward\u201d to a \u201ccatch up\u201d when Earps and her WSL-leading Manchester United teammates visit the Championship club in Sunday\u2019s Women\u2019s FA Cup fourth-round tie.  The prospect of watching England\u2019s Earps, Alessia Russo, Ella Toone and Nikita Parris on Wearside has ensured a 2,500 sell-out at the Eppleton Colliery Welfare ground in Hetton where Melanie Reay\u2019s side play. \u201cI know a lot of people are coming to see Russo and the rest of Manchester United\u2019s big names but I hope they\u2019ll enjoy watching us too,\u201d says McCatty. \u201cWe\u2019re a very young team and it\u2019s an incredible opportunity to test ourselves against some of the world\u2019s top players.\u201d Unlike most of Reay\u2019s squad, McCatty, now 33, has played against many of England\u2019s leading lights. During her days at Bristol City (then Bristol Academy), she finished on the losing side in two FA Cup finals and reached the Champions League quarter-finals. It was during her Bristol days that she fell in love with Africa and began planning a long-term future in international development. Back then the possibility of sustaining a full-time professional career as a footballer seemed remote and she combined playing with studying for a degree in coach education and sports development at Bath University.  Little did McCatty know that course would open a door to a whole new world. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved travelling and, at Bath, an opportunity came up to volunteer as a coach with an NGO in Zambia for six weeks,\u201d she says. \u201cIt changed the direction of my life. Seeing the joy football brought to children growing up in poverty made me realise there\u2019s more to the game than just playing at elite level. I realised I could use my passion for sport to achieve greater goals.\u201d After completing postgraduate studies at Southampton University she joined the Prince\u2019s Trust International and now manages projects designed to expand young people\u2019s educational employment and entrepreneurial opportunities in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. Although large parts of her job can be performed remotely from England, the Gloucester-born defender is on the ground in sub-Saharan Africa for around three-and-a-half months a year.  \u201cI spend two months there in the summer and the rest during the season when I try to travel in international breaks,\u201d says McCatty, who recently squeezed in a midweek trip to the United Nations HQ in New York between games. As if a schedule involving training three nights a week at the Academy of Light facility Reay\u2019s squad share with Sunderland\u2019s Championship men was not tough enough, she is also studying part-time at Durham University. Her PhD explores the importance of sport in education and community settings, particularly in Zambia. \u201cPlaying football helps young women and girls challenge gender norms and stereotypes,\u201d she says. \u201cIt helps them see themselves differently.\u201d Sunderland\u2019s collective self-esteem was shattered in 2018 when, with their parent club engulfed by financial problems, they were demoted two divisions. Despite Reay\u2019s side having just finished seventh in the WSL they failed to secure a licence for either the newly professional top tier or the semi-professional Championship.  Like their male counterparts, Sunderland women have since escaped the third tier. They now sit eighth in the Championship but the supportive new owners of a club which in recent years has produced a stream of senior England players \u2013 Lucy Bronze, Beth Mead, Steph Houghton and Jill Scott \u2013 will not rest until Reay\u2019s team return to the elite division. \u201cWe understand Sunderland\u2019s heritage and know we\u2019re part of a much bigger picture which is about getting this entire club back where it belongs,\u201d says McCatty. \u201cWe\u2019re lucky to have a manager of Mel\u2019s experience and ability and being integrated with the men\u2019s team is a massive help. \u201cAll the coaches share rooms, ideas and expertise and the indoor facilities mean that, regardless of the weather, we never miss training sessions. Tony Mowbray\u2019s men\u2019s first team train at different times but they\u2019re very supportive.\u201d"

                    "body": "With the end goal of the World Cup just four months away, nobody will be getting too carried away with this mid-season victory: least of all Shaun Wane. The England head coach is a firm believer in keeping his squad grounded, but this was still an impressive workout from his squad against a Combined Nations All Stars squad who had been victorious against England this time last year.\nWane has stressed his belief that the delay of the World Cup from last year to this autumn will only benefit his young squad. This was a result and a performance that suggests he may be right. With key players to come back from injury and his Australia-based heavyweights playing in the NRL unavailable for this Test, it is clear there are still several more gears for this squad to go through.\n\nNonetheless, the majority of the players who were on show here will have given Wane some food for thought over the next four months, with just one more warm-up game against Fiji to come before the World Cup begins against Samoa at St James\u2019 Park in mid-October. \u201cOverall, I thought there was more good than bad,\u201d Wane said in typically demanding fashion afterwards.\n\u201cThere are areas we can improve on but we did some good things. We were a bit clunky but we deserved the win. There are areas we can be better at, but if we\u2019d won 80-0, I\u2019d still want us to improve on things.\u201d Last year\u2019s defeat to the Combined Nations All Stars left a bitter taste in the mouth of Wane, who stressed the importance of victory here as a key step on the road to the World Cup.\nHis side were much the stronger of the two, and from the minute Jake Wardle marked his Test debut with a try after ten minutes, the hosts looked to be in control of the outcome. Wardle was one of several fringe players given an opportunity, and like the St Helens star Jack Welsby, they certainly underlined the depth Wane has at his disposal for the World Cup. That was also true for the man who scored England\u2019s second here, too.\nGeorge Williams\u2019s selection was questioned after an underwhelming run of form at club level for Warrington. But he justified Wane\u2019s faith with a well-worked try as half-time approached, finishing a fine break from the outstanding John Bateman to move England 12-0 ahead. \u201cI know George can play, I know he\u2019s doing it tough, but I trust him,\u201d Wane said of the former Wigan half-back.\nWilliams and Welsby linked up well in the halves, but with Jonny Lomax certain to feature in the World Cup if fit, that is another welcome selection headache for Wane to ponder over the summer. Bateman marked another impressive international appearance with a superb solo try after half-time, with Sam Tomkins converting all three tries to make it 18-0.\n\nThe All Stars showed plenty of fight, but ultimately there was a lack of quality in attack, even if there was an interesting cameo from Kruise Leeming, the England-eligible hooker who has performed well for Leeds this year.\nKruise was instrumental in the visitors\u2019 only try, as his pass laid the platform for Ken Sio to cross over in the final minutes. By then, though, the job had been done by Wane and his well-drilled England side."

                    "body": "  9.41pm   Summary  As always, thank you for joining me on here. You can find Aaron Bower\u2019s match report below, with plenty more reaction to follow over the coming days.  Australia will find out tomorrow if they are to face face Fiji or New Zealand in their semi-final, and I\u2019ll be back on deck for that blockbuster at the same time next week.       9.33pm    \u201cI\u2019m happy to get through injury free,\u201d Mal Meninga tells the post-match interviewer. \u201cWe were a bit clunky with the ball but I was happy with the effort.\u201d Why were Australia so error-strewn? \u201cThe ruck was slow and it was difficult to get momentum,\u201d Meninga explained. \u201cWhen we did we played some good footy. Defensively we were solid.\u201d The Kangaroo coach defended Nathan Cleary, who performed well below his Penrith Panthers standard at halfback, again citing the slow ruck ball. It will be interesting to see what noises come out of the Australian camp this week and what reins Meninga pulls ahead of the semi-final with New Zealand. Discipline needs tightening and some of these crucial playmaker combinations need plenty of work.     9.27pm    \u201cPretty special,\u201d beams Mitchell Moses in James Tedesco\u2019s jersey, \u201cthat\u2019ll go to the pool room.\u201d On the match, Moses conceded Lebanon were taught a lesson by Australia but he was pleased with the tournament overall and the impact the Cedars have left on international rugby league. There\u2019s special praise for Michael Cheika and his motivational skills, advocating for the former Wallaby coach to take a top job in the NRL someday.   Updated at 10.01pm GMT    9.23pm    Corey Parker on Australian TV reckons that was Australia\u2019s poorest display of the tournament so far.      9.21pm    \u201cWe let ourselves down by ill-discipline,\u201d admits Addo-Carr as he\u2019s presented with his player of the match award. There\u2019s plenty of delight at the five tries and his tournament form, but the focus is on the nitty gritty and the tougher tasks that lay ahead. All business from the Fox.      9.19pm    Rival international captains and former flatmates James Tedesco and Mitchell Moses pose in each other\u2019s jerseys. The scoreboard might indicate a blowout but moments like that show the importance of international rugby league and nights like this in growing the game.   Updated at 9.25pm GMT    9.17pm    14 errors from the Kangaroos tonight, which is a worry ahead of their two biggest challenges of the tournament.      9.16pm    Lebanon depart the world cup with their reputation enhanced. Michael Cheika has done a brilliant job and he motivated his troops to the end tonight, and they were rewarded with Josh Mansour\u2019s try.   Updated at 9.59pm GMT    9.15pm    Job done for Australia, but that sketchy second-half will leave Mal Meninga unsatisfied.      9.14pm   Full-time: Australia 48-4 Lebanon  The Kangaroos are safely through to the semi-finals.      9.12pm    79 mins: Not great English rugby league fans, not great.       9.11pm    77 mins: Josh Addo-Carr, despite being involved infrequently, is named player of the match. I guess five tries will do that.  In terms of pure influence I\u2019ve enjoyed Harry Grant and Isaah Yeo\u2019s games.     9.10pm    75 mins: Collins thinks he has a try after collecting a Grant grubber and sliding over, but it\u2019s harshly ruled out for a double movement, despite the Australian clearly hitting the line with enough momentum to carry him safely over.      9.06pm    72 mins: A rare heated debate in midfield with Addo-Carr taking exception to Bazzaz trying to rough up Crichton on the ground. The result is a Lebanon scrum on halfway.      9.04pm   TRY! Australia 48-4 Lebanon (Martin, 68)  And from the resulting field position Australia bully their way over. Cherry-Evans does much of the grunt work with a teasing run full of fend-offs. From the following drive the ball goes to the right and Grant times his pass perfectly for Martin to bulldoze his way over the line with red jerseys hanging off him. Martin has performed well tonight. Cleary\u2019s kicking renaissance continues. He now has 6 from 9 after his poor start.   Updated at 9.21pm GMT    9.01pm    68 mins: Despite this drop-off in intensity, moments of individual brilliance have kept Australia in the ascendancy. The latest is from Martin who strips possession of the Lebanese ball carrier and turns defence into attack with a swift rebound run.      8.59pm    67 mins: And now a penalty against Trbojevic for a late scrag on Moses after the Lebanese half had kicked ahead. Meninga will be steaming.      8.58pm    65 mins: More loose football from Australia in midfield but Grant mops up at ground level. The discipline and professionalism of the opening half has not been replicated since the interval.      8.56pm    62 mins: Australia\u2019s error count climbs to 11 with another scrappy attack ending with a spilled pill. This has been a sloppy second half from the Kangaroos, and it\u2019s reinforced with a ruck penalty gifting Lebanon a set restart 20m out. Moses goes for the Hollywood pass early in the drive out to the right but it flies over Mansour\u2019s head and into touch.      8.53pm   TRY! Australia 42-4 Lebanon (Addo-Carr, 59)  The flying Fox has five! Mitchell starts it all with great strength in contact in midfield to find the offload. Grant takes over, darting up the guts with his staccato steps. As Lebanon\u2019s defence fractures Munster spots acres of space in the left corner, jabs the ball in that direction off his boot and who\u2019s there but the fastest man in rugby league, cruising at warp speed to slide over and touch down the bouncing ball. Cleary\u2019s radar is now fixed and he nails another touchline conversion.    Updated at 9.07pm GMT    8.50pm    56 mins: Morkos is gang tackled on the right touchline and the ball spills off the island. The youngest then goes down with cramp. But yet another Kangaroos turnover invites Lebanon to counter at speed and the Cedars are soon on Australia\u2019s 10m line. A set restart gives them a very good look at a second try and as Moses dances towards the right edge that option looks on. The Eels half then earns another set when his chip is deflected back his way off a green and gold boot but Rajab loses possession in contact and the attack dissipates.     8.46pm   TRY! Australia 36-4 Lebanon (Mansour, 52)  The Cedars have a try! A full set in perfect attacking territory goes nowhere but Moses spins gold with his kick, dropping a grubber in behind Munster who makes an almighty mess of his job at fullback, allowing Mansour to charge in behind and get his fingertips to the ball. Joy for Lebanon, more questions for Meninga to ponder. Moses drags his conversion attempt across the face.      8.43pm    51 mins: Australia return possession immediately with Carrigan dropping the ball as his eyes are drawn to the oncoming tackler before securing the pass. A scrappy second-half so far. The Kangaroos need a rev up.      8.42pm    50 mins: A rare break from the Cedars! Moses carries to the right touchline near halfway and as contact looms he chips ahead, only to be taken out off the ball by Addo-Carr. The tournament\u2019s leading try-scorer is lucky to avoid a yellow card for a professional foul. Unfortunately for Lebanon as the attacking set gets underway on the 20m line Robinson makes a mess of the play-the-ball and the threat peters out.      8.39pm    48 mins: No serious concern over Tedesco, by the way, who is on the bench nursing a corked left thigh. Nothing serious.      8.38pm   TRY! Australia 36-0 Lebanon (Addo-Carr, 45)  Calamitous from the Cedars. 10m out from their own line Robinson spins an awful pass from dummy half that bounces in front of Moses and skids towards Mansour who fumbles under pressure from Mitchell. Addo-Carr picks up the scraps and dabs down for his fourth try of the night. That was demoralising for Lebanon. Cleary scrapes over a touchline conversion that will boost his confidence.    Updated at 8.57pm GMT    8.36pm    44 mins: A good defensive set from Lebanon forces Cleary into a hurried kick \u2013 and not for the first time tonight he fails to execute, shanking a bomb with no distance. This has not been Cleary\u2019s night to command the halfback jersey.     8.34pm    42 mins: Australia are immediately on the front foot. Grant makes a break from dummy half, a move immediately followed by Cherry-Evans, on at the interval for Tedesco. That means all of Cherry-Evans, Grant, Munster, and Cleary are on the park together \u2013 Munster now at fullback.  Updated at 8.34pm GMT    8.32pm    The sides are back out for the second-half. Australia, and Addo-Carr in particular will be chasing records. Mal Meninga will be hoping to avoid injuries.     8.28pm    For their part, Lebanon started strongly, and dismissed the early try to remain in touch for the next ten or so minutes. Even then, as Australia racked up the points the discipline and commitment was obvious. Towards half-time fatigue began to kick in and they will need to remain focussed to avoid being humiliated in the final quarter.   Updated at 8.29pm GMT    8.26pm    Very professional and efficient from Australia in that half. Isaah Yeo has led from the front with a superb display that has allowed the Kangaroos to dominate field position with great momentum with ball in hand. The backs have done the business too with the finishing, with Addo-Carr capturing the headlines with his scintillating pace. It hasn\u2019t all been positive though. Nathan Cleary\u2019s goal-kicking has been poor and he, Tedesco and Grant all failed to execute kicks out of hand. There have also been enough skill errors to keep Meninga busy on the training ground working on his combinations.     8.19pm   Half-time: Australia 30-0 Lebanon  As expected the Kangaroos are well on top in Huddersfield. A Josh Addo-Carr hat-trick has Australia heading towards a semi-final date with the Kiwis at full pace.     8.18pm    40 mins: Meninga will be thrilled by Australia\u2019s work-rate tonight. Despite the scoreline the pressure has been unrelenting and again defence is turned into attack with a superb kick and chase with Kiraz bundled into touch by a gang led by Martin to deliver a set 20m from Lebanon\u2019s line. However, Mitchell cannot capitalise and the whistle for the error becomes the signal for half-time.     8.15pm    38 mins: Lebanon\u2019s previous attack ends with a debatable knock-on call against Australia inviting a scrum 15m out. Moses orchestrates a couple of neat set-plays behind the ruck but Australia\u2019s defensive line is solid. On the last Moses chips to the left corner but the kick lacks penetration and the Kangaroos escape.      8.13pm         8.13pm    36 mins: Lebanon are starting to unravel. A ruck infringement concedes a set restart and Australia head back on attack. That is until Mansour rearranges Munster\u2019s ribcage with a massive hit! That was a mighty crunching tackle with the five-eighth completely exposed. It reinvigorates the Cedars and they make ground down the left edge. Space opens up on the right but the scramble defence from the Kangaroos is desperate enough and Morkos doesn\u2019t have room to get around the outside.      8.09pm   TRY! Australia 30-0 Lebanon (Murray, 33)  Doueihi executes one of the wildest restarts you\u2019ll ever see. He tried to drill a right-angle stinger into touch on the bounce but instead just smashes a head-high bullet out on the full about 20 rows back! Not long afterwards Murray gets his second try in as many sets. Routine for Australia who rumble downfield then let Grant go to work around the ruck. Lebanon lose discipline with their try-line defence and Murray dives through almost unopposed. Cleary kicks his second conversion in quick succession.   Updated at 8.38pm GMT    8.06pm   TRY! Australia 24-0 Lebanon (Murray, 30)  Like a hot knife through butter. Lovely running rugby league and great hands from the Kangaroos for try number five. Cleary was instrumental with a beautifully timed pass to Crichton on the burst and after the Rooster made most of the ground the Bunny Murray finishes the job under the posts.      8.02pm    29 mins: A Munster handling error in attack then a ruck penalty in defence allows Lebanon into attacking territory for the first time in an age. Doueihi almost breaks the line 15m out then Moses is adamant his grubber on the last should return to Lebanese hands after ricocheting off Yeo\u2019s boot. The on-field call went Australia\u2019s way prompting Moses to challenge but the video referee isn\u2019t interested.      8.00pm   TRY! Australia 18-0 Lebanon (Mitchell, 24)  Australia are executing their game-plan superbly. Their tackle pressure is good, their kicking choices are conservative, errors are absent, and when opportunities have presented themselves they have been taken. Aside from Addo-Carr\u2019s hat-trick and Tedesco\u2019s menace, Yeo has been the standout charging through the middle of the park and it\u2019s another of his barnstorming runs that sets up try number four. Following Yeo\u2019s burst Australia target the right corner but are held up inches short. The ball is recycled to the left and when it reaches Mitchell the Rabbitoh centre decides it\u2019s try-time, pinning his ears back, running outside his man and then straight and over the fullback like a snow plough. That was brute force to complement superb skill. Cleary misses his third kick from four. This one falls short of the crossbar despite tracking on line. Maybe it\u2019s time for Valentine Holmes to be handed the tee?    Updated at 8.06pm GMT    7.54pm   TRY! Australia 14-0 Lebanon (Addo-Carr, 19)  Yeo again drives Australia downfield but Kiraz does superbly under the high ball under pressure to clear for Lebanon. Until he doesn\u2019t\u2026 oh dear, poor Kiraz. After doing brilliantly in the air he\u2019s stripped 1-1 on the ground by Munster with the Queenslander immediately flicking a one-handed backhand pass to his outside where Addo-Carr finishes a 20-minute hat-trick! Cleary misses his second conversion attempt out of three. This was a poor strike that never threatened the uprights.   Updated at 8.04pm GMT    7.51pm   TRY! Australia 10-0 Lebanon (Addo-Carr, 17)  Addo-Carr almost wriggles through the corridor in a carry to relieve the pressure on the middle forwards. Tedesco is next up with the tactic from dummy-half \u2013 and he does break through! Does he have support on his inside shoulder? Of course he does, and it\u2019s Addo-Carr galloping at speed to accept the simple assist and cross for his second of the night and eighth of the competition. Cleary can\u2019t miss his kick from in front of the posts.    Updated at 9.30pm GMT    7.48pm    14 mins: Moses fluffs his first kick of the night, but he was unfortunate not to be awarded a penalty for obstruction with Trbojevic blocking his way as he tried to run onto his own chip through. After a run of conservative sets Australia smell blood again and Yeo sets up dangerous field position but as the ball spins to Mitchell on the left 19-year-old Brad Morkos ragdolls his more celebrated opponent into touch. Lebanon are standing their ground well despite that early try.      7.45pm    12 mins: Moses again keeps Lebanon in good field position with a huge bomb that has enough hang time for the chasing pack to nail Addo-Carr behind his 10m line. Australia again play risk averse counterattacking football, following their coach\u2019s instructions of discipline and professionalism.      7.43pm    10 mins: Lebanon grind to halfway and Tasipale adds some gloss to the set with a linebreak. Moses takes over and launches a menacing swirling bomb that Holmes spills under pressure but Australia are fortunate to see the ball bounce backwards and safely to Tedesco. The Kangaroos take no risks and play the clearing set for territory behind Cleary\u2019s boot.      7.41pm    7 mins: Australia are back on the attack immediately courtesy of an offside against the Cedars early in the restart set. It would have been a six-again in the NRL but in Huddersfield it allows a mighty boot downfield and A1 attacking position. The Kangaroos are soon camped inside Lebanon\u2019s 20m zone but Grant tries to be too cute too soon and fails to execute his grubber, turning over possession.     7.39pm   TRY! Australia 4-0 Lebanon (Addo-Carr, 5)  A full set from halfway builds nicely for Lebanon but the grubber on the last tackle is way too heavy off the boot and the danger evaporates. In response Holmes quickly darts 30m to put Australia on the front foot. The Kangaroos go through hands to the right with Tedesco sniping. Then they return to the left where Munster opens the field with a beautiful cutout pass. Mitchell doesn\u2019t hang around and draws the tackler before offloading to Addo-Carr and the blistering winger does the rest, hugging the whitewash and diving full length to touch over in the corner under pressure from Mansour. Textbook backline rugby league. Cleary strikes the post with the touchline conversion.   Updated at 8.00pm GMT    7.34pm    2 mins: Australia\u2019s first tackle drives Lebanon back five metres post contact. The Cedars barely cross the gainline by tackle four but Rahme finally gives a shunt and Moses kicks long downfield. That will settle the nerves. Nothing flash from the Kangaroos as they rumble to halfway\u2026 but Cleary, the most dangerous kicker in rugby league, shanks his bomb horribly and it flies miles out on the full over the right touchline. Under no pressure that was a shocker on a big night for the NSW half.      7.31pm   Kick-off  Englishman Chris Kendall blows his whistle, Australian James Tedesco boots the first quarter-final underway.      7.29pm    Sponsored by Sharp electronics, Lebanon\u2019s jersey is redolent of a knock-off version of a mid-90s Manchester United football kit you might find in a disreputable street market.      7.27pm    The two sides are making their way out onto the Kirklees Stadium turf. Lebanon are top to toe in red, led out by Mitchell Moses. His former flatmate James Tedesco is at the front of the Australian parade. The Kangaroos are in their familiar green uniform with gold chevrons.    Updated at 7.45pm GMT    7.23pm         7.21pm    Mal Meninga has had a few words ahead of kick-off and the Australian coach played everything with a straight bat. \u201cWe\u2019re after a professional performance\u201d he said, before padding out some sentences around the keywords discipline, pressure and process. There was a vote of confidence in Nathan Cleary at halfback, indicating he\u2019s not expecting the Penrith playmaker to do anything dramatic, simply \u201cplay how we want to play,\u201d and lead the Kangaroos around the park. There was a fitness update too with Meninga indicating there are no injury worries in the camp.      7.16pm    Lebanon might have little chance in Huddersfield tonight but their presence is significant for the growth of international rugby league, as Gavin Willacy reports.  The main purpose of a World Cup is to grow the game, raise awareness and generate income that can be used to promote the sport to new audiences and territories. The performances of Lebanon and \u2013 despite their thrashings in the final group games, Greece and Jamaica \u2013 should have done that.       7.15pm    It\u2019s chilly in Huddersfield tonight but otherwise conditions are not too bad. There\u2019s the chance of a shower and bit of a westerly breeze, but nothing for players of this calibre to worry about.       7.11pm    Michael Cheika found time in his crazy schedule to speak to Daniel Gallan about life as a dual-code coach and what being involved with Lebanon means to him.  It\u2019s about my heritage and making a difference. This is an opportunity to do something special. All the boys in the team feel that. We know we\u2019re representing something bigger than ourselves.       7.08pm         7.08pm   Lebanon XIII  Michael Cheika will need all his creativity and coaching nous to convince his charges they can mix it with the best. Parramatta halfback Mitchell Moses will be vital orchestrating play, keeping the Cedars moving, and keeping them in touch with his boot. 1. Jacob Kiraz2. Josh Mansour4. Brad Morkos16.

His challenge is fitting it all into a cohesive unit. This is especially the case in the halves where both State of Origin No 7s are battling for the Kangaroo jersey. After rotating Nathan Cleary and Daly Cherry-Evans, Meninga has tonight named both in his squad with the versatile Ben Hunt given a night off, meaning Cherry-Evans is likely to give Harry Grant a chop out at hooker. Other than Hunt, Reagan Campbell-Gillard is probably the only guaranteed first-17 player absent.  1. James Tedesco4. Valentine Holmes 10. Jack Wighton8. Latrell Mitchell9. Josh Addo-Carr19.

Australia vs Lebanon kicks off at John Smith\u2019s Stadium in Huddersfield at 7:30pm GMT (6:30am AEDT). If you\u2019ve landed here looking for a nail-biter I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ve come to the wrong place. Last-eight contests in the world cup of a major sport rarely begin so one-sided. The Kangaroos have won 11 of the 15 rugby league world cups (including eight of the past nine), finishing runners-up on three of the four times they missed out. The NRL is the strongest domestic competition and State of Origin the gold standard in demonstrating a player\u2019s aptitude for international representation. By contrast, Lebanon are competing in only their third world cup, during which they have secured just their second and third match wins. The Cedars squad contains a decent number of NRL regulars, but also a smattering of Sydney grade footballers. On paper it is a mismatch. But that doesn\u2019t mean it is a contest without merit. In the context of this tournament Mal Meninga still has questions to answer around the balance of his 17, especially in the playmaker roles. Next up are New Zealand, an opponent Meninga will not want to experiment against, and if they pass that assignment a potential final against an England outfit backed by a partisan crowd. This is the final dress rehearsal.   Lebanon may be fighting out of their weight division today but they embody the growth of rugby league outside the game\u2019s narrow heartlands, and their development \u2013 like that of Greece and Italy and the rest \u2013 is important for the future of the sport. The Cedars also employ as coach Michael Cheika, one of the most interesting figures in rugby; league and union. After tidying up his duties in West Yorkshire, Cheika, the Sydney-born son of Lebanese parents, will head to Twickenham to coach Argentina\u2019s Pumas against England.  I\u2019ll be back shortly. In the meantime, enjoy the insight below into the fascinating Lebanon coach. And remember, you can contribute throughout the match by sending me an email or directing any tweets to @JPHowcroft.   "

                    "body": "The Matildas\u2019 opening Women\u2019s World Cup match has been moved across Sydney from the new $828m Allianz Stadium to Accor Stadium as Fifa seek to capitalise on \u201csignificant interest\u201d in tickets for the tournament co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand. A bumper opening matchday could now attract more than 100,000 fans, with Auckland to host the opening ceremony and first match between New Zealand and Norway at Eden Park, before Australia kick off their Group B campaign against the Republic of Ireland later on 20 July. Allianz Stadium, which was built at great expense and opened to the public in August last year, holds 42,500. Accor Stadium, the old Olympic stadium in the city\u2019s inner west and the tournament\u2019s largest venue with a capacity of 83,500, had been slated to host knockout matches only, including the final on 20 August.  Given the popularity of the Matildas, coupled with strong interest from a sizeable expat Irish community in Sydney, early ticket sales at the smaller Moore Park venue were strong and the first allocation sold out quickly. There had been growing support to make the switch, with Football Australia backing the move that will now give roughly another 40,000 fans an opportunity to watch Sam Kerr and her team kick off their campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s very exciting news,\u201d FA CEO James Johnson said. \u201cThe move from Sydney Football Stadium to Stadium Australia is big for Australian football and highlights the confidence which we have in the Matildas to draw a huge crowd for the first match of the tournament in Australia.\u201d  With the venue change now confirmed, attendance records could be broken at the tournament, with the previous benchmark for a women\u2019s football match on Australian soil set in 2021, when 36,109 watched the Matildas take on USA. A sell-out would see the Matildas enter the top five of women\u2019s football attendances of all time (a Champions League tie between Barcelona and Wolfsburg at the Camp Nou holds the record of 91,648), and go third on the World Cup list, behind two matches at the 1999 tournament which both attracted 90,185 at the Rose Bowl. Tickets already bought for the match at Allianz Stadium will remain valid for Accor, and those who are unable to accommodate the switch will be refunded, Fifa said. Earlier this month, Fifa announced it had sold more than half a million tickets for the tournament with six months to go before the big kick-off \u2013 a positive start to ticket sales, although still some way off the intended target."

                    "body": "Good morning. Harry and Meghan\u2019s self-titled docuseries has dominated the attention of the public, the media and the British establishment for the past week, with a mix of frenzied condemnation and support. Countless column inches have been dedicated to the documentary itself, what it means for the future of the monarchy and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex themselves \u2013 now a fully fledged celebrity couple in their own right. But there\u2019s another figure who has unequivocally come out on top from all this: Netflix. The streaming giant said that 28m households have watched the series so far, making it their most watched documentary. Viewers spent 81.55m hours watching the first three episodes in the first four days of its release. Whether this has translated into an increase in subscribers is a question that is yet to be answered, but it is clear that, after a rocky start to the year, Netflix\u2019s slew of smash shows in 2022 (Stranger Things season four, Dahmer and Tim Burton\u2019s spin on the Addams Family, Wednesday) has allowed the company to regain momentum. I spoke to the Guardian\u2019s media editor, Jim Waterson, about what this series could indicate about the future of Netflix, and streaming more broadly. That\u2019s right after the headlines. Five big stories  Russia | In an interview with the Guardian, Ukrainian defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, has said that Vladimir Putin is preparing for a major new offensive, despite a series of humiliating setbacks on the battlefield in recent months. UK news | The four boys who died after falling through ice into a lake in Solihull have been named as brothers Finlay and Samuel Butler, their cousin Thomas Stewart, and Jack Johnson. Their parents have said: \u201cAs a family we are devastated at the loss of our beautiful boys \u2026 We would like to thank the emergency services for all they did.\u201d Politics | Labour has held onto the Greater Manchester constituency Stretford and Urmston in a byelection called after the sitting MP quit to become Andy Burnham\u2019s mayoral deputy. Andrew Western won with a majority of 9,906 and has pledged to fight for properly funded services.  Dominic Raab | A civil service survey shows that a third of staff in ministerial private offices at Dominic Raab\u2019s department have claimed to have been bullied or harassed while working in their current roles in the past year. Twitter | Journalists who reported on Twitter and its new chief executive Elon Musk were suspended or banned from the platform without explanation on Thursday. Reporters from CNN, the Washington Post, and the New York Times were among those suspended.  In depth: \u2018Has this brought in subscribers? What Netflix wants is growth\u2019  After an incessant promotional tour, Netflix got me. I too have watched all six episodes of the Harry &amp; Meghan documentary (if my editor is reading, I finished the final three after writing the bulk of this newsletter). While they perhaps were not the most revelatory hours of documentary film-making, it was an interesting insight into the lives of these royals turned celebs. It\u2019s success is an indication that Netflix still has some of its hit-making magic. And so, even though many have been sounding the streaming company\u2019s death knell, it seems pretty clear that it is not going anywhere any time soon. *** Is Netflix reliant on a few big hitters? Netflix, which has historically been guarded about its viewing figures, has recently begun sharing the numbers, opening their ratings up to scrutiny in the same way traditional TV does. While it\u2019s not quite at the Princess Diana Panorama interview levels of viewing figures, Jim says, it \u201cstill puts it up there with what you\u2019d expect a major TV channel like ITV or BBC One to get on a weeknight\u201d. And it\u2019s not just this docuseries that has lifted Netflix out from under its early-year horror show: there was the release of a new season of its fantasy behemoth, Stranger Things, the crime-thriller series Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story, and, its latest massive hit, Wednesday. But these shows are few and far between: this year Netflix was set to release 398 new original titles and most of them have simply fallen into the ether, quietly hidden away (like an embarrassing godmother) in the dank recesses of the site. \u201cThe important question for Netflix is whether this has brought in any new subscribers, because what they want is growth,\u201d Jim says. \u201cAn enormous number of people already have access to Netflix in the UK \u2013 well over half the population \u2013 but whether that translates into growing revenue is another thing. Once you hit those sorts of numbers, it\u2019s quite hard to get more people to sign up because there just aren\u2019t that many to convert.\u201d To tackle this problem, Netflix has suggested that there will be a crackdown on password sharing early next year. But it\u2019s unclear how this would work and how effective it will be. *** Ads are back  After a decade of avoiding intrusive and, frankly annoying, ads while watching our favourite films and shows, they seem to be making a comeback, because, ultimately, the success of documentaries like Harry &amp; Meghan are hard to replicate and very expensive to make. The era of cheap, high quality content for us consumers is over \u2013 streaming services are saying that we either need to cough up the money or suffer through ads. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign that there\u2019s a weakness in the business model and that you need supplementary levels. Ads make money because advertisers still want to reach mass audiences, and video ads are where you can make real money,\u201d says Jim. And it\u2019s not just Netflix \u2013 almost every player in the industry has started to embrace the advertising model, from Amazon, with its Freevee service, to HBO in the US, which is shifting a chunk of its back catalogue off its paid for service, and on to free, ad-supported channels broadcast by the network\u2019s owner, Discovery. Like many other industries that boomed during the digital takeover, the message is clear: the party is over. \u201cThese rapid growth areas are starting to end for streamers,\u201d says Jim. \u201cThey\u2019re becoming boring old companies that need to start showing they can make a profit.\u201d *** A new era For several years now, customers have been complaining that there are simply too many streaming services, competing for a dwindling subscriber base. \u201cI think the end game is consolidation, where you end up with one subscription giving you access to a lot of things \u2013 it feels like consumer pressure will start to build towards that,\u201d Jim says. And that seems to be already happening: Disney has bought up Hulu and 21st Century Fox in recent years. In the UK, you get Paramount+ with a Sky subscription. And the merger between Warner Bros. and Discovery has already had huge implications for HBO and DC (which controls superhero franchises like Batman and Superman), from the aforementioned shows shifting off the platform to completed films being cancelled before release as a tax write-off. This consolidation process doesn\u2019t look like it is slowing down. The future is a few companies, owning much of the content we watch, moving away from binging and back to weekly drops, and forcing us all to watch advertising. Streaming is beginning to look an awful lot like the old-fashioned analogue TV it was supposed to replace.

                    "body": "Good morning. If you are an England fan contemplating burying your head under the duvet until Christmas after Saturday\u2019s heartwrenching World Cup defeat, your plan has this to be said for it: those who do venture beyond their front doors look likely to be met by a picture of chaos. After ministers yesterday rebuffed an offer by nursing unions to suspend talks in return for new pay negotiations, and with Cobra meetings due today to work through controversial contingency plans involving the military, there is little reason to expect a reprieve from planned strikes. Industrial action already underway in December among bus, rail and postal workers will intensify and broaden this week to others in the public sector including ambulance drivers, baggage handlers, and driving examiners. The result will be some of the most significant disruption to the British economy in recent memory. The strikes are a response to limited pay rises set against a backdrop of sharply rising inflation that the Trades Union Congress says has left key public sector workers \u00a3180 a month worse off than a year ago - and they have been met with a barrage of criticism that casts those walking out as irresponsible, selfish and unrealistic. Whether you\u2019re hiding at home or venturing into the world this week, today\u2019s newsletter will try to help you assess those claims against the underlying reality. Here are the headlines. Five big stories  Solihull lake | Four children have been taken to hospital in cardiac arrest and are in critical condition after falling through the ice on a lake in Solihull. Police continued rescue operations overnight with reports a further two children may be missing. Cold weather | UK power prices have hit record levels as an icy cold snap and a fall in supplies of electricity generated by wind power have combined to push up wholesale costs. Meanwhile, further travel disruption is expected this week with temperatures forecast to stay well below freezing overnight. Lockerbie | A Libyan accused of preparing the bomb that killed 270 people aboard Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988 is now in US custody, officials have confirmed. Mohammed Abouagela Masud, a Libyan intelligence official, is reported to have been extradited to the US. Jersey explosion | Nine people are feared dead and a criminal investigation could be launched after a suspected gas explosion destroyed a block of flats in Jersey\u2019s capital, St Helier. An inquiry is under way into the actions of the fire service after residents reported a gas leak less than eight hours before the blast. European Union | Belgian prosecutors investigating allegations that Qatar has sought to influence EU policy by bribing European parliament officials have charged four people with money laundering, corruption and participating in a criminal organisation. A Qatari official denied accusations of possible misconduct.  In depth: \u2018NHS strikes are dangerous\u2019 and other claims about industrial action  *** \u2018This is effectively a general strike\u2019 \u201cThis is looking increasingly like a general strike\u201d \u2013 Stephen Glover, Daily Mail, 7 December \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a de facto general strike taking place by the amount of disputes\u201d \u2013 Dave Ward, CWU general secretary, 3 December Everyone agrees that industrial action in the weeks running up to Christmas will have a significant impact. But claims from both sides that the whole economy will grind to a halt in a \u201cgeneral strike\u201d exaggerate the parallels with the past. As this explainer from Philip Inman sets out, it used to be possible for the Trades Union Congress to coordinate a general strike without ballots in each area. But now the law bans strikes without a successful ballot in an individual workplace. It might still be possible for a \u201cde facto general strike\u201d to happen if enough industries succeeded in bringing industrial action at the same time. But union representation in the UK since the Winter of Discontent in 1978 and 1979 has fallen significantly, from around 50% in 1979 to around 23% in 2021, although it is still around 50% in the public sector. The reality of the 1979 comparison is made clear in Richard Partington\u2019s piece from 8 December, which points out that while the number of working days lost this year could reach 1.74m, in September 1979 alone, 12m days were lost. *** \u2018Striking workers are being greedy and their demands are unaffordable\u2019 \u201cWhere is [Rishi Sunak\u2019s] big effort to mobilise the country against these greedy union extremists?\u201d \u2013 Douglas Murray, The Sun, 8 December \u201cInflation-matching or inflation-busting pay rises are unaffordable \u2026 There simply isn\u2019t the money.\u201d Transport secretary Mark Harper, Sky News, 27 November Critics of striking workers often present their pay demands as excessive in a time of economic difficulty. But in this analysis from July, Ashley Kirk sets out Office for National Statistics data that shows real public sector pay has fallen by 4.3% since the 2009 financial crisis. Meanwhile, the IFS says, real private sector pay has risen by 4.3% since 2010. New analysis published by the TUC today says that 2022 has been the worst year for real pay growth for almost 50 years. Pay demands should also be set against the impact of inflation, which is quickly eroding the value of even generous-sounding settlements. For example, an offer to rail workers described as \u201c8%\u201d in a Daily Telegraph headline on 4 December is spread over two years, making it 4% in reality, against the most recent inflation figure of 11.1%. One way to get at the question of affordability is to examine the government\u2019s claims of the cost to taxpayers. Rishi Sunak claims that it would cost about \u00a31,000 extra per household to give pay rises offsetting 10% inflation this year. But Ben Zaranko of the Institute for Fiscal Studies points out in this BBC Reality Check piece that once you factor in the 3% average pay rises for public sector workers already budgeted for 2022-23, the real \u201cextra\u201d cost is around \u00a3640 per household, about a third of which would be returned in tax. The question of whether a bit over \u00a3400 per household is affordable \u2013 with the greatest burden falling on the richest \u2013 is ultimately a political judgment. We can also ask whether it is true, as is often claimed, that pay rises will stoke inflation. This piece by Richard Partington yesterday argues that fears a \u201cwage-price spiral\u201d is under way are overplayed. The Bank of England estimates holding overall wage growth to 2.5% could reduce inflation by 1.5 percentage points \u2013 \u201ca drop in the ocean\u201d compared to the impact of soaring energy prices. *** \u2018NHS strikes are putting people in danger\u2019  \u201c[Ambulance staff] joined the service to save lives, not put them at risk\u201d \u2013 Conservative MP Mike Penning, Daily Mail, 6 December \u201cIt will cause pain and discomfort for people and put lives at risk\u201d \u2013 Whitehall source, Daily Express, 6 December One common theme of coverage of planned strikes by nurses and other NHS workers is a possible risk to patient safety \u2013 and there will clearly be some discomfort or delay as a result of the action. But it is another step to suggest that lives will be put at risk. The \u201clife-preserving care model\u201d that guides Royal College of Nursing industrial action excludes emergency interventions to save lives or prevent disability from strikes as well as other situations where lives could be put at risk. Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, has urged urgent clarification on exemptions but told the BBC strike days would \u201cfeel like a weekend or bank holiday\u201d. The evidence from previous strikes suggests that it is possible to take industrial action without jeopardising safety. An Independent article published in August pointed to a 2018 BMJ study which found no measurable impact on mortality during junior doctors\u2019 strikes in 2016, although it added that there were fewer A&amp;E admissions and attendances. A strike in Northern Ireland in 2019 ended with \u201cno adverse incidents\u201d for patients, the RCN says. *** \u2018Negotiating is out of the government\u2019s control\u2019 \u201cMy role is to facilitate and support \u2013 not negotiate.\u201d \u2013 Mark Harper, letter to RMT general secretary Mick Lynch, 29 November \u201cThe essential discussions have to occur between the rail operating companies, Network Rail and the unions.\u201d \u2013 work and pensions secretary Mel Stride, TalkTV, 23 November Government ministers say that they stay out of negotiations, and that their hands are tied by independent pay bodies \u2013 with the government yesterday refusing the nursing union\u2019s request to negotiate for that reason. But there are reasons to be sceptical about that account. On Thursday, the FT reported that employers had planned to offer the RMT a 10% pay rise over two years, only for the government to intervene. The eventual offer was 8% over two years, tied to the introduction of driver-only trains. That was not denied by the Department for Transport, while the FT quotes an \u201cindustry figure\u201d as calling the intervention a \u201cclumsy mis-step\u201d that exacerbated the situation. *** \u2018The public opposes strikes\u2019 \u201cThe put-upon public are turning against militant unions set on ruining Christmas.\u201d \u2013 report in the Sun, 6 December \u201cCivil servants shouldn\u2019t expect sympathy for their strikes from the working taxpayers who pay their wages.\u201d \u2013 John O\u2019Connell, chief executive of the TaxPayers Alliance, 10 November Opponents of strikes naturally wish to present themselves as the voices of ordinary working people. But the reality of the polling is more complicated. Last week, for example, a YouGov poll found that only 37% of people support striking rail workers, against 51% opposed. But an Observer poll found 40% blaming the government and rail companies, with 37% holding unions responsible \u2013 and also showed big majorities supporting nurses. If that picture is mixed, that is probably worse news for the government than unions, who certainly want public backing but ultimately answer only to their membership. The battleground now is whether the reality of strikes in the run-up to Christmas turn voters against the unions \u2013 or reinforces the sense that industrial action is part of a wider picture of government incompetence. Guardian and Observer charity appeal 2022  The theme of the Guardian and Observer charity appeal 2022 is the cost of living crisis, with two charities at the heart of the voluntary response to rising poverty and hardship the beneficiaries.

Archie  World Cup  Many England fans may not have the stomach for it so soon after the gutting 2-1 defeat to France in Saturday\u2019s quarter-final, but for those that do, the future of Gareth Southgate is one of the central questions arising from his side\u2019s exit from the tournament, with England\u2019s manager saying he feels \u201cconflicted\u201d about his future. Jacob Steinberg writes that \u201cSouthgate sounded ready to walk away\u201d in his post-match press conference but writes that he should \u201clisten to Kane, Rice and Harry Maguire calling for him to stay\u201d. Barney Ronay writes that the defeat was \u201cthat rare thing, a largely blameless exit\u201d and argues that abuse of Southgate \u201cis by now verging on the bizarre\u201d. Meanwhile, David Hytner writes that Harry Kane appeared \u201ca hollowed-out version\u201d of himself after his missed second penalty, but adds: \u201cHe is famously single-minded and resilient and there is no doubt he will want to get back on the pitch as soon as possible.\u201d The only sliver of good news for the England camp was their successful adoption of Dave, a stray tabby they befriended at their training base. Next up are the two semi-finals, Argentina against Croatia on Tuesday night and France against Morocco on Wednesday. Eric Devin and Adam White explain how Antoine Griezmann could be key to France\u2019s prospects, while Nick Ames says that this Morocco side has \u201crewritten the rules of possibility\u201d for underdogs. Will Magee writes about how the Moroccan team\u2019s mothers have taken centre stage in their celebrations. --- For all the latest on Qatar, from the scandals to the scores, sign up to Football Daily \u2013 our free, sometimes funny, newsletter The front pages  The Guardian leads with \u201cTories under fire over plans for military to act as \u2018strike breakers\u2019\u201d, with warnings that British troops are being used too often to bail out ministers unable to resolve disputes.

Should have done better as last tackler for Van der Merwe\u2019s try. 5 Replacements: Ben Earl (for Dombrandt, 56) Lively 7, Ben Youngs (for Van Poortvliet, 59) Kicked poorly 5, Mako Vunipola (for Genge, 61) Threw himself about 6, Dan Cole (for Sinckler, 61) Improved scrum 7, Nick Isiekwe (for Curry, 61) n/a, Anthony Watson (for Hassell-Collins, 65) n/a, Ollie Lawrence (for Marchant, 76) Excellent 7  Scotland 15 Stuart Hogg Kicked well but mixed things up too. Made a great turnover on Hassell-Collins. Poor pass to Steyn with Scotland threatening. 7 14 Kyle Steyn Fine break down the right in the second half but could not gather Hogg\u2019s return pass. Similar story with Russell\u2019s crossfield kick. 7 13 Huw Jones Loves a try against England and got the opener by plunging on Tuipulotu\u2019s grubber. Justified Townsend\u2019s decision to pick him. 8 12 Sione Tuipulotu Flawless. Precise kick for Jones\u2019s try and always picked the right pass. Polished in every facet of the game. 9 11 Duhan van der Merwe Stunning try from halfway, beating five defenders. Out of position for Malins\u2019 first try but came up with the winning score. 8 10 Finn Russell Came under pressure when kicking from hand but looked to make things happen. Two fine passes in buildup to winning try. 8 9 Ben White Opportunistic try, finished with the zip that sums him up. Another eye-catching selection that paid off handsomely. 7  1 Pierre Schoeman Sounds as if he\u2019s being booed, rather than affectionately lauded as \u201cSchoe\u201d. Made some decent yards with ball in hand. 7 2 George Turner Went for the overthrown lineout more than once but showed an invention and a confidence that coursed through this Scotland side. 7 3 WP Nel Demonstrated that there is no substitute for experience, particularly at the scrum where he got the better of Genge. 7 4 Richie Gray Preferred to his younger brother and shone, particularly in the buildup to winning try. One penalty against his name. 9 5 Grant Gilchrist Messy moment at the lineout and made little impact in the loose before he was replaced. Made his tackles though. 6 6 Jamie Ritchie (capt) Sloppy knock-on early in the first half when his side were well placed but stepped up his influence as the match wore on. 9 7 Luke Crosbie Talked up in the bulidup after a couple of excellent showings against Saracens but did not make such an impact here. 6 8 Matt Fagerson Stuck to the task well and must take credit for the way that Scotland did not panic before pouncing for the victory. 7 Replacements: Fraser Brown (for Turner, 59) Reliable 6, Simon Berghan (for Nel, 59) Brought some grunt 6, Jack Dempsey (for Crosbie, 59) One shocking pass 5, Jonny Gray (for Gilchrist, 66) Industrious 7, Jamie Bhatti (for Schoeman, 66) n/a, Blair Kinghorn (for Hogg, 66) 7, George Horne (for White, 70) 7, Chris Harris (for Jones, 76) n/a"

                    "body": "A host of Brazilian celebrities, led by the three-time World Cup winner Pel\u00e9, have joined calls for authorities to intensify their search for a British journalist and Brazilian Indigenous advocate missing in the Amazon rainforest. Pel\u00e9, now 81 and considered one of the greatest players of all time, retweeted a video made by Phillips\u2019s wife appealing for more urgency in the search for her husband and Bruno Pereira. \u201cThe fight for the preservation of the Amazon forest and of the Indigenous groups belongs to all of us,\u201d the former Santos legend wrote on Twitter. \u201cI am moved by the disappearance of Dom Phillips and Bruno Ferreira, who dedicate their lives to this cause. I join the many voices that make the appeal to intensify the search.\u201d  His words came as authorities in the remote region on Brazil\u2019s border with Peru announced they had arrested a man in possession of arms and ammunition. The suspect was not named but police earlier said they had detained Amarildo da Costa de Oliveira. He was reported to have threatened Phillips, Pereira and a group of 13 Indigenous people on Saturday morning as they travelled in the Vale do Javari region. A witness to the encounter told the Guardian that Da Costa and two other armed men threatened the group while they stopped at the side of the Itaqua\u00ed river in Amazonas state. Police said they could not yet tie the suspect to the pair\u2019s disappearance. \u201cWe have material that makes us suspect there is a link to the fact,\u201d said Carlos Alberto Mansur, Amazonas state police chief. \u201cBut it\u2019s still just a suspicion. It\u2019s still being investigated.\u201d \u201cFor now, our main job is searching and our hope is still to find them alive. That they had a problem with their boat, that they went up a river, that they are lost in the jungle. It\u2019s the jungle, it\u2019s a very complex area. \u201cWe still don\u2019t have a strong indication a crime was committed.\u201d Pereira, 41, a longtime advocate of the Indigenous tribes in a vast and remote jungle area, had received death threats for his work helping protect Indigenous groups from drug traffickers and illegal miners, loggers and hunters who covet land in a region rich with natural resources. He and Phillips were last seen on Sunday morning while traveling by boat through the Javari region of Amazonas state. They were returning from a two-day reporting trip but did not arrive as scheduled at the town of Atalaia do Norte. Phillips, a longtime contributor to the Guardian, the Washington Post and other international publications, was researching a book on sustainable development in the region. He received a fellowship from the Alicia Patterson Foundation to write the book, and was aiming to finish it by the end of this year. On Tuesday his wife Alessandra Sampaio made an emotional appeal for authorities to speed up their search, and as the case hit the headlines in Brazil personalities from the worlds of sports, culture and media joined in. Dr Drauzio Varella, a public health expert and broadcaster who is one of Brazil\u2019s best-loved personalities, called Phillips \u201chighly serious\u201d and said: \u201cWe need to clarify what happened.\u201d  \u201cThe whole world is watching us and we need to find out what happened and those responsible, if they exist, must face exemplary penalties,\u201d he said in a video message. Musician Caetano Veloso said he planned to speak about Phillips and Pereira during his show at the Vivo Rio concert hall in Rio de Janeiro on Wednesday night. In addition to Pel\u00e9, the Everton and Brazil forward Richarlison retweeted Phillips\u2019s wife\u2019s emotional video, and Walter Casagrande, a former Brazilian player who is now a well-known presenter, made his own recorded message in support of two people he said were dedicated to protecting human rights and the environment. \u201cThey are friends of our Indigenous people and we cannot remain quiet,\u201d the former Corinthians, Porto and Torino striker said. \u201cIt is the government\u2019s responsibility to intensify the search \u2026 This is a very serious case.\u201d Football club Corinthians tweeted their support; singer Gaby Amarantos made her own video;and Sonia Guajajara, an Indigenous leader who was recently named as one of Time magazine\u2019s most influential people of 2022, raised the issue with the US climate envoy, John Kerry, on a visit to New York. In Britain, the shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, urged Brazilian authorities \u201cto do all they can to find them as soon as possible and for the Foreign Office to use all the diplomatic channels at its disposal\u201d."

                    "body": "SCOT THREE It turns out that pinning all of our hopes on Scotland wasn\u2019t such a bad idea after all. On Wednesday night at Hampden, Steve Clarke\u2019s men went at Ukraine with the sort of verve and velocity not seen since the days of peak Klopp-era Liverpool, a side you kids may want to ask your parents about. Older readers may also remember when Jim Baxter juggled the ball and seven pints of heavy on the Wembley touchline in 1967, which The Fiver reckons is the last time Scotland played with such assurance, bordering on arrogance, against an extremely good team. Penny for the thoughts of absent captain Andrew Robertson, who is now only the fourth best full-back in the country, behind Kieran Tierney, Aaron Hickey and Nathan Patterson. Oh Andy, it was good while it lasted. A great night for the Scots, then, although scholars of the game will point out that, 41 seconds after Baxter\u2019s iconic game of keepy-uppy, supposedly humiliated world champions England went straight up the other end and scored. The man who put the ball in the net was Jack Charlton, limping around at the time on one functioning leg. All of which illustrates the fact that Scotland, through the years, have struggled somewhat with consistency. That should focus minds for Saturday\u2019s visit of the Republic O\u2019Ireland and next week\u2019s return fixture against Ukraine, to be played on neutral Polish soil. Two draws will be enough to secure top spot in Group B1 and a guaranteed place in the Euro 2024 playoffs. Clarke\u2019s team just need to keep a level head. This really isn\u2019t beyond them. \u201cWe\u2019ve got one to give to [O\u2019Ireland] as well!\u201d battle-cried Lyndon Dykes, high on life after scoring twice. \u201cWe wanted to prove everyone wrong. This is going to give us massive confidence!\u201d It was a speech so stirring it made Flower of Scotland sound like the STV jingle from the 1960s by comparison, though his pantomime bellicosity may also double up as a serviceable pre-match team-talk for Stephen Kenny on Saturday. Has Dykes fired up the opposition and tempted fate with his big talk? Or will the Scots get payback for their 3-0 hiding in Dublin just three months ago? This excellent performance will have given their fans plenty of renewed hope, albeit with an equal measure of historically-minded fatalism. They\u2019re good enough; they\u2019re also Scotland. Everyone knows how this works by now. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cI\u2019d like to thank the club for giving me the opportunity \u2013 it\u2019s a great honour for me to take up this role\u201d \u2013 because Mark Noble gets West Ham more than any player in the history of football gets a club, they\u2019ve created a new gig as sporting director just for him.  COMMERCIAL DEAL OF THE DAY Whenever you think of Everton, your mind immediately gravitates towards thoughts of Thomas Gravesen, Lee Carsley and Andy Johnson. Therefore it makes obvious sense they would team up with Turkish outfit and \u201ctop-tier industry professionals\u201d, Vera Clinic as their first Official Hair Transplant Partner. One in the eye for those Old Trafford suits and then some. Vera, the club declares, \u201cwill be visible around Goodison Park on a matchday\u201d, allowing fans to contemplate whether a new top knot will boost their confidence while witnessing their latest on-pitch travails. \u201cWe are proud to be the Official Hair Transplant Partner of a well-established and strong team like Everton,\u201d blurted board member Kazim Sipahi. \u201cThe reason behind our success in the hair transplant sector in Turkey is that we attach great importance to teamwork. Likewise, any success in football has to come from teamwork.\u201d With that kind of synergy, what can go wrong? FIVER LETTERS \u201cI agree with The Fiver\u2019s assertion that the Nations League does not seem to suit the temperament of the UK home nations (yesterday\u2019s Fiver). Perhaps Uefa could create a \u2018closed\u2019 Nations League group consisting entirely of the UK home nations with no promotion or relegation allowed. This would reduce the need for foreign teams to come here or for plucky Brits to travel abroad for their morale-crushing defeats. I have tried in vain to find a flaw in this suggestion, other than the fact the fans would not care to watch such a drawn-out risible tournament. But that has never been a consideration in the past\u201d \u2013 Colin Reed. \u201cLast night I got lost down the great wormhole that is the internet and started looking into the history of football kits. It turns out that \u2018shorts\u2019 were originally known as \u2018knickers\u2019 and in 1879, Darwen, a team of cotton mill workers, met Old Etonians in the FA Cup semi-final. Darwen were derided for wearing trousers cut off at the knee held up by braces, instead of wearing knickers. Luckily, we live in more enlightened times now (143 years later) and a bunch of elites from Eton would never consider looking down at the common folk \u2026\u201d \u2013 Noble Francis. \u201cFiver Towers has long riffed of the USA! USA!! USA!!! use of the word \u2018soccer\u2019 instead of \u2018football\u2019. I recently came across a Corinthian Casuals programme from January 1984 (incidentally, a certain Alan Pardew was wearing the No 6 shirt for Casuals, and future England cap Andy Gray the No 10), which notes that members of the Casuals are proud that an old Corinthian is credited with coining the word: \u2018One morning at his Oxford college a friend invited old Corinthian C Wreford-Brown to \u201ca game of rugger after brekker\u201d. \u201cNo thanks,\u201d said Wreford-Brown. \u201cI prefer soccer.\u201d\u2019 I would suggest this is a far more ignominious export across the Atlantic than providing the inspiration for the founding of famous S\u00e3o Paulo club Corinthians\u201d \u2013 Stuart Webber.

                    "body": "With an opening victory safely under their belt, a much-changed England side edged to a win over Italy in the Arnold Clark Cup. In front of 32,128 fans in Coventry, the Lionesses retained their unbeaten run despite conceding a controversial goal. Rachel Daly headed a double as she continued her claim for a striker\u2019s role while Sofia Cantore scored for the visitors. Sarina Wiegman was pleased with her team\u2019s performance. \u201cI\u2019m very happy,\u201d the England manager said. \u201cOf course, I\u2019m happy with the win because we always play to win. But today we saw many players on the pitch. We saw different players than last Thursday and that\u2019s exactly what we wanted.\u201d  As a manager renowned for her stable selection, it was perhaps a little surprising to see so many changes from Wiegman. Just two players remained from the opener against South Korea, with Jess Carter in defence and Alex Greenwood captaining the team. Then again, England\u2019s squad depth is no secret and with just one international window left after this tournament before the World Cup, this encounter presented the perfect opportunity to look at those knocking on the door. Young talents Katie Robinson, Jess Park and Maya Le Tissier added to their caps while Laura Coombs started after making her first appearance since 2015 against Korea. \u201cThe players are competing with each other because of course everyone wants to go to the World Cup and every moment you get to show yourself,\u201d Wiegman said. \u201cBut we\u2019re also playing as a team and collaborating really well ... I think that\u2019s really good.\u201d Wiegman\u2019s counterpart, Milena Bertolini, was equally in the mood for changing things up with eight alterations to her team. After defeat to Belgium, she called on her more established players as they faced the European champions. It was a landmark occasion for stalwart Cristiana Girelli, who further established her status in Italian football with her 100th appearance. Wiegman had anticipated a different tactical game, with Italy\u2019s adaptability well known. It was, therefore, important for the Lionesses to hit the ground running. In front of a favourable crowd, they dominated the ball in the first half with Park enjoying space in the pocket and Robinson\u2019s technical ability causing problems. Laura Giuliani was forced into a series of early saves to deny the energetic Daly up front.  While in control, the Lionesses were not at their fluid best as they tried to problem solve against a resilient Italy. Just as the match was starting to get disjointed, however, England found the breakthrough through a trademark Daly goal. Robinson\u2019s whipped delivery found the striker soaring high above Valentina Bergamaschi to power home the opener. Similar to the Korea match, England went up a level after the break, aided by the addition of Katie Zelem\u2019s and Jordan Nobbs\u2019s energy in midfield. Daly should have had a hat-trick, first volleying over Le Tissier\u2019s delivery before heading a Robinson cross wide. Meanwhile, Nobbs was denied by the strong hand of Giuliani in goal. With half an hour left to play, England\u2019s rhythm was delivered a blow in controversial fashion when the ball looked to have crossed the line before Barbara Bonansea delivered a cross. Unseen by the referee and her assistant, the dellivery found substitute Cantore who headed past Ellie Roebuck. Wiegman immediately turned to her established attackers, with Lauren James and Chloe Kelly entering the fold. Within minutes, England\u2019s lead was restored. James was afforded space, controlling the ball with time to assess her options. She picked out Daly in the middle with a sumptuous cross, who duly headed home. It was a performance from one of England\u2019s most versatile players that reignited the discussion around her best position on the pitch. \u201cI think they\u2019re both [Daly and Alessia Russo] very good strikers,\u201d Wiegman said. \u201cWe all know that Rachel is very versatile so she can play in different positions ... What we want to see this week is what options we have.\u201d It was just the tonic the Lionesses needed as they controlled the match to its conclusion. A second win in the tournament for Wiegman\u2019s side sees England top the group going into the final match day. They will face Belgium in Bristol on Wednesday with ambitions to retain their trophy."

                    "body": "Another day, another curveball for Eddie Jones to cope with. With English domestic rugby in financial meltdown, it looks increasingly probable the Rugby Football Union will have to hire a new defence coach, with the incumbent, Anthony Seibold, being strongly linked with a return to Australian rugby league as Manly\u2019s head coach. Seibold, for now, is due to be involved with England for their November internationals but a further coaching reshuffle seems to be on the Twickenham cards. The RFU, meanwhile, might also be interested to hear that Jones does not expect the 2023 Rugby World Cup to be his international coaching swansong. \u201cDefinitely not. Well, I can\u2019t guarantee you that but I don\u2019t think it will be. I reckon there\u2019s still a bit to do. There\u2019s still a bit in the tank.\u201d  So much for the 62-year-old\u2019s previously stated desire to go and watch cricket in the Caribbean. For him, World Cup fulfilment will always beat a beachside deckchair so, when his England tenure ends late next year, no one should be remotely surprised if he pops up in 2027 with something other than a red rose badge on his chest. His current priority, though, is 2023. This time next year the World Cup knockout stages will be looming in France, where Jones helped propel the Springboks to glory as a consultant to Jake White. He would love to repeat the trick with an England side he still feels can improve substantially. For that to happen, he believes, his squad have to be ready for the unexpected. Jones can still vividly remember the sun-soaked quarter-final weekend in Marseille in 2007 when England shocked Australia and Fiji gave South Africa a genuine fright. \u201cEngland had suffered a big defeat against South Africa and were struggling. There were all the rumblings about internal problems and then they went out and absolutely demolished Australia at the breakdown and in the scrum. \u201cWhen England scored a try there was a shot of the Australians and you could see they couldn\u2019t work out what had gone on.\u201d Fiji were also level at 20-20 with South Africa in the final quarter before the Boks recovered to keep their World Cup dream alive. The moral of the story, from Jones\u2019s perspective, is that resilience, flexibility, good captaincy and smartly applied power will all be required in 2023, when England are expected to play a quarter-final in Marseille if they progress from the pool. In Japan, England were at their best against Australia in the quarters and New Zealand in the semis but, ultimately, could not sustain it. \u201cWhen I look back on 2019, we just didn\u2019t have enough in the tank for the final,\u201d says Jones. Determined to go one better this time, he is planning potential warm-weather training camps in Switzerland and Italy next summer, with England also due to play two pool games against Argentina and Japan in the south of France.  Just as important, though, will be developing the right mindset. \u201cWe definitely got the physical preparation right [in 2019] but I don\u2019t know if we got the mental preparation right. We will be putting more emphasis on psychological preparation this time.\u201d Part of the rationale is Jones\u2019s view that the game has never been harder to referee. \u201cThe ability to adapt and create good relationships with the referee on the field is going to be crucial. I\u2019ve never seen such volatility in the game or around the officiating. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to change. \u201cThe game\u2019s getting so difficult. At some stage they\u2019re going to have to almost break it and fix it again. We\u2019ve probably gone as far as we can refereeing the game as it is now. We\u2019ve introduced all these TMO interventions to make it more accurate but it hasn\u2019t done so. What it has done is to make it slower and more chaotic. What we brought in to create certainty has created more uncertainty.\u201d Jones also says he will be attempting to keep many of his cards up his sleeve. \u201cWe want to win every Test in November but we don\u2019t want to be showing any tactical developments that maybe we\u2019ll want to use in the World Cup.\u201d With his autumn squad being named on Monday, however, he says there is still opportunity for two or three World Cup \u2018bolters\u2019 to bolster a squad that, in his own mind, is already 80% settled. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for players who can make a real difference to the chemistry of the team.\u201d The other priority is to develop more individuals worthy of inclusion in a World XV, with Jones suggesting Tom Curry and Maro Itoje \u201cat their best\u201d are already candidates. \u201cEllis Genge is probably pushing the window. Owen Farrell, Freddie Steward maybe. There are other guys teetering on the edge \u2026 but to win the World Cup we\u2019ve got to transfer those good players into great players. Great players make a great team.\u201d"

The Italy-born Dutch national, one of football\u2019s most powerful and high-earning agents, tweeted: \u201cCurrent health status for the ones wondering: pissed off second time in 4 months they kill me. Seem also able to ressuscitate [sic].\u201d His statement came after Dr Alberto Zangrillo from San Raffaele hospital in Milan told the news agency Ansa: \u201cI\u2019m outraged by the phone calls from pseudo-journalists speculating on the life of a man who is fighting to survive.\u201d  Raiola, whose clients include Paul Pogba, Erling Haaland and Zlatan Ibrahimovic, is understood to have been living with a serious illness since January. A tweet from Raiola\u2019s official account in January said he had undergone medical checks requiring anaesthesia, but that he had not had emergency surgery.Raiola was born in Italy but grew up in the Netherlands, and first stepped into the world of football agency by working on the deal that took the Dutch forward Bryan Roy to Foggia from Ajax, before acting as an interpreter in Dennis Bergkamp\u2019s move from the Amsterdam club to Internazionale. The Czech star Pavel Nedved became Raiola\u2019s first big-name client and he has steadily built his reputation in Italian and world football over the years since. Raiola\u2019s often outspoken approach has not always endeared him to club managers, with the former Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r unhappy at what he saw as the Italian stirring up trouble over Pogba\u2019s future. Pogba and Haaland are expected to make two of this summer\u2019s most significant transfers, with the Frenchman available on a free when his contract at United ends and Haaland poised to leave Borussia Dortmund. Manchester City intend to sign the Norway striker."

                    "body": "Alireza Firouzja strengthened his position among the world top last weekend: the Iranian-born, now French, player made a clean sweep at St Louis where he won the rapid, the blitz, the classical Sinquefield Cup and the overall Grand Tour.\nThe 19-year-old collected $272,000 in prize money, and defeated the Candidates winner, Ian Nepomniachtchi, in the final tie-break.\nYet it was the actions and missed opportunities of Firouzja\u2019s rivals as much as his own good chess which created the golden moment. Magnus Carlsen\u2019s shock withdrawal and the later unproven allegations against Hans Niemann made for a nervous atmosphere in the tournament and affected the overall quality. Tacitly agreed draws and outright blunders were more frequent than normal.\n\nWesley So was the favourite after Carlsen pulled out, but the former Filipino spoilt his chances when he miscalculated and lost a winning position against Firouzja in the penultimate round. So\u2019s comment was brief and self-deprecating: \u201cIt was probably one of my biggest chokes in my history of choking, which happens quite a lot.\u201d In the final round, Nepomniachtchi could have taken a loose pawn for nothing, but instead chose a weaker plan then allowed a draw by repetition. Why didn\u2019t he take the pawn? \u201cBecause I\u2019m a moron! I thought it\u2019s winning by any sequence of moves.\u201d\nFollowing Carlsen\u2019s withdrawal after his third-round loss to Niemann, the organisers issued an official statement which denied wrongdoing by any player throughout the event: \u201cMeasures included scanning of players with metal detectors \u2026 and fair play analysis by Professor Kenneth Regan using the Fide Game Screening Tool.\u201d\nMeanwhile, fresh allegations and rebuttals have emerged about Niemann\u2019s play in 2019-21. Garry Kasparov has called for clarity. The affair is set to rumble on.\nIt is surely time for Fide to step in. An investigatory commission of three, headed by professor Kenneth Regan whose work is widely respected, could be set up to examine Niemann\u2019s games over the board in the last three years. There are several hundred of them, almost all easily available on public databases, so that it should be possible to reach an informed conclusion within a few weeks.\nOn Sunday, the online Julius Baer Generation Cup begins, with 16 players representing both the established world top and rising teenagers. One pairing stands out. In round six, starting at 6pm on Monday, Niemann plays White against Carlsen. A huge audience will be watching.\nThis week at St Louis, from Wednesday to Friday, the action is Chess 9LX, also known as Fischer Random, where the pieces on the home rank are randomised and 960 is the number of possible starting positions.\nThe Champions Showdown 9LX features a rare appearance byKasparov, who rivals Carlsen as the all-time No 1. Play starts at 8pm on Friday, and can be followed live online. Kasparov had a disastrous 0/3 start on Wednesday and also had to allow the strictest anti-cheating measures of his life.\nOnline, chess.com has announced the pairings for its 64-player Global knockout championship. No Carlsen, no Firouzja. but the galaxy of talent includes Vlad Kramnik and Vishy Anand. Michael Adams and Nigel Short, both world finalists, represent England. Adams was eliminated 3-2 in Thursday\u2019s opening round by David Navara of the Czech Republic.\nThe legal action brought by Nona Gaprindashvili against Netflix for her portrayal in The Queen\u2019s Gambit as someone who never competed against men has been settled out of court, a victory for the Georgian and former world champion whose greatest over-the-board success was at Lone Pine 1977 where she shared first among leading grandmasters of the time.\n\nAt age 81, Gaprindashvili is still an active competitor and played in Georgia\u2019s over-50 team in the recent World Seniors, where Keith Arkell had to win a tough endgame against her to secure gold medals for England.\nFinally, a significant advance for a rising English talent. Shreyas Royal, 13, scored his first international master result (of three needed for the title) this week at the Mindsports Masters, where he shared third behind the new British champion, Harry Grieve.\nRoyal thus matches the achievements of Short, Luke McShane and David Howell, who all scored their first IM norms around 13-14. Adams nearly did it at 12, but missed out by just half a point at Lloyds Bank 1984.\nIn this game Royal defeats a GM by a rook sacrifice for checkmate, after Black missed the saving move 25...Qf5!\n\u2022 This article was amended on 19 September 2022 to describe Alireza Firouzja as Iranian-born rather than formerly Iranian.\n\n3833: 1 Qb7! If Nxb7 2 Nb3, or Bxg7+ 2 Qxg7. Other variations are obvious."

Our focus now is to work with Ian and his team to understand thoroughly in advance of the Rugby Championship what is needed to improve performance and where to from here.\u201d\nSaturday\u2019s 32-22 defeat was the fourth All Blacks loss of their last five Tests, and followed a decisive Irish victory last week. It is the first time the All Blacks have lost consecutive Tests on New Zealand soil in more than two decades, and with the World Cup looming in a year\u2019s time, some ex-players and commentators say the team will need dramatic changes to secure a World Cup victory.\n\n\u201cHave they got a team that\u2019s capable of winning the World Cup? On what we\u2019ve seen in the last two weeks, you would doubt that,\u201d said retired All Blacks star and captain Sean Fitzpatrick in a scathing interview with Sky Sports UK. \u201cThe questions will be asked: have they the right coaches? Have they the right head coach? We were outcoached, without question,\u201d he said. \u201cThe All Blacks used to worry about peaking too early before the World Cup, so at least that is no longer a concern. And when you consider the following facts it is difficult to see how Foster keeps his job.\u201d\nWithin New Zealand, the match has placed coach Foster\u2019s already-shaky performance under renewed scrutiny, with growing calls for him to go. \u201cA coaching change must now be considered, at the very least. Ian Foster\u2019s hold on his job must be tenuous at best,\u201d wrote senior sports commentator Marc Hinton. RNZ rugby writer Jamie Wall said the match represented \u200b\u200b\u201da solid case for the worst All Black side ever\u201d.\nFoster did not respond directly when questioned about his future with the team after the match. \u201cI just want to talk about this test match,\u201d said, after being asked several times whether he remained the right person to lead the team into the World Cup.\nFoster was due to hold a press conference on Sunday morning, but it was abruptly cancelled, leaving gathered journalists waiting. With a South Africa tour coming in August, New Zealand Rugby will be under pressure to make changes.\nOn the All Blacks\u2019 official fanpage, fans fumed and commiserated after the loss. \u201cFor the good of the team, some people need to swallow their pride and say this appointment was a huge mistake. Make the change, make it quickly and start preparing properly for next year,\u201d one wrote. \u201cAll Blacks out coached, out played and out passioned on home soil,\u201d commented another.\nOn behalf of the players, captain Sam Cane ended the night with an apology to fans. \u201cWe are bloody sorry,\u201d he said in a post-match interview with Sky Sports. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t put the performances out there that you guys deserved.\u201d"

                    "body": "Whenever the subject of cricket in the United States comes up, the same old questions are asked. From the unlikely scenario of American kids swapping their NFL football for a cricket bat, to quizzical looks about the financial viability of the game in North America, skeptical eyebrows are usually raised. Granted, there have been enough false dawns over the years to deflate even the most fervent of Stateside cricket followers \u2013 yes, they do exist \u2013 yet with the advent of Major League Cricket (MLC) in 2023, this time could well be different. So different, in fact, that MLC is set to receive further investment of $120m put together by a wide range of investors. To add to that, the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), one of the most successful and valuable Indian Premier League (IPL) franchises, are also plowing their money and reputation into the Twenty20 competition by taking control of a team in Los Angeles. The question many would ask is: Why?  Well, KKR CEO Venky Mysore is adamant now is the time to invest in North American cricket. The businessman, who spent a large portion of his professional career in the United States, has seen a similar investment in the Caribbean Premier League (CPL) pay dividends. Millions across the world \u2013 particularly in India \u2013 have tuned in to see star performers like Andre Russell roll out for the CPL\u2019s Trinidad Knight Riders. That\u2019s a sure sign, according to Mysore, that a foray into the already heavily saturated US sporting market would be worth it, from an Indian perspective alone.  A sudden sporting transformation won\u2019t happen overnight (\u201c10 to 15 years\u201d, according to Mysore) but cricket in the US now has a plan and the IPL powerhouse of KKR want in. \u201cMy philosophy of how to build a franchise is based on two pillars,\u201d Mysore says. \u201cOne is your brand, and the other one is your fanbase. And so if you have a two-month slot for a competition, how do you keep your brand alive all year round?  \u201cMy vision when I took over KKR, was that we could acquire assets around the world, which are very similar, and we build expertise in building a franchise, and making it successful and building a model there. But the next challenge was how can we take that model and replicate it around the world under the mother brand of Knight Riders? That\u2019s what we have done in the CPL and we will do in the United States. \u201cOn my wish list is to have a common group of sponsors who will participate with us wherever we play as Knight Riders, so that\u2019s where MLC fits into the whole scheme of things.\u201d The Knight Riders are far from the first team to employ this policy. It has served Manchester City, the Premier League team who have affiliate teams all over the globe, very well indeed.  Few IPL franchises have been able to follow KKR\u2019s lead and it remains unclear if others will take a chance with MLC, who have a number of American based sports investors to help with transition. \u201cThere is a commonality in terms of how we built our model, our colors and our logo and the brand of cricket we play,\u201d says Mysore. \u201cFans in India are able to relate to our other teams.\u201d On paper, the signs for MLC are encouraging. Cricket specific stadiums are planned. The most recent announcement is for one in Orange County, California, and other potential west coast venues include Seattle and the San Francisco Bay Area.  The $120m investment in MLC, which is set to start with six franchises, will primarily be dedicated to building premier cricket-specific stadia and training centers to help develop a new generation of US-born players. The project may be coming at just the right time too, after years of missteps and false dawns: the United States was named as a co-host with the Caribbean for the 2024 T20 World Cup. Meanwhile, cricket could make its return to the Olympics in 2028 \u2013 in Los Angeles. Success, of course, isn\u2019t guaranteed and neither is a return on some vast investment across the board unless. But Mysore is confident MLC will be sustainable.  \u201cIt\u2019s the NFL model, where you own part of the league,\u201d he says. \u201cSo there\u2019s a lot of other revenue that will flow through. I make more money from the CPL in Trinidad from licensing and merchandise than most IPL teams make in India.\u201d Huge swathes of expat Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, English, Australians and South Africans in the US need no introduction to the grand old game. But, the multimillion dollar question is whether kids from the middle of America even know all this is happening while the NFL and NBA juggernauts keep on rolling.  \u201cI think the short answer is no,\u201d says Michael Naraine, who teaches sports management at Brock University in Ontario. \u201cI mean, the easy answer is cricket is going to stay in the urban centers for a while. And when you talk to MLC, and you talk to other stakeholders in the US, this idea that we were going to proliferate these properties in major urban centers where there\u2019s lots of expats \u2013 Philadelphia, New York, Miami, San Francisco \u2013 makes sense in the grand scheme of things.  \u201cI think there\u2019s opportunity, but we can\u2019t be too facetious or naive about the situation that magically some kid in Missouri is going to pick this up. It\u2019s a long-term play possibly culminating [with a US presence] in the Olympics in 2032. If kids are seeing Team USA spring a shock on NBC, they could start thinking about being a cricketer. \u201c Naraine points to how ice hockey has gained footholds in places where the sport was not traditionally popular. Five-time NHL All-Star Auston Matthews is a good example: he grew up in Phoenix but was hooked on his local team, the Coyotes, growing up and is now one of the league\u2019s best young players. \u201cPhoenix only started their franchise in 1996 so 20 years on and they have their own MVP\u2019s being produced,\u201d says Naraine. \u201cThat\u2019s how long it\u2019s going to take for this thing to happen.\u201d A Twenty20 win for the United States team at the end of last year over Ireland was seen as a watershed moment for the game here \u2013 a triumph over a full member of the ICC. It was the kind of moment which persuaded English World Cup winning bowler Liam Plunkett to head across the Atlantic and take up a player/coach role in Philadelphia. The 37-year-old, whose wife is from the area, is slated to play for the Philadelphia franchise. Crucially, cricket in the US will also use the vastly experienced player to help work with potential stars of tomorrow. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s a startup company and I want to help build cricket over here,\u201d says Plunkett, one of 30 pro-players signed up by MLC. \u201cI was in Houston a few weeks back with the major league guys, and there\u2019s a lot of talent. With everything on the horizon, this definitely feels like a professional set-up now.\u201d Mysore agrees that the potential is there. \u201cThe US is the number one media market in the world. And you\u2019re taking the number two most watched sport in the world,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s enough people in the diaspora who are hungry to consume cricket content, that\u2019s for sure. I\u2019ve always maintained, though, that for us to be able to scale the product in the US, you have to get the average American sports fan interested in T20 cricket. There\u2019s no doubt it will be difficult to do \u2013 but there are ways to go about it.\u201d"

                    "body": "Joe Biden, speaking at a summit of Arab leaders, said on Saturday that the United States \u201cwill not walk away\u201d from the Middle East, as the US tries to ensure stability in a volatile part of the world and boost the global flow of oil to reverse rising gas prices.\nThe president also announced $1bn in US funding to relieve hunger in the region.\nHis remarks, delivered at the Gulf Cooperation Council on the final leg of a four-day Middle East tour, came amid concerns about Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions and support for militants in the region.\n\u201cWe will not walk away and leave a vacuum to be filled by China, Russia or Iran,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe will seek to build on this moment with active, principled, American leadership.\u201d\n\nAlthough US forces continue to target terrorists in the region and remain deployed at bases throughout the Middle East, Biden suggested he was turning a page after the US invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\u201cToday, I\u2019m proud to be able to say that the era of land wars in the region, wars that involved huge numbers of American forces, is not under way,\u201d he said.\nHe pressed his counterparts, many of whom lead repressive governments, to ensure human rights \u2013 including for women \u2013 and allow their citizens to speak openly.\n\u201cThe future will be won by the countries that unleash the full potential of their populations,\u201d Biden said, and that includes allowing people to \u201cquestion and criticize leaders without fear of reprisal\u201d.\n\nMohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, convened the summit, which gave him an opportunity to showcase his country\u2019s heavyweight role in the Middle East. He also hinted that the kingdom could pump more oil than it is currently, something Biden is hoping to see when an existing production deal among OPEC+ member countries expires in September.\nBiden\u2019s attendance at the summit followed his Friday meeting with the Saudi prince, heir to the throne currently held by his father, King Salman.\nThe 79-year-old Biden had initially shunned the 36-year-old royal over human rights abuses, particularly the killing of US-based writer Jamal Khashoggi, which US intelligence officials believe was likely approved by the prince.\nBut Biden decided he needed to repair the longstanding relationship between the two countries to address rising gas prices and foster stability in the volatile region.\n\u201cIt is only becoming clearer to me how closely interwoven America\u2019s interests are with the successes of the Middle East,\u201d the president said Saturday. Ending his speech on a hopeful note, Biden expressed his belief in cooperation among the nations.\n\u201cThis is a table full of problem-solvers,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of good we can do if we do it together.\u201d\nAfter a lunch with other leaders, Biden began his trip back to Washington, flashing a thumbs up and waving to reporters as he boarded Air Force One.\nEarlier, Biden met individually with the leaders of Iraq, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, some of whom he had never sat down with since taking office in January 2021.\nHe invited Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who became president of the UAE two months ago, to visit the White House this year.\nBiden also met with King Abdullah of Jordan. The White House later announced that the US was extending and expanding financial assistance to the country, to no less than $1.45bn per year.\nThe summit in the Red Sea port city of Jeddah was an opportunity for Biden to demonstrate his commitment to the region after spending most of his presidency focused on Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and China\u2019s growing influence in Asia.\nOn Saturday, the White House released satellite imagery indicating that Russian officials visited Iran in June and July to see weapons-capable drones it is looking to acquire for use in Ukraine. The disclosure appeared aimed at drawing a connection between the war in Europe and Arab leaders\u2019 own concerns about Iran.\nSo far, none of the countries represented at the summit has moved in lockstep with the US to sanction Russia, a foreign policy priority for the Biden administration. If anything, the UAE has emerged as a sort of financial haven for Russian billionaires and their multimillion-dollar yachts. Egypt remains open to Russian tourists.\nMeantime, there are sharp divisions on foreign policy among the nine Middle East heads of state who attended the summit.\nFor example, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE are trying to isolate and squeeze Iran over its regional reach and proxies. Oman and Qatar have solid diplomatic ties with Iran and have acted as intermediaries for talks between Washington and Tehran.\nQatar recently hosted talks between US and Iranian officials as they try to revive Iran\u2019s nuclear accord. Iran not only shares a huge underwater gas field with Qatar in the Persian Gulf, but it also rushed to Qatar\u2019s aid when Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt cut off ties and imposed a years-long embargo on Qatar that ended shortly before Biden took office.\nBiden\u2019s actions have frustrated some of the leaders. Although the US has played an important role in encouraging a months-long cease-fire in Yemen, his decision to reverse a Trump White House move that had listed Yemen\u2019s rebel Houthis as a terrorist group has outraged the Emirati and Saudi leadership.\nSaudi news outlet Al-Arabiya reported on Saturday that students were protesting in Tehran over Biden\u2019s meeting with Israel leaders in Tel Aviv as part of his trip. Protesters burned the American and Israeli flag, opposing the normalization of relations with Israel.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report"

                    "body": "When Fernando Sugath arrived in Lebanon in the mid-1990s, cricket was an underground sport. Literally. After living in Beirut for a year as one of the country\u2019s 80,000 Sri Lankan migrant workers, a fellow countryman he met in a supermarket invited him to a game. \u201cI had been looking for somewhere to play,\u201d says Sugath. \u201cAlso, I didn\u2019t have any friends.\u201d He turned up at the address he was given to discover the players crammed into a tiny underground car park beneath an apartment building. Sugath is a man used to improvising. \u201cAs kids we didn\u2019t need a big playing area or good equipment to play,\u201d he says. \u201cWe used plastic balls, the old base of a coconut leaf for a bat.\u201d Within 10 years, he had founded Nomads CC, who played in another, open-air car park behind a Jesuit church. Sugath was the captain, star batter and organiser extraordinaire.  In 2005 they staged a tournament for migrant workers in the excavated foundations of a yet-to-be-built high-rise. The Sri Lankan ambassador was in attendance, but that didn\u2019t prevent the Lebanese army surrounding the players with guns and demanding to see everyone\u2019s papers. Of the 500 people present, 30 were detained for not having the correct documents; it cost the community $35,000 to bail out their friends and colleagues. While attention is fixed on the football World Cup, and sport reckons with the treatment of migrant workers in Qatar, the far smaller-scale tale of cricket in Lebanon is worth considering. It is an upbeat one too, although it has not been without trials and setbacks. A few weeks ago, Sri Lankan migrant workers returned cricket to the streets of Beirut after a five-year ban \u2013 and in doing so, mounted a celebration of everything we want and hope sport to be. The 36-team Sri Lankan Ambassador Trophy tournament that took place at the end of September transformed the car park behind the Jesuit church into a mini-festival site. There were DJs and dancing, a calypso band and all manner of stalls selling South Asian street-food. Most of the players were migrant workers, some were Syrian refugees; there were teams from the British and Australian embassies, others which had travelled from Damascus, and no fewer than four sides representing the Indian and Pakistani peacekeeping troops that serve on the Blue Line bordering Israel. There had been such cricket gatherings in Beirut in the past, although none quite so big. The local rules are well known: if the tennis ball hits the wall behind the wicketkeeper, the batter gets a bye and swaps ends; if it goes into the trees behind the bowler\u2019s arm, they can run for as long as it takes to re-emerge without fear of being caught. The five-over games went on all day; when Sugath was asked by a local reporter what it meant to see so many people enjoying the game, and each other\u2019s company, he wept. For 26 years, cricket has been the activity that ameliorates a hard life, thousands of miles from his family in Sri Lanka. He works 12 hours a day, six days a week, for a furniture depot. His employer treats him well; when Sugath first arrived he worked as a cleaner and now he is the boss\u2019s PA. It is a rare example of personal development in the exploitative kafala system practised in the Gulf states, that gives employers control over their employees\u2019 immigration status.  But the economic crisis in Lebanon has halved the value of Sugath\u2019s monthly earnings and when he finishes his day job he returns to the small subterranean maids\u2019 room \u2013 bed, toilet and gas hob almost abutting each other \u2013 where he has a second role as the building\u2019s concierge. His sacrifices have enabled him to send home enough money to build a house for his parents, his brother and himself. But the light at the end of each week is cricket. \u201cIt makes my life here much easier to handle,\u201d he says. In 2017 the owners of the car park suddenly and unexpectedly refused permission to play cricket there, threatening to have anyone who showed up arrested. With a dearth of alternative venues, the scene threatened to wither and die. A new women\u2019s project at a camp for Syrian refugees, Alsama Cricket, meant the game continued to be played in Lebanon \u2013 but not by the migrant workers. It has taken five years to reinstate permission to use the car park \u2013 and when the game finally returned, it brought together the workers with the refugee players for the first time. \u201cThese two disparate communities have never had any interaction before,\u201d says William Dobson, a Beirut bookshop owner from England who co-founded the September tournament with Sugath. \u201cNow these teenage refugees who have only been playing for three years are turning up each week to learn from 50-year-old Sri Lankan guys.\u201d There were four teams of women at the tournament, including some who were playing for the first time. \u201cAfter that we realised how excited women are to play cricket,\u201d said Sugath. \u201cNow we have 10 women\u2019s teams practising every week.\u201d He recalls how a woman called Pradeep told him: \u201cFor six days of the week I\u2019m in Lebanon and I\u2019m nobody. On Sunday I come to cricket and I\u2019m back in Sri Lanka again.\u201d Dobson says: \u201cIn England it\u2019s easy to take cricket for granted. But for a 50-year-old Sri Lankan woman who has lived in Beirut for 30 years, and hasn\u2019t seen her family for two years, to be with other women in a similar situation and connecting to something from their homeland and their childhood \u2013 that\u2019s something else.\u201d Sugath has already arranged for a women\u2019s tournament at the end of November. \u201cWhen we\u2019re at work, every one of us is counting the days til Sunday,\u201d he says."

I\u2019m not playing football today. thanks bye.\u201d\nThe history\n31 meetings, 17 England wins, nine for France \u2013 but 10 of those English victories came before 1950. More recent form points the other way. Since the turn of the millennium England have won one (2-0 in a friendly under Roy Hodgson in 2015), drawn twice and lost four, with the most recent meeting a 2017 3-2 friendly defeat in Paris. The major tournament record involves two World Cup group stage wins for England \u2013 2-0 in 1966 (Roger Hunt scoring twice) and 3-1 in 1982 (Bryan Robson twice plus Paul Mariner) \u2013 and, in the Euros, three games unbeaten for the French: a goalless draw in 1992, a Zinedine Zidane-powered 2-1 comeback in 2000, and a 1-1 2012 draw, with Samir Nasri cancelling out Joleon Lescott\u2019s opener.\n\nThe broader history\nIt\u2019s been up and down. Highs include the Entente Cordiale, Henry VIII\u2019s 18-day Field of the Cloth of Gold fest in 1520, years of allied heroism, the co-invention of Concorde, the unifying power of the Channel Tunnel. Lows include the seven years war, the hundred years War, the Napoleonic wars, Charles de Gaulle vetoing Britain\u2019s EEC membership, Brexit, Liz Truss refusing to call Emmanuel Macron a friend, and years of heat over culinary standards \u2013 including an English cafe\u2019s \u201cfish finger and cheese croissant\u201d causing upset online this month. @JulienHoez: \u201cWhy do British people seem to have an overriding need to destroy all that is holy in this world?\u201d\nThe broadcaster\n20.4 million viewers watched ITV\u2019s England v Senegal coverage on Sunday; less than the Queen\u2019s funeral, more than I\u2019m A Celebrity. Fans are still uneasy over ITV having the rights: the Senegal win took the edge off the \u201cITV curse\u201d but the figures remain unhealthy. Since 1998, England\u2019s win rate for World Cup matches live on the BBC is 75% (12 of 16 games), on ITV it\u2019s now 18.75% (three of 16). Then there\u2019s the accidental ad break anxiety: technical glitches resulting in key moments dropping off air \u2013 most famously 2010\u2019s Hyundai ad break replacing Steven Gerrard\u2019s goal against the USA.

Pitchside are Laura Woods, Eni Aluko and I\u2019m A Celebrity winner Jill Scott, who will become the first person to have been showered in rats, cockroaches and mealworms and to analyse a major showpiece quarter-final on the same channel in the same fortnight. Should England score, watch out for essential shots of Keane looking unmoved in studio replays while Wright and Neville go berserk.\n\nBehind the mic\nCommentator Sam Matterface and sidekick Lee Dixon don\u2019t get much love on social media \u2013 Matterface accused of over-talking and not being Clive Tyldesley, Dixon of sounding like he\u2019d rather be anywhere else. Also listen out for ex-referee Peter Walton, on hand to agree with any controversial refereeing decisions. Should England win, the BBC would show their semi on Wednesday, against Morocco or Portugal.\nThe weirdness\nIt\u2019s Saturday night primetime, two weeks before Christmas, but it\u2019s not Strictly and there\u2019s no Ant and Dec.

It also hosts the semi involving tonight\u2019s winners.

He\u2019s not shy about chastising: in three Copa Libertadores matches last year he showed 14 yellow cards and one red, and produced five in Poland v Saudi Arabia. He was involved in setting up VAR at the 2018 World Cup, and was stung by it this time round \u2013 rejecting Saudi penalty appeals before colleagues intervened. He will be assisted by Bruno Boschilia and Bruno Pires, with VAR run by Juan Mart\u00ednez, Alejandro Hern\u00e1ndez and Neuza Back. Any omens? England also had a Brazilian referee for their 6-2 win over Iran \u2013 the more festive-sounding Raphael Claus.\n\nThe jingoism\nIt\u2019s ripe for culture war, depending where you get your pre-match content.

                    "body": "MLS is entering its 28th season and soccer\u2019s popularity in the US is evident from the thousands who play the game, as well as the popularity of the Premier League, Liga MX \u2026 and even a team from north Wales. But many US soccer teams, including those in MLS, can sometimes fail to breach the wall of sporting consciousness in their own back yards. That stumbling block is evident in America\u2019s two biggest cities. While LA and New York City have a huge number of soccer fans, it is arguable whether their MLS teams are part of the identity of the cities. For much of 2022, New York City had a major league champion, not that you would know it. New York City FC\u2019s MLS Cup win in December 2021 was largely ignored amid discussions of New York\u2019s major league championship drought. When the New York Giants won the Super Bowl in February 2012, the victory led the local TV news for days. NYC FC\u2019s title, meanwhile, struggled to displace the Jets and Giants in the sports update. The Giants were also granted a ticker tape parade down Broadway after their title victory, while NYC FC were given a smaller reception at City Hall, although it came at a time when the city was discouraging large public gatherings as it recovered from the Covid pandemic. The same goes for written media. In May 2021, longtime New York Post columnist Mike Vaccaro wondered which team would end the city\u2019s title drought. He didn\u2019t even mention NYC FC, the team that would do so seven months later. In August of this year, the same publication ran an article celebrating the impressive performance of the Mets during the 2022 season. \u201cJust take a quick look around New York,\u201d the article said. \u201cOverrun by people who wish their primary teams were operating as efficiently as the Mets are operating right now.\u201d All of this forgot that NYC FC \u2013 who sometimes plays games at the Mets\u2019 Citi Field \u2013 were the reigning Major League Soccer champion. The mood was similar around LAFC\u2019s MLS Cup victory in 2022. Coverage of the win in LA\u2019s flagship newspaper, the Los Angeles Times, was limited to a few stories, while the Dodgers\u2019 playoff defeat a few weeks previously had been given blanket coverage. Detailed coverage and analysis of baseball, football and hockey is understandable and expected \u2013 they have been part of both cities\u2019 fabric for decades. And LAFC and NYC FC\u2019s titles brought joy to thousands of the teams\u2019 fans. But the chance to shout about the success of a major league championship in these cities was shunned, and in some cases ignored altogether, rather than positively embraced. The situation is different in other parts of the US. LAFC\u2019s opponent in the MLS Cup final, Philadelphia Union, enjoy regular coverage in the city\u2019s newspaper, the Inquirer. The buildup to the Union\u2019s appearance in MLS Cup coincided with the Phillies reaching the World Series. \u201cThe Union have definitely broken through, but it\u2019s not as big a deal as the Phillies being in the World Series,\u201d says Jonah Gardner of sports data website, Sports Reference. \u201cWhen people talk about how Philly sports is having a moment, they mention the Phillies and the World Series and the Union in [MLS] Cup and the Eagles [reaching the Super Bowl]. They\u2019re being presented alongside the others as part of the city\u2019s sports.\u201d It helps that the Union\u2019s Jim Curtin, who was named MLS Coach of the Year in 2022, is from the area and knows the Philly sports scene. This leads to the kind of cross-sport promotion that can help soccer clubs in cities with multiple teams. \u201cThe way this team has elevated itself in the community and is talked about more in the media \u2013 a lot of hard work has gone into that, from our front office to our players,\u201d Curtin said in the run-up to the 2023 season. \u201cIt\u2019s deserved because we are a fun team and are exciting to watch. We\u2019re young, we have great players, and we\u2019ve had success on the field. So that\u2019s a recipe for Philadelphia. A recipe for the fans to fall in love with your group, and I\u2019m really proud of all the growth we\u2019ve had in that area.\u201d As alluded to by Curtin, MLS teams can do a good job of marketing themselves. And US soccer can deliver exciting stories when space and resources are afforded to those who document it. The 2022 US Open Cup final, for example, pitted MLS side Orlando City against Sacramento Republic of the USL Championship, American soccer\u2019s de facto second division. It was a unique occasion in the US sporting landscape because a major title was contested by teams not from different conferences or divisions, but from different tiers. \u201cThe US Open Cup final definitely garnered interest in the area,\u201d says Austin David, a soccer writer for the Orlando Sentinel. \u201cThey sold out the stadium [Exploria Stadium, Orlando] and the club did a good job of marketing it, reaching out to all the local outlets and really pushing the interest. \u201cOther Orlando sports teams also pushed out good luck messages to Orlando City for the final, so it got more eyes on it than usual, but Orlando generally is mostly geared towards American football and NBA. Other than the Orlando Magic, Orlando City and Orlando Pride [of the NWSL] are the only other pro teams in the city, yet they are still overshadowed by college and high school American football at times.\u201d Orlando is not the only MLS city where college football is popular. But in some cities, college sports remain well-supported alongside soccer, rather than necessarily overshadowing it. One such city is Austin where, despite only joining MLS in 2021, Austin FC attract considerable local coverage and support. \u201cAustin has got a very robust press corps following Austin FC and there\u2019s a lot of fans out there,\u201d says Austin-based writer Phil West of The Striker. \u201cPart of it is, it really is the only major sports franchise in Austin. You have the [NBA\u2019s] San Antonio Spurs, who ostensibly represent Austin. But though they\u2019re going to play a couple of games here in April, most of their games are in San Antonio, which is 80 miles to the south. \u201cObviously with football, which is kind of king in Texas, you have Dallas and Houston, and particularly in Austin you have a huge Dallas Cowboys fanbase, but before Austin FC came, the University of Texas was really the only major sports team that was here. \u201cThere\u2019s been this notion for a while that Austin is a college town, but now it\u2019s really a major metropolitan and cosmopolitan city. Austin FC has filled this need for having a team to call its own.\u201d No two cities are the same and the popularity of soccer varies across the US. But there\u2019s a feeling in the country that soccer is a global sport rather than an American one. Part of the reason for this is that although soccer\u2019s history in the US goes back to the 1800s, it can be difficult for a major league that emerged in the 1990s to draw upon that storied history. Some clubs, like those in soccer hotbeds such as Portland and Seattle, are able to do a better job because their teams\u2019 origins pre-date MLS. \u201cI liken MLS to indie rock in the 90s,\u201d says West. \u201cIt\u2019s just kind of waiting for its Nirvana releases Nevermind moment. And that might be happening with the World Cup being here in 2026, with this Apple TV deal, and with more and more stars coming over.\u201d Just as the 1994 World Cup helped create MLS, there is hope that the 2026 tournament could take the league to the next level. To do so, it needs to convert association football and f\u00fatbol fans into MLS fans. And national media treating MLS and the Open Cup as they would other major leagues wouldn\u2019t go amiss either."

                    "body": "Welcome to The Breakdown, the Guardian\u2019s weekly (and free) rugby union newsletter. Here\u2019s an extract from this week\u2019s edition. To receive the full version every Tuesday, just pop your email in below:  15) Michael Lowry, Ulster The fact that Lowry made the most metres in the tournament as well as the joint-most clean breaks despite Ulster going out in the last 16 says everything about what a running threat he is. His performances in the pool stages earned him a nomination for the European player of the year award and though Ulster were edged out by Toulouse despite a famous away win in the first leg, Lowry lit up the competition during the dark winter months. 14) Teddy Thomas, Racing 92 Other wingers scored more tries, made more clean breaks and more metres than Thomas but statistics only tell you so much about the Racing flyer. The three-time runners-up blew hot and cold throughout their campaign but there are few better sights than Racing in full flow, and that is when Thomas comes to life. His finish against Sale, somehow avoiding going into touch, was remarkable and his effortless change of pace is still deceptive.  13) Ga\u00ebl Fickou, Racing 92 \u201cI\u2019ve seen the future and it runs, tackles, scores tries and is called Ga\u00ebl Fickou,\u201d wrote Shaun Edwards in the Guardian back in 2012 and, as is often the case with France\u2019s defence coach, he wasn\u2019t wrong. Whether it be for France or for Racing, Fickou is a consistently supreme performer these days, robust in defence and constantly a threat in attack. 12) Pita Ahki, Toulouse Toulouse have more heralded backs but Ahki is a reliable presence in midfield for the five-times champions. In their shootout victory over Munster, Akhi was the glue who held Toulouse together as they clawed their way back into the contest. He is not one to revel in the limelight but a number of New Zealanders have impressed during their time with Toulouse and Ahki is the latest. 11) Raymond Rhule, La Rochelle Another whose contributions cannot solely be measured by metrics, and though James Lowe finished as the top try-scorer with an eye-catching set of all-round statistics, there remains a lingering sense that he is something of a flat-track bully. Rhule, on the other hand, delivered when it mattered most in Marseille, coming up with the opening try to round off a highly impressive campaign with La Rochelle.  10) Johnny Sexton, Leinster No player in the history of the competition has won five titles but few have come closer than the evergreen Leinster fly-half. Sexton has been a joy to watch throughout this season\u2019s competition, steering one of the slickest attacks Europe has seen in recent years. It helps when his forward pack is on top and though La Rochelle denied him that type of service in Saturday\u2019s final, Sexton battled manfully in pursuit of the fifth star he so covets. His semi-final performance against Toulouse was flawless. 9) Nolann Le Garrec, Racing 92 Racing\u2019s swashbuckling scrum-half has displayed a maturity well beyond his 20 years in this season\u2019s competition and it is surely a matter of time before he wins his first France cap. Antoine Dupont may be the France captain and incumbent scrum-half but it does not feel a stretch to say that Le Garrec will put him under pressure in the coming years. In the quarter-final victory over Sale he was the best player on the pitch by a distance and he has an assuredness from the kicking tee to boot. 1) Dany Priso, La Rochelle Ball-handling skills to die for and part of a pack that yielded to no one throughout La Rochelle\u2019s victorious campaign. Priso has done magnificently well to battle back from the disappointment of missing out on France\u2019s 2019 World Cup squad and losing his place in the La Rochelle side. The manner in which he blends physicality with a poise on the ball makes him typical of the side that Ronan O\u2019Gara has built on the Atlantic coast. 2) Peato Mauvaka, Toulouse Both starting finalists may seem like more obvious choices \u2013 Ronan Kelleher had been excellent throughout the competition until his early departure through injury and Pierre Bourgarit was arguably man of the match in Marseille \u2013 but Mauvaka is box office. He fulfils the super-sub role for both Toulouse and France more often than not, in both instances playing second fiddle to Julien Marchand, but any hooker capable of the pass that released Matthis Lebel against Munster is worthy of a place in this side.  3) Tadhg Furlong, Leinster A cornerstone of the Leinster pack but so much more than that, as his astonishing long pass to Hugo Keenan in the semi-final win over Toulouse so clearly demonstrated. He went off in that match after less than 20 minutes and almost immediately Toulouse were able to gain ascendancy at the scrum. He was a doubt for the final as a result but when he is fit and firing there is no other tighthead prop around who boasts his remarkable skillset.  4) Ross Molony, Leinster Another Leinster second-row to emerge from St Michaels. It is clearly a position of great strength for the province so it is to Molony\u2019s great credit that he has finally established himself in the side on the biggest stage, having toiled away in the URC for years. His handling skills were to the fore against Toulouse and though the competition is obvious it is a surprise that he is still awaiting a first Ireland cap. 5) Will Skelton, La Rochelle He made only three starts in this season\u2019s competition and missed both the quarters and semis but his performance in the final alone, going strong for the full 80 minutes, means Skelton demands inclusion. Leinster will be sick of the sight of him after his power also proved decisive when playing in the 2019 final for Saracens and once more the Irish side could not cope with the Australian giant. 6) Wenceslas Lauret, Racing 92 Scored a hat-trick in the opening round when Racing 92 so emphatically thrashed Northampton in an early statement of intent and is such a consistent performer in a side who tend to be anything but. Gets through a huge amount of work on the blindside and is an effective weapon at the lineout too. When Racing cut loose in the final quarter it is often because Lauret has emptied the tank, softening up defences. 7) Josh van der Flier, Leinster Named the official European player of the year after a final in which he made a staggering 25 tackles in a losing cause, rounding off a campaign in which he has established himself as one of the leading openside flankers in the world. His red scrum-cap makes him that much more visible but Van der Flier is ubiquitous around the park for Leinster and is a considerable try-scoring threat too. 8) Gr\u00e9gory Alldritt, La Rochelle It has been some season for Alldritt, adding the European crown to the Six Nations grand slam and no player exerted such an obvious influence in both success stories. Indeed, the tournament statistics demonstrate just how impressive Alldritt has been with a barely believable 135 carries \u2013 55 more than any other player. He also beat 29 defenders, joint top with Lowry, and the only forward in the top six. He was mightily impressive against Leinster but his performance against Racing in the semi-final sticks in the mind. Replacements: Pierre Bourgarit (La Rochelle), Ellis Genge (Leicester), Uini Atonio (La Rochelle), Lood De Jager (Sale), Peter O\u2019Mahony (Munster), Jamison Gibson-Park (Leinster), Romain Ntamack (Toulouse), Thomas Ramos (Toulouse)."

                    "body": "Harry Maguire has opened up on his season of misery and insisted he will bounce back, beginning in England\u2019s upcoming Nations League programme. The Manchester United captain has been jeered by fans of his own team at club and international level as his form has nosedived. But the 29\u2011year\u2011old defender made it clear that the bomb threat to his family home on 20 April was beyond the pale. \n\u201cThere is a line,\u201d Maguire said. \u201cWe are human beings. I do have a family. People ask if it affects me. My mentality is that it doesn\u2019t affect me too much but when it comes to bomb threats, it is more about family.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just happy my kids are at an age where they don\u2019t read things and see things on the news. If my kids were an older age, they could see things and go to school and people are speaking about it. That is when it affects you a little bit more.\n\u201cI\u2019m in a position where I\u2019m going to be criticised. Manchester United paid a large sum of money for me. It is one of the most loved clubs in the world and also one of the most hated in the world as well.\n\u201cWe know we are under the most scrutiny. I totally accept criticism when we concede goals or make mistakes. I\u2019m big enough to accept people getting on my back and saying I can improve.\u201d\nThe bomb threat came the day after United\u2019s 4-0 defeat at Liverpool and led to Cheshire police returning to carry out a precautionary sweep of the property.\nThe previous month, Maguire\u2019s late substitution in United\u2019s Champions League exit against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid was cheered by a section of the Old Trafford support and in his next game \u2013 for England against Ivory Coast in March \u2013 he was booed by some fans at Wembley.\n\u201cI have had amazing times with the [England] fans and I am not going to let the minority \u2013 I don\u2019t know how many it was, 10-20 people doing that in the Ivory Coast game \u2013 affect my relationship with them,\u201d Maguire said. \u201cI was a bit shocked. I wouldn\u2019t say I was hurt and upset. I know my family and friends might have been affected by it but I was more surprised.\u201d\n\nGareth Southgate, the England manager, who has always backed Maguire, called the boos \u201can absolute joke\u201d, saying other players might wonder whether they would be next for that kind of treatment and question whether they should continue to join up. In England\u2019s bad old days, some players were reluctant to report for international duty.\nMaguire said: \u201cThere were a lot of young lads in the team that day, a lot of young people in the stands, lots of kids watching who aspire to grow up and be an England footballer, so for them to hear that for somebody who\u2019s been involved in a such a big part of the journey over the last five years, it\u2019s sad to see.\n\u201cIt probably affects them [the young England players]. That\u2019s why it was a little disappointing. We spoke about it as a group. But I\u2019m sure there will be many good times ahead when the England fans will again show their support and love.\n\u201cI am my biggest critic. Although there are a lot of critics out there, I\u2019m actually still my biggest! The next biggest is probably my dad.\n\u201cIf that had happened earlier on in my career, I would\u2019ve struggled that night. But I\u2019m 29, I\u2019ve been through a lot of ups and downs and I\u2019ve learned to deal with it through experience. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be back to playing my best football very soon.\u201d\n\nMaguire, who said he had yet to speak with the new United manager, Erik ten Hag, did not pull his punches on the club\u2019s dismal season.\n\u201cYou could see towards the end, the confidence wasn\u2019t there,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can look at individual performances but every player has not performed to a level \u2026 apart from Cristiano [Ronaldo] with his goals.\n\u201cBut if you look at individual performances, it\u2019s hard when you\u2019re playing in a team when collectively we\u2019ve not been good enough.\n\u201cFootball\u2019s my life. I care about every day at the club. For it to end the way it has \u2013 sixth in the league, knocked out of the cups in games we should be winning \u2026 it was disappointing from the start to the end.\u201d\nEngland are preparing for Nations League ties against Hungary (on Saturday) and Germany away (next Tuesday), then Italy (11 June) and Hungary at home (14 June), in their penultimate get-together before the World Cup finals tournament starts in Qatar on 21 November.\nIt was put to Maguire that, given his form, it was a good thing for him that the finals were not about to begin in their usual June slot.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s fair to say,\u201d he replied. \u201cAfter the season we\u2019ve had, all Manchester United players \u2026 I mean, there\u2019s only me here in the squad now. Are we among the favourites for the World Cup? Definitely and rightly so.\n\u201cIn the semi-final against Croatia in Russia [in 2018], we had the talent to win that game but we didn\u2019t have the mentality or belief.\n\u201cThe big thing now is that we have a lot of players who play in big European games for their clubs week in, week out, fighting for the biggest trophies. That experience is crucial in tournaments.\n\u201cWe were a penalty shootout away from winning in the biggest pressure in football \u2013 the Euros at Wembley [last summer]. If we can deal with that, I\u2019m sure we can deal with the pressure of a World Cup.\u201d"

                    "body": "We often, as you can imagine, have many hot chocs in our house: dark, darker, darkest, filthy dark, milk, plant milk, nutty, orange, mint, etc. It\u2019s like when people were faced with all the flavour choices in my dad\u2019s ice-cream shop: they\u2019d just end up going for vanilla, because the vast array, conversely, can end up narrowing your choice. And so it was this week that I decided to go for a medium cocoa range \u2013 58% single origin from S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 \u2013 straight-up hot chocolate from Kokoa, \u00a323.95/ 1 kg. I first laughed at the kilo bags (200g also available, \u00a37.50), but it\u2019s surprising how quickly you can get through it and you can also use it for melting in baking \u2013 takes seconds in a bowl above steam. Anyway, this was so good. I lured lots of friends round with the promise of hot chocolate and homemade biscuits, as the weather was turning and every single person said, \u2018This is really good!\u2019 And it is. It\u2019s perfect for when you want a standout hot chocolate that offers complex flavours from the cocoa, but with no fancy stuff.  I also loved Continuum Conceits \u2018pot luck\u2019 chocolates, \u00a32.10. You can select if you prefer dark, milk or white, otherwise the choices are random and each large piece contains a beautiful hand-drawn print and a letter so you can identify what you ate via the website. The chocolate, and inclusions, were wonderful and I was glad to find milk with caramel in there (code I), but my favourite was A, fruit and nut. If you don\u2019t like someone else making choices for you, avoid this \u2013 but CC does make beautiful presents. Follow Annalisa on Twitter @AnnalisaB"

                    "body": "THE FRENCH DEFLECTION It\u2019s been an extremely difficult weekend for Liverpool fans, some of whom were actually lucky enough to get in to the Stade de France on Saturday to see their team lose to Real Madrid in the final of Big Cup. Many more were left outside the stadium\u2019s perimeter fence waving tickets for which they\u2019d paid through the nose \u2013 noses which, along with their eyes were left streaming from the teargas sent wafting their way by members of the decidedly unfriendly local French constabulary. Hundreds of match-goers and on-site reporters \u2013 among them authoritative voices such as Gary Lineker, Kelly Cates, Carrie Brown, Rob \u201cTrouble\u201d Harris, the lads from The Anfield Wrap and Big Paper\u2019s own floating football brain in a jar, Jonathan Wilson, tweeted their own experiences, and those of the Liverpool fans left feeling let down, unsafe and downright scared. Still, there were plenty more on social media \u2013 but crucially nowhere near Paris \u2013 who knew better. Childish tribalism meant they were happy to point their Big Finger O\u2019Blame squarely in the direction of Liverpool fans. Almost to a man, woman and child, with only a few inevitable exceptions, they seemed serenely patient in the face of unspeakable organisational incompetence, and entirely blameless for the fiasco we all saw unfold. We have been here before, of course, and it seems that little more than blind luck prevented another horrific tragedy unfold. And like before, those on duty have moved quickly to scapegoat innocent supporters. First falsely accusing them of turning up late, they then decided fans had turned up with tens of thousands of counterfeit tickets, without giving any evidence to support either claim. \u201cI\u2019d like to thank the forces of law and order,\u201d said the French interior minister, G\u00e9rard Darmanin, of the local police. \u201cThey were very calm and able to avoid drama.\u201d Said rozzers were apparently also spotted threatening journalists who were recording their activities, and responding to cries for assistance from fans stuck outside the stadium by pepper-spraying them in the face.  France\u2019s Minister of Sport, Am\u00e9lie Oud\u00e9a-Cast\u00e9ra, then announced that the problem had been caused by \u201c30,000 to 40,000 fans without tickets or with fake tickets\u201d rocking up to the ground. Without giving evidence to back this claim, and overlooking testimonies from people who were actually there, these assertions seem preposterous even by the standards of her own thick-as-a-submarine-door British counterpart, Nadine Dorries. Meanwhile back on Merseyside, Liverpool\u2019s players and backroom staff tried to get over their disappointment by taking to the streets on an open-top bus to celebrate the two pots they did win this season. As has become customary any time fans or footballers congregate to celebrate a big success, this time it was the Twitter Fun Gendarmes who were hurling metaphorical tear gas canisters their way. In a pursuit originally intended to be fun, it seems these days you\u2019re damned when you do win trophies and even more damned when you don\u2019t. Today, a spokesman for the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, spoke up in favour of Liverpool fans, in whose hearts the Conservative Party has long had a special place. \u201cWe know many Liverpool fans travelled to Paris in good time to support their team in one of the biggest matches of the season, and we\u2019re hugely disappointed at how they were treated,\u201d he said. \u201cFans deserve to know what happened, so we\u2019re urging Uefa to work closely with the French authorities on a full investigation, and to publish its findings.\u201d Welcome news and, while it\u2019s exceptionally rare for Boris to be enthused by the prospect of an inquiry\u2019s findings being published, we can only conclude that for once, on this occasion he is confident the dishonesty surrounding this omnishambles is nothing to do with him. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cFor me, the Nations League is not important. Just glorified friendlies after a long and tough season. I\u2019m not looking forward to it. In 12 months, we have three weeks of holiday. The people from the outside do not understand \u2013 but they don\u2019t have to because it won\u2019t change anything.\u201d Manchester City\u2019s Kevin De Bruyne tells it like it is. At least you didn\u2019t have to play Big Cup final, eh Kev? Kev?  FIVER LETTERS \u201cThank heavens Uefa\u2019s bigwigs decided to move the Big Cup showpiece away from St Petersburg. I shudder to think what might have happened if brutal, undisciplined, armour-clad police had been let loose on innocent, unsuspecting football fans. And how nice to see Uefa\u2019s corporate partners getting safely to their luxury seats after enduring a gruelling gourmet buffet\u201d \u2013 Mark McFadden. \u201cI only found Friday\u2019s missive this morning and chanced upon the link to Jonathan Wilson\u2019s Big Cup preview. All I needed to do was to look at the first paragraph. Well done, Jonathan\u201d \u2013 Marisa Cardoni. \u201cI had imagined Forest fans would be over the moon about promotion. But the crowd of them I saw at St Pancras station this morning were more in sick as a parrot territory. All subdued, anxious and pale \u2013 surely some weeks of optimism can be enjoyed before the financial realities hit home?\u201d \u2013 Andrew Battarbee. \u201cThe lyrics of Rotterdam (Or Anywhere), released by the Beautiful South in 1996, predicted the locations of three of the six European club cup finalists this season.

                    "body": "Under an almost full moon, England poured a few more golden rays of sunshine. As homecomings go, this ticked most boxes: a celebratory atmosphere; the national stadium near enough full; the palpable sense of occasion as the tube station funnelled its public down on to Olympic Way. Then there was the rip-roaring spectacle delivered inside and the invigorating sense that, while the Lionesses\u2019 summer heroics were its springboard, there is still no telling exactly where they will land.  The answer may be known by 20 August, when the World Cup\u2019s two best teams will square off at Stadium Australia. It is hardly outrageous to suggest we were watching them here. England and USA served up a sometimes alarmingly open, consistently full-throttle affair that simultaneously meant nothing and everything. Even if no prizes were on offer, there in plain sight was the proof that England\u2019s sights should be limitless: that, in delivering only their third win in 19 iterations of this fixture, they have set down a marker at a time of seemingly inexorable momentum. It was an evening to bathe in the glow, but also one on which to understand the shadows. Before kick-off a dozen of the first-ever official England women\u2019s team from 1972, led by their captain, Sheila Parker, were presented with caps in the home dressing room. Holding their new awards, given out 50 years too late, they formed a guard of honour for their modern-day successors and it was impossible to escape the poignancy. Every step forward taken by this team, by this sport, feels all the more necessary and loaded due to the neglect that came before. How Parker and her contemporaries must have delighted in the speed and imagination of England\u2019s front four, who ran an understrength USA defence into the ground and deserved the breaks that brought their goals. How they must have admired the class of Keira Walsh, star of the European Championship and now the world\u2019s most expensive player, who drew cheers in the 24th minute when she picked Rose Lavelle\u2019s pocket and broke the lines with yet another crisp pass to her attackers. And how they would have delighted in the moment if Lucy Bronze, blasting inches wide, had put a cherry on top after a counterattack that offered a showreel of this team\u2019s strengths in 10 exhilarating seconds. The visitors brought plenty of their own despite having darker clouds to navigate. Only Vlatko Andonovski\u2019s players will know whether the Yates report, which cast a shocking light on abuse and sexual misconduct in their domestic game upon its release on Monday, affected their collective or individual performances on the night. Megan Rapinoe and Becky Sauerbrunn had been among those to acknowledge the emotional burden it had placed in the buildup and the surest conclusion is that, with or without the bleak context, they performed outstandingly too.  If Sophia Smith, the 22-year-old from Portland Thorns who led the line thrillingly, had converted an early chance they would have established the kind of early cushion they rarely give up. But Smith atoned for that with a precise equaliser and came close to repeating the trick after half-time with a shot that trickled wide. Amid stiff competition she was the best forward on the pitch and alongside the even younger Trinity Rodman, whose cruelly disallowed goal was wonderfully worked, stated overwhelmingly that no eras ended upon Riem Hussein\u2019s full\u2011time whistle. When that sounded, Walsh raised her arms aloft in triumph. It was important that England kept the wave rolling here and the sound when Lauren Hemp opened the scoring, at the end of a breathless first 10 minutes, bore respectable comparison to the din when Chloe Kelly wrote history against Germany back in July from similar range. The crowd of almost 77,000 were engaged throughout, whether gently goading the visiting fans\u2019 chants or baying for yet another VAR decision to go their way, correctly as it happened. The way to pack out huge stadiums is to play with quality, intent, a taste for drama and to win through all of those. Only 14,389 were present in Milton Keynes when the USA last visited England in February 2015: an awful lot has gone right since then. Plenty more must continue to if past and lingering ills are to be banished for good. The teams stood behind a banner reading \u201cProtect the players\u201d after walking out, in pointed reference to the lack of safeguards identified in Sally Q Yates\u2019s findings. It seems inevitable that this sport will conduct further reckonings with itself. The 90 minutes that followed offered a brief antidote: a celebration of the reason anyone takes it upon themselves to do this at all. As Sarina Wiegman and her squad communed with their support one more time, it was easy to appreciate that anew. Whether or not this was an appetiser for the final of Australia and New Zealand 2023, that tournament will raise the bar yet further if it offers many spectacles of similar standard. This was a vibrant reprise of everything that saw England captivate an entire nation; it was also the timeliest reminder that football should offer wholesome, unfettered fun."

Now, this harrowing scene has been reconstructed in the four-part drama Litvinenko (all are on ITVX). Written by George Kay and directed by Jim Field Smith (alumni of Netflix\u2019s Criminal), this is the disturbing true story of organised Russian murder on British soil; the poison is believed to have been administered via a pot of tea. Early on, Litvinenko, played by David Tennant, faces sceptical detectives (Neil Maskell and Barry Sloane) with a quasi-theatrical flourish: \u201cI need to report a murder\u2026 mine.\u201d It isn\u2019t long before he\u2019s propped up on hospital pillows, encased in NHS blankets, sensors snaking over a pale chest. Hairless and sunken, Tennant, mumbling, lapsing into Russian, injects a sense of personality and humanity into what is effectively one long deathbed scene.  Litvinenko became a target after speaking out about Russian state corruption, and we see him emotionally contemplating his recently acquired British citizenship: \u201cThis country saved us.\u201d His wife, Marina (Margarita Levieva), is all twisting fingers and muted grief, while the police (including an almost unrecognisable close-cropped Mark Bonnar) stoically put the graft in. Halfway through the opener I wondered if the drama might be a little one-note \u2013 could I take three more episodes of Tennant sighing on plumped pillows, however devastating? \u2013 but the uneasy stillness is pulling me in.  Over to BBC One for the latest four-part Cormoran Strike mystery. Strike: Troubled Blood could have been entitled The Case of the Lost Mojo. What\u2019s happened to Strike, the dishevelled, PTSD-afflicted amputee war veteran detective from the Robert Galbraith (AKA JK Rowling) books? Played by Tom Burke, he\u2019s supposed to be fun \u2013 or at least enough of a bad boy to make you buy into the odd couple chemistry bubbling between him and resolute sidekick Robin (Holliday Grainger). But here, in the fifth series, based on the fifth book, Strike seems a mawkish, lifeless shadow of his former greatcoat-flapping self. The novel Troubled Blood was initially accused of transphobia, though that (a male murderer briefly adopting female clothing as a ploy) turned out to be overblown and is only glancingly referenced here. The story, set in London and Cornwall, concerns a cold case about a female doctor who went missing in 1974. What transpires is an overheated yarn involving snuff movies, gangsters and, at one particularly garbled point, occultist Aleister Crowley and star signs. It\u2019s too much, and I say that as an old goth who used to have an out-of-control tarot habit. A major problem is that Strike, mired in personal tragedy, now seems stuck at perma-morose, flattening the fizz between him and Robin. Are they going to get together? Going by this, you hope not, for her sake.  On BBC Two, Amol Rajan concluded his two-part docuseries How to Crack the Class Ceiling. I enjoyed the opener, a pithy examination of the invisible barriers to elite employment in areas such as high finance, media and law. The second instalment delivers yet more bleakness concerning \u201cclassism\u201d, \u201caccent-ism\u201d and \u201cclass-washing\u201d (equality schemes primarily run for good PR). It includes interviews with everyone from BBC director-general Tim Davie to Nadhim Zahawi, chairman of the Conservative party, presumably interviewed when he was part of the (polite word: fleeting) Liz Truss government, and rather pathetically billed on screen as \u201cminister for equalities, September-October 2022\u201d. Elsewhere, young working-class people are shown struggling to get on. One of them, Adnan, is devastated when he receives yet another rejection from a City finance firm. This is enraging, disheartening fare about a rigged system. Rajan is great with the young adults he speaks to: relaxed, kind and unpatronising. In another documentary, Undercover: Sexual Harassment \u2013 The Truth (Channel 4), Ellie Flynn looks into what women deal with by \u201cliving it\u201d on screen. She goes on dating sites as 18-year-old \u201cLucy\u201d and is besieged with \u201cdick pics\u201d and explicit messages. When the men are confronted by Flynn (all male faces and voices in the documentary are disguised), they babble weird, weak \u201creasons\u201d, among them the thought that she was \u201cplaying a game\u201d.  Elsewhere, Flynn looks into everything from the sexualisation of schoolgirl uniforms to drink spiking, while an array of women tell their own grim stories. In Liverpool and London, secretly filmed by a camera crew, Flynn poses as stumblingly drunk and alone. One man follows her back to her hotel room. Two other men pursue her together, one chillingly lurking at a distance. The alarming thing is how casual and normal it all is. While the documentary is sometimes unfocused, it delivers a terrifying insight into everyday 21st-century predators. I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019ve yet to recover from (spoiler alert) the nerve-shredding finale of Sky Atlantic\u2019s The White Lotus. It reduced me to a palpitating wreck, hissing at the screen: \u201cCome on, Tanya, get off the goddamn boat!\u201d While the atmosphere on that yacht of lost souls was sulphurous, fogged up with evil, Jennifer Coolidge as doomed, ditsy Tanya still managed to carry off creator Mike White\u2019s pitch-black humour (\u201cThese gays, they\u2019re trying to murder me!\u201d), pumping homicidal extortionist Quentin (Tom Hollander) with bullets, then plaintively inquiring if her husband was having an affair.  Tanya\u2019s demise, sinking operatically into the deep, provoked a question: is this how it\u2019s going to be each time an established character goes forward to the next White Lotus season? It also crowned a series that\u2019s had everything from debate-provoking bacchanalian excess to high-octane marital manoeuvring \u2013 and, always, that sense of the mask of wealth peeling back to reveal a grinning skull. Mike White is Tennessee Williams meets Quentin Tarantino. Increasingly, he strikes me as someone who doesn\u2019t trust success, even his own. His subversive instinct is to put audience expectations into a neat pile, then burn them. He\u2019ll see you next time.

                    "body": "Sarina Wiegman believes England cannot afford to sit still after their European Championship triumph because of how quickly all women\u2019s national teams are developing. The Lionesses play Austria at the Wiener Neustadt Stadium, south of Vienna, on Saturday night in their penultimate World Cup qualifying tie with a point enough to ensure their passage to next year\u2019s tournament.  \u201cWhen you\u2019re satisfied with what you\u2019re doing right now, you\u2019ve lost \u2013 because the game develops so much and every country is so eager to improve,\u201d said Wiegman, in the makeshift press room in a tent outside the 4,290-capacity stadium. \u201cThe players have already said this is just the start,\u201d she added. \u201cThis is just the beginning, a very good beginning by the way, but yes, I feel like even on 31 July we were partying but the players are already looking forward. \u201cWe want to qualify for the World Cup, of course, that\u2019s what we are supposed to do at the stage we\u2019re at and then we want to be successful.\u201d Beating Austria is not easy. The Euro 2017 semi-finalists reached the quarter-finals in July, only to be knocked out by Germany in a gripping and gritty encounter. \u201cThey have grown so much over the years,\u201d Wiegman said. \u201cIn 2017 they were really good in defence but in possession they\u2019ve grown a lot too, I think. They\u2019ve done a great job against us but also in their Germany game they were very good. They\u2019re a tough team, they\u2019re very well organised, but they also want to go forward, real direct. So, we really have to be at a really high level to be successful.\u201d The Lionesses have beaten Austria twice in the past year, in the reverse fixture in November 2021 at the Stadium of Light and at Old Trafford in the opening game of the Euros. Both times England won 1-0. Austria\u2019s manager, Irene Fuhrmann, said she had every player fit. \u201cFor us it\u2019s a special game: we play against a fantastic team that deserve to be European champions. \u201cWe want to make it as hard as possible for England. Our recent performances gave us some self-confidence. We can only do it together as a team and if we do that, we\u2019ve shown we can catch up with those big nations, but England is of course the favourite. \u201cFootball shows that everything is possible, but we need a magical night to take something from England and we\u2019re realistic about that, we know what\u2019s going on and who is the favourite.\u201d  For Wiegman there are decisions to make. The final two qualifiers, against Austria and at home to Luxembourg on Tuesday, will ensure England head to the World Cup, but there are enforced changes to the XI that began every game of the Euros. The record goalscorer, Ellen White, has retired and Fran Kirby has been left out of the squad with an unspecified injury. \u201cAfter every game you think: what did we do, what do we need? More attack? More defence? It\u2019s about the balance between those two things,\u201d said Wiegman. \u201cThat\u2019s what we do now, taking into account that the squad has changed a little bit so we have to change a little bit. But we\u2019re preparing, getting the balances right and then we make choices.\u201d In line to lead the attack in place of White is Alessia Russo, who came off the bench for the striker in England\u2019s six Euros games to great effect. \u201cI feel as if I haven\u2019t maybe made my name as a starting striker yet so I\u2019ve still got a lot of work to do,\u201d Russo said. Also in contention for the No 9 spot are Beth England, who has struggled with a lack of playing time at Chelsea; Nikita Parris, who has joined Manchester United in the hope of more minutes than she was able to accrue at Arsenal; and Ebony Salmon, who was not at the Euros but has scored eight goals in her first nine games for Houston Dash in the NWSL. \u201cEllen\u2019s left a gap that was full for a few years, so I think that it\u2019s obvious to everyone that the position is up for grabs,\u201d said Salmon. Wiegman added: \u201cWith Ebony, of course she was in camp last year in September, got some feedback. Now she has changed club, she\u2019s doing really well and we want to see her in our environment. \u201cOf course, the position of the No 9 is very competitive, all of the positions in the team are very competitive. I have made up my mind [about who will start] but I\u2019m not going to share that yet because we\u2019ve still got one training session, but I\u2019m happy with the way we are.\u201d"

                    "body": "The prospect of a UK beer shortage is looming as drivers and workers at a firm that makes about 40% of deliveries to UK pubs and clubs are to stage five days of strike action over pay and job cuts. About 1,000 drivers and dray workers \u2013 a person who delivers beer for a brewery \u2013 at GXO Logistics plan to stage a first round of strikes between 31 October and 4 November at depots across the UK. The Unite union said the strike would \u201cimpede the ability of pubs and other venues to replenish their cellars prior to the World Cup\u201d. Further action was planned for closer to kick-off on 20 November if the dispute was not resolved, it said.  The strikes would affect pubs and venues supplied by brewers including Heineken, Stonegate, Admiral Taverns and Shepherd Neame. GXO Logistics delivers to about 4,500 pubs in London and south-east England and has a network of 22 depots from Inverness to Southampton where rolling strike action will take place. A ban on overtime working will come into force from 24 October. The company said it had plans in place to ensure pubs and venues did not run dry if strikes interrupted its regular schedule of deliveries. \u201cWe are in constant contact with our customers and should a strike go ahead, we have business continuity plans in place to ensure they are adequately stocked and minimise impact on consumers,\u201d a spokesperson for GXO said. The US-based firm reported $777m (\u00a3690m) in revenues from its UK operations in the three months to the end of June, its biggest single source of its $2.2bn global revenues for the quarter. Total adjusted profits reached $176m in the second quarter. UK workers rejected a 5% pay offer, in a deal that included a reduction in sick pay. \u201cGXO can easily afford to pay and Unite is determined to see that they do,\u201d the union\u2019s general secretary, Sharon Graham, said. The dispute with management also involves plans to close the GXO depot in Dagenham, Essex, which will result in job cuts and an increase in the workload for drivers at its Croydon, Faversham and Greenford sites. GXO said the union\u2019s version of the pay deal was \u201cinaccurate and misleading\u201d and that the strike action was putting its \u201cmembers, the hospitality sector and consumers at risk of unnecessary disruption\u201d. The company said the proposal on the table represented an average 9.2% pay increase and there was no impact on sick pay. \u201cThe offer is highly competitive and follows an above-inflation annual pay raise of 4% last year,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe increase exceeds the industry average and, in every region, earnings for our drivers are above both the regional and national averages."

                    "body": "Cale Makar barely broke a smile after scoring his second goal and Colorado\u2019s seventh of the night. He fist-bumped Mikko Rantanen to thank him for the pass and skated to the bench. He and the Avalanche are calm, confident and rolling. They\u2019re now two wins from dethroning the two-time defending champions. Looking like by far the better team, the Avalanche overwhelmed the Tampa Bay Lightning 7-0 in Game 2 of the Stanley Cup final on Saturday night to take a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven series. Coach Jared Bednar called it \u201cas close to perfect of a game as you can get from your players.\u201d \u201cI feel like we played to our identity to a \u2018T\u2019 tonight,\u201d Makar said. \u201cWe had some good goals and stuff like that. ... It was a little bit of a weird one tonight. Obviously, we\u2019re getting opportunities but guys were able to able to capitalize, so that\u2019s good part.\u201d Valeri Nichushkin scored his seventh and eighth goals of the playoffs and continued to be the best player on the ice in the final, Game 1 overtime hero Andre Burakovsky beat Andrei Vasilevskiy again and even defensive defenseman Josh Manson and 35-year-old grinder Darren Helm got in on the fun with a goal apiece. Makar, who didn\u2019t even have a shot on goal in Game 1, scored twice in the third period, inciting chants of \u201cWe want the Cup!\u201d from a fired up crowd. \u201cThey\u2019re playing at an elite level right now give them credit. We are not,\u201d Lightning coach Jon Cooper said. \u201cThey\u2019re two good teams. They\u2019re just playing a much higher level right now than we are.\u201d Rarely have the Lightning been completely outclassed during this run of postseason success, but they also hadn\u2019t faced an opponent like the Avalanche, who forced them into one uncharacteristic mistake after another. Colorado was dominant in every facet of the game to move two victories away from its first title since 2001 and the first by this core led by Nathan MacKinnon. The Avalanche go to Tampa for Game 3 on Monday night up in the series despite no goals in the series from MacKinnon, who at times has played like a man possessed in an effort to finally break though and hoist the Cup. They still became just the third team in NHL history to score three-plus goals in the first period of Games 1 and 2 in the final. \u201cWe played a pretty good game,\u201d Helm said. \u201cWe just played a full 60-minute game.\u201d  The dominant performance started by pouncing on an early mistake by typically reliable Lightning defenseman Erik Cernak when he bobbled the puck at the blue line on one of the game\u2019s first shifts. It was all Avalanche after that. Their aggressive forecheck led them to draw a penalty on veteran Ryan McDonagh, score on the ensuing power play when Burakovsky fed Nichushkin for his first of the night. It wasn\u2019t his last, and Colorado poured it on with six of the game\u2019s first seven shots and complete territorial domination with much of the game played in the Tampa Bay end. With Vasilevskiy whose play was the key to the Lightning\u2019s incredible ability to bounce back after a loss in the playoffs looking shaky and even dropping his head after letting Makar beat him clean on one of many 2-on-1 rushes, the Avalanche made the most of all their offensive zone time. The highest-scoring team this postseason put on a clinic against the team that has played more hockey than anyone else over the past two years. That may finally be taking its toll, and it\u2019s exacerbated by the blazing speed with which the Avalanche play. They again not only outskated the Lightning but used quick feet to force errors that turned into goals. \u201cWe came out with a purpose,\u201d said forward Andew Cogliano, who returned after missing Game 1 with a right finger injury. \u201cWe got to our game, we skated from the drop of the puck and we just didn\u2019t let up.\u201d Tampa Bay fell to 18-2 after a loss since the start of the first round in 2020. The streak of 18 in a row ended in the Eastern Conference final against the New York Rangers when the Lightning fell behind 2-0 before roaring back, though it\u2019s hard to see Colorado falling into the same trap. The way the Lightning lost this one by far their biggest blowout loss during this run came as a surprise to just about everyone. \u201cAm I shocked that we lost 7-zip?\u201d Lightning captain Steven Stamkos said. \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t think we saw that coming.\u201d Even if players brush off the concept of momentum from game to game during a playoff series, their romp over the champs combined with a 7-0 road record should fill the Avalanche with confidence. But they might again need to dip into their pool of depth because of injuries. After getting Andrew Cogliano back from missing the season opener with a right finger injury, the Avalanche lost Burakovsky again in the second period. Burakovsky blocked a shot in the first game in the West final and has been playing through pain since. Bednar said he would be re-evaluated ahead of Game 2. Colorado is inflicting plenty of pain on Tampa Bay, which resorted to some rough stuff after falling behind. Of course, even MacKinnon was throwing hits in the third period despite the game being well in hand. Darcy Kuemper was barely tested in net for Colorado, picking up the shutout with 17 saves. \u201cHe was just rock solid,\u201d Manson said. \u201cHe was exactly what we needed to be.\u201d"

                    "body": "There was an obvious determination among England\u2019s grand slam winners to savour the moment after completing their clean sweep against France on Saturday but it was back to reality soon enough for Simon Middleton\u2019s side. England teams tend to travel with British Airways \u2013 one of the Rugby Football Union\u2019s sponsors \u2013 but the airline does not fly from Biarritz and it was an early start and a lengthy coach journey the morning after the night before. For whatever reason no extra flight was chartered.  It serves as a reminder that for all the progress made during the competition \u2013 two record crowds in Leicester and Gloucester and a sold-out stadium in Bayonne on Saturday, not to mention a peak BBC Two audience of 700,000 \u2013 there is much more to be made. England can at least take solace that in every other facet they exude professionalism and this Six Nations triumph in which they scored 45 tries, conceding just four, may yet prove to be a significant moment in the history of the sport. For it has jolted their rivals into belated action over contracting players and, though the gap is a chasm between England, France and the rest there now seems a will to act. The image of Ireland\u2019s Aoife McDermott back at work the day after facing England has endured and Sarah Bern, scorer of two of the Red Roses\u2019 tries on Saturday, issued a warning over the welfare of players who face such situations. \u201cI have a lot of friends who play for Wales, Scotland and Ireland [and] it is really hard work,\u201d she said. \u201cThings need to change not just for the rugby but for the girls\u2019 own mental health. I\u2019m always there to fight for their corner because I think everyone should have equal opportunity.\u201d If change is coming, it is unlikely to bear fruit on the pitch before the World Cup this autumn \u2013 and it can be said with some certainty that England, France or New Zealand will be crowned champions in Auckland in November. The victory for England on Saturday was telling in that regard because, while France were competitive, Middleton\u2019s side remain a cut above. It would be no surprise, though, if he spent much of the coach journey pondering recent events in New Zealand.  The Black Ferns have won five of the past six World Cups but were emphatically beaten by both England and France last autumn. There were mitigating circumstances \u2013 the pandemic is the most obvious among them \u2013 but it has forced the union into considerable action. Wayne Smith has been appointed director of rugby, Sir Graham Henry is on board in a supporting role and Whitney Hansen \u2013 daughter of Steve \u2013 is among the assistants. Middleton, then, will be pitting his wits against three of the most famous names in All Black history. \u201cA lot has happened in the Black Ferns camp since the autumn,\u201d he said. \u201cWe look at the moves they\u2019ve made, it\u2019s a massive mark of respect for the game. What will be interesting is how their new coaching structure changes them because it is a different sort of environment that you have to create. It\u2019ll be interesting to see how they go but it\u2019s exciting to pit your wits against coaches of that calibre.\u201d Middleton\u2019s squad will return to their clubs this week but come July World Cup preparations will ramp up. England have warm-up Tests planned for September and there is already a realisation that improvements must be made before they leave for New Zealand. \u201cWe know what we\u2019ve got to do to be classed as a great side but we\u2019re getting there,\u201d Middleton said. Indeed, if England were defensively defiant against France and dominant at the set-piece, it was not a match that will live long in the memory. Middleton said: \u201cWe need to find a way to free the girls up so they feel like they can play a bit more.\u201d  It is a message not lost on his players, to which Bern\u2019s determination attested: \u201cTo sit here and say we\u2019ve got this in the bag would be stupid. We know there\u2019s so much more we want to work on. New Zealand have got some brilliant coaches coming in. France we know will always come back for the fight. \u201cEveryone will turn up for the World Cup. We need to make sure we\u2019re there and as turned up as everyone else.\u201d"

                    "body": "Toulon had been hoping to replicate the old glory days of Jonny Wilkinson and co but it was Lyon who emerged with the Challenge Cup spoils on a warm night in the south of France. This is the first European title ever claimed by the up-and-coming Top 14 side and, with their confidence now boosted, it is unlikely to be the last.  They might have won by an even wider margin, having been denied at least three more potential first-half tries, but were still good enough to turn a slender 10-7 half-time advantage into a 20-point cushion by the start of the final quarter. Lyon\u2019s coach Pierre Mignoni, ironically, is returning to Toulon this summer and will hope this outcome has a suitably galvanising effect on the losers. As an occasion it proved to be a slightly mixed aperitif for the main event involving Leinster and La Rochelle. Toulon may have seen off Saracens in some style in the semi-final but, with their international winger Gabin Villi\u00e8re forced off prematurely with a knee injury, they could not summon anything like the same zest and inspiration. It was, even so, another indicator of the growing appetite for big rugby occasions in France. The crowd of over 51,000 was a record attendance for a Challenge Cup final and, amid the spills and occasional thrills, there were a few more reminders for the watching Eddie Jones that Les Bleus will take some beating at next year\u2019s Rugby World Cup. Jones and his assistant coaches were also on a scouting mission to check out the ground where England will potentially play a quarter-final. If this steep-sided, curving arena is even half as noisy and atmospheric in the absence of Toulon\u2019s fanatical supporters, it will be special regardless of the weather. The temperature was still up around 26 degrees celsius at 9pm local time when the game kicked off but it was Lyon who initially kept the cooler heads. Only a belatedly spotted knock-on in the buildup prevented Baptiste Couilloud from scoring with barely a minute gone and the scrum-half had a legal try on the board after eight minutes.  The great Sergio Parisse dearly wanted another trophy to crown a remarkable career but, unfortunately for him, his pass found his opposite number Jordan Taufua, once of Leicester. The Lyon captain surged away and also had the presence of mind, when tackled, to pop the ball up off the floor to the supporting Couilloud. A sluggish Toulon, though, were waking up and their own international scrum-half, Baptiste Serin, started and finished a compelling move which dragged his side back into the contest. Nerves then appeared to constrain both teams for a while before the first 40 minutes ended in dramatic circumstances when the young Georgian wing Davit Niniashvili appeared to have put Lyon, already 10-7 ahead, further in front with a try just before the interval. On closer inspection, though, it was discovered that the tip of his left boot had grazed the dead-ball line, a sharp-eyed decision which may preclude the English TMO, Ian Tempest, from holidaying in the Burgundy region this summer. There had already been some Lyon muttering at the decision not to review a possible try by Charlie Ngatai, with Aymeric Luc\u2019s supposed in-goal grounding of the ball not entirely supported by the video evidence.  Lyon\u2019s luck, though, was about to change. Between the 45th and 50th minutes they collected 14 priceless points, the first of them a fully deserved penalty try when Luc was sin-binned for the most blatant of last-gasp slapdowns which denied Niniashvili, assuming he would have put it down legally this time, a certain score. Against 14 men the powerful Josua Tuisova made good ground and L\u00e9o Berdeu\u2019s well-judged chip fell nicely for his centre Pierre-Louis Barassi. Another Berdeu penalty stretched the lead further, effectively snuffing out Toulon\u2019s hopes of joining Wasps, Bath, Northampton and Leinster and becoming the first French side to do the Heineken Cup and Challenge Cup \u2018double\u2019. Despite final quarter yellow cards for Berdeu and Ngatai and a late consolation try for the otherwise quiet Cheslin Kolbe, there was to be no reprieve for Toulon, beaten in the Challenge Cup finals of 2010, 2012 and 2020 and now required to deal with another frustrating showpiece loss."

Serie A, which relies on broadcasting rights for more than half of its revenues, lags behind the English Premier League and other major leagues in Europe in terms of income. \nSerie A clubs discussed plans to set up a media unit at a closed-door meeting on Friday, the league\u2019s president Lorenzo Casini told reporters during a press briefing. \u201cBy the end of November, we will decide whether to pursue the media unit project, or make different choices,\u201d Casini said. \nSpain\u2019s La Liga and France\u2019s Ligue 1 have clinched deals to sell part of their media business to private equity funds to sustain investments after the pandemic hit clubs\u2019 finances hard. Germany\u2019s Bundesliga is also considering following suit. \nNew York-based Searchlight Capital as well as a group of funds led by Carlyle comprising Apax and Three Hills Capital have expressed a preliminary interest in buying into Serie A\u2019s broadcasting rights. \nSerie A\u2019s review of the media unit project pre-empts an upcoming round of broadcasting tenders next year.

Nine European nations, including Group B rivals England and Wales, want to wear the rainbow-coloured OneLove armbands in a country where same-sex relationships are criminalised.\nFifa has yet to give approval to the wearing of the armband in the tournament, which starts on November 20 - the day before Wales\u2019 opening game against the United States. It is understood the Football Association is prepared to incur a fine or any other sanction Fifa may impose and let England captain Harry Kane wear the armband, although the FA has yet to publicly comment on any prospective punishment for doing so.\nLike Kane, Wales captain Gareth Bale wore the OneLove armband in the Nations League last month and Mooney has now outlined the FAW\u2019s stance. \u201cWe have put in a request to Fifa to wear the armband and we\u2019re very comfortable with that,\u201d Mooney said. \u201cThe armband has Cymraeg (Welsh) on it as well as OneLove. Our view is that he (Bale) will be wearing it.\u201d\nAsked if the armband would be worn even if a fine was incurred, Mooney replied: \u201cWith pleasure. We\u2019ve made our statement clear and we will live our values over there. We haven\u2019t got an answer yet from Fifa, we\u2019re waiting to see how that goes.\u201d\nThe FAW plans to contact Fifa over calls for Group B opponents Iran to be thrown out of the World Cup. A formal request has been sent to the FIFA Council and president Gianni Infantino to suspend the Iranian Football Federation from world football for banning women from games in Iran.\nA letter signed by high-profile Iranian sporting figures and sent by a Spanish law firm on their behalf says gender discrimination in Iran breaches Fifa\u2019s laws. Iran meet England in their World Cup opener on November 21, and the legal challenge comes with the country swept by nationwide protests since the death of Mahsa Amini last month.\n\nAmini had been detained by the country\u2019s police over her clothing. Mooney said: \u201cIt\u2019s alarming to see what\u2019s happening on the streets of Tehran. We are monitoring the situation and we will speak to FIFA over the next few days. We will also communicate with Welsh Government to get a position for ourselves as a nation going out there. That is something we have to consider.\n\u201cI obviously have sympathy for people who feel their human rights are not being respected. Cymru (Wales) is a country that has always showed support and solidarity to the person who feels downtrodden. If the working class people of Iran feel downtrodden, we are here to show solidarity in union with them.\u201d\nQatar\u2019s World Cup chief executive Nasser Al Khater has said England and Wales should focus on their teams\u2019 preparations for the tournament rather than demanding compensation for migrant workers or making political statements. Amnesty International insisted this week the task to improve conditions for migrant workers in Qatar is only half done and must not stop when the tournament is over.\n\u201cThe FAW has a view on the world and world issues,\u201d Mooney said. \u201cWhen we see something that\u2019s wrong or standards not being met, I do believe that we should call it out. It would be wrong of us to ignore the world around us. But we are in a group discussing these issues and we have been encouraged by what we\u2019re hearing from the Qataris on their future. We hope this will be a big step forward for the region, and the world, and we\u2019re happy to play a big part in it.\u201d (PA Media)\n\nUpdated at 4.57pm BST\n\n\n 4.41pm  \n\nAlastair Horne reckons Campbell\u2019s famous run and near-wonder-goal for England in 1998 was against Tunisia.

Of course he was asked about Gerrard\u2019s sacking: \u201cI am sure he will come back from that,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cI\u2019ve been seven years at Liverpool, and we\u2019ve not met a lot for different reasons, but we created a close relationship and I\u2019ve always followed him. We had a quick exchange this morning, nothing too deep.\n\u201cI can imagine it\u2019s disappointing for him because of the things he wanted to achieve at Aston Villa. We all get knocks \u2013 it\u2019s about how you respond. These things can happen. A lot of great managers out there had to leave clubs for different reasons. He will be back.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 1.31pm BST\n\n\n 1.20pm  \n\nNews from Scotland:\nStephen Robinson wants St Mirren to keep their improving home form going when they host Dundee United in the Premiership on Saturday. The Buddies are unbeaten in the league in Paisley since the opening-day defeat by Motherwell at the end of July. \n\u201cWe want to build on that,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cSo it was important that we didn\u2019t get beat last week, we kept the run going and it is another opportunity. Dundee United have improved, they have picked up results recently outwith the cup game. They have a good squad, they have very experienced players, they spent a lot of money putting the squad together and there are some big names in there as well, so we are under no illusions. \n\u201cI watched them against Kilmarnock and there wasn\u2019t a lot in it. We played them already, we know their threats and we feel it is a game we can take to them. It was a very good result the last time (at Tannadice). We caught them on a bad day, we played very well on the day and it was the perfect away performance. We are wary of their threats but believe, like every team, they have weaknesses and we aim to try to exploit them.\u201d (PA Media)\n\n\n\n\n 1.16pm  \nBaraclough sacked by Northern Ireland\n\nIan Baraclough has been sacked as Northern Ireland manager after a dismal Nations League campaign saw fans turn against the 51-year-old. Baraclough, who replaced Michael O\u2019Neill in June 2020, had been under pressure after his side collected only five points from a possible 18 in League C, finding themselves battling relegation in a campaign in which they had targeted promotion. \nIrish FA chief executive Patrick Nelson said: \u201cUnder Ian\u2019s stewardship we have seen the introduction of new players who will wear the green jersey with pride for years to come and for this we place on record our gratitude. However, in light of the overall record of results on the pitch, the Irish FA board has subsequently taken this decision.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 1.14pm  \n\nThe one like Pep Guardiola will be having a chat at 1.30pm, it says here.\n\n\n\n 1.12pm  \n\n\u201cGerrard was a gamble that didn\u2019t work out,\u201d emails Gavin Stamp.\" \u201cHis was Villa\u2019s most daring appointment since Jozef Venglos and sadly it turned out the same way, with dour football and terrible results. Clearly axing Dean Smith was a serious mistake. The club seems to be jinxed at the moment. Even when it shows ambition and ingenuity, things don\u2019t work out. We\u2019re so far off where we were in the 80s, 90s and noughties that it\u2019s hard to know where to head next. There\u2019s no obvious replacement. The club\u2019s plight means it will likely have to turn to a battle-hardened escapologist, whose lifespan will always be limited, rather than a proven winner with European experience capable of taking us to the next level. That said, if Simeone can be persuaded to leave Atletico Madrid, that would be one helluva statement.\u201d\nAh, the 1990s \u2026 \n\n\n\n\n 1.09pm  \n\nA couple of things that dropped overnight, firstly the MLS playoffs:\n\nAnd something on the Matildas\u2019 preparation for next year\u2019s World Cup:\n\n\n\n\n 1.06pm  \n\nOver on the Premier League\u2019s Twitter, to mark Black History Month, they are celebrating the top-flight career of the great centre-back Sol Campbell. \nHe was just 14 minutes away from scoring the winner in the Champions League final, too, before Eto\u2019s pesky equaliser for Barcelona:\n\n\nUpdated at 1.06pm BST\n\n\n 12.56pm  \n\nThe Crystal Palace manager, Patrick Vieira, is asked about Wilfried Zaha\u2019s future: \u201cThere is speculation on all good players who are [nearly] at the end of their contract. The only thing we can do is to show him the love we have for him \u2026 and the way he\u2019s been playing, I think he is sending back the love as well.\n\u201cThere is no trouble, there is no losing energy on that situation. We know how important he is for us. And I think he understands that he is a big player in this football club. We expect a lot from him and Wilfried loves to have that kind of pressure on his shoulders \u2026 we will do everything we can to keep him at this football club.\u201d\nWas Gerrard\u2019s sacking harsh? \u201cI think we are in the industry where we say that the long-term in our job is the next five games. So this is the business that we are in. It\u2019s really ruthless. It\u2019s really tough \u2026 But I don\u2019t have any doubt on Stevie getting back and doing what he loves around the game.\n\u201cWe managers will go through periods where we will get sacked and we just have to bounce back. He was a strong player, and I don\u2019t have any doubts about his mental strength to get back into what I\u2019m sure he loves doing.\u201d\nOn Everton tomorrow: \u201cA tough one, we know how difficult it is to go there because of the pressure and the atmosphere. We have to be prepared.\n\u201cLast year we had a really good first half and in the second half it wasn\u2019t good enough and we gave them an opportunity to get back into the game \u2026 we will have to be ready to compete and to perform as best as we can.\u201d\nVieira is asked about Black History Month, and the Best of Africa Lifetime Achievement award he collected recently: \u201cI think it\u2019s really important to remind ourselves that there\u2019s good black people who are doing good things around the world \u2026 when you are looking at our football world, when you look at the number of managers around, the number of journalists you have in the room, I don\u2019t think there is enough diversity, I would say \u2026 I think we have to use, again, football, and what\u2019s going on on the field, to show what the world is all about, this kind of diversity, where we can accept all our differences and live well together.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 1.01pm BST\n\n\n 12.41pm  \n\nAndy Hunter is at the Liverpool press conference, and reports that Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez is an injury doubt for this weekend\u2019s match against Nottingham Forest following his goal-scoring turn against West Ham in midweek:\n\n\nUpdated at 1.00pm BST\n\n\n 12.36pm  \n\nThe Brighton manager, Roberto de Zerbi, chips in on Gerrard\u2019s sacking: \u201cI\u2019m sorry for him, but this is the football ... in the Premier League, in Serie A, other countries ... when the results don\u2019t arrive, it\u2019s a problem for the coach, no?\n\u201cThis is the rule of football.\u201d\n\n\n\n 12.31pm  \n\nAfter last night\u2019s defeat by Leicester, Jesse Marsch said the following: \u201cIn both boxes we are not helping ourselves, but right now we have to find ways to stop the bleeding. We have to fight and be ready for what is to come. I am here and I am doing everything I can to help this team.\n\u201cThe league is tough, we\u2019re not getting enough out of it right now, and we\u2019ve got to figure out some solutions.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 12.28pm  \n\nNow, what else is going on? Patrick Vieira is speaking soon before Crystal Palace\u2019s trip to Everton tomorrow afternoon.\n\n\n\n 12.26pm  \n\nJamie Jackson reports from Erik ten Hag\u2019s media conference and his words on Ronaldo:\n\n\n\n\n 12.22pm  \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen and heard some real twaddle being spoken about Gerrard in recent weeks and months, especially by ex-players and pundits who seem to have little knowledge of what\u2019s actually been going on at Villa in the last year or so,\u201d emails Tom Duggins.\n\u201cThe players haven\u2019t always performed, yes, but I suspect that\u2019s because they had a strong dislike for the guy, as many of the fans have eventually come to share. Things went drastically downhill as soon as Michael Beale left, leading everyone to the sensible conclusion that he \u2013 in Gerrard\u2019s own words \u2013 really was the \u2018brains of the operation\u2019. The football has been turgid and predictable for months, with SG persisting with a narrow 4-3-3 that is easy to defend against and limits the creative talents of our best players. We look like one of the worst coached teams, if not the worst, in the league for a reason: he clearly wasn\u2019t up to the job. His dour manner and incredible arrogance only compounded the situation as it meant the fans came to detest him.\u201d\n\n\n\n 12.16pm  \n\nCristiano Ronaldo\u2019s latest walkout on Manchester United marked two significant endings. The final curtain on supporters\u2019 unconditional love for a pouting superstar who as an unused replacement could not stomach sticking around to celebrate a scintillating win over Tottenham. It is also the death knell of this 37-year-old being of relevance \u2013 to Erik ten Hag and the United side he seeks to build \u2013 underlined by the manager dropping him from the squad for Saturday\u2019s game at Chelsea.\n\n\n\n\n 12.11pm  \n\nFor anyone that missed it, Manchester United\u2019s statement about Ronaldo-Gate was short and to the point:\n\u201cCristiano Ronaldo will not be part of the Manchester United squad for this Saturday\u2019s Premier League game against Chelsea.\n\u201cThe rest of the squad is fully focused on preparing for that fixture.\u201d\n\n\n\n 12.05pm  \n\nNow, for balance, in the comments Esdaile reckons the Aston Villa players, and not Gerrard, are really to blame:\n\u201cWho would be a football manager! Gerrard showed so much early promise both at Rangers and in his first months at Villa where he got off to a pretty good start. What has gone wrong? The real question is should the board have given him more time to sort things out and get underperforming players playing again. I think the answer to that is yes and football history is littered with managers who go through a difficult period to emerge as successful. I\u2019m sure someone has done an analysis of the outcome of manager replacement mid-season and how effective it is. No doubt other clubs will be looking at offering him a job on the crazy managerial merry go round.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 12.06pm BST\n\n\n 12.02pm  \n\nAn impressively composed and clear performance from Erik Ten Hag there, when questioned on the latest instalment of the interminable Cristiano Ronaldo drama.\n\n\n\n 11.56am  \nTen Hag says Ronaldo refused to come off bench against Spurs\n\nThe pre-Chelsea press conference begins and the Manchester United manager, Erik Ten Hag, is of course asked about Cristiano Ronaldo first up.\nWhat was said after Ronaldo walked off on Wednesday during the win against Spurs? \u201cIt\u2019s between Cristiano and me. The statement is also clear, I think,\u201d says Ten Hag.\nDoes he have a role in future? \u201cYes. That\u2019s also in the statement. He makes an important part of the squad.\u201d\nDid Ronaldo refuse to come on to the pitch on Wednesday? \u201cYes.\n\u201cI\u2019m the manager. I\u2019m responsible for the top sports culture here ... and I have to set standards and values and I have to control them.\n\u201cWe are in a team, in a team we have standards, we have values and I have to control that. So after Rayo Vallecano [when Ronaldo and others left the pre-season friendly early] I told him it was unacceptable. But he wasn\u2019t the only one. That is for everyone.\n\u201cThe second time, there will be consequences. ... that is now what we did, we miss him [against Chelsea] tomorrow, that\u2019s a miss for us, for the squad, but I think it\u2019s important for the attitude, for the mentality from the group. Now we have to focus on Chelsea and that\u2019s the most important.\u201d\nDoes Ten Hag expect him to apologise? What will leaving him out of the squad achieve? \u201cI think it\u2019s also for everyone else, I said a warning at the start of the season. The next time, it has to be consequence ... when you are living together, playing together ... you have to fulfil certain standards.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 12.44pm BST\n\n\n 11.43am  \n\n\u201cGerrard is just the latest in a long line of brilliant footballers who were unable to translate that prodigious ability to management,\u201d comments UncleKarlM. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy transition, but realising you haven\u2019t got the ability would save a lot of heartache, both for self and fans! I hope he finds a niche commensurate with his abilities.\u201d\nIs that a thinly-veiled reference to a bright future career in punditry?\n\n\nUpdated at 11.44am BST\n\n\n 11.39am  \n\nThe Manchester United press conference is coming up in five minutes, according to the timings on their official app.\n\nUpdated at 11.40am BST\n\n\n 11.39am  \n\n\u201cOne of the most impressive things we\u2019ve seen from Erik ten Hag is how he\u2019s managed Ronaldo.\u201d comments DamoOfOxford. \u201cNo awe, no special treatment, team first. No one is safe.\n\u201cLikely best for Ronaldo to go in January, but Rashford\u2019s profligacy the other night (despite a very good game otherwise and the fact he\u2019s never going to be a true No 9) show\u2019s why we needed Ronaldo in the squad in the absence of a regularly fit centre forward. Erik ten Hag is what the club has needed for years.\u201d\nTen Hag did say after the Man City thrashing that he didn\u2019t bring Ronaldo on \u2018out of respect for his career\u2019. Which was odd. But despite that looking suspiciously like special treatment, I think that assessment of Ten Hag\u2019s handling of Ronaldo is correct.\n\n\n\n 11.23am  \n\nEddie Howe also had kind words for Gerrard following his dismissal by Aston Villa: \u201cDisappointed for Steve, I think he\u2019s a very, very good manager and I think it just goes to show the short-term nature of everyone\u2019s thinking,\u201d said Howe \u201cWe\u2019re in a very volatile job \u2026 I\u2019ve got no doubt on his quality and I am sure he\u2019ll be back very soon. I was thinking about him last night. That could be any of us, at any stage, and I always feel for a manger who loses his job.\u201d\n\n\n\n 11.20am  \n\n\u201cPlease accept my apologies if these are incredibly basic questions about the modern machinations of football management,\u201d emails Bill Preston.\n\u201cStevieG his backroom staff all going from Villa makes me curious. Is it now common for managers to bring their entourage with them into club, and all depart together when the gaffer gets the old heave-ho?\n\u201cThis makes me think further, which is never good. \n\u201cIsn\u2019t it counterproductive in that a huge hole gets left on departure, and limits longer-term employees chances of moving up the trade, if they don\u2019t have a coat tail to ride (which sounds awful, but is the only way I can think to phrase it)?\u201d\nThanks for the email Bill. Yes, it\u2019s frequently the case that a manager comes and goes with a big backroom team, and yes, the regular hiring-and-firing done by clubs means a massive amount of upheaval. As you rightly point out, it\u2019s frequently unfair on staff within the clubs who have more knowledge and deserve a chance.\nThe fact that Gerrard\u2019s team are leaving would seem to suggest Villa have lined up a big-name replacement who will come with a big team. But let\u2019s see.\n\n\n\n 11.14am  \n\nThe Southampton manager, Ralph Hassenh\u00fcttl, was asked about Gerrard\u2019s sacking by Villa. He straight-batted the question, while pointing out that firing the last manager didn\u2019t really do the trick either:\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame when a manager loses his job. If they [Aston Villa\u2019s board] think it will be a better situation, they should sack him, like they did with Dean Smith, although it didn\u2019t work really ... It\u2019s up to them. It\u2019s their decision. It\u2019s not up to us to discuss this.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 11.15am BST\n\n\n 11.12am  \n\nManchester United\u2019s Fred said his football has improved as a result of his partnership with compatriot Casemiro after the Brazilian midfielders impressed in a 2-0 Premier League win over Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday. Bruno Fernandes and Fred scored as United clinched victory after dominating the game from start to finish.\nThe midweek win was the third straight game in which Fred and Casemiro played alongside each other, with coach Erik ten Hag having previously preferred a midfield pairing of Scott McTominay and Christian Eriksen. \u201cI\u2019m very happy playing next to Casemiro. He\u2019s a big player for the Brazilian team, we\u2019ve already played a long time together in that team,\u201d Fred told the National in an interview published on Thursday.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important being side-by-side with him and playing with him improves my football. (Casemiro and McTominay) are both very important. Everybody knows (Casemiro\u2019s) qualities and how important he is for the team, and Scott is also a great player.\u201d United, who are fifth in the league, travel to fourth-placed Chelsea tomorrow. (Reuters)\n\nUpdated at 11.12am BST\n\n\n 11.06am  \n\nFor the Brighton captain, Victoria Williams, overcoming her struggle with, in her own words, \u201ca lack of self-confidence\u201d, has been one of the biggest hurdles in her playing career. In fact, it is one of the reasons she wants to talk today, when we meet in a function room at her club\u2019s training complex. \n\u201cI think there\u2019s probably quite a lot of people in the same position, where you feel like you don\u2019t fit in,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I just want to say: you do. You just have to find the right environment for yourself.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 11.03am  \n\nMy sources (the Guardian\u2019s Gregg Bakowski) tell me the Manchester United press conference is coming up at 11.30am, so I shall be tuning in for that one, all being well, and bringing you the latest from Erik ten Hag on Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s latest tantrum.\n\n\n\n 11.00am  \n\nHalf-time interviews were previously a staple on ITV\u2019s Champions League coverage, I seem to remember, Gabriel Clarke often being able to nab a few words with Fergie in the tunnel.\nThere was also Graham Taylor\u2019s \u201cYou play football with your heads\u201d in Poland during England\u2019s infamously unsuccessful bid to qualify for the World Cup in 1994.\n\n\n\n 10.54am  \n\nManagers at the World Cup will have the option of doing half-time interviews, with Fifa deciding to follow the Premier League in exploring the possibility of providing greater access to television viewers. It is thought unlikely that many teams will take up such offers but managers such as Gareth Southgate could provide half-time insight in Qatar.\n\n\n\n\n 10.53am  \n\n\u201cGerrard was a disaster,\u201d writes Spikey78 in the BTL comments. \u201cTactically inept, inflexible and seems unable to motivate. Other teams are out-running the opposition. Even Leeds who are relatively struggling give everything.\n\u201cWe lack energy, we always seek to slow the game down (often time wasting 10 minutes in), several players have gone backwards under his tenure. We offloaded Target, El Ghazi, Trezeguet &amp; Traore, without improving or at least replacing on what they brought to the squad. We played 10-man Leeds, and Nottingham Forest, and failed to create anything of note.\n\u201cOur next run of fixtures could easily see us adrift at the bottom by Boxing day. Great decision to roll the dice. Steven needs to go to the Championship to finally learn his trade.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 11.04am BST\n\n\n 10.44am  \n\nJamie Carragher, Gerrard\u2019s former Liverpool teammate, has been speaking to his current employers on Sky Sports News about Gerrard\u2019s plight.\n\u201cYou can always look at the players, but every manager knows when he goes into a job, if the players are not performing at their best, it is the manager who is going to carry the can,\u201d Carragher said. \u201cStevie is well aware of that. I\u2019m sure he will be disappointed with certain performances, from individuals and the team.\n\u201cBut when you go into management, you know the price on the ticket - and if results are not right or whether the players are letting you down or not performing, it is the manager that carries the can. That is always the case and that is the brutal part of football management.\n\u201cI\u2019m really not sure if Stevie would go back in [to a management role] or wait 12 months. I spoke to him a few days ago about the upcoming games and he\u2019s not daft, he knows the situation,\u201d Carragher said.\n\u201cIt will be really interesting. That\u2019s not what I have spoken to him about, whether he wants to be a manager for the next 20 years or he will pick certain jobs that will appeal to him. I think that is what he has done with his jobs that he has picked. Whether Stevie would drop down to the Championship I am really not sure.\u201d (Quotes via PA Media)\n\n\nUpdated at 10.45am BST\n\n\n 10.34am  \n\nEddie Howe\u2019s been having a chat. The Press Association have kindly written it up:\nThe Newcastle head coach Eddie Howe has defended the club\u2019s decision to return to Saudi Arabia for a warm-weather training camp. The Magpies, who are 80% owned by Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund, confirmed on Friday morning that they will go to Riyadh between 4-10 December after making a similar trip to Jeddah in January. \nAsked about the criticism that trip might spark, Howe said: \u201cWe\u2019ve made a football decision. We\u2019ve looked at the World Cup break, what\u2019s the best thing for the team. The best thing for the team, I believe, is to take the team away like you would in pre-season, away from distractions, a chance to really train the group, enhance the team spirit with hopefully some good weather, so that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve made it from a purely footballing backdrop.\u201d\n\nHowe\u2019s side will play a friendly against Pro League champions Al-Hilal on December 8 during a trip he hopes will yield similar results to their last visit, after which they won five of their next six matches as they embarked upon a nine-game unbeaten run. \nHe said: \u201cWhen you look back to last year, our decision to go there and the benefit it had for the team and the results on our return were really good, so we got a few positive connotations from that. Going back to our trip last year, the weather was very good, the facilities were first class, we were able to spend some quality time together to bond the group and really focus our energies on our battle to stay in the division. The team spirit off the back of that trip was very, very good. Obviously we have that positive experience to fall back on and it\u2019s helped with our decision this time.\u201d\n\n\n\n 10.29am  \n\nLast night\u2019s match reports here, for anyone that missed anything:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 10.27am  \n\nIf you have any thoughts on Gerrard\u2019s dismissal by Villa \u2013 or anything else \u2013 you can get in touch with me by email, Twitter, or comment BTL.

                    "body": "The amateur club Westhoughton Lions could hardly be more different from the occasion Matty Peet will be faced with in Saturday\u2019s Challenge Cup final, but ask the Wigan Warriors coach about his unconventional route to the rugby league summit and he would almost certainly tell you both ends of his story are equally important.\nBarely six months after being unveiled as Wigan\u2019s new head coach, Peet is one win away from securing the Challenge Cup for rugby league\u2019s most famous club for a record-extending 20th occasion. While most head coaches fall into the role after a distinguished playing career, Peet\u2019s own time as a professional barely extended beyond a short stint as a reserves player with Leigh Centurions.\n\nHe called time on his playing career in his early 20s, instead heading to university before taking his first steps into coaching with Westhoughton\u2019s under-12s. Eventually securing a job helping coach Wigan\u2019s young players, Peet has subsequently taken on pretty much every coaching role at the club either side of a short stint in rugby union with Sale. He is far from your ordinary head coach, but he is a man the Warriors have earmarked for the top job for years.\n\u201cI remember I watched him do a training session once with the academy,\u201d Wigan\u2019s executive director, Kris Radlinski, says. \u201cHe just did things I had never seen before. After the session I went back and reported it to the chairman and said, \u2018There\u2019s something different in this lad\u2019. He is a thinker and he was doing things I\u2019d never seen.\u201d It was an appointment that caught many Wigan fans off-guard last year given his lack of experience, but not the Warriors.\nIn recent seasons Wigan have lacked any sort of attacking flair, or indeed success. Peet has set about changing those things and the impact has been immediate, with the Warriors now in Saturday\u2019s final against Huddersfield at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. His unique style has caught the eye of his players, too. \u201cHe\u2019s a brilliant listener and communicator, and pretty much unlike any other coach I\u2019ve had before,\u201d Wigan\u2019s long-serving England international Liam Farrell says.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a deep thinker, he knows so much about the game and you can tell he\u2019s dedicated his life to coaching. But the big thing for me is he knows every inch of this club, every member of staff, and as such he understands what the supporters expect from their team. Being from the area and a supporter of the club too, he just gets Wigan, which is important I think for a club like this where the standards are so high.\u201d\n\nPeet, understanding that Wigan supporters had grown weary of a more methodical, structured style of play, also set about making his side more attractive to watch. He brought in the former Great Britain half-back Lee Briers from Warrington to lead the attack, while also transitioning Wigan\u2019s legendary captain, Sean O\u2019Loughlin, into a post-playing role in charge of the defensive side of the Warriors.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure Matty delivers his message to the staff privately but in our meetings, he lets Briersy and Lockers take the lead, which is pretty unique,\u201d Farrell says. \u201cI\u2019m sure he has a big input in what they say but he\u2019s calm and trusts people. When he got the job, Matty got the senior players in and asked us what we needed to change and improve and how we could be better. He listened to us, and he\u2019s made sure our opinions were valued.\n\n\u201cTaking the job was a big learning curve for him and some people might have thought it was too early, but he\u2019s done a good job of proving everyone wrong so far.\u201d\nThe Wigan fullback Jai Field, perhaps Super League\u2019s standout player in 2022, has credited Peet\u2019s approach and style as a major reason in why he has been so good this year and it seems everywhere you turn, Peet\u2019s measured yet unique approach to coaching is earning him admirers.\n\u201cHe\u2019s very different in his approach,\u201d the Wigan prop Kaide Ellis says. \u201cHe\u2019s very psychological with his players but he\u2019s got a good balance. He doesn\u2019t get too technical, he\u2019s more on mindset and big on culture.\u201d Every fortnight, Wigan\u2019s players hold \u201cculture sessions\u201d, discussing life away from rugby. Peet is also keen for his players to be hands-on in the community, tightening the link between the club and the supporters.\n\nIt is certainly a different way to coach. But just months into a reign some felt would never amount to any success, Peet is one win away from his first trophy as a head coach. He said this year he would not consider himself a genuine Wigan coach until he delivered a trophy. You can be sure they will be watching in Westhoughton, where it all started nearly 20 years ago, to see if that vision becomes a reality."

                    "body": "Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s first game since his move to Saudi Arabia could see him facing Lionel Messi after his coach said the Portugal international would play against Paris Saint-Germain in a friendly this month. Ronaldo must serve a suspension before his league debut for Al Nassr but is expected to face PSG in a team made up of players from Al Nassr and Al Hilal in Riyadh on 19 January.  Ronaldo missed the first of two domestic games for Al Nassr on Friday after being suspended by England\u2019s Football Association for knocking a phone out of a fan\u2019s hand after Manchester United\u2019s defeat at Everton in April. Rudi Garcia, Al Nassr\u2019s manager, confirmed the 37-year-old forward would also miss the league game against Al Shabab and was poised to make his debut against Ettifaq on 22 January \u2013 but he expects Ronaldo to play against PSG. The game is also notable from a geopolitical perspective, with Saudi clubs facing a team owned by Qatar. \u201cIt [his debut] won\u2019t be with the Al Nassr jersey,\u201d Garcia was quoted as saying by L\u2019\u00c9quipe. \u201cIt will be a mix between Al Hilal and Al Nassr. As the coach of Al Nassr, I cannot be happy with this match. For development, to see PSG, to see the great Parisian players, indeed it is a good thing. But we have a championship game three days later. \u201cIn terms of scheduling, it could have been better thought out. But it\u2019s not a big deal \u2026 We are in the lead, we are happy. It is a difficult championship to win, but we intend to do it.\u201d Garcia said Ronaldo\u2019s arrival in Saudi Arabia was similar to Pel\u00e9\u2019s move to New York Cosmos, shining the spotlight on the little-known Saudi club who have amassed more than 10 million new Instagram followers since the player\u2019s signing. \u201cIn recent months, between Manchester United, the national team and also at a private level, he has not had easy moments,\u201d the manager said of Ronaldo. \u201cIf he finds the pleasure of playing again, it will be a good goal to achieve.\u201d"

                    "body": "Football loves its omens and portents. As Gareth Southgate prepares to send his limb-weary players out into the giant illuminated armadillo shell that is the Allianz Arena in Munich on Tuesday night there is perhaps some solace to be taken in the past.\nThe last time England lost in Hungary in a World Cup year, defeat in Budapest was followed by a joyful, unifying, era-forging World Cup final triumph under a dapper and mild-mannered head coach.\n\nAdmittedly, the surprise World Cup winners in question were West Germany in 1954. The glorious era that followed belonged to the powerhouse teams of Franz Beckenbauer and Lothar Matth\u00e4us. And the dapper and mild-mannered head coach, Sepp Herberger, turned out to have been a Nazi. But apart from that. Apart from that. Well, what exactly?\nIt is hard to know what to take from the current slew of deathly close-season England internationals, other than a generalised sense of unease. The defeat in Hungary was no surprise, an awkward, bruising game for a group of England players running on fumes and lactic acid. But it was also one of the worst performances of Southgate\u2019s time in charge, defined by all the things the current era has set its face against: staleness, mediocrity, a lack of special qualities.\nIt is that general sense of unease that seems to define this England team right now. In Munich England\u2019s travelling support has already become the pre-story, with fears of reprise of the kind of events \u2013 booing, rioting, booing children \u2013 Southgate seems to have to address every time he finds himself frowning in front of an advert board. Even the triumph of reaching a final last summer was transformed into a toxic event by the aftermath of defeat.\nA mangled schedule has hardly helped in the months since. England have played four competitive games against non\u2011filler opponents since the European Championship and won one of them. There is a fear now that defeat in Munich could just flush this a little further out into the light. Southgate\u2019s greatest gift as England manager has been tone, vibes, energy, clarity. He has above all been a Feelings Manager. Are we reaching a place now where that feeling starts to turn bad?\nIf so, it would be entirely undeserved. Even in the best of times there has always been a seam of anti-Gareth hostility, with the sense that this is based more in resenting his politics, his unashamedly preachy and stentorian moral leadership, with being annoyed that England players make a gesture against racism before each game. There is frustration too with the non\u2011cavalier manner in which England have learned to win; and with the fact Southgate isn\u2019t a lad or a chap or a bloke and instead has the manner of a popular and courtly provincial curate.\nBut the fact remains Southgate\u2019s record as England manager is peerless. Two semi-finals out of two after two in the previous half century. A better win ratio than any other England manager with more than 50 games. Likable teams, victorious penalty shootouts. There may be questions about the development of his team over five years, and about his grasp of fine tactical margins in the biggest matches. But as this team take a breath five months out from a winter World Cup, what Southgate deserves is a little faith.\nPerhaps the current run of injuries and absences may even strengthen his hand by flagging up the meagreness of England\u2019s resources in key areas. One of the great misperceptions of Southgate\u2019s time in charge, the stick most often used to beat him with, is the idea England have an unprecedented well of talent, an envy-of-the-world stock of players. The argument is that Southgate is simply a lucky manager, that he is in fact strangling the basic unstoppable England-power of our brave boys.\n\nThere are two issues with this. First, it isn\u2019t true. There are plenty of technical, orderly players coming through now. But remove the Anglo-tinted spectacles, peel away the glare of the Premier League\u2019s internationalist brilliance, and the idea of an excess of world-level English talent is simply solipsism.\nLook around Europe and there are plenty of other squads just as strong. England fielded five players in their starting XI against Hungary who played in last season\u2019s Champions League. Portugal started with nine in midweek, Spain eight. Germany started with 11 and used 14 in all, nine of whom have actually won club football\u2019s biggest trophy.\nMeanwhile England have had one player \u2013 Trent Alexander\u2011Arnold \u2013 in the Fifpro team of the year during Southgate\u2019s time in charge. England have no genuine back-up centre-forward. They have a left-back issue. They have Declan Rice, but no other A-listers in central midfield. Would Jordan Pickford, Conor Coady and Harry Maguire be starting for any other major nation?\nThis is not to denigrate these very successful Premier League players. But when an England team come burdened with the idea they might be underachieving by not actually winning tournaments, it is worth offering a little perspective.\n\nIndeed the notion of wasted talent tends to disguise some more interesting issues with Southgate\u2019s England. Criticism has focused on his use of a back three, which loads an additional defensive player into the team, but has also coincided with England\u2019s best results against the better teams.\nThis also feels like a chimera. Southgate is not an outstanding attacking coach capable of winning fine\u2011margin tournament games through creative attacking football. Very few people in the history of football have met that description. His skills are in organisation and control. To abandon this idea now, five months from a tournament, would be irrational. This is England: 2022. We\u2019re here to defend.\nFor all that, the one really obvious area of weakness is the lack of development in this team over five years. For all Southgate\u2019s success in communication, in allowing players to move through a lighter air with England, the team that goes to Qatar will basically be the same one that went to Russia. The spine will be Pickford, Maguire, John Stones, Harry Kane and Raheem Sterling, plus an energetic defensive midfield. The basic structure, three at the back, passing football, possession in cold areas, remains the same. A good idea is, it seems, a good idea for ever.\n\nTo some degree this is through circumstance. Covid stalled the preparations for the European Championship. The loss of a year between tournaments has pretty much flattened any idea of rebuilding this team before the World Cup. But right now it could be argued there is a whiff \u2013 just a spritz, a sniff of the fingertips \u2013 of Jogi L\u00f6w\u2019s Germany in this England set-up, that sense of a failure to build a second team.\nL\u00f6w\u2019s replacement, his former assistant Hansi Flick has made significant textural changes since last summer\u2019s defeat at Wembley, without ripping out the rump of his players. As England will find in Munich, Germany press high, attack with speed, and favour a bold, Klopp-style high line.\n\u201cWe want to put the opponent under pressure early on, we want to stress them,\u201d Flick has said. Leroy San\u00e9 is back. Joshua Kimmich is playing in the middle. Eight wins and no defeats have come in 10 games since last summer. There is a freshness here that Southgate hasn\u2019t been able to dredge out of a depleted squad at the end of a gruelling year. England\u2019s manager has promised to keep on experimenting on Tuesday night. Victory may be more useful."
