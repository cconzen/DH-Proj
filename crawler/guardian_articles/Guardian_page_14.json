                    "body": "Sarina Wiegman said England have taken \u201clots of information\u201d from their 3-1 victory against Germany \u2013 only their second in 27 attempts \u2013 and inaugural Arnold Clark Cup win but will not get carried away before the European Championship in the summer. \u201cThis was a step towards the Euros,\u201d the England manager said. \u201cWe will stay neutral. This was successful. We have grown a lot but we know the opponents in the Euros will be too. We weren\u2019t tight enough on the ball so that was hard for us but then you can come back to your fundamentals. I am happy with this tournament. We got lots of information about ourselves and where we are in our style of play.\u201d With draws against Canada and Spain, England topped the standings in the friendly tournament based on goal difference, after finishing level on five points with Spain. Ellen White scored the opening goal in front of 13,463 fans to join Sir Bobby Charlton on 49 goals for England and to move within four goals of Wayne Rooney\u2019s record.  Her effort was cancelled out by Lina Magull\u2019s powerful free-kick in the first half, but Millie Bright\u2019s poached strike on the rebound after a mazy run and shot from Lauren Hemp helped England towards three points and Fran Kirby added the flourish with a blistering goal on the counterattack in added time.  The sight of the defender Bright posing with a golden boot alongside the Ballon d\u2019Or, Fifa Best and Uefa player of the year winner, Alexia Putellas, after scoring her second goal of the tournament was a strange one. Wiegman had said it did not matter who was scoring for England, as long as the team were, but Bright\u2019s volley against Canada was their only goal of the tournament before this game. Against a depleted Germany, with 12 regular squad members unable to be called up because of injury or Covid, Alex Greenwood and Bright were partnered in defence, Chelsea\u2019s Jess Carter was shifted to left-back and Lucy Bronze was favoured, familiarly, on the right. Behind them, Manchester City\u2019s Ellie Roebuck was given the opportunity to attempt to win back her No 1 shirt, making her first start under Wiegman.  Almost instantly England\u2019s greatest threat, the fearless winger Hemp, went to work on the left, causing problems for the Bayern Munich defender Maximiliane Rall, but the breakthrough, 15 minutes in, came from a more tried and tested source. Georgia Stanway, operating as a No 10, neatly played in Kirby but her shot was intercepted by Jana Feldkamp who passed the ball straight back into the feet of the Chelsea forward. She sent White through the middle and the striker calmly slotted past Merle Frohms. It is impossible to write eight-time Euro winners off regardless of key absentees such as Alex Popp, Melanie Leupolz, Dzsenifer Marozs\u00e1n and Almuth Schult but it took a moment of brilliance to break through England\u2019s new steely backline. Magull\u2019s free-kick, courtesy of Greenwood\u2019s foul on Lea Sch\u00fcller just outside the box, was exactly that, smacking down off the underside of the bar and in. If there was any deflation at having conceded a second goal under Wiegman, there was consolation to be taken in the quality of the two strikes shipped in the past six days \u2013 a far cry from the scrappy and chaotic goals conceded before she arrived.  Changes were made at half-time in both of England\u2019s storm-swept Arnold Clark Cup games but here, in kinder climes, the Dutch manager did not ring the changes as readily \u2013 bar an enforced one in the 34th minute, with Rachel Daly coming on for the injured Carter. This tournament has very much been a chance for Wiegman and her staff to test partnerships, the versatility of players and formations, but this was the time to see how the closest first-choice starting XI available to her would cope in a competitive matchday scenario. With England struggling in the final third again, though, Stanway made way for the Arsenal winger Nikita Parris just past the hour mark, shifting Kirby more central. The impact was instant, with Parris injecting energy on the wing and the world-class Kirby far more effective stationed closer to White. Unwilling to be outdone by the Lionesses record goalscorer, in the 84th minute and with England in the ascendency, a sweeping run from Hemp ended with her shot deflecting off Feldkamp into the path of Bright who fired in to give England the lead.  \u201cWe wanted to get some extra energy in the game and score a goal. We needed an extra player up front, she\u2019s really strong, a good header of the ball and good with her feet. I know that\u2019s a risk, but it went our way,\u201d Wiegman said of Bright\u2019s presence up top late on. There was further cause for celebration when Kirby raced away, after a headed clearance from Bright, three minutes into six minutes of added time. Her shot squeezed past Frohms to confirm a first win against Germany on home soil and to maintain Wiegman\u2019s unbeaten record as England manager."

                    "body": "1) Forest take heart from defeat by old rivals\nLiverpool may have been under full strength but even in defeat it was a test emphatically passed by Steve Cooper\u2019s burgeoning Nottingham Forest side. The hosts displayed impressive defensive discipline and shape to keep Liverpool out for 78 minutes, and arguably should have had a penalty soon after conceding. They almost certainly would have been awarded a spot-kick had Ryan Yates altered his direction slightly and aimed to draw more significant contact from Alisson, the kind of trick pulled so often by Premier League forwards for the benefit of the video assistant referee. The VAR decision to rule Diogo Jota onside for the winner was also very tight. Forest caused J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s men problems and had the chances to win the match outright but a lack of ruthlessness with the opportunities they created left Cooper\u2019s side to ponder a couple of marginal decisions that could easily have gone the other way. As Joe Worrall said, Forest went \u201ctoe to toe with one of the best teams in the world\u201d. Plenty of positives to take from that. Luke McLaughlin\n\nMatch report: Nottingham Forest 0-1 Liverpool\n\n\n2) Virtuoso Eze makes it look easy\nEberechi Eze\u2019s fine first season at Crystal Palace was soundtracked by the fond, paternal shouts of Ray Lewington, who seemed in some games to be present purely for the purpose of in-game coaching Palace\u2019s left-sided attacker. Hopefully Lewington had a Sunday off to shout fondly at his television screen as Eze produced a fine, bold, effective display in the 4-0 FA Cup defeat of Everton. This was significant: Eze\u2019s second start against Premier League opponents since May 2021; an assertive showing after a season struggling with the aftershocks of an achilles injury; and more simply a reminder of what an excellent player he is, so easy on the ball, so progressive in his movement and passing. Palace have a core of high-grade attacking players. Eze against Everton was a reminder that he might just end up the best of that group. Mainly he is just a rare pleasure to watch. Barney Ronay\n\nMatch report: Crystal Palace 4-0 Everton\n\n3) Gerrard tells Saka to toughen up\nBukayo Saka made a point of telling the referee Robert Madley he needed more protection after feeling he had received rough treatment during Arsenal\u2019s win at Aston Villa, but he was given short shrift by Steven Gerrard when his concerns were fed through. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the game,\u201d Gerrard said. \u201cThe last time I checked, it wasn\u2019t a no-contact sport. I think tackles are allowed, physicality is allowed. He\u2019s a good player, an outstanding talent. I love him. But he can\u2019t complain about that side of it, that\u2019s football. I\u2019m sitting here now with screws in my hips. I\u2019ve had about 16 operations. I\u2019m struggling to go to the gym at the moment. That\u2019s all on the back of earning a living in English football. He\u2019ll learn and he\u2019ll learn quick.\u201d In fairness to Saka, he routinely gets up, dusts himself down and carries on; Gerrard was right that Villa had done little wrong, despite rancour over a fair tackle by Tyrone Mings, and the sense was that the England forward was expressing a longer-term frustration. Nick Ames\n\nMatch report: Aston Villa 0-1 Arsenal\n\n\n4) Wolves\u2019 flakiness alarms Lage\nWhatever madness ensued at Molineux, Wolves allowed themselves to wobble, self-destructing in the wake of Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez\u2019s controversial sending-off. It was a decision that stung Bruno Lage but more so his players. Wolves were chasing a third goal that would surely have put the game to bed but Leeds exposed their frailty to devastating effect and Lage was critical of his team\u2019s mentality, accusing his players of being too concerned about the injured Stuart Dallas; they wilted under pressure. Friday night was the first time they have conceded three goals this season. \u201cWe created a lot of chances to score more goals and this is how we need to grow up, we need to kill the game,\u201d said the Wolves head coach. \u201cIt happened against Manchester United at home [when they conceded a late winner in August] and it\u2019s happened again. These are the little things and we need to grow up as a team.\u201d Ben Fisher\n\nMatch report: Wolves 2-3 Leeds\n\n5) Boro lay down their top-tier credentials\nAt times it may have looked simple for Chelsea but Thomas Tuchel begged to disagree. According to the visiting manager, beating Middlesbrough 2-0 to reach the FA Cup semi finals took a \u201chuge effort\u201d from his players. It involved Tuchel adjusting his formation to 4-1-4-1 in order to combat Chris Wilder\u2019s clever pressing game and, as Boro\u2019s manager pointed out, the Championship side were never overrun by opponents who could afford to lose \u00a3900,000 a week under Roman Abramovich\u2019s outgoing ownership. If such losses explain why Chelsea\u2019s sale may not be that straightforward they also highlight the excellence of the job Wilder has done on an infinitely tighter budget since succeeding Neil Warnock in November. After beating Manchester United and Tottenham in earlier rounds Boro can now concentrate on securing a play-off place. They and Wilder would grace the Premier League. Louise Taylor\n\nMatch report: Middlesbrough 0-2 Chelsea\n\n\n6) Ipswich are going places in women\u2019s game\nTwo years ago, Manchester City Women scored 10 against Ipswich Town to reach the quarter-finals of the FA Cup. This season, in a 1-0 FA Cup quarter-final defeat to West Ham, a team that have already achieved their best-ever WSL points tally, Joe Sheehan\u2019s team showed how far they have come. \u201cWe\u2019re such a young squad,\u201d said Ipswich forward Natasha Jones. \u201cLooking back two years ago, we played Man City and they beat us 10-0. We just know we\u2019ve done that little bit better. Look at the scoreline: we\u2019ve played our hearts out, we\u2019ve given everything on the pitch, so we\u2019re really happy with that. It was a great atmosphere and great to be involved in that.\u201d Jones works 40 hours a week as a personal trainer. An impressive 10 players are on professional contracts and the club have some of the best talent in the country. With a top-level academy licence, the signs of progress keep coming. \u201cThey\u2019re in the middle of the WSL table and yes, there was a difference there, but we know we can keep on closing that gap.\u201d Suzanne Wrack\n\nMatch report: Ipswich 0-1 West Ham\n\n7) A dose of Women\u2019s FA Cup reality for battling Coventry\nCoventry United\u2019s fairytale journey from being within eight minutes of going into administration to reaching an FA Cup quarter-final was ended by four goals from the 14-time FA Cup winners Arsenal. The resilience of Jay Bradford\u2019s players was on show at Meadow Park as they held the Women\u2019s Champions League quarter-finalists at bay for 38 minutes before Stina Blackstenius opened the scoring. The gap between the WSL leaders and the Championship\u2019s bottom side is a big one, but a sturdy first half should give Coventry plenty of positives as they look to climb off the bottom after suffering a 10-point deduction for their financial difficulties at Christmas. The team have clawed back five points since then and sit nine points behind Watford \u2013 the team they face in the last game of the season. Suzanne Wrack\n\nMatch report: Arsenal 4-0 Coventry\n\n\n8) Bednarek\u2019s absence costs Southampton\nIt was a surprise to see Jan Bednarek omitted from the Southampton lineup for the FA Cup visit of Manchester City \u2013 and indeed the match-day squad. Had the first-choice centre-back picked up an injury? It turned out it was something else, as Ralph Hassenh\u00fcttl would explain after the 4-1 loss. \u201cBednarek has a big game for Poland next week and it seemed to me he is not 100% with his mind for us here today,\u201d the manager said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to take the risk that he doesn\u2019t make the last step to hurt himself.\u201d It is certainly a big game for Poland. Bednarek\u2019s team will face either Sweden or the Czech Republic on Tuesday week in a play-off for the World Cup finals. Hasenh\u00fcttl did not sound overly pleased with Bednarek and maybe it was because his replacement, Jack Stephens, had an uncomfortable afternoon, making errors, including a bad one for Raheem Sterling\u2019s opening goal. David Hytner\n\nMatch report: Southampton 1-4 Manchester City\n\n9) Rare end-of-season optimism at Leicester\nAfter the final international break of the season, Leicester could suddenly have so much competition for places that, with three games in hand on the teams in seventh and eighth place whom they trail by nine points, they could set themselves up for a barnstorming finish in the Premier League and continue chasing glory in Europe. With PSV Eindhoven to come in the quarter-final of the Europa Conference League and Jamie Vardy, Jonny Evans, Timothy Castagne and Wes Fofana all nearing full fitness \u2013 and none of the current top four left to play in the league \u2013 Leicester could benefit from the opposite sense of momentum that cost them in the past two seasons. Peter Lansley\n\nMatch report: Leicester 2-1 Brentford\n\n\n10) Moyes is right to manage West Ham expectations\n\u201cYou would never see West Ham being a top-four side,\u201d said David Moyes after his team\u2019s attempt at Champions League qualification suffered probably a terminal blow in Sunday\u2019s 3-1 loss against Spurs. \u201cI am a bit annoyed that I am getting asked it, but also I\u2019m quite pleased because it\u2019s telling me we were seen as a side that was getting seen for top four. It should be put as \u2013 how well have West Ham done to stay in the race until the last part of season.\u201d Defeatism or realism from Moyes? Surely it was the latter: he is correct that West Ham have been punching above their weight, and his attempt to manage expectation is entirely understandable. It was also predictable that there would be a hangover from Thursday\u2019s memorable Europa League win against Sevilla. Happily for the Hammers, they would get the best of both worlds if they can win the Europa League, booking themselves a place in next season\u2019s Champions League via a different route.

                    "body": "The federal government remains hopeful the commonwealth and states and territories can come up with a solution to quell swelling energy prices when they meet this week. Federal minister Bill Shorten said all options remained on the table, with the stakes being too high to not reach a decision on action. \u201cThis issue is too important not to leave the room without it,\u201d the Labor frontbencher told Sky News on Sunday. \u201cLet\u2019s see what emerges from discussions on Wednesday.\u201d National cabinet will meet this week ahead of finalising its plan for providing energy price relief, but the inclusion of coal has complicated matters, with Queensland and NSW being asked to cooperate with a plan that will temporarily cap the wholesale price of coal.  That presents a budgetary issue for the states. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has said he is confident the states will back the plan. The NSW treasurer, Matt Kean, told Sky News the Coalition-run state supported measures to lower prices. \u201cOur legal advice says they do have the power to cap coal prices if they do go down that path and we will support them,\u201d Kean said. \u201cThis is a national problem that requires a national solution.\u201d Queensland\u2019s Labor government was proving more skittish but had not ruled out support. Recalling parliament remains on the table to deal with any legislative measures that may be needed to implement the plan, which would include the states potentially having to recall their own parliaments. Kean said his government would support price caps implemented by the commonwealth.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  He said while he had spoken to the prime minister about implementing a coal price cap, no dollar figure was mentioned. The commonwealth and some state governments are in discussions over how a gas or coal price cap would be implemented. The federal government has raised concerns about potential legal consequences if it were to cap prices instead of states, but Kean said the commonwealth had the power to do so. He said he shared concerns that acting too late would mean the measures wouldn\u2019t bring down energy prices over the next 12 months. The NSW treasurer said a gas price cap would need to be considered alongside coal. He said a ceiling price for one would not be enough to bring down prices, with black coal setting the wholesale electricity price in NSW and Queensland more than half the time. While all options remain on the table, the federal government has been reluctant to spruik rebates, pointing to the inflationary pressure of handouts. Kean said the flow-on effect of increased energy prices being the biggest driver of inflation also needed to be considered. \u201cIf it\u2019s temporary and targeted to people who can least afford it, then it won\u2019t have the inflationary effect people are worried about,\u201d he said of the rebates.  Meanwhile, the minister for Indigenous Australians, Linda Burney, took a veiled swipe at those who wished to undermine progressing the Indigenous voice to parliament before consultation got under way. Burney used an interview on ABC Insiders to head off criticisms for a body that is yet to be finalised, saying she would not preempt what the body advising on the voice to parliament may recommend, ahead of consultation. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to get ahead of the working group,\u201d she said. Burney\u2019s comments came after the federal National party announced it would not be supporting the voice to parliament. Since its leader, David Littleproud, made the party room announcement, some Nationals MPs have said they remain behind the voice, while the Liberal party is yet to make a decision. Burney said by the time the matter came to a vote \u2013 which the government has said will be in the next 18 months, with the second half of next year shaping up as the preferred time \u2013 the details would be clear. \u201cWhen people go into that ballot box, to have their say on the referendum, they will be well informed and they will well understand the reason for the voice, as I said to improve the life outcomes for First Nations people, but also issues around how it will work and, importantly, what it will mean in uniting this country,\u201d she said."

Ukrainian officials have accused Moscow of forcibly deporting thousands of people from Mariupol to Russia, as Turkey says a peace deal between the two countries is close. In Australia, Peter Malinauskas is due to be sworn in as South Australia\u2019s new premier, and paramedics are set to take industrial action in New South Wales.\nForced civilian deportations from Mariupol to Russia are \u201cdisturbing\u201d and \u201cunconscionable\u201d if true, the United States has said, after Ukrainian officials accused Moscow of transporting thousands of people against their will out of the devastated port city. Though Turkey\u2019s foreign minister has claimed a peace deal between the two countries is \u201cclose\u201d, skepticism among western countries about Putin\u2019s intentions remains. Meanwhile, Germany has agreed a contract with Qatar for the supply of liquefied natural gas (LNG) that will help the European country wean itself off its dependency on Russian energy.\nIn Australia, the government has banned the sale of alumina and aluminium ores to Russia in response to what it described as \u201cunrelenting and illegal aggression\u201d towards Ukraine. On Sunday, the prime minister Scott Morrison announced Australia would donate coal and further military equipment to Ukraine to \u201csupport the brave and courageous resistance\u201d as part of a new aid package that also includes $30m in emergency humanitarian assistance.\nThe SA election result should have Morrison\u2019s Coalition \u201ctrembling\u201d ahead of the federal poll, Labor says, after Malinauskas became the first opposition leader to defeat an incumbent government since the start of the pandemic. The outgoing premier, Steven Marshall, announced on Sunday he would step down as Liberal leader after the landslide loss to Labor, saying he \u201ctakes full responsibility for the result\u201d and accepts \u201cthe will of the people\u201d. The prime minister sought to downplay what the resounding Labor win in SA could mean on a federal level, saying Anthony Albanese doesn\u2019t match up to his state colleagues.\nAustralia\n\nFifty-one asylum seekers who were brought to Australia for medical treatment continue to languish in detention in Australia, including 18 in the Park hotel in Melbourne, with no indication of when they might be released, according to a prominent refugee support group.\nSoaring commodity prices and a shrinking jobless rate will combine to slice almost $90bn from projected federal budget deficits out to 2024-25, although excessive pre-election promises would undermine the government\u2019s fiscal repair efforts, according to Chris Richardson, a senior economist at Deloitte.\nA toxic chemical released from tyres as they wear down on roads and implicated in mass deaths of salmon in the US has been found in an Australian waterway for the first time.\nTeachers at Brisbane religious school Citipointe Christian College are being asked to sign employment contracts that warn they could be sacked for being openly homosexual.\nThe world\n\nThe US is likely to see an increase in Covid cases like that in Europe and the UK thanks to the BA.2 virus subvariant but not a dangerous surge, Anthony Fauci said on Sunday.\nWorshippers at a mosque in Toronto subdued an allegedly axe-wielding man who police say attacked people with bear spray during a dawn prayer service.\nPolice investigating the death of Sabita Thanwani, 19, at a student flat in London over the weekend have arrested a man.\nMinisters in the UK are looking \u201csympathetically\u201d at plans to stop the government buying health goods made in China\u2019s Xinjiang province when the health and social care bill returns to the House of Commons later this month. The move would be a first sign that the UK government is willing to toughen its approach to authoritarian regimes in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine.\nRecommended reads\n\nA commitment to fly the Aboriginal flag permanently atop the Sydney Harbour Bridge was the pinnacle of relentless campaigning by Cheree Toka, a young Kamilaroi woman. \u201cI looked up as we were driving over the bridge and saw the Aboriginal flag wasn\u2019t there \u2013 just the NSW and Australian flags,\u201d Toka tells Guardian Australia. \u201cI remember getting riled and saying to my friends \u2018this country is so messed up sometimes\u2019.\u201d\nThere are so many things to learn and so much knowledge that seems to be embedded in your bones when caring for children. Some skills and approach to child-rearing comes from a visceral instinct and there are thousands of books and social media accounts that offer advice and doctrines about how to do it right. But there are a few things that Emily Mulligan wishes someone had told her. Here, she shares her hard-earned wisdom.\nOver four novels, the award-winning Australian author Steven Carroll has picked apart TS Eliot and his relationships with women \u2013 but felt moved to give the poet\u2019s first wife Vivienne a happier end.\nListen\nOn paper, the company does not exist: there is no company registration for the Wagner Group, no tax returns, no recruitment office. Officially, private military companies remain illegal in Russia.\nBut those who have followed the group\u2019s activities since its founding in 2014 \u2013 when it was used to support pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine \u2013 say that after successful incursions in Syria and several countries in Africa, it is now playing an important role in Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.\nPjotr Sauer has reported on the Wagner Group for the Guardian and he recently interviewed Marat Gabidullin, a former mercenary who joined the group in 2015.

                    "body": "Jordan Henderson would have preferred to see the Football Association move Liverpool\u2019s FA Cup semi-final against Manchester City to a neutral venue nearer the north-west rather than stage it at Wembley next month.\nLiverpool\u2019s captain was dismayed to learn that the tie, to be played on Easter Saturday, takes place on a day when engineering works dictate there are no direct trains from the region to London. Since then the FA has announced it will charter a free return bus service from Anfield and the Etihad Stadium to Wembley for up to 5,000 fans from each club but Henderson remains unconvinced.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing for the fans \u2013 I think this time it should be a bit more about them,\u201d he said, exhibiting an awareness of the inconvenience and, in many cases, high cost of travelling to Wembley from Merseyside and Manchester. \u201cIt\u2019s their day and for different reasons, costs included, it would make sense to change it to a neutral venue nearer the north-west.\n\u201cThat\u2019s just my view. I\u2019m sure there are complications the FA would have to overcome in moving it. But I\u2019m looking at it from the fans\u2019 viewpoint, which is probably the most important thing to me. I\u2019ve learnt over the past couple of years of the pandemic how important the fans are to football so it\u2019s really disappointing to see that it will be very expensive for many of them to get down there.\u201d\nHenderson also believes domestic use of the national stadium should be restricted to finals.\u201cI love playing at Wembley, I think it\u2019s a fantastic stadium, but for me personally I would like to keep it for finals,\u201d he said. \u201cI think how it used to be, semi-finals at neutral grounds was quite exciting. Then to keep the final at Wembley made it extra special.\u201d\n\nAlthough his pleas fell on deaf ears, the FA is providing 100 buses for each club and liaising with National Highways to try to ensure that hundreds of miles of unessential roadworks are placed on hold over the East weekend, smoothing fans\u2019 road journeys.\nAfter Liverpool v City kicks off at 3.30pm on Saturday 16 April, Chelsea face Crystal Palace on Sunday 17 at 4.30pm.\nOn 16 April, at 12.15pm, City will play at West Ham in the semi-finals of the Women\u2019s FA Cup and the FA is providing free buses for City fans too. The following day Chelsea\u2019s women visit Arsenal at 12.30pm."

                    "body": "My Covid-postponed standup tour continues. Another Thursday morning; another hotel room; another opportunity to purloin branded shower caps and shoe-mitts that I will never use, yet which signify an indefinable victory over normal life, from which I appear to have fatally exempted my nomadic self. My stolen mini shampoo bottle supply will outlast my hair. Is this a win? Is anyone impressed? Once more, I have the privilege of wrenching another thousand words out of another week of the same unchanging Tory lies and incompetence. It\u2019s like Groundhog Day, Boris Johnson a fat, ceremonial rodent driven only by instinct, cunning and desire. Turds emerges each week from the prime minister\u2019s questions burrow, blinking in the bright light of cold, hard facts, his corruption and dishonesty apparently unaccountable as the faithful cheer and the unconvinced stare on in nauseated disbelief. Ever get the feeling you\u2019ve been cheated? But somebody at central office sensed that, on some level, it might be expedient for the damaged Turds to put some distance between himself and last week\u2019s bad news. As the already Covid-crushed and Brexit-battered British public face the biggest economic hit since rationing, Rishi Sunak remains a non-corporeal digital duct for artfully airbrushed disappointments. The chancellor exists in a glossy slipstream of cynically staged publicity photos that place him at the exact centre of an imagined middle England of inconspicuous consumption and shared Sainsbury\u2019s values. Sunak is one shutter-snap short of being posed on a Ricky Gervais\u2019s commemorative After Life park bench, secretly snaffling an entire Colin the Caterpillar while wondering if the National Trust is now \u201ca bit too woke\u201d, the ultimate embodiment of our current collective shared national values. On Wednesday, having cut a meaningless 5p from fuel duty, Sunak was systematically positioned and photographed \u2013 the poseable, single-mum-starving Ken Doll of the Downing Street Instagram account \u2013 by a government propagandist at a New Cross petrol station. Sunak fills up his calculatedly inoffensive Kia car (which, it later emerged, isn\u2019t his car at all), making small talk with another motorist, shirt sleeves rolled up, artisanal wristbands offsetting sharp trousers, a Sainsbury\u2019s storefront visible behind him, bland to the point where his uncomprehending and ignorant cruelty is almost invisible, as if smothered by a wall of ready-framed prints of Lake District jetties and umbrella-twirling lovers that his own home would never play host to.  On Wednesday lunchtime in parliament, Sunak balanced his \u00a3180 \u201csmart\u201d coffee mug on the halo of flies surrounding Priti Patel\u2019s head, swallowed down his integrity and his empathy and announced that leaving the EU meant he was able to abolish VAT on insulating materials. I smelled a rat, unsurprisingly, as we are never more than six feet away from one and rats really stink. But nonetheless, I thought, \u201cI bet it\u2019s more complicated than that\u201d. And, of course, a swift Google revealed that EU finance ministers had already announced an EU-wide exemption on VAT for green products on 8 December last year. Similarly, the myth that the vaccine was only developed because we left the EU persists, sustained by Turds\u2019s ability to cite it in answer to any difficult question. \u201cDid you attend the bacchanalian revels of a KGB agent\u2019s son, whom you later ennobled, having given your Foreign Office handlers the slip?\u201d \u201cThe vaccine rollout was only possible because we left the EU.\u201d Repeat to fade. Sunak says the incoming economic crisis is the fault of a global conflict it actually predates, suggesting a mismanagement of the national purse so acute it has actually destroyed the laws of physics and enabled debts to travel back through time, like the Avengers in Endgame. Of course, the acknowledged long-term hit to GDP from Brexit, identified by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility, doesn\u2019t get a look in, despite Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s promises of cheaper food and cheaper footwear. Stamp on a pigeon in a \u00a35 pair of slip-on shoes and maybe you\u2019ll have something nice to spit-roast for your dinner! If you can\u2019t afford the gas required to bake a potato, you can at least roast your flying vermin over some burning pallets. David Davies\u2019s once-ridiculed post-Brexit Mad Max dystopia is here ahead of schedule! And while the rest of us, doing the right thing by Ukraine, will feel the hit to our pockets from sanctions and shortages, the Indian tech company Sunak\u2019s wife has a \u00a3430m stake in continues to operate in Moscow, despite his government\u2019s calls for disinvestment. The wealth that sustains Sunak\u2019s own \u00a3180 smart mug supply is in no immediate danger, no matter how long the war in the east continues. Sunak\u2019s smart heated travel mug allows him to set an exact drinking temperature for up to three hours, so his coffee is never too hot or too cold. It is always just right. Why does anyone even bother fact-checking anything the Brexit government say about the benefits of Brexit? Just save time by assuming everything Johnson and his henchmen say is lies and get on with your day. The rest of the world already has. Ukraine\u2019s clearly exasperated former president Petro Poroshenko stands in combat fatigues in a bombed-out city and asks Johnson not to compare Brexit to his country\u2019s fight against Russia, as if explaining the world to a stupid lying child. Once I have filed this column, I will walk in to Nottingham town for my daily exercise. In Brian Clough Square, just along from the lace museum and the newly minted statue of Sleaford Mods, there is a 100 foot-high mural of local hero Robin Hood, tossing requisitioned rich man\u2019s gold to a waiting crowd of starving peasants, a foundation myth of our nation that speaks, I think, to an enduring sense of fair play. But who is that in the background, glimpsed through the greenwood, filling up his Kia car while supping perfectly warmed coffee from his \u00a3180 smart mug and calculating those Russian dividends? Can it be the Sheriff of Nottingham? \u2022 Rescheduled national 2022 dates of Stewart\u2019s 2020 tour, Snowflake Tornado, are on sale now; as are Edinburgh fringe shows, here and here"

                    "body": "There\u2019s an ancient cousin of the eucalypts, Stockwellia quadrifida, found only on Queensland\u2019s highest mountain, Bartle Frere. Podocarpus dispermus, a Gondwanan conifer whose bright red berries are spread by cassowaries and musky rat-kangaroos. And Ficus crassipes, a banana fig that starts life as a seedling in the rainforest canopy then sends its roots cascading to the ground. They\u2019re among 500 mature trees at far north Queensland\u2019s Atherton Arboretum, a CSIRO-owned haven to rare species from the nearby wet tropics, Cape York, the Gulf of Carpentaria and the Northern Territory. The 3.64-hectare tree garden was established in 1971 by the biologists Geoff Stocker, Bernie Hyland and Tony Irvine and became an important part of the Australian National Herbarium.  Being able to see, touch and smell specimens of rare and endemic trees from remote and rugged locations has helped generations of naturalists and been an invaluable resource for research. CSIRO closed public access to the site in October last year, alarming an Atherton-based botanist, Gemma Horner, who thought it was important the community knew what was going on behind closed doors. It wasn\u2019t until last month she heard that the national scientific agency was planning to sell the land. CSIRO has confirmed the site has been \u201cvacated in preparation for divestment\u201d, and Guardian Australia understands that as a freehold site there would be no restrictions on its sale. This has prompted Horner to fear it may be sold to a private developer and cleared for residential housing. \u201cAs members of the local community, we should be concerned about conserving this site for both present and future generations,\u201d she says.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  \u201cThe removal of the arboretum would be a great loss to the region, not only of 50 years of research, education and effort in establishing a diverse variety of tropical species by some of the region\u2019s esteemed botanists and scientists, but also the loss of a part of Australia\u2019s tropical rainforest research history.\u201d  Horner says the arboretum could potentially qualify for protection under the Queensland heritage register \u2013 but it cannot be registered while under commonwealth ownership. Rebel Warren, a former CSIRO technician who worked at the site for two decades before being made redundant, is also calling for the arboretum to be preserved.  \u201cI think that\u2019s the general consensus of the people in this area,\u201d she says. \u201cThey [do] not want to lose that site. And there\u2019s the historical value of the work that was done there. It was an important institution for this town.\u201d A CSIRO spokesperson said: \u201cCSIRO\u2019s Atherton site is not on the market and we are not inviting expressions of interest for sale. The site remains part of our property portfolio, although the site has now been vacated in preparation for divestment.\u201d The agency was liaising with government departments in seeking the required approvals to put the site on the market, the spokesperson said.   Last year the local state MP, Shane Knuth, raised concern in parliament about the loss of the site. His office said last week that it had been informed by the office of the federal MP, Bob Katter, that an initial deal between the federal and state governments had fallen through.  Knuth says the site should be handed to the Tablelands community to preserve and maintain the collection. \u201cThis site holds an environmental and historical significance that, I believe, needs to be preserved for generations to come,\u201d he says. Tablelands Regional Council has also advocated for the protection of the arboretum.  \u201cWe\u2019re aware discussions are taking place about the site\u2019s future and remain positive that any potential sale will preserve the arboretum given its importance to our local history and scientific identity,\u201d a spokesperson said. Warren agrees that the site should be given to the community: \u201cIt can be turned into a beautiful botanical garden without very much work, because the trees are already tagged with their species names. \u201cThen you could set up a little museum of the history of forestry in the area, and the history of CSIRO and the projects that were done on the Tablelands. You could even put in a coffee shop that sells some souvenirs and a cup of coffee and cake.\u201d"

                    "body": "There is a bias all journalists share. It is baked into the profession, inseparable from craft skills, such as news sense. It is not ideological or party political. Rather, it skews the judgment towards whatever interpretation of the evidence makes for the best, most exciting story. This, surely, is one of the reasons that so much of the media reporting of the Victorian election campaign was off the mark \u2013 particularly in the last week, when multiple outlets were predicting a late swing to the Coalition and against Labor. Now the results are in, and while there has been a slight shuffle in the deck of Victoria\u2019s electorates, the main message is that Victoria has not changed much since 2018, when Labor won a landslide victory and the Liberal party was humiliated.  That\u2019s despite the trauma of lockdowns, the government involvement in several Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission inquiries and the rising levels of debt. But \u201cnothing changes\u201d does not a headline make. So, while there was a lot of good reporting during the election \u2013 important investigative stories, close grained seat by seat reporting and courageous experiments such as The Age\u2019s citizens agenda \u2013 we also saw considerable coverage that was simply wrong, and oddly disassociated from what reporters on the ground were hearing and seeing. The media were not the only ones to blame. The Liberal party, too, ran a campaign that rested on false assumptions, although the facts were reasonably clear.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  The first is the myth of premier Daniel Andrews\u2019 unpopularity \u2013 despite the fact that he has had consistently high popularity ratings. One of the main messages coming from the Liberals was that voting for them was the only way to get rid of him. Yet the evidence and the public opinion polls have consistently suggested that Andrews has in fact united the majority of Victorians, not only through the traumas of the Covid pandemic but also in support of his ambitious infrastructure projects, and their remodelling of Australia\u2019s fastest growing city. You wouldn\u2019t want to overstate his unifying effect, given the primary vote was down \u2013 37.1% compared to 42.9% in 2018 \u2013 but the lost votes went not to the Liberal party but to independents and minor parties. The preferences returned to Labor. This was hardly a vote for change. True, Labor suffered big swings in the outer suburbs \u2013 a reflection, I suspect, of anger about lack of services and general neglect rather than as many in the media suggested, anger over pandemic management. We saw the same factors at play in the country, where the National party retained its seats and won back others from independents who were seen as too close to the government. But as for \u201ctoxic Dan\u201d as one headline put it, who was supposedly a drag on the Labor vote, the polls have never showed that he was on the nose, nor that voters were waiting for him with that culturally bereft cliche of political reporting, the baseball bat. And yet much of the media and political class had trouble believing that it was so. Once a narrative takes hold, it is hard to shift. So in what way is Victoria different? What are we missing, and what is the Liberal party apparently missing? We can look to history and in particular the last three elections for evidence. Victorians largely support immigration and reject the politics of race, which Matthew Guy tried to use so disastrously in 2018 with his African gangs law and order campaign. Second, more than in other states, Victorians expect their governments to be active, to step up to solve social problems. Henry Bolte and Jeff Kennett were active Liberal premiers. Daniel Andrews is an activist from Labor. So Victorians largely like the idea of the Suburban Rail Loop. Polls have consistently shown this to be the case. Melburnians have largely signed on to the Andrews view that the value it will deliver will put the bean counters and the naysayers on the wrong side of history. The debt it racks up is good debt, he says, because it is an investment. Victorians mostly adopt the idea of the social contract. They are more likely to believe in collective effort. During the Covid lockdowns, in his daily media conference the premier spoke largely over the heads of hectoring reporters and made a deal with the public. Tolerate restrictions until most of us are vaccinated, and then different approaches will be taken. He has stuck to that deal \u2013 arguably too rigidly, given he has continued to wind back public health measures even as Covid continues to kill and injure. But it has added to his image as someone who gets things done, and does what he says he will do. The surveys tell us that Victorians are concerned about political integrity. So why didn\u2019t the Ibac investigations count against Andrews? Perhaps the voters saw a distinction, which the media has largely failed to draw, between being questioned by Ibac and being directly implicated in allegations of corruption. Or perhaps they just believe that the Liberal party is no better. So this is the state of Victoria \u2013 wellspring of Australia\u2019s two main political parties, yet increasingly misunderstood by one of them, and sections of the media.  At least since John Howard was prime minister, the Liberal party has drifted away from its Victorian small-l liberal roots and towards New South Wales, and the right. That means Labor has become the natural party of government in Victoria \u2013 in office for three-quarters of the last four decades. I have painted a pretty picture for progressives, but there are dangers in all this. Any long-term government becomes encrusted with networks of influence and cronyism. It is hard for a successful government to continually refresh itself. Andrews is a powerful, hard-headed leader who runs a centralised and controlling style of government. Increasingly, we can expect the pathologies of the Labor party to be writ large on the culture of the state. Given the state of the Liberal party, another Labor win in 2026 seems more than likely \u2013 whether or not Andrews is still leader. If that happens, by 2030 most Victorians under the age of 40 won\u2019t have much memory of any other colour of government. Power relationships and networks of influence will have hardened. The arteries will grow sclerotic. For this reason, we have to hope that the Liberal party is able to reconnect with liberalism. Government is improved when oppositions are strong \u2013 when they present real alternative governments, including a narrative and a vision, rather than a grab bag of promises. This time around the Liberal campaign was better than in 2018. It neutralised climate change as an issue by committing to real action \u2013 and thus held off further defeats by teal candidates. But it devised no compelling narrative of what kind of government it would be, given the chance. Instead, the main messages were disconnected from the audience. Victoria needs political parties \u2013 and a media \u2013 that speaks to its best instincts. Otherwise, in a decade\u2019s time, we might not be living in such a pretty place after all.

                    "body": "Has Ofwat woken from its slumbers? There are encouraging signs. On the troubled issue of sewage \u2013 specifically, the vast quantities of the stuff pumped into rivers \u2013 the water regulator in England and Wales is suddenly talking as if it means business. \u201cFrom what we have seen so far, the scale of the issue here is shocking,\u201d said David Black, chief executive, in unusually strong language as he added South West Water, owned by quoted group Pennon, to the list of firms targeted with enforcement cases connected to the management of treatment works. There is a question of whether Ofwat has a right to be shocked. It has regulated the sector since privatisation 30 years ago, so should have uncovered the industry\u2019s dirty secrets by now. But the joint investigation with the Environment Agency (EA) into potentially illegal spills at treatment works, launched last November, is shaping up \u2013 possibly \u2013 as a major event. The stench of a scandal grows with every update. South West joins Anglian, Northumbrian, Thames, Wessex and Yorkshire on the regulator\u2019s list for specific targeting. So more than half the sector is now in a process that can lead to fines of up to 10% of turnover. The City is starting to take it seriously. Analysts at Jefferies, who recently hosted the chief executive of campaign group Surfers Against Sewage to address fund managers on the grim technicalities of waste dumping, have been warning for a while about \u201cincreasing regulatory risks for UK water\u201d. They called Ofwat\u2019s Pennon move \u201ca strongly toned update that signals to us that further scrutiny and regulation is to come\u201d. About time too. Data from the EA revealed an astonishing 2.7m hours of spills in England in 2021. Only 14% of English rivers are deemed to be of good ecological standard, a grotesque statistic. Sewage isn\u2019t the only cause of poor river health, it should be said, but the gamechanging development for the water companies may be better monitoring equipment. One suspicion is that companies have been interpreting previously ambiguous data in their favour. Another is that claimed capacities at treatment works have not been maintained, leading to excess discharges. Both touch on basic licence conditions. If evidence of breaches is found, the authorities would be virtually obliged to get heavy. Despite the regulators\u2019 deserved reputation for timidity, there is a precedent. Southern Water was ordered by Ofwat to pay \u00a3126m to customers in 2019 for enormous spills plus deliberate misreporting of data, and a \u00a390m fine followed in 2020 in a criminal case brought by the EA. The sums represented a rare instance of when owning a water company is not a one-way bet in which the customers pay via their bills. The owners of privately held Southern promptly sold it. Customers should still brace to fund future upgrades of the network that are plainly needed to meet tougher storm overflow requirements. Jefferies put the cost at \u00a323bn-\u00a380bn, implying \u00a369-\u00a3140 a year on average household bills. But the backward-looking focus of the Ofwat/EA investigation is the first event. It is vital that both bodies hold the line against inevitable corporate lobbying. This is a last chance to restore regulatory credibility on a problem that should have been tackled a couple of decades ago.  Heathrow owners can cope with reduced fees John Holland-Kaye, chief executive of Heathrow, is promising passengers a \u201cworse experience\u201d (yes, even worse) now that the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has said it will progressively lower landing charges from \u00a330.19 per passenger to \u00a326.31 by 2026. He, and Heathrow\u2019s owners, should stop grumbling. The \u00a330.19 was an interim measure while the CAA waited to see how quickly passengers returned. Demand is coming back far faster than expected, so a better baseline for comparison is the pre-pandemic \u00a322 charge. Meanwhile, the owners \u2013 led by Spanish group Ferrovial and the Qatar Investment Authority \u2013 should reflect that they got through Covid without injecting extra equity in Heathrow and still own an asset with an investment-grade debt rating. They\u2019ll cope. There is a final round of argy-bargy to come, but the CAA has probably got its sums about right.  Walgreens missed its moment to sell Boots The auction for the Boots the chemist never rose above lukewarm, and now it\u2019s off. Walgreens has yanked the sale, blaming an \u201cunexpected and dramatic change\u201d in financial markets. Boots, it has to be said, was not a prize asset \u2013 the chain has looked tired and under-invested for ages \u2013 but, on this occasion, the official explanation for a non-sale looks correct. Leveraged deals are deeply out of favour, say deal-makers everywhere, while the outlook on inflation and interest rates is so unclear. Walgreens missed its moment by about six months."

                    "body": "CHEERIO AND GOODBYE Norn Iron went two goals down within 20 minutes against Kosovo yesterday, and, well, they weren\u2019t going to turn that around, were they. This latest fiasco led to the 500-strong travelling Green and White Army chanting \u201ccheerio\u201d at manager Ian Baraclough, who has won just three of 19 competitive games in charge. \u201cLet\u2019s not be negative,\u201d retorted Baraclough, who went on to make the claim that Paddy McNair, injured on the morning of the match, would have made some sort of difference, before adding gnomically: \u201cI understand the fans\u2019 frustration but there are ways to losing a game of football and that\u2019s it.\u201d No, we\u2019re none the wiser either, and we\u2019ve even held it up to the light and looked at it from various angles. Norn Iron have now played 13 Nations League matches and won a grand total of none of them, with ten defeats. If nothing else, they\u2019re taking a brave and principled stance of Irish unity, with the Republic\u2019s record in Uefa\u2019s fledgling waste of time just as bad: no wins in 12 for Stephen Kenny\u2019s confused rabble. But in and of itself, Norn Iron\u2019s record isn\u2019t great, and having gone into group K22 (subs, please check) as top seeds (this surely can\u2019t be right either), they find themselves eight points off the pace set by Greece, and five shy of the second-placed Kosovans. Victory at Windsor Park over Cyprus on Sunday is now essential, though while Baraclough still believes the home crowd will be \u201call in behind the team, not a problem\u201d, what can anyone realistically expect when you\u2019re going into battle without Middlesbrough\u2019s defensive linchpin? Get well soon, Paddy.  But while Norn Iron\u2019s current plight is something of a downer, it at least illustrates, by way of sheer contrast, how great the achievements of Billy Bingham were in the 1980s. Snapping everything into perspective, it was announced this morning that the brilliant Bingham has passed away at the grand old age of 90. He lived a life less ordinary, playing for Norn Iron at the 1958 World Cup and Luton in the 1959 FA Cup final, winning the league with Everton in 1963, and leading Linfield to a quadruple in 1971 before moving on to manage Greece, Everton, PAOK, Mansfield Town and Saudi side Al-Nassr. It\u2019s his time in charge of Norn Iron that\u2019s really seared on the memory, though. Bingham led his country to the 1982 and 1986 World Cups, the high point being that Gerry Armstrong-inspired defeat of Spain at their own finals (although there\u2019s a strange sort of dignity in conceding a worldie to Josimar as well). All the while with a pipe on. A master tactician and a gentlemen, here\u2019s hoping he has a quick glance down at Windsor on Sunday to inspire his countrymen one last time.

The reward for doing a good job is to get a longer contract. Yet the reward for being rubbish is to get sacked with an immediate payout on your remaining contract. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho has apparently had over \u00a390m in payouts from Man Utd, Chelsea (twice for goodness sake!), Spurs and Real Madrid.

The last remaining tickets to live shows in June and July are available here.  NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Uefa has defended the decision of its two most senior executives to leave Paris early a day after the Stade de France chaos to watch the Championship playoff final at Wembley. The Derby takeover has met with another delay. Chris Kirchner, the latest prospective buyer, has been given until Friday afternoon to prove he is in a position to finalise a deal. The EFL are \u201cincredibly disappointed\u201d, apparently. Still, at least there\u2019s another saviour waiting in the wings in the form of \u2026 Mike Ashley. Ah, well, disaster averted in that case. The Premier League transfer window is officially open, its swirling vortex sucking unsuspecting souls into a nightmarish parallel dimension of exit doors, war chests and come-and-get-me pleas. The latest is that Aston Villa, Leeds and Tottenham are all after Sonny Perkins, with West Ham reluctant to meet the youngster\u2019s wage demands, while Arsenal have won the race for Marquinhos. Chelsea have completed the signing of Kadeisha Buchanan from Lyon. She\u2019s won Women\u2019s Big Cup and Division 1 F\u00e9minine five times each, so it\u2019s fair to say Emma Hayes has done some good business there.

It follows a repeating pattern: silence for 67 days, then several rapid spurts of excitement before another bout of nothingness. One theory is that the radio waves indicate the presence of a dwarf galaxy three billion light years away; another is that they are simply reflecting the recent pattern of play from a more familiar celestial body, Cristiano Ronaldo. The Fiver doesn\u2019t know what to think. That\u2019s OK, we have Tin. Anyway, it\u2019s not up to us to figure out how long the 37-year-old\u2019s bursts of activity can last these days and whether, following Saturday\u2019s otherworldly hat-trick against the Harry Has-Been Team, he should be deployed from the start in Tuesday\u2019s Big Cup showdown with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. That\u2019s a decision for Ralf Rangnick. The Fiver doesn\u2019t know what to think about Rangnick. That\u2019s OK, we have Tin. What we can say for sure is that the German has already pulled off one brilliant feat at Old Trafford by negotiating a deal whereby if he does a good job as interim manager, he could become the full-time manager \u2013 and if he does a bad job as manager, he could become the full-time manager\u2019s boss. That\u2019s some top, top politics!  In fairness to Rangnick, he has only lost three of 19 matches in charge and there have been no humiliations quite like the ones endured by his predecessors, such as the 4-1 slippering by Watford or the 6-1 whipping by Spurs. And the first leg of the tie with Atl\u00e9tico yielded one of United\u2019s best results under him, a 1-1 draw that leaves the contest right in the balance. So maybe he really could oversee an unlikely triumph, even if the deal he wangled is one of the reasons why it wouldn\u2019t be right to class him alongside Tony Barton or Roberto Di Matteo. Or maybe, given how well this side tends to cope when the pressure is on, that epochal humiliation is coming real soon. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE!

It was Duncan McKenzie who teased the Everton boss, not Malcolm Macdonald. Or so Duncan told me when I interviewed him for the NME in the late-70s, after he\u2019d left Goodison for Blackeye Rovers. He was a funny lad, and evidently still amused by Mr Lee\u2019s team talks\u201d \u2013 Monty Smith (and others). \u201cHaving not seen Mr Roy\u2019s new eyewear, I dutifully clicked on the link to the Watford Observer article (yesterday\u2019s Fiver) where my eye was immediately caught by the avatar of senior sport reporter Ryan Gray sporting an England football top. It immediately occurred to me that Big Website\u2019s roster of top journalism talent should do the same to demonstrate their commitment to and undying love for their chosen sport. I look forward to the day when Fiver writers showcase their finely-honed physiques in tight-fitting, overpriced club merchandise\u201d \u2013 Andrew Parker. \u201cI\u2019m sure Mr Roy would appreciate the literary allusion of him being the second coming of WB Yeats (yesterday\u2019s Fiver).

                    "body": "In 2016 Bayern Munich faced a very difficult task. The club had to find a successor for Pep Guardiola. Only one came into consideration: Carlo Ancelotti. For us players this meant a change on the one hand. What Ancelotti said in one week, Guardiola said in three hours. On the other hand, as was the case for his predecessor, it was also true for Ancelotti: as a player you feel comfortable because you sense that the coach is ready to make his methods available to the team. That is why he is successful everywhere. In a poll on who is the best coach in the world very few would say Carlo Ancelotti, even in Italy. Yet he has a unique record. He is the only one who will soon be title winner in Europe\u2019s five big leagues: with Milan in Serie A, Chelsea in the Premier League, Paris Saint\u2011Germain in Ligue 1 and Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga, while with Real Madrid he is on the verge of winning La Liga.  There is also no coach who has won the Champions League more often, three times, or with more clubs, two. Ancelotti is also one of seven men to have held this trophy aloft as a player and as a coach. As a player he prevailed because he possessed extraordinary strategic skills. Ancelotti was part of the legendary Milan team under Arrigo Sacchi, who taught concept football to great individual players. So Ancelotti was on the pitch when a revolution was taking place, when the operating system of the modern game against the ball was being programmed: the ball-oriented zonal marking, the blueprint of which is still current. This experience is the prerequisite for a top coach. Any coach who has not played at the highest level is missing something that Ancelotti has experienced. And so his deep understanding of the game, the players, the milieu of professional football comes from within. A dogmatic coach he is not. All his teams have a tactical level, he thinks from the defensive. But as a player, you get your freedom. Ancelotti is best at managing extreme characters.  Ancelotti has also got on with powerful men like Silvio Berlusconi, Roman Abramovich, Florentino P\u00e9rez or Nasser al-Khelaifi. After a few weeks in Munich he approached me and asked who had more to say, Uli Hoeness or Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. It was important for him to know who was giving the thumbs up or thumbs down within the club. At the time when he was coaching us it sometimes looked chaotic in the dressing room. Basically, kids\u2019 stuff. Ancelotti was supposed to provide discipline. He was given a list of five points that we players should pay attention to in future. After training, he took me aside, showed me the list and said: \u201cNow they\u2019re grabbing me by the balls.\u201d Then Ancelotti stood in the dressing room in front of the team, looked at a piece of paper and said: \u201cI have an order from the board to read you a list.\u201d What he said, his tone, the way he looked, expressed:\u2018This is not part of my job, I\u2019m not coaching a youth team after all. But if the bosses want me to do it, I\u2019ll do it.\u2019 Some players countered that signing thousands of autograph cards a month was too much for them. Ancelotti said: \u201cIt would be the same for me.\u201d  Ancelotti is independent. He has charm, humour and a certain nonchalance. He manages to keep his distance. He would often sit in a restaurant with his family for an hour and a half after the final whistle and eat tortellini. Growing up as the son of farmers in Reggiolo in northern Italy, Ancelotti was used to helping out on the farm as a youngster. He embodies what is possible in football. You can come from the bottom to the top and shine on a big stage. Yet he never takes himself too seriously. Those who now ask how one can be successful in five countries with five languages need to know: Footballers do a lot of things non-verbally. And Ancelotti has mastered the 50 important words needed in this game in every language. Top\u2011class football is international. Real, PSG, Chelsea, Bayern and Milan differ in style only in nuances. Ancelotti is the ideal solution for quietly taking over such teams. In Madrid, he surely loves the exuberant universal talent of Karim Benzema, the game intelligence of Luka Modric, the precision of Toni Kroos\u2019s passes. Benzema\u2019s missteps, on the other hand, interest him less, and he no longer wants to teach Kroos how to defend. As Real\u2019s coach, he is aware that a debacle can happen, like the 4-0 defeat against Barcelona. Genius is simply not available in every game. Ancelotti knows that and the players know that he knows it. They support each other because he is one of them.  He does not lose his nerve after defeats but stands in front of his players. Team and coach are one unit, that is a merit of Ancelotti. The 3-1 victories against PSG and at Chelsea proved that Real Madrid can win not only the championship but also the Champions League. I played my last year under Ancelotti. When I told him I was ending my career, he asked me to reconsider. He said I could play at this level until I was 40. When he realised that I had made up my mind, he tried to get me on as his assistant coach. But I wanted to get some distance. He loves what he does and loves football and footballers. That is why everyone likes to play for the great coach Carlo Ancelotti. Philipp Lahm\u2019s column appears regularly in the Guardian. It is produced in partnership with Oliver Fritsch at Zeit Online, the German online magazine, and is being published in several European countries. Luca Lezzi of La Repubblica helped with the research for this column."

                    "body": "Lotte Wubben-Moy is not a stereotypical English centre-back. \u201cI\u2019ve always been competing, I\u2019ve always been competitive,\u201d the Arsenal player says, sounding so far, so normal. \u201cBut, then again, I\u2019ve always had parts of me that enjoy illustration, enjoy art, enjoy things off the pitch that I hold quite dear to my heart. Things that make me me.\u201d Football is everything and nothing to Wubben-Moy, so much a part of who she is but not the only part of her. \u201cIt\u2019s something that has been really close to my heart throughout my whole life,\u201d she says. \u201cI went to sixth form in Stoke Newington and almost every single person in that school was an Arsenal supporter. Arsenal in the Community was active at that school. I remember cutting the ribbon for the pitch that was opened there.  \u201cSo football has very much been intertwined with my life and intertwined with things off the pitch. But then the things off the pitch have also very much contributed to my successes and who I am on the pitch.\u201d It is this view of football, of its holistic potential and power, that inspired the 23-year-old to come to the table for contract renewal talks with more than money, contract length and football in mind. Friday\u2019s confirmation of an extension, the length undisclosed, came with a twist. \u201cAs part of her new deal,\u201d an Arsenal announcement said, \u201cLotte has also committed to working closely with Arsenal in the Community over the coming years to give back to the local area where she grew up and still lives.\u201d The England international, who has seven caps, is not just involving herself in existing community projects but has, with the club, drafted into her contract a 12-week programme that will run four times a year, inspired by her passions and aimed at women and girls in the communities in which she grew up.   \u201cThis is the next stage in my career and the contract is a reflection of that,\u201d she says. \u201cBut beyond that, it is important to me as a person too because I exist in the same community as Arsenal. I come from north and east London and that\u2019s very much where Arsenal is present \u2013 Hackney, Camden, Islington, these are the communities that the club serves. Within my contract I have excitingly built a programme inspired by my outlook on life, of appreciating the little things. Some of you may know that I write a blog [The Lotte Little Things] which is where I like to share my appreciation for those little things.\u201d The programme is \u201cbuilt upon giving back to my community\u201d, she says. \u201cIt will serve young girls and young women for the duration of my contract and I\u2019ll be part of it \u2013 giving my time and energy to give back. I\u2019ll be able to talk to them, to get involved. This is a side note on my contract which is extremely important to me.  \u201cI say this a lot, but football is a bridge over many waters. It helps give individuals options, give them possibilities, not necessarily reaching the highest professional level on the pitch but just on an enjoyment level. Football puts a smile on so many people\u2019s faces and I think it can help you be your happiest self.\u201d Wubben-Moy\u2019s project will incorporate football, art, reading and the environment, she says. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a 60/40 split for each session, which will be, hopefully, one and a half or two hours a week running for those 12 weeks. I haven\u2019t confirmed my timings and the amount of time that I will be able to give to those sessions, but I hope to get to as many as possible. In those sessions 60% of the time will go to playing football and 40% of the time will be looking towards either art, reading or the environment, bringing in individuals externally who will be able to help with that. At the end of the 12 weeks, there\u2019ll be an excursion, a trip out \u2013 I\u2019m pushing for a trip to the Tate but I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be doing various other trips as well.\u201d  That Wubben-Moy has been able to incorporate this project into her contract talks is testament to her ambitions for the game but also to her form. Having risen through Arsenal\u2019s academy and into the senior side before playing college football with the North Carolina Tar Heels in the US, the defender is 18 months into a second spell at the club \u2013 making her second debut in September 2020. She is a core member of the team and her new contract comes not long after her fellow centre-back and Arsenal fan Leah Williamson signed a new deal. \u201cThe direction in which the club is going isn\u2019t built upon sand, it\u2019s built upon years of legacy,\u201d says Wubben-Moy. \u201cLike Leah, I know that legacy, I know we come from a heritage of winning, of competing, and that is what we will continue to do and what we will build upon. I\u2019ve been watching Arsenal all my life but this seems like the next stage. It\u2019s my job and I want to use my skill, my experience, to achieve on the highest levels, parallel with the club, and to continue to push the team on.\u201d"

                    "body": "Chelsea (3-4-2-1) \u00c9douard Mendy Forced into action before the break with a decent save to parry Cheikhou Kouyat\u00e9\u2019s fierce volley but untroubled in second half. 7/10 C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta Willing to get forward on occasions but fluffed his lines with an ambitious volley from Timo Werner\u2019s cross early on. 6  Andreas Christensen Helped to prevent a Palace counterattack by cutting out the danger and a calm presence at back. 7 Antonio R\u00fcdiger Composed on the ball and his long pass set up a half-chance for Kai Havertz. Almost scored late on but fierce effort blocked. 6 Reece James Displayed his usual composure on the ball and always keen to launch attacks down the right. Effortless control in possession and also kept Wilfried Zaha reasonably quiet. Man of the match. 8 Jorginho Struggled in midfield and well off pace in first half. Lofted a ball hopelessly out of play to sum up sluggish showing. 6 Mateo Kovacic Failed to find his range with a cross which had too much power and appeared frustrated before being forced off early through injury. 6 Marcos Alonso Not overly effective as an attacking outlet down the left but grew into game as Chelsea dominated possession. 6  Timo Werner Failed to produce the fireworks of the last two games but troubled Palace with his relentless running and tireless work. Did well to play in Mason Mount for Chelsea\u2019s second goal and nearly set up a third. 7 Mason Mount Produced a disappointing early cross which was too close to Jack Butland and quiet early on. Improved after break and sealed Chelsea\u2019s win by weaving through for smart low finish. 6 Kai Havertz Busy in attack but struggled to exert his influence on the game. Rightly booked for diving in an attempt to win a penalty in the first half. 6 Substitutes Ruben Loftus-Cheek (for Kovacic, 26) 7; N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 (for Jorginho, 78) 7; Hakim Ziyech (for Mount, 77) 6; Romelu Lukaku (for Havertz, 77) 6; Thiago Silva (for Christensen, 82) 6.  Crystal Palace (4-3-3) Jack Butland Untroubled during the first half and came off his line quickly to thwart Werner after the break. Not at fault for either goal. 6 Joel Ward Defended solidly for most of game and played a dangerous long ball which almost created a first-half opening for Palace. 6 Joachim Andersen Did very well to cut out James\u2019s through ball which was heading for Werner. Struck the post although his effort was offside and should have done better from late header. 6 Marc Gu\u00e9hi The former Chelsea defender gave an impressive account of himself with a strong performance at the back. Powerful in the air. 7 Tyrick Mitchell Neat and tidy on the ball and occasionally combined down left with Zaha. Punished for losing ball at Chelsea\u2019s breakthrough. 6 Jeffrey Schlupp Tireless worker and willing to put in hard graft to frustrate Chelsea. Should have done better though when misplacing an attacking pass. 6  Cheikhou Kouyat\u00e9 Showed early promise in the midfield as he snuffed out Chelsea\u2019s attacks. Almost opened the scoring with his fierce volley and headed wide from a great position in second half. 7 James McArthur Did well to cut out Werner\u2019s cross and willing to track back and defend. Found it tough going in second half with Palace on defensive. 6  Eberechi Eze Lively on the odd occasion when given the chance to attack. Faded as the match progressed along with teammates. 6 Jean-Philippe Mateta Spurned an early opportunity after failing to take advantage of Zaha\u2019s incisive pass and did not got much change out of the Chelsea defence. 6 Wilfried Zaha Produced a teasing early through ball which should have been capitalised on by Mateta. Looked Palace\u2019s greatest threat on the counter but subdued towards end. 6 Substitutes Jordan Ayew (for Mateta, 55) 5; Christian Benteke (for Schlupp, 72) 6; Michael Olise (for McArthur, 72) 6; Luka Milivojevic (for Kouyat\u00e9, 84) 6."

Historically, my dad worked for the government. Abdullah\u2019s father was a reformer, and Lina\u2019s family was very liberal. In previous governments, these factions were played out against each other, but we are a new generation that can overcome the taboos that were forced upon us,\u201d Aljabri said.\n\u201cThe common denominator is MBS.\u201d\nOver breakfast, they talked about the neighborhood park where they used to take walks, not knowing how their lives would collide one day. \u201cWe talked about how MBS crushed Saudi civil society and how any government critique is forced into exile instead of being able do peaceful activism at home, safely,\u201d Aljabri said. \u201cWe talked about how brave the Saudi diaspora are, because the price of criticising, for Khashoggi, was death.\u201d\nThey talked, too, about the desire of Saudi\u2019s youth to have more than \u201cbread and circuses\u201d.\n\u201cThey want to take an active role in deciding their future. They want representation in government,\u201d Aljabri said.\nEach has spoken out publicly against Biden\u2019s trip to Saudi Arabia, a controversial presidential visit that has been criticised for breaking a campaign vow to turn Saudi Arabia into a \u201cpariah\u201d. For the assembled dissidents, the US president is \u201cnormalising\u201d the Saudi crown prince and validating the perception that the young de facto ruler can, literally, get away with murder.\n\nBiden has \u2013 until Friday \u2013 kept his distance from the crown prince, in part as retaliation for his role in ordering the gruesome murder of Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist killed by Saudi agents.\nHuman rights defenders have said they are not optimistic that Biden\u2019s trip, which is meant to strengthen strained ties between the US and Saudi Arabia at a time when Biden\u2019s approval ratings have been hit by high oil prices, and when the US is eager to counter Chinese and Russian influence, will deliver any human rights wins.\nIn Washington, few understand how high the stakes are more than the assembled trio. Aljabri\u2019s sister and brother \u2013 Sara and Omar \u2013 have been held in Saudi since 2020 as part of a Saudi campaign against their father, Saad Aljabri. The senior Aljabri \u2013 now in exile in Canada \u2013 was a close adviser to Mohammed bin Nayef, a former crown prince and interior minister who is being held in Saudi Arabia and has been seen as a potential political rival to Prince Mohammed. He has also been involved in litigation against entities associated with the crown prince.\n\u201cI expect to be killed one day because this guy will not rest until he sees me dead,\u201d Aljabri said on 60 Minutes last year.\nLina Al-Hathloul\u2019s sister, Loujain, is one of Saudi\u2019s most famous human rights defenders. In 2018, Loujain was one of several women activists arrested for speaking out against a driving ban. When Biden entered the White House, one of his first public announcements was that Loujain \u2013 who has alleged she was tortured while in confinement \u2013 had been released from prison. But her family \u2013 including Lina, who lives in Europe \u2013 are still campaigning for a travel ban against her to be lifted.\nAbdullah Alaoudh\u2019s father, Salman, was known as a reformist scholar and was arrested in 2017, hours after writing of his desire for reconciliation between Saudi and Qatar in a tweet. After he was held for a year without charges, Salman Alaoudh was accused of inciting the public against Prince Mohammed, calling for a change of government, and possessing banned books. Now his son Abdullah, who lives in the US, serves as the research director of Dawn, a non-profit founded by Khashoggi that promotes democracy in the Middle East. \nAfter their meeting, Khalid Aljabri considered what an alternative reality could have looked like, if all three were still in Saudi and not in exile, and if Prince Mohammed had not used \u201ccollective punishment\u201d against family members of his perceived enemies.\n\u201cI would have been a cardiologist working 80-hour weeks. Abdullah would have been a lawyer and an academic. Lina would have been among the first female lawyers, fighting for reform of the male guardianship system,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all so needless.\u201d"

                    "body": "Prince Charles faced fresh controversy over the funding of his charities on Sunday, with calls for the government and the Charity Commission to investigate claims he accepted \u20ac3m in cash from a billionaire Qatari sheikh. Claims in the Sunday Times that Charles accepted three donations between 2011 and 2015 from former Qatari prime minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber al-Thani \u2013 known as \u201cHBJ\u201d \u2013 were described as \u201cshocking\u201d by critics. One donation, totalling \u20ac1m, was reportedly handed over in a small suitcase and another was stuffed in a carrier bag from upmarket department store Fortnum &amp; Mason. The cash, allegedly then counted by Charles\u2019s aides and subsequently collected by Coutts bank, was paid to the Prince of Wales\u2019s charitable fund which aims to \u201ctransform lives and build sustainable communities\u201d through awarding grants. The fund told the Sunday Times that its trustees had concluded that the donor was legitimate and its auditors had signed off on the donation. Although there is no suggestion of any illegality, or that Charles offered anything in return for the generous donations, critics said it raised serious concerns about the future king\u2019s personal judgment, especially given Qatar\u2019s record on human rights. One described it as more like the actions of a \u201cSouth American drug baron\u201d than a future king, while another said the image of Charles\u2019s aides counting out the cash was like a scene from TV sitcom Only Fools and Horses. Clarence House said in a statement: \u201cCharitable donations received from Sheikh bin Jassim were passed immediately to one of the prince\u2019s charities, who carried out the appropriate governance and have assured us that all the correct processes were followed.\u201d The royal family\u2019s guidelines make no mention of cash donations, but do say that at their sole discretion members of the royal family are allowed to accept a cheque as a patron of, or on behalf of, a charity with which they are associated. The campaign group Republic today demanded full disclosure from Charles over this latest controversy and said it would be writing to Prince Charles, the government, MPs and the Charity Commission. Graham Smith of Republic said the claims were \u201cshocking\u201d and raised ethical questions. \u201cPrince Charles met Sheikh Hamad in private, with no officials present and with no disclosure of the meeting in the court circular,\u201d said Smith. \u201cSheikh Hamad faces serious accusations over human rights and has significant financial and other interests here in the UK.\u201d Norman Baker, a former government minister and Liberal Democrat MP, who has written a book on royal finances, said: \u201cA million dollars in cash stuffed into Fortnum and Mason bags, or shoved into a holdall or a suitcase, and handed over behind closed doors. This is what one might expect from a South American drug baron, not the heir to the British throne. It seems there are no lengths Charles will not go to get money for his good causes.\u201d Last year, Charles\u2019s closest aide Michael Fawcett was forced to resign after donations to another of his charities, the Prince\u2019s Foundation, came under scrutiny after allegations it offered to help a wealthy Saudi donor secure a knighthood and British citizenship. The Metropolitan police said earlier this year it is investigating the honours claim under the Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925, after complaints from Baker and others. Clarence House has said Charles had no knowledge of the alleged offers to the billionaire businessman Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz, who denies any wrongdoing. Of these latests claims, Baker said: \u201c[Charles] is already involved in a police investigation as a result of my complaint to the Metropolitan police last year. This is grubby, scuzzy behaviour which reinforces the view many are reaching: that Charles is not fit to be king. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t behave in any way which is appropriate to his position. If an MP behaved in that way they would be out of parliament.\u201d The Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, said the donations the Prince of Wales is alleged to have received from the former prime minister of Qatar would have gone through \u201cproper due process\u201d. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a government issue, but what I have seen is the palace have been very clear, that all moneys go through proper due process, the charities obviously go through proper due process,\u201d Lewis told the BBC\u2019s Sunday Morning programme. \u201cI\u2019m confident having had some dealings with charities, the Prince\u2019s Trust, the Prince\u2019s Foundation, around the palace in the past myself that these will have gone through proper due process.\u201d But the royal author and Prince Charles critic Tom Bower, said the claim that royal aides were asked to handle carrier bags stuffed with money was \u201clike a scene from the TV comedy Only Fools and Horses.\u201d Coutts declined to discuss specific transactions, but a spokesperson told the Mail on Sunday: \u201cWe have longstanding and robust policies and controls to assess the source, nature and purpose of large and unusual transactions. In particular, receipt of cash payments by the bank receive thorough review and oversight.\u201d"

The UK government updated its travel advice yesterday to \u201cstrongly advise\u201d those whose presence is \u201cnot essential\u201d in Russia to consider leaving now. In a statement on its website, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said: \u201cIf your presence in Russia is not essential, we strongly advise that you consider leaving by remaining commercial routes.\u201d While some Britons living in Russia told the Observer they were planning to stay despite the latest advice, others want to leave but are struggling. \u200bOne British man, 29, who has lived in Moscow for six years\u200b,\u200b said he faced a choice between staying in the country or being separated from his Russian wife. She does not currently have a passport because they married in October and she recently applied for a replacement with her new name. The new document is not due to arrive for another 10 days, meaning she cannot leave or begin applying for a UK visa. \u201cI don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to do,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the last week, 15 or 20 of my friends have left. Everyone has left; literally everyone.\u200b \u200bThe embassy would say, \u2018You should leave.\u2019 But I can\u2019t. What do I do? Leave my wife here on her own? I can\u2019t do that.\u201d The education consultant from London, who asked not to give his name, fearing complications, said they felt like \u201csitting ducks\u201d but were living \u201chour to hour\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly tense living here because you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen in the next couple of hours or days. Who knows what they\u2019re going to bring in?\u201d Other Britons have had to go to extreme lengths to leave Russia, including travelling hundreds of miles to cross via land into Estonia and Latvia, or paying thousands of pounds for flights via roundabout routes, passing through the Middle East or Turkey. Russia has seen severe disruption to air travel with sanctions causing widespread cancellations. Aeroflot, Russia\u2019s flagship air carrier, yesterday announced it was halting all international flights, although airlines serving destinations including Qatar and Dubai were understood to be continuing to operate yesterday. There are no direct flights to the UK. \u200bSome of those making it to the border \u200bhave reportedly been subjected to tense questioning by border officers, including having phones searched. \u201cPeople who are leaving via airports or land, as a result of this new law, they are checking everyone\u2019s Instagrams, Facebook statuses, checking the posts you\u2019ve liked, checking through your Whatsapp, Telegram conversations, everything,\u201d one British national said. \u201cYou have to be careful. It\u2019s a time to be cautious.\u201d"

                    "body": "Ministers have issued an ultimatum to the chief executive of Heathrow, calling on him to provide a plan to resolve the airport\u2019s staffing problems, it has been reported. John Holland-Kaye has until midday on Friday to assure ministers that the airport has sufficient workers for security screening and to assist disabled passengers, according to a letter from the Department for Transport\u2019s (DfT) director general for aviation, maritime and security and the chief executive of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) seen by the Daily Telegraph. The airport boss has also been asked to report back with a \u201ccredible and resilient capacity recovery plan for the next six months\u201d. Rannia Leontaridi, a civil servant in the DfT, and Richard Moriarty, the chief executive of the CAA, wrote: \u201cHeathrow and the airlines that use your airport must be assured, and be able to assure us, that you have in place a plan that can deliver a positive passenger experience through allowing as many people as possible to travel, without too much disruption and queues, and in particular to avoid significant numbers of short-notice and on-the-day cancellations. \u201cThe Government and the CAA are concerned that current resourcing plans are not delivering this outcome.\u201d The ultimatum comes as Emirates defied Heathrow\u2019s demand that airlines cut summer flights, saying it would continue to operate its planned schedule and accusing the London airport of fomenting \u201cairmageddon\u201d. The Gulf carrier said that the airport\u2019s request, made in an attempt to ease travel disruption, was \u201centirely unreasonable and unacceptable\u201d. In a blistering statement, the airline instead pointed the finger at Heathrow management\u2019s \u201cincompetence and non-action\u201d in failing to prepare for the rebound in flying after coronavirus travel restrictions were lifted. Heathrow announced on Tuesday that it was capping daily passenger numbers at 100,000 over the summer and telling airlines to stop selling tickets for the peak season. The move was designed to avoid repeats of the chaotic scenes at airports around country at Easter and half-term, caused by soaring demand for travel at a time of staff shortages. Apologising to those affected, Heathrow said on Tuesday that the passenger cap would mean some summer flights would either be moved to another day or airport or cancelled altogether. Airlines have already slashed thousands of flights from their summer schedules after UK aviation authorities offered a temporary \u201cslot amnesty\u201d, allowing airlines to escape forfeiting valuable takeoff and landing slots if they did not use them this year. The government said the move would benefit travellers by encouraging carriers to limit the number of last-minute cancellations.  Heathrow said the cuts did not go far enough, but Emirates \u2013 which operates six daily return flights between Britain\u2019s busiest airport and Dubai, and flies fleets of A380 superjumbos that cannot be used at smaller airports \u2013 said it was \u201chighly regrettable\u201d that Heathrow gave it 36 hours on Wednesday to comply with capacity reductions \u201cof a figure that appears to be plucked from thin air\u201d. The airline said: \u201cTheir communications not only dictated the specific flights on which we should throw out paying passengers, but also threatened legal action for non-compliance.\u201d Surging demand for summer travel after two years of Covid-19 restrictions has swamped airlines and airports in Europe, which are short-staffed after many pilots, cabin crew, check-in workers and baggage handlers were made redundant. That has left passengers facing last-minute cancellations, lengthy delays, lost luggage or long waits for bags. Heathrow blames a shortage of ground staff, who are contracted by airlines to check in passengers, load and unload bags, and prepare aircraft for their next journeys. Emirates, however, said its ground-handling and catering services are owned by the airline\u2019s parent company and \u201care fully ready and capable of handling our flights\u201d. The blame instead lies with the airport\u2019s \u201ccentral services and systems\u201d, it said. The airline accused Heathrow\u2019s management of being \u201ccavalier\u201d about passengers and airlines, with signs of a rebound in travel having been apparent for months. Emirates said that while it had prepared for the recovery, including by rehiring and training 1,000 pilots in the past year, Heathrow had failed to act, plan or invest. \u201cNow, faced with an \u2018airmageddon\u2019 situation due to their incompetence and non-action, they are pushing the entire burden of costs and the scramble to sort the mess to airlines and travellers,\u201d the statement said. Emirates urged London Heathrow\u2019s shareholders \u2013 largely sovereign wealth funds, including Qatar \u2013 to \u201cscrutinise the decisions of the management team\u201d, piling the pressure on Holland-Kaye.  Heathrow said it had been asking airlines for months to help draw up a plan to solve their staffing challenges, \u201cbut no clear plans were forthcoming, and with each passing day the problem got worse\u201d. The airport said in response to the Emirates statement: \u201cWe had no choice but to take the difficult decision to impose a capacity cap designed to give passengers a better, more reliable journey and to keep everyone working at the airport safe. \u201cIt would be disappointing if instead of working together, any airline would want to put profit ahead of a safe and reliable passenger journey.\u201d Rebooking so many potentially affected passengers is impossible because all flights for the next few weeks are full, including at other London airports and on alternative airlines, Emirates said. Moving some operations to other UK airports at short notice was also unrealistic, it added."

                    "body": "Western Australian police have raided the home of an Indigenous woman campaigning to protect ancient rock art while she was giving evidence as an expert witness in a case involving climate change protesters on Thursday. Raelene Cooper is a Mardudhunera woman and the former chair of the Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation who has been campaigning to protect sacred rock art on the Burrup peninsula in far-north Western Australia. The campaign, Save Our Songlines, says the cumulative impact from industrial activity on the peninsula is erasing ancient Indigenous rock art in the area, thought to be more than 60,000 years old.  Cooper is also the lead applicant on a Section 10 cultural assessment application under the federal government\u2019s Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act which is currently under way. Police raided the property at 11.45am on Thursday morning while Cooper was giving evidence as an expert witness during the trial of three climate change protesters who blockaded the Burrup peninsula in November 2021. The protesters cut off the peninsula by chaining themselves to vehicles along the only road in for 16 hours to protest Woodside Energy\u2019s efforts to develop the $16.5bn Scarborough gas project. Twelve officers in six cars carried out a search of her Karratha home in what Cooper believed was a \u201cpolitical motivated\u201d exercise in \u201cintimidation tactics\u201d. Though there were multiple children staying with Cooper, no one was present at the time and police broke the door to get inside.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  \u201cWhile I shared my cultural knowledge and authority as a traditional custodian, a dozen cops kicked down my unlocked door, locked up my dogs and went through my house,\u201d she said. \u201cThe police found nothing and charged me with no crime.\u201d Cooper was not involved in planning or carrying out the protest. According to a police interim property receipt seen by Guardian Australia, the only items removed from the property during the search were two \u201csmoking implements\u201d. A spokesperson for Western Australian police said in a statement the search was not related to Cooper\u2019s activism or Indigenous cultural heritage work but was carried out as part of an investigation into offences involving four other people. \u201cOn Thursday 1 December, Karratha detectives conducted several search warrants under the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1981,\u201d they said. \u201cThis was a day-of-action, responding to several community reports received in recent weeks. These reports described antisocial behaviour, and drug related activity on Miles Loop in Baynton.\u201d Four people were charged with seven offences. Cooper was not among them and said \u201cto the best of her knowledge\u201d no one in her household had been charged any offence."

                    "body": "They say it\u2019s a woman\u2019s prerogative to change her mind but such is Rachael Blackmore\u2019s quiet determination to be known first and foremost as just a jockey, rather than a female one, that it ought to have come as no surprise that she stuck to her guns and elected to ride A Plus Tard in this year\u2019s Gold Cup despite being beaten into second place on him 12 months ago.\nWhile the novelty value of Blackmore\u2019s gender in a massively male dominated, often brutal profession has gradually dissipated to the point where it barely merits a mention, it is worth noting for the record that she has achieved yet another historic milestone in becoming the first woman in the 98-year history of the race to win the Cheltenham Gold Cup. She did so in fine style, pulling 15 lengths clear of Minella Indo, the reigning champion and one of two Henry de Bromhead-trained runners in the 11-strong field that Blackmore could have requested the leg-up on.\n\nDecisions, decisions. On the eve of the race, Blackmore had said she was \u201creally looking forward\u201d to renewing her Gold Cup acquaintance with A Plus Tard, but we can only imagine the internal anguish that came with being so spoiled for what amounted to a coin-toss choice. Had she decided to swap, ride Minella Indo and lose to A Plus Tard, her judgment would almost certainly have been called into question by an army of armchair jockeys who have never ridden anything more temperamental or subject to the vagaries of form as a bicycle. Had Minella Indo prevailed again without her on board, her decision to stick with A Plus Tard would have looked similarly foolish, bordering on stubborn.\nTo the untrained eye, it looked as if Blackmore might have blown it as she watched her mount\u2019s stable companion begin to pull away at the third last. Stuck behind a wall of four horses, she and A Plus Tard looked to have no visible way through. Unperturbed, horse and rider bided their time and in her post-race debrief, Blackmore said the galloping equine roadblock lined across her strip of track had actually worked to her advantage by preventing her from jumping the gun and going too soon.\nPush came to predictably vigorous shove at the business end of the race, when she squeezed through a narrow gap that opened between Protektorat and Al Boum Photo before flicking the switch and sending A Plus Tard to hunt Minella Indo down. \u201cI knew I had more horse under me approaching the last than last year,\u201d said Blackmore, who was modest enough not to mention that A Plus Tard also had a lot more jockey than 12 months ago on his back. Since finishing second last year, Blackmore has added the Grand National and a second Champion Hurdle \u2013 among other notable pots \u2013 to an increasingly stellar CV.\nHaving had her fairytale breakthrough at Cheltenham 12 months ago somewhat spoiled by Covid and her incorrect choice of Gold Cup mount, for the second time this week Blackmore was once again allowed to enjoy the warm and raucous welcome back to the winner\u2019s enclosure which was denied to her last year.\n\nThe most popular Festival-winning jockey since her retired colleague Ruby Walsh, it is a measure of the high regard in which she is held that despite saddling three winners earlier in the afternoon, a beaming Willie Mullins made his way to the chute through which she was parading towards the winner\u2019s enclosure to give her a big thumbs-up. Also in attendance in his role as co-owner of third-placed Protektorat: serial winner Sir Alex Ferguson, who looked similarly pleased as he gave her what looked suspiciously like a wave.\nOf course Blackmore and A Plus Tard\u2019s success meant that there could be no win for the well-fancied Galvin, which was ridden by Davy Russell and trained by Gordon Elliott.\nHaving served his ban for an almost unfathomable act of stupidity which led to millions around the world seeing him photographed sitting astride a dead horse 13 months ago, Elliott may well have earned his shot at redemption but the sight of him grinning on board the most prestigious podium in racing at the first time of asking since the renewal of his licence would almost certainly have come too soon for a general public who might in time be willing to forgive but will almost certainly never forget.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do this without the horses and being attached to Henry\u2019s yard is just absolutely phenomenal,\u201d said Blackmore in her post race interview with ITV. \u201cTo give me this horse is unbelievable. I don\u2019t know what to say. I\u2019ve had so many special days. I wouldn\u2019t swap the Grand National for anything, but this is the Gold Cup. I wish I had something better to say right now. I just can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThis is a constant, almost apologetic post-race refrain of Blackmore\u2019s: one in which she repeatedly feels the need to explain how bad she feels at not having the requisite vocabulary to put her increasingly regular post-race feelings of euphoria into words.\nIt really matters not one whit \u2013 as long as she continues to let her riding do the talking, it\u2019s difficult to imagine that too many punters will care."

Cobblers Dream got there but ran out of petrol at the last. \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic to win here, it\u2019s been a long week,\u201d says a bespectacled Joseph O\u2019Brien.

Off we go for the final time, after a slight delay in which the rowdy crowd as singing \u201cplease don\u2019t take me home\u201d. Shades of darts at Ally Pally. Cheltenham town centre will be absolute carnage tonight, that\u2019s for sure. Another delay, as \u201cshall we sing a song for you\u201d is heard, and a huge roar goes up. Two fall at the second, including Langer Dan with Grand Jury gone too, that\u2019s the favourite gone. Bigz Belief, the outsider, is an early leader, while Banbridge is handy. Decimation goes down, and takes down Lucky Max and it looked very nasty just ahead of the stands and into the back straight. Bigz Belief running a big race up ahead, as they head up the hill. Loose horses aplenty. Bambridge in second place, as Hollow Games goes wide. Adamantly Chosen goes round the outside. Banbridge and Cobblers\u2019 Dream go for it. And Banbridge takes it for Ireland, a clean sweep on the day. All seven. Ireland 18-10 Team GB. That was a winner for Joseph O\u2019Brien, with Hollow Games in third.    Updated at 6.06pm GMT    5.25pm    The jockey, Sam Coltherd, took a heavy fall in that mares\u2019 chase and has been taken to the medical room, after Maid O\u2019Malley came down.

That\u2019s what you get for chasing your losses \u2013 something that no responsible journalist could ever advocate \u2013 but it\u2019s 362 days until our next chance to back a winner at the Festival and so a small each-way interest on something at a big price is probably in order. The one that caught my eye yesterday in the search for a likely outsider was Noel Meade\u2019s Hes A Hardy Bloke, who ran an eyecatching race at the Dublin Racing Festival and is trying this trip for the first time. He was priced up at 33-1 yesterday afternoon and has since been backed down to 16-1, which is encouraging but also makes me feel like the boat may have been missed. Among the favourites, Langer Dan will be popular as his close second behind Galopin Des Champs 12 months ago has been franked in no uncertain terms by the winner\u2019s subsequent exploits. Hollow Games is also a springer in the market for Gordon Elliott, but wherever your money ends up in \u2013 if, indeed, it ends up anywhere at all \u2013 I hope you\u2019ll be ending the week in high spirits, and if you\u2019re not actually in front then you\u2019re not too far behind either.      5.09pm    Mark Walsh, the winning jockey on Elimay in that mares\u2019 race, says to Racing TV: \u201cI had to give a squeeze and got us to the line. She stuck her head and took it to the line. There\u2019s a lot of lads inside with two winners. Everything\u2019s run well.      5.05pm   4.50pm Mares' Chase result   1. Elimay (Mark Walsh 9/4  2. Pink Legend (Charlie Deutsch) 33/1 3. Scarlet And Dove ( (Bryan Cooper) 28/1 8 ran    Updated at 5.06pm GMT    5.02pm    That was a tenth Mullins win, a fifth of the day, and in the last, the assistant trainer, David Casey, once a good rider himself, suggests Adamantly Chosen can win the last. Some of the bookmakers must have headed for the hills by now. Mark Walsh, a rider with a big reputation in Ireland, adds to his reputation as an expert negotiator of the Cheltenham pitfalls.   Updated at 6.06pm GMT    4.57pm    4.50pm Mares Chase Elimay starts off strongly but drops back as Zambella looks keen in front, and Elimay is slow to jump. Mount Ida is the back marker as they pass the stands. Zamella leads Maid O\u2019Malley with Elimay sat in third. Paul Townend sits quiet on Concertista only for her to make a mistake, but keeps her place. As the field climbs, it\u2019s still Zambella but Maid O\u2019Malley joins them. Vienna Court creeps up. Concertista makes a mistake three from home as Townend has to set to work. Maid O\u2019malley goes down to stop Vienna Court\u2019s progress, and Elimay, who came second last year, wins and that makes it ten for Willie Mullins, as Mark Walsh plugs her home ahead of Venetia Williams\u2019 Pink Legend. A thrilling finish but it ends in the usual way, a win for Willie Mullins and Elimay.

The horse is just so lazy but Patrick obviously had faith in him. We\u2019ve been waiting for this day for three years - it is terrific. Patrick never gave up. He has confidence in him, but maybe he was a little bit over confident today. It is Rachael\u2019s afternoon today, but we\u2019re delighted too. We had a fair bit of luck there!  Patrick Mullins, speaking to Racing TV. \u201cHalfway up the line I could see Barry\u2019s horse wasn\u2019t going forward again. I\u2019ve been on the wrong side of photo finishes the last couple of years so it\u2019s so good to be on the right side of one.\u201d     4.30pm    4.50pm Mares\u2019 Chase preview The second running of this Grade Two contest, which produced a thrilling finish 12 months ago as Colreevy got up in the final 50 yards to beat Elimay, the likely favourite today. She is one of just three runners at single-figure odds and with Concertista giving weight to the other two, Elimay and Mount Ida, who took the Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir here last year, are probably the ones to focus on. Mount Ida actually gave Elimay 3lb and a half-length beating at Fairyhouse earlier this season, but she has a well-known tendency to jump to her right, which can be a big issue around a left-handed track like Cheltenham. She got away with it 12 months ago but this is a different test and Elimay is probably the way to go.      4.27pm   4.10pm Hunters\u2019 Chase result   1 Billaway (Mr P W Mullins) 13-8 Fav 2 Winged Leader (Mr B O\u2019Neill) 9-2 3 Mighty Stowaway (Mr J J Codd) 33-1 19 ran   Updated at 4.28pm GMT    4.26pm    That\u2019s nine for Willie Mullins, just look at that roll of honour.       4.24pm    On ITV, an Irish bookmaker has just said, \u201cWe\u2019re gone.\u201d He then waved a white flag of surrender, saying he will never be back to Cheltenham. Poor Winged Leader, he just couldn\u2019t get there. Barry O\u2019Neill, his rider, looked distraught.    Updated at 4.38pm GMT    4.21pm    4.10pm Hunters Chase The Foxhunters in old money gets underway, the amateur jockeys getting their turn. There is a slight delay, as there is a straggler who makes his way to the back of the field, Don Bersy. There are 21 jumps in this one and Don Bersy takes to the front, and goes five lengths clear as they go past the stands. Billaway, for whom a win would be very bad news for the bookies, is ahead of mid-division. Winged Leader is up there, too with still 14 to jump. Bob And Co goes, shipping off David Maxwell as Don Bersy continues to lead. Premier Magic is pulled up at the back of the field. Billaway up in sixth as they again go past the stands, and the coach parks. Don Bersy loses the lead to Winged Leader with a missed jump, and then another before being pulled up. Winged Leader is clear of Dubai Quest. Billaway is well off the pace and the bookies can breathe easy. Winged Leader and Mighty Stowaway go at it, Billaway closes, six lengths back. Winged Leader keeps going up ahead, Billaway storms home and takes it....that\u2019s the bookies beaten, what a surge, Winged Leader just ran out of puff, oh so tired. Another Mullins win! They are unstoppable.

Porlock Bay, last year\u2019s 80-1 winner, was a prime example, but even here, the big operations are slowly moving in and Willie Mullins\u2019s Billaway is expected to head the market for the third year running, having found one opponent too good in both 2020 and 2021. The eight-year-old looks to be in his prime this time around, bolted up in his trial at Naas in February and has Patrick Mullins is back in his saddle after amateurs were banned from taking part last year. He will take all the beating, but Winged Leader\u2019s connections will hope for a repeat of their horse\u2019s 12-length defeat of Billaway in January, when Mullins\u2019s runner was coming back from a nine-month break and probably needed the race much more than the winner. Bob And Co, whose trainer Paul Nicholls has won this four times since 2004, also has live claims for the Corinthian owner/rider David Maxwell.   Updated at 3.58pm GMT    3.55pm    Here\u2019s our snap report, with more to follow.       3.55pm    Henry de Bromhead, the winning trainer, and last year\u2019s winning trainer, having done a 1-2 two years in succession, spoke to the BBC.   It was incredible. I\u2019m delighted - Rachael was brilliant on him. I\u2019m delighted with Minella Indo too - he ran an absolute blinder as well. Rachael was so brave with the way she went about it. She was just amazing on him. It does feel different this year. It\u2019s the crowd. It\u2019s incredible. It was amazing to win it last year but it\u2019s triple amazing this year.      3.53pm    To quote a friend who knows more than I do: \u201c[Rachael] kept [A Plus Tard] covered up so brilliantly and then used his pace to perfection. When she was on the [ITV] Opening Show this morning AP [McCoy] was quizzing her on tactics and she has delivered her plan superbly.\u201d  Updated at 4.02pm GMT    3.49pm    More from Rachael Blackmore, speaking to ITV.  I can\u2019t believe it. I am so lucky to get to ride all these horses. You can\u2019t do it without these horses. Being attached to Henry\u2019s yard is unbelievable. I don\u2019t know what to say. I wouldn\u2019t swap the Grand National for anything but this is the Gold Cup. I wish I had something better to say but I just can\u2019t! I can\u2019t explain how lucky I feel.    Updated at 3.50pm GMT    3.47pm   3.30pm Cheltenham Gold Cup Chase result   1. A Plus Tard (Rachael Blackmore) 3/1 fav 2. Minella Indo (Robbie Power) 7/1 3. Protektorat (Harry Skelton) 10/1 4. Galvin (Davy Russell) 3/1 11 ran    Updated at 4.31pm GMT    3.44pm    A patient ride, so cool considering what happened last year when A Plus Tard lost out to Minella Indo. They won by 15 lengths or so. Each-way money if you backed Protektorat who picked up the pieces of the rest of the race that was blown open by Minella Indo, before Rachael Blackmore guided A Plus Tard home.    Updated at 3.47pm GMT    3.41pm    Henry de Bromhead has done it again, Rachael Blackmore has now won the Gold Cup, to follow up the Champion Hurdle and Grand National last year. She\u2019s one of the greats now, many great jockeys have never won all three of those races. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it, I am so lucky, you can\u2019t do this without the horses,\u201d she says, paying tribute to Henry de Bromhead. \u201cI wish I had something better to say. I can\u2019t explain how fecking lucky I feel.\u201d She\u2019s the first woman jockey to ride a Gold Cup winner. She continues to make history and break all the taboos.    Updated at 4.30pm GMT    3.38pm   A Plus Tard and Rachael Blackmore win the Cheltenham Gold Cup!  Al Boum Photo is being worked on as Chantry House is pulled up. Asterion Forlonge goes off the front. Minella Indo gives chase, A Plus Tard behind them. Off the final bend, Minella Indo goes and has gone well clear, and A Plus Tard is after him, and jumps to the lead and Rachael Blackmore has done it, Minella Indo second, a reverse of last year!   Updated at 3.43pm GMT    3.35pm    3.30pm Cheltenham Gold Cup Chase Chantry House is an early struggler, as Aye Right, the outsider, leads the field. Royal Pagaille looks keen as they go to 13 out, but it\u2019s a tight bunch as they go past the main stand to quite a noise. Asterion Forlonge\u2019s jumping is still not straight but all are up and doing with eight fences to jump. Minella Indo prepares to move. This could be a tactical one. Plenty of chances to go with six to jump.      3.32pm    3.30pm Cheltenham Gold Cup Chase The starter, Robbie Supple, sends them away and Tornado Flyer is one of the first to show but then makes a mistake at the first. Santini sits in second over the second. Tornado Flyer drops to the back. Asterion Forlonge jumps left, causing a traffic problem and Protektorat struggles at the next. A Plus Tard is next to not look so good over a fence.    Updated at 3.47pm GMT    3.30pm    The parade completed, the horses set off for the start. Davy Russell removes the hood of Galvin, who is a soft ground horse, though the ground is now more sticky than soft, so is the geology of the Cheltenham Old Course. A Plus Tard goes off favourite at 11/4, with Galvin at 10/3.      3.27pm    The jockeys are in the parade ring of what looks such an open race, with so many ways and narratives. Even Santini at 66/1, the slow himself, might have a chance. Jack Kennedy, who rode Minella Indo last year to win the Gold Cup, has no ride. Instead, the defending champion is ridden by Robbie \u201cRobert\u201d Power. On the TV, AP McCoy thinks Galvin is the one, as does Mick Fitzgerald. Dan Skelton does not seem too confident about Protektorat. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do now,\u201d he says.      3.21pm    3.30pm Cheltenham Gold Cup Chase odds  A Plus Tard \u2013 11/4 Galvin \u2013 4/1 Al Boum Photo \u2013 7/1  Minella Indo \u2013 7/1  Tornado Flyer \u2013 10/1 Protektorat \u2013 11/1 Chantry House \u2013 16/1 Royale Pagaile \u2013 20/1  Asterion Forlonge \u2013 25/1 Santini \u2013 66/1 Aye Right \u2013 100/1 Latest odds at Oddschecker      3.16pm    Sir Alex Ferguson is circling in the parade ring, as a part-owner of Protektorat, trained by Harry Skelton and ridden by Harry Skelton.    Updated at 3.37pm GMT    3.15pm    3.30 Cheltenham Gold Cup Chase preview Some Gold Cups revolve around a hot favourite, a horse like Kauto Star or Best Mate who ranks among the all-time greats, while others \u2013 like this year\u2019s renewal \u2013 are wide-open and could conceivably be won by eight or nine of the runners. Some might argue that a superstar like Best Mate is the best possible advert for jump racing, but from a punter\u2019s point of view, getting four or five times your money back for finding the winner is great PR too and personally, I\u2019ll take an open Gold Cup every time. Galvin has been eased out of top spot in the betting this morning by A Plus Tard, no doubt because Rachael Blackmore will be trying to go one better than last year on Henry de Bromhead\u2019s gelding. He needs to find one-and-a-quarter lengths to get the better of his stable companion and last year\u2019s winner, Minella Indo, and looked like an improved performer when running away with the Betfair Chase at Haydock Park in October. He has since been narrowly beaten by Galvin in the Savills Chase at Leopardstown\u2019s Christmas meeting, but the stable\u2019s form was in a trough at the time and Blackmore, feels she went for home a little too soon, allowing Galvin\u2019s deep reserves of stamina to come into play as he stayed on strongly to edge them out on the line. There has also been some money for Al Boum Photo, third last year and the winner for the two preceding renewals, and Tornado Flyer, another Willie Mullins-trained runner who sprang a surprise in the King George at Kempton on Boxing Day, while Protektorat, the leading British-trained contender for a race that has gone Ireland\u2019s way in five of the last six seasons, is on the slide. He put up a mighty effort under top weight in the Paddy Power Gold Cup in November and seemed to improve for the step up in trip when successful on heavy ground over three miles at Aintree in December. He is no forlorn each-way hope, but for win purposes, Minella Indo\u2019s course form and habit of blossoming in the spring makes him the pick of the prices for me at around 6-1 and I\u2019ll be hoping to see him give Robbie Power a second win in this race after Sizing John\u2019s triumph in 2016.    Updated at 3.22pm GMT    3.10pm    That Willie Mullins win for The Nice Guy confirms his status as top trainer with eight wins, and four more races to come. Nobody does it better, quite frankly. And very few ever have. That\u2019s equalling his best ever tally of eight and he will win a record-breaking ninth top trainer award.    Updated at 3.17pm GMT    3.04pm   2.50pm Albert Bartlett Novice Hurdle result   1 The Nice Guy (Sean O\u2019Keeffe) 18/1 2 Minella Cocooner (Paul Townend) 9/2 3 Bardenstown Lad (Sean Bowen) 20/1 4 Ballygriffincottage (Harry Skelton) 28/1 16 ran      3.00pm    Sadly, that race is overshadowed by what happened to Ginto, who is being attended to in front of the stands. That was not good to see. Sean O\u2019Keefe the rider of The Nice Guy says \u201che jumped great, a great performance on the horse\u201d as he rode his first ever Cheltenham race and it seems his first ever grade one, too. It\u2019s all Mullins, but all thoughts with Ginto. Urgh, that\u2019s so hard to watch.   Updated at 3.05pm GMT    2.58pm    2.50pm Albert Bartlett Novices\u2019 Hurdle  Over this long trip they go, the last race before the big one. It\u2019s very loud out on the course, says ITV\u2019s Luke Harvey. It really is a big crowd today. El banter will be flowing aplenty. They go off with Ginto and Hillcrest as joint favs but there\u2019s a false start after a very long prelim. They go off with something of a jolt and set off at one hell of a rate. Classic Getaway lives up to his name by going to the front of the field. Hill Crest doesn\u2019t jump too well over the third, and he\u2019s labouring a tad. Minella Cocooner is pushing them on, and the two Mullins horses in the pack are caught a little off guard. Stag Horn and Classic Getaway still lead. Cheers as they go past the stands, Ginto in fifth and sitting relatively pretty. Minella Cocooner takes it right up, speeding along in his classic style and he nearly comes a cropper. Hill Crest still slow in the pack with three to jump. Hill Crest is pulled up and so is Classic Getaway. The pace has been heavy. Down the hill they go to the second last with Minella Cocooner leading. Ballygriffin Cottage coming from deep. Ginto...oh no, he\u2019s gone wrong. Minella Cocooner and the Nice Guy going to the last and the Nice Guy who will win from Minella Cocooner. It\u2019s a Mullins 1-2, but maybe not the Mullins we expected.   Updated at 3.12pm GMT    2.45pm    Hillcrest will be a big part of those fav backers who like a double, a treble, a quadpot, a Yankee. He and Ginto are flip-flopping as favourites. Hillcrest goes in the colours of the late Trevor Hemmings, and would bring many a tear should he win. The rain has softened the ground for him, and trainer Henry Daly appears just happy for the horse to come home safely.      2.36pm    2.50pm - Albert Bartlett Novices\u2019 Hurdle odds  Hillcrest \u2013 9/4 Ginto \u2013 11/4 Minella Cocooner \u2013 13/2 Shantreusse \u2013 14/1 Good Time Jonny \u2013 18/1  The Nice Guy \u2013 20/1  Bardenstown Lad \u2013 20/1  Stag Horn \u2013 20/1  Classic Getaway \u2013 25/1 Ballygrifincottage \u2013 28/1  Ramillies \u2013 33/1  Eric Bloodaxe \u2013 33/1  Mahler Mission - 70/1  Broson - 125/1  Where It All Began - 150/1 Latest odds at Oddschecker      2.31pm    2.50pm - Albert Bartlett Novices\u2019 Hurdle preview Two of the outsiders \u2013 Falcon Eight and The Real Whacker \u2013 are non-runners but there is still a big field of 17 runners for the Festival\u2019s three-mile novice hurdle, a race that includes the future Gold Cup winners Minella Indo and Bobs Worth on its roll of honour. It has also seen several shocks over the years \u2013 only one of the last eight winners has started at a single-figure price \u2013 probably because it is a very different test to anything the runners have faced before, not just in terms of the trip but also, crucially, the unrelenting pace from the off. Hillcrest, who might well have a flawless 5-5 record had he not unseated his rider when a rival fell in front of him at Cheltenham in January, has replaced Ginto as favourite this morning, with punters perhaps feeling that Ginto would have been Gordon Elliott\u2019s second-string had the ante-post favourite, Minella Crooner, not been scratched due to injury last week. That was a big disappointment, but it did at least avoid any watch-your-bets confusion with Minella Cocooner, a Grade One winner last time for Willie Mullins. Looking beyond the market leaders, John McConnell\u2019s Bardenstown Lad looks the type to outrun his price of around 16-1. He was sent over for a three-mile novice on the Old course at the October meeting here, then put away until his Festival prep at Musselburgh in early February. He has bags of stamina, seems certain to relish this test and looks a fair each-way bet with many bookies offering five places.      2.22pm   2.10pm County Hurdle result   1 State Man (Paul Townend) 11-4 Fav 2 First Street (Nico de Boinville) 16-1 3 Colonel Mustard (C J Orr) 13-2 4 West Cork (Harry Skelton) 13-2 26 ran    Updated at 2.43pm GMT    2.20pm    Winning jockey Paul Townend says the ride he gave State Man was \u201call over the place, I got there too soon.\u201d And Townend speaks up for Al Boum Photo in the Gold Cup. \u201cPlease God I\u2019ll be talking to you again,\u201d he tells Alice Plunkett. By the way, Ballyadam took fifth in that race.   Updated at 2.21pm GMT    2.19pm    2.10pm County Hurdle The horses take a slow walk to the line as State Man goes to 11/4 as they get underway over the eight hurdles. State Man looks keen on the outside inthe early stages, Stepney Causeway in the lead almost goes over but rights himself as they surge past the Best Mate stand and the coach park. Tritonic is up there. Stepney Causeway leads as they go past halfway. State Man still making no significant move from midfield where he is with West Cork. Two to clear but a long way to go, and Cask Mate goes over. Surprise Package and State Man go as they go to the last. State Man goes to the front at the last and speeds to the line. Another win for Mullins and Townend, First Street in second, Colonel Mustard in third, West Cork in fourth. Two Mullins favourites go in in the first two races.    Updated at 2.24pm GMT    2.04pm    The odds on State Man are tumbling, it\u2019s one of those talking horses of the festival where it\u2019s a good thing that everyone is on. The County Hurdle has often featured such horses, and usually goes the way of Ireland and often Willie Mullins, too.      2.01pm    2.10pm County Hurdle preview The image of Suprise Package cantering all over his rivals in last Saturday\u2019s Imperial Cup is fresh in the memory here, and any one of the 18 \u2013 yes, 18 \u2013 Irish-trained runners in the 26-strong field could easily find a stone or more and do something similar here. In fact, a dozen of them probably could and still not finish in the frame, such is the nature of this race now with potentially high-class novices replacing the hardened two-mile handicap hurdlers of yesteryear in the field. Suprise Package will pick up a \u00a350,000 bonus if he follows up here, while Cormier, a winner at Musselburgh\u2019s valuable recent meeting, is chasing a \u00a3100,000 bonus for a win. State Man, the likely favourite, is one of the most unexposed runners in the field, fell two out when odds-on \u2013 and looking the likely winner \u2013 for his Irish debut in December and then hosed up in a maiden hurdle at Limerick. He could prove to be 20lb well in, but he has a similar profile to Gaelic Warrior, who was beaten at very short odds in Tuesday\u2019s Fred Winter, and there are each-way alternatives aplenty. West Cork, whose trainer, Dan Skelton, has won this three times since 2016, won the Greatwood Hurdle over the Old course here in November and has been put away since a good run at Ascot in December, but the less-exposed I Like To Move It, touched off in the ultra-competitive Betfair Hurdle last time, makes slightly more appeal for me as his recent form is stronger and he has only just five runs over hurdles behind him.

I wanted to keep him for a novice next season but Rich (Ricci) wanted to use him.\u201d Some talk Vauban may one day go back on the flat and be targeted at the Melbourne Cup. The speed is certainly there.\u201d Rich Ricci, the owner of Vauban, told the BBC: \u201c\u201cHe is a proper little taxi. He is a lovely horse. He\u2019s got some engine and I am delighted with that.\u201d   Updated at 1.56pm GMT    1.40pm   1.30 Triumph Hurdle result   1. Vauban (Paul Townend) 6-4 Fav 2. Fil Dor (Davy Russell) 11-2 3.

Fil Dor is up there with Vauban stalking them, who puts in a rather unceremonious jump as they go past the stands. With four to jump but a long way to go, Porticello and Fil Dor stay well in front. The hill serves to bunch them back up again as they head to the second-last. Porticello and Fil Dor go to the last. Vauban makes his move as he goes to the last and misses it, only to recover his step, beating Fil Dor and Pied Piper. Vauban, ridden by Paul Townend, trained by Willie Mullins, has quite the engine and won with plenty in hand.    Updated at 1.46pm GMT    1.24pm    The horses are walking round a very packed out parade ring, and it looks very busy at trackside, too. Willie Mullins trains the favourite for the first race of the day, some things never change. ITV\u2019s coverage suggests some very silly money has gone on Vauban, and Fil Dor, who will be ridden by Davy Russell. Plenty of chances here, though, and with that go plenty of chances to lose money.      1.12pm    1.30pm - JCB Triumph Hurdle odds  Vauban \u2013 15/8 Pied Piper \u2013 7/2 Fil Dor \u2013 13/2 Il Etait Temps \u2013 12/1 Porticello \u2013 14/1 Icare Allen \u2013 16/1 Knight Salute \u2013 18/1 Doctor Parnassus \u2013 22/1 Teddy Blue \u2013 33/1 Lunar Power \u2013 66/1 Ages of Man \u2013 250/1 Koi Dodville \u2013 250/1  Latest odds at Oddschecker      1.04pm    Someone, a female singer, is strangling You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone over the tannoy system as the concourses begin to fill up. It looks a very sunny and bright day out there. From experience, Gold Cup day is when the trackside debauchery really goes into overdrive, not that the rest of the days are shy of that. The horizon will be filled with Peaky Blinders caps, and the no-socks brigade are out in force. A fair few pairs of mocassins perished in the mud on Wednesday.      1.00pm    Today\u2019s full schedule of the fourth and final day at Cheltenham.   1.30pm - JCB Triumph Hurdle 2m 179y 2:10pm - McCoy Contractors County Hurdle 2m 179y 2:50pm - Albert Bartlett Novices\u2019 Hurdle - 2m 7f 213y 3.30pm - Boodles Cheltenham Gold Cup Chase 3m 2f 70y 4.10pm - St. James\u2019s Place Festival Challenge Cup Open Hunters\u2019 Chase 3m 2f 70y 4.50pm - Mrs Paddy Power Mares\u2019 Chase 2m 4f 127y 5.30pm - Martin Pipe Handicap Hurdle 2m 4f 56y      12.48pm    1.30 Triumph Hurdle preview The Triumph Hurdle is a much classier race now that the Fred Winter has arrived as an alternative attraction for the juveniles. Whether it is a better race is a matter of opinion, as there was something about the sight of 28 hurdlers careering around the New course at the top of the Gold Cup card which made finding the winner a particular pleasure. Anyway, those days are gone, but there have still been a few double-figure winners in recent years and while the ones at the top of the market have all put up solid trials, a horse like Il Etait Temps, who was pitched straight into Grade One company for his hurdling debut at the Dublin Racing Festival, could easily improve past them. He was just six lengths behind Vauban, today\u2019s favourite, there, although Paul Townend has opted for Vauban and that must count for something. Pied Piper, who was sent over to Cheltenham by Gordon Elliott for the Triumph Trial over course and distance in January, is also a live contender and his form there was backed up by a good time, even though he crossed the line on a tight rein. At the prices, though, I\u2019ll take a chance on the leading British juvenile, Knight Salute, who has done nothing but improve since being switched to hurdling from the Flat this season. He remains unbeaten after five starts, put up his best performance yet to win the Adonis at Kempton in a strong time and has perhaps been slightly overlooked in the market as Milton Harris, his trainer, is hardly a household name.    Updated at 12.54pm GMT    12.41pm    The Guardian Sport photographer, Tom Jenkins, has been at the festival and here\u2019s some of his best pics.       12.29pm    More memory lane and some real greats here. Five years ago, Sizing John was the winner under Robbie Power, trained by Jessica Harrington. Ten years ago, Synchronised was the winner, ridden by AP McCoy and trained by Jonjo O\u2019Neill.  Fifteen years ago, Kauto Star won the first of his two Gold Cups, ridden by Ruby Walsh and trained by Paul Nicholls.  Twenty years ago, it was Best Mate who won the first of his three Gold Cups, ridden by Jim Culloty and trained by Henrietta Knight.  Twenty-five years ago, it was Mr Mulligan, ridden by AP McCoy and trained by Noel Chance.      12.20pm    Time for memory lane, starting with last year\u2019s race.   A fine jump two out tightened Minella Indo\u2019s grip on the prize and Al Boum Photo was already booked for third as De Bromhead\u2019s two runners arrived at the final fence. A Plus Tard was a fraction slow, leaving him with two lengths to find up the hill. He narrowed the gap to one\u2011and\u2011a\u2011quarter at the line but Minello Indo stayed on too strongly to give Blackmore any real hope of nosing in front.        11.46am    Here\u2019s the leading trainers\u2019 standings (1st, 2nd, 3rd)  Willie Mullins IRE 5 2 7 Gordon Elliott IRE 2 6 1 Nicky Henderson 2 4 1 Venetia Williams 2 1 2 Henry de Bromhead IRE 2 - 2 Gavin Cromwell IRE 1 1 1 Lucinda Russell 1 1 - Harry Fry 1 - - Alan King 1 - - Hughie Morrison 1 - - Ben Pauling 1 - - Padraig Roche IRE 1 - - Evan Williams 1 - -    Updated at 12.02pm GMT    11.44am    Here\u2019s the leading jockeys\u2019 standings (1st, 2nd, 3rd).

She failed 12 months ago, finishing one-and-a-quarter lengths behind Minella Indo after deciding to ride his stable companion, A Plus Tard, instead. It was one of those choices that come with the territory for an elite jockey attached to a major stable. Blackmore had ridden Minella Indo in his previous 10 races and A Plus Tard in 10 of his last 11 but still managed to pick the wrong one. At the end of an otherwise triumphant meeting, when her six winners made her the first female to finish the week as leading rider, the biggest prize of all was the one that got away.       11.24am    Barry Glendenning, an Irishman no less, sampled the good stuff on St Patrick\u2019s Day at Prestbury Park.   Any prospective Irish St Patrick\u2019s Day clean sweep came quickly unstuck, when Third Wind, out of Hughie Morrison\u2019s decidedly English East Ilsley yard, led home a British one-two-three in the Pertemps Handicap Hurdle. An unfancied 25-1 shot, his victory prompted polite but unenthusiastic applause from the grandstand and a deluge of discarded betting slips but little or nothing in the way of bombastic Last Night At The Proms\u2019s style patriotic fervour. As if to confirm the hoary old saw that nobody anywhere knows anything, he was the first of four British winners on the day.       11.16am    And good morning from the bunker where I am taking over after Niall\u2019s two excellent days in the saddle. I have barely dried up since attending Champion Chase day (see photo) and being able to see only a couple of races because of the rain and all the umbrellas in the way. It was brutal, it was attritional, it was good to be back.  It\u2019s been a great three days\u2019 racing with yesterday no exception with that Stayers\u2019 Hurdle win for Flooring Porter, and the brilliance of Allaho in the Ryanair Chase. Perhaps though Thursday will be best recalled for Galopin Des Champs\u2019s fall in the novice chase at the start of the day. He\u2019ll be back, hopefully, and perhaps in next year\u2019s Gold Cup. This year\u2019s looks a highly open race, with defending champion Minella Indo standing his ground, A Plus Tard trying to go one better than last year, Al Boum Photo trying to win a third Gold Cup. and Galvin carrying the hopes of many a shrewdie from Ireland. There\u2019s also a classic Venetia Williams plot in Royale Pagaille, who ran in last year\u2019s race as a novice and suffered some poor luck in running.  And before and after that, too, more top-level National Hunt racing, and here to guide you through them.    Updated at 11.21am GMT    11.00am   Preamble  Good morning from Cheltenham, where the sun is starting to break through after a misty start to the day and the course looks magnificent ahead of one of the great days in this, or any other, sport. It is like racing\u2019s final round at Augusta National, the culmination of a week that has been circled on many fans\u2019 calendars since they fell through their front door after the last one, and the Gold Cup (3.30pm) itself looks sure to be the perfect centrepiece for the final-day card.  Jon Pullin, the clerk of the course reported this morning that the going has improved to good-to-soft, soft in places, which is just about perfect jump racing ground but could mean that Galvin\u2019s bottomless stamina is not quite as significant as it might have been. \u201cWe had a dry day yesterday so the ground\u2019s dried up a bit,\u201d Pullin said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a dry day ahead with bright sunshine and temperatures around 14 or 15C.\u201d  Galvin was the narrow favourite for the Gold Cup yesterday evening but as expected, the money has started to arrive for Rachael Blackmore\u2019s mount, A Plus Tard, and he now heads the market at 11-4 with Galvin, a proven stayer who won the three-and-three-quarter mile National Hunt Chase here last season, out to 4-1 and Minella Indo - last year\u2019s Gold Cup winner and the horse that Blackmore rejected \u2013 on offer at around 6-1.   That\u2019s the pick of the prices for me, given Minella Indo\u2019s exceptional record at this track, with two Festival wins already, and I\u2019m willing to overlook his patchy record since last year\u2019s victory as his win 12 months ago remains the best piece of form on offer and he seems to come alive in the spring. Protektorat is the shortest-priced runner from a British yard and a win for Dan Skelton\u2019s runner would round off a much better week than anticipated for the home team.  The card is under way at 1.30pm with the Triumph Hurdle, while Paul Townend goes into the final afternoon with a one-win lead in the race to be leading rider. He has three winners this week, while Blackmore, Nico de Boinville and Patrick Mullins all have two.  Willie Mullins, meanwhile, looks home and hosed in the trainers\u2019 race with five wins, three more than Gordon Elliott, Nicky Henderson, Henry de Bromhead and Venetia Williams, but Elliott in particular has several well-fancied runners today and could yet make a race of it should either Pied Piper or Fil Dor land the opener.  The last of the mist has just left the top of Cleeve Hill, and a wonderful afternoon of racing awaits. Good luck to all!  "

                    "body": "Up in the posh seats, one extremely astute judge of talent was watching with interest. Chelsea were taking on Al-Hilal in the semi-finals of the Club World Cup and, as far as Ars\u00e8ne Wenger was concerned, the chance to have a close look at Kai Havertz was not to be missed. For those near Wenger at the Mohammed Bin Zayed Stadium, it was impossible not to notice how much the former Arsenal manager appreciated Havertz\u2019s game: the elusive movement, the way he kept popping up in unexpected positions, the sense that the Chelsea attacker was always on the verge of producing something special.  But it never quite happened for the young German. When he charged down the left and lifted a cross into the area in the 32nd minute, it required a defensive mix-up from Al-Hilal to gift Romelu Lukaku the winning goal. Then, when the former Bayer Leveruksen player tore through midway through the second half, he hit the post when he had the chance to score a magnificent solo goal. It was another one of those nearly moments from Havertz. Sometimes it seems his curse is almost scoring great goals. He can be indulgent with his finishing and for all his elegant movement there are times when he seems reluctant to push the limits, which has stopped him becoming a more dominant figure for Chelsea. Nonetheless the depth of Havertz\u2019s ability is obvious. Wenger glimpsed it from afar and Thomas Tuchel has seen it up close. So, too, have Havertz\u2019s Chelsea teammates. They had faith even when he was struggling to adapt to English football last season. Seasoned players saw in training that Havertz was capable of moments of individual brilliance. Yet he remains a work in progress: a \u00a362m star who finds himself in the weird position of having secured his place in Chelsea\u2019s history, only to find that nobody is quite sure whether he is going to make the most of his vast potential. Havertz\u2019s time at Chelsea has not been spectacular, but it has been special. It is not clear whether he is best as a false nine or a classic No 10. But what do you focus on more? The disappointment of six goals in 44 league appearances or the glory of scoring the winner against Manchester City in last season\u2019s Champions League final? An inability to become a mandatory pick or the nerveless penalty that saw off Palmeiras when Chelsea became world champions for the first time this month?  \u201cTwo seconds in one year maybe changed the whole year for me,\u201d Havertz says of the Champions League final goal. \u201cSmall things can turn everything around. If I had not scored that goal, everyone would say it had been a disaster of a first season for me. I would not say that to myself because I was 21 when I came here and at this age it\u2019s not easy to change everything. It can take one, two or three years to adapt. I think this goal helped me a lot. Now for you guys, for the fans, all in all it was a good first season for me but overall I was not happy.\u201d The positive take is that Havertz, now 22, thrives under pressure. Based on his big-game record, he should be in his element when Chelsea face Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final. Havertz has scored against J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side this season \u2013 a clever header in front of the Kop last August \u2013 and Chelsea are more fluid and aggressive when he is up front instead of Lukaku, who was dropped against Lille last Tuesday. \u201cI am now at an age where I have to prove it,\u201d Havertz says. \u201cI\u2019m not a talent any more. I played now five years on a good level and I showed in the past that I can score a lot of goals in a season. But I\u2019m a little bit disappointed with my Premier League statistics this year. I want to get better. I know I am not a real No 9. I know I am not just in the box and waiting for the ball for a header. I want to have influence on the game, to have the ball to maybe drop back into the midfield and start the attack.\u201d Havertz took his chance against Lille. He pressed energetically, moved cleverly, linked the play and scored a good goal, so there is little reason for Tuchel to restore Lukaku to the lineup on Sunday. However Havertz\u2019s inconsistency means there are no guarantees he will rise to the occasion. He has not developed the relentlessness of Liverpool\u2019s Mohamed Salah, whose productivity puts Chelsea\u2019s misfiring forwards to shame. This could be a galling experience for the Chelsea hierarchy. They have decent attacking players, but none belong to the elite. There is, as one staff member privately acknowledged this season, nobody in the class of Salah or Manchester City\u2019s Kevin De Bruyne. That, of course, is on Chelsea. \u201cThanks, Jos\u00e9!\u201d was how one figure put it recently, pointing out that Mourinho, during his second spell at Stamford Bridge, sold two players who are now among the Premier League\u2019s best.  Salah was 21 when Chelsea signed him from Basel in 2014. The Egyptian was exciting but Mourinho did not take to him or De Bruyne. Both were banished to the sidelines and players from that era remember feeling embarrassed by Mourinho\u2019s treatment of Salah. Chelsea cannot head down that path again. This is the first time they will have faced Salah in a major final and one look at him in a red shirt should be enough to convince them not to let Liverpool profit from their impatience again. Too many expensive forwards are underperforming at Chelsea and it is not a surprise that some have grown unhappy. It is not only about Lukaku, who is probably going nowhere given that he cost \u00a397.5m last summer. Tuchel also has to think about Timo Werner, who would probably benefit from a change of scenery, and there could be another difficult conversation if Christian Pulisic wants to leave.  Pulisic, under contract until 2024, could well turn out to be another Salah. The 23-year-old has not lived up to the hype since his \u00a358m move from Borussia Dortmund in 2019 but he is not a lost cause. The American is a dynamic threat when confident and his goal against Lille, who could not handle his speed and directness, was a reminder of what he can do when fully fit. These are complicated times for Chelsea. The summer could bring change but the memory of losing Salah and De Bruyne adds a layer of intrigue to the decision-making process. It is a cautionary tale; one that tells Chelsea it would be wise to give Havertz room to grow. He has not pushed on as expected after his heroics against City last May, but he is heading in the right direction. After all, one of the reasons Chelsea have made it to Wembley is because of Havertz scoring in the semi-final against Tottenham. Maybe Wenger still knows."

                    "body": "The NHL playoffs begin Monday evening after the first complete season since 2018-19. What stories will unfold over the coming weeks?  The Florida Panthers aren\u2019t there yet In the NHL\u2019s post-lockout era, the Presidents\u2019 Trophy winner \u2013 the best team through the regular season \u2013 has rarely gone on to win the Stanley Cup. It\u2019s happened just twice \u2013 to the 2008 Detroit Red Wings and the 2013 Chicago Blackhawks, both of which were arguably near or at the height of their powers when they did it. The Florida Panthers, this year\u2019s Presidents\u2019 Trophy winners, are a very good team. But they\u2019re not the \u201908 Wings or the \u201913 Blackhawks. On paper, the Panthers cruised through the season \u2013 their longest losing streak was just four games \u2013 not just routinely out-scoring other teams, but trouncing them. But all that hid some issues. They leave seams defensively. They\u2019re middling on the penalty kill. They get scored on short-handed. As for goaltending? Sergei Bobrovsky can shine, but his season goals-against average (GAA) was a 2.67, putting him behind some of his playoff peers. And he\u2019s struggled in previous postseasons, posting a 3.24 GAA and just a .899 save percentage over his playoff career. The Panthers can be beaten. The Toronto Maple Leafs have a lot to prove The Leafs dropped out of the playoffs in the first round last year in brutal fashion, losing four 4-3 to the Montreal Canadiens after fumbling a 3-1 series lead. The embarrassing finish was made worse by the fact that the Canadiens solved Auston Matthews and his line-mate Mitch Marner, holding them both to only one goal and nine points total over seven games. Things feel different this regular season, but will there be a different outcome? Matthews made Leaf history by becoming the first to notch 60 goals in a season, all while improving his play at both ends of the ice. Marner\u2019s skating has become mesmerising, his passing often unrivalled. But can they \u2013 and rookie line-mate Michael Bunting \u2013 lead the Leafs into the second round \u2026 or further? It feels like now or never for this Leafs team and its management. Can Connor McDavid lift the curse? On the other side of the league, another superstar waits for playoff success. Back in January, amid their second six-game losing streak in only 35 games, the Oilers were declared to be \u201cjust too easy to play against.\u201d Why? \u201cThey aren\u2019t deep enough, their goaltending is lousy\u201d and they had \u201ctoo many phonies.\u201d Now? The phonies are gone \u2013 or maybe just fired. Since ditching head coach Dave Tippett in February, replacing him with Jay Woodcroft, the Oilers have looked much different. Between 1 March and 29 April, the Oilers went 20-6\u20133. McDavid will finish the year as the NHL\u2019s top points-getter by a decent margin, with his linemate Leon Draisaitl not far behind. Goaltending has improved, led by 40-year-old Mike Smith. But the playoffs have been tough for Smith in the past. And how ready are the rest of the Oilers for the likes of Colorado, Calgary, St. Louis or Minnesota? Tampa Bay: Still great or just good? The Lightning are already in rare company as back-to-back Stanley Cup winners. Only seven other teams have managed to do it. But, fittingly, only three teams have managed a three-peat: the Montreal Canadiens, the Toronto Maple Leafs, and most recently, the New York Islanders \u2013 39 years ago. The Lightning had a good season, but not a great one. Against top challengers like Florida and Toronto results were mixed, with the Lightning winning and losing in equal parts, often by large margins in both cases. Andrei Vasilevskiy, the best goalie in the league for years, was mostly just good enough (his title may now belong to the New York Rangers\u2019 Igor Shesterkin). They won \u2013 enough. They were deep \u2013 enough. A few weeks ago, the feeling was that Tampa might be spent. But heading into the playoffs, they\u2019re looking better. They went 7-3 to close the season (although their final loss was to, uh, Columbus\u2026). Vasilevskiy looks (mostly) back on form. Steve Stamkos posted 106 points this season. They could do it, but the route is tough, via not only the Panthers, but perhaps the Carolina Hurricanes or the Rangers, too. Watch the West As has been typical in the post-lockout era, the Western Conference playoff race will be a series of knife fights \u2013 exhausting, close-range combat where nobody will get out clean. With the Las Vegas Golden Knights out of the postseason this year, there are four teams capable of filling the void they\u2019ve left open. The St Louis Blues were the last team to win the Stanley Cup before the Lightning\u2019s double. The Blues had a mixed season prior to the all-star break and were rocky through most of March, raising questions about playoff viability. April changed that. From 28 March through 26 April, the Blues lost only three games. Two of those were in overtime and the other was to the Colorado Avalanche, the best team in the West. With three lines scoring and defence looking good, St Louis are rolling. Speaking of the Avalanche, despite losing four straight in mid-April, the rest of Colorado\u2019s season has been near-perfect, including a January in which they lost only one game \u2013 in overtime. They might not be the strongest team hitting the playoffs, but as one of only two with more than 55 wins in the NHL this year (the other being Florida), to discount them would be a grave error. As Flames coach Darryl Sutter put it, playing the Avalanche in the postseason might just be \u201ca waste of eight days.\u201d Sutter\u2019s Calgary Flames have to be pleased with a season of consistent positive play. The Flames had three 40+ goalscorers (Lindholm, Tkachuk, and Gaudreau), solid goalkeeping led by Jacob Markstr\u00f6m, and are a significant threat in the postseason. If it weren\u2019t for a couple other western teams like Colorado and Minnesota, the Flames might be seriously considered to take it all \u2013 the probability simulator at MoneyPuck.com figures they stand a good chance, anyway. Hardly a dark horse. The Minnesota Wild struggled through February and the first half of March (including losses to the likes of lowly Ottawa and Buffalo) but they hit a stride in the final weeks of the season, not long after they picked up veteran goaltender (and three-time Cup winner) Marc-Andre Fleury. Coincidence? Maybe. Or perhaps that success has something to do with the fact that the Wild can score \u2013 a lot. They\u2019re in tough against the Blues in round one, but if they can squeeze through, they may see a path open up. Predictions West: My gut says we\u2019ll see a Calgary-St Louis matchup in the Western Conference final, but my brain says it\u2019s more likely to be a Calgary-Colorado one, with Colorado likely to make it through, though not undamaged. East: I think Tampa will have another visit to the conference final, where they could meet the Carolina Hurricanes. The teams met three times this season and Carolina won twice, but playoff Tampa Bay is different \u2013 they might still have the edge. Final: I guess the Avalanche could play Tampa Bay? In which case, it feels like the Avalanche are due."

                    "body": "Baggage handlers filmed throwing luggage and slamming bags onto a conveyor belt at Melbourne airport have been immediately stood down pending an investigation. The minute-long footage, reportedly filmed at Melbourne airport, shows baggage handlers deliberately slamming luggage into a conveyor belt, throwing suitcases high into the air, and hurling one bag so forcefully it falls off the conveyor belt altogether. The three men, in hi-vis jackets, are unloading a Qantas-branded luggage container. They can be seen smiling as they throw luggage on to the conveyor belt.  Amid outrage online, the footage has been set to the song I Still Call Australia Home, which is used by Qantas in its advertising campaigns. The men are employees of Qantas subcontractor Swissport, which Qantas uses to perform \u201cground handling services\u201d at Melbourne airport. \u201cThe behaviour in this video is clearly not acceptable, and our contracted ground handler is conducting an urgent investigation,\u201d a Qantas spokesperson told the Guardian. The Guardian understands the men will not work on Qantas flights again.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  A spokesperson for Swissport said: \u201cSwissport trains and manages all staff to handle customer possessions with care and diligence. \u201cThe actions of staff in the video appear to have contravened those service level standards. \u201cAs a result, the staff in question have been stood down pending an urgent investigation.\u201d The Swissport chief executive, Brad Moore, wrote to staff saying \u201cthe behaviours in the video let all of us down\u201d. \u201cDisrespectful behaviour to our customer luggage and personal effects will not be tolerated and will result in serious disciplinary action. \u201cRest assured this matter will be investigated with urgency with appropriate follow-up action. The unacceptable behaviour of a few individuals will not go unchecked nor be allowed to tarnish the quality work of our whole team.\u201d Qantas\u2019s workplace practices with baggage handling has been the subject of significant controversy. In 2021 the company moved to outsource ground handling operations at 10 Australian airports, including Melbourne, resulting in 2,000 roles being made redundant. The federal court ruled Qantas\u2019s actions were illegal, and the Transport Workers Union, representing the workers, is seeking compensation for those who lost their jobs. Qantas has appealed the decision to the high court. Qantas has suffered a turbulent year emerging from the Covid-19 pandemic, with flights plagued by delays, cancellations and incidents of baggage loss and mishandling. The airline was the subject of a Four Corners investigation earlier this year, which focused on an alleged high-pressure and divisive work culture and corporate cost-cutting practices. Qantas was also awarded a Shonky award this year by consumer watchdog group Choice for its poor customer service. The airline has returned to profitability, telling the market in an October trading update it expected to post a profit between $1.2bn and $1.3bn for the first half of this financial year. It said on-time performance had improved, while remaining below its 75% target, and cancellations and mishandled baggage rates had diminished. The chief executive, Alan Joyce, took home $2.27m in pay last financial year, boosted by bonus performance rights \u2013 voted by shareholders \u2013 of about $4m."

Gareth Taylor\u2019s side have rounded into form at the right time and could be on for domestic cup double after claiming the Continental Cup in March. City\u2019s strength in depth ultimately proved too much for West Ham, who worked hard but did not have the quality to make it count in the end.     2.22pm   Kelly speaks!  \u201cIt\u2019s brilliant to be back out there with the girls and to get the goal is even better. The team were brilliant today and throughout my whole injury they\u2019ve been brilliant. The manager showed his faith in me and it\u2019s time to repay that faith.  \u201cThe time I spent away from [the game] it\u2019s a difficult period and so lonely, on my own in the gym each day. To get back on the pitch and get a goal is brilliant for me. you just grow in confidence once you get that goal. It\u2019s great to be out there and I\u2019m just loving every minute of being back on the pitch with these girls.\u201d     2.10pm   Full time: West Ham 1-4 Manchester City  City are though to another Women\u2019s FA Cup final!     2.08pm   Goal! West Ham 1-4 Manchester City (Hemp 92)  Hemp caps off a swift counter to grab her second of the game. City have deserved it for this second half display. West Ham just run out of steam.   Updated at 2.12pm BST    2.06pm    91 min: Four minutes added.     2.05pm    89 min: Now it is Stanway who forces Arnold into action. The West Mam stopper makes another smart save to turn away the shot from distance.      2.03pm    86 min: Angeldahl nearly makes it 4-1 after being slipped in by Walsh but Arnold turns the Swede\u2019s effort on to the bar. From the resulting corner Arnold makes another smart save as Kennedy tries an overhead kick.     2.01pm    85 min: This game is petering out now. City very much in control, with Walsh and Bronze controlling the game.     1.56pm    80 min: Filippa Angeldahl comes on for City, replacing Coombs.     1.54pm    77 min: Svitkov\u00e1 is found by Evans in the box and the Czech international strikes with power but it is straight at Roebuck for a routine save. West Ham have not given up but they probably needed that go in.     1.49pm    73 min: Another sloppy giveaway by West Ham, this time from Arnold, but Raso rushes her shot and it is no danger in the end.     1.48pm    71 min: Changes for both sides. Yallop is replaced by Emma Snerle for West Ham. Double change for City as Georgia Stanway and Bunny Shaw come on for Caroline Weir and Ellen White come off.     1.46pm    70 min: Lovely ball from Bronze, who dinks a pass into the path of substitute Hayley Raso. Flaherty comes across to make the last-ditch tackle.     1.43pm   Goal! West Ham 1-3 Manchester City (Hemp 67)  That could be the tie. City turn the ball over in the final third and Lauren Hemp is the beneficiary as she fires across Arnold in the West Ham goal and in off the right post. Great strike. Clinical from City.   Updated at 1.49pm BST    1.42pm    65 min: Classy stuff from Walsh in her own box as West Ham players converge. The midfielder step away from a couple of challenges to clear after Brynjarsd\u00f3ttir\u2019s had jinked her way into the box.     1.39pm    62 min: Couple of chances for West Ham and it is Lisa Evans who is causing the problems for City. Yallop is so close to an equaliser as Evans slips her in but on the stretch the winger cannot get her effort on target.      1.37pm    60 min: Changes afoot for City. Kelly might be about to come off but she\u2019s looked very bright as she continues her comeback from her ACL injury.     1.32pm    55 min: This is a compelling watch at the moment. City making all the running but West Ham working so hard to keep the visitors at bay. You do wonder how long this pattern of play is sustainable.     1.30pm    54 min: Lovely outside of the boot cross from Kelly sees two City players flailing to get on the end of it but neither White nor Hemp can get a meaningful touch.     1.28pm    52 min: White thinks she has her second as Walsh clips in a cute ball but the striker is just beyond the last defender and the flag goes up.     1.26pm    49 min: West Ham continue to press when they get an opportunity and force a couple of half-openings as they win the ball in City\u2019s half. There is a bit of a lack of quality when the home side manage a turnover so far. Encouraging signs nonetheless.     1.20pm   Second half: West Ham 1-2 Manchester City  46 min: City kick off the second half.     1.06pm   Half time: West Ham 1-2 Manchester City  City back on top as the half ends but West Ham will be pleased with their goal to get back in the game just before the break. Tie very much on in the second half.     1.03pm    45 min: All of a sudden West Ham look like the side from the game\u2019s opening stages, playing with a bit more confidence and purpose. Two minutes added on.     1.00pm   Goal! West Ham 1-2 Manchester City (Evans 41)  West Ham are back in it! It is a great piece of play from Leon to slip in Lisa Evans behind the City back line. Coming in from the right, Evans get to the ball ahead of Roebuck and keeps her composure to slot the ball into an unguarded net.   Updated at 1.06pm BST    12.57pm   Goal! West Ham 0-2 Manchester City (Kelly 37)  Disaster for Flaherty. The defender\u2019s loose pass across her own 18-yard box is easily intercepted by Kelly and the City forward makes no mistake with the finish. Those are the kind of sloppy errors that West Ham just cannot afford to make when playing team\u2019s of this quality. Real shame.   Updated at 1.01pm BST    12.51pm    33 min: West Ham having to work very hard as City keep the ball. It feels vital they get through this period without conceding to keep their hopes of an upset alive.     12.48pm    29 min: Weir releases White in behind and Flaherty has to make an inch perfect tackle in the box to deny the England forward a chance to double the lead.     12.46pm    27 min: Hemp bursts into the box and fires a shot just over. City piling on the pressure now.     12.45pm    26 min: Now it looks an uphill task for West Ham. All of a sudden City look confident and the home side cannot get a sniff of the ball. City think they have a second as Bronze gets to the byline and finds White with a cross, but the assistant rules the ball had gone out of play.   Updated at 12.45pm BST    12.41pm   Goal! West Ham 0-1 Manchester City (White 21)  Keira Walsh smashes an tracer bullet effort against the bar from all of 25 yards and White gets to the rebound first to give City the lead, a classic poachers goal.   Updated at 12.45pm BST    12.39pm    19 mins: City are being forced to go long in the face of a high West Ham press. Lauren Hemp picks up one of these searching balls and beats a couple of West Ham defenders before Gilly Flaherty steps across to deal with the situation. It looks a bit clumsy but any shouts for a penalty are quickly dismissed.     12.34pm    16 min: First bit of sustained pressure from City as they pop the ball around in the final third, eventually it comes to Weir who fires a shot just past the post from the edge of the area via a deflection. West Ham deal with the corner.     12.32pm    13 min: Lisa Evans and Brynjarsd\u00f3ttir combine a big chance for West Ham as Greenwood gives the ball away in midfield. The Icelandic international has the opportunity to shoot when the ball breaks her way but Roebuck is out quickly to close down the angle. Real let-off.     12.29pm    11 min: West Ham are really trying to stretch the game and get down the flanks. Ellie Roebuck has to be sharp to cut out a cross from Tameka Yallop from the left.     12.27pm    9 min: Dagn\u00fd Brynjarsd\u00f3ttir receives some treatment for a knock.     12.25pm    6 min: Chance for White as she strains to reach a cross from Caroline Weir on the right but the England striker cannot connect with a diving header from inside the six-yard box.     12.23pm    4 min: City try to bring the ball down and get playing but West Ham are doing a good job of pressing high. Kennedy and Greenwood are happy to play it around at the back in search of an opening.     12.20pm    2 min: West Ham make a bright start and win a free kick on the right-hand side which Adriana Leon drifts in. There is a bit of jumble in the box but White eventually clears for City.     12.17pm   We are underway...  1 min: The players walk out into the sunshine at the Chigwell Construction Stadium to loud cheers from the main stand. West Ham win the toss and kick off.     12.12pm         11.58am    Harder makes one change for West Ham as defender Hawa Cissoko is benched in favour of Katerina Svitkov\u00e1. The Czech Republic international has been one of the Irons\u2019 major goal threats this this season, with three assists and two goals. Pre-match doubts for City, Alex Greenwood and Alanna Kennedy are both fit enough to start. Ten-goal pair Chloe Kelly and Ellen White come back into side, as does Laura Coombs. Georgia Stanway, Khadija Shaw and Hayley Raso all make way.     11.51am   The teams  West Ham (3-5-2): Arnold, Fisk, Flaherty, Parker, Longhurst, Hasegawa, Brynjarsd\u00f3ttir, Evans, Svitkov\u00e1, Yallop, Leon  Subs: Wyne, Stringer, Snerle, Walker, Filis, Joel, Cissoko, Moore, Houssein Manchester City (4-3-3): Roebuck, Bronze, Kennedy, Greenwood, Stokes, Walsh, Coombs, Weir, Kelly, Hemp, White Subs: Keating, Taieb, Shaw, Angeldahl, Stanway, Mace, Raso, Benameur     11.42am         11.38am   Preamble  Manchester City go into this semi-final as heavy favourites but know that to progress they must overcome one of just a handful of teams to beat them on the domestic front this season. West Ham, now well-established in the Women\u2019s Super League, were 2-0 victors at the Academy Stadium back in October as Gareth Taylor\u2019s side struggled to find their feet early in the season. City are on more of an upward curve now, with five wins in their last five outings in league and cup. One of those was a 2-0 victory at West Ham in their last WSL match earlier this month. However, Irons head coach Olli Harder has primed his side to put up a defensive wall at the Chigwell Construction Stadium as he bids to continue what he describes as West Ham\u2019s \u201cfantastic story\u201d in this season\u2019s Women\u2019s FA Cup. It is the first time in this season\u2019s competition that West Ham will have the backing of their home fans, with each of their three wins so far coming on the road. Should West Ham cause an upset and reach the final it will be the second time in the last four seasons that they have reached the final. The last time resulted in a 3-0 defeat at Wembley to - you guessed it - Manchester City.  "

                    "body": "A bonfire of EU shibboleths on the economy, conflict, finance, energy supply, migration, and even the bloc\u2019s future shape and size, has been lit by the conflict raging in Ukraine.\nBattlefield images, the leadership of Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who has framed the war as being between European democracy and brute bullying power, and the challenge of coordinating with UK and US allies who are pushing for more while having less to lose, has created a new political necessity.\nThe standard rational actor analysis of economic interests has gone by the wayside. And while during normal times, the EU\u2019s deep economic ties with Russia had been a liability, with countries fearful of upsetting the Kremlin, those ties now offer leverage unmatched anywhere else in the world.\n\nAnd the EU is going all in. By cutting off Russian banks from the Swift payments system, not only is the country\u2019s industrial base losing access to foreign currency but Russian citizens\u2019 individual credit card transactions are blocked.\nCombined with freezing most of Russia\u2019s foreign exchange reserves, the EU has made a political decision to force a deep recession on the Russian economy, with the hurt and pain that will be felt by Europeans as a result becoming a political irrelevance. Sacred cow No 1 slain.\nBut so much more has followed. The EU will ask states to grant asylum to Ukrainian refugees for up to three years, using a legal instrument that exists but which has never been triggered. Countries who have baulked at taking in refugees have opened up their borders. So much for sacred cow No 2.\nThis is no act of universal humanism, as those from Afghanistan and elsewhere who have been seeking to cross from Ukraine within the general population have discovered. But the decision has wider consequences.\nWith large numbers of Ukrainians settling in EU member states, there will be a new familiarity with the people of that country, while those who may later complain of overcrowding will be under obligation to help rebuild Ukraine as a place to which the displaced will want to return.\nEU officials say they expect Ukraine\u2019s application for EU membership \u201cimminently\u201d. There is an expectation that the process of accession will be sped up. Croatia was the last country to join the EU in 2013 and there has been little appetite to open up again. Sacred cow No 3 is on its way out.\nThen there is the EU\u2019s arrival on the scene as a funder of lethal weaponry for a nation at war, a \u201cquantum leap\u201d beyond anything we have seen\u201d, said Jacob Kirkegaard, senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund.\nIn Germany, the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, abandoned the country\u2019s postwar approach to conflict by announcing \u20ac100bn (\u00a383.7bn) Sonderverm\u00f6gen (special assets) to rearm.\nSince Ostpolitik, the normalisation of relations between then West Germany and the east, policy has been predicated upon Russia being a status quo power, not an imperialist one. Berlin\u2019s mercantilist approach had to go, along with sacred cow No 4.\nAsked as to the turning point in EU thinking, officials point to an \u201chistoric\u201d intervention by Zelenskiy last Thursday evening.\nSitting around the leaders\u2019 table in the Europa building in Brussels at about 8pm, the 27 heads of state and government had been ready to agree a set of strong sanctions on Russia.\nThere had been calls for more drastic action in the face the extraordinary scenes developing in Ukraine but on his arrival, Scholz told reporters that he preferred to be cautious.\nA couple of hours later and Zelenskiy, speaking from Kyiv via videocall to the assembled leaders, changed everything.\n\u201cIt was an incredibly emotional intervention,\u201d said one of those present. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t mean by that President Zelenskiy lost his control if you like. It was incredibly professional.\n\u201cHe spoke about how he was the No 1 target for Russia, and that he felt this may well be the last time that he would be able to speak personally to many of the leaders.\n\u201cHe spoke about the threat his own family faced. And I think that focused minds and, in my humble opinion, it was a historic moment.\u201d\nThere is a step further to go. Europe remains reliant on Russian gas. But EU officials say watch this space. In January, the record was broken for deliveries of liquified natural gas and more is on its way, with discussions with Japan and Korea about redirecting deliveries from Qatar ongoing. Ursula von der Leyen has said there is sufficient gas stored to get through the winter.\nIf the last week has shown anything, it is that turning off the Russian pipes will not be seen as a sacred cow too far."

                    "body": "And then there were none. Racing 92\u2019s rock stars may have turned up fashionably late to the party but ultimately they sprinkled more than enough stardust to sink Sale Sharks and ensure there will be no Premiership sides in the Champions Cup semi-finals for the second season running. Finn Russell\u2019s inspired piece of improvisation \u2013 twice kicking the ball to the line before dotting down \u2013 came soon after a similarly stunning piece of skill from Teddy Thomas and swung the tie in Racing\u2019s favour. They were the standout moments from a side who have yet to utterly convince that this will be their year but who possess an ability to strike that Sale can only dream of. It helps, too, to have a 19-year-old scrum-half who possesses as much class as Nolann Le Garrec.  With the Premiership\u2019s salary cap coming down, clubs have had to cut their cloth accordingly and the gulf between English sides and the continental European elite is likely to get wider. Like Leicester on Saturday, Sale cannot be faulted for their efforts but while the Premiership produced four of the five winners of this tournament before this lean spell began, it is hard to predict when their next success will come. For once Racing had their dander up, Juan Imhoff and Max Spring added scintillating finishes to underline the superior scoring ability at their disposal. Compounding matters for the visitors, Tom Curry, making his first start since suffering a hamstring injury during the Six Nations, limped off after 55 minutes with an ankle problem. Sale, as you\u2019d expect, left everything on the pitch. They defended with a resilience, particularly in a first half that made you wonder whether they might just claim a first win in the competition on French soil in 11 matches. They took the lead into the interval thanks to an opportune score from Manu Tuilagi and demonstrated unwavering commitment throughout. Unfortunately, it was an all too familiar tale, an eerily similar outcome to last season\u2019s quarter-final exit at the hands of La Rochelle \u2013 Racing\u2019s last-four opponents next Sunday in Lens. \u201cWe need to get better,\u201d said Sale\u2019s director of rugby Alex Sanderson. \u201cI believe we can and we will get better. We\u2019ve got a taste for it now. The boys like the taste. I\u2019m pretty certain it won\u2019t be the last time we\u2019re into these kinds of occasions. You have to experience it, lose and come back that little bit stronger.\u201d  What was, in truth, a pretty dreadful first half came to life in the final minute when a wayward pass from De Klerk went to ground behind Tuilagi, who gathered, spun, spotted a gap left by overzealous Racing defenders and breezed under the posts. Sale deserved their lead given their defensive performance hitherto. De Klerk thundering into Camille Chat and driving him backwards was just one of countless tackles that left their mark and barring the odd dart from Le Garrec, Racing had rarely threatened. Le Garrec had notched two penalties to Rob du Preez\u2019s one but with Bevan Rodd and Nick Schonert giving Sale ascendancy at the scrum and Tom Curry ensuring the visitors gave as good as they got at the breakdown, Racing could find little of the rhythm that can make them so dangerous. That said, Racing began the second half in a significantly higher gear. Russell\u2019s diagonal grubber was gathered by Thomas, who did superbly well not to breach the right-hand touchline with his foot. He did even better to kick the ball in mid-air and race ahead to score.  Le Garrec added another penalty before an overcooked Sale grubber came Russell\u2019s way inside his own half. He hacked skyward on the half-volley, chased his kick and the bounce was desperately cruel on AJ MacGinty, perfect for Russell to kick again before rounding off a score that brought a trademark grin from the Scotland fly-half. He was still wearing it when insisting it was entirely deliberate but players like Russell have a habit of conjuring these moments. To their credit, Sale rallied and came back within a score after a close-range try from Akker van der Merwe before Imhoff dashed over on the left two more penalties from Le Garrec. Still Sale came again, Ben Curry going over at the back of the driving maul, but Spring\u2019s score came with MacGinty in the sin-bin and after Racing had sliced the Sharks open with a ruthlessness that gave the English side a glimpse of just how much more they must improve to triumph in encounters such as these."

                    "body": "Tim McClelland is one of a number of Australian farmers being forced to rethink the way he operates this year, placing greater reliance on soil science technology in the wake of soaring fertiliser prices. McClelland, a mixed farmer based in north-western Victoria, is currently paying $1,100 a tonne for fertiliser, up from $650 in 2021, as the rising cost of energy leads to record prices. While McClelland has always depended on the results of soil sampling to apply variable rates of fertiliser across his farm, the price squeeze makes it more important than ever to use the nutrient judiciously. In previous years he tested half the soil zones in his farm, but this year he has tested almost all of them.  \u201c[Soil sampling] tells us how much nitrogen phosphorous we had in our soil at the start of the year, which then makes it easier for us to match our supply to our demand,\u201d he said. Fertiliser is one of a number of imports causing farmers financial pain, despite projections of a bumper season. Andrew Whitelaw, an agricultural market analyst at Thomas Elder Markets, said the latest fertiliser prices of $960 a tonne are more than double the average price of $405 between 2017 and 2020. Whitelaw said farmers can use less fertiliser if they employ technologies which help them be more prescriptive in its application. While a lot of farmers already used soil sampling, the fertiliser prices are making the practice more refined in a trend that will likely continue, even once fertiliser prices drop again, said Whitelaw. According to Cheryl Kalisch Gordon, commodities analyst at Rabobank, Australian farmers use 6-7m tonnes of fertiliser each year, with the usage of some fertilisers forecast to increase due to the nation\u2019s growing agricultural production.  Kalisch Gordon said Australia\u2019s supply was particularly exposed to the international market, with a heavy reliance on foreign importation. Australia imports 100% of its potassium \u2013 one of the nutrients in fertiliser \u2013 from the US, Canada and Belarus, but imports from Belarus are currently impossible due to the war in Ukraine. Australia also imports 93% of its urea, which primarily comes from Qatar, Saudi Arabia and China. Kalisch Gordon said this supply is also strained due to China\u2019s export bans to secure its domestic supplies. More considered application of fertiliser use comes as experts highlight the need to tackle the global mismanagement of phosphorous \u2013 another vital ingredient in fertiliser \u2013 in the most detailed report yet on the phosphorus problem. Bryan Spears, professor at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology and a lead author of the report, said \u201cphosphorus could push us to the brink of a food security crisis. It is a finite resource, and it is overused in developed countries, while developing countries do not have enough.\u201d  Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter   McClelland said nitrogen bank numbers are designed to help farmers achieve 80% production potential, which is the maximum yield possible, given the other 20% will be affected by factors beyond farmers\u2019 control such as frost, insects and weeds. McClelland said the testing had not necessarily saved fertiliser, but \u201ccertainly helped\u201d redistribute the fertilisers from areas that didn\u2019t need it to areas which did.  He said his farm was using less fertiliser than last year because he had deliberately planted more paddocks of pulses such as lentils, which require less fertiliser. Justin Everitt, the chair of the New South Wales Farmers Grains Committee, said he expected the practice of grid sampling, more in-depth soil tests and variable mapping to be \u201cwildly up\u201d. Everitt said farmers also need fertiliser to take advantage of the good seasonal conditions. \u201cThe problem is, we\u2019re having such a good year, as far as rainfall goes. \u201cThe potential for a good crop meaning that we\u2019re just going to have to suck these prices up and continue on as normal,\u201d Everitt said. Prof Michael McLaughlin, director of the Fertiliser Technology Research Centre at the University of Adelaide, said high prices often push farmers to improve their efficiency, but there was a danger when prices are so high that farmers start to look for alternatives, which are cheaper but not as effective. Traditional alternative products such as animal waste and compost are viable for home gardens, McLaughlin said, but logistically not possible when 30,000 hectares needed to be sown within a few weeks. Everitt said fertiliser prices had taken a \u201cmassive hit\u201d out of last year\u2019s bumper crop, the savings from which would normally have been put away for poorer seasons in the future. \u201cWe thought we\u2019ve had a pretty good run last year \u2026 and lo and behold all these high fertiliser prices, high fuel prices and then high chemical [prices have] just eaten away at the excess that you probably plan to put away for a drought.\u201d  Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter Join the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community "

                    "body": "Thomas Tuchel has admitted that he and his players are worried and distracted by the \u201cuncertainty\u201d created by the Chelsea owner, Roman Abramovich, being named in parliament on Thursday.\nTuchel said he was aware that Chelsea could be affected if the UK government targets Abramovich with sanctions after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The manager acknowledged that Chelsea could not ignore that a Labour MP told parliament that Abramovich was identified by the Home Office in 2019 as having links to the Russian state as well as to \u201ccorrupt activity and practices\u201d.\n\nTelling MPs that he was quoting from a Home Office document leaked to him, Chris Bryant suggested that the UK should seize Abramovich\u2019s assets and bar him from owning Chelsea. Bryant also questioned why nothing more had been done about the 55-year-old\u2019s UK assets given this official verdict.\nAbramovich has put huge sums into Chelsea since buying the club in 2003 and Tuchel faced questions about the situation before his side face Liverpool in Sunday\u2019s Carabao Cup final. Tuchel said that his mind was \u201cclouded\u201d after the outbreak of war and he was asked about the potential impact on Chelsea employees and supporters if Abramovich were targeted by sanctions.\nAbramovich has vehemently disputed reports suggesting his alleged closeness to Vladimir Putin and Russia or that he has done anything to merit sanctions being imposed against him.\n\u201cI am aware of all these scenarios and I am aware of all these discussions at the moment,\u201d Tuchel said. \u201cI would love to take my right not to comment on this until there is a decision made. But we are aware of it and it\u2019s distracting us, it\u2019s worrying us. To a certain degree I can understand the opinions and the critical opinions towards the club, towards us who represent that club. I can understand that and we cannot fully free ourselves from it.\n\u201cMaybe people understand that me as a coach or the players, we don\u2019t have the insight what is really going on. At the moment we don\u2019t feel responsible for all this. We feel that it is horrible and there can be no doubt about it. War in Europe was unthinkable for me for a long period. The impact is clear and the discussions have an impact. Let\u2019s be a bit more patient and understand what the measurements will be and then we have to maybe deal with it.\u201d\nIn 2018 Abramovich withdrew his application for a new UK investor visa, amid worsening links between the UK and Russia. Abramovich has an Israeli passport and has since travelled to the UK using that.\nLast November he attended his first Chelsea match at Stamford Bridge in more than three years and he has continued to give the club huge financial backing. Chelsea won the Champions League last season and collected the 21st trophy of the Abramovich era with the Club World Cup this month.\nBut Tuchel accepted that Chelsea could be under a harsher spotlight now and he did not shy away from a question about Abramovich being named in parliament. \u201cYou\u2019re right, we should not pretend that this is not an issue and I agree,\u201d Tuchel said. \u201cThe situation in general, for me and for my staff and for everybody here at the Cobham, for the players, is horrible. Nobody expected this.\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty unreal, it\u2019s clouding our minds, it\u2019s clouding excitement towards the final and it brings huge uncertainty. Much more to all people and families who are actually more involved than us. And our best wishes and our regards and thoughts are obviously with them.\n\u201cStill, there are so many uncertainties around the situation of our club and of the situation in the UK with scenarios like this that it makes no sense if I comment on it. We are aware of it, we have not so much inside information as you think and in the very end, and don\u2019t understand me wrong, I think it\u2019s also derived from the team and from the staff, and I include myself, to be maybe not political. To do do sports and to focus on sports. Not because we are hiding. The situation is clear, it\u2019s horrible, there is no doubt about it.\u201d\n\nTuchel said that he would not try to take his mind off the crisis in Ukraine before the Liverpool game. \u201cI think you can\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the situation is too big and it is not an isolated situation somewhere. It concerns Europe, it\u2019s in Europe and we are part of Europe. We cannot say let\u2019s put this to the side. It\u2019s the opposite. We have to live with it right now. There is no running away from it.\n\u201cThere is no shutting the doors and now we focus on football. We are still privileged to live in peace and freedom right here where we are right now. And we are still privileged to have a game of football, to have an emotional but peaceful environment with fans in the stadium.\u201d"

                    "body": "The amount of electricity consumed by the largest cryptocurrency networks has decreased by up to 50% as the \u201ccrypto winter\u201d continues to eat at the incomes of \u201cminers\u201d and financial contagion spreads further throughout the sector. The electricity consumption of the bitcoin network has fallen by a third from its high of 11 June, down to an annualised 131 terawatt-hours a year, according to estimates from the crypto analyst Digiconomist. That still equates to the annual consumption of Argentina, with a single conventional bitcoin transaction using the same amount of electricity that a typical US household would use over 50 days. The decrease in electricity used for Ethereum, the \u201cprogrammable money\u201d that underpins much of the recent explosion in crypto projects, has been sharper still, down from a peak of 94TWh a year to 46TWh a year \u2013 the annualised consumption of Qatar. The underlying reason for the fall is the same for both currencies, however. The electricity consumption of a cryptocurrency network comes from \u201cmining\u201d, which involves people using purpose-built computers to generate digital lottery tickets that can reward cryptocurrency payouts. The process underpins the security of the networks, but incentivises the network as a whole to waste extraordinary amounts of energy. As the price of cryptocurrencies has fallen \u2013 bitcoin peaked at $69,000 (\u00a356,000) earlier this year, and is now hovering at about $20,000 \u2013 the value of the rewards to miners has dropped by the same proportion, leaving those in areas with expensive electricity or using older, inefficient mining \u201crigs\u201d unable to turn a profit. \u201cThis is literally putting them out of business, starting with the ones that operate with suboptimal equipment or under suboptimal circumstances (eg inefficient cooling),\u201d said Alex de Vries, the Dutch economist behind Digiconomist. \u201cFor bitcoin mining equipment that\u2019s a big issue, because those machines cannot be repurposed to do something else. When they\u2019re unprofitable they\u2019re useless machines. You can keep them around hoping the price will recover or sell them for scrap.\u201d  Ethereum, by contrast, can be mined using a normal computer. But it is most profitable to do so using a very powerful graphics card, which has led to widespread supply shortages of the cards and turned many gamers against the industry. The collapse in mining revenue has led to a flood of graphics cards on the second-hand market, as insolvent miners try to recoup their investments, but De Vries warnsit is a lottery to buy one. \u201cThese machines are typically operating 24/7 and the components will get hot doing so. Heat [especially for prolonged periods of time] is known to wear out electronics, reducing longevity and reliability. \u201cRight now it will mainly be older GPUs [graphics processing unit] becoming unprofitable, meaning that it\u2019s not unlikely these devices have been used for mining for a long time.\u201d Thankfully for gamers, the falling demand has also led to large price cuts for new components. Although the fall in bitcoin\u2019s price has stabilised over the past week, the wider cryptocurrency sector continues to stumble as a result of the huge price collapse. The latest jolt was caused by the failure of the ersatz cryptobank Celsius, which announced on 12 June that it was halting withdrawals as it faced a liquidity crisis. The failure of Celsius triggered a domino effect across the wider sector: Three Arrows Capital (3AC), a multibillion-dollar hedge fund, experienced its own liquidity crunch as a result, and multiple companies with substantial outstanding loans to 3AC have now had to take emergency measures in turn. Two other companies that offered bank-like services announced large exposures to 3AC. Last week Finblox said the hedge fund\u2019s actions had an \u201ceffect on liquidity\u201d, and heavily restricted user withdrawals, dropping the daily limit from $50,000 to $500 while stopping interest payments on deposits. On Wednesday Voyager, which offers 12% on crypto deposits, revealed it had an outstanding loan of $650m to 3AC, more than four times its available cash. Voyager added that it would consider 3AC in default if the hedge fund did not repay the loan in full by Monday morning. The company has also reportedly frozen user withdrawals. Bancor, a decentralised finance protocol that acts as an exchange, lost out to \u201cthe recent insolvency of two large centralised entities\u201d, believed to be Celsius and 3AC, and had to impose withdrawal limits. On Thursday another crypto exchange, CoinFLEX, announced that it was pausing withdrawals because of \u201cextreme market conditions\u201d. Amid the collapses, one large cryptocurrency company has emerged as a would-be saviour of the sector. Alameda Ventures, the investment arm of the crypto entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s empire, centred on his exchange FTX, has bailed out Voyager and the embattled exchange BlockFi, offering multimillion-dollar loans to both companies. The loans have earned him comparisons to JP Morgan, the US banker who stepped in during a 1907 financial crisis and bought up the stock of troubled companies in an effort to halt the collapse."

                    "body": "Foreign investment firms, private equity, pension funds and businesses lodged in tax havens own more than 70% of the water industry in England, according to research by the Guardian. The complex web of ownership is revealed as the public and some politicians increasingly call for the industry to be held to account for sewage dumping, leaks and water shortages. Six water companies are under investigation for potentially illegal activities as pressure grows on the industry to put more money into replacing and restoring crumbling infrastructure to protect both the environment and public health. More than three decades after the sector was sold off with a promise to the public they would become individual small shareholders or \u201cH<sub>2</sub>Owners\u201d, control of the water industry has become dominated by overseas investment vehicles, the super-rich, companies in tax havens and pension fund investors. The ownership structure is such that transparency and accountability are limited, according to Dr Kate Bayliss, a research associate with the department of economics at Soas University of London. International investment funds with large stakes include several household names as well as sovereign wealth funds. For example the Qatar Investment Authority is the third largest shareholder in Severn Trent, with a 4.6% holding, while almost 10% is held by the US investment company BlackRock and its subsidiaries, according to analysis of shareholdings as of October this year. A subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority has a 9.9% stake in Thames Water, while 8.7% is owned by China, the analysis shows. The Guardian has tracked more than 100 shareholders of the nine main water and sewerage companies and six smaller firms that serve customers in England. The research reveals at least 72% of the industry is controlled by firms in 17 countries, while UK firms own 10%. Ownership of 82% of the water industry was traced overall. Most water firms in England are now privately owned. Only three; Severn Trent; Pennon Group, the parent company of South West Water, and United Utilities, are listed on the stock exchange. But their shares are largely owned by the same type of infrastructure funds and private equity firms that own water companies in private hands. Bayliss has carried out academic research of the industry ownership structures and said: \u201cThis is a quite different model to how one might expect a private company to operate. It\u2019s not simply a case of the owner aiming to raise revenue and lower costs and keep the profits. Private equity earnings are more likely to be achieved by restructuring company finances, or financial engineering than productivity improvements\u2026\u201d \u201cThere is a much stronger focus on extracting revenue, rather than the long-term health of a company \u2026 It creates risky financial structures. We\u2019ve seen some retail companies collapse with this private equity structure,\u201d she added. The ownership structure of some water companies was so complex and opaque that it was impossible to know exactly who owned them, said Bayliss. \u201cIs it possible to work out what funds are flowing where? Some fund managers I\u2019ve spoken have told me: \u2018You\u2019ll never get it. Unless you are an insider, you just can\u2019t work it out.\u2019\u201d By country the US has the strongest foothold in English water companies, with investment firms owning nearly 17% overall. Canadian and Australian companies are the second and third biggest overall investors in English water. BlackRock has stakes in Pennon, Severn Trent, United Utilities and Bristol Water. Other US private equity firms also have footholds in the English water industry. Lazard Asset Management and the Vanguard Group both hold shares in Pennon, Severn Trent and United Utilities. Two Canadian pension funds, Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System and Canada Pension Plan, own a third of Thames and Anglian Water respectively. Macquarie, an Australian investment firm, moved in to shore up Southern Water last year with a \u00a31bn injection after the company was fined \u00a390m for dumping billions of litres of raw sewage into coastal waters off Kent and Hampshire. The fine came after what the judge said was a history of criminality for previous and persistent pollution of the environment. Macquarie, which reported half-yearly profits of more than \u00a31.3bn in November, owns 62% of Southern. Another 15% of the water company is controlled by the US investment firm JP Morgan Asset Management. Another Australian investment firm, IFM Global Infrastructure Fund, has a 20% stake in Anglian Water, whose parent company, Anglian Water Group, is registered in the tax haven of Jersey. Overall Australian investment companies control 11% of English water. At least a fifth of the industry is owned by corporations based in Asia. Northumbrian Water, which supplies 2.7 million people in north-east England, is ultimately owned by the Cayman Islands-registered CK Hutchison Holdings Limited, the business empire of Li Ka-shing, Hong Kong\u2019s richest individual. This summer the CK Group sold a 25% stake in Northumbrian to the New York-listed private equity firm KKR for \u00a3867m. In Yorkshire the water provided to homes and businesses, and the wastewater treatment, is owned by a consortium of private investment groups based in Singapore, the US and Germany as well as an Australian pension fund. They own Yorkshire Water\u2019s parent company, Kelda Group, which is based in Jersey. The company is registered in the UK for tax purposes. Ash Smith, a co-founder of the campaign group Windrush Against Sewage Pollution who has investigated water companies for several years, said: \u201cThe smell of privatisation and weak regulation reached far across the globe and attracted the most powerful and clever shareholders\u2019 funds. \u201cThe deal was unbelievable \u2013 buy a refundable stake in a water monopoly and feast on the guaranteed annual bills from captive customers in exchange for nothing.\u201d The ownership of the water industry is being exposed as the government orders firms to spend \u00a356bn over 25 years to reduce the scale of raw sewage discharges into waterways from storm overflows. The government has said the cash injection amounts to the \u201clargest infrastructure project to restore the environment in water company history\u201d. But it is not the web of international investment firms and private equity that is being asked to pay for the capital investment. Instead, ordinary customers are to foot the bill, according to the storm overflow plan released by the government. The public will pay on average \u00a342 a year to foot the bill for reducing sewage discharges. But some customers will pay much more; particularly those living in areas served by Wessex Water, Yorkshire Water and United Utilities who could be asked to pay more than three times that figure because their companies have the biggest investment programmes to tackle storm overflows, according to the government. Wessex Water, which supplies more than 1 million customers in Bristol Somerset, Wiltshire and Dorset is fully owned by YTL Corporation Berhad, a Malaysian infrastructure conglomerate helmed by Francis Yeoh. Water companies said the industry was investing record amounts of private money into the sector. Yorkshire, Southern and Thames said they had not paid dividends for seven, five and five years respectively. Yorkshire said it was not expecting to pay dividends during its five-year business plan period to 2025. Martin Bradley, the head of Macquarie Asset Management\u2019s real assets team for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said Southern Water was showing early signs of operational improvements after the investment made by Macquarie. \u201cWe are focused on accelerating this momentum, supporting Southern Water as it delivers on our commitments and invests the equivalent of \u00a31,000 per household in its region this regulatory period to upgrade its infrastructure,\u201d he said. A spokesperson for BlackRock said that as a minority investor on behalf of its clients, the firm engaged with publicly listed UK water companies on governance and material sustainability risks. \u201cIt is not, however, the role of minority investors to direct these companies \u2013 this role is the responsibility of their management teams with appropriate board oversight, and as determined by their regulator,\u201d they said. Severn Trent said it had invested \u00a325bn in infrastructure, including \u00a3100m each year improving the rivers in its region. The company said it believed paying dividends was important, and a large proportion of its shareholders were retail investors, including more than 70% of its employees, and pension funds that depended on dividends every year. United Utilities said it had a strong track-record of responsibly raising debt at low rates to fund long-term investment in water and wastewater systems, and to deliver a better service for customers, to protect the environment and ensure affordable bills. South West Water said it had invested \u00a39bn into the region\u2019s water and wastewater infrastructure, delivering improved performance for customers and the environment. Anglian Water said it had invested about \u00a320bn since privatisation to reduce leakage and to improve drinking water quality and the environment; all of which was made possible almost entirely through private financing. The company said net dividends it had paid by Anglian Water since 2010 were well below the level expected by the regulator. Wessex Water said dividends paid reflected the allowed regulated return, plus any outperformance rewards. The company said YTL had been a stable owner for more than 20 years and was committed to long-term stewardship of an important public service asset. Northumbrian Water did not want to comment."

                    "body": "Rewind more than four decades and, long before Pep Guardiola and J\u00fcrgen Klopp became English football\u2019s defining managerial duel, it was Brian Clough against Bob Paisley. If the German, with his Clough-esque charisma, eminent quotability and seeming ability to shape events by force of personality, seems to borrow more from the architect of Nottingham Forest\u2019s success than his most decorated predecessor at Anfield, he has something in common with both. He has coached teams to glory in the European Cup but never the FA Cup. For a couple more months, anyway. Guardiola still blocks his path. Thomas Tuchel, another Champions League winner, may too, but Klopp is into the uncharted territory of a first semi-final.  It has been a long and winding road, spanning 20 games over six years featuring 81 players. It took 78 minutes to break down Nottingham Forest. Diogo Jota, who sent Liverpool to Wembley in the Carabao Cup, did likewise in the senior knockout competition. So an FA Cup run that began with outings for Melkamu Frauendorf and Max Woltman against Shrewsbury now features a date with Kevin De Bruyne and Phil Foden. For Klopp, it has been a six-year odyssey that started with Tiago Ilori, Cameron Brannagan, Jo\u00e3o Teixeira and Jerome Sinclair playing in a 2016 draw with Exeter. It was not his last eclectic selection in this competition. Naming all those 81 players is no mean feat. Yet if a lack of strength in depth accounted for some of Liverpool\u2019s early exits in Klopp\u2019s reign, now he has his deepest ever squad. He is better equipped to rotate and advance. With Forest frustrating him, an advocate of five substitutions in Premier League matches made a quadruple change, summoning the high-calibre quartet of Jordan Henderson, Thiago Alc\u00e2ntara, Takumi Minamino and Luis D\u00edaz. If the goal did not directly stem from any, the ability to throw all on felt significant. Rewind a month and other former European champions, Internazionale, were holding Liverpool until Klopp turned to an enviable bench. They duly lost, too. This was more of a mix\u2011and\u2011match team. Perhaps only Virgil van Dijk, Fabinho and Alisson figure in his strongest side, though Jota\u2019s winner enhanced his case to belong in that bracket. For a long time, Roberto Firmino\u2019s place among the automatic choices went unquestioned. The Brazilian may be the definitive Klopp player, the first great gegenpresser and the fulcrum of the inverted forward line, where wingers ran beyond him and outscored him. Anfield\u2019s favourite false 9 finds himself in a curious position now, and not merely with his habit of dropping deep to scurry after the ball.  D\u00edaz\u2019s arrival gives Klopp five frontline forwards. Perhaps Firmino is now fifth in line. Maybe his Stakhanovite efforts have drained him of his dynamism and threatened him with decline. A non-scoring striker was reinvented as an impact substitute who delivered telling goals in cameos away at Internazionale and Arsenal. Starting for the first time in five weeks, he overcomplicated matters when trying to chip Ethan Horvath. With Sadio Man\u00e9 now a rival for his role in the middle of the attack, it may have been an ill-timed miss; if not one that cost Liverpool. Klopp had rested Man\u00e9, sparing him for Senegal\u2019s World Cup play-off against Egypt. With Mohamed Salah missing a Liverpool game due to injury for the first time since 2019, he could still hold D\u00edaz in reserve. At the other end, Klopp\u2019s greater interest in the FA Cup was summed up by his choice of goalkeeper. It was not a reserve, but the regular. And as an old rivalry was renewed, this time the man in the green jumper was Alisson, not Clough. There was a throwback to the 1970s, though, as Forest showed their days of resisting Liverpool were not confined to the past. They were fearless. The urgency of their pressing game suggested imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Liverpool meet with more deferential opposition in the Champions League, let alone the Premier League. When a centre-back wearing the captain\u2019s armband made a superb last-ditch challenge, it was Joe Worrall, not Van Dijk. Many suffer in comparison with the Dutchman but the Forest skipper did not.  Sean Dyche, a fine judge of a central defender, is a long-time fan of Worrall and his band of admirers may be swelling. He was terrific. Thanks to him, Forest almost became just the fifth team to keep a clean sheet against Liverpool this season. Few have harnessed the power of belief better than Klopp but Forest believed. Djed Spence, the scourge of Arsenal and Leicester, sought to reprise that role. Keinan Davis was a formidable presence in attack. Brennan Johnson buzzed around in the manner of a Klopp forward. Forest could rue the moment Philip Zinckernagel shot wide from Johnson\u2019s inviting cross as Jota popped up a couple of minutes later. It meant Forest\u2019s first quarter-final for 26 years ended in defeat. The J\u00fcrgen they encountered in their previous one was Klinsmann, a scorer twice for Bayern Munich in the last eight of the Uefa Cup. Now it was Klopp who advanced. He may yet succeed where Clough famously failed in the FA Cup."

                    "body": "Tom Daley sounds as if he\u2019s still in shock. Britain\u2019s most celebrated diver recently returned from visiting various Commonwealth countries to investigate LGBTQ+ rights. Of course he knew there were issues; that in much of the Commonwealth homosexuality is still criminalised, thanks to the British empire exporting draconian homophobic laws to the colonies in the 19th century. But knowing something is different from meeting the people who live with those threats on a daily basis. It has changed so many of his views, he says \u2013 not least on what it means to be British. It all started last October, when he said during a TV interview that he didn\u2019t think countries with discriminatory LGBTQ+ laws should be allowed to host major international sporting events. He was then invited to deliver C4\u2019s alternative Christmas message, by which time he had refined his position. \u201cIn 2022, the World Cup is being held in the second most dangerous country for queer people, Qatar. Why are we allowing places that aren\u2019t safe for all fans and for all players to host our most prestigious sporting events? Hosting a World Cup is an honour. Why are we honouring them? Holding a Formula One grand prix is an honour. Why are we honouring Saudi Arabia?\u201d Earlier this year, BBC producers suggested that in the buildup to the 2022 Commonwealth Games he should find out for himself just how hard it is to live as a gay athlete in countries that criminalise homosexuality. Making the resulting documentary sickened and inspired him in equal measure. Since then, he\u2019s done a volte-face about banning homophobic countries from hosting major sports events, and created a manifesto for LGBTQ+ inclusiveness that he is hoping will be co\u2011opted by the committees for everything from the Commonwealth Games to the Olympics. Daley has so much to say that he doesn\u2019t quite know where to start. So it all pours out at once. \u201cThere are so many horror stories. I met an athlete in Jamaica who came in a hoodie, and sat behind a curtain with her voice distorted. She didn\u2019t want me to know her name because their lives are in danger if they are named. In Lahore, I spoke to an athlete that had to remain anonymous because she is incredibly high profile. She had a gay friend who was killed, stoned in the streets. An athlete in Nigeria told me one of his friends got lured in on a dating app, and then was stabbed to death and left to die in a pool of his own blood.\u201d Again, he stops, appalled. \u201cDid you know 35 of the 56 countries involved in the Commonwealth Games still criminalise same-sex relationships and seven have the death penalty?\u201d The figures are tripping off his tongue now, but they still clearly have the power to disturb him. \u201cIn any of these 35 countries, it is illegal to be me. I went on such a wild learning curve,\u201d he says.  Daley is Zooming from the London home which he shares with his husband, Oscar-winning film-maker Dustin Lance Black, and their four-year-old son, Robbie. A stuffed giraffe towers over Daley, to his side is a knitted squid, and on the wall is a coloured alphabet. \u201cThis is Robbie\u2019s bedroom,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got people around today, so it\u2019s easier for me to be locked away in a quiet space.\u201d Lovely giraffe, I say. He smiles. \u201cWe got it from a local flea market. It\u2019s missing an ear. They said you can have it for 25 quid if you keep the name Benson, so it\u2019s Benson the giraffe.\u201d You could have changed his name, and they wouldn\u2019t have known any better, I say. He looks at me, mildly disapproving. \u201cBut I\u2019m not that kind of person. I\u2019m an honest person. I couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d How\u2019s Robbie? \u201cHe\u2019s great! Robbie\u2019s got a lot of personality!\u201d Daley tells me he loves to climb up things and jump off them. \u201cIt scares the living daylights out of me. Lance says, \u2018What do you expect? You climb up things and jump off them for a living.\u2019 When I look back, I wonder how my parents dealt with watching me do what I do every day and not be petrified.\u201d He says Robbie has recently learned to swim. \u201cThis time last year he was the only kid in the class who didn\u2019t want to jump in the water!\u201d Can he dive yet? \u201cNo, he\u2019s not interested in that.\u201d He has packed so much into his life, it\u2019s hard to believe Daley is still only 28. I first met him when he was 17 and preparing for the London 2012 Olympics. He looked young for his age (except for the precocious six-pack) but seemed eerily mature, already a veteran. He started diving at seven, became the youngest winner of the senior 10m platform event at the British Championships and the European Championships at 13, competed in the Olympics at 14, won the World Championship at 15, and on it goes. Record after record broken. But that was just the half of it. His trials have been as notable as his triumphs. In 2011, his beloved father, Rob, died of cancer, aged 40. Rob seemed so different from the young Tom \u2013 he was big and bluff, and didn\u2019t care what he said to anybody. All he wanted to do was protect and support his family (Tom has two younger brothers).  And the young Tom did need plenty of support. He was bullied at school after becoming famous, and his mental health suffered. Apart from the extraordinary strength and gymnastic skills required for diving, the demands were relentless \u2013 four hours training every day after school, competing regularly away from home, making sure he wasn\u2019t carrying an ounce of fat. And when it went wrong, it was horribly painful. Daley had the scars to prove it. Back in 2012 he showed me a few of his war wounds \u2013 a scar on the top of his head, another on his forehead, and a muscular stalactite of scar tissue on his upper arm where he had torn his tricep. He told me that the impact on his body, entering the water at 35mph, was \u201clike having a car crash every time you dive\u201d, and admitted \u201cI still get scared every time I go up there.\u201d His former coach Andy Banks had recently said that as a youngster Tom got so lonely and distressed away from home that he threatened to jump out of a window if he was left alone. At the London Olympics, Daley won a bronze medal in the individual 10m platform dive. After all he\u2019d recently been through, it felt as if he had won gold. On the podium, he couldn\u2019t stop grinning. He held up his bronze medal, showed it around the arena, then lifted it to heaven for his dad. *** I ask Daley whether he is surprised how his life has turned out. If he thinks back to the 13-year-old diving sensation, is this what he would have expected for himself? God no, he says. \u201cThere are so many things I\u2019ve done which I wouldn\u2019t have seen myself doing when I was younger, especially being in the forefront of LGBT stuff.\u201d Because it was irrelevant to him back then or he never saw himself being a campaigner? \u201cA little bit of everything. I didn\u2019t understand queer history. And I\u2019ve taken the time to learn and understand and listen.\u201d If he met 13-year-old Tom today, what would he say to him? \u201cJust keep being you. Keep working hard, keep your head down and keep going. Don\u2019t worry about what other people say, keep being you. That\u2019s what I ended up doing, but it would have been nice to have someone reassure me that it was all going to be OK.\u201d And how does he think that 13-year-old boy would respond to him? \u201cWhat on earth have you done?\u201d He giggles. \u201cMy dream when I was a kid was to win a gold medal, and I managed that. But my dreams have evolved over the years \u2013 to get married, have a family, and if you\u2019d told me I was going to knit and crochet I would have laughed at you, but here we are.\u201d Daley only started knitting a couple of years ago. After he was seen crafting in the stands at the Olympics (including making a fetching pouch for his medals), his skills gained him a whole new fanbase of fellow knitters and crafters. Now he\u2019s got his own knitwear design company, Made With Love.  When he came out in December 2013, he did it in style, on his own YouTube channel with a homemade video called Something I Want to Say. He talked about how much his life had changed over the past couple of years \u2013 his father had died, he\u2019d won the Olympic medal and he had passed his A-levels (straight As in maths, Spanish and photography). Then it became more personal. \u201cIn spring my life changed massively when I met someone. They make me feel so happy, so safe. Everything just feels great, and that someone is a guy.\u201d The Sexual Offences Act 1967 legalised gay sex in England and Wales for consenting adults over the age of 21 (it was finally lowered to 16 in 2000), but it continues to be criminalised in most Commonwealth countries. Daley is now fully aware of the number of these countries where he wouldn\u2019t have been able to make such a video. How does it make him feel about Britain? I half expect him to eulogise liberal British values, but he\u2019s not having any of it. He says he feels angry and deceived. \u201cI learned so much about what British rule did that was not OK. It feels as if we\u2019re trying to erase our history by saying, \u2018Look how much we\u2019re bringing people together now.\u2019 But we\u2019ve got to acknowledge what happened. Hearing those stories, I had my head in my hands. I wanted the ground to swallow me up. I felt so dark about my relationship with being British. I came away from it with a really twisted sense of what it meant to be British.\u201d The way you talk about it, I say, you sound as if you feel personal responsibility. \u201cYes, I do in a sense. That was the twisted part of it. I thought: what can I do? I felt very helpless to be British.\u201d  He reassessed his earlier position on banning homophobic countries from hosting major events when LGBTQ+ athletes and campaigners told him that a ban would be another form of imperialism. \u201cThey said, \u2018That\u2019s again being an oppressor. It\u2019s not allowing a country to learn and come to the table and grow.\u2019 The number one thing they said they wanted was visibility. Seeing the Pride flag waved is a sign of safety for lots of people.\u201d The athletes convinced him that a carrot was far more effective than a stick. So rather than an outright ban, he drew up a manifesto with their help, founded on the principle that any country could host the event if they signed a contract saying the Games had to have a pro-LGBT ethos. His manifesto states that host countries must allow Pride flags to be flown and provide Pride Houses (dedicated temporary venues dedicated to LGBTQ+ inclusion, diversity and culture), along with sensitivity training for Games workers. \u201cSo rather than saying to certain countries you can\u2019t host it, it\u2019s saying that if you want to host it, you have to change. Instead of banning countries, countries will rule themselves out by accepting they are not appropriate hosts because they do not fit the values of the event.\u201d Daley has already presented his proposals to the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF). At the opening ceremony, Daley played a prominent role. He led out six athletes and activists, carrying Progress Pride flags, from countries where homosexuality is criminalised. Daley is planning to present his manifesto to all the major international sports events and hopes that it will eventually be adopted worldwide. *** Has Britain changed since Daley came out in that YouTube video? \u201cYes and no. Things have progressed in terms of people that are out and visible. Back in 2013, there weren\u2019t many out athletes at the top of their game. People had either retired or were towards the end of their career. There is a lot more visibility in sport.\u201d And yet, he says, there is still so much progress to be made. He cites football as the most obvious example \u2013 there is not a single Premier League footballer who has come out while playing, and only one who has done so since retiring (the German international Thomas Hitzlsperger). There is another thing that worries Daley. He believes that rightwing populism threatens the gains countries such as Britain and the US have made since the 1960s, and cites the US supreme court overturning Roe v Wade, ruling there is no constitutional right to abortion. \u201cThings are happening in the States with women\u2019s rights. Then the equality of gay marriage has been brought into question. Then not banning trans conversion therapy in the UK. I feel we\u2019re at this pivotal moment in the queer movement in terms of holding on to our rights, which are being chipped away at. They\u2019re almost trying to catch us off guard because the younger generation has never had to fight for that before. I can see how frustrated the older generation are because of what they\u2019ve fought for. And it\u2019s slowly being clawed back. We can\u2019t become complacent and we need to make many alliances. People need to come together as one. There is power in numbers.\u201d Isn\u2019t part of the problem that the LGBTQ+ community is at war with itself over trans rights? The level of fury between trans rights activists and gender-critical feminists astonishes me, I say. Daley nods, and says it\u2019s dangerous. \u201cThe LGBT community is so fractured right now over certain issues. And that\u2019s when the right are going to get us. They\u2019re going to try to break us down. And if you think they\u2019re just going to take away trans people\u2019s rights, you\u2019re wrong. It\u2019s going to go much further than that, and we have to stick together as an LGBTQIA+ community to stop that happening.\u201d So how can you reconcile such polarised factions? He doesn\u2019t attempt to provide an answer, but says one is needed. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do something about it soon, something monumental will happen and we\u2019ll be back at square one. The right wing is very good at making people fight with each other to create tension and division and fear. If you ask the younger generation, nobody cares what somebody\u2019s gender is or what their sexuality is. Everybody just wants to be a human being. First and foremost, our planet is falling apart. If we don\u2019t sort that out and stop arguing about other things, we\u2019re not even going to have a planet to exist on. There are certain people on social media who have a very big platform who can say certain things that get sensationalised \u2026\u201d  Aren\u2019t you one of them, I say. After all Daley has 2.2m followers on Twitter. In June, speaking at the British LGBT awards, where he was named Sports Personality of the Year, he condemned the decision of Fina (the administrative body for international water sport) to ban trans athletes who have been through any part of male puberty from elite women\u2019s competition. Daley said when he heard the ruling, \u201cI was furious. Anyone that\u2019s told that they can\u2019t compete or can\u2019t do something they love just because of who they are, it\u2019s not on. It\u2019s something I feel really strongly about \u2013 giving trans people the chance to share their side.\u201d For so long, Daley has been regarded as a national treasure. But as he takes a more active role in the charged debate about trans athletes, it is inevitable that opinions about him will become divided. In an interview with GB News, former Olympic swimmer Sharron Davies responded to Daley\u2019s speech by suggesting that as a male athlete he doesn\u2019t have any skin in the game: \u201cTom is male and this does not affect him in the slightest \u2026 I think we have to listen to the women, and Fina were the first governing body since 2015 to actually poll their female athletes and listen to their coaches.\u201d Fina ruled that transgender women and girls can only compete in elite women\u2019s events if they have not gone through any of the male puberty process, or before they reach the age of 12, whichever is later. Daley believes it is a crude, cruel and dangerous decision. \u201cIt puts certain athletes in a very difficult position because they\u2019re either never going to be able to compete again, or their parents are going to have to make decisions just before their children turn 12. That puts a lot of pressure on parents to make those decisions. It\u2019s not the right message to send about sports that trans kids are not welcome if they don\u2019t transition before they are 12.\u201d  Does he think that ultimately inclusion trumps fairness? \u201cNo, of course not. But, as human beings, we have to be a little bit more thoughtful before banning people completely from something. If kids are doomed to never be able to do what they love, they may well just give up.\u201d I mention a 2020 study that found trans women retain a 12% advantage in running tests even after taking hormones for two years to suppress their testosterone. \u201cYou just have to do all of those studies and have the full understanding before you make any decisions like that. If they find out it takes five years, fine, five years. If it takes six years, fine, then six years. But so much goes into it rather than just being able to make a decision based on one study.\u201d Your thinking sounds more nuanced than the statement you made at the awards ceremony, I say. \u201cIt is more nuanced. Having a conversation is different from having 30 seconds to say something. But overall I still stand by what I said \u2013 trans people should never be banned from sport.\u201d Is the issue dividing fellow athletes? \u201cYes. There are certain people who have very strong opinions about it one way or another. But people are trying to make it a problem before it is a problem.\u201d He says the number of trans athletes in elite sport is minuscule. \u201cThere has never been a trans diver that has stayed in diving, yet people have gone mad about it.\u201d The issue of trans women even became the battleground for the Tory leadership election. Penny Mordaunt, a contestant on Daley\u2019s ITV celebrity diving show Splash! in 2014, was accused by rivals of being a \u201cwoke warrior\u201d for her previous support of trans women. Mordaunt desperately tried to distance herself, insisting she had never claimed \u201ctrans women are women\u201d. Is this what he means by LGBT issues being hijacked? He nods. \u201cThink of the tiny percentage of trans people in the population, and prospective Tory leaders are using that to win votes. I don\u2019t understand why people think they have to be less woke in order to lead a country. \u201cHow can understanding people\u2019s feelings be a bad thing?\u201d He trails off, lost for words. *** Daley has always been one of life\u2019s planners. I met him again in 2015 when he\u2019d just turned 21 and was living with Black, a prominent campaigner in the fight for US marriage equality. Daley was mapping out his future \u2013 a gold medal at Rio, a career in television after diving, marriage and kids at some point. He said he knew he\u2019d be the disciplinarian because he was tougher than Black, despite the fact that his partner was 20 years older. Two years later he and Black married, and in 2018 Robbie was born with the help of an egg donor and a surrogate. Both Daley and Black donated sperm, and said they didn\u2019t want to know who is the biological father. As for the gold at Rio, that didn\u2019t materialise. He won a bronze in the synchronised 10m with Daniel Goodfellow. This time, coming third felt like a failure. He missed out on an individual medal, and it looked as if he was destined never to land the big one. Then, last year, at the delayed Tokyo Olympics, he finally won gold with his best friend, Matty Lee, in the synchronised 10m, after a series of near-perfect dives. As in 2012, it was one of the emotional highs of the Games. When they realised they had won, Daley jumped into Lee\u2019s arms and wrapped his legs around him. A masked Daley wept on the podium. He also went on to win an individual bronze.  Earlier this year he told me, \u201cThe morning after winning an Olympic gold medal was the first morning I woke up and really felt a sense of peace. I knew I\u2019d done everything I wanted to do in this sport. I felt I can finally be happy now.\u201d Has he still got that sense of contentment? \u201cYes. I don\u2019t think that will ever go away. It\u2019s going to be a year tomorrow!\u201d he says ecstatically. Daley has not dived since Tokyo, using the time to take stock. He knows it will soon be time to hang up his trunks, but he\u2019s still hoping to go out with a bang at the Paris Olympics in 2024. As for his future, he\u2019s got big plans. At least one more child hopefully. Then there\u2019s a fashion line. \u201cI\u2019d love to expand Made With Love and really go into the world of fashion.\u201d And the TV career. \u201cI\u2019d love to eventually be a TV host.\u201d You\u2019ve already been one, I say. \u201cYeah, but a proper one. Ant and Dec vibes. Or Holly and Phil.\u201d Blimey, that\u2019s ambitious! \u201cWell you\u2019ve got to be ambitious.\u201d Meanwhile, his campaigning shows no sign of abating. Would he ever go into politics? \u201cOooh I don\u2019t know. After seeing the state it\u2019s in at the moment, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d have the patience with the other people.\u201d It\u2019s hardly a no. He might not have many dives left in him, but it feels as if Tom Daley is just getting started.  \u2022 Tom Daley: Illegal to Be Me will air on 9 August at 9pm on BBC One and iPlayer."

Thanks for your company and emails, ta-ra.      5.06pm    Pep\u2019s verdict \u201cIt\u2019s so difficult: Southampton are one of the most well-organised teams we have played this season. They play with incredible intensity and the goal was a consequence of that. We forgot to play in the last 20 minutes of the first half. The second half was much better \u2013 more personality.\u201d      5.02pm    Three quarter-finals down, one to go      4.56pm    Kevin De Bruyne\u2019s post-match thoughts \u201cIn the first 20 minutes and the last half hour we did well. In between we made too many stupid mistakes. They played well, but we got much better in the second half. The third and fourth were beautiful goals. We want to win every competition we enter; we\u2019re very happy to be in another semi-final and hopefully we\u2019ll win this one.\u201d     4.52pm    More FA Cup news I say!      4.52pm   Full time: Southampton 1-4 Manchester City  Peep peep! The Treble is still on for Manchester City, who move into the semi-finals after a deceptively uncomfortable win at St Mary\u2019s. The scoreline doesn\u2019t tell the story of an excellent game in which Southampton gave as good as they got for 70 minutes. Ultimately - who knew - City\u2019s superior class and depth were decisive.   Updated at 4.54pm GMT    4.49pm    90 min Two minutes of added time.     4.48pm    89 min Gunodgan\u2019s superb cross somehow evades the diving Sterling, three yards from goal. I can\u2019t decide if that was a bad miss or whether it just dipped under him.      4.47pm    88 min Two more changes for Southampton: Will Smallbone and Ibrahima Diallo replace Oriol Romeu and Mohamed Elyounoussi.     4.46pm    87 min Mahrez could have had a hat-trick since coming on. He runs at the last man Salisu, beats him with a stepover and shoots just wide of the far post.     4.45pm    87 min \u201cHasenhuttl has brought back his waistcoat,\u201d says Thomas Stratford, \u201cwhile in France it seems Poch has gone full Wenger with the touchline outfits?\u201d  That\u2019s not an outfit, it\u2019s a sleeping bag for two.     4.44pm    86 min \u201cUgh,\u201d says Rachel Clifton. \u201cMaybe if we had had the players who can actually score on from the beginning, it might have been different?!\u201d Hmm, I don\u2019t know \u2013 Adams missed possibly the best chance of the lot when he came on. Southampton have played really well; City have just been more clinical.  Updated at 4.45pm GMT    4.43pm    84 min Mahrez twists a defender inside out and rattles a shot that is beaten awya by Forster. Mercy.  Updated at 4.43pm GMT    4.42pm    83 min Moussa Djenepo comes on for Southampton in place of the superb Stuart Armstrong.     4.41pm    83 min Three more changes for City: Nathan Ake, Fernandinho and Oleksandra Zinchenko replace Joao Cancelo, Rodri and Aymeric Laporte.     4.39pm    80 min \u201cI bet Hasenhuttl got all excited when he heard United were after a German bloke called Ralf,\u201d says Rick Harris. \u201cCourse, Ed Woodward couldn\u2019t hit a barn door with a banjo so they ended up with Rangnick.\u201d Well, his name is Ralph. And he\u2019s Austrian!  Updated at 4.39pm GMT    4.38pm    Cancelo waves a majestic pass into Gundogan with the outside of the right foot. He chests it down and slides the ball to Mahrez on the far side of the area. Mahrez shapes to shoot back across goal and then cracks it past Forster at the near post.  Updated at 4.40pm GMT    4.37pm   GOAL! Southampton 1-4 Man City (Mahrez 78)  This is so harsh on Southampton.    Updated at 4.44pm GMT    4.35pm    It\u2019s harsh on Southampton, who have played superbly, but what an emphatic finish. Salisu\u2019s defensive header rebounded off Foden, standing nearby, and dropped into the D. Foden ran after the ball, waited for it to bounce, and thrashed a sizzling shot into the far corner.  Updated at 4.58pm GMT    4.34pm   GOAL! Southampton 1-3 Manchester City (Foden 75)  Phil Foden settles matters with a belter!   Updated at 4.39pm GMT    4.33pm    73 min: Great chance for Adams! Elyounoussi kills a crossfield pass beautifully and squares the ball to Adams, who shoots straight at Steffen on the run. Walker-Peters picks up the rebound and wobbles a shot just wide from 20 yards. Southampton have some really good chances today, arguably more than City.     4.31pm    72 min: Chance for Mahrez! Cancelo forces a good pass down the left to Sterling. He cuts inside and curls a cross towards De Bruyne at the far post. Walker-Peters does well to intercept but can only head the ball straight up in the air. It drops onto the right foot of Mahrez, eight yards out, and he screws a volley well wide.     4.30pm    72 min \u201cIf my hunch is correct,\u201d says Peter Oh, \u201cthe introduction of Adams and Broja is about to make Pep throw some extremely contortionistic pretzel shapes.\u201d Is contortionistic a word? It is now!      4.29pm    71 min The City keeper Zack Steffen is booked for timewasting.     4.29pm    70 min A superb corner routine from Southampton. Ward-Prowse, on the right, arrows it to the edge of the area, where Stuart Armstrong hits a sweet strike that is blocked by Rodri. Stuart Armstrong has had an outstanding game.     4.28pm    69 min A quiet spell in the game, with City passing the clock down.     4.24pm    66 min \u201cHands off,\u201d says Ben Tuff of my Hasenhuttl comment in the 58th minute.  On that note, Southampton supporters, did you feel pride, frustration or both when you watched Pochettino\u2019s Spurs? And what about when you see ex-players like Mane do so well? Does it depend how long they were at the club?  Updated at 4.26pm GMT    4.23pm    64 min Foden, just on, has a close-range shot smothered by Stephens (I think).     4.22pm    64 min City see Southampton\u2019s double change and raise it: Riyad Mahrez and Phil Foden come on for Gabriel Jesus and the subdued Jack Grealish.     4.21pm    63 min Southampton make a double change: Che Adams and Armando Broja replace Adam Armstrong and Shane Long.     4.21pm   GOAL! Southampton 1-2 Man City (De Bruyne 62 pen)  City are back in front. Forster went the right way, to his right, but De Bruyne\u2019s penalty sneaked under him. I think he got a touch on it but it was low and close enough to the corner.    Updated at 4.26pm GMT    4.20pm    61 min: Penalty to City! Salisu has been penalised for tripping Jesus just inside the area on the right. It\u2019s a soft penalty but a penalty nonetheless, and such a needless challenge.  Updated at 4.20pm GMT    4.19pm    60 min Salisu\u2019s speculative long pass so nearly puts Long through on goal. Laporte clears but Southampton regain possession and Ward-Prowse whistles a long-range shot that is well held by Steffen.     4.18pm    59 min City are starting to dominate, as they did at this stage of the first half. It\u2019s a hot day, and Southampton have worked their breathable socks off, so fatigue might be a factor.     4.16pm    58 min \u201cSouthampton\u2019s whole season is riding on this game in their quest for the singuple,\u201d says Rick Harris. \u201cI\u2019ve been really impressed with Hasenhuttl\u2019s tactics against the big teams this season and if his team destroy City\u2019s treble hopes you wouldn\u2019t bet against them reaching another final.\u201d Well, you might if they get Liverpool or Chelsea. But I agree with you, Hasenhuttl is a top-class coach. You can never be completely sure, but I think he\u2019s good enough to manage a Big Six team.  Updated at 4.23pm GMT    4.16pm    57 min De Bruyne curls over from 20 yards.     4.14pm    55 min Both teams have potential matchwinners on the bench: Redmond, Adams and Broja for Southampton; Mahrez, Foden and Bernardo Silva for City.     4.12pm    54 min Ward-Prowse wins the ball in his own half and releases Adam Armstrong on the left with a long crossfield pass. He runs at the last man Walker and hits a tame shot that deflects behind off Stones.     4.11pm    53 min A helluva scramble in the Southampton area. De Bruyne has a close-range shot blocked crucially by Stephens, and then Rodri\u2019s follow-up is deflected over the bar.     4.08pm    49 min Southampton are right in this game. They have been really impressive both in their pressing and passing.     4.07pm    48 min Romeu stabs an excellent ball to find Adam Armstrong in space, 22 yards from goal. He turns, gets the ball out of his feet but then drags a low shot well wide. That was a decent chance.     4.05pm    47 min A reminder that the game will go extra-time and penalties if necessary. Quarter-final replays are so 2016.     4.04pm    46 min Peep peep! City begin the second half. No changes on either side.     3.51pm    \u201cCity would gladly pay \u00a32 million a match to keep anyone emailing this MBM off their team sheet,\u201d says Zach Neeley. \u201cI wonder how many matches it would take me to score a goal with City? Teams would quickly start ignoring me with good reason but I still have to get the ball past a world-class keeper, so maybe low 300s?\u201d If they gave you chances like this, you\u2019d find a way.      3.49pm    Half-time reading      3.49pm   Half time: Southampton 1-1 Manchester City  What an excellent half of football. Southampton started well, went behind to a soft goal from Raheem Sterling and briefly looked in danger of being overwhelmed. But they dominated the latter part of the half and deservedly equalised through an own goal from Aymeric Laporte.   Updated at 3.58pm GMT    3.48pm    Stuart Armstrong, who has had a superb half, poked a fine through pass towards Elyounoussi on the right of the area. He shielded the ball from Steffen, turned and slid a low cross that was screwed into his own net by Laporte.     3.47pm   GOAL! Southampton 1-1 Man City (Laporte 45+2 og)  A deserved equaliser for Southampton! It\u2019ll be checked for offside but I think he\u2019s okay.   Updated at 3.53pm GMT    3.45pm    45 min Livramento\u2019s cross is headed well wide by Long. I think he got in Stuart Armstrong\u2019s way, or maybe Armstrong got in his way.     3.44pm    43 min A marvellous cross from Livramento - what a player he is - evades Long, who thinks he was pushed by Walker. Mike Dean disagrees. Southampton eventually win one corner, and then another. Ward-Prowse\u2019s second corner is only cleared as far as Romeu, 15 yards out. His shot on the bounce is well struck but straight at Steffen.     3.42pm    41 min \u201cRob dearest,\u201d says Mac Millings. \u201cIf anyone wants definitive proof that \u00a3300m is too much money for Haaland, I have performed the necessary calculations. Let\u2019s assume that your educated estimate of \u201875 goals before Christmas\u2019 is accurate, and let us therefore project 150 goals a season. Now, based on the fact that even I could score a goal for this City side, that would make me worth \u00a32m. Just have a quiet think about that.\u201d I\u2019ll have a think, but it might not be quiet.  Updated at 3.44pm GMT    3.39pm    39 min Cancelo manages to foul both Stuart Armstrong and Livramento with the same tackle. Ward-Prowse\u2019s free-kick is headed away by Rodri.      3.36pm    36 min Rodri picks up a loose ball in midfield, moves to within 25 yards of goal and hits a low drive that swerves just wide of the far post. Mike Dean gave a corner, so maybe it took a slight deflection; either way it was very close.     3.35pm    35 min The indefatigable Long presses Laporte to win a throw-in on the right. Stephens\u2019 long throw skims off the head of Cancelo and runs through to Steffen.     3.34pm    34 min Salisu is fine.     3.33pm    33 min Salisu falls awkwardly after an aerial challenge with Grealish. There\u2019s a break in play while he receives treatment.     3.32pm    31 min Southampton are picking their moments to press. They\u2019ve done well to stay in the game because City have been sharp in attack.     3.28pm    27 min: Gundogan hits the post! Grealish breaks infield from the left, uses Cancelo by not using him and then does use him on the outside with a short pass. Cancelo absolutely hammers a cross that is diverted onto the near post by Gundogan in the six-yard box. I haven\u2019t seen a replay but my impression is that, rather than it being a bad miss, Gundogan did well to control the shot at all given the pace of Cancelo\u2019s cross.    Updated at 3.36pm GMT    3.26pm    26 min \u201c\u00a3300m isn\u2019t too much money for Haaland when you factor in the total cost for Pogba which was around 220 million, with basic salary that is,\u201d says Yash Gupta. \u201cBut considering how poor City were when they made an offer of \u00a375m + \u00a325m for Kane, I expect \u00a325m + Scott Carson would do for Mino Raiola, best player in the world.\u201d You lost me at Scott Carson.   Updated at 3.31pm GMT    3.24pm    24 min Adam Armstrong misses an excellent chance! Stuart Armstrong slipped a good pass infield to Long, who moved forward and played it to the other Armstrong in the area. He controlled it well on the stretch - it wasn\u2019t a great ball from Long - but then sliced well wide from 15 yards.  Updated at 3.25pm GMT    3.21pm    22 min The impressive Livramento plays a one-two with Stuart Armstrong and puts in a cross that is cleared by Jesus.  Updated at 3.25pm GMT    3.20pm    20 min Livramento wins a 50/50, not for the first time today, and curves an early ball around Laporte towards Adam Armstrong. Laporte shows good pace to stay with Armstrong and knock the ball back to Steffen.  Updated at 3.25pm GMT    3.19pm    19 min Southampton started well but they have struggled since the goal and are in danger of being hypnotised by City\u2019s rhythmic passing.      3.17pm    17 min A poor pass from Romeu is nicked by De Bruyne. He plays it to Jesus, who turns and thrashes over from the edge of the area. City look in the mood.   Updated at 3.23pm GMT    3.15pm    15 min A brilliant stat on the BBC. This is the 28th time this season that Manchester City have scored the first goal; they\u2019ve won all of the previous 27.     3.14pm    14 min The City fans appeal optimistically for a penalty when Jesus turns into Salisu in the area. Mike Dean isn\u2019t interested.     3.13pm   GOAL! Southampton 0-1 Manchester City (Sterling 12)  Raheem Sterling gives City the lead after a mistake from Jack Stephens. He failed to clear De Bruyne\u2019s cross properly, instead diverting it meekly to Jesus in the area. He squared it to Sterling, who slid the ball past Forster from 10 yards. Replays show that Sterling\u2019s shot - which was straight at Forster - took a slight but vital touch off the stretching Livramento.    Updated at 3.17pm GMT    3.11pm    10 min: Adam Armstrong hits the post! So close for Southampton. Romeu opened City up with a lovely through pass towards Armstrong, who made an excellent run from left to right. He screwed a first-time shot back across Steffen, not the cleanest strike, and it hit the inside of the far post.  Updated at 3.24pm GMT    3.09pm    9 min Sterling misses a decent chance. De Bruyne\u2019s pass from the left was intended for Sterling but ran through to Gundogan instead. He made 25 yards and then played in Sterling on the left side of the area. He watched the ball across his body but sliced it wide of the near post with his left foot. The angle was fairly tight; even so, he should probably have worked Forster.     3.07pm    7 min The first bit of pressure from City. De Bruyne marches infield from the right and has a low left-footed shot blocked by a defender, Stephens I think.     3.05pm    5 min Sterling\u2019s 20-yard curler is comfortably saved to his left by Forster.     3.04pm    4 min Long almost has a chance after a strong run through midfield from Stuart Armstrong. He laid it square to Long, who couldn\u2019t take the ball in his stride on the edge of the area and was eventually tackled by Laporte. Southampton have started well.  Updated at 3.24pm GMT    3.03pm    3 min \u201cShane Long?!\u201d says Rachel Clifton. \u201cWhy?\u201d Off-the-ball running I guess; plus he\u2019s been a part of the FA Cup team for most of the season. But yes, I did expect Adams and Broja to start rather than Long and Armstrong.     3.01pm    2 min City have started with Grealish as their false nine. Jesus is on the right, Sterling to the left.     3.00pm    1 min Peep peep! Southampton kick off from left to right. City are in their very very very very very very very very dark blue third kit.     2.58pm    The players stroll out of the tunnel, into the sunshine. It\u2019s a lovely day in Southampton, and you\u2019ll be pleased to hear that Ralph Hasenhuttl is wearing his waistcoat.     2.57pm    \u201cGiven City\u2019s reluctance to pay the \u00a3150m that would by all accounts have prised Kane away from Spurs it is nonsense to suggest they would pay double that for a 21-year-old who doesn\u2019t actually suit the Guardiola style,\u201d says Rick Harris. \u201cThere was a brief period last year when I thought the Solskjaer connection might bring him to Old Trafford, but I reckon Bayern will see him as the natural successor to Lewandowski and for a player comfortable in the Bundesliga that would be the more obvious destination for Haaland.\u201d Isn\u2019t \u00a3300m the total package rather than the fee? I have no idea where he\u2019ll end up, though I\u2019d be loath to rule City out.     2.50pm    Here\u2019s Barney Ronay\u2019s report on a mismatch at Selhurst Park      2.43pm    \u201cFor all the City-need-a-real striker chat,\u201d begins Zach Neeley, \u201cthey\u2019ve won three of the last four titles, were fiddling and a broken bone in the face of their best player from a European title last year, and the team that\u2019s the difference from them strolling to five leagues in a row also doesn\u2019t have a real striker. Maybe strikers are overrated! (Not for me, I\u2019m an Arsenal fan, getting desperate.)\u201d I agree with pretty much everything you say, but equally I can\u2019t see how it harms City if Haaland turns up and scores 75 goals before Christmas.     2.18pm    Be very afraid      2.11pm    We know two of the semi-finalists already. Chelsea went through yesterday and will be joined by Crystal Palace, who are hammering Everton at Selhurst Park.      2.09pm    The teams in formation Southampton (4-2-2-2) Forster; Livramento, Stephens, Salisu, Walker-Peters; Romeu, Ward-Prowse; S Armstrong, Elyounoussi; Long, A Armstrong.Substitutes: Caballero, Valery, Perraud, Diallo, Smallbone, Redmond, Djenepo, Adams, Broja. Manchester City (4-1-2-3) Steffen; Walker, Stones, Laporte, Cancelo; Rodri; De Bruyne, Gundogan; Jesus, Sterling, Grealish.Substitutes: Carson, Ake, Zinchenko, Bernardo, Fernandinho, Mahrez, Foden.  Updated at 3.24pm GMT    2.07pm         2.00pm   Team news  FA Cup specialist Shane Long, 35, gets a rare start up front for Southampton. That\u2019s one of four changes from last weekend\u2019s defeat against Watford. Tino Livramento, Jack Stephens and Alan Armstrong also come in, with Romain Perraud, Will Smallbone, Che Adams and Jan Bednarek dropping out. All bar Bednarek are on the bench.  Pep Guardiola also makes four changes from the Manchester City side that drew with Crystal Palace on Monday. Zack Steffen, Ilkay Gundogan, Gabriel Jesus and Raheem Sterling replace Ederson, Bernardo Silva, Phil Foden and Riyad Mahrez. City have only named seven substitutes from a possible nine.   Updated at 2.19pm GMT    2.00pm         2.00pm   Preamble  Thoughts with Manchester City at this difficult time. Usually at this stage of the season they are chasing a quadruple. This year it\u2019s merely a treble \u2013 but it\u2019s the Treble, a potential upgrade on their domestic hat-trick of 2018-19. If all goes to plan they have another 17 games remaining \u2013 nine in the league, five in the Champions League and three in the FA Cup.  The first of those is an awkward trip to Southampton, who, like City, reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup last season. They\u2019re an impressive side, superbly coached by Ralph Hasenhuttl, and are chasing a more modest treble \u2013 three games against Manchester City in one season without defeat. Both Premier League matches were drawn, but today there has to be a winner. If Ralph denies Pep a third time, he gets to keep him. Kick off 3pm.   "

                    "body": "When Caroline Weir came off the bench in the first of back-to\u2011back Manchester derbies three weeks ago and found herself, six minutes later, in an almost identical position to the one the Manchester City midfielder was in for her Puskas award\u2011nominated chip last year, it was all instinct. \u201cAt practice, when I see that area just outside the box, on that angle, it\u2019s subconscious that I always try a little dink,\u201d the 26-year-old says. \u201cI try it in training and in every match-day warm-up, in the shooting. It\u2019s something I practise a lot so when I tried it again, I wasn\u2019t overly surprised. They definitely don\u2019t all come off.\u201d  This one did \u2013 another spectacular goal sinking Manchester United in the Women\u2019s Super League \u2013 and City followed that by coming from behind to beat the same opponents 4-1 in the FA Cup. Weir scored again and it points to solid preparation for Saturday\u2019s Continental League Cup final against Chelsea at a sold-out Plough Lane. There was a lot of emotion in the first of those two wins. It ensured City remain in the hunt for a place in next season\u2019s Champions League after the first third of their campaign was derailed by injury. \u201cWe did an analysis session a few days ago and my goal was part of it,\u201d Weir says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t even watching my celebration, or the players that came to me \u2013 it was all the other players that were celebrating. Keira [Walsh] had done a knee slide to the City fans, Ellen [White] is just like this [arms aloft and screaming] in front of that whole stand behind the goal. \u201cThat\u2019s probably the best atmosphere I\u2019ve seen in our Academy Stadium, in terms of how many people were there and how noisy it was. We\u2019ve come such a long way, with Covid, and I think that made it extra special.\u201d  The poor start to the season, with six defeats between August and December, including being knocked out of Champions League qualifying, was \u201cchallenging\u201d, Weir says. \u201cThere was such a mix of things going on with injuries and fatigue from the Olympics. I definitely felt that not just physically but mentally, and I was one of the few players that was still fit. So, having to try and perform and get to the level when things weren\u2019t going so well was challenging. We just had to weather that storm and I think we did that.\u201d The manager, Gareth Taylor, and the tactics were queried by many outside the club. \u201cWe\u2019re all on social media, you can see things, but you\u2019ve got to ignore what\u2019s being said, and I don\u2019t think we brought that into our bubble at all to be honest,\u201d Weir says. \u201cOf course people are going to have their opinions and when results aren\u2019t going too well people will say certain things, but all we care about is coming into training and what happens within this building and actually it\u2019s quite easy to block everything else out because you\u2019re sticking together.\u201d That mentality brought the group closer. \u201cAs much as it\u2019s difficult at the time, it does make you stronger as a team. It is a cliche that the harder moments you learn more from but you actually do. We knew it was a matter of time, of getting everyone fit and of still focusing on what it is we want to do. So training properly, sticking to how we want to play, the manager believing in what it is we want to do, and everyone being on board with that. So that\u2019s what we did. And hopefully we are on a better path now and can finish the season strong.\u201d Although the cup final is next, every game is a cup final, with City needing to not drop points to stay in the hunt for third. \u201cNo matter who we play now, we need to win,\u201d says Weir. \u201cIt just so happens that the next game is a cup final. It\u2019s all about keeping this momentum. There\u2019s no better way to do that than go and win a final.\u201d  Beating Chelsea to swing momentum behind that push will not be easy. City have lost twice to the Continental Cup holders in the league this season, a bruising 4-0 in November and 1-0 last month. \u201cThat November game feels like a long time ago,\u201d says Weir, a Scotland international. \u201cWe\u2019re in a totally different place now. Even just the number of players we have available now is so much bigger, which is a huge bonus.\u201d Since returning from injury in January Weir has started three times and begun four matches on the bench, including both derbies. \u201cYou want to be starting games, especially the big ones,\u201d she says. \u201cAt the same time, you\u2019ve got to respect the manager\u2019s decision and wait for your opportunity.  \u201cI think, maybe up until the last few games, I\u2019m probably one of the least impactful subs you can have, just because of the type of player I am: I need the ball, I need to kind of find a rhythm within the game. Usually that comes from being on the pitch from the start. But the last few games I have managed to impact games and score and help the team. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s something I want to do all the time but if that\u2019s the position I\u2019m in on a match day then you\u2019ve just got to make the best of it when you get your chance.\u201d"

                    "body": "Kim Little said Arsenal\u2019s Champions League performances were \u201cnot good enough\u201d in the first half of the season but that the team are a different beast going into their quarter-final first leg against Wolfsburg under the lights at the Emirates Stadium on Wednesday.  Arsenal scraped into the last eight on head-to-head goal difference with Hoffenheim after twice losing heavily against the reigning champions, Barcelona \u2013 4-1 in Spain and 4-0 at the Emirates. The team also endured a surprising 4-1 defeat at Hoffenheim in their final group game. \u201cOur performances have been much better in the last two months and the results have followed that,\u201d Little said. \u201cTowards the end of last year our performances in the Champions League weren\u2019t good enough and we need to be mindful of that.\u201d Arsenal nosedived after defeat by Chelsea in the FA Cup final and the second loss against Barcelona ruptured momentum. Jonas Eidevall\u2019s side lost three of their next four games before a 90th-minute equaliser from Tobin Heath against Manchester City in the league restored some confidence. \u201cI think we were disappointed with both our results against Barcelona and mostly our performance,\u201d Little said. \u201cOur results told one picture, but I think we all know as individuals we didn\u2019t perform how we wanted. Tomorrow we\u2019ll be braver and more proactive and learn from that experience so that when it comes to these slightly different games we\u2019ll make sure we turn up and perform to our best, which is what will be required.\u201d Since the 1-1 draw with City, Arsenal have won seven games and drawn two, against Manchester United and their title rivals Chelsea. That run, boosted by the return of injured players and the January signings, has ensured the team remain in the hunt in three competitions. But Eidevall cautioned that just taking part is not enough.  Sign up for our new and free women\u2019s football newsletter  \u201c[We need to] be present, to take our chances,\u201d the manager said. \u201cIt\u2019s great that we\u2019re in the position we are in, in three competitions, but we have to understand that at a club like Arsenal that\u2019s not enough. We want to win trophies, that\u2019s what we need to push for and that\u2019s when we can be happy with results. That\u2019s what separates the big clubs from the smaller clubs.\u201d Wolfsburg are not Barcelona but they are a strong team and have huge Champions League pedigree, having reached five of the past nine finals, winning twice. \u201cWolfsburg is a top team, of course, but we play against top teams in the league: Chelsea and Manchester City are also top European teams, with their squads,\u201d Eidevall said. \u201cBarcelona has been an anomaly. Wolfsburg has a lot of fluidity. They are very, very good on the counterattack and we haven\u2019t played a team so far this season that has been that good on the counter. At the same time, I don\u2019t think they have been exposed to our style of football either. \u201cI believe in being proactive. If we set our gameplan right, then they should be changing to deal with our style.\u201d  The removal of the away\u2011goals rule this season helps attacking and proactive football, Arsenal\u2019s Swedish coach believes. \u201cNow it\u2019s easier, it\u2019s less challenging for the brain: be as good as you can over 180 minutes,\u201d Eidevall said. \u201cOne of the better things with getting rid of away goals is you can keep attacking at home. If you\u2019re winning 2-0 you can go for the third but before, you knew that you could be opening yourself up if you were too offensive. So hopefully we see more attacking football.\u201d"

                    "body": "Repudiating any suggestion Manchester City are having a wobble, Pep Guardiola has declared his pride at what his team have already achieved this season and urged them to enjoy the run-in as they pursue trophies on three fronts. City\u2019s lead over Liverpool at the top of the Premier League has been trimmed from 14 points to one and they have failed to score in their past two matches in all competitions, a drought by their standards. On Sundaythey face a testing FA Cup sixth-round tie at particularly pesky opponents, with Southampton having drawn with them twice in the league this season. Guardiola says he wants his players to relish the high stakes.  \u201cThese are the moments why we are here,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is why we watched the Champions League draw together [on Friday]. We have fought since pre-season to arrive here. It makes me happy. Everyone wants to win already but the run we have been on to be where we are now makes me so proud. My expectations are so high but, at the same time, during the process I am satisfied. \u201cWe went to Peterborough [in the last round of the FA Cup] and we won and now we are going to Southampton. I congratulate the players and say \u2018well done, good job\u2019. Because I know how difficult it is. \u201cI try to say to the club \u2018enjoy these moments during the season. Don\u2019t wait to win the Premier League, the Champions League or the FA Cup to be happy. Enjoy the day, enjoy the moment. \u201cLike in Europe, enjoy being one of the elite clubs. Because one day maybe you will not be here. You will be out of the Champions League at the group stage or the last 16. Qualifying for the Champions League is difficult. People who believe you have to do that are wrong, that is a bad, bad message. Staying in the Champions League is a huge success, enormous. People say \u2018no\u2019 but you have to do a lot of good things to get there.\u201d Guardiola said there is no reason for him or his players to worry about their 0-0 draw with Crystal Palace in their last outing. \u201cDropping points against Palace can happen. People believe \u2013 I don\u2019t know why \u2013 that because we\u2019re Manchester City we have to be 10 points clear of Liverpool. I don\u2019t buy it. I know how difficult it is. How we behaved against Palace and how we will behave against Southampton, that\u2019s what counts. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to find explanations for something for which there is no explanation. One day a player puts the ball in the top corner from 20 yards, another day he misses the goal from five metres. Why? Because it\u2019s football. Don\u2019t find explanations for that.\u201d Guardiola does, however, have an explanation for why Southampton have managed to frustrate his team twice this season, drawing 0-0 at the Etihad in September and 1-1 at St Mary\u2019s in January. \u201cBecause they are good,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are one of the intense teams, the rhythm they play with, their quality, their manager, their players.\u201d That manager, Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl, would pay to watch Sunday\u2019s opponents and is looking forward to taking them on. Regardless of the result, he expects to learn something. \u201cYou take massive things out of his games,\u201d the Austrian said of Guardiola. \u201cWhen you can imagine about a challenge for a manager, this is the biggest one definitely.  \u201cHopefully we see a really good Cup game and I am sure we will because it is two teams that want to play football, two teams that want to create chances, that are looking for an intense way of playing football. \u201cThey are so fantastic to watch \u2013 if I was a football fan, I would go there for sure.\u201d"

                    "body": "Best player Nick Ames Because he deserves the recognition: Son Heung-min. This was not Harry Kane\u2019s finest season, despite a big uptick in its second half, but Son\u2019s brilliance ensured that ultimately mattered little. Mohamed Salah had looked nailed on for this until the last couple of months and still needs mentioning, as does Kevin De Bruyne; his performance at Wolves, which I was fortunate to report on, was mindblowing and an already supreme Manchester City are transformed when he is at his best. Gregg Bakowski De Bruyne. It looked like Salah would be a shoo-in halfway through the season but the Manchester City midfielder has been talismanic in the run-in, dragging his team kicking and screaming over the line with some supreme performances. A tip of the hat to Son, too. John Brewin De Bruyne. In a season of no completely overriding star, he was the best player in the best team. Michael Butler De Bruyne. The best midfielder in the world and the best player in the Premier League. He is more than the sum of his stats, though only five players scored more than his 15. Ben Fisher Flip of a coin between Salah and De Bruyne. Sadio Man\u00e9 has equally had an extraordinary season, for club and country. Barry Glendenning Salah continues to amaze with his consistent excellence for Liverpool. Daniel Harris De Bruyne. Needs to do more in Europe to be ranked alongside the greatest but is the standout player in England and has been for years \u2013 even when people thought Eden Hazard was. Andy Hunter Salah. More goals than any other Premier League player apart from Son, more assists than any other Premier League player and in phenomenal form for most of the campaign. Had to deal with two major disappointments at international level plus the distraction of his contract saga. David Hytner Salah. Joint-top scorer, top assister. Thrillingly unplayable at times.  Jamie Jackson De Bruyne. Imperious. Majestic. Gamechanging. Cool-as-the-proverbial. The Belgian illustrated why he is City\u2019s big cheese by leaving his very best until the campaign\u2019s killer phase. This was crowned by the pinpoint cross that created the Ilkay G\u00fcndogan winner versus Aston Villa that sealed the title. Jonathan Liew Salah and De Bruyne have been brilliant in parts. But Jo\u00e3o Cancelo has been brilliant for a whole season, all over the pitch. A unique, underrated player. Sachin Nakrani De Bruyne. Salah was the standout candidate in the first half of the season but his form and output significantly declined in the new year and, ultimately, it\u2019s hard to look past De Bruyne. The best player for the best team, who also delivered the best individual display of the season away to Wolves in the run-in. Barney Ronay Son. Began the season trying to work out what, if anything, Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo wanted him to do, ended it with as many goals as Salah. Gareth Bale got a \u00a390m move by playing like this. Jacob Steinberg De Bruyne had a slow start by his standards but he was exceptional after shaking off an ankle problem. His assist for G\u00fcndogan\u2019s title-winning goal was an example of a big-game player showing up for his team when the pressure was at its peak. Will Unwin De Bruyne. Dragged City to the title by inspiring them in tight games, as well as hitting four goals against Wolves.  Best manager NA Antonio Conte\u2019s feat in heaving Tottenham to the Champions League was quite something, even if their competition was not the strongest. Thomas Frank did brilliantly to guide Brentford to mid-table and fans of ninth-placed Brighton should be aware just how lucky they are to have Graham Potter, who should be a serious contender for any top job. Mikel Arteta did well to change the feel around Arsenal, and Eddie Howe can be acclaimed for his work at Newcastle if not his ability to answer questions about the deeply sinister side of the club\u2019s ownership. GB J\u00fcrgen Klopp. He rotated his squad brilliantly to get Liverpool back into the title race despite losing Salah and Man\u00e9 to Afcon. That he did so while making it to the final of the three other cup competitions truly is remarkable. JB Conte. When it came to the top-four battle, Conte\u2019s experience told against Arteta, still a relative fledgling. Why Manchester United thought Conte, a born winner, was a bad idea speaks only to the self-interest of those who decided they couldn\u2019t face being confronted by his demand for better. MB Potter has coached Brighton to their record points total, five points from a European place. Amazing what a trendy new beard and turtleneck can do. BF  Howe has transformed Newcastle in six months. It is easy to point to their January business and the ability to shell out almost \u00a3100m as the obvious gamechanger but he has revitalised players whose careers had gone stale, none more so than Joelinton, and gelled a squad that ended up nestling in mid-table. Only Manchester City, Liverpool and Tottenham have won more points this calendar year. Thomas Frank and Potter deserve a place on the podium for helping their teams punch above their weight. BG Frank has done an excellent job at Brentford on their long-awaited return to the top flight and it will be intriguing to see whether they kick on or struggle in what could be a difficult second season. DHa Klopp. No one else could do what he does with the players he has. More than that, though, he is a man of honesty and integrity who understands the importance of football to the people, but also that good football is no substitute for good values. The same cannot be said of all his rivals. AH Klopp. His team played every game it was possible to play this season, winning both domestic trophies and taking Manchester City to the wire in the title race despite being 14 points adrift in January. A third Champions League final appearance in five seasons awaits. No wonder Liverpool\u2019s owners pounced with a four-year contract extension as soon as he mentioned he was open to the idea of extending a great era.  DHy I want to look beyond the top two, for success relative to means, so step forward Potter, who got Brighton to ninth on a net spend of \u00a315m, playing with a clear identity. Measured and assured face of the club. JJ Pep Guardiola. Four titles in his opening six years at Manchester City is a far better ratio than, say, the great Sir Alex Ferguson, who returned zero in the same span. We are witnessing him take football into a new zone of excellence. The fun is where the likable Catalan may leave it when he is finally finished in England. JL Klopp, not just for cajoling a tiring squad through four gruelling competitions but for his moral leadership in a game that badly needs it. SN Frank. Having achieved top-flight status for the first time in 74 years, Brentford were meant to be immediately relegated. Instead they finished 13th. In large part that was down to the tactical acumen and motivational skills of their manager, who pulled off a masterstroke by bringing Christian Eriksen to the club in January. A hugely impressive achievement by a man who also has the best hair in the division.  BR Frank. Super-smart micro-management on a tiny budget. Changed the way his team play in mid-season. Agreeable groovy-uncle-who-used-to-live-in-Ibiza persona. JS While Norwich and Watford sunk without a trace after winning promotion Frank performed wonders to keep Brentford up. They had their wobble but the signing of Eriksen was an inspired gamechanger. Brentford were a different team after adding Eriksen and safety was secured with relative ease. WU Patrick Vieira. The Frenchman transformed Crystal Palace\u2019s style and improved their league position in one season. When other clubs talk of needing seasons to turn things around, Vieira proves what can be done.  Best goal NA Should it be Salah\u2019s scintillating solo goal against Manchester City or the equally good effort, albeit against inferior opposition, in their following match at Watford? Having been there for the latter, it gets my pick: a methodical weave through three defenders, leaving the final one on his backside, still defies belief. GB Salah against City. He was surrounded when he received the ball but after a delicious roll of his foot to bamboozle Bernardo Silva, he tricked his way into the box, past Aymeric Laporte and fired across Ederson from an acute angle with his weaker foot. To do it against the champions in such an important game made it all the more impressive. JB Salah v Manchester City. He faded a little as the season went on but there was a point in early season when Salah looked the best player in the world. This was his Messi moment. MB Thiago Alc\u00e2ntara\u2019s fizzing daisy cutter for Liverpool against Porto in the Champions League still makes me gawp, but domestically you probably can\u2019t look past Salah against City. Ten perfect touches against the best team in the league. No notes. BF R\u00faben Neves v Watford, for the sheer audacity of it. The Wolves midfielder, who looks set to depart this summer, nudged the ball into the 18-yard box and then looped a cheeky chip shot over Ben Foster and into the far corner. BG I have been relentlessly pilloried for suggesting on Football Weekly that Ethan Pinnock\u2019s tap-in for Brentford against Liverpool in September would be among the goals of the season but it ended a wonderfully clever training-ground move from a free-kick against one of the league\u2019s best defences in one of the games of the season, so I\u2019m sticking to my guns.  DHa Salah, Liverpool v Man City. A blur of skill, speed composure and chutzpah, in the best game of the season. AH Salah v Manchester City. He must have been the only person inside Anfield who thought a goal was possible when receiving the ball from Curtis Jones. Astonishing belief and technique. DHy No contest this season \u2013 it is Salah v City. JJ Rodri versus Aston Villa. His seventh of the term is given the vote because of how vital it was and how unlikely the scorer was. City had been reeling at 2-0 down before G\u00fcndogan pulled one back with 14 minutes left. One hundred and twenty seconds later came the sweetest of long-range finishes, Rodri somehow threading the ball beyond Robin Olsen. It was an equaliser that told the rest of the Spaniard\u2019s team, the Etihad Stadium and Liverpool who would take the crown. JL Not Premier League but Bersant Celina for Ipswich v Crewe in November. Controls a long ball with his laces, immediately chips the keeper from 25 yards. It\u2019s pretty good. SN Salah v Manchester City. The turn away from Cancelo, the skip past Silva, the twisting of Laporte and, finally, the unstoppable finish past Ederson \u2013 what Salah did against City in October was as beautiful as it was jaw-dropping. No other goal came close \u2026 except perhaps the remarkably similar one Salah scored against Watford 13 days later. BR Manuel Lanzini\u2019s lay-up volley against Crystal Palace. One of those moments where you see suddenly that elite footballers at that level are just wired differently. JS I have a weakness for a left-footed winger cutting in from the right, dribbling past a load of defenders and finishing off the move with a stunning finish. So it will have to be Salah\u2019s goal against City at Anfield.  WU Bernardo Silva v Aston Villa. It would be hard to find a better technical finish. A superb first-time side-foot volley into the top corner. Best match NA Choosing strictly from games I covered: Watford 4-1 Manchester United, back in November. Weirdly, I never seem to catch a bad game at Vicarage Road. This one was rattling good fun throughout, Watford running all over an awful United but almost being pulled back before two late goals that confirmed the end of Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s reign. For the briefest of moments it seemed Claudio Ranieri might, by contrast, be feted for his contribution to the Hornets. GB Liverpool 2-2 Manchester City. You won\u2019t see many better second halves. It was evident then that the two sides were head and shoulders above the rest. A thriller of the highest quality. JB Everton 3-2 Crystal Palace. Never mind the quality of the top two, feel the chaos of a team playing for their lives. How did Frank Lampard engineer Everton\u2019s escape? Nobody can be quite sure but a return to 1990s Dogs of War values had something to do with it. MB Sunday\u2019s game at the Etihad was OK, I guess. BF How things unravelled on the final day at the Etihad Stadium takes some beating. Otherwise, Brentford\u2019s opener against Arsenal under the lights. BG Brentford 3-3 Liverpool demonstrated the fearlessness of the newly promoted Bees during a match in which Frank\u2019s side threw the kitchen sink at their exalted visitors. DHa Liverpool 2-2 Man City. Great tempo, loads at stake and the highest standard of football we saw, by far. AH Everton 3 Crystal Palace 2 The atmosphere, the comeback and the stakes combined to make this one of the great nights at Goodison Park. A special place that will be sorely missed when it\u2019s gone.  DHy Liverpool 2-2 Man City. The return fixture at the Etihad, which finished the same way, was written up in some quarters as the greatest game of all time. It was not even the best between the clubs this season. The Anfield showdown had it all (apart from a winner): the goal of the season, individual excellence, mesmeric skill, gutsy fightbacks and drama until the last. JJ Manchester City 2-2 Liverpool 2. Wowee. This may be the finest contest witnessed by this writer for encompassing two supremely matched foes with Nth-degree technical and creative abilities. The two sides occupy a different plane to their domestic rivals. JL Leicester 2-3 Tottenham. Everyone remembers the two late goals, but a superb encounter throughout, with rousing displays from James Maddison and Kane. SN Liverpool 2-2 Manchester City. The two best sides delivered the two most high-quality games, the one at Anfield the pick of the pair. City were incredible in the first half but Liverpool hung in and made it a thrilling tussle in the second half, during which four goals were scored, including Salah\u2019s one of stunning skill and composure. BR Manchester City 3-2 Aston Villa. Are you not entertained? JS The barmiest game I attended was easily Brentford\u2019s thrashing of Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. It seemed like a routine afternoon after Antonio R\u00fcdiger finally ended his ridiculous quest for a long-range goal. Then Brentford came roaring back. Ivan Toney was inspired up front and there was the fairytale of Eriksen scoring his first goal back in the Premier League. Chelsea were stunned. It was the start of their post-sanctions blip.  WU Burnley 3-2 Everton. The stakes were so high and the Clarets turned the game around. Turf Moor was rocking and it brought hope that Burnley could stay up. Best signing NA Brentford\u2019s flying start was a fading memory by late February. They could hardly stop losing and, make no mistake, were going down unless things turned around quickly. Enter Eriksen, the very fact of whose comeback was one of the season\u2019s best stories. In the event Eriksen\u2019s return offered much more than a feelgood glow: he was extraordinarily influential in his 10 starts, adding the craft and composure Brentford lacked. They only lost two of those games, sailed to survival and now sweat on retaining a player who is again sought by the big boys. GB Marc Cucurella has been a revelation for Brighton after joining from Getafe for \u00a315m. Skilful, fast and with wonderful passing ability, he has been a brilliant outlet at left-back and to impress in a mid-table team is no mean feat. No wonder Manchester City and Chelsea are interested. JB Eriksen. It was a risk, and one taken only on careful medical advice, but beyond the romance of Eriksen all but coming back from the dead, he soon re-established himself as one of the best players in the Premier League. MB Some players just kick a football differently, and Eriksen is one. Turned Brentford from efficient Moneyballers into something nice to look at, in a league they have no right to be in. BF Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1 has been superb for Wolves, a snip at \u00a37m from Olympiakos. Marc Gu\u00e9hi and Conor Gallagher have been excellent for Crystal Palace and must have a good shot at going to the World Cup. BG Bruno Guimar\u00e3es took a while to bed in after his arrival at Newcastle in January but he has quickly established himself as a firm favourite of a rejuvenated fanbase that is brimful of optimism. DHa Luis D\u00edaz. Generally speaking, a 50% hit-rate on transfers is respectable, which is to say the game may never have seen a run of successes remotely comparable to Liverpool\u2019s over the past few years. But even in that context D\u00edaz is special, a bionic ball of aggression and brilliance, apparently formed from barbed wire.  AH Eriksen. The Denmark international would be a worthy winner purely on a football level as a free signing who lifted a Premier League newcomer out of trouble through sheer quality. Given what he went through before arriving at Brentford, Eriksen\u2019s impact was nothing short of miraculous. DHy Conte. Took over at Spurs with the team looking broken in eighth. Turbo-charged them to a Champions League return with 17 wins and five draws from 28 games. JJ Dejan Kulusevski. Five goals in 18 league appearances since joining on loan from Juventus tells of why Conte is expected to make the 22-year-old winger a permanent Tottenham player. Shone when Spurs beat City 3-2 at the Etihad, scoring the opener. JL Look, anyone could see D\u00edaz was going to be a brilliant player. Cucurella, on the other hand, was a stunning find from Getafe, and one of Brighton\u2019s players of the season.  SN D\u00edaz. The Colombian wasn\u2019t cheap at \u00a337m but already looks excellent value for money. Fast, skilful, aggressive and hard-working, he has fit seamlessly into Klopp\u2019s side and contributed greatly to their charge on all fronts, with four goals and three assists in 13 Premier League appearances alone. Put money on him to be the 2022-23 player of the season. BR Mohammed Bin Salman. JS D\u00edaz couldn\u2019t quite get Liverpool over the line but signing the dazzling Colombian winger for \u00a337m was further evidence of their intelligence in the market. It helps to explain why Liverpool are ahead of Chelsea and Manchester United. WU Eriksen. The Dane has been superb since joining Brentford, pulling the strings in midfield. Sometimes we just need a good-news story. Worst flop NA Manchester United\u2019s wider environment has hardly been conducive to success but there was still much, much more expected of Jadon Sancho after his move from Borussia Dortmund. He is young and gifted enough to turn things around. Whatever the reasons and however suitable the fit, Romelu Lukaku also underperformed at Chelsea. And the Norwich sporting director, Stuart Webber, blotted his copybook badly, having done so much to abet their rise, by overseeing some poor recruitment and an inconsequential change of manager in a season that was supposed to see them consolidate but turned out abysmally. GB Rapha\u00ebl Varane. I know he\u2019s had injury problems but for \u00a334m I think Manchester United would have expected a bit more assurance from him when he has played. JB Ralf Rangnick. The German\u2019s reputation as an empire-builder, a Mr Fix It for ailing institutions, was mortally damaged by his inability to get any sort of tune out of Manchester United. The later weeks of his interim reign seemed to be spent defending that reputation. MB West Ham\u2019s Nikola Vlasic and Tottenham\u2019s Bryan Gil deserve a mention but it\u2019s difficult to look past Sancho as the standout candidate. In his defence, he does play for Manchester United. BF A serial winner, Varane was supposed to bring some calm to the chaos at Manchester United but his signing hasn\u2019t worked. Norwich can also lay claim to quite a few expensive mistakes. BG To paraphrase Sheriff May in No Country For Old Men, if the version of Manchester United Erik ten Hag is taking over ain\u2019t a mess, it\u2019ll do til a mess gets there. DHa Lukaku. Perhaps the worst finisher in the history of football to have scored as many goals as he has; there was no reason to think a brilliant season in Serie A had somehow improved the reliability of his touch. AH Manchester United. A club hopelessly adrift and in desperate need of leadership on and off the pitch. The team\u2019s performances were regularly shameful. DHy No specific names here, rather the collective at Manchester United. An absolute shambles, starting at the very top.  JJ Rangnick. The club\u2019s lowest Premier League points total (by six) of 58, a goal difference of zero, and Europa League football next season. What else is there to say? JL Lukaku. It\u2019s not just that he didn\u2019t score. At his worst \u2013 not fully fit, not fully satisfied, not fully mobile \u2013 he seemed to gum up the whole machine. SN Manchester United. In came Sancho and Varane, back came Cristiano Ronaldo, and with Ole at the wheel United were going to challenge for the title just like the old days. Instead they were a modern-day car crash that led to anger in the stands and Rangnick ageing 10 years in six months having been brought in as interim manager. A truly appalling season for the supposed biggest club in the world. BR A five-way tie between Sancho, Marcus Rashford, Bruno Fernandes, Harry Maguire and the entire concept, machinery and surviving infrastructure of \u201cManchester United\u201d. JS Lukaku is quite possibly going to go down as the biggest dud of the Roman Abramovich era. He cost \u00a397.5m, he earns loads, he gave Sky that interview and he doesn\u2019t fit Thomas Tuchel\u2019s style. There\u2019s no getting away from it: it\u2019s been a total bust. After all who could have imagined that the final day of the season would feature Chelsea leaving Lukaku on the bench while Ross Barkley earned them a 2-1 win over Watford?  WU Manchester United. They\u2019ve been terrible from top to bottom throughout the season. The managerial change has not worked and the players have embarrassed themselves. Things can only get better for them, surely? Biggest gripe NA The haste with which some clubs \u2013 and players \u2013 dashed to get into bed with shameless cryptocurrency and NFT companies, which monetise the concept of fan experience and offer the vast majority crumbs in exchange. The market is largely unregulated and the clubs in question are doing their fans a huge, potentially dangerous disservice: they should pull out of these deals straight away. Away from that, I\u2019m still not having VAR. GB The Premier League sanctioning the Saudi-led takeover of Newcastle. JB Crypto and NFTs. Who possibly could have predicted that John Terry\u2019s NFT apes would end up being worth not much more than a box of Panini football stickers? Football\u2019s taste for dirty cash continues to exceed itself. MB Leading questions in post-match interviews. Was that a result that your side deserved? Am I wasting my time listening to this? The answer is nearly always yes, and the guilty party is normally someone holding a Sky microphone with a name that sort of rhymes with pet peeves. BF The garish double-decker digital advertising hoardings that appear here to stay and, writing as one of the approximately one in 12 men who are colourblind, the lack of consideration when it comes to kit clashes. Shirt numbers are even harder to pick out and some games border on unwatchable. BG The mental gymnastics and often comical whataboutery on social media of some Newcastle fans, who claim not to see any difference between a Saudi tyrant\u2019s investment fund on the one hand taking ownership of their club and on the other buying shares in other businesses not steeped in more than a century of English football tradition. DHa We must never be blithe enough to ignore the human-rights-abusing owners of Manchester City and Newcastle but to focus on the actual game, the travesty of timekeeping is its biggest problem \u2013 and one that could be easily solved. There is no connection between the time applied at the ends of halves and the time lost or wasted during them, nor any reason for the laws not to be clear and standardised: the clock should stop when play stops and be on display for everyone to see. How long is left and why that long is left should not be a secret known only by the officials. AH FA Cup semi-finals at Wembley when there are no trains from the north-west to London \u2013 on an Easter weekend; \u201cPlease can I have your shirt?\u201d signs; the expansion of the Champions League; the OK to Saudi Arabia; a World Cup in Qatar; yes, there are quite a few.  DHy The way that some clubs appeared to play fast and loose with the Covid rules to force postponements when it suited them. JJ The \u201chilarious\u201d one-upmanship of fans. Dressed up as \u201cbanter\u201d and \u201cknockabout\u201d stuff this \u201cmy club is better than yours\u201d discourse is one never-ending borefest. JL Newcastle being bought by a murderous autocracy whose brutal war in Yemen has killed more than 90,000 people. It\u2019s not really a gripe, as such.  SN The Premier League allowing a takeover of Newcastle to occur that Amnesty International described as \u201can extremely bitter blow for human rights defenders\u201d and some of the club\u2019s supporters reacting to it by dancing with towels on their heads outside St James\u2019 Park and engaging in weapons-grade whataboutery on social media was a real low of the season. \u201cGripe\u201d probably doesn\u2019t cover it, to be honest. BR The Premier League, while great to watch, is simultaneously eating every other league in world football by stripping those contests of any serious meaning, thereby creating the desire for the Super League model that will inevitably consume the Premier League itself in a cycle of mutual assured death by greed. Besides that, probably the phrase, \u201che\u2019s going to the screen and we know what that means\u201d. JS Arsenal getting the north London derby called off when they had one Covid case. It felt like a cynical use of the rules, which are clearly not fit for purpose, but it ended up backfiring on Arteta\u2019s side. WU Cardboard signs asking for shirts \u2013 they are not cute. Go away. Although, if any professional footballer wants to send me a shirt, I do need a new one for five-a-side."

Five people in the UK discuss how rising bills are affecting them and the measures they are taking to try to keep warm. \u2018I can cope until the temperature gets to 13C indoors\u2019  It would not be unusual for Jo Love to have the heating on by now. The 64-year-old cleaner lives in a 200-year-old cottage in Pembrokeshire that gets damp easily, but this year she plans to hold out until the end of November. \u201cI can cope without heating until the ambient temperature gets to 13C [55.4F],\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s always moistness here and so when the house is not warm it gets damp.\u201d As a cleaner of holiday lets, Love\u2019s work is seasonal; her income dramatically decreases over winter. To withstand the cold in her home she is wearing a dressing gown, puffer jacket and hat indoors. \u201cI\u2019m going to try my absolute damnedest to not have it on,\u201d she says of the heating, adding that she is \u201ctaking it day by day\u201d. \u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to do is use as little energy now so when it\u2019s unbearable in January I can actually splash out \u2013 I will hopefully be able to build up credit. I\u2019ve decided to only watch one hour of TV in the evening and go to bed at 8.30pm. I\u2019ve never done anything like this before \u2013 it\u2019s insane.\u201d \u2018I was intending to retire, but I\u2019ve been rethinking that\u2019 Carol Ann Crawford, a 67-year-old dialect coach in Edinburgh, finds herself constantly watching the smart meter when she turns on an appliance. \u201cSome behaviour is probably sensible, like only filling the kettle with enough water for one cup,\u201d she says. \u201cThe TV uses up quite a lot, which I hadn\u2019t appreciated before.\u201d While Crawford would usually have the heating on by mid-September, this year she is planning to keep it off for as long as possible. \u201cIt really depends on the temperature \u2013 it\u2019s beginning to get quite cold in the evenings, I may have to have it on in a couple of weeks\u2019 time. I\u2019m frightened by the prospect of huge bills, although my account was \u00a3200 in credit last time I looked,\u201d she says. \u201cI am aware of the danger of frozen pipes as it gets colder. I\u2019m still working and I earn reasonably good money \u2013 but because everyone\u2019s so scared of the cost of fuel I think I\u2019ve got affected and find myself thinking about how I can economise. I was intending to retire soon but I\u2019ve been rethinking that.\u201d \u2018Even if I can afford it, cutting back a bit helps everyone\u2019  Richard Benson is aiming to get to December before he switches on the heating \u2013 unless there\u2019s a real cold snap before then. The 40-year-old company director in London says he is fortunate that the decision is \u201cnot a financial thing\u201d. \u201cI just don\u2019t see that it\u2019s the right thing to do \u2013 if everyone uses less, there will be less demand, prices won\u2019t be so high. Even if I can afford it, cutting back a bit helps everyone. I see it as the ultimate selfishness to not try to help a little bit,\u201d he says. Benson\u2019s two young children \u2013 a two-year-old and a three-month-old baby \u2013 are wrapped up in extra layers. \u201cThe baby has two babygrows, and if someone is not carrying him he has a blanket on top,\u201d he says. Benson wears four layers \u2013 vest, T-shirt, jumper and overshirt \u2013 at home. He explains that if his children catch a cough or the flu, his heating plan will go out of the window: \u201cI can\u2019t let my children stay unwell because I refuse to turn the heating on.\u201d \u2018I reluctantly decided to get a wood burner\u2019 David Coulthard, 58, from North Yorkshire, says he has reluctantly resorted to using a wood burner to heat his home and has bought \u00a3200 worth of wood. \u201cIt should last three months,\u201d he says, costing less than his heating bill for last January alone. \u201cOur electric bills in the past 12 months averaged about \u00a3140 a month but in the winter months they were approaching \u00a3250 and it just didn\u2019t seem right,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I decided to get a wood burner to heat the house more efficiently. I don\u2019t like using too much wood as it releases stored carbon into the atmosphere and particulates that contribute to air pollution but this year I don\u2019t see much of an option.\u201d He says he expects to have to put the heating on at some point, but is trying to hold out until the end of November. \u2018The damp goes into my knees like arrows\u2019 After her estimated bill \u201cleft her in shock\u201d, Ilona Hughes is delaying putting the central heating on in her one-bedroom flat in London, despite the effect on her health. The 52-year-old is disabled and suffers in the cold and damp. \u201cI\u2019ll have swelling in the knees, the pain goes up, the mobility goes down. \u201cI live under rugs anyway \u2013 although I\u2019m 52, I act as if I\u2019m a 99-year-old,\u201d she says. \u201cMy flat can get quite damp because it\u2019s a Victorian conversion. We\u2019ve got solid brick walls and you get a lot of condensation in the morning on the windows and it feels damp. The damp goes straight into my knees like arrows.\u201d She is relying on an electric convection heater to maintain the temperature in her bedroom \u2013 the smallest room \u2013 at 18C during the day. Hughes plans to keep the central heating off for as long as she can and is looking for different ways to stay warm. \u201cI have put a curtain over the bedroom and sitting room doors to keep heat in if I am using them. I really don\u2019t know how I will cope this winter \u2013 whether to use the central heating to protect my health and build up debt, or live in a state of misery.\u201d"

                    "body": "If there is anything that Emma Raducanu\u2019s career since her US Open triumph has reinforced beyond doubt, it is just how difficult the day-to-day grind of life as a professional tennis player is. The physical load each week is considerable, injury niggles are so common that few players are ever functioning at 100% and only the strongest maintain their spot at the top. For now, as expected, Raducanu has a long way to go. In the past week in Prague, her latest injury issues have been the blisters on her foot. A recap of how she has fared since the US Open is largely a long list of such setbacks. She endured illness in her final tournaments of 2021, her off-season was scuppered by Covid, blisters on her hand forced her to her hit one-handed backhand slices at the Australian Open, in February she had to retire in Monterrey after sustaining a hip injury and a stiff back followed in Indian Wells.  These are predictable obstacles for a player attempting to manage the physical demands of the top level despite barely even competing in the lower-level ITF tournaments, but they are also a common theme in Raducanu\u2019s young career. Part of the reason why the 19-year-old had played so few events compared to her peers even before last year is because she would continually be sidelined by injury niggles. Back at Wimbledon, Raducanu referred to the numerous small injuries she sustained that meant she could watch from the sidelines as her peers advanced up the rankings far more quickly than her. She described herself as a player who had \u201calways been sort of held back by something\u201d. Even as a grand slam title winner, that has not yet ceased. \u201cShe is still young, she hasn\u2019t completed a full year on tour yet,\u201d said Anne Keothavong, the captain of Great Britain\u2019s Billie Jean King Cup team in the Czech Republic. \u201cFor any young player going out there for the first time, what she has achieved has been exceptional. \u201cIt does take time to get used to life on the tour and become more robust. She certainly needs to become more robust. That is no secret. She knows that. She is working on it.\u201d Still, there is ample optimism. In Prague, for instance, Raducanu dug deep to escape with a 7-5, 7-5 win against the No 50, Tereza Martincov\u00e1, and record a first win in a clay-court match. While the frustration seemed to have taken a toll earlier in the year, Raducanu and her teammates seemed to really enjoy the team atmosphere and even if the quality is lacking compared to other nations, Keothavong has helped to cultivate a positive atmosphere.  Such is the nature of the tour, it stops for nobody. Raducanu was already straight on to a flight to Stuttgart in the morning for the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix, one of the toughest WTA events of the season. The tournament boasts seven of the top nine players. Although it remains to be seen how her foot will hold up, Raducanu was in the draw on Sunday. The past week was also notable for the absence of the Russian and Belarusian teams, the former team being the Billie Jean King Cup defending champions. As the tour continues to tick over, talks to determine whether the large contingent of Russian and Belarusian players will be allowed to compete at Wimbledon are still ongoing, said the Lawn Tennis Association chief executive, Scott Lloyd, in Prague. \u201cConversations with the government and indeed their counterparts in other countries are still ongoing,\u201d Lloyd said. \u201cThere is no definite position there, either. The government have given all sports guidance in terms of how we should try to work through some of these challenges, which range from a full ban to very robust declarations on behalf of individuals. \u201cWe need to try to work through what the impact and implications of trying to implement that guidance looks like. \u201cThis is something that we are working very closely with the All England Club on day-in, day-out right now.\u201d  Players potentially affected include the US Open champion Daniil Medvedev, the two-times major champion Victoria Azarenka, Aryna Sabalenka and Andrey Rublev, who all currently compete as neutral individuals. Unlike other sports in Russia, the top-ranked tennis players employ their own individual teams, live abroad and are not funded by the Russian or Belarusian states. \u201cIt is an enormously complex situation,\u201d Lloyd said. \u201cI think we are all aligned in finding the actions that we see in our papers and TV screens, it is absolutely abhorrent. In truth, the conversation is ongoing, we are in very close dialogue with the All England Club, the government, with the tours. We are very conscious of public sentiment in this area. We are trying to navigate what that needs to look like in the summer events in Britain this year.\u201d"

                    "body": "This was a useful England friendly. Depleted by mid-season twangs, degraded by a frustrating red card for Serge Aurier \u2013 who\u2019s still got it \u2013 and limited as a contest by the poverty of this Ivory Coast team; but there was good stuff here too, and a sense of two vital cogs in the Southgate universe clunking into place. One thing does seem certain after another controlled Wembley win. This is how it\u2019s going to go down. The shape, the pegs, the architecture of this team is set. We\u2019re going to play this out to the end.  It was a good game for Jude Bellingham, who was imperiously good at times, and might just have a chance of opening up that central midfield. And beyond that for two of the comfy chairs, the inherited mahogany sideboards, the tried and trusted internal fittings of this England team. Harry Maguire was booed by England\u2019s fans at the start. But he was steady, unobtrusive and very much the England version of himself. Raheem Sterling got the same treatment, more viciously, in the pre-Southgate years. Here he produced an eye-catching performance, restating, in timely fashion, his own credentials as the most decisive English attacking midfielder since, well, who? David Beckham? Gazza? David Platt? Beckham ended up with 42 assists for England, which is spectacular. But tot up the stats and Sterling has pretty much everyone else covered. He showed us why here. Half an hour into a fun, skittish, open game England\u2019s No 7 took the ball on the left inside the Ivory Coast penalty area. Faced by two crouched and coiled defenders, Sterling produced a lovely little miniature. It will be one of the ticks, the asterisks, the bold-underlines Gareth Southgate takes from this March double header. Here was a very basic reminder of the way England have won in the age of Gareth. Sterling used to take a lot of criticism. It is more nuanced now: his numbers are too good, his longevity unignorable. Instead the reservations are more to do with points of style, levels, ultimacy. Those who wish to criticise focus on the times when his basic technique can\u2019t keep pace with genuinely A-list movement and a fine nose for space. This is how Sterling plays. Here is a footballer who never stops, who keeps on coming, who gets knocked down, but always gets up again. And for England Sterling is a lock. The last six years have brought a gushing tap of attacking talent, a series of crowd favourites and coming men. But here was evidence, like it or not, that Kane-Sterling, Sterling-Kane, is up there with England\u2019s greatest ever attacking partnerships. And they\u2019re not done yet.  Southgate had picked a light, jazzy, pop-up team, set up in a 4-3-3. They probed in a meandering kind of way for the opening half hour. There were shrill cries every time Jack Grealish got the ball. It felt a little vague, fun, lightweight. And then Sterling did that brilliant thing. The move was started by Maguire, who stepped out of defence smoothly and funnelled the ball to the left, where it ended up at Sterling\u2019s feet. The Ivory Coast defence looked set, too close for a cross. Sterling had come to a halt. At which point he did something very difficult, beating Aurier (yes, OK) from a standing start, with a jink and a shift of feet and a lucky break of the ball, dribbling skills applied exactly where they can make a difference.  Sterling had made space for a cross now, but that also had to beat a man, a nutmeg assist in the tightest of spaces that found Ollie Watkins in the right spot to score. It was a wonderful assist, a genuine piece of goal-making drawing on the full palette of skills: the jink, the pass, the picture of those around him. And yes, it was against Ivory Coast, but it keeps on being against someone, every time. When Sterling scored England\u2019s second just before half time, prodding the ball home after Grealish had found him with a nice pass, it was his 17th goal to go with 13 assists in his last 29 England games. This is how teams win games. If these March dates have done anything it is to confirm this is still how Southgate will set up his tournament team eight months from now: solidity; more solidity; Kane, Sterling.  The idea is still out there that some more compelling version is hiding behind the relentless consistency of the best England team in a couple of generations. The cries of frustration will still be heard, based in the notion that were England to play to their attacking strengths instead of trying to control the game, to smear their face with woad, batter their chest and say, behold the attacking power of this fully operational England, then the world would be brought to heel. This is, of course, misjudged, based in vaguely grasped sporting exceptionalism, the idea that once the English unleash their inner Albion none can resist. France don\u2019t play like that, and their attacking players are better. Balance is everything. Qatar is already flickering on the desert horizon. For better or worse, this thing, this England iteration, is going to play right out to the end."

Real last won the competition in 2018, sealing a third consecutive triumph, while Ancelotti was the head coach who guided the club to their 10th success in 2014. Although the Italian said he and his team are happy to have reached the last four, the 62-year-old manager stated success in the competition for Real is to be in the final.  \u201cI think the history that Real Madrid has in this competition counts for a lot, more for us than opponents,\u201d Ancelotti said. \u201cThis history that has grown helps our players to feel the weight of the shirt, but it\u2019s a positive burden and responsibility to have that. \u201cFor Real Madrid, it\u2019s not a success to get to the semi-final, we feel it\u2019s a success to get to the final. Normally, if Real Madrid get to the final, there is more of a possibility to win it.\u201d Real, who have knocked out Paris Saint-Germain and the holders, Chelsea, in the past two rounds, have not played since an away win at Osasuna last Wednesday. City also played then and have done so again since \u2013 the 5-1 victory against Watford on Saturday. Ancelotti is unsure if this will aid his side, however.  \u201cIt is difficult to say but I think the players in this period [of the season] are used to playing every three days,\u201d Ancelotti said. \u201cThere\u2019s more risk of injuries [playing every three days] but to recover from one game to another, the players are used to doing that and it will be no problem. So I don\u2019t think we can take advantage of this.\u201d Ancelotti is sure that City will provide a tough test at the Etihad Stadium, before the return leg at the Bernab\u00e9u next week. \u201cWe need to play well. I think the fact the away goal rule has changed, means it will be a more open tie,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to play for 180 minutes and in this type of game there\u2019s a mix of happiness and joy, because you\u2019ve managed to get so close to the final in the most important competition in the world \u2013 and that worry of playing against such a strong team. \u201cWe have had really tough games, against all the teams who were favourites in this competition and it\u2019s gone well for us. We will fight again tomorrow.\u201d"

                    "body": "At 8.55pm last Wednesday, 10 minutes into the second half of Blackburn\u2019s Carabao Cup victory against Hartlepool, the Rovers season-ticket holder Hafiz Zayd was joined by about 100 fans as he led the Maghrib Salah, the penultimate of five daily prayers observed by Muslims, in a hospitality lounge at Ewood Park. Blackburn\u2019s multi-faith prayer room, located behind one of the goals, accommodates around 30 people, with supporters, stewards and kiosk staff all invited to make use of the facility. A few minutes later Dilan Markanday, a Sikh of Indian heritage and one of few South Asian players in the professional game, scored his first goal for the club. \u201cIt is really important that there are players from all different backgrounds and cultures, and that they get an opportunity to show their qualities,\u201d Markanday says.  For Markanday that goal was another landmark moment on a journey that has taken him from playing grassroots in Barnet, where he was born, to joining Tottenham aged 12, later training alongside Harry Kane, Son Heung-min and Gareth Bale and becoming the first South Asian to play for the club in a competitive game after making his debut last October. He signed for Blackburn in January and is determined to keep flying the flag for the South Asian community. Together with Zidane Iqbal of Manchester United and Hamza Choudhury, on loan at Watford from Leicester, the winger is among the 0.45% of professional players of South Asian heritage, according to data collected by the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association. Arjan Raikhy and Kamran Kandola are in the academies at Aston Villa and Wolves respectively. Last year the PFA launched the Asian Inclusion Mentoring Scheme to nurture talent and inspire the next generation, with senior professionals mentoring players such as Markanday, who can in turn help youngsters. \u201cThere has been a lot more light on the South Asian community growing and players coming through and I think that has really helped,\u201d Markanday says. \u201cA few people have said that they look up to me and I try and help by giving advice to the younger kids.\u201d  One of those is Adam Khan, a goalkeeper at Blackburn who was introduced to Markanday at the club\u2019s South Asian talent ID event in conjunction with the PFA that was attended by almost 70 youngsters this summer. \u201cHe came up to me and was like \u2018you\u2019ve really inspired me\u2019, which was really nice to hear from someone who is now at the club. It was brilliant seeing all the young kids have a smile on their face and all the families. It is important for the parents to see that the club is doing this and that something could come from it. A lot of young kids are scared of the numbers that come through. You always hear \u2018there is a less than 1% chance of making it\u2019. I think that is a big factor, having that belief.\u201d For Markanday, that belief stems from his family who attend most games. \u201cMy dad is the one who really pushed me. I turned up to trials at Tottenham and I\u2019d be asleep in the car saying I didn\u2019t want to go and he like dragged me inside. I\u2019m really grateful. Sometimes I get messages from family in India who I haven\u2019t even met and it is really nice to know they are looking out for me and that I have that wider network. I guess I\u2019ve had a bumpy road which people may not see from the outside because they just see the social media and that I\u2019m happy all the time, which is not always the case.\u201d  On Wednesday Khan, a first-year scholar who is of Pakistani heritage, and Riz Rehman, the PFA\u2019s player inclusion executive, will meet an Under-11 and Under-12 player at Blackburn, both of whom are of South Asian descent, to remind them that there is a pathway. Markanday will no doubt crop up in conversation. \u201cI think them seeing my journey is enough for them to see that it is possible and that they can go and do it,\u201d he says. \u201cThen when I speak to them, they really believe it. I can give them advice, tell them about my journey, the ups and the downs, and make sure that they understand what it takes to make it. It\u2019s just about keeping going, keeping believing and I want to push on this season now.\u201d The Championship leaders Blackburn, who visit Reading on Wednesday hoping to maintain their 100% start to the season, are a club in tune with their community. They recognise that more than 50% of children under 16 in Blackburn with Darwen are of South Asian heritage \u2013 and on Wednesday the English Football League will launch Together, a five-year equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI) strategy overseen by the EFL\u2019s head of EDI, David McArdle, who was appointed to the newly created role last November. The hope is that more follow their lead in ensuring the game is representative of the demographics it serves. Ewood Park also has halal and alcohol-free concourses. In May around 4,000 Muslims visited the stadium as Blackburn became the first club to host Eid prayers on their pitch to mark the end of Ramadan and last season the club launched Ewood Express, an initiative that helped bring more than 2,500 children to games by providing free buses to and from local mosques, schools and sports clubs, and also saw the club win the EFL\u2019s inaugural diversity award. \u201cIn the past the evening prayer may have stopped people from the community attending matches because they didn\u2019t think the two could marry up and that they could do both,\u201d McArdle says. \u201cBy Blackburn offering that service and that opportunity, it breaks down that barrier.\u201d A panel including representatives from Kick It Out, Women In Football, Level Playing Field and Pride Sports will formally launch the EFL\u2019s strategy \u2013 the Together motto has appeared on shirt sleeves since the beginning of this season \u2013 alongside governing bodies and clubs at the Valley, home of Charlton Athletic. Challenging discrimination in the stands and on social media is among the EFL\u2019s key aims. \u201cWe want to ensure we have a robust and 360-degree approach,\u201d says McArdle. \u201cNow the hard work begins to implement the changes we want to see.\u201d"

The highest combined xG in a match was at the Etihad on Boxing Day, when Manchester City beat Leicester 4.17-2.41. The combined xG was 6.58, the actual score 6-3 to Manchester City. The highest for one team was at Anfield in February, when Liverpool plugged Leeds 6-0. Their xG that night was a slightly frightening 5.36. That also led to the greatest disparity between xGs in a match this season: 5.15. The mathletes among you will be able to work out that Leeds\u2019 xG was 0.21.  That wasn\u2019t quite the lowest of the season, though. Cruelly, if not entirely against type, that dubious award goes to Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo\u2019s Tottenham Hotspur. When they lost 3-0 at Crystal Palace in mid-September, the game that started their collapse under Nuno, Spurs had an xG of just 0.07. While we\u2019re on the subject of shot-shyness, the match with the lowest combined xG took place on the same day. Brighton sneaked a 1-0 victory at Brentford, with Leandro Trossard\u2019s late winner an affront to both the home side and the statisticians: the combined xG for that game was 0.71 (Brentford 0.39-0.32 Brighton). The most wasteful performance of the season came from Manchester United, who drew 0-0 at home to Watford in February despite an xG of 3.19. And the most ruthless came across Manchester \u2013 when Manchester City had an xG of 3.25 against Leeds at the Etihad in December. Unlike United, they found a way to win: 7-0. Cup final debuts \u201cHas any player made their debut in a Cup final?\u201d asked John Tumbridge last week. \u201cNot including matches at the start of the season, like the Community Shield.\u201d Let\u2019s start with a couple of close efforts, including this one from Jack Hart. \u201cNot his full debut, but Ryan Bertrand made his European debut for Chelsea in the 2012 Champions League final. He didn\u2019t do badly, either. As mentioned in that link, Trevor Francis made a memorable continental debut for Nottingham Forest \u2013 scoring the winning goal in the 1979 European Cup final against Malm\u00f6. \u201cChris Baird played 86 minutes in the 2003 FA Cup final for Southampton, on only his second start (and fourth senior appearance) for the club,\u201d notes Ricardio Sentulio. \u201cHis first match was as a substitute in the ominous 6-1 slaughter at the hands of Arsenal. In the rematch at the Millennium Stadium, Southampton narrowly lost 1-0.\u201d But so far, only one full debutant in a Cup final has been unearthed \u2013 and he\u2019s a pretty famous name. \u201cPaul Gascoigne made his debut for Middlesbrough in the 1998 League Cup final \u2013 a dismal no show 2-0 defeat to Chelsea,\u201d writes Garry Brogden. \u201cGazza came on as a sub after replacing Craig Hignett in the squad \u2013 the story is that he gave his runner-up medal to Higgy after the game.\u201d  Any more for any more? Mail us or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU   Centenary titles (redux) Last week, we looked at clubs who won league titles in their centenary year \u2013 but there were a few we missed. \u201cCeltic were Scottish title winners in the 1987-88 season,\u201d wrote Charlotte Larkin and several others. \u201cThey also won the Scottish Cup that season, completing a centenary Double.\u201d Celtic were technically formed in 1887, before playing their first game in 1888 \u2013 but that season was acknowledged by the club as their centenary. Elsewhere, K\u00e1ri Tulinius has an offbeat example: \u201cFC Copenhagen was formed in 1992 by a merger of two clubs, Kj\u00f8benhavns Boldklub (founded in 1876) and Boldklubben 1903. FC Copenhagen went on to win its third league title in 2003, 100 years after Boldklubben were founded.\u201d Finally, Dirk Maas has gone through the history books with a fine-toothed comb to find five more examples:  Al-Tilal (Yemen) founded in 1905, champions in 2005 Al Ahly (Egypt) founded April 1907, champions in 2007 CD Olimpia (Honduras) founded June 1912, champions in 2012 AS Samaritaine (Martinique): founded in 1920, champions in 2020 CS Herediano (Costa Rica): founded June 1921, champions in 2021  Knowledge archive \u201cIn May 1969 my club Grimsby Town had our record low attendance for a home league match of 1,833,\u201d wrote Pete Green in 2011. \u201cIn May 1972 we had 22,489 turn up to see us seal the Fourth Division title, meaning the crowd had grown more than 12 times bigger in three years. Can any other full-time English club claim such a steep surge in support?\u201d Tim Hill got the ball rolling: \u201cWigan Athletic recorded their lowest attendance in the 01-02 season of just 3,535 at home against Cambridge in their 4-1 win on 5 March 2002, yet on 11 February 2006, for their 1-0 loss to Liverpool, they recorded their highest home attendance of the season: 25,023. Not 12 times, just a measly 700% uplift in attendance.\u201d Staying in the northwest, Stig Marstein added that \u201con 8 December 1998, Manchester City played against Mansfield in the Auto Windscreens Trophy in front of 3,007 fans and in March 2004 they played against Manchester United in front of 47,284. So 15 times bigger in a bit more than five years.\u201d But Rob Egan went even better. \u201cMy team, Stevenage, went from 414 fans at home to Wokingham Town in February 1993 to a crowd of 6,489 when they entertained Kidderminster Harriers less than four years later, in January 1997. While this was in non-league times, I calculate the latter crowd to be more than 15 times larger. In fact, in November 1991 they played Leyton Wingate in front of 329 supporters. So in little over five years, the crowd increased by a factor of 19.\u201d  Can you help? \u201cLiverpool played in three finals this year, and didn\u2019t score in any of them. Given that two went to extra time, that\u2019s five-and-a-half hours without a goal. Is this a record? If not, who\u2019s gone scoreless in finals for longer?\u201d asks Derek Robertson.  \u201cWhich British club has the oldest floodlight pylons that are still in use?\u201d asks Gordon Smith.  \u201cThe 2021 FA Cup final was Luke Thomas of Leicester\u2019s 26th professional game but his first in front of a crowd,\u201d notes Simon Tyers. \u201cDid anyone play more games from the start of their career entirely in front of empty stands? Is there someone who made their debut during lockdown and has somehow still never played in front of fans?\u201d  \u201cWednesday\u2019s Copa Libertadores match between Pe\u00f1arol and Colon featured 30 minutes of second-half stoppage time,\u201d writes Dustin Franklin. \u201cSurely this has to be a record for added time?\u201d  \u201cTammy Abraham has won the Champions League, Super Cup and Europa Conference League but has won no top-tier domestic trophies,\u201d notes Rob Lawshaw. \u201cWhich player has the most continental titles without a domestic one?  \u201cMy team, Fenerbah\u00e7e, have been managed by winners of four intercontinental cups \u2013 Carlos Alberto Parreira (Copa Am\u00e9rica, Asian Cup), Holger Osieck (Gold Cup) and Luis Aragon\u00e9s (Euros),\u201d writes \u00d6ndar Susam. \u201cCan any team beat that?\u201d  Mail us your questions or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU.

                    "body": "Manchester City flexed their muscles against West Ham in the first of the FA Cup semi-finals, comfortable 4-1 winners on a cloudless afternoon in east London. They are now on the path to securing their second piece of silverware this season after their Continental Cup triumph against Chelsea in March, who they will face again should the Blues emerge victorious in the second semi-final against Arsenal on Sunday.  West Ham took a leaf from the book of the reigning champions, starting the game with an aggressive high press; clearly, they had learned lessons from the 2-0 defeat suffered at the hands of City in the WSL a fortnight ago. The 3-5-2 formation set up by Olli Harder attempted to put those insights into practice, stifling and snuffing out the City attack, while testing a defence that featured two recent returnees from injury in Alanna Kennedy and Alex Greenwood. For the most part, it worked. Both players were made to feel uncomfortable \u2013 Kennedy appeared in a face mask having broken her nose in a friendly encounter against New Zealand on Tuesday \u2013 by Katerina Svitkov\u00e1, and Greenwood by Lisa Evans. The latter had been nursing a bad knee and it showed when she gave away possession and almost allowed Dagny Brynjarsd\u00f3ttir to open the scoring in the 12th minute. City did not panic and instead waited for West Ham\u2019s collective press to stutter. That is exactly what happened in the 22nd minute after an almighty strike at goal from Keira Walsh that rattled the underside of the crossbar. Before Mackenzie Arnold could figure out where the ball was, Ellen White had acted first to snap up another poacher\u2019s finish. City smelled blood, bypassing the press with ease and forcing their opponents into playing panicked passes \u2013 one of which led to the second goal of the game. This time, it was Gilly Flaherty who found Chloe Kelly with a peach of a ball across the area and the attacker did not fail to convert.  There would be some reprieve for the hosts on the verge of half-time and they snatched back a goal through Evans in the 42nd minute. Proof that though this City team were littered with big names, these were players who had been involved in international football this past week, some for 90 minutes and longer.  Taylor seemed to have that in mind on the other side of half-time when he brought on Hayley Raso for Kelly, livening up the attack in the hopes that West Ham\u2019s continued attempts to adopt and maintain a high press would tire again, and with that would come more goals. The promise was fulfilled in the 66th minute via Lauren Hemp, who scored her 50th club goal, City\u2019s third. Stealing possession from Lucy Parker, the winger weaved her way into the box and then fired a low shot past Arnold into the bottom-rightcorner. The West Ham keeper had faced three shots and had picked the ball out of her net each time. The introduction of Georgia Stanway, who had scored six times and assisted twice in eight appearances against the hosts, must not have been a welcome sight.   Khadija Shaw joined Stanway on the pitch, while West Ham bolstered their defence by bringing on Emma Snerle. It mattered little, as Taylor brought about more changes and his side responded by pushing the opposition defence further and further into their own defensive third until Hemp was able to find a gap and score City\u2019s fourth. Though West Ham had approached the game with the appropriate verve they were out-thought and unable to keep up with White and Kelly as they led their team to a 17th win in 19 games in all competitions.  The focus now turns on Arsenal and Chelsea to see who City will be playing in the final at Wembley on 15 May."

                    "body": "There is a moment in time when this slump for Leeds will come to an end. The only issue for the Rhinos and their next head coach is that moment does not appear to be on the horizon. The Challenge Cup was billed as a respite from their struggles in Super League but by full-time here, this had a worrying similar feel to so much we have seen from one of rugby league\u2019s most famous clubs in 2022.\nAny notion of Leeds setting up a quarter-final tie with Hull KR was all-but out of the question by half-time as the defensive frailties that have haunted the Rhinos this season were brutally exposed.\n\nLeeds were visibly off the pace during a first-half in which they conceded 28 points without reply but the Tigers were at their best in attack.\nTheir five tries were a combination of clinical finishing, such as the offload from Liam Watts that led to Gareth O\u2019Brien\u2019s effort, and a series of harrowing errors in defence from the Rhinos. Time and time again they missed tackles, epitomised by the game\u2019s opener that led to Jake Trueman breaking the deadlock.\n\u201cThe underlying problems, they\u2019re going to take a while to solve,\u201d said Jamie Jones-Buchanan, their interim coach. \u201cSome of the problems are habitual, some are cultural, some players haven\u2019t been put under a blowtorch enough.\u201d\nIt is a damning indictment from one of Leeds\u2019s most revered players, who will almost certainly still be in charge for Friday\u2019s visit of St Helens as the Rhinos scour the world for Richard Agar\u2019s replacement after he departed on Monday.\n\nJake Mamo and O\u2019Brien crossed after Trueman and even at 16-0, the game felt almost beyond the Rhinos despite the game barely being half an hour old.\nThe tie was then put beyond doubt in during a crucial few minutes before half-time. Leeds\u2019s Brad Dwyer was sent to sin-bin and Castleford scored two further tries courtesy of Jordan Turner and George Lawler to make it 28-0.\n\u201cAs far as first halves go, we were outstanding,\u201d the Tigers\u2019 coach, Lee Radford, said. After a difficult start to the season, Castleford\u2019s recent performances have suggested they could improve before Leeds and this afternoon ruthlessly underlined that.\nBack-to-back tries from Rhyse Martin and Liam Sutcliffe after the restart briefly offered Leeds hope, but that was extinguished when Greg Eden intercepted a tame Aidan Sezer pass to put the Tigers back in control.\n\nMartin scored again, but by then it was too late for any late dramatics, particularly given the frailties that visibly hang over Leeds. Fittingly, Castleford rounded off the scoring courtesy of Eden\u2019s second and by then almost all of the Leeds support had headed for home.\nIn Saturday\u2019s other ties, holders St Helens overcame resistance from Championship part-timers Whitehaven to secure a 46-4 victory. The champions had a few uneasy moments in the early stages but their extra fitness and finesse eventually proved too much for the home side as they cruised through with eight different tryscorers.\nCatalans were pushed all the way by a spirited Featherstone in Perpignan and left it late to book their place in the quarter-finals with a hard-fought 27-14 win. Tries in the last 20 minutes from Tyrone May and Tom Davies spared the Dragons\u2019 blushes against a rugged and resilient Rovers.\nHull KR earned their spot in the next round via a tough 24-18 victory over Leigh Centurions. The 2015 Wembley runners-up needed the inspiration of half-back Mikey Lewis to turn the tie in their favour after Leigh dominated the first 20 minutes.\nA Jake Connor masterclass and Connor Wynne\u2019s hat-trick helped Hull FC ease into the last eight for an eighth season in a row following a 58-12 triumph at Championship side Sheffield Eagles."

                    "body": "The UK government\u2019s extensive efforts to facilitate the Saudi Arabian takeover of Newcastle United have been further exposed by documents, released by the Department for International Trade in response to a freedom of information request by openDemocracy. They show that a minister promised the Premier League he would secure a response to a proposed \u201cway forward\u201d from \u201cthe highest levels of the Saudi government\u201d. Lord Gerry Grimstone, then minister for investment, asked the then Premier League chairman, Gary Hoffman, in August 2020 to share the league\u2019s legal advice on \u201ca way forward\u201d for the stalled takeover by the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF), the documents reveal.  Grimstone, a former banker with high-level contacts in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf, who was appointed by Boris Johnson in March 2020 to attract investment to the UK, told Hoffman: \u201cI can then confirm from the highest levels of the Saudi Government whether this is deliverable and we all will then know where this stands.\u201d The documents show Grimstone working hard to try to help secure the takeover, liaising between the Premier League and Saudi government about a potential \u201csolution\u201d. The evidence of Grimstone\u2019s efforts, in internal memos copying in Downing Street officials and the British ambassador in Saudi Arabia, Neil Crompton, further contradicts the UK government\u2019s repeated insistence that it had no involvement in the takeover process. In April 2021, Johnson stated in a parliamentary answer to the Newcastle Central MP, Chi Onwurah: \u201cThe government was not involved at any point in the takeover talks on the sale of Newcastle.\u201d In May this year, in response to the Guardian first revealing Grimstone\u2019s high-level discussions to encourage the deal, a DIT spokesperson downplayed the minister\u2019s involvement, saying he \u201cnever tried to influence Mr Hoffman and the Premier League to approve the Newcastle takeover\u201d. The spokesperson said Grimstone was only fulfilling his role to \u201ckeep abreast of large investments potentially coming into the UK\u201d. The documents released by the DIT consist of four memos Grimstone sent in August 2020 to Crompton and two unnamed officials in Downing Street, informing them of his contact with Hoffman, including WhatsApp messages and three phone calls.  The DIT heavily redacted the memos before releasing them, citing reasons that publishing the details could damage the UK\u2019s international relations or interests, and are commercially sensitive. However, it is clear Grimstone was looking for a way the takeover could be approved by the Premier League and that the stalled process was seen as sensitive and potentially \u201cembarrassing\u201d for relations with Saudi Arabia. In the first memo, sent on 11 August 2020, Grimstone told Crompton he had just had a 45-minute call with Hoffman. \u201cWe established clearly at the beginning of the call that my only role was to facilitate the passing of ideas between the EPL and PIF and that in no way prejudiced the EPL\u2019s complete autonomy in this matter,\u201d Grimstone wrote. Hoffman told the minister that the Premier League\u2019s barrister had advised that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) had the power to control the PIF. That meant the Saudi state itself had to be cleared by the league\u2019s \u201cfit and proper persons\u201d test for owners and directors. The next sections apparently set out Hoffman\u2019s explanation as to why that may have been a problem, but are all redacted.  It is understood the Saudis rejected that legal advice about state control of the PIF and refused to submit to the owners and directors test. It was also believed the Saudi state was likely to fail the test, resulting in the takeover being blocked. That was not because of the state\u2019s notorious human rights abuses or the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which have made the takeover of Newcastle hugely controversial, but because of Saudi state pirating of Qatari-owned sports TV rights. Grimstone wrote in his memo: \u201cWe then discussed possible ways to solve this conundrum.\u201d The solutions, set out in five separate columns, are redacted. The Guardian has previously revealed that Grimstone\u2019s efforts appear to have included trying to broker a solution to the piracy issue. Reporting a subsequent call with Hoffman on 22 August, Grimstone wrote: \u201cGary said the EPL would like to find a solution and he is very sensitive to the wider considerations surrounding all this in respect of relationships with KSA. We agreed that any process should not restart until a clear way through is on the table as any new \u2018failure\u2019 would be highly embarrassing.\u201d  Grimstone wrote that Hoffman was going to contact the Premier League\u2019s barrister \u201cand ask him to advise on is there a way forward [sic] and, if so, what undertakings would KSA have to give. The parties would then have a clear view on how high the hurdle is and whether they are prepared to jump it.\u201d Later the same day Grimstone sent a WhatsApp message to Hoffman: \u201cI think for all our sakes we need to try and bring this matter to a conclusion as quickly as possible. As discussed it would be helpful for you and I to have a view from your QC as to what in his opinion it would take to achieve this. \u201cI can then confirm from the highest levels of the Saudi Government whether this is deliverable and we all will then know where this stands.\u201d Grimstone offered to \u201cjoin in a discussion\u201d with the Premier League\u2019s barrister. The minister\u2019s own assessment of the government\u2019s intention, included at the end of the memo, was: \u201cHopefully, we are helping to inject some clarity into a very muddled situation to allow the parties to bring this to the point of decision.\u201d Despite Grimstone\u2019s efforts, the deal did not go through in 2020, as the legal advice never changed and KSA refused to submit to the owners and directors test. In October 2021, the Premier League announced that a way through to approving the takeover had been found, as the PIF had provided \u201clegally binding assurances that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will not control Newcastle United\u201d. Hoffman told a meeting of the 20 Premier League clubs that the government had put pressure on the league to approve the takeover. Richard Masters, the league\u2019s chief executive, told them it had not, however, and said in a BBC interview: \u201cThere were conversations with government but there was no pressure applied.\u201d A Premier League source indicated Masters maintains this view. Grimstone responded to questions from the Guardian by saying he \u201cstrongly\u201d rejected concluding from the documents that he had been working hard to facilitate the takeover or that Johnson\u2019s statement to parliament was untrue. \u201cPart of my role as investment minister was to keep abreast of large investments potentially coming into the UK,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was particularly important in investments such as Newcastle which were in the public domain and which were attracting a great deal of public interest. \u201cI made it very clear to Mr Hoffman that my only role was to facilitate the passing of ideas between the PIF and EPL and that in no way did I seek to prejudice the EPL\u2019s complete autonomy in this matter. \u201cNaturally, as I would with any high-profile investment coming into the UK, I was concerned that the parties resolved this between themselves courteously and professionally whatever the outcome of their discussions.\u201d Grimstone stepped down as a minister in July after Johnson\u2019s resignation, saying he had brought in \u201cgetting on for \u00a350bn in investment\u201d. That figure included \u00a310bn deals each with sovereign wealth funds of Abu Dhabi and Qatar. Johnson did not respond to questions about his statement to parliament while a DIT spokesperson said the government stood by all its previous statements. Hoffman, who told the clubs he was not influenced by the government pressure, declined to comment."

                    "body": "Having somehow dodged Covid since the pandemic kicked off, the proportion of people who have never seen the red line appear on a rapid test are a steadily shrinking minority. On Thursday, the White House announced that the US president, Joe Biden, had tested positive for Covid, becoming the most high-profile figure yet to join the increasingly exclusive club of people who are only now, in the third year of rife disease, notching up their first infection. Figures from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) are striking on this. About 15% of people in England have never had Covid. But in the current wave, driven by the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants of Omicron, this minority group still accounts for 55% of infections. How can so few be contributing so much? There are, as ever with Covid, multiple forces at work. In a textbook pandemic, the proportion of first-timers who get infected is expected to drop from 100% in the early days to a much smaller number as the bug eventually infiltrates every niche of society. Ultimately, the only people unexposed tend to be babies and young children. Not that we will reach this point soon. Going into the latest Covid wave in England, the UKHSA estimated more than 10 million people had still never been infected. \u201cIt will take a while to get there,\u201d says Bill Hanage, an associate professor of epidemiology at Harvard. The decline in first-timers getting infected may not be a smooth one as the pandemic plays out. People\u2019s behaviour (such as whether they shield or reduce social contacts), their immunity, and new variants all exert an influence on that downward trend. Even though 55% of Covid infections in England are first-timers, this is the lowest it has been since the start of the pandemic, except at the peak of the first Omicron wave, driven by the BA.1 variant in December. Looked at another way, 45% of cases are now reinfections, the highest the figure has ever been, or at least very close to it.  There is good reason for first-time infections to seem even more common than the data suggests. The first encounter with Covid is often the worst, with subsequent infections usually being milder. Across the population, this can skew awareness: many people on their second, third or fourth infection may never even realise they have caught it again. \u201cIf infections after the first are less likely to be symptomatic, or less likely to be seen by the public as \u2018test worthy\u2019, then there will be many people who are being reinfected but not noticing, so that first infections are far more likely to be diagnosed and reported,\u201d says Graham Medley, professor of infectious disease modelling at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Hints as to why slightly more first timers are being infected now than in the first Omicron wave may be found in who got the virus and when. According to UKHSA Covid and flu surveillance data, the first wave of Omicron sent case rates soaring among people in their 20s, 30s and 40s, but far less so in older people. The nation was braced for a \u201ctidal wave\u201d of Omicron, as Boris Johnson called it, and mass testing was still in place, so people were not only wary but well equipped to avoid spreading Covid to older relatives. When the next waves arrived \u2013 fuelled by BA.2 in March and the double act of BA.4 and BA.5 in June \u2013 masses of younger people were well protected by their recent infection on top of vaccination. According to work from Qatar, a recent BA.1 infection is nearly 80% protective against BA.4 or BA.5. In the event, the BA.2 and BA.4/BA.5 waves sent infections sky high in older age groups \u2013 who are more likely to be first-timers \u2013 with case rates highest in the over-60s. Other factors will have played into this: after the first Omicron wave, plan B measures to curb the virus \u2013 such as working from home and compulsory mask-wearing \u2013 were dropped, and the \u201cliving with Covid\u201d plan scrapped most free testing and the requirement to self-isolate. It was easy to think the pandemic was over, even for those who had swerved the virus until then. Another factor at work is that, as older people contract the virus, they spread it to others of a similar age, who like them are more likely to be first-timers. Hanage explains it by proposing two separate outbreaks, one in a busy left-leaning newsroom, the other at a bridge club for the over-70s. In the newsroom, many people have been vaccinated but also recently infected by BA.1 or BA.2, giving them robust \u201chybrid immunity\u201d. If a staffer brings the infection into work, there is only so far it can go.  But it is a different story at the bridge club. There, an infectious player is more likely to spread it to someone who has never been infected before, and whose protection against infection is not that strong. They are then more likely to pass it on to other first-timers. None of this is good news. \u201cIntroductions of BA.5 are more likely to transmit well within these groups that have not previously been infected,\u201d says Hanage. \u201cAnd because of the escalating risks of severe disease in older people \u2013 even those who have been vaccinated \u2013 we can expect the serious consequences of these infections to be more numerous than if they were happening in younger folks who have already been infected.\u201d"

                    "body": "The British Grand Prix at Silverstone has sold out in the shortest time in the race\u2019s history and is now expected to break all previous attendance records. The race organisers cite an unprecedented demand for tickets that reflects a surge in Formula One\u2019s popularity, and not only here. F1 expects all its remaining 20 races this year will also sell out.\nAll 142,000 tickets for British Grand Prix race day on Sunday 3 July have definitely been sold and the organisers feel demand for the Friday and Saturday of the race weekend is such that tickets for those days, too, could also all be taken up.\n\nThis would be the first time in the history of the race, which has been on the F1 calendar every year since 1950, that all three days have sold out and in that case the weekend crowd will surpass the record of 356,000 who attended in 2021.\n\u201cWe have experienced unprecedented demand for tickets for the 2022 Formula One British Grand Prix,\u201d said Stuart Pringle, Silverstone\u2019s managing director. \u201cWe have never reached a position of sellout so early in the year.\n\u201cWe have increased capacity slightly by adding extra grandstand seats and anticipate our race day crowd to reach 142,000 this year. If sales continue at this pace, we expect to be sold out across all three days.\u201d\nSilverstone is not the only circuit enjoying the resurgence of interest. F1 believes that all of the remaining 20 races will be held with capacity crowds, including the races in the Middle East which do not have broad motorsport audiences, Abu Dhabi and Qatar, the latter of which is likely to replace the cancelled Russian GP. \nThe season finale in Abu Dhabi last year attracted 108.7 million TV viewers globally while the sport reported a cumulative audience for 2021 of 1.55 billion, a 4% increase on the 2020 season.\nThe most recent round, held in Melbourne, attracted 420,000 fans, Australia\u2019s highest attendance across a weekend sporting event. The race, which took place at 6am UK time, returned one of the broadcaster Sky\u2019s highest viewing figures. It averaged at 1.01 million, making it the most watched morning F1 race on Sky Sports, an increase of 41% on the Australian GP in 2019 and a higher average than the final round of golf\u2019s Masters garnered that evening.\nF1 recently announced it would be holding a race in Las Vegas next season and is expected to add Kyalami in South Africa to the calendar in the near future. The US will now host three races in 2023 as the sport expands in the marketplace it has long wanted to crack. F1\u2019s chief executive, Stefano Domenicali, has stated that the interest in hosting races was such that the sport could easily hold up to 30 meetings a season, although the calendar is capped at 24.\n\nThe interest is in part because of the success of the Netflix series Drive To Survive. Equally, however, F1 is also reaping the benefit of the concerted effort the F1 owner, Liberty Media, has made to attract a new, younger audience since taking over the sport in 2017. The sport has enjoyed a huge increase in interest in its digital platforms, into which F1 has poured considerable effort and expense to try to reach a younger and wider demographic. Given they were starting almost from scratch, the figures would always be on an upward curve but the scale and speed has been surprising. There has been exponential growth in social media engagement, with numbers making F1 the fastest growing major sport globally. Across its platforms the sport reached 49.1m followers in 2021.\nMotorsportbroadcasting.com reports that F1\u2019s YouTube channel, which shows highlights of races, reflects these efforts and the engagement it is now generating. The site recorded that, five years on from the 2017 Australian GP, for which the highlights had 3.8m views, this year\u2019s race had 7.1m views after one day."

                    "body": "There was once a dream that was Paris. It lasted for just over an hour. At which point, enter the old world \u2013 and enter Karim Benzema, who had the night of his storied footballing life in this Champions League last-16 second leg. Under the lights of the Bernab\u00e9u Paris Saint-Germain produced one of the more extraordinary collapses of elite football\u2019s modern history, a collapse made all the more abject by the divine well of talent in this Paris team, the gerrymandering certainties of Messi-dom, of that divine front three, bought to secure the crown of European club football in this, our year of Qatar 2022. And football can be bought. The glorious history of Real Madrid is testament to that. And yet, somehow, also, it can\u2019t. This was, with all due apologies to the supporters of PSG, in its own twisted way an oddly life-affirming humiliation.  For 61 minutes Madrid had been stretched in every direction, tortured on the left flank by the brilliance of Kylian Mbapp\u00e9. Madrid looked tired. They looked harried and flat. Those white shirts have a vital sense of self: occasionally beaten, but never out-flashed or out-glitzed, remaining always their own cold clean crisp square of light. But this felt like something else, a shifting of the ground beneath those regal feet. At which point something strange happened, one of those rare moments where time and space seem to stretch in weird directions. What does \u00a3350m of attacking talent get you? Not to mention limitless nation-state finances and the greatest club footballer of all time. Brittleness. Operatic collapse. A sense as Madrid pressed hard, of something glossy, callow and frail. Fast forward from 61 to 78 minutes and the birds above the Bernab\u00e9u were already flying backwards through the sky, as Benzema completed a 17-minute hat-trick with the most impudent of touches.  The goal to make it 3-2 on aggregate came straight from kick-off with the scores only just levelled on the night. A single forward pass caused panic in that hilarious, high-kicking farce of a Parisian defence. Benzema nipped in front of his man to nudge the ball into the net with the kind of touch you might reel off in a game of lunchtime corridor football, turning away and bellowing back at the stands with something that felt as much like rage as joy or disbelief. There was time for PSG to lose their cool, for some hacks and kicks and lunges. But they were done by that stage: finished, toasted, flamb\u00e9ed. And if it was unavoidably comical, there was also something grotesque in the spectacle of collapse. For an hour this supernaturally talented team, gassed and juiced and pumped up beyond the limits of their domestic league, had romped around the Bernab\u00e9u like princelings. It was always impossible not to see something of old and new in this match-up, of ambition versus inheritance. And it seemed with 39 minutes gone that this tie was dead, that an unanswerable force was being applied.  Some of the Madrid fans had cheered Mbapp\u00e9 when his name was announced. Yes, we recognise you. This is us. And he was a living nightmare for Real\u2019s left side for long periods. This was pain, suffering, fear, a sense of pre-humiliation every time he went veering on to the ball. How do you mark that which cannot be marked? Mbapp\u00e9 was a ghost. And six minutes before half-time he was out there once again in his own huge lime green space, freed by a single pass from Neymar. The finish was beautiful, a feint followed by a ping hard and low into the corner. This is something to be treasured. Mbapp\u00e9 is 23 now, but also six years into his elite career. The natural speed and balance, the hard-honed super-shredded physique are at their peak. Plus every part of the craft is nailed, matured, fine-tuned, to the extent he can improvise and create, blow bubbles, a footballer reaching out into the far comers of his own supreme talent. It seemed for most of this game that would be the story, a thrilling footballer taking another significant step. Except, it wasn\u2019t. Thank you, Paris. Because, frankly, this was a gift. Who saw it coming? Probably only Benzema, who just kept coming, pressing his shoulder to the wheel and producing two neat finishes to turn the game before that final moment of fantasy.  Benzema has 30 goals in all now this season. He remains such a complete, brilliantly smart forward. But Madrid will surely sign Mbapp\u00e9 in the summer whatever happens from here. They\u2019re a billion dollars in debt. What\u2019s another 150 million? This is the brand, the future earnings, the strange white soul of this club. It was too much for Paris here, who gave us first brilliance, then finally that sense of something fragile; a brittleness that was both painful, and also oddly bracing by the end."

                    "body": "Caoimh\u00edn Kelleher is a John Achterberg project, according to J\u00fcrgen Klopp, in the sense that Liverpool\u2019s goalkeeping coach was convinced the \u201cskinny boy from Ireland standing in this big goal\u201d had first-team potential when others harboured doubts. Another Achterberg project is the goalkeeper mural at Liverpool\u2019s Axa training centre, a work he commissioned from the local artist John Culshaw to commemorate those with a hand in shaping the club\u2019s history \u2013 from Elisha Scott to Tommy Lawrence, Ray Clemence to Bruce Grobbelaar, Jerzy Dudek to Alisson \u2013 and which decorates a wall behind the keepers\u2019 training area. It is an ambition of Kelleher\u2019s to marry the Achterberg projects together. \u201cThere are absolute legends up on that wall so to be up there would be an honour for me,\u201d the 23-year-old says. \u201cIt would be quite cool and special if I was there. It is nice when you go training every day to be having a look at that. It is cool that we have a chance to win a trophy and maybe I can get myself on there as well. It is a good inspiration for us when we are training every day in front of it.\u201d  Kelleher will have his chance to win a trophy and press claims for a place on the mural \u2013 there remains space for an addition or two \u2013 in Sunday\u2019s Carabao Cup final against Chelsea. The Republic of Ireland international will make his eighth appearance of the season, and 17th of his Anfield career, when Liverpool attempt to win their first domestic cup in a decade. The Carabao Cup is Kelleher\u2019s dedicated competition this season and has demonstrated why the young talent has overtaken Adri\u00e1n as Klopp\u2019s second-choice keeper. After two penalty saves in the quarter-final shootout win over Leicester he was unflappable in the semi-final second leg win at Arsenal \u2013 in keeping with a laid-back personality \u2013 but discovered he would be playing at Wembley only when Klopp was asked his intentions at a press conference the following day. \u201cMy idea is to play him,\u201d the Liverpool manager said. \u201cCaoimh\u00edn deserves that. He brought the team there.\u201d Kelleher recalls: \u201cThat was nice to hear. I didn\u2019t know if I would be playing the final, not even when I was playing most of the games. I would never want to take anything for granted. I was obviously very happy. It is an honour to represent Liverpool in a final. I always had belief that I could get up to the first team but this is still a really nice moment for me.\u201d A Liverpool fan from childhood in Cork, Kelleher was a prolific striker for the county and for Ringmahon Rangers until he was 13. Three of his four brothers play hurling (the other, Fiacre, is a defender for Bradford City) but there was no temptation to follow suit. \u201cI tried a bit of GAA but for me it was just football,\u201d Kelleher says. \u201cIt was the only one I was good at.\u201d He switched from Ringmahon\u2019s leading goalscorer to goalkeeper when their regular stopper left.  \u201cObviously it has worked out well,\u201d he says, with considerable understatement. \u201cI did OK in the first game but it was more that I really enjoyed playing in the position. I took a love to it and kicked on. Maybe six to eight months after becoming a goalkeeper clubs would come looking and wanting to take me on trial.\u201d Blackburn, Aston Villa and Manchester United were interested. When Liverpool called, however, there was only one place he was going. \u201cI have had belief in myself since I came over that I can do it but it has taken a lot of hard work and a lot of coaching sessions to bring me on,\u201d Kelleher says. \u201cI have a lot to thank John for in that respect. Ever since I came here he has been brilliant with me. He saw something in me since I came into first-team training and he brought me on in leaps and bounds. I know for sure I would not be here if it was not for him. \u201cI am nowhere near the highest level yet \u2013 I think I have a long way to go if I want to reach that \u2013 but I\u2019ve always had belief in myself that I can play here and obviously playing games for the first team and performing relatively well gives you the extra boost of confidence that you are good enough. Now I need to push on and keep going.\u201d  Kelleher has been to Wembley once, for the Republic of Ireland\u2019s friendly defeat by England in November 2020, and claims he will feel more excitement than nerves in the buildup to a final attended by his family and girlfriend. He prefers to listen to music than re-analyse opposition strikers before kick-off and, though his relaxed character appears well-equipped to handle pressure, Kelleher\u2019s manager has removed it from him anyway. Klopp says: \u201cIf it works out, then it\u2019s all about Caoimh\u00edn. If it doesn\u2019t work out, then it\u2019s all about me. It\u2019s as easy as that, and I take it. It\u2019s just a thing we have to do because of the quality Caoimh\u00edn has. We want to keep him as long as somehow possible knowing that, from our point of view, the best goalkeeper in the world is our No 1. Caoimh\u00edn is an exceptional goalkeeper and we want to keep him here. And for that, he needs games. These games are his competition, and there\u2019s no chance of him not playing.\u201d"

                    "body": "\u201cDifferent league, different league,\u201d Henry de Bromhead said after saddling a 1-2 in the Gold Cup for the second year running here on Friday, and while he was talking about the atmosphere with 70,000 fans back at Cheltenham, it worked just as well for his stable jockey too. Rachael Blackmore was flawless as she delivered A Plus Tard with an irresistible challenge at the final fence before powering up the hill to win by 15 lengths, in the process completing the full set of jumping\u2019s three biggest races, in little more than a year.\nTwelve months ago, Blackmore\u2019s decision to ride A Plus Tard rather than his stable companion, Minella Indo, in the Festival\u2019s showpiece event was the only wrong move she made all week. Minella Indo, the horse that supplied her with the first Grade One win of her career here in 2019, beat off Blackmore\u2019s challenge by just over a length.\n\nShe ended the 2021 Festival, which played out behind closed doors, as the first woman to win the prize for the meeting\u2019s leading rider, but not the first to win its biggest race. Blackmore, though, remained convinced that A Plus Tard was the better prospect for this year, and committed to ride him again several months ago. She backed herself, in other words, and the punters took the hint, supporting A Plus Tard down to 3-1 favourite at the off.\nThe only real moment for Blackmore\u2019s supporters came as Minella Indo moved powerfully down the hill on the final circuit, just as he had 12 months ago. He is the definition of a \u201cspring\u201d horse, who comes alive as the daffodils bloom and reaches his peak at the Festival, so as Robbie Power turned for home with a useful lead and apparently still going well, a repeat win for the defending champion seemed a distinct possibility.\nBlackmore, though, had no time \u2013 or any need \u2013 for doubts. Having settled A Plus Tard in midfield through the first two and a half miles, jumping well and saving ground where she could, she was well within striking distance if A Plus Tard was as good as she believed he was.\nAs Minella Indo rounded the home turn and headed towards the second-last fence, A Plus Tard was briefly behind a wall of four horses, including Al Boum Photo, the Gold Cup winner in 2019 and 2020.\nBlackmore, as ever, refused to panic and a few strides later, her uncanny knack of finding a gap when she needs one had come good once again. A glimmer of daylight appeared between Al Boum Photo and Protektorat, and when Blackmore pointed A Plus Tard towards it, her partner needed no second invitation. A burst of speed carried him to within two lengths of the leader.\nBy the last, A Plus Tard was a split-second in front of Minella Indo and an excellent jump there carried him into an ever-widening lead. It was all over and everyone knew it, and the grandstand seemed to shake amid the bedlam as Blackmore and A Plus Tard galloped up the hill and into the history books.\n\n\u201cI was never worried about A Plus Tard\u2019s stamina and him not staying,\u201d Blackmore said. \u201cI was just conscious not to use up his speed like I did last year. His stamina wasn\u2019t the worry, the ride I was going to give him was the worry.\n\u201cThankfully he was just as good over the last two and picked up incredibly over the last. It is an incredible feeling when you do that over the back of the last at Cheltenham. I was happy if I was going to get beaten for doing something different, as opposed to being in the position I was in last year as that definitely didn\u2019t work. I was taking my luck and we got the split. The wall of horses in front of made sure I didn\u2019t get there too soon.\u201d\n\nBlackmore\u2019s ascent to the top of her profession since her first Grade One win three years ago has been astonishing and exhilarating, and her latest achievement means that she is the only current jockey in the weighing room to have won the Champion Hurdle, Gold Cup and Grand National.\nShe is also the undisputed inheritor of Ruby Walsh\u2019s mantle as the crowd favourite, for all that she lost her status as leading rider at this year\u2019s Festival in the face of two more winners for Paul Townend, Willie Mullins\u2019s stable jockey.\n\n\u201cCheltenham is such a special place, but it is so special because of the atmosphere and the people,\u201d she said. \u201cTo have that roar back, and to get to walk back in when you can\u2019t see space and you can just see bodies is just incredible. It is the closest thing to feeling like a rock star you will ever feel without being able to sing.\u201d\nBlackmore is also the first rider since Tony McCoy in 1997 to win the Champion Hurdle and Gold Cup at the same meeting.\n\u201cI\u2019m delighted for her,\u201d De Bromhead, who trained both horses, said. \u201cShe\u2019s just a savage rider and we\u2019re so lucky to have her. I said to her to do whatever she wanted, and she started banging on about what she was going to do as we were about to leg her up. I just said: \u2018You\u2019re the boss.\u2019\u201d"

                    "body": "It was such a big occasion for the Richmond Union Bowling Club, members in their late 60s had come out of retirement. Some clubs recruit star players from overseas to succeed. Richmond \u2013 the tiny, unpretentious bowls club that inspired the movie Crackerjack \u2013 never has. Instead, its players are made up of rough diamonds and bar stragglers, brought together by acceptance and fun. If they were to win, it would be the first time in the club\u2019s 153 year history to have qualified for the Victorian Bowls Premier League, and the second time in two years to have been promoted. It had been the equivalent of leap-frogging from country footy to the AFL, seeing a trickled return of star players from the old days eager for a share in the glory. So, when the last bowl to determine promotion to the Premier League ricocheted off the green on Sunday afternoon, sailing Richmond to a 79-73 \u201cfairytale\u201d win, commentators expected its members to flood onto the pitch. Instead, the reception at Dandenong Bowling Club was strangely mute \u2013 saved for a few back taps and the shaking of hands. Richmond was too moved by the moment to celebrate. They were crying in the stands. \u2018It\u2019s a safe space\u2019 It took four decades and a bowls club for Tony \u201cRicky\u201d Baker to find his place in the world. Until his late 30s, Baker toured regional Victorian bowls clubs, battling with his identity as a queer man in rural communities. When he eventually arrived in Melbourne, the first thing he did was seek out a local club. As fate had it, Baker found the Richmond Union Bowling Club, an easily missed spot tucked on a side street between a town hall and a swimming pool. \u201cAs soon as I walked in here, I felt like I was back in the regions where everyone\u2019s looking out for each other,\u201d he says. \u201cBut here, for the first time, I had the opportunity to be myself with my sexuality. As soon as I walked in, I was encouraged to be who I want to be, be who I am.\u201d  Richmond Union is the only bowling club in Australia to have its own annual Pride Cup, to take place this year on 15 May. The third-oldest club in Australia (or fourth, depending on who you ask), the site has withstood fires, development and gentrification for 153 years. Baker says the members make the club \u2013 \u201calways have\u201d. Nowadays, it has 20 gay members, \u201ca few fence-sitters\u201d and its own pride uniform: a rainbow kit splashed with Richmond\u2019s iconic tiger. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find community in this new age, it\u2019s rare,\u201d Baker says. \u201cBut it\u2019s a safe space here, even if you\u2019re not a bowler. It\u2019s somewhere you can come in and get support. Day two I got here I was already nicknamed Ricky. \u201cAnd as soon as you\u2019re comfortable in all aspects of your life \u2026 if your head\u2019s in the right place, if you\u2019re happy, you enjoy it more, and you bowl better.\u201d \u2018You accept everyone for who they are\u2019 David \u201cBestie\u201d Best established the first Pride Cup in lawn bowls history in 2018. \u201cI wanted the LGBTI community to have some fun and let their hair down. So the first year we had eight teams, and the second year we had 16,\u201d he says. \u201cIt started at 10 and finished at five, it was brilliant. And as soon as the bar\u2019s open, it always kicks on.\u201d   Best says Richmond Union has always been different, for some reason or another. Even these days, they\u2019ll still play clubs that are \u201cvery anti-female, anti-gay\u201d. \u201cGay people might bowl in certain clubs but they won\u2019t be relaxed because it\u2019s not safe, they\u2019re not recognised. Here, you still get people you don\u2019t like and might have to bowl with them for 14 weeks, but you accept everyone for who they are,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve been here six years and this is my home. I live in Coburg, but this is my home.\u201d Out by the green, Noelene \u201cBash\u201d Gerty surveys the bowlers from the sidelines with a can of coke and a cigarette. She says her \u201cbig hands, big feet and small body\u201d make her a natural at the sport.  But it\u2019s been a fight since she rolled into the club three decades ago. Back then, women were still in their own division until a landmark court case in 2001. \u201cWe had to go to court to get to play on Saturday,\u201d she says. \u201cWomen started here in the 1930s but they weren\u2019t allowed in the club, they had their own clubhouse. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until the 70s or later they were allowed in, to do the afternoon teas. The men would send the women letters saying \u2018we\u2019ll need 10 women to do the catering\u2019 for their opening days.\u201d When Gerty started in 1990, she says, the club had missed \u201cthe whole sex revolution in the 60s and 70s\u201d. \u201cThey still had ridiculous things about uniform, so your dress had to be a certain length, which was really dumb,\u201d she says. \u201cInstead of saying just below your knee, they had 15 inches from the ground, and a little measuring stick. A girl I knew was told her dress was too short so she just took it off and said you go fix it, and kept playing in her petticoat.\u201d  Still, some clubs offer women reduced subscription fees, giving them no real rights and the expectation that they do the catering. Others remain segregated, with women unable to bowl at weekends. The current Richmond Union president, Bob Hutton, says the club has no all-male league \u2013 it\u2019s either mixed, or women\u2019s only. \u201cRichmond is one of the most diverse suburbs in Melbourne, and we want to be inclusive,\u201d he says. \u201cBowls is the only sport that\u2019s not discriminatory. It doesn\u2019t matter your gender, your body type. We just want somewhere people feel safe. Nothing more complicated than that.\u201d A reverence for the greats If you cross the green to the back of the club, a marble statue of legendary bowler Walter Nation stands at the original level of the pitch, first laid down in 1868. Before his death by drowning at 41, Nation won the 1888 UBG Single Handed Bowls Championship while he was club secretary. Hutton says his ashes are scattered among the chips in the club\u2019s garden. Times have changed since Nation\u2019s day, but a reverence for the greats and respect for the game still reverberates, on and off the green. Over lockdown, bowler Michael \u201cStats\u201d Quayle spent 500 hours making trading cards of Richmond players dating back to 1905, and has printed thousands of them to be sold over the bar.   It\u2019s the first time ever, as far as Quayle can tell, that anyone has made a full deck of trading cards for a bowls club. Nation features in the deck, of course. \u201cI\u2019ve googled it, found some cards of Australian players but nothing\u2019s been done like this,\u201d Quayle says. \u201cPretty much 95% of the club are in it, there\u2019s three or four who just didn\u2019t understand what it was, it\u2019s not compulsory but when I started it I wanted 150, and I\u2019ve got 153.\u201d The idea had been brewing quietly for years, but when Quayle got an iPad for his 50th birthday in March, he took it as a sign. \u201cI thought, \u2018I can do this now\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cOn that day I went \u2018I\u2019m going to do this\u2019, even made a speech on my birthday saying \u2018I decided I\u2019m going to do this thing\u2019.\u201d Quayle says his \u201cobsessive\u201d personality helped him, but liaising with more than 100 bowls players over lockdown was hard. \u201cI just thought it would be cool to have my own trading card. Then I did a few of us, thought \u2026 \u2018I\u2019ll have to do these guys as well\u2019, then just went \u2018ah \u2026 all right, everybody\u2019s in\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of people are really old and don\u2019t have internet, so I had forms floating around the club and got people phoning.  Local students \u2018put us to shame\u2019 Money is always pretty tight, but the club somehow survives. A few years ago, it was under threat of development,but a hard fight earned it a 99-year tenure on the site. \u201cThey were going to take us over and put us on the roof,\u201d Hutton says. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be a pub with a bowling green, we want to be a club.\u201d  When Richmond high school opened next door in 2018, club member John \u201cJingles\u201d Inglese saw it as an opportunity. He reached out to the school and quickly got a year seven and eight program up and running, which has now become an integral part of the club\u2019s recruitment strategy. Three students now bowl with the club permanently. Best says the young blood \u201cputs us to shame\u201d. Year 10 student Taj Alcott has played with the club for two years since graduating from the program. \u201cIt\u2019s supportive here, everyone treats me like I\u2019m one of them,\u201d he says. \u201cI come down here twice a week and everyone knows my name, it\u2019s nice.\u201d  Teacher Jess Hayes says bowls has been a revelation for kids \u201cyou can\u2019t get off the sideline for a game of basketball\u201d, and children from disadvantaged backgrounds. \u201cWe\u2019ve had kids coming from low socioeconomic backgrounds because it\u2019s free, there\u2019s no cost to their families,\u201d she says. \u2018This is gold to us\u2019 As the afternoon drifts into the early evening, beer glasses are refilled, music starts to play. The bowlers drift from the green to the sidelines, reminiscing about past tournaments, jeering one another. Every so often someone will land a ripper shot and a small murmur will pass through the group. At the club\u2019s bar, in prime position by the loo, a framed poster signed by Mick Molloy reads: \u201cThis is where it all began\u201d. The story goes that Molloy and his mates learned to bowl at the Richmond Union, where they would drink beers and discuss what would one day become the cult film Crackerjack.  You can picture the scene down to the jesting barman, Walter Nation\u2019s portrait looming over them, stragglers rolling in off the green. A few beers in, Ricky Baker is getting reflective. He looks out to the same green, 153 years of history in it. It\u2019s not just a green, of course. It never was. \u201cThis is gold,\u201d he says, light sinking over the high rises. \u201cThis is gold to us.\u201d"

                    "body": "Thomas Tuchel said he was impressed by his Chelsea players\u2019 discipline and focus as, refusing to be distracted by the club\u2019s impending sale, they swept Middlesbrough aside to reach the semi-finals of the FA Cup.  \u201cMy players have not surprised me but they have impressed me,\u201d said Tuchel following the 2-0 win which came 24 hours after the deadline passed for prospective buyers to submit bids to replace the sanctioned Roman Abramovich. \u201cThe trust and team spirit was impressive. That is the culture at our club. \u201cNo matter what we do and how much we worry we cannot change the situation so we have to find a certain way of accepting the situation and accepting what we can influence.\u201d The German seemed more concerned about the more junior employees at Stamford Bridge than himself and his squad. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely OK,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel very privileged, but there are 700 or 800 people working at Chelsea and they are very worried about their position so it is my responsibility to show the right spirit and positivity in a situation we did not cause and cannot change. The players have huge talent but with it comes huge responsibility and they are doing it for the people at Chelsea.\u201d Tuchel professed to lack inside knowledge on the progress of the sale. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about the offers,\u201d he said. \u201cHow many serious offers there are or who they are from.\u201d  The Chelsea Supporters\u2019 Trust earlier confirmed discussions had been held with prospective new owners as it continues to push for greater fan involvement in Chelsea\u2019s future. The trust has set out a number of expectations of any new owner, including a \u201cgolden share\u201d, which would essentially give supporters the right to exercise a veto over certain important decisions. In a statement it said: \u201cThe CST has played an important role over these difficult weeks. We have held positive discussions with a number of prospective bidders.\u201d The British property investor Nick Candy, leading a \u00a32bn bid alongside the South Korean companies Hana Financial Group and C&amp;P Sports Limited, has pledged to advocate for a golden share if his offer is successful, while the former British Airways chairman Sir Martin Broughton \u2013 leading a rival bid with Sebastian Coe \u2013 has also promised to increase the involvement of fans. Broughton told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today: \u201c[Fans] can come and get all the benefits of ownership and veto rights for free, and we\u2019re open to discounts and investments. We\u2019d be interested [in selling shares at a discount] if that\u2019s what the fans want.\u201d  Besides the bids led by Candy and Broughton, other offers are understood to have been made by the financial firm Aethel Partners, by the Ricketts family \u2013 owners of the US baseball team the Chicago Cubs \u2013 and by the Swiss billionaire Hansj\u00f6rg Wyss, who has linked up with the LA Dodgers co-owner Todd Boehly, the British businessman Jonathan Goldstein and the Conservative peer Daniel Finkelstein.  The bidders now face a wait to learn if their bids will be progressed. Chelsea and Raine Group, the US bank handling the sale process, are expected to make a shortlist before naming a preferred bid, which will then require government approval. That process will involve proving the source of funds and where the sale proceeds go.  The Turkish businessman Muhsin Bayrak, meanwhile, who had expressed interest, said that his company had not filed a bid to Raine owing to a misunderstanding with his lawyers over the auction procedure. \u201cI am very upset,\u201d he told Reuters."

                    "body": "Magnus Carlsen\u2019s shock withdrawal from the $350,000 Sinquefield Cup in St Louis following his third-round defeat to the newcomer Hans Niemann has triggered a variety of \u201ccheating\u201d claims. It is potentially the most serious such case for international chess since the 2005 Toiletgate world championship match, when Veselin Topalov accused Vlad Kramnik of analysing games in the lavatory. Carlsen\u2019s loss to Niemann, 19, was his first for several years with White to a much lower rated opponent, and it was the first withdrawal of the Norwegian\u2019s entire career. His only explanation was a cryptic video clip of the football manager Jos\u00e9 Morinho saying \u201cIf I speak I am in big trouble,\u201d during a press conference about referees.  This was widely interpreted as raising suspicions of cheating. Security was stepped up, the round-four broadcast was delayed by 15 minutes, and Niemann was thoroughly frisked before the start of his game, but nothing was found. The leading chess streamer, GM Hikaru Nakamura, weighed in with the revelation that, many years earlier, Niemann had been temporarily banned by Chess.com for computer use in an online tournament. Carlsen\u2019s opening 1 d4 Nf6 2 c4 e6 3 Nc3 Bb4 4 g3, had been prepared by Niemann in detail. The Californian teenager, who does not have a coach but whose rating has jumped 250 points in three years, had already beaten the world champion a month earlier in an online tournament in Miami, when he made headlines for a one-sentence victory interview where he said: \u201c Chess speaks for itself,\u201d before walking off. For a while at St Louis, he became an outcast. Then a reaction set in. The position out of the opening was almost level, a minimal 0.3 plus for Black, but the world champion seemed to try too hard, with sub-optimal choices at moves 22, 40 and 42. Niemann also made inaccuracies, so the game lacked the tell-tale signs of computer aid. Support for the teenager came from Jacob Aagaard, the Danish-Scottish grandmaster who was British champion in 2007 and is a popular author. France\u2019s Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, who is competing at St Louis, said: \u201cThe scandal has become a witch hunt.\u201d Then Niemann spoke in his own defence, in his post-game fifth-round interview following his draw with Leinier Dom\u00ednguez in which his opponent let him off the hook in a lost position. iIn half an hour of fast talking (a transcript of the salient points is available on chess24) he dealt with the issues against him and issued a defiant message: \u201cI\u2019m not going to let Chess.com, I\u2019m not going to let Magnus Carlsen, I\u2019m not going to let Hikaru Nakamura, the three arguably biggest entities in chess, simply slander my reputation because the question is \u2013 why are they going to remove me from Chess.com right after I beat Magnus?\u201d  He has been banned from the largest chess site and uninvited from the Chess.com Global Championship, a $1m event with online qualifiers and an eight-player final in Toronto. Following this interview, the huge volume of online comments which had been around 90% against him have changed to around 60-40 in his favour, There are growing calls now for Carlsen to issue a fuller statement. It would appear that the central issue is whether Carlsen believes his pre-game analysis of his intended surprise 1 d4 Nf6 2 c4 e6 3 Nc3 Bb4 4 g3 was leaked, either by a mole within his camp or by a computer hack. An alternative explanation of the \u201cleak\u201d could be quite innocent. The relevant pawn structure, with plausible transpositions into Carlsen v Niemann, had already occurred in a previous well-known Carlsen game against England\u2019s Michael Adams in 2006. Niemann said he asked himself what ideas Carlsen might produce to divert him from his planned Catalan with \u2026 Bb4+ and decided to check 5 Nc3, a rare transposition to the Nimzo-Indian. There was also Niemann\u2019s own very recent game against Le Quang Liem at Miami, where 5 g3 (instead of 5 e3 d5 as played) d5 6 a3 could easily transpose into Carlsen v Niemann. Carlsen had begun well in St Louis, defeating his 2021 title challenger, Ian Nepomniachtchi, in the first round by means of a trademark Carlsen grind from an apparently level opening, and taking his score against his rival to six points from their last seven meetings.  The third round on Sunday changed everything and it is easy to understand why the world champion was so upset. Carlsen\u2019s tournament score will be cancelled, but his games will be rated and the defeat by Niemann will cost him seven rating points, a large setback in the context of trying to get from 2865 to 2900. His dream of a record rating has just become more distant. Meanwhile Niemann is the lone outsider, the new kid on the block challenging the big battalions. Older US chess fans, who have longed since the 1970s for a second coming of Bobby Fischer, will empathise with him. Then, the establishment was Mikhail Botvinnik, Tigran Petrosian and the Soviet chess empire. Now it is Carlsen, Nakamura, and Chess.com. Of course the comparison easily breaks down. At 19, Fischer had just won the 1962 Stockholm interzonal and was favourite for the Candidates. Niemann at 19, despite his meteoric rise, has only just broken 2700 and is still down at world No 40. Hans has the Fischer glare and the ambition to be No 1, but his mystique rests basically on a single game against the world champion. 3832: 1 Kg3! Bc3 2 Bg6+ Kg5 3 h4+! gxh3 ep 4 f4 mate. Other replies cost Black at least his bishop."

                    "body": "There is nowhere to hide for full-backs in modern rugby union. If they cannot soar like single-minded salmon to claim a high ball under intense pressure they will not last long and their team will win nothing. Which makes it all the more remarkable that the best No 15 currently playing in the UK and Ireland initially struggled to make his school \u201cC\u201d team and is among the less conspicuous members of Leinster\u2019s star-studded squad. On paper Hugo Keenan will have his work cut out this weekend compared with his Leicester counterpart Freddie Steward, the 6ft 5in skyscraper swiftly establishing himself as one of the world game\u2019s safest pair of aerial hands. Which will suit the 25-year-old Dubliner just fine. To underestimate Keenan, as plenty of opponents are finding, is an increasingly big mistake.  Because it is not just a case of how high full-backs can jump or how tall they are. What matters even more is the consistent ability to be in the right place at the right time and to defuse potential danger with minimal fuss. Keenan, some four inches shorter than Steward, is a prime example of someone whose error rate is so low he often goes largely unnoticed. A classic late developer who did not make the first team at Blackrock College until his final year, Keenan is not the boastful type himself but he is fast becoming one of the first names on the teamsheet for both his province and country. While the Tigers can be relied upon to kick high and often towards the Leinster back three in their Champions Cup quarter-final at Welford Road on Saturday they will not find the aerial contest an easy win. For a start Keenan has already been given a taste of what to expect during Ireland\u2019s 32-15 win over a 14-man England at Twickenham in the Six Nations. \u201cMarcus Smith was trying to play a pressure game, similar to what Leicester will probably bring this weekend. They like to put pressure on teams and George Ford will kick a lot.\u201d  He also points out that Leinster can put judicious boot to ball themselves. \u201cYou have to be realistic about your odds of winning the ball against the likes of Freddie Steward when there is a contestable kick. But if it\u2019s a good kick and a good chase I know myself how hard it is to take any ball if it is on the money and there is good pressure. We won\u2019t shy away from it but we\u2019ll also try and vary it as well.\u201d Keenan\u2019s personal high ball heroes were Rob Kearney and Leigh Halfpenny but he has already seen enough of the 21-year-old Steward to be genuinely impressed. \u201cHe\u2019s probably the best in the world at the moment in that area. He\u2019s obviously got the 6ft 5in frame but he\u2019s dynamic as well \u2026 always jumping up through the ball and really attacking it. He\u2019s brave as well, so it\u2019s a good combination. He\u2019s one of Leicester\u2019s key players and his chemistry and connection with George Ford is one of the reasons why they\u2019re going so well. I\u2019m looking forward to the challenge.\u201d  One slight handicap could be Leicester\u2019s battle-hardened edge from their recent Premiership exertions while Leinster\u2019s main men sat out their side\u2019s recent visit to South Africa and will have scant time to adjust to a potentially raucous east Midlands atmosphere. Keenan, though, believes Leinster are braced for whatever is coming and will be fiercely motivated by past knockout disappointments against Saracens and La Rochelle. \u201cWith the squad we have, looking back on the last year and the year before we were hugely disappointed not to go on and win it. All the focus is on this year. If not now, when? \u201cWe always say that European club rugby, especially in the knockout stages, is the highest intensity and physicality you\u2019re going to play. It\u2019s those sort of tests that really do match an international. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to bring our best performance because, ultimately, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to be needed to win over there. Nothing but the best.\u201d"

                    "body": "  10.16pm    Jacob Steinberg has kindly filed a very prompt match report, which means I can get away in good time for Question Time. Thanks for your company and emails; goodnight!      10.03pm    Post-match reaction Willian   It\u2019s a special night for us. I think we deserved the win. Chelsea are in a difficult situation but they have a really good team. It was a special night for me as well to play against them. [On his non-celebration] I have a big respect for the fans and the club, but now I play for Fulham and I have to do my best.   Tim Ream  The last couple of games we\u2019ve had to show a bit more fight, a bit more grit. When we can show that side of our game and still play well with the ball, it bodes well for what we\u2019re doing.[On Mitrovic\u2019s absence] We\u2019re not a one-trick pony, we have guys in the team who can put the ball away. We\u2019re not looking at the table, but we find ourselves in a very good position.       9.57pm   Full time: Fulham 2-1 Chelsea  Fulham move above Liverpool and into sixth place after a famous win over Chelsea. They even did it without Aleksandar Mitrovic, whose replacement Carlos Vinicius capped a fine performance with the winning goal. Chelsea were better than in recent weeks, with Joao Felix pretty impressive \u2013 until he was given a straight red card early in the second half for a dangerous tackle on Kenny Tete. Chelsea have now lost seven of their last ten games in all competitions, and five of the last nine in the league. All the headlines will be about Chelsea, Graham Potter and Joao Felix, but this is also about Fulham. In their last two Premier League seasons they managed 28 and 26 points; this year they have 31 after 18 games. And now they have won four top-flight games in a row for the first time in almost 60 years.  Updated at 10.04pm GMT    9.54pm    90+5 min Kepa springs from his line to beat Cairney to James\u2019 low cross.     9.54pm    90+5 min Cucurella miscontrols the ball for a Fulham throw-in, prompting the lustiest of cheers around Craven Cottage.     9.53pm    90+3 min: Double substitution Dan James and Nathaniel Chalobah, brother of Trevoh, replace Carlos Vinicius and Andreas Pereira, who were both terrific and combined for what should be the winning goal.     9.52pm    90+2 min: Good save by Leno! Koulibaly drills a pass over the top for Havertz, who hits a good shot on the run from the edge of the area. Not for the first time tonight, Leno gets down smartly to save.     9.49pm    90+1 min Six minutes of added time.     9.49pm    90 min Another wicked cross from Pereira is well cleared by Koulibaly (I think), stretching towards his own goal.     9.49pm    89 min Fulham have beaten Chelsea only once since 1979, and that was a deadish rubber in March 2006 when Chelsea were cruising to another title.      9.47pm    88 min Cucurella\u2019s cross is headed behind by Adarabioyo. Ziyech\u2019s corner comes to nothing.     9.45pm    85 min Cucurella\u2019s cross is poked just wide on the stretch by Azpilicueta, though the flag was up against Havertz earlier in the move. He tried an overhead kick and made the slightest contact before the ball landed at Azpilicueta\u2019s right foot.     9.44pm    84 min Adarabioyo has been booked for something or other.     9.42pm    83 min: Fulham substitution Manor Solomon replaces Willian, who had a good game against his old club and scored the opening goal.     9.42pm    83 min Cucurella has a shot blocked by Tete, then Vinicius draws a foul from Koulibaly with some good hold-up play. He\u2019s had such a good game.     9.41pm    82 min \u201cI take it Fulham will be subject to an FA charge for their players surrounding the ref after Felix\u2019s tackle?\u201d says Tom Atkins. \u201cOr does this only apply if it happens on free-to-air telly?\u201d For a fanbase who should be having the time of their post-2004 life, many Arsenal fans are remarkably angry right now.      9.40pm    81 min No that\u2019s not right, it\u2019s a 3-5-1 with Ziyech and Cucurella at wing-back. Azpilicueta has moved into te back three.     9.39pm    80 min: Quadruple substitution for Chelsea Marc Cucurella, Hakim Ziyech, Carney Chukwuemeka and Conor Gallagher replace Lewis Hall, Trevoh Chalobah, Mateo Kovacic and Mason Mount. Don\u2019t ask me what that means tactically; please don\u2019t do that to me. (An unbalanced 4-3-1-1, with no left-winger, I think.)     9.38pm    78 min Chelsea were playing well at 1-1 but there\u2019s an air of fatalism now. Graham Potter is about to make a quadruple substitution.     9.36pm    77 min \u201cThe most bizarre thing about the Joao Felix red card,\u201d says Admir Pajic, \u201cis that he will miss games against Crystal Palace, Liverpool and...Fulham. I can\u2019t recall if that has ever happened before.\u201d That\u2019s a tremendous question, and one I\u2019ll include in next week\u2019s Knowledge if you don\u2019t mind.  Updated at 9.37pm GMT    9.35pm    76 min Mount, who has been in a foul mood lately, takes his out his frustration on Cairney and is booked.     9.34pm    75 min \u201cRe your comment on 47 minutes about saving managers. Roy Hodgson at Liverpool,\u201d says Espen Bommen. \u201cSpectacularly out of his depth, spectacularly out of touch without reality. The performance against Everton was not the greatest you\u2019ve ever seen and Northampton aren\u2019t a great team. Mighty I think was the word he used. And nothing but contempt for Liverpool fans, especially the ones trying to save the club from financial disaster. I don\u2019t necessarily think Potter shouldn\u2019t be given time but I don\u2019t agree that you shouldn\u2019t fire a manager in his first season. Sometimes you just know things aren\u2019t working.\u201d From what I\u2019ve read, and from talking to mates who are Liverpool fans, I agree that that was one of the rare examples where sacking a manager early on is almost essential. Those were exceptional circumstances. Frank de Boer is probably another example, though I don\u2019t enough to say that with certainty. I just don\u2019t think Potter\u2019s situation is comparable. That said, I was once such an entitled moron that I thought Sir Alex Ferguson should go, so I\u2019m not really one to talk.     9.33pm    Vinicius has had a really good game, and now he has scored a Mitrovician goal. Pereira, on the right, rolled his studs over the ball and curled a beautiful ball towards the far post. Kepa came and got nowhere near it, and Vinicius pulled away from Chalobah to head into the empty net.   Updated at 9.40pm GMT    9.32pm   GOAL! Fulham 2-1 Chelsea (Vinicius 73)  Carlos Vinicius heads Fulham in front!   Updated at 9.45pm GMT    9.29pm    70 min \u201cSlightly unfortunate moment in the TalkSport commentary when discussing Zakaria\u2019s injury and not appreciating the occasional value of a pause between sentences,\u201d says Tom Stratfod. \u201c\u2018Always unfortunate to see, Jorginho about to come on.\u2019 I\u2019m clearly easily amused\u2026\u201d      9.27pm    68 min: Double substitution for Fulham The red card hasn\u2019t changed the game at all, so it\u2019s time for Marco Silva to bring on a couple of new players. Harry Wilson and Tom Cairney replace Harrison Reed and Bobby Decordova-Reid.     9.26pm    67 min \u201cI distinctly remember putting in a request for a non-stimulating match!\u201d writes Richard Hirst from his hospital bed.     9.25pm    66 min Chalobah commits a needless foul on Willian on the left. He hasn\u2019t had a good game at all.     9.24pm    64 min: Good save by Leno! Chelsea have reacted superbly to going a man down. Mount, on the left, finds Havertz, who slows down on the edge of the area and then accelerates thrillingly between Adarabioyo and Ream. Leno comes out, Havertz tries to chip him, and the ball hits Leno in the face before deflecting behind for a corner.     9.23pm    64 min Here\u2019s the tackle form Joao Felix that led to a straight red card.      9.22pm    63 min \u201cOne sign of how well coached Fulham are is that the players rarely seem to be any doubt what to do,\u201d says K\u00e1ri Tulinius. \u201cThey may not be as individually skilled as their Chelsea counterparts, but they know where to expect their teammates to be, and the extra speed of interplay that allows makes a huge difference.\u201d Given the quality of coachingthese days, imagine how mindblowing it would be to spend a week watching someone like Marco Silva at work, never mind Pep Guardiola on Jurgen Klopp.     9.21pm    62 min A-hem: Hall is booked for a late tackle on Decordova-Reid.     9.21pm    61 min Hall\u2019s dangerous cross is put behind for a corner by Adarabioyo. Amid the ruins, I really think Chelsea have found a player.     9.18pm    58 min Replays confirm it was a wretched challenge, with Joao Felix\u2019s studs going into Tete\u2019s shin, and he can have no complains. It wasn\u2019t that forceful, so I\u2019m slightly reluctant to call it a leg-breaker*, and I suspect it was overzealous rather than malicious*, but it was still a very dangerous tackle. * although I\u2019d like to see it again to be sure   Updated at 9.24pm GMT    9.17pm   JOAO FELIX IS SENT OFF!  57 min Oh my days. Felix goes in late and high on Tete, and after much consideration \u2013 and encouragement from the Fulham players \u2013 David Coote shows a straight red!   Updated at 9.22pm GMT    9.16pm    56 min: Chelsea substitution Jorginho replaces Zakaria, and Chelsea are once again a centre-back short of a full XI of injured senior players. Mendy; James, Fofana, Injured Centre-Back, Chilwell; Loftus-Cheek, Kante, Zakaia; Sterling, Broja, Pulisic.     9.15pm    55 min It\u2019s a problem with his left leg, his knee I think, which he seemed to jar while kicking the ball away. He has his shirt over his face, and Jorginho is getting very detailed tactical instructions from Graham Potter.  Updated at 9.16pm GMT    9.14pm    55 min Zakaria is down and in a fair bit of pain. The physios are signalling that he needs to come off.     9.13pm    52 min: Chance for Pereira Robinson belts the ball down the left wing to find Pereira, who runs off Chalobah and shoots wide of the near post from a tight angle. It must have taken a deflection because Fulham have a corner.     9.10pm    50 min Mount and Havertz combine to find Joao Felix, who whistles a first-time shot from about 25 yards. It\u2019s straight at Leno, who pats it down and grabs the ball at the second attempt. It hasn\u2019t always worked, but at times the front three of Joao Felix, Havertz and Mount have linked up really nicely.      9.08pm    49 min I hadn\u2019t realised that Hall was partially at fault for Fulham\u2019s goal \u2013 he tried to run the ball to safety and lost it to Decordova-Reid, whose cross eventually fell to Willian \u2013 but he made up for it with the run that led to Mount\u2019s free-kick. He\u2019ll make mistakes, like all young players, but to my untrained eye he looks a serious prospect.     9.07pm    Mount surprised everyone, not least Leno, by whipping the free-kick towards goal from a very tight angle. It hit the post and rebounded to Koulibaly, who forced it over the line from close range. Leno did save it but he was well behind the line. That was a brilliant free-kick from Mount, and we shouldn\u2019t forget Hall\u2019s point in the goal either.   Updated at 9.12pm GMT    9.06pm   GOAL! Fulham 1-1 Chelsea (Koulibaly 47)  Chelsea are level!   Updated at 9.11pm GMT    9.06pm    47 min Hall zig-zags superbly between Decordova-Reid and Tete before being brought down just outside the area on the left.     9.05pm    47 min \u201cWell\u2026 the sad thing is that it\u2019s been better than recent efforts from Chelsea but WAY below what we\u2019d expect,\u201d says Lee Madden. \u201cI really want to give Potter time but at what point do we say that he\u2019s out of his depth? Am I being too harsh? I\u2019ve seen many different versions of Chelsea over the years but Potter\u2019s Chelsea lack leadership, authority, attacking inventiveness and solidity. I\u2019m beginning to wonder if, actually, he just can\u2019t cut it at this level, which is crazy given how short a time he\u2019s been in charge.\u201d That may well be the case, but I just think it\u2019s way too early to draw such conclusions, especially as it\u2019s not his team and half his best players are injured. Barring truly exceptional circumstances, and I don\u2019t think these qualify at all, I can\u2019t really get my head round a manager being sacked inside a year, never mind six months.  Updated at 9.09pm GMT    9.04pm    46 min Peep peep! Chelsea begin the second half.     8.52pm    Half-time reading Nowt to do with tonight\u2019s game, but this is really good.   Updated at 8.54pm GMT    8.52pm    \u201cThe arrival of Newcastle into the \u2018top tier\u2019, along with Tottenham seeming a more permanent member and Arsenal jumping back into the title race, feels like a tipping point where the big spending squads (outside of City) can\u2019t count on the Champions League any more,\u201d says Zach Neeley. \u201cI wonder if only half of Newcastle/Tottenham/Arsenal/Chelsea/Liverpool/Manchester United making the CL each year will lead to a freakout with even faster firings or even bigger spending, or if those teams can be happy enough to make it about half the time and get enough money just to be in the Premier League along with being funded by money-no-object operations.\u201d That\u2019s a very good point, and it\u2019ll be interesting to see how it pans out, at least until the 2027-28 season, when Uefa award the Premier League 12 places in the new, improved, 975 -game Champions League.     8.48pm   Half time: Fulham 1-0 Chelsea  It is happening. Again. Chelsea started brightly, the new signing Joao Felix in particular, but Fulham grew impressively into the game and took the lead through Willian\u2019s deflected shot. Chelsea haven\u2019t been bad \u2013 they\u2019ve had 14 attempts at goal for a start \u2013 but they could be heading for a seventh defeat in 10 games.   Updated at 8.51pm GMT    8.46pm    45+1 min Three minutes of added time.     8.45pm    45+1 min \u201cFor anyone hoping for the return of Jose Mouribho to the PL, be careful what you wish for,\u201d says Mary Waltz. \u201cI recently watched the Roma v Bologna fixture. An early Roma goal followed by the most amazingly dull match with Roma killing the game for 75 minutes, Classic Jose, classic boredom.\u201d So you\u2019re saying it was another Mourinho masterclass?      8.45pm    45 min Vinicius has done very well as a stand-in for Mitrovic. He\u2019s up against three centre-backs but his physicality has caused them all problems, Chalobah in particular.     8.44pm    44 min Tete\u2019s deep cross is headed back across goal by Vinicius. Kepa almost makes a Horlicks of what looks a routine save, clawing the ball out in front of goal, but Thiago rescues him by booting it clear.     8.42pm    42 min This isn\u2019t news, but Fulham really are a terrific side. On paper their team doesn\u2019t look that great, but they play with so much confidence and purpose in attack.     8.41pm    41 min \u201cTo my eye Trevoh Chalobah has been appallingly bad today,\u201d writes Glenn Kuly, \u201cbut I remember how shaky Antonio R\u00fcdiger (and for that matter Andreas Christensen) used to look before they got some substantial playing time next to Thiago Silva. Hoping some of the latter\u2019s serenity under pressure similarly rubs off on the youngster (which can\u2019t happen any too soon for the Blues).\u201d I was just thinking the same. He looked really good last season, certainly in the games I saw, but he\u2019s been a bag of nerves tonight.     8.41pm    40 min: Good save by Leno! A long ball forward bounces awkwardly for Adarabioyo, which allows Havertz to nick the ball just inside the area. He turns and lays it off to Joao Felix, who takes a touch and cracks a low shot across goal that is well saved by Leno, plunging to his right. That\u2019s his best save so far.     8.39pm    38 min Havertz moves elegantly away from Robinson on the right. His cross is blocked at the near post by Ream, who then charges towards the loose ball to deflect Azpilicueta\u2019s follow-up shot over the bar.     8.37pm    36 min Chalobah is booked for a studs-up tackle on Palhinha. The Fulham players wanted a red card, but I think a yellow is just about right. His studs were showing but he was low enough for it count as reckless rather than dangerous.  Updated at 8.37pm GMT    8.35pm    34 min: Good save by Leno! Azpilicueta\u2019s cross is headed up in the air and drops towards Hall, arriving late in the box. He bobbles a shot on the run that deflects off Adarabioyo and is smartly saved to his right by Leno.     8.33pm    33 min Kovacic\u2019s cross bounces over the leaping Joao Felix, unmarked eight yards out, but again he was offside so it wouldn\u2019t have counted.   Updated at 8.42pm GMT    8.32pm    32 min A wicked inswinging free-kick from Pereira causes chaos in the Chelsea are. Eventually Thiago stabs the ball behind, taking it off the toe of a Fulham player (Vincius I think), and then the flag goes up for offside anyway.     8.31pm    31 min If it stays like that Fulham will be four points off a Champions League place. Yeah they\u2019ve played more games than the teams above them, but it\u2019s still a remarkable achievement.     8.30pm    30 min \u201cIf Chelsea pull the trigger on Potter, they should be forced to re-re-hire Mourinho,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cA) As punishment for ignoring all the \u2018long-term plan\u2019 talk, and B) For the entertainment of the rest of the league. (I wouldn\u2019t want him anywhere near a club I care about, but the league is inherently a better place when Jose\u2019s around.)\u201d      8.29pm    28 min: Chance for Joao Felix! Mount wins the ball high up the field, and Kovacic sweeps it forward to Joao Felix. He twists away from Adarabioyo, onto his left foot, but shoots straight at Leno from 15 yards.     8.27pm    27 min       8.26pm    Willian isn\u2019t celebrating, but almost everyone else in Craven Cottage is going mad. Decordova-Reid\u2019s cross was headed across the area by Chalobah and collected by Willian. He cut inside, dummied Azpilicueta a couple of times and hit a low drive that was going straight at Kepa \u2013 until it deflected off Chalobah and flew into the corner.   Updated at 8.29pm GMT    8.25pm   GOAL! Fulham 1-0 Chelsea (Willian 25)  Willian scores against his old club!   Updated at 8.30pm GMT    8.24pm    23 min: Decordova-Reid hits the bar! Leno\u2019s long goalkick was misjudged by Chalobah, who headed it straight to Vinicus. He played in Decordova-Reid to his right, and he rattled a first-time drive from 15 yards that thumped off the bar. Kepa didn\u2019t move.  Updated at 8.27pm GMT    8.21pm    21 min Fulham take a short corner on the right. Willian fires the ball back to Reed, who pings a sweet first-time shot from 25 yards that is blocked by one of the many Chelsea bodies near the penalty spot.     8.20pm    21 min \u201cForgive my ignorance but is Thursday night now a permanent fixture date for EPL matches?\u201d says Paulo Biriani. \u201cIf so, are you always the fixture MBMer?\u201d  No and hopefully, therefore, no. This game was rearranged after the death of the Queen in September. Having said that, I see Man City are playing Spurs a week tonight. And you won\u2019t believe who\u2019s on the rota.     8.18pm    19 min Chelsea are playing pretty well here, though I suppose the big test will come if they go behind again. Felix and Hall look bright on the left, and Kovacic has been excellent in midfield.     8.17pm    18 min Mount\u2019s outswinging corner is headed over by the backpedalling Thiago Silva. A half chance.     8.17pm    17 min \u201cThe internet being what it is these days, looking at any social media platform can be dangerous when assessing how fans actually feel about the club,\u201d says Justin Madson. \u201cThe hyper-unrealistic expectations by the loudest mouths tend to be incorrectly perceived and presented as such by the media as a wholly accurate depiction of how the general fanbase feels. Particularly when, as is the case with Potter, the media spends more time talking about how under pressure he is than anyone else does. I was thoroughly puzzled when certain outlets started running \u2018he\u2019s under pressure\u2019 articles regularly in the middle of the World Cup. From a totally calm and not at all worried Chelsea fan in Boehly-land.\u201d I completely agree with that, and it\u2019s a huge problem in all journalism, not just sport; the media have basically let a gobby minority take over the world, and look how that\u2019s turned out. But the chants from the away end on Sunday suggested it\u2019s not just Twitter\u2019s finest who are unhappy with Potter. I think the whole thing is ridiculous, particularly given all the talk of long-term planning when he took the job.     8.16pm    16 min: No penalty Hmm, Zakaria\u2019s a bit fortunate there. I suppose the argument is that it wasn\u2019t a clear and obvious error from David Coote, but had it been given on the field it wouldn\u2019t have been overturned.     8.16pm    16 min Vinicius goes down just inside the area after a clumsy and unnecessarsy tackle from Zakaria. David Coote says no penalty, but it\u2019s being checked by VAR.     8.14pm    14 min Joao Felix misses a decent chance, volleying Mount\u2019s cross wide from eight yards after going at it with the wrong foot, but he was offside.     8.14pm    14 min And now Pereira is booked for fouling Felix, who got himself between the man and the ball and went down as soon as there was contact. I\u2019m not saying he dived; it was clever play.   Updated at 8.19pm GMT    8.11pm    11 min Zakaria is a little fortunate to avoid a yellow card for a lunge at Pereira.     8.10pm    10 min The resulting free-kick is headed away to Kovacic, whose long-range volley hits his own player. Chelsea keep the ball alive and Kovacic feeds it out to Joao Felix, who drives wide of the near post from the left side of the area. A half chance at best.     8.09pm    10 min That yellow card means Robinson will miss Fulham\u2019s next league game: Newcastle away on Sunday.     8.09pm    9 min Robinson is booked for a foul on Joao Felix, who has looked the part in his first few minutes as a Chelsea player.     8.08pm    8 min Robinson surges down the left and hammers a low cross into Vinicius, 12 yards out. He turns smartly, despite the presence of Thiago, and cracks a shot on the turn that goes not far wide of the far post. Decent effort, that.     8.07pm    8 min Another inswinger from Pereira, another header away from Thiago, this time for a throw-in.     8.07pm    7 min Robinson\u2019s cross hits Chalobah and go behind for a corner. Andreas Pereira, who is having a fine season, wanders across to take it. His inswinger is headed behind for another corner by Thiago.     8.06pm    6 min Joao Felix looks sparky and full of confidence. I know his performance level fluctuates a fair bit, but at his best he\u2019s a delight. His skill and swagger might be just what Chelsea need.     8.05pm    4 min \u201cFirst of all, Potter was involved in a great project at Brighton and should not have left until the season finished,\u201d says Jeff Sachs. \u201cThis is the price for being hasty. And he is smart enough to have known what he was getting into...\u201d Ah come on. Even thogh I think Potter should have stayed at Brighton, I know full well that if I was in his position, I would have struggled to resist an offer from Chelsea. I suspect that applies to 99.94 per cent of us. Also, it\u2019s not over yet.     8.03pm    2 min: Chances plural for Chelsea! Joao Felix almost creates a goal inside two minutes. He moseyed over to the right wing, nutmegged Ream majestically and picked out Havertz near the penalty spot with a precise low cross. Havertz\u2019s right-foot shot was blocked, and Hall\u2019s slightly tame follow up was kicked away by Leno. They were both decent chances, Hall\u2019s in particular.    Updated at 8.06pm GMT    8.02pm    2 min Cesar Azpilicueta is playing at right wing-back, and Chelsea\u2019s attacking shape is as expected \u2013 Havertz up front with Joao Felix and Mount buzzing behind him.     8.00pm    1 min Peep peep! Fulham kick off from right to left as we watch.     7.59pm    This is Chelsea\u2019s first league game since the sad death of the adorable Gianluca Vialli, and the players have gathered round the centre circle to pay tribute with a minute\u2019s applause. Finding someone with a bad word to say about Vialli is needle/haystack territory.   Updated at 8.04pm GMT    7.58pm    \u201cThanks for the concern; a strep infection which is being treated with heavy duty antibiotics, and yes, I\u2019m much better,\u201d says Richard Hirst. \u201cOn football matters,I look at the strength of Chelsea\u2019s bench and I can\u2019t help feel that sympathy for their injury \u2018predicament\u2019 is a bit over the top. Not the weakest bench I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Well, they have just bought four players, which helps, but they are still missing some irreplaceables. I know it was only an hour at home to Bournemouth, but they looked a different team going forward when Reece James played. Very glad to hear you\u2019re okay; strep sounds thoroughly unpleasant.     7.51pm    \u201cSetting aside that Graham Potter surely knew what he was getting himself into, him saying that managing Chelsea is the hardest job in football is brilliant,\u201d says Matt Burtz. \u201cSucceed, and you\u2019re automatically the best manager in the world. Fail, and you\u2019re expected to because it\u2019s impossible to succeed. It\u2019s win win!\u201d I didn\u2019t like that comment. Potter is normally so considered and amiable and, though that hasn\u2019t really changed, there have been a few little signs that it\u2019s getting to him. I felt strongly at the time that he should wait for Arsenal or Spurs rather than go to Chelsea, because there are so many risks with that club and it was likely to be his only big job unless he succeeded.  Potter may have had assurances from Todd Boehly, but that\u2019s only part of the story \u2013 as we\u2019re seeing now, the media and a fanbase conditioned to instant gratification can make life very uncomfortable. I really hope it works out but I\u2019m losing faith.     7.51pm    Relationship status: it\u2019s complicated      7.45pm    \u201cWe are probably lucky QPR aren\u2019t in the PL, or Chelsea might well be fourth in the West London League,\u201d says Julian Menz. \u201cAs for the teams: are you sure it\u2019s Azpilicueta and not Chalobah at right wing-back?\u201d I\u2019m never sure about anything, least of all a Graham Potter formation, but that\u2019s how I expect them to line up. This graphic supports that idea, though I\u2019ve noticed a few clubs have started peddling tactical disinformation on their team graphics. What is the world coming to.      7.43pm    GP on JF      7.42pm    \u201cLying in a hospital room in SW France with the MBM to keep me company,\u201d says our resident Fulham fan Richard Hirst. \u201cI was hoping for three points to stimulate further improvement, but without Mitro I am trepidatious, and right now would bite your hand off for a non-stimulating 0-0. Still, I am sure I can rely on Dr Rob for sympathetic company.\u201d Oof, sorry to hear that. Are you okay?     7.16pm    Whether it\u2019s fair or not (it\u2019s not), Graham Potter is under increasing external pressure at Chelsea. If they lose tonight, the noise might become insufferable.      7.12pm    transition (tr\u00e6nz\u026a\u0283\u0259n ) 1. VARIABLE NOUN Transition is the process in which something changes from one state to another.      7.03pm   Team news: Joao Felix starts  Marco Silva makes one enforced change to the Fulham team that won their last Premier League game at Leicester. Carlos Vinicius replaces the suspended Aleksandar Mitrovic up front. Chelsea\u2019s big loan signing Joao Felix goes straight into the starting line-up, and, with Graham Potter switching to a back three, the impressive teenager Lewis Hall is preferred to Marc Cucurella at left wing-back. Overall there are four changes from Chelsea\u2019s previous league game, the defeat at home to Manchester City a week ago. Hall, Joao Felix, Trevoh Chalobah and Mason Mount replace Cucurella Hakim Ziyech and the injured pair of Raheem Sterling and Christian Pulisic. Fulham (4-2-3-1) Leno; Tete, Adarabioyo, Ream, Robinson; Reed, Palhinha; Decordova-Reid, Pereira, Willian; Vinicius.Substitutes: Rodak, Kurzawa, Diop, Chalboah, Harris, Cairney, Wilson, James, Solomon. Chelsea (3-4-2-1) Kepa; Chalobah, Thiago Silva, Koulibaly; Azpilicueta, Zakaria, Kovacic, Hall; Mount, Joao Felix; Havertz.Substitutes: Bettinelli, Cucurella, Badiashile, Chukwuemeka, Jorginho, Gallagher, Ziyech, Aubameyang, Fofana. Referee David Coote.  Updated at 8.28pm GMT    7.00pm   Preamble  What do we have here then? A west London derby in which Fulham are the pre-eminent team in SW6, that\u2019s what. They begin tonight\u2019s game in seventh, three places and three points ahead of Chelsea, who are in danger of winning the transfer window and losing everything else. The last time Fulham started a league game against Chelsea in a higher position was 2 April 1983*, a 1-1 draw at Craven Cottage in the old Division Two. All the pre-match talk has been, a little tediously, about whether Graham Potter should be sacked for his inability to build Rome in half an hour. Marco Silva knows all about P45s, having been sacked by Sporting Lisbon, Watford and Everton, but there was always a lot to like about his management and he has quietly done a spectacular job at Craven Cottage. Fulham won the Championship in his first season, scoring 106 goals in the process, and have held their own against allcomers in the Premier League. Their late defeats at Arsenal, Manchester City and Manchester United were all unfortunate, and the only time they took a pasting was when they had 10 men for most of a 4-1 defeat at home to Newcastle. They have won all four games since Qatar, whereas Chelsea have lost seven of the last nine and are without almost an entire team of senior players. I was going to say that, even without the suspended Aleksandar Mitrovic, Fulham will be provide a stiff test for Chelsea. But given the league positions and recent form, we should probably be assessing that the other way round. Kick off 8pm. * I think. Look, I checked it once and I might have made a mistake but I don\u2019t have time to go back over 40 years of league tables again, okay. This is a blog, your honour, not a judicial review!

The last word goes to Ryan Price, who got some insight on the origins of the term \u201cstonewall\u201d from Martin in Z\u00fcrich. \u201cTell Martin to email me, I live in Z\u00fcrich too.\u201d Football live blogs, forging friendships since 2022. Here\u2019s Louise Taylor\u2019s report from St James\u2019 Park, for those looking for some extra reading.      7.53pm    Here\u2019s another stat which makes grim reading for Chelsea. This is the first time they have lost three games on the bounce in all competitions since 2002 (excluding matches decided by penalty shootout).  Updated at 7.53pm GMT    7.45pm    Chris Waddle, the former Newcastle midfielder, is jubilant over on BBC Radio 5 Live. \u201cNewcastle deserved it,\u201d he says. \u201cThat bit of pushing and shoving from Chelsea was the most fight we have seen from them all night.\u201d     7.40pm    What are Opta saying? They know their stats, there\u2019s no denying it.      7.38pm    When was the last time Chelsea went five games without a win in the league? Glad you asked. It was in 2012 under the stewardship of Roberto Di Matteo and Rafa Ben\u00edtez. Oof.     7.31pm   Full time, Newcastle 1-0 Chelsea  The final whistle goes and there\u2019s a predictable bout of pushing and shoving as Chelsea\u2019s frustrations boil over. They will go into the winter break on a run of five league games without a win, while Newcastle leapfrog Tottenham into third.  Updated at 7.32pm GMT    7.29pm    90+7 min Longstaff is booked for a spicy challenge. Jamaal Lascelles is booked on the sidelines for dissent.     7.28pm    90+6 min Burn barges over Havertz off the ball and Mendy comes up for the ensuing free kick. It\u2019s cleared and Newcastle counter through Joelinton, but Cucurella comes across to dispossess him before he can lob the ball into the empty net.     7.26pm    90+5 min Pope is booked, seemingly for saying something naughty.     7.25pm    90+4 min Chelsea move the ball from side to side but can\u2019t find a way through. Koulibaly plays a desperate long ball up to Havertz, but Newcastle defend it well.  Updated at 7.25pm GMT    7.23pm    90+2 min Joelinton takes it to the corner. It\u2019s that stage of the match for Newcastle.     7.22pm    An interesting observation from Paul Fitzgerald via email. \u201cHavertz looks like a great technician who scores too many odd goals, and as a result lives in a striker/midfield wasteland.\u201d     7.21pm    90 mins There\u2019ll be seven minutes of injury time here. Can Chelsea dig out an equaliser?     7.21pm    88 min Koulibaly goes into the book after scything down Almir\u00f3n to the right of the area. Trippier steps up, but his delivery fails to find a teammate.     7.18pm    86 min Botman goes down with a knock. Howe brings on Matt Targett in his place.     7.16pm    84 min Howe makes his second substitution, bringing off Willock for Murphy.     7.15pm    83 min Kovacic loses the ball in midfield, then chops down Wilson in an attempt to get it back. Jones opts against a booking.     7.13pm    80 min Nerves for Newcastle! Chelsea look much sharper in possession, moving the ball about at pace. It comes to Cucurella out wide on the left and he pings a cross to the near post, where Havertz ghosts in but fails to connect. There\u2019s a scramble in the area before the hosts finally lump it clear.     7.10pm    78 min Pulisic makes inroads down the left and whips a cross into the box, but Burn clears at the cost of a corner. Havertz climbs highest, but heads wide.     7.07pm    75 min Newcastle make their first change, Wilson coming on for Wood as Howe looks to kill the game.     7.04pm    74 min Sorry, make that a triple substitution. Havertz is on for Broja.     7.04pm    73 min Potter makes a double substitution, bringing on Cucurella and Hakim Ziyech for Hall and Mount.     7.03pm    71 min Longstaff is down after a tackle from Hall. It\u2019s a painful one, but it looks like he\u2019ll be OK to continue.     7.00pm    Another contribution on the origins of \u201cstonewall\u201d, this time from Martin in Z\u00fcrich. \u201cI can help Ryan with that one. A stone wall is something very solid, so claiming a stonewall pen is a shout without doubt. Surely a much clearer case than stone cold. Whatever that is supposed to mean.\u201d     6.59pm   GOAL! Newcastle 1-0 Chelsea (Willock 67)  At last, we have our opener. Almir\u00f3n latches on to a bouncing ball, escapes Kalidou Koulibaly, controls it twice with his head and dribbles it over to Willock, who casually curls it into the back of the net.   Updated at 7.03pm GMT    6.56pm    64 min Good save! Gallagher jinks forwards on the edge of the area and unleashes a shot which Pope pushes round the post with his fingertips. That\u2019s Chelsea\u2019s best chance of the match so far.     6.55pm    From Jim McKendrick on Twitter: \u201cTrippier is booked for bringing down Pulisic as he tries to break. Do we call this nominative determinism?\u201d Very good.     6.54pm    62 min Broja makes his way up the left flank, but paints himself into a corner. Chelsea keep the ball and Kovacic has a go from just outside the box, but it\u2019s blocked.     6.52pm    Back on Twitter \u2013 how are things going over there? All fine? \u2013 we\u2019ve had a helpful contribution on the origins of \u201cstonewall penalty\u201d.      6.50pm    57 min Danger! Willock gets in behind on the left and whips the ball across the face of goal. Hall is forced into a desperate intervention, stabbing it behind for a corner after it narrowly evades Wood. Howe has his hands on his head on the sidelines.     6.47pm    56 min Trippier is booked for bringing down Pulisic as he tries to break.     6.46pm     55 min Chelsea try to calm things down, but only invite more pressure. Mendy continues to look uncomfortable with the ball.     6.44pm    More correspondence, this time from Ryan Price. \u201cHow happy I was to read Brian Robson mentioning \u201cstone cold\u201d. My biggest bug bear is pundits going on about a \u201cstonewall\u201d penalty. What on earth (I\u2019m being polite) does that mean?\u201d     6.43pm    50 min So close! Trippier gets in a menacing cross which is headed down by Joelinton. Wood latches on to it, but Mendy saves at point-blank range. Guimar\u00e3es has a crack on the follow-up, but it\u2019s blocked. Newcastle recycle the ball and Almir\u00f3n tees up Longstaff, but he fires over.     6.41pm    49 min The two sides have picked up where they left off, making a choppy start to the second half. Broja is bullied off the ball as he looks to get up the pitch.     6.39pm    There\u2019s been a half-time change for Chelsea, with Potter bringing on Christian Pulisic for Azpilicueta.   Updated at 6.49pm GMT    6.37pm   Second half kicks off  We\u2019re back in action at St James\u2019 Park.  Updated at 6.37pm GMT    6.36pm    Finally, a self-confessed rant from Brian Robson (not that one). \u201cThat was a stone-cold penalty with an arm dragging away from his body and stopping a pass, so where was VAR on that one?\u201d     6.35pm    Brendan Large tweets: \u201cAlright Will, just wondering if you have any idea how Potter was thinking this team would score goals? Literally one attacker on the pitch and no go forward attitude. Hall has been Chelsea\u2019s best player by a stretch I\u2019d say.\u201d It\u2019s a fair question, Brendan, with Broja looking isolated for much of the first half. Mount has had his moments, but there\u2019s no getting past the fact that Chelsea have had one shot. Liquid football, it is not.     6.32pm    Julian Menz writes in with some queries: \u201cCan you tell us more about how Chelsea are set up? Is Hall playing wing-back, was Loftus-Cheek playing wing-back? Is Azpilicueta now playing wing-back since Silva\u2019s introduction?\u201d In answer to your first question, Julian: yes, and apologies for not having done so already. Potter has set up his side in a 3-4-2-1 formation, with Hall and Loftus-Cheek starting at left and right wing-back respectively. Since Loftus-Cheek was forced off, Silva has dropped into the back three and C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta has been shunted over to the right flank. Chelsea\u2019s midfield pairing of Jorginho and Kovacic are struggling for control and there\u2019s been very little play through the middle, with the visitors\u2019 only shot of the half coming from a cross \u2013 from Hall \u2013 out on the left.     6.22pm   Half-time  Neither side have been at their best, but Newcastle have looked more likely to make a breakthrough. Chelsea\u2019s attack has been utterly leaden for long stretches, even if their defence has largely held up well under pressure. Elsewhere \u2026     Updated at 6.30pm GMT    6.20pm    45+1 min The home fans roar for a penalty after Burn gets a low cross in which brushes Trevoh Chalobah\u2019s arm. Robert Jones, the referee, waves away their appeals.     6.18pm    44 min Joelinton cuts inside off the left flank in search of an opening, but he\u2019s crowded out.     6.16pm    We\u2019ve had some email correspondence. \u201cGreat game,\u201d says Richie Bradford. It\u2019s hard to tell, but that could well be sarcasm.     6.15pm    42 min Over the last 10 minutes, Newcastle have had 72% possession. They are making a strong end to the first half.   Updated at 6.19pm GMT    6.13pm     41 min Mendy collects the corner gratefully. Neither side has made much of their set pieces so far.     6.12pm    40 min Almir\u00f3n dribbles past three men in midfield to spark an attack which ends with Burn having a crack, which is deflected wide. Another corner to Newcastle.     6.11pm    38 min The corner falls for Willock on the edge of the box, but he can\u2019t force a shot through the seething mass of blue shirts.     6.10pm    37 min Tripper plays in Longstaff out wide on the right. He gets a probing cross into the box, which Silva clears at the cost of a corner.     6.09pm    35 min Mason Mount dinks a ball over Newcastle\u2019s back line to the onrushing Broja. Sven Botman pops up as the last defender to make a crucial intervention and head it away.     6.07pm    34 min Burn marauds into a vast ocean of space before moving the ball on to Willock. He picks out Guimar\u00e3es, who has a go from distance. The shot is deflected and bounces away.     6.04pm    31 min Sean Longstaff saunters up to the edge of the area before picking out Kieran Trippier to his right. He gets an inviting cross to the near post, but nobody gets on the end of it.     6.02pm    29 min Jorginho catches Guimar\u00e3es across the ankles in midfield and, despite making a big show of apologising, gets the first booking of the game.     6.01pm    28 min But wait a minute! The visitors go on a sweeping attack which ends with Hall picking out Broja in the box. He turns on his heel and gets a shot away, but it\u2019s straight at Pope. The Newcastle goalkeeper makes a straightforward save.     5.59pm    26 min Newcastle have a semi-dangerous spell, Joelinton whipping a cross into the box which narrowly evades his teammates. Chelsea look increasingly constricted.     5.58pm    24 min Willock dispossesses Gallagher in midfield and goes on a bounding run into the box, but loses the ball at the crucial moment.     5.53pm    20 min Still no shots on target. Both sides are playing way too much football in the middle third of the pitch.     5.50pm    17 min Chelsea go on the attack but Hall misjudges a cross and it sails out for a goal kick.     5.48pm    15 min Finally, we have a shot. Willock lifts in a cross which is cleared as far as Miguel Almir\u00f3n, who sends a volley looping over the crossbar.  Updated at 5.53pm GMT    5.48pm    14 min Newcastle are trying to press Mendy with the ball at his feet, with the Chelsea goalkeeper receiving some criticism recently for his distribution under pressure. He deals with it, just about.  Updated at 5.52pm GMT    5.45pm    12 min \u00c9douard Mendy slices a clearance straight to Dan Burn, but he fails to control the ball and it trickles out for a throw-in.     5.44pm    11 min Bruno Guimar\u00e3es overhits an attempted final ball which bobbles out for a goal kick. It\u2019s been that kind of a game so far.     5.42pm    9 min Newcastle try to play their way through the middle, but Joe Willock\u2019s final ball is intercepted. Chelsea make a half-hearted attempt at a counterattack, but it fizzles out.   Updated at 6.03pm GMT    5.39pm    6 min Potter is forced to make an early change, replacing the injured Loftus-Cheek with Silva.     5.38pm    4 min Ruben Loftus-Cheek is down clutching his leg, while Sch\u00e4r is also in some discomfort after taking a knock to the head in his coming-together with Broja. It\u2019s unclear whether or not they\u2019ll be able to continue.   Updated at 5.49pm GMT    5.34pm    2 min The free kick comes to nothing, Nick Pope gathering with ease. Newcastle get a free kick of their own, which is cleared.     5.32pm   Kick off!  Chelsea get us started. Broja is fouled almost immediately by Fabian Sch\u00e4r, giving the visitors a free kick out wide on the left.     5.31pm    St James\u2019 Park observes a minute\u2019s silence ahead of Remembrance Sunday. We\u2019re about to get under way.     5.26pm    Five minutes to go until kick-off. Can you feel the hype?  Updated at 5.26pm GMT    5.25pm    Newcastle have dropped to fourth after Tottenham\u2019s 4-3 win against Leeds. Chelsea remain eighth.      5.20pm   Potter talks up Hall ahead of league debut  Asked about Hall\u2019s first Premier League appearance, Potter is full of praise for the 18-year-old. \u201cYou saw his quality against Manchester City [in the Carabao Cup in midweek], he\u2019s calm under pressure, he can take the ball and take responsibility. He gets up and down the pitch, he gives you good width and attacks the box when he can.  \u201cHe miscued a couple against Man City in the week, but [he\u2019s got a] great attitude and a good temperament. So, again, it\u2019s exciting for him and I\u2019m looking forward to seeing him play.\u201d      5.15pm    Potter tells Sky Sports that Sterling and Cucurella have been ill, which is why the former is out of the squad and the latter has only made the bench. He suggests that Sterling should be fine to travel to Qatar with England.     5.11pm    The warm-ups are in progress. We\u2019ve got a little under 20 minutes until kick-off.      5.04pm    Here\u2019s a stat for you. We all like stats, don\u2019t we?      5.00pm    Potter, by contrast, has overhauled the team which lost 1-0 to Arsenal last Sunday. In attack, Armando Broja and Conor Gallagher swap in for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Raheem Sterling. In defence, Thiago Silva and Marc Cucurella make way for Kalidou Koulibaly and Lewis Hall, with the latter making his Premier League debut. Plus, Kai Havertz is out and Mateo Kovacic is in. That\u2019s five changes in total.      4.49pm    Howe has made two changes to the side which beat Southampton 4-1 last weekend, a victory so emphatic that it did for Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl. Chris Wood and Joelinton come in for Callum Wilson and Jacob Murphy, giving Newcastle a bit more height across their front line. Joelinton was suspended for the Southampton match but, having been integral to the team under Howe, his return is no surprise. Wilson has been ill this week, which explains why Wood starts.      4.36pm   Chelsea team news  \u2026 and here\u2019s the Chelsea lineup.      4.35pm   Newcastle team news  Here\u2019s Eddie Howe\u2019s starting XI.      4.32pm   Preamble  It\u2019s going to be an introspective Christmas for Graham Potter if Chelsea drop more points this evening. Winless in four in the Premier League and down to eighth, the new manager bounce is well and truly over. Having said that he intends to use the winter break \u201cto rejuvenate, to recover, to reflect and to improve\u201d, Potter could do with something positive to ruminate over. Another setback here would conjure up bleak images of him sporting an enormous shaggy beard, sitting in an isolated cabin in the Swedish tundra somewhere and staring absently into a log fire with the wind whistling outside. Of course, with Newcastle up to third and looking ominously good, Chelsea will need a much-improved performance to emerge victorious. With two goals in their last four matches, their faltering attack has been an area of particular concern. Newcastle, meanwhile, have the joint-best defence in the league, having conceded only 11 goals all season. That could be a troublesome combination for the visitors.   Updated at 4.34pm GMT "

If you have lost a loved one, or know someone who has, you will likely know that there is nothing quite like grief. It can be incredibly isolating, disorienting, painful, long-lasting. It can be all of these, or none. Grieving is a personal experience, and no two of us share the same journey.

                    "body": "  2.44pm    And here\u2019s our report from Leigh Sports Village. That\u2019s all from me \u2013 thanks for reading!      2.27pm   Full-time! Manchester United 1-4 Manchester City  City makes their way once again into United territory through the elegant Weir, but United recover the ball and spring one last attack through Hanson, who cuts in from the left and flashes a right-foot shot over Roebuck\u2019s bar. And that\u2019s that \u2013 City head into the quarter-finals after a second-half display of the utmost authority.     2.22pm    90 mins: Blakstad is denied a goal by the referee\u2019s whistle. She turns the ball home after Shaw\u2019s shot is parried but the referee blows up for a foul by Raso on on Batlle, who was rushing in to clear and got a cheeky shove from the City attacker.  Updated at 2.22pm GMT    2.18pm    86 mins: City are playing out the final stages with composure, Raso and Bronze linking up well on the right before Hemp\u2019s low cross is cut out by Earps.     2.14pm    83 mins: Booking for Stanway, who left a foot in on Ona Batlle, but Zelem\u2019s delivery is no good and easily claimed by Roebuck.     2.12pm   Goal! Manchester United 1-4 Manchester City (Shaw 79)  And 39 seconds after coming on, the two subs combine immediately for City fourth. Blakstad makes her way down the left and into the United box before unleashing a shot across the face of Earps\u2019 goal which the keeper can only palm out towards the waiting Shaw, who slot into an open goal.     2.10pm    77 mins: Roebuck shows her (over)confidence with the ball at her feet, attempting to pick her way past a couple of United attackers inside her own box. Her dribble isn\u2019t a success, and having been tackled she collapses on to the ball and picks it up. Double change for City: Hemp and White for Blakstad and Shaw.     2.07pm    73 mins: Zelem\u2019s dinked free-kick causes chaos, with Roebuck coming to claim but not getting there and the ball getting lost in a forest of legs. Eventually it breaks to Toone on the edge of the box, but she has to lift a hurried shot over a crowd of players and the ball sails just over the bar.  Updated at 2.07pm GMT    2.05pm    72 mins: Galton carries the ball forward again, laying off to Zelem before the attack fizzles out down United\u2019s right. Bronze boots the ball up to White, who is isolated and fails to hold it up. United recover the ball and attack through Hanson, who wins a soft free-kick in the corner after an apparent foul by Stokes.     2.02pm    69 mins: Raso clatters Galton, who gets up and feeds the overlapping Blundell. Her looping cross doesn\u2019t quite find the head of Bruun, but that\u2019s better from United.     1.58pm    66 mins: The first decent attack of the half from United as Galton scampers up the left, cuts inside and drift an angled cross towards Russo, who\u2019s flicked header skips just wide. That\u2019s Russo\u2019s last involvement: United bring on Bruun and Hanson for her and Thomas.     1.55pm    64 mins: United need to gather themselves. They are still trying to play their way out from the back but are finding it hard to beat the City press, and can\u2019t really get out of their half. City meanwhile are playing with time and space.     1.53pm   Goal! Manchester United 1-3 Manchester City (Weir 60)  Another City goal, another United error. City attack down the left via Hemp, who picks out Weir, lurking in the corner of the United box. Her left-footed shot is struck well enough but it\u2019s straight at Earps, who allows the ball to squirm under her and inside the near post. Two in two minutes for City, who look home and dry.   Updated at 2.16pm GMT    1.51pm   Goal! Manchester United 1-2 Manchester City (White 58)  It\u2019s a horrible moment for Hannah Blundell. The left back is running back towards her own goal, chasing an awkwardly bouncing long ball, and opts to head back to her keeper from about 20 yards out. But she doesn\u2019t put enough power on it, and the alert Ellen White gets there ahead of Earps, rounds the keeper and slots home.   Updated at 2.15pm GMT    1.48pm    55 mins: United relieve the pressure and win a free-kick in the City half, but Zelem\u2019s lofted delivery is easily cleared. City break with a flowing move that ends with Raso arrowing the ball across the box, but her cross has no taker.     1.46pm    52 mins: City continue to turn the screw, Stanway\u2019s floated cross well caught by Earps amid a horde of bodies. Earps spots a runner upfield and looks to spring a quick counterattack but White knocks the ball out of her hands and collects a booking.     1.43pm   Goal! Manchester United 1-1 Manchester City (Hemp 50)  City are level and the half-time changes have made an instant impact. This time it\u2019s Raso: she\u2019s charging down the right flank and is picked out by picked out by Walsh. She reaches the byline and puts in a low cross which White, in the six-yard box, completely misses \u2026 but Hemp is waiting at the back post and slots home right-footed.   Updated at 2.14pm GMT    1.39pm    46 mins: We\u2019re back under way. Two half-time changes for City: Raso and Weir come on for Park and Losada. And Weir is involved immediately, meet ing a deep cross with a back-post header gathered by Earps.     1.26pm    A bit of half-time reading:       1.21pm   Half-time! Manchester United 1-0 Manchester City  An impressive defensive display from Manchester United is the main thing to take from that 45 minutes of action. City have been restricted to the odd one or two half-chances. Which is impressive considering their array of attacking talent. Katie Zelem\u2019s goal, direct from a corner, has given United the edge. I\u2019ll be off now and will hand you over to my colleague, Alex Hess, for the second half.   Updated at 1.23pm GMT    1.20pm    45 min + 2: City\u2019s Losada has gone down injured. She hobbles off for treatment. City pump a free-kick towards the United goal, but it bounces harmlessly out, and the half-time whistle goes.     1.17pm    44 min: \u201cThis would be a horrific time for City to concede,\u201d says the BBC co-commentator after Man Utd win a free-kick in a dangerous area. Steady on. Man Utd try a sneaky free-kick routine with a low ball into the near post but Roebuck gathers. Horror is averted.  Updated at 1.17pm GMT    1.15pm    42 min: Losada hits a low corner in from the City right. Bronze kills it with a lovely first touch and hammers a right-footed shot which is rising, and would nestle in the top corner, but it flashes just wide of the post! That is one of the best opportunities City have created. Is it going to be one of those days for Gareth Taylor\u2019s side?     1.12pm    39 min: The Man Utd goalie Mary Earps claims a City delivery well, but then immediately coughs up possession with a kick from hand. United are exposed and White tries to head goalwards after a ball from the left wing. She can only get minimal contact on it, taking the ball away from Park who is lurking beyond her at the far post.  Updated at 1.13pm GMT    1.09pm    36 min: Leah Galton pulls off the latest bit of accomplished defending for the hosts as City break down the right. City immediately come again down the same wing, Bronze hitting an intelligent ball to the edge of the penalty area, but again there is no clear sight of goal for City.     1.05pm    33 min: Greenwood hits a fine raking pass to the right wing, for Park. Park fires a cross to the far post. City win a corner but again United clear their lines.     1.03pm    30 min: After a defensive slip, there is a glimmer of a chance for City\u2019s Ellen White, who advances into space and into the Man Utd penalty area. Thorisdottir, however, is on hand to shepherd the England forward away from goal, a really assured piece of defending. Lauren Hemp then makes a dart down the City left but is double-tackled. Yet more good defending by Manchester United.     12.59pm    27 min: With United on the front foot again, Toone tries to turn two defenders in one hit with a lovely piece of skill in a central position, but is eventually crowded out of it. Toone then feeds her teammate Thomas, who finds space and shapes nicely for a low right-footed shot from the edge of the box. Roebuck dives to her left and saves comfortably enough.     12.56pm    24 min: Stokes and Hemp link down the City left. United\u2019s defence is all present and correct and they repel the danger. At this rate Gareth Taylor, the City manager, is going to shake things up at half-time or soon after.  Updated at 12.57pm GMT    12.52pm    20 min: Perhaps surprisingly, City are yet to create a clear-cut chance. Which is a testament to how well United are defending. Thorisdottir in particular looks up for the challenge today and is a commanding presence in the centre of the Man Utd defence as they look to press high. The manager, Marc Skinner, did say he wanted his players to be more aggressive without the ball today. But can they maintain this level of pressing for the whole match?  Updated at 12.55pm GMT    12.50pm    17 min: City now win a corner. Greenwood bends a good delivery towards the back stick. It\u2019s knocked back towards goal by a City head, but Earps claims it safely. There is plenty of noise from the home fans, delighted to see their side in front in Manchester.     12.46pm   Goal! 13 min: Man United 1-0 Man City (Zelem)  Following that superb save by Roebuck from the snap shot by Toone, Zelem bends a corner in again, from the United left ... and it curls straight in at the far post!! United lead and they deserve it on the balance of play so far. They\u2019ve been on the front foot following a good first five minutes for the visitors. Roebuck won\u2019t be happy with the defending, though, or indeed her own positioning as she let that ball drop straight into the net.    Updated at 1.01pm GMT    12.44pm    12 min: A cracking effort by Ella Toone, from an angle for Manchester United! Roebuck tips it over the bar, an incredible save!     12.42pm    9 min: Man United win a corner. Zelem hits an excellent ball into the danger area from the United left. City\u2019s Lucy Bronze flicks it with her head at the near post \u2013 and Maria Thorisdottir is there for United at the far post as the ball arrives there, and heads goalwards but over the crossbar. Ellen White did just enough, in defence, to put her opponent off, although perhaps Thorisdottir would have hoped to do better.  Updated at 12.43pm GMT    12.39pm    6 min: The referee has a pointed chat with Katie Zelem after full-blooded challenge from the Manchester United player.  Arsenal have flown into a 3-0 lead away at Liverpool in one of today\u2019s other ties, which kicked off at 12pm. Goals from Katie McCabe and Caitlin Foord and an OG by Rhiannon Roberts.  Updated at 12.40pm GMT    12.35pm    4 min: Ellen White hits a fairly speculative early shot for City which is straight at Mary Earps in the United goal.  Updated at 12.36pm GMT    12.34pm    2 min: With the team pushing up the pitch, Caldwell nearly gives the ball away in defence for United, but manages to recover the situation. City come again, and Demi Stokes races down the left wing. But United deal with the danger. City have settled into this quicker, however, and are passing the ball around with authority.  Updated at 12.35pm GMT    12.32pm   First half kick-off!  The players take the knee \u2013 there is no room for racism \u2013 and the game begins. Who will book their passage into the last eight of the women\u2019s FA Cup?  Updated at 12.48pm GMT    12.31pm    Ellen White, the City captain, is wearing a yellow armband instead of white, to show solidarity with Ukraine following the Russian invasion.     12.29pm    The teams are out and we\u2019re ready to go. It\u2019s a cold and clear day and definitely on the breezy side in Manchester.  Updated at 12.30pm GMT    12.22pm    Marc Skinner, the Man Utd manager, speaks to the BBC: \u201cIt\u2019s the mindset of today that\u2019s going to be most important ... we needed to be more aggressive without the ball [in that recent WSL loss].\u201d Skinner\u2019s counterpart Gareth Taylor is asked if that 1-0 WSL win two weeks ago will make any difference: \u201cIt gives us confidence ... for us it\u2019s about reinforcing what we did really well ... confidence-wise, I think it helps us.\u201d   Updated at 12.28pm GMT    12.20pm   Team news  Man City are unchanged from that 1-0 win two weeks ago. For Man Utd, Leah Galton, Martha Thomas, Jackie Groenen come into the side with Hayley Ladd, Vilde Risa and Signe Bruun drop out.       12.14pm    The Women\u2019s FA Cup offers a chance to dream for players and fans of smaller clubs. We are following the journey from the first round proper to the final and ahead of the fifth round, we bring you photographer Judie Tingle\u2019s visit to the City Ground for Nottingham Forest\u2019s game against three time FA Cup winners Manchester City      12.04pm   Preamble  Caroline Weir\u2019s magnificent late chip settled the WSL meeting between these sides a fortnight ago, as Manchester City edged to a narrow home win against their city rivals.  A quirk of the fixture schedule means the two Manchester giants immediately meet each other again in the fifth round of the women\u2019s FA Cup \u2013 albeit after a two-week break for international matches, and victory for Sarina Wiegman\u2019s England in the Arnold Clark Cup. Manchester United may sit fourth in the WSL table with Manchester City fifth, but league form naturally goes out of the window in any derby cup clash. It should be every bit as hard-fought as that recent WSL encounter: team news and pre-match reading coming up.  Updated at 12.06pm GMT "

                    "body": "Thomas Tuchel said that nothing will change for him after Roman Abramovich passed stewardship of Chelsea to trustees of the club\u2019s charitable foundation. Tuchel, who also defended his decision to bring on Kepa Arrizabalaga for penalties in the Carabao Cup final against Liverpool on Sunday,on Sunday, which they then lost 11-10, insisted he is not concerned after a weekend of drama at Chelsea. Abramovich\u2019s move to relinquish the running of Chelsea came after a call in parliament for him to be sanctioned and was said to have been provoked by the growing focus on him following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.  However the Russian, who announced the move on Saturday evening, remains Chelsea\u2019s owner and the club\u2019s leadership structure has not altered significantly. The charitable foundation is headed by Bruce Buck, the club\u2019s chairman, and football decisions by the powerful director, Marina Granovskaia, and the technical and performance adviser, Petr Cech, both of whom are already close with Tuchel. \u201cI think it will change nothing for me on a daily basis,\u201d Tuchel said. \u201cThis is how I understand it. I am in close contact with Marina and Petr Cech to run the first team of Chelsea football club and to give my input in this and give my very best to win football matches. This will not change with the news from yesterday.\u201d There was a poignancy to the occasion as the Wembley crowd stood as one before the game to show support for Ukraine. \u201cFootball stands together\u201d was the message on the big screens before kick-off, there were Ukrainian flags in the crowd and the players of both sides came together to show unity after entering the field of play. The action would begin only after Tuchel and his Liverpool counterpart, J\u00fcrgen Klopp, removed blue and yellow flowers from the pitch before watching their sides lock horns in a thrilling contest. Chelsea have lost their past four domestic finals but Tuchel said he had no regrets about losing 11-10 on penalties. The German refused to blame Arrizabalaga after bringing the goalkeeper on for \u00c9douard Mendy just before the shootout. Arrizabalaga, who had helped Chelsea to win three shootouts this season, was beaten by each of Liverpool\u2019s takers and lifted the decisive kick over the bar. \u201cI feel bad for him,\u201d Tuchel said. \u201cBut no blame. We took the decision because Kepa is training with the players on a daily basis at penalties. They know how good he is. He has more time than Edou to do this. Everyone knows how good he is. This plays a part in how well we shot today. \u201cUnfortunately he could not save any. It was a bit harsh on him to miss the one and only penalty. But there is no blame. I take the decisions when I take the decisions. I only take them when I want to take them. I cannot rejudge my decisions when I know the outcome. \u201cThis is how it is. No blame on him. Blame on me. Sometimes it works out, sometimes it does not work out. This is life as a football coach who does substitutions. Sometimes you bring a player on and he scores. Sometimes he makes a decisive mistake. No regrets. If it is necessary to take the blame, absolutely it is on me.\u201d Liverpool had a potential winner for Jo\u00ebl Matip ruled out for a tight offside and Chelsea, who also had two Kai Havertz strikes chalked off, were aggrieved that Romelu Lukaku had a goal ruled out by VAR. \u201cWe have to accept the quality of the opponent,\u201d Tuchel said. \u201cThis is the most dangerous attacking side in Europe at the moment. Defending like this and playing like this made me very proud today. I had the feeling we created a bit more but maybe that is subjective. This game easily could have gone either way. You need a bit of luck. If you look at the line drawn for the goal of Romelu it is a bit of a weird line [for offside]. But that\u2019s it. We cannot have any regrets.\u201d  Klopp praised Caoimh\u00edn Kelleher after starting Liverpool\u2019s No 2 goalkeeper instead of Alisson Becker. \u201cIt\u2019s been quite a journey from the boy I first saw to the man he is now,\u201d Liverpool\u2019s manager said. Kelleher, 23, was asked what Klopp said to him after Arrizabalaga\u2019s penalty confirmed Liverpool\u2019s victory. \u201cHe just said: \u2018Well done for scoring the winning penalty, there\u2019s a wall with all the goalkeepers on who have won cups so now you can go on that,\u2019\u201d the Irishman said."

                    "body": "The plan\nChelsea claimed their third successive Women\u2019s Super League title last season, chasing, matching and finally usurping Arsenal in the final stretch.\nThey operated in the Gunners\u2019 shadow for more than half the season. But when Arsenal lapsed against Birmingham, the unlikeliest of opponents to be beaten by, Chelsea took advantage to propel themselves to another title.\nThis season there is no doubt Emma Hayes has eyes on more than domestic glory. Last season\u2019s discouraging Champions League campaign means there is work to be done. Chelsea\u2019s exit at the group stage after losing at Wolfsburg, where they had no response to four goals, revealed an inability to shore up midfield gaps and prevent high-pressing teams from wreaking havoc.\n\nCast your mind back to the season before where the Blues made it to the final and were rocked by four goals from Barcelona; you may remember similar issues in the knockout stages against Wolfsburg and Bayern Munich.\nHayes has been ruthless in seeking to resolve those problems, evident in Chelsea\u2019s summer transfer business.\nEnter stage right: former Lyon defender Kadeisha Buchanan, France\u2019s \u00c8ve P\u00e9risset, wing-back Katerina Svitkova, Swedish powerhouse Johanna Rytting Kaneryd and Serbian pass-master Jelena Cankovic \u2013 signings that Hayes claim \u201cfit the profile Chelsea were looking for\u201d.\nThey may take time to gel, and that much was evident in Chelsea\u2019s pre-season defeat by Lyon in the Champions Cup. But if anyone can bring calm to the chaos in September\u2019s games, it is Hayes.\n\nThe manager\nHayes enters her 11th season with Chelsea, and perhaps her most compelling yet. The past few campaigns have made it apparent she is adapting with the rest of Europe, transitioning to a more possession-based style. Players such as Melanie Leupolz and more recently Cankovic suggest as much. The next level is to reproduce that in Europe with a strong midfield pivot and a ruthless No 10.\nKey player\nFran Kirby plays in the hole with an unrelenting ferocity, and is the key to unlocking defences. Alongside Sam Kerr, Kirby has become one of the league\u2019s most potent attackers. This summer she was able to give England fans a taste of that same fervour in a winning Euros campaign. Kirby was sidelined with a fatigue-related illness in the months preceding the tournament but, with professional help, was able to return to fitness and become one of the standout players.\n\nBig summer signing\nThe centre-back Buchanan, a former member of Lyon\u2019s all-conquering team. If you don\u2019t already know the name, memorise it. The introduction of the Canada international signifies a likely use of a back three \u2013 a defensive formation that served Chelsea well in the latter half of last season\u2019s campaign. If Chelsea are to improve on their Champions League efforts, they will need Buchanan\u2019s prowess to do so.\nEuro 2022 delight/heartache\nMillie Bright\u2019s Euros campaign warrants a mention. She was part of a terrific England rearguard that kept clean sheets until Spain\u2019s Esther Gonz\u00e1lez scored in the 54th minute of the quarter-final. Blocks, tackles and headers weren\u2019t her only forte. When asked to go forward and play up top late in games, Bright was able to bring about mayhem to allow others to score vital goals.\nBring on the crowds\nHayes detailed recently what the WSL could do to stimulate positive change: commercialisation, grassroots funding, and government intervention. Chelsea will be looking to encourage those measures into inception by rallying more people to turn up to games. \u201cWe begin our title defence at Stamford Bridge,\u201d Hayes wrote. \u201cThese stars you saw at the Euros, you can see them every week at a very affordable price, in a game that\u2019s free of violence.\u201d\n\u2022 This article was amended on 8 September 2022. Chelsea were beaten 4-0 by Barcelona in the 2020-21 Champions League final, not 5-0 as an earlier version indicated."

                    "body": "And you shall know us by the trail of sponsors. The League Cup has always been a bird-on-a-wire kind of thing. Every year this fond old springtime ritual is menaced and marginalised and threatened with ever more imminent extinction, but still people keep turning up in February and March asking where the party is.  The title branding tells a story of that picaresque progress. In the space of 40 years, English football\u2019s second-string domestic cup has gone from the quiet gravitas of being named after the entire Football League, through Coca-Cola, beer, electrical goods and the generic liquid \u201cmilk\u201d into a holding pattern of insurance and financial products and now on to its current iteration as the global face of Thailand\u2019s second-most popular energy drink. And still it marches on, enduringly popular with the people who actually go to watch and a genuinely mouthwatering prospect as Chelsea and Liverpool prepare to meet at Wembley on Sunday afternoon. This time around the headline branding looks spot-on. A perfect fit for a fizzy, colourful, fun kind of day, a little left-field but with its own peppy sense of fun; not to mention, on this occasion, a little caffeinated ignition. Not least for J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s Liverpool, a great club team still in the process of writing their own story as a great club team, who really could do with winning this one. Liverpool won this competition four years in a row from 1981 to 1984 and, filtered though those grainy, glorious tight-shorted years of triumph, it feels like the touchtone for any great Liverpool winning era.  Is this one yet? It is a deliberately provocative question. But there is a kind of disjunction here. Klopp has created a thrillingly well-grooved elite team. But the hard fact remains. Liverpool have won two trophies \u2013 the two biggest ones \u2013 in the past decade. Should Chelsea win Thomas Tuchel will have lifted as many trophies in his single year in west London as Klopp has in six at Liverpool. This is, of course, an unfair comparison. A Carabao Cup is some way short of a first Premier League title in two decades. Tuchel started with the levels set vertiginously high, with no bar on squad depth and financial resources, whereas Klopp has built an era at Liverpool from a low base, building an entire way of playing, an energy, a sense of connection. But the fact remains Sunday will be his first domestic cup final since defeat by Manchester City in this competition in his first season. This is what Klopp is missing, for all his headline successes; a sense of rolling background glory, the knockout cups, the days out, the annual pageantry of the great winning teams. Klopp stands alongside Pep Guardiola as the greatest Premier League coach of his era when it comes to vibes, uplift, team-building, the energising of an entire club. The next three months will offer the chance to balance the ledger.  As things stand Liverpool have a chance to win four trophies this season. That sounds fanciful. It almost certainly won\u2019t happen. And yet \u2026 there are a maximum of 23 games remaining in Liverpool\u2019s season: Twenty-three games to win them all. Or at least to get as close as possible. That still sounds like a lot of games. But look back and the past 23 have brought one defeat and 18 wins including the current run of nine in a row. Repeat that run from this point, just keep on keeping on, and they can win all four trophies. It is, of course, not that easy. Sustaining that level over 23 games is normal elite team behaviour. Stretching it to 46 across a run of high stakes do-or-die affairs would be truly rare. Plus, the opposition also have a say. The past 23 games have brought Burnley, Cardiff, Brentford, Norwich, Shrewsbury and Everton. The next 23? Well, here comes everyone. In the way from here are Chelsea, West Ham, Arsenal, Manchester United, Manchester City, Tottenham and, on the final day of the league season, Wolves, plus some combination of Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Bayern Munich and Juventus in the Champions League. This is a genuine, high-stakes, brilliantly fun-looking path towards some kind of glory, a moment not to blink or look down. It starts with a Carabao Cup final that could fulfil two complementary needs: a shot of nitroglycerine for the season\u2019s run-in; plus a little glory-padding, some ballast to back up an already distinct and identifiable era. Klopp does have a thing with domestic cups. Mainly, he\u2019s won one of them, the DFB-Pokal 10 years ago with Borussia Dortmund. Tuchel has three. Guardiola has nine. Brendan Rodgers has six. There is no obvious logic to this, other than the fact Klopp has tended to manage teams with more trimmed-back squads. Dortmund had to compete with the superior playing riches of Bayern. Liverpool have been about intense focus, pared-back strengths, a settled first XI. And it is here that promises a fascinating contrast of styles. There is a tendency to lump Tuchel and Klopp together: angular, articulate Germans who trod the same early club football path, a bit of Ralf Rangnick stuff, a sense of pressing, choreographed intensity, tracksuit-clad rage, a hat, ankle-fit tracksuit trousers.  In reality, Klopp and Tuchel never met at Mainz or Dortmund. These were genuine successions, one out, one in. They\u2019ve had dinner now and then, met at functions, but are \u201cnot super-close\u201d, in Tuchel\u2019s words. And they are quite different in their net tactical effect. Tuchel wants control. Klopp wants to create energy, to overload and overwhelm. Tuchel fixates on certain areas, obsessing over the timing and execution of turnovers in a clearly defined band of space in the opponent\u2019s half. Klopp wants to run you into the ground. Tuchel is a tactical omnivore, varying his method to his resources. Klopp has a system. If you can\u2019t live with it he\u2019ll find someone who can.   The key battles will play out on these lines. Liverpool\u2019s strengths are obvious. Chelsea\u2019s task is to shut down Mohamed Salah\u2019s influence, to mitigate a potential mismatch with Marcos Alonso on the left flank. Tuchel must also contemplate once again the fall of Rom. Kai Havertz offers more and is a better footballer, better suited to Tuchel\u2019s system. But Romelu Lukaku is a \u00a390m centre-forward with a goal record light years beyond anyone else in his squad and this final is likely to be decided on very small margins. Whatever the result the beleaguered old League Cup \u2013 still a fan\u2019s favourite for what that\u2019s worth (very little) \u2013 will struggle on into another year. This is a delicious-looking final. For Klopp, and Liverpool, its effects could be profound."

                    "body": "Rachael Laws is always diligent about doing her revision. Liverpool\u2019s goalkeeper routinely studies video clips of future opponents, reminding herself of a striker\u2019s little idiosyncrasies, a penalty-taker\u2019s quirks and whether a goalscoring midfielder favours their left foot or their right.\nYet when it comes to preparing for Sunday\u2019s FA Cup tie at home to Arsenal, Laws knows homework can take Liverpool only so far. \u201cThey ooze class from back to front,\u201d she says. \u201cThe players on their bench would be automatic starters in most WSL teams. We\u2019ve been watching clips of them this week but it isn\u2019t just about stopping Vivianne Miedema, there\u2019s Kim Little, Nikita Parris, Beth Mead, Jordan Nobbs \u2026\u201d\nEven so, the Women\u2019s Super League leaders would be unwise to underestimate a Liverpool side 10 points clear at the top of the Championship and coached by the manager who led them to successive WSL titles in 2013 and 2014. Things rather fell apart when, in 2015, Matt Beard crossed the Atlantic to take charge of Boston Breakers but he is now overseeing a fine rebuild on Merseyside, which has reunited him with Laws. In 2013, the goalkeeper helped Liverpool win the league during a stint on loan from Sunderland and Laws, who has kept 10 clean sheets this season, is keen to reacquaint herself with the elite.\n\u201cIn the classroom and in meetings we\u2019re doing everything we can to prepare and hopefully my revision can help, but it\u2019s also about imposing our game on Arsenal,\u201d she says. \u201cIf we do that, you never know what might happen.\u201d\nEvents at Prenton Park on Sunday afternoon should also serve as a litmus test of Liverpool\u2019s potential. Few doubt Laws, the recipient of an England call-up in 2014, is capable of thriving in the top flight, but some of her younger teammates will be introducing themselves to a wider public.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very good opportunity to see where we are as a squad,\u201d says the Newcastle-born goalkeeper inspired to reach the top of the game by watching Rachel Brown-Finnis and, later, Carly Telford shine in goal for England. \u201cWe feel we could compete at WSL level but this is a chance to test ourselves against one of Europe\u2019s very best teams.\u201d\n\nHer enduring love for Liverpool persuaded Laws to leave WSL Reading in 2020, despite Liverpool\u2019s relegation, and a year later Beard returned. \u201cMatt\u2019s been fantastic,\u201d she says, applauding his refusal to resort to euphemism. \u201cI first worked with him when we won the league in 2013 and he\u2019s hasn\u2019t changed much; he\u2019s still very old-school.\n\u201cWith Matt what you see is what you get but I sometimes think that\u2019s what the game\u2019s missing now. We don\u2019t always like being told what we\u2019re doing wrong but you sometimes just need a bit of old-school, you just need to be told something straight.\n\n\u201cMatt\u2019s a very good coach, but he\u2019s an even better manager off the pitch. He gets the best out of you by treating you, first and foremost, as a person. And, whether he\u2019s speaking in front of the cameras or in the changing room, he\u2019s exactly the same. Working for someone that open and honest is important.\n\u201cMatt\u2019s door\u2019s always open for us to go and talk to him and that connection matters. It\u2019s good he hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d\nBeard\u2019s directness has helped Liverpool acquire renewed support from their parent men\u2019s club, whose failure to maintain proper investment in the women\u2019s squad and its infrastructure prefaced the ignominy of relegation followed by last season\u2019s modest third-place finish. \u201cThings have changed tenfold,\u201d says Laws. \u201cWe get treated very, very well by the men. They\u2019re looking after us now; they\u2019ve been fantastic this season and have got us involved in sponsorship and advertising deals on a level playing field.\u201d\nAlthough Liverpool\u2019s men face Chelsea at Wembley in the League Cup final later on Sunday afternoon, a decent crowd is expected at Prenton Park where the relaxation of Covid restrictions means players can finally interact with supporters.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been frustrating not to be able to greet our fans this season, we\u2019ve only been able to wave at them from a distance,\u201d says Laws. \u201cSo being able to have a conversation in close proximity with someone and show our appreciation will be so nice. It makes all the difference. We\u2019ve missed the high fives, the hugs and the chats we used to share with our supporters.\u201d"

It was a curious kind of consolation after yet another defeat knocked Barcelona out of the Spanish Super Cup, but this time there was something for them to cling to. That, at least, was the hope and since then it has hardened into something more tangible. The 282nd meeting between these clubs may offer an indication of how much closer they have come or how far they still have to travel. Fifteen points behind, it is too late for Barcelona to win the league, the title in Madrid\u2019s hands with weeks to spare, but maybe the cl\u00e1sico can become a proper contest again. Not so much on Sunday night, although that too, but beyond.  In that last meeting in January, Barcelona were beaten 3-2 in Saudi Arabia. The outcome was depressingly familiar for them, but at least it hadn\u2019t been a drubbing: it had taken a 99th-minute goal from Fede Valverde to defeat them and at the point they had started to take control. \u201cPlaying like this we\u2019ll compete for titles,\u201d Piqu\u00e9 said, while the Catalan daily El Mundo Deportivo led its front page on \u201cThey fall with honour\u201d. Inside it declared \u201cBarcelona are not completely back, but almost.\u201d Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez, appointed two months earlier, said: \u201cWe were the better team in play and dominating the game. If you toss a coin and it comes out heads, no one complains, but it came out tails. This could have been a turning point in terms of the result, but it [still] is in terms of play.\u201d Some laughed at them. A lot laughed, in fact. Barcelona had been overrun in the first half and the bottom line was inescapable: they had still lost. That made it five cl\u00e1sicos in a row. They stood accused of celebrating defeat, the way they clung to an empty moral victory a humiliation in itself: how the mighty have fallen. But that was pretty much the point. Many expected a destruction but Barcelona had competed, offering some hope, some football. And soon talk of a turning point didn\u2019t look so misplaced. In the next game, Barcelona were knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Athletic Bilbao. But the winter window closed with Dani Alves, Ferran Torres, Adama Traor\u00e9 and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang joining. Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 had not departed, Xavi soon making a virtue of that failure. The coach\u2019s vision was becoming ever more apparent, an identity emerging, an entire shift in culture discernible. Something was building, the only criticism of Xavi\u2019s appointment now that it hadn\u2019t come sooner. When he reached his 100th day in charge, Xavi said it felt \u201clike 100 years\u201d and last week he said there is too much going on in his head to be able to enjoy this. But he admits it\u2019s getting better, a little better all the time. The last cl\u00e1sico showed it could, and since defeat at Athletic, Barcelona have gone 11 without losing.  The team for whom European away games have been an almost endless trauma have won in Napoli and Istanbul, reaching the Europa League quarter-finals. They put four past Atl\u00e9tico Madrid; they have scored four goals five times in 10 games and climbed back into a Champions League place for the first time this season. Sunday\u2019s points matter: victory would mean taking second from Sevilla remains in their own hands; lose and Atl\u00e9tico and Betis could overtake while Real Sociedad could move to within a point. Reality remains. On Friday, these clubs watched different European draws: Madrid awaited opponents in the Champions League, Barcelona in the Europa League. On Monday, they were confronted by different financial realities too when La Liga published salary limits: Madrid\u2019s is \u20ac739m, Barcelona\u2019s minus \u20ac144m. Much as Joan Laporta, Barcelona\u2019s bullish president, said they would try to win the league, they accept they cannot.  Not this year, at least. There is an assuredness about Madrid that makes them formidable opponents, and time has run out, the gap too great. But next year and the years beyond that no longer look so bleak for Barcelona; they certainly will not if they can end that run against Madrid, the ultimate measure of where they are, a sign they can build for better days. This league has gone, but others needn\u2019t do the same. Besides, the cl\u00e1sico always has a meaning beyond the maths. Carlo Ancelotti was asked how his team could possibly lose the league now that they had moved 10 points clear with 10 games to go. \u201cHow can you lose a European Cup final when you\u2019re 3-0 up?\u201d the manager of Milan in 2005 replied. He knows, and so does Xavi. Yet the Barcelona manager\u2019s response to a similar question contained an idea that can at least be entertained now, the hope of a cl\u00e1sico that is competitive again. \u201cWe can\u2019t be very optimistic about the league: Real Madrid would have to lose three or four and they haven\u2019t all season,\u201d he said. \u201cQuite honestly, It\u2019s very difficult \u2013 even if we win at the Bernab\u00e9u.\u201d"

                    "body": "Pep Guardiola has revealed that 71 treatments were administered to his weary players in the 65 and a half hours between Manchester City\u2019s draw at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and the FA Cup semi-final defeat by Liverpool last Saturday. The high number of treatments was because of the toll of \u201cthree finals\u201d, Guardiola said \u2013 the home and away legs against Atl\u00e9tico and the Premier League game at home against Liverpool in between.  \u201cOur physios made 71 treatments in the space between Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and the semi-final against Liverpool,\u201d City\u2019s manager said. \u201cThe full figure is 71, it\u2019s true. I saw the people there. The doctor came to me. But it\u2019s not for just one game, it\u2019s after these three \u2018finals\u2019. \u201cThey [the medics] told me as it was more than usual. The schedule is what it is. At Millwall [City\u2019s training base for the Cup semi-final] we had six massage tables by the side of the pitch for players \u2013 they watched those who didn\u2019t play in Madrid train.\u201d Guardiola was without Kyle Walker, Kevin De Bruyne and R\u00faben Dias at Wembley. Walker\u2019s ankle problem rules him out of Brighton\u2019s visit for the league match on Wednesday but De Bruyne and Dias await fitness tests. Dias has not played for seven weeks because of a hamstring injury but Guardiola is not concerned about putting the Portuguese defender back in. \u201cHe could [play 90 minutes],\u201d he said. \u201cIt depends on the game. Tomorrow\u2019s game is so demanding. I haven\u2019t decided on the lineup. I think maybe the last minutes for him but he could start, he could play. I have no doubts about R\u00faben. With R\u00faben, it is not a problem.  \u201cOver seven weeks, he went to sleep at 10pm, up at 7am \u2013 lunch at the same time every day and he stays in the gym and the pool for I don\u2019t know how long. He does it when he is fit and when he is not fit. When he says \u2018I\u2019m OK\u2019, then he is OK.\u201d Despite having had to cope without Dias, De Bruyne and Walker because of injury Guardiola prefers to have a small squad. \u201cI like to work with not a big depth of squad. I\u2019ve lived this situation many years in my life, fortunately, as I have been in top clubs \u2013 Barcelona, Bayern Munich and now City \u2013 and we arrive in the latter stages, fighting for all competitions many times. \u201cI learned from that: that if you want to fight to win, you have to be fit. You need 16, 17 or 18 who you have to have all the while fit, otherwise it\u2019s difficult to handle all of the competitions and be ready for all of them in the best condition. This is not an argument, it\u2019s a fact, because I lived it.\u201d  Next season Guardiola hopes to have Erling Haaland in his squad. City are the frontrunners in the race to buy the Borussia Dortmund striker and talks will continue in the coming days. Personal terms and other details have been discussed and City are ready to pay the 21-year-old\u2019s release clause if agreement is reached on all aspects of a deal. Guardiola, pressed on the latest, said: \u201cNo answer to your question. No questions \u2013 I have no concern about what will happen in this club next season.\u201d"

                    "body": "With awkward embraces and fixed grins, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan and Mohammed bin Salman struck a pose of reconciliation. For the past three years, the presence of the Turkish leader and the Saudi crown prince in the same room would have been unthinkable, but in a drawing room of a Jeddah palace on Friday, both tried to signal a new beginning. There was no sign of the acrimony that had set the regional rivals apart and \u2013 most definitely \u2013 no mention of the reason for the rift: the Saudi murder of Jamal Khashoggi. Instead, Erdo\u011fan, who had been prepared to take bilateral relations between regional heavyweights beyond the brink, seemed content to be standing in his rival\u2019s palace. The Saudi crown prince, meanwhile, had the look of a man who had won a prize. The path to this point had been fraught. Ties between Saudi Arabia and Turkey had been mostly severed since October 2018, when a team of assassins, most of them security aides to Prince Mohammed, flew to Istanbul to ambush and dismember the Saudi dissident inside the kingdom\u2019s consulate in Istanbul. But the murder was taped by Turkish spies and the ensuing investigation led to the heart of Prince Mohammed\u2019s court, resulting in Erdo\u011fan boycotting the defacto leader and rebuffing billions of dollars in compensation offered by Saudi envoys. It also amplified a faultline at the time between an alliance of Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Egypt, on one hand, and an opposing bloc of Qatar, Turkey and the remnants of Egypt\u2019s Muslim Brotherhood on the other. For more than three years, the two sides dug in, and Erdo\u011fan rarely missed a moment to embarrass the Saudi heir, or to assert Ankara as a regional counterweight to Riyadh. But, battered by a troubled economy at home, facing an election, and seemingly tiring of isolation, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s hardline stance has gradually given way to realpolitik. He has reached out to the UAE and Israel and has even made overtures to Egypt, where ties have remained poisonous since the coup that ousted the regime of Mohamed Morsi and ushered in the strongman Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Saudi Arabia, however, was the trickiest bridge to cross. For Erdo\u011fan to win a reset, he needed to eat humble pie. Last year a view started to take shape in Turkey that it had reaped little advantage from its standoff with Riyadh. With Donald Trump still in the White House, there may have been more of an angle for leverage. But the 2020 US election changed that; Joe Biden has distanced himself from both leaders, and neither are particularly fond of him. If there was to be detente, however, one problem needed to be fixed; the ongoing in trial in absentia in Istanbul of Khashoggi\u2019s accused killers. Earlier this month, Prince Mohammed got his wish when a Turkish prosecutor decided to stop the trial. The stage was set.  So, with eyes on trade ties, and using a pilgrimage to Mecca as cover, Erdo\u011fan stood in front of Prince Mohammed on Friday, his ambitions to consolidate a rival power base to Riyadh subsumed by domestic politics and a desperate need for economic growth that trade ties with Saudi Arabia would help Erdo\u011fan also paid homage to the Saudi monarch, King Salman, with whom he had tried to deal directly in the weeks after Khashoggi\u2019s death in an effort to sideline Prince Mohammed. At home, his visit was observed in sombre tones, with any mention of Khashoggi kept to a minimum. \u201cMy visit is the manifestation of our common will to start a new era of cooperation as two brotherly countries,\u201d Erdo\u011fan said before leaving Istanbul. He was met in Jeddah as if nothing had ever split the two countries. Privately, however, Saudi officials were jubilant. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s trip had capped Turkey\u2019s ambitions to play more of a regional role, one official told the Guardian. \u201cHe needs us more than we need him, and he\u2019s the one traveling to us. This stance of his has cost him billions in lost revenues. Any trade will be on our terms.\u201d"

I can still picture myself seeing Sassafras beat Nijinsky in 1970 after persuading my mother to let me stay at my aunt\u2019s house and see the race when it used to be at the end of the card. I had picked the French horse out but now can feel for connections of the second Nijinsky, who was denied victory in Europe\u2019s premier horserace after landing the (still) elusive Triple Crown of English Guineas, Derby and Leger. There have been great results and races in Paris since but on an emotional level there have been few Arc de Triomphes to match today\u2019s result for the master trainer Sir Mark Prescott and his marvellous mare Alpinista. Prescott is steeped in the game and this victory crowns a fabulous career. Don McRae\u2019s interview with the baronet published in the Guardian earlier this week will have brought this fascinating individual to a wider public than purely racing followers and for that I\u2019m very pleased.  It\u2019s incredible to think that if Alpinista had not raced today we would now have been talking about Vadeni\u2019s victory and whether Christophe Soumillon should have even been riding at all after Friday\u2019s shameful behaviour at Saint-Cloud.

La Parisienne also looked a little unlucky in the Prix Vermeille on Arc Trials day here three weeks ago, when she finished best of all after struggling for running room inside the final quarter-mile, and makes a fair bit of appeal at around 7-2 to reverse the Prix de Diane (French Oaks) form with Nashwa.

Trained by Christopher Head and ridden by Aurelien Lemaitre, the Group One event for juvenile fillies was run at a decent clip for the testing conditions at the Paris track, and having travelled powerfully in third early on in the two-turn event, she shot clear at the cutaway. Jim Bolger\u2019s Gan Teorainn ran a huge race to stay on nicely to grab second, despite having no chance with the winner. Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s Never Ending Story, who had suffered trouble in running when fourth in the Moyglare, again did not have the best of luck, with Ryan Moore having to extract the filly from a pocket before making her challenge. She quickened nicely when seeing daylight, but having looked set for second, was eventually pipped and settled for third. PA Media   Updated at 2.22pm BST    2.14pm   Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe (3.05pm) preview  The showpiece event of the European campaign on the Flat and a race that, unlike several recent renewals, does revolve around a short-priced favourite. This is as open an Arc as any I can recall over the last dozen or so years, according to both the betting and the official ratings, and the extended lull between the Marcel Boussac and the Arc itself is the ideal time to weigh up the form. The Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown in September is possibly the best place to start, as Luxembourg, the narrow favourite for the Arc, notched his first Group One win as a three-year-old and edged out another of today\u2019s big contenders, Onesto, in the process, with Vadeni back in third. Precisely how the market can look at this form and make Luxembourg a 9-2 shot today while Onesto is out at 11-1 is beyond me, as Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s runner is unproven at the trip while Fabrice Chappet\u2019s colt has a Group One win over the Arc course and distance in July\u2019s Grand Prix de Paris to his name. He stayed on really well there to run down Simca Mille and the runner-up landed the Group Two Prix Niel next time out. Other leading contenders include Japan\u2019s big hope Titleholder, a Grade One winner at Hanshin on his most recent start in June; Vadeni, with\u201cElbowgate\u201d jockey Christophe Soumillon in the saddle, bidding to add the Arc to the French Derby and Eclipse, in which Mishriff was a luckless second; and the hugely popular Alpinista, bidding to take her winning streak to eight races after a comfortable win in the Yorkshire Oaks in August. The French Derby also includes Al Hakeem, a subsequent Group Two winner at Deauville, back in fourth, while Do Deuce, this year\u2019s Japanese Derby winner, is my idea of an interesting each-way chance at around 25-1. My guess would be that he was not even 50pc fit for his run in the Prix Niel, and that Yutaka Take\u2019s mount will find plenty of improvement for the experience. Selection: Onesto. Each-way: Do Deuce.      1.57pm   Prix Marcel Boussac (1.50pm) result  1 Blue Rose Cen 9-22 Gran Teorainn 40-13 Never Ending Story 6-1   Updated at 2.02pm BST    1.53pm   Prix Marcel Boussac (1.50pm)  And they\u2019re off \u2026 Ardent makes a fast start but it\u2019s Shalromy who is just ahead in the early stages \u2026 Blue Rose Cen is in third \u2026 Habana is short of room on the rails and Wed is struggling at the back \u2026 Blue Rose Cen kicks clear and has won this easily.  Updated at 1.55pm BST    1.48pm    Belbek stayed on stoutly under a well-timed ride from Mickael Barzalona to narrowly take the Qatar Prix Jean-Luc Lagardere at Longchamp. The Andre Fabre-trained colt was always near the front rank in the seven-furlong Group One contest and sat just off the pace, set by Vicious Harry. Barzalona, winning the race for a fourth time, made his move aboard Belbek inside the final furlong and out-stayed Gamestop, who had hit the front 200 yards from the winning post. Breizh Sky finished off well in third, with the Johnny Murtagh-trained Shartash failing to pick up sufficiently in the ground, finishing fourth. \u201cHe failed to settle in his first race but he is a good-looking, well-bred horse.\u201d said Fabre.\u201cLet\u2019s see how he is, but I might take him to the Vertem Futurity Trophy at Doncaster. If he ran again it could be there. The Breeders\u2019 Cup [for which he qualified by winning] would not be my favoured option.\u201d Paddy Power have introduced Belbek as a 12-1 chance for the Doncaster Group One on October 22.

That reflects the fact that all but two are stepping up from minor Pattern company to make their debut at Group One level, the exceptions being Never Ending Story and Gan Teorainn, fourth and seventh respectively in the Moyglare Stud Stakes at the Curragh on 11 September.  Neither could hold a candle to Tahiyra there, but Never Ending Story was value for a bit more than the bare form, having taken a bump around a furlong out. Wed, trained by Maurizio Guarnieri, is the form horse among the locally-trained runners, having shown significant improvement to land the Group Two Prix du Calvados at Deauville in August, with Never Ending Story back in third, while the unbeaten Kelina, who has yet to contest a Group race, is also attracting support along with German-trained Habana, a Group Three winner at Baden Baden last time out. Britain\u2019s challenge is led by John Quinn\u2019s Breege, a length behind Fairy Cross in the Prestige Stakes at Glorious Goodwood.

Updated at 1.24pm BST    1.03pm    It\u2019s started precipitating down at Longchamp!      12.56pm    Sir Mark Prescott, who trains Alpinista, has just arrived at the track.His runners is now joint-favourite for the Arc, and he told Sky Sports Racing: \u201cIt\u2019s been 21 years since I\u2019ve been here. I\u2019m just going to go and have a look around and walk the track. Whatever happens I\u2019m going to enjoy the day. I think every race she has run for the last two years she has improved a little bit. Quicker ground would have suited me better but she\u2019ll run and she\u2019ll do here best.\u201d   Updated at 1.07pm BST    12.46pm    Vadeni has just arrived. He has no idea the stink he\u2019ll cause if he wins the Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe!

That is bitterly disappointing news for O\u2019Brien and Ryan Moore \u2013 he was the stable\u2019s only declared runner \u2013 and also robs form students of an early test of the Middle Park form, as The Antarctic was two lengths behind Blackbeard in the Newmarket Group One last weekend.  In his absence, Shartash, in the Aga Khan\u2019s colours, is likely to head the market to give Johnny Murtagh a victory as a trainer in a race he did not manage to win as a jockey, and a repeat of his one-and-three-quarter length third to Al Riffa in the National Stakes in September would put him right in the mix. The key form line among the home team, meanwhile, could prove to be a well-run renewal of the Group Three Prix de la Rochette over today\u2019s course and distance in early September, in which Tigrais got up in the dying stride to short-head Breizh Sky. Gamestop, who was third home there but around two-and-a-half lengths behind the winner, is also in today\u2019s field, while Pivotal Trigger, third behind Kubrick in a Group Three last time, lines up for Jessica Harrington.  Selection: Tigrais.      12.32pm    They\u2019re off in the Fashion Stakes in Paris. What\u2019s the horse there on top of this racegoer\u2019s hat?   Updated at 12.34pm BST    12.27pm    The French racing authorities will be dreading Vadeni winning the Arc at 3,05pm this afternoon with bad-boy Christophe Soumillon on board. There will be plenty of punters who have supported him who won\u2019t mind and his mount has been one of the best backed for the contest. The release from BritishGambler.co.uk that landed in my email box just now reminded me of this, stating: \u201cDespite calls for Soumillon to voluntarily withdraw from this weekend\u2019s racing, Vadeni goes into Arc day as one of the most backed horses with his odds tumbling in the last few days; so much that he is now a best-priced 8-1 (down from 12/1).\u201d Two of the four pundits on Sky Sports Racing have just plumped fopr the colt too.   Updated at 12.27pm BST    12.15pm    Aidan O\u2019Brien has taken out Middle Park runner-up The Antarctic from the Prix Jean-Luc Lagardere (1.15pm) \u2026 and he was the favourite.      12.14pm    It\u2019s sticky out there \u2026      11.59am   Preamble  Good afternoon from Longchamp in the Bois de Boulogne, where 20 horses, 19 jockeys and one enormous distraction will go to post for the Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe this afternoon. Christophe Soumillon, the rider with the weighing room\u2019s sharpest elbow, is no stranger to self-generated controversies. He is also likely to be one of the very few individuals at the track today who does not give Friday\u2019s incident at Saint-Cloud, when he could have caused Rossa Ryan to suffer a serious injury or even worse, a second thought in the run-up to the most prestigious race of the European season. Many in the stands, though, will struggle to understand why a rider who acted as Soumillon did just 48 hours ago is being allowed to carry on working this weekend. The answer, apparently, is that despite having a history of organised horse racing that dates back to the Napoleonic age, the French authorities have never managed \u2013 or felt the need - to introduce a rule that allows them to stand down a jockey with immediate effect.  That may well change as a result of Soumillon\u2019s moment of madness on Friday, but they are saddled with him as the focus of attention today, when his mount, Vadeni, will start at around 8-1 to add the Arc to his victories in the French Derby and Eclipse Stakes earlier this year. Soumillon\u2019s previous Arc successes have been greeted rapturously by the Longchamp crowds but the reception for a win by Vadeni could be interesting. As the odds suggest, of course, it probably won\u2019t happen, as Vadeni is just one among at least a dozen very plausible winners, including Luxembourg, Alpinista, last year\u2019s shock winner Torquator Tasso, Westover, Onesto, Titleholder and Al Hakeem. Luxembourg, who was half a length in front of Onesto in the Irish Champion Stakes last time, remains a narrow favourite but is on the drift this morning, out to 9-2 from 7-2, while the hugely popular grey mare Alpinista, from Sir Mark Prescott\u2019s stable in Newmarket, is hunting him up in the market at 11-2. The weather in Paris this weekend has been much more pleasant than many forecasts predicted but the going is still described as very soft and horses were finishing tired in the staying races here on Saturday. The first of six Group One races on today\u2019s card is the Prix Jean-Luc Lagardere, for juvenile colts, which is due off at 1.15pm British time, while the Arc itself is quite early on the card, at 3.05pm.

                    "body": "The Saudi prince was detained all night. As daylight broke, he staggered out of the king\u2019s palace in Mecca. His personal bodyguards, who tailed him everywhere, were missing. The prince was led to a waiting car. He was free to leave \u2013 but he would soon discover that freedom was not very different from detention.  As his car pulled out of the palace gates, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef fired off a series of panicked text messages. \u201cBe very careful! Don\u2019t come back!\u201d he wrote to his most trusted adviser, who had quietly slipped out of the kingdom just weeks earlier. When Nayef reached his own palace in the coastal city of Jeddah a few hours later, he found new guards manning the property. It was obvious that he was being put under house arrest. \u201cMay God help us, doctor. The important thing is that you must be careful, and under no circumstances should you come back,\u201d he wrote to the adviser. The previous night, 20 June 2017, Nayef, the king\u2019s nephew, had been forced to step down as heir to the Saudi throne in an episode that one royal insider described to me as \u201cGodfather, Saudi-style\u201d. Nayef, who oversaw domestic security, was the CIA\u2019s closest Saudi ally. Earlier that year, the then-CIA director Mike Pompeo had awarded him a medal in recognition of his counter-terrorism efforts that saved American lives. Two years before, after King Salman commenced his reign, Nayef had been made crown prince at the age of 55, putting him next in line to the throne. But simmering behind the scenes was a vicious rivalry between Nayef and his upstart cousin, the king\u2019s son, Mohammed bin Salman, or MBS as he is known, who rose from obscurity to become deputy crown prince. Shortly before the palace coup, on 5 June 2017, tensions between the princes reached boiling point after MBS and other regional autocrats imposed a punishing blockade on neighbouring Qatar. The tiny, gas-rich emirate has long rankled its bigger Arab neighbours with its provocative moves, such as giving airtime to regional Islamists and dissidents on its influential news channel Al Jazeera. Nayef, too, had issues with Qatar, but he preferred quiet diplomacy over MBS\u2019s combative approach. Behind his cousin\u2019s back, Nayef opened a secret channel with Qatar\u2019s ruler Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani. \u201cTamim called me today, but I did not answer,\u201d Nayef texted his adviser at the peak of the crisis. \u201cI want to send him an encrypted phone for communication.\u201d On 20 June 2017, in the midst of that crisis, Nayef was called for a meeting in King Salman\u2019s palace in Mecca \u2013 a marble-walled colossus overlooking the cube-shaped Ka\u2019bah, the holiest shrine in Islam. According to sources close to Nayef, when he arrived, his security detail was instructed to wait outside. To prevent any leaks, all mobile phones, including those of the palace staff, were seized by guards loyal to MBS. One senior member of the royal family, who tried to enter the palace after Nayef, was turned away at the gates. The prince was allegedly ushered into a room with Turki al-Sheikh, a close MBS confidante with a gruff, intimidating manner and a predilection for expensive Richard Mille watches. (Sheikh would later be promoted to head the General Entertainment Authority \u2013 an agency that seeks to soften Saudi Arabia\u2019s image by, among other things, hosting giant raves in the desert.) Sheikh allegedly confined Nayef to the room for hours, pressuring him to sign a resignation letter and pledge allegiance to MBS. At first, Nayef refused. According to one source close to the prince, he was told that if he did not give up his claim to the throne, his female family members would be raped. Nayef\u2019s medication for hypertension and diabetes was withheld, and he was told that if he did not step down willingly, his next destination would be the hospital. He was so afraid of being poisoned that night, said another royal family source, that he refused to drink even water. Nayef was permitted to speak with two princes in the Allegiance Council, the royal body that ratifies the line of succession. He was shocked to hear that they had already submitted to MBS. By daybreak, it was all over. Anxious and exhausted, Nayef surrendered. He was made to step into an adjoining room, where MBS was waiting with television cameras and a guard carrying a gun. Footage released by Saudi broadcasters showed a brief glimpse of Sheikh hurriedly slipping a gold-trimmed robe on the back of the detained prince. As the cameras rolled, MBS crept closer to his cousin and theatrically stooped down to kiss his hand and knee. \u201cWhen I pledged allegiance, there was a gun to my back,\u201d Nayef later wrote in a text to his adviser.  In the days that followed, posters of Nayef were removed from public buildings. MBS was now first in line to the throne, and effectively the most powerful man in the country at the age of 31. The octogenarian king remained head of state, but MBS became the day-to-day ruler, with absolute control over all levers of Saudi security, economy and oil. Nayef, the darling of US intelligence, who had assumed he would be the next ruler of Saudi Arabia, was now a prisoner. But for him, worse was to come. * * * The palace coup, and the power plays that led to it, were largely obscured from public view at the time, with only scraps of information \u2013 and dollops of propaganda \u2013 leaking out to the press. International media, for example, was fed what Nayef\u2019s associates call spurious claims that he had been pushed aside in the national interest because he was incapacitated by morphine and cocaine addiction. Getting at the truth is especially hard in a country where the surveillance state is so powerful that some Saudis place their phones in the refrigerator while discussing sensitive matters. The Saudi embassies in London and Washington did not respond to requests for comment for this article. But a detailed account of the events of 2017, and its shocking aftermath, is now possible, thanks to a drip-feed of palace secrets by a few senior royals and other well-connected sources who have been stripped of their influence and wealth in the age of MBS and, in the worst cases, imprisoned and tortured. Key among those sources is a man named Saad Aljabri, Nayef\u2019s closest adviser and intelligence chief. It was Aljabri whom Nayef texted immediately after he was released from the king\u2019s palace, after the coup. Aljabri, 63, had long operated in the shadows and many who worked with him considered him the most powerful non-royal in Saudi Arabia. One former American official who worked with Aljabri for years described him to me as the \u201cdeep state liaison\u201d between Saudi Arabia and western powers. In the years after 9/11, Aljabri had been promoted through the ranks of the interior ministry, eventually becoming head of counter-terrorism operations. Together, Aljabri and his patron, Nayef, modernised the kingdom\u2019s security and surveillance apparatus. They have also been accused of targeting peaceful activists under the pretext of counter-terrorism and laying the foundations of the police state that MBS would later turn against them. The text messages between Nayef and Aljabri first came to light through legal filings in North America and an Interpol ruling that rejected a Saudi request to have Aljabri arrested overseas. The messages in those documents were authenticated by a digital forensics expert hired by Norton Rose Fulbright, the international law firm representing Aljabri, which is in possession of his iPhone, according to court affidavits. Aljabri\u2019s team separately shared with me a handful of messages that have never previously been published. For decades, the throne had passed laterally between the sons of Abdulaziz Al Saud, the founder of the modern Saudi state, ensuring a delicate power balance between the various branches of the vast royal family. Nayef\u2019s succession would have seen the crown passing to the generation below for the first time, but still to a different branch of the family, maintaining that delicate balance. But then came the palace coup \u2013 which not only shoved aside MBS\u2019s main rival, but also destroyed the old succession model that prized seniority and consensus within the family, by setting up the passing of power directly from father to son within one branch of the family. It enabled MBS to amass more power than any previous ruler, even before he formally ascends the throne. The coup was the culmination of months of animus between MBS and Nayef. One of the major points of conflict was their competition to win favour with the new administration of President Donald Trump. People close to Nayef say he was secretly listening in on MBS\u2019s calls with aides and allies such as Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law and White House adviser. The snooping helped him track MBS\u2019s manoeuvres in Washington. The transcript of one intercepted call in the spring of 2017, which Nayef showed to Aljabri, suggested that MBS had been discussing the royal succession with Kushner. In that call, MBS told Kushner that he had cultivated close relationships with all US agencies \u201cexcept three\u201d. When Aljabri saw the transcript, he took the three agencies to mean the CIA, FBI and National Security Agency \u2013 institutions that had long favoured Nayef. To him and his patron, it was clear that MBS was trying to consolidate American support for his succession. In May 2017, Nayef attempted to make his own inroads into the Trump White House. He hired the Sonoran Policy Group, a lobbying firm in Washington with close ties to Trump\u2019s team. Sonoran \u2013 which has since been renamed Stryk Global Diplomacy after its chairman, the lobbyist Robert Stryk \u2013 was hired to provide Nayef\u2019s interior ministry \u201cbroad advisory services\u201d in Washington. Nayef, people close to him said, understood that his past record did not count for much with a brash, unconventional president who would go on to have a strained relationship with the US intelligence community. Nayef wanted to impress on the new president that he was not just a longstanding partner, but a more valuable one than his cousin. Aljabri was directly involved in negotiating the $5.4m lobbying contract on behalf of the ministry. As news of the contract spread, Aljabri feared being caught between the warring princes. In May 2017, he quietly slipped away to Turkey, just days before Trump was due to visit Riyadh. Aljabri\u2019s fears were well founded. Soon after he left, Aljabri said he got word that the main signatory of the contract \u2013 a secret service officer under Nayef \u2013 was detained by MBS loyalists and interrogated about the lobbying effort. On 4 June 2017, Aljabri texted Abdulaziz Howairini, a veteran security official, to ask whether he should continue \u201cfasting in the cold\u201d, a coded reference to remaining in Turkey. Howairini, who now reports to MBS, replied that he should. On 17 June, Howairini sent another text to Aljabri, warning him that the MBS loyalists were \u201cvery eager\u201d to detain him as well. Meanwhile, furious pushback from MBS compelled Nayef to cancel the Stryk contract. According to Aljabri, Nayef warned him that MBS had seen the contract as a plot to torpedo his relationship with the Trump family and was out for blood.  On 18 June, Aljabri received an abrupt text from MBS, asking him to return to Saudi Arabia to help resolve unspecified \u201cconflicts\u201d with Nayef. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone who understands [Nayef] better than you,\u201d MBS wrote, his tone unusually conciliatory. There had been bad blood between MBS and Aljabri since 2015, when King Salman, apparently at the prince\u2019s urging, fired Aljabri from his position for secretly meeting the then-CIA director John Brennan and then-British foreign secretary Philip Hammond without reporting the meetings to the monarch. However, Aljabri had continued working with Nayef informally, viewing his dismissal as one of MBS\u2019s numerous attempts to weaken his patron. \u201cLet us forget about the past,\u201d MBS now insisted. \u201cAre we children today? Forgive me and exonerate me before God. When are you coming back?\u201d Aljabri replied that he needed to be away for medical treatment. Two days later, MBS launched the coup. * * * In the months after the coup, Aljabri continued to hunker down in Turkey. His immediate family was with him, except for two of his children who, on the day of the coup, had been prevented from boarding a flight in Riyadh. He secretly kept in contact with Nayef, whose movements were constrained. Meanwhile, MBS moved swiftly to tighten his grip on the security services, including the interior ministry, which was stripped of Nayef loyalists and key functions such as counter-terrorism. MBS came down heavily on any hint of public dissent. In his first major clampdown after the coup, influential clerics and intellectuals with huge social media followings were arrested in September 2017. That same month, Aljabri pleaded with MBS to allow his children to leave Saudi Arabia. But MBS insisted that Aljabri first return to discuss a \u201cvery sensitive file\u201d related to Nayef. \u201cDoctor, where should we dispatch the airplane to fetch you?\u201d asked MBS in a text message. Aljabri had no intention of returning, but also sought to convince MBS that he posed no threat. In messages filled with obsequious platitudes, Aljabri pledged loyalty to MBS. \u201cI possess lots of sensitive state information, but despite that I have never leaked anything to anyone,\u201d Aljabri wrote. Rattling off examples of his loyalty, he wrote that he had publicly refuted the claims of \u201cMujtahid\u201d \u2013 an anonymous royal whistleblower on Twitter who has long been a thorn in the side of the Saudi royal family. \u201cWhat destiny awaits me were I to return [to Saudi]? Isn\u2019t it better for me to remain outside the kingdom, where I remain faithful to your rule, refuse to say anything that would be harmful \u2026 and cooperate with Your Highness in everything that serves a common good?\u201d MBS was unmoved. He texted Aljabri that he would pursue him \u201cusing all available means\u201d. The threat prompted Aljabri to flee from Turkey to Canada later that month. In late 2017, Saudi Arabia tried to have Aljabri arrested through Interpol, alleging that he had stolen state funds worth billions, and pressed Canada to hand him over. Both efforts failed. Then, in October 2018, according to Aljabri, he received a warning from spies in a Middle Eastern country, who told him that he was an assassination target and urged him to stay away from Saudi embassies and consulates. (Aljabri requested the country\u2019s name be withheld for fear of Saudi retribution.) That same month, Canadian border agents are thought to have intercepted and deported members of the Tiger Squad, a team of Saudi-sponsored hitmen, as they tried to enter the country on tourist visas. Riyadh denied any involvement but the alleged plot, implicitly acknowledged by Canadian authorities, bore chilling similarities to the way the Tiger Squad murdered the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the same month inside a Saudi diplomatic mission in Turkey. To the Americans who had worked with Aljabri, it was obvious that MBS saw him as a threat. Aljabri fleeing the kingdom was \u201clike J Edgar Hoover\u2019s deputy leaving DC and showing up in Moscow\u201d, said the former US official who had worked with him. \u201cHere\u2019s a man liked by deep state organisations around the planet. He knows every foible, every misstep that Saudi royals have made.\u201d * * * On a crisp winter morning last year, I was invited to a five-star hotel in Washington DC to meet Aljabri. He had travelled from Toronto to visit his son Khalid, a cardiologist and an informal spokesman for his reclusive father. When I arrived in the hotel lobby, my phone jangled with an unexpected message: \u201cLet\u2019s meet outside of the hotel.\u201d Minutes later, a man appeared and whisked me to another high-rise in the area. Parked outside the residential tower, home to some of DC\u2019s political elite, was an SUV marked \u201cUS Secret Service\u201d. In an enclosed patio on the rooftop was Aljabri, dressed in a dark suit and wire-rimmed glasses. He was sitting on a couch, gazing at the view of downtown Washington. A wall-mounted fireplace radiated warmth and in the background, the faint warble of a grand piano could be heard. As I arrived, Aljabri stood up, Starbucks coffee in hand, and began by pointing out the landmarks: the Jefferson Memorial, the Washington Monument, the White House.  During the Trump presidency, Aljabri had avoided Washington DC, he said. He has plenty of influential friends here, including senators on both sides of the aisle and security officials. Even so, he was wary of the long arm of the Saudi state, and Trump\u2019s warm relationship with MBS had made him even more wary. As we spoke, Aljabri, who holds a doctorate in artificial intelligence from the University of Edinburgh, mused about how different his life\u2019s trajectory might have been had he not met Nayef. Aljabri began his career at the interior ministry in the 1990s. He once tried quitting for a job at Aramco, the state oil giant that is the biggest cash cow for the kingdom. Nayef stopped him. Now their destinies seem braided together. Since the coup, about 40 of Aljabri\u2019s family members and close associates have been detained in Saudi Arabia in an attempt to coerce him into returning. His voice cracked as he pulled up photos on his phone of his incarcerated children, Sarah and Omar, now 22 and 24 respectively. They were arrested in March 2020, and convicted, in a closed trial, of money laundering and attempting to escape Saudi Arabia unlawfully. Aljabri\u2019s son-in-law is also in detention. Aljabri said that if there were ever a chance for an exchange on a bridge \u2013 MBS on one end with his family, Aljabri on the other \u2013 he would do the trade in a heartbeat. \u201cTake your ransom, release the hostages,\u201d he said, imagining the scene. But he knows that is wishful thinking. In August 2020, after his children were jailed, Aljabri filed an explosive lawsuit in Washington, going public with his claim that MBS sent a death squad after him. (The judge would later remark that the lawsuit read like \u201cthe stuff of a Tom Clancy novel\u201d.) Aljabri knows he cannot win against a powerful dictator, but the action could at the very least be what one of his associates described as a \u201cpebble in MBS\u2019s shoe\u201d. In early 2021, the lawsuit triggered what Aljabri saw as retaliatory lawsuits in Boston and Ontario, filed by 10 Saudi state-linked firms initially established by Nayef to provide cover for US-Saudi operations and now controlled by the kingdom\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, of which MBS is the chairman. These companies accused Aljabri and his associates of defrauding them of $3.5bn. Aljabri denied any wrongdoing and said defending himself would require revealing the operations and finances of the companies, which were murky by design to support covert activities. Court documents filed in Boston by the US Justice Department suggest US officials were keen for an out-of-court settlement between Aljabri and MBS, apparently to prevent any public revelations about undercover American operations. But those efforts went nowhere. One US official, previously posted in the American mission in Riyadh, told me that the Saudis were not interested in settling because they are \u201cnot convinced Aljabri will remain silent\u201d. In February this year, Aljabri made a new offer to MBS. In a letter to a senior royal court adviser, Aljabri offered a \u201cfinancial and legal resolution\u201d. (Aljabri\u2019s team refused to discuss the specifics of the offer with me.) They sent the White House a memo requesting US officials to \u201curge the Saudi leadership to accept the restitution offer\u201d. It was met with silence from MBS. MBS\u2019s supporters say Aljabri\u2019s eagerness for a financial settlement is tacit admission of his guilt. Aljabri\u2019s team say that MBS\u2019s unwillingness to settle proves that corruption is just a pretext to pursue a political opponent. Meanwhile, the legal battle drags on. In September, the Washington court dismissed Aljabri\u2019s lawsuit against MBS, citing lack of personal jurisdiction. (Aljabri\u2019s team are appealing against the decision.) Late last year, the Boston court threw out the lawsuit against Aljabri after the US government invoked the \u201cstate secrets privilege\u201d to halt the disclosure of classified national security information. (The companies are fighting back.) But those secrets are still at risk of exposure in an Ontario court. Court filings from earlier this year show lawyers for the US government are working with their Canadian counterparts to prevent that outcome. But even if the lawsuits against Aljabri proceed, it could prove tricky to prove the corruption allegations conclusively. That\u2019s because a key witness, the man who oversaw counter-terrorism spending, has disappeared: Nayef. * * * In late 2017, the conditions of Nayef\u2019s house arrest were relaxed, but he was still barred from travelling outside the kingdom. Aljabri told me that Nayef had initially believed the worst that would happen to him was losing his official titles and receiving a handsome financial compensation in return. He expected to be treated the same way as his predecessor Prince Muqrin bin Abdulaziz, a former head of intelligence who was dismissed as crown prince in 2015. After King Salman fired him, according to a well-placed source, Prince Muqrin was lavished with farewell gifts, including a royal payout of about $800m, and the luxury yacht Solandge. By contrast, a large chunk of Nayef\u2019s wealth was seized. On 10 December 2017, Nayef sent a letter to HSBC in Geneva asking that his \u201cEUR, GBP, and USD balances\u201d be transferred to a Saudi bank account. A source with knowledge of Nayef\u2019s assets said his bankers and lawyers in Geneva ignored such requests, suspecting that the prince was acting under duress. (HSBC declined to comment when asked how it responded to the letter. The bank requested withholding the name of the official addressed in the letter, citing safety concerns.) The total value of Nayef\u2019s overseas holdings is unclear. The prince\u2019s associates say he owns prime real estate worth billions in Europe and the US. Nonetheless, what is certain is that Nayef had to surrender a substantial part of his domestic assets. The source with knowledge of these, who is based in Europe, provided a table with a breakdown of his \u201cconfiscated\u201d companies and bank accounts \u2013 the total amount was $5.22bn. A separate source close to the prince shared what appeared to be a slightly less up-to-date spreadsheet with a similar breakdown. The \u201ctotal value\u201d confiscated, it said, was 17.8bn riyals, or $4.75bn. In 2018 and 2019, Nayef enjoyed relative freedom, even though he wasn\u2019t allowed to leave the kingdom. His favourite activity, falconry in Algeria\u2019s deserts, was out of the question, but he was allowed to go hunting inside Saudi Arabia. He showed up at royal weddings and funerals. One video that surfaced in late 2019 showed a group of supporters taking selfies with the prince and kissing his hand.  Then, in March 2020, suddenly things got decidedly worse for Nayef. The government raided his desert retreat on the outskirts of Riyadh, and he was taken into detention. Several staff were also detained, the Europe-based source said. Nayef was kept in solitary confinement for more than six months. During that time, \u201che was seriously mistreated\u201d, the source said. He alleged that Nayef was strung up his ankles and tortured. \u201cAs a consequence, he now has long-lasting damage to his lower legs and ankles, making walking painful. He lost a significant amount of weight.\u201d Towards the end of 2020, according to the Europe-based source, Nayef was moved to a compound in the Yamamah palace complex in Riyadh, the king\u2019s official residence and main seat of the Saudi government. He is not allowed outside his small unit and he is filmed and recorded at all times, the source said. He is not allowed visitors, except certain family members on rare occasions, nor can he see his personal doctor or legal representatives. He has been made to sign documents without reading them. In the spring of 2021, Nayef\u2019s bankers and lawyers in Europe received new wealth transfer requests. They included a phone call from Nayef to his lawyer in Switzerland, according to a source privy to the discussion. The lawyer, to whom Nayef had previously granted power of attorney, refused, as he believed his client was under duress. The prince invited the lawyer to visit Saudi Arabia and verify for himself. Nayef \u201ckept saying \u2018I\u2019m free, we\u2019ll go out for dinner when you come to Riyadh\u2019\u201d, the source said. The lawyer insisted that Nayef needed to travel to Switzerland with his family to authorise the transfer in person. When reached by telephone, the lawyer told me that he could neither deny nor confirm the conversation, expressing concern about the potential repercussions of media engagement for his client. \u201cThe main reason that Nayef is being held is that the crown prince wrongly believes that he is a threat to the succession,\u201d the Europe-based source said. \u201cIn also going after his money, MBS is attempting to humiliate Nayef so there is absolutely no threat of anyone seeing the former crown prince as a viable alternative.\u201d * * * In a marble-bedecked luxury hotel in the heart of Riyadh, I met one of MBS\u2019s most prominent spin doctors. Sitting next to him in the cafe was a senior royal court official, who stayed for part of the meeting. From our previous encounters, it was clear the spin doctor was part of a state-sponsored campaign to project MBS in the west as a visionary, boldly pushing through social reforms. He had wanted to talk about how the prince had lifted decades-old bans on women drivers and cinemas, allowed once-forbidden music concerts and curbed the power of the religious police who staunchly opposed mixing of the sexes. \u201cMBS has balls,\u201d he once told me. This time, an evening in March 2020, the spin doctor, hunched over a cup of coffee and a plate of crepes slathered with Nutella, wanted to set the record straight on Nayef\u2019s recent disappearance. The Saudi government had offered no comment on why Nayef had been detained, along with another senior royal seen as a rival to MBS, Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz. This meeting was the closest I would get to an official explanation. The spin doctor sought to dismiss a narrative playing out in the foreign media that the princes had been detained because the authorities believed they were plotting to unseat MBS and his father. MBS, he said, remained \u201cin control\u201d and the detentions were carried out \u201cafter an accumulation of negative behaviour by the two princes\u201d. The sudden purge was meant to enforce \u201cdiscipline\u201d within the royal family. He did not elaborate on the nature of the \u201cnegative behaviour\u201d, but said that the princes could be released soon. Nearly three years later, the princes are still in detention. \u201cBoth the Biden and the Trump administrations called for release of Mohammed bin Nayef \u2026 at the top of their talking points when engaging privately with Saudi leadership,\u201d Kirsten Fontenrose, who briefly oversaw Gulf policy for the Trump administration, told the US House foreign affairs committee last year. \u201cMohammed bin Salman has been unmoved.\u201d  There are now no visible rivals left to the throne. MBS\u2019s power appears absolute. On his current trajectory, there is nothing to stop him from succeeding his father as king. The global outcry over Khashoggi\u2019s murder, the ruinous Saudi-led war in Yemen and growing repression at home \u2013 nothing seems to have shaken his hold on the country. Despite the reputational risks of doing business with a dictator, Wall Street executives are eager to strike deals with the rich petro-state. Activists fear a recent US decision to grant him sovereign immunity in a case concerning Khashoggi\u2019s murder could further embolden him to go after critics. A royal family source, who privately denounced Nayef\u2019s treatment but has remained silent in public to avoid retribution, told me that he would not be surprised if Nayef were to suddenly make an appearance in public someday alongside MBS, giving his blessing to the man who crushed him. Similar to the staged video after the 2017 coup, that would be another defining image of the age of MBS \u2013 and his violent rise to power.  \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, listen to our podcasts here and sign up to the long read weekly email here."

                    "body": "  It was nearly 2pm on 7 February 2017 when Centrelink frontline worker Colleen Taylor sent off an email that may yet occupy a small place in Australian political history. Among about 3,000 words of jargon and painstaking detail about Centrelink processes was a statement of moral clarity. \u201cAs a compliance unit,\u201d Taylor wrote, \u201cwe should not be the ones stealing from our customers.\u201d The subject of Taylor\u2019s email was what had just been dubbed \u201crobodebt\u201d. Now the subject of a royal commission, the disastrous program was launched by the then social services minister Scott Morrison in 2015 but only unleashed at scale towards the end of 2016. It then hit the headlines. Taylor\u2019s email, courageously sent to the most senior person in a department of more than 30,000 staff members \u2013 Kathryn Campbell \u2013 was released among a tranche of hundreds of documents by a royal commission this week. Guardian Australia spoke to Taylor in Queensland this week. She was shocked and initially unnerved to learn her emails and name had been published by the royal commission. Talking about the period brought back traumatic memories. Taylor insisted modestly she was not a \u201cwhistleblower\u201d, saying she always kept her concerns \u201cin house\u201d and had cleared the correspondence with her direct superiors.  Taylor also says she is not a victim. \u201cOur poor customers, they\u2019re the ones that suffered,\u201d she says. By early 2017, Coalition government ministers were resolutely defending the robodebt scheme. One had previously threatened jail for those said to be overpaid benefits. Guardian Australia had been reporting on claims from unnamed Centrelink staff members and welfare recipients that thousands of people were being wrongly issued welfare debts. Influential activists including Asher Wolf and Lyndsey Jackson created the effective #notmydebt online campaign.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  But the Department of Human Services (DHS, now known as Services Australia) which ran Centrelink, claimed the reporting was inaccurate and, as Campbell later said, the media had drummed up the story during a quiet summer for news. At one stage, it even released the personal information of a welfare recipient who had written an opinion piece criticising the scheme. After the Community and Public Sector Union obtained and released an email from a Centrelink staff whistleblower (not Taylor) outlining concerns about the program in January 2017, Campbell issued an all-staff email. \u201cIt is important to me to address some recent incorrect reporting with you directly,\u201d she said in the 25 January 2017 missive. \u201cHow we match records with the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) is not a new process \u2014we have been doing it successfully for many years. There have also been no changes to how we assess income or calculate and recover debt.\u201d As a frontline staff member who had worked in Centrelink compliance for nearly six years, Taylor had become increasingly outraged by the new ways she and her colleagues were being asked to calculate alleged welfare debts. She had already shot off an initial \u2013 also lengthy \u2013 email outlining her concerns to managers in January 2016. She knew Campbell\u2019s claims were wrong. Things had changed. Her email to Campbell is a prescient, devastating take-down of the program. Taylor was \u201ca loyal employee of many years standing who has only ever raised concerns in-house\u201d. She wanted to \u201crespond to you directly as your statement tells me that you are being misled and I want to ensure my words reach you\u201d. It is easy to understand why Taylor thought her message might not cut through. Taylor was an APS4-level employee, one of 17,000 of those in a department of about 32,000 staff members. Campbell was the top boss and, according to some who have given evidence at the royal commission, an intimidating figure. Campbell has not yet been asked by the royal commission to respond to these claims but returns to the stand next week.  Directly contradicting her boss, Taylor wrote: \u201cThere has been a very dramatic change within the last 18 months to the way in which compliance assesses income and calculates and recovers debt. I was involved in both the old and new processes and can provide a first-hand explanation to you.\u201d Taylor identified several key issues, including the use of \u201cincome averaging\u201d \u2013 the central plank of the robodebt scheme \u2013 which was subsequently found to be unlawful by a court, leading to a $1.8bn settlement. Taylor explained that staff had previously used ATO data (annual pay statements) as a guide to see if someone may have underreported their fortnightly income to Centrelink. Then they would seek information from the person\u2019s employer so they could properly investigate the case. \u201cIt was not so much thinking, \u2018Can they legally do that?\u2019\u201d Taylor says now. \u201cIt was thinking, \u2018We shouldn\u2019t be doing this.\u2019\u201d What disturbed her was that \u2013 legal or not \u2013 the debts were not accurate. \u201cWe also knew that many customers would assume that Centrelink had all the information and that it must be right,\u201d Taylor says. Darren O\u2019Donovan, an administrative law lecturer at LaTrobe University and one of the nation\u2019s top robodebt experts, says Taylor\u2019s account was a \u201cclear-eyed take down of the miscalculations that drove robodebt\u201d. \u201cThe ways payroll records were deficient or impossible to obtain are named, one by one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt spells out how crude averaging of an annual figure simply could not reflect the lived reality of casualised work, particularly for young people. Documents published by the royal commission show that within four minutes, Campbell asked for immediate analysis of Taylor\u2019s concerns. Campbell also suspected, incorrectly, that Taylor would have sent the email to the union.  The following day, DHS senior managers held a teleconference with Taylor. The following week, one flew to Brisbane to meet with her personally. Taylor still has her notes of those meetings, in which she did her best to get her message across. If these events suggest the department was taking her concerns seriously, a close reading of the documents indicates otherwise. In a briefing to Campbell, DHS officials are dismissive. They suggest \u201cit was clear\u201d Taylor didn\u2019t understand they \u201ccapabilities\u201d of the system. They also portray her as overly sympathetic to welfare recipients, saying she \u201cidentified strongly with customers and expressed that customers should be given the benefit of the doubt\u201d. Ten days later, Campbell\u2019s deputy, Malisa Golightly, wrote to Taylor saying her \u201csuggestions are being considered and will be taken into account in our continuous improvement processes\u201d. After that, \u201cnot a lot happened, to be honest,\u201d Taylor says. O\u2019Donovan says: \u201cInternal voices of reason were silenced by a stubborn refusal to confront mistakes and the pursuit of budgetary targets\u201d. Melissa Donnelly, national secretary of the CPSU, says: \u201cFrom the outset, the CPSU and frontline staff in Services Australia were raising alarm bells about the Robodebt scheme; unfortunately, the concerns of frontline expert workers were persistently ignored.\u201d Taylor says she is one of many Centrelink officials who she believed had raised concerns. \u201cI did say, \u2018This is the sort of thing that ends up in a royal commission,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI also said, \u2018People will commit suicide.\u2019 And it absolutely devastates me that that\u2019s what happened. The feeling of hopelessness up against the bureaucracy would be overwhelming.\u201d Taylor is yet to be contacted by the royal commission. \u201cOnce you demonise people, you can get away with a lot of things,\u201d Taylor says now. \u201cWe went from this thing that 95% [of welfare recipients] are doing the right thing, to, almost 95% are ripping us off because of this data-matching. \u201cWe were compliance officers and we were the ones stealing from our customers. How crazy was that? It\u2019s just unbelievable.\u201d The royal commission continues."

                    "body": "When Chris Wilder got chatting to Antonio Conte at a recent awards night, Middlesbrough\u2019s manager jokingly accused the Italian of copying his tactical blueprint. At his former club, Sheffield United and, albeit to a lesser extent, on Teesside today, Wilder has built teams around attack-minded wing-backs and a trio of sometimes overlapping centre-halves. It is not a million miles removed from the system Conte swiftly installed at Tottenham, favoured utilising at previous clubs and, like his FA Cup fifth-round opponents on Tuesday night, seems philosophically attuned to.  \u201cI said to Antonio at one awards evening that he was copying me,\u201d Wilder recalled as he looked forward to a reunion with Conte in front of a near 35,000 sellout crowd at the Riverside. \u201cBut, actually, I\u2019m not so sure about that. Spurs have a world-class manager.\u201d If Conte is unlikely to underestimate a Boro side not merely pushing strongly for promotion from the Championship but which knocked Manchester United out of the FA Cup \u2013 winning on penalties at Old Trafford in the fourth round \u2013 Wilder is certainly not playing down the tactical challenge ahead. \u201cJust look at Antonio Conte\u2019s record,\u201d he said. \u201cIt speaks for itself and he\u2019s got an incredible passion to help his team. For us to beat Spurs would be an incredible achievement. \u201cJust as we did at Old Trafford, we understand that a lot of things have to go for us and we have to be at our absolute best to give ourselves an opportunity.\u201d Middlesbrough have improved significantly since Wilder succeeded Neil Warnock in November but, following an unforeseen 3-2 defeat at Barnsley last Saturday, they slipped to eighth in the second tier, two points off a play-off place.  \u201cIf we play as badly as we did in the first 15 minutes at Oakwell it will quickly be game over against Spurs and we might as well go home at half time,\u201d Wilder said. Boro\u2019s manager will welcome the return of Matt Crooks, so impressive at Manchester United, to midfield following suspension. He is also hoping his influential Australia international Riley McGree could be passed fit in time to start in the same department. Crooks, who began his career at Manchester United, has impressed this season after being signed from Rotherham by Warnock last summer. Wilder believes the 28-year-old is one of a number of Boro players potentially capable of holding their own at Premier league level. \u201cMatt\u2019s work ethic is fabulous and he chips in with goals too,\u201d Boro\u2019s manager said of his leading scorer. \u201cHe was good against Manchester United but blew up after 60 minutes because of the emotional exhaustion of playing against his former club. \u201cHopefully Matt will have learnt from that because, to play in the biggest games, you can\u2019t get emotional, you\u2019ve got to stay calm.\u201d"

Sunday\u2019s thrilling 2-2 draw at the Etihad Stadium leaves City a point ahead of J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team and for all associated with Liverpool, there may be a feeling that this season will replicate the 2018-19 campaign when both sides kept winning during the home straight and it was ultimately Pep Guardiola\u2019s men who triumphed, 98 points to 97.  \u201cWe just need to keep winning games,\u201d said Robertson. \u201cWe had to do it that year and we have to do it this year. It\u2019s obviously out of our hands, if they win all their games then it is their league but if they do drop points we need to be ready to pounce. The only way of doing that is by winning games, if we do that then let\u2019s see where we end up in May.\u201d City\u2019s run-in sees them play Brighton, Watford, Leeds, Newcastle, West Ham and Aston Villa plus a rearranged meeting with Wolves. Liverpool\u2019s schedule takes in Manchester United, Everton, Newcastle, Tottenham, Villa, Southampton and Wolves.  Asked if City have the easier set of remaining games, Robertson added: \u201cWe can only focus on ourselves. I think we have got a really tough run-in, all games are tough in the Premier League especially when you get to the end bit. But we have some really tough games and we need to try to win them, we need to be at our best, we need to be better than we were [against City] and if we do that then let\u2019s see where we end up and hopefully we can win something. If not, we will give it our best shot. \u201cTime will tell [if we need to win them all]. You never know. We need to win as many games as it takes \u2013 it\u2019s as simple as that. We wait to see what results happen, we need to keep dealing with each game as it comes.\u201d  Liverpool host Benfica in Wednesday\u2019s Champions League quarter-finalsecond leg, holding a 3-1 advantage from the first tie in Lisbon, before facing City again in Saturday\u2019s FA Cup semi-final at Wembley. Robertson offered a simple formula regarding how players approach such an intensive period. \u201cJust keep focusing on the next one,\u201d said the left-back. \u201cWe are already focused on Benfica now. We have a lead but we need to get through. We need to try to win that and then get into the semi-finals. If we do that then we focus on the next one. We are still fighting on all fronts, we still have a lot of games to play and if we win hopefully it ends with silverware.\u201d"

                    "body": "There are growing calls for a major overhaul of the way rape complainants are treated within the justice system in the wake of the Bruce Lehrmann trial, with a former federal court judge urging governments to appoint victim advocates to support women through the process. Prosecutors in the ACT on Friday announced they would not seek a second trial of Lehrmann because of the \u201csignificant and unacceptable risk to the life\u201d of Brittany Higgins who is receiving mental health support in hospital. The decision means Lehrmann, who pleaded not guilty to one count of sexual intercourse without consent, will not face trial and retains the presumption of innocence. But revelations about the impact of the court process on Higgins have prompted calls for changes to better support complainants.  The Australian National University\u2019s Global Institute for Women\u2019s Leadership, of which Higgins is a member, said the case underscored the \u201chuge toll faced by complainants in sexual assault prosecutions\u201d. \u201cThere is a clear need for ongoing law reform and practical changes in both the criminal justice system and the laws, processes and institutions that prohibit workplace harassment and ensure safe, respectful workplaces,\u201d the institute said in a statement on Friday. \u201cThe personal price she has paid has been astronomical. We cannot continue to expect individuals to pay such a price in the pursuit of justice, let alone systemic change.\u201d The head of the Victorian Law Reform Commission and a former federal court judge, Anthony North QC, produced a comprehensive blueprint last year for system-wide reforms to better support complainants while protecting an accused\u2019s right to a fair trial. North said complainants needed to be supported at every stage of the process.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  The reforms proposed by the commission include establishing online reporting systems for initial complaints, improved training for police in obtaining a complainant\u2019s version of events, independent scrutiny of prosecutorial decisions, specialised training for judges hearing sexual offences, and greater use of video recordings of a complainant\u2019s evidence in retrials. In court, Higgins was supported by the victims of crime commissioner Heidi Yates.  North has called for the establishment of a more formal system of independent victim advocates, who would advise complainants from the earliest possible stage of the process, inform them about the way the justice system works and \u201chold the hand of the victim-survivor at the time of greatest trauma\u201d.  \u201cThe figures \u2026 are just incredibly disturbing,\u201d he said. \u201cOne in five women over 15 have experienced a sexual assault in their lifetime. Less than one-third of those ever get to being reported. Of those that are reported, about one-third are prosecuted \u2026 and then those that get to trial, there\u2019s a 50% conviction rate, which is somewhat less than other criminal offences.\u201d  The ACT attorney general, Shane Rattenbury, confirmed his government was considering reforms to juror misconduct laws after the ACT supreme court was left unable to punish the juror in the Lehrmann trial who brought in outside research material on sexual assaults, despite repeated instructions not to. The government is examining whether majority verdicts should be allowed in the ACT \u2013 like other jurisdictions \u2013 though that work began prior to the Lehrmann trial. \u201cThe chief justice has highlighted differences between the ACT and other jurisdictions, so what I want to do now is have a look in detail at what other jurisdictions do, look at what the current options are in the ACT and we will make decisions from there about whether reform is needed,\u201d Rattenbury said on Friday. Federal Greens senators Larissa Waters and Sarah Hanson-Young said they would pursue reforms to better support victims to come forward. \u201cTo end Australia\u2019s culture of sexual violence, harassment and abuse we must start by supporting victims to come forward, and dismantling power imbalances and gender stereotypes that deter them from doing so,\u201d they said in a joint statement. \u201cThe Greens support the work being done to identify problems with criminal justice responses to sexual violence and strengthen trauma-informed approaches and wrap-around services.\u201d"

Here\u2019s where we stand:\n\nThe second mass strikes in days has been launched by Russia across Ukraine, with at least 70 rockets fired at several regions on Friday morning. So far authorities have said three people died and several injured, including three children, when one of the rockets hit a residential building in the southern city of Kryvyi Rih in Dnipro region.\nThe mass strikes appeared to be a continuation of the Kremlin\u2019s attempt to destroy Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure. Ukraine\u2019s state energy company Ukrenergo said energy consumption had fallen by 50% as a result of the attacks. The company said Russia had hit thermal power plants, hydroelectric plants and substations of main networks. Ukrenergo said it will take longer to repair the national grid and restore power than it did after previous Russian missile attacks, with priority given to \u201ccritical infrastructure facilities\u201d.\nEnergy infrastructure was hit across the country, resulting in complete outages in Ukraine\u2019s eastern and central regions of Kharkiv and Poltava. Nine power facilities in the country were damaged by Friday\u2019s strikes, Ukraine\u2019s energy minister, Herman Halushchenko, said. The mayor of Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city, said the missile strikes caused \u201ccolossal\u201d damage to infrastructure and left the city without power, heating and water. A senior Ukrainian presidential official said emergency power shutdowns were being brought in across the country.\nThe Kyiv city administration said Ukraine\u2019s capital had withstood \u201cone of the biggest rocket attacks\u201d launched by Russian forces since they invaded Ukraine nearly 10 months ago. The administration said Ukrainian air defence forces shot down 37 of \u201cabout 40\u201d that entered the city\u2019s airspace. There were water disruptions in every district, according to the city\u2019s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, and local people reported immediate power outages.\nAt least eight people were killed and 23 injured by Ukrainian shelling in the Russian-controlled Luhansk region of Ukraine, Russia\u2019s state Tass news agency reported on Friday, citing an unidentified source in the emergency services. The shelling destroyed a building in the village of Lantrativka and some people were trapped under rubble, Tass said. The head of the \u201cpeople\u2019s militia\u201d in Luhansk also claimed there were civilian casualties as a result of Ukrainian shelling on the town of Svatove on Friday morning.\nThe White House has said the next security assistance package for Ukraine was coming and it was expected to include more air defence capabilities for the country. Russia\u2019s foreign ministry warned this week that if the US delivered sophisticated Patriot air defence systems to Ukraine, such systems and any crews that accompany them would be a legitimate target for the Russian military. Washington rejected the threat.\nEU states should buy arms jointly to replenish stocks after supplying Ukraine, said the bloc\u2019s defence agency, warning the US may not always be able to shield Europe from threats. \u201cThe Russian war of aggression against Ukraine demonstrates our capability shortfalls,\u201d said Ji\u0159\u00ed \u0160ediv\u00fd, chief executive of the European Defence Agency. The agency was in talks with European arms firms about boosting production, he said, as well as with countries about clubbing together to buy equipment and ammunition.\nThe head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said she welcomes the agreement by EU leaders on the ninth package of sanctions against Russia. EU leaders agreed on Thursday to provide \u20ac18bn in financing to Ukraine next year as well as to a fresh package of sanctions, which will designate nearly 200 more people and bar investment in Russia\u2019s mining industry, among other steps. The Kremlin said it would study the latest package of EU sanctions and then formulate its response.\nPresident Vladimir Putin spoke by phone with the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, on Friday. The Kremlin said Putin gave \u201cfundamental assessments\u201d of the conflict in Ukraine during the call, at Modi\u2019s request. The Indian leader\u2019s office was cited as saying that he had reiterated his call for dialogue and diplomacy as the only way forward in the conflict.\nPutin will visit Belarus for talks with the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, on Monday. The pair will discuss Russian-Belarusian integration \u201cas well as current topics on the international and regional agenda\u201d, the Kremlin said. Putin and Lukashenko will hold a one-on-one meeting in which they will \u201cgive priority to security issues and exchange views on the situation in the region and the world\u201d, Belarusian state-owned news agency Belta said, without mentioning Ukraine.\nSenior Ukrainian officials say Putin is preparing for a major new offensive in the new year, despite a series of humiliating battlefield setbacks for Russia in recent months. In an interview with the Guardian, Ukraine\u2019s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said that while Ukraine was now able to successfully defend itself against Russia\u2019s missile attacks targeting key infrastructure, including the energy grid, evidence was emerging that the Kremlin was preparing a broad new offensive.\nRussia is to double the number of test launches of its intercontinental ballistic missiles to eight next year from four in 2022, the commander of strategic rocket forces was quoted as saying. Sergei Karakayev told the military newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda that the eight test flights would be scheduled from two launch sites \u2013 one near Murmansk in the north, the other near Volgograd in the south.\nPolish prosecutors are investigating a \u201cviolent release of energy\u201d at the national police headquarters amid media reports that the chief of police fired a grenade launcher in his office. Poland\u2019s interior ministry said on Thursday that Jaros\u0142aw Szymczyk, the police commander in chief, was injured and taken to hospital when a present he received during a visit to Ukraine exploded at police headquarters in Warsaw.\nFifa has reportedly rebuffed a request by Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to share a message of world peace before the kickoff at the World Cup final on Sunday. Talks between Ukraine and Fifa are still under way, a source told CNN, adding that Zelenskiy\u2019s office was surprised by the governing body\u2019s response.\nBritain\u2019s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has reportedly ordered an audit into the progress of the war in Ukraine. A source told BBC Newsnight that the audit, known as a data-driven assessment, is designed to assess the progress of the war and the significance of the UK\u2019s military contributions to Ukraine.\nA Russian businessman believed to be a close ally of Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Wagner Group founder, has been taken to hospital in Central African Republic (CAR) after an \u201cassassination attempt\u201d, the RIA Novosti news agency has reported, citing the local Russian embassy. Dmitry Sytii, who officially works as head of the \u201cRussian House\u201d culture centre in CAR\u2019s capital, Bangui, had sanctions imposed on him by the US in September 2020 for his alleged links to Wagner Group, a private military group that has deployed more than 1,000 fighters in the unstable country to fight rebels.\n\n\n\n\n 6.38pm  \n\nA Russian businessman believed to be a close ally of Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Wagner Group founder, has been taken to hospital in Central African Republic (CAR) after an \u201cassassination attempt\u201d, the RIA Novosti news agency has reported, citing the local Russian embassy.\nDmitry Sytii, who officially works as head of the \u201cRussian House\u201d culture centre in CAR\u2019s capital, Bangui, had sanctions imposed on him by the US in September 2020 for his alleged links to Wagner Group, a private military group that has deployed more than 1,000 fighters in the unstable country to fight rebels.\nThe Russian embassy in Bangui did not immediately comment on the circumstances of the alleged assassination attempt.\nPrigozhin, a Russian oligarch under US sanctions who has led Russia\u2019s recent push into Africa, said in a statement published on Friday that Sytii received a mailed parcel containing an explosive that detonated in his hands.\n\u201cAt the moment, the life of Dmitry Sytii hangs in balance. Russian doctors are doing everything possible in the Bangui hospital to save him,\u201d Prigozhin said in a statement posted by his catering company, Concord, that described Sytii as a \u201cPatriot of Russia and Central African Republic\u201d.\nPrigozhin, without providing evidence, claimed that the assassination attack was coordinated from France. \n\nI have already contacted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation so that it initiates the procedure for declaring France a state sponsor of terrorism, as well as conducting a thorough investigation of the terrorist methods of France and its western allies \u2013 the United States and others.\n\nThe French foreign ministry in a statement denied any involvement.\nWestern officials say that Prigozhin and his companies are the spearhead of an ambitious \u2013 if opportunistic \u2013 effort by Russia to extend its influence in more than a dozen African states, often at the expense of France.\nRead the full story here:\n\n\n\n\n 6.25pm  \n\nBritain\u2019s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has reportedly ordered an audit into the progress of the war in Ukraine.\nA source told BBC Newsnight that the audit, known as a data-driven assessment, is designed to assess the progress of the war and the significance of the UK\u2019s military contributions to Ukraine. \nThe request has reportedly raised alarm bells among some Whitehall staff, with the source saying:\n\nWars aren\u2019t won [by dashboards]. Wars are won on instinct. At the start of this it was Boris (Johnson) sitting down and saying: \u2018Let\u2019s just go for this.\u2019 So Rishi needs to channel his inner Boris on foreign policy though not of course on anything else.\n\nThe BBC understands that President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is aware of the debate within the UK over its support of Ukraine and is encouraging Sunak to maintain strong military support for his country.\nThe source added:\n\nPresident Zelenskiy has sensed what is going on.

Here\u2019s where we stand:\n\nThe second mass strikes in days has been launched by Russia across Ukraine, with at least 70 rockets fired at several regions on Friday morning. So far authorities have said two people died and several injured, including three children, when one of the rockets hit a residential building in the southern city of Kryvyi Rih in Dnipro region.\nThe mass strikes appeared to be a continuation of the Kremlin\u2019s attempt to destroy Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure. Ukraine\u2019s state energy company Ukrenergo said energy consumption had fallen by 50% as a result of the attacks. The company said Russia had hit thermal power plants, hydroelectric plants and substations of main networks. Ukrenergo said it will take longer to repair the national grid and restore power than it did after previous Russian missile attacks, with priority given to \u201ccritical infrastructure facilities\u201d.\nEnergy infrastructure was hit across the country, resulting in complete outages in Ukraine\u2019s eastern and central regions of Kharkiv and Poltava. Nine power facilities in the country were damaged by Friday\u2019s strikes, Ukraine\u2019s energy minister, Herman Halushchenko, said. The mayor of Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city, said the missile strikes caused \u201ccolossal\u201d damage to infrastructure and left the city without power, heating and water. A senior Ukrainian presidential official said emergency power shutdowns were being brought in across the country.\nThe Kyiv city administration said Ukraine\u2019s capital had withstood \u201cone of the biggest rocket attacks\u201d launched by Russian forces since they invaded Ukraine nearly 10 months ago. The administration said Ukrainian air defence forces shot down 37 of \u201cabout 40\u201d that entered the city\u2019s airspace. There were water disruptions in every district, according to the city\u2019s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, and local people reported immediate power outages.\nAt least eight people were killed and 23 injured by Ukrainian shelling in the Russian-controlled Luhansk region of Ukraine, Russia\u2019s state Tass news agency reported on Friday, citing an unidentified source in the emergency services. The shelling destroyed a building in the village of Lantrativka and some people were trapped under rubble, Tass said. The head of the \u201cpeople\u2019s militia\u201d in Luhansk also claimed there were civilian casualties as a result of Ukrainian shelling on the town of Svatove on Friday morning.\nThe White House has said the next security assistance package for Ukraine was coming and it was expected to include more air defence capabilities for the country. Russia\u2019s foreign ministry warned this week that if the US delivered sophisticated Patriot air defence systems to Ukraine, such systems and any crews that accompany them would be a legitimate target for the Russian military. Washington rejected the threat.\nEU states should buy arms jointly to replenish stocks after supplying Ukraine, said the bloc\u2019s defence agency, warning the US may not always be able to shield Europe from threats. \u201cThe Russian war of aggression against Ukraine demonstrates our capability shortfalls,\u201d said Ji\u0159\u00ed \u0160ediv\u00fd, chief executive of the European Defence Agency. The agency was in talks with European arms firms about boosting production, he said, as well as with countries about clubbing together to buy equipment and ammunition.\nThe head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said she welcomes the agreement by EU leaders on the ninth package of sanctions against Russia. EU leaders agreed on Thursday to provide \u20ac18bn in financing to Ukraine next year as well as to a fresh package of sanctions, which will designate nearly 200 more people and bar investment in Russia\u2019s mining industry, among other steps. The Kremlin said it would study the latest package of EU sanctions and then formulate its response.\nRussian president, Vladimir Putin, spoke by phone with the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, on Friday. The Kremlin said Putin gave \u201cfundamental assessments\u201d of the conflict in Ukraine during the call, at Modi\u2019s request. The Indian leader\u2019s office was cited as saying that he had reiterated his call for dialogue and diplomacy as the only way forward in the conflict.\nPutin will visit Belarus for talks with the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, on Monday. The pair will discuss Russian-Belarusian integration \u201cas well as current topics on the international and regional agenda\u201d, the Kremlin said. Putin and Lukashenko will hold a one-on-one meeting in which they will \u201cgive priority to security issues and exchange views on the situation in the region and the world\u201d, Belarusian state-owned news agency Belta said, without mentioning Ukraine.\nSenior Ukrainian officials say Putin is preparing for a major new offensive in the new year, despite a series of humiliating battlefield setbacks for Russia in recent months. In an interview with the Guardian, Ukraine\u2019s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said that while Ukraine was now able to successfully defend itself against Russia\u2019s missile attacks targeting key infrastructure, including the energy grid, evidence was emerging that the Kremlin was preparing a broad new offensive.\nRussia is to double the number of test launches of its intercontinental ballistic missiles to eight next year from four in 2022, the commander of strategic rocket forces was quoted as saying. Sergei Karakayev told the military newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda that the eight test flights would be scheduled from two launch sites \u2013 one near Murmansk in the north, the other near Volgograd in the south.\nFifa has reportedly rebuffed a request by Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to share a message of world peace before the kickoff at the World Cup final on Sunday.

Here is a roundup of the day\u2019s top news stories so far:\n\nThe second mass air attack in days has been launched by Russia across Ukraine with a barrage of rockets fired at several regions across the country. The aim of the mass attack, authorities said, appeared to be to destroy Ukraine\u2019s power grid in the hope that damaging Ukraine away from the frontline will enable Russia to make gains on the battlefield.\nIn the capital, Kyiv, explosions have been heard in the south-western district of Holosiivkyi, on Ukraine\u2019s right bank, as well as the eastern districts of Dniprovskyi and Desnyanskyi, according to Kyiv\u2019s mayor Vitaliy Klitschko. It is not yet clear if the rockets hit their targets or the sounds were that of Ukraine\u2019s air defence. So far hits have been reported in the southern city of Kryvih Rih, where a residential building, not energy facility, was struck. The deputy head of Ukraine\u2019s presidential administration, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, said there may be victims under the rubble and emergency services were on the scene.\nElsewhere, Ukraine\u2019s eastern and central regions of Kharkiv and Poltava, the authorities have reported power outages. The governor of Kharkiv, Oleh Syniehubov, confirmed that energy infrastructure had been hit and Ukraine\u2019s public broadcaster Suspilne said there were power outages in the region. Neighbouring Polatava region is without electricity, according the mayor of the city of Poltava, Oleksandr Fedoryuk. The sound of air defence could also heard in the regions of Dnipro, Ternopil, Mykolaiv, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, Kirovohrad, Zhytomyr, Khmelnytskyi and Vinnytsia.\nA senior Ukrainian presidential official said on Friday that emergency power shutdowns were being brought in across the country after Russian missiles hit energy facilities in several regions. Russia launched dozens of missiles at Ukraine, the latest in a wave of attacks on critical infrastructure.\nTwo people died and a further five were injured including two children after a rocket hit a residential building in Kryvyi Rih, the head of Dnipro region, Valentyn Reznichenko said on his Telegram. The injured are being treated in hospital. The building\u2019s entrance was destroyed in the attack, he added.\nAt least eight people were killed and 23 injured by Ukrainian shelling in the Russian-controlled Luhansk region of Ukraine, Russia\u2019s state TASS news agency reported on Friday, citing an unidentified source in the emergency services. The shelling destroyed a building in the village of Lantrativka and some people were trapped under rubble, TASS said.\nVladimir Putin is preparing for a major new offensive in the new year, Ukraine\u2019s defence minister has said. In an interview with the Guardian, Oleksii Reznikov said evidence was emerging that the Kremlin was preparing a broad new campaign despite a series of humiliating battlefield setbacks for Russia in recent months. Referring to Russia\u2019s partial mobilisation of about 300,000 soldiers, Reznikov suggested that while half \u2013 often after receiving minimal training \u2013 were being used to reinforce Moscow\u2019s forces now, the remainder were being prepared more thoroughly for future offensives.\nPutin will visit Belarus on Monday, AFP is reporting, citing the Minsk presidential press service. Putin\u2019s visit comes as the UK warns that Belarus is reportedly holding \u201creadiness exercises\u201d. Russia has also deployed extra units of mobilised reservists to Belarus. The UK Ministry of Defence wrote that Belarusian troops would be unlikely to constitute a force capable of conducting a successful new assault into northern Ukraine.\nThe head of Ukraine\u2019s armed forces believes Russia will make a renewed attempt at capturing the capital, Kyiv, after its previous attack was repelled earlier this year. In an interview with the Economist, Gen Valeriy Zaluzhny said he was trying to prepare for Russian forces to have another go at taking the city, possibly in February or March.\nEU states should buy arms jointly to replenish stocks after supplying Ukraine, said the bloc\u2019s defence agency, warning the US may not always be able to shield Europe from threats. \u201cThe Russian war of aggression against Ukraine demonstrates our capability shortfalls,\u201d said Ji\u0159\u00ed \u0160ediv\u00fd, chief executive of the European Defence Agency, an EU body that helps the bloc\u2019s governments to develop their military capabilities.\nThe Kremlin said on Friday it would study the latest package of EU sanctions against Russia and then formulate its response. EU leaders agreed on Thursday to provide 18 billion euros in financing to Ukraine next year and hit Moscow with a ninth package of sanctions. The measures designate nearly 200 more people and bar investment in Russia\u2019s mining industry, among other steps.\nRussian shelling killed two people, including a Red Cross worker, in Kherson on Thursday and completely cut power in the southern city, Ukrainian officials said, with temperatures near freezing. Moscow-allied officials in the Russian-occupied city of Donetsk, meanwhile, said they had come under some of the heaviest shelling in years from Ukrainian forces, leaving one person dead.\nRussia is to double the number of test launches of its intercontinental ballistic missiles to eight next year from four in 2022, the commander of strategic rocket forces was quoted as saying on Friday. Sergei Karakayev told the military newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda that the eight test flights would be scheduled from two launch sites \u2013 one near Murmansk in the north, the other near Volgograd in the south.\nThe US military announced it would expand training in Germany of Ukrainian military personnel. Starting in January, 500 troops a month would be trained, building on more than 15,000 Ukrainians trained by the US and its allies since April.\nElectricity blackouts due to Russian missile and drone attacks on Ukraine\u2019s power infrastructure are crippling its economy, including in key sectors such as mining and manufacturing. The report in the Washington Post said Ukraine needed another $2bn a month on top of the $55bn already projected for next year to meet basic expenses.\n\nThat\u2019s all from me, Tom Ambrose, for the time being.

The deputy head of Ukraine\u2019s presidential administration, Kyrylo Tymoshehnko, said there may be victims under the rubble and emergency services were on the scene.\nElsewhere, Ukraine\u2019s eastern and central regions of Kharkiv and Poltava, the authorities have reported power outages. The governor of Kharkiv, Oleh Syniehubov, confirmed that energy infrastructure had been hit and Ukraine\u2019s public broadcasts Suspilne said there were power outages in the region. Neighbouring Polatava region is without electricity, according the mayor of the city of Poltava, Oleksandr Fedoryuk.\nThe sound of air defence could also heard in the regions of Dnipro, Ternipol, Mykolaiv, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, Kivrohrad, Zhytomyr, Khmelnytskyi and Vinnytsia.\nOn Wednesday, Russia launched 13 Iranian-supplied drones at Kyiv city and Kyiv region, according to Ukraine\u2019s air forces. Ukraine\u2019s air defence forces said they shot down all 13. No casualties were reported, though a few buildings were damaged by the debris of the downed drones.\nUkraine\u2019s defence minister Oleksii Reznikov told the Guardian on Thursday that Ukraine was winning the air war, thanks to its air defence forces honing their skills and equipment over the past nine months. He said that efficiency of Ukraine\u2019s air defence forces had gone from 50% to 80% since the war began.\n\n\n\n 8.22am  \n\nEuropean Union states should buy arms jointly to replenish stocks after supplying Ukraine, said the bloc\u2019s defence agency, warning the United States may not always be able to shield Europe from threats.\n\u201cThe Russian war of aggression against Ukraine demonstrates our capability shortfalls,\u201d said Jiri Sedivy, chief executive of the European Defence Agency, an EU body that helps the bloc\u2019s governments to develop their military capabilities.\nThe agency was in talks with European arms firms about boosting production, he said, as well as with countries about clubbing together to buy equipment and ammunition, Reuters reported.\n\u201cWhat is important is that we would be able, the European Union, to become a credible provider of security in protecting citizens,\u201d he told Reuters, urging countries to heed U.S. calls to invest in defence.\n\u201cThe United States will be inevitably engaged in Asia Pacific and not be able to provide some of the essential enablers such as strategic airlift, reconnaissance aircraft, precision-guided missiles and air defences.\u201d\nHe pointed also to the threat of terrorism and failed states in the Middle East or north Africa.\n\n\n\n 7.51am  \n\nThe mayor of the Poltava city, Oleksandr Mamai has said Poltava region is without electricity, indicating that Russia hit energy infrastructure in the area. \nIn Kryvyi Rih, a residential building has been hit and there may be victims below the rubble, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, a deputy head of Ukraines presidential administration has said on Telegram \nIn Kyiv explosions have been heard in the south western district of Holosiivskyi as well as the eastern districts of Desnyanskyi and Dniprovskyi on the left bank. No casualties have been reported so far. \nOne rocket has been shot down near Bucha in Kyiv region, according to Bucha\u2019s mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk. \n\n\n\n 7.39am  \n\nKyiv\u2019s mayor Vitaliy Klitschko is reporting explosions in the north-eastern Desna district of Kyiv, where there is a major power plant. \nIt\u2019s not clear if the plant has been hit. \n\n\n\n 7.24am  \nCritical infrastructure in Ukraine hit in Russian missile attack\n\nRussia launched a new barrage of missile at Ukraine on Friday and air defence systems went into operation across the country, Ukrainian officials said.\nExplosions were heard in the eastern city of Kharkiv and local officials said critical infrastructure had been hit. Local officials in the Black Sea region of Odesa said critical infrastructure had also been hit there.\nReuters witnesses heard explosions in the capital Kyiv. It was not immediately clear if any were caused by missiles getting through air defences.\nThere was no immediate word of casualties and it was not clear what critical infrastructure had been hit.\nThe governor of the northern region of Sumy said there were power outages in his region because of Friday\u2019s missile strikes.\n\n\n\n 7.03am  \n\nThat\u2019s it from me, Helen Sullivan, for now. My colleague Tom Ambrose will take you through the developments in this morning\u2019s strikes. \n\n\n\n 6.50am  \nDozens of missiles fired at Ukraine \u2013 reports\n\nAs many as 60 Russian missiles have been spotted heading to Ukrainian airspace, said Vitaliy Kim, who is the governor of the Mykolaiv region in southern Ukraine.\n\u201cA part of them is already over northern Ukraine,\u201d he wrote on Telegram.\nThe Guardian could not verify this claim independently.\n\nUpdated at 7.50am GMT\n\n\n 6.48am  \nMultiple missiles launched on Ukraine\n\nMultiple rockets have reportedly been launched on Ukraine this morning, according to Anton Gerashchenko, adviser to Ukraine\u2019s minister of internal affairs. Air raid alerts have been issued in regions across the country:\n\n\nUpdated at 7.49am GMT\n\n\n 6.38am  \n\n\u201cDo not ignore air raid alerts, remain in shelters,\u201d Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of Ukraine\u2019s president\u2019s office wrote a few moments ago on Telegram messaging app.\n\n\n\n 6.36am  \nPutin to visit Belarus on Monday\n\nPutin will visit Belarus on Monday, AFP is reporting, citing the Minsk presidential press service. Putin\u2019s visit comes as the UK warns that Belarus is reportedly holding \u201creadiness exercises\u201d. Russia has also deployed extra units of mobilised reservists to Belarus.\nThe UK Ministry of Defence wrote that Belarusian troops would be unlikely to constitute a force capable of conducting a successful new assault into northern Ukraine.\n\n\nUpdated at 7.49am GMT\n\n\n 6.24am  \nAir raid alerts issued for multiple Ukrainian regions\n\nUkrainians are once again waking up to the sound of air raid sirens and rushing to shelters, as air raid alerts are issued for regions including Kyiv, Kharkiv, Zhytomyr and Vinnytsia, Chernihiv, Mykolaiv and Kirovohrad. \n\n\n\n 6.21am  \nThreat of 'massive missile strike' says Zhytomyr governor\n\nVitaliy Bunechko, the Zhytomyr regional governor, has called on people to remain in shelters due to the threat of a \u201cmassive missile strike\u201d. \n\n\n\n 6.13am  \nAir raids sound in Kyiv\n\nThe Kyiv City Administration has called on people in the Ukrainian capital to head to shelters amid air raid alerts. \n\u201cAn air raid alert has been announced in the capital! Please go to shelter!\u201d the administration posted on Telegram a few moments ago. \n\n\n\n 6.02am  \nAir raid sirens in Kharkiv\n\nOleg Synegubov, the head of Kharkiv regional administration, has warned people via Telegram to remain in shelters amid air raid alarms this morning. \n\n\n\n 5.58am  \nAt least eight killed in Russian shelling of village in Luhansk\n\nAt least eight people were killed and 23 injured by Ukrainian shelling in the Russian-controlled Luhansk region of Ukraine, Russia\u2019s state TASS news agency reported on Friday, citing an unidentified source in the emergency services.The shelling destroyed a building in the village of Lantrativka and some people were trapped under rubble, TASS said.Russian-backed officials from Luhank\u2019s representation to the Joint Centre of Control and Co-ordination \u2013 a ceasefire monitoring body set-up to help manage the conflict between Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian forces after 2014 \u2013 said Ukraine fired three US-made HIMARS rockets at Lantrativka at 04:10 local time (0210 GMT) on Friday morning.The head the \u201cpeople\u2019s militia\u201d in Luhansk also reported on his Telegram channel there were civilian casualties as a result of Ukrainian shelling on the town of Svatove on Friday morning. He provided no further details of the attack.Reuters could also not immediately verify the battlefield reports.\n\nUpdated at 6.07am GMT\n\n\n 5.49am  \nUS senate approves $800m in aid\n\nThe US Senate passed legislation on Thursday authorising a record $858bn in annual defence spending, including $800m in additional security assistance for Ukraine.\nThe bill extends the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, a program that \u201cprovides funding for the federal government to pay industry to produce weapons and security assistance to send to Ukraine, rather than drawing directly from current US stockpiles of weapons,\u201d CNN reports. \n\n\n\n 5.36am  \nUkrainian officials warn of major new Russian offensive\n\nSenior Ukrainian officials say Vladimir Putin is preparing for a major new offensive in the new year, despite a series of humiliating battlefield setbacks for Russia in recent months.\nIn an interview with the Guardian, Ukraine\u2019s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said that while Ukraine was now able to successfully defend itself against Russia\u2019s missile attacks targeting key infrastructure, including the energy grid, evidence was emerging that the Kremlin was preparing a broad new offensive.\nThe briefing appearsto be part of a broad, coordinated effort to warn against complacency among western allies and highlight the continuing threat Russia poses to Ukraine.\nReferring to Russia\u2019s partial mobilisation of about 300,000 soldiers, Reznikov suggested that while half \u2013 often after receiving minimal training \u2013 were being used to reinforce Moscow\u2019s forces after a series of battlefield setbacks, the remainder were being prepared more thoroughly for future offensives.\n\u201cThe second part of the mobilisation, 150,000 approximately, started their training courses in different camps,\u201d said Reznikov, speaking of Russia\u2019s mobilisation drive, which started in October.\n\u201cThe [draftees] do a minimum of three months to prepare. It means they are trying to start the next wave of the offensive probably in February, like last year. That\u2019s their plan.\u201d\nThe warnings come amid evidence of Putin\u2019s continuing desires to continue the war into next year, including missile procurement efforts from Iran, and analysis by Russian commentators suggesting that the Kremlin sees no way of retreating from the conflict.\nIsobel Koshiw and Peter Beaumont report: \n\n\n\n\n 5.28am  \nWelcome and summary\n\nHello and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I\u2019ll be bringing you the latest developments for the next few hours.\nOur top stories this morning:\nVladimir Putin is preparing for a major new offensive in the new year, Ukraine\u2019s defence minister has said. In an interview with the Guardian, Oleksii Reznikov, said evidence was emerging that the Kremlin was preparing a broad new campaign despite a series of humiliating battlefield setbacks for Russia in recent months.\nAnd the US Senate passed legislation on Thursday authorising a record $858bn in annual defence spending, including $800m in additional security assistance for Ukraine. Here are the other key recent developments:\n\nThe head of Ukraine\u2019s armed forces believes Russia will make a renewed attempt at capturing the capital, Kyiv, after its previous attack was repelled earlier this year. In an interview with the Economist, Gen Valeriy Zaluzhny said he was trying to prepare for Russian forces to have another go at taking the city, possibly in February or March.\nRussian shelling killed two people, including a Red Cross worker, in Kherson on Thursday and completely cut power in the southern city, Ukrainian officials said, with temperatures near freezing. Moscow-allied officials in the Russian-occupied city of Donetsk, meanwhile, said they had come under some of the heaviest shelling in years from Ukrainian forces, leaving one person dead.\nRussia is to double the number of test launches of its intercontinental ballistic missiles to eight next year from four in 2022, the commander of strategic rocket forces was quoted as saying on Friday. Sergei Karakayev told the military newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda that the eight test flights would be scheduled from two launch sites \u2013 one near Murmansk in the north, the other near Volgograd in the south.\nA Russian airbase in Kursk was struck on Wednesday night, a senior Ukrainian official has said. Anton Gerashchenko, a senior presidential adviser to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, posted a series of updates on Telegram, saying an \u201cunknown drone\u201d struck the military facility.\nThe US military announced it would expand training in Germany of Ukrainian military personnel. Starting in January, 500 troops a month would be trained, building on more than 15,000 Ukrainians trained by the US and its allies since April.\nElectricity blackouts due to Russian missile and drone attacks on Ukraine\u2019s power infrastructure are crippling its economy, including in key sectors such as mining and manufacturing. The report in the Washington Post said Ukraine needed another $2bn a month on top of the $55bn already projected for next year to meet basic expenses.\nAn \u20ac18bn EU finance package for Ukraine looks likely to go ahead after Poland dropped its opposition. Diplomats from Warsaw had objected to a minimum corporate tax level, which diplomats had told Reuters had \u201cblindsided\u201d those negotiating the deals. They, and Lithuania, had also argued for tighter restrictions on their neighbour Russia.\nVolodymyr Zelenskiy has said the next six months of the conflict with Russia will be \u201cdecisive\u201d. In an online address to the European Council on Thursday, Ukraine\u2019s president said: \u201cThe next six months will be decisive in many respects in the confrontation Russia started with their aggression.\u201d\nVladimir Putin has said Russia will try to overcome the financial impact of western sanctions by selling gas to its eastern neighbours. In a televised speech he said Russia would develop its economic ties with countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America.\n\n\n"

They\u2019re all interesting.\u201d OK, so let\u2019s start with clubs. \u201cIt\u2019s not terribly uncommon for MLS teams to have lengthy streaks of away matches as stadium construction/renovations are being completed (just this season Nashville played eight consecutive on the road). But for streaks with more than one home game, NYCFC recently reached 10 stadiums,\u201d tweets @thereisaparty.  Gareth Wright can top that by taking us to South Korea. \u201cI\u2019d like to nominate Seoul E-Land in Korea\u2019s K-League 2 this season,\u201d he writes. \u201cE-Land moved stadium this summer, so played their first four league games and a cup tie away from home while the new ground was prepared. However, in their first game at the new ground, the pitch was almost entirely torn up, meaning it had to be relaid. This saw their second home game played at their previous home, followed by a further six away games. Due to the fact they played Gyeongnam at both their different home stadiums, Seoul E-Land played their first 11 league fixtures in different stadiums. I\u2019m sure there are teams who have played more in total, but E-land played a total of 12 competitive games in a row at different grounds, while in an 11-team league.\u201d The fondness for taking national teams around their respective countries will likely yield a stretch of matches at different venues that goes deeper than clubs. A quick glance at Brazil\u2019s most recent fixtures shows that their past 12 matches were held at 12 different venues. However \u2026 \u201cEngland played 22 games at different venues between 2001 and 2003,\u201d notes Alun Thomas. \u201cThe friendly against Sweden on 10 November 2001 and the Euro 2004 qualifier v Liechtenstein on 10 September 2003 were both played at Old Trafford. The 21 games between, encompassing the 2002 World Cup finals, were played at: Amsterdam, Leeds, Anfield, Seogwipo, Kobe, Saitama, Sapporo, Osaka, Niigata, Fukuroi, Bratislava, Southampton, Upton Park, Villa Park, Vaduz, Sunderland, Durban, Leicester, Middlesbrough, Ipswich and Skopje. But Germany have beaten England yet again.  \u201cCountries without a fixed \u2018national stadium\u2019 could go quite a while without repeating venues,\u201d writes Mike Slattery. \u201cAll 23 matches Germany played across 2000 and 2001 were in different stadiums.\u201d We can\u2019t find another team to beat that so we\u2019ll flag a few individuals who rank high for consecutive matches at different stadiums. \u201cI\u2019ve got nine for Gareth Bale from June to September 2021,\u201d tweets @AgaTieFan.

In 2011, as Barnet player-goalkeeping coach and interim manager, he led the club to a 2-1 win over Stevenage in the Hertfordshire County FA Senior Challenge Cup final. He probably never wants to manage a club again, or it will ruin his 100% trophy-a-game record.\u201d But perhaps another one-match wonder, Sandy Stewart, is the best suggestion we have had. \u201cHe was in charge of St Johnstone for a single match after Owen Coyle left to join Burnley,\u201d tweets Andy Brook. \u201cThat match was the Scottish Challenge Cup final, which they won 3-2.\u201d More debutants in cup finals We\u2019ve had a few more examples of players who made their bows on the big occasion. \u201cGeorge Ray made his debut for Crewe aged 19 in what was then called the Johnstone\u2019s Paint Trophy final in 2013, coming on as a substitute; he was widely described as the first player to make his professional debut at Wembley,\u201d mails Steve Lacey. Andrew writes in to say that Jordi made his Blackburn debut in their 2002 League Cup final win. \u201cHe was signed a few days earlier and came on for Matt Jansen.\u201d Richard Bourton has a brilliant example of someone who was thrown into the deep end and survived: \u201cNigel Spink for Aston Villa in the European Cup final against Bayern Munich in 1982!\u201d Spink replaced the injured Jimmy Rimmer after 10 minutes and kept a clean sheet in the 1-0 win. He had previously only played at non-league Chelmsford City.  Glenn Willmore writes: \u201cIn 1966 youngster Danny Campbell made his West Brom debut at centre-half in place of veteran Stan Jones (who had played in every game that season) in the League Cup final against West Ham. Albion won 5-3 on aggregate.\u201d And Ivor Leonard has another from the League Cup: \u201cGudni Bergsson made his debut for Bolton in the Coca-Cola Cup final against Liverpool in 1995. He replaced Scott Green. His first touch was an assist for Alan Thompson to score an absolute belter.\u201d And Mark Jameson wraps us up with the tragic tale of Reinhard \u201cMaecki\u201d Lauck, \u201cwho moved from Energie Cottbus to Union Berlin towards the end of the 1967-68 season and made his debut in the East German Cup final against Carl Zeiss Jena just 21 days later. Union ended up winning 2-1 and Lauck played a major role in the success, not least because he was a completely unknown quantity. Afterwards he made waves by moving to Union\u2019s hated rivals, the Stasi-run BFC Dynamo when Union were relegated in 1973. A year after that, and he marked Wolfgang Overath out of the game as East beat West at the 1974 World Cup. After retirement, he went back to work as a metalworker, fell on hard times with alcohol problems and was found bleeding from a head wound on the street in Berlin in 1997. He died two weeks later aged 51.\u201d Knowledge archive \u201cThe Comoros national team are known as the Coelacanths,\u201d wrote Robert Abushal in 2013. \u201cDo they have the most endangered nickname in world football?\u201d Certainly we should spare a thought for the Coelacanths, both the fish species currently listed as critically threatened on the International Union for Conservation of Nature list and the team at No 192 on Fifa\u2019s world rankings list. And, despite a lengthy trawl through the IUCN archives we\u2019re struggling to find any team nicknamed after a species so endangered.

                    "body": "Empty power-lust is a dispiriting spectacle. The array of contenders jostling for the hollow crown are a motley ship of fools or knaves, striving to outbid each other with fantasy policies and vast tax cuts that never count the cost. Downright chancers and jaw-dropping improbables stand alongside obscenely rich frontrunners with dubious tax records. None look likely to win back \u201cred wall\u201d seats, according to heavily negative polling in the Times: the better their name recognition, the more they are disliked, while only Keir Starmer has a positive score (with eight points). But real voters are not their target, as they woo their own MPs and 200,000 mainly male, white, elderly, southern members. Whoever wins, the result will plunge us into yet deeper austerity in this tax-cutting arms race egged on by the Tory press. Even \u201cmoderates\u201d are at it: Tom Tugendhat says \u201ctaxes, bluntly, are too high\u201d while Jeremy Hunt puts a \u00a339bn tax cut on the table. Former non-dom Sajid Javid, an Ayn Rand fan, has bid highest so far with a tax cut between \u00a347bn and \u00a352bn, or 2% of GDP, the Financial Times calculates. Rishi Sunak focuses on paying down debt rather than immediate tax cuts, rejecting the \u201ccomforting fairytales\u201d of his competitors. He\u2019s right that tax cuts won\u2019t yield more to the Treasury through supposed growth: it\u2019s the same unicorn economics as of the infamous Laffer curve, purporting to show taxing the rich less brings in more. It doesn\u2019t. No candidate explains why all those countries pulling away from us have higher taxes and better growth. The Resolution Foundation shows that the typical French household income rose by 34% in the decade to 2018 and Germany\u2019s was up by 23%, while lower-taxed UK households fell back by 2%. Cutting income tax does nothing for the poor who pay none, while VAT cuts boost spending among those who are better off, fuelling inflation. Cutting corporation tax in a race-to-the-bottom denies all countries vital revenue. Why reward businesses paying out high dividends to their shareholders while holding back on investment, which has tumbled 9.2% below pre-Covid levels? Only state spending can stop millions more falling into grievous penury. These would-be leaders never say which services they will sacrifice for their tax cuts: NHS, schools, courts, councils, care, defence, rail, benefits or children\u2019s services? But they will be asked. Paul Johnson, the IFS director, warns candidates \u201cneed to be clear about consequences\u201d as cuts \u201ccertainly mean big real terms cuts in public pay.\u201d They may idly boast of standing up to strikers, but nothing can stop the haemorrhaging of nurses and teachers to jobs with better pay elsewhere, when pay review bodies award way below a predicted 11% inflation. Here\u2019s the mystery. Why do any of them want it, at this worst possible time? Boris Johnson blabbed that the Queen wondered the same thing on his first audience with her. Leaving aside the smearing and stiletto-knifing in this nasty contest, the paradox is that any Tory seeking this poisoned plastic cup is almost by definition unsuited to the task. Either they don\u2019t understand what a dreadful state the country is in with every function of government dilapidated because of their own policies, or they don\u2019t much care. Power for what purpose? Being world king matters more. Sunak, in his glibly grinning Ready for Rishi video, does warn that ahead lie \u201cchallenges the most serious for a generation\u201d. But this Brexiter is one of those responsible for British household income growth having fallen behind all Europe bar Cyprus and Greece. On his watch Britain is now the most unequal country in all Europe, bar Bulgaria, as he cut back on universal credit and put nothing serious into levelling up. Javid knows the crippled state in which he left the NHS. Despite her patriotic \u201cI vow to thee my country\u201d promo video, Penny Mordaunt, the trade minister, knows the truth of our forlorn trade prospects, with an 8.3% trade deficit \u2013 the worst since 1955. Liz Truss knows her bill tearing up the Northern Ireland protocol is heading for an outright collision with the EU. But they all compete for the champion Brexiter cup.  Most of them eagerly served their disgraced leader, even as two ethics advisers resigned, but now they ooze with unctuous pledges of \u201chonesty\u201d and \u201cintegrity\u201d. No toe-curling videos promoting them as changed characters can wipe the stain away. Expect more shame to emerge as those departing Number 10 have Johnson stories to tell. Wait for his honours list. Wait for his own vengeful revelations about his successors. The battleground echoes with a medley of favourite old Tory tunes, but these may not get the voters singing along. Suella Braverman will \u201cmake Rwanda work\u201d, but how? Grant Shapps promises \u201cSingapore\u201d deregulation but never spells out on what: animal welfare, food safety, working rights, more sewage into rivers? Mordaunt clamours for increased defence spending, but from where? Abolish the net zero target some say \u2013 what a bleak future when none of them promote climate pledges. All these themes that tickle Tory members may not fly beyond the Carlton club. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s manifestos made more economic sense than these wild tax-and-spend cutters \u2013 they are the extremists now. Imagine the victor\u2019s dilemma, waking up at the helm of this sinking ship. Each face round the cabinet table heads a failing service to be cut yet deeper, either under tax cuts and/or under Sunak\u2019s needless debt repayments. A new leader can claim no \u201cclean break\u201d or \u201cfresh start\u201d when these Tories voted in every budget for 12 pernicious austerity years that stripped the public realm bare.

                    "body": "Welcome to Moving the Goalposts, the Guardian\u2019s new (and free) women\u2019s football newsletter. Here\u2019s an extract from this week\u2019s edition. To receive the full version once a week, just pop your email in below.  I will not have been the only one in recent weeks to have turned my eyes to the west coast of America as one of the most eagerly-awaited arrivals to the NWSL seized centre stage. On 20 March, Angel City FC finally took to the field at the Titan Stadium in California under the guidance of the head coach, Freya Coombe. They emerged to a raucous reception as they made their much-anticipated professional debut. From this side of the Atlantic too, and across the world, it has been hard not to get caught up in the enthusiasm. Since Natalie Portman and her star-studded board and investors were awarded expansion rights by the NWSL in July 2020, the interest in their efforts both on and off the pitch has continued to grow. As Coombe says, this distinctive group of more than 100 co-owners, two-thirds of whom are women, have added an energy to the project like no other: \u201cIt is incredible. Natalie Portman spoke to the whole team on our first day and really set the stage for what is being built here and showed the players that they are a part of something special from the outset.\u201d  The NWSL expansion draft is an alien concept to someone like me, a product of the English football system. But while the expansion process proves a test for any team, Coombe believes there are positives to the system that allows a project like Angel City to emerge. \u201cIt is an opportunity to write your own story,\u201d she says. \u201cAngel City is doing things so differently that never would have been possible with an established club. We are attracting new fans and sponsors and shedding a new light on the league as a whole.\u201d On the pitch, Coombe\u2019s side has come together in a flurry. Since November, they have quickly assembled a roster of players and staff to compete. The names are there, the most prominent of which is the LA-born Christen Press, but it will inevitably take time for the jigsaw to fall into place. The Challenge Cup, essentially a pre-season competition, provides the platform to do just that. While their start has been tricky \u2013 three losses and one draw \u2013 Coombe knows success will not happen overnight: \u201cWe have a journey ahead, but you can see that we are coming together as a cohesive unit. Every game we learn more and more.\u201d Perhaps where Angel City is most ground-breaking is its outreach work within the community. Their vast array of partners must commit 10% to local projects, aligning themselves with the organisation\u2019s vision. From delivering meals, to school gardening projects and community events, the club is setting new standards for the sport. In the meantime, however, focus will return to the pitch as the regular season approaches. Angel City will move into their new home, the 22,000-capacity Banc of California Stadium, for their NWSL opener against North Carolina Courage on 29 April. With 15,000 season tickets sold and six official supporter groups already established, the anticipation around the team is infectious.  \u201cSupporters planted the seed to bring an NWSL club to Los Angeles,\u201d says Coombe. \u201cThey showed up in incredible numbers at our first preseason Challenge Cup game and their support hasn\u2019t wavered \u2026 it\u2019s not just attendance. 465,000 watched our pre-season game against San Diego two weeks ago, which is the second highest viewership of any MLS or NWSL game in 2022. That shows that people are paying attention to what we are doing and want to be a part of Angel City history.\u201d I, along with many others, will be keeping a close eye on their progress. The interest and supporter numbers they have generated in a relatively short amount of time are truly remarkable. Talking points New era in North Macedonia: It has been a special year for the women\u2019s game there. On 8 March, the Football Federation of North Macedonia launched its first ever women\u2019s football strategy. Spearheaded by Ana Trajkova, its goals are to develop a competitive domestic league, increase awareness and develop national teams at both youth and senior levels. \u201cWe will do everything that we can to provide the best for women\u2019s football to go straight ahead and to make it sport No 1 for girls and women in our country,\u201d she says. Very much a young nation on the international stage \u2013 their first official senior match was in 2005 \u2013 the energy around the sport is palpable.  Bend It Like Beckham at 20: As a young girl, with little access to football, my contribution to the sport I loved was mainly in my dreams. That is why Bend It Like Beckham hit so close to home, providing visibility for many who had never seen themselves before in mainstream media. This iconic movie celebrates its 20th anniversary this week, a cinematic success that helped to shape a generation. But it wasn\u2019t only for the women\u2019s football narrative that it should be celebrated. It was in many ways ahead of its time. Steeped in humour, Gurinder Chadha\u2019s creation tackled many inequalities \u2013 sexism; racism; homophobia \u2013 throughout that we fight so passionately against today.

                    "body": "This pulsating tie was contested in a vibrant atmosphere and closed with Nottingham Forest ending Huddersfield\u2019s 18-game unbeaten run and claiming the prize of welcoming Liverpool here for a quarter-final.\nIt will be the first meeting between the teams in the FA Cup since the rescheduled semi-final tie in 1989 which was played at Old Trafford, following the tragic events at Hillsborough.\n\nAfter Forest defeated Arsenal and Leicester in previous rounds, J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team are in for a fight before what will be another raucous crowd here. For Steve Cooper, a former Liverpool youth team coach, and his side, the tie is just reward for emerging as worthy victors against opponents who took the lead.\nCooper believes his team can knock out the Premier League\u2019s second-placed side. \u201cWe go into every game thinking this but for me it\u2019s all about Reading on Saturday,\u201d the manager said. \u201cThe reason being because we are building a mentality here and it has to be about every day. I said to the players in the dressing room \u2013 enjoy this but then it\u2019s Reading.\u201d\nForest are ninth in the Championship, three points from a play-off berth, as Cooper bids to restore them to the top flight for the first time since 1999. This is a club with a proud history that boasts one league title, two consecutive European Cup triumphs, four League Cup wins and two FA Cup triumphs \u2013 in 1898 and 1959.\nIn the bid for a third, Forest threatened Jamal Blackman\u2019s goal first via a Sam Surridge shot. This was deflected and while James Garner\u2019s corner yielded nothing the latter, on loan from Manchester United, was a class act. A swivelling turn that ended with the midfielder unloading at Blackman, who gathered, was his next contribution as Cooper\u2019s men were a blur of attacking intent, dabbing the ball about impressively.\nSurridge, on his full debut after signing in January, beat Blackman. It was ruled offside and though it appeared a legal strike, as there was no VAR in play a second look was not possible. So far, all Forest but Huddersfield scored via a cute corner routine. Taken from the right, it featured a phalanx of players grouping beyond the far post who acted as a decoy; when Danel Sinani hit the ball in, Tom Lees found space at the near post and headed home. Cue delirium from the travelling support, the strike a body blow Forest had to respond to. They did \u2013 supremely as, first, along their right, Garner and Djed Spence punched in balls that those in navy blue scrambled to repel.\n\nCarlos Corber\u00e1n, formerly Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s first-team coach at Leeds, has fashioned Huddersfield into a high-pressing team and it had Forest penned in at times, having to move the ball around slickly to escape, and this smoothness was evident in their excellent equaliser. The ball went upfield quickly, suddenly Ryan Yates was inside Huddersfield\u2019s area and, when Naby Sarr tackled him, there was Surridge to rocket home.\nIt had the City Ground bouncing, the wall of noise invigorating. Huddersfield should have again pushed ahead when Carel Eiting blazed at Ethan Horvath\u2019s goal but hit a post and as Duane Holmes tried to scoop in the rebound Forest\u2019s keeper leaped from the turf to save.\nBreathlessly, the entertainment moved on via an instalment that had Forest taking the lead: Surridge claimed a free-kick along the left, Garner lifted it into the area and Yates rose to head beyond Blackman.\n\nAt the break Forest knew if they held on for the next 45 minutes Liverpool would be next. The teams continued to hurtle at each other \u2013 a home move claiming a free-kick that Garner again delivered from the left but Forest could not apply the finish.\nMoments later Spence seemed poised to test Blackman but Harry Toffolo made the vital challenge. Cooper, in the technical area, was a fidgeting image of nerves while Corber\u00e1n was cooler, trusting his team to create something. A Sinani free-kick was one chance but Horvath was able to beat it away and Forest escaped. Danny Ward hit another dead ball around the wall but Horvath, diving right, again saved.\n\nAt the other end, heart rates quickened when Spence had a golden chance to kill Huddersfield off but his attempt flew skywards. It was not costly: Forest ended in pell-mell mode, launching raids that stifled any threat of a late equaliser and extra time.\n\u2022 This article was amended on 8 March 2022 to give 1959 as Forest\u2019s second FA Cup win rather than 1958."

                    "body": "Gas users and the incoming government are describing Australia\u2019s sudden east coast energy crisis as \u201capocalyptic\u201d and \u201ca perfect storm\u201d. There is no doubt that a rare combination of international and domestic events, together with long-term policy shortcomings, have led to a very nasty position from which there is no easy way out. Four events have led to the immediate crisis. 1. Coal-fired generators have been failing First, outages at coal-fired power stations have meant that gas has been called on more than usual. More than one quarter of coal-fired plants have been offline for much of the year so far, which is far from usual. The system is designed so that when that happens, gas generators take their place.  2. Australia is running low on gas Second, the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) has been warning of gas supply shortages in the south-east for some time as traditional gas resources, mainly in offshore Victoria, run low. Onshore gas development in Victoria has been prevented by a succession of state government decisions, and input terminals have been either rejected on environmental grounds or delayed due to financial barriers. In 2012 the Gillard government rejected the idea of reserving a certain proportion for domestic consumption, as happens in Western Australia. The history of cheap and plentiful gas in Victoria has made Victorian households and firms more dependent on gas than other Australians, and there has been little move towards electrification. 3. Europe wants non-Russian gas Third, in their desperation to reduce their dependence on piped Russian gas, European countries have been pushing the international price of liquefied natural gas sky-high, buying from countries such as Australia, Qatar and the United States. Some Australian exporters have received prices four or more times higher than normal. 4. Suddenly, there\u2019s a cold snap Finally, a cold snap on Australia\u2019s east coast has brought forward the winter spike in demand for gas for heating. The immediate impact of the combination of these four events has been a looming shortage of gas on the east coast, including gas to supply power stations. Industrial gas consumers who do not have the protection of a fixed contract are facing potentially destructive prices. Thankfully there is no immediate price impact for households using gas, as their retailers have gas supply contracts, although many households are suffering higher electricity prices because gas-fired power stations have had to be pushed into service to replace coal-fired stations.  Quick actions AEMO has taken action, partly by imposing a wholesale price cap of $40 per gigajoule ahead of forecasts the spot price in Victoria was set to climb $382. The \u201cshadow price\u201d used to indicate what would have happened were it not for the cap, hit $800 on Tuesday. And AEMO has triggered the so-called Gas Supply Guarantee Mechanism to secure gas for power generators. These actions have worked, even though a price of $40 per gigajoule is financially crippling for large industrial consumers, and AEMO cannot magically source gas that isn\u2019t there. But no overnight answer Chris Bowen, the new minister for climate change and energy, is already working closely with AEMO and his state and territory counterparts and industry to get complete information and advice. But as the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said on Tuesday, there\u2019s no overnight answer. The Turnbull government introduced the Australian Domestic Gas Security Mechanism in 2017 in response to concerns that exports of liquefied natural gas from Queensland might one day create domestic shortages. It was also concerned that gas producers were selling gas overseas at lower prices than they were asking for at home. The threat of government intervention has generally ensured supply. But the mechanism is unlikely to be effective in addressing the current problem, for two reasons. First, there are physical limits on getting gas awaiting export in Queensland to Victoria where it is needed. And second, to the frustration of many gas customers, the mechanism can\u2019t bring down prices, which are set internationally. It deals only with supply. Thankfully, no false promises The current crisis illustrates the fundamental policy connection between electricity supply, gas markets and climate change. The decision to immediately convene a meeting of the national energy and resources ministers and the relevant agencies is the right first step, but only the beginning of a journey that will involve urgent and sustained reforms to the way Australia\u2019s markets work. The new government has indeed come to power in the face of a perfect storm, and there are more challenges ahead. Its approach so far has been constructive, measured and cooperative \u2013 and it has resisted the temptation to make promises it can\u2019t keep. It is to be hoped that this new approach will enable it to navigate through to what will almost certainly be somewhat calmer waters ahead. \u2022 Tony Wood is the program director for energy at the Grattan Institute.

                    "body": "Innovation in rugby tends to divide people into two camps. The purists prefer their game to remain gloriously unchanged while casual fans are more open to proactive experimentation. Rare indeed are those \u201cunicorn\u201d moments when both tribes are happy and something feels so immediately right it should have happened years ago.\n\nEuropean club rugby, either way, is entering a new era. This weekend will bring the introduction of a two-leg \u201cround of 16\u201d in the Champions Cup and, as yet, there is barely a dissenting voice to be heard. Because if you are, for example, a Munster fan, the best of both worlds awaits: a tantalising away trip to England followed by the thunderous hum of a major Thomond Park rematch a week later. Looking forward to it? Of course you are.\nIn the case of Bordeaux and La Rochelle a spicy triple\u2011header is already under way. On Saturday, Bordeaux\u2019s head coach, Christophe Urios, had a touchline spat with his La Rochelle counterpart, Ronan O\u2019Gara, and was quoted in the French press as using the word \u201cunbearable\u201d to describe the Irishman. Let\u2019s just say the pot is already bubbling furiously with another two parts of the trilogy still to unfold.\nFootball has been following this model for years. Judging by the profile of the Champions League, it would seem to be working pretty well. The only potential snag, the curse of further Covid disruption aside, is rugby\u2019s scoring system. If a home team go down, say, 31-21 to an 80th-minute interception try in an otherwise tight first leg, clawing back a 10-point deficit on away soil the following week will be a daunting assignment.\nBut think of the array of possible scenarios. Let\u2019s say Exeter are leading Munster by a point this Saturday with 10 minutes to go. What do they do next? No longer can sides who take an early lead sit back and park the bus. If they do, one tiny fumble could change everything. Instead, the potential to take an eight-point lead to Limerick will keep everyone at full tilt right up until the 80th minute. At which point there will still be another 80 minutes to negotiate \u2026\n\nStylistically, the new dynamic will also be fascinating. Do teams keep some tactical ploys under wraps in the first leg? Or simply seek to blitz their opponents with three tries in the first 20 minutes to kill the tie off as early as possible? Will they kick more away from home and opt for damage limitation? Or will the revised tournament structure play into the hands of the stronger French and Irish sides, with their superior squad depth?\nHome advantage will have to be maximised to the full. Take the opening tie in Galway on Friday. Leinster have played there as recently as last Saturday week, winning 45-8. But Connacht had a player sent off within three minutes, significantly skewing the outcome. While Leinster will be turning up with their Ireland internationals this time, so will their hosts.\nConnacht have beaten Stade Fran\u00e7ais 36-9 this season and lost by the odd point to the runaway English league leaders, Leicester. What if Leinster suddenly find themselves dealing with an early red card and a stiff Sportsgrounds wind in their faces?\n\nIn theory, they should have the squad depth to stay on course if the first leg is an unscheduled disaster. But from almost every perspective \u2013 coaching, playing and spectating \u2013 there are fresh dynamics at play. The idea should have been a feature of last year\u2019s competition, only for Covid to ruin the plan, and the sudden-death element adds a further edge. No \u201caway goals\u201d count here, with extra time to be played if the aggregate score is level after 160 minutes.\nWill familiarity, in some cases, breed contempt? Bristol, for example, beat Sale 32-15 at Ashton Gate as recently as January. Since then, though, the Bears have been looking defensively porous. Which makes a two-leg tie extremely hard to call. If any side can cut loose and alter the complexion of a tie inside 15 minutes it is Pat Lam\u2019s team.\nIt will also test the ability of one or two French sides to perform two weeks in a row. Montpellier, Clermont and Toulouse will fancy flexing their muscles at home and defeating Harlequins, Leicester and Ulster respectively. But will the margins be sufficient to protect them on their travels the following weekend? Look down the list of games and how many likely home-and-away double bankers do you see? Two or three out of eight, at most.\n\nIn all the other subplots \u2013 not least the Parisian \u201cderby\u201d between two clubs who came close to merging not long ago \u2013 there is also the tennis-style draw that makes it impossible for probably the two title favourites, Racing 92 and Leinster, to meet before the final.\nFor all France\u2019s grand slam heroics in the Six Nations, it is by no means impossible that three of the quarter-finals could take place on English or Irish soil. Should Bordeaux and Toulouse progress, for example, they may well have to travel in the last eight and Leinster, having had their pool game in Toulouse controversially postponed, could end up going to Welford Road if Leicester edge out Clermont.\nThat is not to say an English side is set fair to hoist the trophy. The Premiership has been a slightly mixed bag this season and Harlequins, Leicester and Exeter will do well to make the last four, never mind the final. But therein lies the beauty of the Champions Cup this year. No one can be entirely sure how the redesigned cards are going to fall.\n\nThis is an extract from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

Germany\u2019s energy minister, Robert Habeck, on Tuesday morning instructed the withdrawal of a security-of-supply assessment granted under Angela Merkel\u2019s tenure, which is required to authorise the pipeline between Russia and Germany. \u201cThis may sound technical, but it is the necessary administrative step without which the pipeline cannot be certified,\u201d Scholz said at a press conference in Berlin at midday. \u201cWithout this certification Nord Stream 2 cannot go into operation\u201d. Scholz said he has commissioned a new assessment into Germany\u2019s energy security in light of geopolitical developments in east Ukraine.  The German leader described Putin\u2019s recognition of the Russian-controlled territories as a \u201cgrave breach\u201d of international law that broke with decades of agreements between Russia and the west. \u201cThe situation today is fundamentally different,\u201d he said. Scholz\u2019s announcement was welcomed in Kyiv, where the foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said suspending the pipeline\u2019s certification was \u201ca morally, politically and practically correct step in the current circumstances\u201d. \u201cTrue leadership means tough decisions in difficult times,\u201d Kuleba tweeted. \u201cGermany\u2019s move proves just that.\u201d The decision drew condemnation and threats from Moscow, where the former Russian president and deputy chair of Russia\u2019s security council Dmitry Medvedev tweeted: \u201cWelcome to the brave new world where Europeans are very soon going to pay \u20ac2.000 for 1.000 cubic metres of natural gas!\u201d First announced in 2015, the $11bn (\u00a38.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia\u2019s state-backed energy giant Gazprom has been built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany\u2019s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. The construction of the pipeline was completed last September and its operator says it is already filled with gas and ready to go into use, pending permission from German authorities. Scholz, a Social Democrat who was sworn in as German chancellor last December, skirted around the Nord Stream 2 debate in the first weeks of his tenure, with his spokespeople initially sticking to the line that the pipeline was a purely commercial project. As tensions heightened on Ukraine\u2019s border with Russia, Scholz said that \u201call options are on the table\u201d when it came to sanctions against a possible incursion, but refrained from naming Nord Stream \u2013 until now. Even though German attitudes towards Russia are ambivalent, not just among the wider population but among most of the parties in the Bundestag, Putin\u2019s actions on Monday were widely condemned across the political spectrum. The leader of the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Friedrich Merz, called the Russian president \u201ca warmonger with no inhibitions\u201d against whom the west had to show a united front. \u201cOur outstretched hand has been batted away,\u201d said Lars Klingbeil, the SPD\u2019s co-leader and a former protege of the former chancellor and Gazprom lobbyist Gerhard Schr\u00f6der. \u201cPutin has crossed a line.\u201d The leadership of the leftwing party Die Linke also issued a statement condemning Russia\u2019s recognition of the self-proclaimed republics: \u201cThis is certainly not a \u2018peace mission\u2019, it violates international and Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity and heightens the risk of a great war in Europe.\u201d Only the far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) struck a different note. While its co-chair Tino Chrupalla said he saw Russian behaviour \u201cabsolutely in critical terms\u201d, his party rejected any sanctions against Russia as harmful to Germany\u2019s own interests. The Nord Stream 2 pipeline is an important project for both the Russian and German economies. Gas and oil make up more than 50% of Russia\u2019s exports. In Germany, about a quarter of the country\u2019s energy supply relies on gas, of which half is provided by Russia. While Europe\u2019s largest economy is planning to wean itself off fossil fuels and achieve carbon neutrality in 25 years\u2019 time, gas remains a vital bridging technology on that path. Asked on Tuesday how he sought to end Germany\u2019s reliance on Russian gas in the medium term, Scholz declined to give precise answers. The challenge of diversifying energy supplies was a \u201cmajor European task\u201d, he said. Original plans for Nord Stream 2 included 90% of gas piped into Germany being distributed on to eastern and southern Europe. Norway and the Netherlands, the two other major suppliers of natural gas to Germany, have already signalled that they won\u2019t be able to significantly increase their supplies. Since Germany does not have its own import terminal for liquified gas, which is transported by ship rather than through pipelines, there are also questions about whether demand can be met through emergency supplies from the US or Qatar. Habeck, of the Green party, said on Tuesday his country\u2019s energy needs were guaranteed to be met, but that he expected the conflict in eastern Ukraine to lead to a further rise in gas prices."

                    "body": "A ceasefire between Israel and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the second-largest militant group in the Gaza Strip, appeared to be holding this week, ending three days of cross-border fighting that killed dozens of Palestinians. In Rafah, the desert town at the intersection of the Gaza Strip, Israel and Egypt, a stream of empty Palestinian petrol tankers and flatbed trucks rumbled through the border gate towards the Israeli crossing for commercial goods; after a week of tensions, the return of fresh produce and fuel to the besieged territory was welcome. The weekend\u2019s surprise Israeli airstrikes, codenamed Operation Breaking Dawn, marked the sixth round of fighting between Gaza\u2019s militant groups and Israel since Hamas took over the strip in 2007, and the worst episode of violence in the coastal enclave since an 11-day war last May. The bloodshed did not escalate into another all-out conflict, however, owing to a major gamble: that Hamas would resist being drawn into the fray. The bet paid off handsomely for Israel\u2019s caretaker prime minister, Yair Lapid, who is enjoying a bounce in the polls before the country holds its fifth tightly contested election in less than four years this November. Islamic Jihad fired at least 1,000 rockets into southern Israel in retaliation for what Israel described as a \u201cpre-emptive\u201d offensive to thwart a planned major attack by the militant group before Egypt and Qatar brokered a ceasefire on Sunday night. Before then, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) managed to kill two senior Islamic Jihad commanders, on top of arresting another, Bassam al-Saadi, in the occupied West Bank city of Jenin last week. Saadi\u2019s arrest sparked the current tensions. Sixty people in Israel suffered minor injuries, but the majority of Islamic Jihad\u2019s projectiles were intercepted by the Iron Dome missile defence system, leading Israel\u2019s defence establishment to hail the operation as a major success, and boosting the credentials of centrist Lapid, a former television show host. As ever, the toll in Gaza was much greater. According to the local authorities, 47 Palestinians, among them 16 children, were killed, 360 people were injured, and more than 650 housing units were damaged over three days. Though Hamas issued statements announcing its support for Islamic Jihad, it refrained from intervening. As a social movement and de facto government responsible for the strip\u2019s 2.2 million people, Hamas has less room to manoeuvre than Islamic Jihad, which is backed directly by Iran and focusses solely on armed resistance to Israel. Hamas is also still recovering from the 2021 war, and not ready for a new round of conflict. The group is loath to give Israel a reason to cancel the 14,000 Israeli work permits issued for Gaza since last year, or shut down the more consistent supply of electricity that currently reaches the strip\u2019s sole power plant; both measures have made small but significant improvements to quality of life for the area\u2019s impoverished population. In an interview in his office in Gaza City on Tuesday, Basem Naim, head of Hamas\u2019 political division, dismissed reports of friction between the two groups after Breaking Dawn.  \u201cThe leadership of Hamas and Jihad works together. Many Palestinian factions are present in Gaza and we don\u2019t see them as rivals \u2026 Some are Islamist, some are Communist, but we have the same goal, which is to get rid of the occupation,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe they were in the front, and we stayed at the back, but we didn\u2019t leave Jihad to stand alone. It was not in our interest to escalate this time; this is one battle of many. Responses must be weighed against many complex factors.\u201d The Israeli operation had been calculated to serve domestic political ends, he added. \u201cNegotiations with Israel over prisoners [including Bassam al-Saadi, the Islamic Jihad commander arrested in the West Bank] were continuing right up until an hour before the Israeli attack started \u2026 Jihad fired rockets at Israel last month and there was no response. So while we are not surprised by any Israeli aggression, we did not expect it now in this form, assassinating Jihad leaders.\u201d Commenting on Naim\u2019s claim, spokesperson for the Israeli embassy in London, Ohad Zemet, said: \u201cThe operation started in order to eliminate imminent and concrete threats by the Islamic Jihad terrorist organisation. There are clear statements from senior Islamic Jihad officials issuing those threats, supported by their actions on the ground.\u201d Citing army sources, local media reported on Wednesday that Islamic Jihad had planned anti-tank missiles at cars in Israeli in retaliation for Saadi\u2019s arrest. On the Palestinian street, it is not yet clear what impact the fighting has had on Islamic Jihad\u2019s popularity. At a mosque in Gaza City known to be affiliated with the group, several worshippers said the recent fighting and the strip\u2019s dire economic situation, would continue to strengthen the movement\u2019s public support. But in Rafah, where an airstrike killed Islamic Jihad commander Khaled Mansour, two more fighters and five civilians, the mood was more hostile. Mohammed Moussa, a nurse at a small hospital in the town, said the facility struggled to cope with the aftermath of the Israeli attack on Saturday. There were only seven empty beds available for 48 injured people, and a 14-year-old boy had died of preventable causes because staff could not treat him in time. \u201cIslamic Jihad support here has declined after this round of fighting. People are looking at their capabilities compared with Hamas, and there\u2019s no competition,\u201d said a local man who gave his name as Khaled. \u201cI saw some Islamic Jihad supporters after the Israelis killed Mansour, and I told them, \u2018You are losers; you handed the guy to the occupation, and you didn\u2019t say anything, you didn\u2019t do anything, you just shed tears.\u2019\u201d Few expect that negotiations with Israel after the latest fighting will significantly change the status quo in the Gaza Strip, where the 15-year-old Israeli-Egyptian blockade has left about 50% of the population unemployed and turned electricity and clean water into scarce commodities. Peace talks are nonexistent, and the next flare-up is never too far away. \u201cIt\u2019s not the first time we have had to deal with something like this,\u201d said Mousa, the Rafah nurse. \u201cYou just have to keep going.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 11 August 2022 to correct a misspelling of Yair Lapid\u2019s name."

                    "body": "  1.07pm    That\u2019s it for today. Thanks for your company, your emails, your questions and your statgasms. Taha Hashim and Tim de Lisle will be with you tomorrow. Merry Christmas!      12.35pm    Harry Brook speaks  Yeah I\u2019m feeling good at the minute; hopefully it continues. I\u2019ve scored a lot of runs in certain areas and I kind of stick to that. I feel like I\u2019ve been quick on my feet against spin which has helped. I don\u2019t know how much seam I\u2019ve faced \u2013 the majority of my batting has been against spin and I feel very confident against that out here. I squat down a bit which I think helps me [read length], especially for that pick-up shot over midwicket. Staying low, trying to see the flight of the ball\u2026 Nauman Ali was actually quite hard to face on there, he was doing me in length a few times, I didn\u2019t feel like I could get back to him. But Abrar, I felt like if he dropped it short it was easy pickings really. [On getting low] I\u2019ve tried to take bits of the best players in the world and put it in my game. I watched a lot of AB de Villiers and seen the way he plays spin; quite a bit of his technical side has gone into my game.  [On Ben Stokes\u2019 run-out] I thought I was out. Thankfully I got my bat in before his foot\u2026 I don\u2019t know whether to say thankfully or not!      12.29pm    \u201cWhen did England last open the bowling with three spinners?\u201d asks Colin Burgess. \u201cPerhaps on an Adelaide sticky?\u201d Great question. I\u2019d need to check to be sure, but I think it was Malcolm Hilton, Roy Tattersall and Jack Robertson at Kanpur on 13 January 1952.     12.24pm    By the standards of this series that was a relatively quiet day, yet there were still 368 runs scored. The highlight was another swaggering century from Harry Brook, who ignored his part in the run-out of his captain Ben Stokes to smack 111 from 150 balls.  Abrar Ahmed and Nauman Ali took four wickets apiece, and they will fancy their chances of bowling Pakistan to victory in the fourth innings. All will be revealed in the next day or two.  Updated at 12.26pm GMT    12.22pm   Close of play  9th over: Pakistan 21-0 (Shafique 14, Masood 3) For the first time in the series, we\u2019ve had the full allocation of overs. Leach bowls the last, and Shafique drags the penultimate delivery round the corner for four. A no-ball \u2013 the cardinal sin! \u2013 means Pakistan will be 29 runs behind when they resume in the morning.     12.20pm    8th over: Pakistan 16-0 (Shafique 10, Masood 3) Shafique works Rehan Ahmed round the corner for a couple to move into double figures, then gets three leg byes after being hit outside leg stump by a googly.  The last ball is a grubber that Masood defends off the back foot. This pitch is a bit odd, both unhelpful to the bowlers and untrustworthy to the batsmen.     12.15pm    7th over: Pakistan 11-0 (Shafique 8, Masood 3) Shafique works a single off Leach, which allows England to crowd the left-handed Masood: slip, leg slip, silly point, short midwicket. He looks solid in defence, though, and the rest of the over passes without incident.     12.12pm    6th over: Pakistan 10-0 (Shafique 7, Masood 3) Rehan Ahmed replaces Root, a clever move with Pakistan essentially batting for the close. Shan Masood chases a wider delivery and is beaten on the cut, and Rehan starts with a maiden. Three overs to go. \u201cRe: the looming middle-order issue. Anyone got thoughts on Stokes opening?\u201d says David Brook. \u201cI don\u2019t think he would say no.\u201d I reckon even he might think that\u2019s going too far, especially as his mind is so active when he\u2019s in the field. Personally I think the top three, certainly the top two, need to be seen as a separate department: no promoting Bairstow/Brook/Stokes, no funky stuff. But I appreciate that is a very old-fashioned (ie, 2021) attitude.  Updated at 12.13pm GMT    12.09pm    5th over: Pakistan 10-0 (Shafique 7, Masood 3) Leach bits Shafique with a ripper that drifts in and then bursts past the outside edge. Some spinners hate bowling with the new ball but Leach looks like he enjoys it, and he\u2019s started well here: his figures are 3-2-1-0.     12.06pm    4th over: Pakistan 9-0 (Shafique 7, Masood 2) I\u2019ll be honest, not much is happening. Shafique skips down to lift Root over midwicket for the first boundary of the innings; that\u2019s about it. I\u2019d be very tempted to bring on Rehan Ahmed at Root\u2019s end.     12.01pm    3rd over: Pakistan 3-0 (Shafique 2, Masood 1) Leach to Masood, with a slip and leg slip. There\u2019s a bit of turn, though nothing that should unnerve the batters. Masood is able to play out a maiden without alarm. The early signs are that Pakistan are going to bat for the close and worry about run-scoring the morn.     11.59am    2nd over: Pakistan 3-0 (Shafique 2, Masood 1) For the second time in his Test career, Joe Root takes the new ball. (The first was during that farce at Ahmedabad last year.) He goes around the wicket to the right-handed Shafique, who flicks crisply through midwicket for two. \u201cThis is going to be another four-dayer, isn\u2019t it?\u201d says John Starbuck. \u201cGot your Christmas planned out yet?\u201d The World Cup and this series have been so consuming that I haven\u2019t even thought about Christmas. Happily, I\u2019m off after today so I\u2019m treating it as a two-day Test. (And yes, yes it is going to be another four-dayer; might even finish tomorrow, though I doubt it.)  Updated at 11.59am GMT    11.55am    1st over: Pakistan 0-0 (Shafique 0, Masood 0) Shafique survives a big LBW appeal off the fourth ball when he pushes around his front pad at Leach. It was close but didn\u2019t straighten quite enough and would have missed leg stump. A good start from Leach, a maiden.     11.52am    Here we go. Nine overs remaining, light permitting, and Jack Leach has the new ball.     11.44am    Meanwhile, at the Gabbatoir      11.43am    \u201cCricket does indeed have a range of challenges and possibilities,\u201d writes Michael, \u201cbut it also has the phenomenon of \u2018flat-track bullies\u2019 (a phrase that is hijacked by other sports).\u201d That\u2019s a good thing though, right? Sorts the great from the good, etc.     11.43am   WICKET! England 354 all out (Robinson b Abrar 29)  Abrarcadabra. Pakistan take the new ball, and Abrar picks up the last wicket inside four deliveries. The ball after being reverse swept for four, he skids a lovely delivery straight through Ollie Robinson. Abrar finishes with four for 150, Robinson goes for a breezy 20-ball 29, and England have a lead of 50. There are nine overs remaining tonight.     11.39am    80th over: England 349-9 (Robinson 25, Leach 8) Robinson moves to 25 from 18 balls by reverse-sweeping Nauman delicately for four. England have now scored more than 200 runs since losing their fifth wicket, a terrific effort and not the first time the lower order has fought back since Baz and Ben took over. \u201cMystery spinner v a tailender who has no idea what\u2019s going on?\u201d says James Walsh. \u201cStokes might not be a fan, but I could watch this for hours.\u201d I don\u2019t know whether Warnie counts as a mystery spinner or just a freakish genius, but this never gets old.      11.35am    79th over: England 341-9 (Robinson 18, Leach 7) Abrar beats Robinson with a nice googly that kicks off the pitch. Robinson\u2019s response is to get down on one knee and heave a sweep for four, as if on auto-pilot. Later in the over Leach edges short of slip, not once but twice. He\u2019s had enough of that orthodox endeavour, so he mows a reverse sweep for four. \u201cIf The Darkness is to be mentioned,\u201d says Ian Copestake, \u201callow me to prompt your other reader to Justin Hawkins Rides Again on YouTube. Is very winning and informative on music, fame and rock.\u201d That\u2019s not the one with the BBC commentary from 1992 dubbed over the top is it?     11.31am    79th over: England 330-9 (Robinson 13, Leach 1) Robinson paddles Nauman round the corner for a couple. He\u2019s been a bit of a disappointment as a Test batter, with his average only just in double figures, though his bowling has more than made up for it.     11.28am    78th over: England 327-9 (Robinson 10, Leach 1) Leach bowled Abrar with a jaffa this time last night, and Abrar almost pays him back with a lovely delivery that misses the off stump by this much. The next two deliveries beat the outside edge as well. I\u2019ve no idea how Leach survived that over, not a solitary scooby. \u201cI\u2019m not sure Phil Russell did take his idea to its logical conclusion,\u201d says Brad McMillan. \u201cHad he done so, instead of the baseball analogy, he\u2019d have gone down the NFL route and suggested completely different batting and fielding units.\u201cI expect you to (rightly) despise the idea, but its thrown up an interesting question in my mind: in NFL parlance the two units would be known as \u2018offence\u2019 and \u2018defence\u2019, so which of these would batting and fielding be?\u201d For this England team they\u2019d probably be \u2018offence 1\u2019 and \u2018offence 2\u2019. Or maybe \u2018shock\u2019 and \u2018awe\u2019.     11.25am    77th over: England 326-9 (Robinson 9, Leach 1) This has turned out quite well for England, who should have an hour or so at the Pakistan openers tonight.      11.23am   WICKET! England 324-9 (Foakes c Shafique b Nauman 64)  Ben Foakes charges the new bowler Nauman Ali and fetches the ball high towards mid-on, where Shafique runs round to take a comfortable catch. That was a good innings from Foakes, which helped turn a big deficit into a slender lead. Back to the earlier subject of Christmas songs. \u201c\u201cWhat about the Darkness hit,\u201d says Mike Speke. \u201cChristmas Time (Don\u2019t let the Wickets fall) or something like that.\u201d   Updated at 11.24am GMT    11.19am    76th over: England 324-8 (Foakes 64, Robinson 8) Ollie Robinson slogs two of his first three balls for four, and why not. \u201cI met Brian Close once,\u201d says Ian Copestake, \u201cthough when I say \u2018met\u2019 I mean I watched on as a fellow lackey security guard at Headingley asked him for his ID before he would let him in the members\u2019 stand. You should have seen the great man\u2019s face!\u201d I bet the words coming out of his face were interesting. In fact, I hear he unwittingly coined a portmanteau for this afternoon\u2019s partnership between Ben Foakes and Harry Brook.  Updated at 11.22am GMT    11.16am   WICKET! England 316-8 (Wood c Shafique b Abrar 35)  This is a terrific catch. Wood tried to chip Abrar over midwicket, where Abdullah Shafique leapt to take a nonchalant one-handed catch. Wood goes for a perky \u2013 NOT THE KLAXON, PLEASE \u2013 35 from 41 balls.     11.14am    75th over: England 316-7 (Foakes 64, Wood 35) Wood flicks a full toss from Wasim behind square for four, which also brings up a jaunty fifty partnership from only 57 balls. Pakistan are going through the motions.   \u201cI can\u2019t help feeling Stokes is not a fan of watching tail-enders from either side bat,\u201d says Phil Russell. \u201cVery much a hit-out-or-get-out approach so we can move the game on, and if there is a first innings deficit, well that\u2019s what the second innings is for. \u201cTaking that to its logical conclusion, I wonder how long we have to wait until the introduction of a \u2018designated batter\u2019 role where each team nominates a player to drop out of the batting line up in place of a specialist batter who doesn\u2019t field? \u201cBenefits would include Foakes not needing to worry about his place and Jimmy going on for even longer. Just a shame it will happen too late for Inzamam.\u201d Please don\u2019t give the ICC ideas.     11.09am    74th over: England 308-7 (Foakes 61, Wood 30) Abrar is mowed over midwicket for four by Wood, whose breezy innings has taken England into the lead. This is a cracking recovery from 145 for five. \u201cThanks for posting the Waqar clip a few overs back,\u201d says Bernard Hughes, \u201cwhich as well as reminding us of his genius, was a less enjoyable reminder of how terrible the BBC TV commentary was in those days\u2026\u201d Ah, I had it on silent. Please don\u2019t tell me somebody has dubbed Dennis Pennis over it again? (Actually, I\u2019ve just listened to it now \u2013 it\u2019s really good! That\u2019s Jack Bannister and Richie Benaud! Richie\u2019s emphasis on \u2018Well bowled\u2019 when Waqar cleans up Graeme Hick is great, IMO.)     11.02am    73rd over: England 300-7 (Foakes 60, Wood 23) It\u2019s a fairly quiet period, though these things are relative \u2013 Wood and Foakes are still scoring at four and a half per over. Foakes drives Wasim pleasantly down the ground for four to bring up the 300. He has a terrific record in Asia, with an average of 46 from seven Tests \u2013 and that includes three games on rancid turners in India last year. \u201cRehan made one more run than Brian Close managed on youthful debut,\u201d writes Tim Sanders. \u201cCredit to both players though, in that both were caught going unselfishly for quick runs. Back in 1949, it was because the match and series situation demanded it; in 2022 it\u2019s more a matter of general policy.\u201d The memory on you!  Updated at 11.04am GMT    10.57am    72nd over: England 294-7 (Foakes 55, Wood 22) Abrar Ahmed replaces Nauman Ali, who has very modern figures of 27-1-113-3. He beats Foakes with a beautiful delivery that dips and then skids past the outside edge. \u201cThat you (and I) can hedge an appreciation of a giant new talent like Harry Brook with a version of \u2018Can he do it on a wet night at Stoke?\u2019 and it being an entirely reasonable position to take, underlines Test cricket\u2019s range of possibilities,\u201d says Gary Naylor. \u201cOther sports have specialists for certain disciplines (eg track cyclists, classics riders and Grands Tours contenders) but is cricket the only one that sets so many challenges to its would-be greats? I think so.\u201d That\u2019s a terrific point. Tennis has different surfaces but I\u2019m a casual fan at best so I don\u2019t know how the challenges compare to cricket. I suppose cricket has different surfaces and formats, which is relevant just to Tests because there will be times when Brook has to jump from white-ball to red-ball and vice versa. Not that it makes a huge difference to his approach.     10.52am    71st over: England 292-7 (Foakes 54, Wood 21) Wood digs out an inswinging yorker from Mohammad Wasim, then pulls to deep midwicket for a single. Another for Foakes means England are 12 runs behind. \u201cA week out from Christmas, Rob, and England have a new batting superstar and are playing a brand of Test cricket from the future,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cAnd it\u2019s the football World Cup final this afternoon. Thank God, or whoever, for sport, eh? Especially in the bleak midwinter. What a (sleigh) ride. Merry Christmas everyone!\u201d Yeah, merry Christmas.      10.47am    70th over: England 290-7 (Foakes 53, Wood 20) After a couple of games of bat-first dominance, it looks like England are going to have another interesting fourth-innings runchase. I\u2019d make Pakistan slight favourites, though I thought England would lose most of their games last summer at one stage or another. Wood moves into double figures with a slog-swept boundary off Nauman. He\u2019s a very handy lower-order hitter, with a Test average of 16 and a strike rate in the high sixties, and he carts another slog sweep to the fence later in the over. A pair of twos take him into the twenties. His unbeaten 36 in the first innings at Multan ultimately won the game for England, and these could have a similar impact. \u201cWorth pointing out that this Pakistani attack is not exactly overladen with talent and Babar Azam has not been very proactive,\u201d says Rob Lewis. \u201cApart from two overs, only three bowlers have been used in this innings, and for all the fanfare, the one who has bowled most, Abrar, is still only in his second Test. Still, Brook has been magnificent in this series.\u201d Yes, fair points. Pakistan are missing some extremely good bowlers, but then you can only score runs against what\u2019s in front of yo- CAN YOU PLEASE TURN THAT BLOODY KLAXON OFF.     10.44am    69th over: England 278-7 (Foakes 53, Wood 8) Mohammad Wasim is bowling full and straight, trying to maximise any reverse swing. It\u2019s moving a little bit, around 3.4 on the Waqarometer (this is 10.0), and there\u2019s just one run from the over. \u201cJust wondering,\u201d says Geoff Savage, \u201cmight a not quite full-time bowler like Salman (or Root, even) best be described as pro-rata?\u201d Doesn\u2019t that refer to the salary rather than the person? Does that even matter in a post-Bazball world?     10.38am    68th over: England 276-7 (Foakes 53, Wood 7) Nine runs, none in boundaries, from a slightly scruffy over by Nauman that includes a no-ball. That\u2019s the cardinal sin for a spinner.   Updated at 10.40am GMT    10.32am    67th over: England 268-7 (Foakes 51, Wood 1) Foakes reaches his half-century with a single off Mohammad Wasim. I was going to describe it as \u2018unobtrusive\u2019 but then I started to hear the QI klaxon in my head; we need something like that for when cricket writers use such cliches. Still, it\u2019s been a fine, unobtrusive innings: 100 balls, 5x4. Wasim then produces a searing yorker to Wood, who just manages to get an inside-edge on it. He\u2019s getting a fair bit of reverse swing now, and Wood survives a big LBW appeal later in the over. Babar decides to use Pakistan\u2019s last review. I say \u2018use\u2019, he\u2019s spunked it away \u2013 the ball was missing leg stump. \u201cNot to get carried away by the Harry Brook hype machine,\u201d says Saurya Chakraborty, \u201cbut would you say he is nailed on for a knighthood by 2035?\u201d What took them so long?  Updated at 10.32am GMT    10.26am    66th over: England 265-7 (Foakes 49, Wood 0) A wicket maiden for Nauman.  \u201cI see that Harry Brook\u2019s middle name is Cherrington,\u201d says Kim Thonger. \u201cOn the strength of that century is he now a Ripe Cherrington?\u201d Arf. I wonder if any commentator will be brave enough to give him the \u2018Brian Charles Lara\u2019 treatment.     10.24am   WICKET! England 265-7 (Rehan c Shakeel b Nauman 1)  Well, that was interesting. Rehan Ahmed charged Nauman and heaved the ball towards midwicket, where Saud Shakeel took a good two-handed catch above his head. A soft dismissal, but it\u2019s all part of the education. And if you want to take the positives, well, at least he was positive.  Updated at 10.25am GMT    10.20am    65th over: England 265-6 (Foakes 49, Rehan 1) The new batter is Rehan Ahmed, who on paper is a very useful No8. This is only his fourth first-class match, and he\u2019s already made a hundred. He gets off the mark by whipping his first ball extravagantly off middle stump for a single. \u201cBrook has been fantastic, but in a funny way, his progress has created a good headache for England,\u201d says Tom Van der Gucht. \u201cWhen Bairstow returns, we\u2019ll have a glut of middle order attractive strokemakers. It\u2019s like an extra quality piece of jigsaw to try and make fit, possibly at the expense of Foakes. \u201cThe development of Duckett as potentially the quick scoring but reliable opener the management have been hoping Crawley would become actually fits an empty piece of the puzzle we\u2019ve been searching for.\u201d I like Duckett but, at the risk of sounding like the grinch that stole Bazball, I would definitely reserve judgement until he has played on some livelier pitches against quality new-ball bowlers.      10.19am    Something strange happened after the Brook dismissal. He got halfway off the field, then turned and tried to review. It was too late, but it didn\u2019t matter anyway \u2013 it wasn\u2019t bouncing over the stumps, not on this pitch.     10.16am   WICKET! England 262-6 (Brook LBW b Wasim 111)  A change of pace and a change of fortune for Pakistan. Mohammad Wasim strikes with his second ball, trapping Harry Brook LBW with a fine delivery that nips back to hit the back leg. Brook didn\u2019t even discuss a review with Ben Duckett. It\u2019s Wasim\u2019s first Test wicket, and Brook walks off after another quite outstanding innings: 111 from 150 balls, 8x4, 3x6.     10.13am    64th over: England 261-5 (Brook 111, Foakes 46) Nauman has decided to try to bore Brook out by bowling into the filth outside leg stump. \u201cAccept the challenge \u2013 it\u2019s good for you,\u201d said Sir Alex Ferguson once, and I\u2019m sure Brook would agree. He\u2019s not just going to sit there and kick it away. After having a look at a couple of deliveries, he runs down the track to drive for a single. \u201cStokes\u2019s dismissal merely confirms my view that he doesn\u2019t have it at this level,\u201d says Paul Griffin. \u201cAlso, Messi is crap.\u201d Wait till you see my statistical evisceration of Don Bradman. The useless plank only averaged 33.87 when Australia lost fielding first!     10.09am    63rd over: England 258-5 (Brook 110, Foakes 45) One run from Abrar\u2019s over. England are playing in Pakistan, and the team in the field look like they are waiting for a wicket rather than really trying to take one. Talk about a role reversal.  \u201cVery pleased to hear from Guy Hornsby that it\u2019s no longer grim in Sale, although as I write it\u2019s just started gently snowing in Dorridge as young Brook brings up yet another century,\u201d writes Brian Withington. \u201cOn the subject of stars, can we expect you to dash from the Karachi OBO to Qatar MBM this afternoon, after your stalwart turn in the 3rd/4th place play-off yesterday?\u201d Thankfully not. Scott Murray, the greatest liveblogger who ever lived \u2013 I suspect he\u2019d detest that description, which is why I plan to use it every time I mention him from now on \u2013 is doing the World Cup final. I\u2019m ready to sleep for a week.      10.05am    62nd over: England 256-5 (Brook 108, Foakes 44) The lads are back out on the field. Foakes edges Nauman\u2019s second ball past slip for a couple. Every little helps, and England \u2013 who were 159 behind when these two came together \u2013 now trail by just 48.     9.53am    \u201cIt\u2019s easy to forget,\u201d says Henri Du Perier, \u201cthat Brook could probably have got another century in the second innings of the first Test but he was busy going for quick runs to set up a declaration.\u201d Very good point. I\u2019m struggling to recall a comparable performance, especially when you consider that his strike rate in the series is 94.51. Only Ben Stokes, Virender Sehwag and Adam Gilchrist have scored 400+runs in a Test series at a higher strike-rate.  Updated at 9.58am GMT    9.49am    There was a nice moment when Brook walked up the stairs and into the England dressing-room. Stokes was waiting to embrace him, and they immediately started laughing about the mix-up that led to Stokes\u2019s runout. I want to work for Ben Stokes.     9.48am    Statgasm department Only two England batters have ever scored more runs in a three-Test series than Harry Brook. Graham Gooch monstered a world-record 752 against India in 1990, and Len Hutton hit 480 against West Indies in 1939. (We should also mention Wally Hammond, who smashed 563 in a two-Test series against New Zealand in 1932-33.) Even so, Brook\u2019s in the best possible company.     9.44am    \u201cGreetings from a (relatively) balmy Nice,\u201d says Robert Wilson. \u201c Given that English cricket doesn\u2019t lack for batters who pull off a bit of early-career derring-do in India and Pakistan before reality kicks and ruins all our boyish dreams, how good do you think Brook actually is? I mean good grief, this is getting ridiculous. I\u2019m actually a little scared. I want to believe, I so much want to give my heart away again. \u201cAm I going to end up watching the raindrops drip down my windows, tearfully thinking of entropy? Tell me, you know I rely on you for everything.\u201d He\u2019ll be a white-ball superstar. Lock up your red-ball heart until he\u2019s cracked Australia.     9.42am    61st over: England 254-5 (Brook 108, Foakes 42) At last, a bowling change. Agha Salman, who is somewhere between a full-time and part-time offspinner, comes into the attack on the stroke of tea. Nothing much happens.  That\u2019s the end of an extremely good session for England \u2013 114 runs, one wicket - and particularly the phenomenal Harry Brook, who compartmentalised his part in the run-out of Ben Stokes to make another majestic century. Babar Azam allowed the game to drift, bowling Abrar and Nauman to no great effect and with no great purpose. A wicket would change everything, we know that from watching Pakistan over the last forever, but for now England are in control.     9.37am    60th over: England 249-5 (Brook 105, Foakes 40) Brook tries to reverse sweep a low full toss from Nauman and under-edges the ball between his legs for three. An eagle-eyed Mike Atherton spots that the ball would have hit the off stump but for a slight deflection off Brook\u2019s back calf.     9.35am   Another century for Harry Brook!  59th over: England 245-5 (Brook 102, Foakes 39) Brook reaches another marvellous century with a gorgeous stroke. He skids back in his crease to drive Abrar through extra cover off the back foot and away for four. His celebration is pretty low-key \u2013 another day, another Test century \u2013 but he gets a standing ovation from the England balcony. This is quite spectacular. Before this tour Brook had played one Test, and now he has jauntily scored a century in every match of the series. This one came from 133 balls, with eight fours and three sixes.  Updated at 9.35am GMT    9.28am    58th over: England 239-5 (Brook 97, Foakes 38) Rizwan appeals for a leg-side catch offered by Foakes off Nauman. Joel Wilson raises his arms, but only to signal a wide. There was nothing on UltraEdge.  \u201cHarry Brook eh??\u201d says Phil Harrison. \u201cI\u2019ve decided he\u2019s the culmination of the last two decades of English red-ball and white-ball batting. He\u2019s Root x Pietersen x Buttler. Some player.\u201d No pressure. I\u2019d like to see him against world-class fast bowling before we officially anoint him. But he does seem to have it, whatever it is, in industrial quantities.     9.24am    57th over: England 235-5 (Brook 96, Foakes 36) Brook thumps Abrar through extra cover for two, which makes him England\u2019s highest runscorer in a series in Pakistan. His performance has been both remarkable and not particularly surprising.     9.21am    56th over: England 229-5 (Brook 91, Foakes 35) Brook charges Nauman and slices a chip shot over mid-off for a couple. It wasn\u2019t where he intended but it cleared the fielder pretty comfortably, and the two runs take him into the nerveless nineties. He. Is. Very. Good. Foakes has an escape later in the over, bat-padding Nauman through the vacant silly point area.     9.17am    55th over: England 226-5 (Brook 88, Foakes 35) Foakes almost offers a return catch to Abrar, with a hard-handed leading edge dropping just short. A maiden.     9.15am    54th over: England 226-5 (Brook 88, Foakes 35) Nauman moves over the wicket to Brook, who launches into a reverse slog-sweep first ball. He doesn\u2019t connect properly and under-edges it wide of Rizwan for a single, the first of four from the over.     9.11am    53rd over: England 222-5 (Brook 86, Foakes 33) The Stokes run-out doesn\u2019t seem to have affected Brook one iota. This generation are just different, aren\u2019t they, less worried about perception or appearance and more concerned with hitting the next ball for four. Abrar beats Foakes with a good one that turns pretty sharply. The pitch hasn\u2019t deteriorated yet, but the odd ball is misbehaving.     9.09am    52nd over: England 219-5 (Brook 83, Foakes 33) Another terrific bit of placement from Foakes, who skips down the track to flick Nauman between midwicket and mid-on for four. Foakes has quietly \u2013 of course he\u2019s done it quietly \u2013 batted well under Ben Stokes: 273 runs at an average of 46. \u201cMorning Rob, from a finally unfrozen Sale,\u201d says Guy Hornsby. \u201cThis is gripping, brilliant Test cricket. I\u2019m not going to praise the batters because... Well you know how that goes. But this team is showing it\u2019s not always just fifth gear. This partnership is so crucial, because we could be 25 more or 100 more when the next wicket falls. So finely in the balance. Anyway, we all know the greatest Christmas song is Jona Lewie.\u201d  No no no nono nononononono.      9.04am    51st over: England 214-5 (Brook 82, Foakes 29) Brook swipes Abrar straight back over his head for a majestic six. He crunches an off-drive later in the over \u2013 \u201calmost a hockey shot,\u201d says David Gower \u2013 and Faheem Ashraf does well to save two runs at long-off.     9.01am    50th over: England 205-5 (Brook 73, Foakes 29) Brook cuts Nauman to the cover sweeper for a single. He\u2019s 28 runs away from a pretty remarkable achievement: a century in each Test of his first overseas series. Saying that, Pakistan has become his second home. Nauman produces a beauty to Foakes later in the over, but the outside edge falls well short of slip. This pitch is made of soil and mogadon.     8.57am    49th over: England 202-5 (Brook 71, Foakes 28) Foakes chips Abrar handsomely over midwicket for four to bring up the fifty partnership. After a slow start, he is playing fluently: 1 from the first 18 balls, 27 from the next 32. Even Bazball has gears, occasionally.  Updated at 8.57am GMT    8.54am    48th over: England 194-5 (Brook 70, Foakes 21)     8.51am    47th over: England 192-5 (Brook 68, Foakes 21) Foakes moves into the twenties with a stylish boundary, a wristy clip through midwicket off Abrar. This is a useful partnership \u2013 47 from 14.1 overs at the admittedly miserable scoring rate of 3.3 per over.     8.48am    46th over: England 188-5 (Brook 68, Foakes 17) Thanks Taha, morning everyone. Nauman continues to Brook, who charges the first ball but can\u2019t beat Babar at cover. He and Foakes take a single apiece later in the over.     8.42am    45th over: England 186-5 (Brook 67, Foakes 16) That\u2019s drinks and enough from me. Rob Smyth will take you through to stumps.      8.39am    44th over: England 186-5 (Foakes 16, Brook 67) Nauman twirls away and Brook shows off his impressive forward defence.      8.36am    43rd over: England 183-5 (Foakes 14, Brook 66) Brook swats away Abrar again off the back foot for four \u2013 he\u2019s so good at that particular shot.     8.33am    42nd over: England 177-5 (Brook 61, Foakes 13) Brooks and Foakes tap it about as Nauman returns to the attack.      8.31am    Simon McMahon messages in: \u201cIf it\u2019s song requests your after, how about the greatest Christmas song ever, Keeping the Dream Alive by Freiheit? Only a week to go now, and the lyric seems strangely appropriate for Test cricket today - \u2018the hopes we had were much to high, way out of reach but we have to try, no need to hide, no need to run, \u2018cause all the answers come one by one, the game will never be over, because we\u2019re keeping the dream alive\u2019.\u201d Can\u2019t say I\u2019m familiar with this tune, but it\u2019s blasting out of my speakers as I type.       8.27am    41st over: England 171-5 (Foakes 9, Brook 59) Wasim continues to run in, searching for that tailing yorker to rattle the stumps or bring about an lbw. Brook soaks in one in-ducker and plays the most sublime straight drive for four. A full toss follows and Brook drives through the covers for another boundary.      8.24am    40th over: England 163-5 (Brook 51, Foakes 9)      8.22am    It\u2019s nowhere near the bat and the ball is projected to miss the stumps on lbw, too. Carry on.      8.21am    Foakes nabs another boundary, this time off Abrar. But then the finger goes up! It\u2019s for a catch at short leg, and Foakes has gone upstairs for a review\u2026     8.18am    39th over: England 158-5 (Brook 50, Foakes 5) Foakes finally gets a wide one from Wasim, and he obliges with a dab to the third-man boundary for four.      8.14am   Fifty for Harry Brook!  38th over: England 154-5 (Foakes 1, Brook 50) Brook is quick on the pull once again to take four off Abrar. And then a moment of worry for the batter, with a top-edge sweep sending the ball high\u2026 but the man at deep backward square leg can\u2019t get to it in time. And that\u2019s a half-century, too, in what has been a sublime series for England\u2019s newest batting star.      8.09am    37th over: England 148-5 (Brook 44, Foakes 1) Wasim has tightened things up at his end, too.      8.06am    36th over: England 147-5 (Brook 43, Foakes 1) Having missed out on selection for the second Test, Foakes is having to learn about Abrar\u2019s various tricks in this one. He\u2019s understandably watchful, dotting out while Brook picks up a single.      8.01am    35th over: England 146-5 (Brook 42, Foakes 1) Wasim is starting to find his line, getting the ball to tail in late and test the defence of Foakes.      7.58am    34th over: England 146-5 (Foakes 1, Brook 42) Oh, this game is getting quite exciting now.      7.53am    33rd over: England 145-5 (Foakes 0, Brook 42) Foakes is out in the middle for his first innings of the series. And he\u2019s got some work to do.      7.52am   WICKET! Stokes run out Azhar/Wasim 26 (England 145-5)  Oh my days. Brook clips away Wasim for what looks to be a comfortable couple of runs. Except Stokes wants three and just keeps on going, despite Brook turning back. The throw comes in from Azhar Ali and Wasim obliges at the non-striker\u2019s end with the easiest of run-outs. A bizarre mix-up and Pakistan are right in this.  Updated at 7.55am GMT    7.46am    32nd over: England 140-4 (Stokes 25, Brook 38) A tidy maiden to start the session.      7.41am    Ben Stokes and Harry Brook are back out there. Looks like Abrar will kick things off.      7.13am    Australia have won by six wickets at the Gabba inside two days. What a scorecard this is.       7.03am   Lunch - England 140-4  31st over: England 140-4 (Brook 38, Stokes 25) Wasim is full and straight to Brook, resulting in an lbw shout \u2013 but it\u2019s probably going down leg. Decent pace from Wasim, getting it above 140kph, but he\u2019s struggled with his lines so far. Brook, with the third ball of the over, plays a stunning shot, opening up the off side with a small shuffle to leg, with his punch for four coming off the straightest of bats. And that\u2019s lunch!     6.57am    30th over: England 135-4 (Brook 33, Stokes 25) Stokes wallops a sweep for four off the third ball of the over. Nauman then goes too short and Stokes rocks back to punch through the off-side for another boundary. He\u2019s looking good.      6.54am    29th over: England 127-4 (Stokes 17, Brook 33) Wasim returns and Stokes shows his hand early, shimmying down the pitch \u2013 but he doesn\u2019t get any bat on it. The England captain gets it right with the penultimate ball of the over, though, advancing to smash it for four through extra.      6.50am    Abrar\u2019s magical delivery to remove Pope:      6.48am    28th over: England 122-4 (Stokes 12, Brook 33) They\u2019re talking football and fish on comms right now, so things have calmed down a touch.      6.45am    27th over: England 120-4 (Brook 32, Stokes 11) Stokes sweeps and the ball bounces up to strike Abdullah Shafique at short leg on the helmet. A brief pause in play then to make sure he\u2019s all good \u2013 and it looks that way.      6.39am    26th over: England 118-4 (Stokes 10, Brook 31) Stokes sees some air and sweeps Nauman hard for his first boundary.      6.37am    25th over: England 110-4 (Brook 29, Stokes 4) Abrar shouts the house down with an lbw appeal against Stokes, but the ball looks as if it\u2019s pitched outside leg. A quick, flat, straight one follows to Brook, who just about keeps it out.      6.33am    24th over: England 108-4 (Stokes 3, Brook 28) Stokes and Brook exchange singles as Nauman continues.      6.28am    23rd over: England 105-4 (Stokes 1, Brook 27) Stokes comes down the track to get off the mark with a single before Brook finishes the over with a straight six. As you do.      6.25am   WICKET! Pope b Abrar 51 (England 98-4)  Oh, you are not playing that. Abrar unfurls a beaut, luring in the forward press before getting the ball to turn and rattle the stumps. A magical piece of bowling.      6.24am   Fifty for Olie Pope!  22nd over: England 97-3 (Brook 20, Pope 51) Pope finishes Nauman\u2019s over with a boundary to bring up his 11th Test fifty. Played.     6.22am    Kim, who is trying to have it all, messages in: \u201cTo keep track of events here and at the Gabba I\u2019ve resorted to holding a phone in each hand, enabling me to monitor both OBO feeds simultaneously. I feel rather like The Sundance Kid with a six shooter in each hand, holding off the lawmen besieging my last place of refuge. This is fine until my wife wakes up and demands her phone back. Then a difficult choice will have to be made, as she is unlikely to take no for an answer.\u201d Seems like Australia are about to sort this out for you. They need just twenty-something more to wrap things up at the Gabba.       6.19am    21st over: England 89-3 (Pope 44, Brook 19) Abrar tries the front-of-hand delivery and it\u2019s too far down the leg side \u2013 Brook sweeps away for four.      6.17am    20th over: England 84-3 (Pope 43, Brook 15) Another tidy one from Nauman.  Tony writes in: \u201cThere\u2019s been lots of talk of who to leave in the english team and who to leave out, mostly revolving around who keeps wicket and who is essentially a batsman.I would suggest that perhaps the choice would be simpler if the off spinner and part time batsman Root were dropped!Is one allowed to say things like that?\u201d Tony, Tony, Tony. It\u2019s early in the morning and I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve had your coffee yet.      6.13am    19th over: England 83-3 (Pope 42, Brook 15) Abrar goes full and fast out of the front of the hand to leave Brook in all sorts, and Babar goes up for a review. It\u2019s going down the leg side, though, rather comfortably. Brook bounces back with the final ball of the over, rocking back for a leg-side smash to pick up four. He was so quick to get in position for that.      6.09am    The two wickets that fell earlier:      6.07am    18th over: England 77-3 (Brook 10, Pope 41) Babar\u2019s back on the field as Nauman twirls away to concede just one. Time for drinks.  Brian writes in: \u201cMy expectations of proper, sedate Test cricket were being somewhat disturbed by the jaunty rate of England\u2019s run scoring, but after the quick dismissals of Duckett and Root perhaps we can expect young Brook and Pope to undertake a patient rebuild and restore decorum to proceedings.\u201d I\u2019m not sure the kids are going to keep quiet for long\u2026     6.02am    17th over: England 76-3 (Brook 9, Pope 41) Outrageous from Brook, who launches Abrar for a straight six, his backfoot lifted up for that little bit of extra flair. An LBW shout follows as Brook comes down the pitch a couple of balls later, but he\u2019s way too far out of his crease for that to be a problem.      5.57am    16th over: England 69-3 (Brook 2, Pope 41) Pope comes down the track to bunt the ball to mid-on and steal a single.      5.54am    15th over: England 65-3 (Pope 38, Brook 1) Abrar gets another one to keep very low, and Pope does very well to flick it away for a couple.      5.50am    14th over: England 60-3 (Pope 33, Brook 1) No hat-trick as Brook gets off strike immediately. A wonderful over from Nauman Ali has livened up proceedings.      5.47am    Nauman on a hat-trick! Brook is out there to face it.      5.46am   WICKET!!! Root c Salman b Nauman 0 (England 58-3)  Another one! Beautiful from Nauman as he tosses one up to get Root poking forward, and the outside edge is gobbled up at first slip. The umpires check if it\u2019s carried \u2013 and it has, no dramas there. A first-baller for Root. What a moment!     5.43am   WICKET! Duckett lbw Nauman 26 (England 58-2)  And that\u2019s hitting middle of middle! It was umpire\u2019s call on impact. Nauman, from over the wicket, got some sharp turn there to trap Duckett on the back foot. That\u2019s come slightly out of nowhere for Pakistan.      5.40am    Duckett reviews after Nauman has him lbw\u2026     5.39am    13th over: England (Duckett 26, Pope 32) Big from Duckett! He comes down the track and smashes Abrar for a straight six. Lovely, lovely shot. The left-hander dabs to the off-side for a single a couple of balls later, and Pope then collects a boundary with a beautiful clip through the leg side. England are cruising.      5.35am    12th over: England 47-1 (Duckett 19, Pope 28) Pope and Duckett tick along comfortably against Nauman, with the latter bringing out his paddle sweep for a single.      5.32am    11th over: England 42-1 (Duckett 17, Pope 25) Abrar is tweaking away, and looking threatening, that low bounce giving him something to work with.      5.30am    Here\u2019s some love for Adam Collins, a regular on these pages. A great call on Mitchell Starc\u2019s 300th Test wicket.       5.28am    10th over: England 38-1 (Pope 22, Duckett 16) The quicks aren\u2019t having much fun so it\u2019s spin from both ends as Nauman Ali gets a bowl. Duckett swats away to the leg side and gets two after a misfield from Abrar, who was ambitious in trying the one-handed pick-up.      5.22am    9th over: England 33-1 (Pope 20, Duckett 13) Duckett gets his beloved sweep out to fetch a couple off Abrar.      5.20am    8th over: England 30-1 (Pope 19, Duckett 11) Wasim is given the boot after two expensive overs, with Faheem Ashraf called into the attack to replace him. He brings a bit more control, conceding just a couple.      5.18am    7th over: England 28-1 (Duckett 10, Pope 18) Abrar gets one to keep low, giving Pope a little fright.  \u201cMorning Taha.\u201d Morning, Brian.\"I must confess I was almost distracted by the mayhem available in Australia, but the lure of proper, sedate Test cricket in your reassuring company was too strong. I am sure messrs Pope, Duckett and co will dig in and try to eke things out until lunch \u2026\u201dThanks, Brian, you\u2019ve made the right call.      5.11am    6th over: England 26-1 (Pope 17, Duckett 9) On the pads from Wasim, and Pope flicks through the leg-side for four. The debutant is too straight again with his following delivery, and Pope picks up two with another whip. Duckett finishes the over with a clip of his own behind square for four.     5.07am    5th over: England 15-1 (Pope 10, Duckett 5) Abrar has the ball, and it\u2019s Mohammad Rizwan who is calling the shots out there for Pakistan \u2013 Babar Azam is feeling unwell, says Nasser on comms. Maiden for the leggie.      5.04am    4th over: England 15-1 (Duckett 5, Pope 10) Pope throws his hands out there at a wide one and, while not in total control, finds four over the cordon. We\u2019re up and running on day two.      5.01am    Ollie Pope and Ben Duckett are out there, and Mohammad Wasim has the ball.      4.43am    Now, look, I don\u2019t want people to leave me here. But there\u2019s some madness going on at the Gabba.  Scott Boland \u2013 that Test average is still absolutely ridiculous.       4.39am    This is just all kinds of lovely.      4.30am   Preamble  Morning, folks! The opening day in Karachi was a historic one, all thanks to a teenage kid with some very useful tricks. Rehan Ahmed became England\u2019s youngest men\u2019s Test cricketer and, after a nervy start, found his rhythm on a flat one to take two impressive wickets. The first, that of Saud Shakeel, was a lovely set-up: the googly followed by a leg-spinner that resulted in a terrific bat-pad catch by Ollie Pope. The second was a gorgeous wrong\u2019un, beating the forward press of Faheem Ashraf to have the left-hander lbw. An 18-year-old leggie in this madly fun Test side \u2013 you can\u2019t help but get a bit excited.  Rehan Ahmed helped England bowl out Pakistan for 304, and Zak Crawley fell for a duck to the twirly delights of Abrar Ahmed, leaving Stokes\u2019 men on 7-1.  As ever, feel free to slide into my DMs with any thoughts/queries/song requests. I\u2019ll be back shortly.   "

                    "body": "Liverpool and Manchester City fans have united in their condemnation of the \u201cshambolic\u201d travel arrangements for their FA Cup semi-final at Wembley next month. Leading supporters groups from both clubs said they were appalled as the Football Association began liaising with Network Rail after it emerged no direct trains to London from Manchester and Merseyside are scheduled over the Easter weekend.  Engineering work dictates that trains from Liverpool Lime Street will terminate at Rugby and those from Manchester Piccadilly at Milton Keynes, forcing fans to either travel by road, air or contemplate circuitous cross-country rail journeys that make day-return trips virtually impossible. Avanti West Coast on Monday confirmed the lack of direct trains.  According to a rail industry source, the FA was warned in writing last September that there would be significant disruption on the West Coast mainline during the weekend on which the semi-finals were scheduled.  With television companies still finalising their plans for broadcasting the two semi-finals \u2013 Chelsea meet Crystal Palace in the other Wembley tie \u2013 on 16 and 17 April, the FA were exploring ways of minimising the potential disruption and travel costs . \u201cThe FA will be liaising closely with both Liverpool and Manchester City on all match arrangements, including supporters travel for the upcoming FA Cup semi-final fixture at Wembley Stadium, with further details to be announced in due course,\u201d said a spokesmanon Monday night. \u201cWe are also continuing to work with both Network Rail and National Express to find a solution so that supporters of both teams are able to travel to and from the fixture with as minimal disruption as possible.\u201d The leading Liverpool supporters group Spirit of Shankly is working with its counterparts at City\u2019s We are 1894 to push the FA and television companies into finding some sort of compromise. \u201cFans representatives from both Liverpool and Man City are appalled at the shambolic travel arrangements,\u201d tweeted Spirit of Shankly on Monday.  Any solution would be welcomed by J\u00fcrgen Klopp. \u201cHow is it possible that the whole of the north-west is cut off from the rest of England?\u201d asked the Liverpool manager after their quarter-final win against Nottingham Forest. \u201cI do not know which kind of solutions are available but I hope someone finds one. If we could play with supporters that would be really good for both teams.\u201d Chelsea can expect to have full support at their semi-final despite the UK government\u2019s sanctions on Roman Abramovich barring the club from selling any new tickets. It is a situation intended to prevent Abramovich from benefiting from revenue streams but one that Julian Knight, the chair of parliament\u2019s digital, culture, media and sport select committee, disagrees with. Knight believes Chelsea fans should be allowed to purchase Wembley seats, with the proviso that all proceeds go to the people of Ukraine. \u201cIt is ridiculous that we face the prospect of a half-full Wembley for the Chelsea vs Palace FA Cup semi-final,\u201d he said. \u201cChelsea is more than just its owner, it\u2019s a living organism with huge importance to its fans and community.  \u201cIt was understandable that, at short notice, last week\u2019s game against Middlesbrough went ahead without Chelsea fans but, with this much notice, the FA have no excuse for excluding them. The FA must be allowed to sell tickets to Chelsea fans so long as all money goes to the people of Ukraine.\u201d Discussions between the government, the Premier League and the Football Association on ticketing for Chelsea fixtures are ongoing, with one suggestion being that seats could be sold by an independent commercial ticket agency."

                    "body": "Gareth Taylor said criticism of his tenure at the start of the season felt \u201ca little bit unjustified\u201d after Manchester City beat Chelsea 3-1 to win the Continental League Cup.\nCity stuttered early on in the campaign with crippling injuries, condemning them to seven defeats in their first 14 games and many questioned whether Taylor was capable of reversing the team\u2019s fortunes.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I came off all social media at that time, I surrounded myself with the right people,\u201d said the former striker. \u201cI\u2019m an ex-player, I\u2019ve had criticism all my career, so I kind of know how to handle it, doesn\u2019t mean I like it. I just tried to cut out the noise.\n\u201cI felt that it was a little bit unjustified, with the amount of injuries that we had. What were [doubters] expecting in that situation when we were only able to select two or three outfield substitutes in a game and were playing players in unfamiliar positions? It\u2019s easy these days to point a finger and say: \u2018Is this person up to it or not?\u2019 But I think you have to have belief in what you do.\u201d\nThe game was almost a microcosm of City\u2019s season with two goals from the Scotland midfielder Caroline Weir sandwiching Ellen White\u2019s poached effort in a gutsy second-half performance after the Australia forward, Sam Kerr, had given Chelsea the lead.\n\n\u201cThe players are the most important thing,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThey\u2019ve shown that they\u2019re fighting, they\u2019ve been fighting the whole season, and sometimes things haven\u2019t gone our way. Fortunately, more recently things have started to edge our way, which is nice.\u201d\nCity were unlucky not to be ahead in the 26th minute after Georgia Stanway\u2019s cross was met by the dynamic Lauren Hemp but she rattled the ball off the foot of the post. The resulting clearance fell to full-back Demi Stokes on the edge of the area, her strike ricocheted off the high arm of Sophie Ingle but the referee, Lisa Benn, waved away the penalty appeals.\nThe Chelsea manager, Emma Hayes, had insisted it would be business as usual on the pitch after \u201ca long week for people at Chelsea\u201d and, perhaps shaken alive by Hemp\u2019s chance, the holders started to stretch the City backline. Less than 10 minutes later they had the lead. \nGuro Reiten\u2019s cross from the left could only be pushed away by Ellie Roebuck as Stokes leant into her while going for the same ball. Kerr collected before turning and firing low and into the net.\n\nUnperturbed, five minutes after the restart City were level. Stanway\u2019s square ball in was taken down by Weir who fired past Ann-Katrin Berger, taking a deflection off her outstretched foot on its way in.\n\u201cWhen it went to 1-1 the momentum shifted,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been undefeated against them 10 times [but] today\u2019s their day; congratulations. I think they\u2019re worthy winners because of their second-half performance. We lacked players today and I think it showed. The better team won over 90 minutes.\u201d\nWith momentum swinging behind City, White gave them the lead for the first time, poking in the rebound after Berger parried Hemp\u2019s effort. Less than 10 minutes later they extended it, again through Weir, this time volleying smartly into the top corner. Weir had come off of the bench in back-to-back Manchester derbies to score before starting in the final.\n\n\u201cI think one of the first conversations I had with Caroline was: \u2018I know you can score from 30 yards. But what are you like in the box?\u2019 And she said: \u2018Well, I probably don\u2019t get in there enough\u2019,\u201d Taylor said.\n\u201cI scored a hat-trick here once, I was telling the girls earlier, when it was the old Plough Lane. It was in the FA Youth Cup for Southampton at Wimbledon. I said: \u2018See if you can match that, Ellen\u2019.\u201d"

                    "body": "Uncertainty across Europe about the precise definition of \u201cfoul play\u201d in rugby union shows no sign of easing after the decision to give Leicester\u2019s Guy Porter a three-week ban for an off-the-ball collision with Clermont\u2019s Fritz Lee in Sunday\u2019s Champions Cup last-16 tie. The original red card has been upheld and Porter will now miss Saturday\u2019s second leg at Welford Road. Leicester and Porter contested the charge but an independent disciplinary panel, chaired by Wales\u2019s Roger Morris, found the Tigers centre \u201chad committed a reckless act of foul play\u201d even though neither player had the ball and the head clash looked accidental. The offence was deemed to be in the mid-range category of World Rugby sanctions but Porter\u2019s suspension was halved because of his previously clear disciplinary record.  Both the player and European Professional Club Rugby have the right to appeal, which demonstrates the determination of rugby\u2019s authorities to try to minimise head contact in the game. The case, however, sets a big precedent given Porter was fully entitled to try to close down the space available to Clermont\u2019s midfield at pace, had his eyes fixed on the ball-carrying Camille Lopez and was not actively seeking contact with Lee. That was not how the panel, which included the former Ireland fly-half David Humphreys and ex-Scotland coach Frank Hadden, ultimately saw it, despite a submission in Porter\u2019s defence from Leicester Tigers\u2019 general manager, Leigh Jones. Porter is free to play on 27 April but will be available 48 hours earlier if he completes a World Rugby tackle technique awareness course. The verdict comes on the same day as a five-week ban was given to Brive\u2019s full-back Axel Muller for what the panel ruled was an intentional head-high tackle on Saracens\u2019 Ben Harris. A separate disciplinary panel, chaired by England\u2019s Samantha Hillas QC, identified it as a top-end offence but slashed the 10-week tariff by 50 per cent because of the player\u2019s guilty plea and previous clean record. For a clearly dangerous, intentional high hit to sideline the culprit for just two weeks more than the unfortunate Porter underlines the increasing lack of consistency in disciplinary outcomes. Leinster\u2019s Jamison Gibson-Park, for example, had his citing case dismissed after an upright tackle against Connacht in which he caught Kieran Marmion\u2019s head with his shoulder.  As a result Gibson-Park is available to start the second leg in Dublin as Leinster look to nail down a potential quarter-final against Leicester. The Irish province also welcome back their international front-rowers Andrew Porter and Ronan Kelleher for Friday\u2019s tea-time kick-off at the Aviva Stadium. In Friday\u2019s other tie, Bristol, seeking to protect a one-point advantage from the first leg in Salford, have again selected Charles Piutau and Semi Radradra on the bench for the rematch with Sale at Ashton Gate. Radradra scored the only try of the game last week but Lam believes his chosen starting XV is better suited to neutering Sale\u2019s direct style of play.  The Sharks director of rugby, Alex Sanderson, has made one starting change, the fit-again Tom Roebuck replacing Jack Metcalf. The England scrum-half Raffi Quirke has a hamstring injury, however, so Gus Warr will be the bench understudy to Faf de Klerk. Remarkably all but one of Sale\u2019s pack and both half-backs hail from South Africa, with another three of their compatriots on the bench. In the Challenge Cup the soon-to-retire Sean O\u2019Brien is at No 8 for London Irish against Castres, while Wasps will field Brad Shields, Jack Willis and Alfie Barbeary in their starting back-row for the home game against Biarritz. Winger Ben Stevenson is poised to make his first start for Newcastle Falcons since November when they host Glasgow Warriors at Kingston Park."

The network was awarded the Revive Our Oceans category of the prizes, which was launched by Prince William and David Attenborough in 2020. The initiative is described by the Earthshot prize as \u201can inspiring women led program\u201d that combines 60,000 years of First Nations knowledge with digital technologies to protect land and sea.  Only an estimated 20% of Indigenous rangers in Queensland are women. The QIWRN, established in 2018, has trained more than 60 women, many of whom have subsequently found work as rangers or in conservation in Queensland or elsewhere. The Earthshot prize describes the program as \u201cvital\u201d. \u201cThe data they have collected has given us critical insight into one of the most important ecosystems on the planet. As custodians of the land, the rangers have also protected sites of great cultural and spiritual significance. \u201cWith greater support, Indigenous women rangers could span the planet, helping to repair ecosystems from Hawaii to Nepal and Tanzania.\u201d  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  The network\u2019s managing director, Larissa Hale, said in a statement: \u201cThis place has always been our home, but today we risk losing it and the unique culture that has existed here for millennia. Our Women Rangers Network exists to protect our home and continue our traditions. \u201cWe have made big first steps, but we have a long way still to go. Thank you to the Earthshot prize, for supporting us.\u201d The council that selects its prize winners includes Queen Rania Al Abdullah of Jordan and Cate Blanchett, among others. The US ambassador to Australia, Caroline Kennedy, was at present at the awards ceremony and told the ABC she was \u201cso excited\u201d and \u201choping they would win\u201d. \u201cI hope it will raise awareness around the world really for the importance of the oceans and the work that we can all do to preserve and protect them \u2013 and draw on traditional knowledge to do that,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cI really hope to visit them when I return to Australia.\u201d"

                    "body": "The ACT director of public prosecutions, Shane Drumgold, has expressed serious concern about the \u201cpotentially unlawful\u201d sharing of police material about a still-hospitalised Brittany Higgins, revealing he has previously lodged a related complaint and that there are active investigations under way. On Saturday morning, News Corp used internal police notes and briefing documents to report that investigators held doubts about Higgins\u2019 credibility, but that the DPP pressed ahead with the prosecution of Bruce Lehrmann. The material was published less than 24 hours after Drumgold expressed serious concern for the life of Higgins, who is hospitalised and receiving mental health treatment. He dropped charges against Lehrmann for the alleged rape of Higgins, saying a retrial would pose an \u201cunacceptable risk\u201d to her health.  It is unclear who leaked the material about Higgins. The piece makes no mention of the fact that it was a decision of the Australian federal police to lay charges. Lehrmann has consistently maintained his innocence to the allegation that he raped Higgins in parliament house. Lehrmann pleaded not guilty to one count of sexual intercourse without consent. Asked to respond to the story, Drumgold expressed serious concerns about the distribution of documents that were \u201cpotentially legally protected\u201d. Drumgold revealed he had already made a complaint about an undisclosed matter, about which there were active \u201cinvestigations\u201d under way. He did not specify who was being investigated or which body or bodies were conducting the investigations. \u201cI am greatly concerned that potentially legally protected material may have again been unlawfully distributed,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cGiven myself and others have already raised concerns about matters that are currently under investigation, it would not be appropriate to comment further whilst investigations are under way.\u201d  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  The ABC has previously reported that an internal investigation was requested by Higgins over a decision by police to share evidence with the defence team of Bruce Lehrmann, who has consistently maintained that no sexual activity took place at all between Higgins and himself. The Guardian understands Higgins is yet to receive a full response to the internal investigation, which was lodged in April. News Corp reported on Saturday that Drumgold had also expressed concerns about police\u2019s handing of the material, which included her private psychological counselling notes. The Guardian has since seen a copy of his complaint. \u201cThis issue is quite serious, the counselling notes and other sensitive information of a rape complainant have been unlawfully given to counsel for an alleged rapist,\u201d Drumgold said on 11 October 2021. \u201cI would suggest it should attract greater urgency than it appears to be receiving.\u201d ACT policing declined to comment on Saturday morning. They were not the only ones to have held the material. The leak and Drumgold\u2019s strong response suggest a serious rift has emerged between police and the DPP over the handling of the case. The material published in the Australian on Saturday claimed that Drumgold had pushed to take the case for trial, despite police having concerns about the sufficiency of the evidence. One of the investigators had also complained, alleging \u201cpolitical interference\u201d. In explaining his decision not to pursue a retrial on Friday, Drumgold said he had formed a view that there was a reasonable prospect of conviction before taking the case to trial. He said he still maintained that view. Drumgold also expressed serious concerns about the mental health of Higgins, saying a retrial would pose a significant risk to her life. The risks to her life were so great that he decided there was no public interest in proceeding. \u201cI\u2019ve recently received compelling evidence from two independent medical experts that the ongoing trauma associated with this prosecution represents a significant and unacceptable risk to the life of the complainant,\u201d he said. The court lifted a suppression on Friday which allowed media to report that Higgins had suffered a mental health crisis when she was halfway through her evidence, prompting her absence. Close friend Emma Webster said on Friday that Higgins was in hospital and receiving treatment and support. She described the past two years as \u201cdifficult and unrelenting\u201d. \u201cWhile it\u2019s disappointing the trial has ended this way, Brittany\u2019s health and safety must always come first,\u201d she said. \u201cBrittany is extremely grateful for all the support she has received, particularly from our mental health care workers.\u201d The decision means the retrial of Lehrmann, expected in February, will not proceed. It is understood Lehrmann is taking time to process the development. A friend of Lehrmann\u2019s told the Guardian he was considering \u201clegal remedies\u201d and would take advice on the matter in coming days. \u2022 In Australia, support is available at Beyond Blue on 1300 22 4636 and Lifeline on 13 11 14.

                    "body": "Inscribed on the sandstone walls of the Ted Noffs foundation headquarters in Sydney are the words \u201cEasts House\u201d.\nFor 22 years the foundation, one of the country\u2019s leading addiction services providers, has called it home, helping countless young people while becoming a key advocate for drug law reform in New South Wales.\nThe building, in Randwick, was bought in 2000 for $1.2m by the Eastern Suburbs Leagues Club. Since then, Easts has provided the foundation its home rent-free as an in-kind donation through a program called ClubGrants.\nFirst introduced in the late 1990s, the grants scheme goes a long way to explaining the extraordinary sway of the clubs lobby in NSW \u2013 and the long history of governments in the state failing to hobble the $3.8bn-a-year poker machine industry.\n\nClubsNSW says each year about $100m in donations are made via the scheme \u201cto a variety of worthy causes\u201d. All up more than $1bn has been handed out. Each year, in the state\u2019s parliament, MPs line up to pay tribute to its charity efforts.\nIn October, Holsworthy Liberal MP Melanie Gibbons congratulated Moorebank RSL for a $25,175 donation to a charity supporting parents whose children are in the neonatal intensive care unit at Liverpool hospital in Sydney\u2019s south-west.\nLast year David Harris, the Labor MP for Wyong on the central coast, thanked a local leagues club for giving $4,400 to a group providing school supplies to disadvantaged children.\nAnd yet, critics say some clubs give large sums of money to projects with direct links to the organisation, with little oversight or transparency over how the grants are awarded.\n\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\n\nIn some cases, the links are obvious. Last year, the ABC revealed that one of the largest clubs in the state, WestOne, better known as Rooty Hill RSL, in the city\u2019s west, handed out $870,000 over two years to the Sydney Gymnastic Aquatic Centre.\nDescribed as \u201cone of the largest purpose-built gymnastics facilities in the southern hemisphere with Olympic-standard equipment\u201d, the facility is owned by WestOne.\nIn other cases, clubs hand out grants to professional sporting organisations to which they are linked. In 2020, the Canterbury Leagues Club gave $421,109 in donations to local charities, religious groups and junior sporting clubs in Sydney\u2019s west.\nBut its largest donation by far was to the Canterbury Bulldogs Rugby League Club \u2013 a professional NRL team and the leagues club\u2019s holding entity. It granted the club $3.2m in funding that year, followed up by another $2.6m in 2022. Wests Newcastle last year declared $250,000 in grants to the Newcastle Knights, along with another $69,000 in in-kind donations. The club purchased the Knights in 2017.\nUnder the ClubsGrants scheme, there is nothing to stop clubs from donating money to their own entities, but groups linked to the scheme have begun to raise concerns about the lack of oversight or accountability with the grants.\nLast year, peak welfare body the NSW Council for Social Service (Ncoss) said it would end its 24-year association with ClubGrants over concerns about the way funding decisions were made.\nAmong the litany of issues raised by Ncoss was the ability of clubs to gain \u201cfinancial or other advantage\u201d by awarding funds to organisations to which they were linked.\nJoanna Quilty, the chief executive of Ncoss, said there was nothing in the guidelines governing the grants to stop money being funnelled back into the club.\n\u201cThey can fund their own Christmas lunches, or provide funds to a bowling club or aged-care facility that the club might own,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s ample opportunity for directing funds to their own projects and we found that goes on regularly.\u201d\nThe grants allow clubs across NSW to gain a tax rebate off poker machine profit by donating money to causes that make a contribution to the \u201cwelfare and broader social fabric\u201d of the local community.\nFor poker machine profits above $1m, clubs earn a 1.85% tax rebate by giving funds to projects aimed at improving \u201cthe living standards of low income and disadvantaged people\u201d.\nBut that rebate is broken up into categories. Category one grants, which make up the bulk of money given to community groups, must make up 0.75% of the rebate.\nA second category, which can be a maximum of 1.1% of the profits, can be distributed to \u201ccommunity development and support activities and projects\u201d.\nThat definition includes NRL clubs and upgrades to club-owned buildings or facilities, provided they are not \u201cprimarily commercial in nature\u201d.\nThat means in many cases the largest donations often go to the clubs themselves \u2013 while receiving a tax benefit at the same time.\nThis year the Toronto Workers Club, near Newcastle, donated $779,474 to what it described as \u201cour local community\u201d under the scheme. Of that, about $65,000 went to charities such as the Cancer Council ($1,890), Variety ($2,000) and the Mark Hughes Foundation ($7,500).\nBut the vast bulk \u2013 about $713,000 \u2013 was spent on what the club described as \u201cdirect costs\u201d associated with the Toronto Bowling Club and Toronto Country Club, which it owns.\nWhen Ncoss raised its concerns with the state gaming regulator, it promised to do a review of the scheme.\nBut, as the Guardian revealed this week, it only conducted a \u201cbrief update\u201d of the grants, which did not consider compliance with the regulations, or consider whether clubs should be able to donate money back to themselves.\n\u201cIt was not the comprehensive review we asked for and were told would happen,\u201d Quilty said.\nYet the grants remain extremely popular among some community groups, playing a crucial role in bolstering the reputation of the clubs industry. In 2018, the then-ClubsNSW chief executive, Anthony Ball, cited \u201cleveraging\u201d the grants as key to establishing the sector \u201cas an integral part of social and economic life\u201d.\nMatt Noffs, the chief executive of the Noffs Foundation, points out that, without the in-kind donation his group receives from Easts, his service wouldn\u2019t have a home. His organisation is funded under a third category of the grants, through an in-kind donation.\n\u201cI think there are shades of grey. I appreciate that there is a debate on the moral position on gambling but does that mean the Noffs Foundation should give up our headquarters because 20 years ago Easts bought it for us? Forget about it,\u201d he said.\n\u201cDo you think if you change it and I have to go to [NSW premier] Dom Perrottet and ask for [the funding] it\u2019s going to happen? For all the crap clubs are getting, when governments didn\u2019t want to put their hands up to help kids with addiction problems, they \u2013 to their credit \u2013 did.\u201d\nWhile Noffs agreed there should \u201cabsolutely\u201d be transparency around the grants process, he also cautioned against what he sees as a \u201cmoral\u201d argument about the role of poker machines in NSW.\n\u201cWe can be fundamentalists about it and try to prohibit gambling but all we\u2019ll do is create a black market and send everyone online, where none of that money comes back to the community,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThere are parallels with the drug debate, which I know a lot more about, and I think the answer is the same \u2013 regulation over prohibition.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that we broadcast the club\u2019s name. It\u2019s on the building. However, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a correlation between having a name, talking about the Roosters, and promoting problem gambling.\u201d\nFor its part, Ncoss believes the grant scheme could easily be changed to exclude the clubs themselves from the decision-making process.\n\nUnder the guidelines, clubs with a tax liability of more than $30,000 in category one grants are required to establish local committees to advise on where money is given.\nBut in some cases, those committees either do not exist, or can be overruled by the clubs themselves. In one case, in Fairfield in Sydney\u2019s west, documents obtained by the Guardian show only 69% of applicants to the fund that were given a \u201chigh\u201d or \u201cmedium\u201d rating by the local committee received funds between 2016 and 2022. In the same period, 36% of applications given a \u201clow\u201d rating received donations.\nThere are also cases in which local councils are not involved at all, despite guidelines stipulating they must have a representative on the local committees meant to guide the grants. In Lake Macquarie, south of Newcastle, the council said it had withdrawn from a local committee eight years ago, in 2014.\nIn a statement, a spokesperson said the council left the committee \u201cas the time and resources required for us to administer the program outweighed the value-add we brought to the process\u201d.\nQuilty said: \u201cThere is no reason that, after collecting the poker machine tax, the NSW government couldn\u2019t administer the grants scheme itself without the direct involvement of the clubs industry.\u201d\nClubsNSW and the individual clubs mentioned in this story were contacted for comment."

                    "body": "On the third day of the trial of Bruce Lehrmann, Brittany Higgins wept. In full view of a packed courtroom, Higgins was watching the last recorded moments before she was allegedly raped on a couch in the office of the defence industry minister at the time, Linda Reynolds. The CCTV system at one of parliament\u2019s many checkpoints showed a young woman, intoxicated, struggling to put her shoes back on after passing through the security gate about 1.30am on 23 March 2019. On the screen, Higgins appeared to offer an almost apologetic smile, seemingly embarrassed for the delay she was causing as Lehrmann, a fellow political staffer, waited ahead of her. The camera appears to capture a hint of what her friends and family say they all remembered of Higgins from that time \u2013 a young woman full of life who, having found herself in the heart of the nation\u2019s power at just 25, now had the world at her feet. In the witness box, the contrast was stark. Higgins, in obvious distress, fought back tears as she watched those fleeting moments, which were played to the ACT supreme court over and over again. On Friday, as he announced he would not seek a retrial of Lehrmann, who has consistently maintained his innocence, the director of public prosecutions, Shane Drumgold, gave some insight into what Higgins had faced throughout the justice process. \u201cDuring the investigation and trial, as a sexual assault complainant, Ms Higgins has faced a level of personal attack that I have not seen in over 20 years of doing this work,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s done so with bravery, grace and dignity, and it is my hope that this will now stop.\u201d The strain was such that independent medical evidence suggested there was a \u201csignificant and unacceptable risk to the life of the complainant\u201d if a second trial was pursued. \u201cWhile the pursuit of justice is essential for my office and for the community in general, the safety of a complainant in a sexual assault matter must be paramount.\u201d The decision means Lehrmann, who pleaded not guilty to one charge of sexual intercourse without consent, retains the presumption of innocence. With no prospect of a retrial, he remains innocent of any alleged rape of Higgins. On Friday Higgins was in hospital, receiving treatment and support. Her close friend Emma Webster said Higgins had faced a \u201cdifficult and unrelenting\u201d two years. \u201cWhile it\u2019s disappointing the trial has ended this way, Brittany\u2019s health and safety must always come first,\u201d she said. Suppression orders were also lifted allowing media to report that Higgins had suffered a mental health crisis during her evidence, prompting a lengthy absence while she received treatment. Lehrmann is understood to be taking some time to process the latest developments. He has not made an official statement, but a friend told the Guardian he would be seeking advice on \u201clegal remedies\u201d in coming days.  Unique insight into power The proximity to power of Higgins\u2019 allegation guaranteed the trial would garner attention. In the words of the trial judge, Lucy McCallum, journalists were \u201cpractically hanging off the rafters\u201d in the public gallery. While the nation was transfixed on the Lehrmann case, three unrelated trials were running in neighbouring courtrooms of the ACT supreme court. All involved sexual offences against women. In one, a young woman was found to have been sexually assaulted in a local nightclub. In another, a sex worker was found to have been raped at her workplace in the industrial suburb of Mitchell. Another man faced court next door to plead guilty to raping a sex worker after robbing her at knifepoint in a Canberra unit. Such cases now account for the bulk of the workload for local prosecutors. The ACT\u2019s chief crown prosecutor, Anthony Williamson SC, told the Guardian that more and more cases were now proceeding to trial, a factor his office attributes to recent royal commissions and inquiries examining law enforcement\u2019s handling of sexual crimes. \u201cOn average, about 60% of the trials listed in the ACT during a criminal trial listing period involved allegations of sexual offending,\u201d he said. The Lehrmann case, with its high public profile, has made two things clear. It has clearly shown the impact the justice system can have on complainants. It has also provided \u2013 perhaps more than any other trial in recent memory \u2013 a window into how powerful institutions react when confronted with such allegations. It gave insight into the experience of those who challenge them \u2013 like the young woman captured on parliament\u2019s CCTV system \u2013 who say they are chewed up and spat out in the process.  The court had heard that Higgins felt she faced an invidious choice, something Drumgold had told the jury was a \u201cfork in the road\u201d. She said she could make a complaint, risk catastrophic media coverage for her minister and party in the lead-up to an election and put her career in jeopardy. Or she could stay silent, compartmentalise her trauma and carry on as if everything was fine, the court heard. Drumgold spoke of the \u201cstrong political forces\u201d swirling around her as she considered her options. \u201cWe say she was right to be scared,\u201d he told the jury in his closing submissions. Lehrmann\u2019s defence said there was no evidence of any political forces working to suppress the complaint. It suggested Higgins had fabricated the allegations, fearing she would lose her job after being discovered naked in the minister\u2019s office, and highlighted inconsistencies and flaws in her evidence. But Higgins said she was put under pressure from the start, during early meetings with her superiors, including one with Reynolds and her chief of staff, Fiona Brown, in the office where Higgins\u2019 alleged rape occurred. \u201cMy interpretation of that was that if I raised it with police, there were going to be problems and they wanted to be involved or informed,\u201d she told the court. \u201cBut just by having the meeting in the room, it all seemed really off and my interpretation of that was a bit of a scare tactic or an intimidation tactic, whether it was intentional or not.\u201d Drumgold asked: \u201cAnd what problems did you \u2013 was it your perception that they were communicating to you?\u201d Higgins: \u201cThat this could theoretically be perceived in the broader public sense as a political problem for the Liberal party with women.\u201d Both Brown and Reynolds denied putting any pressure on Higgins not to pursue the complaint. They also disputed the timing Higgins gave of when they were made aware of her rape. In the background, after an initial discussion with Higgins on 1 April 2019, police were preparing for a potential investigation. One of their first actions was to attempt to obtain CCTV recordings from Parliament House. They say they met resistance. The government refused to hand over the vision until a formal complaint had been made. Police were forced to make requests every six months to ensure that the footage was not wiped. Higgins, meanwhile, was disclosing her allegation that she had been raped to colleagues, friends and family. Prosecutors told the court she gave a consistent and unfaltering account of what she said had happened. The defence said she began complaining only after she realised her job was on the line. Even then, she said, the politics at play gave her pause during her conversations, including to those she deemed close, such as Ben Dillaway. The pair had dated and continued to speak often, including during the day after her alleged rape. But he was also a Liberal staffer, she said, with connections to the office of Scott Morrison. \u201cI didn\u2019t entirely trust him, that it wouldn\u2019t get back to one of his best friends, which is Julian Leembruggen, who was in the prime minister\u2019s office,\u201d she said. The court heard Dillaway, concerned at Higgins\u2019 mental state, eventually sought out Leembruggen, 11 days after the alleged rape. Leembruggen was not called to give evidence. \u2018Systemic culture\u2019 When Higgins decided to speak to the media, she said she did so for one reason. \u201c[It] was about this culture, the systemic culture in Parliament House that was so rife, is so rife and continues to be rife,\u201d she told the court. There are a dozen stories like mine.\u201d Drumgold asked: \u201cSo you wanted to bring out the issues of behaviour in Parliament House?\u201d Higgins: \u201cAnd how they keep these sorts of things silent. That\u2019s what I really was fundamentally going to the media for.\u201d In that vein, Higgins said she had to record conversations with two powerful people within Parliament House \u2013 her new minister, Michaelia Cash, and Cash\u2019s chief of staff, Daniel Try, to try to prove they knew about the allegation as early as October 2019. Both have disputed any such knowledge. \u201cI was trying to give [the recordings] to as many people as possible, to have them just so that they existed, because it\u2019s my word against a cabinet minister\u2019s and it\u2019s \u2013 the disparity between those two powers is ridiculous,\u201d she said. Higgins resigned in early 2021 and decided to reinstate her complaint with police. Even then, having removed herself from Parliament House, she said she was still terrified about whether political figures would be able to access details of her complaint. This, Higgins said, caused her to take a cautious approach to dealing with police, including wiping material from her phone before handing it over. \u201cI was pretty terrified on the basis that that week I found out the moment I had re-engaged with police \u2026 that politically sensitive matters that are within the remit of police gets reported to the home affairs minister,\u201d she said. \u201cPeter Dutton [the home affairs minister at the time] came out and said that he had the baseline information of my complaint before I even gave an evidence-in-chief interview. \u201cI know how information flows within the ministerial wing \u2026 I was very, very scared.\u201d In his closing address, Drumgold said the trial had made it \u201cabundantly clear\u201d that the political forces swirling around Higgins were still at play, more than three years after that night at Parliament House. Reynolds, the court heard, had been texting the defence barrister for Lehrmann, Steven Whybrow, asking him for transcripts and pointing him towards texts between Higgins and another of her former staffers that she said would be revealing. Reynolds denied allegations she was \u201cpolitically invested\u201d in the outcome and was trying to inject herself into proceedings, that she had discussed the evidence with her partner, or that she was attempting to \u201ccoach\u201d the defence during their cross-examination of Higgins. Cash also denied political motives while claiming she had no knowledge of the rape complaint in October 2019. \u201cAbsolutely not ... I don\u2019t know how it could be politically embarrassing,\u201d she said. Well before the events of Friday, Higgins had told the court that she had wanted to avoid the kind of media attention that had been attached to her trial. \u201cI didn\u2019t want it to turn into a media frenzy,\u201d she said, speaking of her caution in dealing with police in 2019. \u201cI didn\u2019t want it to turn into this.\u201d"

                    "body": "When Trent Alexander-Arnold and Harvey Elliott converted their penalties in Liverpool\u2019s flawless shootout they turned and pointed at a 23-year-old goalkeeper making the 17th start of his senior club career, and who just happened to be the calmest person inside Wembley. They shared the intuition that J\u00fcrgen Klopp had when deciding it would be Caoimh\u00edn Kelleher, not Alisson, standing in Liverpool\u2019s goal for the Carabao Cup final. \u201cIf it works out, then it\u2019s all about Caoimh\u00edn. If it doesn\u2019t work out, then it\u2019s all about me.\u201d The Liverpool manager was correct, although he could never have predicted it would work out with Kelleher scoring the 11th and final penalty before the supposed spot-kick expert Kepa Arrizabalaga blazed Chelsea\u2019s 11th attempt high into the Wembley sky. Kelleher was a prolific goalscorer for Ringmahon Rangers in Cork before trying his hands at goalkeeper aged 13. He has evidently not forgotten the goalscoring art.  If it was a risk selecting the inexperienced Republic of Ireland international over a goalkeeper that Klopp has labelled the best in the world, it never showed. Kelleher, a most laid-back character, made a crucial save from Romelu Lukaku at the end of normal time and held his nerve throughout. The first of what Liverpool hope will be four trophies this season was a true collective effort, with 29 players used in the run to the final including all three senior goalkeepers. Klopp wanted Kelleher to taste the high life not only as a reward for his impressive displays throughout the competition but to ensure his head his not turned by offers to play more regularly elsewhere. The final was therefore a resounding success for Liverpool as they secured a record ninth win in the League Cup. The final itself was a test of Klopp\u2019s improved resources. There were tears before kick off with Thiago Alc\u00e3ntara distraught on the bench having been denied a first cup final appearance for Liverpool by an injury sustained in the warm-up. In came Naby Ke\u00efta for only his 13th start of another disrupted season for the Guinea international, with the 18-year-old Elliott promoted to the bench in his place. The disruption to Klopp\u2019s plans felt sizeable. Thiago has produced arguably the finest form of his Liverpool career in recent weeks as Manchester City\u2019s lead at the top of the Premier League has been gradually eaten away. His passing range, vision and influence on Liverpool\u2019s rhythm would have been ideally suited to vast expanse of Wembley. Instead, the Spain international had to make do with a consoling arm around the shoulder from Alisson.  Early impressions from Liverpool\u2019s rejigged midfield were not convincing. Ke\u00efta was in a close confrontation with N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 and swarmed by blue shirts as the mobility of Kai Havertz, Christian Pulisic and Mason Mount exposed Liverpool in the early stages. The first of several glorious chances Chelsea squandered came when Havertz glided in front of Ke\u00efta in the build-up to Pulisic shooting straight at Kelleher from close range. A distinguishing feature of Klopp\u2019s team, however, is how quickly and effectively they address tactical problems and, as in the rout of Leeds at Anfield on Wednesday, an uncertain start soon gave way to a performance of control and menace. Ke\u00efta, Fabinho and Jordan Henderson forced Kant\u00e9 and Mateo Kovacic deeper, breaking the supply to Chelsea\u2019s marauding front three in the process, and suddenly it was \u00c9douard Mendy\u2019s goal being peppered with shots. Luis D\u00edaz\u2019s seamless introduction to life at Liverpool continued with a high\u2011energy, prominent display on the left. His willingness to track back and accept his defensive duties also endeared him to the red half of Wembley.  Liverpool lost some composure and creativity in midfield with Thiago\u2019s untimely injury but Ke\u00efta\u2019s willingness to support the attack brought Thomas Tuchel\u2019s team a different problem. That was underlined when Sadio Man\u00e9 found the midfielder arriving unmarked on the edge of the area and his low drive extended Mendy for the first time. Man\u00e9 would have broken the deadlock from the follow-up but for a sublime reaction save from the Chelsea goalkeeper. Ke\u00efta did not trouble the Chelsea defence again although he did settle into the physical contest with Kant\u00e9 and looked to release D\u00edaz at every opportunity. He was involved in the final\u2019s first exchange of hand-bags when catching Mount with an accidental elbow as the Chelsea midfielder attempted to counterattack. In the second half he was fortunate to escape a yellow card for catching the inside of Trevoh Chalobah\u2019s thigh with a raised boot. Ke\u00efta\u2019s number was up shortly afterwards when replaced by the veteran James Milner. An unexpected chance to shape an absorbing final had largely bypassed the \u00a352.75m midfielder. But not Kelleher. His contribution in the shootout may have come with a shot instead of a save but it was decisive nonetheless. Liverpool answered Klopp\u2019s call to enhance their trophy collection. There could be more for this buoyant team before the season is out."

                    "body": "It is a competition that gave Phil Foden the inspiration to name his French bulldog Carabao and one in which Trent Alexander-Arnold and Jude Bellingham made their debuts en route to establishing themselves as key figures for club and country. The Carabao Cup commenced at the start of this month with Cambridge United edging out Millwall, four days after the start of the Football League season and three before the Premier League removed its sunglasses, shook off its flip-flops and returned to our screens. That game at the Abbey Stadium went under the radar to most but it offered a snapshot of a trend that has seen a dozen Championship clubs exit the cup to lower-league opposition.  The games were played out, of course, as also with the FA Cup, amid a backdrop of changes to teams\u2019 regular starting lineups. For some clubs, it was a calculated risk that paid off. Blackburn Rovers, top of the Championship, breezed past Hartlepool 4-0 despite making 10 changes, with brothers Scott and Adam Wharton playing together for the first time, the latter making his debut aged 18. Others were left with egg on their face. Luton made 11 changes but came unstuck to Newport County, giantkillers in cup competitions in recent years who themselves made eight changes. Sunderland also named an entirely different team for their defeat to Sheffield Wednesday, who elected to make eight changes. On Thursday West Bromwich Albion host Sheffield United, with changes a given. Only six of the 22 Championship clubs that arrived in the first round will appear in the second, though three matches were games between division rivals. It is too easy to talk down the competition as the ugly duckling of English domestic football but the numbers suggest a more nuanced view is required. The 12 Championship clubs that exited at the hands of League One or League Two opposition made a combined 101 changes from their previous starting lineups and their opponents a combined 72. In fact, Cambridge of the third tier made more changes (nine) than Millwall of the second tier (eight). Charlton (eight to five) and Oxford (eight to seven) also prospered against Championship opposition despite making more changes than their opponent. The numbers are also skewed slightly by Morecambe, who stuck with the same starting lineup as they beat Stoke City, who made eight changes, on penalties. Sutton United were also unchanged but lost at MK Dons. For Morecambe\u2019s manager Derek Adams, it was a straightforward decision. \u201cI just felt at this point in the season it was important to have a bit of continuity,\u201d says Adams, who was reappointed in February. \u201cWe have players that have just come into us and players that have had only some of pre-season with us as well. If we made eight changes, we would be weakening the team and we can\u2019t do that.\u201d  For many managers, it is a chance to give others opportunities. \u201cYou can use it as an excuse to say that you\u2019re rotating your squad, you\u2019re giving everyone a chance and hide behind the fact that it is the League Cup and you\u2019re not going to win the competition,\u201d says Adams. \u201cI have done it in the past. When I see managers doing it at this stage of the season, they want to keep everyone happy in their squad and they want to say they [the players] have all had an opportunity \u2026 You can maybe feel that the league game on a Saturday is bigger. It\u2019s a difficult balancing act.\u201d The second-round draw has served up some intriguing ties. Stockport County and Grimsby Town, promoted from non-league last season, will entertain Leicester City and Nottingham Forest respectively. Fleetwood Town\u2019s reward for overcoming Wigan, who made wholesale changes, is the visit of Everton. Mark Hughes will pit his wits against Blackburn, where he played and managed, with Bradford City. Tranmere v Newcastle and Bolton v Aston Villa will be televised, which is worth \u00a3100,000 to each host club. For rounds three to five, television money is upped to \u00a3125,000. For most executives at smaller clubs the dream draw is a potentially lucrative away tie at a Premier League club given both teams take home a 45% cut of the gate receipts, with the remaining 10% heading into the competition fund. \u201cThe money side of it is very important, and not only for the football side of the business,\u201d Adams says. Some clubs simply have all eyes on the league campaign. Cambridge and Millwall agreed to bring the game forward in the calendar \u2013 as all teams were permitted to do \u2013 to free up this week\u2019s preparations. Others discount the competition on the basis of the \u00a3100,000 prize money, small fry compared with the FA Cup, whose winners receive \u00a31m. Many are wary of the schedule, with League One and League Two clubs guaranteed to play at least 51 games at the outset of the season. Morecambe face Fleetwood on Saturday before trips to Bolton, Oxford and Rotherham, the latter in the Carabao Cup second round, inside 10 days. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at nine games in the month of August which, in my eyes, is too many, so I understand why many clubs have made changes in these games,\u201d says Adams."

With Liverpool six points behind City in the league and still in the FA Cup \u2013 Norwich are their visitors for Wednesday\u2019s fifth-round tie \u2013 and Champions League, the manager was asked about Liverpool achieving an unprecedented clean sweep of trophies.  \u201cNo team in the history of English football ever won the quadruple, right? Because it\u2019s really difficult,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cWe are not even close to thinking about crazy stuff like that. We have won the Carabao Cup, we are behind City in the league and now we have Norwich in the FA Cup after 120 minutes on Sunday. Even Manchester City with all their quality did not win it. The reality is [that] to win something you have to be focused on the next step and the one after that \u2013 that\u2019s what we do. \u201cI don\u2019t see it as a compliment [if people think they can] but it\u2019s better people think we can do good things rather than be useless.

                    "body": "Antonio Conte has said that Tottenham\u2019s doctors ought to explain publicly why Oliver Skipp remains out with a pelvic injury as he betrayed his irritation over the midfielder\u2019s continued absence. Skipp last played for Spurs in the 2-0 Premier League defeat at Chelsea on 23 January and Conte said on 8 February that the medical department ought to have him back in two weeks, although he was putting pressure on them to make it seven to 10 days at most.  It is likely that it was wishful thinking on Conte\u2019s part. Skipp\u2019s injury \u2013 it relates to the pubic symphysis, probably a hangover from him playing 45 of Norwich\u2019s 46 Championship games while on loan last season \u2013 is in an awkward spot to treat. Skipp is similarly frustrated but he does not blame the Spurs medical team. The injury is healing \u2013 slowly \u2013 and patience for the 21-year-old and Conte has to be the watchword. Skipp will again be in the stands when Spurs host Everton on Monday night seeking to bounce back from their FA Cup exit at Middlesbrough. \u201cOliver Skipp, it is a pity,\u201d Conte said. \u201cIn England, I think that sometimes you should have a [press] conference with the medical department. It is too easy for the doctors to work here because they don\u2019t speak, they don\u2019t explain what happens, you understand? Sometimes I think that could be good \u2026 if, in two weeks \u2026 to have a good press conference with the medical department to explain about the situation that they are trying to take care of their players. \u201cSkipp is not ready. He\u2019s having this problem with groin pain. He is fighting. He could recover before but maybe something was wrong. And now we have to wait.\u201d  Conte said he was \u201cdisappointed and frustrated\u201d by the Middlesbrough defeat, although he did not give vent to his rage after the game, as he has done previously. \u201cOne thing is to be angry when we lose and another thing is to speak about my reaction and emotion,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are two different situations. To avoid this, I try to keep every time the same behaviour, the same way to face the press conference. It\u2019s normal that sometimes you\u2019re angry and other times you can face the situation in a different way.  \u201cTottenham\u2019s story is this \u2013 many ups and downs. To be competitive, the first thing that has to happen is to be stable. It\u2019s impossible for any manager to come in and change the story in one second, especially when this club for 20 years has this type of situation.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 7 March 2022. Skipp\u2019s injury is related to the pubic symphysis, a particular joint in the body, rather than being \u201ccalled pubic symphysis\u201d as an earlier version said."

Only one team can lose when Premier League meets non-league as Frank Lampard can testify. Everton produced a much-improved second-half display to secure a quarter-final date at Crystal Palace courtesy of Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n\u2019s second half double. The night, however, belonged to their opponents.\n\nThe National League side fell short in their attempt to become only the second non-league club to reach the last eight but, as their reaction to the final whistle illustrated, with players embracing each other and taking selfies, that was an afterthought. Boreham Wood defended impressively throughout and, while they never troubled Asmir Begovic in the Everton goal, it needed the half-time introduction of Richarlison to finally disturb their gameplan.\nGarrard said: \u201cWhat this group of players, the town and the community have achieved is fantastic. They were colossal all evening. It is just a shame we weren\u2019t able to trouble Asmir enough. The fact we have come to Everton and kept them to 0-0 in the first half is credit to the team. But they went up several gears in the second half. Anthony Gordon is frightening, such a talent.\u201d\nEverton have been a class act since drawing the non-league side, the Boreham Wood manager had said, with the Premier League club paying for their visitors\u2019 specially commissioned fifth round kit, taking care of travel arrangements and sorting their accommodation. The same was true of Everton\u2019s moving anti-war statement prior to kick-off too.\n\nUkraine international Vitalii Mykolenko, the club\u2019s January signing from Dynamo Kyiv, was named captain for the night by Lampard. He led out an Everton team draped in Ukraine flags, as were the players of Boreham Wood, and as the teams emerged onto the pitch the traditional pre-match strains of Z-Cars were replaced by John Lennon\u2019s Imagine. Both sets of players gathered behind a blue and yellow banner carrying a hopeful, poignant line from the song. \u201cImagine all the people, Sharing all the world.\u201dOutside, all MegaFon branding had been removed from the stadium following the suspension of Everton\u2019s sponsorship deals with Russian companies backed by Alisher Usmanov, the oligarch close to the club\u2019s majority shareholder, Farhad Moshiri, and who has been sanctioned by the EU and the UK.\nThe sombre opening gave way to a fiercely committed display from Boreham Wood and palpable frustration in the Everton ranks during the first half. The National League promotion chasers had started their FA Cup story with a 1-0 win at Barnet in the fourth qualifying round on 16 October. Eastleigh, St Albans City, AFC Wimbledon and Bournemouth had also fallen to Garrard\u2019s team en route to a prestigious date at Goodison, where their manager looked genuinely taken aback by the surroundings before kick-off. Garrard took a good look around the entire stadium, opening his arms at the size of the Main Stand looming above him, and accepted well-wishes from Everton\u2019s backroom staff and supporters during the warm-up. But he and his team were never overawed. Boreham Wood pressed immediately with a three-man forward line and caused several palpitations in the Gwladys Street end at Everton\u2019s awkward attempts to escape.\n\nThey were soon forced into a deep block, with a five-man defence protected by three in central midfield, and managed to contain their Premier League hosts with some comfort.\nLampard had seen enough aimless crosses and paid the non-league side the compliment of introducing Richarlison for the second half. \u201cWe needed another player to get behind their midfield line,\u201d he explained\n\nRond\u00f3n squandered an excellent chance when Jonjoe Kenny, switched to right-back following Nathan Patterson\u2019s substitution and Lampard\u2019s move to a 4-4-2, swept an inviting cross over Connor Stevens early in the second half. Rond\u00f3n, arriving in behind, headed dreadfully over from six yards out.\nThe Venezuela striker atoned minutes later, however, following more good work by Kenny. Receiving Allan\u2019s pass in space, the full-back steered a first-time cross towards the near post where Rond\u00f3n held off David Stephens to sweep a finish beyond Taye Ashby-Hammond. Richarlison had a goal disallowed for handball by VAR after Adrian Clifton headed Gordon\u2019s cross into the Brazilian\u2019s face, the ball then touching his arm before crossing the line, but Rond\u00f3n brought Everton the comfort of a second late on. Andros Townsend collected Gordon\u2019s short corner and floated a cross to the far post where the centre-forward powered a header beyond Ashby-Hammond, the ball crossing the line before the keeper clawed it away."

                    "body": "There will be no Henrik Stenson appearances on a Saudi Arabia-backed breakaway tour, for the time being at least. Confirmation he will captain Europe in the 2023 Ryder Cup came with assurances from the 2016 Open champion he will not play a part in the ongoing golf disruption scheme.  \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of speculations back and forth,\u201d Stenson said. \u201cI am fully committed to the captaincy and to Ryder Cup Europe and the job at hand. So we\u2019re going to keep busy with that and I\u2019m going to do everything in my power to deliver a winning team in Rome.  \u201cThe captain signs a contract. He\u2019s the only one that does. Players and vice-captains don\u2019t. But the captain has an agreement and those agreements are between Ryder Cup Europe and the captain, so I\u2019m fully committed to my role as a captain and working hard towards the result we want in Rome.\u201d The subplot, of course, is that when Stenson\u2019s tenure is over he is not bound by any such terms. But for now, the DP World Tour has held on to its man. Stenson, who beat Luke Donald to the post, becomes the second Scandinavian to captain Europe \u2013 after Thomas Bj\u00f8rn \u2013 and the first Swede. Europe will bid to reclaim the trophy in Rome, after comprehensive defeat to the United States in Wisconsin last September. \u201cWe\u2019re up for a challenge,\u201d Stenson said. \u201cI know my players are going to be up for a challenge. We saw a very strong American team at Whistling Straits. But we also saw that coming into Paris [at the 2018 Ryder Cup]. Yeah, we got beaten last time around but we also managed to beat the strong opponent in the past.\u201d Guy Kinnings, Europe\u2019s Ryder Cup director, offered Stenson the role at Sawgrass last Friday. \u201cAs we know, Mr Stenson also has a finely tuned, dry sense of humour, and we will be looking forward to the unique style he\u2019s going to bring to the role as he puts his own stamp on it,\u201d Kinnings said. \u201cBut we should also remember he\u2019s a ferocious competitor.\u201d Despite receiving a series of public relations blows recently, it is believed the Saudi plan \u2013 fronted by Greg Norman \u2013 continues apace. There is an expectation that a set of hugely lucrative tournaments, including in the United States, will be announced imminently. Should that transpire, there is scope for high-profile legal challenge to the PGA Tour\u2019s position that any player signing up with Norman can be banned from their circuit."

                    "body": "Did a teenager cheat to defeat the chess world champion? This question has thrown the chess universe into turmoil since 4 September, when its top player, 31-year-old Magnus Carlsen, abruptly withdrew from the $350,000 Sinquefield Cup in St Louis after a stunning loss to the lower-ranked 19-year-old Hans Niemann. Carlsen has not explicitly accused Niemann of cheating. But chess watchers gathered Carlsen\u2019s accusation from a cryptic meme he tweeted after the game saying he would be in \u201cbig trouble\u201d if he spoke \u2013 fueling wild theories, including one that Niemann cheated by receiving messages through vibrating anal beads.  The uproar continued on Monday, when Carlsen faced Niemann in an online game and resigned after just one move. On Wednesday, Carlsen gave a short interview in which he declined to explain his actions, but said \u201cpeople can draw their own conclusions and they certainly have\u201d. He intoned that he was \u201cimpressed by Niemann\u2019s play and I think his mentor Maxim Dlugy must be doing a great job\u201d \u2013 another apparent accusation, as Dlugy is a chess master who has been accused of cheating himself. Niemann denied cheating against Carlsen, commenting after the earlier game that the world champion must be \u201cembarrassed to lose to an idiot like me\u201d. But he admitted to cheating twice on the online platform Chess.com at age 12 and again at 16, which he said got him kicked from the website. The controversy deepened when the platform announced that it had banned Niemann again, citing \u201cinformation that contradicts his statements regarding the amount and seriousness of his cheating on Chess.com\u201d. But that move contradicts other top chess arbiters, including the Sinquefield Cup\u2019s organizers, who say they have analyzed Niemann\u2019s games and found no evidence of wrongdoing. So if neither the tournament nor Magnus is explicitly accusing Niemann of cheating, why do many in the chess world think Niemann is a cheat? Danny Rensch, a chess master and Chess.com executive, told the Guardian that chess watchers \u2013 from authorities to armchair theorists \u2013 aren\u2019t analyzing Niemann\u2019s performance correctly. \u201cIt\u2019s not anal beads. The problem is our position is so different in terms of how we look at it and measure things.\u201d  Rensch said his platform had developed an industry-leading anti-cheating model trained on a staggering trove of real-world game data from games played on its platform. \u201cWhat we did that really is different than any others do \u2013 and it\u2019s because we were a private company that was making money and were able to invest \u2013 is we went out and built what I would call DNA crime scene analysis for every chess player in the world,\u201d Rensch said. That means Chess.com has a highly detailed model of what legitimate behavior looks like for millions of users over hundreds of millions of games, which it can use to detect discrepancies. \u201cOnce in a while anomalies do happen. But if you have a lot of smoke, a lot of evidence, and a lot of reason to believe in the DNA of who someone is, and you walk into the room and they just say, \u2018I just lifted that fridge with one arm\u2019, you\u2019re like, \u2018Fucking bullshit, motherfucker.\u2019\u201d Rensch declined to elaborate on Niemann. \u201cI\u2019m not going on the record on anything that I think about the over-the-board scandal with Hans or Magnus, but you can imply what you want based on what I\u2019m saying,\u201d Rensch said. In forum posts this week, the Chess.com CEO, Erik Allebest, has hinted his company might soon release more information. That could help answer one of the central questions in this controversy: what\u2019s the best way to detect cheating in chess? It\u2019s important to understand how computers affect the game. The best human chess players are a mix of artist, athlete and scientist: they not only have the creativity and mental endurance to solve highly intricate problems, they also spend thousands of hours researching previous chess games and theorizing new lines of play. The problem is that modern chess software, called chess engines, have become so powerful and widely available that even the world\u2019s best players don\u2019t stand a chance against software that anybody can now download free of charge. For the chess industry, which is enjoying a pandemic-driven explosion of interest in everything from amateur online games to live streams of top masters, detecting cheating has become an existential challenge. Tanya Karali is the chief arbiter, or chess referee, of the Meltwater Champions Chess Tour, the online tournament that saw Carlsen\u2019s dramatic resignation this week. The main way that cup safeguards against cheating is through surveillance, she said. That includes requiring multiple players to set up multiple cameras that prove that they are alone without other electronics. \u201cAt random moments, we surprise players asking them to move around with the side camera to show the whole room,\u201d she said. The arbiters also ask the players to share their screens so they can see what programs they are using, and point the side camera at their ears to inspect for bugs. But the most important authentication tool Karali uses is a screening program employed by Fide, the international chess governing body. Ken Regan, a chess master and computer scientist, said he started developing the model in 2006 after a high-profile cheating accusation by Bulgaria\u2019s Veselin Topalov against Russia\u2019s Vladimir Kramnik in their world championship game. Regan\u2019s model analyzes the possible moves in a chess position and projects the probability that a player of a given skill level would make a move that agrees with top chess engines. \u201cThen, through what\u2019s really a human judgment process, one arrives at the final odds and decides whether they are extreme enough to reject the null hypothesis,\u201d \u2013 that is, the assumption of fair play. Because the software analyzes the moves of the game itself, it works on over-the-board games as well as online, where the cheating rate is \u201c100 to 200 times\u201d higher, Regan said. Sinquefield Cup officials asked Regan to run the program on Carlsen and Niemann\u2019s game and the results were unambiguous: \u201cI found nothing,\u201d he said. Regan\u2019s model showed Neimann\u2019s performance \u201cwas one standard deviation up\u201d on some metrics, \u201cbut by definition the standard deviation standardly happens\u201d. But that\u2019s led to an apparent disagreement between believers in Regan\u2019s model and those of Chess.com\u2019s model, which it doesn\u2019t seem can be resolved without more evidence being made public. \u201cIt\u2019s Chess.com\u2019s move,\u201d Regan said. The platform, he suggested, needs to \u201cdivulge or explain the reasons for their further action against Niemann\u201d.  This is just the latest installment in a decades-long drama over the role of machines in one of the world\u2019s oldest board games. Matthew Sadler, an English grandmaster who was ranked 14th in the world in the \u201cpre-computer\u201d age, left professional play in 1999 when he feared that the rise of AI would \u201ckill the game\u201d. He\u2019s now a researcher who has authored multiple books about chess engines. While he can occasionally outplay computers over a few moves, he says, there\u2019s no way to match the consistency of top engines. \u201cIn a game of 60 moves, the accuracy that engines have is just on a level that\u2019s completely impossible for humans to attain.\u201d Computers have an ability to perceive the totality of the game in a way that dramatically outperforms humans, Sadler said. \u201cEngines are just incredibly good at visualizing the whole board and finding maneuvers that, for example, use three corners of the board in order to redeploy a piece and achieve a winning angle of attack. When you see people at a weaker level doing that, well, they\u2019ve either had a moment of inspiration or there could be something a bit funny going on.\u201d Contrary to Sadler\u2019s fears, technology hasn\u2019t killed the game \u2013 it\u2019s made it even more popular. Chess engines have become invaluable learning tools for players: they pore over game databases and run scenarios through the engines, trying to memorize the most important variations. Because even the best brains can\u2019t memorize everything, the game has evolved into one of trying to throw your opponents off-balance with unexpected play. And for spectators, the engines provide a dramatic way to see who\u2019s winning games in real-time. Could it be possible for a human player to detect computer-aided play without sophisticated technological tools? Sadler says that being able to sniff out cheating comes with experience. \u201cIf an opponent has got a very complicated decision and is just taking a minute over it, whereas you\u2019d expect, well, any normal top player would take 15 or 20, then that\u2019s a little bit off.\u201d Other red flags: if your opponent seems \u201cunnaturally calm when the position is very tense\u201d, or \u201cif someone is going for suspiciously long walks away from the board\u201d. But these tells aren\u2019t foolproof: \u201cI once had a case like that, and it was just that the poor guy was having prolonged nose bleeds, having to run to the toilet all the time.\u201d As for Carlsen\u2019s accusation? Sadler says his experience leaves him in disbelief. While Carlsen is still clearly the world\u2019s best player, \u201cmy position still is that cheating at the top level just doesn\u2019t really happen\u201d, he said. \u201cThere\u2019s an awful lot to lose. And chess is one of those games where you dedicate our life to it and it\u2019s just a little bit hard to imagine the top players would throw that all away.\u201d"

                    "body": "Many years afterwards, Pep Guardiola would joke that the reason he never took over at Manchester United was because he couldn\u2019t understand Alex Ferguson\u2019s accent. The pair went for dinner in New York in September 2012, when Guardiola was on sabbatical and pondering his next move. Over a luxurious meal and fine wine \u2013 all paid for by Ferguson \u2013 they talked falteringly about football and life and the future. \u201cMy English is not so good,\u201d Guardiola later said, \u201cand when Sir Alex spoke quickly I sometimes had a problem to understand him. That\u2019s why maybe I didn\u2019t understand if I received an offer or not.\u201d  It got a good laugh in the room at the time, but the truth was a little simpler and a little more complex. Ferguson had indeed identified Guardiola \u2013 whose Barcelona had demolished United in two of the previous four Champions League finals \u2013 as the leading candidate to succeed him after his retirement and was keen to gauge his interest. But the plain reason no offer was made was because there was still no job to offer. Ferguson was yet to come to a decision or firm timescale on his own future. \u201cI asked Pep to phone me before he accepted an offer from another club,\u201d Ferguson wrote in his autobiography. \u201cBut he didn\u2019t.\u201d As the months ticked by, United remained confident of securing Guardiola, but without much idea of how they were going to do it. The club\u2019s chief executive at the time, David Gill \u2013 who was planning his own exit \u2013 and the owning Glazer family had essentially delegated responsibility for Ferguson\u2019s replacement to Ferguson and were loth to force the issue. They did not know if Ferguson was going to quit, when he was going to quit, who his successor might be or how close they were to getting him. It feels almost incredible now that perhaps the most important decision in the club\u2019s modern history was essentially taken in the dark.  Guardiola, for his part, had long since made up his mind. While Ferguson intended on making an appointment towards the end of the season, Guardiola wanted clarity much sooner. Bayern Munich had been in contact since the previous summer and had spent months diligently selling the project to him in exhaustive detail. Ferguson finally told the club of his intentions in the spring, by which point not only Guardiola but many of their other candidates were no longer available. The rest was history and not long afterwards so was the unfortunate David Moyes. Before Sunday\u2019s Manchester derby, United\u2019s abortive pursuit of Guardiola remains the great \u201cwhat if?\u201d, a genuine crossroads moment in the story of these two clubs. It also feels particularly pertinent right now, as City chase a fourth Premier League title in his six years at the club and United contemplate a ninth successive season without a serious challenge. The Guardiola dynasty may not rival Ferguson\u2019s for longevity, but for a club that has always prided itself on thinking two moves ahead, the issue of what comes after him feels of a similar magnitude. How soon is too soon? How late is too late?  City has been Guardiola\u2019s club since long before he arrived. It was in the autumn of 2012 they hired Ferran Soriano and Txiki Begiristain with the long-term ambition of luring Guardiola one day. A sparkling new academy was unveiled in 2014. A line of communication was opened with the Guardiola camp even while he was still at Bayern. An informal partnership was established with Girona, the Spanish club part-owned by Guardiola\u2019s brother, Pere. In many respects the entire organisation has been moulded around Guardiola\u2019s vision for a decade. So what happens when he finally goes? What changes and what stays the same? Certainly, given Guardiola\u2019s dazzling era of success, the urge for continuity will be strong. There is no reason to assume Begiristain and Soriano will immediately follow Guardiola out of the door. The existing City blueprint \u2013 a spiderweb of affiliate clubs, a world-class scouting system, a state-of-the-art training ground, a commercial strategy based around cashing lots of big cheques from Abu Dhabi companies you never knew existed \u2013 will simply be placed in the service of Guardiola\u2019s successor. The football will still be attacking and high-energy. Phil Foden will still do amazing things. In this respect, at least, City fans have little to worry about.  But then continuity was the plan at United, too. It is hard to shake the suspicion that Moyes\u2019s appointment was based at least in part on the fact he had the same accent as Ferguson. A playing squad badly in need of refurbishment was largely retained. The footballing infrastructure that essentially existed in Ferguson\u2019s mind was barely upgraded. To this day the pursuit of managers feels skittish, half-baked, reflex. For United, continuity soon morphed into stasis, retreat, nostalgia, chaos. City are a smarter and more functional club than United and will avoid many of these same mistakes. Indeed, given the protracted difficulty of securing top managers these days, it is entirely possible the club hierarchy are already beginning to identify potential hopefuls, whether Mauricio Pochettino, Brendan Rodgers, Julian Nagelsmann, Mikel Arteta, Patrick Vieira or somebody else. In any case, you suspect the process will be a little more sophisticated than simply letting Guardiola pick his own replacement and giving him as long as he wants to do it.  But the wider issue is one that engulfs all big clubs in these strange and stormy times. City under Guardiola and its Emirati ownership feel impregnable, immovable, unchangeable. But so did United once under Ferguson. So did Barcelona. So did Chelsea under Roman Abramovich who, in the space of a week, has found himself an outcast. As Ferguson discovered all those years ago, you can plan a pretty picnic. But you can\u2019t predict the weather."

                    "body": "Even now, with Wilfried Zaha deep into an international career with Ivory Coast during which he has appeared at three Africa Cup of Nations finals, it is a question to tantalise. Was he the one that got away from England? It will surely run through a few minds on Tuesday night when the 29-year-old Crystal Palace winger lines up at Wembley for Ivory Coast against England \u2013 the country for whom he won two caps in friendlies.  It will be a piece of history because no player has ever switched his allegiance from England and then returned to face them. Around the turn of the 20th century, there were two that transferred to England \u2013 Jack Reynolds from Ireland and Bobby Evans from Wales. Both had played matches against England and they would then win caps for them against Ireland and Wales, respectively. Five others have been capped by England and another country and only one of those is from the modern era \u2013 Declan Rice, who appeared in three friendlies for Ireland before going to England. Rice was an unused substitute for England against Ireland in 2020. Zaha, who was born in Abidjan and moved to south London as a four-year-old, made his decision to switch on 27 November 2016 because, frankly, he was sick of being overlooked by England. Capped at youth levels, Zaha was given his senior bow by Roy Hodgson against Sweden in November 2012. Playing in the Championship for Palace, Zaha was introduced in the 85th minute of a 4-2 defeat which was made famous by Zlatan Ibrahimovic\u2019s fourth and final goal in stoppage-time \u2013 the outrageous 30-yard overhead kick.  It was the following season that things became complicated. Zaha started the campaign at Manchester United and Hodgson would give him his second cap in August 2013; as a 75th-minute substitute in the 3-2 Wembley win against Scotland. Zaha had been a member of Stuart Pearce\u2019s England Under-21 squad at the European Championship in June of that year; they bombed at the group stage. And, with opportunity scarce at United under David Moyes, Zaha would find himself back with the Under-21s for the remainder of the autumn programme. By then, Gareth Southgate was the manager of the youth side. But after Zaha was loaned by United to Cardiff in the winter transfer window for the remainder of the season and continued to struggle, Southgate felt that he could no longer get him into his team. It was the beginning of a lengthy spell in the international wilderness for Zaha and, when Southgate got the senior England manager\u2019s job in September 2016 \u2013 initially on a caretaker basis \u2013 he would prolong it. Zaha\u2019s camp have said the player had decided to declare for Ivory Coast before Southgate\u2019s elevation while the manager has talked about the unsuccessful attempt he made to persuade him to change his mind.  Could things have been different if Southgate had pushed hard to name him in his first squad for the World Cup qualifiers against Malta and Slovenia in October 2016? There would also be the flare-up the following March when Southgate said that if a player did not feel \u201cthat 100% passion of playing for England, then I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s for me to sell that to you\u201d. Zaha\u2019s agent responded furiously, saying his client\u2019s desire or passion should never have been publicly questioned when he made his international decision. \u201cI remember going to a hotel and meeting with Wilf,\u201d Southgate says. \u201cBut at that point, he had made his mind up. I can understand it because he had been years without playing [for England]. My comments about players having to have the desire to play for England were tweaked a bit, I would say, so that created a bit of an atmosphere with Wilf and [the Palace chairman] Steve Parish for a while. That wasn\u2019t an insinuation on Wilf. You couldn\u2019t have a more passionate player.\u201d When Southgate first took charge of England, the wide attacking players that he counted on were Raheem Sterling, Jesse Lingard, Adam Lallana, Theo Walcott, Marcus Rashford, Andros Townsend and Alex Oxlade\u2011Chamberlain. His options have now evolved to an encouraging degree, taking in Phil Foden, Bukayo Saka, Jack Grealish and Emile Smith Rowe. But as even Southgate admits, Zaha is different to all of them.  \u201cRoy [Hodgson] had players who were ahead of Wilf for a long period and then we had my four games as caretaker where we were quite settled with experienced players and we didn\u2019t want to bring too many new players in,\u201d Southgate says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say what Wilf\u2019s role might have been with us. Raheem has been a key part of our team for a long period, Lingard had done a fabulous job and, at the start, we had Lallana, who was our player of the year for the first 18 months or so. \u201cWould Wilf get into the squad now? I don\u2019t know because he\u2019s a good player playing at a high level every week. He\u2019s a slightly different player to the ones we\u2019ve got. No one had a crystal ball in terms of knowing how that would have worked out.\u201d"

                    "body": "Sportswashing is not supposed to make commercial sense. Therein lies the reason that no normally functioning business saw fit to throw hundreds of millions of dollars at a disruption plan for golf. Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund (PIF) can attempt to rebrand a kingdom for which the murder of a journalist and human rights atrocities are typical reference points with the benefit of an apparently bottomless pit of cash. If the PGA and DP World Tours find themselves embroiled in a commercial long game with the Saudi-backed LIV Series, they know they will be outmuscled. Events of recent days did, however, serve as a reminder of what advantage players of a certain vintage have taken of Saudis bearing gifts. There is cause to ponder the point at which the PIF \u2013 which is by very definition answerable to somebody \u2013 reflects on the value of golfers who have slipped towards irrelevance. That day of reckoning will arrive. It is merely a question of when.  LIV understandably heralded the coaxing of Henrik Stenson from Ryder Cup captaincy duties. This was a body blow inflicted by Greg Norman against golf\u2019s anti-LIV establishment. The behaviour of Stenson and his representatives is dispiriting stuff; having agreed to lead Europe against the United States next year in Rome, he had a contractual obligation to stay clear of LIV. If the Swede and his management knew a change of plan was possible all along, or even used the captaincy to leverage towards that, they should be ashamed. If this chain of events took Stenson by surprise, there is a serious amount of naivety at play. In an incredible public statement, the 2016 Open champion tried to paint himself as a victim who was somehow edged out of the captain\u2019s role despite wanting to combine it with LIV appearances. What Norman, LIV\u2019s figurehead, will not want to focus on is that Stenson\u2019s on-course performances have fallen off a cliff. It is a triumph these days if he breaks 72. Since a share of ninth at the 2019 US Open, the 46-year-old\u2019s major record reads: T20, cut, cut, cut, T38, T64, cut, cut, cut, cut. He has not won since 2017. Stenson serves a purpose for LIV in statement terms but adds nothing in a sporting sense. And yet he will be guaranteed at least $120,000 (\u00a3100,000) for every tournament on top of a signing-on fee reportedly worth tens of millions. Stenson falls into a category that includes other LIV converts such as Ian Poulter, Lee Westwood, Phil Mickelson, Paul Casey, Sergio Garc\u00eda, Graeme McDowell, Martin Kaymer and Charl Schwartzel. Their best days are behind them.  Louis Oosthuizen was contemplating retirement before the LIV cheque was wafted beneath his nose. Brooks Koepka\u2019s major glory of 2018 and 2019 feel like a lifetime ago. Bryson DeChambeau\u2019s Open performance suggested tales of his demise may be exaggerated but injury has reduced his prominence. DeChambeau, like Patrick Reed, had cause to seek exit from the PGA Tour, which meant the LIV option was perfectly timed. Norman used media duties at the opening LIV event to admit he had waited three decades to mount a challenge to the PGA Tour. For him, this is personal. Finally, the Australian found an entity rich enough to fund his dream. Even better for Norman is that he is being paid an exorbitant salary to live it. The broader picture involves scenes of partying on a private jet. It includes Pat Perez appearing in a shirt with dollar-note design. There are agents, public-relations companies and caddies collecting small fortunes on the back of a model that serves no competitive purpose. LIV can make as many noises as it likes about potential broadcast partners, gambling openings and the sale of team franchises but the unavoidable current look is of opportunists who have used Saudi\u2019s golf ambitions to line their pockets. The rights and wrongs of taking that option can be debated but far more intriguing is for how long the PIF is content to provide such generosity. Should Mohammed bin Salman sense he is being taken advantage of the future will not look pretty for LIV golfers.  Validation of LIV\u2019s approach will come if, as has been speculated, it can agree a deal with the recently crowned Open champion, Cameron Smith. A fierce exchange between Australian broadcasters last week emphasised the scale of reaction Smith, who has a hitherto unblemished reputation, may receive at home should he take the plunge. LIV\u2019s need to add a player of such standing will mean an offer well in excess of $100m heading in Smith\u2019s direction. It is a deal that would earn ridicule in any other boardroom. The PIF has to ensure it is not the one being laughed at."

                    "body": "Emma Hayes is confident her highly successful Chelsea women\u2019s team will remain an important and properly funded part of the club once new owners move into Stamford Bridge. Roman Abramovich\u2019s decision to sell Chelsea has prompted concern that future support could be withdrawn from Hayes\u2019s squad but the manager does not share such worries. \u201cWe\u2019re fully embedded into this football club,\u201d said Hayes as she prepared for Saturday\u2019s League Cup final against Manchester City at AFC Wimbledon\u2019s Plough Lane ground. \u201cI know any future owners are going to want success for the club and the women\u2019s team are part of that.  \u201cYou hear about underfunded women\u2019s teams but there\u2019s no chance of that happening here or things going backwards. This club is invested in its women\u2019s team and I expect that to remain long and strong into the future. \u201cI have no anxieties or worries about our status. I know we\u2019re embedded internally. I know the relationships we have across the club; all departments are working on the same page and that won\u2019t change.\u201d Nonetheless Hayes acknowledged she had experienced more straightforward weeks. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long week for people at Chelsea, it\u2019s been difficult, of course it has; I can\u2019t deny that,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there are worse things going on in the world now. Nothing\u2019s more difficult than the horrendous situation Ukraine\u2019s going through. Yes, there\u2019s going to be some change and the position we\u2019re in is a challenge but we\u2019re not afraid of it.\u201d Hayes applauds stellar internal club communications that have helped her squad feel fully informed. Along with Thomas Tuchel\u2019s men, the women\u2019s squad have been briefed by Petr Cech, Chelsea\u2019s technical and performance adviser. \u201cOur level of communication\u2019s first class,\u201d said Hayes. \u201cChelsea people are amazing people in all sections and nothing\u2019s changed in that respect. While we acknowledge the club is to be sold, it will always be a significant force in the game. While we\u2019ll have a new owner, the culture whereby we all look after each other will remain. I think we\u2019ll continue to be hugely successful.  \u201cOf course uncertainty creates conversation and it was important we had a briefing this morning. It reminded the players of our strength and togetherness. Chelsea will remain a strong force because of the people involved here, which is part of the reason why we\u2019ve been successful Footballers know things don\u2019t remain the same. Having that ability to acknowledge change and adapt and evolve to it makes top-class players what they are.\u201d"

                    "body": "\n 1.25am  \nSummary\n\nThat\u2019s all from me, Samantha Lock, for now. Please join me a little a later when we launch our new live blog covering all the latest developments from Ukraine.\nHere is a comprehensive run-down of where things currently stand as of 3.30am.\n\nRussia struck Ukraine\u2019s capital Kyiv with missiles early on Sunday for the first time in more than a month. A railway depot was hit in the eastern suburb of Dniprovsky. Five cruise missiles fired from the Caspian Sea were launched from Tu-95 bombers, one of which was intercepted, Ukraine\u2019s air force said, in an attack that represented a change of approach on the part of Russian forces.\nA Russian cruise missile \u201cflew critically low\u201d over the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant, in the south of the country, at about 5.30am, apparently heading for Kyiv. Ukraine\u2019s nuclear energy company Energoatom said Russian forces \u201cstill do not understand that even the smallest fragment of a missile that can hit a working power unit can cause a nuclear catastrophe and radiation leak\u201d in a statement on Sunday.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin warned that Moscow will hit new targets if the west supplies Ukraine with long-range missiles. \u201cWe will strike at those targets which we have not yet been hitting,\u201d Putin told Rossiya state television, without specifying what those targets were. The comments were made in response to a pledge from the US went through with the delivery of Himars rocket artillery that the White House promised last week.\nUkrainian forces have counterattacked and retaken half of the city of Sievierodonetsk in the east of the country, officials said. \u201cIt had been a difficult situation, the Russians controlled 70% of the city, but over the past two days they have been pushed back,\u201d Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Gaidai told Ukrainian television. \u201cThe city is now, more or less, divided in half.\u201d The Institute for the Study of War, a US thinktank, also said Ukrainian forces were \u201csuccessfully slowing down Russian operations\u201d in Donbas and were making \u201ceffective local counterattacks in Sievierodonetsk\u201d.\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskiy visited his troops on Ukraine\u2019s eastern frontlines in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions as well as the southeastern region of Zaporizhzhia on Sunday.\nA Russian general, Maj Gen Roman Kutuzov, was killed in eastern Ukraine, a Russian state media journalist said on Sunday, adding to the string of high-ranking military casualties sustained by Moscow. There was no immediate comment from the Russian defence ministry.\nRussian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov\u2019s visit to Serbia has been cancelled after countries around Serbia closed their airspace to his aircraft, according to local media reports. A senior foreign ministry source told the Interfax news agency that Bulgaria, North Macedonia and Montenegro had closed their airspace to the plane that would have carried Moscow\u2019s top diplomat to Belgrade on Monday. \u201cOur diplomacy has yet to master teleportation,\u201d the source said.\nBritain is to supply long-range rocket artillery to Ukraine, including a handful of tracked M270 multiple launch rocket systems, which can hit targets up to 80km (50 miles) away. UK defence secretary Ben Wallace said the decision to ship the rocket launchers was justified because \u201cas Russia\u2019s tactics change, so must our support to Ukraine\u201d.\nSpain is also to supply Ukraine with anti-aircraft missiles and Leopard battle tanks in a step up of its military support to the country, according to government sources cited by newspaper El Pais. Spain will provide essential training to the Ukrainian military in how to use the tanks, according to the reports.\nNato kicked off nearly a two-week US-led naval exercise on the Baltic Sea on Sunday with more than 7,000 sailors, airmen and marines from 16 nations, including Finland and Sweden whom aspire to join the military alliance. \u201cIt is important for us, the United States, and the other Nato countries to show solidarity with both Finland and Sweden in this exercise,\u201d US Gen. Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said.\nA Ukrainian lawmaker, Yevhen Yakovenko, was detained at the Moldovan border at the request of the International Criminal Police Organization, or Interpol, Moldova\u2019s border police said on Sunday. Viorel Tentiu, the head of Interpol in Moldova, said in a statement that Yakovenko was put on the list following accusations from Belarus of bribery and corruption.\nRussia\u2019s sanctions against Gazprom Germania and its subsidiaries could cost German taxpayers and gas users an extra \u20ac5bn ($5.4bn) a year to pay for replacement gas, the Welt am Sonntag weekly reported, citing industry representatives.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 1.39am BST\n\n\n 1.08am  \n\nSpain is to supply Ukraine with anti-aircraft missiles and Leopard battle tanks in a step up of its military support to the country, according to government sources cited by newspaper El Pais.\nSpain will also provide essential training to the Ukrainian military in how to use the tanks, according to the reports as cited by Reuters. Training would take place in Latvia, where the Spanish army has deployed 500 soldiers within the framework of Nato\u2019s Enhanced Advanced Presence operation.\nA second phase of training could take place in Spain, according to the sources cited by El Pais.\nThe paper said Spain\u2019s defence ministry is finalising a delivery to Kyiv of low-level Shorad Aspide anti-aircraft missiles, which the Spanish army has replaced with a more advanced system.\nSpain has so far supplied ammunition, individual protection equipment and light weapons.\n\n\n\n 12.42am  \n\nRussia\u2019s sanctions against Gazprom Germania and its subsidiaries could cost German taxpayers and gas users an extra \u20ac5bn ($5.4bn) a year to pay for replacement gas, the Welt am Sonntag weekly reported, citing industry representatives.\nIn May, Russia decided to stop supplying Gazprom Germania, which had been the German subsidiary of Gazprom, after Berlin put the company under trustee management due to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\nSince then, the Bundesnetzagentur energy regulator, acting as trustee, has had to buy replacement gas on the market to fulfil supply contracts with German municipal utilities and regional suppliers.\nWelt am Sonntag reported that Economy Minister Robert Habeck estimates an extra 10m cubic meters per day are required, which would currently cost about \u20ac3.5bn a year.\nFurther costs arise from the filling of the Rehden natural gas storage facility which Habeck ordered on Wednesday, it said.\nThe paper also said the additional costs would be passed on to energy suppliers and end customers in the form of a gas levy from October.\n\n\n\n 12.23am  \nNato holds Baltic Sea naval exercises with Finland and Sweden\n\nNato kicked off nearly a two-week US-led naval exercise on the Baltic Sea on Sunday with more than 7,000 sailors, airmen and marines from 16 nations, including two aspiring to join the military alliance, Finland and Sweden.\nThe annual BALTOPS naval exercise, initiated in 1972, is not held in response to any specific threat. But the military alliance said that \u201cwith both Sweden and Finland participating, Nato is seizing the chance in an unpredictable world to enhance its joint force resilience and strength\u201d together with two Nordic aspirant nations, according to a report from the Associated Press.\nFinland and Sweden decided to apply to join Nato in May as a direct result of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, despite repeated warnings from Moscow against joining the western military alliance.\n\nAhead of the naval drill, which involved 45 vessels and 75 aircraft, the top US military official said in Sweden the host of the BALTOPS 22 exercise that it was particularly important for Nato to show support to the governments in Helsinki and Stockholm.\n\nIt is important for us, the United States, and the other Nato countries to show solidarity with both Finland and Sweden in this exercise,\u201d US Gen. Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Saturday during a news conference aboard the large amphibious warship USS Kearsarge, which was moored in central Stockholm.\n\nMilley said from Moscow\u2019s perspective, Finland and Sweden joining Nato will be \u201cvery problematic\u201d and leave Russia in a difficult military position as the Baltic Sea\u2019s coastline would be almost completely encircled by Nato members, except for Russia\u2019s Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad and the Russian city of St. Petersburg and its surrounding areas.\nThe United States has never before moved such a large warship as the 843-foot USS Kearsarge in the Swedish capital, where it sailed through narrow passages in the Stockholm archipelago, Milley said.\nAs Nato\u2019s close partners, Finland and Sweden have participated in the naval drill since the mid-1990s.\nVice Adm. Gene Black, commander Naval Striking and Support Forces Nato and US Sixth Fleet, added:\n\nIn past iterations of BALTOPS we\u2019ve talked about meeting the challenges of tomorrow. Those challenges are upon us - in the here and now.\u201d\n\nBALTOPS 22 is scheduled to end in the German port of Kiel on June 17. Participating nations include Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Sweden, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\nThese countries will exercise a myriad of capabilities demonstrating the inherent flexibility of maritime forces. Exercise scenarios include amphibious operations, gunnery, anti-submarine, air defence, mine clearance operations, explosive ordnance disposal, unmanned underwater vehicles, and medical response, according to an official statement.\n\n\n\n\n 11.50pm  \n\nRussian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov\u2019s visit to Serbia has been cancelled after countries around Serbia closed their airspace to his aircraft, according to reports.\nA senior foreign ministry source told the Interfax news agency that Bulgaria, North Macedonia and Montenegro had closed their airspace to the plane that would have carried Moscow\u2019s top diplomat to Belgrade on Monday\n\u201cOur diplomacy has yet to master teleportation,\u201d the source said.\nSerbia, which has close cultural ties with Russia, has fended off pressure to take sides over Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and has not joined western sanctions against Moscow.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and his Serbian counterpart Aleksandar Vucic agreed last month that Russia would continue supplying natural gas to Serbia, while other countries have been cut off for refusing to pay for Russian gas in roubles.\nSerbian president Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107 will address the nation on Monday night regarding the cancellation of Lavrov\u2019s visit to Belgrade, according to local media reports.\n\nUpdated at 11.56pm BST\n\n\n 11.21pm  \nZelenskiy visits troops on Ukraine's eastern frontlines\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskiy visited his troops on Ukraine\u2019s eastern frontlines on Sunday to understand the position of Ukrainian defenders as Russia\u2019s assault on Donbas continues. \nAccording to a release from his office, Zelenskiy visited command posts and frontline positions of Ukrainian troops in the area of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region and Lysychansk in the Luhansk region.\n\u201cThe president heard information on the operational situation in these parts of the front, as well as a report on the logistics of Ukrainian defenders,\u201d the statement read.\nEarlier in the day, Zelenskiy visited frontline troops in the southeastern region of Zaporizhzhia.\n\nOleksandr Starukh, governor of the Zaporizhzhia region told Zelenskiy that some 60% of the region\u2019s territory is under Russian occupation, with more than 2,700 infrastructure objects either damaged or destroyed.\nHumanitarian hubs have been set up in the Zaporizhzhia region to shelter residents of the temporarily occupied territories and settlements where hostilities continue.\n\u201cOver the last 15 days the largest number of people have come from the Kherson region. They also come from Mariupol,\u201d Starukh said.\nZelenskiy\u2019s office later said the president also visited a medical facility in the region and spoke with people forced to leave their homes, including from Mariupol, which is now in Russian hands after being under siege for weeks.\nHe promised action to ensure that all displaced people would be properly rehoused.\u201cWe will truly help you tackle this issue,\u201d the president\u2019s office quoted him as saying.\n\nUpdated at 11.36pm BST\n\n\n 11.06pm  \nSummary\n\nIt\u2019s 2am in Kyiv. Here\u2019s where things stand: \n\nA Ukrainian lawmaker, Yevhen Yakovenko, was detained at the Moldovan border at the request of the International Criminal Police Organization, or Interpol, Moldova\u2019s border police said on Sunday. Viorel Tentiu, the head of Interpol in Moldova, said in a statement that Yakovenko was put on the list following accusations from Belarus of bribery and corruption.\nRussia has announced that it destroyed tanks supplied by eastern European countries in airstrikes on Kyiv.

In the future, the temperature will rise, the water level will fall, and the water will be less.\u201d \nHe said that water being provided is \u201cvery conditional drinking water\u201d, which needs boiling.\nHe added that he feared illnesses could break out in the south-eastern city because of the amount of rubbish and dead bodies buried in shallow graves.\n\u201cWe expect cholera [or] any viral epidemic related to the gastrointestinal tract. As a result of unsanitary conditions, this can happen. The worst thing is that such a basic thing as dysentery in the current conditions and with the dysfunctional medical system, lack of drugs, lack of laboratories and everything we are used to, lack of vaccines in Mariupol ...

Sepia streaks were visible in the sky as rockers were fired at Russian army positions. \nAnother - or possibly the same - Smersh system was seen on Sunday morning on the road between Slavyansk and Bakhmut. Ukrainian army sources admitted their Smersh MLRS were older than the modernised version used by Russia, and had a range of just 40kms.\n There was no evidence this weekend that the advanced MLRS promised by the Biden administration had reached the eastern theatre. Armoured personnel carriers, ammunition trucks and ambulances could be seen on the roads, as well as battered civilian vehicles painted in military green. \nThere was also a spectacular 220mm 2S7 heavy artillery piece, nicknamed Godzilla. It was mounted on a long lorry.Doctors in Bakhmut\u2019s military hospital said the battle for the Donbas had become a grinding artillery war, seven weeks after Vladimir Putin abandoned his attempt to seize Kyiv.\n Most of the soldiers brought in for treatment were suffering from shrapnel wounds, they said, with relatively few bullet injuries.

                    "body": "A big, sad thing has happened in my family, the kind of shocking twist one never sees coming, where the only thing to do is retreat into metaphor for comfort. We stepped into a lift and we started falling. A rip opened in the fabric of the kitchen and suddenly we were in a hushed side-world of hospitals and rage, trying desperately to find our way home. We woke one day with a new language, one that hurt our throats to speak. If you\u2019re lucky and loved, when something like this happens, and you eventually tell your friends, they ask if there\u2019s anything they can do. Is there anything they can do? It\u2019s a really kind question. I know it is, I know it\u2019s always meant, and real, and I know these friends would love there to be a simple answer but, increasingly, my reaction to these kindnesses is an internal kind of violence. \u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201d You can take us back to two weeks ago, a Wednesday, and hold us there calmly in floating, bickering, biscuit-eating ignorance. You can go into your shed with a welding iron and invent two dystopic mechanisms of time travel which will allow us to move backwards rather than forwards, and then to sit with each other as if on a beach, in the moments, minutes and hours when everything was all right and everything was the old normal rather than this one, this desolate desert of gravel and bad news. You can find a little portal, so if we are forced to continue on this badly lit and treacherous timeline, we can at least do so without the added complication of little children and their feelings. Is there a portal (could you look this up online), is there a portal where our children can obliviously mess with Play-Doh and pens, and never have to know what\u2019s happening behind that door, and never have to see the adults cry? You can alter dawn. That would be good. Can you fix the nights, the hours awake from half past four, the stages of suffocating and circular thoughts, which we try to dilute in stupid ways which continue to defy evidence? Can you make morning come faster or night go slower? Can you transform sleep into water? Instead of this forest, this grim plod through the dark, please can you turn sleep into a hotel pool off season, where, on a lilo the shape of a croissant, we can emptily float? Here\u2019s what you can do \u2013 you can be perfect, please. That\u2019s all I can tell you \u2013 just respond to me perfectly. Just: be flawless. In your texts, on the phone, in the faces you make. I don\u2019t know what it looks like until I see its opposite, and I apologise in advance for the noise I will make. Sometimes I am happy to be distracted by the new problem with your sink or boss, but sometimes I feel as if I am too far away to hear it as words so it lands instead as rain or hail \u2013 you can give me a moment to translate. Rather than sympathy, bring me instead your best, richest gossip, a secret made of sex and betrayal with an accessible celebrity and ask nothing of me but a gasp as you remove its silver cloche.  I am made of crepe paper right now. I am made of gum. I can withstand only two things: gossip and perfection \u2013 liquids will destroy me, the wrong word will stick to my wrists and my chest and anywhere weak. But ha \u2013 if you avoid me of course, if you avoid this lumpen pain I\u2019m carrying in front of me as if a screaming baby, knowing how delicate I am and the flawlessness required, I will resent you for ever. There is no way to win, I\u2019m afraid, this is where we are, sorry. What you can do is stretch the internet to accommodate the depths I try every day to scroll, down through the grass of it, down through the earth, down through the roots of Instagram, hungrily looking for a diversion. While you\u2019re in there, perhaps you could put up a series of impenetrable barriers too, so that I am not confronted with past Google searches or old photographs, or other traps newly spring-loaded to cause pain. You can trick me gently \u2013 alternately load me with work and responsibilities and then, at my sigh, abruptly take it all away, usher the children over to the telly or call my boss, and lie me very still by a window to look at the wind. Time passes oddly in a crisis. Is there anything you can do? Once, years ago in hospital, there was a clock by my bed that didn\u2019t tick. Instead its arms would sweep forward to the correct position at two or three minute intervals, like somebody dragging themselves out of the sea. Now, a day will creep past, and a night will rush, and a weekend will slither over us wetly. It would be useful maybe, to see time at home pass like it does in those dense hospital hours. Can you get me that cursed clock? And if not, then fine, a lasagne."

Before we go, let\u2019s recap today\u2019s big stories:\n\nInterest rates have risen for a record seventh time in as many months, with the Reserve Bank hiking its key rate by 25 basis points to 2.85%.\nThe treasurer Jim Chalmers said it was \u2018another difficult day for Australians\u2019 and reiterated that inflation was the \u2018number one challenge\u2019 facing the country.\nThe robodebt royal commission heard some staff believed the scheme could not be \u2018defended in tribunal or court\u2019.\nThe employment minister Tony Burke said he doesn\u2019t want the Albanese government\u2019s jobs bill delayed as crossbench members push for a Senate committee deadline to be extended into early next year.\nEvacuations have been ordered and a series of road and bridge closures are also likely as areas of NSW once again face the threat of floods.\nAnd Gold Trip made light of inclement weather and an early-morning attempt to sabotage the track to win the 162nd running of the Melbourne Cup.\n\nThank you for spending part of your day with us, we will be back tomorrow to do it all again.\n\nUpdated at 8.10am GMT\n\n\n 7.42am  \n\nThe inquiry heard on Tuesday that Jones had met with several colleagues from within the Department of Social Services to discuss the DHS plan.\nIn an October 2014 email summary of a meeting, Jones and his colleagues agreed the proposal did not \u201caccord\u201d with the legislation and they could \u201cnot see how such [debt] decisions could be defended in a tribunal or court\u201d.\nJones told the royal commission he provided the damning legal and policy advice to Andrew Whitecross, who the inquiry heard was then acting group manager of social security policy at DSS.\nIt is unclear who else outside the team in which Jones was part of had seen the legal or policy advice. DSS lawyer Anne Pulford, who was involved in drafting the legal advice, will give evidence on Wednesday. \nDespite the misgivings with the Department of Social Services in late 2014, costings spruiking the financial benefits of the plan were worked up earlier the following year.\nJones said he did not know why these were created given the damning and legal policy advice held by DSS. \nAsked by the royal commissioner Catherine Holmes why he did not say anything to his superiors at DSS when it was clear the flawed proposal was going ahead, Jones said he was \u201cquite way down the chain\u201d.\nHe said: \n\nIt\u2019s not my role to raise [with superiors] a policy issue that\u2019s being pursued by another department. It was a proposal being put \u2026 together by the Department of Human Services. And I don\u2019t know their full justifications for pursuing it. I can indicate that I think it delivered savings \u2026 at a time we were trying to develop savings with the new government.\n\nThe inquiry continues.\n2/2\n\n\n\n 7.32am  \n\nRoyal commission hears some staff believed robodebt plan could not be \u2018defended in tribunal or court\u2019\nSome staff at the Department of Social Services believed the proposal for what became the robodebt scheme could not be \u201cdefended in tribunal or court\u201d and could deny welfare recipients \u201cnatural justice\u201d, according to an email aired at the royal commission.\nThe inquiry, which has been mired in legal argument over the release of documents, late on Tuesday heard evidence from Mark Jones, who was an official at the Department of Social Services.\nJones worked in the payment review and debt strategy team at the Department of Social Services until May 2015, shortly before the robodebt scheme was implemented.\nThe royal commission heard the proposal for the robodebt scheme came from the Department of Human Services (DHS), which was then responsible for Centrelink, and was the junior department under the Department of Social Services.\nIt heard the proposal was met with opposition from junior and mid-level officials within Department of Social Services, including Jones.\nHe had been asked by his superiors to obtain legal and policy advice from within the Department of Social Services following the DHS proposal.\nThat advice, the royal commission heard on Monday, cast serious doubt on the legality of the robodebt proposal.\n1/2\n\nUpdated at 7.41am GMT\n\n\n 7.24am  \n\nConsumer confidence in decline as interest rates rise\nFrom AAP:\nAn unexpected surge in inflation is weighing heavily on consumers and pushing confidence towards pandemic lows.\nThe Reserve Bank\u2019s delivery of a 25 basis point rate hike for November, taking the cash rate to a nine-year high of 2.85%, will likely weaken consumer confidence further.\nConsumer confidence has fallen for a fifth week in a row to levels last seen during the early Covid-19 lockdowns.\nThe 1.5% decline in the weekly ANZ/Roy Morgan index followed the September quarter consumer price index print that surpassed expectations to hit 7.3% annually.\nThe surprisingly high inflation figure pushed the \u201cweekly inflation expectations\u201d subindex up 6.6%.\nOther subindices of the confidence gauge were mixed, with \u201ctime to buy a major household item\u201d climbing 2.7% after three weeks of declines.\n\u2018Current financial conditions\u2019 fell 2.9% and \u2018future financial conditions\u2019 slid 4.2%.\nANZ economist David Plank said expectations of future rate rises were reflected in the 15.6% decline in confidence among people paying off a mortgage.\n\u201cCost of living concerns, along with expectations of more rate hikes by the RBA, have caused confidence to decline to levels last seen during the early weeks of the Covid lockdowns,\u201d he said.\n\n\nUpdated at 7.36am GMT\n\n\n 7.13am  \n\nWe have a bit more from AAP on the latest flood warnings for NSW\nEvacuations have been ordered and a series of road and bridge closures are also likely.\nIn Adelong, the main street is under water and residents in adjoining streets have been ordered to leave.\nAn evacuation order has also been issued for Tumut caravan park on the Tumut River amid rapidly rising waters and the threat of flash flooding.\nCowra caravan park on the Lachlan River is also under evacuation orders.\nMajor flooding is again likely along the Castlereagh, Gwydir, Namoi and Macquarie rivers after recent rain.\nThe BoM also expects major flooding on the Bogan River.\nThere are 90 SES hazard warnings current for NSW.\nThey include evacuation orders for residents along the Murray River at Willow Bend, Moama and Mathoura.\nAfter some sunshine to round off October, the state faces another rainy month as temperatures drop, the BoM says.\nShowers and thunderstorms were forecast across most areas on Tuesday, with creeks and rivers likely to rise rapidly as rain falls on already saturated or flooded catchments.\nThe cold front sweeping Australia\u2019s southeast will bring chilly temperatures, showers and alpine snow until midweek - all of which are unseasonal for November.\nAbove-median rainfall is forecast for most of eastern Australia over the next two weeks, increasing to very likely (more than 80% chance) for the northeast and far southeastern mainland.\n\nUpdated at 7.18am GMT\n\n\n 7.02am  \n\nLock The Gate warning famers after NSW approves seismic surveys on Liverpool Plains\nLock The Gate has released a statement warning farmers and koalas will suffer after the NSW Perrottet Government\u2019s decision to grant oil and gas giant Santos approval to conduct seismic surveys on the Liverpool Plains.\nThe government granted the approval, which will allow Santos to search for coal seam gas using \u201cthumper tractors\u201d today in an area located southwest of Gunnedah.\nThe area is home to a colony of koalas and University of NSW scientists recently raised concerns that the vibrations caused during the exploration process could negatively affect research underway on the efficacy of vaccines used to treat chlamydia in the endangered animals.\nMullaley Gas and Pipeline Accord spokesperson Margaret Fleck said the government\u2019s decision showed it was paving the way for Santos to drill across the world renowned foodbowl of the Liverpool Plains:\n\nSantos was never going to stop with 850 gaswells in the Pilliga - the very nature of the coal seam gas beast is that these companies need to drill thousands of wells in order to make a it worthwhile - just look at the pockmarked farmland of inland Queensland.\nMeanwhile, farms sink due to CSG induced subsidence, groundwater is drained and placed at risk of contamination, and both people and animals like the koala suffer due to the industry\u2019s greed.\nWe will face problems even at this early stage of exploration. Seismic testing is a disruptive process that involves ongoing vibration that will be felt in the homes of people who live along the route.\nThis approval is of course disappointing, but the Perrottet Government has clearly underestimated farmers in this part of the world.\nWe fought off Shenhua, we have fought off gas companies before, and we have no plans to roll over and let Santos trash the food and fibre powerhouse of the Liverpool Plains. We stopped Santos in their tracks just over a decade ago and we are determined to do it again.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 7.22am GMT\n\n\n 6.51am  \n\nNSW emergency services searching for two men missing in floodwaters, more rain forecast\nFrom AAP:\nThe search continues for two men missing in NSW floodwaters, evacuations are again at play in a series of communities in the state\u2019s south and yet more rain is on the way.\nThe pair are thought to have been riding in the back of a utility swept off the road while being driven across a flooded causeway near the South West Slopes town of Boorowa on Monday night.\nPolice say two others in the cab were able to free themselves and get to safety.\nThe search was briefly paused in the early hours of Tuesday morning but was ongoing in the afternoon.\nFurther west where Muttama Creek divides the Riverina centre of Cootamundra, residents have been directed to emergency accommodation at the local showgrounds, with dangerous flash flooding a concern.\nLocal member and NSW emergency services minister, Steph Cooke, told the ABC the order was for 10 streets and about 100 homes.\n\u201cThe weather event we saw come through from late yesterday afternoon and overnight has really caused some substantial damage and wreaked havoc right across the region,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long time since we\u2019ve seen flooding hit the town in the way that it did last night and so people were having to work closely with the SES.\u201d\nThe Murrumbidgee River at nearby Gundagai exceeded major flood levels (8.5m) on Tuesday afternoon, rising more than 2.5m in 24 hours.\nThe Bureau of Meteorology warns it could be the area\u2019s worst flood since 1989.\n\nUpdated at 7.03am GMT\n\n\n 6.29am  \n\nAustralian survivor of Seoul crowd blames loss of 151 lives on officials\u2019 failure to control crowd\nFrom the Associated Press:\nAn Australian survivor of a crowd crush that killed more than 150 partygoers in the South Korean capital of Seoul blamed the huge loss of life on officials\u2019 failure to employ effective crowd controls despite anticipating a massive turnout for the Halloween celebrations.\nNathan Taverniti, 24, said he\u2019s still grappling with shock after one of his friends, Grace Rached, died during the tragedy on Saturday in the nightlife district of Itaewon.\nStuck in a huge crowd, Taverniti said he didn\u2019t sense that something terrible would happen until some women near him apparently slipped and fell down, and people nearby tried to help them back up. By that time, he could no longer see where his three friends were.\n\u201cAll of a sudden more people started falling there were just too many people,\u201d he said.\nHe said he thought he saw some of his friends\u2019 hands among the people who were piling up. He tried to grab them, but had to let go after being crushed by the enormous weight of other people who were losing balance. He said he heard \u201clots of people screaming\u201d.\nTaverniti said he shouted to the bars and clubs to open their doors to let some people in to ease the crowd, but that nobody listened. He said several police officers arrived about half an hour later and people in the crowd helped pull out those who were injured before more officers arrived later.\nHe later found one of his friends among the rows of unconscious bodies laid out in the pavement.\u201cI believe 100% that this incident is a result of the government\u2019s mismanagement and the lack of ability because I have known that Halloween event has always been this big in Itaewon,\u201d he said. \u201cThis year there was clearly not enough police presence.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 6.46am GMT\n\n\n 6.17am  \n\nQueensland dugong survey starts\nJames Cook University scientists are in the air this week kicking off a critical Queensland-wide dugong population survey \u2013 counting dugongs along 2000 kilometres of coastline in under two months.\nLike a census, the surveys are conducted over an intense period every five years to get a snapshot of dugongs and calves\u2019 populations, from Cape York to Moreton Bay.\nJCU TropWATER\u2019s Chris Cleguer said Australia is home to the largest dugong population in the world, and the surveys are critical for monitoring trends in abundance and distribution:\n\nThese aerial surveys have been conducted for more than 30 years and are essential in not only estimating the current dugong population size but also mapping where dugongs are more or less abundant.\nThere are concerns about the decline in dugongs across the urban coast of the Great Barrier Reef \u2013 this year\u2019s surveys will give us the opportunity to understand the extent of this.\n\nHervey Bay to the south of the Great Barrier Reef, a known hot spot for dugongs, is an area of concern following a major loss of seagrass habitat earlier this year. The seagrass loss resulted from two flood events, which smothered the seagrass and destroyed the dugongs\u2019 main food source, Cleguer said.\n\nThe surveys will help us to determine how many dugongs currently are in Hervey Bay and the Great Sandy Strait as well as understanding their large-scale movements.\nIt is possible the dugongs have moved in search of seagrass to other nearby key habitats such as Gladstone to the north or Moreton Bay to the south.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 6.37am GMT\n\n\n 6.07am  \n\nEmployer group calls on Tony Burke to exempt some firms from multi-employer pay deals\nThe Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive, Andrew McKellar, has met the workplace relations minister Tony Burke today, putting employers\u2019 case that small and medium-sized businesses should be exempted from some of the changes expanding multi-employer pay deals.\nThe bill contains two streams of multi-employer bargaining:\n\nThe \u201csupported\u201d stream for workers in sectors such as community services, cleaning, and early childhood education, from which small businesses are not exempted; and\nThe \u201csingle-interest\u201d stream, which does include a safeguard that small businesses cannot be compelled to bargain together without their consent, even if their employees vote for it.\n\nMcKellar told Guardian Australia that ACCI \u201cput forward an argument that the threshold for small business should be much higher than 15 employees\u201d. If ACCI had its way small and medium-sized businesses could opt out of the single-interest stream, meaning businesses with up to 200 employees.\nMcKellar said employers \u201cdon\u2019t have a problem with the supported stream\u201d, formerly known as the low paid bargaining stream. But they are \u201cnot comfortable\u201d and believe the single-interest stream \u201cgoes too far\u201d and opens a \u201ccan of worms\u201d with \u201cno clear boundary\u201d. McKellar nominated sectors like retail, manufacturing and transport as those that could be affected.\nACCI also wants the test for whether a majority of employees support bargaining together in the single-interest stream to require \u201cmajority support in all businesses that would be involved in any agreement not just an overall majority\u201d.\nWhen employers\u2019 enterprise agreements expire, they should have a \u201cperiod of grace\u201d to negotiate a new deal before being included in multi-employer bargaining, McKellar said.\nMcKellar said that David Pocock\u2019s proposal to split the bill \u201cis a sensible one\u201d because it \u201cwould allow the government to secure the key measures that it wants\u201d this year, and save debate on more controversial measures for next year.\nBut Burke isn\u2019t a fan. He told ABC TV:\n\nThe problem there is a contentious [area], multi-employer bargaining, is a measure that precisely will get wages moving, and if you look at the areas of the economy that had been crying out for this the most it is areas like childcare, cleaning, areas like aged care, we are talking about those feminised sections of the economy, not especially militant, not areas of the economy that have done well out of bargaining over the last decade, they are the ones that have been crying out for multi-employer bargaining.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 6.20am GMT\n\n\n 5.56am  \n\nThe Victorian election campaign even stops, sort of.\n\n\n\n\n 5.43am  \n\nSupport for for national First Nations arts and culture body\nFake art, cultural appropriation, and the need to protect the intellectual property of art are among the reasons Australia needs a national First Nations arts and culture body, a report has found.\nThe Australia Council released the report, Bringing it forward, at the Purrumpa conference in Adelaide this morning.\nA national body could help with intellectual property issues for First Nations artists, including ways to fight back against imitators, such as a trademark.\nThose consulted had some concerns about how a national body would work, such as potential duplication of services, and how power and authority would be used, but the report found overall there was \u201csubstantial agreement\u201d that such a body was needed. It found:\n\nMany participants spoke of the national body as an agile \u2018facilitator\u2019, \u2018coordinator\u2019, \u2018connector\u2019 or \u2018go to\u2019 referral agency which could work both ways: acting as portal to First Nations arts and culture for industry and government; and helping First Nations artists to navigate existing networks and services and have their voices heard nationally.\n\nThe proposed First Nations owned, led and run national body has the working title of the National Indigenous Arts and Cultural Authority (Niaca).\n\n\nUpdated at 8.59am GMT\n\n\n 5.36am  \n\n\n\n\n\n 5.21am  \n\nJones says energy policy will reflect country\u2019s needs\nStephen Jones would not say whether we could expect an announcement on energy policy next week when parliament resumes.\nThe assistant treasurer said:\n\nThis is going to be determined \u2026 by the needs of Australian households and businesses, not the politics of parliament next week. You can be guarantee that the sooner we get these things knocked into shape, we\u2019ll be wanting to go out to the Australian people, because they deserve certainty. So do the businesses, by the way, and the energy generators that are trying to lock in gas contracts at the moment. It is in the interests of everybody that we get this right \u2026 that we get this done as soon as possible.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 5.41am GMT\n\n\n 5.18am  \n\nAssistant treasurer swipes at Angus Taylor\nThe assistant treasurer, Stephen Jones, is up next on ABC Afternoon Briefing and takes aim at the claim from the shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, that the Labor government doesn\u2019t have a plan to address the cost of living crisis.\nWhen asked whether households are currently having to bear the burden through the interest rate increase and other cost increases, Jones said:\n\nCan I put it to you like this: in budgets we have two choices. We can bring a meltdown on Australian households by cutting all the services and the expenditure \u2013 should we [start] with healthcare or medicine? Start with aged care, childcare? Where would the opposition or others like us to start?\nOr we could have a gentle part to ensure that over time we are bringing inflation down, not adding to the pressure; keeping a lid on spending, which is exactly what we have done. If Angus thinks we should be going further, he should say exactly how, because two days ago his boss stood up and gave the big tick to all the initiatives we have had in our budget.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.35am GMT\n\n\n 5.13am  \n\nMixed reaction to RBA rate rise\nPost 2 of 2\nThe ANZ, too, has retained its \u201cterminal\u201d RBA rate forecast at 3.85% after today\u2019s hike.\nDavid Plank, ANZ\u2019s head of Australian economics, said:\n\nThe RBA\u2019s updated forecasts have inflation above the top of its target band [of 2%-3%] for more than three full years, i.e. beyond the end of 2024. This must pose some risk to medium-term inflation expectations, and the possibility that they become unanchored.\n\nWe\u2019ll get to see more of the RBA\u2019s thinking, including its precise forecast for how high inflation will go when it releases its quarterly statement on monetary policy on Friday.\nAnalysts will be on alert to see how the updated forecasts compare with those supplied in the federal budget released by treasurer Jim Chalmers just a week ago.\nThe latter had CPI peaking at 7.75% and today Lowe has it reaching \u201caround 8%\u201d.\nGiven the government has dispensed with the traditional December release of a \u201cmid-year economic and fiscal outlook\u201d because of its budget \u201cre-do\u201d, we probably won\u2019t see government adjustments until its next budget in May. (Unless, of course, the news is really good, such as higher revenue from elevated commodity prices.)\nMore of the story is told here:\n\n\nUpdated at 5.43am GMT\n\n\n 5.11am  \n\nTony Burke says he doesn\u2019t want jobs bill delayed\nThe employment minister, Tony Burke, is speaking on ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing about the Guardian Australia report from late last week suggesting the Senate crossbench wanted more time to examine the secure jobs, better pay bill.\nCrossbench members wanted a Senate committee deadline extended into early next year from mid-November this year, but was rebuffed by the government.\nBurke said he was keen to provide whatever assistance possible to senators on the detail, but says he didn\u2019t want to delay:\n\nSo for the senators that are quite reasonably saying they want to make sure they can get across the detail, I want to provide whatever assistance we can, and helping them get across the detail. But certainly, I don\u2019t want for the families and households who are saying, wages aren\u2019t keeping up, I don\u2019t want to be in a world where we are awaiting a day longer than we have to in getting wages moving in Australia.\n\nHe said it was not his starting point in negotiating with the crossbench to split the bill into different parts. He also said he wasn\u2019t going to be intimidated by a reported $20m ad campaign from employer groups against the bil.\n\nIf they think they can simply buy advertising space and we will suddenly turn a blind eye to households, with wages not keeping up with standards of living, then they just don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening around every kitchen table in Australia.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.18am GMT\n\n\n 5.01am  \nMixed reaction to RBA\u2019s rate rise\n\nAs a sign some punters were betting on a larger rate rise, the Aussie dollar gave up some of its early gains for the day, easing to about US64.25c from 64.4c prior to the RBA news.\nStocks went the other way \u2013 also modestly \u2013 with the ASX200 benchmark share index cantering to a 1.1% gain for the day. Just before the rate decision landed, it was up just a tad under 1%.\nThe Greens finance spokesman, Senator Nick McKim, said, however, that the inflation was triggered \u201cby a pandemic, war and climate breakdown, and fuelled by corporate profiteering\u201d. The Albanese government should not be putting up with the series of rate hikes.\nMcKim said:\n\nThe RBA should have stopped rate rises months ago and should not have put them up today. And the government needs to get into the game instead of watching from the sidelines.\n\nMcKim, hailing from Tasmania, might be able to address his concerns directly if he attends a dinner speech planned by RBA governor Philip Lowe tonight in Hobart.\nOthers, such as Brendan Rynne, KPMG\u2019s chief economist, think the RBA is fully aware that there is a time lag between the rise in official interest rates and the hike being passed onto borrowers. (The full effect can be out to two years, Lowe has said.)\nRynne said:\n\nContinuing to rapidly push the cash rate above the neutral rate [of about 2.5%] reduces the likelihood of ensuring the economy is kept on an even keel during a period of contractionary monetary policy.\n\nKPMG has left its forecast for a peak RBA rate of 3.35% unchanged.\nPost 1 of 2\n\nUpdated at 5.10am GMT\n\n\n 4.51am  \n\nNew ABC studio in Parramatta will not cost taxpayers extra, David Anderson says\nThe ABC will set up a state-of-the-art studio in Parramatta at no extra cost to the taxpayer, ABC managing director David Anderson has told a parliamentary committee.Anderson told the public works committee:\n\nThe decision to establish a new bureau in Parramatta and relocate up to 300 ABC staff from Ultimo to Parramatta was therefore an obvious step for us.Today we are here to talk about boosting the ABC\u2019s presence and effectiveness in greater western Sydney. With 2.6 million people, greater western Sydney is Australia\u2019s fastest growing region. The ABC has of course always had a western Sydney presence, but the growth of the region and its increasing significance means there is a compelling case to make this even bigger.\n\nThe move will be paid for by the recent sale for $88m of an ABC studio in Artarmon.Anderson said the ABC had hired 60 new journalists in rural and regional towns on the back of commercial agreements with Google and Facebook following the media bargaining code legislation.The Guardian has reported the ABC received $12m for its news content from the digital platforms.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.02am GMT\n\n\n 4.42am  \n\nTaylor is asked if households should be offered some means-tested relief \u2013 he doesn\u2019t answer but says the Coalition had a great policy geared towards pensioners.\n\nThis government could have gone with a full-blown policy that allowed pensioners to do extra work without losing 50 cents in the dollar of their pension.

You look at Labor on energy and they still can\u2019t bring themselves to say we need to get more gas out from under the ground into the domestic network, because you\u2019ve got an energy minister who doesn\u2019t like the gas industry, has demonised it, has called it BS and fraud.\n\nReporter: Isn\u2019t that a state issue?\nTaylor:\n\nGetting gas out from under the ground is something we always took responsibility for. We worked with the states to do energy deals, New South Wales to get Narrabri opened up. We argued and debated and fought the Victorian government on their moratorium. We worked closely with state governments who did want to get gas out from under the ground.\nWe worked on the Beetaloo Basin. There\u2019s a number of initiatives there that Labor slashed in their budget, so you are not going to solve this problem without going to the underlying source, which is not enough supply going into the domestic network.\nRod Sims put it very well just the other day when he said you have got to get more supply into the domestic network that will drive down the price. Labor is failing to do that.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 4.50am GMT\n\n\n 4.36am  \n\nNow we are on to questions. He is asked what actual changes to the policy he would like to see. \nTaylor:\n\nWe have always had budget balance, that is a part of a fiscal strategy, and it must be part of a fiscal strategy, but there were basic things that we suggested over recent months, like getting more pensioners into the workforce, and they went with a half-baked version of that.\nWe don\u2019t need a toxic industrial relations culture when we are trying to ensure that we have a strong economy that will take pressure off interest rates and inflation, and yet they are rushing that \u2026 through parliament.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.40am GMT\n\n\n 4.34am  \n\nTaylor says Labor\u2019s budget \u2018a missed opportunity\u2019\nTaylor, the shadow treasurer, says the decision will exacerbate pocket pain for many Australians. He says there is no clear plan in the budget to help:\n\nInterest rate decisions by the Reserve Bank are of course made by the Reserve Bank, as it should be, but they are made within the context of government policy. And a great disappointment for so many Australians is that what we didn\u2019t see from the government last week in the budget is a clear and consistent plan that can take pressure off interest rates. It was a missed opportunity.\nThe Labor government has put up the white flag when it comes to interest rates and inflation, and Australians will pay the price for that. I stood here now six times in a row since I became shadow treasurer, each time saying what we need from the government is a clear and comprehensive plan to take pressure off interest rates and the nation. And my hope, and I think many Australians\u2019 hope, is that we would see that in the budget.

That means for a typical Australian household with a $750,000 mortgage, they will be paying $1,200 a month more than they were paying before.\nThat is a very significant increase they are paying for their groceries, for other household goods, and for fuel and electricity bills, of course. So this is a challenging time for so many Australians. The Reserve Bank statement was sobering.\nIt said that they expect inflation to continue to go up, to peak at 8%. That is an increase in what they had previously said, and they expect more interest rate increases to follow beyond today.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.37am GMT\n\n\n 4.32am  \n\nWe are now going to Angus Taylor, who is responding to the RBA decision.\n\nUpdated at 4.33am GMT\n\n\n 4.22am  \n\nTreasurer says Plibersek did not raise stage-three tax cut concerns with him\nThe treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has indirectly responded to a Guardian Australia report that the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, expressed personal opposition to the stage-three tax cuts to a constituent at a public event on Saturday.\nAsked if Plibersek had raised any concerns with him about the income tax cuts, Chalmers replied: \u201cOn your second question \u2013 no.\u201d\nPlibersek\u2019s office declined to comment when contacted on Monday, and Plibersek doesn\u2019t appear to have had any public events or commented about it elsewhere today.\n\nUpdated at 4.25am GMT\n\n\n 4.12am  \n\nWinning jockey says he feels \u2018like crying\u2019 as Gold Trip takes Cup\nGold Trip made light of inclement weather and an early-morning attempt to sabotage the track to win the 162nd running of the Melbourne Cup, as unrestricted crowds returned to Flemington Racecoursr for the first time in three years.\nEmissary came in second, with High Emocean coming from last place to claim third.\nAfter just 10,000 spectators were allowed in a year ago due to Covid-19 restrictions \u2013 and none at all during the Victorian lockdown in 2020 \u2013 a sizeable but soggy crowd watched as Gold Trip, trained by Ciaron Maher and David Eustace, galloped to victory over the 3,200m course.\nAsked to try and put his feelings into words, winning jockey Mark Zahra said:\n\nI can\u2019t.

And, of course, they\u2019ve stuck to this moderate course this month. (The US Fed is expected to go again with a 75bp rise this week.)\nWhat might tilt the bank to go harder again? Well, despite more than a year of wages increasing at a slower pace than inflation, this aspect of the economy is clearly in the RBA\u2019s sights, as is the behaviour of companies in jacking up prices.\nGovernor Philip Lowe said:\n\nWages growth is continuing to pick up from the low rates of recent years, although it remains lower than in many other advanced economies.\nA further pick-up is expected due to the tight labour market and higher inflation.\n\n(The jobless rate remains at near half-century lows of 3.5%.)Lowe said:\n\nGiven the importance of avoiding a prices-wages spiral, the board will continue to pay close attention to both the evolution of labour costs and the price-setting behaviour of firms in the period ahead.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 4.07am GMT\n\n\n 3.53am  \nRBA\u2019s rate increases match previous record\n\nWith today\u2019s back-to-back quarter point increases in the cash rate, the Reserve Bank signalled that it wasn\u2019t overly spooked by the September quarter CPI said.\nThe lift to 2.85% comes just over six months after the RBA started hiking during the federal election campaign, when the cash rate was at a record low of 0.1%. (Seems like a long time ago.)\nThat 275 basis point increase now matches the previous record spate of rate rises during five meetings in the second half of 1994.\nWhat\u2019s clear, though, is the RBA isn\u2019t done, particularly as inflation still hasn\u2019t stopped its ascent.\nPhilip Lowe, the RBA governor, said:\n\nA further increase in inflation is expected over the months ahead, with inflation now forecast to peak at around 8% later this year. Medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored, and it is important that this remains the case.\n\nHere\u2019s what it means for borrowers:\n\nMore to follow\n\nUpdated at 4.07am GMT\n\n\n 3.45am  \n\nInflation is \u2018No 1 focus of the government\u2019 \u2013 Chalmers\nThe message Chalmers is delivering is clear: everything will get more expensive before it gets less.\n\nHigher inflation and higher interest rates coming with it means that the pressure is coming on Australians from around the world, that it\u2019s felt around the kitchen table. That\u2019s precisely why we took difficult decisions in the budget, showed spending restraint, put a premium on what\u2019s responsible and affordable and sustainable.\nAs today\u2019s decision has shown, inflation is the No 1 challenge in our economy. It\u2019s the No 1 focus of the government. It\u2019s the No 1 focus when it comes to the budget that we handed down last week.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 3.58am GMT\n\n\n 3.44am  \n\nInflationary pressures \u2018will get a little bit worse before they get better\u2019\nChalmers says this is why the budget focuses on bringing inflation down:\n\nIt\u2019s more important than ever that the budget is responsible, restrained and right for the times. And that\u2019s what our budget is. We knew when we put the budget together that inflation was high and rising, and that was bringing with it higher interest rates.\nAnd that was putting additional pressure on Australians with a mortgage. This is precisely why the budget was designed \u2013 for dealing with these inflationary pressures, which will get a little bit worse before they get better, but they will get better in time.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.46am GMT\n\n\n 3.43am  \n\nInflation is economy\u2019s \u2018biggest challenge\u2019 \u2013 Treasurer\nChalmers says the RBA expects inflation to peak at 8% towards the end of the year.\n\nThe Treasury\u2019s expectation is more like 7.75%, but they have always said that the risks when it comes to inflation are on the upside, given what\u2019s happening in energy markets as a consequence of the war in Ukraine and given the upward pressure on grocery prices brought about by flooding of some of the prime farmland in eastern Australia, in particular. This is exactly why inflation is the biggest challenge in our economy.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.47am GMT\n\n\n 3.42am  \n\nTreasurer on interest rate rise \nTreasurer Jim Chalmers is talking now:\n\nThis is another difficult day for Australians, who are already under the pump.

On 29 October the Liberal leader paid to boost a post claiming \u201cyou are never better off when Labor has its hands on the budget\u201d, and a second one talking about \u201cincreasing financial pressures \u2013 in your mortgage repayments, insurance premiums, visits to the supermarket, filling-up at the petrol station and especially in your power bills\u201d.(Don\u2019t forget that the Reserve Bank started lifting official interest rates in May, under the former Coalition government, and that the Labor government has been excoriating the Coalition for delaying a report that power prices were set to rise until after the May election.)The second ad features a graphic of Dutton giving his budget reply speech, featuring the caption: \u201cYou have every right to be anxious and disappointed, the Prime Minister has broken faith with you.\u201dDutton is overwhelmingly targeting those Facebook ads at men and older women aged above 55; female voters under that age made up just 14% of the audience for the \u201cnever better off\u201d ad, and just 22% of the \u201cincreasing financial pressures\u201d ad.\n\nOf course it\u2019s not just the party leaders tipping cash into Facebook coffers. Coalition MP Jason Wood paid under $100 to boost an ad calling the budget a \u201cdumpster fire\u201d to around 5,000 people last week, while Labor MP Libby Coker also dropped less than $100 to promote a post saying the government \u201care going to do fantastic things\u201d to around 2,000 people.New Liberal MP Zoe McKenzie spent under $200 to boost an ad calling it \u201ca pretty terrible budget\u201d for regional Australia, while Labor senator Karen Grogan reached less than 1,000 people with a $100 ad saying \u201cwomen are front and centre of Labor\u2019s first budget\u201d.\nPost 2 of 2\n\nUpdated at 3.26am GMT\n\n\n 3.03am  \n\nWhat politicians boost on social media\nYou can often tell a lot about politicians from which posts they pay to boost on social media. While it\u2019s usually not hard to figure out which messages they\u2019re wanting to drive home or which voting demographics they\u2019re trying to activate, the posts they pay to show up more in your news feeds give us even more indication of which messages they think are winners and which voters they\u2019re trying to reach.\nFor instance, Anthony Albanese has just boosted his very first Facebook ad since winning the top job in May, paying for an ad asking Australians to \u201cfollow my page for more updates on how we\u2019re tackling the cost of living.\u201d\nThe boost, which was supported by less than $100 in paid advertising and ran for only one day on Monday, came just a week after the federal budget \u2013 which the federal opposition and some media commentators have criticised for not doing more to help cost of living pressures.\nThe ad was accompanied by a photo of the prime minister wearing a hard hat on a construction site, with the caption: \u201cIn Labor\u2019s first budget we\u2019re building more affordable housing.\u201d It reached less than 4000 people, and Facebook ad library data shows it was targeted slightly more toward middle-aged and older women.\nIt\u2019s only small money, and the ad ran only for a day, but it\u2019s interesting in that it\u2019s the very first ad Albanese has paid to boost since becoming PM.\nPost 1 of 2\n\n\nUpdated at 3.28am GMT\n\n\n 2.57am  \n\nHello everyone \u2013 this is Cait Kelly.

Information about joint exercises, including media days and those open to the public, will be released closer to the start of each exercise.\n\n\nThe spokesperson also said:\n\nThe US-Australia alliance is an anchor for peace, security and stability in the Indo-Pacific.

And how is it different to the interest rate?\nLuckily our wonderful multimedia team have you covered with a dedicated video explainer in Matilda Boseley\u2019s excellent news glossary series.\n\n\nUpdated at 2.28am GMT\n\n\n 2.08am  \nRBA decision on interest rates expected at 2.30pm\n\nAbout half an hour before a certain horse race in Melbourne, we\u2019ll get the Reserve Bank\u2019s latest decision on interest rates at 2.30pm AEDT.\nAs noted in an earlier post, the surprisingly large CPI reading for the September quarter made a rise in the RBA\u2019s cash rate a better wager than anything on four legs today. The main tension is how high will it go.\nAt the October meeting, the bank surprised most economists with a 25 basis-point increase that snapped a run of four \u201csuper-sized\u201d hikes of twice that in a row. In cutting the pace of rises, the RBA became the first central bank to ease back.\nBut after the inflation jump (particularly for the underlying inflation rate \u2013 the trimmed mean \u2013 that the RBA watches closest), there\u2019s a chance of something larger than a quarter point today.\nA 40bp increase would split the difference, with the advantage of creating a neater number. A figure like 3% is a lot rounder than 2.85% or 3.1%, although aesthetics probably don\u2019t loom large in the minds of the RBA board.\nEither way, we\u2019ll be matching or exceeding the 275bp increase in the cash rate during the second half of 1994 in terms of the fastest tightening by the central bank.\n\nAnalysts such as Catherine Birch, a senior economist with ANZ, will be alert to changes in the accompanying explanation by RBA governor Philip Lowe.\nWill it retain an emphasis about \u201ckeeping the economy on an even keel\u201d or revert to stronger language, such as the need to \u201cbring down inflation at all costs\u201d, which has been the tone of some overseas counterparts, Birch says.\nThe ANZ and Westpac both pick the RBA rate peaking at 3.85% in the first half of 2023.\n\nFor a typical owner-occupier paying principal and interest with 25 years on the $500,000 mortgage to go, the rate rises (assuming they are passed on) since May to the peak would add $1,059 more a month to repayments, RateCity says.\nToday\u2019s pain, in other words, is unlikely to be the last.\n\nUpdated at 2.21am GMT\n\n\n 1.57am  \n\nReporters battle wild weather at Flemington racecourse\nThe Melbourne Cup is going ahead despite some pretty wild weather, including hail and strong winds, which has left one ABC reporter, Stephanie Ferrier, doing battle with her umbrella.\n\nFerrier had earlier called the brolly the \u201cessential fashion accessory\u201d at this year\u2019s races while reporting on the unseasonable conditions:\n\nToday we are predicted to see the coldest Melbourne Cup Day since 1995, only getting up to a top of 14 degrees.\nThere is now starting to feel that windchill factor as well that is so commonly known across Melbourne, unfortunately. Here comes the wind as well.

In fact, I was thanked by Virginia Bell for both the timeliness and the comprehensiveness of the response.\n\nHunt said Morrison \u201cnever exercised\u201d and \u201cnever sought to exercise\u201d any of his powers in the health portfolio and \u201cnever even raised that option with me during the course of [the pandemic]\u201d.\nAsked why other ministers were not informed they shared their portfolios with Morrison, Hunt replied:\n\nLook, in terms of the other elements, that\u2019s not something which I have any knowledge. In terms of, you know, the public position, we\u2019ve shared the same advice with everybody, and that is it was done as a contingency. And the prime minister, when he announced the Biosecurity Act, announced that he was the co-holder of those powers under federal health.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what Hunt is referring to here.

Wiebusch says:\n\nThe Murray River at Swan Hill is likely to reach a major flood level later this coming week at 4.6m, and the bureau is continuing to do modelling and monitor the gauges downstream of Echuca, for that flood peak, so at that stage 4.6 is the initial indication of it reaching major at Swan Hill.\nWe have had SES volunteers, the rapid relief team, all working with local government and other community groups in and around Swan Hill with a major sandbagging effort and also door knocking.\nThe key messages that the main town centre of Swan Hill is not at risk, it is those areas immediately in and around the Murray River that are at the risk of major flooding later this week.\nMurray River at Boundary Bend is likely to reach a 8.8m by this weekend into the early part of next week. \nMildura at the Murray Weir is likely to reach a level of moderate flooding between the 10th and 12 November before it peaks at the end of November.\nBy the flows on the Murray River, we still have a period of time ahead of us were those communities will be at risk of moderate to major flooding in the coming days.\n\n\n\n\n 11.56pm  \n\nEchuca won\u2019t drop below major flood levels until early next week: SES\nTim Wiebusch from Victorian SES has spoken about the northern Victorian town of Echuca which has been at major flood level since last week.\n\nWe are still likely to see major flooding at Echuca well through to this coming weekend.

He told ABC News Breakfast:\n\nWell, look, I think that\u2019s a possibility. I mean, obviously, we want to have those discussions with the government. I\u2019m meeting with the minister later today, so there\u2019ll be a chance to put those ideas to him directly. Let\u2019s see what the government says. But what we\u2019ve got to do is I think is take the time on those other elements of the bill. We don\u2019t want to end up with unintended consequences that really could be very harmful to many smaller and medium-sized businesses.\n\nMcKellar was also asked about the Australian Resources and \u00adEnergy Employer Association\u2019s threat of a mining tax-style campaign against the IR bill.\nHe said:\n\nWell, certainly, there are very deep concerns across many sectors in our economy. And the resources sector, mining, and energy, those are very important sectors in our economy with very big projects. So of course, yes, they are deeply concerned about what they\u2019re seeing. My concern is more for small and medium-sized businesses, family businesses and the like, where they can\u2019t afford to get wrapped up in this sort of regulation and additional red tape that\u2019s going to add to complexity and make it much harder for them to manage their businesses.

It would be like the mining tax campaign but on steroids. That campaign cost about $20m.\nThe industry has got a history of, when they\u2019ve been poked, they will respond and there are enough corporate guerrillas in the mining, oil and gas sector who have come to me and said this is not on.\n\nKnott called for the resources and energy sector to be carved out from proposed changes expanding multi-employer bargaining.\nAsked about the possible campaign on Sky News, Littleproud defended adverse reactions to a bill he argued amounted to \u201cpayback to unions for helping Labor get into government\u201d. He noted comments from CFMMEU secretary Christy Cain at the jobs and skills summit who \u201cbasically said \u2018this is our time\u2019\u201d, and argued the union had been repaid with the proposed abolition of the Australian Building and Construction Commission.\nLittleproud warned Jacqui Lambie and David Pocock - who will likely have the casting votes on the bill but have asked for more time to examine it - that the government is trying to sell them \u201ca pup\u201d.

This is a model that will be familiar for those who have covered or indeed experienced the recovery efforts of the fires of previous years when we had these hubs in communities for some time, a centrepiece for people to ensure they can get the help.\nWe also know that many people, when they recover from a disaster event, may take time to think about what services they need \u2013 or, indeed, are distracted by other things before they might decide that they need to go and get additional help, whether it is financial or emotional support, for example.\nThese hubs will help people with limited Internet access and also support for cultural and linguistically diverse communities in relation to ensuring that they have access in the right information in the right way to ensure they know what support is available for them.\n\nMore about the full package here:\n\n\nUpdated at 11.24pm GMT\n\n\n 11.13pm  \nConsumer sentiment dims after budget and jump in CPI\n\nAhead of the RBA\u2019s expected seventh consecutive monthly rate rise later today, there\u2019s more news of weaker consumer confidence.\nThe weekly ANZ-Roy Morgan survey found sentiment sinking another 1.5%. Confidence among those paying off a mortgage was down 15.6% over the past six weeks, said David Plank, ANZ\u2019s head of Australian economics.\n\nDenting demand is what the RBA, of course, is trying to do. Still, the survey has found those who think they are financially worse compared with a year ago has now risen to 47%, or the highest in three decades of the survey.\nOne reason for the sagging confidence, though, is the jump in the CPI for the September quarter, where the annual rate hit the highest in 32 years at 7.3%.\nThat rate (and an even higher tally for non-discretionary goods of 8.4%) has also fed into higher inflation expectations, the survey found.\n\nThat spike to 6.6% was the highest since February 2011, Plank said.\nThe RBA governor, Philip Lowe, won\u2019t be happy with that reading, you\u2019d have to assume.\nAs it is, investors have lately been pulling back on their forecasts of how high the cash rate will go. Today\u2019s move is only moderately favoured as another 50 basis point rise to 3.1% \u2013 as a 52% chance.\nBut further out, they no longer expect the cash rate to peak above 4%.\n\nMost economists are also less hawkish, with a spread among the big four banks of 3.1% (CBA) to 3.85% (ANZ).\n\nUpdated at 12.19am GMT\n\n\n 11.10pm  \nTreasurer 'desperate' to avoid 'blunt reaction' from central bank\n\nSpeaking of the RBA decision, it\u2019ll be the first meeting since the Albanese government\u2019s federal budget was announced, so any decision by the central bank could be an indicator as to whether it thinks the government has got the monetary and fiscal policy correct.\nThis is what the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, had to say at a Business Sydney breakfast event this morning.\n\nIt was really one of those things hanging over every conversation \u2013 this sense that if you do get it wrong you can spook the market, you can provoke a blunt reaction from central banks \u2013 and that is what we are desperate to avoid here.\n\n\nUpdated at 11.12pm GMT\n\n\n 11.01pm  \n\nInvestors tip 52% chance of 50 basis-point rate rise\nGuardian Australia\u2019s economic oracle, Peter Hannam, has tweeted ahead of the RBA meeting today where a seventh consecutive interest rate rise is predicted in as many months.\nInvestors are tipping just over a 50% chance the rise will be a 50 basis point rise.\n\n\nUpdated at 11.03pm GMT\n\n\n 10.48pm  \n\nAussie firm turns classic cars electric\nAn Australian startup adding modern technology to classic Land Rovers will become part of one of the biggest electric vehicle conversion companies in the world this week after merging with an English firm.\nMelbourne-based Jaunt Motors will partner with Zero EV to create Fellten, in a plan that will see the companies operate across Australia, the UK and North America.\nJaunt Motors co-founder Dave Budge said the merger was not just about converting more classic cars with electric motors themselves but helping car owners and mechanics to make the switch too.\n\nWe\u2019re scaling up to deliver hundreds of units next year and beyond.\nAnd the biggest thing is awareness.

Will Victoria accept returnees?\n\nAllan:\n\nI was with the premier [Daniel Andrews] on Sunday at a at a media event\u2026 where the premier was asked this direct question and I\u2019ll give to you the answer he gave on Sunday which is these are very sensitive security matters. They are primarily the province of the federal government, it would not be appropriate -\n\nKarvelas:\n\nAs a matter of principle, will you accept them [in] Victoria? Or have you asked for them not to come during the election campaign?\n\nAllan:\n\nWe\u2019ve not, Patricia. There is a \u2026 As I think we\u2019ve seen from the media reporting around this issue, this is a very careful matter. There is a very -\n\nKarvelas:\n\nSure, but as a matter of principle, do you think returning citizens \u2013 they\u2019re Australian citizens \u2013 should be allowed to live in Victoria?\n\nAllan:\n\nI would really direct you to the federal government and the federal \u2026 I think you would appreciate that this is not a simple yes or no proposition because there needs to be robust and careful assessments that are not undertaken by the Victorian government. They\u2019re undertaken by the federal government and the federal Department of Home Affairs.\n\nKarvelas:\n\nAnd if they do all the checks and balances, should they be welcome in Victoria?\n\nAllan:\n\nFirstly it\u2019d be entirely inappropriate to cut across that and secondly, I am in no position to run a commentary.\n\nAnd that\u2019s when the interview ended for news time.\n\nUpdated at 9.39pm GMT\n\n\n 9.19pm  \nChina takes aim at US-Australian bomber plans\n\nChina has accused the US and Australia of escalating regional tensions with the plan to deploy up to six American nuclear-capable B-52 aircraft to the Northern Territory.\nOfficials in Canberra yesterday confirmed that the US-funded aircraft parking apron at RAAF Base Tindal, 320km south-east of Darwin, would be capable of accommodating up to six B-52 aircraft at a time but said it could also house other aircraft types. The project is now in the design phase.\nA spokesperson for China\u2019s foreign ministry, Zhao Lijian, said at a daily press conference in Beijing last night:\n\nAll countries\u2019 defence and security cooperation needs to contribute to regional peace and stability and must not target any third party or undermine their interests. Such a move by the US and Australia escalates regional tensions, gravely undermines regional peace and stability, and may trigger an arms race in the region. China urges parties concerned to abandon the outdated cold war zero-sum mentality and narrow geopolitical mindset, and do more things that are good for regional peace and stability and mutual trust among all parties.\n\nThe detailed plans were aired on the ABC\u2019s Four Corners program last night amid increasing concerns in Canberra and Washington about Beijing\u2019s own military buildup and its threat to take Taiwan by force.\nFor more on this story, see our news wrap:\n\n\nUpdated at 9.25pm GMT\n\n\n 9.16pm  \nFive 'evacuate now' flood warnings for NSW\n\nOvernight the SES have issued \u201cevacuate now\u201d warnings for Cowra, Willow Bend, Adelong, Boorowa Dam and Tumut Caravan Park, in addition to 400 properties evacuated in Cootamundra.\n\n\nUpdated at 9.25pm GMT\n\n\n 9.06pm  \nBetter data framework for NDIS needed to combat pricing concerns, commissioner says\n\nDr Ben Gauntlett, the disability discrimination commissioner at the Australian Human Rights Commission, on Sunday tweeted about the unit price paid to NDIS providers compared with what workers actually see in response to debate about the scheme on ABC\u2019s Insiders program.\nHe\u2019s asked more about that issue:\n\nWe need to make sure in this debate that we understand providers and participants do not necessarily have the same interests.\nWe need to be really conscious when we have the debate that we emphasise the outcomes for participants and the participants get value for money for the dollars spent.\n\nAsked if some providers are price gouging, Gauntlett says:\n\nI think there is evidence that there is some concerning behaviour in the market relating to pricing and providers.\nWe need to create a far better data framework that underpins the national disability insurance scheme. We need to measure outcomes better. And we also need to provide a lot of impetus to get a little known policy to become widespread, which is the national disability data asset. We need to be able to make invisible need visible and to track expenditure on outcomes to ensure that what we\u2019re getting is the best outcomes for people with disability possible.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 9.16pm GMT\n\n\n 8.55pm  \n\nBuilding disability policy system with layers will avoid cost blowouts, commissioner says\nThe solution?\nDr Ben Gauntlett:\n\nIf we build a disability policy system that has layers to it, that understands the interrelationship between local, state and commonwealth governments \u2013 most importantly understands the need for a whole of community attitude to improve in relation to areas such as employment, then that [$100bn per year] figure will not be reached, instead we\u2019ll have a disability policy system that\u2019s the envy of the world.\n\n\nUpdated at 9.08pm GMT\n\n\n 8.48pm  \n\nNDIS costs have blown out because it has become an \u2018island in the oasis\u2019, commissioner says\nSpending in the NDIS was identified as one of the top five fastest rising areas of government spending, with the budget put the scheme on track to cost more than $100bn a year by the end of the decade.\nDr Ben Gauntlett, the disability discrimination commissioner at the Australian Human Rights Commission, is speaking with ABC Radio this morning. He explains why the blow out is occurring:\n\nWhat has happened is everyone has relied on the NDIS to provide services, that being commonwealth, state, territory and local government.\nIt\u2019s become, for want of a better expression, an island in the oasis and what we need to do is to be really clear to build a framework where there is a disability policy system that has different layers to it, to support people in different ways.\nIn that way the cost will not necessarily reduced, but the expenditure will be as effective as possible.\n\nAsked about whether $100bn is sustainable, Gauntlett says:\n\nWhen we talk about sustainable, I also think we need to remember that we\u2019re talking about people. We can never lose sight of the humanity that underpins the NDIS.\n\n\nUpdated at 9.15pm GMT\n\n\n 8.39pm  \n84 flood warnings across NSW\n\nMore than 80 hazard warnings are current for NSW, as widespread rain is expected on already saturated or flooded catchments.\nIn the the Riverina, residents of Cootamundra have been evacuated with Muttama Creek is in flood, while Gundagai could see major flooding.\nResidents along the Murray River have been advised to seek higher ground at Willow Bend, Moama and Mathoura, as well as residents on the Adelong Creek, south-east of Wagga Wagga, which is a tributary of the Murrumbidgee River.\n\n\nUpdated at 9.07pm GMT\n\n\n 8.30pm  \nPublic servants to front Robodebt inquiry\n\nSenior public servants involved in the design and implementation of the Centrelink Robodebt scheme will appear before a royal commission into its failures.\nThe Albanese government initiated the inquiry into the scheme, which was designed under the Liberal-National Coalition to recover debt from welfare recipients.\nLawyer Anne Pulford and former assistant director Mark Jones, public servants within the Department of Social Services that oversaw the scheme, are due to provide evidence today.\nSenior counsel assisting the commission Justin Greggery yesterday revealed the department knew about the potential illegality of the scheme well before a pilot program was initiated.\n\nGreggery told the commission legal advice had not been sought from the solicitor general before the scheme was implemented. Instead, the departments responsible for overseeing the scheme had sought internal legal advice:\n\nThat advice raised significant questions about the legality of the scheme.\n\nHe said the advice raised concerns about the proposed approach by the department to determine a social security debt.\nIn December 2014 the social services department received advice that \u201cthe proposal to smooth a debt amount over an annual or other defined period may not be consistent with the legislative framework\u201d.\nSubmissions to the inquiry are open until February 2023, with a final report due by mid-April.\n\u2013 from AAP\n\nUpdated at 8.37pm GMT\n\n\n 8.26pm  \nGood morning!\n\nThe Reserve Bank is expected to increase interest rates for a seventh month in a row when it meets today. The cash rate is now 2.6% after it was raised a quarter of a percentage point last month.\nRBA governor Philip Lowe indicated that as rates go up, big hikes were less likely.\nThe decision comes on the day of the Melbourne Cup, an event for which the latest Guardian Essential Poll indicates enthusiasm is slipping with more than half of Australians uninterested.\nAmid growing support for the Nup to the Cup movement, the poll suggests almost half of those surveyed (45%) believe it promotes \u201cunhealthy\u201d gambling behaviour, with a third (34%) saying it normalises animal cruelty.\nIn more economic news, Australians home prices have fallen for six month in a row, with Core Logic\u2019s latest data showing prices fell 1.2% in October.\nThe second day of hearings of the royal commission investigating the botched Centrelink Robodebt scheme are taking place today with senior public servants involved in the design and implementation of the scheme to front the commission.\nAs more rain has hit NSW, the Riverina is being hit by flooding. Residents of Cootamundra have been issued with evacuation orders after the Muttama Creek is in flood while major flooding is possible at Gundagai.\nThe Victorian government goes into caretaker mode at 6pm tonight ahead of the state election. That means it can no longer make major policy decisions, sign contracts or make significant appointments during this period.\nLet\u2019s kick off!\n\nUpdated at 8.29pm GMT\n"

                    "body": "To keep the climate habitable, most scientists agree that switching to renewable energy alone isn\u2019t enough \u2013 Americans also need to change the way they eat. Environmental and public health advocates are pushing a new strategy to help get there: including climate breakdown in the official US dietary guidelines, which shape what goes into billions of meals eaten across the country every year. Every five years, the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Health and Human Services jointly publish a new version of the guidelines. They form the basis for the public-facing eating guide MyPlate, formerly MyPyramid, as well as many government-backed meal programs, such as National School Lunch. Historically, these guidelines have narrowly focused on human nutrition, but some are now saying they should be expanded to incorporate climate considerations as well. The current, 150-page edition for 2020-2025 doesn\u2019t mention food\u2019s role in the climate crisis at all. Climate groups say this is an abdication of responsibility, with Americans feeling the effects of a warming planet more than ever. The recently passed Inflation Reduction Act, the most significant climate legislation in US history, does very little to address the food system. \u201cClimate change poses a multitude of threats to human health and nutrition security. We cannot extricate these things from each other,\u201d said Jessi Silverman, a senior policy associate for the Center for Science in the Public Interest. Her group and 39 others, including the Union of Concerned Scientists and the American Academy of Pediatrics, in May wrote a letter urging the government to include sustainability in the 2025-2030 dietary guidelines, which are now in development. A sustainability component would encourage Americans to eat less meat and dairy, which have a significantly higher climate impact than nutritionally comparable plant-based foods. \u201cIt would be virtually impossible to even meet the two-degree [Celsius] limit in global temperature change without incorporating substantial reductions in beef intake,\u201d said Mark Rifkin, senior food and agriculture policy specialist for the Center for Biological Diversity, another signatory to the letter.  The current guidelines advise Americans to eat far more animal products than is sustainable, said Walter Willett, a professor at Harvard\u2019s School of Public Health. The primary dietary chart recommends 26 ounces of protein from meat, poultry and eggs a week, compared with just 5 ounces from plant-based foods, although there are alternative charts that show how vegetarians can get the same nutrients without meat. They also \u201cstill basically say three servings of dairy a day, which is actually really radical because our current consumption is 1.6 servings a day\u201d, he said. \u201cTo just recommend three servings of dairy and say nothing about the environmental consequences if people really did that is just completely irresponsible.\u201d Because most Americans are deficient in fiber and fruits and vegetables, not animal products, Rifkin, a dietitian, said climate-focused guidance would line up with what the public needs nutritionally. It would also help address other problems that stem from the meat-heavy US food system, he said, including risk of future pandemics, food security and pollution from concentrated animal feeding operations, which disproportionately affects communities of color. A proposed list of questions released in April for the scientific panel that advises the guidelines didn\u2019t include sustainability. That worries advocates, but they say it\u2019s still early. Janet de Jesus, HHS\u2019s staff lead on the guidelines, said sustainability could still be included. \u201cWe\u2019re not saying that it\u2019s not going to be in the dietary guidelines \u2013 we\u2019re not saying that at all,\u201d de Jesus said. \u201cIt\u2019s a high priority for HHS leadership to address climate change.\u201d Countries including Germany, Brazil, Sweden and Qatar have addressed sustainability in their dietary guidelines, according to a UN Food and Agriculture Organization report. Canada\u2019s Food Guide advises choosing plant-based foods more often for the environment. Germany has cut its per-capita meat consumption by 12% since 2011, Vox reported last month, and its minister of food and agriculture has recently prioritized a shift toward more plant-based eating. Advocates say a change in the US dietary guidelines could have a similar influence. \u201cThe guidelines are much more impactful than I think a lot of people realize,\u201d Silverman said. Federal food aid programs have to comply with the guidelines, shaping how millions of people eat. The National School Lunch and National School Breakfast, for instance, served more than 7bn meals a year to tens of millions of children before the Covid-19 pandemic. The guidelines also influence cafeteria food served in government buildings, hospitals and other institutions, and are used in nutrition education programs. National School Lunch\u2019s reach makes it \u201cuniquely positioned to affect the dietary patterns of American children and adolescents and could aid in addressing the environmental impacts of food systems\u201d, according to a recent paper in Communications Earth &amp; Environment. Meat contributes disproportionately to school meals\u2019 impact on the climate, as well as land and water use. Because government programs and other large institutions serve so many meals, sustainability advocates in recent years have focused on trying to influence their food buying decisions. California earlier this year allocated $100m to help schools serve more plant-based meals. This isn\u2019t the first time the environment has been at issue in the nation\u2019s dietary guidelines. In 2015, the government-appointed panel of nutrition experts that advised the 2015-2020 guidelines addressed sustainability in its scientific report. \u201cIn general, a dietary pattern that is higher in plant-based foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, and lower in animal-based foods is more health promoting and is associated with lesser environmental impact,\u201d the panel wrote. But after outcry from the meat industry and Republican lawmakers, the recommendation to eat more plants was dropped from the final guidelines. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal at the time, the USDA secretary, Tom Vilsack, said sustainability was outside the purview of the dietary guidelines and compared the scientific committee to his granddaughter who \u201ccolors outside of the lines\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s really condescending stuff,\u201d said Bob Martin, of the Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future, about Vilsack\u2019s comments. \u201cThe people involved in this were highly qualified.\u201d Agribusiness has a long history of influence over the dietary guidelines, and it will undoubtedly be a factor this time around, too. The meat and dairy industries spent $49.5m on political contributions in 2020, and another $15.9m lobbying the federal government. Food industry groups also routinely report lobbying on federal nutrition policy. The National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association between 2014 and 2016 spent more than $303,000 lobbying to keep beef in the dietary guidelines, according to federal lobbying records. Several industry groups, including the North American Meat Institute, the International Dairy Foods Association and the National Turkey Federation, have already weighed in on the process for the 2025-2030 guidance. \u201c[W]hile an important topic, sustainability is outside the scope of the Dietary Guidelines,\u201d the National Pork Producers Council wrote in a public comment in May. Even though environmental advocates face an uphill battle, a lot has changed since the failed 2015 effort to incorporate sustainability, said Jessi Silverman of the Center for Science in the Public Interest. \u201cI think the public pressure to have concrete policies to address climate change has grown a lot in the years since then.\u201d"

                    "body": "The hymns were still playing and the sermons were still being read, but the cathedral was in flames. The Parc des Princes, this monument to glory and desire, the place where you go to see your fantasies made flesh, was in revolt. They were watching Paris Saint-Germain, their team, rip Bordeaux to shreds with perhaps the most preposterously dazzling front three in the history of football. And they were furious about it. Lionel Messi was booed, by many of the same fans who lined the streets to celebrate his arrival in August. Neymar was booed when he scored and cheered when he missed. It was profane and it was shocking and maybe that was the point. \u201cWe understand their disappointment, we understand their hatred,\u201d the PSG centre-half Presnel Kimpembe said. \u201cNow we must move forward in order to win Ligue 1.\u201d  The immediate assumption was that this was a sort of acid reflux, an intestinal reaction to the Champions League defeat against Real Madrid in midweek. On social media, fans of other clubs brandished their tiny violins. Fifteen points clear in Ligue 1, close to an eighth title in 10 seasons and with a front-row seat to the greatest show in world football. Maybe, you know, grow up? But Paris has been at war with itself for a while now, for reasons that go far deeper than one second-half capitulation. Last month, the fan group Collectif Ultras Paris organised a picket of the fixture against Rennes, denouncing the Qatari owners, the sporting director, Leonardo, and even the head of communications. There were demands to \u201crespect the women\u2019s team.\u201d One banner even referenced the revolutionary reign of terror: \u201cToo many useless heads! Robespierre, where are you?\u201d And people say this club has no sense of history. Watching from the directors\u2019 box on Sunday was Nasser Al-Khelaifi, the club president who, since 2011, has spent more than \u00a31bn in transfer fees and overseen the most successful era in PSG\u2019s history. As the team he built was pilloried, it was possible to picture his puzzlement. Hang on. I bought you Messi, Neymar, Mbapp\u00e9, Ibrahimovic, Cavani, Dani Alves. What more, exactly, do you want? Of course, Paris fans have told Khelaifi exactly what they want. In a statement by the Collectif last week, they asked him: \u201cHow can you want to change everything for the people of Paris when you\u2019re more often seen at Fashion Week than meeting with your own fans?\u201d They demanded his resignation \u201cin the greater interest of a club; not a brand, not a marketing product. Our club!\u201d  Kimpembe may have claimed to understand the fans\u2019 anger, but his Ligue 1 comment betrayed the fact he hadn\u2019t a clue. Paris are 15 points clear of Marseille. Silverware isn\u2019t the problem here. The ultras\u2019 statement didn\u2019t mention the Champions League at all. Rather, the barracking of Neymar and Messi felt like an expression of a more fundamental need: a longing that no quantity of star signings or precious metal can truly fulfil. If Khelaifi reckons a Champions League crown will placate the restless natives, he should look at the competition\u2019s past two winners. Bayern Munich are sauntering towards their 10th Bundesliga in a row, but at their most recent annual general meeting angry fans turned on the club president, Herbert Hainer, and the chief executive, Oliver Kahn, for refusing to discuss the club\u2019s controversial sponsorship deal with Qatar. \u201cWe are Bayern! You are not!\u201d members shouted at club officials who condescendingly invited them to pursue their grievances in court.  Chelsea fans, meanwhile, have been forced to watch the dismemberment of their club in real time. Again, sympathy will be in short supply. Some clearly see themselves as the real victims of the war in Ukraine, continuing to serenade their sanctioned owner Roman Abramovich. But for the silent majority and dickhead minority alike, the common theme is a basic powerlessness, the sense that the thing they care about is simply a piece in somebody\u2019s Monopoly game. You could equally shift the focus to Manchester United or Tottenham, to Liverpool where an unconditional love for the team masks an underlying suspicion of the club\u2019s ownership, or Manchester City where the fanbase seems to be on a permanent war footing, fixated on slights and enemies. These are fans of the world\u2019s biggest clubs, home to its best players, reared on a diet of what 99% of the game would consider as unimaginable success. Why is nobody happy?  Perhaps the answer lies in a common realisation, sharpened by the Super League protests and subsequent events: that wins and new signings are no real substitute for a genuine stake. For decades all fans, but especially those of big clubs, have essentially been commodified, patronised, seen not as partners but as eyeballs, a resource to be tapped. Supporter groups demand a place on the board and a share in the future. Clubs respond with viral content, soaring ticket prices and fan tokens. And so for the most part following a superclub has become a pursuit of ever-diminishing returns: a doomed search for lost meaning in an increasingly transactional relationship. \u201cOur club,\u201d the Paris ultras insisted. But it isn\u2019t and Khelaifi has the documents to prove it. In a sense these protests feel like a natural end point: an overdue recognition these are no longer our clubs and this is no longer our game. You can\u2019t bring down the church. But there comes a point where you may just stop believing. \u2022 This article was amended on 17 March 2022. An earlier version misspelled Oliver Kahn\u2019s last name."

                    "body": "  12.07am   Summary  That\u2019s all for our live coverage today, but we\u2019ll continue to cover developments in the coming days. For now, here\u2019s where things stand:  Twitter has laid off roughly half of its workforce, with an estimated 3,700 cuts across the company. Audi, General Motors, General Mills and Pfizer were among those who halted advertisements, amid concerns Elon Musk will scale back misinformation and security protections on the platform. The mass layoffs have reportedly gutted teams that cover human rights, machine learning ethics, curation, communications and accessibility. Musk said there has been a mass drop in revenue due to advertisers leaving Twitter, which he claimed was an attack on free speech. Twitter is facing a class-action lawsuit from former employees who say they were not given enough notice under US federal law that they had lost their jobs. Derrick Johnson, the NAACP\u2019s president, who met with Elon Musk on Tuesday, issued a statement urging all companies to pause ads on the platform. With possible cuts to spending on critical resources such as cloud storage and servers, experts are particularly concerned about the impact on US midterm elections.    Updated at 12.13am GMT    11.42pm    Guardian US technology reporter Kari Paul\u2019s analysis of the layoffs and what they mean for the future of Twitter: With possible cuts to spending on critical resources such as cloud storage and servers, experts are particularly concerned as the US midterm elections approach, when larger numbers of users than usual go to the platform to follow breaking news and share information. An internal source at the company told Reuters the infrastructure cuts were \u201cdelusional\u201d, adding that when user traffic kicks up, the service can fail \u201cin spectacular ways\u201d. The layoffs are also calling into question Twitter\u2019s ability to keep the platform safe and secure, and come after a whistleblower accused the company of \u201cegregious\u201d failings in security and safety. \u201cElon Musk\u2019s layoffs to Twitter\u2019s policy enforcement teams will destroy the platform\u2019s capacity to stop the spread of hate speech, misinformation and disinformation at a time when the American public and voters need access to facts and civil discourse more than ever,\u201d said Jim Steyer, founder and CEO of digital rights group Common Sense Media. The reports of drastic cuts to the communications staff raised concerns Twitter may follow in the path of other Musk companies like Tesla, which do not communicate with the press. Musk, who has historically had an adversarial relationship with media, dissolved the electric car company\u2019s public relations department in 2020 in an unprecedented move.      11.34pm    Elon Musk has claimed in a tweet that every Twitter employee laid off was offered three months of severance. But the New York Times, citing laid off employees, earlier today reported that terminated workers were \u201cgiven few details about severance and were told they would receive more information in a week\u201d, adding, \u201cThey said they gleaned that any severance would probably be less than what Twitter\u2019s previous management would have paid.\u201d About the mass layoffs, Musk also said in his tweet, \u201cthere is no choice when the company is losing over $4M/day\u201d. Twitter has, however, also experienced a massive revenue drop due to advertisers\u2019 pulling back in the wake of the chaos of Musk\u2019s layoffs and tweets of potential policy changes in recent days. Twitter is also already facing a lawsuit surrounding its handling of layoffs. Former employees allege they were not given proper notice under US federal law; workers found out they were fired when they were locked out of their accounts on Thursday. The lawsuit seeks to force Twitter to comply with the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (Warn) act, which requires 60 days\u2019 notice for mass cuts at large employers. In another late Friday tweet, Musk also claimed that \u201cTwitter\u2019s strong commitment to content moderation remains absolutely unchanged\u201d. He further claimed that \u201cwe have actually seen hateful speech at times this week decline *below* our prior norms\u201d, but Musk did not elaborate or provide specific evidence of that. Twitter was bombarded with hate speech soon after the billionaire official took over the company last week.  Updated at 11.38pm GMT    11.15pm   Twitter official confirms scale of layoffs  Twitter\u2019s head of safety and integrity has appeared to confirm that roughly half of the company\u2019s workforce has been cut, which would amount to an estimated 3,700 jobs.  In a tweet thread late Friday, Yoel Roth said the layoffs \u201caffected approximately 15% of our Trust &amp; Safety organization (as opposed to approximately 50% cuts company-wide), with our front-line moderation staff experiencing the least impact\u201d.  With Twitter\u2019s communications department reported to be severely cut, the company has confirmed few details formally and has not been responsive to reporters. But Roth\u2019s comments suggest that the widely reported figure of 50% cuts companywide was accurate. He further tweeted:   With early voting underway in the US, our efforts on election integrity \u2014 including harmful misinformation that can suppress the vote and combatting state-backed information operations \u2014 remain a top priority.  He also claimed that due to \u201csecurity reasons\u201d, Twitter had \u201crestricted access to our internal tools for some users, including some members of my team\u201d, but added, \u201cMost of the 2,000+ content moderators working on front-line review were not impacted, and access will be fully restored in the coming days.\u201d  Bloomberg had reported on Monday that most people working in the trust and safety organization were unable to alter or penalize accounts breaking rules related to misleading information and hate speech, \u201cexcept for the most high-impact violations that would involve real-world harm\u201d. Those most-serious posts were \u201cprioritized for manual enforcement\u201d, the news site reported. The reports of Twitter limiting its moderation tools a week before the election caused widespread concerns. Roth\u2019s messages today did not elaborate on the \u201csecurity reasons\u201d that he said led to the restrictions.      10.54pm   Twitter employee warns of potential cybersecurity attacks  NBC News has a new story out on the misinformation and chaos that current and fired employees fear will infect the site surrounding the election and Elon Musk\u2019s proposed new system for verification.  Musk has said he plans to open up verification to users who are willing to pay $8; the checkmark system previously was used as a way for the site to verify the identity of the accounts.  Some fear that the new system, which Musk is apparently rushing to implement at a time of mass layoffs, could allow for users to impersonate people and could exacerbate problems with falsehoods and disinformation spreading on the site. In the lead up to a high-stakes election, where some candidates and officials have been making false claims and sowing doubt about results, the consequences could be dire. Some details from NBC\u2019s reporting:   Three current and former employees said \u201cthey didn\u2019t see significant enforcement mechanisms to make sure users with the verification checks are who they say they are\u201d, with one noting, \u201cTwitter isn\u2019t prepared for that scale.\u201d   An employee who survived the layoffs said: \u201cI expect a ton of cybersecurity attacks on Monday.\u201d Monday is the day that Musk is reportedly trying to launch the new verification feature, though the company hasn\u2019t publicly confirmed this, and it\u2019s not clear if the site can meet that deadline, given the mass cuts.    Laura Edelson, a postdoctoral researcher at New York University, told NBC she\u2019d already observed an uptick in content violating Twitter rules: \u201c\u200b\u200bWhat I think we saw is a little preview of what Twitter is like without the trust and safety team having access to the tools that they need to do their jobs. I think that\u2019s only a preview of what we\u2019ll see if the trust and safety team either is gutted or just doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d   A remaining Twitter employee also questioned Musk\u2019s logic with the new verification system, telling NBC: \u201cHe thinks the bots won\u2019t pay money, so anyone without a blue mark will be a bot, in his logic.\u201d    Updated at 10.57pm GMT    10.20pm    Elon Musk has continued to claim that the massive drop in revenue due to advertisers fleeing the site constitutes an \u201cattack on the first amendment\u201d. The Wall Street Journal reported that Musk, speaking at an investment conference on Friday, echoed his tweets blaming activists for pressuring companies to pause their advertisements: \u201cWe\u2019ve done our absolute best to appease them and nothing is working.\u201d The Journal, which noted that the first amendment\u2019s free speech protections generally apply to the government and not private companies, reported:   Musk acknowledged that the price he paid for Twitter was \u201con the high side\u201d and made a joke referencing the movie The Godfather, noting he tried to get out of the deal but \u201cthey pulled me back in\u201d.  He also claimed that \u201ccontent moderation policies have not changed at Twitter\u201d, though civil rights groups have warned that the mass layoffs will severely impact moderation. His final remark to the conference, according to the Journal, was a plea for people to pay for the subscription to be verified, which he said would allow users to have their tweets higher up in the feed and allow for longer videos (in addition to granting them the blue check mark): \u201cPlease use Twitter and please subscribe to Twitter verified: eight bucks. Actually it\u2019s technically $7.99, so slightly less.\u201d     9.53pm   Which teams have been laid off at Twitter?  From news reports and terminated employees\u2019 announcements, here\u2019s what we know so far about the teams that have been hit by the layoffs of thousands of Twitter employees:  The human rights team has been laid off, according to a now former employee, Shannon Raj Singh, who said the team worked to protect those at risk in global conflicts, including in Ukraine, Afghanistan and Ethiopia.  The ML (machine learning) Ethics, Transparency and Accountability team is gone, according to a tweet of a laid-off manager.  The \u201cinternet technology team\u201d, which helps keep the site running, has been cut to \u201ca skeleton crew\u201d, two sources told the Times.  An accessibly experience engineering team has been cut, according to a laid-off engineering manager.  The curation team, responsible for the Moments feature on Twitter, has also been cut, former employees reported.  Twitter\u2019s communications department is almost entirely gone, according to the Verge.  Other areas that have been heavily impacted, the Verge reported, include product trust and safety, policy, research and social good.       9.16pm   NAACP urges all companies to stop advertisements on Twitter  The NAACP has called for a complete advertising boycott of Twitter. Derrick Johnson, the NAACP\u2019s president and CEO, who met with Elon Musk on Tuesday, issued a statement urging all companies to pause ads on the platform:  It is immoral, dangerous, and highly destructive to our democracy for any advertiser to fund a platform that fuels hate speech, election denialism, and conspiracy theories. Since Elon Musk has taken over Twitter, racial slurs have spiked, and conspiracy theories have spread. When we met with Elon Musk, he made commitments that gave us cautious optimism, but until actions are taken to make Twitter a safe space, corporations cannot in good conscience put their money behind Twitter. Twitter must earn its advertisers by creating a platform that safeguards our democracy and rids itself of any content or account that spews hate and disinformation. Any account promoting hate, election denialism and any other form of mis- or disinformation cannot be allowed to return to Twitter. As we did in 2020 for Facebook, the NAACP will meet with advertisers privately to discuss their ongoing relationship with Twitter. Unlike Elon Musk\u2019s past ventures, this one should not be rocket science.\u201d   Updated at 9.18pm GMT    9.09pm    Some details from a New York Times report about the haphazard mass terminations:  The firings were reportedly so chaotic that in \u201cone late-night meeting about the Twitter Blue subscription product, at least one worker was locked out of the company\u2019s systems during the call\u201d.   Twitter\u2019s communications team was almost entirely laid off (and has not responded to requests for comment).   For fired workers, \u201caccess was cut in a staggered and seemingly arbitrary fashion\u201d, the report said. \u201cSome people received text messages from colleagues saying they had been logged out of some work apps but were temporarily able to open their email or work apps, before they eventually lost access, too.\u201d   Some employees reportedly volunteered to be laid off if it would allow colleagues on visas to keep their jobs.   Fired workers reportedly have been given few details about severance, but are expecting that the package will be less generous than what previous management would have provided.   Four people with knowledge of the situation told the Times that an estimated 3,700 jobs (roughly half of the workforce) had been eliminated.    Updated at 9.19pm GMT    8.48pm    Eddie Perez, a former manager of Twitter\u2019s civic integrity team, who quit in September, told the Associated Press he fears the mass layoffs so close to the midterms could allow disinformation to \u201cspread like wildfire\u201d, especially in the period after the election when votes are still being counted:  \u201cI have a hard time believing that it doesn\u2019t have a material impact on their ability to manage the amount of disinformation out there,\u201d he said, adding that there simply may not be enough employees to beat it back.  Perez is now a board member at an election integrity nonprofit, the OSET Institute. He warned that \u201csome candidates may not concede and some may allege election irregularities and that is likely to generate a new cycle of falsehoods\u201d.   Updated at 8.58pm GMT    8.35pm    Elon Musk has responded to a tweet criticizing the platform\u2019s ad system, saying he \u201cagreed\u201d that \u201cTwitter has the worst ad platform of any social media company\u201d.  The tweet he was responding to said Twitter\u2019s \u201cAD roi is so terrible that its virtually a black hole\u201d. Musk, who is overseeing mass layoffs today, said he\u2019s \u201cworking on it\u201d.      8.04pm    CNN has some details of Elon Musk\u2019s appearance at an investment conference in New York on Friday morning, at which he largely ignored the furore over Twitter and spoke warmly of electric cars and spaceships. In what the network says was \u201ca friendly interview\u201d with financier Ron Baron, a prominent shareholder of Musk\u2019s electric car company Tesla, the billionaire spoke of his ambition to drive down the cost of his vehicles, and one day reach Mars through his SpaceX venture.  In brief comments about his $44bn purchase of Twitter, Musk said: \u201cI tried to get out of the deal,\u201d then added, \u201cI think there is a tremendous amount of potential\u2026 and I think it could be one of the most valuable companies in the world\u201d. Baron, according to CNN, said that Musk had laid off \u201chalf of Twitter\u201d and Musk nodded, although he did not comment on the remark. He appeared to frame the layoffs as necessary for a company that, like other social media firms, was experiencing \u201crevenue challenges\u201d prior to his acquisition as advertisers rethink spending amid recession fears. Musk acknowledged that \u201ca number of major advertisers have stopped spending on Twitter\u201d in the week since he acquired the company, but did not expand on his tweet from earlier today blaming \u201cactivist groups\u201d for driving advertising revenue away.     7.45pm   Employment lawyer: Musk at risk of discrimination claims  The speed of layoffs could expose Elon Musk and Twitter to discrimination claims if it turns out they disproportionally affected women, people of color, or older workers, an employment lawyer has told the Associated Press. Attorney Peter Rahbar, founder of the New York law firm the Rahbar Group, told the agency that most employers \u201ctake great care in doing layoffs of this magnitude\u201d. He said: \u201cFirst, they want to make sure there is justification, and second that a nondiscriminatory process is used. And third, they want to do everything they can not to draw attention to it, for these reasons. \u201cFor some reason, [Musk] wants to lay off half the company without doing any due diligence on what these people do or who they are and without any regards to the law\u201d. Twitter is already facing a class action lawsuit filed in San Francisco on Thursday by ex-employees who say they were denied the required notice period that they were about to lose their jobs.     7.14pm   Summary  It\u2019s after 3pm in New York (where Elon Musk has spent much of the day) and time to take stock of what\u2019s been happening:  Thousands of now former Twitter employees have learned they are being laid off as billionaire owner Elon Musk continues the transformation of his newly purchased social media titan. Musk posted a tweet blaming \u201cactivist groups\u201d for pressuring advertisers to withdraw from Twitter, causing a \u201cmassive drop in revenue\u201d. The company appended, and later removed, a note to the post adding \u201ccontext\u201d, suggesting advertisers were concerned about the platform\u2019s direction. Scores of former employees (known as Tweeps), from numerous areas of the company, posted farewell messages, setting the hashtags #LoveWhereYouWorked and #OneTeam trending. Reports suggest Musk has axed entire departments at Twitter, including the curation team moderating misinformation; a human rights team; and another responsible for machine language ethics, transparency and accountability. Twitter is facing a class action lawsuit from former employees who say they were not given enough notice under US federal law that they had lost their jobs, finding out they had been let go when they were locked out of their work accounts.  Please stay with us, there\u2019s plenty more Twitter news to come.  Updated at 7.14pm GMT    6.45pm    Here are some more tweets from former Twitter employees who now know their fate. The first, from lawyer Shannon Raj Singh, claims that the company\u2019s entire human rights team has been axed. Twitter has yet to confirm this.  This one, from Joan Deitchman, a former senior engineer, suggests that Twitter\u2019s machine language (ML) ethics, transparency and accountability team has met a similar fate:  Others paint a picture of widespread departures, and a large number of people from numerous areas of the Twitter empire now looking for new beginnings. The hashtags #lovewhereyouworked and #oneteam are trending.         Others jumped before finding out if they were to be pushed:   Updated at 6.59pm GMT    6.25pm    Here\u2019s a handy explainer, courtesy of Reuters, about the class action lawsuit against Elon Musk and Twitter claiming that layoffs violate US and California laws if employees are not given advance notice or severance pay. What does US law require? The federal worker adjustment and retraining notification act (Warn) requires businesses with 100 or more employees to provide 60 days\u2019 notice before engaging in mass layoffs, defined as those affecting at least 500 employees during a 30-day period, or at least 50 employees if layoffs impact at least one-third of a company\u2019s workforce. Employers can provide workers with 60 days of severance pay in lieu of giving notice. What are the penalties for violating the Warn act? An employer can be ordered to give laidoff workers 60 days of back pay. The law also imposes penalties of $500 per violation per day. Comparable laws in California and other states impose similar penalties. What is Twitter accused of? The lawsuit claims Twitter locked employees out of their accounts on Thursday, signaling that they will soon lose their jobs. One of the five named plaintiffs, who is based in California, says he was terminated on 1 November without notice or severance pay. It is not clear if Twitter is paying severance to workers who lose their jobs. The plaintiffs say they are concerned that Twitter will ask workers targeted for layoffs to sign releases waiving their ability to sue in exchange for modest severance pay. Have other Elon Musk-owned businesses been sued under the Warn act? Tesla Inc was sued in Texas federal court in June following an abrupt nationwide purge of its workforce, including 500 layoffs at a factory in Sparks, Nevada.  The law firm behind that case, Boston-based Lichten &amp; Liss-Riordan, also represents the Twitter workers who sued on Thursday. The firm did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Tesla has said it was merely \u201cright-sizing\u201d by firing poorly performing workers and not engaging in layoffs that required advance notice.

On a Friday call in which advocacy groups urged brands to pull advertising from Twitter in response to mass employee layoffs, Color of Change president Rashad Robinson and Free Press co-chief executive Jessica Gonz\u00e1lez said they left their conversation with Musk believing he was genuine in his commitment to be transparent about content moderation policy changes as well as to keep election integrity policies in place.  But Robinson and Gonz\u00e1lez both say his actions have betrayed his words. Specifically, Gonz\u00e1lez said Musk assured the advocacy groups, including the Anti-Defamation League and National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, that those responsible for election moderation would regain access to the proper tools by Friday.  Gonz\u00e1lez said:  Today\u2019s Friday. And instead a lot of those people are gone. So I don\u2019t have a lot of confidence that we can trust what he says. We\u2019re escalating our call to advertisers because he\u2019s shown in the past few days that he\u2019s not gonna live up to his promises. These cuts alone indicate that he cannot moderate content.   Robinson countered Musk\u2019s assertion that advertisers were pulling out because of group activism:  The impulse control of this chief executive is simply not at the level that any advertiser should trust with their brand. Elon Musk is the reason why these companies are making this choice. We are simply helping to expose, shine a light and provide an opportunity.  Media Matters president Angelo Carusone said Musk\u2019s claim that advertisers pulling out was akin to an attack on free speech was a dangerous precedent:  He\u2019s signaling to [brands] that... he will use the Twitter platform and megaphone that he had and direct the same ire that a lot of the individuals on this call demonstrated they\u2019re concerned about toward those companies.      5.34pm    This tweet from fired employee Aakash Raina would appear to confirm Elon Musk has fired at least some members of Twitter\u2019s content moderation team. It also directly contradicts the billionaire Twitter owner\u2019s assertion in his own tweet earlier Friday that \u201cnothing has changed with content moderation\u201d.      5.23pm    Elon Musk has been busy this morning at an investment conference in New York city, talking economics and finance as thousands of his Twitter employees were waiting to learn their fate. The billionaire entrepreneur was at the 29th annual Baron investment conference in Manhattan, chatting with the company\u2019s chairman and chief executive Ron Baron, a prominent shareholder of Musk\u2019s electric car company Tesla.  We don\u2019t yet know how their discussion went, but according to Baron in an appearance on CNBC Thursday he indicated they would talk about Tesla, SpaceX, and Musk\u2019s provision of Starlink internet service to Ukraine as it fights the country\u2019s invasion by Russia. Baron said he supported Musk\u2019s vision for Twitter, including today\u2019s lay-off of thousands of workers.   Updated at 5.24pm GMT    4.59pm   Twitter safety watchdog adds 'context' to Musk's 'activist groups' post  Without any discernible hint of irony, Twitter has added \u201ccontext\u201d to Elon Musk\u2019s earlier tweet accusing \u201cactivist groups\u201d of pressuring advertisers to withdraw from his newly acquired social media platform, leading to a \u201cmassive drop in revenue\u201d. The note appended to Musk\u2019s tweet adds links to three news articles referring to \u201cadvertisers suspending or canceling ad buys over concern with Twitter platform direction\u201d rather than pressure from any outside entities seeking to exert influence.  Twitter\u2019s own \u201cwatchdog\u201d, @twittersafety, informs users that \u201ccontext\u201d is sometimes added to a post when \u201cpotentially misleading content\u201d is present. We wait to learn if Musk will react to being pulled up by the tech behemoth he now owns.   Updated at 5.13pm GMT    4.31pm    A former senior community manager at Twitter has told the Guardian how he learned of his dismissal, by data on his laptop suddenly being wiped, one hour after he finished what turned out to be his final shift. Simon Balmain, who worked for the company for about a year, liaising primarily with clients on the US west coast, said he was \u201cshocked, but not surprised\u201d at the sudden job cuts:  I had finished work but still had my laptop open, and we all received an email from the company about a reduction in head count. An hour after that, my laptop flashed and was wiped, I no longer had access to my apps.   Balmain said that reports of the firing of Twitter\u2019s anti-disinformation curation team \u201cposes real risks going forward\u201d. He added:  I\u2019ve spoken to a few people in the same position as me and what is very apparent is we had a very good corporate culture and people have been really looking out for each other, including former employees who have reached out and offered support.  Balmain believes Twitter will focus on two strategies to make money: products that users pay for, such as Twitter Blue and the $8 monthly fee Musk has floated for user verification; and creative projects where users pay other users, such as celebrities or influencers. Read more:   Updated at 6.18pm GMT    4.05pm    Here\u2019s our latest report of Friday\u2019s Twitter developments, including Elon Musk\u2019s claim that \u201cactivist groups pressuring advertisers\u201d are responsible for a \u201cmassive drop in revenue\u201d since he bought the company. Twitter employees have told us that they\u2019ve been locked out of their work laptops and email accounts, and there are reports from inside the company that Musk has fired the platform\u2019s entire curation team. As my colleague Dan Milmo explains, the curation team \u201cplays a key role in coverage of \u2018civic integrity\u2019 events such as elections, breaking news and sports, ensuring users have vetted information presented as moments, trends and topics products. It is viewed internally as a key filter against misleading posts\u201d. Read the full report here:      3.49pm    While we wait for news of the extent of today\u2019s lay-offs, here\u2019s an eye-opening employee\u2019s account of life within the new-look Twitter bubble following its takeover by Elon Musk, as reported by Business Insider. It tells of purges of staff that have already taken place; team leaders forming their own cliques; a menacing atmosphere from \u201cprowling\u201d managers; and individuals quickly sucking up to their new boss despite having never met him. The insider says:  It\u2019s been nuts to me to see this small faction of newly-minted Elon acolytes suddenly rise up and try to make their voices heard. The amount of ass-kissing and the amount of bizarre Reddit, 4-chan-style stuff like \u201coh Elon, I\u2019ll be your right hand\u201d on Blind, during those first days after the transaction closed \u2014 it was terrifying.  I thought, \u2018I don\u2019t want to work with these clowns\u2019.  The employee adds that he\u2019s heard stories of people being asked to work \u201cliterally around the clock\u201d, and engineers asked to stay on call over the weekend and asked to do things immediately, \u201cat three or four in the morning\u201d. \u201cI can\u2019t keep doing this. I\u2019ve started interviewing elsewhere,\u201d the employee says. Business Insider notes that Twitter did not respond to a request for comment.     3.31pm   Report: Musk fires Twitter curation team tackling misinformation  There\u2019s as-yet unverified speculation that Elon Musk has fired Twitter\u2019s curation team, which is responsible for countering misinformation posted to the social media network. The claim comes (on Twitter, naturally) from Richie Assaly, a digital producer for the Toronto Star, who says he previously worked as a member of the curation team. Assaly says team \u201cleads, management and curators are all posting that they\u2019ve been fired\u201d. The move, if true, \u201cwill make Twitter noisier, more dangerous &amp; less interesting\u201d, he asserts.  Musk, in his tweet blaming \u201cactivist groups\u201d for pressuring advertisers to withdraw from Twitter, causing a \u201cmassive\u201d drop in revenue, insisted: \u201cnothing has changed with content moderation\u201d.  Updated at 4.40pm GMT    2.57pm   Musk:  Twitter revenue has slumped as \"activist groups pressure advertisers\"  Elon Musk has tweeted that Twitter has seen a slump in revenue due to \u201cactivist groups\u201d putting pressure on advertisers. He says:  \u201cTwitter has had a massive drop in revenue, due to activist groups pressuring advertisers, even though nothing has changed with content moderation and we did everything we could to appease the activists,.\u201d   It\u2019s true that some major companies have put advertising on pause, such as General Mills and General Motors, and now Volkswagen.   But as my colleague Kari Paul writes, that reflects concerns about how Musk will run Twitter:  The growing exodus of advertisers comes amid concerns Musk will scale back misinformation and security protections on the platform. As civil rights groups call potential moderation issues into question, companies are considering whether staying on Twitter might tarnish their brands. Shortly before taking over the San Francisco company last week, Musk issued a vow to advertisers that he would not allow Twitter to become a \u201cfree-for-all hellscape,\u201d an indication there would still be consequences for violators of its rules against harassment, violence or election and Covid-related misinformation. But since then some users have posted racial slurs and recirculated long-debunked conspiracy theories in an apparent attempt to see if the site\u2019s policies were still being enforced. The NAACP said this week it has expressed to Musk its concerns about \u201cthe dangerous, life-threatening hate and conspiracies that have proliferated on Twitter\u201d under his watch.       2.34pm    Twitter employees have been using the hashtag #OneTeam to announce they\u2019ve lost their jobs, or to support each other. Some staff have reported losing access to internal systems, so couldn\u2019t message goodbyes to colleagues.   Twitter users have been expressing support too:       2.19pm     Wall Street has opened higher, after the US jobs report bolstered hopes that interest rate rises could slow. The Dow Jones industrial average has gained 1.3%, or 406 points, to 32,407, with the tech-focused Nasdaq up 1.1%. The rise in the US unemployment rate, to 3.7%, and the slowdown in annual pay growth to 4.7% seems to be supporting hopes that the Federal Reserve could deliver smaller rate hikes in the future.  The dollar has dropped sharply, pushing the pound up by one and a half cents to $1.132, recovering most of yesterday\u2019s losses.  Shares are roaring higher in London too, with the FTSE 100 up over 2%. Mining stocks are surging, as a weaker dollar pushes up commodity prices and could help global growth.     1.59pm    A member of security staff at Twitter\u2019s Europe, Middle East and Africa headquarters in Dublin has told reporters that nobody was coming into the office on Friday and employees had been told to stay home, Reuters reports. Another member of security staff locked the revolving doors at the front of the building where around 500 members of staff worked before the layoffs began. The company\u2019s office in Piccadilly Circus, London, appeared deserted on Friday, with no employees in sight.      1.53pm   Biden: Jobs recovery remains strong  US president Joe Biden says the US jobs recovery remains strong, following today\u2019s better-than-expected employment report. October\u2019s Non-Farm Payrolls was the last healthcheck on America\u2019s labor market before the mid-term elections next week. Biden has reminded voters that the economy has been adding jobs steadily on his watch. Biden says:  Today\u2019s jobs report \u2013 adding 261,000 jobs with the unemployment rate still at a historically low 3.7% \u2014 shows that our jobs recovery remains strong. With jobs now added every single month of my presidency, a record setting 10 million job increase, a record 700,000 manufacturing jobs added which puts us at 137,000 more manufacturing jobs than we had before the pandemic, historically low Black and Hispanic unemployment rates, the gross domestic product increasing, and incomes on the way up, one thing is clear: while comments by Republican leadership sure seem to indicate they are rooting for a recession, the US economy continues to grow and add jobs even as gas prices continue to come down.   Biden also pledges to \u201cdo what it takes to bring inflation down\u201d, but won\u2019t accept that the problem is too many Americans are finding good jobs.   Updated at 2.00pm GMT    1.42pm   What's changed at Twitter, and Musk might do next  Musk is keen to prevent an exodus of advertisers as he shakes up Twitter, my colleague Dan Milmo explains:  Given that ads account for 90% of the company\u2019s revenue, the Tesla CEO needs to keep them onside while he tries to boost income via other initiatives. To that end, he sent a message to advertisers as the takeover was being finalised, saying he would not let the site become a hotbed of hate speech. \u201cTwitter obviously cannot become a free-for-all hellscape, where anything can be said with no consequences,\u201d he said. Advertisers have, nonetheless, gone on pause. General Mills, the company behind the Cheerios and Lucky Charms cereals, said it would suspend advertising on Twitter, joining the car firms General Motors and Audi in monitoring changes at the company before deciding whether to resume. The pharmaceutical company Pfizer has reportedly paused its advertising, too.  Here\u2019s a full breakdown of what\u2019s happening at the social media site:      1.35pm   Volkswagen tells brands to pause paid advertising on Twitter  German carmaker Volkswagen has joined the ranks of companies deciding to pause paid advertising on Twitter, following Elon Musk\u2019s takeover. Volkswagen said today it had recommended to its brands to pause paid advertising, explaining:  \u201cWe are closely monitoring the situation and will decide about next steps depending on its evolvement\u201d  Volkswagen\u2019s brands include VW, Seat, Cupra, Audi, Lamborghini, Bentley, Ducati and Porsche. Fellow car maker General Motors and Cheerios-maker General Mills have also said they are pausing advertising on Twitter while they evaluated the situation.  Musk has promised advertisers he would keep Twitter from turning into a \u2018free-for-all hellscape\u2019, but there are concerns that misinformation on the platform could increase, especially if banned accounts are reinstated.  Updated at 2.54pm GMT    1.29pm    In more retail news \u2013 UK department store chain John Lewis has announced that it\u2019s launched its Black Friday deals today, over a fortnight earlier than last year, in a bid to help its customers \u201cspread the cost of Christmas\u201d amid the cost of living crisis. However, the first promotions are only valid for some technology products and some fragrances, while discounts on fashion, beauty and homeware will be unveiled in the coming days. Kathleen Mitchell, John Lewis\u2019s commercial director, said:  \u201cWe know that, despite the rising cost of living, our customers still want to celebrate Christmas, so our teams and suppliers have worked incredibly hard to make sure we can offer our customers great value deals on the products they love.\u201d  The retailer said it\u2019s also hiring an additional 6,000 temporary workers - 2,000 of whom will work in its shops over the busy festive period and 4,000 in its distribution network. Black Friday promotions once traditionally took place on the final Friday in November, the day after the US Thanksgiving holiday. But it has spread, and John Lewis\u2019s are set to last for the best part of a month this year, with many running until 1st December, as it looks to get shoppers to spend. Other retailers are already looking towards Christmas, with the first festive ads hitting TV sets:      1.12pm   Mike Ashley boosts Hugo Boss stake   Back in Europe, Mike Ashley\u2019s shopping spree continues unabated.  The billionaire retailer\u2019s sportswear and fashion business Frasers Group has just informed the stock market that it has further increased its stake in the German fashion house Hugo Boss, taking its maximum exposure to the company to appoximately \u20ac1bn (\u00a3874m). Frasers now has a 4.3% direct holding of Hugo Boss shares, combined with an additional 30% through the sale of financial instruments known as put options. It comes less than a fortnight since Frasers last told investors it had increased its stake in Hugo Boss, at that time increasing its exposure to \u20ac960m. In recent weeks, Frasers has also increased its stake in the online fashion retailer Asos to reach 5%, making it the company\u2019s fourth-largest investor.  Ashley stepped down last month from the board of Frasers Group, after 40 years at the helm, and a few months after installing his son-in-law Michael Murray as the company\u2019s chief executive.  However, Ashley remains the company\u2019s controlling shareholder, with a near-70% stake, and he continues to act as an adviser to the board and senior management.      1.09pm    Richard Flynn, managing director at Charles Schwab UK, fears US unemployment will continue to rise as the Fed fight inflation:   \u201cToday\u2019s strong jobs figures indicate that the US economy is still running faster than the Fed might hope, increasing the likelihood that the central bank will continue to raise interest rates through into 2023.  Officials have been quite vocal about their intention to loosen the labour market to tame inflation. Their goal is to decrease the number of job openings without increasing unemployment. However, the margin for success continues to fade as interest rates climb.  \u201cEven though many may be hoping for weaker jobs reports in the near term, there will come a point at which weaker reports won\u2019t be celebrated. The employment market is a lagging economic indicator, meaning recent interest rate hikes will take months to feed into future jobs reports. There is a risk that increasing unemployment becomes the price for a return to lower inflation.\u201d      1.01pm    Here\u2019s a good breakdown of the US jobs report, from Kathy Jones, managing director at the Schwab Center for Financial Research.    Updated at 1.03pm GMT    12.54pm         12.53pm    On an annual basis, US wage growth slowed a little in October \u2013 which may suggest inflation pressures are easing. Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings increased by 4.7%, down from 5% a month ago. That means Americans continued to face real wage cuts, with inflation running at 8.5% per year. But, it would be welcomed by the US Federal Reserve as it tries to avoid crashing the US economy with higher interest rates.      12.44pm    There were \u201cnotable job gains\u201d for Americans in health care, professional and technical services, and manufacturing last month, the Bureau for Labor Statistics reports. For example:  Professional and technical services added 43,000 jobs in October.  Manufacturing added 32,000 jobs in October, mostly in durable goods industries (+23,000). Employment in social assistance increased by 19,000 in October and is slightly below (-9,000) its prepandemic level in February 2020 Wholesale trade added 15,000 jobs in October.  There were 35,000 new jobs in leisure and hospitality, with accommodation adding 20,000 jobs.      12.38pm         12.34pm   US beats forecasts with 261k extra jobs last month  Just in: the US economy added 261,000 jobs in October, more than forecast, in a sign that America\u2019s labor market remains pretty robust. The latest Non-Farm Payroll jobs report beat expectations, despite the pressure from high inflation and rising interest rates. Economists had forecast a rise of around 200,000 jobs. Average hourly earnings rose by 0.4% month-on-month, more than the 0.3% expected. And September\u2019s report has been revised up, to show 315,000 new hires, from 263,000 first estimated. But, the unemployment rate has risen to 3.7%, from 3.5%, with the number of unemployed people rising by 306,000 to 6.1 million   Updated at 2.21pm GMT    12.24pm   Britain not scrapping Sizewell C nuclear plan, says PM spokesman  Prime minister Rishi Sunak\u2019s spokesman has denied that Britain\u2019s Sizewell C nuclear power plant project is to be scrapped. He told reporters that negotiations on the plant\u2019s funding are progressing, after the BBC reported it was under review (see earlier post) and could be delayed or even scrapped. Asked if the government was scrapping Sizewell C, the spokesman said (via Reuters):  \u201cNo ... it is not accurate to say we are scrapping it. Our position on Sizewell C has not changed.\u201d \u201cWe hope to get a deal over the line as soon as possible. There are negotiations ongoing. I can\u2019t get into detail of those, but negotiations have been constructive.    Updated at 12.26pm GMT    11.59am    Caterers, cleaners, security guards, reception workers and post and porterage staff at the UK\u2019s business department are to hold five days of strike action. Members of the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union working at the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy in London will strike in a dispute over pay and health and safety. PCS members will take action on November 16, 23 and 30, and December 7 and 14. The catering staff are striking in a pay dispute with their employer Aramark, while the remaining staff are taking action against their employer ISS over health and safety protocols. PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka said:  \u201cA recent survey showed a third of our members were skipping meals because they couldn\u2019t afford to buy food, so it would be no surprise if these hard-working caterers would struggle to afford the food they serve to others. \u201cWe demand they receive an above-inflation pay rise to help them through the cost-of-living crisis and beyond.\u201d   Updated at 12.06pm GMT    11.36am    UK government borrowing costs have risen after a Bank of England official suggested it could start to sell some of the bonds it bought to prevent financial collapse after the mini-budget. Reuters has the details:  Andrew Hauser, the BoE\u2019s executive director for markets, told a European Central Bank conference that the BoE wanted to unwind the purchases in a timely and orderly way, and hoped to say more in the next week or two. Asked if sales could begin before the end of the year, he did not rule this out.  The price of 30-year UK bonds has dropped, which pushed up the yield (or interest rate) on the debt to 3.81%, from 3.68% last night. That\u2019s slightly above its levels on the day before the mini-budget. The 30-year gilt yield soared over 5% after the now-reversed unfunded tax cuts were announced, forcing the Bank to step in to protect pension funds who were caught in an asset fire sale.      11.30am    Back in the City, the pound is on track for its worst week against the US dollar since the mini-budget rocked markets six weeks ago. Sterling has lost four cents, or 3.5%, against the dollar this week, as the monetary policy divide between the US and UK widened. Both country\u2019s central banks raised interest rates by 75 basis points this week. But while the Bank of England tried to dampen expectations of further large increases, Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell said US interest rates would peak at a higher level than expected.     11.14am    US attorney Lisa Bloom also believes Twitter isn\u2019t complying with the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act:           11.01am   UK builders report first fall in new orders since May 2020  UK construction companies have been hit by the first drop in new orders since the first wave of the pandemic in spring 2020. Some firms blamed heightened political uncertainty for the drop in new work in October \u2013 a month in which borrowing costs surged after the UK\u2019s mini-budget rocked markets. Business confidence fell sharply too, to the lowest for almost two-and-a half years, the latest survey of purchasing managers by S&amp;P Global Insight shows. But overall, the sector kept growing as firms started new projects or continued existing work.   Updated at 11.53am GMT    10.12am   Prospect Union: Twitter can't act like a digital P&amp;O Ferries  UK union Prospect are appalled by the way that Twitter\u2019s staff are being treated, as Elon Musk begins mass job cuts. Prospect, which represents technology workers, compared it to the notorious sudden mass sacking of 800 workers by P&amp;O Ferries this year, which provoked anger among the public and MPs. Mike Clancy, general secretary of Prospect union, said:  \u201cTwitter is treating its people appallingly. \u201cThese are people who have invested their time, effort and enthusiasm in building the platform, which risks being thrown away. \u201cThe government must make clear to Twitter\u2019s new owners that we won\u2019t accept a digital P&amp;O and that no-one is above the law in the UK, including Big Tech barons. That must include making sure UK staff\u2019s full employment rights are properly protected. \u201cWe are supporting our members at Twitter and will be working with them to defend them and their livelihoods.    Updated at 11.31am GMT    10.10am   Full story: Twitter sued by former staff as Elon Musk begins mass sackings  Twitter is facing a class action lawsuit from former employees who say they were not given enough notice under US federal law that they had lost their jobs, finding out they had been let go when they were locked out of their work accounts on Thursday. In a company-wide memo, staff were informed on Thursday that they would receive an email to their personal email accounts if they were being fired as part of the mass sackings at the platform in which up to half of the company could go. Before those emails arrived, dozens of staff began posting on Twitter that they had been fired \u2013 after discovering they were no longer able to access their work email accounts or log into their work laptops. Musk\u2019s plans to cut up to 3,700 staff may hit a roadblock, however, after a lawsuit was filed in the US federal court in San Francisco seeking orders for Twitter to comply with the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, which requires 60 days\u2019 notice for mass sackings at large employers. The lawsuit, brought on behalf of five Twitter employees so far, says one was fired on 1 November, while three were not informed at the time of filing but had been locked out of their email accounts. The case cited a similar situation with sackings at Musk\u2019s other company, Tesla, where the company sought to obtain full release from its obligations under the Warn Act by offering severance of one or two weeks\u2019 pay instead.

The Unite union has announced that 700 workers, who are involved in ground-handling, airside transport and cargo, will take three days of strike action beginning on Friday 18 November, in a dispute over pay. The staff are employed by Dnata and Menzies at Heathrow. Unite says the strike action will lead to \u201cdisruption, cancellations and delays\u201d at Heathrow terminals 2, 3 and 4, adding:  The strike action will particularly affect Qatar Airways, which has scheduled an additional 10 flights a week during the World Cup.   The strike could also cause disruption to passengers returning to the United States for the Thanksgiving holiday, on Thursday 24th November. Other leading airlines that will be hit heavily include Virgin, Singapore Airlines, Cathay-Pacific and Emirates, the union predicts. Unite says Dnata has offered its workers a 5% increase, while Menzies has offered workers between 2% and 6%. Unite regional officer Kevin Hall said:   \u201cStrike action will inevitably cause disruption, delays and cancellations to flights throughout Heathrow, with travellers to the World Cup particularly affected. However, this dispute is entirely of Dnata and Menzies own making. They have had every opportunity to make a fair pay offer but have chosen not to do so.\u201d      9.43am   UK car sales on course for weakest year since 1982  UK car sales jumped by a quarter last month, new figures show, despite the rising squeeze on household incomes. New registrations rose by 26% year-on-year to 134,344 units in October, the SMMT reports. Sales were lifted by growing demand for hybrid (MHEV) cars which combine a combustion engine with an electric battery.   But despite this increase, the SMMT expects 2022 to be the worst year for car sales in four decades. It says:  Ongoing supply chain shortages, surging inflation and a growing cost of living crisis have led to a -2.2% downward revision of the market outlook for the year, with 1.566 million registrations now anticipated. This puts 2022 on course to be the market\u2019s toughest year since 1982.  SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes adds:  \u201cA strong October is hugely welcome, albeit in comparison with a weak 2021, but it is still not enough to offset the damage done by the pandemic and subsequent supply shortages,\u201d   Many of the people who received new cars in October will have ordered them some time ago, due to the supply chain disruption that slowed production. Ian Plummer, Auto Trader director, reports that more people are buying cars on credit \u2013 even though borrowing rates have risen.  \u201cAs the broader cost of living crisis impacts consumers, demand for cars has begun to flatten and we\u2019re seeing an increasing number of consumers turn to finance. Finance searches have never been so high on Auto Trader with search volume up 43% on pre-pandemic levels and up 8% compared with the highs of 2021, showing that many people are looking to spread the cost as budgets are tightened. Currently, we\u2019re seeing that finance rates for new cars are climbing much faster than used cars. \u201cIt\u2019s worth flagging that consumers already in finance agreements won\u2019t see any increases until the end of their contract so will be shielded, at least for now, from the immediate effects of these rises.\u201d  But, of course, they will face a jump when they try to refinance.  Updated at 11.50am GMT    9.25am    Bank of England chief economist Huw Pill has also warned that recent interest rate hikes will slow the economy, to tame inflation. He told CNBC this morning:  \u201c(The) slowdown in the economy is what we anticipate is required to contain domestic inflationary pressures to achieve our targets.  [In practice, that will mean higher unemployment, less pressure for wage rises (the Bank thinks) and less disposable income for households whose credit card bills and mortgages rise.] Pill added that recent months have been turbulent.  \u201cI think we\u2019ve had a clearly quite disturbed period in the UK markets, in the UK political economy, in the UK economy over the last few months. (We\u2019re) trying to re-anchor our own thinking in the more fundamental drivers ... I think we\u2019re trying to re-anchor our communication.\u201d      9.13am          9.11am    Some Twitter workers found they\u2019ve already been shut out of their email and Slack accounts, even before any official confirmation that they\u2019ve lost, or kept, their jobs. Simon Balmain, a senior community manager for Twitter in the UK, told the BBC that he believed he has been laid off, because he was logged out of his work laptop and Slack messaging programme.  \u201cEveryone got an email saying that there was going to be a large reduction in headcount, and then around an hour later, folks started getting their laptops remotely wiped and access to Slack and Gmail revoked.      9.02am   Mark Carney: next few years will be tougher  Former Bank of England governor Mark Carney has warned that the next few years will be tough in the UK, with Brexit partly to blame. He told Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme:  As we all know, it\u2019s a difficult period, and it will get tougher for the next few years. But, there is a prospect in the Bank\u2019s judgement\u2026. that inflation will be under control.  The \u201cvery difficult reality\u201d is that the Bank of England wants to slow the pace of the UK economy, Carney continues (to push down inflation and stop it becoming embedded). He says higher energy prices have slowed the pace at which the UK economy can grow. Covid has changed the labour market which also hurts growth capacity (more people aren\u2019t able to work due to ill health or caring responsibilities) \u201cAnd then of course, in the UK unfortunately we\u2019ve also had this near-term impact of Brexit, which has slowed the pace at which the economy can grow\u201d, Carney adds.  Carney also stuck to his recent warning that Brexit had shrunk the UK economy:   Updated at 12.15pm GMT    8.53am   BoE chief economist: we're trying to curb inflation while limiting pain  The Bank of England is trying to get inflation under control without doing too much damage to the UK economy, its chief economist says. Huw Pill told CNBC that the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee is aiming to balance getting inflation down to 2%, without slowing growth too severely. Pill explained:  \u201cWhat we are seeking to do, we\u2019re always seeking to do, is to find that balance that gets us back to our 2% inflation target without generating unnecessary and costly problems in the real side of the economy. \u201cCreating that balance, signalling that balance, that was really our key message yesterday.\u201d   The Bank\u2019s latest forecasts, released yesterday, showed that inflation would fall below its 2% target by mid-2024 even if interest rates stay at their new rate of 3%. It would fall more sharply, and the recession would be worse \u2013 two years long - if rates roses to over 5%.   Updated at 9.17am GMT    8.37am   Key event  Stock markets are rallying today, amid speculation that China might relax its Covid rules soon. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index, which has had a torrid year, jumped 5%, while China\u2019s CSI 300 index is up over 3%. European indices have opened around 0.7% higher.   Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, explains:  Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng has gained confidence, rising around 6%, on rumours China could relax its strict Covid policies. This is likely to spread across to more positive momentum in the UK too. China\u2019s impenetrable policies have caused a great deal of economic pain, both inside and outside the country. Supply chains, manufacturing and demand have all come under very serious pressure. Any indication that some rules could be relaxed would be an immediate dose of grease in the jarring cogs of China\u2019s economy.  An unverified screenshot circulating on social media this week claimed that a broad reopening plan was being considered, which drove up stocks \u2013 although China\u2019s top health body has reaffirmed its commitment to the zero-tolerance virus approach.  In London, mining stocks are driving the FTSE 100 higher \u2013 with the blue-chip index up 45 points to 7,234 points.     8.23am    Reminder: Twitter now owes roughly $1bn a year in interest payments on the debt which Elon Musk accrued when buying it, which is why he is seeking savings:  This is also a good point:      8.01am   Non-dom tax breaks being reviewed by the Treasury in effort to raise revenue  Treasury officials are examining whether the autumn statement could include changes to non-dom status and moves to raise taxes on dividends by cutting tax-free allowances. No final decisions have been taken but Whitehall sources said options were being examined by the Treasury\u2019s high net worth individuals policy team, my colleagues Juliette Garside and Jessica Elgot report. Changes could include reducing the time period over which high net worth individuals can avoid tax on their worldwide income. Experts suggest that cutting the duration from 15 to five years could raise an additional \u00a31.6bn a year. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, is also looking at cutting the tax-free threshold for shareholders\u2019 earnings from dividends from its current level of \u00a32,000 \u2013 though a more ambitious move would be to increase the percentage of tax paid at the three thresholds, the highest of which is just under 40%.  The Daily Telegraph reports that Hunt is also considering an increase in the headline rate of capital gains tax (CGT), to help plug the \u00a350bn hole in Britain\u2019s public finances.      7.57am   German factory orders slump  German industrial orders have fallen more than expected in September, adding to fears that Europe\u2019s largest economy is sliding into recession. New orders at German factories fell by 4.0% month-on-month, including a 7% tumble in foreign orders. Analysts had expected a much smaller fall, to 0.5%. Orders for heavy duty capital goods (such as machinery) fell 6%, while demand for intermediate goods used to make products were down 3.4%, as the world economy slowed.       7.49am   Falls in UK mortgage rates predicted   Banks and building societies are expected to cut the costs of UK fixed-rate mortgages a little, despite Thursday\u2019s large interest rate hike from the Bank of England. The current high costs of fixed rates were set when markets had expected aggressive future rises in the base rate \u2013 but expectations had already subsided as the turmoil in the borrowing markets eased.  So with the Bank now pushing back against market expectations, mortgages could become a little cheaper, having surged since the mini-budget. Simon Gammon, managing partner at mortgage broker Knight Frank Finance, said (via the FT):  \u201cWe are expecting fixed rates to continue to fall back slightly \u2014 they are still overpriced because lenders don\u2019t have an appetite for a lot of fixed-term lending right now, but with a period of stability, you can expect that to change.\u201d   David Hollingworth, director at L&amp;C Mortgages, said:   \u201cLenders could see their way to dropping fixed rates back a little bit. There\u2019s more scope for them to do that.\u201d  More here: Falls in UK mortgage rates predicted as BoE signals dovish outlook     7.36am         7.28am   BBC: Sizewell new nuclear plant and high speed Northern rail under review   The Sizewell C nuclear power plant in Suffolk is reportedly under review as the Government looks to cut spending to fill the UK\u2019s fiscal \u2018black hole\u2019. The new reactor, located some 30 miles north-east of Ipswich, was expected to be built by energy firm EDF. Boris Johnson had promised \u00a3700 million of taxpayers\u2019 money to the project in his final policy speech in early September as he sought to make energy security part of his legacy as prime minister. But a Government official has now told the BBC:  \u201cWe are reviewing every major project - including Sizewell C.\u201d  The 3.2 gigawatt power station is planned to sit alongside the existing Sizewell B nuclear reactor on the Suffolk coast, and could generate electricity for 6m homes for up to 60 years.  Former PM Liz Truss\u2019s pledge to build a major rail scheme in northern England in full could also be scaled back. This high-speed link was expected to eventually connecting Northern towns and cities from Hull to Liverpool, through Bradford. But the plans for the rail line - known as Northern Powerhouse Rail - are now expected to be reduced. Business secretary Grant Shapps told the BBC:  The line itself can deliver a 33-minute journey from Manchester to Leeds, quadruple nearly the capacity of that line, and do so without having to wait an extra 20 years beyond the delivery of what the upgrade can do. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t really much point in going and blasting new tunnels through the Pennines. \u201cIt\u2019s not true to say we\u2019re not delivering on what we said we would do on levelling up the north.\u201d  Here\u2019s the full story: Sizewell new nuclear plant under review  Updated at 7.42am GMT    7.27am   Twitter sued for mass layoffs by Musk without enough notice  Twitter is being sued over Elon Musk\u2019s plan to eliminate about 3,700 jobs at the social-media platform, Bloomberg reports. A class-action lawsuit was filed Thursday in San Francisco federal court, arguing that the company is violating federal and California law by not giving enough notice. Here\u2019s the details:  The federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act restricts large companies from mounting mass layoffs without at least 60 days of advance notice. The lawsuit asks the court to issue an order requiring Twitter to obey the WARN Act, and restricting the company from soliciting employees to sign documents that could give up their right to participate in litigation. \u201cWe filed this lawsuit tonight in an attempt the make sure that employees are aware that they should not sign away their rights and that they have an avenue for pursuing their rights,\u201d Shannon Liss-Riordan, the attorney who filed Thursday\u2019s complaint, said in an interview.    Updated at 8.47am GMT    7.27am   Introduction: Twitter mass layoffs begin  Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. It\u2019s a grim day for Twitter staff, as Elon Musk will begin mass job cuts just a week after acquiring the social media platform. The social network\u2019s offices are temporarily closed, while staff wait to learn by email whether they\u2019ve been retained, or fired. Around half the company\u2019s workforce could be laid off.   The company said in an email to staff on Thursday.  \u201cIn an effort to place Twitter on a healthy path, we will go through the difficult process of reducing our global workforce on Friday.  Musk already fired several top Twitter executives, including CEO Parag Agrawal, finance chief, Ned Segal, and legal affairs and policy chief, Vijaya Gadde. Having bought Twitter for $44bn, Musk is now trying to make the company profitable. On Thursday, Musk directed Twitter\u2019s teams to free up $1bn in annual infrastructure cost savings by slashing funding for cloud services and servers. He has floated a number of ideas to make profit at Twitter, including a plan to charge for \u201cverified\u201d badges, and creating an \u201ceverything app\u201d that would combine several platforms into one.  Also coming up today Households and businesses are digesting the Bank of England\u2019s warning that Britain faces its longest recession since the 1920s if interest rates soared as high as markets had predicted. But the BoE also pushed back against those expectations yesterday, even as it announced its largest interest rate rise for three decades, to 3%.  The latest US jobs report will be closedly watched, for any signs that America\u2019s employment market is weakening. Economists predict around 200,000 new jobs were created in October, down from 263,000 in September. A slowdown in hiring, and wage growth, could be a signal that the high inflation gripping the US economy might soon begin to ease.  A court ruling could decide whether taxi firms outside London should be forced to pat VAT on their journeys, which could push up prices by 20%. A ruling is expected to be handed down today after the ride-sharing app sued Sefton council in Merseyside over VAT terms for operators outside London.

                    "body": "Australia has rolled back a ban on exporting sheep to the Middle East during the hottest months of the year in a move animal rights groups say ignores scientific recommendations introduced to protect animal welfare. The Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment announced adjustments to the summer export ban this week, based on climatological data that it said resulted in an increased risk of heat stress in the Persian Gulf in May, and reduced risk of heat stress for sheep travelling through the Red Sea in early June. The live export of sheep to most ports in the Middle East is banned from 1 June to 14 September. But Australian exporters will be allowed to take sheep through the Red Sea to Israel from 1 to 14 June. The ban on exporting to some Persian Gulf destinations, including Qatar but not the major live export ports of Oman and Kuwait, will begin a week early on 22 May.  Dr Jed Goodfellow from the Australian Alliance for Animals said the changes were contrary to the findings of a heat stress review commissioned by the government, and could result in sheep deaths. The McCarthy review, commissioned after whistleblower footage showing sheep panting and experiencing heat stress during a deadly voyage on the Awassi Express in August 2017, identified heat stress as a risk on all shipments occurring between May and October. The summer export ban, first introduced in 2019, has only ever run from June to September, to allow Australia\u2019s two remaining live sheep exporters access to key global markets. Goodfellow said allowing sheep to be exported through the Red Sea in June would push them to their \u201cbiological limit\u201d and risked a significant mortality event. \u201cYou get one adverse weather event, temperatures higher than expected, and basically half of the sheep on the ship could die,\u201d he said. Goodfellow said the adjustment to the summer ban, which followed lobbying from exporters, showed that the trade would not be able to exist if all the scientific advice around reducing heat stress was followed. \u201cIt just shows the fact that the trade is fundamentally incompatible with acceptable welfare standards,\u201d he said. \u201cThe business model is based on a degree of animal suffering, because if you act on the science and in accordance with animal welfare the trade becomes unviable very very quickly.\u201d  Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning   The agriculture department in February announced it would be conducting \u201cadditional stakeholder engagement\u201d on its review of live sheep exports during the Middle Eastern summer, which is expected to be completed by the end of June. It also said it was funding ongoing research by LiveCorp and the export industry, which \u201cwill further ascertain and align sheep physiological and behavioural changes observed during a voyage with other data\u201d. \u201cThis will include additional onboard data collection including using automated rumen data loggers to continuously measure sheep core body temperature,\u201d it said. The chief executive of RSPCA Australia, Richard Mussell, said there was no need to conduct additional research. \u201cAll the data and evidence is already there \u2013 it\u2019s just being dismissed,\u201d he said. \u201cLive export does not enable the most basic of animal welfare needs.\u201d Mussell said the decision to wind back part of the summer ban was \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s also very worrying that these regulations have been put in place now, on the eve of a federal election being called \u2013 when parliament may not sit again for months and so may not have the chance to scrutinise these last-minute changes,\u201d he said. Animals Australia director Lyn White said the three-month ban was \u201calready grossly inadequate\u201d and reducing it would \u201cincrease the perils sheep will face\u201d. Greens senator, Mehreen Faruqi, said it was concerning that the change had been made without parliamentary oversight. \u201cThe Senate has been denied the opportunity to do its job in scrutinising these changes and considering whether to disallow them before they come into effect,\u201d she said."

                    "body": "Energy bills could hit \u00a33,850 a year by Christmas \u2013 three times what households were paying at the start of 2022 \u2013 according to the latest estimates by experts. Now the government has revealed further details on its already announced energy bills support scheme, under which millions of households will get a \u00a3400 discount on their energy bills this winter. Who is eligible? The energy bills support scheme applies to consumers in England, Scotland and Wales. All households in Great Britain with a domestic electricity connection are eligible for the support. The 1% of homes without a connection \u2013 including those who do not have a direct relationship with an energy supplier, such as park home residents \u2013 will receive equivalent financial help, with more details to be announced in the autumn. The government said it is \u201curgently working\u201d to make sure households in Northern Ireland get the equivalent of the support \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. When will it be paid?  The \u00a3400 discount will be paid in six monthly instalments beginning in October this year. In October and November, households will see a \u00a366 discount on their energy bills. This will rise to \u00a367 a month from December through to March 2023. It will be paid on a monthly basis, regardless of when consumers usually pay their bills. How will I get the money? The way households will receive the discounts depends on what kind of electricity meter they have, and how they pay their energy bills. Direct debit customers will automatically get a deduction to the amount collected, or as a refund to their bank account after the bill is paid. Standard credit customers, payment card customers and smart prepayment meter customers will see the discount automatically applied as a credit in the first week of each month.  Households with a traditional \u201cnon-smart\u201d prepayment meter will receive vouchers in first week of each month, issued by text, email or post. Customers will be able to redeem these at their normal top-up point. Students and other tenants who rent properties where their energy bills are included in their rent should also receive the payment. \u201cIn these circumstances, landlords who resell energy to their tenants should pass the discounted payments on appropriately, in line with Ofgem rules to protect tenants,\u201d the guidance says. What are the downsides? The government has warned consumers to be alert to potential scammers claiming to be involved in the energy bill payment process and stresses that you will not be asked for your bank details during the process.  Charities and campaigners have raised concerns that the more than 2 million \u201cnon-smart\u201d prepayment meter customers, who include some of the country\u2019s poorest and most vulnerable households, could have difficulties accessing the support. Maureen Fildes of the fuel poverty charity National Energy Action said she was fearful that some people using prepayment meters may struggle to get the vouchers. \u201cA lot of people on prepayment meters don\u2019t have a lot of interaction with the energy supplier; they just top up as and when they need to,\u201d she told the BBC. \u201cIf it\u2019s a paper voucher, we\u2019d like to ensure that people don\u2019t ignore post from their supplier. It\u2019s not going to be another bill; it is going to be some level of support.\u201d What other support is available? There is other government support available to help families who are struggling with the rising cost of living, including a \u00a3650 one-off payment for about 8 million households on means-tested benefits.  Pensioners who receive the winter fuel payment will also get a one-off \u00a3300 payment at the same time, and there is a \u00a3150 cost of living payment for about 6 million people who claim certain disability payments. Households who are struggling with their energy bills should contact their supplier because there may be other help available, such as a hardship fund or payment plans to help pay off debt. Rules set by Ofgem, the energy regulator, mean suppliers have to offer payment plans people can afford and customers can ask for \u201cemergency credit\u201d if they use a prepay meter and cannot top up."

                    "body": "\u201cWhy is it \u2018Wem-ber-lee\u2019, by the way? I saw it written down that way,\u201d asks J\u00fcrgen Klopp from the far end of a table inside Liverpool\u2019s plush new training centre in Kirkby. After a mumbled and aborted attempt to sing him the answer, Klopp\u2019s curiosity is satisfied, but he is clearly a little rusty on matters relating to what his fans once dubbed \u201cAnfield South\u201d. As are his team. Together they have lifted trophies in Madrid, Doha, Istanbul and behind closed doors at Anfield. But nothing at Wembley. There is a lasting need, explains the Liverpool manager, to correct that in the Carabao Cup final on Sunday. \u201cWe will try with everything to have a Wembley moment,\u201d Klopp says. \u201cWe all know that in this moment the people are really happy with this team. But in 20 years if you talk about this team, I would not be surprised if people would say, if we don\u2019t win anything any more: \u2018Yes they were good but they should have won more.\u2019 That\u2019s why we should try to win a few things now. The next chance, the best chance, is this weekend against Chelsea when it is really tricky. We can\u2019t sit here and talk about it like it\u2019s already ours. Chelsea just won the Club World Cup and we know how great that feels. They are desperate to put another in the trophy room.\u201d  Wembley finals have brought only deflation so far for Klopp, who heard \u201cWem-ber-lee\u201d sung with much more gusto by the Kop when Liverpool routed Leeds 6-0 on Wednesday. \u201cI had two finals and lost twice, but that is not too bad because I am a man for the third chance,\u201d he says. \u201cI needed a couple of runs to win the Champions League. But no bad feelings. It is a great stadium. I really love it.\u201d One guaranteed change for Klopp\u2019s third appearance in a Wembley final is, well, his appearance. For Borussia Dortmund\u2019s 2013 Champions League final defeat by Bayern Munich he swapped his usual tracksuit for a suit. In the 2016 League Cup final, Liverpool\u2019s last visit to Wembley, he did the same. There has been, and there will be, no repeat, although he maintains that is not because of how those finals ended.  \u201cI am not overly superstitious,\u201d he says. \u201cI will not wear a suit on Sunday but not because I am superstitious. Someone told me before the League Cup final that I needed to wear a suit. With the Champions League in 2013, honestly, it is really silly but someone told me that it was expected to wear a suit on the touchline and then when I saw the first coach next to me without a suit I thought: \u2018Are you kidding me?!\u2019 No, I will not wear a suit for a football game unless it is a rule. I don\u2019t go as a tramp to a wedding \u2013 there are things you have to wear \u2013 but if I have a free choice I won\u2019t. \u201cIf I look back on the pictures from the Champions League final after we became champions and how I look there, I couldn\u2019t care less. I look completely outraged, hat there, cap over there, bad shave \u2013 really not cool. It is not that I want to look like that but it just happened. I cannot think around the game about how I look. I can\u2019t. I tried really hard and I never feel comfortable. For me, somebody just has to put the things by my place in the dressing room and we go from there. I could stand there in swim shorts \u2013 as long as we win people will be happy. If we don\u2019t win, it will be a big story. I will not wear swim shorts, though.\u201d Klopp does not have a pre-cup final routine. \u201cNothing will change,\u201d he says. \u201cI will wake up long before the wake-up call, go for breakfast, wait for all the others to come down and when they arrive we will have a walk if possible.\u201d His mood does alter in the hours before a final, however, even with the experience of 10 previous such occasions as a manager. \u201cNervous is not the right word; I get tense. Before the Champions League final [in 2019] I was really afraid as losing two Champions League finals is not nice. I was really afraid of being alone beforehand, sitting in a room trying to prepare a meeting and what to say. You sit there for three or four hours, because it\u2019s a late game, and you can go nuts. But I just fell asleep. I was really happy with myself! I hope I have the same mindset on Sunday but, in the end, the boys will decide it.\u201d  The 54-year-old has been recharged this season by Liverpool\u2019s relentless pursuit of four trophies and the return of full-capacity stadiums. The two are not unconnected. Last season left him drained as injuries destroyed Liverpool\u2019s central defence and their defence of the Premier League title. Klopp twice felt compelled to publicly deny rumours about quitting.  \u201cI have always been appreciative of things,\u201d he says. \u201cI really don\u2019t take any of it for granted, but playing in an empty stadium was a tough one. I am an emotional coach, we are an emotional team, we are an emotional club. We are not like a little bit here, a little bit there. We need this extra bit. That was obviously not there in the most difficult situation we had. Injury-wise, it was absolutely crazy. In some moments it was the hardest time of our football lives because you are still Liverpool but with half-cut wings. You try to fly but it is pretty difficult. \u201cI never thought more about football, and I think a lot about football, than in this period. How can we make it work? How can we make it so we just have a chance? That was really tough, while everyone was talking about the former champion and now the worst-ever defending champion. Thank you very much, that was really nice. It was an incredibly intense season and, yes, I was more than happy for a holiday. For the first 10 days I didn\u2019t take one time the phone out and ask: \u2018Could we have this player?\u2019 I couldn\u2019t have cared less at that moment. We were all really drained. Just finished. Done.\u201d  Klopp discovered he was \u201ccalmer than I thought in difficult moments\u201d last season but trying to protect a depleted squad\u2019s confidence, while enduring a club record run of six consecutive home league defeats this time last year, tested his man-management skills to the limit. \u201cThe most difficult thing in my job is to explain a defeat,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have much more questions. It\u2019s easy to say we won and we were great. You are in a good mood and you don\u2019t actually have to explain everything \u2013 we talk about individual performances such as Mo [Salah] scoring 150, 108 goals for Sadio [Man\u00e9], Luis D\u00edaz fantastic. Then you lose a game and I can only say maximum 40% of what is really happening. I can\u2019t say: \u2018It\u2019s because he hasn\u2019t been performing for six weeks\u2019 or whatever. I would never say that because it\u2019s not the truth anyway. It would just help me maybe to blame somebody else, so we go around it and that keeps you in a cage.  \u201cIf I open up a massive problem in a press conference then three days later we have to play again. I have to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen so I try to be as honest as somehow possible but then explain a defeat without blaming individuals and without saying it\u2019s the weather or whatever. And the weather is sometimes a problem! That made it so intense. It was so hard. You don\u2019t have solutions player-wise because the players are just not there, so how can we keep the others confident until we are in a different moment? It\u2019s not cool. I would go home and think: \u2018That\u2019s why they pay me that much money.\u2019 In other moments I still don\u2019t understand why they do it but in these moments I think: \u2018Ah, yes, that\u2019s why it is.\u2019\u201d And for Premier League title races, Champions League glory and, Klopp hopes, Wembley moments."

                    "body": "We are one year on from the Football Assocation transferring responsibility for Women\u2019s Super League and Women\u2019s Championship match officials to the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL). There is still no timeframe for the full professionalisation of referees operating in the top two tiers of the women\u2019s game, despite a clamouring for improvement, but the passionate and pioneering referee Bibiana Steinhaus-Webb is leading the push. Having begun refereeing in the Frauen Bundesliga in 1999, the 43-year-old German became the first woman to referee in the men\u2019s Bundesliga in the 2017-18 season. Now she oversees officiating in England.  She says: \u201cThe English competition is one of the strongest in the world and it definitely attracted me to this job as well as Kelly Simmons [the FA\u2019s head of the women\u2019s professional game] and Mike Riley [general manager of the PGMOL], who have been very convincing about the structures and investment they are willing to put in place and the future picture that they shared with me. \u201cIf that had not happened, I probably would have stayed somewhere else. So, it\u2019s not only the dedication that they have shown, it\u2019s the willingness for change which attracted me.\u201d Change is needed. With games now broadcast across BBC Sport, Sky Sports and the FA Player, refereeing in the women\u2019s game is under increased scrutiny. The game is growing but the development of officiating has not kept pace. \u201cThe game has developed so much in recent years,\u201d Steinhaus-Webb says. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised by where it is and I\u2019m not surprised by the coverage and the content because it\u2019s exciting, it\u2019s thrilling..  \u201cBut I think we have invested so much in the players, in the coaches, in the venues, and referees have not really been a topic. So, it feels unfair for me to expect the referees to be at the same speed as the game. We have to get there, but you need the support and a bit of time to keep up with it.\u201d  Steinhaus-Webb describes placing referees for the women\u2019s game under the wing of the PGMOL as \u201ca first huge step towards professionalising the workforce in the women\u2019s game\u201d and that \u201cthe human resources [needed] to look after professional athletes is something totally different\u201d. Referees working in women\u2019s football now have access to the same support structure as those working in the men\u2019s game. \u201cThe support structure around referees is crucial,\u201d Steinhaus-Webb says. \u201cThere\u2019s so many different layers needed to make sure a referee is the best they can come three o\u2019clock.\u201d This includes a fitness team, psychological support, individual referee coaches, technical support and access to many hours of footage from across the men\u2019s and women\u2019s pyramids. The psychological element is increasingly important. \u201cWe had a situation at Manchester City vs Arsenal when the referee was hit by the ball, and a few seconds after City scored,\u201d Steinhaus-Webb says. \u201cAbi Byrne was the referee \u2026 we spoke about this incident for days and days, weeks and weeks. Abi is an international referee with a really strong mentality and a huge amount of experience.  \u201cFrom a technical point of view she did everything correctly, she got hit by the ball, the ball stayed within the same team, within their own penalty area almost, so that\u2019s not a promising attack and she let play continue. But then, in the way the game developed, they scored at the other end a few seconds after. \u201cFrom now on, expect every referee to blow the whistle. Going through this, the scrutiny, was the first time she really realised how much exposure the game actually has. [We must] take care of our people. They are human beings, and we have to make sure that they are in a mental state to be ready to take 300 decisions, approximately, in every single game.\u201d For referees operating in the women\u2019s game it can be tough to find the time to slot all this varying support around their work schedules and \u201cbuying more and more time of the referees\u201d to enable them to be in the best place to take full advantage is the next step. Steinhaus-Webb says: \u201cSome of the officials are on contract already so it\u2019s really about how much we can increase these contracts and how much we can see that others will join them. It\u2019s a personal decision as well. Where are you in your journey? Are you a youngster of 20-ish years looking for a full-time professional career in football or are you in the autumn of your career where you have to balance things in a different way? This is a very individual question to answer.\u201d  Sign up for our free women\u2019s newsletter!  Is there a risk, though, that with the professionalism of players pushing the game forward refereeing will require accelerated growth to keep pace? \u201cWe all want to develop the game in the best way possible and there is a certain amount of money in the game, and you have to prioritise where you want to put it and what you do first. Now, referees are a big part of it.  \u201cYes, the game has developed massively and the whole group of referees might not be at the top level yet, but what we have is a number of referees who can easily catch up with the game and are at an even higher level. The questions are: how do we support the whole group of people, the whole group of officials to get up there as well?\u201d"

A deadline for submissions is set for Wednesday, but barring a late unexpected entry, the UK-Ireland bid will be the only one on the table. This means the process of confirming the hosts can be expedited, with a meeting of Uefa\u2019s executive committee on 7 April providing the opportunity to rubber-stamp the decision.  Potential rivals have fallen away after the five nations confirmed interest enthusiastically supported by the tournament organisers, Uefa. Italy is expected to bid for Euro 2032 instead, and a potential Russian bid has been made impossible following the invasion of Ukraine. With Wembley able to host the final, and other matches to be held in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and elsewhere in England, the tournament offers Uefa the closest thing to a guarantee of sold-out stadiums and the chance to recoup money lost to the pandemic. A decision to determine the number of nations competing in 2028, with an increase from 24 countries to 32 deemed likely, will be made by Uefa before the end of the year. The five nations prioritised a bid for Euro 2028 after deciding to drop plans to stage the World Cup in 2030. The UK government had expressed a strong desire to host the World Cup but a feasibility study conducted by the English FA found \u201cmany areas of uncertainty\u201d with the proposal. The bid has not been damaged by the disorder that marred last July\u2019s Euro 2020 final at Wembley. The five nations would not automatically qualify for the tournament because Uefa grants that privilege only when a maximum of two countries are chosen as hosts. However the Guardian understands that the five nations share a belief that each should be able to compete in the finals."

Enjoy your weekend, whether you\u2019re indulging in finals footy or enjoying the bounties of spring. I\u2019ll be barracking for the Raiders and the Pies. Here are the major developments of the day:  Interest rate changes could take up to two years to play out in full, the Reserve Bank of Australia governor, Philip Lowe, has warned, with house prices to drop by as much as 10%. Lowe said that while \u201cwages are not driving inflation\u201d, how salaries rise will determine how much rates will have to rise. The Labor MP Jerome Laxale has accused the Reserve Bank of \u201cusing outdated and outmoded data\u201d when making decisions on interest rates, claiming the central bank was ignoring renters. Australia\u2019s biggest renewable hydrogen project will go ahead in the Pilbara, with support from the federal and state governments. The court has lifted suppressions that would have stymied the media\u2019s ability to report on a landmark case launched by the tax office whistleblower Richard Boyle following an intervention by the Guardian. And in a win for the ACT, the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, and ACT chief minister, Andrew Barr, are discussing ACT border expansion plans.   Updated at 9.51am BST    9.20am    Meanwhile, patient Brits are continuing to queue for hours upon hours to say goodbye to the Queen.  If you haven\u2019t read it, this story is well worth a read on the politeness of a British queue.       9.02am    This graph shows the relative stagnation of vaccination doses.   Updated at 9.25am BST    8.42am    Pilbara renewable hydrogen project to proceed with government support  Australia\u2019s biggest renewable hydrogen project will go ahead in the Pilbara, with support from the federal and state governments, AAP reports. The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena) today announced a grant of $47.5m towards French energy company ENGIE\u2019s green hydrogen and ammonia project near Karratha in Western Australia. The climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, said the project would help Australia become a world leader in hydrogen generation.  As we move to a more renewable economy, hydrogen will become an increasingly important part of our energy mix, and will be important in supporting industrial and hard to abate sectors.  Arena\u2019s chief executive, Darren Miller, said the plant could make an immediate difference as fossil fuels would be replaced by renewable energy to make hydrogen. The $87.1m Yuri project includes a 10MW electrolyser to produce renewable hydrogen, powered by solar, with lithium-ion batteries for energy storage, and will be one of the world\u2019s largest. The largest electrolyser currently operating in Australia is the 1.25MW hydrogen plant located in Adelaide\u2019s Tonsley innovation district in South Australia.  Updated at 8.47am BST    8.31am         8.18am    Papua New Guinea celebrates its 47th independence day Neighbouring nation Papua New Guinea is celebrating its 47th independence day today. The prime minister has commemorated the occasion on social media, reiterating the federal government is \u201ccommitted\u201d to strengthening relations between the states.  Foreign minister Penny Wong visited Papua New Guinea at the end of August as part of Pacific tour, where the country\u2019s foreign minister confirmed a security deal with Australia was on the cards by the end of the year.  Updated at 8.19am BST    8.04am    Almost 1% of all adults in the Northern Territory in prison at any one time, report says The rate of imprisonment among adults is among the highest in the world, with Indigenous people significantly over-represented, AAP reports. A new report from the Justice Reform Initiative says incarceration rates in the region are four times the Australian average for adults \u2013 and five times higher for children. Prisoner numbers have grown by more than 30% over the past decade, with the number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adults in prison rising by 34%.  Indigenous people are significantly over-represented, accounting for 85% of all inmates despite making up only 26% of the NT population. Almost three-quarters of people in prison have been locked up before, and 35% are being held while unsentenced. Children on remand regularly account for more than 80% of all young people in custody, the report says. Justice Reform Initiative\u2019s executive director, Mindy Sotiri, said there was a clear need for greater investment in policies and programs to break the cycles of disadvantage which kept bringing people back to prison at enormous cost to taxpayers.  The evidence is clear \u2013 prison does not reduce the likelihood of reoffending. It entrenches existing disadvantage and increases the likelihood of ongoing criminal justice system involvement, often over generations.  The report found taxpayers bankroll more than $146.6m on prisons in the Territory each year, with $122,496 required to keep each adult in jail.  Updated at 8.11am BST    7.51am    Wow.       7.42am   Queensland records 71 Covid deaths  Queensland recorded 2,280 new Covid cases in the past week and 71 deaths. As of 13 September, there were 183 people being treated in hospital with the virus including nine people in ICU.       7.34am    Body located by police divers in a creek at Ayr, south of Townsville The 48-year-old Ayr man went missing in Plantation Creek around 1.30am on 14 September. He and a second man were walking along Pool Street around 1am. They then tracked through a football field and the golf course before entering Plantation Creek between Kennedy Street and Edward Street, police said. The second man returned to the creek bank and called to his friend, but couldn\u2019t find him and didn\u2019t see him exit the creek. Ayr\u2019s acting officer in charge, acting senior sergeant Sam Pyke, extended condolences to his family and loved ones.  I would like to thank the SES, Queensland Parks and Wildlife, QGAir and all the police officers involved for their vital assistance with this search. I also want to commend our police divers who worked in extremely difficult conditions to find the missing man.  Police will prepare a report for the coroner.  Updated at 7.37am BST    7.25am    I\u2019m not a conspiracy theorist by any means, but it is notable that Queensland\u2019s premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, has tweeted in support of the Brisbane Lions ahead of tonight\u2019s AFL preliminary final:  Yet in Victoria, Daniel Andrews is yet to throw in state support behind Geelong. Instead, he\u2019s posted a series of tweets about the West Gate Bridge:   Updated at 7.29am BST    7.15am    David Shoebridge attends Mardi Grass event calling for legalisation of marijuana Green senator and spokesperson for justice, David Shoebridge, is at Mardi Grass in Nimbin this weekend calling for the legalisation of marijuana. Shoebridge will be appearing on two panels and meeting with community members amid the festivities. Shoebridge:  When we talk of drug law reform and harm minimisation, we can start by stopping police and the courts ruining young people\u2019s lives for choosing to have a joint with some friends. Imagine the public not having to pay to be persecuted and getting rid of the hugely expensive ring of police that surrounds Mardi Grass every year, desperately searching for an illegal joint or two. If we get this campaign right a properly regulated legal cannabis industry will deliver a real economic return to regional Australia which has the land and the human resources ready to go \u2013 once we legalise it.   Updated at 7.21am BST    7.05am    An evacuation order has been issued for anyone at the Western Plains Tourist Park in Dubbo amid rising flood waters.   Updated at 7.05am BST    6.57am   Court lifts suppressions in whistleblower Richard Boyle case  The court has lifted suppressions that would have stymied the media\u2019s ability to report on a landmark case launched by tax office whistleblower Richard Boyle following an intervention by the Guardian. In 2018, Boyle blew the whistle on the Australia Taxation Office\u2019s use of extraordinary garnishee powers to claw back debts from taxpayers and businesses, first speaking out internally, before approaching the ABC and Fairfax. He is now facing 24 charges, including the alleged disclosure of protected information and unlawful use of listening devices to record conversations with other ATO employees, and faces a potentially lengthy term of imprisonment if convicted. Boyle has taken the unprecedented step of invoking Australia\u2019s whistleblower protections to shield himself against prosecution. It is the first time the Public Interest Disclosure act has been used in such a way, and Boyle\u2019s case is widely regarded as a major test of the nation\u2019s ability to protect whistleblowers. Last month, after the Guardian and other outlets requested access to documents in the case, commonwealth prosecutors sought suppression orders, which would have hindered the ability to report on the whistleblower case. It argued such reporting would have prejudice Boyle\u2019s criminal trial, should it proceed. Guardian Australia intervened, arguing the suppressions were too broad and unnecessarily infringed on the principles of open justice. District court judge Liesl Kudelka on Friday decided to lift the suppressions and grant access to key documents outlining Boyle\u2019s case. She did so after Boyle indicated he opposed the making of the suppression orders. The decision paves the way for other media to report on the landmark PID act case brought by Boyle, which is set to begin on 4 October.  Updated at 7.02am BST    6.52am    Residents in northern Victoria told to move to higher ground due to flooding In Victoria, residents on the Murray River downstream of Tocumwal to Barham are being urged to move to higher ground amid a moderate flood warning.  There is also a moderate flood warning in place for Seven and Castle Creeks at Euroa. Meanwhile, a minor flood warning has been issued for parts of the Macquarie River and the South Esk River in Tasmania.  The BoM warned moderate flooding was possible at Fingal and Lewis Hill from this evening. Minor flooding downstream at Llewellyn and Perth was predicted for this weekend.  Updated at 7.07am BST    6.43am    Experts optimistic the end of Covid-19 pandemic is in sight Public health experts are increasingly optimistic the end of the Covid-19 pandemic is in sight, AAP reports. The World Health Organization has advised the pandemic could soon be over, with the weekly number of global deaths continuing to decline. Epidemiologist Prof Tony Blakely told the ABC it felt like the end.  We are in a much better position now. We have a lot of immunity from vaccines and natural infection. If we don\u2019t see anything much different from Omicron come along in the next six months or so, I think we are looking pretty good.  Prof Jane Halton, who chairs an association called the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, said while Covid-19 deaths were underestimated, the numbers were looking positive. Halton said while the virus was unpredictable, it was \u201camazing\u201d that almost two-thirds of the global population had been double vaccinated.  If we don\u2019t see another particularly nasty variant I think people will be feeling quite optimistic.  But independent MP Monique Ryan is concerned the federal government has moved too quickly to change virus rules. Ryan, who was the neurology director at Melbourne\u2019s Royal children\u2019s hospital before entering parliament, wants a national summit on Covid-19 to discuss a plan in the event of increased infections and pressure on hospitals. The latest national data on Covid-19 cases and deaths is being progressively this afternoon. It is the first time the figures are released on a weekly rather than daily basis.  Updated at 6.49am BST    6.33am   Labor MP accuses RBA of making decisions based on \u2018outdated and outmoded data\u2019  Labor MP Jerome Laxale has accused the Reserve Bank of \u201cusing outdated and outmoded data\u201d when making decisions on interest rates, claiming the central bank was ignoring renters. My colleague Peter Hannam has been covering the parliament\u2019s economics committee hearing all day (you can read through his coverage through a story and blog posts below) but afterwards, committee member Laxale was critical of the RBA\u2019s answers on interest rates and renters.  In a press release titled \u201cRBA Ignores Renters as rates set to rise again\u201d, Laxale \u2013 the first-term member for Bennelong \u2013 noted that the bank \u201cadmitted that they did not undertake dollar-by-dollar analysis on the impact of rate rises on those in the private rental market\u201d. Pointing to comments from the RBA governor, Phil Lowe, that interest rate rises were only having a marginal impact on rental prices, Laxale noted rent prices were rising quickly, and said the RBA needed to \u201cdrastically shift its analysis and decision-making process as our housing market evolves\u201d.  How can the Reserve Bank make accurate decisions on whether or not to raise rates, when they are ignoring upwards of 45% of those in the housing market? Today\u2019s admission proves that the data underpinning the Reserve Bank\u2019s decision-making process is flawed and that families could unnecessarily be bearing the brunt of existing and future interest rate rises.  Laxale called on the bank to do \u201cimmediate and comprehensive analysis\u201d on how rate rises were hurting renters.  Updated at 6.45am BST    6.20am    RBA governor says interest rates all but certain to rise in October The Reserve Bank of Australia is all but certain to raise interest rates in October \u2013 its sixth hike in a row \u2013 the RBA governor, Philip Lowe, told a parliamentary committee today. And banks are already taking stock.  You can read the full wrap from Peter Hannam here:   Updated at 6.22am BST    6.06am    High court to hear First Nations renters\u2019 case for government compensation over substandard housing in NT A small First Nations community in the Northern Territory has been granted leave by the high court, in a case which could have legal ramifications for Australian renters and landlords. The court has agreed to hear First Nations renters\u2019 case for compensation from the Northern Territory government. It will decide whether compensation is available for distress or disappointment suffered as a result of remote, dilapidated housing. It\u2019s the latest in a movement that began in 2016 for Enid Young, an elderly Eastern Arrernte woman from Ltyentye Apurte (Santa Teresa) in the remote Northern Territory. Young spent more than five years with an empty external doorframe to her property. The case brought by Young and other residents of Ltyentye Apurte requesting urgent repairs was first heard at the NT Civil and Administrative Tribunal in 2018. It then went to the NT supreme court and the NT court of appeal where the NT government argued against the standard of \u201chumane\u201d housing set by a NT Supreme Court Justice. Dan Kelly, solicitor at Australian Lawyers for Remote Aboriginal Rights, said:  The court of appeal found the NT government has a legal duty to provide people with a standard of housing that is not only safe, but reasonably comfortable, judged against contemporary standards.   Updated at 6.13am BST    5.55am    North-eastern Tasmanians told to be prepared to evacuate after flood warning Tasmania SES is urging people in north-eastern parts of the state to monitor weather conditions closely and be prepared to evacuate following the issuing of a flood advice warning for the St Marys area. Large rainfall totals up to 64mm were recorded overnight and into today. State flood controller Leon Smith said:  The South Esk River is expected to reach minor to moderate flood levels and flooding is expected to occur at St Marys. The SES has recently issued an advice warning for the St Marys area due to rises in the St Marys Rivulet, and we have deployed crews to the area who are ready to respond if needed. Rivers and creeks in the northeast and east are predicted to continue to rise into the afternoon before easing over the coming days. If you live in the South Esk, St Paul\u2019s and Break O\u2019Day River areas near Fingal, as well as the St Marys Rivulet you should monitor conditions and prepare now. If you have a flood emergency plan you should check it, so you know what to do if a flood occurs.

The idea was floated at a roundtable hosted by the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, today, as the state prepares for a housing summit next month. Palaszczuk said:  In the UK, 25% ... has to be for affordable or social housing in a new development. That\u2019s a great idea ... we want to explore that further.  Better use of existing vacant properties and land is also on the table as the state tries to address what has been described as a housing affordability crisis. Palaszczuk said:  I really want to thank Griffith University that has identified a property straight away that we can utilise ... 200 beds of unused student accommodation at [their] Mt Gravatt campus.  The state government will work with service providers to refurbish the rooms and make them available for those in crisis. The Catholic church has identified 90 properties that could be used across the state, the deputy premier, Steven Miles, said. Palaszczuk is now calling on other organisations with vacant assets to do the same. Queensland\u2019s housing summit will take place on 20 October.

Updated at 5.26am BST    5.12am   Bowen wants Australia to become a \u2018hydrogen exporting powerhouse\u2019  Australia\u2019s biggest renewable hydrogen project will go ahead in the Pilbara, with support from the federal and state governments, AAP reports. The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena) today announced a grant of $47.5m towards French energy company ENGIE\u2019s green hydrogen and ammonia project near Karratha in Western Australia.  The minister for climate change and energy, Chris Bowen, said the project would help Australia become a world leader in hydrogen generation.  As we move to a more renewable economy, hydrogen will become an increasingly important part of our energy mix, and will be important in supporting industrial and hard to abate sectors.  Arena chief executive, Darren Miller, said the plant can make an immediate difference, because fossil fuels were being replaced by renewable energy to make hydrogen. He said:  It is also a huge export opportunity for Australia to provide clean energy and emissions-free materials to the rest of the world.  The $87.1m Yuri project includes a 10-megawatt electrolyser to produce renewable hydrogen, powered by solar and lithium-ion batteries for energy storage, and will be one of the world\u2019s largest. Suppling hydrogen and electricity to Yara Pilbara Fertilisers at its neighbouring liquid ammonia facility, the project will produce up to 640 tonnes of renewable hydrogen per year. The project also received seed funding of $2m from the WA government two years ago as the state looks to be a global hub for hydrogen.  Updated at 5.30am BST    5.02am    Government knocks back proposal to review live sheep export ban Australia will continue bans on exporting live sheep to parts of the Middle East in the hottest parts of the northern hemisphere summer, with the federal government knocking back recommendations of an agriculture department review to reduce the amount of time such exporting is prohibited. The department\u2019s \u201cReview of live sheep exports by sea during the Northern Hemisphere summer\u201d, released Friday, said prohibitions on live export during the hottest parts of summer had protected animals from heat stress and should continue. Such rules prevent sheep from being shipped to certain countries in the Middle East during parts of June and September, and also place conditions such as the weight, breed and hair length of animals being exported, as well as the air flow in ships and how much the animals are fed. However, the report also stated that the \u201cwelfare of exported sheep could be maintained with a shortening of the length of the absolute prohibition period for Qatar, Oman and destinations to, or through, the Red Sea\u201d. It recommended shortening the prohibition on exports to Oman by 31 days and the Red Sea by 21 days, but adding 10 days with additional conditions for the Persian Gulf and Qatar. In a statement on its website, the agriculture department said it would implement recommendations around feeding, and greater data collection around heat, on ships. However, recommendations to reduce the prohibition period to certain destinations \u201cwill not be implemented\u201d. The report is available on the department\u2019s website.  Updated at 5.05am BST    4.40am    Fourteen rescued as inland NSW floods More than a dozen people have been rescued from flood waters in NSW as heavy rain continues to fall on already-saturated grounds and full dams, AAP reports. The SES said it received 14 flood rescue calls in the 24 hours to 10.30am Friday, most of them from Wellington, Forbes, Orange and nearby areas. Moderate to heavy rain on Thursday raised the Bell river at Wellington to a moderate flood peak. More showers are forecast for parts of inland NSW this weekend. The weather bureau said windy conditions and saturated soil could bring down trees and structures. The Macquarie River at Dubbo is expected to pass its moderate flood level about 5pm on Friday but should peak well below major flood level. Major flooding is possible on the Macquarie river in the Warren township and on the Lachlan river at Jemalong. Major flooding was reported at Euabalong on Friday morning. SES spokesman Greg Nash said:  We urge the public to drive to the conditions and make smart, safe decisions. Be aware that yesterday\u2019s rain will impact a number of river systems around the state and river heights may change quickly.   Updated at 4.49am BST    4.34am    SES issues flood alert for northern Tasmania Tasmanians in the north-east are being warned to monitor weather conditions closely, with a flood warning currently in place for the St Marys area. Large rainfall totals have occurred overnight and into today, with 64mm recorded at Grey and 30mm at St Helens. Leon Smith, the state flood controller, said this has resulted in river and creek levels rising:  The South Esk River is expected to reach minor to moderate flood levels and flooding is expected to occur at St Marys. Rivers and creeks in the north-east and east are predicted to continue to rise into the afternoon before easing over the coming days.   Updated at 4.38am BST    4.22am    Wait to see Queen\u2019s coffin approaching 12 hours into the early hours of the London morning At 4am in London, the queue to see the Queen lying in state in Westminster Hall is now almost a 12 hour-long wait, blown out from the 9 hours estimated earlier in the evening. According to the official site, the queue has exceeded its original maximum capacity that stretched from Westminster to Southwark Park. In Australian terms, 4.9 miles (7.9km) is roughly the distance from the Sydney Opera house to Coogee beach, or from the MCG to the other side of the West Gate Bridge.  If you want to understand the cultural phenomenon that is queuing in Britain, my colleague in London Martin Belam has this excellent read:   Updated at 4.34am BST    3.59am    The Labor government has re-appointed former Liberal prime minister Tony Abbott to the board of the Australian War Memorial.  Veterans\u2019 affairs minister Matt Keogh said:   Mr Abbott has served as a member of the Council since 2019 and his reappointment will provide the Council experience and stability during a seminal period.  Tony\u2019s experience is well known and his dedication and passion for serving our nation is undisputed Tony has always been an advocate for our nation\u2019s veterans.  The AWM has faced sustained criticism in recent years, both over its expensive expansion, which has already suffered cost blowouts, and its acceptance of donations from arms manufacturers.  The $500m expansion has been slammed as turning the AWM into a \u201ctheme park\u201d for modern military equipment, including by former directors of the memorial. Costs have already blown out by $50m, and there is internal reluctance within Labor to hand the memorial significantly more funds.  The memorial also confirmed earlier this year it was pursuing a new sponsorship deal from arms manufacturer Lockheed Martin despite being inundated with letters from veterans, historians and retired staff saying such arrangements are \u201cdegrading to the memory of our war dead\u201d. Keogh said:   I congratulate Tony on his re-appointment. I look forward to following the progress of the Australian War Memorial\u2019s redevelopment in the coming years closely, and trust Mr Abbott will play an integral role in it.   Updated at 4.11am BST    3.57am    The RBA\u2019s Lowe is asked, near the end of the marathon and quite thought-provoking meeting, about climate change and Australia\u2019s commitment to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Lowe said that Australia had been \u201con a different path\u201d from other nations and \u201cit was damaging us\u201d. Those comments might not have gone down too well with the Coalition members on the economics committee who didn\u2019t back the government\u2019s recent climate bill. There\u2019s a fair bet Labor, the Greens and the \u201cteal\u201d independents are going to remind them that even the central bank governor backs the call for greater climate action. Falling behind \u201cwhat international investors expect\u201d would dim Australia\u2019s appeal, Lowe was saying, adding it also hurt the country\u2019s ability to sell its story of clean energy. What\u2019s next? Lowe backing the return of a price on carbon? That would make sense - and perhaps that\u2019s a question for six months\u2019 time when the committee calls him back for a chat. And that\u2019s a wrap. (Story to follow - stay tuned.)  Updated at 4.00am BST    3.50am    Three people including a child were rescued in flood waters this morning from a vehicle near Obley, south of Dubbo, NSW State Emergency Services has confirmed.   Updated at 3.52am BST    3.43am    Victorian Labor to commit $4m to mental health hub for officers if re-elected In Victoria, police minister Anthony Carbines has announced a re-elected Labor government would funnel $4m into continuing the work of Blue Hub, a specialist mental health service for officers. The opposition has committed $20m to the hub.   Updated at 3.55am BST    3.38am    Flood warnings for inland NSW, severe thunderstorms in Queensland The Bureau of Meteorology has issued moderate flood warnings for several parts of inland NSW, around the Gwydir and Bogan rivers. Thunderstorms are also expected over eastern districts south of Townsville. The Bureau says severe thunderstorms are possible with damaging winds, large hail and heavy rain a risk in Capricornia and Wide Bay.    A minor flood warning is also in place for Mendooran in New South Wales.   Updated at 3.57am BST    3.31am    Lowe ends committee hearing on positive note As the committee hearing winds down, RBA governor Lowe wants to leave a more positive note. Yes, interest rates are rising but \u201cwe\u2019re in a much, much better place than we have been for a long time\u201d, he said. Why the long faces, Lowe wonders. There\u2019s basically not enough \u201ccelebration\u201d that we\u2019re at full employment. (Visions flash of crowds with flags waving, or perhaps long queues ... but they quickly fade.) \u201cThe best thing for people is to have a job,\u201d he says, noting that a higher share of Australia\u2019s population is now working than ever before, including the record high levels of female participation, and the lowest youth unemployment levels in decades. People are getting the hours they want to work, even if they have to work two (or more) jobs to do it. These are \u201cfantastic\u201d outcomes for people\u2019s incomes and opportunities, Lowe says. Some might quibble that even more fantastic would be pay at least keeping up with inflation and adding in productivity would be icing on a cake that\u2019s more than a bit overdue.  Updated at 3.48am BST    3.23am   ACT records no Covid deaths and 76 people in hospital  There were 465 new cases in the last reporting period, and one person is in intensive care.      3.17am   NSW records 115 Covid deaths and 1,290 people in hospital  There were 17,229 new cases in the weekly reporting period, and 29 people are in intensive care.   Updated at 3.23am BST    3.01am    Inflation expected to climb to 7.75% by the year\u2019s end In questions from Bert van Manen, a Queensland LNP MP, the RBA\u2019s Lowe laid out some pertinent points about what he looks for in inflation numbers. Yes, the RBA looks at the \u201cheadline\u201d consumer price index, well, as the name implies, it\u2019s what \u201cgets the most media coverage\u201d. It also powers the community\u2019s expectations about how high inflation will go. In the June quarter, that came in at 6.1%, or the highest in a couple of decades, and the RBA expects that to climb to 7.75% by the year\u2019s end. But it also looks at the \u201ctrimmed mean\u201d measure of underlying inflation to understand the \u201congoing momentum\u201d pushing up inflation. It lops off the 15 percentile changes on the upper and lower ends. In the June quarter, that rate was running at 4.9%, or the highest since the early 1990s. By either measure of inflation, though, \u201cat the moment, it\u2019s too high\u201d, with demand exceeding supply ... and those higher interest rates are needed to \u201cget the balance back\u201d. As a personal aside, Lowe mentions he joined the bank out of high school in 1980. He notes that in those days, organisations invested in their staff to improve their capabilities (in his case, supporting him and other colleagues to go to university night school). It\u2019s an approach \u201cwe\u2019ve gone away from\u201d as a society, Lowe says, with firms more reliant on importing talent rather than training it in-house.  Updated at 3.05am BST    2.56am    High court to hear Facebook appeal denying it \u2018carries on business\u2019 in Australia The high court has this morning granted special leave to appeal to Facebook, which is disputing a finding by the full federal court that it is \u201ccarrying on business\u201d in Australia. The Australian Information Commissioner filed proceedings against Facebook Inc and Facebook Ireland in the federal court in March 2020, alleging the social media platform committed serious and/or repeated interferences with privacy in contravention of Australian privacy law. In response, Facebook disputed that it was carrying on business in Australia, losing at first instance in September 2020 and again on appeal in February 2022. Today the high court agreed to hear Facebook\u2019s appeal against that ruling.  Updated at 3.02am BST    2.51am    Victorian Liberals pledge $125m for triple zero fix Victoria\u2019s opposition promises to pour an extra $125m into the state\u2019s triple zero system if it wins the upcoming state election, AAP reports. The funds would be used to upgrade IT, deliver extra staff training and recruit more frontline workers. The $125m would be in addition to the $330m already earmarked to overhaul triple zero in the 2022-2023 budget. The funding promise comes after a report by Victoria\u2019s inspector general for emergency management linked 33 deaths to ambulance call delays.  The opposition has previously said it would scrap the $35bn Box Hill to Cheltenham section of the suburban rail loop and direct the money into the health system if it won government. Liberal party leader Matthew Guy said Victorians need to be confident they will receive help quickly when they ring triple zero.  This November, Victorians have a clear choice \u2013 a triple zero service that works, or a train line from Cheltenham to Box Hill in 13 years\u2019 time.  The opposition wants to improve the program used to dispatch emergency vehicles, create a backup surge system and prioritise the recruitment of call taking and dispatch rolls.  Updated at 2.55am BST    2.41am    Lowe did not know Morrison had been sworn in as treasurer It was probably inevitable that RBA governor Philip Lowe would be asked whether he was aware that Scott Morrison had been sworn in as treasurer, one of five ministries on top of being prime minister. Sadly, perhaps, the answer was a firm \u201cno\u201d. Lowe told the House of Reps economic committee:  I was surprised as the rest of the community.  And with that political cul de sac, we go back to discussing the impact of higher rates on business (along with rising fuel costs and so on).  Updated at 2.47am BST    2.40am   Aussies hail Federer as the \u2018James Bond of tennis\u2019  Roger Federer won\u2019t be returning to have one last crack at Melbourne Park glory, but the sport in Australia will forever bathe in the glow of the man being hailed as \u201cthe James Bond of tennis\u201d, AAP reports. Australian tennis luminaries led the applause for the great man after hearing, at 41, Federer is to abandon competitive tennis after next week\u2019s Laver Cup in London. Doubles great Todd Woodbridge on the Nine Network said:  We\u2019ll miss the legend who\u2019s driven the sport to new heights. His game was elegant, masterful, it took tennis to new levels, he used to float around the court, nobody moved more gracefully \u2013 and he taught us it was OK to cry. I remember when he walked out on Centre Court at Wimbledon in this most magnificent old-fashioned blazer all done with the little gold trim with the big RF on it. That epitomised his class; to me, he\u2019s always been the James Bond of tennis.\u201d   In Hamburg, Australia\u2019s Davis Cup captain Lleyton Hewitt hailed his old rival as the greatest of their era. Hewitt, who played Federer 27 times, winning nine, said:  In the mid-2000s, Roger was nearly unbeatable \u2013 it was pretty much only Rafa [Nadal] that could get him, especially on the clay but most of all he\u2019s been a great ambassador for our sport He deserved to go out on his terms. For him to play one more Wimbledon would have been special, but when you get to his age, it\u2019s not easy. He\u2019s done everything in the sport he could ever dream of.  Australian No 1 Alex de Minaur, fresh from his Davis Cup win, saluted a \u201cflat-out genius on the court\u201d, recalling how in 2019 he played Federer in the final of his hometown tournament in Basel and got schooled 6-2 6-2.  Yeah, a nice little lesson. I was foolish enough to think I had a genuine chance to win. I just remember being completely outclassed, he was just on another level. I tried six, seven different game plans out there but was basically at his mercy. Yet it was a cool experience, one of the few times I ever walked off a court when I was like, \u2018you know what, too good\u2019. It was actually fun getting taught a lesson by Roger. He\u2019s an icon of our sport, one of the guys I looked up to and I\u2019m pretty sure every person on the planet has looked up to. If you\u2019re growing up and you don\u2019t want to be like him, you don\u2019t have a lot of idea about tennis.  Jelena Dokic, women\u2019s junior world champion at the same time Federer ruled the teenage men\u2019s game, noted on Nine:  It wasn\u2019t just the greatness of his tennis, but how humble he was, how gracious he was, what an inspiration he was. I always look at people at how they are behind the scenes, on the practice courts or the locker room, and there\u2019s no one nicer than Roger Federer. He\u2019d be really kind to you. We\u2019ll always talk about him being a great tennis player, but it\u2019s important to say what a great person he is too.   Updated at 2.46am BST    2.32am   Interest rate changes could take up two years to play out in full, RBA boss says  The RBA\u2019s Lowe makes the point that there is a long tail to the effects of interest rate changes. In fact, the \u201cmaximum effect\u201d takes 18-24 months to play out. That\u2019s more than the three-month lag that economists usually talk about (as variable borrowing rates, for instance, take time to adjust).How businesses respond to, say, changes in the Australian dollar exchange rate is one factor the bank watches, as is the shift in consumer spending. Lowe said households had accumulated $250bn in savings during the Covid years, above what they would have been expected to have socked away. How they are going to draw down that huge nest egg is one of the unknowns, not least because the savings were not evenly distributed across the population. That\u2019s \u201cwhy there\u2019s so much uncertainty\u201d, he said. As for whether the RBA\u2019s interest rate tool is sufficient to bring down inflation, Lowe said it was \u201ca blunt tool but a powerful one\u201d. And one that he\u2019s more than willing to keep wielding.  Updated at 2.50am BST    2.17am    Higgins accused seeks document about \u2018discrepancies\u2019 ahead of October trial The trial of the man accused of raping Brittany Higgins, Bruce Lehrmann, has been listed in the ACT supreme court for up to seven weeks beginning 4 October. Lehrmann has pleaded not guilty to assaulting Higgins at Parliament House in Canberra in 2019. In June, the trial was delayed over concerns comments made in the public domain may prejudice potential jurors. On Friday the ACT supreme court held a pre-trial hearing at which Lehrmann\u2019s counsel, Andrew Berger, revealed the defence is seeking a document that outlines Higgins\u2019 version of events to police from 2019 onwards and \u201csubsequent discrepancies\u201d. The document was originally described as available on request from the DPP, but when Lehrmann\u2019s defence asked for it, the DPP objected on the grounds it is privileged material (relating to communications between lawyer and client). Berger told the court the document \u201cdoesn\u2019t properly attract\u201d legal professional privilege, signalling that Lehrmann will now subpoena the AFP to seek a copy. It will then be up to the federal police whether they claim privilege over it. The court also heard on Friday that Lehrmann\u2019s team will consult with a barrister appointed by the DPP about what material from a Cellebrite report on the content of Higgins\u2019 phone might be disclosable. Justice Lucy McCallum warned she didn\u2019t want the pre-trial issues to \u201ckybosh the hearing date\u201d. McCallum observed that the relevance of the material in the report appeared to signal the defence was \u201cchasing cross-examination points\u201d relating to witness credibility, which could signal \u201ca very long trial\u201d. She said:  My primary function is to ensure Mr Lehrmann and the crown have a fair trial. But secondarily \u2013 I\u2019m not going to let cross examination go up hill and down dale for weeks and weeks.  Lehrmann\u2019s counsel, Steve Whybrow, assured the court it was not the defendant\u2019s intention to pursue every potential credit point but said \u201cthere is a body of material we need to examine the complainant about\u201d. The case returns for a further pre-trial mention on Wednesday 21 September.  Updated at 2.29am BST    2.16am    Lowe provides market wish list The RBA\u2019s Lowe\u2019s provides economics committee with a wish list (in answer to questions from Allegra Spender, the independent MP from Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs). Australia is a \u201clong way from optimal\u201d on taxes, Lowe says (without naming policies such as negative gearing). Similarly, how we select and pay for infrastructure, train and accumulate human capital from pre-school to universities, and reward innovation could all improve. And as for regulating the energy market, \u201cwe probably haven\u2019t nailed that\u201d, Lowe says in one of the morning\u2019s understandments. (Wonder if he thinks we should reserve some gas in eastern Australia rather than exporting every spare molecule of the fossil fuel?) He also says the RBA is doing a lot of work on climate change (not unrelated to fossil gas exports, either) and Lowe expects more \u201csupply shocks\u201d from extreme weather.  We\u2019ll have to factor that into our decision-making. We\u2019re spending a lot of time on climate-related issues, not just because they affect the economy but also the financial system.   Updated at 2.24am BST    2.12am    Push to let South Australian crime victims speak freely Victims of crime in South Australia may soon be able to speak freely in victim impact statements as the state government looks to prevent lawyers editing their words, AAP reports. Under current rules, the defence and prosecution can make changes to remove material from the statements that may be inadmissible. But attorney general Kyam Maher says that should be the responsibility of the judge or magistrate, not counsel.  The preparation and presentation of a victim impact statement is a victim\u2019s opportunity to tell their story to the sentencing court. That story should be in the victim\u2019s voice and should allow space for the victim to communicate their views without filter. Judges and magistrates are well-placed to resolve any issues around the admissibility of content.  The government will consult with the legal sector and victim advocates on changes to the Sentencing Act to remove any ability to edit a victim\u2019s statement, regardless of its content. The proposed changes follow criticism from the family of a murder victim who had their statement edited three times before it was presented to the court. Some of the changes came in the minutes leading up to the court hearing.  Updated at 2.32am BST    1.59am   Real wages are going to fall this year and next, Lowe predicts  The RBA\u2019s Lowe says that while \u201cwages are not driving inflation\u201d, how salaries rise will determine how much rates will have to rise. (He makes a point about the rising share of corporate profits in the economy and that it would be good to have that lowered too, but doesn\u2019t harp on it.) Real wages are going to fall this year and next, Lowe predicts, and that\u2019s \u201ca difficult message\u201d. So far Australia doesn\u2019t have the issue as in the US and the UK where wage growth is picking up to compensate people for inflation. \u201cI hope we can avoid that,\u201d he says. Why? Because if people demanded their wages rose at the pace of, say, 7%, the RBA would have have hike rates higher. Lowe goes into the importance of inflation psychology and inflation expectations, and the need to convince the public the RBA is serious about squashing inflation. If the public didn\u2019t believe that \u201cinterest rates would have to go up a lot and we don\u2019t want that\u201d, Lowe said. And now the first session ends ... with the sounds of Swan Lake (I think) being piped over the online link. Hope that\u2019s not cue for a \u2018black swan event\u2019.  Updated at 2.33am BST    1.47am    University drops Santos branding of kids\u2019 science roadshow Macquarie University has dropped Santos branding and support for a school science roadshow, after a senior Australian climate scientist complained sponsorship from a company expanding fossil fuel production was inappropriate. Prof Lesley Hughes asked her own institution, Sydney\u2019s Macquarie University, to pull out of hosting one of the events for the Santos Science Experience, arguing the company\u2019s expansion plans were putting children\u2019s future at stake.   Updated at 1.53am BST    1.37am    Another fiscal expansion could put pressure on RBA to lift cash rate further The RBA\u2019s Lowe veers into fiscal policy and notes that \u201canother significant fiscal expansion\u201d would put pressure on the bank to lift its cash rate further than otherwise would be the case. He adds, carefully, that such an increase \u201cis not my expectation\u201d in a cue to treasurer Jim Chalmers\u2019 budget planned for 25 October. Lowe adds he\u2019s \u201cnot concerned\u201d about any change in the government\u2019s fiscal policy \u201cin the near term.\u201d (Gareth Hamilton, the Queensland LNP MP, was asking about this issue, perhaps hoping for an attack line about excessive government spending counteracting the RBA\u2019s rate hikes.) Shortly before those comments, though, Lowe highlighted a \u201csignificant issue\u201d that even with the economy at the closest to full employment in 50 years and Australia\u2019s highest terms of trade ever (ie the price of our exports v what we pay for imports) we\u2019re still running budget deficits. He said:  We want really high-quality aged care, great education, world-class disability [care], fantastic national defence, great infrastructure - the community wants all these things from our governments.  Also, we haven\u2019t as a community worked out how to pay for it all, at least in the medium to long-term. Lowe, though, notes the outlook for Australia\u2019s economy is \u201cuncertain but still positive\u201d, at least for now. (Earlier he noted that China\u2018s economic woes could narrow Australia\u2019s ability to keep growing as interest rates rise to curb inflation.)  Updated at 1.42am BST    1.28am    Series of cold fronts coming for Victoria The Bureau of Meteorology is predicting cool, windy and showery weather. Looks like you might need to take out your hot water bottles if you put them away!   Updated at 1.37am BST    1.21am    RBA will be less likely to make predictions in future, Lowe says RBA\u2019s Lowe is now discussing how the bank made such a big forecast error in its projection that the cash rate might not have to increase until 2024 (but with various caveats, that people often ignored). Everybody got it wrong, Lowe said, all central banks. (Picking the Russian invasion of Ukraine was a big miss, for instance.) One response though will be the RBA is less likely to make projections. \u201cWe are much less inclined to do that in the future,\u201d Lowe said, adding that the bank would be \u201cvaguer\u201d as he\u2019s tried to be today. (Vague is in vogue, you might say.) It\u2019s a tough call because while there\u2019s a demand for the RBA to be a better communicator, the response is likely to be fuzzier in those communications. Guess that opens the door to more punditry and speculation. Here\u2019s how we reported this issue last week, by the way:   Updated at 1.30am BST    1.10am   More rate rises on the way and house prices could fall by 10%, RBA boss says  RBA\u2019s Lowe goes back to talk about the interest rate outlook, and says it\u2019s likely the board\u2019s meeting in October will discuss either a 25 or 50 basis point cash rate rise (eg to 2.6% or 2.85%). In other words, October\u2019s likely to have another rate rise for a sixth meeting in as many months. (It\u2019s not risen so consistently before.) Still, it\u2019s \u201cgetting closer\u201d to the point when it\u2019s no longer \u201csuper-sized\u201d rate rises that are needed, but rather the more common 25bp move. (In the US, the fixation is on a \u201cjumbo\u201d rate move of 100bp, or a full percentage point at the Federal Reserve\u2019s next meeting.) As for the impact of rising rates on house prices, Lowe said a drop of 10% wouldn\u2019t be surprising, but adds that would still leave them 15% higher over three years (after rising 25% in the two Covid pandemic years). We live in a country that complains when property prices rise too fast or fall too fast, Lowe notes.   Updated at 1.37am BST    1.07am    Government to probe RBA\u2019s aggressive interest rate hikes Guardian Australia\u2019s economics correspondent Peter Hannam has been keeping you up to date with RBA governor Phillip Lowe\u2019s opening address kicking off a three-hour public hearing. The member for Bennelong, Jerome Laxale, has shared some of the questions the House Economics Committee will want to ask Lowe after he finishes speaking.   Updated at 1.10am BST    1.03am    Still demand for cash, RBA governor says RBA governor Philip Lowe takes a brief moment to note (so to speak) about the bank\u2019s other activities. Cash is being used less and less frequently by Australians but it doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s weak demand for it. On average, it turns out, there is $102bn in cash outstanding, or almost $4,000 per Australian. Time perhaps to look down the back of the couch or under the bed to see if you\u2019ve put some money aside and forgotten it.  Updated at 1.05am BST    12.58am    Magpie duo in car crash on AFL final eve Two Collingwood players have been involved in a car crash on the eve of their club\u2019s AFL preliminary final against Sydney, AAP reports. Magpies Beau McCreery and Josh Carmichael were driving to Melbourne airport on Friday morning for their flight to Sydney when involved in an accident. Both McCreery, who is in Collingwood\u2019s team for the SCG final on Saturday afternoon and Carmichael, who is an emergency for the team, were not hurt.  Collingwood\u2019s football manager Graham Wright said in a statement:  The welfare of Beau, Josh and the driver of the other vehicle remains the absolute priority. Neither Beau nor Josh sustained any injuries and we will provide them with the support required in this situation.  Both players were cleared to fly to Sydney for the clash with the Swans.  Updated at 1.04am BST    12.55am    RBA is not on a preset path, governor says RBA\u2019s Philip Lowe turns towards what\u2019s coming. Lowe says that while inflation expectations have been \u201cwell-anchored\u201d, the sentiment is shifting as businesses see they can lift prices and consumers accept them. Lowe said:  It\u2019s important that we avoid a cycle where higher inflation leads to higher wages and inflation remains high.  He says that as for the outlook for interest rates, \u201cthe Reserve Bank board expects that further increases will be required\u201d to bring inflation back to within the RBA\u2019s 2-3% target. But, as Lowe has said previously (eg after the September cash rate hike to 2.35%), the RBA is not on a preset path \u201cespecially given the uncertainties\u201d at home and abroad. As there are lags in the impact of rate rises, the size and pace of increases will ease as the goal of inflation constraint gets nearer. So far, though, there\u2019s no notable straying from Lowe\u2019s previous comments.  Updated at 12.59am BST    12.52am    Consultation opens for coercive control laws The government today opens public consultation on national principles to address the issue of coercive control.  The attorney general Mark Dreyfus wrote on social media:  Often a significant part of family and domestic violence, perpetrators use coercive control to keep power over another person. Yet, it is little understood.   You can read the draft national principles here. Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available at 1800Respect (1800 737 732).      12.45am   Inflation too high at the moment, RBA governor says  As the economics committee gets going this morning, RBA governor Philip Lowe kicks off by stating the good news since the last meeting back in February. That\u2019s mainly the drop in the jobless rate from 4.2% then to 3.5% as of last month. (See earlier post.)  The bad news, though, is that inflation has \u201cvery quickly\u201d gone from \u201ctoo low to too high\u201d. (Hence the rapid rise in interest rates at the fastest pace since 1994.) Lowe has repeated the bank\u2019s expectation that inflation (CPI) will peak at about 7.75% at the end of 2022, and ease to 3% by the end of 2024. As for the RBA\u2019s actions over the past couple of years, Lowe says the bigger policy mistake would have been to have too little than to do too much, Lowe says, of the support given during the \u201cvery scary\u201d period at the start of the Covid pandemic. Still, it\u2019s a \u201cdifficult and concerning time for many people\u201d with the rise in the RBA cash rate and consequent increased borrowing costs. Not to act to stem inflation, though, would have worse impacts, Lowe says.  Updated at 1.01am BST    12.32am    RBA to answer questions about interest rates The Reserve Bank is up before an economics committee in parliament this morning, and no doubt there\u2019ll be some discussion about interest rates. Ahead of the meeting, markets were tipping a two-in-three chance that the cash rate will be hiked another half percentage point to 2.85% at the RBA\u2019s next board meeting on 4 October.  Part of the nudge higher in interest rate expectations in the past few days was yesterday\u2019s ABS release on jobs data for August. Yes, the jobless rate ticked higher to 3.5%, the first rise since last October, but there was an increase in the participation rate (more people looking for work) and almost 60,000 full-time jobs added, as we reported here:  Governor Philip Lowe and fellow RBA representatives will also likely be asked this morning about its operations, and the review into operations that just began taking public submissions and is due to report to the government by March. We looked at some of the key themes here:  More to come as the hearing starts soon after 9.30am AEST.  Updated at 12.35am BST    12.26am   ACT border could be expanded, reports say  The Canberra Times is reporting that NSW premier Dominic Perrottet and ACT chief minister Andrew Barr are discussing ACT border expansion plans. Reporter Lucy Bladen writes:  The NSW premier has given the green light for negotiations to start between the ACT and NSW about expanding the border in Canberra\u2019s north. Chief minister Andrew Barr said he has been contacted directly by Dominic Perrottet who has indicated in-principle support for the expansion of the territory\u2019s borders. Officials from the NSW Department of Premier and Cabinet and the ACT\u2019s Chief Minister, Treasury and Economic Development Directorate have entered into discussions about the possible shift of the border.  Guardian Australia is looking into this development, so stay tuned.  Updated at 12.29am BST    12.13am    Ardern granted audience with King Charles The New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, will meet with King Charles III on Saturday afternoon local time (Sunday morning AEST), saying she intended to keep her comments straightforward, AAP reports. She said:  I\u2019ll simply share the sorrow that New Zealand has, and pass on our deepest condolences. At the end of the day, although this is a period of transition for him, he has also lost his beloved mother. For us and New Zealand that\u2019s first and foremost.  Speaking prior to her departure, Ardern said she would be \u201clooking for ways that we can maximise the time on behalf of New Zealand, whilst of course doing [our] primary job which is to pay our respects to the loss of our head of state\u201d.  I feel very humbled at the opportunity to be here on behalf of New Zealand, to be a part of what is a very sad but a very historic occasion here. I feel a great weight of responsibility.  Ardern said she would also meet with Britain\u2019s new prime minister Liz Truss, and Prince William \u2013 now the Prince of Wales \u2013 repaying his efforts in the wake of the 2019 Christchurch mosques terror attacks.  I remember so well after 15 March the effort he made, to come to New Zealand, to meet with us, to visit with those affected. The Prince of Wales has always been there for New Zealand in its time of grief.  Ardern will leave London on Monday night, travelling to the United Nations to represent New Zealand at the start of the 77th session of the general assembly.

Nine News is reporting that the man was hiking with his daughters, one of whom tried to climb down the cliff to rescue him. Queensland police say they are preparing a report for the coroner following the \u201cnon-suspicious sudden death\u201d yesterday afternoon.  Emergency services were initially called to Tanninaba Falls around 12.15pm following reports a man falling several metres down a cliff face. Crews located the man at the bottom of the cliff and was declared deceased a short time later.    Updated at 12.15am BST    11.44pm    UK interviewer asks Albanese about what Morrison secret ministries saga means for republic debate UK\u2019s ITV News also asked Albanese to weigh in on the Scott Morrison secret ministries saga in light of the republic debate. Rivers:  I just wanted to ask a question about Scott Morrison\u2019s swearing in for a number of ministries and the fact that the governor general at the time didn\u2019t sort of block this or make this public. Does that sort of inform the debate about the system that you\u2019ve got that shows that there is a flaw there?  Albanese:  Well, the governor general, of course, takes advice from the elected government of the day. And that is what His Excellency the governor general did on this occasion. I\u2019ve been very critical of the actions of the former prime minister, and not just swearing himself into multiple portfolios, including treasury, finance, resources, energy, health, for reasons that are, frankly, beyond my comprehension. The fact that he did not make that public and indeed didn\u2019t inform the heads of department in some cases, and indeed, his ministerial colleagues, that that had occurred, let alone the Australian public. I find this quite extraordinary. But I believe that is the responsibility of former prime minister Morrison and he needs to explain the circumstances in which that occurred. And we need to if there are any legislative changes required to ensure that can never happen again, then we will implement them after the review that is taking place, presided over by a former high court justice, who will report to me before the end of the year in time for any legislative changes to occur in the last sitting work of parliament.  Rivers:  Was it not incumbent on the governor general to speak up at that point?  Albanese:  Well, the governor general should take advice from the elected government of the day. The governor general did that on this occasion. It\u2019s also the case that the governor general may have made inquiries of the prime minister of the day, those discussions, private discussions and we don\u2019t know, at this point in time, what those discussions entailed.   Updated at 11.50pm BST    11.29pm   \u2018You can have different views but be united in respect\u2019: PM ahead of flying to London  The prime minister Anthony Albanese gave an interview to the UK\u2019s ITV News, before leaving for London to attend the Queen\u2019s funeral. Albanese said he had \u201ca sense of history, the sense of great privilege that I have in along with the governor general, and our acting high commissioner to London, representing Australians at the Queen\u2019s service on Monday.\u201d ITV News\u2019 Dan Rivers asked Albanese about \u201chaving to walk a bit of a tightrope between your own personal views on a republic for Australia and the wider occasion that\u2019s happening this week.\u201d  My job as prime minister of Australia is to represent Australia at this historic time. And I believe you can have different views as Australians do. A range of views over our constitutional system, but be united in respect for the life and service that Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth showed to Australia, to the Commonwealth and, indeed, to the world.  Asked about whether it\u2019s inevitable that Australia will become a republic, Albanese responded,  Well, that\u2019s a discussion for another time and as, indeed, Her Majesty said during her reign at the time of the referendum that Australia had at the end of the last century that the royal family would respect the decisions which Australians made at that time. So, I think that\u2019s a debate for another time. And that\u2019s a debate for Australians to have.    Updated at 12.30am BST    11.14pm   Spike in Australian drownings linked to Covid  The number of drowning deaths in Australia has reached its highest point in 25 years, according to figures released today by the Royal Life Saving Society and Surf Life Saving Australia (SLSA). Covid-19 has been blamed for helping to push up the tally as beachgoers are urged to know their limits, AAP reports. There were 339 drownings nationwide in the 12 months to 30 June, up from 295 the previous year and the highest reported tally since 1996. More than a third occurred in coastal locations. The increase in drownings to its highest point since 1996 has been linked to the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, such as travel bans, although the annual tally also includes 39 flood-related deaths. Almost half of coastal fatalities happened more than 5km from a surf lifesaving service as Australians sought out secluded and unfamiliar beaches. SLSA chief executive Adam Weir said:  With many of these tragedies unfolding at remote and isolated locations, SLSA is appealing for the public to consider where they are recreating and understand their limitations.  Royal Life Saving Society Australia chief executive Justin Scarr said:  Increased drowning deaths in school-aged children is tragic and may be a sign of generational impacts of lessons missed due to Covid\u201019. Swimming and water safety lessons are critical to child safety.  The report predicted the temporary closure of pools and swim schools during the pandemic could impact Australians for years to come, with the industry struggling to recruit instructors and lifeguards.  Updated at 12.30am BST    10.59pm   \u2018We have to deal with\u2019 growing relationship between Russia and China: Marles  The acting prime minister, Richard Marles, is asked about the comments that have come from Andrew Hastie, the shadow defence minister, who described President Xi and Putin\u2019s meeting in Uzbekistan as a \u201cmonster relationship\u201d. Q: Is that a description you\u2019d endorse? Marles:  It\u2019s not the language I would use, but we are seeing greater engagement between China and Russia. We saw that in the meeting that occurred after the Winter Olympics. We\u2019re seeing joint exercises undertaken by China and Russia in the North Pacific. This is a relationship which is growing and obviously it\u2019s something that effects the strategic circumstances that we have to deal with and the complexity of those circumstances. The world in which we are living is now a world in which the global rules-based order, which has been the basis of peace and prosperity, is being put under great strain and we\u2019re seeing that in eastern Europe with Russia\u2019s appalling invasion of Ukraine. But we\u2019re seeing it in the Indo-Pacific as well. And rules around freedom of navigation in places like the South China Sea, that\u2019s fundamentally important to Australia\u2019s national interest. All of this is what we have to be dealing with.   Updated at 12.32am BST    10.51pm    Marles says it would be beneficial to operate submarines \u2018operated elsewhere as well\u2019 Q: Is the preferred option\u2026 a new design of boat able to be used by all three partner nations? Marles says he\u2019s \u201cnot in a position to go into that detail\u201d but what he can say is that:  This is very much a collaborative trilateral process. You know, the UK and the US are working together with us to see Australia acquire this capability and it is very much a partnership between all three countries. And it\u2019s very important that as we go forward the submarine capability that we have is one which is being operated by at least one other country so that we have a shared sustainment base and we have a shared experience of that platform.  Marles is asked if he meant submarines currently operated by one other country, the ABC asks \u201cbecause there are these suggestions that all three nations might partner around the future version of the next fleet of nuclear submarines, SSNX in the United States\u201d. Marles responds to whether that is being entertained:  Well, you know, both the UK and the US are going through an evolution in respect of their own submarine capabilities and that forms part of the landscape, against which this process is happening and these decisions are being made. All I would say at the moment is that as I said there is very much a collaborative effort, all three countries are working on this and we are starting to see where this is going and in thinking about what is the best option for Australia, we are very mindful that it would be advantageous to be operating a submarine which has been operated elsewhere as well.   Updated at 10.54pm BST    10.43pm    Former government\u2019s submarine bungle part of wasted decade, Marles says It\u2019s been a year since Australia pulled the plug on its submarine contract with France and announced a three-way deal with the US and the UK, but there are still questions over Australia\u2019s nuclear submarine future fleet. Richard Marles, the defence minister and acting prime minister (as Albanese is in London for the Queen\u2019s funeral), just spoke to ABC Breakfast News from Geelong. Marles was asked about whether reporting from ABC\u2019s Laura Tingle of 7.30 that defence officials were kept in the dark about the switch from French to Aukus submarines surprised him:  Well, there was a lot about what occurred a year ago that surprised us at the time and, you know, the way in which we saw the former government enter into the arrangement with France and then the terms on which they \u2013 they exited that arrangement. I mean, all of that really spoke to a wasted decade, actually, in terms of being in and out of various arrangements at a time when we really needed to be focusing on what the future capability would be when the Collins Class came to the end of its life and there were lots of very significant questions, I think about the process that occurred in the lead-up to last year, but obviously where we\u2019re at now is we\u2019re a year into the Aukus arrangements and we\u2019re focused on moving forward and acquiring for Australia the next generation of submarine capability that the nation needs.    Updated at 10.52pm BST    10.34pm   \u2018Measured discussion\u2019 will take us in direction of a republic: Gillard  Former prime minister Julia Gillard spoke to the ABC\u2019s James Glenday, sharing her thoughts about the political ripples of the Queen\u2019s death.  I always thought that when the Queen did leave us, that it would cause a period of reflection. I thought that here in the UK and there are many issues about national identity that the UK is grappling with \u2013 the future of Scotland, the future of Northern Ireland, what it means to be the nation in the world without the contact with the European Union that they had, the post-Brexit world in which they now live. And I always thought in Australia too it would unleash a new set of reflections about our own constitutional arrangements. But there\u2019s no rush and I certainly endorse what the prime minister has said. There\u2019s time for measured discussion. It\u2019s certainly too soon for that now. The things that people want to do to honour the Queen, the prime minister, our prime minister, being at the funeral on Monday. All of those things need to be worked through. And then I think we can have a measured, steady discussion, which will ultimately take us, I think, in the direction of a republic. But it won\u2019t be quick.  Gillard also shared her personal memories of the Queen:  I do remember in terms of her stoicism, we were there backstage at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting opening and what was happening at the opening towards the end of was that each leader of the 54 countries was going to come out on stage, be announced, be applauded and then I would come out second last and she would come out last. So we were in this big queue waiting to go on stage, moving very slowly. So I said to her, \u201cCan I get someone to get you a chair?\u201d And she was like, \u201cNo, I\u2019m fine to stand.\u201d And I\u2019m like, that\u2019s really a pity because if someone had got you a chair, someone might have brought me a chair.   Updated at 12.31am BST    10.32pm   Good morning  The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is flying to London where he will express Australia\u2019s condolences after the death of Queen Elizabeth II. He left Australia on Thursday night alongside the governor general, David Hurley, and a delegation of 10 Australian representatives. Albanese is expected to view the Queen\u2019s lying in state at Westminster Hall, and meet with the British prime minister, Liz Truss, while in London. In her first interview since the Queen\u2019s death, former prime minister Julia Gillard has weighed in on the republic debate. Gillard told BBC Radio:  I\u2019ve always thought inevitably when the reign of Queen Elizabeth came to the end that people would reflect, but people will do that in a very measured and unhurried way.  Mourning is also occurring in the tennis community, as six-time Australian Open champion Roger Federer has called time on one of the sport\u2019s greatest careers. Australian great Rod Laver has been amongst those paying tribute to the man many said was the Mikhail Baryshnikov of tennis.  Let\u2019s get going!  Updated at 10.33pm BST "

                    "body": "A 54-year-old performed a dad dance in the Royal Box at Wembley and whipped half of the stadium into a frenzy by hoisting the League Cup aloft not once but three times. J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s appetite for the competition, and for winning, should not be questioned again. As is the case after any big club claim the first trophy of the season, the question turned quickly from Liverpool\u2019s Carabao Cup success to its potential impact on other prizes that glitter on the horizon. Klopp\u2019s players have been unequivocal with their answers. On social media Mohamed Salah posted: \u201cOne down \u2026\u201d Trent Alexander-Arnold, who stated recently that one trophy a season should be the minimum expectation on a squad of Liverpool\u2019s talent, had much the same outlook, writing: \u201c1/4. Hungry for more.\u201d  Managers are often wary of hubris, Klopp included, but he said after the penalty shootout defeat of Chelsea that, with luck and continued hard work, Liverpool\u2019s record ninth League Cup triumph could be \u201cthe start\u201d for a season that retains possibilities in the Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup. On current form, Manchester City\u2019s six-point lead in the title race will not look insurmountable to a Liverpool team with a game in hand and a trip to the Etihad Stadium, to come in April. They also hold a 2-0 lead over Internazionale in the last 16 of the Champions League and host the Premier League\u2019s bottom club, Norwich, in the FA Cup fifth round on Wednesday. There will be a craving for another Wembley experience following a first domestic cup victory for a decade.  Klopp\u2019s options are plentiful should he opt for fresh legs in the FA Cup and to rest others ahead of West Ham\u2019s visit in the Premier League on Saturday. Caoimh\u00edn Kelleher could start again and feel Anfield\u2019s acclaim following his decisive contribution against Chelsea. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Takumi Minamino and Kostas Tsimikas did not make it off the bench in the final while Curtis Jones, impressive in the 6-0 rout of Leeds four days previously, did not make the matchday squad. The Liverpool manager attributed early League Cup exits in previous seasons to having to \u201cjust collect the bones and use the last of the few guys we have\u201d following consultations with the club\u2019s medical department. Now, with greater resources, he collects the trophy. Klopp was euphoric in his celebrations at Wembley and meticulous in his preparations. A goalless yet gripping final was decided by the finest of margins and, once again, the Liverpool manager\u2019s openness to fresh ideas and willingness to embrace specialists paid dividends. During an extended pre-season last summer Klopp invited a German neuroscience company called neuro11 to work with his players on their mental strength. Their studies concern \u201caccuracy training\u201d, which helps players to focus on delivering set pieces. Liverpool have scored the most set-piece goals in both the Premier League and Champions League this season and were flawless with 11 penalties in the shootout victory against Chelsea, their second\u2011choice goalkeeper included.  Dr Niklas H\u00e4usler and Patrick Hantschke, the founders of neuro11, spent last week at Liverpool\u2019s training centre working with Klopp\u2019s players again. The Liverpool manager credited the pair, who were present at Wembley, in an interview with the club\u2019s TV channel after the Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga had failed spectacularly to unnerve any of his penalty takers.  \u201cSomehow I had a feeling we deserved it, Caoimh\u00edn especially deserved it, and you have to say that we have neuro11,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cWe worked with them. In the pre\u2011season, you should have seen the boys in the training camp. \u201cThey were training set pieces with the boys in the last few weeks and each player went through a proper drill, psychological, to do with penalties, corners and free\u2011kicks. But penalties as well. So we had a list for the boys. First five and then six, seven, eight. But some of the players were not on the field any more. From eight onwards they were not even close on any list, so it was really exciting. Compliments to the boys, compliments to neuro11, they did an incredible job with the boys. I am really happy we could win it like this.\u201d The penalty shootout victory on Sunday was more by design than chance. Klopp\u2019s relentless pursuit of improvement and success sets an example that runs throughout Liverpool."

The Liverpool manager was caught out by a question on his future before Wednesday\u2019s FA Cup win over Norwich and said he did not know whether to extend a contract that has just over two years remaining.  On Friday the 54-year-old reiterated it was still his intention to stay until 2024 \u2013 when he will have been in charge for almost nine years, the longest stint of his managerial career \u2013 and said a decision on whether to extend his deal could be taken at the \u201clast minute\u201d. Klopp, asked what would persuade him to stay or walk away in two years\u2019 time, replied: \u201cIf I have the energy levels for it. That is important. I love what I do but I\u2019ve said a couple of times there must be something else out there in the world, to be honest, apart from always thinking about properly skilled, good-looking, fantastically nice football players. \u201cBut I really don\u2019t think about it. At the moment I am full of energy but we have to \u2013 I have to \u2013 make sure that is the case because I don\u2019t want to sit around and be more tired than others and think: \u2018Wow, why is everyone bothered about the things out there because I couldn\u2019t care less?\u2019\u201d Liverpool remain in the hunt for an unprecedented quadruple and Klopp maintains the long-term health of the club \u2013 with young players coming through and several redevelopment plans delivered \u2013 is more important than his personal plan.  \u201cMy future will be OK,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have to plan. I could book [extend his contract] last minute \u2013 let\u2019s put it like this. It is not a problem. No, the plan is the future of the club that we are constantly working on, that everything is in place and the things we do are not for me, not for us, not for this generation, they are for a long, long time. \u201cSo many things we\u2019ve tried to improve over the years. It\u2019s about just doing the right things, employing the right people, putting them in the right positions. It doesn\u2019t mean you win the title, it just means you have the right people for the right job, so use them \u2013 and that\u2019s what we try. These people \u2013 a lot of them are here at the moment \u2013 will be good and it will be fine whenever it will be after I leave. The plan at the moment is to do 2024, thank you very much.\u201d"

We reached the semi-final of the Carabao Cup and in this moment I think it is a good result for Tottenham, and this has to push us, to try to become more competitive and lift a trophy as soon as possible.\u201d  Tottenham have won two of their past three away games, against Manchester City and Leeds. The latter was a fifth defeat in six for the home side, leading to Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s departure from Elland Road. \u201cI\u2019m really disappointed, because we\u2019re talking about an important manager and we\u2019re talking about a person who is a master, for many managers, many coaches, in the past and in the present,\u201d Conte said of the Argentinian. \u201cHe is not only a manager with a great vision of football, who taught a lot to other people, but at the same time I have great respect for him as a person, as a man, because in every situation he\u2019s showed great integrity and in football you cannot always find this type of person.\u201d"

As reported in the Guardian on Friday, the competition will have an almost tenfold rise on the \u00a3428,915 fund available to the 417 teams competing this season.  \u201cA disproportionate amount of this new fund will be invested into the early rounds of the competition,\u201d the Football Association said. \u201cThis will ensure those clubs further down the pyramid really feel the benefit.\u201d The FA Board signed off on the increase last Thursday and it will now begin discussions on how the money is allocated. The Guardian understands this is new money and is not being taken from the men\u2019s prize fund or another area of women\u2019s football. \u201cWomen\u2019s football continues to be in a growth phase and we are always looking to make improvements and investment to drive it forward,\u201d said the FA\u2019s director of women\u2019s football, Sue Campbell. \u201cThis is certainly one of the most pleasing days during my time with the organisation, because I know it means so much to so many.\u201d Many teams lower down the pyramid have highlighted the difficulty of taking part in the competition with prize money not covering costs. Clapton Community FC launched a crowdfunding campaign to cover their away trips on a run to the third round this season, while Lewes FC wrote to the FA in February 2019 demanding action. Last season, Chelsea collected \u00a325,000 for their win over Arsenal in December\u2019s delayed final, 1.4% of the \u00a31.8m handed to the men\u2019s winners, Leicester.

                    "body": "Graeme Craig is poring over plans for one of London\u2019s biggest new housing developments. The models show a mix of low and high rise buildings, 4,500 homes, alongside cultural venues and parks, which will rise from the rubble of the now demolished Earls Court exhibition centre.  Craig runs Transport for London\u2019s property arm \u2013 he was appointed its first commercial director more than a decade ago. TfL\u2019s day job is running the capital\u2019s bus and underground network, but it has held on to its land, and 22 years after its creation it remains the third biggest landowner in the capital, after the emirate of Qatar and the mayor of London. It could soon be one of its biggest housing developers too. Over the next decade, Craig has drawn up plans to build more than 20,000 homes, with 1,650 already under construction. \u201cWe hope to be building homes for decades to come,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d be surprised and disappointed if we weren\u2019t the most impactful developer [in the capital].\u201d The largest development is Earl\u2019s Court, where construction is expected to start in 2025 and take 15 years, with plans to create up to 15,000 jobs. The vision of the Earls Court Development Company, set up by TfL and Delancey, is \u201cto bring the wonder back\u201d to a once iconic music and events venue. But it is a vision that has been delayed and revised, and details are scarce at this stage. The developers went back to the drawing board, and Delancey replaced TfL\u2019s original partner Capital &amp; Counties Properties, after protests over plans to demolish two council estates, which have since been handed back to Hammersmith and Fulham council. The new masterplan is expected to be submitted by October 2023. TfL\u2019s property arm owns 2,226 hectares (5,500 acres) of land across London, 1.5% of the area of London. The portfolio is valued at \u00a31.7bn and comprises the land around stations and 800 railway arches. Rather than selling off its lucrative assets, TfL set up a separate property department in 2012 to develop the land and manage the properties. Nearly two-fifths of the current portfolio is shop space, but TfL wants to become a bigger player in offices and housing. \u201cHybrid working is here to stay. The firms with offices in place in central London are going to work harder,\u201d says Craig. \u201cPeople will not just come in to send emails. You want it to be somewhere people want to come in to work,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re not thinking about desks in rows where people are staring at screens \u2013 people can do that at home; offices are there for things you can\u2019t do at home.\u201d Younger people will have to be coaxed back to the office, he says, and offices will need to have pleasant, open, flexible meeting spaces and other attractions \u2013 although TfL\u2019s won\u2019t feature swimming pools and basketball courts, like the new Google headquarters at King\u2019s Cross. \u201cIt\u2019s possible to have fun at work without playing basketball,\u201d Craig says. The property arm is wholly owned by TfL, which collects all its profits, but otherwise separately run. Other projects include three big office developments that have planning permission at Paddington, Southwark and Bank stations, and it is constructing a series of apartment blocks across London in partnership with build-to-rent specialist Grainger and others. It recently secured \u00a3200m from three banks which will give it enough funding for the next three years. TfL hasn\u2019t held on to all its sites. It was criticised for selling off the \u201cfamily silver\u201d \u2013 its former Grade I-listed headquarters at 55 Broadway overlooking St James\u2019s Park \u2013 to a hotels entrepreneur for \u00a3120m in 2019. It also sold land above Crossrail stations, which has generated \u00a3300m so far and is expected to bring in \u00a3500m in total. But Craig insists that TfL will only sell assets that do not fit with the portfolio. Half of the 20,000 homes planned will be classified as affordable \u2013 a higher proportion than many other developers achieve. A big chunk \u2013 about a third of the housing \u2013 will be for rent. With other partners, TfL is also building 479 rental homes and commercial space above and around the new Northern line station in Nine Elms, south of the river, as well as 619 homes across eight buildings in Kidbrooke in Greenwich, 50% of which will be affordable \u2013 a mixture of shared ownership and London living rent. Unlike Network Rail, which sold off thousands of railway arches for \u00a31.5bn to the private equity group Blackstone in 2018 \u2013 a controversial deal that pushed up rents for many small businesses and forced some out \u2013 TfL has held on to its 800 railway arches. \u201cIn the arches we\u2019re seeing increasingly a focus on things that are experiences \u2013 whether that\u2019s great food or other experiences, something that\u2019s different from being sat at home on the internet,\u201d says Craig. \u201cThere is going to be more fluency between work, home and leisure. \u201cWe are predominantly an SME landlord,\u201d Craig adds. The vast majority of TfL\u2019s 1,500 tenants (93%) are small and medium sized shops and other businesses in the tube stations and arches. TfL tenants The distillerCarmen O\u2019Neal, the 36-year-old founder of the Hackney gin distillery 58 and Co in east London, one of the UK\u2019s first female-run distilleries, which opened in July 2019, says: \u201cI built a distillery on my mat[ernity] leave. I found the arch when I was pregnant and wanted it so badly.\u201d  TfL was supportive through the pandemic and charged the company no rent while it had to shut in line with lockdown rules and lost 95% of its business. During that period, she stopped making gin and switched to producing hand sanitiser instead for the NHS and the Met police. The solar panel-powered distillery reopened last July and runs gin-making classes at the front of the arch, while it produces, bottles and labels gin at the back. O\u2019Neal, from Canada, says unlike other landlords she had in the past who were \u201cuncontactable, I\u2019ve never felt that way with TfL\u201d. The car workshop  Jack\u2019s Garage in Ladbroke Grove in west London, owned and run by Joseph Salama, occupies three railway arches owned by TfL. The business, founded in 1995, is a VW specialist workshop and has moved into conversions of cars to battery operated electric vehicles, which cost from \u00a330,000 to more than \u00a3100,000 depending on the vehicle generation and equipment installed. Salama says TfL came to the company\u2019s rescue after the nearby Grenfell Tower fire in 2017, when the roads were closed for several weeks and it could not receive deliveries of car parts. TfL granted the garage a six-month grace period and also handed over two arches for an extended period to a local grassroots charity helping the survivors. During the Covid pandemic, TfL granted all tenants in the area a three-month rent-free period and another three months at half the usual rent. \u201cThey\u2019ve really helped the local community,\u201d he says. \u2022 This article was amended on 18 August 2022. An earlier version referred to London\u2019s 58 and Co, which opened in 2019, as the UK\u2019s first female-run distillery. That should have said one of the first; Salford\u2019s Four Sisters was founded in 2017."

                    "body": "It would be unwise to place blind faith in the comments of a judge during a commercial dispute. In the case of LIV Golf and associated chaos, a sporting resolution chamber in the UK placed a stay on suspensions of DP World, formerly European, Tour golfers long before this week\u2019s dramatic events in a courtroom in California. Interpretations of the law, however, are rarely an exact science. In contrast to the UK, Judge Beth Labson Freeman determined the PGA Tour was well within its rights to exclude Matt Jones, Talor Gooch and Hudson Swafford from a playoff berth they had earned via on-course pursuits because it was undermined by an off-course swag grab. \u201cIf LIV Golf is elite golf\u2019s future, what do the players care about the dust-collecting trophies of a bygone era?\u201d asked Freeman in her written reasoning. It felt a valid point.  In an open letter to Jay Monahan, the PGA Tour\u2019s commissioner, the LIV chief, Greg Norman, once stated: \u201cYou can\u2019t ban players from playing golf.\u201d Norman\u2019s sentiment was equally clear during correspondence with Sergio Garc\u00eda. \u201cThey cannot ban you for one day let alone life,\u201d said Norman. \u201cIt is a shallow threat.\u201d The entry list for this week\u2019s St Jude in Memphis says otherwise. \u201cI said to some of the guys personally, I think they\u2019ve been brainwashed by the way they feel so adamant that they\u2019re going to be back out on the PGA Tour,\u201d said Billy Horschel, the world No 15. In court, Judge Freeman had stated: \u201cThese LIV contracts lock up players up in a way the PGA Tour never imagined. They are so restrictive.\u201d So much for Norman\u2019s insistence of bringing \u201cfree agency\u201d. No sooner had the LIV trio been denied a tee time in Tennessee than Rory McIlroy touched on an intriguing aspect of the ongoing civil war. \u201cI certainly have a little more respect for the guys that haven\u2019t put their names to the lawsuit,\u201d said the Northern Irishman. The broader, antitrust case to which McIlroy referred involves Jones, Gooch and Swafford plus Phil Mickelson, Bryson DeChambeau, Ian Poulter, Peter Uilhein, Jason Kokrak, Pat Perez and Abraham Ancer. Carlos Ortiz\u2019s name was removed from the claim in recent days. The distinction \u2013 and it is necessary \u2013 between LIV golfers and their attitudes is an important one. That is absolutely the case in the minds of McIlroy and others, who do not take kindly to potential harm, monetary and reputational, being inflicted on the PGA Tour by a group who at least gave the impression of riding off into a superior world.  This week, Richard Bland \u2013 an early LIV convert \u2013 is competing in the $1.5m World Invitational at Galgorm Castle on the DP World Tour. Nothing stops Bland from doing this \u2013 just as Poulter or Henrik Stenson cannot be prevented from competing in the Czech Masters and PGA Championship at Wentworth - but it is a terrible look. And for what? Dust-collecting trophies? Maybe the Ryder Cup falls into that category. The main court battle between Mickelson et al and the PGA Tour is not likely to begin until next autumn which will rule DeChambeau, Dustin Johnson, Patrick Reed and Brooks Koepka out of the meeting with Europe in Rome barring exceptional performances in the majors to earn ranking points needed for qualification or unlikely captain\u2019s picks. Johnson, Reed and Koepka have been nowhere near litigation, which lends itself to the theory LIV, for them, really is only about money rather than a fresh professional domain. DeChambeau has made great play of being the best he can be yet here he is, all-but excluded from a team competition where legends are created. Garc\u00eda ruled out legal challenges the moment he joined LIV. The Spaniard awaits the exact lie of the land regarding European Ryder Cup qualification before resigning or retaining membership of the DP World Tour. Poulter is involved in litigation against tours on both sides of the Atlantic. Stenson threw his hands up and cried foul having been removed as Europe\u2019s Ryder Cup captain. Louis Oosthuizen, Martin Kaymer and a batch of others could have entered last month\u2019s Scottish Open after the stay against a ban was issued. Instead, they stayed well clear. Unlike Norman and Mickelson, Oosthuizen \u2013 who considered retirement before LIV came calling \u2013 appeared for the past champions\u2019 celebrations at the Open minus any fuss at all. Cameron Smith\u2019s glory at St Andrews means he can defect to LIV while safe in the knowledge of major exemptions for the foreseeable future. Smith\u2019s insistence this week that he will compete in this year\u2019s President\u2019s Cup was curious given he will be banned from that event, presided over by the PGA Tour, if he tees up in the LIV tournament in Boston early next month. Golf is presently the most volatile of all sports. Judge Freeman made plain golfers were handsomely rewarded for following the LIV path. A tacky, tawdry, non-competitive sportswashing scene is hardly appealing. It would be a mistake, however, to assume every golfer has adopted the same approach while entering it."

Until then, here were the major developments of the day:  In one of the final question time sittings of the year, the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has returned to culture wars of the past, questioning why Labor signed up to funding a climate fund when charity \u201cbegins at home\u201d. Several companies have vehemently denied claims aired by the independent MP Andrew Wilkie under parliamentary privilege today that they had been \u201clying for years about the quality of our coal\u201d and had been engaged in bribes. Wilkie made explosive claims that companies including Peabody energy, Glencore and Macquarie Bank have been involved in \u201clying for years about the quality of our coal\u201d. The independent MP for Mackellar, Sophie Scamps, supported Wilkie\u2019s call for a parliament inquiry into the allegations. Australia\u2019s top intelligence official, Andrew Shearer, has praised the US-led release of intelligence ahead of the Russian invasion of Ukraine as a \u201cmasterclass\u201d in how western governments can gain a strategic upper hand. And a group of primary school students have been taken to hospital on Sydney\u2019s north after reports of a chemical explosion. Children believed to be about 10 years old were treated at Manly West public school on Monday afternoon, with some transported to hospitals for further treatment.   Updated at 7.47am GMT    7.33am    Man charged in WA over stabbing murder of woman at Perth hotel Western Australian police have charged a man in relation to the murder of a woman at a Perth hotel. In a statement, police confirmed that homicide squad detectives charged a 42-year-old man in relation to the death of a 40-year-old woman in east Perth. Police were called to a hotel on Adelaide Terrace on Sunday morning where they located a woman with stab wounds. She was taken to hospital but later died. The man, who is known to the victim, was taken into custody at the time and has since been charged with murder. He was refused bail and is due to appear in Perth magistrates court on Tuesday.  Updated at 7.37am GMT    7.22am   China to take military action against Taiwan within two decades: Rudd  The former prime minister Kevin Rudd argues China remains on track to take military action against Taiwan within the next 10 to 20 years. Rudd is speaking at the Australian National University tonight. The former Labor leader is delivering the JG Crawford Oration titled \u201cThe Return of Ideological Man: China under Xi Jinping\u201d. According to speech notes distributed to media in advance, Rudd is set to welcome the Albanese government\u2019s attempt to \u201ctake down the temperature\u201d of the relationship between Australia and China. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, met with Xi on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Bali last week. But Rudd is set to declare that the challenges in the relationship remained \u201cformidable\u201d. Rudd will argue that China should use the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations on 3 December to remove trade sanctions against a range of Australian exporters and to release the Australian journalist Cheng Lei from detention. Rudd is set to warn that a possible war between the US and China over self-governed Taiwan would be the most costly since the second world war, and that the next five years would be crucial to shaping the future of the region. Rudd will observe that the meeting between the US president, Joe Biden, and Xi in Bali last week \u2013 the first in-person meeting since Biden assumed office \u2013 showed that Beijing and Washington appear to have taken their first tentative steps towards a form of \u201cmanaged strategic competition\u201d. But Rudd believes it would be foolish to conclude that Xi has shelved his aspiration to take Taiwan. According to Rudd\u2019s speech notes, Xi\u2019s language on Taiwan in the official readout from the Bali summit was \u201carguably more hardline than before\u201d. Rudd is expected to say it remains his conclusion that China \u201cstill remains on track to enhance its military preparedness, as well as its financial, economic and technological preparedness, to take action against Taiwan from sometime in the late 2020s or in 2030s \u2013 when Xi, of course, still aims to be in power\u201d. Rudd\u2019s speech notes that it is important to be clear-eyed about the distinction between stabilisation of relationships in the short to medium term, and medium to long term preparations for potential conflict. Rudd is set to argue that the only way to avoid conflict in the medium to long term is for there to be an effective deterrence strategy by the US, its allies and Taiwan \u2013 militarily, technologically, financially, economically and in foreign policy and political terms.  Updated at 7.43am GMT    7.15am    Take a look at our Afternoon Update newsletter, which has just gone live.      7.10am    Agencies \u2018unable to produce evidence\u2019 of compliance with encryption laws, report finds Law enforcement agencies were \u201cunable to produce evidence\u201d that they had considered intrusion to privacy and whether technical assistance requests would create \u201csystemic weaknesses\u201d, the commonwealth ombudsman has found in its first major check of compliance with controversial new encryption laws. The Telecommunications Interception and Access Act, passed in December, created a world-leading scheme for law enforcement agencies to request or require tech companies to help them break or circumvent users\u2019 end-to-end encryption. In a report tabled in parliament on Monday, the ombudsman reveals that none of the compulsory powers in part 15 of the Telco Act have been used \u2013 but the voluntary powers (technical assistance requests) have been used 18 times. One of these Tars was \u201cinvalidly authorised\u201d, it said, because there was \u201cno delegation instrument in place\u201d. Only three of nine authorised agencies have started using the powers (New South Wales police, Australian federal police and Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission). All three \u201cused industry assistance powers before they established comprehensive governance and compliance frameworks\u201d, the ombudsman said. \u201cIn our view, this created a risk (in some instances realised) of statutory non-compliance during these agencies\u2019 early use of the industry assistance powers.\u201d The ombudsman said Tars were requested where the request had the \u201cpotential to affect the privacy of numerous individuals who were not the target, or who were not of interest to the requesting interception agency\u201d - but agencies were \u201cunable to produce evidence\u201d they had considered this. Similarly, they weren\u2019t able to produce documents about consideration of whether the Tar would create a \u201csystemic weakness\u201d \u2013 a key safeguard in the bill.  Updated at 7.28am GMT    6.57am    Government looks to tighten buy-now-pay-later industry regulations The assistant treasurer and financial services minister, Stephen Jones, has appeared on ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing discussing reforms to the $16bn buy-now-pay-later industry. The federal government is edging towards a stronger set of laws governing the credit providers \u2013 who allow customers to repay for items of up to $2,000 with instalments. Jones said the government was \u201cvery sensitive\u201d to disincentivizing financial innovation by bringing in greater regulation.  The real moment of realisation for me was when I walked into my doctor\u2019s surgery and I saw on the counter a sign saying you can pay by Mastercard, pay by visa card or AfterPay. Now, two of those are regulated as a credit product and the third one isn\u2019t. Just because of the way the contracts are written from a consumer point of view, it\u2019s a credit product and we should be looking at it as such. Great innovation, but let\u2019s have a level playing field. Let\u2019s have appropriate regulation which frankly is appropriate to the risk.  Jones said there were three options up for consultation \u2013 due to close at the end of December. The status quo, a modified arrangement under the National Consumer Credit Act and to apply all the existing arrangements product.

Meanwhile further west, \u201cdry lightning\u201d is possible.      6.28am    \u2018Broken\u2019 Indigenous officer says only overhaul in QPS leadership can fix issues An Indigenous officer who resigned after 26 years in the Queensland police service after attempts to address racism in the organisation left him \u201cbroken\u201d, says \u201ctransformative and genuine reforms\u201d to the police can only be realised through an \u201coverhaul of [its] leadership\u201d. Richard Monaei said:  We have a leadership that perpetuates the system, and until such time as we get a diversity of perspectives and individuals and views and lenses of the people that sit in those decision making positions, we\u2019re not going to see genuine change. The leadership needs to be reflective of the diversity that we see in our community.  Monaei\u2019s resignation letter was read aloud at the inquiry into QPS responses to domestic and family violence last month. On Monday, he said he had little confidence in the report\u2019s calls for better engagement with First Nations people, given he had seen similar calls being used as \u201csmokescreens\u201d over his nearly three decades in the force:  In my experience, the organisation is tone deaf when it comes to genuine, authentic and purposeful engagement.   Updated at 6.33am GMT    6.20am    \u2018The women of Queensland deserve better\u2019 says legal boss after release of domestic violence report The head of Women\u2019s Legal Service Queensland, Nadia Bromley, says she hopes the \u201ctroubling but not surprising\u201d evidence of racism and sexism within the state\u2019s police force will \u201cshock\u201d the state into action. Bromley welcomed the fact that the 78 recommendations of the independent Commission of Inquiry into Queensland Police Service responses were \u201ctimebound\u201d with deadlines of up to 18 months meaning that, unlike previous inquiries, this would \u201creally allow the government to be held to account\u201d. \u201cThe women of Queensland deserve better and I hope that everyone who reads this report is is shocked into action, into believing the women and their stories,\u201d she said.  Because I suppose some people found it hard to believe that this was a reality, but we can now see, in black and white, that this is what is happening to women all around our state.  Bromley described the report\u2019s recommendation that all police stations designate a private, safe and secure area for all persons presenting for domestic and family violence matters as \u201cpositive but disturbing\u201d.  How have we come to a place where we need an independent commission to provide a safe space for people to make complaints in police stations?   Updated at 6.26am GMT    6.09am    More on Wilkie\u2019s claims of widespread fraud in coal export industry Independent MP Andrew Wilkie has appeared on ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing after using parliamentary privilege today to make allegations of widespread fraudulent behaviour in the coal industry. Wilkie claimed whistleblowers provided him thousands of documents revealing companies were falsely claiming Australian coal was cleaner than it was to boost profits. Wilkie:  I wish I didn\u2019t have to go into the parliament and to ventilate these sorts of issues. I would have hoped that our regulators and other agencies could be trusted to look into these sorts of allegations. Regrettably, though, this particular whistleblower has been trying to bring these agencies to the table for literally years \u2026 I\u2019m now calling on the federal government to have some sort of effective inquiry into the allegations which, in essence, are that Australian coal exporters are using fraudulent quality control reports to sell their product.   Updated at 6.36am GMT    6.00am    Telstra to reduce retention time of customer ID data In the wake of the Optus and Medibank data breaches, Telstra has announced it will reduce the time it holds scans of people\u2019s IDs from two years to six months. In a blog post on Monday, the Telstra CEO, Vicki Brady, said the recent cyber breaches had been \u201ca wakeup call for everyone\u201d and the company had been examining what data it collects and stores - with a focus on the standard 100-point ID check when people sign up for accounts. The federal government is looking to change laws around what data is held and for how long, but Brady said Telstra was looking at what it could do in the meantime, and has reduced the amount of time ID scans are held by Telstra from two years to six months. Brady said:  As I\u2019ve said previously, there\u2019s a fine balance between retaining this data to help combat crime and protecting our customers\u2019 privacy. But it\u2019s a balance I think can be achieved.One of the lessons from the recent data breaches, for all organisations, was the need to continually assess what data needs to be stored, and how and where it is stored. We\u2019ve kicked off a review of our systems to really challenge ourselves to minimise the government ID data we hold, and the time we hold it for, while continuing to meet our existing legal obligations.  The ID numbers will still be retained for longer, as law requires, Brady said, but said Telstra would continue to advocate for changes to ID checks and how that data is managed.

The NSW SES has received more than 270 storm related requests for assistance in Sydney in the 24 hours to 3pm, with at least 150 requests involving trees being blown over due to high winds and the rest roof damage. Meanwhile, Victoria has been lashed with winds of up to 100 km/h, including at Essendon Airport in Melbourne.       5.41am    \u2018I am deeply sorry\u2019 says QPS boss after release of domestic violence report The Queensland police commissioner, Katarina Carroll, has issued a statement following today\u2019s release of the Commission of Inquiry report into police culture and handling of domestic violence incidents. She says the report is a \u201cvery difficult read\u201d and presents \u201cmany examples\u201d of where the force should have done better.  I acknowledge these issues and how they have affected the way we interact with the most vulnerable people in our community. For those who have experienced this, I am deeply sorry.There have been some examples of racism, misogyny and sexist behaviour which is not acceptable in our community \u2013 and even less acceptable from our police. Our police are our community, but we will rightly be held to a higher standard.

The acting electoral commissioner, Dana Fleming, says under the state\u2019s laws, if a candidate dies before 6pm on election day, which is Saturday 26 November, the election for that district is declared \u201cfailed\u201d and the nomination deposits are returned to all candidates in the district. She said people in the electorate will still be required to vote for their upper house candidates or face a $92 fine:  Votes received to date for Narracan district will be set aside and from this point on only Upper House ballot papers for Eastern Victoria Region will be taken and counted. A writ will be issued for a \u2018supplementary election\u2019 for Narracan district, using the electoral roll prepared for the original election. The VEC will seek a timeline for the supplementary election and communicate this as it is known.  Narracan, which begins outside Melbourne\u2019s eastern fringe and finishes before the Latrobe Valley, is one of the Coalition\u2019s safest seats and was held by the retiring Liberal, Gary Blackwood, on a 10% margin. Gilchrist was expected before court on 30 November charged with one count of rape and three counts of sexual assault ahead of a trial that had been scheduled for next year but his body was discovered at Rawson, in the state\u2019s east, on Sunday.  Updated at 5.51am GMT    5.21am    The lower house has passed legislation needed to implement Australia\u2019s trade agreements with the UK and India.  The bills passed the House of Representatives this afternoon and will head to the Senate next - likely from tomorrow.  Both agreements were negotiated under the Coalition so this legislation is not expected to face any holdup in the upper house.     5.11am    Industry leader raises concerns over industrial relations bill Andrew McKellar, CEO of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, is appearing on ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing, raising concerns regarding the Labor party\u2019s industrial relations bill. The body is already running paid advertisements mobilising public opinion \u2013 and possibly trying to sway cross-benchers \u2013 against the bill, which McKellar says is \u201cnot fit to pass\u201d in its current form.  I think the important message here is that you have all of the chambers of commerce and industry around Australia acting in a unified way, coming together to reflect the concerns that businesses are saying they have about this legislation. If the bill is to go forward as it stands really our concern is it\u2019s not fit to pass \u2026 if we rush into this, there\u2019s no way back.  McKellar says his greatest concern with the bill is its capacity for multi-employer bargaining.  Whether it\u2019s an engineering firm, whether it\u2019s the small business, a retail outlet \u2026 we\u2019re finding many examples of businesses that are saying \u2026 that they can potentially get roped in to agreements that they don\u2019t necessarily want to be part of which they can\u2019t necessarily afford.    Updated at 5.24am GMT    5.02am    Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie is paying tribute to the late Peter Reith on behalf of the party. She describes Reith as a \u201cgreat Victorian,\u201d known as the \u201chard-man\u201d during the Howard government, not just in his work in the industrial relations space.  He was elected to the seat of Flinders in 1982. He served in parliament for more than 17 years. His loyalty and dedication are well renowned within the Coalition and even more renowned was his wicked sense of humour.     Updated at 5.07am GMT    4.53am    Many thanks to the lovely Amy Remeikis for kicking off the working week. I\u2019ll be with you for the rest of the afternoon.     4.49am    The parliament is still ticking over and negotiations are ongoing for some of the government\u2019s big bills. Caitlin Cassidy will take you through the rest of the afternoon, but I will be back bright and early tomorrow morning as this parliamentary year draws to a close. Thank you so much for your company, and please \u2013 take care of you.  Updated at 4.58am GMT    4.47am    The Senate is now holding its condolence motion for Peter Reith.  Updated at 4.55am GMT    4.45am    Greens provide statement on shooting at gay nightclub in Colorado  Greens MP Stephen Bates who is also the party\u2019s LGBTQIA+ spokesperson has released a statement on the shooting at Q Nightclub in Colorado Springs:  My heart goes out to the families of victims of the horrific shooting that has occurred at Q Nightclub in Colorado Springs. Events like this serve as a reminder to queer people that we are never truly safe from hatred and discrimination. We are lucky to live in a country where guns are not readily available to far-right extremists. But queer and gender diverse people face the risk of persecution and violence every single day. The words of politicians and extremists have real world consequences. We must actively ensure we advocate for the rights and equality of all LGBTQIA+ people, at all times, to combat the hate that makes events like this possible. It breaks my heart to know that people who thought they were in a safe space were confronted with such violent hatred. I admire the bravery of those who put their own safety at risk to subdue the perpetrator.\u201d   Updated at 4.56am GMT    4.21am    Question time ends With another dixer from Mark Butler, question time comes to a close. Paul Fletcher wants Milton Dick to explain the practice that allowed him to split up David Coleman\u2019s question? Dick says that practice says that the majority of the question needs to be relevant to the minister (I am paraphrasing) and that in his opinion, the Coleman question was straight down the middle. I know you were all dying to ask that yourself, so there you go.  Updated at 4.26am GMT    4.17am    Monique Ryan has another of the crossbench questions. Dr Ryan is also one of the only people in the chamber wearing a mask\u201d  Some 31,000 people sought asylum in this country by sea between August 2012 and January 2014. Prior to the recent election, the ALP promised to provide permanent protection for those people, who have been stranded on temporary visas for up to 10 years. It\u2019s six months today since the Albanese Government was elected. When we will see an end to these punitive TPVs and others?  Andrew Giles steps up:  Thank you very much, Speaker. I acknowledge your deep interest in this issue. Indeed, it\u2019s one of the reasons why you are the member for Kooyong in this place. I was asked a similar question by the member for Clark in the last sitting week, or fairly recently. I want to say that the issues that she raises are very important to this government in and of themselves. They are important, in and of themselves, but they are also important because they go to this government\u2019s character. We are a government that keeps our promise in every respect. (The opposition begins to heckle and Milton Dick tells them to hush) \u2026Thanks, Speaker. And, look, members opposite seem to find this something that\u2019s worthy of shouting. I think they should listen carefully. They should recognise... Yeah, keeping promises. We saw nine years, nine years of broken promises, cuts, causing neglect in this space. Nine long years. This government is determined to keep our promises, and this is an important promise. It\u2019s to a group of people who arrived here before Operation Sovereign Borders, a group of people who have been in the community for a decade, paying taxes, making a contribution. We recognise this and we are working through this issue, which has many complexities. I have been meeting with lawyers, I\u2019ve met with the member for Kooyong. I believe we\u2019re meeting again on Wednesday, I think, this week with other members of the crossbench to work through all of these issues, to make sure that we meet this commitment in a way that is consistent across the cohort, that is effective, and is enduring, which recognises everything that they have been through as people who have been trapped in limbo and denied so many opportunities through that time. We are doing so also in a manner that recognises the wider circumstances, that recognises that the prime minister has said so often, correctly, that what Australians want - indeed, what Australia needs in this place - are policies which secure our border but do not abandon our humanity. That is the watch word with which this government approaches these issues, in a consistent and considered and consultative manner. And in that regard, I was very pleased to announce - I was pleased to announce, only a few days ago, that the government has made changes to the travel arrangements affecting people on TPVs and others, and reflects that these people have been separated from families for more than a decade. We will be compassionate without abandoning our resolve to maintain the security of our borders. We\u2019ve also flagged important changes that have been made to family reunion - again, an issue affecting people who have been here for a long time - which goes directly to those two principles. Securing our borders, including by securing safer passage to people who need our protection. That is the way that we are approaching these issues, not treating vulnerable human beings as political footballs, as those opposite did for too long.   Updated at 4.21am GMT    4.04am    More on chemical explosion at Sydney primary school Breaking into question time to update you on the Manly West public school situation: Eleven students and one teacher are in a stable condition after a science experiment caused a chemical explosion at a school on Sydney\u2019s north. New South Wales Ambulances have confirmed two students have suffered serious burns while nine students and one adult \u2013 believed to be a teacher \u2013 suffered superficial burns as a result of the explosion at Manly West public school on Monday afternoon. Children believed to be about 10-years-old. One of the students with serious burns was airlifted to Westmead children\u2019s hospital with serious burns, while the other student was taken to that hospital by ambulance. The nine other students were taken to the Royal North Shore and Northern Beaches hospitals. The adult was not hospitalised.  Updated at 4.10am GMT    4.03am    The Greens MP for Brisbane, Stephen Bates (still tieless) has a question for Anthony Albanese: The climate summit in Egypt reinforced the urgency of phasing out fossil fuels to avoid catastrophic breakdown. And Vanuatu says support for Australia hosting a future summit relies on no new coal and gas handouts. Why then does the government\u2019s first Budget continue to subsidise fossil fuels, including $1.9bn to open up a new LNG terminal and petrochemical hub in Darwin Harbour and support for a new gas project in Victoria? Albanese:  I thank the member for his question. He should visit Darwin and actually have a look at what it is. He should actually go and have a look at what it is and look at the facts rather than just the rhetoric. And the fact is that this parliament has adopted a reduction of 43% emissions by 2030. We have now legislated for net zero by 2050. And when I met with leaders at Apec and G20 and East Asia Summit, I did speak to them about Australia hosting a conference of the parties. Let me tell you, there\u2019s enormous support for it. There\u2019s enormous support for it because Australia is back in the game of dealing with the challenge of climate change. Including in our region with our Pacific neighbours. Our Pacific neighbours have met the minister for climate change and energy at the COP in Sharm el-Sheikh, and there was enormous support there from them, as there was from our European colleagues, who I discussed it with in the European Union, the prime minister of the United Kingdom, the president of the United States, and other leaders in our region, in Asean as well. The fact is, the fact is that we are dealing with a situation where, for nine years, we had no energy policy in this country, no climate policy in this country. Indeed, you don\u2019t have to rely upon just us. Peter Tomsett had some interesting comments last week, the chairman of Newcrest. This is what he said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t have policy for long enough, which has been our situation, you wind up with a situation where intervention is required. This need not have happened had the right energy policy been put in place. What we\u2019re seeing is a symptom. We had every form of energy known to humankind in spades and we haven\u2019t been able to harness that in a coherent policy that encourages the right investments to also meet our greenhouse gas commitments as a country.\u201d And what we are doing, what we are doing, is putting in place policies that encourage investment in new energy, and the cheapest form of new energy is, of course, renewables. But we saw under the previous government four gigawatts leave the system and only one gigawatt enter the system. No wonder there is a problem. As Richard Court, a former WA Liberal premier, described it: \u201cThe past decade of energy policy has been a slow-moving train wreck.\u201d While this government is getting on, getting on with the policy that\u2019s required, I believe very clearly we have an opportunity to be a renewable energy superpower for the world, to create jobs, to create economic growth, and to make an enormous difference to drive down emissions while growing our economy.   Updated at 4.08am GMT    4.01am    The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, gets very agitated about the NBN and the former government\u2019s rollout and Paul Fletcher, a former communications minister, gets agitated over Rowland\u2019s comments. We move on.  Updated at 4.15am GMT    3.59am    Glad everyone got all of that off their chest. The argument to ban university debaters from becoming MPs continues.      3.59am    The Liberal MP for Banks, David Coleman asks: My question is to the minister for housing and it concerns the decision to abolish the Australian Building and Construction Commission. Master Builders Australia have told a Senate inquiry that the government\u2019s decision to abolish the ABCC will exacerbate supply-side pressures in the residential construction industry. How can the minister possibly deliver her promised 1m new affordable homes when the government has declared war on the building industry? There is a bunch of too-and-fro about whether this question is relevant for Julie Collins (housing) or for Tony Burke (IR) and so Milton Dick splits the question and gives half to Collins and half to Burke. Collins:  And I thank the member opposite for their question in relation to the housing accord. It\u2019s a really important piece of policy. This is the first time we\u2019ve had three tiers of government agree. This is about getting all three tiers of government on the same page. It\u2019s about the industry and the sector. The Master Builders Association were, of course, a part of the accord and agreed to the accord, as did other parts of the industry and the sector, including superannuation funds. This is about bringing people together. This is about seriously dealing with housing affordability and the low supply. We need more stock of housing in this country and the accord is a ground-breaking, once-in-a-generation piece, and to actually implement this and to build a million homes from 2024 to 2029. The Master Builders Association agreed with this and they\u2019ve signed up to it and they\u2019re part of the accord.  Burke:  I\u2019ll tell you about the ABCC, I\u2019ve yet to see the residential house that wasn\u2019t built because there was a union sticker in the corner of a safety sign. I\u2019m yet to see the home that couldn\u2019t be built because of the flag that was flying at a site. I\u2019m yet to see - I\u2019m yet to see any relevance, any relevance of the obsessions of ABCC with whether or not a home gets built. Have a listen what federal court judges had to say about the ABCC. They were blasted for prosecuting union officials for \u201chaving a cup of tea with a mate\u201d. Apparently, those opposite think that\u2019s the enemy of residential housing. Described as a minuscule, insignificant affair. Described by ... Described as \u2018a battleship in full steam that treated proceedings as a blood sport.\u2019 Issues that the Fair Work Ombudsman would deal with. The way you can tell, whenever they ask a question about the ABCC, never once do they refer to any of the things that only the ABCC deal with. So, they want to talk about criminal matters, which the ABCC couldn\u2019t deal with, or they want to talk about bullying matters or right-of-entry matters, the province of the Fair Work Ombudsman anyway. All of those don\u2019t stack up to a regulator that was meant to be politicised from the beginning, that was there about - those opposite were engaging, because they had one objective put people in their corners. It was their method of governing, not industrial relations.   Updated at 4.22am GMT    3.52am    Paul Fletcher takes time out from his busy point of order schedule to ask:  My question is to the minister for small business and again concerns the government\u2019s radical industrial relations bill. Can the minister for small business, i again ask, can the minister for small business identify a single small business that has told her that it supports these radical new laws? Just one.  Julie Collins:  Thank you, Mr Speaker. And I thank the member for his question. If he met with small businesses and spoke to them on a regular basis, he would know that there are a range of issues that small businesses are raising, including, of course, staff shortages. He would also know that there are many small businesses paying above award wages to maintain their staff, given the staff shortages. He would also note that when low-paid workers get a pay rise, that many of these workers spend their money in local small businesses.   Updated at 4.04am GMT    3.51am    Mark Dreyfus takes a dixer on the anti-corruption commission legislation:  The bills that will be debated in this House this week are the outcome of months of work and extensive consultation. The bills have been examined by three committee inquiries, including a joint select committee inquiry that delivered an unanimous report.  This is an opportunity for this House to come together, respect the mandate given by the Australian people, and support these bills. We are not afraid of constructive criticism and dialogue. In fact, we\u2019ve encouraged it throughout the process that led us to this point. There will be significant debate as these bills pass through the House and the Senate, as there should be.  But through that debate, we should not lose sight of the task that has been given to us by the Australian people to deliver a National Anti-Corruption Commission with teeth and without delay.  This government stands ready to deliver and I call on all sides of the parliament to join us in that task.      3.49am    Sussan Ley starts a question with the phrase \u201cram through\u201d the IR laws as \u201cpay back trade unions\u201d for their support and Tony Burke has a point of order that members can\u2019t assign motive. And also, I know not everyone paid attention in history, but Labor was literally built on the back of trade unions. The Labor party emerged from the labour movement. So of course the unions support the Labor party. It is not exactly rocket science. Milton Dick upholds the point of order (shocking) and Ley rephrases the question to take out the parts of the question which were objected to:  The National Retail Association has warned that retailers will be forced to pass on increased costs to Australians when they go shopping this Christmas, making a bad cost-of-living situation worse. Can the Minister for Small Business name one small business who has told her they support these radical new laws?  Julie Collins:  Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the member for her question. As I said in this place just a week or so ago, we are meeting with small businesses all the time and discuss a range of matters right across the board, and we continue to have discussions as we work through this important piece of legislation that is actually about getting wages moving. As she would be aware, there are many low-income, particularly in feminised industries, workers who desperately need a pay rise who need a pay rise.   Updated at 4.05am GMT    3.40am    Jim Chalmers takes a dixer on flood support and gives this update:  Our immediate support to individuals includes the one-off disaster recovery payment, $1,000 for adults and $400 for children. These are currently available to 46 local government areas. The disaster recovery allowance provides up to 13 weeks\u2019 income support, has been activated for 150 local government areas. So far, more than $55m in direct financial assistance has been provided to more than 47,000 claims across New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania. And as the House knows, we also provision something like $3bn in the budget in October to help communities with the recovery. Now, this is first and foremost a human tragedy. It does have economic consequences as well. Pressure on our supply chains, pressure on the price of groceries, and it will have an impact on economic growth in the near term as well. Now, these economic and budget considerations are substantial, but they are secondary to helping people through these difficult times. And so I say to people in flood-affected communities, your government will be there for you, you are not on your own, communities will need to rebuild, the bill will be substantial, and the federal government will play its part and pay its share.   Updated at 3.44am GMT    3.38am    Helen Haines has the first crossbench question and it is an actual question about people in her electorate.  In my electorate, the same record rainfall that\u2019s caused widespread flooding has also caused a massive landslide which has cut off access to Falls Creek for five months, decimating the summer season economy. But those affected look at the Services Australia website and only see financial assistance for people directly affected by floods. Can the minister confirm these people are eligible for the disaster recovery allowance and are there plans for further support?  Bill Shorten:  Many local government areas right across Australia have been affected by incredibly damaging natural disaster events. Falls Creek, in the Alpine Shire in the north-east of Victoria, is one of 153 communities that are currently eligible for disaster assistance. There\u2019s been a landslide on the way to Falls Creek and it\u2019s affected the businesses, and Falls Creek, whilst it\u2019s a year-round tourist facility, most of its season is in the winter. But there are businesses who still seek to operate all year round. Now, residents at Falls Creek, I can inform the member, are eligible to apply for disaster recovery allowance, and also a Commonwealth-funded disaster recovery funding arrangements. Services Australia has investigated for me today, in the course of today, about Falls Creek and whether or not there were payments which people were eligible for and haven\u2019t been made. As I understand, there have been 46 claims made for disaster relief allowance. They have all been paid. There is one claim where the status is indeterminate, but 46 out of 47 have been made. In terms of the businesses affected year-round, that doesn\u2019t fall within the immediate [duty of] Services Australia, and I will certainly raise it with the Victorian government. But as far as my ministerial obligation are, everyone who has put in a claim has actually had it processed. If there are other people who the member is aware of who haven\u2019t, we\u2019ll, of course, attend to it straightaway. And I just want to thank Services Australia staff. They have been working all around Australia right through Central New South Wales to Rochester and Victoria, and they\u2019re doing a great job, and I send them our best wishes from the parliament for helping people affected.   Updated at 3.48am GMT    3.33am    Back to question time and Peter Dutton joins Anthony Albanese in welcoming Sean Turnell\u2019s release:  I join with the prime minister and congratulate the government on this outcome. Sean Turnell, somebody who went to try and provide assistance and a better way of life and future for the people of Myanmar. He worked very closely there with a number of Australian colleagues who were involved in that cause. And, of course, we were all shocked when he was taken into custody, and the operation to release him commenced on that very day. We acknowledge the work of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Defence, many other departments that have been involved in this operation to lead to the point of his release. I want to say thank you very much for the perseverance that the prime minister spoke of, of many of our near neighbours and friends within Asean, with whom we\u2019d had close conversations over a long period of time, every angle of opportunity to bring pressure to bear to see him released has been under way for about 650-odd days, and I want to say thank you personally to the prime minister as well. It\u2019s right that he\u2019s been released. It was wrong that he was held for so long. And I hope that it sends a message to the rest of the world that Australia will never tolerate our people being incarcerated in circumstances like that, and we will fight every day until they\u2019re released.   Updated at 3.47am GMT    3.31am   Children taken to hospital after chemical explosion in Sydney\u2019s north  Breaking into question time for this breaking news from Elias Visontay: A group of primary school students have been taken to hospitals on Sydney\u2019s north following reports of a chemical explosion. Children believed to be about 10-years-old were treated at Manly West public school on Monday afternoon, with some transported to hospitals for further treatment. The number of students and exact cause of the incident is not yet clear. Some media are reporting between 10-12 students were injured. A New South Wales Ambulance spokesperson told Guardian Australia the chemical explosion appeared to be the result of a class science experiment. New South Wales Police officers responded to reports of a \u201cHazmat incident\u201d at about 1.20pm on Monday afternoon. Police said, via statement:  A number of students, believed to be around 10-years-old, have been treated at the scene by NSW Ambulance paramedics and will be taken to various hospitals.   Updated at 3.50am GMT    3.31am    The next dixer (government question written for government minister) is on Professor Sean Turnell\u2019s release. Anthony Albanese:  Indeed, it was a great day last week when Professor Sean Turnell was released after 650 days in detention by the Myanmar regime. 650 days in a Myanmar prison. It was one of the great honours of my life to have the phone call with him when he landed in Bangkok at around about the same time that I did the other evening.  It was fantastic that he was able to reunite with his wife, Dr Havu, an economics lecturer, in Melbourne on the weekend after 22 months apart, and they were able to be flown home to Sydney.  Mr Turnell is a great Australian and he\u2019s very proud to be an Australian, and we should all be proud of him. What was extraordinary about the conversation I had with him was that he was just busy thanking people, thanking the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, thanking the Foreign Minister Penny Wong, thanking the embassy staff in Yangon and in Bangkok, thanking the Australian people who had campaigned so strongly for his release from that hellhole in prison. When I spoke to him, he spoke about getting food in a bucket, but that the Australian Embassy would deliver food for him, food hampers, with an Australian bag with the crest of the emu and the kangaroo.  The emu and the kangaroo, of course, don\u2019t go backwards, they only go forwards. And he would put their bag facing outside of the cell so that those people who had incarcerated him would see his pride in Australia. He is a great Australian.  He, of course, is a highly respected academic. He developed a specialty in the Myanmar economy and he worked as an adviser long-term to Aung San Suu Kyi, who he met in the 1990s. He continued to live in Sydney but he travelled regularly to Myanmar to provide advice to that country on how they might develop. He was detained on 6 February 2021, five days after the military coup.  I do want to thank our friends in ASEAN who made strong representation, our friends throughout, including the Cambodian ... prime minister, but others as well, from Vietnam, from I pay tribute to him for his courage, his determination and his resilience, and I wish him and his family all of the best      3.27am    Angus Taylor is up next and continues his one-man show \u201cirony, is it even a thing?\u201d as he asks:  The chief economist of Goldman Sachs has warned that the cash rate will continue to rise to 4.1% over the next year, meaning Australian mortgage-holders will be paying more for longer under this government. Will the prime minister confirm the promise of cheaper mortgages is now just another broken promise?  Treasurer Jim Chalmers takes this one:  Given the shadow treasurer seems temperamentally incapable of asking me a question, I\u2019ve gotta take my chances when I can. I\u2019ve gotta take my chances when I can. Mr Speaker, since 25 October, there have been two eclipses - one solar, one lunar - and there have been two questions from the shadow treasurer to the treasurer about the budget. Questions from the shadow treasurer to the treasurer after the budget are as rare as a very rare celestial event, Mr Speaker. And so I\u2019ve gotta take my chances when I can and jump when I can. Now, let me get this straight, let me get this straight, Mr Speaker. One of the worst ministers since Federation, the member for Hume, in one of the worst governments since Federation, one of the least responsible when it comes to the budget since Federation, which racked up a trillion dollars in debt and had almost nothing to show for it, who sprayed billions of dollars around to their mates in the interests of their political purposes and their political objectives, now wants to get up and talk about spending in the budget. I mean, give me a break, Mr Speaker. What was different about this budget in October compared to the budget handed down by those opposite in March is, what we did when we got a temporary boost to revenue from high commodity prices, we returned for two years 99% of that upward revision. That meant over the forward estimates there\u2019s less debt in my Budget over the forwards than there was in the budget handed down by treasurer Frydenberg from this dispatch box. And so what that has meant is our budget was geared towards the inflation challenge because we know that high inflation is pushing up interest rates. Now, treasury modelling released today, and reported on today, showed that if we had spent that $114bn of tax upgrades, like those opposite would have wanted to do and would have done in our position, then interest rates would be another 1.4% higher, percentage points higher, than they are. And so that has meant - that has meant that the rising interest rates that we inherited from those opposite, interest rates started going up before the election, which might be news to the shadow treasurer as well - had we not handed down such a responsible budget, then interest rates would be higher than otherwise, and inflation would be higher than otherwise. And that\u2019s why we did put so much effort into it, at the same time as we kept faith with our election commitments on cheaper early childhood education and fee-free Tafe and all of the other priorities in the budget. We made sure that we showed spending restraint, which is completely foreign to those opposite. They used to spend 60% of revenue upgrades. The Howard government used to spend 70% of revenue upgrades. We spent 1% over the next two years. That\u2019s how you hand down a budget which doesn\u2019t make the inflation problem worse.   Updated at 3.33am GMT    3.23am    Anthony Albanese\u2019s first dixer is on his recent trip and the importance of it for Australia:  I held 14 bilateral meetings, the important one, of course, the first meeting with China for six years. It was a very constructive meeting with President Xi and I want us to move forward together with a stabilisation of the relationship. It\u2019s very clear that we have differences, but dialogue promotes understanding. My attitude towards China is that we must cooperate where we can, disagree where we must, but engage in our national interest. I also had an important meeting with prime minister Modi, and I will lead a business delegation to India in the first quarter of next year. In addition to that, we were able to further develop the constructive relationship that we now have with president Macron of France and other European leaders to promote the EU-Australia free trade agreement that I\u2019m hoping to advance next year.   Updated at 3.31am GMT    3.22am   Question time begins  The first question from Peter Dutton takes us back to rhetoric and times a lot of people hoped we had moved on from. But Dutton, as Murph highlighted in a recent column, is hoping to reignite a culture war which served the coalition well for many years. Dutton:   Prime minister, at a time when Labor\u2019s policies are driving up cost-of-living pressures for families, the government has just signed up to funding a $2tn loss and damage climate fund which will send money overseas and beyond our region. Prime minister, doesn\u2019t charity begin at home? And when will you start helping Australian families instead of giving away their money?  Anthony Albanese:  And I do thank the leader of the opposition for really repeating a question that he answered last week. And I will begin the same way. I\u2019ll tell you what we will do - or we won\u2019t do, which is to stand at a press conference ... with a microphone making jokes about Pacific Islands drowning. That is what we won\u2019t do. And the misleading statement from the leader of the opposition aimed clearly...  Paul Fletcher interjects, because that seems to be his main job now \u2013arguing that an opposition MP has been \u201creflected upon\u201d and then being told he does not have a point of order. Albanese:  Thanks, Mr Speaker. I tell you what was offensive, it was the tactics committee meeting that came up with that question this morning. That was what was offensive. Because the idea, the idea that any foreign aid is giving Australians money to foreigners ahead of Australian interests, the Leader of the Opposition knows better, and he knows exactly what he is doing with that question. He knows exactly. And the only people who are pleased about that question are the people sitting in the corner up there. Because they represent seats that have rejected that sort of dog-whistling tactic from the Liberal party, from the Liberal party. \u2026The leader of the opposition, who pretends he wants to be kinder and gentler, comes into this house ... comes into this house and asks a question like that. Well, I tell you what the entry fee is to enter into discussions around the table with our international partners. Whether it\u2019s the United Kingdom, whether it\u2019s the United States, whether it\u2019s Japan, whether it\u2019s India, it is taking climate change seriously. That is the entry ticket that you need in international affairs in 2022. What you don\u2019t need is that sort of nonsense. And for a political party who say that Australia ... isn\u2019t good enough because we need a global reduction in emissions, but then to press that button shows the contradiction which is there, shows the contradiction which is there. I\u2019d say to the leader of the opposition, \u201cYou\u2019re better than that. You\u2019re better than that.\u201d Or maybe you\u2019re not.   Updated at 3.36am GMT    3.12am    The speeches from Anthony Albanese and Peter Dutton end (with no mention of children overboard) and the condolence motion heads to the federation chamber. Question time begins.      3.01am    Ahead of question time is a condolence motion for Peter Reith. Anthony Albanese and Peter Dutton will both speak on the motion and then it will most likely head to the federation chamber.  Updated at 3.11am GMT    3.00am   It is time for question time  So get ready for some very lame calls, some fake laughs and some confected outrage.  Updated at 3.12am GMT    2.51am    And she thinks the opposition will be on-board. Bridget Archer:  I do and I am very pleased that that appears to be the case. I think there will still be discussion and debate around the edges of the legislation, that has probably been foreshadowed in the committee inquiry into the bill on the crossbench has indicated that they seek to move some amendments as well and that is a normal process, and a good one. But I think that I have always said that in order for an integrity commission to be successful, it cannot be political or it will fail at the first hurdle.    Updated at 3.18am GMT    2.49am    \u2018There needs to be strong protections for whistleblowers\u2019: Bridget Archer Liberal MP Bridget Archer says she agrees with the crossbench on the issue of whistleblower protections. She told the ABC:  There needs to be strong protections for whistleblowers as part of an integrity framework. We have had assurances from the attorney general that there will be additional legislation brought forward to deal with the issue of whistleblowers and that must sit alongside an anti-corruption commission. So I take the attorney general at his word and I look forward to seeing that work through constructively.  Because, much like an integrity commission, I think that these issues should be beyond partisan politics and what Mr Wilkie has said today gives the importance of having protections for whistleblowers. You need to have people be able to have a mechanism to bring this information forward and know that they are protected. These are very serious matters but, also, there is a lot at stake and whistleblowers risk a lot.   Updated at 3.14am GMT    2.47am    Crossbench comes together to support Andrew Wilkie The independents on the crossbench have come together to support Andrew Wilkie and his call for stronger protections for whistleblowers. Kooyong MP Monique Ryan said it is what people voted for.  Six months ago the Australia people told them what action on climate change and action on transparency and integrity in government. Andrew\u2019s actions today are acting on that we are all calling on the government to follow suit.   Updated at 3.14am GMT    2.42am   Peabody and Anglo American deny Andrew Wilkie's coal export claims  Several companies have vehemently denied claims aired by the independent MP Andrew Wilkie that they had been \u201clying for years about the quality of our coal\u201d and had been engaged in bribes. As we reported earlier, Wilkie claimed, under parliamentary privilege:  This shocking misconduct includes exports to Japan, South Korea, China and India, and involves companies including Terracom, Anglo American, Glencore, Peabody and Macquarie Bank.  A Peabody spokesperson told Guardian Australia \u201cPeabody strenuously denies Mr Wilkie\u2019s claims.\u201d A spokesperson for Anglo American also rejected the claims.  The allegations made by Andrew Wilkie MP with regard to Anglo American are entirely false. We take these matters very seriously and when issues surrounding testing were first reported on by media in early 2020, we undertook an investigation which found no evidence that any of our cargoes had been impacted. We have communicated with Mr Wilkie\u2019s office to ensure he has correct information.  We\u2019ve also contacted Terracom, Glencore and Macquarie Bank for comment.  Updated at 3.16am GMT    2.40am    Greens to try and block loan for East Gippsland gas project The Greens will try and stop a federal government commercial loan being given to GN Energy to accelerate the Golden Beach gas production and storage project in East Gippsland. It was granted ahead of the last election, but the Greens are hoping to get support for a disallowance motion to stop the loan from going ahead. It is unlikely to pass the Senate, but Dorinda Cox says it is something worth fighting for:  On Monday, the Senate will have an opportunity to show it\u2019s serious about fixing the climate crisis by blocking public money going to new gas projects. Labor can\u2019t criticise gas corporations one day, then hand out public money the next. Real climate action in Victoria means stopping new coal and gas projects from the 12 Apostles to Gippsland, and that is what The Greens will do.\u201d   Updated at 3.57am GMT    2.23am    I have had a few messages from people about why it seems a little quiet today, given how busy the agenda is. Think of this week as the calm before the storm. The Senate is where the real action is. And the government isn\u2019t ready to send all those bills up for debate as yet. So there is a lot happening behind the scenes as everyone prepares for what is going to be, as Katy Gallagher said, a pretty \u201cwild ride\u201d. The national anti-corruption legislation has to get through the house and that debate will be a looooong one. Plus, each of the amendments are going to be considered separately. And there are a lot. They aren\u2019t ready for the vote on IR \u2013 that will be the most of the white knuckle ones \u2013 and the territory rights bill, which potential IR legislation king maker David Pocock holds in great importance \u2013 also has to be voted on before the end of the sitting. So right no, the \u201ccheaper child care\u201d legislation is in the Senate and things are ticking away in the background. It is going to be a tight race to the finish line for some of these bills. So strap in. (And also get a coffee. And a snack.)  Updated at 3.57am GMT    2.11am    \u2018He was respected by so many\u2019: Daniel Andrews on death of Nationals candidate Shaun Gilchrist Benita Kolovos has shared the statement Daniel Andrews has released in response to the death of the Nationals candidate for Narracan, Shaun Gilchrist.  On behalf of the Victorian Government, I offer our sincere condolences to the family and friends of the National Party\u2019s Candidate for Narracan, Shaun Gilchrist. While Shaun and I had never met, I know he was respected by so many across the community for his warmth, his humour and his hard work. I have no doubt he shared the same ambition so many of us do in wanting to get involved with politics to change society for the better, and make a positive contribution to the community around him. Our thoughts are with his family and friends, as well as his colleagues and his supporters, who are all grieving the most tragic of losses. We understand the Gilchrist family has requested privacy at this time, and we ask that be respected.   Updated at 2.28am GMT    2.10am    Australian intelligence chief on the challenges spy agencies face in the modern world Andrew Shearer, the head of Australia\u2019s Office of National Intelligence, has also spoken about how technology, bots and internet troll farms have reshaped the battle to influence narratives. Shearer said the speed and scale of such trends was \u201csomething that I think we\u2019re all grappling with\u201d. Shearer told a disinformation-focused session of the Halifax International Security Forum:  When I think about what\u2019s the intelligence component of this, you know, this is about truth and responding to these different tactics. How do we provide our traditional function in a way which is strategic warning, it\u2019s actionable insights into intelligence, collecting information that enables us to verify what\u2019s going on and making sense of it, assessing it? None of that\u2019s changed, but we have to do it in this incredibly dynamic, ultra-fast, massive high-volume, information-volume world and I think that\u2019s a real challenge.  Shearer was also asked about strategic decoupling from places like China. He didn\u2019t respond directly about China, but spoke about the need for western governments to \u201cpartner\u201d with technology platforms and civil society \u201cin completely different ways\u201d. And he alluded to the shutout of Chinese telco Huawei from Australia\u2019s 5G network:  Data will be at the heart of this and I\u2019m personally proud of the role that the Five Eyes played in helping to warn of some of the perils of 5G technologies, for example. I think that\u2019s a good example of where we need to go. But it also leads you to new partnerships. Back in that cold war model that I was talking about: that was essentially a government-led contest. We can\u2019t win this contest just with government - we need to partner with the platforms, with civil society in completely different ways. From an intelligence point of view, we need the technology and the tradecraft to do open-source collection at a massive scale. And we also need to be exploring things like artificial intelligence that can help us get behind deep fakes and so forth.   Updated at 2.21am GMT    2.09am   Australian intelligence chief praises US \u2018masterclass\u2019 during Ukraine invasion  Australia\u2019s top intelligence official, Andrew Shearer, has praised the US-led release of intelligence ahead of the Russian invasion of Ukraine as a \u201cmasterclass\u201d in how western governments can gain a strategic upper hand. The head of the Office of National Intelligence made the comments at an international security conference in Halifax, Canada, at the weekend, saying it could serve as a model to be used against other countries \u2013 which he did not name. Prior to Russia\u2019s further invasion of Ukraine in February, the US released detailed information about its assessment of Russian president Vladimir Putin\u2019s intentions and about the massive buildup of Russian troops along Ukraine\u2019s border. Shearer told the Halifax International Security Forum:  I can\u2019t really be here and not give a shout out, especially to my American counterparts, Avril Haines [the director of national intelligence in the Biden administration] and the entire US intelligence community [for] the masterclass that they put on leading up to and following the Russian invasion. Intelligence has completely reshaped the international narrative and gave the west the strategic initiative in an incredibly powerful way against a guy [Putin] who made his whole life about these techniques that we\u2019re talking about here.  Shearer was one of the panellists in a session titled \u201cThe Disinformation Nations: Kidnapping Our Citizens, Corrupting Our Officials, Stealing Our Stuff\u201d. Shearer, who has previously served as a security adviser to John Howard and Tony Abbott and was influential in shaping Scott Morrison\u2019s approach to China, suggested that western countries should think about whether the tactics could be adapted for use against \u201cother actors\u201d:  The intelligence role in this can be really important for getting back the strategic initiative, which I think is the power of the Ukraine example and for getting ahead of it. Frankly, once that happened, because of the breadth and the depth and the robustness of that intelligence base, it was like a shutout right? He couldn\u2019t \u2013 he never has got the strategic initiative back in that contest. To my mind that\u2019s the value intelligence can add. But, and there is a but, that\u2019s off the back of decades of intelligence work against the former Soviet Union and Russia by the United States, the United Kingdom, the other Five Eyes [Australia, New Zealand and Canada], it\u2019s off the back of established \u2026 networks for getting that intelligence out to your partners and allies. And we need to think hard about: how do we learn the lessons and transfer them to other areas and other actors?   Updated at 2.31am GMT    1.47am    Senate set to pass Labor\u2019s cheaper childcare bill The Senate is considering Labor\u2019s cheaper childcare bill, which will pass given the Liberal leader Peter Dutton has expressed the opposition\u2019s support for it. The opposition did successfully move amendments to require an independent review of the new subsidy scheme, to begin no later than July 2024 and report within three months \u2013 meaning there will possibly be some fodder in there for debate before the 2025 election. Senator David Pocock moved a symbolic amendment calling on the government to use the forthcoming Productivity Commission review to \u201cinclude consideration of activity requirements, education outcomes, addressing access for disadvantaged children and sector workforce requirements as part of its work\u201d. More significant Greens amendments, including removing the activity test, have been voted down.  Updated at 2.13am GMT    1.34am    Greens move to block federal funding for Victorian gas project The Greens\u2019 resources spokesperson Dorinda Cox will move to block federal money for a new gas project in Victoria in a Senate disallowance motion on Monday. The Morrison government approved a $32m commercial loan with GB Energy to accelerate the Golden Beach gas production and storage project in East Gippsland just before this year\u2019s federal election. Greens leader Adam Bandt said:  Labor can\u2019t keep backing new coal and gas projects. The big gas corporations are making giant profits and the public shouldn\u2019t be on the hook for a new gas project that will make the climate crisis worse. Labor needs to work with the Greens to ditch this terrible Morrison decision to back more gas.   Updated at 1.37am GMT    1.04am   Sophie Scamps supports Andrew Wilkie's call for coal inquiry after fraud allegations  Independent MP for Mackellar, Sophie Scamps, is supporting Andrew Wilkie\u2019s call for a parliament inquiry into allegations that Australia\u2019s coal industry has defrauded trading partners in relation to the quality of coal exports. In a statement, Scamps said:  The reality is there is no such thing as clean coal, and the evidence provided by this brave coal industry whistleblower suggests that the coal industry has been misleading the world for years. If true, what this information does is confirm three things. It shows the lengths the coal industry will go to mislead Australians, our trading partners and the world. Secondly, it shows we cannot trust the coal industry ... Finally, it shows the value and importance of whistleblowers and why we must protect whistleblowers. Whistleblowers must be better protected under the National Anti-Corruption Commission, and we also need a whistleblower commissioner to enforce whistleblower protection laws.    Updated at 1.33am GMT    12.56am   Companies were \u2018lying for years\u2019 about quality of clean coal exports, Wilkie claims in parliament  Independent MP Andrew Wilkie has made explosive claims that companies including Peabody energy, Glencore and Macquarie Bank have been involved in \u201clying for years about the quality of our coal\u201d. In a speech to the House of Representatives this morning, under parliamentary privilege, Wilkie alleged that \u201ccoal companies operating in Australia are using fraudulent quality reports for their exports, and paying bribes to representatives of their overseas customers to keep the whole scam secret\u201d.  And this has allowed them to claim, for years, that Australian coal is cleaner than it is in order to boost profits and prevent rejection of shipments at their destination.\u201d  Wilkie said he\u2019d been provided with thousands of documents from a coal industry whistleblower. He alleged:  This shocking misconduct includes exports to Japan, South Korea, China and India, and involves companies including Terracom, Anglo American, Glencore, Peabody and Macquarie Bank.  A spokesperson for Peabody told Guardian Australia that the company would provide a statement shortly, but rejected the claims and said they had been reported previously. Wilkie also claimed coal testing companies ALS and SGS had been involved in fraudulent testing. Guardian Australia has contacted each of those companies for response. Wilkie detailed one specific instance where he claimed the moisture content in a coal sample was initially set at 16.7%, but later amended to 15.9%, which is drier and burns cleaner. He alleged that such a change represented \u201chundreds of thousands of dollars in extra profit\u201d and meant an export shipment wouldn\u2019t be rejected on arrival. Wilkie wants the parliament to set up an inquiry into the claims, so the whistleblower can detail their information. He claimed that federal and NSW police, as well as government departments and agencies were aware of the information, but had not taken action. Wilkie said:  That\u2019s important because the fraud is environmental vandalism and makes all the talk of net zero emissions by 2050 a fiction. It could also be criminal, trashing corporate reputations as well as our national reputation.   Updated at 1.26am GMT    12.52am    Options under consideration to close BNPL regulation gap For those looking for more information on the buy now, pay later consultation paper Stephen Jones has been talking about, this is what Treasury are looking at: Today\u2019s paper outlines three options to close the regulation gap:  Option one: Stronger industry self-regulation plus a new \u201caffordability test\u201d requirement; Option two: Partly bringing BNPL into the Credit Act, including licensing providers and a sliding \u201cunsuitability test\u201d; Option three: Completely bringing BNPL into the Credit Act in line with credit cards and other traditional credit products.  Anyone can make a submission \u2013 you can find the details here.  Updated at 1.02am GMT    12.46am    If you missed the news out of Cop27 over the weekend, this is an excellent snapshot:   Updated at 12.56am GMT    12.39am    Fellow independent MP Dr Sophie Scamps has come out in support of Andrew Wilkie\u2019s call for an investigation into the coal industry.      11.59pm    Chamber of commerce campaign against IR bill heats up Australia\u2019s chambers of commerce have penned an open letter to senators, pleading with them to either split or kill the government\u2019s proposed workplace relations overhaul. With the Labor government aiming to pass the bill before the year is out, the letter blasts the timeframe on the bill as \u201cabsurdly short\u201d and says jobs and businesses are in jeopardy if it becomes law. It\u2019s signed by Australia\u2019s national, state and territory chambers of commerce, and calls on senators to try to split controversial elements out of the bill and pass some straightforward changes as soon as possible. If that can\u2019t happen, they want senators to oppose the bill in its entirety. \u201cAs we emerge from the pandemic, businesses are dealing with surging energy costs, rising interest rates and face serious global economic headwinds,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cThe last thing we need is for jobs to be in jeopardy because of rushed new rules and red tape.\u201d The letter outlines business concern multi-employer bargaining changes will \u201cdrag them into a complex system they can\u2019t afford\u201d. They also say higher costs will drive inflation and push up interest rates, and \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d wages will undermine flexibility and productivity. \u201cWe all share the ambition of wage growth, but lifting productivity is the way to do this, not by taking control away from businesses and their employees,\u201d it reads. \u201cSome employers will cut back on ambitions to grow. Others will be forced to close their doors.\u201d Labor has indicated it won\u2019t let the controversial elements be split from the bill, saying that would defeat the overall purpose of getting wages moving. \u2013 via AAP   Updated at 12.21am GMT    11.42pm    Katy Gallagher on whether the upper house will sit for longer: \u2018If the Senate agrees, then that will occur\u2019 Just to be clear, it is almost a done deal that the Senate will be sitting longer. For those who missed it, this was Katy Gallagher this morning, speaking to ABC radio RN:  I\u2019m talking to all of the crossbench around the sitting program and whether or not we can secure some extra days. And I think I\u2019m pretty hopeful that might look like a Friday this week and a Friday next week. And we\u2019ll see where we get to at the end of the first week. We\u2019ve got a lot of bills to get through. And the Senate is going to be a pretty wild old place for the next fortnight in processing legislation and debating legislation. So I think we will end up with extra hours. We haven\u2019t locked everybody in on that yet. But I think the government\u2019s position is we\u2019d like to sit to get a whole range of bills done. And if the Senate agrees, then that will occur.  (The Senate has to agree, which means a vote \u2013 which is why she is talking to the crossbench).   Updated at 12.20am GMT    11.40pm    Nationals Victoria on \u2018tragic and unexpected death of candidate for Narracan, Shaun Gilchrist\u2019 The Nationals Victorian director, Matthew Harris, has issued a statement following the death of the party\u2019s candidate in Narracan \u2013 Shaun Gilchrist \u2013 less than a week out from the state election:  Today I have written to the Victorian electoral commission to advise of the tragic and unexpected death of the Nationals\u2019 candidate for Narracan, Shaun Gilchrist. The Victorian Nationals express our deepest sympathies to the family and friends of Mr Gilchrist, and our thoughts remain with them at this difficult time. The Gilchrist family has asked for privacy and respect during their time of grief.  The seat of Narracan is currently held by the Liberals\u2019 Gary Blackwood, who is retiring at the 26 November election, on a 10% margin.  Updated at 12.18am GMT    11.25pm   Greens push for amendments to childcare bill  The Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi has a few amendments she would like to move on the government\u2019s cheaper childcare bill (including changing the name): The amendments aim to:  Improve access to early education and care by abolishing the activity test, Improve transparency measures within the bill by expanding reporting requirements for providers, Extend staff discounts for early education and care, and Rename the bill from \u201cCheaper Child Care\u201d to \u201cMore Affordable Early Education and Care\u201d.  The government and at least one crossbencher would have to vote for them for it to pass (if the opposition does not support it). Faruqi says they are necessary changes:  The activity test is cruel, punitive and beyond repair. As the Senate inquiry heard from numerous stakeholders, the activity test has the effect of denying access to early education for the most disadvantaged children and punishing families with insecure, casual work. We welcome new reporting requirements for large providers in the bill but consider that these requirements should be expanded to cover all providers. The Senate inquiry heard that the language of \u2018cheaper childcare\u2019 used in the bill could undervalue the role of educators. We agree and will move to rename the bill to refer to \u2018more affordable early education and care\u2019. The Greens believe early childhood education and care is an essential service that should be free and accessible for all. High-quality early education can give children the best start in life and is a critical component of lifelong learning. While the government bill does not go nearly far enough to achieve our vision of universal and free early education and care, the Australian Greens support the bill as it nonetheless represents a step in the right direction.    Updated at 12.25am GMT    11.19pm    Financial services minister says buy now, pay later regulation about \u2018regulating to risk\u2019 Stephen Jones has spoken to the Seven Network about the buy now, pay later consultation paper, saying it was about \u201cregulating to risk\u201d.  These are all the reasons that we do want to look at them, but we want to ensure that we\u2019re regulating to risk. And we\u2019re also mindful of the fact that for the majority of consumers, they\u2019re using this as an alternative to a credit card and they\u2019re doing so safely. We don\u2019t want to crash down on innovation. We don\u2019t want to stop people getting access to something that they\u2019re using properly and safely. But we do want to ensure that there is a basic level of check in place here that ensures that it\u2019s both affordable and appropriate to the consumers, which is the basic test inside the National Consumer Credit Act. The thing is, these aren\u2019t home loans, and that\u2019s an important distinction to make. These are generally small amounts of credit in the one and $200 level. So we want to ensure that if we are moving to regulate, it\u2019s appropriate to the level of risk involved.   Updated at 12.15am GMT    11.12pm    You can find the Senate paper here.  Updated at 11.17pm GMT    11.11pm    For those wanting to see the program:      11.09pm   And \u2026 the parliament is sitting  The House and Senate have commenced. It is going to be a very long couple of weeks.  Updated at 12.14am GMT    11.06pm    Jim Chalmers: Cop27\u2019s loss and damage fund \u2018the beginning of the conversation\u2019 On the loss and damage fund the Cop27 agreed to establish (it is not funded as yet) Jim Chalmers told the Nine Network it is the start of the conversation. The fund is designed to help developing nations cope with the impacts of climate change. It was one of the things Chris Bowen was negotiating for while at the UN climate conference.  First of all, it\u2019s not a compensation fund, it\u2019s not about reparations or compensation. It\u2019s based on a pretty simple principle that I think a lot of Australians would agree with, and that is that the developed world has a role to play in helping the developing world deal with the impact of climate change. I think, particularly for Australians, we do have a responsibility to our brothers and sisters in the Pacific, in particular, to see what we can do to help. Now, this fund that was agreed at the COP conference, it\u2019s been agreed in concept, it\u2019s the beginning of the conversation, not the end of the conversation \u2013 the design of the fund, the contribution of the fund, that will all be subject to further conversations.   Updated at 12.15am GMT    10.51pm   Andrew Wilkie makes accusations of \u2018fraud' in Australia's coal industry  Independent MP Andrew Wilkie will make claims of \u201cfraud\u201d in the Australian coal industry in parliament this morning, with the transparency advocate to make accusations that fossil fuel companies have been using fraudulent reports about the quality of their product \u2013 and paying bribes to keep it quiet. \u201cThis has allowed them to claim, for years, that Australian coal is cleaner than it is in order to boost profits and to prevent rejection of shipments at their destination,\u201d Wilkie claimed. The accusations, first revealed in the Nine newspapers this morning, stem from what Wilkie says are thousands of documents provided to him by a whistleblower, who he says is an executive in the coal industry. Wilkie will detail more of the claims at 10am in a speech to parliament, and wants the government to launch an inquiry into the explosive allegations.  Wilkie said:  In essence Speaker, coal companies operating in Australia are using fraudulent quality reports for their exports, and paying bribes to representatives of their overseas customers to keep the whole scam secret. And that\u2019s important because the fraud is environmental vandalism and makes all the talk of net zero emissions by 2050 a fiction. It could also be criminal, trashing corporate reputations as well as our national reputation. I call on the government to at least establish a parliamentary inquiry into the matter, one where the witnesses of this misconduct, including the whistleblower I\u2019m in contact with, can safely present their testimonies and evidence, and where the industry can explain itself.  We\u2019ll bring you more after 10am, with Wilkie also to hold a press conference at 11am.   Updated at 12.40am GMT    10.44pm    Katy Gallagher says government \u2018won\u2019t be distracted\u2019 by campaigns against IR bill There are quite a few advertising campaigns against the government\u2019s IR legislation. As AAP reports, the government is pushing on regardless:  The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry is launching a campaign opposing the bill, arguing it will cost workers jobs rather than lift wages. The bill has already passed the lower house and is set to be debated in the Senate in the next fortnight as the government pushes to pass the laws by the end of the year. Labor\u2019s Senate leader Katy Gallagher said the fierce opposition to the bill would not shake the government\u2019s belief it was the right course of action. \u2018We won\u2019t be distracted by an advertising campaign and we will continue to advocate on behalf of working Australians and getting wages moving,\u2019 she told ABC Radio. \u2018We\u2019ll fight for this legislation on its merits and we\u2019ve been doing that since the legislation has been released. \u2018Where people spend money on advertising campaigns is their decision; some will argue money could be better spent on other things, but that is their decision.\u2019  She added she was hopeful the Senate would sit two extra days \u2013 Fridays this week and next \u2013 to ensure the bill passed before the end of the year.  Updated at 10.51pm GMT    10.25pm    \u2018Debate\u2019 continues Tanya Plibersek:  We\u2019re working very hard with the gas companies and state and territory governments to do exactly that, to bring down the price of energy. We\u2019ve really got to focus on gas in the short term, but in the longer term we know what the plan is. It\u2019s to get cheaper, cleaner, renewable energy into the grid. We\u2019ve got $20bn set aside to upgrade our transmission networks. We\u2019re on a target of 82% renewable energy because we know that renewable energy is the cheapest form of electricity in human history.  Barnaby Joyce:  It\u2019s not. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s just not.  Plibersek:  And that\u2019s why three \u2013 it is, Barnaby \u2013 and that\u2019s why 3 million people \u2013  Joyce:  It\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s not.  Plibersek:  \u2026 have put solar panels on their roof.  Joyce:  It\u2019s ridiculous saying it. It\u2019s like \u2026  Plibersek:  Because they know that it\u2019s cheaper.  Joyce:  Oh my God.  Plibersek:  It\u2019s cheaper, Barnaby.  Joyce:  Look at your power bill.  Plibersek:  Of course, it is.  Joyce:  Look at your power bill. That is the reality of it. And covering the country with wind turbines. I\u2019ll tell you what their plan is, they\u2019re about to \u2013 AGL is about to blow up Liddell. So good luck. In June the grid almost fell over, and the power price, if you want the facts.  If you want the facts, don\u2019t go to Joyce.  Updated at 10.37pm GMT    10.06pm    Joyce labels emissions targets \u2018inflationary\u2019 Asked what he thinks, Barnaby Joyce launches into nonsense. It\u2019s just nonsense:  Well, what we have is a whole group of things that are causing major problems, and the advent of the Labor party coming to power we\u2019ve got the 2030 legislated targets that\u2019s inflationary, that\u2019s putting up the price of electricity which puts up the price of food, the price of your power bill, the price of fuel.  He writes about this tactic in his book, Weatherboard and Iron, and how he made it work with the \u201c$100 lamb roast\u201d. You just keep saying something until it\u2019s all people are talking about and then it becomes its own truth. Joyce is banking on people not having moved on from the carbon tax (which was never a tax) but he might find that voters, who are dealing with floods, and have dealt with fires and massive storms as well as a pandemic, have shifted their views on climate change somewhat since he last tried this move.  Updated at 10.34pm GMT    10.01pm    Plibersek v Joyce  Tanya Plibersek once again had to \u201cdebate\u201d Barnaby Joyce on the Seven network this morning, this time on the government\u2019s IR bill. Asked about the mining industry claim it will cost 30,000 jobs, Plibersek says:  I think that\u2019s a completely hysterical reaction to what we\u2019re proposing, which is more secure work and better pay. We know that Australians haven\u2019t had a pay increase in nine years. They\u2019re finding it really hard to make ends meet, the cost of everything\u2019s gone up. Wages haven\u2019t been keeping up. Our industrial relations laws are designed to give Australians a pay rise when they work hard. We know the previous government said that low wages were a deliberate design feature of their economic architecture. They said that. We came to government promising to get wages moving and that\u2019s what we\u2019re determined to do.  Under the legislation as it now stands, workplaces on an EBA don\u2019t have to take part in multi-employer bargaining.  Updated at 10.05pm GMT    9.56pm    PM still in the air \u2026 Because he hasn\u2019t had enough travel in the last two weeks during summit season, Anthony Albanese will deliver his speech to the trade conference in Melbourne, before heading to Canberra for the parliament sitting.  Updated at 9.57pm GMT    9.43pm    \u2018We are acting with some urgency\u2019 The changes will most likely come through regulations, meaning they won\u2019t need legislative changes, but Jim Chalmers said he understands the clock is ticking:  We\u2019ve made it clear that we are acting with some urgency here but there are a lot of considerations and complexities to weigh up. Our intention is to announce our approach here before Christmas, as we\u2019ve said. We will deal with any of the legislative or regulatory issues as they arise. This is a complex issue that we\u2019re dealing with. It has big consequences for Australians and for Australian and industry. We are acting with some urgency but we\u2019re also making sure that we get it right \u2013 that we weigh up all of the considerations and complexities and we\u2019ll act as soon as we can.   Updated at 9.52pm GMT    9.42pm    High energy prices blamed on \u2018Russian aggression and Coalition incompetence\u2019  The treasurer did a quick press conference this morning where he didn\u2019t say a lot new, but did recommit the government to finding some sort of solution for energy prices by the end of the year. Both the treasurer and prime minister have said they want to give an answer by Christmas. Jim Chalmers:  We are looking for ways to take some of the sting out of these high energy prices which are punishing Australians and Australian industry and employers as well. Later today I\u2019ll be engaging with the manufacturing sector, in particular, and Australian industry more broadly. We will have more to say on our plans for the energy market by the end of the year. There\u2019s a lot of complexity here, there are a lot of considerations to weigh up, we have made it very clear that we are interested in a temporary, meaningful, responsible, sensible intervention in the energy market to help to take the sting out of some of these high energy prices. We will have more to say about that before the end of the year. High energy prices are a consequence of Russian aggression and Coalition incompetence \u2013 those are the two factors which are feeding into these high and rising energy prices. The war in Ukraine is causing havoc with energy markets worldwide, we\u2019ve had a decade of denial and delay from our predecessors which has meant more energy capacity has come out of the system than gone in and that has made us more vulnerable to these international shocks, so we will do our best to deal with the consequences of Russian aggression and Coalition incompetence in our energy markets. Australians and Australian industry are paying a hefty price for that Russian aggression and that Coalition incompetence and we will do what we can to intervene in a temporary, meaningful, responsible, sensible way to see if we can take some of the sting out of that.   Updated at 9.51pm GMT    9.38pm    Snowy Hydro bonuses in spotlight The government will ask the Snowy Hydro boss for an explanation about how it gives bonus payments after it was revealed the company gave nearly $30m in bonuses to staff last year. In answers provided to the Senate, Snowy Hydro said it gave $29,631,371 through its \u201cincentive programs\u201d in the 2022 financial year, to 1,446 staff \u2013 an average of $20,492 for each employee. Greens senator Janet Rice asked Snowy Hydro at Senate estimates on 7 November about bonuses given to the entire staff of the company. In answers provided on notice, published on Monday, Snowy Hydro gave the 2022 and 2021 figures. The latest figures showed a nearly $5m boost to incentive payments over the two years. In 2021 financial year Snowy Hydro gave out $24,915,156 in bonus payments to 1,457 staff, an average of $17,100 each. Snowy Hydro said it had \u201csignificantly reduced the maximum incentive under the long-term incentive scheme\u201d and that no payments for long-term incentives had been made in the 2021 and 2022 financial year. The bonuses paid were under its \u201cshort-term incentive program\u201d in which all retail and generation staff take part. Guardian Australia understands the government has asked Snowy Hydro to undertake an external, independent analysis to give the government its rationale for remuneration policy decisions, as well as views about how the performance bonuses can be improved, and details about the performance targets. The government is also seeking to have Snowy Hydro\u2019s CEO placed into the remuneration tribunal\u2019s principal executive officer framework, which sets limits on remuneration and bonuses for office holders.  Updated at 9.45pm GMT    9.32pm    \u2018We had snow in Tassie about five days ago\u2019 Jacqui Lambie also had some thoughts about the \u201cnuts\u201d weather the east coast is experiencing at the moment.  We had snow in Tassie about five days ago. It\u2019s still sitting there. It\u2019s amazing. In Canberra usually this time of year you are sweating at six in the morning. It\u2019s so bizarre what\u2019s going on. And then in the meantime when flying over and when you\u2019re flying into places into Melbourne yesterday, with the change over coming to Canberra, you know, it\u2019s nice to see all their waterways are full. Their dams and all that stuff. Seriously, this time of year you don\u2019t see that. Let\u2019s just hope that means we\u2019re not going to get those disastrous bushfires over the summer period. Seriously, we also can\u2019t afford too much more rain. We certainly can\u2019t in Tasmania, for sure. We\u2019re at our peak in our dams and our waterways and our creeks and all the rest. Let\u2019s just hold back on that rain it will be good. Don\u2019t want to be doing that over summer either.   Updated at 9.41pm GMT    9.28pm    Lambie says IR bill should be split Jacqui Lambie told the Nine Network:  They\u2019ve [the Labor government] have done well in the first six months. Seriously, guys, we need to take a few steps back here from this IR bill. Split it with the good stuff. I would like to speak about it after Christmas [with small business]. Let small business get their head around them.  At this point (it is all subject to change) the bill only impacts businesses with fewer than 15 employees. And a majority of employees would have to vote to take part in any multi-employer bargaining move.  Updated at 9.32pm GMT    9.19pm    Buy now, pay later review has been coming for a while  The last time the issue was examined, under the previous government, it was decided the industry could regulate itself. But with no credit checks, and no limits to how many services people can sign up for, people, particularly those on low incomes and already financially vulnerable, ran into trouble. The government is now looking at treating BNPL schemes like credit. Which would mean credit checks and also take into account other credit lines someone has before being able to use a service.  Updated at 9.33pm GMT    9.08pm    Credit checks for buy now, pay later schemes Stephen Jones:  At a minimum, putting in in place some sort of credit checks to make sure the product is affordable and suitable for the people it is being pitched at. We don\u2019t want to see people in the same situation they were in the bad old days of the credit card and other parts of the credit card and other parts of the credit market where they might have had five, six, seven or eight credit cards, no one company knew the other had one and this person was simply unable to pay off their debts and they were in a credit downward spiral. That\u2019s what we want to address. We want innovation, we want people to have access to these great products but we want to ensure that there\u2019s proper guardrails in place.   Updated at 9.11pm GMT    9.07pm    \u2018It\u2019s operating outside the normal credit laws\u2019 Financial services minister Stephen Jones spoke about the buy now, pay later crackdown on the Nine network this morning. The government is looking at regulation:  We\u2019ve heard lots of stories, which is why we want to get some evidence. We\u2019ve heard stories about people saying, \u201cThis is a great innovation, enables me to use my phone like a credit card.\u201d But therein lies the trap, it is not a credit card, it\u2019s operating outside the normal credit laws and a lot of people are getting into hot water. The number that surprised me, there\u2019s only 7m buy now, pay later accounts in Australia, most of them for people between the ages of 20 and 35. The thing is, though, a lot of people have got not one, not two but three or four buy now, pay later accounts and it appears that there is a small percentage of the market where people are getting into hot water. We want to ensure that this product is operating safely \u2013 safely, where it\u2019s being marketed, where it\u2019s being pitched at consumers, it is operating within the normal guardrails of other products.   Updated at 9.10pm GMT    8.58pm    Wells heads to Qatar for World Cup Minister for sport Anika Wells is off to Qatar for the World Cup. Yup.  I will be following the Men\u2019s World Cup keenly and cheering the Socceroos to glory.I will also be taking every opportunity to promote Australia co-hosting the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup to a global audience of football fans.The Australian Government is also committed to advancing human rights globally and Qatar\u2019s hosting of the FIFA World Cup has provided opportunities to promote meaningful reform in human rights which we hope will continue beyond the tournament.Major sporting events can be powerful influences for social and cultural change, and I hope that is the case with the FIFA Men\u2019s and Women\u2019s World Cups.    Updated at 9.05pm GMT    8.48pm    \u2018I expect that the Senate will sit additional hours\u2019 Will the Senate sit later, or for additional days? Well, the upper house is in charge of its own fate (meaning it would have to vote to agree to it), but Katy Gallagher says \u201cmaybe\u201d:  We are looking at extra hours or days in the Senate. Obviously, we can\u2019t do that on our own if we don\u2019t have the majority vote in the Senate. So we\u2019re negotiating again with the crossbench around that. I think that there is an acknowledgement that it is our job to sit and pass laws. We have a lot of laws to get through. And not a lot of time. So I expect that the Senate will sit additional hours. But that\u2019s all subject to negotiation, as is everything in the Senate. So there will be lots of that unfolding over the next few days.   Updated at 9.04pm GMT    8.44pm    Caffeine crisis? I have had a couple of messages from the early birds who work in parliament as they can\u2019t get food or coffee before 7.30am at the trough (the staff cafeteria where, yes, people pay for their food). There is a lot of outrage in the DMs.  Updated at 9.04pm GMT    8.40pm    \u2018A packed fortnight of legislation to get through\u2019 Asked about how the IR negotiations were going, Katy Gallagher says:  My understanding is that Tony Burke continues to talk to all members of the crossbench who are wanting to engage. It\u2019s coming to the Senate. We have a packed fortnight of legislation to get through and it will be a wild ride in the red chamber this fortnight, and looking at how to progress industrial relations is a key priority for the government. So Tony Burke will continue to talk, to negotiate. I know that the Senate committee will report this week. I think they\u2019ve got an additional hearing into that bill. Then they\u2019ll report and hopefully we\u2019ll be able to progress the bill in the second week. In the first week we\u2019ve got a whole lot of other legislation to get through.   Updated at 9.03pm GMT    8.38pm    Buy now, pay later in spotlight Finance minister Katy Gallagher told ABC News Breakfast this morning that it was time for the government to look at buy now, pay later schemes:  Well, I think we\u2019ve seen it emerge as a very popular option for people. Buy now, pay later \u2013 and that\u2019s a good thing. We want people to have choices. But I think we\u2019re also seeing certainly some pressure on people in terms of getting into serious trouble with schemes like this. So I think that it is responsible for the government to have a look at how to regulate it or how to put some guardrails around it, make sure that consumers are safe. And you know, people are starting to see it as a credit card. Whether or not it should be included under the credit card regulations, so under the credit code, to give people some protections and also put some responsibility back on the providers about ensuring that people are able to afford to get into the contracts that they\u2019re entering into.   Updated at 9.03pm GMT    8.35pm    \u2018Fairness has to be fought for,\u2019 PM to tell unions Anthony Albanese will start his morning with an address to the International Trade Union Confederation. It\u2019s a bit of here\u2019s what we\u2019ve done so far. And a bit of a warning.  In the past month, our government has introduced: New protections against sexual harassment. New measures to improve job security. New initiatives to revitalise bargaining, enhance productivity and get wages moving again. And a new focus on closing the gender pay gap. Now, of course, there are those who oppose these changes. Those who want to stand in the way of this progress. Those who have an ingrained ideological objection to workers being paid fairly for their contribution, who somehow believe that the only way to grow the economy is to limit opportunity and diminish security. We know there are always those who say that any improvement in workers pay, any improvement in the status quo, will see the sky fall in. They say it every time, they are wrong every time. And we will push ahead like we do, every time. We know fairness has to be fought for, we know progress has to be earned. Most of all we know it\u2019s worth it \u2013 we know the difference that it makes to people\u2019s lives is worth it.   Updated at 9.02pm GMT    8.25pm   Good morning  Welcome to the first day of the last sitting fortnight. Maybe. There is a chance the Senate will have to sit for another week to get through all the legislation the government wants to pass before the end of the year. Prime minister Anthony Albanese has given a little bit of leeway by saying if the government misses the end of the year deadline it set itself it is not the end of the world. It is the IR bill which is the sticking point. The government is still hoping it will get David Pocock over the line for the whole package. Those negotiations are ongoing, and Pocock doesn\u2019t want to be rushed \u2013 he has said several times that he wants to get it right. And that might mean waiting until the first sittings next year. Also on the agenda is the national anti-corruption commission bill, which, now it is back from the joint committee, is about to face a whole heap of amendments. The government has agreed not to rush the debate, or declare it urgent, and that amendments can be moved one by one rather than in blocks. Mark Dreyfus wants the Nacc to be something the whole parliament has had a say in so he is prepared to give a little \u2013 but it means it will also take some time. There is also the territory rights bill, which supporters want to bring to a vote while there is momentum. All in all, it will be a busy couple of weeks. In the Senate, the Greens are hoping to make it easier for people on jobseeker to earn a living wage by being able to increase their hours at work without a financial penalty to their social security.  And that\u2019s not counting all the stuff that just pops up. Katharine Murphy is back from the prime minister\u2019s summit season whirlwind, so she will be able to guide you through the final sitting, with Josh Butler, Paul Karp and Daniel Hurst. You\u2019ll have Amy Remeikis on the blog for most of the day. Mike Bowers is still covering the flood emergency in central western NSW and we will bring you those updates as well. I am already on my third coffee. It is going to be that sort of week. But it has been that sort of year, so it tracks. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.  Updated at 8.28pm GMT "

                    "body": "Sacramento, as a city, has always had a chip on its shoulder. Despite the 2.5 million residents in its greater metropolitan area and its status as the capital of California, it has long been overshadowed by the likes of the Bay Area\u2019s Silicon Valley and Los Angeles. That dynamic inevitably spills over to sports, where its soccer team, Sacramento Republic of the second-tier USL, was infamously spurned last year by Major League Soccer only 17 months after it was very publicly awarded an expansion slot. Off the field, there wasn\u2019t much the organization could do about it. But on it, the players are still hoping to have the last say.  \u201cI\u2019m sure (the MLS) didn\u2019t want us to win,\u201d Republic captain Rodrigo Lopez said in June after Sacramento beat the biggest team in MLS, the LA Galaxy, in the quarter-final of the US Open Cup, the nation\u2019s oldest single-elimination tournament. On Wednesday, he and his teammates travel to Florida to take on another MLS side, Orlando City SC in the final of that competition. The odds will continue to be against them. No lower-tier team in the country has made it this far since 2008, and before that, no such side has managed to win it since 1999. En route to the final, Sacramento had to beat three MLS teams in a row, including their aforementioned California neighbors. That sort of run has many in the city now rallying around a play on a conventional saying: if you can\u2019t join them, beat them. Except, it\u2019s easy to say that after the fact. Less than six months ago, when Republic kicked off their 2022 campaign, no one would have imagined that they would make it this far, especially so soon.  After seeing their team limp to a near last-place finish after the MLS expansion debacle, team president Todd Dunivant and head coach Mark Briggs let over 20 first-team players depart the club and brought in an equal amount of new faces in one offseason window. \u201cI only had five names (returning) on my board at the start of the season,\u201d Briggs said, reflecting on what it was like to assemble a brand-new squad. \u201cYou look around at the other teams at the top of our league and that just doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d Working within the constraints of being a lower-tier club, the two former players \u2013 Dunivant a decorated champion in the US and Briggs an English journeyman \u2013 had to be shrewd with their recruiting. They couldn\u2019t just spend more to improve, so they focused instead on being deliberate. \u201cWe felt like we were missing some leadership in the group last year,\u201d Dunivant said. In addition to utilizing more data and analytics to identify \u201cwinning\u201d type players that might not stand out to the naked eye, he said that he and Briggs wanted to build a more unified dressing room. \u201cThe big key to our current run has been bringing in the right guys with certain personality traits.\u201d \u201cTogetherness\u201d, \u201cprotect your teammate\u201d and \u201clean on one another\u201d are phrases that are commonly heard at Sacramento\u2019s training sessions these days. They can be clich\u00e9 values that every coach likes to espouse and preach, but here, they\u2019ve been empirically tested. \u201cFortunately for me \u2026 we started getting results, which generated more energy within the group and created even more buy-in,\u201d Briggs said when asked how his team of 11 new starters was able to gel so quickly in time for a special cup run.  Before the cup run garnered them more attention, his team had been in the middle of the pack in USL. There was no reason to pick them out of the lineup as some exemplary lower-tier side. But now, everyone around him is suddenly asking him for secrets of the trade. \u201cYes, you need to have a clear idea of what you want to do as a team, but in our game, you need a bit of luck too,\u201d Briggs said. It is not lost on him that magical runs like Sacramento\u2019s or say, Leicester City winning the English Premier League in 2016 are anomalies for a reason. But neither is the enormity of the moment which he said is \u201ca dream come true\u201d. When Republic kick off against Orlando on Wednesday, they will be playing arguably the biggest game in Sacramento sports history. That\u2019s not just hyperbole. The only other major sports team in town, the Sacramento Kings of the NBA, have not made the postseason in over 16 years, nor have they ever come as close as the Republic have to winning a trophy. To mark the occasion, Republic\u2019s ownership group is flying the entire staff to Orlando for the first time in team history. While in Sacramento, even the politicians have organized a massive watch party downtown for the game. Before he departed for Florida, Lopez had cooled on his bold call-outs of MLS. The club talisman is still Republic\u2019s most influential player at the age of 35, scoring in each of the teams\u2019 three wins over MLS opposition. After his career almost ended a decade ago, he is trying to keep things in perspective. He knows that things like multi-million dollar expansion fees or the introduction of promotion and relegation in American soccer are outside of his and the fans\u2019 control. \u201cWherever we end up, whether that\u2019s MLS or USL, I know we\u2019ll still be important in this city,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cOur fans remained passionate and never stopped believing through the worst.\u201d \u201cWe have to do it for them.\u201d  This article was amended on 7 September 2022 to clarify that the figure given for Sacramento\u2019s population relates to the city\u2019s greater metropolitan area.

                    "body": "A former Birmingham coach found to have used homophobic language towards Tottenham\u2019s manager, Rehanne Skinner, during a Women\u2019s Super League match in February has been given a seven-match touchline ban. Marcus Bignot, who was the assistant manager of Birmingham at the time of the incident on 13 February, was charged with misconduct by the Football Association in March, which he denied.\nThe FA confirmed on Thursday that an independent regulatory commission had found the charge to be proven after a two-day hearing in May. Bignot has also been ordered to attend a face-to-face education course. \n\nBirmingham said on Thursday that they had \u201cnow terminated his agreement and will no longer be using his services\u201d. He had been suspended by the club in March.\nThe commission found it proven that Bignot had said to Skinner, after an incident in the 17th minute of the match: \u201cMaybe if you had a bit of prick in you and in your life, then maybe you\u2019d be better for it and at your job.\u201d\nThe FA\u2019s position was that this comment was homophobic as he was aware of Skinner\u2019s sexuality. This was denied by Bignot, who said he was oblivious to her sexuality even though Skinner\u2019s partner was a former Birmingham player.\nThe commission determined that it was \u201cnot credible\u201d that Bignot was unaware of Skinner\u2019s sexuality. The commission heard from a number of witnesses to the incident among the Tottenham staff, who it found \u201ccredible, compelling and articulate\u201d and dismissed a claim by Bignot\u2019s legal team that they had colluded to incriminate him.\nIt decided that \u201con the balance of probabilities\u201d Bignot had made the comment. The commission\u2019s written reasons stated: \u201cThe regulatory commission are not concerned with the question whether Mr Bignot is homophobic, nor does it make any finding of such.\n\u201cHe has been found to have made a comment which was obviously homophobic and wholly unacceptable. It is particularly important that homophobic comment, the kind made by Mr Bignot, is punished severely.\u201d\n\nThe commission was informed that Bignot had lost his job at Birmingham because of the case and been suspended from a role as an England Under-19s coach.\nBirmingham said: \u201cBirmingham City Women can confirm that Marcus Bignot has left the football club. This follows the outcome of an investigation carried out by The Football Association in relation to a breach of FA Rule E3 following our Barclays FA Women\u2019s Super League fixture against Tottenham Hotspur Women on Sunday 13 February.\u201d\nThey said the club \u201cstrongly condemn any form of homophobic abuse and reiterate our aim to confront and eliminate any form of discrimination\u201d."

                    "body": "  5.38pm    Right, I\u2019m going to wrap this blog up now but there is just one last bit of news breaking before I go. Kevin Thelwell has been appointed as Everton\u2019s new director of football, filling the vacancy left when the club parted ways with Marcel Brands.  This is from Everton\u2019s website:   Currently Head of Sport at New York Red Bulls, who he joined in February 2020, Thelwell was Sporting Director at Wolverhampton Wanderers between 2016 and 2020, and was previously the Midlands club\u2019s Head of Football Development and Recruitment between 2013 and 2016. With a glowing reputation for developing young talent, Thelwell guided New York Red Bulls into the MLS Cup Playoffs in 2020 with the youngest roster in the MLS. As Sporting Director at Wolverhampton Wanderers and previously Head of Football Development and Recruitment, Thelwell orchestrated Wolves\u2019 rise from League One in 2013/14 to qualification for the Europa League in 2019/20, identifying and recruiting players like Diogo Jota, Ruben Neves, Adama Traore, Leander Dendoncker and Conor Coady.  Everton fans are also planning a show of solidarity with Ukraine tomorrow, as I\u2019m sure many football fans around the world will do. Thanks for reading today. Have a good weekend and stay safe.      5.24pm    Frank Lampard\u2019s Everton\u2122 could be in the relegation zone before they kick a ball against Manchester City tomorrow evening \u2013 but the Blues\u2019 boss is not going to panic:    It\u2019s difficult to beat Manchester City. We can\u2019t put all our eggs in the basket of this game being a game-changer completely as there are a lot of games left. There is a lot of football to be played, against teams around us and teams we have games in hand on. These next two games [Everton go to Tottenham a week on Monday] are going to be difficult but I still won\u2019t change my mindset, whether we get positive results or not. There is a long way to go. What I do want to see is belief from the players that we can go toe-to-toe with anyone.  Some good news for Lampard is that he will have Demarai Gray (hip) and Abdoulaye Doucoure (groin) back in his squad. Doucoure has not been fit since Lampard took the job and is such an important player in midfield.  Updated at 5.26pm GMT    5.18pm    The Fiver has landed \u2013 and it\u2019s well worth a read:       5.05pm    If it\u2019s an interview with J\u00fcrgen Klopp that you want, this should satisfy your needs. Andy Hunter speaks to Liverpool\u2019s manager about why Wembley is sung as \u201cWem-ber-lee\u201d, his desire to win more trophies with his Liverpool team and his preference for wearing swim-shorts over a suit. (Note: this doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s going to stroll out wearing a pair of trunks in London on Sunday).  And here\u2019s Andy\u2019s team news before the big match:   Updated at 5.07pm GMT    5.01pm    Get all the team news before the weekend\u2019s Premier League matches here. And if you like quizzes, give this one a go:       4.56pm    Some big news out of Luton now, with the Hatters revealing that \u201cvastly experienced\u201d is a handy synonym for \u201c34-year-old\u201d.       4.48pm    Brazil manager Tite has told Brazilian channel SporTV that he will leave his role after the 2022 World Cup. The 60-year-old took the job in June 2016 when the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o were struggling under Dunga, who had failed to revitalise them after the 2014 World Cup. Brazil are unbeaten in 2022 World Cup qualifying and won the Copa Am\u00e9rica under Tite in 2019. Arguably his most memorable Brazil moment, though, is that time he went for a run.      4.32pm    Jordan Henderson is the only survivor from Liverpool\u2019s last League Cup final victory, when he helped beat Cardiff to win the trophy as a 21-year-old with Kenny Dalglish in charge in 2012. The Reds captain reckons victory could fuel his side\u2019s assault on the other three competitions they are still involved in.   To get a trophy so early on in the season can give the squad a big boost. It\u2019s a cup final and one we want to win so we\u2019ll do absolutely everything to make sure we bring the trophy home. We want to use it as a platform to give us a big confidence boost going towards the business end of the season. There are some big games coming up \u2026 Yes we are still in all four but that can change very quickly. Sunday, whether we win or not, that\u2019s done.       4.27pm    The only player (male or female) to have played in seven World Cups and seven Olympics, Formiga, is still playing football for S\u00e3o Paulo at 43. Here the Brazil legendary Brazil midfielder talks to J\u00falia Belas Trindade about finding her voice off the pitch and what must be done to fight racism and sexism in the game:      4.18pm    There\u2019s a big derby on Sunday when Manchester United host Manchester City in the Women\u2019s FA Cup fifth round. The two sides met just over a week ago in the WSL and on that occasion City edged the match 1-0 to dent their rivals\u2019 outside title chances. United manager Marc Skinner believes that defeat is just the motivation they need to get one over on City in the cup.   I\u2019ve said to the players to feel [the pain of defeat]. Feel it because it is fuel. It is really important that we put ourselves in a position where we learn from it, and then that fuels you because you don\u2019t want to feel like that again.  Women\u2019s FA Cup fixtures Saturday 26 FebruaryChelsea v Leicester City (1pm) Sunday 27 FebruaryLiverpool v Arsenal (noon)Manchester City v United (12.30pm)Charlton v Everton (1pm)Durham v Birmingham City (2pm)Reading v West Ham United (2pm)West Bromwich Albion v Coventry United (2pm)Ipswich Town v Southampton (2pm)  Updated at 4.18pm GMT    4.09pm    Steven Gerrard reckons a win would be just the \u201cmedicine\u201d Aston Villa need after after their recent blip in form but he cautioned that beating Brighton is not a cure for all their ills. Villa have won just one their last seven matches and Gerrard hopes he find the solution to get his players back on track:   Our form of late needs improving. We\u2019re all aware of that, no one more than myself, and Brighton gives us the opportunity to bounce back. A good win here is the medicine we all need right now. Our form\u2019s dropped, we admit that and take that on the chin but this wasn\u2019t a job that was going to be sorted in 12, 13, 14 games. We knew that there was still a gap where we needed to get to and where we want to take the team to, that doesn\u2019t change. If we go and win three on the spin, we know this is a long-term thing we need to improve.  He just needs to stick this on full blast in the dressing room doesn\u2019t he?       3.56pm    The only time Liverpool and Chelsea have met in the League Cup final was 2005, when Jos\u00e9 Mourinho won the first trophy of the Roman Abramovich-era. It was a cracking match that Chelsea won 3-2 in extra-time. If you have a spare two hours, the EFL have the entire game for you to watch here. I miss Cardiff for cup finals:       3.45pm   Uefa in talks over ending relationship with Gazprom  Uefa is in discussions with its lawyers over ending the governing body\u2019s longstanding relationship with Gazprom, a sponsor since 2012, after confirming that this season\u2019s men\u2019s Champions League final has been moved from St Petersburg to Paris.   Updated at 3.47pm GMT    3.37pm    There was a shocking story in Brazil overnight that some of you may have missed among the news elsewhere. Brazilian second tier club Bahia said at least three of their players were injured by a homemade explosive that detonated inside the team\u2019s bus on its way to a match the club later won. The goalkeeper Danilo Fernandes had to go to hospital due to shattered glass in his face and left-back Matheus Bahia and forward Marcelo Cirino were also hurt. Bahia posted pictures of blood on bus seats and another showing a large hole in one of the windows. The team played Sampaio Correia in a Copa do Nordeste match and, remarkably, won 2-0, a result that players barely celebrated.  Bahia coach Guto Ferreira told media the team decided to play the match \u201cbecause of its dignity and its professionalism.\u201d Bahia state police said in a statement they are investigating the incident.     3.25pm    So, how does David Moyes feel about West Ham drawing the record six-times Uefa Cup/Europa League winners in the last 16?   I think it\u2019s the pick of the round. Sevilla have been unbelievable in winning the competition. They\u2019re probably the form side in Spain after Real Madrid at the moment. It\u2019s a really tough game, but we want to test ourselves against the best. It would be good to get used to the stadium if we could go back there for the final! I was looking forward to the prospect of going to Rangers, but great credit to them for getting through against Dortmund. We\u2019ve played well in Europe and we\u2019ll take a big support to Seville and really look forward to it. There is more pressure on them than there is on us because we\u2019re new to it.\u201d   Of course, Moyes has history of managing in La Liga, with Real Sociedad, for a year in 2014-15. I still can\u2019t forget the size of the picture of him on the board behind him when he faced the press there. Extraordinary.    Updated at 3.25pm GMT    3.11pm    More from Tuchel now, who is asked about Romelu Lukaku, he of the seven touches. It doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s itching to start him against Liverpool:   He played a lot of matches. We had a similar situation with Jorginho, one of our captains, because we feel him a little mentally tired. The focus on Romelu that I understand but it\u2019s a similar situation as Jorginho. The decisions are made clear and the players accept [them]. Once you play for Chelsea, you accept the team goes first and that\u2019s why there are no hard feelings, not from Romelu or from me.  Tuchel would not confirm if, like J\u00fcrgen Klopp, he would continue to play his second-choice goalkeeper ahead of his first-choice one in the Carabao Cup: \u201cI will not tell you. I will take the decision late. Kepa played in the Club World Cup semi-final and brought us to the final but then we took the decision to go with Mendy (\u00c9douard Mendy) for the final, who was back from the African Cup of Nations. The last decision we will take after training as always. Kepa did fantastic in the period that we had to be without Mendy, so it\u2019s an uncomfortable and very comfortable situation to be in.\u201d And on the situation in Ukraine and if Uefa had made the right call by stripping Russia of the Champions League final: \u201cYes a clear yes, but sadly it is the worst reason to change location, the absolutely worst reason we feel horrible about it in general it clouds our minds and it clouds our focus of course and we can absolutely understand the decision. There are things more important and the focus from us in sport and globally speaking is not on the final.\u201d  Updated at 3.12pm GMT    3.00pm    Ralf Rangnick is anxiously looking over his shoulder at Arsenal and is aware that Manchester United must keep their focus fully on Watford before a huge month ahead for the club. They face Atl\u00e9tico in the second leg of their last 16 Champions League tie, as well as Premier League trips to Liverpool and Manchester City in March.  \u201cWe have to keep the momentum, win tomorrow against Watford and then be ready for the upcoming games afterwards against the top teams,\u201d said Rangnick. \u201cIt only makes sense to take it one game after the other. Now the job is to fully recover from the game the day before yesterday and play on the highest possible level at home and hopefully win the game. Then we have a normal week to prepare for the derby at Manchester City.\u201d United will be without midfielder Scott McTominay, who is ill, and Edinson Cavani (groin).   Updated at 3.02pm GMT    2.51pm   Tuchel may be \u2018crazy enough\u2019 to play James  Thomas Tuchel has been previewing the Carabao Cup final and he\u2019s feeling like he might be wild enough to throw the fit-again Reece James straight back in against Liverpool. The wing-back has finally beaten the hamstring tear that has kept him out since 29 December and Chelsea haven\u2019t really been the same without him or Ben Chilwell, who is out for the rest of the season.    He looked brilliant in the last two training sessions, let\u2019s wait another session, and then let\u2019s see if I\u2019m crazy enough to just put him on the pitch or if the reasonable side of me wins in the end and we go for step by step. It would be a huge step, but honestly yesterday and today he looked so strong, so confident, and so, so involved in training that you are tempted to do it. Let\u2019s see, we have a little bit of time, and the most important [thing] for him and for us is that he\u2019s back and that he feels so confident that he can step up to the kind of level he did yesterday and today.      2.41pm    Here is some more from Guardiola on his Ukrainian full-back Oleksandr Zinchenko, who is available for Manchester City\u2019s Premier League match at Everton on Saturday and has the club\u2019s full support amid the crisis in his home country.  He is worried. What would we feel if in our country where we were born and have family and friends innocent people are being killed? How will you feel? I guess that\u2019s what he feels. Of course, the team and the club is close to him, unconditionally of course. Oleks is an incredible, strong guy, really, really. Of course it\u2019s not easy at the moment but playing in the training session yesterday he was brilliant so he\u2019s ready to play in case he has to play.  Guardiola confirmed that Zinchenko attended a demonstration in Manchester city centre on Thursday evening following the invasion of his home country by Russian forces.     2.30pm   Conte: 'The problem is I am a perfectionist'  For a while on Wednesday evening it looked like Antonio Conte might not be in the Tottenham job much longer. The Italian cast doubt over his future when he suggested he was not \u201cgood enough\u201d to fix Spurs\u2019 problems following the midweek defeat to Burnley \u2013 the fourth loss in five games \u2013 and the club would have to make an assessment. But today Conte has committed himself to Tottenham and acknowledged that he is prone to tempestuous outbursts.    Our chairman Daniel Levy knows very well I am here to help the club and we will help the club until the end. This is the reality, he knows this and he knows that we are working very hard. The club is very happy with my work, what I am doing with my staff. I am sure the club appreciates what we are doing. The problem is I am a perfectionist. When I lose I don\u2019t stay so happy, this has helped me have success in my career. When I lose a game my mood is very bad and I prefer to stay alone and live the defeat, to stay alone and metabolise the defeat. I need one day to recover at least. This is me. It is me. I don\u2019t like to lose. If you ask me what I hate in life it is to lose games.   Updated at 2.32pm GMT    2.20pm   Eriksen 'will get on the pitch tomorrow'  Brentford manager Thomas Frank has confirmed that Christian Eriksen will make his return to competitive football for Brentford against Newcastle tomorrow, nine months after his on-pitch cardiac arrest at Euro 2020. It\u2019s a moment many of us never imagined would happen but Eriksen\u2019s desire to play again has been nothing short of remarkable. Here\u2019s what Frank had to say:   Christian will be in the squad and he will get on the pitch tomorrow. It is a big day for all of us, but especially Christian and his family. When is he in training, it is really remarkable the things he has been doing.  The Denmark international has impressed on his return to action in friendlies, with a couple of appearances in behind-closed-doors fixtures. Rules in Italy would not allow Eriksen \u2013 who revealed last month he had \u201cdied for five minutes\u201d after his collapse - to play after having an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) device fitted.     2.10pm   Firmino ruled out of Carabao Cup final  More from Lijnders. Roberto Firmino is out of the Carabao Cup final but Diogo Jota may feature. \u201cFirmino we have to see in the next two days [how he is] but he will not be available for the final. Jota, so far there has been no reaction with what he did, which is a good sign. He is not ruled out but it will be a challenge.\u201d Lijnders then talks about the pathway for young players to progress and achieve things for Liverpool in the first team.   Kelleher is a really good example; him reaching the final it shows that there\u2019s an inside path for young goalkeepers at the club. A compliment for the goalkeeping department, that is what I like that it\u2019s possible a young keeper can make the final. It\u2019s nice to see.   Updated at 2.21pm GMT    2.05pm    Thanks John. Liverpool assistant manager Pep Lijnders has just arrived to face the media to preview the Carabao Cup final. He\u2019ll be joined by Jordan Henderson at some point. Before addressing football matters, Lijnders replies to a question about the Russian invasion of Ukraine.    I\u2019m a father, I\u2019m a son, I\u2019m a brother, I\u2019m a husband. It\u2019s really frightening. This war is a true disappointment for humankind.      1.59pm    Right, time to hand back to Gregg to take the blog through the afternoon.      1.44pm    David Moyes on West Ham Ukrainian winger Andriy Yarmolenko, who has been given time off by the club.   He\u2019s not in a very good position at the moment. We\u2019ve given him a few days off. We\u2019ll do all we can to help him, it\u2019s a really difficult time for him and his family. I spoke with him yesterday and he was upset, which you can imagine. We just hope his family keep safe.      1.39pm    A snippet from Pep Guardiola\u2019s press conference, ahead of Manchester City\u2019s game with Everton, with Oleks Zinchenko the focus of questioning.  Further details to follow.        1.36pm    The Wolves manager, Bruno Lage, has been speaking after last night\u2019s loss to Arsenal and ahead of his team\u2019s home match with West Ham on Sunday. Wolves, in conceding late, blew a chance to make inroads on the race for the top four.   When you see what happened in the last four or five days: we beat Tottenham, Tottenham had beat Man City and after Burnley beat Tottenham. That\u2019s why here in the Premier League every game is a hard game to win and that\u2019s why here we we need to prepare the game every time in the best way. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important, in my opinion, we need to continue to play like we played against Arsenal. So people can dream about that and what I can promise them is we will continue to work in that way, it is to play now against West Ham in the same way we played here, to create chances but to score the goals. If we beat Arsenal we have 43 points and in the end, in added-time, we don\u2019t have any points. That is why, here, it is so hard to predict anything. The only thing we can control is that we need to continue to work and then give confidence for people to believe in us. It was a very important game. I think in that moment, we did our best performance in October and November. It was very good for us, that was a good victory because we played very well in that game. In that moment they were doing very well, like now it is our moment to be doing very well and that is why, in football, it is so crazy.       1.07pm    Another monument to Sir Alex Ferguson, unveiled by the great man himself at Pittodrie to celebrate the amazing job he did with Aberdeen.       12.35pm   Manchester United cancel Aeroflot sponsorship  A United spokesperson said:  In light of events in Ukraine, we have withdrawn Aeroflot\u2019s sponsorship rights. We share the concerns of our fans around the world and extend our sympathies to those affected.  Aeroflot have been sponsor of United since 2013, the club and airline company signed an agreement to extend the sponsorship in 2017.

Seeded teams:  AZ Alkmaar Copenhagen Gent Roma Basel Feyenoord LASK Rennes  Unseeded teams:  Bodo/Glimt Marseille PAOK Slavia Prague Leicester Partizan Belgrade PSV Eindhoven Vitesse      12.11pm    Altin Lala is the Tirana delegate. He won 79 caps for Albania, and played in Germany for Hannover and Bayern Munich II. He\u2019s picked Leicester City as a team he\u2019d like to see in the Albanian capital.   Altin Dod\u00eb Lala (born 18 November 1975) is an Albanian former professionalfootballer who played as a defensive midfielder and former manager. He spent his entire playing career in Germany and represented the Albania national football team.      12.07pm    Pedro Pinto is back in harness and that means it\u2019s time for the draw, after a video segue of the clubs still left in the competition, featuring some Prodigy-lite music. \u201cThe road to Tirana continues\u201d, says Pedro. On comes Giorgio Marchetti, who expresses solidarity with the Ukrainian people and then sings the praises of the Conference League.      11.59am    Right, I\u2019m going to grab some lunch but John Brewin will guide you through the lunchtime football news and the Europa Conference League draw, which is due to start shortly. I\u2019ll be back later. Here\u2019s a reminder of the teams that are involved in a tournament you all care deeply about:       11.55am    After shipping 10 goals in four days, it\u2019s little wonder Marcelo Bielsa says he is \u201cvery worried\u201d by Leeds\u2019 form. But El Loco says he will not change his footballing philosophy. Leeds have slipped to within three points of the relegation zone after a run of four defeats from their last five games and resembled a naive boxer walking on to punch after punch in the 6-0 thrashing at Anfield. Bielsa \u2013 and his translator \u2013 have been speaking before the upcoming match against Spurs \u2013 and an on the boil Antonio Conte \u2013 at Elland Road (12.30pm on Saturday).  [I am] very worried. The worry is proportional to the results that we\u2019ve obtained. I am used to living through these situations. In these four years, I have received criticisms or demands that are exactly the same. In this case they are a lot more justified as the consequences of what\u2019s being done badly are a lot bigger. But they are the same problems that at some point we have already suffered and we were able to overcome. In moments like this when the confidence is lost in [the manager], which is natural and logical, how can I defend myself with a team that has conceded the most goals in the Premier League? I daily try to resolve it. As I reiterate, when you are the conductor in a bad situation, nobody trusts in what you say. What I am also sure of is that, if I stop doing what I believe in, which is what you are asking me, the situation instead of improving is going to be even worse. Of one thing I am convinced, what I will try is to do what we do but better. These players have already demonstrated they have the level to play in the Premier League. The style, the model has already shown it can work in the Premier League.  He really does need to try and tighten up at the back though doesn\u2019t he?   Updated at 11.56am GMT    11.47am    J\u00fcrgen Klopp is going to stick to his word and start with Caoimh\u00edn Kelleher in goal for Liverpool instead of Alisson Becker in the Carabao Cup final against Chelsea. How do you feel about this Liverpool fans? Personally, I think it\u2019s a smart move that will help Klopp keep hold of a high quality second-choice goalkeeper for a little longer. Here\u2019s Andy Hunter\u2019s profile on the young stopper from Cork who used to be a striker:   Updated at 11.48am GMT    11.44am    Sid Lowe gets his pun on:       11.42am    One of the more surprising football stories of the past few days was the return to management of Mark Hughes \u2026 at League Two Bradford City. In case you missed it, Aaron Bower followed the story of how it came to be that Hughes\u2019s email was fished out of Bantams CEO Ryan Sparks\u2019 junk email and resulted in the former Manchester United striker being appointed.       11.31am    West Ham fans have got a huge tie there. They will be the underdogs for sure, given Sevilla\u2019s fine form in La Liga. They trail leaders Real Madrid by six points and are the only real side pushing Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s side for the title. The first legs of all the ties are scheduled for 10 March, though the first legs of Porto v Lyon and Betis v Eintracht will be on Wednesday 9 March to avoid a clash with Braga and Sevilla, respectively. The second legs take place on 17 March.     11.24am   The Europa League last 16 draw in full  Rangers v Crvena Zvezda (Red Star Belgrade)Braga v MonacoPorto v LyonAtalanta v Bayer LeverkusenSevilla v West HamBarcelona v GalatasarayLeipzig v Spartak MoscowReal Betis v Eintracht Frankfurt  Updated at 11.32am GMT    11.23am    Completing the draw it\u2019s Real Betis v Eintracht Frankfurt. Betis will hope to get to the final to play in their home city too \u2013 though they might would be playing on their hated rival\u2019s ground.      11.21am    Leipzig v Spartak Moscow. So Spartak will have to play their home leg on neutral ground.      11.21am    It\u2019s Barcelona v Galatasaray!      11.20am    It\u2019s Sevilla v West Ham! What a tie for the Hammers. They face the record six-times winners who will hope to get to the final so they can play it in their home city.      11.19am    Now we have: Atalanta v Bayer Leverkusen. Gian Piero Gasperini\u2019s side are a decent shout to go all the way aren\u2019t they?      11.18am    It\u2019s Porto v Lyon. Porto, of course, were knocked out of the Champions League in dramatic fashion by Atl\u00e9tico Madrid.      11.16am    Next up is: Braga v Monaco     11.15am    The first tie out of the pot is: Rangers v Crvena Zvezda. That\u2019s Red Star Belgrade in old money.      11.13am    Uefa will hope this draw goes better than the Champions League round of 16 one, which it made a right mess of in December.   Updated at 11.13am GMT    11.11am    Former goalkeeper Andr\u00e9s Palop, who won the Uefa Cup three times with Sevilla and Valencia, is going to help pluck the balls out of the pot. (Insert your own safe pair of hands gag here). The Europa League final is in Seville, hence the link with Palop.      11.07am    Uefa general secretary Giorgio Marchetti is introducing us all to the draw and he takes time to express his solidarity with the people of Ukraine.      11.03am    It\u2019s almost time for the Europa League draw. A reminder, too, that the Conference League draw will follow it at noon. What? You forgot about the Conference League. How dare you. Leicester and Roma will be in the bag for that one and could face each other.      10.58am    Brighton have struggled of late after a fine start to the season in which they were in the top four for a number of weeks. They shouldn\u2019t have any relegation concerns given they have already got 33 points to sleep comfortably on at night. The Seagulls, who have won only one of their last six games, face Aston Villa, who have hit a similarly sticky patch with just one win in seven, and Graham Potter reckons his side\u2019s slump shows how tough the Premier League is. Richard Masters will love these Potter quotes:   Apart from the top three, getting points in this league consistently is very, very difficult. Previous to the Burnley game we have had some good performances. We are Brighton and Hove Albion, we have no divine right to win in the Premier League. There are bigger and better clubs than us suffering for points as well. The margins you need in this league haven\u2019t gone our way. Apart from the top three, who hasn\u2019t struggled? It is the best league in the world and it is difficult to get points. You can see what Villa are trying to do, you can see the performances, the structure of the team, on another day they could have won the games they lost. But the margins of this competition, this is the highest level of football in the world, so by definition it is not easy to win.      10.48am    After making a bright start to life in the Premier League, Brentford have slipped down the table after an awful run of form, suffering six defeats and one draw in their last seven league games. Some good news for the Bees is that Christian Eriksen has been in fine form in friendly games he has played in the past fortnight and might be ready to make a remarkable return to competitive action after his on-pitch cardiac arrest at Euro 2020. The Bees play 17th-placed Newcastle, who are only two points behind them with two games in hand, and their manager, Eddie Howe, would love to see Eriksen back on the pitch.   I was watching the game where he collapsed and my thoughts and prayers were with him and his family hoping that he made a healthy recovery from that really tough situation, and thank God he has. It would be great to see him back on a football pitch. From our side, during the game, we can have no emotion towards that, we all have to concentrate on our jobs. But certainly it\u2019s great to see him fit and healthy and enjoying his football again.  Howe will make a late call on Allan Saint-Maximin\u2019s fitness after sending him to Monaco for intensive treatment.     10.36am    Here\u2019s a reminder of the remaining teams in the Europa League:  Seeded teams Red Star Belgrade (SRB)Eintracht Frankfurt (GER)Galatasaray (TUR)Leverkusen (GER)Lyon (FRA)Monaco (FRA)Spartak Moskow (RUS)West Ham (ENG) Unseeded teams Atalanta (ITA)Barcelona (ESP)Betis (ESP)Braga (POR) Leipzig (GER)Porto (POR)Rangers (SCO)Sevilla (ESP) Spartak will have to play their home game at a neutral ground after Uefa said that Ukraine\u2019s and Russia\u2019s national and club teams will play outside their home nations \u201cuntil further notice\u201d.     10.26am   Good morning!  Welcome to our live Friday blog, in which we count down to the weekend\u2019s action and keep you up to speed with all the latest news in the world of football. There has been some early breaking \u2013 and not unexpected \u2013 news this morning as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has prompted Uefa to strip St Petersburg of the Champions League final. European club football\u2019s showpiece event on Saturday 28 May will now be played at the Stade de France. You can read more about that here:   Away from the troubling conflict in Ukraine, we have the Europa League round of 16 draw at 11am GMT. Rangers are in the pot for that after their mighty impressive 6-4 aggregate defeat of Dortmund on Thursday night.  There\u2019s the small matter of the Carabao Cup final on Sunday as Chelsea and Liverpool clash at Wembley for the right to win English football\u2019s first trophy of the season. Will Romelu Lukaku play? How will Chelsea\u2019s defence nullify Liverpool\u2019s rampant frontline? We\u2019ll hear off Thomas Tuchel and J\u00fcrgen Klopp today.  And the Premier League continues apace this weekend, too, with Manchester City looking to extend their lead over Liverpool to six points again when they visit Everton. Will Antonio Conte simmer down after his midweek outburst after Spurs\u2019 defeat at Burnley? There are important matches in the race for the top four and the battle against relegation. Here is the full list of fixtures: FridaySouthampton v Norwich 8pm SaturdayLeeds v Spurs 12.30pmBrentford v Newcastle 3pmBrighton v Aston Villa 3pmCrystal Palace v Burnley 3pmMan Utd v Watford 3pmEverton v Man City 5.30pmSundayWest Ham v Wolves 2pm   Updated at 11.12am GMT "

Catch you in June.     9.35pm    And on that looming UAE match? \u201cNow the boys have to go back to their clubs and work hard,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cIt\u2019s dis we didn\u2019t qualify directly.\u201d Important to note that Australia will have back at least some of the players they were missing for part or all of this window including Tom Rogic, Aaron Mooy, Mat Leckie, Jackson Irvine and Jamie Maclaren.     9.33pm    And here he is, shouting over the noise of the heaving King Abdullah Sports City Stadium and flanked by strobing lights piercing through darkness. Moody, if you will. Did he get what he was looking for? \u201cI did get it,\u201d he says, \u201cThe young boys, Atkinson and Genreau, did very well. Jeggo stepped up, Stensness. We\u2019ve been creating depth as we\u2019re trying to win games and the depth is coming.\u201d On the offside ruling: \u201cWe haven\u2019t seemed to get any VAR decisions. I haven\u2019t seen it but I have heard it\u2019s very, very close. But at the end of the day another shit penalty, pretty disappointing.\u201d     9.23pm    Saudi, by virtue of this win and Japan\u2019s draw with Vietnam, has finished top of Group B, with Australia third ahead of Oman, China and Vietnam. Group A\u2019s automatic qualifiers are Iran and South Korea while the UAE, as we already know, are third. Few stats from the match while we wait for Arnold to speak.      9.11pm    May I be so bold as to predict the talking points from the Australian side? There will be a feeling the Socceroos were robbed by that first-half VAR decision, a legitimate claim based on the evidence and the length of time it took to decide Boyle had been off when he picked up the pass in midfield and ran away to score.  Shortly thereafter will follow renewed calls for Arnold\u2019s head. Do Football Australia make the tough decision now to appoint a new manager to lead them through the playoffs in the hope a change will offer bounce? Or do they stick with the man they appointed almost four years ago in good faith? My two cents? I won\u2019t comment on the latter, but on the VAR decision I will sympathise, but also venture that Jeggo should not have given away that pen.     9.03pm    The fact that Mat Ryan has effectively been Australia\u2019s player of this qualifying phase offers little confidence in the rest of those spots on the field. Those spots are being chopped and changed so much at the moment and the lack of overall cohesion has hurt this team.     9.01pm    For Australia, well. They must look to 7 June and that sudden-death playoff against the UAE. Based on this overall performance \u2013 here and against Japan last week \u2013 the Socceroos will be up against it. They have struggled to break down tough Asian defences and the UAE stopped them from doing so at the 2019 Asian Cup.     8.57pm   Full-time! Saudi Arabia 1-0 Australia  Australia embark on what will surely be one final passage of play but they don\u2019t get the chance because the referee is blowing his whistle to end this dead rubber. It has been a joyride for Saudi Arabia, who are riffing off the Jeddah crowd. They had already qualified for the World Cup but this is their homecoming.     8.55pm    90+3 min Al-Dawsari is found some inner energy since his penalty goal and almost scores at the death. He is in the box, takes a touch with his left boot and thwacks it on the full with his right. It takes a deflection off an Australian player.     8.52pm    90 min Five minutes of added time means five minutes of Saudi taking their time. Al-Owais stands back and looks at the ball at his feet for a bit before kicking it long to Abdulhamid.     8.49pm    87 min Al Buraikin has been carried off on a stretcher but hops straight off it when it reaches the touchline. Youngster Saud Abdulhamid takes his place.     8.45pm    83 min A deft through ball from Tilio has Al-Owais off his line in a moment of spark from Australia. But they are soon chasing again on the counter as Al-Dawsari pushes into the box in search of a second goal to put this fixture to bed. He does not manage it, but the crowd love it anywhere. This stadium must be full. Genreau takes his leave for Mitchel Duke who, at 31, is decidedly not one of the \u201ckids\u201d Arnold was talking about playing tonight.     8.40pm    79 min A Saudi ball in behind from Abdulaziz Al-Bishi eevades Stensness, who is turned in the area. The ever-present Al-Dawsari whips around in front of goal and takes a shot that would be a sure thing but for Mat Ryan. That is regulation from Ryan but it is also reflex, and the No 1 once against saves Australia\u2019s blushes.  Updated at 8.43pm BST    8.36pm    76 min D\u2019Agostino gets a cross in but Tambakti is alert to it and the centre-back ensures the danger is averted. Hrustic takes the subsequent corner, which he floats towards the back post. Al-Owais, leaps above the throng of bodies, sticks out a glove and punches it away.     8.33pm    72 min Australia plays down the right and Atkinson scoots in chase towards the byline. The ball is kept in but Boyle has fouled Al-Shahrani, just in time for Marco Tilio to make his entrance in place of Mabil, who has had a couple of bright moments but been otherwise relatively quiet.     8.29pm    68 mins Saudi are putting their foot on the accelerator now, hunting for another in front of a home crowd seemingly intent on recording their every move on their phones.       8.27pm   Goal! Saudi Arabia 1-0 Australia  65 min Al-Dawsari takes the spot kick and he does not miss. The ball is along the ground and tucks inside the right post. Ryan dives left. That\u2019s that.     8.23pm    62 min Turns out he is OK. But Australia are not, because Saudi have a penalty! Jimmy Jeggo, in as he skipped, clipped the ankles of Sami Al-Najei and the referee was quick to call it. VAR has a quick look but it will stand, and fair enough.     8.21pm    60 min Al-Owais looks to have pulled something on his way down from said leap and play is stopped as he is tended to. Another three-minute break ensues.     8.19pm    57 min A lovely Saudi through ball has Saudi on the move down the left flank and it almost ends in a goal. They are opening up those wide channels with ease now. Up the other end, Mabil sends a fizzer of a shot at Al-Owais\u2019s goal. The former has beaten Tambakti to cut inside and his flight on the ball forces the goalkeeper to leap and tip it over the bar.     8.13pm    53 min D\u2019Agostino for mine is deserving of this opportunity. A tough selection call, because keeping Fornaroli on may have helped discern how he fits in the set-up leading into the first playoff against the UAE in June. But D\u2019Agostino is in form and can perhaps help in transition against this Saudi defence. Boyle dives into a challenge and catches Al-Shahrani on his way through.     8.09pm    49 min On the note of forwards, they are missing a few, with Jamie Maclaren and Mat Leckie off getting married and avoiding another yellow card respectively. Saudi have a corner which amounts to little. They recycle. Al-Faraj takes a heavy touch but manages to hold onto the ball but possession is soon back with the Socceroos anyway.     8.06pm    46 min So, we all know what the main talking point will be post-match, regardless of what happens in the second half. But another might be around whether Fornaroli, hailed as the answer to Australia\u2019s attacking woes, is indeed the answer. Arnold may be wondering this too because he has replaced him with Nicholas D\u2019Agostino. What can the Melbourne Victory forward do?      7.53pm   Half-time! Saudi Arabia 0-0 Australia  45+4 min Well that was an interesting first 45. Australia should be a goal up but, apart from that disallowed goal, cannot land a shot on target. The Saudis are playing like a side who have already qualified.  Updated at 8.07pm BST    7.49pm    46 min There are four minutes of added time, which is also a little mystifying given the VAR decision alone took longer than this. On the field, Mohammed Al-Breik is toying with Aziz Behich. Atkinson is fighting his own battle against Mohamed Kanno, who can move.  Updated at 7.51pm BST    7.46pm    43 min Needless to say there will be a few minutes of stoppage-time added to this half. I have an updated report that the VAR actually took close to five minutes to make that decision. Here is a closer look at it:      7.43pm    40 mins This is patience on display here as Saudi build from the back and Firas Al-Buraikan threatens in the box. Possession is turned over and oh! The Socceroos might be onto something here! A defence-splitting pass releases Boyle at the halfway line and it was never in doubt. Terrible defending from the home side, but there is question around whether he was offside at the point of that initial pass. The VAR is taking a while, suggesting this might be one of those bee\u2019s dick offside calls. They are splitting pixels in the cave and it has now been almost four minutes. The crowd are getting restless. The coaches are getting frustrated. Boyle is laighing and high-fiving an opponent. But he will not be awarded his sixth international goal.  Updated at 7.46pm BST    7.34pm    32 min Australia have five shots, none on target, and one-third of possession, which sums up this half quite well so far in a way stats do not always. Saudi are content and comfortable to let their visitors play. Fornaroli is down under a challenge but dust himself off.     7.30pm    28 min Ajdin Hrustic, who was so good against Japan last week, has a free kick. It lofts up beautifully and is heading towards the top-left corner, but lands on the roof. Mabil opens up another channel, this time from left to right in the centre of the park and Boyle is onto it. Yet again an Australian attack ends with a shot which rolls marginally wide of the back post.     7.26pm    24 min Genreau darts down the left flank, an audacious move from his (slightly defensive) midfield role. Australia have been decent going forward. They are creating. They are not finishing, but the foundations are there to get something out of this game. They just need to tighten up around the midfield. The Saudi coach, Herv\u00e9 Renard, is offering his players some unorthodox gesticulations from his technical area.     7.22pm    20 min Atkinson does not have the easiest debut on his hands. The pace is a step up but not only that he is facing the likes of Al-Dawsari with Al-Shahrani. This pair love an overlap. Hrustic is released by Mat Ryan, and before you can blink Boyle is in the box and Fornaroli alert to the action, anticipating the next move. The next move does not eventuate.     7.18pm    17 mins Thus far the Saudis are still retaining possession and suffocating Australia. Al-Faraj is doing his best work with the least room. Boyle, meanwhile, is on a mazy run which, in the end, amounts to nothing.     7.15pm    13 min ALMOST goal. And it is the first real contribution from Atkinson, who opens up the field nicely. Boyle shows off with a cute backheel and a ball across the face of goal is very nearly converted by Awer Mabil but he does not quite have a handle on it.     7.12pm    10 min Hrustic finds Mabil and Behich is charging forward but the ball is out of play off a Saudi defender. Their two central defenders \u2013 Hassan Tambakti and Abdullah Madu \u2013 played no part at all in their last match. Salman Al-Faraj, the captain of both this team and Al-Hilal, looks to make moves but is dealt with by Sainsbury.  Updated at 7.15pm BST    7.09pm   We are away!  5 min Saudi Arabia have all the early possession as they string passes together and drive forward. Australia clean up a bit here though the passes are not being completed at this point. A Martin Boyle long ball is cleaned up by Mohammed Al-Owais.  Updated at 7.16pm BST    7.02pm    Here is how the teams line up. A couple of changes for Australia with Bruno Fornaroli making his first start for his new country and right-back Nathaniel Atkinson his overall debut. The latter has enjoyed an impressive few years with Melbourne City and recently joined Hearts. Rhyan Grant and Joel King step out Denis Genreau has his second cap alongside James Jeggo and Gianni Stensness, who played in midfield against, drops back to the centre of defence.      6.55pm   Preamble  \u201cWe are where we were four years ago.\u201d Graham Arnold said today from Jeddah. What he means is that Australia\u2019s Qatar 2022 fate is now in the hands of the dreaded playoffs, just as it was in the bid to qualify for Russia 2018. He means Asia and then South America. Why? Well, we have missed out on automatic qualification. Last week\u2019s 2-0 home loss to Japan ensured that. It also ensured more questions about Arnold\u2019s future as head coach and more pre- post mortems of the Socceroos\u2019 failure to qualify altogether, which has not even yet happened (though we do love a drama). Today\u2019s tie is against Saudi Arabia. It is a dead rubber. Australia will finish third in their group, and Japan and Saudi first and second, and that will not change regardless of the result. But Arnold offered another wise nugget today: he does not believe in dead rubbers. \u201cEspecially when you put on a national team shirt,\u201d he said. \u201cI said to the boys, \u2018I\u2019ve used 45 players over the last 17 games and we will add to that tonight\u2019. I would rather look at the positives. The positives are that we are creating depth. Today it\u2019s a clean sheet of paper.\u201d This blog, though, will not be a clean sheet of paper. So let\u2019s fill it!  "

                    "body": "Time and tide wait for no one. Neither do crises. They don\u2019t take holidays, and don\u2019t politely hang fire \u2013 certainly not to suit the convenience of a departing PM and the whims of two potential successors and the Conservative party membership. But with the country already in the eye of a cost of living storm, decisions cannot be put on hold until a changeover on 5 September, leaving impoverished families twisting in the wind.  The energy cap has to be suspended before 26 August, the date on which an approximately 80% increase in our energy bills is expected to be announced. The Department for Work and Pensions computers, which adjust universal credit and legacy benefits, have to be reprogrammed in the next few days if help is to be given to all who need it when prices rise on 1 October. Voluntary cuts in energy usage \u2013 good for our green agenda \u2013 should, as has happened in Germany and France, be agreed upon now when the weather is good if we are to prevent rationing later when the weather turns bad. And windfall profits and bonuses have to be properly taxed now before the money flees the country. There were two great lessons I learned right at the start of the last great economic crisis in 2008: never to be behind the curve but be ahead of events; and to get to the root of the problem. And it is not tax cuts or, as yet, a wage-price inflation spiral that are the most urgent priorities for action, but dealing with the soaring costs of fuel and food: the cause of half of our current inflation. So it is indeed urgent that the candidates to be prime minister \u2013 and the current prime minister and chancellor \u2013 meet to make not just one or two but several urgently needed decisions: to suspend and fundamentally reform the energy price cap; to agree October payments for those who will not be able to afford to turn up their heating; to home in on alternative supplies abroad and open up appropriate storage facilities at home; to agree voluntary energy reductions; and to help pay for these measures with a watertight windfall tax on energy companies and a tax on the high levels of City bonus payments. For if we could remove the opportunity to avoid or opt out, as we did when imposing the windfall tax on privatised utilities in 1997 and the banker bonus levy of 2009, we could raise not just \u00a35bn but as much as \u00a315bn. This would be enough, for example, to give nearly 8 million low-income families just under \u00a32,000 each. All these measures should be based on a clear set of principles: that the right to a warm home is a human right; that we should do most for those who have least; and that no energy retailer should be allowed to additionally profit from the crisis.  What\u2019s more, British ministers \u2013 and no one has yet grasped this \u2013 should also be leading the way, as we did in 2009, in demanding coordinated international action with an emergency G20 early in September to address the fuel, food, inflation and debt emergencies. These are global problems that can only be fully addressed by globally coordinated solutions. Tuesday\u2019s forecast from Cornwall Insight of a \u00a34,266 average annual energy price by January is remarkable. It means, as an immediate analysis carried out by Jonathan Bradshaw and Antonia Keung shows, that more than half of British households, 54%, will be in fuel poverty by October and two-thirds, 66%, by January. Six million households, an astonishing number, will be forced to pay an unprecedented 25% of their income in fuel costs and 4.4 million will be subject to a virtually unaffordable 30%.  So instead of allowing Ofgem to announce an increase on a scale that will send shock waves through every household, the government should pause any further increase in the cap; assess the actual costs of the energy supplies being sold to consumers by the major companies; and, after reviewing the profit margins, and examining how to make standing charges and social tariffs more progressive, negotiate separate company agreements to keep prices down. They should work with businesses to cut consumption, as is happening in France and Spain, which have imposed their own cap on energy prices, dictated more by what people can afford than the current wholesale gas price in the marketplace. And if the companies cannot meet these new requirements, we should consider all the options we used with the banks in 2009: guaranteed loans, equity financing and, if this fails, as a last resort, operate their essential services from the public sector until the crisis is over. With one of our main suppliers, Norway, seeking to retain its own gas for domestic use and France running into problems with its nuclear reactors, we are already running out of time to negotiate new deals with other international suppliers. And we are already missing out of additional capacity from Qatar, which has gone to mainland Europe. Over time, we can and must increase domestic production, and agree on a home insulation programme with the same urgency as our vaccination programme. It\u2019s true that Britain\u2019s decade-long low growth, caused by low investment, has made us vulnerable to skill shortages and supply-side bottlenecks and thus higher inflation than our competitors. But most of the current rise in inflation has been generated from energy and food prices caused by the war in Ukraine and so removing the Bank of England\u2019s independence is merely an exercise in blame shifting, as is direct criticism of the Treasury which, in my view, will take its lead from ministers. It is the government that sets the inflation target and appoints the Bank\u2019s main decision-makers. And it is the duty of government in a crisis to send the Bank an open letter telling it to set out a clear pathway over the coming years to return to stable prices. On the basis of an agreed inflation trajectory back to 2%, we should consider agreeing year-on-year wage settlements \u2013 starting with a flat rate of between \u00a32-3,000 this year \u2013 so that hardworking families, especially those on the lowest incomes, can afford their energy bills without being plunged into poverty. The truth is that without a plan the government is lurching from one crisis to another, failing to address the anxieties of families who see nothing more than pain now and pain later. But there is a way through from pain today to gain tomorrow, not just through the immediate relief I propose but in a clear strategy to move us from the 1.4% annual growth that the Conservatives have achieved back to a 2.5% trend growth rate. This is the one way to permanently end the cost of living crisis that British families have had to endure through an austerity decade. No one can be secure when millions feel insecure and no one can be content when there is so much discontent. Churchill once said that those who build the present in the image of the past will utterly fail to meet the challenges of the future. Only bold and decisive action starting this week will rescue people from hardship and reunite our fractured country.  Gordon Brown was UK prime minister from 2007 to 2010 "

                    "body": "As Manchester City had not been in great form heading into this Cup tie Forest, who went into the game on the back of a five-game unbeaten run, would have been hopeful of an upset. However, despite the fabled magic of the FA Cup, with two divisions separating the visiting WSL side and hosts Forest, who play in the Women\u2019s National League Northern Premier, it really was a case of David v Goliath with Manchester City, despite having a number of star names missing, proving far too strong on the day.      It was the second time this season that Nottingham Forest\u2019s women had played at the City Ground with 3,994 rocking up for the fourth round tie.   Derby University sports journalism student Chloe Reynolds, who attended the game, said: \u201cI like to go to as many matches as possible, including my own team Everton.\u201d At the final whistle Reynolds might have wished she had put a bet on as when asked what she thought the score would be, she said: \u201c8-0 to Man City.\u201d    It was the first time at a women\u2019s match for Clive and Kathryn Freeman (above left), fans Daniel Raven and Joshua Malpass kept warm in the stands despite only wearing their Forest shirts and scarves for protection against the cold.    Kern Knott and Sally Murden from Stapleford.    The visiting fans had something to celebrate just two minutes in when Caroline Weir opened the scoring, firing home a left-footed shot from close range. Despite dominating the game, the City fans had to wait until the 34th minute for a second goal which came when Khadija Shaw headed home a Filippa Angeldahl corner. The visitors went into half-time three goals to the good after Angeldahl beat the offside trap to latch onto Alex Greenwood\u2018s floated pass before poking into the bottom corner.    Manchester City goalscorers Caroline Weir (above left) and Filippa Angeldahl.    Lucy Bronze was one of the Manchester City stars that graced the City Ground      Manchester City\u2019s Lauren Hemp goes up for a header with Nottingham Forest\u2019s Olivia Cook (above), Nottingham Forest\u2019s Charlotte Greengrass (below left) and Manchester City\u2019s Filippa Angeldahl.   Manchester City\u2019s Lauren Hemp surges forward as the visitors dominate the game with over 80% possession and consequently it was a busy day for Nottingham Forest\u2019s keeper Emily Batty.      Georgia Stanway equalled and then broke Nikita Parris\u2019s record of 62 goals to become the highest scoring women\u2019s player in the club\u2019s history. Stanway\u2019s first goal was also the club\u2019s 600th goal as a professional side in all competitions. She ensured that she took the match ball home by cutting inside and unleashing a rocket during stoppage time to complete her hat-trick.  Khadija Shaw scored twice, increasing her tally for the campaign to 11 goals in 16 games, her first came in the first half and she capped a fine display by notching her second in the 69th minute by capitalising on a goalkeeper error and smashing home. The other City goalscorer was Hemp who netted their fifth early in the second half, going on a typically mazy run before finishing well into the far corner.  Academy players Jemima Dahou (above) and Ginny Lackey were handed their first-team debuts, coming on in the 75th minute. City manager Gareth Taylor said: \u201cI thought they did really well and it was really difficult because they only trained one day with us. They had to travel down separately to us because of Covid rules so it\u2019s not been easy for them, but I am sure they have absolutely loved the day. I had a quick chat with them and they were delighted.\u201d   The final whistle brings respite for the Forest players and celebrations for the City players.   It was a successful return to the City Ground for Gareth Taylor, who played for Forest from 2003 to 2006. The match also saw City\u2019s keeper Ellie Roebuck return between the sticks for her first action of the season after being out for four months with a calf injury.    Time for signing autographs and taking selfies with the fans, and celebrating with family and friends.    Their victory landed City a visit to neighbours Manchester United in the fifth round on Sunday where they\u2019ll be hoping for a result similar to that during their WSL meeting earlier this month."

Peace. \n\n\n\n 6.44pm  \n\nAnd here\u2019s John Brewin\u2019s match report.\n\n\n\n\n 6.43pm  \n\nBruno Guimaraes is delighted to be a footballer but he wants to be \u201chere with these guys; these guys make me happy\u201d. He\u2019s proud and everything in his life has become like a dream and doesn\u2019t have the words to describe it, so thanks his family and announces that his son is called Matteo. \n\u201cAn unbelievable character, player,\u201d says Callum Wilson of \u201can emotional guy\u201d. He also notes that by this time this season, Newcastle hadn\u2019t won, so they\u2019re not getting carried away, but things are slowly coming together. He didn\u2019t expect his goal to be disallowed because Lloris ran into him, and finds that VAR gets in the way, saying it\u2019s weird to celebrate, stop, then celebrate again. Asked about England, he\u2019d like to force his way into the World Cup squad \u2013 he\u2019s trying to score more goals and improve his all-round game \u2013 and saw the stadia going in Qatar when there rehabbing his knee. He said he\u2019d be back, and though I\u2019d be surprised, he\u2019s a good player. \n\n\n\n 6.39pm  \n\nAnyway, back to Spurs, I don\u2019t want to write Antonio Conte off because he\u2019s a very good manager. When he was at Chelsea and things were going badly, he took some time to analyse why, then changed formation to three at the back and a box midfield, which was a stroke of inspiration. I guess the difference there was the players he had; I\u2019m not sure that, at Spurs, he has the defenders to play a flat back-four or the midfielders to play a three in that area.\n\n\n\n 6.34pm  \n\n\u201cWhen Everton hired Frank Lampard,\u201d returns Eric Peterson, \u201che brought with him two major concerns based on his prior stops in Chelsea and Derby: his man-management skills and his tactical nous. Re the former, I give him full marks: the way that Everton have competed through the homestretch of last year\u2019s survival battle and the early stages of this season bear this out, along with individual cases like the development of Anthony Gordon and the renaissance of Alex Iwobi. Now, as far as tactics, that\u2019s actually a concern. I personally love the 4-3-3 that Lampard has stuck with but also recognise that it\u2019s inherently flawed unless your midfield is anything less than outstanding (we\u2019re seeing that on a weekly basis with Spurs, including right now). I\u2019m not sure we have what it takes yet to use it full-time, although it\u2019s certainly way stronger than it has been in recent years, and I trust Lampard to know how to coach up a midfielder. I\u2019d like to see a little more pragmatism when the occasion calls for something narrower and thus, maybe, easier to connect defence to offence (say 4-2-3-1, especially now that we have Dominic Calvert-Lewin healthy and showing some good form!)\u201d\nLampard is one of those players I thought might be a good manager: he\u2019s a bright bloke and had to think hard about how to make the most of his ability. I\u2019ve yet to see a team managed by him look like they\u2019ve a proper plan, but he\u2019s learning on the job, so if he\u2019s honest about his failings, he\u2019s got time to get good. I don\u2019t think he is yet, though. \n\n\n\n 6.30pm  \n\nYou\u2019ve got to hand it to Howe as well, who probably wasn\u2019t first, second or third choice for the job. But he came in with a vision \u2013 that his players are able to carry out \u2013 and it\u2019s hard to imagine anyone else doing a better job because he seems to be getting the absolute maximum out of his squad. And, with Isak to come back and another state wealth-sponsored transfer window only a couple of months away, they\u2019ve a real chance of qualifying for Europe at the very least. \n\n\n\n 6.27pm  \n\nThe Newcastle players get together to share the joy of a massive win. They\u2019re an interesting situation, because most of these players won\u2019t have thought they\u2019d ever reach such rarefied heights or be part of a club that will probably, at some point in the near future, contest the title. But here they are, and you can understand why they\u2019re loving it and why there\u2019s such commitment and togetherness. \n\n\n\n 6.25pm  \nFull-time: Tottenham Hotspur 1-2 Newcastle United\n\nA terrific win for Newcastle, who motor into the top four, and a dreadful week for Spurs, who stay third.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 6.37pm BST\n\n\n 6.24pm  \n\n90+3 min \u201cI don\u2019t support either of these teams but time wasting really gets on my nerves,\u201d says Sam Campbell. \u201cany idea why referee\u2019s have stopped making players go off at the nearest point when they are substituted? Seemed to last about half a season before being scrapped.\u201d\nI saw it happen at Stamford Bridge yesterday, so it\u2019s not gone altogether, but I agree it\u2019s not uniformly observed. But with apologies for going on, if we standardised and displayed timekeeping, it\u2019d still matter a bit because it\u2019s a way of halting momentum, but it\u2019d also matter a lot less. \n\n\n\n 6.23pm  \n\n90+3 min Newcastle have disappeared the last 15 minutes very well, but Spurs don\u2019t really have a clue how to increase or sustain pressure. \n\n\n\n 6.22pm  \n\n90+1 min There\u2019ll be five added minutes which is, as almost ever, a joke. We lost two while VAR checked the Kane goal and there\u2019ve also been bookings, fouls and cards; why can\u2019t we stop the click every time the ball goes dead, thereby allowing us to watch an actual game of football \u2013 with the same, standardised timekeeping parameters? It should not matter, for example, how quickly a player can retrieve the ball from the crowd, or from the back of the net after a goal. \n\n\n\n 6.19pm  \n\n90 min A long ball releases Wood, who lets it bounce because Bentancur misjudges the flight; Bentancur shoves him, then Royal knocks him over and is booked. That is such foolish behaviour, because by the time the free-kick\u2019s taken at least another 30 seconds will\u2019ve departed. \n\n\n\n 6.18pm  \n\n88 min Two more changes for Newcastle, Shelvey and Wood replacing Wilson and Guimaraes. Wilson takes his time departing, as you would, moving away from the touchline to Dier\u2019s intense consternation, then holds up again to applaud the away end and Royal expresses angst. But eventually we\u2019re back under way. \n\n\n\n 6.16pm  \n\n86 min Again, the corner is a poor one but Perisic picks up the loose ball outside the box and curls a decent cross into the middle which Dier heads just wide \u2013 before the flag goes up for offside.\n\n\nUpdated at 6.20pm BST\n\n\n 6.15pm  \n\n86 min Moura drives down the wing and slings over a cross, to which Perisic can\u2019t get. But a terrific diag, from Bentancur I think, frees Moura again, and he wins a corner that yields another.\n\nUpdated at 6.15pm BST\n\n\n 6.14pm  \n\n84 min Pope is booked for timewasting, which prompts me to remind you that Newcastle wasted a load of time at Anfield and wound up losing when the ref added it (some of it) on at the end of 90 minutes. \n\n\n\n 6.13pm  \n\n82 min Back to the top-four point, the big unknown this season is the World Cup. I\u2019m totally guessing when I say this, but my guess is that quarter-final defeat is the best outcome for the clubs of the players involved. Five weeks off doesn\u2019t seem helpful, and coming back having lost a semi or final, then having to go straight back to the grind doesn\u2019t either. \n\n\n\n 6.11pm  \n\n81 min Final changes for Spurs, Doherty and Davies on for Sanchez and Lenglet. I can\u2019t say I\u2019m certain how that might yield an equaliser, but am certain that Conte knows more about the old association football than do I. \n\n\n\n 6.09pm  \n\n79 min \u201cI think Newcastle have to be considered a top-four contender along with the teams above them in the table at the moment,\u201d emails Rick Harris. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t write off Liverpool so that makes City, Arsenal, Chelsea, Spurs, United and Newcastle fighting for four Champions League places. I think we can safely say City will be in the top four so that means six clubs are fighting for three places.\u201d\nIf Newcastle can get Isak fit, they\u2019ve got a chance, but think it\u2019ll be a step too far for them this season. My best guess is City, Arsenal, Chelsea, United, but I\u2019d be at all surprised to be wrong. \n\n\n\n 6.07pm  \n\n77 min Spurs do, though, sustain this attack, Kane spinning in the box to caress a ball into Son. From an acute angle, he drives low and the ball hits Burn\u2019s foot and runs up his body; Spurs want a penalty, but I\u2019m not even sure it touched his hand, never mind in an unnatural position from a fair enough distance away. \n\n\n\n 6.06pm  \n\n77 min Royal heads a searching ball down and back for Moura, but Joelinton does well to barge him out of it. \n\n\n\n 6.05pm  \n\n76 min Newcastle have the best defensive record in the league, so they\u2019re part of the reason Spurs haven\u2019t been able to sustain any pressure. But it\u2019s also the case that Spurs aren\u2019t set up to do that because they lack a midfield tempo-setter, midfield enterprise, and wingers stretching the play. \n\n\n\n 6.04pm  \n\n75 min Change for Newcastle, Murphy replacing Willock \u2013 who replaced him in the starting XI. \n\n\n\n 6.03pm  \n\n74 min In the WSL, Man United have beaten Leicester 1-0 \u2013 they\u2019re now second, behind Arsenal who beat Liverpool 2-0 in the early game, on alphabetical order \u2013 and West Ham have beaten Reading 3-2.\n\n\n\n 6.01pm  \n\n72 min On Schar, by the way, he\u2019s hit a couple of tremendous long passes this afternoon. He\u2019s another who\u2019s thriving under Howe \u2013 and as I type that, a poor pass from Sanchez is intercepted by another, Joelinton, but Dier is on-hand to intercede. \n\n\n\n 6.00pm  \n\n71 min Newcastle force a corner and try their usual ploy, men heading for the front post to create space at the back. Schar wins the header too, but can\u2019t make anything of it and Spurs clear. \n\n\n\n 5.59pm  \n\n69 min Lovely from Kane, who draws men towards him even though it\u2019s clear he\u2019s looking for the pass outside him to Perisic. And when he makes it, his man has a sight of goal, but can only pass a tame effort straight at Pope. \n\n\n\n 5.57pm  \n\n68 min Wilson leaps into Lloris as he kicks clear from hand, gets nowhere near the ball, and is booked. \n\n\n\n 5.56pm  \n\n66 min Skipp is booked for a foul I missed, then he\u2019s replaced by Lucas Moura. On which point, I was wondering if Moura might be someone who can help resolve Spurs\u2019 attacking midfield issues. Given they play with wing-backs and he\u2019s not one, perhaps his ability to run with the ball and shoot from distance can be deployed centrally. \n\n\n\n 5.55pm  \n\n64 min \u201cNonsense,\u201d says Brendan Murphy about my Lampard observation. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is with you guys and Lampard. He kept Everton up last season and they\u2019re improving this season. He\u2019s steadied what was a very turbulent club, made them solid at the back, converted Iwobi into a decent central-midfielder and they\u2019re very well organised. Obviously he\u2019s from the entitled golden generation and he\u2019s part of the unsavoury Redknapp clan, but if you can just set your understandable prejudices to one side and take look at what he\u2019s actually done to a club that was in uproar by the end of Benitez\u2019s reign, you should be able to see that there\u2019s been substantial progress.\u201d\nI\u2019ve no prejudices against Lampard, I\u2019ve just not seen much that makes me think he\u2019s a good manager. Crediting him with keeping Everton up, when he was part of getting them into relegation trouble to begin with, is a reach, I think. And, though I agree he\u2019s done a great job with Iwobi and got the fans on-side, I\u2019ll need to see a lot more before thinking he\u2019s going to take them anywhere. \n\n\n\n 5.52pm  \n\n63 min Slowly but perceptibly, Spurs are increasing the pressure on Newcastle. \n\n\n\n 5.52pm  \n\n62 min Son\u2019s corner swings out like a sister on its way into the middle, so the lino raises his flag. \n\n\n\n\n 5.51pm  \n\n61 min No side has scored as many from corners as Spurs, but for some reason they go short and nothing comes from it; when they win another, seconds later, I\u2019d expect to see the ball go into the box. \n\n\n\n 5.50pm  \n\n61 min Conte sends on Perisic for Sessegnon and Spurs win another corner. \n\n\n\n 5.50pm  \n\n60 min Son runs at Guimaraes and ends up megging him almost by mistake, so Guimaraes introduces shin to shin, doing well to avoid a caution. \n\n\n\n 5.49pm  \n\n59 min Sessegnon pulls back the wriggling Almiron and is booked. \n\n\n\n 5.48pm  \n\n58 min Not initially! Willock drifts inside and away from Skipp, looking to curl a low one inside the far post. It\u2019s not going in, but Wilson runs onto it unmolested and flings a foot that sends the ball just wide. Spurs still look static in midfield and shaky at the back. \n\n\n\n 5.47pm  \n\n57 min But for the fact that it arrived \u2013 pick the bones out of that, R v White fans \u2013 that goal was not coming. Can Spurs build on it? \n\n\n\n 5.46pm  \n\n56 min We can\u2019t see if he did or didn\u2019t, so the goal stands. What a player! What an inspiration!\n\nUpdated at 5.58pm BST\n\n\n 5.45pm  \n\n55 min Oh man, did Sanchez get a flick as the ball crossed the box? If he did, Kane was offside\u2026\n\n\n\n 5.44pm  \nGOAL! Tottenham Hotspur 1-2 Newcastle United (Kane 54)\n\nHarry Kane rescues the Harry Kane team! The corner goes near post and Lenglet does very well to Steve Bould a flick on while, at the back post, Trippier loses Kane who nods in from a couple of yards. Game on!\n\n\n\nUpdated at 6.07pm BST\n\n\n 5.42pm  \n\n52 min A ball towards the far post sees Joelinton and Emerson tussling. There\u2019s a brief look at whether Emerson used an arm, but a corner is the call and that comes to nowt , Spurs getting down the other end and winning one of their own. \n\n\n\n 5.41pm  \n\n51 min \u201cThere\u2019s been quite a bit of positive comment about the style that Newcastle play with now, especially in contrast with the pretty dull approach taken by Benitez and Bruce. But what is perhaps most impressive from the coaching side is how defensively good they are, and what good signings they seem to have made. While Bournemouth always played an attractive style of football under Howe they were consistently poor defensively (so had to take an approach of trying to score lots rather than keep the score against them down). And very few of Howe\u2019s signings after Bournemouth\u2019s promotion made a great impact at the club, they were mainly relying on the players that got them up. He\u2019s obviously gone away after he left them and worked on his weaknesses. Perhaps that\u2019s not a great surprise, it\u2019s his profession and vocation after all. But there does seem to be a presumption that managers can only ever be one thing, that they can\u2019t really develop or change the way they tend to set up a team. Yet we think that players can improve and change, so why not managers too?\u201d\nI agree. I find his press-conference belligerence, when asked about the provenance of his club\u2019s money and improvement, distasteful in the extreme. but he\u2019s done and is doing a terrific job. \n\n\n\n 5.40pm  \n\n49 min Joelinton barges down the outside of Emerson and wins a corner; whatever was said in the Spurs dressing room at half-time, it\u2019s not yet had any discernible effect. Trippier then goes short, coaxes a fine cross into the box when the ball comes back \u2026 and the flag goes up for offside. That\u2019s quite some oversight because it looked like a rehearsed move, so there are no excuses for being caught out like that. \n\n\n\n 5.38pm  \n\n48 min More Newcastle pressure, Almiron shanking a volley after a corner is partially cleared. But Newcastle stay on Spurs, who\u2019ve never seemed more like the Harry Kane team. \n\n\n\n 5.37pm  \n\n47 min \u201cGreetings from Pittsburgh!\u201d begins Eric Peterson. \u201cI\u2019m an Evertonian with a family full of Fulham supporters and a best friend who hails from Bradford. Our circle is enjoying a quirky taste of schadenfreude right now thanks to the Cottagers, with their win over Aston Villa resulting in the sacking of a Liverpool legend and their win over Leeds maybe pushing their manager to the brink. I wondered about Fulham\u2019s chances for a hat-trick of post-match sackings, checked their fixtures, and saw that ... uh-oh ... their next game is against Everton. Be careful what you wish for.\u201d\nI think Marsch and Lampard are safe for now, but yup, both would be among my favourites not to start next season. \n\n\n\n\n 5.35pm  \n\n46 min Those near the front as getting soaked, and there aren\u2019t many knocking about those seats \u2013 which makes perfect sense, I\u2019d be sticking about on the concourse to fantasise about the cheese room. \n\n\n\n 5.34pm  \n\n46 min It\u2019s absolutely tipping it down in N17, but we go again. \n\n\n\n 5.34pm  \n\nThe players are back with us. \n\n\n\n 5.31pm  \n\n\u201cSpurs want it to be one way,\u201d says Robert Walnut. \u201cBut it\u2019s the other way.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n 5.28pm  \n\nSpurs are in trouble. There\u2019s a total lack of confidence, coherence and control in how they play, and if there\u2019s no second-half improvement, the locals will, no doubt, share some sentiments with manager and players. \n\n\n\n 5.22pm  \n\nHalf-time reading:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 5.21pm  \nHalf-time: Tottenham Hotspurs 0-2 Newcastle United\n\nBoos from some of the crowd as the players depart; Newcastle took their goals beautifully but haven\u2019t had to play especially well for their advantage, because Spurs are poor.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.30pm BST\n\n\n 5.19pm  \n\n45+3 min Son controls a long pass from Sessegnon but the movement means he\u2019s facing away from goal. So on the edge, he tees up Bentancur, whose shot is blocked. \n\n\n\n 5.19pm  \n\n45+2 min Make your own minds up, if you fancy. \n\n\n\n\n 5.18pm  \n\n45+1 min \u201cLester Freamon?\u201d asks Kevin Simons. \u201cYeah, but what would Bunk Moreland make of it?\u201d \nI feel like you\u2019re goading me to post that scene in which him and McNutty communicate using nothing but versions of a single four-letter word. I fear it may not be dissimilar to the patter in the Spurs dressing room at half-time. \n\n\n\n 5.16pm  \n\n45 min There\u2019ll be three added minutes. \n\n\n\n 5.16pm  \n\n44 min \u201cThat is getting ugly,\u201d returns Yash Gupta. \u201cI suppose that\u2019s the limit of Conte\u2019s coaching. He can\u2019t make not great defender into a great one. Spurs had chances to score but Newcastle\u2019ve had as well apart from their goals. And my goodness this defence!\u201d\nI know what you mean, but my main issue with this team is their inability to control tempo in midfield, which puts pressure on the back three, and the lack of player in the middle of the pitch able to do the unexpected. When Kane drops, there needs to be someone making a third-man run ahead of him, or him dropping needs to be an occasional intervention. \n\n\n\n 5.14pm  \n\n43 min And credit to Howe, who\u2019s clearly spotted the potential of someone it would\u2019ve been easy to write off, then worked with him to realise the potential we saw in MLS. \n\n\n\n 5.13pm  \n\n42 min Miguel Almiron, though! \n\n\n\n 5.13pm  \nWHAT A GOAL! Tottenham hotspur 0-2 Newcastle United (Almiron 40)\n\nIt\u2019s that man again! Lloris chips a pass out to Sessegnon on the left but Longstaff is in quickly, winning the ball and freeing Almiron who veers away from Sessegnon then stamps on the gas to flay past Lenglet, down the right of the box, takes an extra touch as he opens his body, then punches an expert\u2019s finish under the keeper\u2019s dive! That is sensational behaviour!\n\n\nUpdated at 6.48pm BST\n\n\n 5.11pm  \n\n40 min Spurs have lost their way here, and I hate to repeat myself but they don\u2019t have players able to sustain pressure with possession. \n\n\n\n 5.08pm  \n\n38 min Joelinton collects possession and lashes a shot not that far wide of the far post, but the flag was up. \n\n\n\n 5.08pm  \n\n36 min now Newcastle counter, Wilson in space at inside-right and controlling Longstaff\u2019s pass nicely. But his pass to Almiron is poor, and Spurs get the ball away. \n\n\n\n 5.07pm  \n\n36 min \u201cI suppose we can at least be grateful that Newcastle aren\u2019t owned by the UK government,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cNow that really would be embarrassing.\u201d\nIt\u2019s all connected, but. As Lester Freamon would say, \u201cAll the pieces matter.\u201d\n\n\n\n 5.06pm  \n\n35 min Spurs try and redress the balance, Sessegnon away down the left, but his cross sails miles away from anyone and towards the nearest Tube station, as we learn that Bentancur was booked for bitching about the goal. \n\n\n\n 5.05pm  \n\n33 min The goal stands and rightly so: no offside, no foul and no handball, but yes sill goalkeeping and fine finishing. \n\n\n\n 5.04pm  \n\n32 min Lloris is raging \u2013 he wants a free-kick \u2013 but he ran into Wilson because he made a stupid decision to come out, which he then executed stupidly by not humping clear. VAR is taking a look\u2026\n\nUpdated at 5.10pm BST\n\n\n 5.03pm  \nGOAL! Tottenham Hotspur 0-1 Newcastle United (Wilson 31)\n\nA disaster for Hugo Lloris! Schar clips another fine long ball over the top and Lloris charges out of his goal to clear, only to control with his thighs and collide with Wilson, who collects the loose ball as the keeper flays his way to the ground. Wilson turns, clips a fine chip over Dier, and that\u2019s a tremendous finish.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.09pm BST\n\n\n 5.01pm  \n\n29 min Bentancur robs Longstaff deep inside the Tottenham half and sets Kane away at inside-left; he does well to cut inside, opening a shooting lane and letting go a low one, that Pope saves via outstretched studs. Longstaff will be extremely relieved to see the ball eventually cleared. \n\n\n\n 4.59pm  \n\n27 min I feel like I say this every game I do, but the penalty law is a big problem \u2013 you can\u2019t be getting free goals for minor infractions. The answer is to let refs decide if an infringement has prevented a goalscoring opportunity and if it has, inside the box, or outside, it\u2019s a penalty, and if not, it\u2019s a direct free-kick. \n\n\n\n 4.57pm  \n\n25 min Newcastle win a free-kick and stick a ball into the box, Wilson trying to turn a shot goalwards. He misses and wears a little kick from Lenglet, one of those that outside the box might be a foul but inside it, isn\u2019t one you\u2019d feel comfy awarding a penalty for.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.01pm BST\n\n\n 4.56pm  \n\n24 min \u201cThat guy on the lamppost is good in the air and all,\u201d Justin Kavanagh, \u201cbut he has no right foot! Perhaps there\u2019s a late-career opening on the continent for Ronaldo after all.\u201d\nBecause he became such a remorseless accumulator, it\u2019s easy to forget the feet Ronaldo had as a young player \u2013 my favourite version of him was the 06-07 version, when he was still a right-winger looking to go on the outside, but also a cold goalscorer. \n\n\n\n 4.54pm  \n\n23 min Skipp breaks ahead of play and Bentancur, out on the right, turns to slide him a decent pass down the line. The ball then moves over to Sessegnon, who drags a shot that earns a corner via two defelections, Spurs\u2019 first of the game \u2026 which comes to nowt. \n\n\n\n 4.52pm  \n\n21 min Emerson shanks a ball to no one that winds up a terrific switch for Sessegnon. But double-teamed, he has to go backwards, and Spurs\u2019 attack peters out. \n\n\n\n 4.51pm  \n\n20 min Dier takes the ball and goes short, gets ball a pass he doesn\u2019t want and, looking for Lloris, instead punches past the far post. He\u2019ll have swallowed his nether regions there, and won\u2019t be comfortable with the corner coming in, but Spurs clear it as far as Almiron, who, from outside the box, lifts a speculative shot past the far post.\n\n\n\n 4.49pm  \n\n18 min I guess you could drop one of the midfielders and play Kane there too, or to keep Son in his preferred position. \n\n\n\n 4.49pm  \n\n18 min If you could clone Kane and were committed to 3-5-2, would you stick Son at wing-back so he could play behind himself?\n\n\n\n 4.48pm  \n\n17 min This is a decent game, both teams looking to get the ball forward. Kane aside, we\u2019ve yet to see much quality in the final third, but there\u2019s at least the suggestion that there\u2019ll soon be some. \n\n\n\n 4.46pm  \n\n15 min Sessegnon is coming into the game, skirting around Trippier and standing up a cross which is cleared to Bissouma on the edge \u2026 and he larrups over the top. \n\n\n\n 4.46pm  \n\n14 min The question, of course, is how you do that \u2013 does a midfielder stick on him or does a centre-back go with him. Because Spurs don\u2019t have anyone coming from behind with the instinct to hit the box, I\u2019d be tempted to gamble with the latter. \n\n\n\n 4.44pm  \n\n13 min Kane is pulling Newcastle all over place, again coming short to send Sessegnon away down the left. He\u2019s offside, but if someone doesn\u2019t get to grips with him soon, Spurs will score. \n\n\n\n 4.43pm  \n\n11 min Harry Kane is just rrrridiculous. Again, he drops deep, and again he slides in a delectable pass, putting Son in on Pope! The first touch is good enough, from maybe the league\u2019s best one-on-one finisher, but he waits perhaps a stride too many to attempt his second, a lift over the keeper, who\u2019s too close to him for that, and it comes off his body, allowing Trippier to clear before the ball can dribble over the line.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.45pm BST\n\n\n 4.41pm  \n\n9 min Newcastle, not owned by the Saudi state, will be training at Riyadh during the World Cup, we\u2019re reminded. How absolutely darling for them. \n\n\n\n 4.39pm  \n\n8 min Seeing that Royal challenge again, I now think it was penalty, but I can see why it wasn\u2019t given. \n\n\n\n 4.38pm  \n\n7 min \u2026Schar wins the first header on the far side of the box but Lloris fists away and Spurs get the ball clear. \n\n\n\n 4.38pm  \n\n7 min Newcastle win another corner\u2026\n\n\n\n 4.37pm  \n\n6 min I can\u2019t lie, when I saw that happen, I assumed Royal had clumsily barged Joelinton over \u2013 in my defence, I am in row Z \u2013 but once he\u2019d been caught, he played the situation perfectly. \n\n\n\n 4.36pm  \n\n5 min Schar, wide on the right and on roughly halfway, drops a fine ball into the box for Joelinton and for a second it looks like he\u2019s in. But Royal does brilliantly to stay close without giving away a foul, so that when Big Joe, as Steve Bruce knew him, swings back his leg to shoot, he boots Royal, the two fall together, and the upshot is a corner \u2013 which comes to nowt. \n\n\n\n 4.34pm  \n\n3 min Already, there\u2019s a better tempo about Spurs, Kane dropping deep and setting Royal away. He squares to Skipp who pokes one more to Son, and Son dips inside his man then lands a curler onto the roof of the net. Much, much better from Conte\u2019s men.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.43pm BST\n\n\n 4.33pm  \n\n2 min Joelinton seems be out on the left today, with Longstaff and Guimaraes in front of the back four and Willock in front of them. \n\n\n\n 4.32pm  \n\n1 min The cameras at the new Spurs ground are way too high \u2013 I feel like I\u2019m at Newcastle away. But I can just about make out Son, skating towards the box and ramming a rising shot that\u2019s straight at Pope. \n\n\n\n 4.31pm  \n\n1 min Away we go! \n\n\n\n 4.28pm  \n\nOH MY DAYS!\n\n\n\n\n 4.27pm  \n\nHere come the teams! \n\n\n\n 4.26pm  \n\nBack to the top of the table, I wondered if, watching Arsenal against Leeds last weekend, they\u2019d run out of form or won despite a rare poor performance because that\u2019s what the best teams do. Their performance this afternoon suggested the latter, though now they\u2019re through in the Europa, a midweek rest for the first XI might be restorative. The thing is, though, this season more than any other will work in favour of those clubs with big squads, making the league an even greatest test of financial resources than usual. \n\n\n\n 4.21pm  \n\n\u201cA year ago Spurs lost at West Ham, barely scraped past Burnley and got thumped by Ole\u2019s United,\u201d emails Yash Gupta. \u201cSo when Conte came in, it was fresh to see players passing the ball around just to feel it instead of always trying to launch a counter. I really enjoyed Spurs since then until the game at West Ham this season when at around 66 minutes this realisation came, there\u2019s no point in watching this game. We ain\u2019t doing anything to score a goal and by the end West Ham should\u2019ve won it. I remember against Southampton under Mourinho on New Year\u2019s day when for the first time I felt at around 55 minutes \u2013 there\u2019s just no point. There is no clear plan of how we\u2019re going to string five passes together never mind score a goal.Spurs fans were staring at another crushing run of mid-table mediocrity before Conte. He brought passion. And so everything felt good. Yes we were never going to win the title or challenge for it this season. But I just want to watch Spurs play without fear. What\u2019s the point in this cowardly play and for what? So we don\u2019t concede goals. If not for Hugo Wednesday night would\u2019ve been a historic shellacking anyway. I hope Conte realises this. Winning ugly ain\u2019t good and here at Spurs, Mourinho found out these players are not suited to that either. I firmly believe Conte will bring success. He just needs to be brave.\u201d\nIt\u2019s very hard not to watch the teams who\u2019ve beaten Spurs this season and think hmm, managers on the way up and at the cutting edge, versus a manager past his best, from whom the game is getting away. I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s not been brilliant, not at all \u2013 his performance in winning the title with Chelsea is one of the best in the Premier League era, but I wonder if he\u2019s prepared to change his principles in line with the way the game has changed since then. I also wonder if those principles are why he\u2019s consistently failed in the Champions League. \n\n\n\n 4.15pm  \n\nEddie Howe is delighted for Guimaraes, who travelled down alone, late last night and was very emotional to become a father. He wants his team to be adaptable, but they also have a style they want to stick to. \nConte, meanwhile, says Hojbjerg and Romero are injured and today is a difficult game, so the team need the fans to stay close. \n\n\n\n 4.12pm  \n\n\u201cNot sure if I agree with the assertion that Spurs lack class in midfield,\u201d says Kieran McHugh. \u201cRodrigo Bentancur is one of the most underrated midfielders in the league. He does lack this class in depth though, agreed. Also Leicester won the league by soaking up pressure and using Vardy\u2019s pace and clinical finishing alongside Mahrez.\u201d\nI think Bentancur is decent too, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019d get into any other \u201cbig six\u201d midfield. And, while it\u2019s true that Leicester won the league in a particular style \u2013 though I\u2019d not leave Ngolo Kant\u00e9 out of any description of how they did it \u2013 the standard has gone up massively since then. They\u2019d not be champions now, just as Conte\u2019s Chelsea wouldn\u2019t either. \n\n\n\n 4.08pm  \n\nLooking again at that Spurs side, I\u2019ve a question: from where is creativity supposed to emanate? Skipp, Bissouma and Bentancur have their qualities, but none are renowned for their passing, dribbling or goalscoring while, in wide areas, Emerson and Sessegnon are both raw. And there\u2019s not much on the bench either, unless Conte were to stick Bryan Gil, whom there\u2019s no evidence he rates, inside. I don\u2019t really get it, because even Conte\u2019s Chelsea team that won the title had Fabregas, Hazard and one of Pedro or Willian in the middle of the pitch. \n\n\n\n 4.03pm  \n\nBack to those earlier results, by the way, Leeds have replaced Leicester in the bottom three, while Wolves look in for a long, hard winter. \n\n\n\n 4.02pm  \n\nWhat about Miguel Almir\u00f3n, by the way? After scoring just once last season, he\u2019s already bagged five this, most recently a beauty in midweek. He always grafted his behind off, but is now showing the verve we saw in MLS, that is why Newcastle signed him.\n\nUpdated at 6.49pm BST\n\n\n 3.58pm  \n\nSouthampton-Arsenal has finished 1-1, meaning Arsenal stay top but just two points in front of Man City \u2013 and five in front of Spurs. Southampton move up to 15th while, elsewhere, Fulham won 3-2 at Leeds, Villa marked Steven Gerrard\u2019s sacking by thumping Brentford 4-0 \u2013 of their goals, three came in the first 14 minutes \u2013 and Leicester clattered Wolves 4-0. \n\n\n\n\n 3.56pm  \n\nThe thing with Spurs is, and will continue to be, their lack of midfield class. There\u2019s no permutation available to Conte \u2013 that Conte has made available to himself \u2013 which allows them to outplay a decent side. I think the 3-5-2 is better for them than the 3-4-3 because it means they\u2019re not outnumbered in that area while giving Son greater freedom, but you can\u2019t challenge for titles on the counter-attack. \n\n\n\n 3.50pm  \n\nAs for Newcastle, Eddie Howe brings in Joe Willock for Jacob Murphy; Guimar\u00e3es starts, despite becoming a father a couple of days ago. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a gag here about watching Spurs play to catch up on missed sleep, but I\u2019m far too mature to make it. \n\n\n\n 3.49pm  \n\nBack to our teams, Conte makes five changes to the side that subsided so abjectly at Old Trafford: at wing-back, Emerson Royal returns from suspension, replacing Matt Doherty while, on the other side, it\u2019s Ryan Sessegnon not Perisic. In the middle of defence, Clement Lenglet and Davison Sanchez are in for Ben Davies and the injured Cristian Romero, while in midfield, Oliver Skipp makes his first start of the season in place of the also-injured Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg.\n\n\n\n 3.45pm  \n\nToday\u2019s other lates scores:\nAston Villa 4-0 Brentford \nLeeds 1-3 Fulham\nWolves 0-4 Leicester\n\n\n\n 3.41pm  \n\nBefore we have a look at the teams in more detail, let me alert you to the closing stages at st Mary\u2019s, where Southampton and Arsenal are locked at 1-1. \n\n\n\n\n 3.38pm  \nTeams!\n\nTottenham Hotspur (3-5-2): Lloris; Lenglet, Sanchez, Dier; Royal, Skipp, Bentancur, Bissouma, Sessegnon; Son, Kane. Subs: Forster, Doherty, Gil, Perisic, Spence, Tanganga, Moura, Davies, White.\nNewcastle United (4-2-3-1): Pope; Trippier, Botman, Schar, Burn; Joelinton, Longstaff; Willock, Guimar\u00e3es, Almiron; Wilson. Subs: Karius, Lascelles, Shelvey, Lewis, Targett, Manquillo, Wood, Fraser, Murphy.\nReferee: Jarred Gillet (Gold Coast, Queensland)\n\nUpdated at 3.46pm BST\n\n\n 3.30pm  \nPreamble\n\nFootball \u2013 and modern life \u2013 and the human psyche \u2013 love a crisis. There\u2019s little more engaging than misery \u2013 especially, though not uniquely, when it isn\u2019t yours \u2013 and for Tottenham, sitting third in the table amounts to a crisis. I know that\u2019s not the kind of circumstance the word \u201cspursy\u201d was coined to describe, but how absolutely spursy it is nonetheless.\nThe reason for the angst is, to put a fine point on it, Antonio Conte. At the end of last season, he did really well to confrontationally cajole his team into the final Champions League spot \u2013 helped, admittedly, by staggering incompetence elsewhere \u2013 then use his achievement to extract money from his board. But that\u2019s where the problems started. Ivan Perisic, Yves Bissouma and Richarlison are decent players just as Djed Spence is a decent prospect, but even at the time, it looked like more than \u00a3100m spent turning a team able to contest the Champions League places but no more into a team still able to contest the Champions League places but no more.\nNor is that it. Pretty much every time Spurs have faced decent opposition this season, they\u2019ve been outplayed \u2013 by Chelsea, though they sneaked a draw at the end, by Arsenal and by Manchester United \u2013 and in general, play a reactive style that\u2019s hard to watch in and of itself, never mind when you peruse the talent available to make that not so. Teams with far worse players than Spurs play for more engaging football, and you can forgive those of their supporters who are wondering as to the point of it.\nNewcastle, on the other hand, are doing things differently. The provenance of that is, of course, to our collective shame, but though they bought Chris Wood, Kieran Trippier and Dan Burn to make sure they stayed up, they\u2019ve also acquired Bruno Guimar\u00e3es, Sven Botman and Alexander Isaak \u2013 youngsters who might develop into top players and a level above those bought by Spurs.\nAnd their hard-running, proactive style is - even now \u2013 precisely that with which Conte\u2019s men have struggled this season. There are many ways to go about \u201cwinning football matches\u201d, but for a club that has spent so lavishly and for whom good football is a prerequisite, hanging back to hang in there while hoping for a counter or that Harry Kane or Heung-min Son do something, doesn\u2019t feel sustainable.\nKick-off: 4.30pm BST\n\n"

                    "body": "\u201cI\u2019ve just seen that Scott Arfield of Rangers has made 100 league appearances for four different clubs (Falkirk, Huddersfield, Burnley and Rangers). Is this a record, or has someone done this with five,\u201d ponders Jesse Pajwani. Tom Ayres would like to add three other names to the 4 x 100 club. \u201cAlan Ball matched this feat at Blackpool, Everton, Arsenal and Southampton,\u201d writes Tom. \u201cGraham Alexander has appeared in the league more than 150 times for four clubs: Scunthorpe, Luton, Preston and Burnley. Tony Ford brought his century up four times, for Grimsby, Stoke City, West Bromwich Albion and Mansfield.\u201d Kieran Whooley offers the great sleight-of-hip merchant Chris Waddle, who reached three figures for Newcastle, Tottenham, Marseille and Sheffield Wednesday. But there is at least one man who has made 100 league appearances for five clubs. A number of you mentioned Peter Shilton, who belongs to the rare breed of journeymen who were also all-time greats. He reached a century at Leicester, Stoke, Nottingham Forest, Southampton and Derby County. And, as Tom points out, he also won a record 125 caps for England.  The longest penalty barren spells \u201cIt\u2019s been 100 league matches since Leyton Orient scored a penalty,\u201d tweets Chris Walsh. \u201cIs that a record? If not, what\u2019s the longest such run?\u201d In 2018 we touched on the longest spells in which teams haven\u2019t even been awarded a spot-kick, as opposed to actually scoring one. But Orient\u2019s current dry spell in the box doesn\u2019t appear to be a record \u2013 even in London. \u201cCrystal Palace went 148 league games (and 154 games in total) without scoring a penalty from 5 October 1946 to 11 March 1950,\u201d tweets Calciocassini. \u201cUnlikely that this is the longest such run. Palace also had a run of 118 league games (128 in all) without scoring a penalty from September 1964 to August 1967, went crazy with a run of three in 10 games, before going on another 99-game run (119 in all) from October 1967 to February 1970. This was around the time I started attending Palace matches and I remember wondering if I would ever see us score a penalty.\u201d After enduring all those droughts, we sincerely hope you were at Selhurst Park on Easter Monday 1989. Has Loftus-Cheek made unwanted history? \u201cIs Ruben Loftus-Cheek the first substitute to be substituted in the FA Cup final?\u201d asks Steve Pye. The aptly numbered Ruben Loftus-Cheek (12) came on for Christian Pulisic at half-time in extra-time on Saturday, before being replaced by Ross Barkley for the penalty shootout. But he didn\u2019t make unwanted FA Cup final history. A similar thing happened to another Chelsea player, Arjen Robben, in the 1-0 victory over Manchester United in 2007. Robben came on for Joe Cole at half-time in normal time but suffered an injury in extra-time and was replaced by another Cole, Ashley. It was his last appearance for the club. So the record belongs to Robben, though Loftus-Cheek remains the first to be taken off because of his penalty history.  Who has scored the most second-tier goals? \u201cAleksandar Mitrovic\u2019s goal tally in the Championship this season is 43 but I wonder which player has scored most goals overall in football\u2019s second tiers,\u201d wonders Bogdan Kotarlic. Steve Hyde would like to open the bidding on this one.  And, er, the Justin Horton Show may well have closed it.  It was actually 250 \u2013 one of his goals came in the First Division, just before his retirement through injury at the age of 29 \u2013 though that will still take some beating. Of course, we wouldn\u2019t say Brian Clough was the best second-tier goalscorer of all time. But he might have been in the top one.  Knowledge archive \u201cCan you clear up who actually first uttered \u2018If he\u2019s not interfering with play, what\u2019s he doing on the pitch\u2019? Was it Shankly, or Blanchflower, or neither of the above,\u201d enquired Steve Antrobus in 2004. \u201cIn the last few weeks of debate I have seen various reports attributing the quote to both. I am a Spurs fan but I have refrained from sticking my neck out and claiming it as Blanchflower\u2019s \u2026 so far!\u201d And it\u2019s a good job Steve did, as neither Bill nor Danny could rightly take the credit for such insight (something today\u2019s rule-making suits would do well to listen to and discuss over their grande double-decaf skinny latte triple frappucinos). But you will be glad to hear your right to bask in reflected Spurs glory has not been entirely denied, as the coiner of the much-quoted phrase was in fact the White Hart Lane legend Bill Nicholson in his days as manager at the club \u2013 and not, as some in Scouse quarters would have you believe, Bill Shankly. Shankly\u2019s wordy take on the situation was in fact: \u201cIf a player is not interfering with play or seeking to gain an advantage, then he should be.\u201d Which, we think you will agree, is completely different.  Can you help? \u201cHow many clubs worldwide have won the league title in their centenary year and which was the first?\u201d asks Masai Graham.  \u201cWho\u2019s the oldest player to win their first Premier League or Champions League medal? And who completed the most transfers before this career highlight?\u201d wonders Albert in Vienna.  \u201cWith Rangers playing Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League final, they will be playing their third German team in the same Euro tournament after earlier accounting for Borussia Dortmund and RB Leipzig. Has anyone played more teams from the same country in any of the European club tournaments?\u201d enquires Hugh McGinley.  \u201cChelsea just lost their third consecutive FA Cup final,\u201d notes Chai. \u201cHas any other club suffered the heartbreak of losing as many or more consecutive finals in the same tournament?\u201d  \u201cChelsea have been involved in five penalty shootouts this season: Villarreal, Aston Villa, Southampton and Liverpool twice. Is that a record?\u201d asks Stuart Corby. And on that note \u2026  \u201cAs a Bristol City fan, it hurt seeing Rovers get promoted, but I have to concede it was an amazing effort. It was especially incredible as they\u2019d only spent the last five minutes (plus a lot of added time) of the season in the top three. Can this be beaten? And what is the shortest time spent at the summit to win a title?\u201d muses Neil McCormick.   Mail us your questions or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU. "

                    "body": "The Saudi Arabian crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, arrived in the Turkish capital, Ankara, with a full ceremonial welcome, the beginning of a state visit ending years of animosity between the two countries that peaked with the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018. The crown prince, sometimes known as MBS, was greeted with a grand procession on horseback and a state band. He grinned broadly as he stood alongside the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, who shook his hand with a small smile before the two leaders disappeared behind the gold doors of the presidential palace to begin one-on-one talks.  \u201cGod willing, we will have the opportunity to assess to what much higher level we can take Turkey-Saudi Arabia relations,\u201d Erdo\u011fan said, announcing the sudden visit late last week. The visit, including a private meeting and a state dinner, is expected to yield significant trade deals from Turkey. The crown prince\u2019s arrival followed visits to Cairo and Jordan, his most significant international trip since December 2018 when he was met with protests in Tunisia and objections from Algerian journalists and intellectuals who called his visit \u201cunethical and politically inappropriate\u201d. Prince Mohammed\u2019s visit to Ankara also represents a major shift in Middle Eastern politics and the latest efforts to welcome Saudi Arabia back into the international community after pledges to isolate the kingdom because of Khashoggi\u2019s murder. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, visited Riyadh last December, while Boris Johnson visited in March to discuss increasing oil production. Asl\u0131 Ayd\u0131nta\u015fba\u015f, of the European Council on Foreign Relations thinktank, said: \u201cI highly doubt that Turkey\u2019s assessment of what happened to Khashoggi and how it happened has changed. But clearly they had to give these concessions to the Saudis and organise a public meeting, as that is the price of normalisation. \u201cPart of the Saudi demand for any possible normalisation and improved economic relationship has been a public declaration of this kiss-and-make-up. Turkey may have preferred to have more of a behind-the-scenes private de-escalation and normalisation, but the Saudi government very much wanted to make this public display and official recognition part of the normalisation between two countries.\u201d The US president, Joe Biden, is scheduled to visit Saudi Arabia and meet Prince Mohammed next month, a decision that rights activists and dissidents described as a \u201cbetrayal\u201d of his previous promises to make the kingdom \u201ca pariah\u201d. Biden\u2019s visit comes a year and a half after he agreed to declassify an intelligence report which found that the crown prince \u201capproved\u201d the operation to murder Khashoggi. \u201cWe can learn from the past that MBS is not a reliable partner, so what are we doing here?\u201d said Agn\u00e8s Callamard, the head of Amnesty International, discussing Biden\u2019s upcoming meeting. \u201cA reliable partner does not kill one of their journalists in a foreign country, or use surveillance technology worldwide. A reliable partner does not keep on bombing Yemen for no reason. That\u2019s not a reliable partner.\u201d Hatice Cengiz, Khashoggi\u2019s fiancee and a Turkish citizen, tweeted: \u201cHis visit to our country doesn\u2019t change the fact that he is responsible for a murder. The political legitimacy he earns through the visits he makes to a different country every day doesn\u2019t change the fact that he is a murderer.\u201d Erdo\u011fan previously spearheaded international efforts to condemn Khashoggi\u2019s murder, calling Turkey \u201cthe representative of the world\u2019s common conscience\u201d in a speech in October 2018. The Turkish president also persistently publicised detailed information about the killing, including a gruesome transcript of an audio recording from inside the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul as it took place. \u201cWe know the order to kill Khashoggi came from the highest levels of the Saudi government,\u201d he wrote in a 2018 op-ed for the Washington Post. He added: \u201cI do not believe for a second that King Salman, the custodian of the holy mosques, ordered the hit on Khashoggi.\u201d That indicated he believed Prince Mohammed to be responsible. Erdo\u011fan moved to reset relations with countries across the region late last year, overhauling relations with Israel and the Gulf while taking steps to heal a longstanding rift with Egypt. The decision also marked a realignment of regional politics after the decision by a coalition of Gulf nations and Egypt to blockade Turkey\u2019s ally Qatar in 2017. In the throes of Turkey\u2019s foreign policy reset in April, Turkish prosecutors requested that the trial of 26 Saudi intelligence agents accused of killing Khashoggi be transferred to the kingdom, effectively annulling the proceedings. Erdo\u011fan visited Saudi Arabia later that month, where pictures of his meeting with Prince Mohammed showed him embracing the grinning crown prince stony-faced. The Turkish president also visited former regional opponents in Abu Dhabi for the first time in a decade in February, following a visit by the then crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, to Ankara last November. The visits proved lucrative for Turkey at a crucial time, after the steep devaluation of the Turkish lira by almost half the previous year. In January, the UAE and Turkey announced an almost $5bn (\u00a34.073bn) currency swap deal to bolster reserves in Ankara\u2019s central bank, following the creation of a $10bn (\u00a38.16m) fund for Emirati investment in Turkey. \u201cErdo\u011fan clearly wants to focus on domestic issues and is also quite desperate to raise funds for Turkey,\u201d said Ayd\u0131nta\u015fba\u015f. \u201cHe\u2019s also changing his agenda towards the Middle East, where, after the Arab spring, Turkey\u2019s line was support for bottom-up change. \u201cThat mission and that goal is now entirely abandoned, an admission on Turkey\u2019s part of the longevity of Gulf monarchies and also a pragmatic decision to want to do business with them.\u201d A general election is also expected in Turkey next year or before, one where the economy is likely to play a key role, and polls have shown Erdo\u011fan facing a mounting challenge from his opponents. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that Erdo\u011fan is absolutely cornered domestically because of the economy and because of the declining popularity of his party, so he wants to de-escalate with regional rivals to at least tick that box, and focus on the domestic saga at home,\u201d said Ayd\u0131nta\u015fba\u015f."

                    "body": "\n 1.57am  \nSummary\n\nBefore we close today\u2019s live blog, here is a comprehensive run-down of where things currently stand.\n\nThe US will send Ukraine four sophisticated, medium-range rocket systems and ammunition to help try to stall Russian progress in the Donbas region. The rocket systems are part of a new $700m tranche of security assistance that also includes helicopters, Javelin anti-tank weapon systems, radars, tactical vehicles, spare parts and more. It will take at least three weeks to get the precision weapons and trained troops onto the battlefield, the Pentagon said.\n\n\nRussia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said the supply of US advanced rocket systems to Ukraine increases the risk of a \u201cthird country\u201d being dragged into the conflict. Lavrov\u2019s deputy, Sergei Ryabkov, said that Moscow viewed US military aid to Ukraine \u201cextremely negatively\u201d and that it would increase the risk of a direct confrontation. The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov added: \u201cWe believe that the United States is purposefully and diligently adding fuel to the fire.\u201d\n\n\nThe US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said Ukraine has given \u201cassurances\u201d that it will not use long-range weapons systems provided by Washington against targets on Russian territory.\n\n\nFollowing Biden\u2019s announcement, the UK has reportedly asked the US to sign off on a plan to send advanced, medium-range rocket systems to Ukraine within a few weeks. Britain\u2019s prime minister, Boris Johnson, spoke with Biden about the transfer of US-made M270 multiple launch rocket systems, which will be followed by a discussion between his foreign secretary, Liz Truss, and the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, on Thursday, Politico cited a source as saying.\n\n\nRussian forces now control more than two-thirds of the key eastern Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk, according to the regional governor of Luhansk. \u201cUnfortunately, today, Russian troops control most of the city,\u201d Serhiy Gaidai said, adding that a number of civilians are sheltering from Russian shelling under a chemical plant. The expected loss of Sievierodonetsk, the largest still held by Kyiv in the Luhansk region, \u201cis unlikely to be the crux\u201d of Russia\u2019s Donbas campaign, a western official said.\n\n\nUkraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, conceded that Kyiv\u2019s forces are currently suffering up to 100 fatalities and 500 wounded every day. The most difficult situation is in the east of Ukraine and southern Donetsk and Luhansk, Zelenskiy said in an interview with the US Newsmax television channel. Western officials said Ukraine\u2019s estimate that it is losing 60 to 100 troops a day killed is \u201cpretty credible\u201d.\n\n\nA Russian missile hit rail lines in the western Lviv region, a key conduit for supplies of western weapons and other supplies, officials said. Lviv regional governor Maksym Kozytskiy said five people were wounded in the strike. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to the country\u2019s interior minister, said the Russians hit the Beskidy railway tunnel in the Carpathian Mountains in an apparent effort to cut a key railway link and disrupt shipments of weapons and fuel.\n\n\nRussia said it has completed testing of its hypersonic Zircon cruise missile and will deploy it before the end of the year on a new frigate of its Northern Fleet. President Vladimir Putin has described the Zircon as part of a new generation of unrivalled arms systems, travelling at nine times the speed of sound.\n\n\nRussian troops have been accused of committing acts of torture against residents in the Russian-controlled Kherson region in southern Ukraine. The BBC has gathered multiple first-hand testimonies from Kherson residents who say they were tortured while in the hands of Russian forces.\n\n\nDenmark has voted overwhelmingly to join the EU\u2019s common defence policy, becoming the last of the bloc\u2019s members to sign up. The referendum on Wednesday, in which voters backed the government\u2019s proposal by 66.9% to 33.1%, followed historic applications by Denmark\u2019s previously non-aligned Nordic neighbours, Finland and Sweden, to join Nato last month.\n\n\nNato\u2019s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said he will convene a meeting in Brussels in the coming days with senior officials from Sweden, Finland and Turkey to discuss Turkey\u2019s opposition to Sweden and Finland joining the alliance. Blinken said there was a \u201cstrong consensus within Nato, broadly, to support the rapid accession of Sweden and Finland\u201d to Nato and he was confident it would happen.\n\nThat\u2019s all from me, Samantha Lock, for now. Please join me a little a later when we launch our new live blog covering all the latest developments from Ukraine.\n\n\n\n 1.41am  \n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has claimed 200,000 children are among the Ukrainians who have been forcefully taken to Russia, including children from orphanages, children taken with their parents and those separated from their families.\nZelenskiy made note of International Children\u2019s Day during his nightly video address to the nation on Wednesday, claiming 243 children have been killed so far in the war, 446 have been wounded and 139 are missing.\n\nThe purpose of this criminal policy is not just to steal people but to make those who are deported forget about Ukraine and unable to return.\n\n\u201cUkraine cannot be conquered, that our people will not surrender and our children will not become the property of the occupiers.\u201d\n\n\n\n 12.59am  \n\nRussian forces now control more than two-thirds of the key eastern Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk, according to the regional governor of Luhansk. \nSerhiy Gaidai said a number of civilians are sheltering from Russian shelling under a chemical plant while the Ukrainian head of the city administration, Oleksandr Stryuk, said Ukrainian forces are holding just 20% of the city, the largest still held by Kyiv in the Luhansk region. \nThe expected loss of Sievierodonetsk \u201cis unlikely to be the crux\u201d of Russia\u2019s Donbas campaign, a western official said.\n\n\n\n\n\n 12.35am  \n\nResidents of the eastern city of Sloviansk in the Donetsk region fear a full Russian assault after their city came under rocket attack late on Tuesday. \nThe missiles struck a residential area, damaging and burning nearby vehicles. According to the regional governor, at least three people were killed and six were wounded in the eastern Donetsk region.\n\n\n\n\n 11.59pm  \nSummary\n\nIt\u2019s 2am in Kyiv. Here\u2019s where things stand: \n\nBrazilian football legend Pele on Wednesday called for Russian President Vladimir Putin to end his army\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, as the war-torn country\u2019s national team was set to vie for a World Cup spot. Pele recalled meeting Putin in the past and exchanging \u201csmiles accompanied by a long handshake.\u201d \u201cThe power to stop this conflict is in your hands. The same ones I shook in Moscow, at our last meeting in 2017,\u201d he wrote. The match in Glasgow is the first for the Ukrainian national team since the invasion began.\nA regional governor in western Ukraine said a Russian airstrike on transport infrastructure wounded two people Wednesday. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to the country\u2019s interior minister, said the Russians hit the Beskidy railway tunnel in the Carpathian Mountains in an apparent effort to cut a key railway link and disrupt shipments of weapons and fuel. \nThe Senate of Ireland passed a resolution on Wednesday declaring the Russian invasion of Ukraine a \u201cgenocide.\u201d \u201cThe acts carried out by the Russian military meet the criteria for genocide set out in the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, and as such, the illegal invasion of Ukraine by by the Russian Federation is an act of genocide,\u201d the resolution stated.\nDenmark has voted to join the EU\u2019s defence policy. Wednesday\u2019s referendum signals the latest shift among Nordic countries to deepen defence ties in response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Denmark was the only EU member that was not part of the bloc\u2019s defence and security policy, after the country secured several exemptions in a 1993 referendum. \nThe Ukraine Presidential Commissioner for Children\u2019s Rights and Children\u2019s Rehabilitation announced on Wednesday that over 234,000 Ukrainian children have been deported since the war began. \u201cAccording to open sources, as of today, more than 234,000 children have crossed the border to Russia and temporarily occupied territories of Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts. These are forcibly deported, forcibly displaced children either to the temporarily occupied territories, or to Russia or the Republic of Belarus,\u201d the commissioner said.\nThe head of Interpol raised alarms on Wednesday about a possible uptick in weapons trafficking once the war in Ukraine end. Interpol Secretary-General Jurgen Stock told the Anglo-American Press Association that he has \u201cno doubt\u201d illegal arms trafficking will increase. Stock encouraged Interpol\u2019s 195-member countries to \u201cintensively use available databases that can help trace and track weapons, for instance those stolen in another country.\u201d\nThe Pentagon announced on Wednesday that the US will send Ukraine four sophisticated, medium-range rocket systems and ammunition to help try to stall Russian progress in the Donbas region of its country. The rocket systems are part of a new $700m tranche of security assistance for Ukraine from the US that also includes helicopters, Javelin anti-tank weapon systems, radars, tactical vehicles, spare parts and more.\n\nThat\u2019s it from me, Maya Yang, today as I hand the blog over to my colleague in Australia, Samantha Lock. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow, thank you.\n\n\n\n 11.17pm  \n\nBrazilian football legend Pele called Wednesday for Russian President Vladimir Putin to end his army\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, as the war-torn country\u2019s national team was set to vie for a World Cup spot, Agence France-Presse reports. \n\n\u201cToday Ukraine tries to forget, at least for 90 minutes, the tragedy that still engulfs their country,\u201d Pele wrote in an open letter to Putin, posted on Instagram just before the Ukrainian men\u2019s football team faced Scotland in a World Cup playoff semi-final.\n\n\n\u201cI want to use today\u2019s match as an opportunity to make a request: stop the invasion. There is absolutely no justification for this continued violence,\u201d added the three-time World Cup champion.\n\n\n\u201cThis conflict is wicked, unjustifiable and brings nothing but pain, fear, terror and anguish... Wars only exist to separate nations, and there\u2019s no ideology that justifies projectile missiles burying the dreams of children, ruining families and killing the innocent.\u201d\n\nPele recalled meeting Putin in the past and exchanging \u201csmiles accompanied by a long handshake.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe power to stop this conflict is in your hands. The same ones I shook in Moscow, at our last meeting in 2017,\u201d he wrote.\n\nConsidered by many the greatest footballer of all time, Pele had one of the most storied careers in sport, scoring more than 1,000 goals before retiring in 1977.\nHis message comes as the Ukraine conflict nears its 100th day, with fierce fighting ongoing in the nation\u2019s east, after the Russian army failed in its bid to overtake Kyiv.\nThe match in Glasgow is the first for the Ukrainian national team since the invasion began.\nThe winners will face Wales on Sunday to decide who will be the final member of Group B - alongside England, the United States and Iran.\n\n\n\n\n 10.41pm  \n\nA regional governor in western Ukraine said a Russian airstrike on transport infrastructure wounded two people Wednesday, the Associated Press reports. \nLviv region Gov. Maksym Kozytskyy didn\u2019t name the target of the Russian strike near the city of Lviv.\nAnton Gerashchenko, an adviser to the country\u2019s interior minister, said the Russians hit the Beskidy railway tunnel in the Carpathian Mountains in an apparent effort to cut a key railway link and disrupt shipments of weapons and fuel.\nThe Lviv region has served as a key conduit for supplies of Western weapons and other supplies.\n\n\n\n 9.54pm  \n\nThe Senate of Ireland passed a resolution on Wednesday declaring the Russian invasion of Ukraine a \u201cgenocide.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cThe acts carried out by the Russian military meet the criteria for genocide set out in the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, and as such, the illegal invasion of Ukraine by by the Russian Federation is an act of genocide,\u201d the resolution stated. \n\n\n\n\n 9.25pm  \nDenmark will join the EU's defence policy, public broadcaster DR projects.\n\nDenmark will join the European Union\u2019s defence policy after a referendum on Wednesday, public broadcaster DR projected, signalling the latest shift among Nordic countries to deepen defence ties in response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, Reuters reports. \nDenmark is the only EU member that is not part of the bloc\u2019s defence and security policy, after the country secured several exemptions in a 1993 referendum.\nPreliminary results by DR showed 66.6% of voters were in favour of removing an opt-out to the EU\u2019s so-called Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). Almost 34 percent of voters polled were opposed, but the outcome will not change, according to DR.\n\n\u201cIt is a completely new approach to Europe, that we are signalling to our European allies, to the whole world,\u201d said former foreign minister and member of the Social Liberal Party, Martin Lidegaard.\n\n\n\u201cIt can hardly be overestimated, the importance it has on our foreign and European policy,\u201d Lidegaard said.\n\nIn the CSDP Denmark would be able to take part in joint military operations, such as those in Somalia, Mali and Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to cooperate on acquisition of joint military capabilities.\n\n\u201cThe United States has said it very clearly. Europe must be more responsible for security, and I think it makes good sense to be part of that cooperation instead of constantly hoping for the U.S. to come,\u201d said Conservative People\u2019s Party leader Soren Pape.\n\n\n\n\n\n 8.35pm  \n\nDaria Herasymchuk, the Ukraine Presidential Commissioner for Children\u2019s Rights and Children\u2019s Rehabilitation announced on Wednesday that over 234,000 Ukrainian children have been deported since the war began. \n\n\n\u201cAccording to open sources, as of today, more than 234,000 children have crossed the border to Russia and temporarily occupied territories of Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts. These are forcibly deported, forcibly displaced children either to the temporarily occupied territories, or to Russia or the Republic of Belarus,\u201d Herasymchuk said.\n\n\n\u201cWe will fight for absolutely every Ukrainian child. Today we can also say that the world of adults has failed Children\u2019s Day in Ukraine,\u201d she added.\n\n\n\n\n\n 7.57pm  \n\nThe head of Interpol, an international organization that that facilitates worldwide police cooperation and crime control, raised alarms on Wednesday about a possible uptick in weapons trafficking once the war in Ukraine ends, the Associated Press reports.\nInterpol Secretary-General Jurgen Stock told the Anglo-American Press Association that he has \u201cno doubt\u201d illegal arms trafficking will increase.\n\n\u201cWe have seen that in the Balkans region,\u201d Stock said. \u201cWe have seen that in theaters in Africa that, of course, organized crime groups try to exploit this chaotic situation, availability of weapons and even weapons that are used by the military.\u201d\n\nSmall weapons are the main concern, he said.\nStock encouraged Interpol\u2019s 195-member countries to \u201cintensively use available databases that can help trace and track weapons, for instance those stolen in another country.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo country in our region can deal with it in isolation because the criminals I\u2019m talking about are operating globally,\u201d Stock said.\n\nInterpol, based in Lyon, France, does not carry out investigations but provides training for police and customs officers to, for instance, identify trafficking routes, Stock said.\n\n\n\n 7.35pm  \n\nThe Pentagon announced on Wednesday that the US will send Ukraine four sophisticated, medium-range rocket systems and ammunition to help try to stall Russian progress in the Donbas region of its country, the Associated Press reports. \nIt will take at least three weeks to get the precision weapons and trained troops onto the battlefield, the Pentagon added. \nThe rocket systems are part of a new $700m tranche of security assistance for Ukraine from the US that also includes helicopters, Javelin anti-tank weapon systems, radars, tactical vehicles, spare parts and more.\nAsked if the weapons are arriving too late to make a difference, as Russia makes progress in the east and south, Colin Kahl, the defense undersecretary for policy, said he doesn\u2019t think so.\n\n\u201cIt is a grinding fight,\u201d he said during a Pentagon briefing. \u201cWe believe that these additional capabilities will arrive in a timeframe that\u2019s relevant and allow the Ukrainians to very precisely target the types of things they need for the current fight.\u201d\n\nThe Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Wednesday that the US is \u201cdeliberately and diligently pouring fuel on the fire.\u201d He added that the Kremlin doesn\u2019t trust Kyiv\u2019s assurances that the multiple rocket launch systems supplied by the US will not be used to attack Russia.\n\n\u201cIn order to trust [someone], you need to have experience with situations when such promises were kept. Regretfully, there is no such experience whatsoever,\u201d Peskov said.\n\nIt\u2019s the 11th package approved so far and will be the first to tap the $40bn in security and economic assistance recently passed by Congress. The rocket systems would be part of Pentagon drawdown authority, so would involve taking weapons from US inventory and getting them into Ukraine quickly. Ukrainian troops would also need training on the new systems, which could take at least a week or two.\nOfficials said the plan is to send Ukraine the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or Himars, which is mounted on a truck and can carry a container with six rockets. The system can launch a medium-range rocket, which is the current plan, but is also capable of firing a longer-range missile, the Army Tactical Missile System, which has a range of about 190 miles and is not part of the plan.\n\nUpdated at 7.43pm BST\n\n\n 7.01pm  \nSummary\n\nIt\u2019s 9pm in Kyiv. Here\u2019s where we stand:\n\nThe US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said Ukraine has given \u201cassurances\u201d that it will not use long-range weapons systems provided by Washington against targets on Russian territory. Blinken\u2019s remarks came after the US president, Joe Biden, confirmed he will send the more advanced, longer-range rocket systems to Kyiv, a critical weapon that Ukrainian leaders have been asking for as they struggle to stall Russian progress in the Donbas region. \n\n\nFollowing Biden\u2019s announcement, the UK has reportedly asked the US to sign off on a plan to send advanced, medium-range rocket systems to Ukraine within a few weeks.

Soldiers held out for weeks in the warren of tunnels, warehouses and cooling blast furnaces as they and hundreds of civilians sheltering with them were encircled and eventually forced to surrender.\nThe site produced 40% of Ukraine\u2019s entire steel output and was the key asset of the country\u2019s biggest pre-war employer, Metinvest. Now its owner has an important role to play in the parallel battle to sustain the economy via its other plants outside occupied territory, according to its chief executive, Yuriy Ryzhenkov.\n\n\u201cThe war effort is not only what you supply to the army, but also how [the] economy functions,\u201d the Metinvest boss says, speaking via videolink from a company office in Lviv, western Ukraine. \u201cSo the better the economy functions, the better the country can fight a war. \n\nIn our view, in my personal view the people who are now at our steel mills are just as important to the victory of Ukraine as the soldiers on the frontline.\n\nRyzhenkov was in the capital, Kyiv, when he first heard Russian weaponry signalling the start of the invasion and was stunned that Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime would launch open warfare. The company has since adjusted to operating in a warzone, but at least 153 Metinvest employees have died in the fighting.\nBeyond keeping money flowing through the economy, the metals and mining group is playing a direct role in the war effort, delivering steel for 1,500 bulletproof vests a week to Ukraine\u2019s armed forces, and importing military equipment such as drones, night-vision headsets and helmets.\nIt is a remarkable shift for a company whose main shareholder \u2013 Ukraine\u2019s richest man, Rinat Akhmetov \u2013 was as recently as November cited by the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, as a target to be recruited to back a possible coup attempt. Zelenskiy said Akhmetov was not involved in the plot, and the oligarch said claims of moves to draw him in were \u201can absolute lie\u201d.\nRead Jasper Jolly\u2019s full article \u2013 Boss of devastated Azovstal plant: \u2018Steel is as key to Ukraine\u2019s victory as soldiers\u2019\n\n\nUpdated at 6.28pm BST\n\n\n 5.55pm  \n\nThe UK has reportedly asked the US to sign off on a plan to send advanced, medium-range rocket systems to Ukraine within a few weeks, following President Joe Biden\u2019s announcement that he will send similar weapons.\nBritain\u2019s prime minister, Boris Johnson, spoke with Biden about the transfer of US-made M270 multiple launch rocket systems this morning, Politico reports, citing a person familiar with the matter. \nThe meeting will then be followed by a discussion between his foreign secretary, Liz Truss, and the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, on Thursday, the source said.\nThe UK would be the first country to send the US-made MLRS, the news site reports.

As always, feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. \n\nUpdated at 5.08pm BST\n\n\n 4.40pm  \n\nThe expected loss of Sievierodonetsk \u201cis unlikely to be the crux\u201d of Russia\u2019s Donbas campaign, a Western official said, in a war that could now grind on \u201cto the end of the year\u201d given the slow rate of Moscow\u2019s advance.\nThe average gain of Russian forces in Popansa south of Sievierodonetsk has \u201caveraged between 500m and 1 kilometre\u201d a day in the last month, the official added, meaning capturing the remainder of the Donetsk region in the Donbas would take months more at least.\nRussia would have to achieve \u201cfurther challenging operational objectives\u201d to declare victory on the Kremlin\u2019s now reduced campaign terms, the official said. That would require taking the city of Kramatorsk, more of the M04 main road between the Ukrainian-held city of Dnipro and the Russian-held city of Donetsk, they added, and more rivers would have to be crossed in the process.\nThe official said in a briefing:\n\nAlthough we see Russia is starting to learn from its mistakes and make advances in the Donbas, I think it\u2019s important to stress that the battle for Sievierodonetsk is is unlikely to be the kind of the crux of the Donetsk campaign.\n\nRussian casualty rates were dropping because of the increasingly concentrated fighting in the Donbas, and were probably \u201cnot necessarily significantly more\u201d than a previous estimate of 15,000 killed given in April. The number of Russians wounded, since the war began, is estimated at about 40,000. \nThe west believes that Ukraine\u2019s estimate that it is losing 60 to 100 troops a day killed in the current fighting is \u201cpretty credible\u201d although troop morale remains far higher than the invaders, where the official argued there was \u201cgrowing disillusionment\u201d with Russia\u2019s slow-moving campaign among junior soldiers and more senior ranks.\nRussia may slow down its offensive after capturing Sievierodonetsk to regroup, in what could amount to a pause. \nThe official said it was unlikely the Russian invaders would be \u201cin a position to continue to exploit immediately\u201d once the city, the last held by Ukraine in the Luhansk region, fell. Instead, Moscow\u2019s forces could be forced into \u201ca kind of an operational pause\u201d to \u201creconstitute and resupply\u201d, they said.\n\nUpdated at 4.57pm BST\n\n\n 4.34pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 4.22pm  \nUkraine 'will not use US weapons to strike Russia', says Blinken\n\n\nThe US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has been speaking at a joint news conference with Nato\u2019s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, where he said Ukraine has given \u201cassurances\u201d that it will not use long-range weapons systems provided by Washington against targets on Russian territory.\nThe new weapons package heading to Ukraine is \u201cprecisely what they need\u201d and will strengthen their hand at any negotiations in the future, he said.\nRegarding concerns about Russia interpreting the weapons package to Ukraine as escalatory, Blinken said that the US president, Joe Biden, had been clear with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, about the consequences of the Russian invasion.\nBlinken said:\n\nThere was no hiding the ball. We\u2019ve been extremely clear about this from day one with President Biden communicating that directly to President Putin. So we have done exactly what we said we would do.\n\nHe said Putin had wanted less Nato but instead, \u201che is getting more Nato, more troops and more members\u201d. \nThe US cannot predict how long the conflict will continue, Blinken continued, but it will make sure Ukraine is equipped with what it needs to defend itself effectively. \nBlinken said:\n\nWe can\u2019t predict how this is going to play out, when this is going to play out. As best we can assess right now, we are still looking at many months of conflict.\n\n\nUpdated at 6.31pm BST\n\n\n 3.58pm  \n\nRussia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said the supply of US advanced rocket systems to Ukraine increases the risk of a \u201cthird country\u201d being dragged into the conflict.\nHis remarks came after the US president, Joe Biden, confirmed he will send more medium-range high mobility artillery rocket systems to Ukraine as part of a new weapons package to be unveiled today.\nSpeaking at a news conference in Saudi Arabia, Lavrov also said Russia is facing difficulties exporting grain due to sanctions against its ships, Reuters reports. \nLavrov said:\n\nThere are also problems with the export of Russian grain... Vessels that carry Russian grain have fallen under sanctions.\n\n\n\n\n 3.43pm  \n\nAbout 15,000 Russian troops have been killed and 40,000 wounded since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, western officials have estimated.\nOur Dan Sabbagh writes that Russia\u2019s previously high casualty rate has dropped significantly since its focus of attack has narrowed. \nOfficials have also supported Ukraine\u2019s count that its forces are losing between 60 and 100 soldiers each day in the battle in the Donbas.\n\n\n\n\nUpdated at 3.53pm BST\n\n\n 3.24pm  \n\nDenmark is voting on whether to join the EU\u2019s common defence policy, potentially becoming the last of the bloc\u2019s members to sign up as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine continues to reshape Europe\u2019s security landscape.\nThe referendum on Wednesday, in which voters are thought likely to back the government\u2019s proposal, follows historic applications by Denmark\u2019s previously non-aligned Nordic neighbours, Finland and Sweden, to join Nato last month.\nDenmark, historically critical of the EU, secured exemptions from joining both the bloc\u2019s security and defence policy and the euro in a 1993 referendum, but the country\u2019s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said it was time to change tack.\n\u201cUnfortunately we are looking forward to a time that will be even more unstable than what we are experiencing now,\u201d Frederiksen said after casting her vote. \n\nI believe it is the right thing for Europe, the right thing for Denmark, the right thing for our future.\n\nFrederiksen called the referendum barely two weeks after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine after reaching an agreement with a majority of parties in the Danish parliament, also pledging to increase defence spending to 2% of GDP, in line with Nato membership requirements, by 2033.\n\n\n\n\n 3.12pm  \n\nThe US military is conducting offensive hacking operations in support of Ukraine, according to the head of US cyber command, Gen Paul Nakasone.\nUS military hackers have \u201cconducted a series of operations\u201d in response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, Nakasone confirmed in an interview with Sky News.\nNakasone said:\n\nWe\u2019ve conducted a series of operations across the full spectrum; offensive, defensive, [and] information operations.\n\nHe did not detail the activities but said they were lawful, conducted with civilian oversight of the military and through US defence department policy.\nHe also said he is concerned \u201cevery single day\u201d about the risk of a Russian cyber attack targeting the US and said \u201chunt forward\u201d operations were allowing the US to search out foreign hackers and identify their tools before they were used against America.\n\nUpdated at 3.19pm BST\n\n\n 2.59pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 2.39pm  \n\nThere has been another Telegram update from Serhiy Haidai, governor of Luhansk, this time with what he says is good news \u2013 a successful evacuation. He posted:\n\nThe mountain community suffers daily from enemy shelling, the racists level the settlements with artillery and aircraft. The hottest in Toshkivka and Zolote, orcs [a slang term for Russian forces] deliberately roam the high-rises. It was extremely difficult to drive, the road is constantly under fire, but our heroes broke through \u2013 brought in ambulances and evacuated nine people \u2013 retirees and people with limited mobility.\n\nHaidai goes on to claim that the people are now safe.\n\n\n\n 2.06pm  \n\nA Ukrainian MP has warned of an impending famine if action is not taken to unblock the country\u2019s ports and release millions of tonnes of grain.\nPA Media reports Kira Rudik, leader of the liberal Voice party, was speaking to journalists at the Scottish Parliament. \n\u201cBefore the war, Ukraine was top three of the countries producing grains: wheat, sunflower oil, tomatoes and corn,\u201d Rudik said.\nExports that could feed the rest of the world, the MP said, were stuck in ports in Ukraine with \u201cno way of getting them out\u201d.\n\u201cIn 10 weeks, we are facing famine, especially for countries in the [global] south. We need a unified approach to help unblock our ports and help get all this harvest out.\u201d\nRudik said she raised the issue in a meeting with Westminster Conservative MP, Tobias Ellwood, the chair of the defence select committee, adding: \u201cThis is a humanitarian mission that needs to happen, not for the Ukrainian good but for the good of the whole world.\u201d\nRudik was interviewed by our defence and security editor Dan Sabbagh earlier in the week: Ukrainian MP urges west to supply long-range rockets or risk Russian victory\n\n\nUpdated at 2.34pm BST\n\n\n 1.41pm  \n\nThe UN\u2019s secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said he was hopeful of easing the food crisis prompted by the war in Ukraine, but warned that \u201cwe are not yet there\u201d in terms of reaching any agreement to unblock shipments of commodities such as grain.\nSpeaking at a news conference with Sweden\u2019s prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, in Stockholm, Guterres said:\n\nI think that there is progress, but we are not yet there. These are complex things and the fact that everything is interlinked makes the negotiation particularly complex.\n\n\nGuterres has been attempting to broker what he calls a package deal to resume both Ukrainian food exports and Russian food and fertiliser exports. He said:\n\nAs I said to the security council, I\u2019m hopeful, but there is still a ways to go and we are totally committed to make things happen.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.20pm BST\n\n\n 1.32pm  \nJust 20% of Sievierodonetsk in Ukrainian hands, says official\n\nUkrainian forces are holding just 20% of the eastern city of Sievierodonetsk, the largest still held by Kyiv in the Luhansk region, according to the Ukrainian head of the city administration, Oleksandr Stryuk.\nThere is still hope, however, that Ukrainian forces can prevent Russia from taking full control of the city, he said.\nRussian forces now control 60% of the city while the rest has become \u201cno-man\u2019s land\u201d, Stryuk told Reuters.\nStryuk said:\n\nThe 20% is being fiercely defended by our armed forces. Our troops are holding defensive lines. Attempts are being made to drive out the Russian troops.\nWe have hope that despite everything we will free the city and not allow it to be completely occupied\n\nEarlier today, Ukraine\u2019s governor of Luhansk, Serhiy Haidai, said Russia now \u201ccontrols 70% of Sievierodonetsk\u201d and that Ukrainian troops had \u201cretreated to more advantageous, pre-prepared positions\u201d.\nBetween 12,000 to 13,000 people remain in the city and it was impossible to get food or aid in or to get people out, Stryuk said.\nThere was no information on how many people have died in the city in recent days, he added.\n\n\n\n 1.07pm  \n\nResidents of Sievierodonetsk, Luhansk, were told yesterday to remain in bomb shelters after a strike on a chemical factory created a toxic cloud. \nThis footage shows brown plumes of gas ascending after a container with chemicals was blown up at the Azot chemical works. \nThe factory, one of Ukraine\u2019s biggest chemical works, employs about 7,000 people.\n\n\nUpdated at 1.48pm BST\n\n\n 12.57pm  \nZelenskiy: Ukraine losing up to 100 soldiers every day\n\nUkraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has conceded that Kyiv\u2019s forces are currently suffering up to 100 fatalities and 500 wounded every day.\nIn an interview with the US Newsmax television channel that aired yesterday, Zelenskiy said:\n\nThe situation is very difficult; we\u2019re losing 60-100 soldiers per day as killed in action and something around 500 people as wounded in action. So we are holding our defensive perimeters.\n\nThe most difficult situation is in the east of Ukraine and southern Donetsk and Luhansk, Zelenskiy added.\n\nUkraine and its people are the \u201cdefensive perimeter\u201d for the world against Vladimir Putin\u2019s aggression, he told the channel.\n\nWe have to realise who is the dark power: it\u2019s Russia. And Russia is not going to stop in Ukraine, for sure. The other countries, the former Republics of USSR and the members of the EU \u2013 some of them are already Nato member nations \u2013 they\u2019re already under threat.\n\nThe Ukrainian president called out the \u201cweakness\u201d of Putin and Russia, not only in failing to occupy a smaller neighbouring nation but also in attempts to take him out as leader.\nHe said:\n\nAttempting to kill the leader of this or that country is a weakness, I would say. If you can\u2019t talk, then it\u2019s a weakness.\n\nPutin cannot win, and the world must stop defending him amid the latest \u201catrocities\u201d committed by Russian troops, he continued, while also calling out the lack of fully enforcing sanctions.\n\nNow, he\u2019s almost isolated. The world always keeps giving him a chance, because the sanctions are not imposed completely. There\u2019s gaps in some of the leaders saying the Russian leader should be offered with a way out.\n\n\n\n\n 12.41pm  \nRussian troops accused of torture of Kherson residents, reports say\n\nRussian troops have been accused of committing acts of torture against residents in the Russian-controlled Kherson region in southern Ukraine. \nThe BBC has gathered multiple first-hand testimonies from Kherson residents who say they were tortured while in the hands of Russian forces. In one case, Olexander Guz, a deputy in the village of Bilozerka in the Kherson region, said he was left with severe bruising after being beaten.\n\u201cThey put a bag on my head,\u201d he said. \n\nThe Russians threatened that I would not have kidneys left.\n\nOleh Baturin, a journalist for an independent newspaper in the Kherson region, said he was kidnapped and imprisoned by Russian forces for more than a week.\nDuring his imprisonment, he said he heard others being tortured and witnessed a young man\u2019s mock execution. He himself was beaten \u201con the back, ribs and legs\u201d with \u201cthe butt of a machine gun\u201d and suffered four broken ribs. \nThe BBC spoke to a doctor who worked in a hospital in Kherson, who said he has seen signs of electrocution, traces of binding on the hands and strangulation marks on the neck, as well as burns on people\u2019s feet and hands. \n\nUpdated at 12.48pm BST\n\n\n 12.08pm  \n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has been speaking at his regular conference call with reporters, where he blamed \u201cillegal restrictions\u201d imposed on Russia by western countries for a potential \u201cvery deep\u201d food crisis.\nRussia has been blockading Ukrainian ports but is trying to pin the blame for the lack of grain shipments on western sanctions and on Kyiv itself. \nPeskov told reporters today:\n\nWe are potentially on the verge of a very deep food crisis linked to the introduction of illegal restrictions against us and the actions of Ukrainian authorities who have mined the path to the Black Sea and are not shipping grain from there despite Russia not impeding in any way.\n\nHis remarks come after European leaders appealed to African countries, who are facing \u201ca catastrophic scenario\u201d of food shortages and price rises, not to fall for the Kremlin\u2019s propaganda campaign that paints the impending global food crisis as the result of western sanctions against Russia. \nPeskov also warned that the EU\u2019s sanctions on Russian oil would hit the global energy market, but said Moscow could re-route exports to limit its own losses.\nHe did not rule out a meeting between Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, but said talks needed to be prepared in advance.\nPeskov said work on a peace document with Ukraine had stopped a long time ago and had not restarted.\n\nUpdated at 12.13pm BST\n\n\n 11.33am  \n\nFuel believed to be partially made from Russian crude reached US shores despite a ban on all imports of Russian oil, gas and energy, according to reports. \nTraders are attempting to evade US sanctions by obscuring the origins of Russian oil, concealing the oil in blended refined products such as gasoline, diesel and chemicals, the Wall Street Journal reports.\nThe cargoes that landed in New York and New Jersey last month were brought through the Suez Canal and across the Atlantic from Indian refineries, which have been big buyers of Russian oil. \nOne analyst who has been tracking Russian fossil fuel exports and their role in funding the Ukraine war told the paper:\n\nIt does look like there\u2019s a trade where Russian crude is refined in India and then some of it is sold to the US.\n\nOil is also being transferred between ships at sea in the Mediterranean, off the coast of west Africa and the Black Sea, and then taken toward China, India and western Europe, the paper reports. \nIn March, the US president, Joe Biden, announced that \u201cRussian oil will no longer be acceptable at US ports\u201d. The UK announced a similar move to phase out Russian oil imports by the end of 2022.\n\nUpdated at 12.14pm BST\n\n\n 11.12am  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n 11.01am  \nToday so far \u2026\n\n\nRussia has said that a US decision to supply advanced rocket systems and munitions to Ukraine was extremely negative and would increase the risk of a direct confrontation. Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said that Moscow viewed US military aid to Ukraine \u201cextremely negatively\u201d. \u201cAttempts to present the decision as containing an element of \u2018self-restraint\u2019 are useless,\u201d Ryabkov said. \u201cThe fact that the United States, at the head of a group of states, is engaged in a purposeful pumping of weapons into the Kyiv regime is an obvious thing.\u201d\nThe US president, Joe Biden, has confirmed he will send the more advanced, longer-range rocket systems to Kyiv, a critical weapon that Ukrainian leaders have been asking for as they struggle to stall Russian progress in the Donbas region. The medium-range high mobility artillery rocket systems are part of a new $700m (\u00a3555m) tranche of security assistance from the US.\nSerhiy Haidai, Ukraine\u2019s governor of Luhansk, has said that Russia now controls 70% of the city of Sievierodonetsk, which is the main crucible of Russia\u2019s attack at the present time, and a key objective if Russian forces are to control the whole of the Donbas region. Haidai posted to Telegram claiming that \u201cthe Russians control 70% of Sievierodonetsk. Ukrainian troops retreated to more advantageous, pre-prepared positions. Another part continues fighting inside the city.\u201d\nPresident Zelenskiy has blasted the \u201cmadness\u201d of bombing a chemical plant in Sievierodonetsk. \u201cGiven the presence of large-scale chemical production in Sievierodonetsk, the Russian army\u2019s strikes there, including blind air bombing, are just crazy.\u201d Local officials said a nitric acid tank was hit and posted images of pink smoke billowing.\nZelenskiy said Ukraine\u2019s military forces have had some successes near Kherson and in parts of the Kharkiv region.\nThe UK\u2019s ministry of defence latest assessment of the situation on the ground in Ukraine says: \u201cRussian ground operations remain tightly focused, with the weight of fire power concentrated within a small sector of Luhansk oblast. Over 30-31 May, fighting intensified in the streets of Sievierodonetsk, with Russian forces pushing closer to the town centre. Over half of the town is likely now occupied by Russian forces, including Chechen fighters. Beyond the Donbas, Russia continues to conduct long-range missile strikes against infrastructure across Ukraine.\u201d\nOvernight a video depicting children alleged to have been killed by Ukrainian forces in the Russian-occupied Donbas region of Ukraine was projected on to the US embassy in Moscow as part of a protest to coincide with International Children\u2019s Day. \nGermany will supply Ukraine with the IRIS-T air defence system, the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said, following pleas from Kyiv and German opposition parties to step up heavy weapons deliveries.\nSwitzerland\u2019s government has vetoed Denmark\u2019s request to send Swiss-made armoured personnel carriers to Ukraine. Denmark votes today in a referendum asking the nation whether it wants to end its decades-long opt-out from common European Union defence policies. Denmark\u2019s foreign minister, Jeppe Kofod, has said he will ask parliament tomorrow for Denmark\u2019s support of the accession of Sweden and Finland to Nato. \nUkraine is working on an international UN-led operation with naval partners to ensure a safe trade route for food exports, according to Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, who said Russia was playing \u201chunger games with the world by blocking Ukrainian food exports\u201d.\nPope Francis appealed to authorities to lift the block on wheat exports from Ukraine, saying the grain cannot be used as a \u201cweapon of war\u201d.\nThe African Union warned EU leaders that Moscow\u2019s blockade of Ukraine\u2019s ports risked \u201ca catastrophic scenario\u201d of food shortages and price rises. Senegal\u2019s president, Macky Sall, who chairs the union, said \u201cthe worst is perhaps ahead of us\u201d if current global food supply trends continued.\nRussia says it has has completed testing of its hypersonic Zircon cruise missile and will deploy it before the end of the year on a new frigate of its Northern Fleet.\nUkraine will face Scotland tonight in what is set to be a highly emotionally charged football match in Glasgow.

The Danish system operator Energinet has said that the flow of natural gas to Denmark via Germany remained steady today, despite Gazprom\u2019s decision to halt supplies.\n\nUpdated at 9.24am BST\n\n\n 8.05am  \n\nAway from the war in their homeland, Ukraine\u2019s men\u2019s football team are competing for a place in this year\u2019s Fifa World Cup in Qatar. Nick Ames writes for us:\nWhen Ukraine face Scotland at Hampden Park tonight it will be less a rebirth than a reminder that, much as Russia might wish to erase the country\u2019s cultural identity, its football heritage remains truly alive. The act of playing for a World Cup place on Wednesday night, and over the next five days if all goes well, is both one of defiance and of expectation that, despite everything, good things can lie ahead. \nRead more here: Ukraine players show their nation\u2019s culture is alive and kicking\n\n\n\n\n 7.32am  \n\nMaksym Kozytskyi, the governor of Lviv, has confirmed on Telegram that again overnight there were no air raid warnings in the region, which is to the west of Ukraine and away from the main Russian theatre of operations.\n\n\n\n 7.20am  \n\nThe UK\u2019s ministry of defence has published their latest assessment of the situation on the ground in Ukraine. It says:\n\nRussian ground operations remain tightly focused, with the weight of fire power concentrated within a small sector of Luhansk oblast. Over 30-31 May, fighting intensified in the streets of Sievierodonetsk, with Russian forces pushing closer to the town centre.\nOver half of the town is likely now occupied by Russian forces, including Chechen fighters. Beyond the Donbas, Russia continues to conduct long-range missile strikes against infrastructure across Ukraine.\n\n\n\n\n\n 7.08am  \n\nDenmark votes today in a referendum asking the nation whether it wants to end its decades-long opt-out from common European Union defence policies. The referendum was called on 6 March in the wake of Russia\u2019s latest invasion of Ukraine.\nAgence France-Presse reports that analysts\u2019 predictions of the result have been cautious, given a low voter turnout expected in a country that has often said \u201cno\u201d to further EU integration. Eleven of Denmark\u2019s 14 parties have urged voters to say \u201cyes\u201d, representing more than three-quarters of seats in parliament.\n\u201cWe must always cast our ballots when there is a vote\u201d, prime minister Mette Frederiksen urged Danes in the final televised debate of the campaign on Sunday.\n\u201cI believe with all my heart that we have to vote \u2018yes\u2019. At a time when we need to fight for security in Europe, we need to be more united with our neighbours\u201d, she said.\nThe defence opt-out means the Nato founding member does not participate in EU foreign policy where defence is concerned, and does not contribute troops to EU military missions.\nPolls close at 8pm local time (7pm BST) with the result expected about three hours later.\n\n\n\n 7.02am  \n\nUkrainian hospitals are coming under enormous pressure, with trains carrying hundreds of injured people west from the front lines. Associated Press reports from Pokrovsk, where already-strained hospitals are trying to deal with an influx of trauma injuries from eastern cities like Sievierodonetsk, which are under heavy Russian bombing:\n\nIn wheelchairs and on stretchers, in ambulances and on train station platforms, they wait. Medical workers pull out ramps and wheel the patients onto the specially equipped train that will carry them westwards, away from the fighting raging in eastern Ukraine.\n\n\nThe train is a lifeline for the overwhelmed hospitals in cities and towns near Ukraine\u2019s front lines that are struggling to cope with an influx of war wounded on top of their usual flow of sick patients.\n\nSome hospitals in the east are buckling under the pressure of growing victim numbers, with already-reduced staff. From Pokrovsk:\n\nBefore the war \u201cwhen there was normal work, we had 10 surgeons, now we have five,\u201d said Dr. Ivan Mozhaiev. In his department, the 32-year-old is the only surgeon who remained out of five.\n\n\nUpdated at 7.03am BST\n\n\n 6.43am  \n\n689 children have been injured or killed in Ukraine as a result of the Russian invasion, the Verkhovna Rada - Ukrainian parliament - said this morning, in a post to its official Telegram. \n\nAs of the morning of June 1, the official number of child victims was 243, and the number of injured was 446.\n\nIt noted that those figures are not final, as work was still underway to try and confirm deaths in occupied territories and areas with active fighting. The true number is likely much higher: in cities like Sievierodonetsk, the mayor has said it is impossible to keep track of civilian casualties amid round-the-clock shelling.\n\n\n\n 6.19am  \n\nFor more insight into why Ukraine has been pleading for arms like the missiles just promised by the US, I recommend our correspondent Luke Harding\u2019s report from Mykolaiv. He spoke there to Ukrainian forces under constant fire, desperate for heavier weaponry. Roman Kostenko, a Ukrainian MP and special forces commander said this:\n\n\u201cVictory now depends on our international friends,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have plenty of kalashnikovs and machine guns. If we get enough heavy arms Russia will not be able to go any further.\u201d He stressed: \u201cThe west can change the outcome of this war.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 5.55am  \n\nReuters reports that Russia\u2019s nuclear forces are holding drills in the Ivanovo province, northeast of Moscow. The report comes from Interfax news agency, citing the Russian defence ministry on Wednesday.\nSome 1,000 servicemen are exercising in intense manoeuvres using over 100 vehicles including Yars intercontinental ballistic missile launchers, it said.\nThe report came shortly after Biden announced the US would be sending a $700m package of security assistance, including medium range missiles, to Ukraine.\n\n\n\n 5.38am  \nBiden to send mid-range rockets to bolster Ukraine defences\n\nSome more detail on the military aid package announced by president Joe Biden:\nThe medium-range high mobility artillery rocket systems are part of $700m of security assistance for Ukraine from the US that will include helicopters, Javelin anti-tank weapon systems, tactical vehicles and more.\nBiden said the United States the advanced rocket systems and munitions would allow Ukraine to \u201cmore precisely strike key targets on the battlefield\u201d. The US is trying to strike the balance of assisting Ukraine without risking escalating the war further.\nSenior US administration officials said Ukraine gave assurances the missiles would not be used to strike inside Russia:\n\nThese systems will be used by the Ukrainians to repel Russian advances on Ukrainian territory, but they will not be used on targets in Russian territory.\u201d\n\nRead the full story on that arms package here:\n\n\n\n\n 5.30am  \nSummary and welcome\n\nHello. I\u2019m Tess McClure and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. \nThis morning, Joe Biden confirmed he will send more advanced, longer-range rocket systems to Kyiv, a critical weapon that Ukrainian leaders have been asking for as they struggle to stall Russian progress in the Donbas region. The medium-range high mobility artillery rocket systems are part of a new $700m tranche of security assistance from the US.\nThat missiles package is an attempt for the US to strike a balance - providing meaningful assistance, while avoiding escalating the war by providing weapons that could allow strikes deep into Russia.\nIt\u2019s just after 7am in Ukraine. If you\u2019re just waking up or dropping in to catch up on what\u2019s been happening, here are some of the latest developments from overnight:\n\nRussian forces now control of most of the eastern city of Sievierodonetsk. Serhiy Gaidai, the local governor, said in an online post late on Tuesday that Russian shelling had made it impossible to deliver humanitarian supplies or evacuate people. Civilians were told to stay underground.\nPresident Zelenskiy has blasted the \u201cmadness\u201d of bombing a chemical plant in Sievierodonetsk. \u201cGiven the presence of large-scale chemical production in Sievierodonetsk, the Russian army\u2019s strikes there, including blind air bombing, are just crazy.\u201d Local officials said a nitric acid tank was hit and posted images of pink smoke billowing.\nZelenskiy said Ukraine\u2019s military forces have had some successes near Kherson and in parts of the Kharkiv region.\nUkraine welcomed EU sanctions but criticised the \u201cunacceptable\u201d delay. Speaking alongside Slovakia\u2019s President Zuzana Caputova in Kyiv, Zelenskiy noted that 50 days had passed between the fifth and sixth sanction packages.\nUkraine was working on an international UN-led operation with naval partners to ensure a safe trade route for food exports, according to Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, who said Russia was playing \u201chunger games with the world by blocking Ukrainian food exports\u201d.\nUkraine\u2019s giant seed bank is in danger of being destroyed. The genetic code for nearly 2,000 crops rests in underground vaults based in Kharkiv, north-eastern Ukraine, which has come under intense bombing. Read more of the Guardian\u2019s coverage how vital seed banks are in the climate crisis here and here.\nThe African Union warned EU leaders that Moscow\u2019s blockade of Ukraine\u2019s ports risked \u201ca catastrophic scenario\u201d of food shortages and price rises. Senegal\u2019s president, Macky Sall, who chairs the union, said \u201cthe worst is perhaps ahead of us\u201d if current global food supply trends continued.\nUkraine would prosecute 80 suspected war criminals, said the prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova. Representatives of a group of countries investigating Russian war crimes have met with the international criminal court prosecutor, Karim Khan, at The Hague.\nA senior Russian lawmaker has suggested kidnapping a Nato defence minister. Oleg Morozov from the United Russia party said on Rossiya-1 state TV he had a \u201cfantastical plot\u201d that a Nato war minister would travel to Kyiv and wake up in Moscow.\nSanctions against Russia are directed at ordinary citizens and motivated by hatred, the former president, Dmitry Medvedev, has said. Medvedev, who advises Vladimir Putin on national security, said on Telegram that the \u201cendless tango of economic sanctions\u201d won\u2019t touch the political elite but have brought losses for big business.\nRussia has further cut off gas supplies to Europe. Gazprom turned off the taps to a top Dutch trader and halted flows to some companies in Denmark and Germany. The intensification follows the EU\u2019s decision to place an embargo on most Russian oil imports.\n\n\n"

                    "body": "They were once the two most powerful men in global football, until being banned by Fifa\u2019s ethics committee in 2015 over a secret payment of two million Swiss francs (\u00a31.65m at the current exchange rate). Now, after a seven-year investigation, that same payment will lead to Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini finally stepping into the Swiss federal criminal court this week, facing fraud, embezzlement and other corruption charges. The 86-year-old Blatter, who has been battling ill-health, is due on the stand on day one of the two-week trial, which starts in Bellinzona on Wednesday. Platini will be interrogated on Friday. The trial, which will be before a panel of three judges, will conclude on 22 June, with a verdict on 8 July.  It will certainly make for electric theatre. But the stakes in football\u2019s trial of the century could not be higher for Blatter or Platini. If found guilty they could face a five-year prison sentence as well as a substantial fine. At the heart of the case is the infamous two million Swiss francs \u201cunderhand\u201d payment to Platini for consultancy services that was authorised by Blatter in January 2011, which ended up finishing both men\u2019s careers in football. That payment, Swiss prosecutors allege, \u201cwas made without a legal basis\u201d and \u201cunlawfully enriched Platini\u201d. Documents posted by the court provide further details to the prosecutors\u2019 case. \u201cJoseph S Blatter and Michel Fran\u00e7ois Platini are accused of illegally obtaining a payment of CHF 2m to the detriment of Fifa and social security contributions of CHF 229,126 in favour of Platini,\u201d they state. \u201cAmong other things, Platini submitted a presumably fictitious invoice to Fifa in 2011 for an [allegedly] still existing claim for his consulting work for Fifa between 1998 and 2002. After the invoice had been signed and Blatter had confirmed the existence of the claim, Fifa settled the corresponding claim [including social security contributions] in favour of Platini.\u201d Blatter, who is accused of fraud, embezzlement, unfaithful business management and forging a document, denies the charges. As does Platini, who has been charged with fraud, accomplice to embezzlement, misappropriation and as an accomplice to Blatter\u2019s alleged mismanagement.  Blatter said in a statement: \u201cI view the proceedings at the federal criminal court with optimism \u2013 and hope that, with this, this story will come to an end and all the facts will be worked through cleanly.\u201d In his statement Platini, a three-time Ballon d\u2019Or winner who guided France to the European Championship in 1984, said: \u201cI fully contest these unfounded and unfair accusations.\u201d Both men claim that they had a verbal agreement for the money to be paid as a backdated additional salary for Platini, who worked as a special adviser in Blatter\u2019s first term, from 1998-2002. However, Swiss law places a five-year time limit on such payments. Platini has also claimed Blatter told him at the time that Fifa could not afford to pay him, despite the governing body having a total income of 2.7bn Swiss francs and an overall profit of 115m Swiss francs over the period. The payment also came as Blatter \u2013 who had fallen out with his former protege in 2008 \u2013 was preparing to campaign for re-election as Fifa president against Mohamed bin Hammam of Qatar, where Platini\u2019s influence with European voters was seen as a crucial factor. Platini had been expected to stand in that election but in the end did not run for office. The trial is the culmination of a case that began in 2015 when Swiss prosecutors opened criminal proceedings against Blatter before a police raid at Fifa headquarters in Zurich. That led to Blatter stepping down as Fifa president just days after winning a record fifth election and ended Platini\u2019s campaign to succeed his former mentor. They were later suspended and banned from football by Fifa\u2019s ethics committee. While a wider investigation by authorities in the United States led to numerous Fifa executives being arrested and convicted on charges that included racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering, this is the first time Blatter or Platini have faced criminal charges. However Blatter, who had a serious bout of ill-health after undergoing heart surgery in December 2020, also faces a separate criminal proceeding related to authorising a $1m Fifa payment to Trinidad &amp; Tobago in 2010 into the control of the then Fifa vice-president, Jack Warner. Two former Fifa officials are also suspects in that investigation. Blatter remains banned from football. Last year the adjudicatory chamber of Fifa\u2019s ethics committee extended his ban to 2027 after finding him in breach of rules concerning duty of loyalty, conflicts of interest and offering or accepting gifts or other benefits. They called his behaviour \u201ccompletely reprehensible\u201d.  Platini, meanwhile, has not yet returned to football after his four-year ban ended in 2019 as he has fought to clear his name. He maintains that he is the victim of a plot to deny him the Fifa presidency and that he paid taxes on the two million Swiss francs payment after receiving it. He has accused Swiss prosecutors of colluding with Fifa\u2019s current president, Gianni Infantino, and of a \u201crelentlessness to want to unduly implicate me in a case in which my entire good faith had been recognised\u201d. As his lawyer, Dominic Nellen, put it: \u201cWe are confident that the outcome of the trial will establish the perfect good faith of Mr Michel Platini in this affair, which has been fabricated to remove him from the presidency of Fifa.\u201d Those arguments will be played out in a dramatic 11 days of a trial that promises to be one of the most high profile in football politics\u2019 long and often sordid history. \u2022 This article was amended on 14 June 2022 to provide a better translation regarding the 2011 payment made to Michel Platini."

                    "body": "Good morning. There\u2019s no precedent for how Britain should mourn a monarch who reigned for 70 years, so it is not surprising if \u2013 alongside a widespread public feeling that the Queen\u2019s death is a moment of great sadness \u2013 there are pockets of uncertainty, absurdity, and even dissent.  In the last couple of days, as the initial shock of her passing has waned, another story has emerged alongside expressions of respect: an uneasy sense that the public is being told what it feels without much room to talk about more complicated responses than grief alone. That feeling \u2013 more marginal, but no less sincere \u2013 came to a head yesterday after reports that multiple protesters have been arrested or warned by the police for shouting or holding up signs that question not the Queen, but the institution of the monarchy itself. Today\u2019s newsletter, with protest law expert Tom Wainwright, is about the concerns raised by those arrests \u2013 and what they\u2019ve revealed about parts of the national mood that have been difficult to see. Here are the headlines. Five big stories  Health | The UK government could scrap its entire anti-obesity strategy after ministers ordered an official review of the policy, the Guardian can reveal. The review could end measures including the ban on sugary products at supermarket checkouts and restrictions on pre-9pm advertising of junk food. Queen Elizabeth II | The Queen made a final journey home to Buckingham Palace on Tuesday night as her coffin was received by her family in a small private ceremony before being handed back to the nation for her official lying in state. Ukraine | Ukraine consolidated its control of the Kharkiv region on Tuesday, raising flags on towns and villages occupied by Russian troops for six months, and reclaiming areas seized by Moscow on the first day of Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion. Policing | The family of Chris Kaba, a 24-year-old unarmed man who was shot dead in London by the Metropolitan police last week, have said they were not told of his death until 11 hours after it had happened. Film | French-Swiss director Jean-Luc Godard, who pioneered the French New Wave of cinema in the 1950s and 60s, died peacefully at 91 in Switzerland. Peter Bradshaw paid tribute to a \u201cgenius who tore up the rule book\u201d.  In depth: \u2018Who elected him?\u2019  In Edinburgh, a woman with a sign that said \u201cfuck imperialism, abolish monarchy\u201d was arrested shortly before an event proclaiming Charles as king, and a man was arrested after heckling Prince Andrew as the Queen\u2019s cortege drove past. In Oxford, a man was arrested after he shouted \u201cWho elected him?\u201d at another proclamation. And in London, a woman was moved on by police after holding up a sign that said \u201cNot my king\u201d, while a man said he was told that if he wrote the same message on a blank piece of paper he was holding, he could be arrested too. By this morning, a total of four people had been charged in Scotland. Tom Wainwright, a barrister and co-author of The Protest Handbook, says the cases fit into a longstanding pattern of overzealous policing of peaceful demonstration. \u201cThe trend has been to crack down on protest for a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to think of a piece of legislation other than the Human Rights Act which has enhanced the right to free speech, and there have been dozens that restrict it.\u201d Inevitably, that old chestnut, the Streisand effect \u2013 whereby an attempt to suppress something only makes it more visible \u2013 is coming into play: yesterday, protesters (pictured below) held up blank pieces of paper outside St Giles Cathedral in Edinburgh, where the Queen was lying at rest.  One index of the appetite for making sense of all this: as I send this email, the five most read articles on the Guardian are all about less positive aspects of Charles\u2019 accession, from Pippa Crerar\u2019s exclusive about redundancies at Clarence House to the news that British Cycling has U-turned on its advice not to ride a bike during the Queen\u2019s funeral. As Marina Hyde writes: \u201cIf people feel only one emotion is state-sanctioned, they may feel far more minded to give vent to others.\u201d On the one hand, Morrisons turns down the volume of its checkout beeps; on the other, the New York Times publishes a column urging readers to \u201cmourn the queen, not her empire\u201d and finds itself the subject of an article arguing that it \u201chates Britain\u201d. Here\u2019s what else you need to know about the picture around the arrests. *** Why the protesters were arrested The arrests and warnings appear to have drawn on two powers in England, with slightly different parameters in Scotland. In England and Wales, under section 5 of the public order act, \u201cofficers must have reasonable grounds for suspicion that the act would be likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress\u201d, Wainwright said. \u201cBut it has to be more than trivial. \u2018Distress\u2019 is real emotional disturbance, not being offended. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much evidence of that, but officers may take a very conservative approach.\u201d The other possibility in the English cases is the police\u2019s \u201ccommon law power to take action to prevent a breach of the peace\u201d, he said. \u201cWith that, they can act if they have a hypothetical view that a protest will lead to scuffles or violence and so on. But you have to take into account whether the protester is behaving unreasonably.\u201d In Scotland, protesters have been charged with a breach of the peace, but that\u2019s not the same thing as it is south of the border: \u201cIt\u2019s broadly similar to section 5, it has to be disorderly behaviour likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress.\u201d Wainwright sets the English cases in the context of the new Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act, which allows police to shut down \u201cdisruptive\u201d or \u201cnoisy\u201d protest. (It doesn\u2019t apply in Scotland.) One of the protesters, Symon Hill, said he was told he was arrested under the act, only for a police statement to subsequently say he had been suspected of a section 5 breach. (He was later dearrested.) In any case, the new act \u201chas fed a sense that protest is only allowed if it doesn\u2019t really draw any attention\u201d, Wainwright said. \u201cThe bigger message police have been getting from the government is to clamp down.\u201d *** How the news was received Very few observers were ready to defend police conduct over the arrests, with criticism from left and right over what many saw as a free speech issue. The more controversial \u2013 but maybe equally telling \u2013 piece of the story is about how the protests sit alongside other aspects of the last few days that range from the peculiar to the alarming. As well as Morrisons\u2019 deferential beeps, the Bank of England has delayed its interest rate decision; Norwich City Council closed two bike racks; Center Parcs U-turned on a decision to evict holidaymakers on the day of the funeral; and Hammersmith and Fulham postponed a car-free day. At the other end of the scale, TalkSport pundit Trevor Sinclair was suspended for asking why black and brown people should mourn the Queen, and Novara Media writer Ash Sarkar was one of a number of social media users to report an increase in racist abuse. Some other funerals have been postponed, and thousands of hospital appointments have been cancelled. None of these incidents directly explain overzealous policing \u2013 but they might help to form a picture of a climate in which critics of the monarchy are unwilling to give them the benefit of the doubt. *** What to expect in the days ahead  If the demonstrators holding up blank pieces of paper in Edinburgh are any guide, there is every possibility of further protest. The National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council says it has now \u201cissued guidance\u201d, and in London, the Met has said that \u201cthe public absolutely have a right to protest and we have been making this clear to all officers\u201d \u2013 but that position may come under more pressure between now and the Queen\u2019s funeral on Monday. There is a precedent for a more vigorous approach on the day of the funeral itself: \u201cThere were a number of examples of pre-emptive arrest at the royal wedding in 2011,\u201d said Wainwright. \u201cMy concern is that we\u2019ll see it\u2019s not just about a couple of officers making bad decisions \u2013 it\u2019s a message coming down from above.\u201d Critics of inappropriately-timed expressions of republicanism have occasionally tried to cast them as a product of a loss of deference, or possibly the fault of Netflix\u2019s The Crown. They might read Sam Knight\u2019s justly celebrated 2017 long read about what to expect in the days after the Queen\u2019s death, which recounts an incident after the death of George VI (his funeral procession is pictured above). \u201cA Mass Observation survey showed that people objected to the endless maudlin music, the forelock-tugging coverage,\u201d Knight wrote. \u201c\u2018Don\u2019t they think of old folk, sick people, invalids?\u2019 one 60-year old woman asked. \u2018It\u2019s been terrible for them, all this gloom.\u2019\u201d In a bar in Notting Hill, one drinker\u2019s crass remark started a fight. Transpose the bar in 1952 to the internet 70 year later, and the last few days don\u2019t seem so novel, after all. What else we\u2019ve been reading   Devi Sridhar looks at an odd phenomenon this summer: higher than expected deaths in England and Wales. So what\u2019s going on?

John Collingridge explains what it all means Cartoon of the day | Martin Rowson  The Upside A bit of good news to remind you that the world\u2019s not all bad  Despite the fact that coffee beans have grown in Yemen for more than six centuries, coffee farmers in Yemen are often ignored in the global market. To address this problem, Mokhtar Alkhanshali, a Yemeni-American coffee aficionado, organised a Yemen coffee auction in London. A group of farmers in ceremonial clothing came to the capital, with 28 samples for tasting and, in no time at all, sold their coffee to buyers from all over the world. The success of the auction is a promising sign for Yemen: not only does it have a positive economic impact on a country devastated by war, it has steered farmers away from growing the drug khat, which has caused disputes in some communities. \u201cMy dream now is for my coffee to reach the world,\u201d said one Haraaz coffee farmer.

At about 6.10am on a quiet Wednesday, a pub in Sydney\u2019s CBD exploded with noise and chaos as Australia scored to lead against France in their opening World Cup match.\nFor the next 18 minutes, as Australia led the world champions, the heaving crowd at Cheers was cacophonous.\n\n\u201cIt was limbs, just limbs everywhere,\u201d Kieran Patel said with a broad grin.\n\u201cIt was pure jubilation, the only thing that comes close is when we actually qualified for this World Cup. And having everyone around to celebrate with is amazing.\u201d\n\nPatel wore a retro Socceroos jersey over a button shirt, and like many of the supporters at the pub, headed out for his office job as soon as the match was over.\nMany will have to pick themselves up after a morning of extreme emotions, and perhaps a few drinks\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough to go from this, and from that moment, to going into my job,\u201d Patel said. \u201cIt\u2019s tough, especially having to get up this early. But I wouldn\u2019t miss it.\u201d\nFootball fans across Australia rose early and gathered in loungerooms, pubs, cinemas and Federation Square in Melbourne to watch the country\u2019s debut match in the 2022 tournament.\n\nOddly timed matches are part of being a Socceroos fan, and this World Cup is no different, with their next match at the relatively easy time of 9pm on Saturday, before playing again at 2am local time on Thursday 1 December.\nReality eventually came to bite the Socceroos on Wednesday morning, who conceded four goals to lose to the reigning world champions, and a deflated energy took hold of the pub.\n\nThe crowd growled with tension as the morning wore on, as the match settled into a rhythm, with France holding the ball and Australia attempting counterattacks.\nEach missed pass was met with communal groans, each successful tackle celebrated vociferously, with shouts about the ref and French play-acting ringing out into the empty street.\n\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\n\nAt Federation Square, scuffles broke out, with bottles thrown at a couple of French supporters and video posted to social media showing altercations between the opposing fans.\n\nBack at Cheers, Ashton Behennah said he hadn\u2019t slept, and wasn\u2019t sure how he would get through a day of work and study, but wasn\u2019t full of regret.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t slept, how could I sleep?\u201d he said. \u201cThis only happens once every four years, I wasn\u2019t going to miss it, I love football and will do anything to see a good match.\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy, how early we have to get up and what we have to go through, but I don\u2019t care, I want to see us play.\u201d\n\nBehennah said he was disappointed by the result, but will never forget those 18 minutes, saying it was a \u201cdream\u201d to imagine Australia winning.\n\u201cIt couldn\u2019t have gone any better in those first 20 minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it was crickets after they scored their third and fourth, but in the end that goal was just a consolation.\u201d\nRyan Frank woke at 4am to prepare.\n\u201cThe hype woke me up really, it honestly wasn\u2019t that difficult,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great atmosphere here, especially for such an early start.\u201d\nAs the match wore on and France piled on the goals, the crowd remained in place, with barely anyone leaving until the final whistle, which came about 8am local time.\nAmanda Monaco has watched the Socceroos live at two World Cups, but watched the last meeting between France and Australia at a French bakery in Vancouver.\n\u201cIt was during the 2018 World Cup, and it was horrible, I was the only person in my Australian gear,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s so much better to be here, among Socceroos supporters, no matter the result.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t compare to actually being there though.\u201d\n\nMonaco wasn\u2019t sure how she would get through the rest of the day at her job, sighing at the thought of somehow returning to a normal day.\n\u201cI expected this, it\u2019s part of the experience of watching football in Australia, to go through these highs and lows so early in the morning,\u201d she said.\n\u201cFor Australians, it\u2019s always a tough, weird time.

                    "body": "The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has said his country is doing all it can to wean itself off Russian energy, but declined to endorse a claim by Boris Johnson that it would stop importing Russian gas by the middle of 2024. Scholz said only that the goal would be achieved very soon, and that Germany would stop using Russian coal by the summer and Russian oil by the end of the year. The two leaders were speaking at a Downing Street press conference after the first extensive bilateral talks since Scholz was elected to head a coalition government. Scholz also implied Germany would not supply Ukraine with 100 Marder infantry fighting vehicles, saying he would only supply weapons that were practical and useful. A Ukrainian request for the IFVs has been held up by the German defence department, leading to tensions between the Ukrainians and Germans. Johnson, one of the closest allies of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, struck a different tone than Scholz about the value of holding talks with Vladimir Putin, after Polish criticism of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, for persisting with his dialogue with the Russian leader. Johnson said: \u201cI have got to say, negotiating with Putin does not seem to be full of promise or that he can be trusted.\u201d He said he was \u201cdeeply, deeply sceptical and cynical about Putin\u2019s assurances\u201d and that \u201cthe Europe we knew just six weeks ago no longer exists\u201d. Scholz said the criticism of Macron was unjustified and that it was important Putin heard voices other than from his inner circle. Throughout the press conference, Scholz was challenged to explain why Germany was not willing to go faster to reduce the scale of Russian energy imports, given the \u20ac35bn (\u00a329bn) in revenue from the EU it has generated for Russia since the war started. He insisted it would take time to remove the legal obstacle to build the necessary liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals on Germany\u2019s northern coast that would be able to store imported LNG from countries such as Qatar and the US. He said: \u201cWe are actively working to get independent from the import of oil and we think that we will be able to make it during this year. And we are actively working to get independent from the necessity of importing gas from Russia. This is, as you may imagine, not that easy, because it needs infrastructure to be built.\u201d Johnson voiced sympathy over the German predicament. \u201cThis is not easy for any of us and I applaud the seismic decisions taken by Olaf\u2019s government to move Germany away from Russian hydrocarbons. We cannot transform our respective energy systems overnight, but we also know that Putin\u2019s war will not end overnight\u201d. However, he then added: \u201cI think by the middle of 2024, as I recall, Germany\u2019s going to stop using Russian gas, which is quite extraordinary.\u201d Asked if he agreed with Johnson\u2019s timetable, Scholz simply said: \u201cWe are optimistic that we will get rid of the need of importing gas from Russia very soon.\u201d Scholz stressed that the change in Germany\u2019s energy supplies would be permanent, something he said would cause long-term damage to the Russian economy. He said Germany would be using renewables for all its electricity within 20 years.  On arming Ukraine, Johnson signalled a change in strategy. \u201cSome of the kit that Nato has simply wouldn\u2019t be appropriate. It may be more useful to support them, the Ukrainians, by backfilling and allowing some of the former Warsaw Pact countries to supply some of their own armour,\u201d he said. The Ukrainian armed forces are trained to use the kind of heavy weaponry that the Czechs and Slovaks are supplying. Britain is sending Ukraine more Starstreak anti-aircraft missiles and 800 anti-tank missiles after an \u201cunconscionable\u201d attack on a train station in the eastern Ukraine city of Kramatorsk on Friday, Johnson said. The \u201chigh-grade military equipment\u201d is worth \u00a3100m, Johnson said, with the UK anti-tank missiles seen as particularly potent against Russian forces. Asked if Germany was willing to send Marder IFVs, Scholz said: \u201cWe are trying to send those weapons that are helpful and can be used. The successes by the Ukrainian military show that we sent effective weapons \u2013 anti-tank weapons, a lot of ammunition and everything that goes with it. At the same time \u2026 we have to take a close look at what can be used effectively, and these are very technical questions.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 13 April 2022 to clarify that the Marder is an infantry fighting vehicle, not a tank."

Heard won on one count of her countersuit over a description of her allegations as \u201can abuse hoax\u201d. Partygate | Boris Johnson was accused of failing to allay fears that he and his ministers consider themselves above the rules. The intervention from chair of the committee on standards in public life Jonathan Evans came amid yet more criticism of the PM from Tory MPs. Honours | A leading critic of the prime minister, Jeremy Wright, was knighted in the birthday honours list.

Coronavirus | The Office for National Statistics has published research that suggests approximately 2 million people in Britain are living with long Covid.

In depth: 70 things you never knew about the Queen  1. Elizabeth\u2019s birth in 1926 was attended by the home secretary. She became heir to the throne aged 10. She never went to school. 2. Elizabeth was given her first corgi, Susan, on her 18th birthday in 1944. Susan once bit the ankle of a royal clockwinder, Leonard Hubbard, and has her own Wikipedia page, with sections including \u2018royal life\u2019 and \u2018death and legacy\u2019. 3. Elizabeth married Philip Mountbatten in 1947. The cake, four tiers and nine feet high, was baked by McVitie\u2019s, of subsequent Hobnob fame.  4. The tradition of a senior politician attending royal births ended in 1948, with the birth of Prince Charles. Buckingham Palace said that Elizabeth\u2019s father, King George VI, felt \u201cit is unnecessary to continue further a practice for which there is no legal requirement\u201d. 5. One biographer said that Elizabeth endured a 30-hour labour before giving birth by C-section. Philip was not present, and at one point, went to play squash. 6. After George died of lung cancer on 6 February 1952, about 300,000 people filed past his coffin at Westminster Hall. Many thousands waited in queues overnight.  7. Upon receiving news that she was now queen, Elizabeth returned home (above) from a visit to Kenya immediately. She was 25. Many years later, she said: \u201cIn a way, I didn\u2019t have an apprenticeship. My father died much too young.\u201d An editorial in the Guardian read: \u201cIt is a great inheritance \u2013 and a heavy burden \u2013 that now falls to the girl who becomes Queen\u201d. 8. The New York Times marked George\u2019s death and Elizabeth\u2019s ascension to the throne at the age of 25 with a three-tier, full-width headline in block capitals. 12 years later, it marked the death of former president Herbert Hoover in two columns. 9. Only one woman other than the Queen herself was present at her proclamation. 10. The Cabinet agreed that the coronation should not take place until the following year because of severe constraints on the country\u2019s finances. As then housing minister Harold Macmillan noted in his diary, \u201cthis year the bailiffs may be in; the Crown itself may be in pawn.\u201d 11. Prime minister Winston Churchill was initially sceptical of televising the event, telling parliament that \u201cIt would be unfitting that the whole ceremony, not only in its secular but also its religious and spiritual aspects, should be presented as if it were a theatrical performance.\u2019 12. A committee was established to decide which items could be sanctioned as official memorabilia for the coronation. The panel, chaired by Bernard Marmaduke Fitzalan-Howard, 16th Duke of Norfolk, unanimously agreed to reject an application for crown-embroidered knickers. 13. There was some anger in Scotland that the Queen would be known as Elizabeth II, given her predecessor had not ruled north of the border. When post boxes appeared with E II R on them, some had the \u2018II\u2019 removed. They were vandalised with tar or a sledgehammer, and in one case blown apart with a gelignite bomb. From then on, Scottish pillar boxes bore the Crown of Scotland instead. 14. Despite Churchill\u2019s initial reservations, the coronation was televised. Although just 2.5m households had a television set, some 40% of the country, or 20 million people, crowded into living rooms to watch it \u2013 against 12 million who listened on the radio. 15. In a book of recollections of the 1950s, You\u2019ve Never Had It So Good by Stephen F Kelly, Chris Prior \u2013 a child at the time \u2013 remembered the whole family going to watch on a tiny set at his aunt\u2019s house. \u201cThe cat got so agitated by all the people there that it ran up the chimney then fell down and there was soot everywhere,\u201d he said. 16. The ceremony (below) cost \u00a31.57m, about \u00a347m today. There were 8,000 guests and 40,000 troops involved in the parade.  17. At least one guest, Queen Victoria\u2019s granddaughter Princess Marie Louise of Schleswig-Holstein, whose full family name was, genuinely, Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg, had attended three previous coronations. She was born in 1872. 18. When Elizabeth was crowned, the British empire had 70 overseas territories, and was fighting wars against independence movements in Egypt and Kenya. Between 1945 and 1965, the number of people living under British colonial rule shrank from 700 million to 5 million. 19. Average wages in 1953 were \u00a39.25 a week. The top rate of income tax was 97.5%. The print edition of the Guardian cost 3p. 20. Rationing of sweets ended on 6 February 1953, prompting children to flock to shops in search of toffee apples and sticks of nougat.  21. During a world tour in 1954, the Queen was filmed throwing a pair of tennis shoes and a racket at Philip and shouting at him as he ran out of the chalet they were sharing in Australia. The camera crew exposed the film and gave it to the royal press secretary. The incident was later fictionalised in The Crown. 22. According to biographer Sally Bedell Smith, in May 1954, after their six-month absence on the tour, the Queen and Philip greeted Charles (5) and Anne (3) with handshakes. 23. Philip once gave the Queen a washing machine.  24. Andrew and Edward, born in 1960 (above) and 1964, were the first children born to a serving monarch in a century, and likely to be the only ones for at least the next century, too. 25. In her book about Elizabeth and Philip\u2019s marriage, My Husband and I, editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine Ingrid Seward writes that when Andrew was five, he was thrown in a heap of dung by two grooms after attempting to hit the royal horses\u2019 legs with a large stick. 26. Seward also reports that Andrew was once given a black eye by a footman, who subsequently offered his resignation. The Queen turned it down because she assumed Andrew had deserved it. 27. In 1965, Tony Benn, then the postmaster general, attempted to win the Queen\u2019s approval for his plan to remove her image from stamps. He got a letter saying that \u2018The Queen was not as enthusiastic about these designs as she sometimes is.\u201d 28. The Queen\u2019s private secretary, Lord Charteris, said that her greatest regret was the eight days it took her to visit Aberfan after the 1966 coal slide which killed 144 people. 29. The Queen has addressed the nation at Christmas every year except 1969, when a documentary, Royal Family, was aired instead. Around two-thirds of the country watched it, but it was never shown again in its entirety \u2013 except for a brief period last year when it popped up on YouTube. 30. In 1971, a Gallup opinion poll quoted in parliament found that 57% of the public thought the Queen should get a \u201cpay rise\u201d to double her allowance from the civil list to \u00a31m. 31. The following year, the Treasury agreed a deal with the Palace which established that MPs could only vote to increase the civil list, not reduce it. 32. A leading Tory said in a letter to the Chancellor, released many years later, that it was imperative to fix a deal to avoid risking a Labour government being able to reduce it. John Boyd-Carpenter wrote: \u201clet us so arrange things that the Queen does not have to expose herself to this again.\u201d  33. The 25th anniversary of the Queen\u2019s ascent to the throne, the silver jubilee, was marked in 1977 by a tour (above) of 36 counties across the UK. In Lancashire more than 1m people turned out to see her in a single day. She also made overseas visits to nine countries. 34. Covering the festivities for the Guardian, Martin Wainwright wrote that the celebrations \u201ccontinue to expand into all areas of human life\u201d. He reported that 100 \u201cjubilee coconuts\u201d had been sent from the Bahamas as a gesture of goodwill to save a village fete in Sussex which had \u201ca shy but no nuts\u201d. 35. The Royal Collection Trust maintains a list of animals given to the Queen.

                    "body": "More than one in eight UK households fear they have no further way to make cuts to afford a sharp increase in annual energy bills this autumn.  More than a quarter of households earning less than \u00a320,000 worry they will be unable to cope with higher bills, with families in Yorkshire, the south-west and Northern Ireland the least confident about covering their costs, according to the latest rebuilding Britain index of 20,000 people by Legal &amp; General. Almost half of UK households are concerned about being able to keep up with rent or mortgage payments over the next 12 months as the majority realise they will have to make cuts elsewhere.  The latest evidence of pressure on households emerges amid the looming prospect of inflation hitting 12% this autumn after dearer fuel and food pushed the official measure of the cost of living to a 40-year high of 9.4% in June. A one-month jump in petrol prices not seen since at least the late 1980s, coupled with across-the-board increases in food staples such as eggs, milk, cheese and vegetables, sent Britain\u2019s annual inflation rate soaring. Households in Great Britain are bracing for annual energy bills of up to \u00a33,850 next January, three times what they were paying at the start of 2022, after Russia further squeezed Europe\u2019s gas supplies. It recently emerged that a fifth of UK households now have an average shortfall of \u00a360 a week between what they earn and what they need to cover essentials such as energy bills, rent, transport and food, as the rising cost of living leaves people with the lowest amount of spare cash in almost five years, according to data from the Asda income tracker collated by the Centre for Business and Economic Research. The amount that UK consumers borrowed rose by the fastest rate in three years last month, as households struggled to cope with the rising cost of living. People borrowed an additional \u00a31.8bn in consumer credit last month, up from a \u00a3900m increase in May, according to the latest Bank of England data. Pressure on households is expected to ramp up this autumn as the price of essentials \u2013 from clothing to food \u2013 continues to rise alongside higher energy bills. Shoppers are switching to discount stores, dropping brands in favour of supermarkets\u2019 own label goods and trimming back spending on luxuries such as subscription services and gambling as they try to make their budget stretch. Nigel Wilson, the chief executive of Legal &amp; General, said: \u201cMany households across the UK are currently facing very tough financial choices. For some, those choices seem impossible. \u201cHowever, what is most concerning is that the impact of the cost of living crisis is being felt more severely in some parts of the UK than in others. This threatens to widen the existing demographic and geographic inequalities that the levelling up agenda was designed to address.\u201d Almost two-thirds of those asked said that long-term solutions, such as investment in energy-efficient homes and offices, were one of the most attractive answers to tackling the cost of living crisis. However, it has emerged that the government has dropped plans to add another \u00a31bn to the existing \u00a31bn of funding for home insulation and other measures to help the poorest households reduce energy use under the Energy Company Obligation, as first reported by Bloomberg.  Efforts to tackle reducing bills for those on low incomes have also been stymied by holdups related to Brexit and Covid, which have left about \u00a330m of other funds \u2013 including the Social Housing Decarbonisation Fund \u2013 partly unspent. Cuts on central government investment since 2012 have resulted in the pace of insulating homes slumping in the past decade, making the energy crisis more acute. Meanwhile, the UK\u2019s petrol prices are the second highest in Europe, according to new data from the RAC breakdown recovery service. UK drivers pay an average pump price of 186p, as much as 20p more per litre of petrol than drivers in Spain and France, according to the research. The UK is, meanwhile, ranked 12th in terms of temporary tax cuts on petrol, well behind Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. Simon Williams at the RAC said: \u201cThis analysis lays bare an uncomfortable truth for the UK government \u2013 that compared with other European countries, it\u2019s pretty much done the least to support drivers through the current period of record high fuel prices. The result is the UK being one of the most expensive places to fill up and putting it above other countries that have historically charged more for fuel than UK retailers do, including France and the Netherlands.\u201d"

                    "body": "  9.56pm    Ben Fisher was in Brussels, and his report is here for your edification. Thanks for reading this MBM. Nighty night!      9.55pm    Kevin De Bruyne talks to S4C, and isn\u2019t particularly impressed with the suggestion that Wales made Belgium defend a lot during the second half. \u201cI think we fully deserved to win. The first half we fully dominated, created a lot of chances. The second half we started badly. The only thing from our side is that we had to keep the ball, Wales were so deep, we had to wait for the right moment. That was the only thing that could have got better, but I never had the feeling that Wales were going to press us. I saw two chances for Wales, I don\u2019t know what everyone else saw, but it is what it is.\u201d As for the overturned penalty decision? \u201cI was already running to the corner, but even then the rules are so stupid, because it was just a normal corner [and not a drop ball].\u201d     9.48pm    Brennan Johnson talks to S4C: \u201cIt was a game of two halves. In the first, we lacked a lot of belief, we didn\u2019t know how good we could be on this night, and especially what we could bring going forward. We didn\u2019t show any of that. In the second half we came out with a different mentality and did ourselves proud. Rob Page told us to believe ourselves, to show why we\u2019re here, and I think we did that. Poland is a massive game to stay in this league. It\u2019ll be a really big game and we\u2019ll all be ready for it.\u201d  Updated at 9.48pm BST    9.46pm    The other result in Group A4: Poland 0-2 Netherlands. Goals from Cody Gakpo and Steven Bergwijn have given the Dutch all three points in Warsaw. They remain top of the group with 13 points, three clear of Belgium on 10. Wales are still bottom with just the one point, but they\u2019re only three behind the Poles, who visit Cardiff on Sunday. They\u2019re not down and out yet.     9.41pm   FULL TIME: Belgium 2-1 Wales  The whistle sounds on a deserved victory for Belgium \u2026 but Wales will be very happy with their second-half performance. They\u2019d been given the runaround in the first half, but stood firm in the second, and could easily have snatched a draw.     9.40pm    90 min +6: \u2026 but the long ball goes straight down Courtois\u2019 throat.     9.39pm    90 min +5: Martinez swans down the tunnel wearing a wry smile. If nothing else, from the stand, he\u2019ll have a good look at Williams launching a Hail Mary from the halfway line \u2026     9.38pm    90 min +4: Mertens finally takes it. Wales clear and launch a counter through Johnson down the right. Meunier comes across with a crunch tackle, just as it looks like Johnson would sprint clear. On the touchline, Roberto Martinez deliberately throws the ball away to waste time, and is sent off!  Updated at 9.45pm BST    9.36pm    90 min +3: Trossard wins a corner down the left. Mertens is in no rush to take it.     9.35pm    90 min +2: De Bruyne, amazing in the first half, not so eye-catching in the second, makes way for De Ketelaere.     9.34pm    90 min +1: Meunier has a dig from distance. Always wide right, always high.     9.34pm    90 min: Johnson makes good down the right again, like he did for the Welsh goal. His fierce cross is tipped away from the danger zone by Courtois. Wales are pushing for a sensational equaliser, and they\u2019ll have another six minutes in which to find one!      9.33pm    89 min: Bale shimmies down the left and backheels for Williams, who sends a powerful low fizzer towards goal. Courtois parries well and the hosts clear their lines.     9.31pm    88 min: Trossard runs at Wales again and lays off for Vanaken, who slips a pass down the left for Mertens. He shapes a curler towards the top right \u2026 but it\u2019s always curling the wrong way. Well wide.     9.30pm    86 min: Mertens whips a cross in from the left. Mepham, bravely sliding to block, takes one in the swingers. After taking a few deep breaths and an inventory, he\u2019s back up and running.     9.29pm    85 min: Williams crosses from the left. Connor Roberts cushions a header down at the far stick. Johnson drags a shot wide left from 12 yards. Had that been on target, tucked into the corner, Courtois was never getting it. Not a gilt-edged chance, but a chance nonetheless.     9.27pm    84 min: Tyler Roberts comes on for Norrington-Davies, as Wales opt to go for it with time running out.     9.27pm    83 min: The home crowd weren\u2019t too happy with the overturned decision, as you\u2019d imagine. Now they\u2019ve howled themselves out, it\u2019s the Welsh travelling support making the most noise.     9.26pm    81 min: Good old VAR, huh. That was a ridiculous penalty decision. We play on.     9.25pm   VAR: No penalty!  79 min: VAR has a look, and justice is done. Morrell clearly toed the ball out of play, and De Bruyne then went over his outstretched leg. It\u2019ll be a drop ball, and not a corner, while it turns out Bale was booked for arguing the toss. Surely that will be rescinded. Morrell\u2019s yellow too, else he\u2019ll miss the Poland game.  Updated at 9.50pm BST    9.22pm   Penalty for Belgium!  77 min: Belgium ping it around patiently. Suddenly Meunier rolls a pass down the right for De Bruyne, who strides into the box. Morrell sticks out a toe and pokes out for a corner. De Bruyne goes over, the referee points to the spot, and Wales are incensed! Morrell is also booked.     9.19pm    76 min: Tielemans makes way for Vanaken.     9.19pm    75 min: For the second time in as many minutes, Trossard embarks on a dangerous dribble down the middle of the park. The Brighton midfielder has been lively since coming on.     9.17pm    73 min: Johnson tears towards the Belgian box and slips James into space on his right. James one-twos with Morrell and dinks to the far post, where Vertonghen is forced to head behind for a corner. Nothing comes of the set piece, but Wales are asking a few questions now.     9.14pm    71 min: Free kick for Belgium out on the left. De Bruyne takes. Wales deal with it easily. The hosts haven\u2019t been half as dangerous in this second half. All credit to Wales for making a match of this.     9.13pm    69 min: James curls a cross in from the left. Bale gets in ahead of Alderweireld and heads goalwards. The ball flicks off the defender and out for a corner, at which James showcases his slapstick skills, slipping over onto all fours under no pressure, then getting up to needlessly barge Openda, shepherding the loose ball out of play, to the floor from behind. Goal kick.     9.10pm    67 min: The presence of Meunier down the right forces Williams into conceding a corner. De Bruyne curls it in. Alderweireld slaps a sidefoot way over the bar.     9.09pm    66 min: Belgium respond with a triple change. Batshuayi, Hazard and Carrasco are replaced by Openda, Mertens and Trossard.     9.08pm    65 min: Wales make a double change. Off go Moore and Smith, on come Morrell and \u2013 to loud cheers of appreciation \u2013 Bale.     9.06pm    63 min: Belgium stroke the ball around awhile.     9.05pm    61 min: De Bruyne takes the free kick. It\u2019s an over-elaborate training-ground routine that ends with Tielemans taking a long-distance potshot that\u2019s deflected out for a corner. Nothing comes of it.     9.04pm    60 min: Some pre-free-kick faffing, as Moore goes down to get the physio to take a look at his arm. Ian Burch helps us to kill some time: \u201cBatshuayi now finally free from the graveyard of strikers which is Stamford Bridge where in truth he wasted six years of his life as well as ours. Hapless in front of goal, frequently offside and short of confidence, he looked every inch a Chelsea centre forward. He\u2019ll be remembered for his title-clinching goal late on at West Brom, but even then he managed to upset the travelling support by running to the wrong corner of the ground to celebrate, well his sense of direction was never very good. He\u2019ll never been forgiven for doing that.\u201d     9.02pm    58 min: Hazard dribbles down the middle of the park with purpose, and is hauled back by Ampadu. Another booking, and another player who\u2019ll miss the Poland game on Sunday.     9.00pm    56 min: Belgium ping a few triangles. Vertonghen fires a low cross into the six-yard box from the left. Ampadu is on hand to hook clear.     8.58pm    54 min: De Bruyne makes ground down the right and chips into the Welsh box. Some head tennis. Wales are defending desperately when Meunier bumbles onto the scene and witlessly clatters Apmadu on the edge of the box. A completely pointless challenge. The pressure on Wales released.     8.57pm    53 min: Belgium will be wondering how they\u2019re just a goal ahead. But here we suddenly are. The hosts attempt to rediscover their equilibrium with some patient midfield passing.     8.55pm    52 min: That was a superb run by Johnson, who is a prospect all right. Moore could hardly miss, so good was the cross, though take nothing away from a perfectly placed header.     8.54pm   GOAL! Belgium 2-1 Wales (Moore 50)  Now then! Now then! Johnson dribbles down the right. He takes on both Witzel and Carrasco, dropping a shoulder to advance towards the byline. He stands one up to the far post, where Moore rises highest, planting an unstoppable downward header past Courtois. Game on!     8.53pm    49 min: Mepham is awarded the first yellow card of the evening for unceremoniously clattering into the back of Hazard. He\u2019ll now miss the home fixture against Poland on Sunday.  Updated at 8.53pm BST    8.52pm    48 min: Tielemans shovels a diagonal pass towards Carrasco, just inside the Welsh box on the left. Carrasco takes the ball down, thinks about shooting, but tries to tee up Hazard instead. Wrong choice. Wales clear their lines.     8.50pm    47 min: A slow start to the second half. Nobody seems in too much of a mood to push things.     8.49pm    Belgium get the second half underway. No changes.      8.36pm    Calming half-time entertainment.      8.35pm   HALF TIME: Belgium 2-0 Wales  Wales have looked half-decent in attack, but otherwise they\u2019ve been very much second best. Belgium could easily have had a few more. They\u2019ve been magnificent. Here\u2019s Peter Oh: \u201cI\u2019m afraid even a rousing half-time speech by Michael Sheen himself won\u2019t fix this one.\u201d     8.33pm    45 min: Roberts races down the right and wins a corner. Could Wales grab something that could totally alter the momentum of this game? Well, nearly. The corner gets all the way through to Williams on the left. He\u2019s got time to trap and shape a shot towards the top right. Unfortunately it pings off Norrington-Davies\u2019s shoulder and over for a goal kick.     8.31pm    44 min: Nothing comes of that corner either. Wales could do with half time.     8.31pm    43 min: Nothing comes of the corner, which is half cleared. Hazard comes back at Wales and wins another.     8.30pm    42 min: Belgium, unruffled, go back up the other end and continue to probe. Suddenly Tielemans creams a long pass up the right flank. De Bruyne strides towards the box and threads a shot towards the bottom left. It\u2019s heading in, but Hennessey sticks out a boot to deflect it wide of the post.     8.29pm    40 min: Free kick for Wales out on the left. They load the Belgian box. James curls it into the mixer. Rodon wins a header at the far post. Witsel is forced to hack out of his six-yard box. Ampadu heads back goalwards. Courtois parries, and the hosts clear. Much better from Wales!  Updated at 8.30pm BST    8.26pm    39 min: Imagine what De Bruyne would do against opponents that don\u2019t bore him.     8.25pm   GOAL! Belgium 2-0 Wales (Batshuayi 38)  De Bruyne\u2019s already scored one. Now he\u2019s set one up. He powers into the Welsh box down the right. He\u2019s got the beating of Ampadu, and rolls across for Batshuayi, who can\u2019t miss from a couple of yards. It had been coming, to say the least.     8.24pm    36 min: Johnson twists and turns down the right. His tenacious dribble earns a corner off Carrasco. James hits it long \u2026 but it\u2019s an easy pick for Courtois, who tries to send De Bruyne away on the counter. Roberts comes across to put a stop to his gallop, and is brought down by De Bruyne for his trouble. Brave defending that nixed any notion of a break.     8.21pm    34 min: Belgium go up the other end and nearly make it two for the umpteenth time. Hazard cuts in from the left and his low curler whistles inches wide of the right-hand post. Not sure Hennessey had that covered.     8.21pm    33 min: The Welsh press bears fruit, as Belgium\u2019s attempt to play out from the back rebounds to the feet of James, who dribbles into the box from the right and takes a shot. It\u2019s blocked. Then the flag goes up for a handball against Moore, as it turns out that was how Wales snaffled possession in the first place. But it\u2019s something.     8.18pm    31 min: Hazard is at the heart of everything right now, as Belgium probe this way and that.     8.17pm    29 min: Belgium have enjoyed 68 percent of possession so far. They look even more dominant than that statistic suggests. The Welsh midfield is getting totally overrun.     8.15pm    27 min: There are huge gaps in the midfield for Belgium to romp into. Hazard strides down the middle and tees up De Bruyne, who has aeons to line up a screamer. He cannons a shot off the base of the left-hand post. The rebound falls to Carrasco, who is offside, but Hennessey isn\u2019t to know, and makes a fine block of a low shot. A second goal is surely just a matter of time. \u201cQuite a statement to bench Ward, who\u2019s actually playing (if awfully poorly) every week,\u201d writes Harriet Osborn. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a much needed fire under the seat.\u201d     8.12pm    25 min: Belgium really are knocking at the door for a second. Carrasco drops a shoulder to come in from the left. His shot is deflected out for a corner, from which Witsel flicks a header on for Batshuayi. The striker blazes wide right and high. Wales are hanging on a bit here.     8.11pm    24 min: Belgium paint some pretty triangles down the left. Then suddenly Batshuayi flicks De Bruyne free with a lovely no-look reverse pass. De Bruyne romps into the box and scuffs his shot from a tight angle. He really should have rolled across to tee up Tielemans.     8.10pm    22 min: More patient Belgian passing. They\u2019re beginning to make Wales chase. Possession at a premium for the visitors now.     8.08pm    20 min: Hazard sashays in from the left and rolls infield for De Bruyne, who has Meunier bombing down the inside-right channel, screaming for a pass as he reaches the edge of the box. De Bruyne decides to spin and take the shot on himself. Three rugby points. For once, De Bruyne makes the wrong decision.     8.06pm    18 min: That goal has understandably taken a bit of the wind from the Welsh sail. Shame, they\u2019d started so well. \u201cAs brilliant as KDB is, that was the attempted save of a keeper who hasn\u2019t played much this season say the S4C comms team,\u201d reports Phillip Wainwright. \u201cMust admit I agree.\u201d     8.04pm    16 min: A long ball down the middle nearly opens Wales up. Batshuayi looks to have sprinted clear of Norrington-Davies, but the Welsh midfielder fights back and gets a block in, just in time.     8.02pm    15 min: So nearly a second for the hosts. Carrasco turns Roberts inside out down the left and crosses low for Tielemans, who nearly steers the ball into the bottom-right corner again. This time the ball shaves the outside of the post. \u201cDammit,\u201d cries Matt Dony. \u201cAll Wales for ten minutes. One Belgian attack, and they score. Typical. Still, plenty of time for a Hal Robson-Kanu moment\u2026\u201d     8.01pm    13 min: Wales try to respond through Williams, sent scampering down the left by Moore. The resulting cross floats harmlessly out of play for a goal kick.     8.00pm    12 min: Hennessey got a hand to that, but couldn\u2019t stop it. Fierce yet forensic. De Bruyne is such a class act, like that\u2019s breaking news.     7.59pm   GOAL! Belgium 1-0 Wales (De Bruyne 10)  Well, scrub that. Belgium hog the ball for a bit. They patiently stroke it around, this way and that. Suddenly Batshuayi tears down the right flank. He\u2019s got Meunier racing by his side on the overlap, but instead cuts back for De Bruyne, who adjusts his body and steers a powerful sidefoot into the bottom right from the edge of the box. Sensational finish! He\u2019s not bored now!     7.56pm    8 min: Roberts throws long from the right. Moore wins a flick on, but there\u2019s nobody in white to take advantage. Courtois claims. Wales will be more than happy with the way these first few minutes have gone.     7.55pm    7 min: A chance for Carrasco to release De Bruyne down the left. His pass is too heavy, allowing Roberts to come across and play the ball off the Manchester City man and out for a goal kick. De Bruyne fumes quietly. Or perhaps he\u2019s just bored.     7.54pm    6 min: Belgium take a little of the sting out of things with some sterile possession at the back.     7.52pm    4 min: Tielemans, perhaps low on confidence given Leicester\u2019s troubles, ships possession with absurd ease in the centre circle. Johnson races off with attacking intent, only for the Welsh counter to be stopped in its tracks by the whistle because there are two balls on the pitch. Rob Page is not happy.     7.50pm    2 min: A fast start by Wales sees Williams cross deep from the left, then Johnson return the favour from the right. Neither delivery is of the required quality, but the early signs are that Wales have come here to give it a go.     7.49pm    8 seconds: Moore sticks his elbow into Vertonghen\u2019s jaw and is pretty lucky not to go into the book. An early calling card.     7.47pm    After both teams take the knee in a gesture of solidarity against discrimination, Wales get the ball rolling. A bit more noise coming from the crowd now, to be fair.     7.45pm    The teams are out! Belgium wear red, forcing Wales into second-choice white. The King Baudouin Stadium isn\u2019t filled to capacity, far from it, and so the atmosphere is slightly lacking, though the Welsh travelling support are doing their bit by giving it plenty. We\u2019ll be off after the anthems. Enough time for Mary Waltz to set a poser: \u201cHow can it be that Belgium, with all that amazing talent, has underperformed so consistently?\u201d No idea, Mary, sorry.      7.31pm    Rob Page speaks to S4C. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone as strong as we possibly could. It would be too much of a risk to play Gareth Bale from the start. No doubt he\u2019ll play some part tonight, but it would have been crazy to play him from the start. We\u2019re up against good opposition, and we\u2019re prepared for a tough battle. It\u2019s all about this game. They want to finish top of the group, we want to stay in the division, so there\u2019s everything to play for.\u201d     7.07pm    Gareth Bale, currently in the process of increasing his match fitness with Los Angeles FC, starts this one on the bench. Goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey takes the captain\u2019s armband. Aaron Ramsey, Ben Davies, Harry Wilson and Joe Allen are all missing through injury. In other superstar news, Kevin De Bruyne starts for Belgium, while Real Madrid\u2019s Eden Hazard captains the side. Leicester City\u2019s Youri Tielemans also starts.      6.55pm   The teams  Belgium: Courtois, Debast, Alderweireld, Vertonghen, Meunier, Tielemans, Witsel, Carrasco, De Bruyne, Batshuayi, Hazard.Subs: Mignolet, Casteels, Theate, Openda, Mertens, De Ketelaere, Trossard, Onana, Dendoncker, Vanaken, Castagne, Saelemaekers. Wales: Hennessey, C Roberts, Rodon, Mepham, N Williams, Smith, Ampadu, Norrington-Davies, James, Moore, Johnson.Subs: Ward, King, Gunter, Cabango, Levitt, T Roberts, Bale, Morrell, J Williams, Harris, Thomas, Harris. Referee: Ali Palab\u0131y\u0131k (Turkey).     6.45pm   Preamble  Wales\u2019s A4 Nations League campaign took an understandable back seat to their World Cup qualifying bid. Robert Page and his Qatar-bound men wouldn\u2019t change a thing, but as a result relegation from the top tier of Uefa\u2019s shiny new tournament looks more likely than not. If they\u2019re not to go down, they\u2019ll need to at least one win from their last two matches, two if Poland beat the Netherlands tonight. Small problem: Wales have never beaten Belgium on their own pitch, and since knocking them out of Euro 2016, are winless in three against the world number two side, losing on their last visit 3-1 in 2021. Big game coming up, then; just as well Wales have developed a habit of turning up for them. Kick off is at 7.45pm BST. It\u2019s on!  "

                    "body": "David and Jasmine Pringle had woken up at 4am to travel to Manchester airport from County Durham after Qatar Airways told them to expect huge delays for their flight to Doha. \u201cLeaving the house at 5am for a 3pm flight isn\u2019t ideal,\u201d David said. \u201cBut it\u2019s been over two years since we last saw Jasmine\u2019s family in the Philippines and we\u2019ve been desperate to make the journey to see her elderly parents. We\u2019ve paid the best part of \u00a33k for the flights. Now we just want to get there.\u201d \u201cWhile we\u2019re waiting to hear news of our flight, it\u2019s worrying to see how few people are wearing masks or maintaining a social distance,\u201d he added. \u201cThe travel restrictions may have been lifted, but people seem to forget the disease is still very much with us.\u201d Passengers travelling via Manchester airport are once again having to endure long wait times and uncertainty over their flights \u2013 but this time before they have even checked in. Surging passenger numbers, alongside staff sickness and lack of recruitment, have created a standstill at security in recent days. Just one day after managing director Karen Smart stepped down amid criticism of long security queues and packed terminals, the issue now facing passengers is knowing how much time to allow to get through security \u2013 and how much money they should put aside for food, transport and extra Covid tests before they can board the plane. The airport is implementing measures to get to grips with the chaos it has seen in recent weeks, but many people are now finding that, having been told by airlines to arrive hours in advance for their flight, they are enduring waits of up to eight hours in terminal buildings before they can even be checked in. Manchester is a major international transport hub, drawing passengers from across the north of England and beyond. The Guardian spoke to travellers from as far afield as Bradford, North Lincolnshire, Newcastle, Tynemouth and Cumbria \u2013 many armed with Covid test results, masks and gifts for relatives they haven\u2019t seen since before the pandemic. Geraldine and Tony Walker were also waiting to board the flightto Doha, using it as a stop-off before travelling on to Adelaide to see family.  \u201cWe\u2019ve paid nearly \u00a3100 each for PCR tests, travelled in from Brighouse in Yorkshire, and downloaded codes from several apps on to our phones to prove our vaccine status \u2013 it\u2019s taken quite a lot of effort and expense to get to this point, so we hope everything goes smoothly once we eventually board the plane,\u201d Tony said. Navdeep and Manpreet Singh, a couple from Leeds, were taking their daughter to Delhi. Their wait wasless than 20 minutes once they had arrived at the airport, but Navdeep acknowledged the long wait times others had endured. \u201cThere are children here and older people,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the airlines want us here early then they should be willing to pay for refreshments.\u201d  Those arriving at Manchester after long journeys were also keen to comment on how expensive and complex it is for those landing in the city to exit the airport. Sisters Hannah and Rachel Singer, from New York, were waiting to be collected after travelling to the UK via Dublin and Paris respectively. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing like the US,\u201d said Hannah. \u201cOver there you can collect someone easily from the airport. We\u2019re waiting for our dad now \u2013 he\u2019ll have to navigate the car park, pay a fee, and then wait for us to find him.\u201d  The airport, along with much of the aviation industry, has struggled to recruit staff made redundant after the pandemic shut down airports and travel. As the Easter getaway increases travel, similar problems have hit other airports including Heathrow and Birmingham. More than 1,000 UK flights have been axed in recent days due to crews being off sick amid a rise in Covid cases. A Manchester airport spokesperson said: \u201cAs we work to recover from the devastating effects of the pandemic, a rapid increase in passenger numbers together with the staff shortages and recruitment challenges our industry is facing, means at certain times our operations are strained. \u201cWe are doing all we can to recruit the staff we need to meet demand at all times, so that all passengers can have this experience. However, this is taking time due to the lengthy vetting and training processes involved. That is why we have been advising travellers that there may be, at times, longer queues than normal.\u201d"

                    "body": "  9.03pm   Closing summary  Washington continues to feel the aftershocks from yesterday\u2019s January 6 committee hearing, and its vote to send a subpoena to Donald Trump. The congressional panel claims he was the singular figure responsible for the attack on the Capitol \u2013 but the summons is more of statement than an actual legal strategy. Nonetheless, it\u2019s possible the former president may actually appear before the lawmakers. Reports indicate he would be open to doing so, but Trump has not publicly weighed in, yet. Here\u2019s what happened today:  The FBI\u2019s No 2 was warned that a number of its agents were sympathetic to the January 6 rioters. It\u2019s unclear what impact that has had on the investigation into the attack. A new book argues that Democratic leaders missed an opportunity to get some Republicans onboard when they first impeached Trump in 2019, setting the stage for him to try to overturn the election the following year. Top lawmakers scrambled for help from the department of defense, the governor of Virginia and other parties after the Capitol was overrun on January 6, according to gripping footage shown at the congressional inquiry yesterday. The January 6 committee is investigating communications between a Secret Service agent and members of the Oath Keepers militia group, some of whom are currently on trial for seditious conspiracy charges in Washington. Congress may finally repeal the authorizations justifying American involvement in the Gulf war and the invasion of Iraq.   Updated at 9.24pm BST    8.58pm   January 6 committee will 'await a serious response' from Trump: lawmaker  A Democratic member of the January 6 committee said it will continue to wait for a response from Donald Trump to the subpoena it approved yesterday, which could compel his testimony before the panel investigating the Capitol attack. In a tweet, Adam Schiff rejected a letter Trump had sent to the committee\u2019s chair that attacked its work and reiterated a number of baseless theories about alleged fraudulent conduct in the 2020 election:  Trump has not said if he will honor the subpoena, though reports have emerged that he is open to speaking to lawmakers. Should he choose to fight it, it\u2019s unlikely the court battle would be resolved before the committee\u2019s mandate runs out at the end of the year.     8.50pm    Trump and his allies\u2019 attempts to interfere with the election in Georgia is the subject of yet another investigation ensnaring the ex-president, and CNN reports one of his operatives has testified as part of the inquiry. Last week, Scott Hall spoke for more than three hours to a special grand jury empaneled by district attorney Fani Willis in Fulton county, Georgia to investigate the meddling campaign, CNN said. While it\u2019s not known what he told the jurors, Hall, a Republican poll watcher in Fulton county, was part of a group who may have improperly accessed voter information in another county. Here\u2019s more from CNN:  On January 7, 2021, the day after the attack on the US Capitol, Hall and others connected to Trump lawyer Sidney Powell spent hours inside a restricted area of the Coffee County elections office, where they set up computers near election equipment and appeared to access voting data. Willis\u2019s criminal investigation recently expanded to include the breach of voting systems in the deeply-red Coffee County by operatives working for Powell. Hall did not respond to repeated requests for comment. According to court documents obtained by CNN, Hall\u2019s role investigating supposed voter fraud in Georgia is also referenced in a November 2020 email that the head of Trump\u2019s election day operations in Georgia received from the state\u2019s Republican Party Chairman. \u201cScott Hall has been looking into the election on behalf of the President at the request of David Bossie. I know him,\u201d David Shafer, the Georgia Republican Party chairman wrote on November 20, 2020, to Robert Sinners, the head of Trump\u2019s Georgia election day operations. Shafer, who was among the 16 individuals who served as a fake Trump elector in Georgia, has been informed he is a target in the Fulton County DA\u2019s criminal investigation.      8.20pm    Trump has broadcast plans to run for president again in 2024 practically since leaving the White House last year, and many fear he would steamroll his opponents in the primaries to win the GOP nomination, as he did in 2016. But unlike the campaign that delivered his shock victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton six years ago, Trump is a known quantity by now, and some Republicans think he\u2019s simply unelectable, no matter how popular he may be among a segment of the party.  Republican former speaker of the house Paul Ryan made that very argument yesterday in an interview for the Teneo Insights Series:      8.05pm    The January 6 committee made clear in its hearing yesterday that it continued to have reservations about the Secret Service\u2019s candor with its investigation. The agency tasked with protecting the president and other top officials has been under scrutiny ever since it was revealed it permanently deleted all of agents\u2019 text messages from around the time of the insurrection, citing a pre-planned technology upgrade. MSNBC has a good rundown of the lawmakers\u2019 comments about the Secret Service:  Today, there was pushback, of sorts, from a spokesman for the agency, Politico reports:      7.49pm    Speaking of books, former vice-president Mike Pence will release a memoir about his time serving under Donald Trump on 15 November. The New York Times has obtained the book\u2019s description included on its jacket, which pretty much lines up with what is known about his relationship with the former president:      7.33pm    In August, Vermont\u2019s Democratic senator Patrick Leahy \u2013 the most senior lawmaker in all of Congress - published a memoir reflecting on his decades in Washington politics. That included the American invasion of Iraq in 2003, which he opposed. Longtime Washington journalist Garrett M. Graff read Leahy\u2019s book and noted that the senator\u2019s opposition to the invasion had won the attention of some mysterious, like-minded individuals who sought the senator out:             7.12pm   Senators plan renewed push to repeal Iraq, Gulf war authorizations  A movement is gathering in the Senate to repeal Congress\u2019 authorizations allowing the United States to attack Iraq. Democratic senator Tim Kaine and Republican senator Todd Young are backing a renewed effort to pass a bill repealing the two Authorizations for Use of Military Force enacted in 2002 and 1991, which gave legal justification for America\u2019s involvement in the Iraq and Gulf wars, respectively.     A similar attempt passed the House last year and had Joe Biden\u2019s support, but ultimately didn\u2019t make it through the Senate. The latest effort is expected to be included in a defense spending bill that will be a top priority when both houses of Congress reconvene next month.     6.50pm    Few have embraced the baseless conspiracies about the 2020 election like Donald Trump, and he\u2019s widely expected to run again for the presidency in 2024.  The big question is: when will he announce it? Democrats hope he does so before the midterm elections, so they can refocus voters\u2019 attention on all that went on during his administration. Politico reports that the former president is keeping it vague:  Meanwhile, Republican senators Tom Cotton and Tim Scott have both taken steps indicating they are contemplating a 2024 run, according to Politico.     6.32pm    More than two-thirds of Republicans seeking office this November have cast doubt on the results of the 2020 election, reported the New York Times.  They include candidates for the U.S. House and Senate, and the state offices of governor, secretary of state and attorney general \u2014 many with clear shots to victory, and some without a chance. They are united by at least one issue: They have all expressed doubt about the legitimacy of the 2020 election. And they are the new normal of the Republican Party. More than 370 people \u2014 a vast majority of Republicans running for these offices in November \u2014 have questioned and, at times, outright denied the results of the 2020 election despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, according to a monthslong New York Times investigation. These candidates represent a sentiment that is spreading in the Republican Party, rupturing a bedrock principle of democracy: that voters decide elections and candidates accept results.

Updated at 6.41pm BST    6.13pm    Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden released a statement on a Thursday shooting in Raleigh, North Carolina, where five people were killed and two were injured. The suspect, a 15-year old white male, is in custody and in critical condition. From the White house press office:  Jill and I are grieving with the families in Raleigh, North Carolina, whose loved ones were killed and wounded in yet another mass shooting in America. We are thinking of yet another community shaken and shattered as they mourn the loss of friends and neighbors, including an off-duty police officer.As we mourn with the people of Raleigh, we are grateful for the law enforcement and other first responders, including federal law enforcement who were on the scene last night and into this morning. My Administration is working closely with Governor Cooper to assist local authorities in this investigation to the fullest extent needed. Enough. We\u2019ve grieved and prayed with too many families who have had to bear the terrible burden of these mass shootings. Too many families have had spouses, parents, and children taken from them forever. This year, and even in just the five months since Buffalo and Uvalde, there are too many mass shootings across America, including ones that don\u2019t even make the national news. For the lives we\u2019ve lost and the lives we can save, I took historic action to stop gun violence in our nation, including signing the most significant gun safety law in nearly 30 years. But we must do more. We must pass an assault weapons ban. The American people support this commonsense action to get weapons of war off our streets. House Democrats have already passed it. The Senate should do the same. Send it to my desk and I\u2019ll sign it. May God bless our fellow Americans we lost and their families and may He grant the wounded the strength to recover in Raleigh, North Carolina.   Updated at 6.41pm BST    5.53pm   FBI was warned agents were sympathetic to Capitol rioters \u2013 report  A top FBI official was warned that a large number of bureau employees were sympathetic to Capitol rioters who threatened the lives of law makers.  NBC News reported that Paul Abbate, number two at the FBI, was warned about agents within the bureau showing sympathy to 6 January participants. The email, sent from an unnamed person, read:   There\u2019s no good way to say it, so I\u2019ll just be direct: from my first-hand and second-hand information from conversations since January 6th there is, at best, a sizable percentage of the employee population that felt sympathetic to the group that stormed the Capitol\u2026 Several also lamented that the only reason this violent activity is getting more attention is because of \u2018political correctness.  The email also added that several agents felt that the Capitol riots were no different than racial justice protests that happened in summer 2020.  Abbate responded to the email with: \u201cThank you [redacted] for sharing everything below.\u201d The FBI declined to comment on the email, reported NBC.   Updated at 6.41pm BST    5.35pm   The day so far  Washington continues to feel the aftershocks from yesterday\u2019s January 6 committee hearing, and its vote to send a subpoena to Donald Trump. The congressional panel claims he was the singular figure responsible for the attack on the Capitol \u2013 but the summons is more of statement than an actual legal strategy. Nonetheless, it\u2019s possible the former president may actually appear before the lawmakers. Reports indicate he would be open to doing so, but Trump has not publicly weighed in, yet. Here\u2019s what has happened today so far:  A new book argues that Democratic leaders missed an opportunity to get some Republicans onboard when they first impeached Trump in 2019, setting the stage for him to try to overturn the election the following year. Top lawmakers scrambled for help from the department of defense, the governor of Virginia and other parties after the Capitol was overrun on January 6, according to gripping footage shown at the congressional inquiry yesterday. The January 6 committee is investigating communications between a Secret Service agent and members of the Oath Keepers militia group, some of whom are currently on trial for seditious conspiracy charges in Washington.      5.19pm    Many people testified to the January 6 committee. Doing so did not come without costs. Here\u2019s what Alyssa Farah, a former communications director in the Trump White House, said on \u201cThe View\u201d about happened after the panel aired her testimony:  And here is what she told the committee:      5.00pm    Did the January 6 committee\u2019s hearings change your mind about what happened that day? Were you surprised by the evidence presented? Or are you wondering what the big deal is? Whatever your answers to these questions, the Guardian\u2019s community team is looking for readers\u2019 input, and has a survey you can fill out at the link below:      4.44pm    The Oath Keepers were mentioned repeatedly at yesterday\u2019s January 6 hearing, and Politico reports their lawyers have attempted to make that an issue as they stand trial for seditious conspiracy \u2013 without success:         4.28pm   January 6 committee investigating connection between Secret Service agent, Oath Keepers: media  Investigators with the January 6 committee are looking into communications between a Secret Service agent and the Oath Keepers militia group, one of the most violent actors during the attack on the Capitol, NBC News reports:  Several Oath Keepers are currently on trial in a Washington federal court on seditious conspiracy charges. The Secret Service has become one of the agencies most scrutinized by the congressional committee investigating the attack, after it was revealed it deleted all of its agents\u2019 text messages from around the time of the insurrection during what it said was a pre-planned technology upgrade. The House lawmakers recently obtained more than one million communications from the Secret Service, portions of which were used as evidence in yesterday\u2019s hearing.     4.07pm    While sitting and former presidents have testified before Congress in the past, Politico reports that subpoenaing a former commander in chief is far more contentious. In 1953, former president Harry Truman defied a subpoena from the infamous House Un-American Activities Committee. \u201cIt is just as important to the independence of the Executive that the actions of the President should not be subjected to questioning by the Congress after he has completed his term of office as that his actions should not be questioned while he is serving as President,\u201d he said in a lengthy speech explaining his refusal to attend. The January 6 committee could, of course, go to court to force Trump to comply, assuming a judge \u2013 or more likely judges \u2013 agrees. But they simply don\u2019t have the time. Their mandate expires at the end of the year, at the same time as this Congress terms out, and any court challenge would likely take months to resolve.     3.52pm    Not all Trump administration scandals involve the former president. Stephanie Kirchgaessner reports a Senate committee leaders wants answers about a real estate property deal involving Jared Kushner, a top aide to the former president: A financial firm that operates billions of dollars in real estate properties around the world is facing new questions from the powerful chairman of the Senate finance committee about whether Qatar was secretly involved in the $1.2bn (\u00a31bn) rescue of a Fifth Avenue property owned by Jared Kushner\u2019s family while Kushner was serving in the White House. Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat who leads the finance committee, has given the chief executive of Toronto-based Brookfield Asset Management until 24 October to answer a series of detailed questions about a 2018 deal in which Brookfield paid Kushner Companies for a 99-year lease on the family\u2019s marquee 666 Fifth Avenue property. When the deal was announced in August 2018, it was seen as the end of a drawn-out saga surrounding the property. The rescue, it was said in media reports, generated enough money for the Kushner family to pay $1.1bn (\u00a3970m) of debt on the building and buy out a partner. In a statement on Thursday, Wyden accused Brookfield of stonewalling his committee and refusing to answer questions about the transaction, including whether Brookfield \u201cintentionally misled\u201d the public when it said that \u201cno Qatar-linked entity\u201d had been involved in the deal. In fact, it has since been alleged by Wyden that Brookfield used a Qatari-backed fund \u2013 called Brookfield Property Partners \u2013 to fund the transaction. At the time of the deal, Wyden said, the Qatari Investment Authority was the fund\u2019s second largest investor.      3.35pm   Footage shows congressional leaders scrambling for help on January 6  One of the most gripping moments of the January 6 committee\u2019s hearing yesterday came when the panel aired footage of congressional leaders scrambling for help after the Capitol was overrun. Here\u2019s what the video showed: New footage of the January 6 riots at the US Capitol shows House speaker Nancy Pelosi calmly trying to take charge of the situation as she sheltered at Fort McNair, two miles south of the Capitol.\u201cThere has to be some way,\u201d she told colleagues, \u201cwe can maintain the sense that people have that there is some security or some confidence that government can function and that you can elect the president of the United States.\u201dThen an unidentified voice interjected with alarming news: lawmakers on the House floor had begun putting on teargas masks in preparation for a breach. Pelosi asked the woman to repeat what she said.   Updated at 4.10pm BST    3.20pm    While Trump twice escaped conviction by Congress, The Guardian\u2019s Sam Levine finds the evidence laid out by the January 6 committee could form the backbone of a criminal case against the former president: After more than a year of work that consisted of interviewing 1,000-plus witnesses and reviewing hundreds of thousands of documents, the committee investigating the January 6 attack on the Capitol chose a simple message for its final public hearing: Donald Trump was singularly responsible for the attack. Since its first hearing in June, the committee\u2019s work has been aimed at two audiences. One of those has been the broad American public. Tactfully using video, the committee has told a disciplined, clear story of what happened on January 6, and the days leading up to it, filled with jaw-dropping soundbites from Trump\u2019s closest aides. But the committee\u2019s public coda on Thursday appeared more directed at its second audience: an audience of one, the US attorney general, Merrick Garland. Garland will ultimately decide whether to bring criminal charges against Trump over January 6, and the committee\u2019s work, which has run parallel to the justice department\u2019s investigation, has made a public case for bringing charges, attempting to bring along public support for doing so.      3.04pm    A new books argues that the way Democrats handled Trump\u2019s first impeachment in 2019 laid the groundwork for the lawless streak he exhibited when he tried to overturn the following year\u2019s elections, Politico reports. In \u201cUnchecked,\u201d written by Politico reporter Rachael Bade and Washington Post reporter Karoun Demirjian, House speaker Nancy Pelosi is shown as being caught between two wings of the Democratic party as it weighs how to respond to Trump\u2019s pressuring of Ukraine\u2019s government to investigate Joe Biden. One group, composed mostly of progressives, wanted a sprawling inquiry into all of the then-president\u2019s alleged misdeeds, while another, made up of Democrats in vulnerable seats, wanted a narrowly tailored investigation into the Ukraine affair that wouldn\u2019t take too long. The latter group won out, but according to the book, Pelosi missed opportunities to wrangle some Republicans into supporting Trump\u2019s impeachment \u2013 though the book concedes the effort may well have been a long shot, even if she tried. The Senate ultimately acquitted Trump, and the book finds that decision emboldened Trump to attempt further schemes \u2013 like his plot to overturn the 2020 election. Here\u2019s how Politico puts it:  In the end, one political truism superseded all the others: What happens in January of an election year will be ancient history by the time voters cast ballots. This was especially true in 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic seemed to emerge just as Democrats were licking their wounds from the impeachment trial acquittal. Soon after, Trump would begin sowing the seeds of what would become his effort to overturn defeat in the presidential election, and by November, impeachment seemed an asterisk in a year that had become chaotic for many other reasons. Ultimately, Democrats took the White House, even though Pelosi\u2019s House majority shrank slightly after 2020. House managers of Trump\u2019s first impeachment have insisted to this day that their existential warnings played a role in voters deeming him unfit for a second term. His actions to subvert his 2020 loss, they argue, were evidence that Republicans\u2019 decision to acquit him had left him feeling unchecked.      2.41pm    Trump hasn\u2019t yet publicly said if he\u2019d testify before the January 6 committee, as their subpoena compels him to. But his political action committee has today distributed to reporters this letter, dated yesterday and addressed to the committee\u2019s chair. The 14-page epistle is mostly a rehash of his baseless theories that the 2020 election was stolen from him, and a defense of his conduct on January 6. It opens with this line: \u201cTHE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 2020 WAS RIGGED AND STOLEN!\u201d It\u2019s unclear if Trump himself wrote it, but based on the prose, it\u2019s difficult not to imagine his voice when reading it. Consider the second sentence:  The same group of Radical Left Democrats who utilized their Majority position in Congress to create the fiction of Russia, Russia, Russia, Impeachment Hoax #1, Impeachment Hoax #2, the $48 Million Mueller Report (which ended in No Collusion!), Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine, the atrocious and illegal Spying on my Campaign, and so much more, are the people who created this Committee of highly partisan political Hacks and Thugs whose sole function is to destroy the lives of many hard-working American Patriots, whose records in life have been unblemished until this point of attempted ruination.   Updated at 2.41pm BST    2.21pm    There are plenty of instances of former presidents testifying before congress, and in fact, even sitting presidents have done so, according to the US Senate. But such an appearance hasn\u2019t been made in a while. The last former president to answer questions on Capitol Hill was Gerald Ford, who appeared before a Senate subcommittee on the constitution in 1983. He was also the last president in office to testify, during a 1974 House subcommittee hearing about his decision to pardon former president Richard Nixon for various charges related to the Watergate scandal. Up until January 6, historians viewed Watergate as perhaps the worst political scandal in American history. But the insurrection at the Capitol may well have eclipsed that \u2013 and Trump could follow in the footsteps of his predecessors and appear before lawmakers to discuss his role in it.     1.59pm   Testify before January 6 committee? Trump would do it, reports say  Good morning, US politics blog readers. Yesterday\u2019s big news was that the January 6 committee had issued a subpoena to Donald Trump, in an attempt to compel the testimony of a man they say was responsible above all others for the deadly insurrection at the Capitol. You\u2019d be right not to get your hopes up that the former president would honor their summons \u2013 he\u2019s stymied various attempts to compel his behavior or hold him accountable over the years with lengthy court challenges, and the congressional subpoena seems like it could meet the same fate. But media outlets including the New York Times and Fox News report that Trump actually would like to speak to lawmakers \u2013 assuming he can do so live. We may hear from him today on what course of action he\u2019s decided to take. Here\u2019s a look at what else is happening today:  Liz Cheney, the Republican vice-chair of the January 6 committee, will talk about defending democracy at Notre Dame University at 2.30pm eastern time. Washington\u2019s fury towards Saudi Arabia will be the subject when Democratic representative Ro Khanna, an advocate of cracking down on Riyadh over its backing of the recent Opec+ oil production cut, speaks with the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft at 12pm eastern time. Joe Biden is continuing his trip out west with a speech in Orange county, California, about \u201clowering costs for American families\u201d and a stop in Oregon. There, the president will campaign for the state\u2019s Democratic candidate for governor, who appears to be struggling polls.   "

                    "body": "Mark Ricketts might not have played in the biggest game of his long career \u2013 the one that will surely define him. The Boreham Wood captain had been out for almost four weeks with a knee injury and he had trained only once, and pretty lightly at that, on the day before the club\u2019s FA Cup fourth-round tie at Bournemouth on 6 February. The 37-year-old was simply not fit. But he did play, he scored, he ran himself into the ground until his substitution on 87 minutes and Boreham Wood won 1-0 to set up a fifth-round trip to Everton on Thursday night. The fourth round was already uncharted territory for the National League promotion chasers. They are now into a glorious kind of crazy.  Ricketts was a young professional at Charlton, although he never made a first-team matchday squad. He played seven matches on loan at MK Dons, who were in League One at the time but, since 2006, he has been playing non-league. Three seasons at Ebbsfleet, seven at Woking and now into his sixth at Boreham Wood; all but three spent in the top tier of the non-league game. It is difficult to overstate Ricketts\u2019 popularity at Boreham Wood. He is generous and humble, and if there was to be a hero against Bournemouth, most people would have wanted it to be him. The holding midfielder is also not known as a prolific scorer. Before Bournemouth, he had six career goals. And so it really is a beautiful thing to hear him relive his moment \u2013 the low sidefoot after an unconvincing Bournemouth clearance that had come to him seemingly in slow motion. \u201cThe shot went in pretty slowly, too,\u201d Ricketts says. \u201cIt glanced off the post and trickled across the line. There was a lot of waiting. But once I saw it go in, it was just a release of pure euphoria. I can\u2019t even explain the feeling of running off towards our fans. \u201cI saw my wife, Sheryll, and our daughters, Emilie and Aria, who are eight and four, in the stand, as well. My mate was next to them and he was holding Aria up above his head so she could see.  \u201cEvery time I tell the story, it makes me smile and remembering the kids being there \u2026 that topped it for me. Hopefully it will live with them forever. I\u2019ll probably have to play it a few times for Aria on TV but I think the eldest will remember it. \u201cWhen I went to pick Emilie up from school the next day, her class had made up a little display, saying congratulations and all the kids were clapping. It\u2019s all stuff that makes you well up. At my career stage, you start to think that moments like that are gone and beyond you. So to get it now is amazing.\u201d What price another one at Goodison Park? The odds are even more ridiculous, not least because Ricketts is in another fitness battle, having damaged the knee again at Torquay on Tuesday of last week. The previous time, he had an injection to reduce the inflammation but that is not an option. The injury is too recent. \u201cI\u2019d be devastated to miss out,\u201d Ricketts says, but does a veteran of 16 non-league seasons fail a fitness test for Everton? He did a bit of ball work on Tuesday, a bit more on Wednesday. \u201cI really don\u2019t know,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes you wake up, especially when you get to my age, and feel awful and the next day you feel a million dollars. I\u2019m just praying.\u201d Ricketts\u2019 mind goes back to the phone call he had with the Boreham Wood manager, Luke Garrard, after the training session before the Bournemouth tie, which had gone OK but not brilliantly. Garrard told him that he did not care. Ricketts would be leading the team out even if he could last only 15 or 20 minutes. \u201cHe said it was the least I deserved for what I\u2019d done for the club,\u201d Ricketts says. \u201cThat sums him up. He\u2019s an incredible man. I felt a bit emotional after that call. It meant the world to me.\u201d Ricketts has stories to tell from his days at Charlton, who he joined from Wimbledon at 16. Such as the time he played at centre-half for the reserves against an Arsenal team that included Robin van Persie and Nicklas Bendtner. It was Charlton\u2019s golden era in the Premier League and Scott Parker, now the Bournemouth manager, was the star player. Ricketts trained with the first team and played the odd reserve match with Parker, who visited the Boreham Wood dressing room to congratulate them after the Cup tie. \u201cThere was a silence among our whole squad,\u201d Ricketts says. \u201cThere was that respect for him straight away. He\u2019s a class act.\u201d Ricketts had been at Wimbledon from the age of 11 and there was bad blood when, in his words, Charlton \u201ccame in and sort of nicked me away\u201d. It went to a tribunal and one of the settlement clauses involved any club that wanted to take him on loan having to make a payment to Wimbledon.  \u201cThat was one of the reasons why I ended up going to MK Dons [in November 2005],\u201d Ricketts says. \u201cBy then, Wimbledon had become MK Dons and they waived the payment to take me on loan.\u201d Ricketts returned to Charlton in February 2006 rather than remain at MK Dons for the season, as he had the option to do. He did so mainly to try to get a club for the following season, knowing that Charlton would not keep him on. \u201cA terrible, terrible decision,\u201d Ricketts says. \u201cI should have stayed at MK Dons and got more games under my belt. Finding something permanent never worked out and I ended up at Ebbsfleet.\u201d Ricketts has been shaped by the non-league, his mentality hardened by it. Away from football, he has become a qualified personal trainer, although he has not taken on clients since the start of the pandemic. It is partly because he is maxed out with his sixth and final year of an Open University degree in Computing and IT with Business. It is dissertation time and he is designing a web application that integrates players\u2019 physiological data \u2013 such as that from GPS vests \u2013 with information about their wellbeing as collected via questionnaires. The Everton tie is all that matters at the moment. Boreham Wood will wear a specially designed black away kit to avoid a clash, paid for by their opponents, and it reinforces the uniqueness of the occasion. Ricketts just wants to be a part of it."

England back on top  49th over: England 202-5 (Brook 74, Stokes 16) Babar, trying something different at last, gives Agha Salman a go with his off-breaks. The batters milk him for a few singles and that is the close, with England back in control after threatening to teeter into a ditch. Harry Brook and Ben Duckett, two fringe figures, have played like elder statesmen, easing their way to 150 between them. Nobody else made many but Ben Stokes is still there, in his sober white-ball mode so far, ready to revert to red in tooth and claw tomorrow. England lead by 281, which happens to be what they scored in their first innings. Their spinners, Jack Leach and Joe Root, surprised us this morning by engineering a Pakistan collapse. Root may be in danger of becoming a bowler who bats a bit. For Pakistan, Abrar Ahmed has ten wickets on debut \u2013 two of them Root\u2019s \u2013 but as things stand he must feel he is heading for defeat. Thanks for your company and correspondence. We\u2019ll be back first thing tomorrow for the third and possibly last day of this fast-forward Test. In the meantime, does anyone know of some other England match we can find to entertain us?  Updated at 12.03pm GMT    11.52am    48th over: England 197-5 (Brook 72, Stokes 13) Stokes, making himself more comfortable against Abrar, pulls the googly for two. A camera catches a flock of somethings wheeling round in a peachy sky, as if they\u2019re wondering what\u2019s going on. Talking of birds, here\u2019s John Tumbridge. \u201cTMS told us earlier that Duncan Fletcher (remember him?) is currently in South Africa and is attempting to photograph every one of the 970 bird species in Southern Africa. He\u2019s currently on about 750 after five years. Is there ever a more perfect 100% overlapping Venn diagram than bird-watching and cricket?\u201d Ha. Not quite 100, as I\u2019ve just demonstrated, but an interesting point.     11.45am    47th over: England 192-5 (Brook 71, Stokes 9) Hang on, Babar is going back to pace, summoning Mohammad Ali, so the umps must be saying the light isn\u2019t too bad. Or else Babar just wants the day to end \u2026 though Nasser reckons he should be wanting to stay out there. \u201cThe only way Pakistan win this game,\u201d he says, \u201cis to take the next wicket now.\u201d And it needs to be the wicket of Brook, because he scores so fast that he could get another fifty with just the tail for company.  Updated at 11.46am GMT    11.41am    46th over: England 189-5 (Brook 70, Stokes 8) Abrar manages to keep Brook quiet and goes for just three singles. The umpires are conferring, probably about the light, though I like to think they\u2019re discussing that stroke of genius from Brook and deciding that if he can do that, the light must be absolutely fine.  \u201cIt is such a pleasure see people playing sport with such joy,\u201d says Denis. \u201cI am tired of doleful players and hangdog coaches with the world on their shoulders. It is only a game and not life and death! All English male teams should ask Stokes to captain them. He would make a great Number 7 with his competitiveness and a gritty midfielder. All hail the joy of cricket. All hail Ben Stokes.\u201d Ha. I\u2019m not sure even Stokes would pick himself ahead of Declan Rice.     11.37am    45th over: England 186-5 (Brook 68, Stokes 7) Zahid sticks with his dismal Giles impersonation, and Brook\u2019s not having it. He stands outside leg stump and sweeps fine for four, then cover-drives, inside-out, right out of the rough. On the evidence of these two Tests, he\u2019s going to be a superstar.      11.33am    44th over: England 176-5 (Brook 58, Stokes 7) Stokes is content with singles at the moment, so he does seem to be laying down his dogma and playing the situation. Brook is making it easy for him with his easy fluency. Again he waits for the bad ball and punishes it, late-cutting Abrar for four, like Joe Root on speed.      11.30am    43rd over: England 171-5 (Brook 54, Stokes 6) Babar Azam has 99 problems here (and the pitch is one \u2013 it\u2019s not doing much). Among them is the fact that Zahid Mahmood can\u2019t manage a maiden. Bowling to Brook, he does string together a few dots, but only by going round the wicket into the rough outside the leg stump. A leg-spinner reduced to bowling like Ashley Giles. Here, on a different tack, is Tom van der Gucht. \u201cI know Stokes publicly backed Foakes,\u201d he says, \u201cand explained that Pope\u2019s selection as keeper was a horses for courses option bringing balance to the the team by allowing a second spinner and Wood, but Foakes must look at which way the wind is blowing and worry. \u201cWhen Bairstow is fit again, there will be a plethora of batting options available in the Bazball mould... Duckett, Crawley, Brookes, Bairstow, Pope, Livingstone... but not many places. Considering how JB epitomised and led the revolution last summer, he must be a shoo-in when he\u2019s fit, but who for? Brooks looks the future... Pope seems to offer more battingwise... It\u2019s sad, but the silky gloveman with model good looks doesn\u2019t seem to quite cut the mustard for the Bazball style.\u201d  Updated at 11.31am GMT    11.25am    42nd over: England 170-5 (Brook 54, Stokes 5) Abrar ties Brook down for a few deliveries, but then floats one up and gets thumped down the ground. \u201cThe more he\u2019s faced him,\u201d says Nasser of Brook, \u201cthe more\u2019s he\u2019s picked him, and the more he\u2019s dealt with him.\u201d     11.22am   Another fifty to Harry Brook!  41st over: England 165-5 (Brook 50, Stokes 4) Brook, facing Zahid, gets a nice friendly ball on leg stump and works it into a gap for two to reach fifty. It\u2019s his third one in this series, same as Duckett, and it\u2019s been an innings of two halves \u2013 scratchy as he made his way to four off 26 balls, then suddenly commanding as he added 46 off the next 47. And that\u2019s drinks, with England leading by 244 but not having it all their own way. Pakistan need to take five wickets fast. The only problem is that they seem to have just two weapons in their armoury \u2013 Abrar and run-outs.  Updated at 11.22am GMT    11.17am    40th over: England 160-5 (Brook 47, Stokes 2) Abrar gives Brook a single so he can attack Stokes. A push, a leave, another push \u2026 but then Stokes loses patience and goes for the reverse sweep. He misses, Abrar appeals, Marais Erasmus shakes his head firmly. Stokes fiddles a single off the last ball by working the ball to leg with his wrists. Good contest.     11.12am    39th over: England 158-5 (Brook 46, Stokes 1) Three singles off Zahid: so far, so cool.  Updated at 11.13am GMT    11.11am    38th over: England 155-5 (Brook 44, Stokes 0) Run-outs can change the mood and Pakistan have a sniff now. England lead by 234 runs, but it will only take one more wicket to get down to the tail, and Stokes is so eager to practise what he preaches that he may well be caught in the deep for 16 off ten balls. His general approach has been a gust of fresh air but if, in this case, he could bring his white-ball persona \u2013 much calmer and cannier \u2013 he\u2019d be doing his team a favour. He starts, promisingly, with a defensive push for no run.     11.05am   Wicket! Pope run out (Nawaz) 4 (England 155-5)  Another one! And another bad run as Pope, just like Crawley earlier, sets off for a kamikaze single. Unlike Crawley, he is sent back, rightly but not very promptly, and all Nawaz at cover has to do is be alert to send him on his way.     11.03am    37th over: England 155-4 (Brook 44, Pope 4) One of the striking features of Stokes\u2019s team is that when they lose a wicket, they just carry on regardless. Zahid is allowed only one dot in this over as the batters take four singles and then a hard-run two, cut by Brook to the cover sweeper.     11.00am    36th over: England 149-4 (Brook 40, Pope 2) Here\u2019s Ollie Pope, back in his old haunt at No 6 as he was given a rest after making runs and keeping wicket. He starts positively, going deep into the crease to work the ball for two. But the story of the over is Abrar, completing his ten-wicket haul, seeing off England\u2019s best batter in this match and sparing the blushes of his captain, Babar, who had dropped Duckett a few minutes earlier.     10.56am   WICKET! Duckett b Abrar 79 (England 147-4)  A short ball keeps low, Duckett pulls and misses, and Abrar gets his ten-for! Not his best delivery, but what a performance on debut.     10.54am    35th over: England 143-3 (Duckett 75, Brook 40) Zahid beats the bat too, turning a leg-break past Brook\u2019s outside edge, but only after leaking eight runs off the first five balls of his over. England\u2019s run rate has finally made it to four. It could go a lot higher if Pakistan can\u2019t separate these two soon.     10.51am    34th over: England 135-3 (Duckett 71, Brook 36) Brook is fully himself now and shows it by whipping Abrar for six! It\u2019s the first one in this innings, and he follows it with a pull for four, miscued but still powerful. After making four off his first 26 balls, Brook has 32 off his last 31. Abrar, unabashed, beats Duckett outside off with a gorgeous googly.  Updated at 10.52am GMT    10.46am    33rd over: England 124-3 (Duckett 71, Brook 25) Zahid continues and Nasser Hussain, on commentary, gives a little lecture to younger viewers on how to play spin. \u201cDuckett\u2019s good at it because he\u2019s short. It\u2019s easy to read length when you\u2019re short. Look at Brook, he\u2019s tall, but he crouches down low against the spinner.\u201d      10.44am   Duckett dropped by Babar!  32nd over: England 120-3 (Duckett 70, Brook 22) Duckett gets a bad ball from Abrar, a long hop, and is so surprised he plays a bad shot, a half-arsed pull, straight to midwicket \u2013 where Babar Azam is so astonished by both these developments that he drops an absolute sitter. If his team didn\u2019t already feel they were doomed, they will now.     10.41am    31st over: England 119-3 (Duckett 69, Brook 22) Zahid is leaking runs again. Duckett reverse-sweeps him for two and then Brook pulls for four.  I\u2019ve been picking up some correspondence from earlier. \u201cHello again Tanya,\u201d wrote Rob Lewis after Pakistan collapsed. \u201cIt looks like Bazball has been vindicated and I have to eat humble pie... earlier I predicted Stokes had got it wrong. Oh Ye of little faith! It just proves there\u2019s no fool like an old fool and fortune favours the brave.\u201d Don\u2019t be down on yourself, Rob: Stokes makes fools of all of us at some point.     10.36am    30th over: England 110-3 (Duckett 65, Brook 17) Abrar was changing ends, and he may be regretting it. Brook, growing in confidence now, not only reads a googly but then spots a ball that is only slightly short and late-cuts it for four. That too was Root-like, in a good way.      10.32am    29th over: England 103-3 (Duckett 63, Brook 12) A change of bowling! And it\u2019s Abrar who gets a breather, though it may be just to change ends. Zahid Mahmood comes on with his orthodox leg-spin and makes a respectable start, going for three singles. But it already feels as if Pakistan are going through the motions. Slip, short leg, field placing by numbers: Babar is a Root of a captain, not a Stokes.     10.28am    28th over: England 100-3 (Duckett 61, Brook 11) A decent over from Nawaz, just two singles from it, but the only faint whiff of danger came from a possible run-out. After Abrar, that may be Pakistan\u2019s most potent weapon. \u201cThis match,\u201d says John Starbuck, \u201cmay well be done by lunch on Day Four, giving us all a chance for a rest from sport for a few hours/do the washing up/send Xmas cards (some of us still do that)/wrap presents etc.\u201d  Updated at 10.29am GMT    10.26am    Meanwhile, in Adelaide \u2026      10.25am    27th over: England 98-3 (Duckett 60, Brook 10) No change at the other end either, more understandably, as Abrar is carrying on where he left off in the first innings. After stuttering to four off 26 balls, Harry Brook finally finds his feet, giving Abrar the charge and drilling a straight drive to the rope.     10.21am    26th over: England 91-3 (Duckett 59, Brook 4) Babar Azam, a beautiful batsman and a rather bland captain, needs a bright idea here, but he just keeps Nawaz on with his harmless slow left-arm. Each batter takes a single as they digest their tea and biscuits.      10.13am    A thought from Kim Thonger. \u201cFor all its positives, Bazball, for me, has one serious downside. It has killed the notion of the brave British nightwatchman, defending his wicket to the death, turning down the quick single, resolutely ignoring the slow long hop outside leg stump, ducking bouncers, with a firm jaw and a steely eye. I feel for Jack Leach, our most magnificent practitioner of the dark art. Shall we never see his misty spectacles glinting in the low setting sun again? Spare a thought for him in this day and age when he might once have been our hero.\u201d  Ha. He\u2019s still a cult figure. And Bazball has brought us the nighthawk \u2013 a part played in the summer by Stuart Broad, who is back on the telly now in his latest role as a rather tentative young curate in The Vicar of Dibley.  Updated at 10.14am GMT    9.59am   Tea: England comfortable-ish  25th over: England 89-3 (Duckett 58, Brook 3) Duckett again faces only one delivery, getting three this time \u2013 off the glove, as Abrar deceives him and the ball pops over Mohammad Rizwan\u2019s shoulder. Brook again plays the role of Geoff Boycott, so he now has three off 22 balls. And that\u2019s tea, with Pakistan winning the session but England still on course to win the match. They lead by 168 runs and Ben Duckett is playing like the senior pro, while Abrar Ahmed continues to take almost all the wickets by himself. See you in 15 minutes: I\u2019m off to find my long-johns.  Updated at 10.19am GMT    9.55am    24th over: England 86-3 (Duckett 55, Brook 3) Duckett takes a single off Nawaz\u2019s first ball, which is just what Pakistan would like, so they can get at Brook. He keeps Nawaz out but can\u2019t buy a run, even off these gentle slow left-armers. Three off 17 so far: he may be dropped for slow scoring.      9.53am    23rd over: England 85-3 (Duckett 54, Brook 3) After tormenting one Yorkshireman with his mysteries, Abrar starts work on another. Brook fails to read the googly, shapes to cut, finds the ball following him towards leg stump, and is lucky to squirt a single off the inside edge.     9.49am    22nd over: England 82-3 (Duckett 53, Brook 1) So England are in a bit of bother, or are they? Duckett is joined by Harry Brook, the only player with more runs than him in this series. He gets off the mark, characteristically, by going down the track and pushing into the off side.     9.45am    21st over: England 81-3 (Duckett 52, Brook 1) So Abrar has his ninth wicket in the match, plus a direct-hit run-out: now that\u2019s what I\u2019d call a ten-for. The decision went upstairs to check that it was a fair catch, but Root had already walked.     9.43am   Wicket!! Root c Shafique b Abrar 21 (England 79-3)  Root sweeps \u2026 to short leg! Where Abdullah Shafique takes a wonderful catch, as he had to spot that Root hadn\u2019t timed it at all and then lunge to his left when he had been dancing to his right. That moment was all about the fielding, but Abrar fully deserved it after giving Root, a great player of spin, persistent trouble.  Updated at 9.46am GMT    9.39am   Fifty to Duckett!  20th over: England 78-2 (Duckett 50, Root 21) Duckett, facing Nawaz, clips for two to bring up the fifty partnership, then sweeps for a single to reach his second fifty of the match and his third of the series. He already has almost as many runs in these two Tests (220) as he picked up in the T20 series before the World Cup (233). Whatever the format, he looks so comfortable now in an England shirt.      9.33am    19th over: England 73-2 (Duckett 47, Root 19) Abrar troubles Root again with a ball that hurried on and kept low. The slider, to my untrained eye. Where\u2019s Shane Warne when you need him?     9.31am    18th over: England 70-2 (Duckett 46, Root 17) Root, finding himself fenced in by Nawaz, breaks free by moving across to the off stump and playing a lovely lap-sweep for four.  \u201cMissed the morning,\u201d says Thomas Whiteley, \u201cbut amazed to see England had taken all remaining wickets. Is Bazball actually more about the bowling? Taken all 10 wickets in 16 consecutive innings.\u201d Great spot.     9.26am    17th over: England 63-2 (Duckett 44, Root 12) Abrar is giving Root some bother. He uses over-spin to get extra bounce and the ball pops off Root\u2019s pad onto his glove, only to fall short of the man at short leg. That\u2019s a maiden and another moral victory for Abrar.     9.23am    Meanwhile, in Antigua \u2026   Updated at 9.24am GMT    9.22am    16th over: England 63-2 (Duckett 44, Root 12) Babar Azam recognises that it\u2019s time for spin at both ends, but turns to Mohammad Nawaz rather than Zahid. His slow left-arm looks rusty as Duckett helps himself to a drive for three and Root follows it with a dab for three more. Duckett throws in a glance for two, there are a couple of singles and that\u2019s ten off the over.      9.18am    15th over: England 53-2 (Duckett 38, Root 8) Abrar thinks he\u2019s got Duckett! A reverse-sweep, a miss, a big appeal for LBW, a review \u2026 and it was hitting the stumps, but the impact on the pad was umpire\u2019s call. Duckett celebrates his escape with a couple of conventional sweeps, picking up a two and a single.     9.13am    14th over: England 48-2 (Duckett 35, Root 6) Ali dishes up another of those freebies outside off, inviting Root to play the late cut and pick up his first four of the innings. It\u2019s a mystery why the mystery spinner has yet to be joined by the orthodox leggie, Zahid Mahmood.      9.08am    13th over: England 43-2 (Duckett 34, Root 2) Abrar continues, with a slip and a short leg, and keeps it tight, conceding two singles. This is Test cricket as we used to know it.  Updated at 9.10am GMT    9.04am   Drinks: England well ahead but wobbling  12th over: England 41-2 (Duckett 33, Root 1) Mohammad Ali replaces Faheem Ashraf as the token seamer. He begins with a rank loosener, short outside off, so Duckett helps himself from the buffet. And that\u2019s drinks, with England both lording it (they lead by 120) and flirting with a collapse. And they\u2019re only going at three and a half an over. Ben Stokes may be having a word.  Updated at 9.05am GMT    8.58am    11th over: England 37-2 (Duckett 29, Root 1) Root, facing Abrar, gets off the mark with a push to mid-off. The batters meet for a conference in mid-pitch, to allow the old hand Duckett to offer some tips to the skittish Root.     8.55am    10th over: England 34-2 (Duckett 27, Root 0) Duckett, looking supremely relaxed as wickets fall at the other end, pulls Faheem for four. If you\u2019d never heard of him or Root, you\u2019d assume Duckett was the senior partner here. He has 27 off 37 balls; the rest have seven off 23 between them.     8.51am    9th over: England 29-2 (Duckett 22, Root 0) Thanks Tanya, lovely stuff as usual, and morning everyone. It\u2019s Abrar, the debutant who eats England for the meal I\u2019ve just finished. He has an appeal for LBW against Root, but it ends in smiles as there was a big inside edge. Still, a moral victory to the bowler, who, with the run-out, has been responsible for nine of England\u2019s 12 wickets in the match.  Updated at 8.51am GMT    8.47am    8th over: England 28-2 (Duckett 21, Root 0) Faheem bowls the support over well as we wait for the main act. Talking of which \u2013 here is Tim de Lisle to take you through to stumps. Thanks for getting up with me in the small hours. Bye!     8.43am    7th over: England 25-2 (Duckett 18, Root 0) A fizz around the ground, which has grown in size and spirit over lunch. Duckett sweeps cleverly and dabs Abrar behind the slips. England take six relatively easily from the over until Jacks is done like a kipper.  Updated at 8.46am GMT    8.41am   WICKET! Jacks b Abrar 4 (England  25-2)  Holy moly! Jacks tries to sock it to Abrar, drops to his knees in the sweep and is comprehensively bowled. Six balls for the wicket this time!     8.37am    6th over: England 19-1 (Duckett 15, Jacks 1) Duckett pounces on a short one and pulls it to the rope in Henry VIII style. Faheem tightens up and no more runs off the over. And the mystery spinner is about to emerge from the wings. \u201cGood morning from sunny Lisbon and a relatively warm 13c, makes a change from a couple of nights ago when a months rain fell in 3hrs rendering Lisbon more like Venice!\u201d taps a cheerful James Fielding. \u201cWell, Bazball for breakfast, Portugal v Morocco for lunch and Eng v France for dinner, what a time to be alive.\u201d     8.31am    5th over: England 15-1 (Duckett 11, Jacks 1) Thinking that Jacks might have been sent in to try and knock the confidence out of Abrar \u2013 who will presumably be called into action shortly. A better over from Ali.  Updated at 8.32am GMT    8.29am    4th over: England 11-1 (Duckett 8, Jacks 0) The batting order has a twist. Jacks is sent in at three, for the first time in first-class cricket. I don\u2019t see him pursuing this morning\u2019s Rizwan route. \u201cMorning Tanya,\u201d morning Michael Robinson.\u201dAs always, thank you for providing the OBO and allowing me to read up on the mornings play from the comfort of my bed! I was torn between reading or getting the test match on for next hour so and you\u2019ve convinced me of the cricket.\u201dI\u2019m not sure Kamila Shamsie would be impressed though\u2026 as I discard In The City By The Sea in favour of Bazball!Have a good day, enjoy the snow,\u201d A pleasure.     8.25am   WICKET! Crawley run-out Abrar 3 (England 11-1)  That man Abrar! Crawley choses to stretch single from a paper bag and Abrar running from mid-on gently under-arms the stumps down in one throw. He stretches out his arms and zooms in celebration.  Updated at 8.26am GMT    8.21am    3rd over: England 11-0 (Crawley 3, Duckett 8) Mohammad Ali sends down two consecutive balls that float like a balloon and sting like a wet tissue. Duckett dispatches them both for four.     8.19am    2nd over: England 3-0 (Crawley 3, Duckett 0) No spin yet, as Faheem Ashraf skids in. A testing maiden. Stephen Cryan briefly waves a flag for the other beautiful game: \u201dDarkness falls quickly in Qatar. The night steals in like a kidnapper, wrapping its shroud around the desert like a bag over the head. Sunsets barely last long enough to choose an Instagram filter. On Saturday evening, either England or France will also discover that in these parts, oblivion descends with a devastating brutality.\u201d \u201cWhat an opening.\u201d Jonny is a word god.      8.13am   Afternoon session: England's second innings, lead by 79 runs  1st over: England 3-0 (Crawley 3, Duckett 0) Mohammad Ali is trusted with the new ball and Crawley immediately picks up a couple of runs off a fumble. Some swing for Ali; Crawley instantly imperious. We should all get a go at being six foot five. Hello Chris Lewis! \u201cFollowing the OBO from a Horticultural Fair in Chanthaburi in Thailand. A warm and humid 32 degrees here. England\u2019s tactics vindicated. If it is a pitch teams will only last 60 overs on you have to score as many as you can before receiving the ball with your name on it.\u201d     8.03am    Play starts at 8.10 GMT. It might be worth putting it on:      8.00am    \u201cJust catching up on the goings on on a chilly morning here in Hampshire,\u201d writes Hannah Rolls.\u201dIn over 36 \u2026 was that Women\u2019s Prize winning novelist Kamila Shamsie? High class of contributions today!\u201d I\u2019ve gilded her on the OBO honours board! But seriously, she loves her cricket, here are a couple of things she\u2019s written. And she also spoke, beautifully, at the Wisden dinner in 2016     7.40am    Open the curtains to find snow is falling.     7.33am    With England buoyant, time for me to get strong coffee and wake the paper boy.     7.33am    62.5 overs: Pakistan 202 all out (Abrar 7) Very nicely done by Abrar who sticks out his bum and ushers Mark Wood over the slips for four. Squeezes a single before Ashraf holes out. 23 precious runs from the last-wicket pair but Pakistan ground to a halt after Babar\u2019s wicket, and then could never restart the train against tight England bowling. An email wheels in from Richard Whitehook. \u201cMorning Tanya... Checking in from an overcast and cooling afternoon in Malaysia - 29 degrees! Loving the last weeks worth of test cricket, and on a family note would like to wish a happy birthday to my little brother Nick Rodwell who reached 50 not out this week.\u201d Happy Birthday Nick! May it be merry and bright.     7.30am   WICKET! Ashraf c Duckett b Wood 22 (Pakistan 202 all out - trail by 79)   Wood covers his mouth in disbelief, after Ashraf plonks the ball to backward square leg and Duckett takes a comfy catch. What a balls-up by Pakistan, but excellent again from England, who spring up the Multan pavilion steps for lunch.     7.22am    61st over: Pakistan 197-9 (Ashraf 22, Abrar 2) A one-kneed swipe by Ashraf evades the clutching fingers of Ben Duckett at mid=off to go for four; and another , a big stride and a reverse-sweep to the rope. A little resistance at last.      7.19am    61st over: Pakistan 189-9 (Ashraf 14, Abrar 2) Root leaks a run, with ten minutes to go till they must come off.  \u201cMorning Tanya,\u201d Andy Bradshaw.\u201dThis is where bazball comes into its own (cue a collapse second innings to all Out for 100 off 20balls). But if you as a batsman, are expecting to only last 20 balls, whether you block or BazBall it, might as well try and get 30 off those 20 balls rather than 4      7.16am    60th over: Pakistan 188-9 (Ashraf 13, Abrar 2) The deficit falls below 100, small, rather stale, crumbs of comfort.  \u201cMorning Tanya,\u201d Karen Thorne! \u201cJust tuned in at a most exciting point!!  Broady was right yesterday when he said a few wickets for England this morning will see their total unattainable by Pakistan. He was right to ditch the clergyman\u2019s glasses too. Bet he was ribbed something rotten about those.  Anyway Leach seems to have had some kind of revival this morning!! And what a blinder Robinson is playing.\u201d     7.13am    59th over: Pakistan 183-9 (Ashraf 8, Abrar 2) Wood is pulled off after bowling one over, and taking a wicket, and Leach replaces him. Pakistan survive.     7.11am    58th over: Pakistan 182-9 (Ashraf 7, Abrar 2) Lunch in this elongated session is delayed while we wait for the final wicket to fall. Leach\u2019s second ball goes straight through Abrar but he somehow survives the rest of the over. Since Babar was out at about elevenses, Pakistan have lost seven for forty.      7.05am    57th over: Pakistan 181-9 (Ashraf 6, Abrar 2) Abrar, shirt stuffed full of a chest-pad, gets off the mark with a somewhat desparate pull.      7.03am   WICKET! Mahmood lbw Wood 0 (Pakistan 179-9, 102 behind)  Mahmood is no match for an in-swinging beauty. He reviews, just because, and Pakistan have three left, but it only delays the inevitable. Wood\u2019s first wicket of the innings.     6.59am    56th over: Pakistan 179-8 (Ashraf 6, Mahmood 0) Pakistan at last discover the reverse-sweep as Ashraf scavenges a boundary off Leach.     6.57am    55th over: Pakistan 175-8 (Ashraf 2, Mahmood 0) Pakistan gratefully accept four byes past Pope\u2019s gloves.  Updated at 6.58am GMT    6.56am    54th over: Pakistan 171-8 (Ashraf 2, Mahmood 0) Ashraf squeezes a couple of runs off Leach but the good ship Pakistan is tilting dangerous. \u201cGood morning, Tanya!\u201d Lovely to hear from you Jana Jeruma-Grinberga! \u201cFollowing fascinating OBO in a snowy landscape in Latvia, 1000\u2019s of miles and degrees of separation from Pakistan. Today\u2019s plan - a bit of IKEA flatpackery followed by a trip to the Christmas market in the Old Town and a hot Black Balsam (it\u2019s -8 outside). As a longtime, old time England cricket follower, I\u2019m loving this - the most riveting ENG team since maybe 1981.\u201d Have googled a black balsam, does it have a touch of the mulled wines about it?  Updated at 6.58am GMT    6.50am    53rd over: Pakistan 169-8 (Ashraf 0, Mahmood 0) Just the double-wicket maiden for Root!     6.49am   WICKET! Ali  b Crawley b Root 0 (Pakistan 169-8, 112 behind)  At slip, Crawley springs up from his long long legs, reaches his long, long arms and plucks the ball from the air after Ali props forward and gets an edge onto his pad. Pakistan have now lost four wickets in 19 balls for four runs.      6.46am   WICKET! Salman c Stokes b Root  4 (Pakistan 169-7, 112 behind)  Root\u2019s loosener is served up in a gravy jug and delivered straight to Ben Stokes who doesn\u2019t have to move a finger at mid-on.     6.43am    52nd over: Pakistan 169-6 (Salman 4, Ashraf 0) Pakistan crumbling against the potent combo of guile and rhythm from Leach, and reverse-swing from the big men.      6.41am   WICKET! Nawaz c Robinson b Nawaz 1 (Pakistan 169-6, 112 behind)  Nawaz jauntily dances down the pitch to hit the ball straight to mid-off.     6.38am    51st over: Pakistan 169-5 (Salman 4, Nawaz 1) Pakistan pick up a relatively princely four off Wood \u2013 who has busted a gut today for no reward. This is mind-blowing \u2013 Wasim Akram and Jack Leach      6.35am    50th over: Pakistan 161-5 ( Salman 1, Nawaz 0) So cleverly done by Leach Rizwan had just reached the boundary with a characteristically wristy loft but, just as Shakeel did, falls the next ball.  Updated at 6.36am GMT    6.32am   WICKET! Rizwan b Leach 10 (Pakistan (165 -5, trail by 116 runs)   A beauty! Rizwan is squared up by the turn, befuddled, and the ball ricochets into middle stump. The end of a peculiarly out-of-character innings     6.26am    49th over: Pakistan 161-4 (Rizwan 6, Agha Salman 1) Sweet riches, two runs off Wood. A flap into the ground from Rizwan brings one, and Salman gets off the mark after nine balls. Wood sprints in, with his whole body, and Salman just gets his bat down in time on a yorker.     6.22am    48th over: Pakistan 159-4 (Rizwan 4, Agha Salman 0) Another maiden from Leach who has pulled on his slippers and scuffed up the tobacco. Brook takes one on the bum at silly point.  Tell me your Saturday breakfast plans, oh OBO-ers. Or lunch/dinner plans if you\u2019re on a different longitude.     6.19am    47th over: Pakistan 159-4 (Rizwan 4, Agha Salman 0) Super from Wood, largely on a good length till a final ball snorter. Salman is tempted to have a flash but survives his instinctive flash.     6.14am    46th over: Pakistan 158-4 (Rizwan 4, Agha Salman 0) What a waste to bat so carefully all morning, only to lose your head for a passing fancy.      6.12am   WICKET!  Shakeel c Anderson b Leach 63 (Pakistan 158-4, 123 behind)  A hundredth Test wicket for Leach as Saud Shakeel loses his head, the ball after playing a sublime dance and hit for four. He goes for it again but mis-cues and the ball flies up between Anderson and Jacks. Anderson scrambles like a teenager late for the bus and takes the ball on the slide with both hands whilst avoiding Jacks.     6.06am    45th over: Pakistan 154-3 (Shakeel 59, Rizwan 4) This anti-Bazball proving the worth of Bazball. If Rizwan was to make a mistake and go now, he\u2019d have batted resolutely for nearly an hour but for not a single run to notch on the scorecard. A change of ends for Wood and Rizwan breaks the shackles at last! A glorious cover drive that skips with delight to the boundary. Rizwan grins.     6.01am    44th over: Pakistan 149-3 (Shakeel 58, Rizwan 0) Stokes turns to Leach, long sleeves in the morning chill. Rizwan wristily drives but only to mid-on. He prods forward again. Pope has a little word in his ear from behind the sticks, and silly point examines Rizwan\u2019s white lipstick. Another maiden.      5.57am    43rd over: Pakistan 149-3 (Shakeel 58, Rizwan 0) And another maiden as Robinson runs over and around, over and around. Ben Stokes time?     5.53am    42nd over: Pakistan 149-3 (Shakeel 58, Rizwan 0) Tick, tock, the overs pass and Pakistan play them out passively. A tutti-fruity length ball from Wood \u2013 England hesitate over the review \u2013 Pope isn\u2019t keen, Wood is \u2013 they go for it and it is close \u2013 umpire\u2019s call \u2013 but no cigar. Rizwan still becalmed.     5.47am    41 overs: Pakistan 148-3 (Shakeel 58, Rizwan 0) All sorted on the eye and refreshment front, and Robinson finishes his over with two more dots.      5.42am    40.4 overs: Pakistan 147-3 (Shakeel 57, Rizwan 0) Rizwan nearly sliced in half by a Robinson seamer and we take DRINKS while Rizwan tries to sluice something out of his eye with a bottle of water. \u201cMorning from a mild Istanbul Tanya. Today is really a tester for Bazball: with a slightly unbalanced attack for the circumstances, we could find ourselves 100 behind by the close. Then what? Go for it? If we lose this one, we\u2019ll be accused of being, what\u2019s the term? Flat track bullies?\u201d Oh Robert Lewis, that\u2019s a bit provocative for this time in the morning.      5.38am    40th over: Pakistan 147-3 (Shakeel 57, Rizwan 0) A bowling change, and we get Mark Wood for the first time this morning, hitting over 90 mph (145 kph) by mid-over. Rizwan remains resolute with his 15 ball 0, he\u2019s not going to be able to resist having a dart for much longer. \u201cGood morning Tanya.\u201d Hello Finbar Anslow! \u201cJust \u2018tuned in\u2019 in time for Babar\u2019s demise. Thanks for getting up so early for us and please spare a thought for our Milan gig today - starts at 5 pm and have just discovered they\u2019re letting us in to prepare at .... 5 pm. Sigh\u201d Milan. Went for the first time this summer. So lovely \u2013 still fantasise about those delicious tiny pastries, whose name escapes me right now, that you are served with your espresso. And good luck with the gig!  Updated at 5.39am GMT    5.32am    39th over: Pakistan 146-3 (Shakeel 56, Rizwan 0) More stats, Robinson has the lowest Test bowling average over the last five years apart from Kyle Jamieson. Pat Cummins sits in third. Robinson making the ball nip both ways. Another immaculate over with just the single for Pakistan, who have become becalmed since Babar\u2019s wicket.     5.29am    38th over: Pakistan 145-3 (Shakeel 55, Rizwan 0) A second consecutive maiden, this time from Leach as Rizwan plays it out not entirely confidently.     5.27am    37th over: Pakistan 145-3 (Shakeel 55, Rizwan 0) I catch the arse end of some stats which, I think, show that Robinson has the lowest bowling average since Frank Tyson. He\u2019s an impressive chap \u2013 has pulled himself out of the mire after that early bruising encounter with the offensive historic social media tweets. Listened and learned. There\u2019s a simplicity to what he does, and it has travelled well from Sussex to Multan. A maiden.  Updated at 5.28am GMT    5.20am    36th over: Pakistan 145-3 (Shakeel 55, Rizwan 0) Leach pulls off his cap and puts it on again, wheeling through six balls so quickly in between that one blurs into another. Five dots till Shakeel cuts the sixth, cut off from the boundary by a chasing Mark Wood. Good morning Kamilia Shamsie, who has news about the empty stands: \u201cPakistan is not a nation for early starts under the best of circs. And if anyone was watching Argentina v Netherlands last night they won\u2019t have gone to sleep until after 3 am. The sports fan\u2019s life can be so exhausting. (Still sipping on my first cup of tea here at 10.06 am in Karachi)\"\u201c Love the on the ground updates, thank you!  Updated at 5.28am GMT    5.15am    35th over: Pakistan 142-3 (Shakeel 52, Rizwan 0) Reverse-swing straight away for Robinson, and Rizwan nearly perishes in the same over, driving to a similar ball. An immaculate wicket maiden and Pakistan lose their main batter still 132 runs behind.  Updated at 5.27am GMT    5.13am   WICKET! Babar Azam b Robinson 75 (Pakistan 142-3 - 139 runs behind)  Going for the drive, misses and hears the death rattle. An in-swinging beauty from Robinson at a perfect length with his second ball of the match.     5.11am   Fifty for Shakeel!  34th over: Pakistan 142-2 (Shakeel 52, Babar 75) Nine off Leach\u2019s over, as Shakeel reaches his second Test fifty with a smartly-executed sweep.  Updated at 5.27am GMT    5.06am    33rd over: Pakistan 133-2 (Shakeel 47, Babar 71) Anderson\u2019s over starts with a mix-up between Shakeel and Babar, Babar sends Shakeel back and, if Crawley had hit the stumps from square leg, Shakeel would have been on his way But he didn\u2019t, slipping as he threw, and Shakeel remains to drive Anderson through extra-cover most beautifully.  Updated at 5.27am GMT    5.02am    32nd over: Pakistan 129-2 (Shakeel 43, Babar 71) Leach leaks a couple of fours, a sweep from Shakeel and a glorious wristy dispatch from Babar, but finishes the over passing Babar\u2019s bat, and bamboozling as he props forward.  Updated at 5.27am GMT    4.59am    31st over: Pakistan 118-2 (Shakeel 38, Babar 65) An a la mode back foot punch brings four from Shakeel.     4.53am    30th over: Pakistan 112-2 (Shakeel 33, Babar 64) The stands are not full, in fact they\u2019re verging on lonely. Perhaps the punters were as surprised as everyone else by the early start. Leach wheels through an over with a dash of turn but no real fizz. I\u2019m going to have to make a trolly dash to the kitchen for a cup of tea. Bowl slowly Jimmy.     4.50am    29th over: Pakistan 107-2(Shakeel 32 Babar 63) There\u2019s a haze to the Multan air but Jimmy Anderson has the ball regardless. Oh my tired eyes. Jimmy is straight to work, sewing an immaculate line across an immaculate coat. Babar pushes a couple through the covers on a dewy outfield.      4.44am    Disappointed to report, that in the studio, Stuart Broad\u2019s curate glasses have gone. He is in a brown jacket and trouser combo, Mark Butcher immaculate in navy. Oh ignore me, the players are walking on so play will start pretty much now.      4.40am    Good morning! It\u2019s cold outside but baby, it\u2019s bubbling at Multan. Can Pakistan haul their way back into the series today after an enthralling first day? Abrar\u2019s debut performance (7-114) was one for the ages, and Babar looked in ominous form as the night drew in. Play starts 5am GMT, don\u2019t miss a ball!  Updated at 4.50am GMT "

                    "body": "  9.39am   What we learned, Tuesday 14 June  We are going to put this little blog to bed now. Thanks, as ever, for your comments, correspondence and company. I hope the lights are staying on where you are. Be well, all of you. A brief summary of today\u2019s developments:  The Australian Energy Market Operator has again warned of the threat of widespread blackouts caused by power shortages. Five states face supply gaps in coming days. Western Australia will shut its last coal-fired power plant by the end of the decade Foreign minister Penny Wong will visit her NZ counterpart. Former Wallabies captain David Pocock has become the first independent candidate to win a territory senate seat, elected to parliament as a senator for the ACT. Australian stocks plunged, following a global sell-off of stocks on fears of worsening inflation, and ... The Australian Socceroos will play in a fifth straight World Cup Finals, thanks, in the significant part, to the rubber-limbed genius of goalkeeper Andrew Redmayne.   Updated at 9.46am BST    9.31am    Curiouser and curiouser...       9.25am    Conservation officials in New Zealand believe mass die-offs of sea birds are becoming more frequent as climate crisis disrupts food chains. Here\u2019s the full report:   Updated at 9.28am BST    9.12am    Western Australia will shut its last coal-fired power unit before the end of the decade and spend an extra half a billion dollars to foster new jobs for displayed workers, the state government said. Later this year, the first of the 854-megawatt Muja power station\u2019s units near Collie, south of Perth, will close, with the entire plant to be shut by 2029. The nearby 340MW Collie plant will exit the market by the end of 2027, the premier, Mark McGowan, said in a statement on Tuesday.      9.01am    Georgina Kekea reports from Honiara: The controversial security deal struck between Solomon Islands and China that caught the western world off guard was needed to maintain internal security and help fight climate change, a leading Solomon Islands official has said, defending his country\u2019s right to choose its allies.      8.52am         8.38am    Lovely read from Emma Kemp on Andrew \u2018the Grey Wiggle\u2019 Redmayne...  The Socceroos goalkeeper\u2019s penalty shootout save made headlines, but his journey to Qatar has not been straightforward.   Updated at 8.42am BST    8.21am    Penny Wong headed to New Zealand on fifth international trip since taking office The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, is about to embark on her fifth international trip since taking office last month. Her New Zealand counterpart, Nanaia Mahuta, announced that she would welcome Wong for an in-person meeting this Thursday, saying \u201cdeep cooperation and partnerships\u201d would stand both countries in good stead.  In a statement reported by New Zealand media, Mahuta said the formal bilateral talks with Wong would provide \u201can opportunity for new conversations on ways to advance our partnership\u201d. Mahuta said climate change was the \u201cnumber one security issue\u201d for the Pacific:  I look forward to talking to the new foreign minister in more detail on Australia\u2019s climate change agenda, and further ways we can assist Pacific Island nations on mitigation and adaptation measures. On broader Pacific challenges, Aotearoa New Zealand seeks to elevate the Pacific Island voice, and support collaboration and partnership through established institutions, especially the Pacific Islands Forum.  As Katharine Murphy observed in this dispatch from Indonesia last week, Wong has hit the ground running. The day she was sworn in as foreign affairs minister, Wong flew with the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, to Tokyo for the long-scheduled Quad leaders\u2019 summit. Her second trip, later in that same week, was to Fiji, where she made Australia\u2019s case to be the region\u2019s parter of choice amid growing competition with China for influence. Wong\u2019s third trip was to both Samoa and Tonga.  In her fourth trip, Wong travelled with Albanese to Indonesia last week. Wong\u2019s forthcoming trip to New Zealand follows Albanese\u2019s meetings with Jacinda Ardern in Sydney on Thursday and Friday. The new prime minister has promised to consider changing the way the section 501 visa cancellation policy is applied to address New Zealand\u2019s concerns.  Updated at 8.24am BST    8.11am     Daniel Hurst\u2019s file is here:      8.00am    NSW to set up fund for environmental offset credits, in part to compensate for state renewable energy projects A new $106.7m NSW government fund dedicated to buying and selling biodiversity credits in the state\u2019s environmental offset market will be used to help the Perrottet government compensate for habitat clearing for its renewable energy zones. The NSW treasurer, Matt Kean, and the environment minister, James Griffin, announced the forthcoming state budget would include an investment to establish a biodiversity credits supply fund within the NSW planning and environment department. Currently, developers looking to offset the environmental impacts of projects can purchase offset credits from private landholders who protect their properties for conservation under an agreement with the state government. The new fund will see the state government purchase credits and sell them on to developers.  The government says the fund will serve several purposes, including ensuring that there is an \u201cefficient and trusted\u201d source of credits and that there is a supply of credits available to offset projects when they are needed. Griffin said it was also intended to meet the offset requirements for large infrastructure projects the state government has in the pipeline, including its five planned renewable energy zones. He said the fund would create a significant increase in the supply of available credits that could be used for projects that were important to the community. Griffin said:  This means the NSW government will be securing more habitat for threatened species and ecosystems sooner, effectively bringing forward environmental benefits.   Updated at 8.12am BST    7.48am    ASX200 ends trading down 3.6%, the biggest single-day drop in two years Meanwhile in those other, bigger markets, such as the ASX, it\u2019s been a grim day. The ASX200 benchmark of (you guessed it) 200 top companies on the stock market lost 3.6%, which apparently is the biggest single-day drop in just over two years.  It could have been worse, though, after the market opened a tad more than 5.2% lower. Asian markets were down too, but more in the 1-2% range. That\u2019s partly because they were trading on Monday \u2013 while Australia was mostly on holiday \u2013 and took a chunk of their losses then. The big Australian banks all had another sour day. Despite some investors saying banks don\u2019t mind higher interest rates, if they rise too fast, there\u2019s more chance of bad debts and, of course, slower overall economic growth.  It wasn\u2019t much more than a week ago that CBA, Australia\u2019s biggest bank, was worth $105 a share. Today it closed at $91.20, denting the values of many a superfund that holds it.  Updated at 8.15am BST    7.44am    Federal MPs and public officer holders to receive 2.75% pay rise  Federal MPs and public office holders have been granted a 2.75% pay increase from 1 July, with a backbencher set to receive a base salary of $217,060. The remuneration tribunal, which independently sets the pay of statutory officers and other public officials, ordered the 2.75% pay increase. It\u2019s an improvement on last year \u2013 when no increase was ordered \u2013 but still a distance short of inflation, which was already 5.1% in headline terms or 3.7% in underlying terms at the time of the last budget. It has only increased since then, and that means pollies (like many others) have suffered a real pay cut. In its decision on MPs\u2019 pay, the tribunal said:  While the work performed by the wide variety of offices in the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, including members of parliament, is diverse and unique, the tribunal is conscious of ensuring that relativities within the group of offices for which it determines remuneration remain consistent. Consistent with previous decisions the tribunal maintains the view that the pay of parliamentarians should increase relative to that of other public office holders, and thus the decision to determine an adjustment for the office holders in the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction generally will also apply to parliamentarians.  For the approximately 2.7 million Australians whose pay is set by the national minimum wage (currently $20.33 an hour) or related award minimums, the Fair Work Commission will announce its decision at 10am on Wednesday.  Updated at 7.54am BST    7.28am    This is pretty opaque if you\u2019re not part of the energy cognoscenti, but Peter Hannam (who most assuredly is), tells me this is a \u201cwarning shot\u201d ...   Updated at 7.29am BST    7.16am    Big energy users in Queensland and NSW to cut down use as Aemo warns of energy supply gaps The Australian Energy Market Operator has several tricks up its regulatory sleeves when it comes to ensuring we don\u2019t get blackouts in a tight market. One is the daintily named Reliability and Emergency Reserve Trader (or Rert, NOT Rort), which is a pre-arranged list of big energy users that agree to reduce load in a power pinch \u2013 and collect some payment for helping out. Yesterday, the Rert was activated for Queensland and it\u2019s been done again, for most of the rest of today. Interestingly, the same request is being made in NSW for about the same period.  We learned yesterday that Rio Tinto\u2019s Boyne Smelter was not part of the scheme, but we have to assume other big power users will be. Some, of course, can\u2019t turn off the power for too long \u2013 such as aluminium* smelters, as their potlines turn solid after a couple of hours and are then useless. (*Not to be confused with aluminum, which is the Yanks\u2019 accidental typo, when Alcoa lodged its company name and left out the \u2018i\u2019 by mistake.)  Updated at 7.24am BST    7.09am         7.05am    That is a cracking headline ...   Updated at 7.10am BST    6.49am   Energy ministers trade barbs as WA announces state-owned coal power plants to shut  There\u2019s a national cabinet planned for Friday, and you can be certain that energy will feature highly, for reasons that may be more acute by week\u2019s end. Aside from blaming the Abbott/Turnbull/Morrison government, the Albanese government will need to come up with more of the \u201cway forward\u201d. Part of that may be the Transition Plan, or even gas storage options floated by the energy minister, Chris Bowen, after energy ministers had their first post-election gathering last week. (It wasn\u2019t the \u201cemergency\u201d meeting as some described.) To make up for the lack of federal Labor v Coalition stoush at the cabinet meeting, the various states might bring a bit of their own banter to the table. On Tuesday, NSW energy minister, Matt Kean, seemed to be laying at least some of the blame for the current electricity squeeze on the neighbours to the north. \u201cObviously, there\u2019s been some big challenges in Queensland,\u201d Kean told reporters including Guardian Australia\u2019s own Tamsin Rose. \u201cThey\u2019ve had an unusually cold winter and a number of the big generators have gone out of the system. That\u2019s putting increasing pressure on the NSW generators.\u201d  Not surprisingly, his Queensland counterpart, Mick de Brenni, was not overly impressed. \u201cQueensland has been doing the heavy lifting for the entire east coast, whether it\u2019s on supplying gas to NSW and Victoria, to opening up more gas fields for exploration,\u201d de Brenni told journalists. (After that riposte, de Brenni wanted to \u201creassure all Queenslanders that the system is operating ... We don\u2019t expect there to be widespread outages.\u201d) Meanwhile, Victoria\u2019s power pinch is forecast for tomorrow evening at this stage.  In news to darken the soul of Queensland senator and wannabe coalminer Matt Canavan, Western Australia has joined the rush to dump the fossil fuel from its electricity sector.According to the ABC, the McGowan Labor government will exit coal in its grid before 2030 and pour billions of dollars into renewable energy. In a \u201clandmark announcement\u201d this afternoon, the premier, Mark McGowan, and energy minister, Bill Johnston, said state-owned power provider Synergy would shut its remaining coal-fired plants by 2029. Synergy currently owns and runs two coal-fired power stations, the 854Mw Muja plant and the 340Mw Collie plant, both near Collie some 200km south of Perth, ABC said.Something else to chew over at the national cabinet gathering this week.  Updated at 7.33am BST    6.39am    Tasmanian Greens leader tables petition calling on government to end subsidies for greyhound racing The Greens leader in Tasmania, Cassy O\u2019Connor, has tabled a petition in that state\u2019s parliament calling for an end to government subsidies for the greyhound industry.  It was a great honour to table a record-breaking petition condemning the brutal greyhound racing industry in parliament today. This is an industry that wouldn\u2019t survive without tens of millions in taxpayer money.  More than 13,500 Tasmanians signed the e-petition to end the subsidies to greyhound racing \u2013 making it the biggest e-petition in Tasmanian parliamentary history. The public know this industry has cruelty at its core and want no part in paying for it. The momentum to end the cruelty of greyhound racing is gathering as the industry continues to lose its social license. Tasmanians have spoken, and the Rockliff government is on notice. This industry, that breeds dogs to die or cast aside when they don\u2019t run fast enough, has had its time.  The Coalition for the Protection of Greyhounds \u2013 which is backing the petition \u2013 has detailed 64 deaths of greyhounds on Australian racing tracks this year, and 4573 injuries. There were 213 greyhound deaths from racing in 2021.

(Note SA is still paying users to take its power.)  The market, though, remains tight, with a total of five \u201clack of reserve \u2013 level 3\u201d notices issued for NSW for later today and into Wednesday. Each has a possible shortfall of supply.  Tasmania, meanwhile, has joined its mainland counterparts in facing a supply gap within the next day or so.  It\u2019s the only one of the five states without a price cap imposed by Aemo (though at the $15,100/megawatt-hour maximum rate it was charging for its power earlier today, it might not be long before it joins the others with a forced $300/Mwh limit).  Another long evening ahead for regulators (and bloggers).  Updated at 7.19am BST    5.41am    Far-right extremism less closely monitored amid focus on Islamist extremism, Victorian inquiry hears From Callum Godde in Melbourne for AAP: A \u201cmyopic\u201d focus on Islamist extremism in Australia since 2001\u2019s September 11 attacks in the United States has come at the expense of monitoring the far-right movement, a Victorian parliamentary inquiry has been told. Liberty Victoria president, Michael Stanton, has acknowledged the recent emergence of far-right extremism in the state, citing neo-Nazis gathering in the Grampians and gallows erected outside state parliament as pandemic legislation was debated last year. He told an inquiry on Tuesday that far-right extremism is real, but argued Victorian politicians need to be careful not to blindly expand executive powers, surveillance and censorship to combat its influence. \u201cWe need to make sure that in responding to those confronting scenes in the Grampians \u2013 whether it be Nazi salutes or display of the swastika \u2013 or the erection of gallows outside parliament, that we do not have a legislative response that throws the baby out with the bathwater,\u201d Stanton said. \u201cSometimes that involves tolerating speech that we find offensive or humiliating.\u201d The barrister said Australian law enforcement agencies\u2019 focus has been drawn away from neo-Nazis and other far-right movements over the past 20 years by Islamist extremism. Both must be addressed, Stanton said, but Victoria\u2019s parliament should not cast the net too wide with any reforms. \u201cThe focus should be on those people who are directly likely to be engaged in committing violent acts,\u201d he said. \u201cTo cast their net more broadly risks increasing stigmatisation \u2013 the kind of stigmatisation faced by the Muslim community, or parts of the Muslim community, in Australia for almost two decades \u2013 and risks being counterproductive.\u201d As well as investigating the rise of far-right extremism in Victoria, the inquiry is studying how the Covid-19 pandemic has affected its apparent growth.   Updated at 5.51am BST    5.24am         5.17am   Key event  Col Blanch to be appointed WA police commissioner Current deputy police commissioner in the Western Australian police force, Col Blanch, will become the force\u2019s new commissioner next month. Blanch, who has overseen key portfolios including gang crime, homicide, organised crime, and state intelligence, has been appointed for a five-year term. Blanch became, briefly, a household name last year as the public face of the WA police force\u2019s search for missing girl Cleo Smith, who was found, safe and well, 18 days after she vanished from a remote camping site.  \u201cWe have all had tears in our eyes this morning,\u201d he said of the early morning rescue of the girl. Blanch is also a former executive director of intelligence for the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission, and chair of the WA State Emergency Coordination Group.  WA premier, Mark McGowan, said Blanch was an outstanding candidate. \u201cCol Blanch has proven himself a leader of integrity who cares deeply about safety of the community and those serving under his command,\u201d McGowan said. \u201cMr Blanch has been directly involved in shepherding the state through the pandemic and he is well-placed to lead the Western Australian Police Force as it confronts challenges of the post-pandemic world.\u201d  Updated at 5.21am BST    5.10am    And now Victoria ...   Updated at 5.13am BST    4.56am    Experts urge \u2018careful consideration\u2019 in designing Australian centre for disease control after Labor\u2019s election promise Before its election win, Labor had promised to set up an Australian Centre for Disease Control to help prepare for, and cope with, future pandemics and outbreaks. Experts are now urging the government to carefully consider the body\u2019s design prior to its establishment, warning there is a risk that the establishment of an Australian CDC may be \u201cseen as a \u2018quick win\u2019\u201d by the new government. Three experts from the Sydney Institute for Infectious Diseases at the University of Sydney, Prof Ben Marais, Prof Tania Sorrell and Prof Lyn Gilbert, say the Covid pandemic showed such a body was sorely needed to coordinate the national response, collate critical data, and conduct rapid research.  In a statement published Tuesday, they said:   Careful consideration and consultation are needed to establish this organisation as one that society can look to as a leader in preventing, preparing for and responding to disease outbreaks. It needs to be an entity that can bring together the collective expertise of researchers, epidemiologists, public health microbiologists and practitioners, communications, infection prevention and control experts, and policy makers.  The three experts said questions remained about whether an Australian CDC should examine both infectious and non-communicable diseases, how it would be structured to avoid bias or perceptions of bias, and how it could create a national disease surveillance network across various jurisdictions.   Updated at 5.04am BST    4.49am   National Covid-19 update  Here are the latest coronavirus case numbers from around Australia on Tuesday, as the country records at least 31 deaths from Covid-19: ACT  Deaths: 0 Cases: 633 In hospital: 93 (with 3 people in ICU)  NSW  Deaths: 3 Cases: 5,157 In hospital: 1,341 (with 39 people in ICU)  Northern Territory  Deaths: 0 Cases: 169 In hospital: 22 (with 2 people in ICU)  Queensland  Deaths: 6 Cases: 4,190 In hospital: 373 (with 8 people in ICU)  South Australia  Deaths: 0 Cases: 2,429 In hospital: 226 (with 8 people in ICU)  Tasmania  Deaths: 1 Cases: 658 In hospital: 45 (with 2 people in ICU)  Victoria  Deaths: 15 Cases: 6,071 In hospital: 473 (with 28 people in ICU)  Western Australia  Deaths: 6 Cases: 6,315 In hospital: 278 (with 12 people in ICU)      4.38am    David Pocock thanks \u2018a community I love\u2019 after being elected to Senate for ACT Climate change activist, independent candidate and former Wallabies captain David Pocock has been elected to the Senate as one of two upper house seats for the Australian Capital Territory. He is the first independent candidate to win election as a territory senator. (The other ACT senator is the finance minister, Katy Gallagher, who was returned.) Pocock received 21.18% of the primary vote. With preferences he achieved quota at the distribution of preferences on Tuesday. Pocock thanked the ACT community for its support. \u201cToday, the extraordinary movement of people we brought together across the ACT made history,\u201d Pocock said. \u201cFor the first time, we have an independent voice representing our community in the federal parliament.  \u201cThank you to everyone who put their trust in me to represent you. It is an incredible honour to be able to serve a community I love.\u201d Pocock congratulated Gallagher on her re-election, and acknowledged the work of outgoing Liberal senator Zed Seselja, who had held the second ACT senate seat for nine years but lost out to Pocock in the final counting in this election.  Pocock said his campaign \u201caimed to make politics about people\u201d. \u201cWe built a policy platform off the back of thousands of conversations about the things that matter.  \u201cWe kept it positive. We talked about the issues and the ideas for the future we want and It clearly resonated.\u201d The AEC will officially declare the result tomorrow in Canberra.   Updated at 4.44am BST    4.34am    I told you he was inexhaustible ... (unlike east coast power supplies, it seems):   Updated at 4.37am BST    4.27am   Queensland at risk of power outages as Aemo forecasts evening energy shortfall  Afternoon fellow travellers. Thanks to the indefatigable Mostafa for his stellar first innings. Speaking of inexhaustible: the latest dispatch (see what I did there ...) from our energetic energy correspondent Peter Hannam: ... So we have an updated view from the Australian energy market operator of the forecast electricity supply gap for Queensland. It\u2019s 1,789 megawatts (which looks revolutionary) at 6.30pm AEST this evening, and larger than the biggest projected shortfall yesterday at 1,454Mw. No wonder Aemo is looking for a response from generators.  At this size, you\u2019d expect the Queensland government to again ask consumers to turn off unnecessary appliances, and big power users will probably be asked to do so too (and for some, they will be paid to do so). There are other \u201clack of reserve\u201d notices for other states including NSW at level 1 or 2, which are not as serious. Some reputable commentators smell a rat, though, as there is ample capacity in the market even taking into account the increasingly unreliable coal-fired power plants in the national electricity market.  The Australian Energy Regulator, which is supposed to keep an eye on price gouging, says it is \u201cmonitoring the market closely\u201d, as is the competition watchdog, the ACCC.  Whether anyone will get pinged for anti-competitive behaviour remains to be seen.  Updated at 5.16am BST    4.03am    And with that, I will leave the blog in the trusty hands of Ben Doherty. Thanks for reading.      4.00am    Albanese suggests bosses go easy on Socceroos fans today  Earlier, prime minister Anthony Albanese was asked what is arguably the most important question of the day: will he give the nation a day off to celebrate the Socceroos? Unfortunately, the PM could only offer some encouragement for bosses to go easy on employees today (booooooo):    If someone\u2019s having a little kip in the corner, it\u2019s understandable, because if they\u2019ve been up since 4 o\u2019clock watching \u2026 and then celebrating afterwards, it\u2019s understandable that coffee can only go so far.     Updated at 4.07am BST    3.45am   NSW Liberal candidate calls for recount of Gilmore  The AEC is due to officially declare results in numerous House of Representatives seats today, but the result in the NSW seat of Gilmore has been delayed after Liberal candidate Andrew Constance called for a recount. The former NSW state minister ended up just 373 votes behind Labor MP Fiona Phillips, according to the AEC\u2019s official numbers, and the seat was to be declared officially at 2pm today.  But the AEC says that has been delayed after a formal request for a recount, which the electoral body says it will give \u201cthorough consideration\u201d. Constance told Guardian Australia that his vote scrutineers had \u201craised concerns in relation to certain aspects of the process, particularly the scrutiny of informal votes\u201d. Constance said he believed the close result meant there were \u201cstrong grounds for a recount\u201d. The AEC said its staff need time to assess the request, stressing that the delay of the declaration was not any indication of what decision it would make.  A spokesman noted the AEC\u2019s validation processes for counting votes, including that ballots are counted more than once in a process called \u201cfresh scrutiny\u201d.   Updated at 4.00am BST    3.34am    Albanese says \u2018all things are on the table\u2019 for energy policy review Earlier, Anthony Albanese was asked about the fact the energy minister, Chris Bowen, did not rule out price controls on gas in a morning interview. Albanese said:  He didn\u2019t speak about that at all, I\u2019ve read the transcript, he was asked about that. It\u2019s a different thing. With what Mr Bowen said in the interview ... is that all things are on the table. We\u2019ve said we will have a review of the so-called trigger, which is in place. The so-called trigger isn\u2019t really a trigger at all because you pull the trigger and nothing happens until January 1. So what we will do and are doing as a matter of urgency is a review and all things are on the table.  Albanese also sounded off about the failures of the Morrison government on energy. He said:  It\u2019s not acceptable that we have had a government previously, which was in office for three terms, announced 22 different energy policies and didn\u2019t land one \u2013 that is not acceptable. You\u2019ve had a decade of neglect ... you\u2019ve had a decade where we have an energy grid that isn\u2019t fit for purpose for the 21st century. You\u2019ve had too many arguments taking place rather than the investment certainty which comes from having an energy policy ... And what we find is the consequences of the former government\u2019s failure to put in place an energy policy is being felt right now, with problems in the market.

Updated at 3.43am BST    3.24am   Albanese says China must remove trade sanctions to improve relationship  Anthony Albanese has been asked about China\u2019s sanctions, after defence minister Richard Marles met his Chinese counterpart, ending several years of Australia being frozen out by Chinese ministers. Albanese said:  Well it\u2019s China that has imposed sanctions on Australia, they need to remove those sanctions in order to improve relations between Australia and China. It\u2019s a good thing that Richard Marles [was able to meet] with his counterpart on the sides of the conference in Singapore. We do need to engage with each other and that\u2019s a positive step. But it\u2019s China that has imposed sanctions, it\u2019s China that has changed and it\u2019s China that needs to remove those sanctions. China needs to remove the sanctions they have put in place, there is no reason for them to be there. We are a trading nation, we have fulfilled all of our obligations as part of contracts and arrangements put in place, and we make good products as well. And those sanctions hurt Australia but they also hurt China, because of the quality of our products.  Albanese said dialogue had been \u201cmissing\u201d in the last few years, but there need to be \u201cconcrete steps\u201d from China. My colleague Daniel Hurst has reported similar demands from foreign minister, Penny Wong, to end trade sanctions. Albanese also confirmed he has written back to China after premier, Li Keqiang, sent him a \u201ccongratulatory message\u201d, but would not comment beyond saying he \u201cresponded appropriately\u201d. \u201cThere have been prime ministers who reveal text messages and correspondence - I\u2019m not one of them,\u201d he said.   Updated at 3.59am BST    3.17am    Albanese questioned on reducing deportations of New Zealanders convicted of crimes The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is holding a press conference in Brisbane with the aged care minister Anika Wells. Albanese was asked about his talks with New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, about reducing deportations of New Zealanders convicted of crimes in Australia. He said:  I\u2019ve said that section 501 will stay in place. What we\u2019ll have discussions over though is how that framework operates in a sensible way, in the context as well [that] New Zealand has agreed, of course, to take some people who are currently on Nauru, and we\u2019ll have those discussions in the context as well and of how we smooth out the path to citizenship for people from New Zealand, which is a substantial number right here in Australia.  Fascinating that he made a link between reducing deportations and New Zealand agreeing to take asylum seekers and refugees from offshore detention.

Updated at 3.14am BST    3.05am    Business confidence retreats as Australian stocks plunge Australian stocks seem to have plateaued for now, down just a tad less than 5%, pretty much how far they plunged at the open. There are more details here on that fall, which wiped off more than $110bn in share value:  Eventually the effects of financial markets do affect the \u201creal economy\u201d but the daily gyrations can sometimes be misleading (and are bad for blood pressure, and so on).  So what\u2019s the real world look like? NAB\u2019s monthly survey of business confidence and conditions finds some retreat but forward orders are keeping both relatively buoyant.  Overall conditions remain \u201cwell above average\u201dat +16 points, NAB says. That sentiment is patchy, though, with confidence dipping in South Australia and Victoria, but improving in Queensland. Some industries, though, such as construction are not doing very well, profit-wise, even if their order books are generally full. \u201cNo other industry is facing such margin pressure,\u201d NAB said.  The signs are mixed too for inflation. On the one hand, labour costs were up 2.5% in May, easing from the record 3.0% rise in April, while the cost of finished goods rose 1.8% and retail price growth came in at 3.1% on a quarterly basis, NAB said. By that score, real wages are looking like they might still be going backwards.

Updated at 3.10am BST    2.49am    Public hearings begin into far-right extremism in Victoria A Victorian parliamentary inquiry investigating the rising threat of far-right extremism has begun holding public hearings today. Liberty Victoria president, Michael Stanton, tells the inquiry it is vital a legislative response does not \u201cthrow the baby out with the bath water\u201d to ensure free speech is balanced with people\u2019s right to live without discrimination and violence:   Sometimes that involves tolerating things that we find offensive or humiliating, and I\u2019m reminded of John Howard, who famously of course introduced gun control but also strongly opposed flag burning becoming a criminal offence, despite pressure from his own backbench.  The inquiry, announced in February after a push from the Greens, comes amid a recent emergence of extremist and neo-Nazi groups into public view.  Last month, Victoria introduced landmark legislation that would see the state become the first jurisdictions in Australia to ban the Nazi swastika.   Updated at 3.08am BST    2.34am    Aemo says it might need to intervene in SA amid energy shortage but solar helping Eastern Australia\u2019s energy market continues to be busy, with the Australian Energy Market Operator signalling it may have to intervene in South Australia if more supply isn\u2019t forthcoming. At the moment, wind and solar are supplying almost 90% of that\u2019s state\u2019s needs, and SA is busily exporting to Victoria (SA\u2019s spot wholesale price is negative-$1 per megawatt hour, compared with $200-$300 in other parts of the national electricity market). So the intervention will likely be for system security with more \u201csynchronous generating units\u201d needed.  Meanwhile, there have been a couple of actual lack of reserve notices in NSW and Queensland where the available extra capacity has been lower than desired but without supply gaps looming. The sunny days across most of eastern Australia (long may they last after the rains) mean there\u2019s a decent amount of solar energy being generated even though we\u2019re in winter. At the moment, about a quarter of supplies are coming from solar farms and rooftops.  Short of some surprises, then, the main focus of regulators (and nervous energy ministers) will be what happens as the sun sets. Blackouts, though, remain unlikely but can\u2019t be ruled out.  Updated at 2.56am BST    2.29am   New Zealand school in lockdown after reports of active shooter  Police in the the town of Taupiri on New Zealand\u2019s north island are responding to reports of an active shooter. AAP reports that a person was injured about 9.30am while a nearby school was in lockdown as a precaution.  Police were responding to a \u201cserious incident\u201d in Taupiri, south of Auckland, on Tuesday morning.  Local media are reporting that an active shooter was in the Taupiri area. A large number of police remain at the scene.   Updated at 3.00am BST    2.27am   Energy regulator warns of possible blackouts in NSW and Queensland  Earlier today, Australia\u2019s energy regulator, the Australian Electricity Market Operator (Aemo), warned that blackouts could still be possible in NSW and Queensland, between 5pm and 9pm tonight.  Aemo said in a statement that it has issued notices to encourage more power generation, and that if those measures aren\u2019t sufficient some areas may face blackouts.  The market operators also said price caps were in place in Queensland, NSW, Victoria and South Australia because wholesale prices have breached a threshold.    As a consequence, some generators revised their market availability in New South Wales and Queensland for today. This has contributed to forecast supply shortfalls, along with generation units being offline for planned maintenance and repairs. Supply reserve shortfalls (lack of reserve 2 and 3) are currently forecast in Queensland and New South Wales this evening (approximately 5pm to 9pm).   Updated at 2.55am BST    2.13am    AustralianSuper cuts weekly admin fee but raises annual fee for contributors The nation\u2019s biggest superannuation fund has cut administration fees that it charges most members \u2013 but some will see their fees rise. AustralianSuper, which manages about $261bn of retirement savings on behalf of 2.7 million members, will cut its weekly account-keeping fee from $2.25 to $1.  However, it is also increasing the annual fee it charges people who are still contributing to their super, which is based on the size of your retirement account, from 0.04% to 0.1%. Total fees for people accumulating savings will be capped at $350 a year. For people who are retired and drawing down on their fund, the variable fee will go down from the current 0.11% to 0.1%, and the total fee will be capped at $600 a year \u2013 down from the current cap of $750 a year. Aussie says that the result will benefit people with less in their super \u2013 those with a balance below $50,000 will pay almost 60% less in administration fees. The average fee decrease for people who are retired and drawing down on their super will be 25%, the fund says.  In all, about 2.3 million members will either enjoy a decrease or see fees remain the same; it\u2019s estimated about 300,000 to 400,000 members with larger balances will see fees increase. The fund says insurance costs for about 1.13 million members will decrease this year. It has also spent considerable effort bringing investment managers in-house, rather than employing expensive external advisors \u2013 something it says has saved members $1bn over eight years and slashed investment fees for members in its main balanced option from a high of 0.84% in 2009 to 0.63% last year.

Perrottet says the cash injection will \u201cdrive women\u2019s participation, provide great opportunities for families who are struggling with bouncing their work and family life struggle\u201d.    This is a once-in-a-generation reform. We know this is an area that has been put in the too hard basket for way too long.  This investment today will increase places right across our state, over time and over the next decade ensure prices also come down \u2013 a saving of around $4,000 for those families with one child and close to $8,000 for those families who use child care and have two children.  It is nation-leading reform that we would expect other states to follow suit. This is something from a commonwealth level hasn\u2019t had the traction that it needs. It has put many women in a position where they are not able to make that choice, they are not able to stay in the work place and this is something that will drive economic activity of around $17bn a year.

Updated at 2.09am BST    1.28am   ASX plunges on open  The big falls on overseas financial markets have been echoed in Australia, where the stock market was already playing catch-up after Monday\u2019s holiday close. Within a few minutes of opening, the ASX 200 benchmark index was more than 5% down, with all major sub-indices lower.   The drop was not a surprise given the steep falls in the US, including 4.7% for the tech-concentrated Nasdaq index overnight. The main concern for investors is that the spike in inflation continues to be worse than feared, which will prompt central banks to send interest rates higher, faster.  The US Federal Reserve, for instance, is now expected to lift its key rate by 0.75 percentage points later this week. The S&amp;P 500, a broad measure of US stocks, is down 9% in just three days, Bloomberg notes. The Aussie dollar has also lost ground lately, trading at about 69.5 US cents in recent trade, down from 72 cents last week. No doubt more to come.

He will join Labor\u2019s finance minister, Katy Gallagher, as the ACT\u2019s two upper-house representatives, while former Liberal senator Zed Seselja will miss out. It\u2019s now been more than three weeks since the May 21 election date, but the complicated process of distributing Senate preferences \u2013 about 115m preferences nationally, the AEC said \u2013 means it takes far longer to officially name upper-house results than those in the House of Representatives.  On Tuesday, the AEC named Gallagher and Pocock as the two senators for the ACT, after preferences were distributed.  \u201cAs with all aspects of the count, the automated distribution of preferences undertaken today was open to scrutineers appointed by the candidates,\u201d said Australian Electoral Officer for the Australian Capital Territory, David Molnar. The Northern Territory\u2019s Senate spots will be revealed later today. The rest of Australia\u2019s Senate composition will be notified \u201csoon\u201d, the AEC said.  The electoral commission said on Twitter that the Senate result was \u201cone of the most complex upper house counts in the world \u2013 it\u2019s so complex that we needed to write a program to distribute your preferences, as doing it by hand would mean we couldn\u2019t provide elected Senators in time to take their seat.\u201d  Updated at 1.45am BST    1.13am    The ASX is following Wall Street into a tumble:   You can read more on the story at the link below:    Updated at 1.30am BST    1.06am    Bowen says export and price control needs to go through parliament I wanted to return to Chris Bowen, who also made the media rounds this morning. He told RN Breakfast that there is a chance the government will seek to implement a 90-day temporary export and price control, to deal with the energy crisis. But he also warned the government does not have a \u201clegislative basis\u201d to introduce short term reforms.    But we would need to take that through parliament, there\u2019s no legislative basis at the moment. One thing this government will not do is \u2026 respond with an ad hoc reaction \u2026 we\u2019ve had enough knee-jerk reactions. There are real challenges, when we have a reform process we will explain it, we\u2019ll take it through parliament and we will seek it.   Updated at 1.15am BST    12.49am   Marles says 'door is open' to further meetings with China  Deputy PM Richard Marles made the rounds this morning, speaking from Tokyo and saying that he intends to build stronger relationships with Japan, while being open to further meetings with China.  It comes after Beijing ended its diplomatic freeze of Australia, and a breakthrough meeting in Singapore, where \u201cfull and frank\u201d discussions were had on tensions in the Pacific and South China Sea. Speaking to the ABC, Marles said he had wanted to ensure the \u201crelationship was put in a better place\u201d:   There was a desire in the meeting that we had, on both sides, to have the relationship put in a better place. The door is open to having further meetings, but I think we do need to understand that the relationship has not been in a good place at all, and this is only the first step and there\u2019s still a long way to go. We want to assert our rights in places like the South China Sea; we see the importance of a global, rules-based order in the Pacific. We\u2019re going to go about our relations with China, but our relations with the whole world in a way which is professional, where we understand the importance of dialogue where we believe in the power of diplomacy.  Marles also appeared on the Today Show, emphasising his intention to build stronger military ties between Australia and Japan:    We\u2019re not going to be looking to other countries in terms of influencing the relationships that we build with friends like Japan. So we\u2019re building this relationship with Japan on its own terms and it\u2019s never been more important. China is seeking to shape the world around it in a way that it has not done before. That makes our strategic circumstances complex. Both Japan and Australia are allies of the United States. We both have an interest in keeping the United States as engaged as possible within East Asia.    Updated at 1.43am BST    12.36am         12.31am    Dan Tehan wants parliament to return Dan Tehan, opposition immigration spokesman, says the government should bring forward its first sitting date to deal with the energy crisis, and accusing Labor of trying to avoid scrutiny.  This, of course, comes only months after the Coalition had laid out a schedule with only 10 (that\u2019s right, 10) sitting days before August 2022.  Tehan was on Sky News this morning, and said he wanted to hold the government accountable early (obviously there\u2019s much more energy when in opposition):   The parliament is the place where we are able to hold the government to account, we\u2019ve got an energy crisis and a skills crisis and we\u2019re not sitting until the end of July, why? I\u2019m incredibly surprised, this was a government that said accountability and transparency will be at the forefront of everything they do. It\u2019s right to say the government should think about pulling this trigger, if we can\u2019t get the gas at the right price to our manufacturing industries in particular, we\u2019re going to see dire consequences as a result. These are the types of questions we should be able to put to the parliament when the parliament sits.

It was hoped the policy would create an extra 47,000 places across the state, enable private childcare operators to expand or build new centres and increase the workforce, including through university scholarships for early childhood teachers.  Announcing the policy at a Committee for Sydney event on Tuesday morning, the treasurer, Matt Kean, said the investment was good economic policy for everyone, not just women.  He said:   Childcare should not be a postcode lottery. This reform will transform childcare in NSW. Good women\u2019s policy is also good economic policy for everyone.  Kean said the loss of female voters for the federal Liberals at the May election was devastating and that he would work to support women in NSW. He said:   I was devastated by that because my party should be the standard-bearer for individual liberty that makes our country great.   Updated at 12.14am BST    11.53pm   Energy minister says Australia in for 'bumpy' winter  The federal energy minister, Chris Bowen, has said Australia is facing a \u201cbumpy\u201d winter as energy shortfalls bite across the east coast.  Bowen was on Sunrise this morning, and said that while there was increased strain on the energy system, he remained confident the situation could be managed.   There is a big chunk of coal-fired power out of action in Queensland. That has led to higher prices, and \u2026 with the situation in Ukraine, flooding and it being a bit colder earlier than normal, that has increased the load on the system. It\u2019s all being actively managed. We can have confidence in our operators, regulators who are working together with the states. I believe that will result in a better situation for energy consumers and avoid blackouts and certainly minimise the risk of any load shedding activities. The operator tells me there is no need to be concerned about blackouts in the immediate future. I\u2019m not here to give a magical guarantee, but I am here to say that everything that could be done is being done very actively.   Updated at 11.58pm BST    11.41pm   Calls for a public holiday to celebrate Socceroos win  Socceroos coach Graham Arnold has asked the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, to declare a public holiday in celebration of Australia\u2019s qualification for the Fifa World Cup \u2013 and he\u2019s already got one high-profile political supporter in federal energy and climate minister Chris Bowen.  \u201cA four-day weekend to celebrate the Socceroos win, is something I think we can all get behind,\u201d Bowen told Radio National this morning. \u201cThere\u2019s a prime ministerial tradition isn\u2019t there \u2013 any boss who sacks their worker for turning up late today is a bum, that\u2019s what the prime minister should say on a day like this, we can all agree.\u201d Bowen was of course referencing former PM Bob Hawke\u2019s immortal declaration after Australia\u2019s 1983 America\u2019s Cup win. We\u2019re not sure if we\u2019ll see Albanese in front of the cameras in a special white jacket adorned with AUSTRALIA, though. The current PM has only tweeted a simple congratulations (so far) to mark the Socceroos win.  \u201cWe\u2019re very proud of them, a great day for Australia,\u201d Bowen continued on RN. Other politicians got on the Socceroos bandwagon, with a bunch of Labor MPs getting up early to live-tweet much of the game. Labor senator Nita Green joked Australia was \u201cgoing to be late for work\u201d after the early morning start.  Minister for Sport, Anika Wells, was getting behind new national hero, Andrew Redmayne, who made the ultimate penalty save to seal the Socceroos win.  New MP for Bennelong, Jerome Laxale, asked Albanese for \u201cpermission to do the Redmayne dance in question time\u201d.   Updated at 11.50pm BST    11.33pm    Lack of reserve notice from energy regulator It\u2019s going to be a long day by the looks of it when it comes to \u201clack of reserve\u201d notices and intervention by the Australian Energy Market Operator, such as this early one in NSW:  As mentioned in this article, the price caps result in a lot of generators dropping out, and then the regulators are going to have to ask them to jump back in. Seems like an odd way to run things, but Chris Bowen, the federal energy minister, says that\u2019s the market we have to work with. (Cue: perhaps we need to review how the market operates.) As for the mix of what\u2019s in the market overnight, and at the start of the day across the National Electricity Market (NEM), here\u2019s the scene:  The NEM, of course, is really only the eastern states and most of South Australia. Western Australia operates its own grids. Still that\u2019s about 80% of the population, and hence, I suppose, the \u201cnational\u201d tag still works.  Updated at 11.55pm BST    11.28pm    Theft on a large scale In a very interesting story this morning, Western Australia Police are appealing to the public for information on a burglary from December, where three people stole a sea container with approximately $100,000 worth of mining equipment inside it. Police say two men and a woman gained entry to into a commercial yard on Wellard Street in Bibra Lake on 28 December, and used a sea container handler to load a 6-metre (!!) sea container onto a truck (that they also stole in August 2021).    It is believed the truck used to transport the sea container was stolen from a commercial yard in Naval Base in August 2021. The truck was later found burnt out on a rural property in Oldbury on Wednesday 8 June 2022.  Anyone with information is asked to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or report online at crimestopperswa.com.au  Updated at 11.54pm BST    11.21pm         11.18pm   Robert Hughes due to be deported  Convicted paedophile and former star of Hey Dad! Robert Hughes, is set to be deported to the UK today.  Hughes was granted parole earlier this month by the NSW State Parole Authority, which determined he be released from Long Bay correctional facility no later than Tuesday. The 73-year-old renounced his Australian citizenship in 2020, becoming a non-lawful citizen requiring deportation upon release. Australian Border Force, who usually handles the deportation of convicted criminals who are not Australian citizens, told AAP it does not comment on operational matters.  Updated at 11.24pm BST    11.08pm    World Cup joy Between politicians discussing energy and childcare, we still had the joy of the Socceroos winning their World Cup qualifier this morning, and I felt the ABC\u2019s Tony Armstrong captured the mood pretty perfectly:    Updated at 11.12pm BST    10.57pm   Shorten calls for less 'argy-bargy' from opposition on energy crisis  Next off the bench is government services and NDIS minister (and former Labor leader) Bill Shorten, who is blaming the cold for the energy shortfall in NSW and Queensland. Speaking to the Today Show, Shorten also added that \u201cdispatchable power\u201d was essential to combating the energy crisis. He also urged the opposition to join Laor in ending the \u201cenergy market operator wars.\u201d  The very cold weather, combined with let\u2019s face it, 10 years of delay and denial about investing in our energy market operator grid, and the chickens have come to roost. You need what\u2019s called dispatchable power. That\u2019s power that you don\u2019t need to be paying for seven days, 24 hours a week but when it\u2019s really cold, that\u2019s when you need it. (Australians) want to hear that the government and opposition are working together. The truth is we need more dispatchable power (and) renewable energy is cheaper. Let\u2019s move forward. Less of the argy-bargy and more of the action.   Updated at 11.01pm BST    10.44pm    Matt Kean on NSW\u2019s $5bn childcare package Kean has gone on to spruik the state government\u2019s new $5bn childcare policy, which he says will grow the state\u2019s economy by $17.4bn.    What it will do is see up to 95,000 women be able to enter the workforce or take on more hours. I mean, childcare costs are attacks on the dreams of women and families right across New South Wales, indeed right across the country. We believe that families should have access to quality affordable childcare no matter where they live ... And these reforms will deliver a middle-income family in New South Wales who have one child full-time care savings of up to $3,900 per annum.  When asked if the state was stepping in to fill a role usually reserved for the federal government, Kean avoided the question:   This is one of the biggest productivity reforms that we can have that will grow our economy. And obviously lift living standards in this state. Our policy is focused on providing additional childcare \u2013 accessible and affordable childcare across New South Wales \u2013 will grow the overall size of the economy by $17.4 billion.    Updated at 10.47pm BST    10.39pm   NSW treasurer says he is confident in 'reliability' of energy system  NSW treasurer Matt Kean says he has confidence in the \u201creliability of the system,\u201d indicating he is not expecting any blackouts in the coming days.  Speaking to Patricia Karvelas on RN Breakfast, Kean said the government was monitoring the situation, but asked people to be conscious of their power usage.   We\u2019re obviously monitoring the situation very closely. But this situation has arisen because the wholesale prices of electricity have gone above a point which triggers the market cap. That cap is in place to protect consumers. And because the price of electricity that the generators can get for supplying electricity into the market is too low to cover their costs, they\u2019re not bidding into the system. So this is a market failure issue. We\u2019re not telling people to turn off the heaters, we\u2019re not telling people to turn down their air conditioners or anything like that. But people should just be conscious that where they can reduce their use of electricity, that\u2019s a good thing for them. It\u2019s going to lower their power bills, and it\u2019s also going to take a bit of pressure off the system.    Updated at 10.48pm BST    10.26pm    Socceroos qualify for the World Cup Before we jump into the inevitable flow of politicians making the media rounds this morning, I wanted to point to Emma Kemp\u2019s ongoing live blog of Australia\u2019s World Cup qualifier.  Earlier this morning, Australia beat Peru on penalties to make their fifth consecutive World Cup:   You can also read the match report, linked here.  Updated at 10.48pm BST    10.23pm   Good morning  Good morning, and happy World Cup qualification day! Mostafa Rachwani with you this morning, to take you through the day\u2019s news.  We begin in New South Wales, where energy authorities are on high alert for possible power shortfalls hitting homes and businesses tonight. It comes after Queensland only narrowly avoided blackouts last night, after the Australian Energy Market Operator worked to head off a gap projected at one stage to be 1,454 megawatts.  In federal politics, deputy prime minister Richard Marles will be in Tokyo today, maintaining the jet-setting ways of this new government. Marles will be calling for stronger military ties between Japan and Australia, emphasising the need to strengthen the relationship between the two countries.  Back in NSW, the state government there has unveiled its signature budget policy, which will allow private childcare operators to expand or build new centres, in the hopes of creating an extra 47,000 places across the state.  Finally, prime minister Anthony Albanese is considering whether to attend a NATO summit in Madrid at the end of the month, and to support the alliance toughening its stance against Russia.  There is still much going on, so let\u2019s dive in.   "

                    "body": "1) A planned impromptu drinks break Although it may be coincidence, someone far more observant than this column recently noticed that Southampton appear to have devised a clever, completely legal mid-game tactic that involves one of their players going down \u201cinjured\u201d and in apparent need of medical attention between the 60th and 70th minute, at which point their teammates adjourn to the sideline to receive energy gels and tactical instruction from Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl and his backroom team. Should it occur on Friday evening, we can but hope it won\u2019t be the most interesting talking point to arise from their match against Norwich, but it has piqued our curiosity and is the first of our now traditional 10 things to look out for this weekend. BG  Southampton v Norwich City, Friday 8pm (all times GMT)  2) Toffees still in sticky situation With Liverpool otherwise engaged at Wembley, Manchester City have a chance to reopen a six-point lead at the top. In Frank Lampard they take on a former City player; the manager\u2019s single, 2014-15 season in Manchester a forgotten coda to his long spell at Chelsea. Beating Leeds 3-0 two weeks ago lent optimism to his new Everton regime, only for last week\u2019s 2-0 defeat at Southampton to reintroduce the Goodison gloom. Leeds conceding nine goals in their next two matches further deepened it, and all four of the teams below Everton in the table have been in better form over the past five matches. That Leeds and Brentford are on more of a slide may ease some of the nerves but Everton are in their deepest relegation trouble since the 2001-02 season when David Moyes was brought in to escape the drop. In such a situation, a wounded, motivated City feel the opposite of the ideal opponents to face. JB  Everton v Manchester City, Saturday 5.30pm  3) Watford need another turning point When Watford beat Manchester United 4-1 at Vicarage Road in November to bring down the guillotine on Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s spell in Old Trafford\u2019s managerial hotseat, they sat 16th in the league, as close to eighth-placed United as they were to the bottom three with the season nearly a third of the way through. It was a turning point in both sides\u2019 campaigns: since then only Manchester City and Liverpool have outperformed United, who have taken 29 points from 14 games, while not until last Saturday did Watford win another game, and their five points from 13 is, on a points per game basis, not far off twice as bad as Everton, the next worst-performing team in the division (0.38 v 0.63). It goes without saying that the Hornets desperately need another turning point but though Roy Hodgson has brought greater defensive organisation, he has not eliminated individual mistakes, has reduced the side\u2019s attacking ambition, and salvation looks as distant as ever. SB  Manchester United v Watford, Saturday 3pm   4) Weary resignation at Elland Road Antonio Conte and Marcelo Bielsa have both recently admitted they are struggling to justifying their large salaries and when Leeds host Tottenham on Saturday, the game is likely to be a Derby della Despair for one of them in the event of any outcome other than a draw. While Tottenham go into the game as hot favourites, only a wild optimist would bet heavily on them to prevail despite the porousness of their hosts\u2019 defence. While Bielsa\u2019s future is constantly clouded in uncertainty, Friday\u2019s press conference will reveal if his opposite number has calmed down since his very public existential crisis in the wake of midweek defeat at Burnley. As rare as the sight of elite managers falling on their swords might be, it would be massively surprising if the result of this Saturday\u2019s lunchtime game prompted one of the Premier League\u2019s two more impassioned leaders to decide the jig is up. BG  Leeds v Tottenham, Saturday 12.30pm  5) Bees crying out for saviour to lead them to safety At some point during this relegation six-pointer, Christian Eriksen is expected to make his first appearance for Brentford. Almost certainly as a substitute, he will return to top-level football eight months after he suffered his cardiac arrest during Euro 2020. And the stakes will almost immediately be sky high. Brentford are crying out for a saviour, having collected just one point from a possible 21 since beating Aston Villa on 2 January. Newcastle are heading in the opposite direction, having taken 10 from a possible 12, and on last week\u2019s visit to London had West Ham on the ropes before having to settle for a point. A win at the Community Stadium can leapfrog Eddie Howe\u2019s team over that of Thomas Frank, who hope to have Ivan Toney back leading the line. Toney, cast aside from Newcastle during Rafael Ben\u00edtez\u2019s reign, was a scorer when the teams drew 3-3 in November, Howe\u2019s first match in charge. JB  Brentford v Newcastle, Saturday 3pm  6) Villa to offer Brighton home comfort? They might be ninth but last week\u2019s defeat to Burnley was not entirely out of the blue for a Brighton side who boast only one home win in five months now. Encouragingly this weekend\u2019s opponents, Aston Villa, have lost to Newcastle and Watford in their past two games, managing only one shot on target in each fixture, which led Steven Gerrard to this intriguing analysis last week: \u201cWe\u2019ve had 19 shots but only managed one on target, so we haven\u2019t worked [Watford goalkeeper] Ben Foster anywhere near enough and that falls on my shoulders. That\u2019s on me and my staff to be more inventive and creative in the final third. We\u2019ve got talented players in there. We\u2019ve got internationals, Brazilians, Argentinians and England internationals. Players have got to want to get in the right areas and people have got to want to create and score. The result falls on me, I\u2019ll take that and I\u2019ll take the heat to protect the players but moving forward you need to be better in the final third.\u201d Which appears to translate fairly clearly as: \u201cIt\u2019s my fault we haven\u2019t been more creative. Although obviously it\u2019s the players\u2019 fault. Just to be clear, I\u2019ll take the blame for this, but it\u2019s on them.\u201d SB  Brighton v Aston Villa, Saturday 3pm  7) Will Wolves cash in at West Ham? West Ham\u2019s wobble since the turn of the year could have been more costly: they are still four points behind fourth-placed Manchester United, but their stalled form has fans grumbling. A failure to freshen up the squad in January is likely to be costly. That Michail Antonio, Tomas Soucek and Pablo Fornals have flagged is understandable given their workload in a thin squad. As well as a Champions League place \u2013 a publicly stated target from the club\u2019s ownership when they moved to the London Stadium in 2016 \u2013 it could cost them an extra year of Declan Rice. Wolves, Sunday\u2019s opponents, have refreshed their squad by cashing in assets to bring in fresh talent with an efficiency not reflected in the Hammers\u2019 tentative steps into the transfer market. And with Newcastle now also flush, the chance to top the Premier League\u2019s middle class may already have been squandered. JB  West Ham v Wolves, Sunday 2pm  8) A Burnley side set in its set-piece ways It\u2019s been a little under three years since Burnley last won back-to-back-to-back Premier League matches but Sean Dyche\u2019s men can make it three on the spin against a Crystal Palace side that have managed successive wins only once this season. That the first of those two triumphs came at Manchester City tells you all you need to know about Palace\u2019s progress under Patrick Vieira \u2013 they are a team capable of beating the best on their day but are maddeningly inconsistent and often don\u2019t get the results their performances deserve. The corresponding fixture at Turf Moor earlier this season was one such game, with Palace gifting Burnley a share of the points in an entertaining 3-3 draw through their inability to defend set pieces. It is a frailty Sean Dyche will look to exploit again, having seen his players score once and go close with at least two other headed opportunities from dead-ball situations against Tottenham. BG  Crystal Palace v Burnley, Saturday 3pm   9) Reds back on way to Wembley The time when Liverpool fans would call Wembley \u201cAnfield South\u201d lies long in the past. J\u00fcrgen Klopp has concentrated his squad\u2019s efforts on winning the Champions League and Premier League during his time in England, choosing to blood youth in the domestic cup competitions. Sunday\u2019s Carabao Cup showpiece will be only the second English cup final Klopp has presided over, the last coming in February 2016, when he had been in charge for barely four months. Liverpool lost that League Cup final to Manchester City on penalties and \u2013 of Klopp\u2019s squad that day \u2013 only Jordan Henderson, James Milner, Roberto Firmino and Divock Origi remain. The overhaul that Klopp has carried out in those six years is reflected in names such as Simon Mignolet, Nathaniel Clyne, Alberto Moreno, Mamadou Sakho, Philippe Coutinho and Emre Can, all of them decent, talented players but expendable to a manager who has transformed the club and widened their horizons. JB  Chelsea v Liverpool, Sunday 4.30pm  10) Chelsea calling for shots? Chelsea have had 20 shots on target and scored six goals in the Premier League this calendar year; Liverpool have had 19 shots on target and scored nine goals this week. While defensively the two teams have been comparable this season (Chelsea have conceded 17 goals to Liverpool\u2019s 19, and 76 shots on target to Liverpool\u2019s 72) the Reds\u2019 attack is not so much streets ahead of their opponents\u2019 as entire motorway networks more advanced. Meanwhile J\u00fcrgen Klopp said after Wednesday\u2019s thrashing of Leeds that in midfield \u201cmore often than not you need really fresh legs\u201d and has been putting those words into practice \u2013 Liverpool\u2019s two matches this week featured entirely different starting midfield threes, two of them later being substituted on each occasion. This makes it hard to guess whose legs will be freshest come Sunday but though the remainder of the team could feasibly be unchanged some kind of reshuffle here seems likely. SB "

                    "body": "In January 2005, Mahmoud Abbas, then 70, had just launched his campaign for Palestinian Authority president. Arriving on a grey, mild day in the occupied West Bank city of Jenin, he was lifted on to the shoulders of an ecstatic crowd numbering about 10,000 people. While nowhere near as charismatic as his predecessor, Yasser Arafat, who had died two months before, Abbas was nonetheless welcomed as a reformer and a man of peace. Abbas, commonly referred to by his kunya, Abu Mazen, won the presidency by a significant majority a few weeks later. A major architect of the Oslo peace process, his win delighted the Israelis and the Americans: unlike Arafat, Abu Mazen had vociferously denounced the violence of what was by then the ebbing second intifada, or Palestinian uprising. His future, and that of Palestine in general, held much promise. But just a year later, because of Fatah party infighting over candidate lists, the Islamist movement Hamas won the parliamentary elections, leading to a brief civil war in which the Palestinian Authority (PA) lost control of the Gaza Strip. The rest of Abbas\u2019s long tenure has resembled that of a stereotypical regional autocrat, determined to cling on to power. Nearly two decades later, the Oslo accords no longer address the political reality on the ground; Abu Mazen\u2019s Fatah party and the umbrella Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO), riddled with corruption, have little support among younger generations; and the authority he oversees works with Israel to oppress its own people. Palestinian Authority forces have been sent after union leaders, activists, journalists and even ordinary citizens who dare to write critical social media posts, while over the years Abbas has steadily consolidated control over institutional bodies and sidelined the defunct Palestinian parliament. Its legislative powers were officially transferred in 2018, making it easier to appoint allies to top PLO positions. The president is now 87, and in failing health. A long-term smoker, he was admitted to hospital twice this summer, and every now and then the internet circulates rumours of his death. The last surviving member of the Palestinian national movement\u2019s founding generation, as his biographers put it, Abu Mazen has \u201clived his people\u2019s history\u201d; his passing will mark a significant moment in the Palestinian story. What comes next, however, is a vexed question. There has not been a Palestinian election for 16 years, and Abbas has never appointed an official successor. Few have faith in an agreement brokered in Algeria last week to hold legislative and presidential elections within one year, and the president\u2019s office did not respond to several requests for an interview. Now, in the twilight of a disappointing reign, it is still not clear what will happen in the days and weeks after his death. Several scenarios \u2013 some of them violent \u2013 could play out, putting the Palestinian statehood he struggled for as a younger man further out of reach than ever.  \u201cThe thing about Abu Mazen is, he\u2019s a man of extreme emotion. He loves intensely and he hates intensely. It\u2019s his most important feature, it\u2019s what defines him,\u201d said Nasser al-Qidwa, who was expelled from Fatah\u2019s central committee last year after challenging Abbas in the cancelled 2021 elections. \u201cHe was in Arafat\u2019s shadow for 15, 20 years. When he was gone it was his time to shine, and to take revenge.\u201d Abu Mazen was born in 1935 in the Galilee to a lower middle-class family who fled to the Syrian capital of Damascus in 1948 after Israel\u2019s creation. He studied law and worked as a teacher before moving in the 1950s for a civil service job in Qatar, where he met Arafat and became involved with his fledgling secular Fatah party and the PLO. He later earned a doctorate in Moscow, writing a much-debunked thesis claiming that Zionists collaborated with the Nazis during the Holocaust. Allegedly a KGB agent in the 1980s, his style of leadership today clearly borrows from the Soviet system. A diplomat rather than a warrior, Abbas lived in Damascus with his wife and three sons for decades, fundraising and fostering the PLO\u2019s international relationships. He was an early advocate for negotiation with the Israelis, as well as a two-state solution to the conflict, but was largely pushed off the political stage after the creation of the authority in 1994.  At the behest of Washington, Arafat begrudgingly made him prime minister in 2003. After the \u201cOld Man\u2019s\u201d death the following year, Abu Mazen was well placed to run for the authority\u2019s leadership. Today, Abbas\u2019s rule is a mesh of contradictions. He is a master of palace intrigue, playing allies and underlings within his Fatah, PLO and authority circles against each other. He also generally enjoys the respect of international counterparts, who still praise his pivotal role in peace accords in the 1990s. In Palestinian society, however, he is ridiculed as inept and incoherent. In Israel, the PA president is no longer seen as a partner for peace, but since he is a bulwark against the likes of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, he is not viewed as an enemy, either. \u201cOur regime is not a platonic model, but there are multiple reasons for that,\u201d said Jibril Rajoub, the secretary general of Fatah\u2019s central committee and a close ally of the president. \u201cAbu Mazen is the only Palestinian leader with elected legitimacy and a mandate. He is the only one who can and should lead. His critics are free from the constraints he operates under.\u201d Simultaneously vigorous and ossified, razor sharp and bluntly ineffective, the president embodies the current chapter of the Palestinian struggle. That does not augur well for the future. In the event of Abu Mazen\u2019s resignation or death in office, under Palestinian law, the speaker of parliament is supposed to become provisional president and issue an election decree within 60 days. The 2006 Fatah-Hamas split, however, means this is near impossible, and there are no clear institutional mechanisms to otherwise manage the transition. Instead, it is widely expected that the Abbas supporter Hussein al-Sheikh, who in May was appointed secretary general of the Palestinian Authority\u2019s executive committee, will take over as both authority and PLO president. Formerly in charge of coordination with Israel, and accused of corruption and sexual assault \u2013 allegations he has denied \u2013 the 60-year-old is deeply unpopular. In interviews, he has said the next Palestinian leader should be elected, but only if Israel allowed people in occupied East Jerusalem to vote, which is unlikely. He has also emphasised the importance of the authority\u2019s relationship with Israel, and a visit to Washington earlier this month has been interpreted as White House backing for Sheikh as Abu Mazen\u2019s successor. Several other contenders exist for the top job within the highly factionalised Fatah, including the Abbas loyalist Majed al-Faraj, the head of the general intelligence service, and Mahmoud Aloul, Fatah\u2019s deputy chair. One bitter rival, Marwan Barghouti, serving five life sentences in an Israeli prison, remains extremely popular on the Palestinian street, and declared he would run for the presidency from his cell in 2021\u2019s cancelled elections. Mohammed Dahlan, another enemy living in self-imposed exile in Abu Dhabi, has become an extremely influential regional player and is believed to maintain links to armed groups in both the West Bank and Gaza. Power struggles within the party could inflame the wave of violence engulfing the West Bank, in which newly formed Palestinian militias are taking on both Israeli and authority forces. Another civil war with Hamas, an Arab spring-style uprising against the authority, or a third intifada against Israel, are all possibilities in the event of a major power vacuum. Israel is prepared for all of the above scenarios, although reportedly no military drills have been held since 2018. According to the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth, an Israel Defence Forces (IDF) plan codenamed \u201cSunset\u201d deals with the immediate aftermath following Abbas\u2019s death, including major troop deployment across the West Bank and potential operations for rescuing illegal Israeli settlers. A second plan, being referred to as \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d, is designed for a situation in which rival Palestinian militant groups and political factions attempt to seize control in different areas of the West Bank.  Dr Hanan Ashrawi, who resigned from the PLO executive committee in 2020 on the grounds that the political system needed \u201crenewal and reinvigoration\u201d, argues that focusing on what will happen \u201cthe day after Abu Mazen\u2019\u2019 obscures the fact that his political project has already failed. \u201cThe situation is an ongoing, slippery slope. It\u2019s not entirely Abbas\u2019s fault: we live under a deliberately cruel occupation, and everything was done to make the PA fail and present them as subcontractors for Israeli security,\u201d she said. \u201cThe weaker the system, the more it closes in on itself and the more oppressive it becomes. I don\u2019t know what shape the future will take \u2026 It could be peaceful. But the longer it takes to see real change, violence becomes more probable. If you don\u2019t allow for peaceful democratic ways of transferring power, people will find other means to express themselves.\u201d Even if the transition to a post-Abu-Mazen era is smooth, even if free and fair elections are held in a timely fashion, in which reform-minded Fatah factions or new political parties triumph, the next administration will still face major problems. Deepening divides in Palestinian politics, and the nature of the authority\u2019s relationship with Israel, are issues that will remain. Abbas could claim the inheritance of the Palestinian national project when he was elected in 2005; whoever replaces him will be a partisan candidate who will struggle to reunite the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. And as long as Israeli politics continues its march rightwards, resumption of the peace process is a distant dream. Al sabr wa al samud, patience and steadfastness, has often served as Abu Mazen\u2019s political mantra. His squandered legacy is proof enough it is no longer fit for purpose."

                    "body": "What has gone wrong at Heathrow? The airport that confidently laid out expansion plans and charged its customers a hefty premium has been repeatedly suffering the kind of chaos people pay money to avoid: flight cancellations, long queues, lost baggage mountains and strike threats. Now, at the start of the full summer peak, it has told airlines to turn passengers away. In a week when baking temperatures swept across Britain, few places were feeling the heat more. Heathrow\u2019s own posters highlighting the \u201celephant in the room\u201d \u2013 aviation\u2019s contribution to climate change \u2013 have never looked more apposite as the mercury hit a record 40.2C at the airport, the grass between its runways parched a desert brown. Last week, Heathrow announced a 100,000 daily cap on passengers until 11 September, infuriating airlines and putting thousands of customers\u2019 plans in jeopardy. The airport insisted it was \u201cprotecting holidays\u201d, but the response was fierce. Emirates initially refused point blank to comply or cancel flights. In some of the milder invective, Willie Walsh, the director general of Iata \u2013 and an old frenemy from running British Airways and its parent group, IAG \u2013 has described Heathrow as \u201ca bunch of idiots when it comes to running airports\u201d. Anxious storm clouds of passengers Inside the airport terminals this week, the line between exceedingly busy and frantic was thin. At least, though, the air conditioning was working. In a late morning lull in Terminal 5, it did not look like chaos. \u201cGive it a couple of hours,\u201d a BA staffer at the queueing ropes said, grinning, a mild sweat on. \u201cIt just comes and goes \u2026 Just random.\u201d The airline sector\u2019s turmoil is self-perpetuating: huge queues grow with anxious passengers turning up ever earlier for flights. Wider travel disruption does not help: installed with laptop and luggage in Pret, one seasoned traveller said he had arrived nine hours before his flight to Australia, after warnings that the heat could halt the trains he needed for the airport. The adjacent Terminal 2 is Heathrow\u2019s most modern addition \u2013 opened in 2014 with the optimistic objective of passengers traversing to and from the plane in minutes, without traditional check-in lanes. Now though, a man in a suit was explaining patiently over and again to customers that despite checking in online, they must still enter the daunting United Airlines queue to comply with US security procedures. All around, various staff \u2013 in airline livery, hi-vis vests or the pink polo shirts of \u201cHeathrow helpers\u201d \u2013 are marshalling incoming groups that appear and disperse like rumbling storm clouds.  Post-Covid restrictions, with corporate travel down, ever fewer passengers are likely to be mobile, unencumbered, tech-savvy frequent flyers. Many here are non-English speaking, with large amounts of luggage; old, young, infirm, faced by bewildering layouts, prompts for QR codes and additional Covid documentation, and needing assistance of all kinds. And if terminals can appear chaotic, the worst problems have been airside. Delays today are relatively minor but the arrivals board now has an additional feature alongside a flight\u2019s landing time: whether its bags have been delivered or are arriving. While BA\u2019s flight from Kuwait landed more than 90 minutes ago, the bags have yet to make it to the carousels. So cutting passenger numbers by just a few thousand can make a huge difference to those who do travel, according to Heathrow\u2019s chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, defiant in Terminal 5 on Tuesday, after mounting speculation over his future. \u201cWe\u2019re taking action with the cap to protect people\u2019s holidays. We\u2019ve got 100,000 passengers travelling through today, it\u2019s the hottest day we\u2019ve ever had, and the airport is working smoothly. That shows that the action we\u2019re taking, in difficult circumstances, is working.\u201d Pointing the finger Holland-Kaye said no one wanted a \u201cblame game\u201d, but said the overriding factor was a lack of airline ground handling staff, either contracted out \u2013 to companies such as Menzies, Swissport or Cobalt \u2013 or directly employed. The main effect of the cap will be limiting further ticket sales, but about 1,500 passengers on the busiest summer days will be forced to change their plans, on top of the hundreds of thousands already bumped by mass BA cancellations ordered earlier this summer. \u201cThe reality is that if the airport, airlines, or ground handlers don\u2019t have enough capacity, people are not going to get away on their flights in a much worse way: their flights cancelled after they\u2019ve checked in, maybe even on the plane,\u201d Holland-Kaye said. \u201cThat\u2019s the worst of all worlds.\u201d Labour shortages have been worsened by lengthy background checks for new recruits and competition from other sectors.  Surprisingly few things actually come under the airport\u2019s direct remit, bar the security officers and provision of the infrastructure. Airlines run check-in. The immigration hall, scene of previous years\u2019 headline-hitting queues, is the responsibility of the Home Office and its Border Force employees. While the automated baggage systems are (usually) kept functioning by Heathrow, the handlers who put the bags in or take them off are employed, or contracted, by airlines. Even the people on the tarmac, driving trucks to bring luggage, attaching air bridges or pushing back aircraft from the stand, are the airlines\u2019 direct or outsourced staff.  \u2018Excessive\u2019 shareholder returns Airlines, however, point to multiple Heathrow failures: the understaffed security that saw long queues at Easter; the unreliable baggage system; and a failure to plan before the cap, brought in at the 11th hour. As Holland-Kaye himself put it, there are 400 separate companies working at the airport, and his role is to \u201ckeep all of them working in tandem\u201d. While airlines such as BA have concurred and cut ever more flights from their schedule to keep the plates spinning, the latest standoff has played out to a backdrop of a bitter row over landing charges. Heathrow had proposed to double the price, set by the UK regulator, that it can make airlines pay per passenger. That prompted a furious backlash from carriers who have sustained huge losses and query whether Heathrow\u2019s shareholders \u2013 largely Qatar and other sovereign wealth funds \u2013 should be digging deeper, after taking \u00a34bn in dividends in the last decade.  Heathrow\u2019s ever-increasing debt, up to \u00a315.4bn at last count, has financed investment that directly raises returns the more it builds, under the regulatory system. Airlines see it as enjoying an enviably stable position \u2013 or as the chief executive of Virgin Atlantic, Shai Weiss, put it: \u201cAbusing its monopoly position to fleece passengers and deliver excessive returns to shareholders.\u201d At the Farnborough airshow this week, Walsh said Heathrow was unprepared for the strength of recovery because of its own pessimistic forecasting, which he claimed was to \u201cgame\u201d the regulator to allow it to hike landing charges. While airlines had spotted pent-up demand recovery, Heathrow played it down. Holland-Kaye rejects the accusation, saying airlines should have hired more handlers earlier if they expected the bounce back.  The blame game appears to have some way to run \u2013 as do the problems. Holland-Kaye says it will take 12-18 months for the staffing issues to resolve. The cap may not lift for half-term or Christmas, he hinted: \u201cThey have about 70% of the staff trying to serve about 80-85% of the passengers and that doesn\u2019t work.\u201d"

                    "body": "Sam Smith is the James Milner of powerchair football. \u201cI\u2019ve sort of had that nickname for a bit,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m reliable, I\u2019m versatile and I can play in different positions. I think I\u2019m always a seven out of 10 and the lads in our team are pretty quiet while I\u2019m always talking. So yeah, I\u2019ve been likened to Milner, which has its positives. I\u2019m not the flair player but every team needs someone like me.\u201d Alongside his Northern Thunder teammates, Smith is set to take on West Bromwich Albion on Sunday in the Powerchair cup final. The Baggies are the sport\u2019s dominant team, and the Thunder the only team to have beaten them this season. It\u2019s not a grudge match \u2013 there are England teammates on both sides \u2013 but it\u2019s an intense rivalry and will be just one story played out over the FA Disability Cup Finals weekend.  In a showcase of the best of disability football, six cup finals will be held in front of crowds at St George\u2019s Park and shown live on BT Sport over Saturday and Sunday. Partially sighted, blind, deaf, cerebral palsy, powerchair and amputee versions of the game will be given an unprecedented showcase, and those involved in each variation hope it will help to continue a sense of growth and progress. Smith\u2019s relationship with football goes back a long way. Born in Newcastle, he was diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy aged three and unable to walk by the age of 10, bringing an end to a youthful love affair with what he calls \u201cthe running game\u201d. But after his father was handed a leaflet advertising powerchair football, Smith found a new passion. \u201cThere was a year when I was a bit lost, watching my friends and my brothers play after school and unable to join them,\u201d he says. \u201cBut then I found powerchair football and fell in love with it straight away. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I\u2019m in control of when maybe before my body would let me down. I knew in my head what I wanted to do, I had a football brain, but physically I couldn\u2019t do it. Now there\u2019s nothing holding me back. There\u2019s no barriers, it\u2019s me and this chair and it\u2019s a level playing field. It\u2019s quite empowering really.\u201d Empowerment is a key component of disability sport, for athletes at all levels and for those who take inspiration from watching them. But there is now a serious attempt to strengthen disability football (in all its forms) as a sport in its own right. This year the FA announced its first strategy for disability football. At its heart was a target of increasing participation at grassroots level by 50% over the next three years. But there were also targets for an increase in coaches and more focus on support for the England national sides, the pinnacle of the game for the disabled footballer.  Natasha Mead\u2019s story serves as a perfect example of the opportunities that are beginning to open up in disability football. The 27-year-old from Plymouth is a blind athlete, an all-rounder who has represented Great Britain at goalball and cricket, and nearly made the Paralympics as a sprinter. She made the switch to football and plays for Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, the only woman in the squad. She is also now an England international, claiming a place in the inaugural women\u2019s blind squad, after the team was created this spring. \u201cI definitely think the game is growing, in particular the female game,\u201d she says. \u201cHopefully we can have a woman\u2019s league in the near future.\u201d For Smith, who has made 14 appearances for England and was part of a victorious side at the last European championships, the focus and direction provided by the national side are helping to drive the powerchair game directly, and in interesting ways. \u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s been echoed through to us from England, leaving the shirt in a better place than you found it,\u201d he says. That means improving yourself as an athlete but also the way in which the game is played. \u201cI think the biggest development over the past few years has been the development of a passing style of play,\u201d Smith says. \u201cIn the early days it was a lot more like bumper cars really. It was all chairs dribbling into each other and it became a bit messy. But one thing we\u2019ve always been told with England is to try and play that passing game, a more expansive version of the game, and to take it back to our clubs to help progress the game, to make it a bit more exciting.\u201d Smith hopes to showcase that style to a watching audience on Sunday. And, more importantly, beat West Brom. \u201cWinning\u2019s the main thing,\u201d he says, \u201cbut it\u2019s a chance to showcase your sport too, to develop it even further and show that disabled people can compete at elite level.\u201d"

He should be a little sharper for the run and is a fair price at around 4-1 to give Australia a first-ever success in this race.\nYork 1.45: Eilean Dubh had little chance from a wide draw at Pontefract last time but remains feasibly handicapped on his winning form over track and trip in May.\nNewmarket 2.05: A slow pace did not do Truely Aclaimed any favours at Ayr last month but she still came home a worthy winner and can continue her progress here.\nYork 2.20: A poor turnout and Thunderous could benefit if Franny Norton gets a soft lead.\nNewmarket 2.40: The form of last month\u2019s Britannia Handicap at Royal Ascot looks as strong as always and Jimi Hendrix, third home there, can give it another boost here.\nAscot 3.00: Tone The Barone has been a regular scorer on the all-weather over the last two seasons but the 16-1 shot was a dual winner over this course and distance in 2020 and is now just 1lb higher than for the second of those wins.\n\nNewmarket 3.15: Brian Meehan\u2019s juveniles generally find plenty for a run so the fact that Isaac Shelby ran out an impressive winner first time up at Newbury in May is encouraging ahead of his move into Group Two company here.\nAscot 3.35: The eye-catcher in a tight race is Best Lightning, the 20-1 outsider, a smooth Group Two winner in Germany last time and only the second horse that former Group One-winning jockey Andreas Suborics has sent to Britain since turning to training in 2016.\nNewmarket 3.50: Samburu lost little in defeat in the Group Three Jersey Stakes last time when he perhaps made his effort a little earlier than ideal, and he remains well-weighted judged on his handicap debut win at York in May.\nYork 4.05: Intellogent has been another fine advertisement for Jane Chapple-Hyam\u2019s stable in three runs since arriving from France and his Royal Ascot form makes him a big player at around 9-1.\nYork 4.40: The return to York\u2019s five-furlong track could see Winter Power rediscover something close to her best form but after four straight subpar performances, she is an unappealing favourite. Three-year-old Royal Aclaim has something to find on the ratings but more than enough scope to do so after two easy wins so far.\nInspiral not so Prosperous\nJohn Gosden\u2019s renewed relationship with Frankie Dettori suffered its first significant setback at Newmarket on Friday as Inspiral, the Coronation Stakes winner at Royal Ascot, lost her unbeaten record behind Prosperous Voyage in the Group One Falmouth Stakes.\nInspiral was sent off at 1-7 but Gosden suggested afterwards that he was not happy with the way she was travelling from an early stage as Prosperous Voyage, at 16-1, made much of the running to beat Inspiral by nearly two lengths.\n\u201cNormally you wouldn\u2019t go from a huge performance at Ascot and come here but having run only the once [this season] it made sense,\u201d Gosden said. \u201cBut she\u2019s just run a little flat and that can happen when you go to Royal Ascot and the July meeting, particularly when you\u2019ve been off since the previous October. You could tell early on, little bit flat and the ground probably quick enough. We\u2019ll freshen up and go again.\u201d\n\nProsperous Voyage was only 10th behind Inspiral at Royal Ascot but Ralph Beckett, her trainer, believes a straight track helped her to reverse the form. \u201cMaybe Inspiral didn\u2019t turn up today, maybe she bounced but this filly ran her race and that is all that really matters if you are me,\u201d Beckett said. \u201cI think the key to her really is a straight track. The Sun Chariot [at Newmarket in October] is the obvious race for her. We will keep bringing her back to Newmarket.\u201d\nInspiral is the joint shortest-priced beaten favourite in a Group One Flat race in Britain or Ireland since Order Of St George failed to justify odds of 1-7 in the Irish St Leger in 2016. The last horse beaten at a shorter price in any British race was Last Hoorah, at 1-10, in a three-runner juvenile contest at Chepstow in August 2021. "

                    "body": "May really is the cruellest month. For Liverpool Football Club and J\u00fcrgen Klopp there is something brutal, and even darkly comic, in the current run of finals and final days, those razor-thin margins at the end of a glorious, gruelling year.\nLiverpool have played 62 games this season and lost only three. They have one left now, a bravura Champions League final against Real Madrid in Saint-Denis on Saturday night, a fixture that has already been relocated twice, shunted around on a kind of Bourne-franchise tour of Uefa-zone glamour spots, through Munich, St Petersburg and finally on to Paris.\n\nAnd while it might seem absurd, facile and just plain wrong to say the season will be decided by victory or defeat at the Stade de France, that nine months of something close to sporting perfection, already two trophies deep, will be cast as success or failure by a one-off game; well, it is also probably true.\nThis is the beauty and also the viciousness of elite sport. It is also a mark of the extreme quality of this mature Klopp team. By any sensible measure Liverpool are already there. This team have won the Champions League. They have those deeper notes, the structures, the retreading of every surface of the club. And yet right now a final such as this, a genuine blue chip one\u2011off, may just be what Liverpool need.\nFor all the highs to this point there is still a sense of an entity yet to find its final form, to experience its own defining high. This is often just a matter of how fixtures fall. The Champions League final victory against Tottenham Hotspur was decisive, unarguable, magisterial; but also, at bottom, a Champions League final against Tottenham Hotspur. Winning the league by 18 points was a wonderful feat, but also an experience muddied by quarantine conditions.\nParis on Saturday is something else, at least in terms of its sweep. Here is an opportunity to show the world just how good this team are, in the most cinematic of one\u2011offs. Great teams do tend to have these moments, from Milan\u2019s evisceration of Barcelona at the peak of the Sacchi-into-Capello years, to Manchester United\u2019s paroxysms against Bayern Munich, to Pep-era Barcelona\u2019s cruel perfection at Wembley in 2011.\n\nThis is more than simply theatre. For Klopp there is a more immediate tactical note to the prospect of facing opponents of this quality. Liverpool are narrow favourites. At their best they are a more coherent, relentless, powerful team. With some early wind at their backs there is a chance they could run through Madrid.\nBut there is also a note of warning here. Liverpool\u2019s recent record against the better teams is their one headline weakness. Why didn\u2019t they win the league this season? The most obvious answer is that in six games against the other members of the top four they mustered six draws and no clean sheets. They beat a diluted Manchester City 3-2 in the FA Cup. The last time Liverpool beat a recent Champions League winner, other than on penalties, was the 2-0 against Chelsea in September 2020.\n\nIn the past two months Madrid have beaten Chelsea and City. They also beat Liverpool last year, although it is in the details of that game that a key to Saturday may lie.\nFinals tend to be won in midfield. These are often games that go deep, that test the ability to hold the ball, to assert your own rhythms under pressure. It is here that Madrid have held their advantage in this competition. Modric-Kroos-Casemiro is an era all in itself, footballers of such quality, such intelligence, such big-game chops that they can find ways to win, can spend half an hour being outrun but still know that their own moments will come.\n\nToni Kroos, in particular, looks exhausted from pretty much the first minute these days, a footballer who seems to be running through wet sand, but who knows he still has the capacity to affect a game at this level.\nIt is Madrid\u2019s midfield that has had the edge over Liverpool. Luka Modric and Kroos seemed to be playing through lighter air in the opening hour at the Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano stadium last season, dominating possession and finding time to lace passes into that red zone behind the full-backs. That gap was more pronounced in the 2018 final, when Kroos had 99 touches, Modric 90 and a Liverpool midfield of Gini Wijnaldum, James Milner and Jordan Henderson, who appears to be Modric\u2019s favourite footballer, spent the night chasing.\n\nThere are several reasons to suspect this can now be reversed. First, Madrid\u2019s grandees are all older. Kroos may not play if Carlo Ancelotti prefers the high-energy presence of the excellent Eduardo Camavinga. Second, Liverpool may just get Thiago Alc\u00e2ntara back for Saturday, their only central midfielder with the class to go toe\u2011to-toe with these kings of tempo and touch. His presence \u2013 and it is in serious doubt \u2013 would be a massive step up.\nThird, the team Liverpool put out last year had Ozan Kabak and Nat Phillips in defence, a dilution in quality that affects every aspect of their play.\nMuch is made of Liverpool\u2019s high defensive line, the way the fearlessnesses of their central defenders in holding that position allows Klopp to condense play, to make the press into an act of suffocation. Madrid will have to cope with that pressure. And it is in that middle third that the game could well be won and lost.\n\nThe most notable element of Liverpool\u2019s struggles against the better teams is the way their opponents have attacked the space behind their full-backs with quick passes from central midfield. The direct confrontation between Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior and Trent Alexander-Arnold is the most obvious point of pressure here.\nBoth players will look to find an edge on that flank. The space Alexander-Arnold leaves, deliberately \u2013 this is a tactic \u2013 by pushing on as an attacking playmaker is only really a source of alarm when the midfield is unable to take control, to prevent a player such as Kroos from having the space to find his range. Klopp has a choice: push his right-back into his usual advanced spaces, trust the process and the cover; or sit deeper, aware that Vin\u00edcius and Karim Benzema provide Madrid\u2019s most obvious razor edge. Either way, so much of this springs from how the centre holds.\n\nThere are other points of interest. Madrid have played one meaningful game in the past four weeks, the home win against City. Since then Benzema and Modric have played less than 180 minutes. Liverpool are if anything overextended, frazzled by their run of final things and moments of crisis.\nIt is unlikely to matter much. It has been pointed out that there is no second leg here, that Real\u2019s progress has been dependant on dragging their way back into these ties. But a final like this is the ultimate second leg. This is overtime, the endgame, the moment when you\u2019re left pinned and wriggling on the wall, every choice, every doubt, every note of weakness played out in the brightest of glares.\nLiverpool have shot at a kind of ultimacy in Paris. For Madrid this is their zone of comfort, the place they have been trying to get to all season. The only question now is: who blinks in that light?"

                    "body": "Daniel Su\u00e1rez became the first Mexican-born driver to win a Nascar Cup Series race Sunday, holding off Chris Buescher for a historic victory at Sonoma Raceway. Su\u00e1rez, a 30-year-old native of Monterrey, finally won in the 195th career start of a Cup Series career that began in 2017. He also drove his Trackhouse Racing Chevrolet to the third Cup Series victory of the season for this rising two-year-old team co-owned by former driver Justin Marks and music star Pitbull.  Su\u00e1rez got past Buescher and took charge early in the final stage on this hilly road course in Northern California wine country, and he persevered through a pit stop and a caution to emerge in front with 23 laps to go. Buescher pushed him aggressively, but Su\u00e1rez made no significant mistakes while rolling to victory. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy,\u201d Su\u00e1rez said. \u201cI have so many thoughts in my head right now. It\u2019s been a rough journey in the Cup Series, and these guys believed in me. I have a lot of people to thank in Mexico. My family, they never gave up on me. A lot of people did, but they didn\u2019t. I\u2019m just happy we were able to make it work.\u201d Su\u00e1rez\u2019s team partied wildly when it was over, even pulling out a celebratory pi\u00f1ata shaped like a taco. The pi\u00f1ata was requested by Su\u00e1rez for whenever he got his first win and clinched a spot in the playoffs \u2014 and he celebrated by punching a hole through it with his fist. \u201cThey believed in me since Day One,\u201d Su\u00e1rez said of his team. \u201c(We\u2019ve got) all the people, all the resources to make it happen.\u201d Su\u00e1rez then addressed his fans briefly in Spanish, saying: \u201cThis is the first one of many.\u201d  Buescher\u2019s second-place finish was also a season best in his RFK Racing Ford. He fell just short of his second career victory. \u201cHurts to be that close, but congratulations to Su\u00e1rez,\u201d Buescher said. \u201cWe were trying, trying to get him. Ran out of steam there.\u201d Su\u00e1rez, who won the Xfinity Series championship in 2016, is the fifth foreign-born driver to win a Cup Series race. He joins Colombia\u2019s Juan Pablo Montoya, Australia\u2019s Marcos Ambrose, Canada\u2019s Earl Ross and Italian-born American Mario Andretti. The success of Su\u00e1rez and Trackhouse Racing could be a welcome boost to a sport eager to expand its cultural footprint. After moving to the U.S. 11 years ago with a desire to race on bigger stages, Su\u00e1rez is a major success story for NASCAR\u2019s Drive for Diversity program, which aims to bring new perspectives and backgrounds to a largely monocultural organization for much of its history. Michael McDowell finished a season-best third in front of Kevin Harvick in cloudy conditions in Sonoma Raceway\u2019s first Cup Series race at full capacity since before the coronavirus pandemic. The crowd included about 350 rowdy fans from Su\u00e1rez\u2019s program, Daniel\u2019s Amigos, which allows kids in several NASCAR cities to attend races. Austin Cindric was fifth in the final race before the Cup Series\u2019 one-week midseason break."

                    "body": "In Germany, they call it \u201cDay X\u201d. Businesses up and down the land are making contingency plans for what is seen as a growing likelihood that Russian gas will stop flowing into Europe\u2019s biggest economy. \u201cIt would be a disaster \u2013 one which would have seemed almost unthinkable just two months ago, but which right now feels like a very realistic prospect,\u201d the owner of a hi-tech mechanical engineering company in western Germany said. The firm produces everything from battery cases for electric cars to train clutch systems.  The speaker did not want to be named, or for his company to be identified, in part for fear, he said, of appearing to support Russia\u2019s war by making the case that if the gas is turned off, his century-old business \u201cwill likely not survive\u201d. But he says he is in a deep quandary and feeling very vulnerable, as he is not only heavily reliant on gas \u2013 the cost of which has already soared \u2013 but also on metals such as nickel and aluminium, much of which comes from Russia. Germany gets around 50bn cubic metres a year or 55% of its gas from Russia, the largest by volume of any EU country, and by extension, the biggest share of any large European economy. Two possible, not unlikely scenarios are being mooted: one envisages Moscow deciding to cut off or reduce supplies in retaliation for sanctions; the other sees Germany giving in to mounting pressure to support an EU energy embargo according to which the recipients would effectively call Putin\u2019s bluff by cutting themselves off from Russian supplies. On Friday at the Brandenburg Gate, protesters in favour of an oil and gas embargo made their point for the moral argument, with 410 red lights commemorating the victims of Russian army killings in the town of Bucha, alongside slogans asking German chancellor Olaf Scholz: \u201cIf not now, when?\u201d Their message is stark. As long as German industry keeps taking the energy \u2013 for which it pays Moscow \u20ac200m (\u00a3167m) every day \u2013 it is helping fund the atrocities. But industry bosses and political leaders have warned that the damage to Germany by turning off the taps would be far greater than any benefit it brings to Ukraine. \u201cWhat use to anybody is a weakened Germany?\u201d a source close to the government told the Guardian this week.  Millions of private homes without heat is just one part of the picture. The other, arguably bigger concern, are the manufacturing giants, dependent on gas to operate, such as Thyssenkrupp, BASF and Bayer. And the hundreds of thousands of small and medium sized businesses with which they are interlinked. Industry representatives have warned that the effects would be felt in every product from construction material, synthetics, pesticides, disinfectant, packaging and semiconductors to the production of antibiotics, coronavirus vaccines and cancer drugs. The chain reaction is difficult to predict but likely to be considerable. Robert Habeck, the economics minister, has urged Germans to \u201cturn down the thermostat\u201d \u2013 saying that \u201cevery kilowatt hour that Germany saves harms Putin\u201d \u2013 what some have cynically dubbed \u201cfreezing for Ukraine\u201d. Industry too is being urged to scale back its use. Some have done so already, forced by the high energy costs. Others, such as the porcelain manufacturer KPM, founded in 1763, are working overtime to produce as many goods as possible before the taps are turned off. \u201cWho knows for how long we will have gas?\u201d its CEO, Martina Hacker, told Der Spiegel. \u201cWe can\u2019t produce porcelain without it.\u201d  Other companies have reduced production to a minimum. But industries such as glass manufacturers say shutting down production facilities altogether is not an option as it would cause liquids to set and destroy the machines. The country\u2019s 45 gas storage facilities are only about 26% full. The plan is to increase levels to 80% by the autumn, largely by saving energy now, in order to safeguard supplies for next winter. Habeck triggered the first part of a three-point emergency plan last week that anticipates a slow-down or halt of gas and decides where supplies would go. Hospitals, emergency services and medical manufacturers would be prioritised, followed by private households. Industries, which use a quarter of the gas delivered to Germany would be the first expected to shut down, according to the plan. Which is why businesses are being asked to put forward their arguments as to how \u201csystem relevant\u201d they are. Law firms have been flooded with queries from companies wanting to know their legal standing, while industrial associations report being inundated with queries by members asking where they rank in the pecking order and how they should react to the uncertainty. One representative said: \u201cWe have glass manufacturers saying they are system relevant because they provide the medical industry with glass vials, paper manufacturers, arguing that their corrugated cardboard is vital for the safe transport of the vials. How do you possibly argue against them?\u201d The Federal Network Agency, which ensures fair access to gas, electricity and other vital services, has sent a questionnaire to all German businesses, asking them to effectively set out their individual arguments for a right to gas. \u201cThe question of prioritisation is a very difficult decision, requiring consideration of a wide range of consequences,\u201d said a spokesperson for the economics ministry. Some predict an ugly battle over who deserves the energy most. There are doomsday visions of supply chains \u2013 already under pressure due to the pandemic \u2013 collapsing altogether, businesses forced into bankruptcy, mass unemployment. J\u00f6rg Hoffmann, the head of IG Metall, a union that represents 1.2 million workers in the chemical, metal processing and food production, has warned of \u201ca recession deeper than any of the recessions we have known until now.\u201d BASF, the chemical giant, and one of Germany\u2019s biggest single purchasers and consumers of energy, said the effect of its production downturn would soon be felt.  \u201cWe would get very high unemployment, many firms would go bust,\u201d the BASF chairman, Martin Bruderm\u00fcller, has said. \u201cIt would lead to irreversible damage. To put it bluntly: it could lead Germany into its most serious crisis since the end of the second world war, and destroy our prosperity.\u201d A race against time is on to find alternative gas source supplies from the Netherlands and Norway and increase liquid natural gas (LNG) supplies from Belgian terminals and the US. Habeck has been to Qatar to secure further shipments and has ordered the construction of LNG carriers to float in German ports rather than wait for the construction of proposed new LNG terminals, which will take too long. The abolition of coal-fired plants \u2013 seen as a central part of the climate emergency plan \u2013 may yet be delayed.  The pressure is on to scale up and speed up renewable projects in wind and solar. Companies such as the pharmacy giant Merck are making their own plans to build wind turbines and solar energy panels to increase their independence \u2013 if only to be able to heat their offices. But it is a gargantuan effort that will probably take years and in the meantime Germany is left looking extremely vulnerable.  Some companies are even contemplating moving their production facilities abroad, predicting that operating in Germany will become prohibitively expensive and triggering fears Europe\u2019s economic motor is in danger of losing its competitive edge. While Habeck believes Germany is in a position to wean itself off Russian gas in around two years\u2019 time, Bruderm\u00fcller believes four to five years is more realistic. Some experts say by the end of the decade is more likely."

After the opening of 27 shops this year it now employs 8,700 people in the UK, while across all of its operations it employs 11,500. The chief executive, Pano Christou, said the company \u201cgrew fastest in some of the places where we only had a handful of Pret shops before\u201d. Pret\u2019s sales slumped during the pandemic as workers were forced to stay out of town and city centres by lockdowns. It made a loss of \u00a3226m for 2021, after a \u00a3343m loss in 2020. The chain\u2019s reliance on city foot traffic was underlined once more by recent rail strikes, with trading in its City of London and Canary Wharf outlets falling to 62% of pre-Covid levels in the week the strikes began. Christou on Monday called for unions and train companies to agree a deal to avoid further rail strikes, saying it caused a \u201chuge\u201d hit to trade. \u201cIt was a huge negative impact on business for sure,\u201d Christou told PA Media. \u201cEven the days in between were a lot quieter because services didn\u2019t fully recover.\u201d  However, the company, which opened in 1986, has bet that consumers will return to convenience food en masse after the end of pandemic restrictions in its major markets. It plans to double the size of the business within the next five years, including through international expansions such as a launch in India announced last week. The Indian outlets will be run by Reliance Industries, the fossil fuel and retail conglomerate owned by the billionaire Mukesh Ambani.  During the pandemic, Pret has been forced to call on \u00a3200m of financial support from shareholders including JAB Holding Company, a Luxembourg investment vehicle for Germany\u2019s billionaire Reimann family who also own brands ranging from Dr Pepper drinks and Krispy Kreme doughnuts to perfume from Calvin Klein and Burberry. Since September, Pret has signed deals to open shops in Canada, Ireland, Spain and Portugal, in addition to the India deal. As well as expanding geographically, Pret has been pushing into digital sales, including a coffee subscription that can be bought online. There are now more than a million subscribers a week, up from 667,000 in 2021, Pret said. Christou also pledged further international growth, saying: \u201cThe opportunity now is for us to take that growth and apply it internationally.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 9 August 2022. Pret originally said it had 442 shops; the correct number is 424."

                    "body": "Good morning. In the early hours of this morning, Elon Musk tweeted, \u201cthe bird is freed\u201d. It appears to be a zany \u2013 and very Musky \u2013 way to announce to users of the site that he has completed his $44bn takeover of Twitter. If so, this was not a happy or easy acquisition: there have been U-turns and lawsuits, with Twitter taking Musk to court in the summer for allegedly reneging on his contract. Today was supposed to be deadline day. By 5pm New York time (10pm here in London), Musk either had to complete the deal or face an arduous legal battle. He chose the former, with a little time to spare. And it looks as though Musk has wasted no time in getting started, with reports that several senior executives have already been fired, including CEO Parag Agrawal. A new era has begun. Musk claims that he is doing this for the greater good: \u201cThe reason I acquired Twitter is because it is important to the future of civilisation to have a common digital town square,\u201d he wrote in a social media post. He claims he didn\u2019t do this to make money but \u201c[to] help humanity, whom I love.\u201d How noble. But like billionaires before him who have bought sports teams and newspapers, Musk\u2019s decision to set his sights on Twitter may also be seen as a way to acquire soft power and to have a new toy to play with. For today\u2019s newsletter, I spoke to the Guardian\u2019s UK technology editor, Alex Hern, about how we got here, and what Twitter under a Musk ownership will mean for the future of social media. Five big stories  Climate | The UN\u2019s environment agency has said that there\u2019s no credible pathway to limiting global warming to 1.5C because progress to reduce carbon emissions has been \u201cwoefully inadequate\u201d. In a report, it stated that the only way to limit the worst impacts of the climate crisis is a \u201crapid transformation of societies\u201d. Politics | Civil service chief, Simon Case, is understood not to be launching an investigation into Suella Braverman\u2019s reappointment as home secretary and the circumstances around her original departure. Scotland | Scotland\u2019s community safety minister, Ash Regan, has resigned in order to vote against a new law that aims to streamline how transgender people can change their legal sex. Nicola Sturgeon has accused Regan of failing to raise any of her concerns with her colleagues. Northern Ireland | Northern Ireland is on course for a snap election after a recall of the Stormont assembly failed to break political deadlock and elect a speaker. The DUP said it would boycott Stormont unless unionist objections to the post-Brexit Irish Sea border were resolved. London | British Transport Police are hunting a man who assaulted one person at a tube station and then pushed another on to the tracks at a different stop. Police do not believe that any parties involved were known to each other and neither victim sustained serious injuries.  In depth: \u2018The old guard is falling apart\u2019  Twitter has often been described as a hellscape. If Elon Musk\u2019s leadership means that the app gets worse and becomes unusable it might actually be a good thing for my screen time and mental health. Not everything\u2019s about me, though \u2013 and the wider political, social and cultural implications of this takeover have alarmed many people. So what will the next chapter of Twitter look like? *** The long saga This whole affair began in March, when Musk decided being addicted to Twitter wasn\u2019t enough \u2013 he wanted in on the company. However, buying a company of that size isn\u2019t an easy task so, instead, Musk decided to do things quietly. On 14 March, without the knowledge of Twitter, he acquired a 9.2% stake in the company. Two weeks later, in an SEC filing, it was made public that Musk was Twitter\u2019s largest shareholder (he tweeted \u201cOh hi lol\u201d). It wasn\u2019t long before Musk was offered a seat on the board. He accepted, and then less a week later backed out. This decision fuelled rumours that a hostile takeover was afoot. Three days later, that suspicion was confirmed when Musk made a hostile bid for Twitter with an offer that valued the company at $43.4bn, $54.20 a share, a figure that he obviously came to after a lot of careful consideration. \u201cThe price that he offered was a weed joke \u2013 the 420 weed joke [420 is slang for marijuana] in there is not a coincidence and it\u2019s not the first time he\u2019s done it. He also offered to take Tesla private at $420 a share. He loves throwing the numbers 420 and 69 in important financial things,\u201d Alex says. This very cool offer meant that Musk would be paying a premium on the share price. Twitter eventually accepted \u2013 meaning that, while there were hostile overtones, this was not legally a hostile takeover in the end. \u201cTwitter effectively said, we have a fiduciary duty to our shareholders to take this offer that is well above our current stock price, so \u2026 fine,\u201d Alex says. Within a month of announcing to the world that he would buy Twitter, Musk tried to pull the plug on the deal, because, according to him, the company\u2019s fake account problem was worse than he\u2019d been told. Musk decided that this purported omission had led to him overvaluing the company and it was no longer a financially viable endeavour until Twitter sorted the issue out. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t pass the smell test though,\u201d Alex says. \u201cThe fake account problem was why he said he was buying Twitter in the first place, he wanted to fix it.\u201d Perhaps a more plausible explanation is that \u2013 following a global market crash and a devaluation of Twitter \u2013 Musk was paying a higher premium and with it his personal wealth was taking a hit. A deal that was probably never going to be lucrative all of a sudden looked like it would be a significant drain and that wasn\u2019t worth it \u2013 even for the world\u2019s richest man.  *** What happens now? After countless U-turns, Musk may have figured, what\u2019s one more? Earlier this month, he sent a letter to Twitter saying that the original deal is still on \u2013 owning Twitter would be the start of his journey to creating an \u201ceverything app\u201d. And, for once in this whole ordeal, he\u2019s followed through. For many, a world where Elon Musk owns Twitter is just about the worst thing that could happen for the site. But Alex has said that all is not necessarily lost. For a long time Twitter has struggled to turn its political and social relevance into profit. Going private could relieve the company of many of these pressures. \u201cThere\u2019s a positive future in which we have someone running Twitter who is rich enough to not need it to make that much money and as such can focus on running it as a social company with the social importance that it has,\u201d Alex says. However, Elon Musk\u2019s idea of what is good for society doesn\u2019t necessarily line up with what most people believe. On the one hand, Musk\u2019s dreams of creating an all-encompassing super-app like China\u2019s WeChat seems far-fetched. He can, however, have a significant impact in other ways. One of the biggest gripes Musk has with Twitter is that he believes the site is over-moderated, an opinion that is not widely shared \u2013 and he has already signaled that he will reverse a permanent ban on Donald Trump. In fact, the company is often under fire for not doing enough when it comes to keeping users safe from harassment and taking down inappropriate, offensive or illegal content. It\u2019s not inevitable that Twitter will return to its wild west days where anyone could post what they wanted. The chance that Musk will be working the moderation desks himself, or trying to rip up the rulebook without opposition is relatively low. The issue with Musk is and has always been the fact that no one can tell how wedded he is to any of these ideas. His commitment to \u201cshitposting\u201d (I\u2019m not being unnecessarily crude, it\u2019s a real phenomenon where users intentionally post provocative or off-topic comments on social media), has meant that no one will really know how far he will take his joke. The other big question is whether he will follow through on rumoured major cuts at the company. Earlier this month it was reported that Musk planned to eliminate nearly 75% of Twitter\u2019s staff in an effort to pay down the company\u2019s debt. However Musk later dismissed those reports, telling employees he would not cut such a large portion of the staff. At the very top, at least, he is certainly making changes. Reuters reported Parag Agrawal and finance chief Ned Segal were in Twitter\u2019s San Francisco headquarters when the deal closed and were escorted out. *** A decline? This bizarre legal dispute is perhaps an indicator of where social media more broadly is headed (\u201cThe old guard is falling apart,\u201d Alex says). Following reports that Meta\u2019s profits halved during the third quarter of the year, investors wiped more than $65bn (\u00a356bn) off its market value on Wednesday, all while Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s company haemorrhages $15bn a year on building Metaverse technology and its ads business shrinks. Meanwhile, Twitter\u2019s value has been falling for a couple of years. As apps like TikTok and BeReal grow in terms of cultural clout, and the financial and social power of the old tech giants begins to wane, the arrival of Elon Musk could be Twitter\u2019s final death knell \u2013 or an unexpected breath of fresh air. What else we\u2019ve been reading   \u201cThe site has no running water, flushing toilet or wifi, but forgoing these basic facilities seems like a fair trade, to me at least\u201d: a fascinating read from conservation biologist Mairi Hilton, who will spend five months working in Antarctica for the UK Antarctic Heritage Trust.

                    "body": "Two British men who spent time in detention in the United Arab Emirates have testified in Paris that an Emirati security official who is now the president of Interpol was responsible for their alleged torture. Matthew Hedges, an academic imprisoned in the UAE for seven months on espionage charges he denies, and Ali Issa Ahmad, who was detained in Dubai for wearing a Qatar football shirt, testified before the investigating judge of the specialised judicial unit for crimes against humanity and war crimes of the Paris tribunal. The pair allege that Maj Gen Ahmed Naser al-Raisi was personally responsible for the torture to which they were subjected while in detention. \u201cI told the judge about all the terrible things that happened to me when I was arrested in the UAE, about being cut on my body, punched by police officers, and all the other torture I suffered. This includes why I believe that al-Raisi is to blame, as he was the chief of the police and the prison service and so there was no way he didn\u2019t know what was happening to me,\u201d Ahmad told the Guardian after giving testimony. The UAE interior ministry denied the accusations against al-Raisi. \u201cThe claims made against Dr Al Raisi are without merit. He and the UAE categorically reject the utterly baseless and unfounded accusations being made against him by these complainants,\u201d a spokesperson said. The former detainees\u2019 testimony represents a step forward in an ongoing investigation into Raisi\u2019s conduct prior to his election as Interpol president, and an unusual consequence of his assuming the presidency. While lawyers for Hedges and Ahmad have filed charges against him in the UK, Sweden, Norway, Turkey and France, it was only because Raisi is now required to regularly visit the Interpol headquarters in Lyon and therefore set foot on French soil that judges in Paris could proceed to investigate the charges against him. \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t have been elected into position, but it means as a result that he\u2019s now subject to investigation and potentially prosecution,\u201d said Rodney Dixon QC, who represents Hedges and Ahmad. \u201cWhat will be important is when al-Raisi is due to return to Lyon, because when that happens we then have to assess where the investigation is at that point and whether steps will be taken to question him.\u201d Hedges described the experience of testifying about his treatment in the UAE as \u201cempowering\u201d. \u201cIt feels significant and impactful to be testifying in France,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m happy to have testified here as al-Raisi is required to travel to France as the president of Interpol, which gives me more hope. I also hope that there will be enough evidence to advance criminal proceedings against him, which would add further weight to the questions asked about him becoming president of Interpol in the first place.\u201d  Observers claim Raisi does not benefit from immunity in his position as Interpol president, leaving him open to police questioning, an unusual event that would be expected to embarrass the institution. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t enjoy immunity under French law, and the fact this investigation has begun is testament to that,\u201d Dixon said. Prosecutors in Paris have been approached for comment. An Interpol spokesperson said the allegations related to \u201can issue between the parties involved, and given this is an ongoing matter it would be premature for Interpol to comment\u201d. Interpol is a supranational policing organisation that focuses primarily on information sharing between member states. The organisation has drawn criticism for the increasing role played by anti-democratic regimes, notably their abuse of Interpol\u2019s red notice system to flag political exiles rather than criminals. The complaint against Raisi, alongside a second complaint in Paris filed by the Gulf Centre for Human Rights over Raisi\u2019s alleged role in the detention and torture of an Emirati rights activist, Ahmed Mansoor, was filed under the principle of universal jurisdiction for grievous crimes. In recent years the same principle has been used in German courts to convict former Syrian intelligence officers of crimes against humanity for the murder and torture of detainees in a Damascus detention facility. The same Paris court that heard Hedges\u2019 and Ahmad\u2019s testimonies began the trial of a senior civil servant from Rwanda this week, accusing him of complicity in the 1994 genocide. \u201cI think we\u2019ll see more of these cases that show how clearly European governments, including France, are keen on their autocratic counterparts either for security cooperation or business deals, while in parallel seeing judicial activism to go after people for human rights violations, war crimes and torture,\u201d said Nadim Houry, the head of the Arab Reform Initiative, a Paris thinktank. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that no one sufficiently cared about these allegations before they voted in al-Raisi as head of Interpol,\u201d he added. \u201cIf these allegations are proven in a court of law, what does this say about Interpol?\u201d France has enjoyed unusually strong relations with the UAE under the presidency of Emmanuel Macron, including deep political and military ties. Last December Paris agreed to sell to the UAE 80 upgraded Rafale fighter jets and 12 combat helicopters worth \u00a313.64bn, the largest ever French weapons sale for export.  Jalel Harchaoui, a Paris-based analyst of Emirati-French relations, said: \u201cThe \u00c9lys\u00e9e under Macron has really considered tight friendship with Abu Dhabi as sacrosanct.\u201d  He said the possible questioning of Raisi during his next visit to France appeared unlikely to shake relations between the two nations. \u201cThe relationship is a direct dialogue between Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed and Emmanuel Macron. So while Abu Dhabi maybe considers it unfortunate that western liberal democracies have an independent justice system, that\u2019s also part of the cost of doing business.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 13 May 2022 to include a comment from the UAE that was received after publication."

Liz Truss quit as PM yesterday after just six weeks in office following her mini-budget debacle. \nThe pound has pared losses versus the dollar, and is now down 0.6% against both the dollar and the euro, at $1.1168 and \u20ac1.1404.\nThe FTSE 100 index has turned positive and is trading 17 points higher at 6,962, a gain of 0.25%. Germany\u2019s Dax is nearly 1% lower, while the French and Italian markets have fallen 1.5% and 0.6% respectively.\nThey pared some losses after Wall Street turned positive.\nCrude oil prices are pushing higher, with both Brent crude and US light crude up more than 1%, at $93.52 a barrel and $85.48 a barrel respectively.\nUK government bond prices have fallen, pushing their yields (or interest rates) higher again, although they remain well below the 5% hit after the mini-budget. The 30-year yield has risen to 4.01% while the 20-year is yielding 4.2%.\nOur main news today:\nJeremy Hunt, the UK chancellor, said he would do \u201cwhatever necessary\u201d to bring down national debt as the latest official figures showed government borrowing jumped in September and debt interest payments hit a record high.\n\nRetail sales in Great Britain fell more steeply than expected in September as soaring prices prompted consumers to rein in spending and many stores lost trading on the day of the Queen\u2019s funeral.\nThe Office for National Statistics said retail sales dropped by 1.4% in September, against a forecast of a 0.5% fall by City economists, and marks the first month that volumes have fallen below pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThe number of homes sold in the UK in September fell by nearly 40% as transaction levels returned to normal following the big spike caused by the Covid stamp duty holiday, with experts suggesting the real \u201chouse sales horror story\u201d is still to come.\n\nThe chaos affecting international air travel in the summer has been firmly stowed away, according to UK aviation firms, with a smooth getaway expected in the busiest weekend before Christmas.\n\nThe City watchdog could fine Barclays up to \u00a350m for failing to disclose a deal struck with Qatar at the height of the financial crisis, reviving a controversial episode that failed to gain traction in UK courts.\nThe provisional fine \u2013 which Barclays is in the process of appealing against \u2013 relates to the \u00a3322m the bank paid to Qatar in 2008, allegedly in exchange for the gas-rich Gulf state investing \u00a34bn, helping save the lender from a UK government bailout.\n\nOther stories:\n\n\n\n\nUpdated at 3.19pm BST\n\n\n 2.49pm  \n\nWall Street opened slightly lower, but the Nasdaq didn\u2019t fall as much as feared after disappointing results from Snap. It has slipped 0.4%, while the Dow Jones is now up 0.6% and the S&amp;P 500 has gained 0.5%.\n\n\n\n 2.44pm  \n\nThe UK\u2019s new prime minister will decide whether to proceed with a fiscal plan scheduled for 31 October, a Downing Street spokeswoman said today.\n\nWe are working in preparation for the 31st. But obviously, the decision on proceeding with that, and with that timetable, would be for the new prime minister.\n\nThe public finances worsened more than expected last month, heaping more pressure on the new chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, ahead of the fiscal plan. He said he would do \u201cwhatever necessary\u201d to get national debt down.\n\n\n\n 1.54pm  \nFutures point to lower Wall Street open after Snap warning\n\nStock market futures are pointing to a lower open on Wall Street in just over half an hour, after Snap\u2019s forecast of flat revenues over the busy holiday quarter spooked the market.\nThe company behind the photo messaging app Snapchat lost more than a quarter of its market value after it posted its slowest quarterly revenue growth in five years because advertisers cut spending. Shares in other tech and social media companies such as Alphabet, Twitter, Facebook owner Meta and Pinterest also fell. They are all due to report quarterly results in the coming days.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq is expected to fall 1.2% at the open.\n\nUpdated at 1.56pm BST\n\n\n 1.32pm  \nLunchtime summary\n\nTime for a look at the markets.\nThe pound has lost 1.37% to $1.1080 amid heightened political uncertainty after Liz Truss quit as prime minister yesterday, while general dollar strength is another factor. Sterling is down 0.6% versus the euro at \u20ac1.1404.\nThe sell-off on European stock markets has gathered pace.\n\nUK\u2019s FTSE 100 down 79 points, or 1.1%, at 6,865\nGermany\u2019s Dax down 174 points, or 1.4% at 12,593\nFrance\u2019s CAC down 114 points, or 1.9, at 5,972\nItaly\u2019s FTSE MiB down 424 points, or 2%, at 21,277\n\nCrude oil prices have ventured into positive territory, with Brent crude up 28 cents at $92.65 a barrel.\nFinally, UK government bonds are selling off again, especially longer-dated ones, pushing up their yields \u2013 which means higher borrowing costs for the government. The 30-year bond yield has advanced 13 basis points to 4.03% while the 20-year bond is yielding 4.3%, up 15 bps. Two-year gilt yields have edged up to 3.8% while the 10-year is yielding 4.08%.\nOfficial figures showed today that government borrowing rose to \u00a320bn last month, the second-highest September figure on record. Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, pledged that he will do \u201cwhatever necessary\u201d to bring down the nation\u2019s debt, which has reached 98% as a share of GDP, the highest level since the 1960s.\n\n\nRetail sales in Britain fell more steeply than expected in September, by 1.4%, as soaring prices prompted consumers to rein in spending and many stores lost trading on the day of the Queen\u2019s funeral.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 1.41pm BST\n\n\n 12.21pm  \n\nHere\u2019s a round-up of today\u2019s other news.\nElon Musk told prospective investors that he plans to eliminate nearly 75% of Twitter\u2019s staff as part of his deal to take over the social media company, the Washington Post reported on Thursday.\nJob cuts are expected in the coming months no matter who owns the company, according to the report, which cited interviews and documents.\n\nTikTok has denied it is used to \u201ctarget\u201d US citizens following a report that its Chinese parent planned to track the location of people via the video-sharing app.\nA report by Forbes on Thursday claimed that, in at least two cases, a China-based team at ByteDance, the platform\u2019s owner, planned to collect TikTok data about the location of a US citizen.\n\nAverage private rents in Britain have soared to record highs, with severe shortages of properties resulting in more tenants paying above the asking price and stretched budgets forcing more people to downsize to studio flats, data shows.\nThe average advertised rent in Greater London is 16.1% higher than a year ago, which is the highest rate of growth of any region on record, according to the property website Rightmove.\nHowever, the site also revealed that some cities and towns have faced even bigger annual rises, piling yet more pressure on households already facing severe strain.\n\nThe DIY chain Wickes has said its energy costs could rise by \u00a37.5m next year and warned of growing uncertainty regarding consumer confidence.\nThe home improvement retailer said that total sales grew by 2.6% in the third quarter, strengthening in September after wilting during the heatwaves in July and August.\n\nZara is to help its UK shoppers resell, repair or donate clothing bought from the Spanish fashion chain in an effort to reduce its environmental impact.\nThe Pre-owned service, which launches on 3 November and will be Zara\u2019s first step into resale or repair, will enable shoppers to book repairs and donate unwanted items online or via a store, and post now-unwanted Zara purchases online for sale.\n\nA charter airline hired to remove people seeking refuge in the UK to Rwanda has pulled out of the scheme after pressure from campaigners.\nA plane operated by Privilege Style first attempted to fly asylum seekers to the east African country in June but was grounded by an 11th hour ruling by the European court of human rights.\n\nFrom Trump to Kanye and Musk: why are the super-rich buying social media sites?\n\nAlmost 100m highly polluting cars could appear on Europe\u2019s roads over the next decade after the European Commission moved to disown its own experts efficiency recommendations in a leaked proposal seen by the Guardian.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.22pm BST\n\n\n 11.21am  \n\nHere\u2019s our full story on the sharp drop in British retail sales:\nRetail sales in Great Britain fell more steeply than expected in September as soaring prices prompted consumers to rein in spending and many stores lost trading on the day of the Queen\u2019s funeral.\nThe Office for National Statistics said retail sales dropped by 1.4% in September, against a forecast of a 0.5% fall by City economists, and marks the first month that volumes have fallen below pre-pandemic levels.\nAccording to the latest figures, food store sales fell 1.8% as increasingly budget-conscious consumers cut spending amid concerns over price rises and the cost of living. The figures come as households across the country come under pressure from inflation hitting its highest level for 40 years on the back of soaring food prices.\n\u201cThis is a disappointing but unsurprising latest instalment in the saga of the cost of living crisis,\u201d said Sophie Lund-Yates, the lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. \u201cFood sales were especially affected, as customers make do without extra trolley treats or more expensive dining habits.\u201d\nSpending on bigger ticket items continued to fall, with household goods stores, such as furniture retailers, recording a 1.5% decline in sales volumes in September. Other non-food stores, such as jewellery retailers, reported a 0.7% fall in sales in September, while there was a 0.6% drop in sales for department stores.\n\n\n\n\n 11.03am  \n\nAs the cost of living crisis worsens, here\u2019s a handy guide to how to help food banks.\nGive basics (and tin openers), food that doesn\u2019t need cooking and add some snacks. Here\u2019s what charities need to meet the demand for emergency food parcels, writes the Guardian\u2019s feature writer Emine Saner.\n\nMatthew Upton, director of policy at Citizens Advice, has tweeted:\n\n\n\n\n 10.52am  \nUK housing transactions drop 32% in September, even before mortgage chaos\n\nThere was a sizeable fall in UK housing transactions last month, in further evidence that the housing market is slowing.\nUK residential transactions fell 32% to 112,370 in September year-on-year, according to HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) figures. The number was unchanged from August.\nHMRC cautioned that the recent sharp rises in mortgage rates, following Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng\u2019s disastrous mini-budget of unfunded tax cuts on 23 September, which was largely reversed on Monday, have not fed through to the figures yet.\n\nCurrent monthly transactions remain at levels similar to late 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic.\nRecent increases in mortgage rates are unlikely to have had any impact yet on these statistics, as the publication reports transactions that have completed at the end of the property purchasing process, which may be weeks or months after a mortgage offer is in place.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.58am BST\n\n\n 10.40am  \nChina's yuan falls to lowest since 2008 despite state bank support; sterling down 1%\n\nChina\u2019s yuan has fallen to its weakest level against the dollar since the global financial crisis of 2008, despite efforts by major state-owned banks to stabilise the market.\nThe yuan finished the domestic trading session 0.46% lower on the day at 7.2494 per dollar, the weakest closing price since mid-January, 2008.\nSources told Reuters that state banks sold dollars in the onshore currency market to prevent the spot price from weakening past the 7.25 per dollar level.\nThe dollar has generally strengthened today as US Federal Reserve officials show no signs of changing their aggressive stance on interest rate hikes. Sterling has dropped more than 1% versus the dollar to $1.1117, and is 0.5% lower against the euro at \u20ac1.1414, amid heightened political uncertainty.\n\nUpdated at 10.44am BST\n\n\n 9.55am  \n\nRuss Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says:\n\nGiven the unprecedented events involving British politics in recent weeks, investors are hoping for less volatility and more stability in both the government and on the markets.\nUK markets on Friday were calm as the nation sat tight, in anticipation of the third Prime Minister of the year being appointed at some point over the next week.\nEven though there is some sense of peace in the markets now, this could all change next week when we have a clearer idea of who is in the running for Number 10 and how each candidate might reshape the country\u2019s policies to avoid economic shocks.\n\nTurning to today\u2019s corporate results, Mould says:\n\n Heading up corporate news in the UK was Intercontinental Hotels. Its average rate per available room has shot up by 28% as demand returns to the travel sector. The thorn in its side is China where tough restrictions around Covid have disrupted trading once again, enough to spook investors and send the share price down 3%.\nSales growth has ground to a halt for DIY products seller Wickes. While the company seemingly takes a positive view, saying that sales have stabilised after weakness in previous quarters, the company still faces the fact that the DIY boom seen during the pandemic has lost momentum.\n\n\n\n\n 9.53am  \nGovernment bond yields rise again; German 10-year hits 11-year high\n\nCompared to the moves we\u2019ve seen in markets in recent days and weeks, an eerie calm has descended. The FTSE 100 index is down 0.7% at 6,892. Government borrowing costs fell sharply this week after Jeremy Hunt reversed almost all the unfunded tax cuts in the mini-budget that caused Liz Truss\u2019s downfall.\nThe yield, or interest rate, on the 30-year UK government bond (known as gilt) has fallen back from above 5% after the mini-budget. Following the worsening in the UK\u2019s public finances, bonds have sold off this morning, and the 30-year yield has risen again, to 4.065%, up 15 basis points. The 20-year yield has added 9 bps to 4.2%, while the 10-year yield has climbed 8 bps to 3.9% and the two-year yield increased to 3.68%.\nYields rise when bond prices fall, and increasing yields show that investors want a larger return for holding the debt.\nIn Germany, the 10-year bond yield hit a new 11-year peak today, driven up by concerns over rising interest rates, with the European Central Bank expected to hike borrowing costs again sharply next week. The 10-year Bund, as German government bonds are known, rose as high as 2.49%, the highest level since August 2011.\n\nUpdated at 10.18am BST\n\n\n 9.34am  \nPound slides on political uncertainty\n\nThe slide in sterling has accelerated, a day after Liz Truss quit as prime minister in a tumultuous week that saw her sack her chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng and appoint Jeremy Hunt instead. Hunt lost no time and on Monday ripped up the pair\u2019s mini-budget of unfunded tax cuts that sent the pound crashing and borrowing costs soaring.\nThe pound has dropped 0.76% to $1.1148 this morning, a one-week low.\nThe leadership race could see the return of Boris Johnson, who was forced to stand down as prime minister in July after a cabinet revolt, in what would be an extraordinary comeback. He and the former chancellor Rishi Sunak are leading in the Conservative party contest to become the fifth British premier in six years.\nSunak, a former Goldman Sachs analyst, is the bookies\u2019 favourite, followed by Johnson. In third place is Penny Mordaunt, a former defence secretary who is popular with the wider Conservative party.\nMore on our politics live blog.\n\n\nUpdated at 9.57am BST\n\n\n 9.23am  \n\nHere\u2019s our full story on government borrowing:\nJeremy Hunt said he would do \u201cwhatever necessary\u201d to bring down national debt as the latest official figures showed government borrowing jumped in September and debt interest payments hit a record high.\nThe chancellor said getting the public finances on a stable footing was essential, as government borrowing hit \u00a320bn in September, \u00a32.2bn more than last September, and \u00a33bn more than economists expected.\nHigher borrowing pushed debt interest payments to \u00a37.7bn last month, according to the Office for National Statistics, \u00a32.5bn more than in September 2021 and the highest September figure since monthly records began in April 1997.\n\n\n\n 9.21am  \n\nTruss remains prime minister until a successor has been found. Here\u2019s a video about the drama: Liz Truss, lettuce and a lectern: 25 hours of chaos in three minutes \n\nAnd our analysis of how Truss\u2019s mini-budget threw the country into chaos and led to her downfall, by our economics correspondent Richard Partington.\n\n\n\n\n 9.12am  \nLiz Truss ignored economists\u2019 stark warnings over mini-budget\n\nLiz Truss ignored stark warnings from economists sympathetic to her growth strategy that the mini-budget that ultimately led to her downfall risked triggering a financial markets meltdown, the Guardian has learned.\nTruss announced her resignation on Thursday after just 44 days in Downing Street, after a package of tax cuts and spending increases on 23 September rattled the markets, prompted a run on pension funds and sent the cost of mortgages spiralling.\nBut days before the start of her premiership, she was told by the economists Gerard Lyons and Julian Jessop that the markets were highly nervous and that she could face a crash if her policy changes were not handled with care.\nLyons and Jessop \u2013 who were supportive of Truss\u2019s growth agenda \u2013 prepared a paper for a meeting at Chevening, the country residence of the foreign secretary, as Truss was, two days before she was announced as Boris Johnson\u2019s successor on 5 September.\nAlso in attendance were Kwasi Kwarteng, who would be Truss\u2019s chancellor, Matthew Sinclair, Truss\u2019s economic policy adviser, and a third economist, Andrew Lilico.\nThe paper supported the idea that a new government needed to \u201chit the ground running\u201d but repeatedly stressed the need to keep the financial markets onside.\nPredicting the chaos that was to follow Kwarteng\u2019s \u00a345bn of unfunded tax cuts announced in his 23 September mini-budget, it said: \u201cThe markets are nervous about the UK and about policy options. If immediate economic policy announcements are handled badly then a market crash is possible.\u201d\n\n\n\n 9.08am  \nAlmost 8m people struggle with bills \u2013 City watchdog\n\nAlmost 8 million people in Britain are struggling to pay their bills, 2.5 million people more than in 2020, according to the financial watchdog.\nThe Financial Conduct Authority has published a snapshot of the latest edition of its Financial Lives survey, which was carried out between February and June 2022. It shows 7.8 million people were finding it hard to keep up with their bills (that number is likely to have gone up further since then).\nOne in four UK adults are in financial difficulty or could quickly find themselves in difficulty if they suffered a financial shock, and 4.2 million people have missed bills or loan payments in at least three of the six months before the survey took place. \n\n\n\n\n 8.49am  \n\nRuth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, neatly sums up the situation: \n\nThe weakness in retail sales and overshoot of the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s March public borrowing forecast won\u2019t make the next prime minister\u2019s task any easier in navigating the economy through the cost of living crisis, cost of borrowing crisis and the cost of credibility crisis\u2026\nExpenditure of \u00a379.3bn [in September] was far higher than the \u00a373.6bn the OBR forecast, as the surge in RPI inflation contributed \u00a34.7bn to the \u00a37.7bn rise in debt interest payments\u2026\nThis is before taking into account the government\u2019s energy price support (perhaps costing in the region of \u00a360bn) and the remaining mini-budget tax-cutting measures. Overall, we still think that the chancellor has a big challenge ahead to fill the remaining hole of about \u00a334bn and restore credibility in policy-making in the eyes of the financial markets.\n\n\n\n\n 8.43am  \n\nGovernment receipts in September were \u00a37bn higher than September 2021, at \u00a371.2bn, as tax receipts rose by \u00a34.5bn to \u00a352bn, but this was offset by higher spending.\nThe \u00a320bn borrowing in September left the deficit in the fiscal year so far at \u00a3133.3bn compared with an Office for Budget Responsibility forecast of \u00a3127.8bn.\nMartin Beck, chief economic advisor to the forecaster, the EY Item Club, says:\n\nBut only a small part of the fiscal policy support announced for 2022-23 has so far fed into borrowing. Notably, the cost of the Energy Price Guarantee (EPG) and the cap on businesses\u2019 energy bills will not affect spending until this month. November will then see revenues reduced by the cut in national insurance contributions.\nHowever, the decision to reverse almost all the other tax cuts of September\u2019s mini-Budget and limit the EPG to six months means borrowing will come in significantly less in 2023-24 than was being predicted only a week or so ago. The prospect of tax rises and spending cuts in the forthcoming fiscal statement point in the same direction.\nIf energy prices are elevated next spring, there\u2019s a chance the EPG will be extended. But a fall in future gas prices offers hope that an extension won\u2019t be necessary. However, the effects of a likely recession on the public finances and the risk that energy prices could increase means that the fiscal deficit this year and next will probably come in tens of billions of pounds above the OBR\u2019s March forecast of \u00a399.1bn and \u00a350.2bn respectively.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 9.04am BST\n\n\n 8.24am  \n\nJake Finney, economist at PwC, says:\nThe latest public sector finances data highlights the challenges faced by the incoming prime Minister and the chancellor. Public borrowing in September was around 13% higher than at the same time last year, in large part due to rising spending on interest payments and cost-of-living payments to households, such as the winter fuel payments. \nReductions to gilt rates following the U-turns announced earlier this week could potentially lower the government\u2019s debt interest spending by up to \u00a310bn a year. This would significantly reduce the size of the black hole in the public finances.\nLooking forward, all eyes are on October 31, when chancellor Jeremy Hunt will present a new fiscal strategy for the country. Public sector debt as a share of GDP is now at 98%, its highest level since the early 1960s. To meet its current fiscal targets the government will need to announce around \u00a330-40bn of spending cuts or tax rises. This is equivalent to around a fifth of the core NHS budget.\n\n\n\n 8.22am  \n\nCarl Emmerson, deputy director of the respected Institute for Fiscal Studies, has crunched the public finance figures, and is suggesting that the fiscal statement should be delayed beyond 31 October, \u201cto make good decisions\u201d.\n\nToday\u2019s numbers show that borrowing in the first half of this year was \u00a372bn, which is almost the same as the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s forecast for this period in March. But this is little guide to how much borrowing will be over the whole of this financial year, as the huge cost of government support for household and business energy use only began in earnest this month. Fuelled by this in last week\u2019s Green Budget [by the IFS] we forecast that borrowing this year could reach almost \u00a3200bn, which would be nearly \u00a3100bn more than the OBR forecast.A key focus for the next prime minister and their chosen chancellor needs to be fiscal responsibility. We need a credible plan to ensure that government debt can be expected to fall over the medium-term.\nGiven the timeline for determining the next prime minister, the degree of economic uncertainty, and the importance of getting this right, there is a strong case for taking a bit longer to make good decisions which have more chance of standing the test of time, rather than going ahead with a major fiscal event only a few days into the new PM\u2019s tenure.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.30am BST\n\n\n 8.13am  \nEuropean stocks, oil prices fall\n\nEuropean stocks have slid at the open, while crude oil prices have also retreated amid worries about rising interest rates to combat high inflation, and the worsening economic outlook.\n\nUK\u2019s FTSE 100 down 41 points, or 0.6%, to 6,901\nGermany\u2019s Dax down 1%\nFrance\u2019s CAC down 1.1%\nItaly\u2019s FTSE MiB down 1%\nSpain\u2019s Ibex down 0.7%\nPortugal\u2019s PSI down 0.6%\n\nBrent crude, the global oil benchmark, is trading 0.36% lower at $92.05 a barrel while US light crude has lost 0.4% to $84.15 a barrel.\n\nUpdated at 9.37am BST\n\n\n 7.51am  \nIntroduction: government borrowing rises, pound slides\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the world economy and the financial markets.\nWe\u2019ve woken up to news of a further rise in UK government borrowing, a sharp drop in retail sales in Great Britain, and a decline in the pound.\nSterling slid 0.5% to $1.1178 this morning, taking it close to a one-week low, and wiping out the brief rally to $1.1338 after Liz Truss resigned as prime minister on Thursday.\nThe UK\u2019s public finances have worsened further, with the government borrowing \u00a320bn in September as it spent more on debt interest payments, according to figures just released by the Office for National Statistics. It is the second highest September borrowing on record and worse than what City economists had expected - putting more pressure on Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, ahead of the fiscal statement on 31 October.\nHinting at potential spending cuts and tax rises, Hunt said:\n\nStrong public finances are the foundation of a strong economy. To stabilise markets, I\u2019ve been clear that protecting our public finances means difficult decisions lie ahead.\nWe will do whatever is necessary to get drive down debt in the medium term and to ensure that taxpayers\u2019 money is well spent, putting the public finances on a sustainable path as we grow the economy.\n\nThe government borrowed \u00a32.2bn more last month than in September 2021, making it the second-highest September borrowing since monthly records began in 1983.\nCentral government day-to-day spending was \u00a379.3bn last month, up \u00a35.8bn on a year earlier. This was mostly because of a \u00a32.5bn increase in debt interest payments, while a \u00a34.4bn increase in social benefit payments was partly offset by subsidy payments.\nDebt interest payable rose to \u00a37.7bn, the highest September figure since monthly records began in April 1997, because of the effect on soaring inflation on index-linked gilts.\n\nAt the same time, retail sales in Great Britain fell sharply last month, as the cost of living crisis is hitting people\u2019s ability to spend on food and other items.\nVolumes fell by 1.4% in September, a bigger-than-expected drop that took them 1.3% below pre-coronavirus levels in February 2020, according to the ONS. Food store sales fell 1.8%, online sales retreated 3% and petrol was down 1.3%.\nIt said that while retailers continue to mention the effect of rising prices and the cost of living on sales volumes, data for September are also affected by the bank holiday for the Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s state funeral, when many shops closed.\nWithin non-food stores, sales of household goods such a furniture fell 1.5% while department stores recorded a 0.6% drop. Clothing shops eked out a 0.1% gain, mainly because of growth in shoe shops.\nIn the three months to September, retail sales were down 2% compared with the previous three months; this continues the downward trend seen since the summer of 2021.\n\nThe Agenda\n\n9am BST: EU European Council Meeting\n3pm BST: Eurozone consumer confidence flash for October (forecast: -30)\n\n\nUpdated at 8.09am BST\n"

                    "body": "Russia\u2019s invading forces have bombed civilians in Kyiv, Kharkiv and elsewhere in Ukraine in the past 48 hours, prompting fears of rising casualties and growing questions as to whether the west could step up military, economic or other efforts to help. Here are some of the options \u2013 and the risks.\nNo-fly zone over Ukraine\nAfter war broke out last week, Ukraine\u2019s ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko, called for the west to implement a no-fly zone over his country, arguing that \u201cpeople are dying as we speak\u201d, and the idea has captured the imagination of many as the bombing worsens.\nCreating airspace where Russian aircraft cannot fly would need to be enforced militarily, typically with surveillance, pre-emptive strikes and ultimately by downing banned aircraft. This would mean Nato forces engaging directly with Russian planes.\nWestern leaders have repeatedly said it would not be possible for Nato to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine because, in the words of the UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, it would \u201clead to a war against Russia across the whole of Europe\u201d as western jets would have to seize control of the skies.\nBut Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative chair of the defence committee, complained that Wallace should have not ruled the idea out so publicly at least. \u201cThis shows we\u2019ve forgotten the rules of post-cold war statecraft by exhibiting weakness and failing to keep the enemy guessing \u2013 even if you\u2019ve privately ruled the option out,\u201d the MP said.\nGround forces in Ukraine and eastern Europe\nBoris Johnson, on a visit to Estonia on Tuesday, said the UK, in common with other western nations \u201cwill not fight Russian forces in Ukraine\u201d. A doubling of British forces to nearly 2,000 in the Baltic country was \u201cnothing more than defensive measures\u201d, he added.\nThere has been no political will to let Ukraine join Nato, although that has left Kyiv to fend for itself now it is under Russian attack. A more realistic focus, said Prof Malcolm Chalmers from the Rusi thinktank, would be for Nato to \u201ccarry on reinforcing its eastern flank\u201d, increasing the size of garrisons from Romania in the south to Estonia in the north.\nNato had already said it would deploy \u201cthousands\u201d of troops from its combat-ready response force to the territory of its eastern European members; the US alone had sent a further 12,000 troops. But that will do little to help Kyiv directly.\nMore arms and military aid\nThe US and UK supplied anti-tank weapons to Ukraine before fighting started. Once Russia invaded, many more including Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands followed up with anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons. Yet to withstand the Russian onslaught, supplies will need to continue.\n\u201cThe most important thing is to provide weapons the Ukrainians are used to operating \u2013 like handheld anti-air systems and lots of anti-tank missiles,\u201d Chalmers said. Ukrainian forces will also need the basics \u2013 ammunition and fuel \u2013 and open supply lines, meaning logistics inside and outside Ukraine will be critical.\nBut a bolder plan to send Russian-made MiG-29 and Su-25 jets, of the kind familiar to Ukraine\u2019s pilots, from Poland, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria collapsed this week. It is not clear how realistic the proposal was, but if the plan was to revive it, it could provide help to Kyiv\u2019s beleaguered air force.\nGreater humanitarian aid\nExperts predict, grimly, that although Russia\u2019s advance on Kyiv and other major centres is slow, it is progressing. Mathieu Boul\u00e8gue, from the Chatham House thinktank, said \u201cunrestricted warfare\u201d was coming with carpet bombing replacing precision strikes and civilian casualties likely to mount.\nFood is said to be short in the east of Ukraine, while aid is backed up on the Polish border, taking 48 hours to get through. \u201cBroadly, the neighbours of Ukraine have to prepare for a humanitarian disaster,\u201d said Keir Giles, from Chatham House, adding that the situation required major donor efforts from governments and individuals.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Johnson announced in the Commons that a Disasters Emergency Committee public appeal for aid for Ukraine had been launched, with the British government pledging to match the first \u00a320m in donations.\nBlocking energy exports\nThe biggest step the west could take to hurt Russia\u2019s economy is considered to be the blocking of energy exports. So far this has been resisted because of the damage it would cause for European nations reliant on the gas supply.\nAs much as $700m (\u00a3525m) of oil, gas and other commodities is thought to be bought by the UK, US and EU each day, powering the Russian economy and aiding the Kremlin. Russia accounts for almost 40% of the EU\u2019s natural gas imports, with up to 65% in Germany and 100% in some eastern European nations.\nBut there are options to replace Russian gas, including sourcing more supplies of liquid natural gas from other nations such as Qatar. There could also be increased use of coal power, as well as Germany delaying planned closures of its three remaining nuclear reactors. \nHarsher financial sanctions\nSanctions on Russian banks and the country\u2019s central bank are having the biggest impact on its economy. In an early sign of the damage, the Moscow stock exchange remains closed while the rouble plunged almost 30% on Monday after steps to freeze reserves held overseas by the Russian central bank.\n\nMeasures to exclude more Russian banks from the Swift international payments network are still being drawn up. But there are fears that casting the net too wide could have a knock-on impact for the global financial system, which has never seen a crisis like this.\nTargeting oligarchs\nBoris Johnson has announced new anti-corruption measures, including the imposition of sanctions on Russian oligarchs. But implementation has been slow and only nine individuals have been targeted by the UK so far, with the EU putting sanctions on far more.\nThe idea is that imposing financial pain on the Russian elite, who are seen as enabling Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime and whose wealth is spread around the world in properties and business investments, will in turn apply pressure to the president himself.\nThere have been calls for a faster and a wider net to be drawn. Margaret Hodge, a Labour MP, urged the UK government to target 105 more oligarchs. \u201cWe are complicit in this and we are facilitating it by not tackling this,\u201d she said."

                    "body": "Good morning. The energy standoff between Russia and the rest of Europe continues to spiral. At the end of July, Russia further reduced supply to the continent, making it harder \u2013 and more expensive \u2013 for countries to ensure reserves of gas ahead of the winter. In the UK, the government has offered a trickle of policies that are supposed to lighten the load, including a one-off \u00a3400 energy bill discount for households and windfall taxes on energy companies that are reporting exceedingly high profits. But is this enough \u2013 and how is the rest of the world coping? In today\u2019s newsletter we outline the measures taken by five other countries to address the global energy crisis. Five big stories  NHS | The health minister Maria Caulfield has admitted that 34 hospitals have roofs made of concrete that are so badly maintained they could collapse at any moment. Salman Rushdie | The author\u2019s \u201croad to recovery has begun\u201d but \u201cwill be long\u201d after his stabbing in western New York, the novelist\u2019s agent has said. \u201cThe injuries are severe,\u201d Andrew Wylie told the Guardian in an email \u2013 Rushdie received \u201clife changing\u201d injuries to his neck, stomach, eye, chest and thigh. \u201cBut his condition is headed in the right direction.\u201d Water | A Lib Dem councillor has called for Thames Water to be fined after it cut water supplies leading to hundreds of households in Surrey having to go three days without tap water at the height of the heatwave. Labour | Keir Starmer has set out a \u00a329bn proposal that Labour says would avoid people having to pay \u201ca penny more\u201d on their energy bills this winter. It includes an \u00a38bn windfall tax on energy company profits and insulating 19m homes over the next decade. Immigration | Data released by the ONS shows there has been a dramatic drop in EU citizens moving to the UK. Last year 43,000 EU citizens received visas for work, family, study or other purposes, in comparison with 230,000 to 430,000 between 2014-2020.  In depth: From nationalising utilities to aircon bans, how other countries are coping  With reports that energy bills are going to cost the equivalent of two months\u2019 wages by next year, it seems increasingly important that the British government takes a preemptive, rather than reactive, approach to the crisis. So what\u2019s everyone else doing? *** Germany In 2020, Russia supplied over 50% of Germany\u2019s natural gas, roughly a third of all oil, and almost half of all of its coal imports. So when Russia cut gas supplies to Germany at the end of July, the results were catastrophic. In response, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has been labouring to wean the country off its heavy reliance on Russian exports of oil and gas. He has assured German citizens that they won\u2019t be left without energy this winter or with extortionate bills landing on their doorstep. The first thing Scholz did was to pass emergency legislation to reactivate closed oil and coal power plants. It\u2019s not ideal \u2013 the government\u2019s environmentalist economics minister, Robert Habeck, has described the move as \u201cpainful but necessary\u201d\u2014 but it is an effective way of alleviating some pressure in the short term. Scholz has also indicated that he is considering U-turning on Germany\u2019s policy to phase out nuclear energy, and lengthening the lifetime of the country\u2019s only three remaining nuclear plants. The German government is aware these are temporary responses to stop the bleeding. Looking ahead, a central part of Germany\u2019s long term plan is to achieve energy sovereignty by investing in and scaling up the generation of renewable energy. The government is installing more solar and wind energy farms and has recently released an energy efficiency support package of $180bn to Germany\u2019s climate and transformation fund. *** France There are various factors exacerbating the energy crisis in France, and fewer than half of the country\u2019s nuclear reactors are up and running because of maintenance issues. France has decided the best way to mitigate wider economic damage is to cap retail energy prices. This move has already played a crucial role in insulating France from the energy price shock afflicting the rest of the continent. In comparison with the UK, Germany and even the US, France\u2019s inflation rate, at 6.5%, is considerably lower. Another measure Macron has taken to stabilise the situation is to renationalise EDF, France\u2019s main electricity supplier, at a cost of nearly \u20ac10bn. The government has also reduced taxes on electricity and approved a \u20ac20bn package of measures to help struggling households cope with rising energy and food prices. *** US It\u2019s not just Europe dealing with this debilitating problem. The US is contending with the worst energy crisis since the 1970s. Last month, gasoline prices reached $5 a gallon for the first time ever, natural gas hit its highest mark in 14 years and electricity grid operators announced controlled outages are likely. In response, Senator Joe Manchin is backing a $369bn climate and energy deal. The legislation would include tax credits for buying environmentally friendly vehicles, incentives to accelerate the rollout of wind and solar farms, and support for nuclear power production. However, for this legislation to have any impact on the current crisis, it would have to be rolled out quickly and efficiently \u2013 which in the context of the US\u2019s political gridlock is unlikely.  *** Japan Japan is no stranger to an energy crisis. After the catastrophic earthquake and tsunami in 2011 that triggered a meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, energy saving became a cornerstone national project for the country. So, unlike in many other countries, Japan already has a blueprint for how to deal with this kind of crisis. Instead of large, governmental interventions, the focus seems to be on individuals cutting back. The government has long encouraged businesses and households to lower their use of air conditioners and avoid using other power-hungry appliances. The suspension of nuclear power for the last decade has made problems worse \u2013 as the crisis continues, it\u2019s clear Japan is going to have to reevaluate the way it generates energy. *** Pakistan For Pakistan, a country that depends on imported fuel, the global energy crisis has left its economy in a dire place. Power cuts have significantly affected commercial activity, and gas rationing to the textile industry, a vital part of Pakistan\u2019s economy, has resulted in a loss of $1bn in export orders. To deal with this, Pakistan has announced that it is open to long-term contracts of up to 30 years \u2013 most likely with Qatar and the UAE. Long-term contracts however are reportedly 75% more expensive than they were a year ago. Experts estimate that if Pakistan signed a deal now, a single cargo could cost roughly $55m-$61m. Pakistan is also looking inward and, like many other countries, turning to its nuclear plants to alleviate some of the pressure. Whether this will be enough is unclear.

                    "body": "This winter, I\u2019ll be wearing an extra jumper and the heating won\u2019t be going on until it\u2019s cold enough to see my breath. Even then, it will be timed to go on when I\u2019ve done a wash and I need to dry laundry. Life is going to get a lot more harsh. At the moment I\u2019m paying \u00a395 a month, and a few months back it was \u00a366. I\u2019m just about covering my bills and I don\u2019t know what happens when the changes announced on Friday hit \u2013 I\u2019m looking at \u00a3200 a month. I\u2019ve lived on benefits for years \u2013 I\u2019m a single mum to two autistic children \u2013 and I\u2019ve never felt poor. But actually, I am at the point where I\u2019m thinking: is it cheaper to do a small wash or one big wash? Do I need to put the lights on? Who knows if they\u2019ll make a dent in the bill, though.  Today I had cold rice pudding because I didn\u2019t want to use the microwave. When I boil the kettle, I fill a flask up, so I can have another cup of tea later or some instant soup for lunch. The other day, I boiled some eggs in the same pan I was cooking pasta. Frozen veg seems to cook quicker and I do it all in one pan, and I\u2019m certainly not cooking a roast dinner at the moment. It\u2019s about scrimping and saving where I can to minimise that initial shock. I got absolutely soaked in the rain earlier, but I don\u2019t use my hairdryer any more. In January, when it\u2019s pouring with rain, normally the heating would go on, and I\u2019ll hang my bag and coat on the radiator to dry them out. Not this winter. I\u2019ll stuff them with newspaper and hope they don\u2019t go a funny colour or start to smell. I know how many steps there are in my house and how to get around in the dark, so I don\u2019t need to put the lights on. These are the realities of this price increase. I will almost certainly be buying less food, or food that is not as good, but until I get a bill, I won\u2019t know. There are things I will consider whether to buy or not, things that might not seem big to somebody else, like a weekly bus pass. It\u2019s \u00a318.50, and I don\u2019t get one every week but when I do, I use it as much as possible, and it allows me to go to places that don\u2019t cost anything, like a museum. It feels unfair. That sounds silly, but when you see the profits that are being made you think surely there\u2019s some scope for help. In the energy industry, those at the top get wages and bonuses that are unthinkable to me. You\u2019ve got politicians who can claim their expenses, so you think does it matter to them enough? Do they really understand that there are people who cannot afford the bill? I\u2019m not sure politicians are really grounded in reality. I\u2019m on universal credit, and I received the cost of living payment, and I\u2019ve put some aside to go towards my next bill, but is it going to see us through the winter? At the food bank where I volunteer, I talk to people when they arrive and ask how they\u2019re doing. Most of the conversations are about money and bills that are coming. It has been an expensive month for many people \u2013 school uniforms to get, new shoes, new coats. They\u2019re already saying they\u2019re not going to be able to pay their energy bills. I\u2019ve realised that if I haven\u2019t got the money, there\u2019s not a lot I can do about it, but that doesn\u2019t stop me worrying. I rang the electric company to ask what would happen if I couldn\u2019t pay, and they said they wouldn\u2019t be able to help me until I defaulted on my bill \u2013 but I don\u2019t want to get to that stage. So maybe it is rationing the heating, and having a cold tin of rice pudding rather than heating it up, or towel-drying my hair rather than putting the hairdryer on. These never used to feel like luxuries.  As told to Emine Saner. Sophie is in her 40s and lives in the north of England.

                    "body": "Four more Conservative MPs called for Boris Johnson to resign on Thursday over lockdown-breaking parties, as Downing Street sought to contain the political aftermath of the Sue Gray report.\nThe prime minister\u2019s allies reiterated the defence that his attendance at a series of gatherings for departing staff was permitted as work duties. His official spokesman argued that Covid guidelines did not specifically rule out leaving drinks.\n\nHe also formally apologised for misleading the media in repeatedly denying that any parties had taken place inside Downing Street during lockdown. He insisted this had been entirely inadvertent.\nNineteen Tory MPs have publicly called for Johnson to quit so far, well below the 54 required to prompt a confidence vote, but the trickle of new voices will unnerve Downing Street as backbenchers digest Gray\u2019s description of rowdy and drunken gatherings inside No 10.\nAlong with those who have made public calls, two more have submitted and then withdrawn letters of no confidence, and at least three others have called for Johnson to resign but said they would not submit letters.\nThe former health minister Stephen Hammond was among those to say he had submitted a letter of no confidence. Hammond, who has a majority of 628 in his Wimbledon seat, described the conclusions of the Gray report as damning. \u201cI cannot and will not defend the indefensible,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI am struck by a number of my colleagues who were really concerned that it\u2019s almost impossible for the PM to say I want to move on, as we cannot move on without regaining public trust and I am not sure that\u2019s possible in the current situation.\u201d\nTwo other MPs, David Simmonds and John Baron, said they had lost confidence in Johnson. A fourth, Angela Richardson, who quit as a parliamentary private secretary earlier in the year, said she would have resigned if she had been in Johnson\u2019s position.\n\nBaron, a former shadow minister, said he did not believe Johnson was unaware of the \u201cshameful pattern of misbehaviour during the pandemic as the rest of us kept to the Covid regulations\u201d.\nSimmonds, the MP for Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner, which adjoins the prime minister\u2019s Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency in west London, said it had become clear that \u201cwhile the government and our policies enjoy the confidence of the public, the prime minister does not\u201d.\nSpeaking about Gray\u2019s findings, Richardson said: \u201cI am clear that had this been a report about my leadership, I would resign.\u201d\nJulian Sturdy, the MP for York Outer, had called on Johnson to go on Wednesday. The report had left him \u201cunable to give the prime minister the benefit of the doubt,\u201d he said.\nMPs said on Thursday that they expected the number of letters to increase to continue over the next few days, but stressed it was not a coordinated effort.\nOthers have hinted at deep dissatisfaction in emails to constituents seen by the Guardian. Andrew Jones, the MP for Harrogate and Knaresborough, wrote that he was \u201cin no way sympathetic to fancy words or formulae that allow anyone to pretend they were at a work event when they clearly were not\u201d. Rob Largan, the MP for High Peak, said he was \u201ctaking the appropriate action to defend integrity in public life.\u201d\nPhilip Dunne, the MP for Ludlow, wrote to a constituent that he had grave doubts about the PM. \u201cI am sorry to say any benefit of the doubt the PM enjoyed has now been eroded,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhile I have not called for his resignation, the PM has yet to prove to me that he is the right person to ensure the return of integrity and due decorum, that all our constituents expect from politicians.\u201d \n\nWhen Johnson\u2019s spokesman, a civil servant who by convention is not named when quoted, apologised for misleading the media, he refused to say whether he had attended any of the events set out in Gray\u2019s report or whether he had received a fixed-penalty notice.\n\u201cThe prime minister has said, and I\u2019ve said on a number of occasions that there were failings both in terms of what happened and in terms of how it was handled subsequently,\u201d he said. \u201cThe prime minister has apologised for that, and I\u2019m happy to apologise for that as well.\u201d\nHe said Johnson had been entitled to attend a series of leaving drinks, including one where he has pictured, glass in hand, raising a toast, as the \u201cguidelines were silent\u201d on whether such events were permitted.\nSteve Barclay, the minister brought n as Downing Street chief of staff as part of the Partygate shake-up at No 10, argued the prime minister saw such events as permissible because staff were working \u201cclosely together for long hours\u201d.\nThe publication of Gray\u2019s report has reignited scrutiny of the parallel Metropolitan police investigation into the gatherings in and around No 10, and notably the question of why Johnson was fined for only one other event \u2013 his own birthday party in June 2020 \u2013 when he had attended other gatherings for which staff were penalised.\nThe Met\u2019s acting commissioner vehemently rejected the notion that Johnson had received favourable treatment, saying the force had investigated the parties \u201cwithout fear or favour\u201d.\n\nGiving evidence to the London assembly\u2019s police and crime committee on Thursday, Stephen House said fixed-penalty notices were only issued if police \u201chad the evidence that we thought would give us a realistic prospect of a convention at court\u201d should the fine be challenged.\n\u201cWithout making comment on any individual, I don\u2019t believe there is clear evidence that the prime minister breached many other times,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI am very confident of the integrity of the decisions that were made in this investigation. I\u2019m not particularly concerned about what the prime minister thinks. I do my job without fear or favour, as did the Met.\u201d\nHouse said he accepted some photographs of No 10 gatherings \u201clook bad\u201d, but added: \u201cWe deal with the law, not what looks bad. And just because there is alcohol present, can I remind people that the Covid regulations are about breaching Covid regulations. They are not about whether there is drink there or not.\u201d\nHe also rejected the idea that Johnson or other senior No 10 staff might have avoided sanction by not filling in police questionnaires about their activities. He said someone doing so would be \u201ca spur for more work, not less\u201d, and that the \u201cvast, vast majority\u201d of questionnaires were returned."

                    "body": "Maybe you\u2019ve been kept up all night by a baby, a lover, a dinner-turned-drinks, or even gnawing worry. Maybe you\u2019re simply one of those people who plants their face in the pillow, pulls the doona cover over \u2013 and wakes up crinkly and oxygen deprived. Getting into bed at 3am and waking up at 7am looking perky is a young person\u2019s game. Face it. No one of a certain age looks their best on four hours\u2019 sleep. Heck, some of us don\u2019t even look our best on eight hours\u2019 sleep.  So sleepless or otherwise, how can we maximise our good points (clear skin, for example) and minimise the not-so-good (bags, dark circles, a greyish tint)? Do a de-puff \u201cPuffiness is the thing that gives you away,\u201d says dermatologist Dr Katherine Armour, a fellow of the Australasian College of Dermatologists. \u201cSo, start with some simple measures to reduce the dilation of blood vessels around the eyes.\u201d She recommends applying a vasoconstrictor such as an ice pack, or a gel eye mask you put in the fridge for at least five minutes. Paul Newman famously dunked his face in a basin of iced water for around 30 seconds.  \u201cIn a pinch, you can use cold teabags,\u201d she says. \u201cThey do actually work as the tannins act as an anti-inflammatory.\u201d If you feel up to it, a bit of outdoor exercise can also help stimulate lymphatic drainage and reduce overall puffiness, says Amour. She adds that it is important for people who suffer regular puffiness to consider whether allergies may be the culprit or co-conspirator. \u201cIf hay fever is connected, taking an antihistamine before going to bed can help. \u201cConsider dust mite allergies too \u2013 they can be checked with a simple blood test \u2013 and make sure you change your pillow regularly.\u201d Keeping your head elevated during the night also means fluids don\u2019t have a chance to gather in your face. Your ankles, maybe, but not your face. Pat-on products (that work) Looking after your skin by wearing a high-factor sunscreen every day of the year (90% of UV still gets through when it\u2019s cloudy) and using a good moisturising cream also smooths and plumps up the complexion, says Armour. \u201cAnd that can make it look like you had a good night\u2019s sleep.\u201d A good moisturiser can be from a major pharmacy brand \u2013 \u201cyou don\u2019t have to spend a lot\u201d. Her favourite ingredients for soothing and calming, as well as helping produce quick improvement, include vitamin B3 (niacinamide), anti-inflammatory liquorice root extract, resveratrol and astaxanthin.  In case you\u2019re thinking of investing in a miracle cream with the current \u201cit\u201d ingredient, hyaluronic acid, Armour says the molecule is way too big to penetrate the dermis when applied topically. \u201cSome moisturisers do have compounds that penetrate a little and draw moisture into the very, very top layer, and that definitely plumps skin up a bit. But it will not penetrate the dermis where natural hyaluronic acid lives.\u201d Paint on some colour Sometimes it\u2019s the ghostly hue of the sleep-deprived that signal a restless night. While morning exercise can give your skin a slight glow, you can also cheat. Janelle Jerusalem, education lead at cosmetics retailer Mecca, recommends a cream-based blush for this purpose. \u201cYou can dab a little on your fingers and gently pat on your cheeks \u2013 up towards the temples, keeping the placement high to create a youthful lift.\u201d Because it is easy to apply, you can also keep it with you when you\u2019re out and about, she says.  A cream highlighter or balm is also handy, and can be applied throughout the day on the high points of the face \u2013 think upper cheekbones and upper temples. Hello hair It\u2019s an accepted fact that a bad night\u2019s sleep usually means a bad hair day. But there is something you can do about this the night before, says Sydney hairdresser Bruce Mann. A silk pillowcase can help you \u201cwake up with smoother, sleeker hair because it creates less static and there is no friction\u201d. For those with curly hair they want to revive, he suggests: \u201cA spray bottle filled with one third conditioner and two thirds water \u2026 lightly spritz your hair when you get up, then squeeze the curl between your palms to restore bounce and eliminate frizz.\u201d If you have straight hair and wake up with flyaways everywhere, going through it quickly with a blow dryer and a brush will take out any moisture absorbed in the night and flatten the cuticle to be shiny and smooth, says Mann. \u201cIf hair is just looking a little greasy and flat, sprinkle a small amount of baby powder through the roots and tousle it. This will absorb oils and gives you volume.\u201d"

And rule it did. Love was in the air, palpable among the many thousands of punters in attendance, for whom an event of this scale and conviviality (still) seems a social luxury after the last two years. It was present in the cash registers and Eftpos touchpads as valuable money piled up for Reclink, the indefatigable organisation that rebuilds the lives of battling Australians through programs in art and sport. It was, however, nowhere to be seen on the field.  The Rockdogs, made to wait three years to avenge their 2019 one-point loss in the annual amateur music industry charity football match, came out firing. They led by two goals at the end of the third quarter, but the Megahertz \u2013 representing independent radio \u2013 came storming back to take the game 7-6-48 to 7-4-46. The match itself remained a basket case as one outrageous sequence of play followed another. The level of skill ranged wildly, although flair and bravery were never short in supply \u2013 not least in the wearing of short-shorts that seem to get shorter every year. Felix Riebl of the Cat Empire and Liam McGorrie of Dorsal Fins/Ex-Olympian were among the biggest musical names to join the Rockdogs, who were undergoing a changing of the guard after regulars Tim Rogers and Kram of Spiderbait hung up the boots.   The Steve Connolly Medal for best on ground deservedly went to Megahertz\u2019 Jarrod Kennedy, host of the late-night Saturday night shift on Triple R, whose red and white helmet provided station-branding as well as safety. Music on the day came from Parsnip, Ausecuma Beats, Izy, Cash Savage and the Last Drinks, and Private Function. If the day were a Venn diagram, then pretty much everybody \u2013 hipsters and footy diehards, well-doers and battlers, the old and the young \u2013 would all be grouped together in the middle section. All subgroups could be seen with their pants around their ankles as Ross Wilson from Daddy Cool made a surprise appearance off the interchange bench to help Private Function deliver his time-honoured sermon, Eagle Rock.  Jacob Kagan, of Melbourne band Carousel, was impressive before falling to a shoulder injury, and could be seen sporting a sling at the end of the match. \u201cI was having a great time until I fell over,\u201d he said. \u201cI was pretty sore after the game in 2019, but I had three years to recover. Now I\u2019ve got this and I\u2019ve only got a year until the next one.\u201d"

People are asking whether there is a way back for the game in Australia.\n\u201cOur game is in tatters,\u201d Central Coast Mariners\u2019 goalkeeper, Danny Vukovic, wrote on Twitter. \u201cAn absolute disgrace what happened tonight.

Walkouts had been planned by fans before this weekend\u2019s round, and earlier on Saturday at Newcastle and on the Central Coast supporters had made their protests by exiting at the 20-minute mark.\nBut things turned sour amid a tinderbox derby atmosphere in Melbourne when Glover threw a flare that landed on the pitch back into the stands occupied by Victory\u2019s supporters. The chaos that ensued led to calls for life bans for those responsible for the violence.\nVictoria police Insp Jason Goddard said police were reviewing footage of the invasion and would be \u201cknocking on doors very soon\u201d.

                    "body": "Almost two years have passed since Clare Shine felt that, after trying so hard to keep going, everything had come crashing down forever. She had already achieved what once felt impossible, rehabilitating from drug and alcohol addiction to continue a hugely successful career with Glasgow City, but now she had to do it all again. A relapse, brought on by the loneliness of Covid-19 lockdowns, had culminated in more suicidal thoughts and a high\u2011profile 10-hour police search that found her in Edinburgh. Living with 19 other patients inside the Nairn ward, a mental health unit at Glasgow\u2019s Stobhill hospital, she could not let go of the thought that her chance of recovery had passed. \u201cI felt like I was finished,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought I was done: that this is it for me, I can\u2019t progress or move on from it, it\u2019s taken over my whole life. I didn\u2019t see any way out.\u201d  Once again, though, she stepped back out into the light. On Sunday, Shine will be part of the City side that faces Celtic in the Scottish Women\u2019s Cup final and nobody should be surprised if she applies the decisive flourish once again. She scored a hat-trick in the 2015 final and a last-minute winner four years later, both times having cast aside personal demons. \u201cI\u2019ve learned to enjoy the moment as much as I can,\u201d she says, and the very fact of being back out there is a marvel. Shine is chatting in the lobby of a Glasgow hotel, which might not be the way most sportspeople would wish to spend their 27th birthday. She has been joking with her teammates that she is in fact still 24 and points out, more seriously, that several years of a young life were effectively lost to addiction; listening to her talk, though, is to hear an older and wiser voice. Shine has known more highs and desperate lows than most will experience over an average lifetime and wants people to take inspiration from her journey.  That is why she has written a book, Scoring Goals in the Dark, partly drawn from a series of diaries she has kept since the age of 15. There are few such resources available to young footballers, and girls in particular: in a relentless sporting environment, where there sometimes appears little option but to bottle things up, the darkness can take over indiscriminately. \u201cTrying to speak about it was so difficult because of the stigma,\u201d she says. \u201cI was in a professional environment, playing in the Champions League, and found myself in the depths of an addiction. I had no one to turn to as I thought people would look down on me, judge me for it, and I had lost a lot of respect from people as well. Being in the public eye while intoxicated was something I didn\u2019t even think twice about in that moment.\u201d Her book tells the story of a gifted all-rounder who played for her native Cork in the all Ireland camogie final \u2013 a variant of hurling played by women \u2013 as a teenager. \u201cThere\u2019s no way that, lining up in that game at Croke Park, I\u2019d have thought that I\u2019d be an alcoholic or addicted to drugs five or six years later,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d never have associated myself with any of that. It\u2019s just wild, the way things can turn out if you don\u2019t look after yourself.\u201d  A natural goalscorer, Shine settled on football and excelled with Raheny United before joining City for the first time in 2015, becoming a full international shortly afterwards. But alcohol was already playing too heavy a role for a player who became obsessed with finding highs that could match those felt on the pitch: months before moving to Scotland she had been hiding a problem that led to training sessions being missed and matches being dragged through in a haze; she would have panic attacks too and eventually sought help at Cork\u2019s Pieta clinic for people in distress. \u201cI was so good at hiding how I felt,\u201d she says. \u201cBut as my addiction got worse it became harder to do that, because I was turning up to games where it was very visible.\u201d Shine believes the book\u2019s contents will shock some who were close to her. It pulls no punches in describing occasions when she was embarrassed in public, including drunken trips to watch Ireland play when she was injured, and lays out in detail the harm caused when her problems continued in Scotland. Her apartment became known as the \u201cparty flat\u201d; homesickness did not help and she returned to Ireland, falling out of the game for a while before resurfacing with Cork City, who bore witness to her illness at first hand and arranged for her to visit an alcohol and drug rehabilitation centre.  Sign up for our new and free women\u2019s football newsletter!  \u201cI just thought it was a phase, normal for people at my age,\u201d she says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t differentiate between it being an addiction or me going through a certain period in my life. But when I didn\u2019t want to play football because of it, I knew there was a serious problem. \u201cThere are lifelong friendships that came crashing down around that time. I wasn\u2019t trustworthy, you couldn\u2019t rely on me for anything. I became a compulsive liar in the middle of my addiction: first silly stuff like lying about where I was to somebody who could literally see me while they were calling, then bigger things about money and the company I was keeping when the drugs started to overpower me. I was lying all the time, but I\u2019m trying to rebuild all these relationships now. It\u2019s not who I am: it\u2019s what my addiction and mental health problems did to me.\u201d  During that period Shine tried to bring about her own death: a shocking episode described vividly in the book. The fact she was back in Scotland to decide the 2019 final against Hibernian less than a year later, having been offered a return to Glasgow by their manager, Scott Booth, is utterly remarkable. So is the fact that, having relapsed in June 2020, she has reached that level once again now. Higher, too: Shine returned to the Ireland squad last summer before scoring for City in the Champions League against Servette in September. Coming back has not been entirely smooth, although she cannot praise Booth and the club enough for their care. \u201cThere was a period towards the end of last season where I was like: \u2018I can\u2019t continue, no way, I need to put myself first and do something else\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cI just felt I couldn\u2019t reach all the demands. I got quite worked up about it but learned that you can manage things better and strike a balance. I\u2019d run through a brick wall for this club but you need to do what\u2019s best for you too. Pre-season went well, though, and that goal in the Champions League was a turning point for me. I thought: \u2018I can definitely still do this sport.\u2019\u201d That is beyond question. Shine\u2019s achievement, along with the clarity and candour with which she is able to describe events that are still very recent and raw, is extraordinary. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously stuff I still have to work on and manage that may never go away,\u201d she says. Routine is very important; so is resolution and she has recently begun talking with her mother, whose loving attempts to tame a near-impossible situation are addressed in the book, about everything they went through and the associated feelings of guilt.  Now she can see a clear future for herself on and off the pitch, perhaps as a public speaker where the latter is concerned. Her erudition and honesty are arresting: the aim is that she can use them to help others. \u201cThis could happen to anyone at any time in life,\u201d she says. \u201cI want people to look at my mistakes and not make the same ones, and to know where to find support if they become ill. I know what it\u2019s like to give up, but I also know what it\u2019s like to fight back. I just want to give the message that it\u2019s possible to come back from the moment when you think you can\u2019t go any further.\u201d \u2022 Scoring Goals in the Dark by Clare Shine, with Gareth Maher, is out on 6 June from Pitch Publishing, \u00a319.99 Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255.

                    "body": "Manu Tuilagi\u2019s previous ploys to stay injury-free have included going to see a witch doctor, walking the Peak District, and weight loss \u2013 but now the England centre has concluded there is no substitute for sleep. Tuilagi is fit again, in form, and if he was unable to prevent Sale from exiting the Champions Cup at the quarter-final stage for the second consecutive season on Sunday he demonstrated his sharpness with a well-taken try on the stroke of half-time that would have thrilled Eddie Jones.  With the Premiership playoffs a distant prospect for Sale, Tuilagi is likely to have just two more domestic matches this season but, provided there are no further injury problems, he is certain to tour Australia with England for a three-match series Jones\u2019s side cannot afford to lose. For Tuilagi, it has yet again been a stop-start season blighted by injury with another Six Nations campaign missed and 10 appearances for the Sharks. He is learning to accept the logic in sitting out the odd match \u2013 he was rested for Sale\u2019s victory against Newcastle to ensure he was primed to face Racing 92 \u2013 but there is fuel in the tank to face the Wallabies and, all going well, serve as a reminder as to why England\u2019s hopes at the World Cup next year largely hinge on his fitness. During the Six Nations, Tuilagi was due to play against Wales, having recovered from the hamstring injury sustained last autumn against South Africa. He had a setback in training just before that match, however, and having made only two appearances for Sale before being called upon by England the national side faced questions over rushing him back too quickly. Not from Sale it should be said, but Alex Sanderson, the club\u2019s director of rugby, conceded that more dialogue between club and country would benefit all parties, with Sale having already borrowed a GPS unit from England so that the national coaches could monitor his progress.  For Tuilagi, the key is recognising the need to recover, and to rest. \u201cI think sleep is a big thing for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI never used to sleep \u2026 I used to sleep really late. For an athlete you need, for me, at least seven hours. So that\u2019s what I looked at when the latest hammy happened. If you keep doing the same thing, you are going to get the same result. So you\u2019ve got to change something. \u201cI had a chat with my wife, actually. I was talking to her, saying to her about how I woke up 20 minutes, 30 minutes before we had the walk-throughs and then you get into training \u2026 like, I am saying to her sometimes it\u2019s actually hard, you have to take ownership of it and be honest with yourself, because only you know what\u2019s happened. And my wife is saying: \u2018You\u2019re an athlete, you\u2019ve got to sleep.\u2019 We had that chat and then you\u2019ve just got to be honest with yourself. And you\u2019ve got to change something if you want a different result.\u201d If Tuilagi made a conscious effort to trim a few pounds at the end of last season, he has lost nothing in terms of power. His mental strength is arguably his greatest asset, however, time and again demonstrating an ability to stay sanguine whenever the latest injury setbacks strike. \u201cI am really thankful for those injuries that I came through,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd just in life you are definitely going to go through some hard times \u2013 I bet you guys have come through some tough times in your life \u2013 and that\u2019s a good thing, because you can only learn from that, as a feeling. You can\u2019t learn from someone else\u2019s mistakes, because you don\u2019t feel it. But when you have that, you\u2019ve got to embrace it. It\u2019s not good at the time but you look back and think: \u2018Yah, it was good, that.\u2019 \u201cIt\u2019s more the mental side of the game that is much more important than the physical side of the game. The game is so physical nowadays, but if your mind is stronger, mentally, nothing can stop you. You have to listen your body but as an athlete sometimes you get too excited and you just want to be out there on the field. And you ignore what your body is telling you. You\u2019ve just got to listen to it. Because if your body says no, you can\u2019t do anything.\u201d"

                    "body": "You do not even need to step inside Wembley to understand rugby league\u2019s lengthy and rich history with the national stadium. A statue immortalising five of the game\u2019s greatest players \u2013 Eric Ashton, Billy Boston, Martin Offiah, Alex Murphy and Gus Risman \u2013 has pride of place outside the ground but, in an ever-changing sporting landscape, history alone is not enough to guarantee a long-term future. That never felt more evident for the game than on Saturday, when the Challenge Cup final took in new surroundings across the capital at Tottenham. For some traditionalists, moving the cup final away from Wembley is an act of sin, tantamount to rugby league turning its back on a history and heritage of which the game is fiercely proud. But as Liam Farrell and Thomas Leuluai lifted the cup for Wigan, it was hard not to think of an alternative, post-Wembley world for rugby league.  After the Rugby Football League was forced into a switch for the final this year because of a clash with the EFL playoffs, the early noises about Tottenham as hosts are promising. The Guardian has been told the Premier League club was exceptional to work with on all levels in terms of staging the event and has left the door ajar for a return at some stage, though it has already been confirmed that the final will return to Wembley next year. But for more than one reason, Wembley is not the be all and end all for rugby league like it was a generation or so ago. Crowds have dipped at the national stadium for a few years, with the last crowd in excess of 70,000 in 2016. That was also the last year the Club Wembley total of around 10,000 seats was automatically included in the attendance figure, so since returning to Wembley in 2007 crowd numbers have always been skewed somewhat. The bigger priority for rugby league has always been keeping the cup final, the most important day in the calendar, in London. The Challenge Cup final belongs in the capital, allowing fans to descend from the north and have a big day out each year no matter who they support. But unlike 20 or 30 years ago, there are now options for the RFL to consider long term, as was underlined by the spectacle at Tottenham on Saturday. Wembley is far from the only state-of-the-art venue in London capable of hosting a major final and, given the crowd figures, somewhere such as Tottenham is actually a better fit. Throw in the Emirates Stadium, which will host a World Cup semi\u2011final this autumn, and you have venues which are not only more suited to a cup final but arguably even more exciting and attractive to visit than Wembley. The belief that there is life outside of Wembley is also reflected in the World Cup schedule this year. Previously, a home World Cup in England without a Wembley game would have been unthinkable. The 2013 event held the semi-final double-header there and in the 1995 version the old Wembley hosted the final, but this year the venue has been overlooked. The London option is, as mentioned, the Emirates Stadium for the men\u2019s semi-finals, with the final at Old Trafford. A crowd of almost 52,000 on Saturday would have looked sparse inside Wembley, too, and with a cost-of-living crisis almost certainly being felt harder in the rugby league demographics of the north. With events such as the Magic Weekend in Newcastle and the Super League grand final at Old Trafford now regulars on the calendar, filling a venue as big as Wembley isn\u2019t quite as straightforward as it once was.  With all of those financial factors to consider for supporters, there is no shame in rugby league choosing a stadium slightly smaller than Wembley and aiming to fill it. Creating a situation where demand exceeds supply could have a positive knock-on effect, too, and the fact that tickets are extremely affordable for the World Cup this year \u2013 adults can watch the semi-final at the Emirates Stadium for as little as \u00a320 \u2013 could set the tone for a tweak in Challenge Cup prices, with ticket prices for the final on Saturday as high as \u00a370. It is important to note that in the short term nothing is going to change too much; the sport has a arrangement with Wembley which will ensure the final is held there until at least 2027. But that is only five years away and occasions such as Saturday might only increase the appetite to think about what a revised future for one of the biggest events in the sporting calendar looks like. Unlike before, when Wembley was the holy grail for rugby league, there are factors both inside and outside the game that suggest change is no longer unthinkable. As the sun sets on a thoroughly enjoyable weekend in new surroundings, perhaps it\u2019s time rugby league reimagined its relationship with Wembley once and for all."

Switzerland sit bottom with nil pwa.   Updated at 9.42pm BST    9.38pm    ...Ujjkani swipes away, and the follow-up shot balloons over the bar.      9.37pm    Northern Ireland have a free-kick on the left...     9.36pm    Six \u2013 ! \u2013 additional minutes in Pristina. Can Norn Iron save themselves?      9.35pm    Three additional minutes in Geneva; can Switzerland grab something? They win a throw deep inside the Spain half and it\u2019s hurled long, but Torres, who\u2019s been excellent if untested, heads clear.      9.32pm    That\u2019s the thing with Spain \u2013 they\u2019re far too ruthful, and suddenly another long hump from Sommer sticks Seferovic in! But his chest control is poor, totally missing the ball \u2013 he takes it well and he\u2019s one-one-one \u2013 then Okafor squares for him, and his shot is blocked.      9.31pm    A long kick from Sommer, Simon charges out of his box, doesn\u2019t get the ball, and Seferovic does brilliantly to slide into a challenge, hooking possession and finding Embolo ... whose chips drifts wide!      9.30pm    I\u2019ve stuck on the Kosovo game \u2013 I could only get coverage of two, so Portugal has gone off \u2013 and Ballard heads wide!      9.28pm   GOAL! Kosovo 3-2 Northern Ireland (Ballard 83)  Kosovo have seen this out pretty well, but all of a sudden Northern Ireland find a livener, and these last seven minutes should be frantic.    Updated at 9.32pm BST    9.26pm    Switzerland only trail by a goal, but can\u2019t get anything going. Meanwhile, in Lisbon, Portugal are pushing for a third.      9.25pm    Portugal send on Leao for Jota and Czech Republic Kral for Mateju; Spain do Soler for Llorente, then Switzerland try Seferovic for Akanji.      9.22pm    Llorente runs the channel and Azpilicueta finds him, but a heavy touch as he looks to get towards goal allows the challenge.      9.21pm    How is Ronaldo still out there? His team are 2-0 up and cruising, he\u2019s 37 years old, and totally lost his way in the middle of last season when the matches came quickly. Surely he needs a rest?      9.20pm    I\u2019ll level with youse: these second halves haven\u2019t been great.      9.18pm    Spain have got to find themselves a reliable goalscorer. I guess they\u2019re hoping Torres becomes that in the way David Silva did; if he can get there, they\u2019ll be a very difficult team to beat.      9.16pm    Czech Republic send on Vlkanova for Hlazek while, in Geneva, Spain try Koke for Gavi and Asensio for Morata.      9.14pm    Spain\u2019s lead is still a narrow one; I\u2019d not be at all surprised if Switzerland switzerlanded them.      9.14pm    \u201cRonaldo\u2019s ball across!\u201d says our commentator, but I reckon that was a shot. Either way, Stanek hangs on.      9.11pm    Changes for Portugal, Vitinha for Bernardo and Fernandes for Carvalho.      9.10pm    Nice from Guedes, allowing a cross across his body while shaping to shoot. But just as he\u2019s about to make it 3-0, a desperate tackle robs him.    Updated at 9.19pm BST    9.09pm    Llorente, who\u2019s probably been Spain\u2019s best player, collects a loose ball, runs away from goal, then swivels into a rasper that flies just wide of the far post. He\u2019s very useful indeed.      9.08pm    Gibraltar have equalised in Bulgaria; Malta have equalised against Estonia.      9.07pm    Okafor looks a pretty decent prospect, so I\u2019m looking forward to seeing if he can make an impression here.      9.07pm    Now Switzerland send on Steffen and Okafor for Zuber and Aebischer.      9.06pm    Spain send on Olmo for Sarabia.      9.05pm    Meantime, Czech Republic have a three on two! The main the middle, Hlozek I think, finds Jurecka to his right, but instead of going across the keeper with precision \u2013 as Guedes did in scoring Portugals second \u2013 he thrashes wildly, a slice flying into the near-post side-netting.      9.04pm    \u201cAs much as I understand the complaining and fatigue about football needing a break,\u201d emails Jo\u00e3o Fidalgo, \u201cspare a thought countries like Portugal, full of pretty handy footballers we only get to see when there are home friendlies. I guess this is not the same for English fans, but the atmosphere in Lisbon for these (mostly meaningless) matches is pretty nice (on TV. I\u2019m not there).\u201d Yes, that\u2019s a fair point \u2013 though I think the gripe is the timing, not the existence.      9.02pm    Czech Republic have also improved, but Portgual look in the process of gradually taking back over.      8.59pm    Switzerland have looked a little better since half-time, but as I type that, Torres moseys across the face of the box from right to left and drills a low shot straight at Sommer.      8.58pm   GOAL! Greece 3-0 Cyprus (Limnios 48)  Greece will maintain their three-point lead over Kosovo at the top of League C Group 2.      8.56pm   GOAL! Kosovo 3-1 Northern Ireland (Muriqi 52)  Northern Ireland are having an absolute mare here. They were lucky not to concede at least three in the first half, and Kosovo have set things straight quickly after the restart.    Updated at 8.59pm BST    8.53pm    Jurecka, on for Lingr, was one of three changes \u2013 Jemelka and Pesek are also on, for Havel and Kuchla.      8.52pm    Czech Republic make a decent start to the second half, clipping a ball into the box that Jurecka, on as sub wins in front of the keeper. But facing away from goal, he nods down and it won\u2019t fall for any of his mates, then he\u2019s flagged offside.      8.50pm    \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the first to say this,\u201d muses Arwel Gwyn Jones, \u201cbut really, enough of the football already. We all need a bit of a break, fans as well as players.\u201d I feel you, sort of. The players need a break, but international football also needs to exist, so I\u2019m not sure what the solution is \u2013 and if the game were less morally bankrupt, we\u2019d actually be getting ready for a World Cup.      8.48pm    We\u2019re back under way...     8.37pm         8.37pm    Join me in 10 minutes for the second halves....     8.37pm   GOAL! Sweden 0-1 Serbia (Jovic 45+3)  Serbia need a win here, and they\u2019re in prime position to get it.      8.36pm   Half-time scores  Kosovo 2-1 Northern Ireland Norway 0-0 Slovenia Greece 2-0 Cyprus Gibraltar 0-1 Bulgaria North Macedonia 0-0 Georgia Malta 0-1 Estonia     8.34pm   Half-time: Switzerland 0-1 Spain  Spain are by far the better side, but Switzerland are still in it.    Updated at 8.42pm BST    8.34pm   GOAL! Kosovo 2-1 Northern Ireland (Lavery 44)  Spencer stands up a cross and Lavery nods home from two yards out. His team might\u2019ve been further behind, but now they\u2019re bang back in the game!    Updated at 8.47pm BST    8.33pm   Half-time: Portugal 2-0 Czech Republic  Portugal have played pretty well, especially in the last 20 minutes, and if they maintain their intensity I\u2019d expect them to add to their goal-tally.    Updated at 8.52pm BST    8.32pm    Ronaldo heads a Switzerland corner clear, then seconds later twinkles to the line when fed by the magnificent Bernardo and sees his cross knocked behind.     8.31pm    Looking at that second Portugal goal again, it really was an excellent finish. I\u2019d wondered whether Stanek should\u2019ve saved it, but Guedes did so well to quickly work out how to beat him, then execute a finish that wasn\u2019t perfect but was correct. And therefore perfect, I guess.      8.29pm    While I was describing that goal, Gavi perpetrated some footwork of absolute filth, beating two or three men inside a phone box. Him and Pedri in the same midfield is going to be something.      8.27pm    Incidentally, the various leagues in which these players play finished three weeks ago. I\u2019m not sure they should still be flogging themselves now, though I don\u2019t suppose there\u2019s much option if we\u2019re to preserve international football.      8.26pm   GOAL! Portugal 2-0 Czech Republic (Guedes 38)  Portugal are going clear at the top of the group! Neves plays a clever ball between the lines for Bernardo, who turns and slides a pass of his own for Guedes, running into space down the right of the box. But it goes outside not inside the defender, forcing Guedes to screw the shot to direct it across the keeper, and though he doesn\u2019t get much pace on it, he directs it well enough and that should be enough for his team.    Updated at 8.38pm BST    8.23pm    Spain are still pulling Switzerland all over the show. But they\u2019ve not scored a second, or come especially close to so doing.      8.20pm   LOVELY GOAL! Portugal 1-0 Czech Republic (Cancelo 33)  Cancelo finds Bernardo down the right and there looks to be no danger. But he knows that his club mate will turn and slip the ball into the box, so he races into the space, it duly arrives, then he absolutely mashes a low finish into the far side-netting! I daresay Pep Guardiola should be credited with the assist for that one.    Updated at 8.29pm BST    8.18pm    This is worthy of note, so too the enshrining of \u00a330 away tickets \u2013 though \u00a320 was plenty and still is.       8.16pm   GOAL! Greece 2-0 Cyprus (Pavlidis 20)  Greece look well set to make it three wins out of three \u2013 they\u2019re top of the Northern Ireland group.      8.14pm   GOAL! Kosovo 2-0 Northern Ireland (Bytyqi 20)  Goodness me, it\u2019s not going at all well for either Irish side, and though the North responded well to going behind, they conceded again when Spencer couldn\u2019t clear a cross, and are in all sorts.   Updated at 8.26pm BST    8.12pm    Switzerland win a free-kick down the right \u2013 Llorente is booked for the foul on Shaqiri which yielded it \u2013 and Shaqiri delivers a fine, swerving cross to the far post, where Embolo is unmarked! But caught between going for gaol and heading back across, he totally mistimes his intervention, shouldering into the side-netting.      8.10pm    Soucek rattles Jota, who stays down, but Ronaldo charges onto the loose ball, nips outside his man ... and slices a riser into the near-post side-netting.      8.09pm    What Switzerland are looking for is balls in behind for Embolo to latch onto. Torres might be able to match he for speed, but he can\u2019t match him for presence, and I\u2019d back the attacker in a one-on-one.      8.08pm    Spain are in rhythm here, the speed of their passing and intuition of their movement pulling Switzerland all over the show. But the hosts are expert at staying in games, and won\u2019t mind too much that they\u2019re one down \u2013 especially given the balance of play.      8.03pm    In Lisbon, Portugal are pushing the pace, but have yet to create anything serious.      8.03pm   GOAL! Greece 1-0 Cyprus (Bakasetas 8)  The home side lead in the derby!      8.01pm    I think Sarabia was a fraction off, but VAR reckons not. I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t think anyone knows anything anymore, and I\u2019m happy to go with the on-pitch decision or give the attacker the benefit of the doubt when it\u2019s that close.      8.00pm    But was Sarabia offside? VAR is investigating...     7.59pm   GOAL! Switzerland 0-1 Spain (Sarabia 14)  Spain do really well to win it high up and Llorente marches onto the ball superbly, squares, and Sarabia slides in!    Updated at 8.57pm BST    7.58pm   GOAL! Kosov 1-0 Northern Ireland (Muriqi pen 9)  Davis catches Rashica and Muriqi tucks the penalty away!     Updated at 8.05pm BST    7.56pm    In Geneva, Spain have Switzerland pressed back, but when Alba crosses, Sommer collects confidently.      7.54pm    Portugal win a corner, Guedes curls in ... and Stanek is positive, coming out to claw away.      7.52pm    Havel bundles through the back of Bernardo Silva, who is apparently wanted by Barcelona \u2013 should De Jong depart. I\u2019m not sure quite how that works, given the desire to sell the latter is partly economic and he\u2019s go for less than the former would cost. But he\u2019s a terrific player and would, I\u2019m sure, fit in with how Xavi wants to play.      7.49pm    In Lisbon, William Carvalho nearly of every rich Premier League club but actually of Real Betis has been booked.   Updated at 8.14pm BST    7.47pm    Immediately, Spain nash down the right, forcing Switzerland to belt into touch. Andy Hinchcliffe is in co-comms and and he\u2019s fine, but is there really no one with more intel on these two teams?      7.45pm    Away we go!     7.45pm    Email! \u201cThe inclusion of Busquets is indeed a cause for celebration of his extraordinary skill (and longevity),\u201d reckons Charles Antaki. Morata not so much; more a resigned acceptance that since the days of David Villa/Fernando Torres the national team hasn\u2019t really had any more truly effective goal-getter. Look at the parade since: Negredo, Alc\u00e1cer, Diego Costa, Aspas, Moreno \u2026 I know that even in their 2008-2012 pomp the team tended to win only by 1-0 when in the final knockings of competitons, but otherwise the goals rained in. Bit of a drizzle these days.\u201d Diego Costa was proper, but yes, it\u2019s a strange thing. As it goes, there aren\u2019t that many great centre-forwards anywhere, which is why Man United and Liverpool are fighting over Darwin Nunez, though I will say that the problems Spain\u2019s great team had getting goals was partly because opponents had no choice but to sit back and hope for a counter.      7.40pm    Out come the teams in Geneva and Lisbon.      7.39pm    It\u2019s a shame that Pedri is injured, but I also wonder if a summer off might do him good. He played a ludicrous amount of football last season, and need to be better looked after than he was. What a player he\u2019s going to be; what a player he already is.      7.36pm    This is interesting from Rafael van der Vaart:    Though, let\u2019s be real, should De Jong move to England and enjoy himself as much as Van der Vaart did, he\u2019d be deemed a failure.      7.31pm    I said Portugal don\u2019t have much pace in midfield \u2013 they don\u2019t \u2013 but they\u2019ve also not got much pace in attack. It\u2019s so odd when managers forget that fast running is important - it happened to Ars\u00e8ne Wenger towards the end, when he accumulated interchangeable little lads with good technique, none of whom could get on the outside.      7.27pm    Here\u2019s today\u2019s Fiver for your delectation...      7.22pm    I see that in the UK, Nations League games are on yet another different channel. It\u2019s almost funny really, in almost every field of human endeavour, choice is a good thing, but when it comes to watching sport, the consumer needs and deserves a monopoly.      7.18pm    Looking at that Portugal team \u2013 and bench \u2013 though they were in a difficult group, they really ought to have done better at the Euros. If Mancini manages them, there\u2019s a good chance they win it, and it doesn\u2019t especially look like Fernando Santos is anywhere near finding the answer. Bernardo Silva is wasted on the wing, there\u2019s got to be a place for Bruno Fernandes, and there\u2019s far too little pace in midfield. They should be good enough to win in Qatar too, but they won\u2019t.      7.16pm    I guess that\u2019s a common aspect of genius: simplicity. Roy Keane had a similar trick, turning out of trouble, pivoting by working the outside of his foot around the ball to lose a man. No one could do anything about it, and it set up the brilliance of the passing that followed.      7.12pm    It really is something that in the year 2022, Spain still have Alvaro Morata up front \u2013 just as it is that Sergio Busquets is still in midfield. What a player he is and has been, not as feted as Xavi and Iniesta, but close to as good as so important in allowing them to do what they do. Those little Cruyff turns to get out of trouble, so simple yet so difficult.     7.06pm   Switzerland v Spain: teams!

Yes, it came far too late to save the international game from being devoured by the club version, but it at least saved us from the perpetual purgatory of international friendlies and the 59,037 substitutions that came with them.  So it is than on a Thursday night in June, we\u2019ve actually got some football that\u2019s worth watching, our focus is League A Group 2. Currently, Portugal sit top after drawing in Spain walloping Switzerland, but their visitors tonight, Czech Republic, have four points too having edged Switzerland and also taken a point from Luis Enrique\u2019s men.  That aside, we\u2019ll be keeping tabs on Kosovo v Northern Ireland and Sweden v Serbia, as well as keeping you abreast of all the goals as they go in. And it\u2019s live! Kick-offs: 7.45pm BST  "

                    "body": "  3.40pm   Closing post  The FTSE 100 has dipped back from this morning\u2019s record high, to just below the 7,900 point mark. So it\u2019s time to wrap up \u2013 here are today\u2019s main stories so far:               3.30pm   UK experiences largest loss of purchasing power since mid-1970s  The UK economy has suffered the biggest loss of purchasing power since the 1970s oil crisis, after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine sparked a surge in energy prices. That\u2019s according to new analysis from the Office for National Statistics today. It explains that higher energy and commodity prices on the UK economy has recently reduced the purchasing power of the UK, as the country is a net energy importer. The report shows that the UK\u2019s real domestic income shrank by 0.2% year-on-year in the third quarter of 2022, even though real GDP expanded by 1.9%. The ONS says\u2026  \u2026.which shows the UK experienced a negative terms-of-trade effect in response to the recent energy price shock. That is, there was a decline in how much a unit of UK GDP can purchase on global markets.   The UK wasn\u2019t the only country suffering, as the ONS points out:  European countries have experienced a negative purchasing power effect as net energy importers; Italy, Germany, and Japan experienced a larger negative terms-of-trade effect than the UK in the year to Quarter 3 2022.      3.14pm    The CMA\u2019s provisional ruling today is a real risk to Microsoft\u2019s takeover of Activision, says Ben Barringer, equity research analyst at Quilter Cheviot:   \u201cFollowing Brexit, the Competition and Markets Authority has been keen to put its stamp on things and influence how deals are made. To this point, it has become one of the strictest consumer protection agencies globally. This is important context for the Microsoft-Activision deal and may mean significant changes to the structure of the acquisition are required. Often when one agency rules in a particular direction, others follow suit so it does become a real risk for Microsoft that this deal becomes harder to get through. \u201cThe CMA effectively calls for the divestment of the Call of Duty franchise, as well as some other potential household games, due to Microsoft\u2019s dominance in cloud-based gaming and consoles. It is likely Call of Duty, as well as the likes of World of Warcraft, were key elements of why Microsoft wanted to buy Activision, and it will be interesting to see how to responds and progresses from here. Certainly if Call of Duty were not part of the deal, the value would be significantly impacted. \u201cInterestingly, this ruling has a significant impact for impending deals across the tech sector and shows the CMA will not hesitate to step in if it feels competition is being impeded.\u201d      2.51pm    Shares in Manchester United have jumped by 15% in early trading, after news broke that the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, is interested in buying the club.      2.49pm    Shares in Activision dropped 3% at the open, but are now down 1.7%.      2.48pm    The New York stock market has opened slightly lower, despite hopes that interest rate increases are slowing. The Dow Jones industrial average has dipped by 28 points, or 0.1%, to 34,128 points, while the broader S&amp;P 500 index is 0.25% lower. Shares in Microsoft have jumped 3%, despite the CMA dealing a blow to its hopes of buying Activision. Investors are encouraged by Microsoft\u2019s push in artificial intelligence \u2013 it is revamping its Bing search engine and Edge Web browser with AI, using technology behind the wildly popular ChatGPT service.      2.38pm    Administrators for collapsed airline Flybe have applied for a temporary operating licence, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has announced. This would give the administrators from Interpath the chance to put the regional carrier on a firm footing, but flights would not initially resume. It is the first time the CAA has received an application for a temporary licence from a failed airline, PA Media reports \u2013 and comes almost two weeks after Flybe ceased trading and cancelled all its scheduled flights. A spokesman for the regulator said:   \u201cFlybe\u2019s administrators have applied for a temporary operator\u2019s licence. \u201cIf approved, it would allow the administrators to start the process of restructuring the business. \u201cThe UK Civil Aviation Authority has not yet made a decision on whether to grant a temporary licence. \u201cFlybe\u2019s licence currently remains suspended in accordance with the undertakings given by the administrators.\u201d       2.35pm    Activision Blizzard says it hopes to help Britain\u2019s competition regulator to \u201cbetter understand\u201d the gaming industry, after the CMA ruled today that Microsoft\u2019s takeover could harm gamers. An Activision spokesperson said:  \u201cThese are provisional findings, which means the CMA sets forth its concerns in writing, and both parties have a chance to respond. \u201cWe hope between now and April we will be able to help the CMA better understand our industry to ensure they can achieve their stated mandate to promote an environment where people can be confident they are getting great choices and fair deals, where competitive, fair-dealing business can innovate and thrive, and where the whole UK economy can grow productively and sustainably.\u201d      2.25pm    Workers employed by the City of London Corporation are being balloted on whether to hold strike action in a long running pay dispute. The Unite union say the City of London Corporation, which is the local authority for the City of London, has imposed a pay increase for 2022 worth just three per cent, on average. With RPI inflation at 13.4%, that is a \u201csubstantial real terms pay cut\u201d, Unite says. Ballot papers are being sent to members from today, with the ballot closing on Wednesday 15 March. If workers support taking industrial action then strikes could begin before the end of next month.  Unite regional officer Nick West says the City of London Corporation can fully afford to deliver a pay rise.  West adds:  Our members\u2019 are being forced to use food banks and borrow money to pay bills. All of this is happening whilst the corporation spends hundreds of thousands on lavish entertainment for the wealthy. Unite has exhausted every avenue of negotiation and, for the first time in the union\u2019s history, are balloting our members at the City of London Corporation for industrial action over pay. Our members are united in the demand for fair pay and are prepared to take industrial action, halting the City\u2019s key services until the corporation puts forward an acceptable offer.\u201d       2.00pm   Uber stock rises after earnings as company gives upbeat outlook  Ride-sharing company Uber has reported its strongest quarter on record, as demand rebounded as pandemic restrictions were rolled back. Uber has reported adjusted profits, on an EBITDA basis, of $665m, an increase of $579m year-on-year. Gross Bookings grew 19% year-over-year, with \u2018Mobility\u2019 bookings (journeys) up 31% and \u2018Delivery\u2019 (such as food orders) rising 6% year-on-year. \u201cWe ended 2022 with our strongest quarter ever, with robust demand and record margins,\u201d said Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber\u2019s CEO, adding:  \u201cOur global scale and unique platform advantages position us well to accelerate this momentum into 2023.\u201d  Last year, a global investigation revealed how Uber broke the law, duped police and regulators, and secretly lobbied governments across the world. Today, the company says it is confident of growth in the current quarter. It predicts gross bookings will grow by 20% to 24% year-on-year in Q1 2023, and expects adjusted EBITDA of $660m to $700m. Nelson Chai, Ubers\u2019s CFO, says the company \u201csignificantly exceeded\u201d its profitability outlook last year. Chai adds:  \u201cOur outlook for a Gross Bookings and Adjusted EBITDA step up in Q1 builds on that progress, and sets us up for yet another record year.\u201d  Shares in Uber are up almsot 8% in pre-market trading.      1.36pm    Microsoft has said it was committed to addressing the concerns raised by Britain\u2019s competition regulator about its acquisition of \u201cCall of Duty\u201d maker Activision Blizzard today. Rima Alaily, MS\u2019s corporate vice-president and deputy general counsel, says:  \u201cWe are committed to offering effective and easily enforceable solutions that address the CMA\u2019s concerns.\u201d \u201cOur commitment to grant long-term 100% equal access to \u2018Call of Duty\u2019 to Sony, Nintendo, Steam and others preserves the deal\u2019s benefits to gamers and developers and increases competition in the market.\u201d      1.34pm    Her\u2019es our news story on the UK\u2019s competition regulator\u2019s ruling that Microsoft\u2019s $68.7bn (\u00a359.6bn) deal to buy Activision Blizzard, the video game publisher behind hits including Call of Duty, will result in higher prices and less competition for UK gamers.      1.05pm    Shares in Activision Blizzard have dropped by 4% in pre-market trading. They\u2019re down to $72.70.The stock had already been trading at a substantial discount to the $95 per share value of Microsoft\u2019s offer, given concerns that regulators might block the deal.  Updated at 1.05pm GMT    1.01pm    Back in the City of London, the FTSE 100 has climbed to a new alltime intraday high. The index touched 7934.30 points, as traders continue to grasp hopes that inflation is easing, meaning borrowing costs could soon peak. George Lagarias, chief economist at Mazars, says investors should be cautions, though.:   \u201cThe FTSE 100 broke yet another record, as a result of the general global equity rally. Despite the buoyancy, investors need to stop for a moment and think: what is driving positive sentiment?  Presently, it\u2019s really one single factor: the belief that we are at, or very close to, peak interest rates. However, none of the major central banks have yet actually confirmed that they are pausing rate hikes. Given that we are in the midst of an economic slowdown, and possibly a recession, we would approach the rally with optimism, but also a lot of caution.\u201d      12.28pm    The CMA\u2019s ruling come just hours after the head of Activision accused Sony of \u201ctrying to sabotage\u201d Microsoft\u2019s takeover. Bobby Kotick, the Activision chief executive, also told the Financial Times that a \u201cfragile\u201d UK government could miss a post-Brexit opportunity to attract thousands of jobs if it blocks Microsoft\u2019s acquisition of Activision Blizzard (as the CMA is indeed threatening to do). Kotick told the FT that UK prime minister Rishi Sunak is \u201csmart\u201d and \u201cunderstands business\u201d, Kotick said, adding that the UK government seemed to lack leadership. He added:  \u201cIf I look at our hiring plans, we\u2019re more likely to find the next 3,000 to 5,000 people that we need in the UK than almost any other country.\u201d  Kotick also denied that the deal would hurt competition (as the CMA fears), saying:  \u201cThe whole idea that we are not going to support a PlayStation or that Microsoft would not support the PlayStation, it is absurd.\u201d      12.17pm   CMA: Microsoft-Activision Blizzard deal would hurt competition and harm gamers   Breaking: the UK\u2019s competition watchdog has provisionally concluded that Microsoft\u2019s proposed $69bn takeover of computer games maker Activision Blizzard could result in higher prices, fewer choices, and less innovation for UK gamers. In the provisional findings of its inquiry into the deal, just released, the Competition and Markets Authority has warned that the deal would result in a substantial lessening of competition in gaming consoles and cloud gaming services in the UK. Microsoft announced in January 2022 that it would pay $68.7bn in cash for Activision, the firm behind Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush.  Today, the CMA says that in the gaming console world, Microsoft\u2019s Xbox and Sony\u2019s PlayStation compete closely with each other, and that Activision\u2019s Call of Duty (CoD) is important to the competitive offering of each. Microsoft, it fears, could restrict Call of Duty on the PlayStation. The CMA says:  The evidence suggests that, after the Merger, Microsoft would find it commercially beneficial to make CoD exclusive to Xbox or available on Xbox on materially better terms than on PlayStation. We provisionally found that this would substantially reduce competition in gaming consoles to the detriment of gamers\u2014Xbox and PlayStation gamers alike\u2014which could result in higher prices, reduced range, lower quality, worse service, and/or reduced innovation.  The regulator also has concerns over cloud gaming services \u2013 fearing that Microsoft could make Activision\u2019s titles exclusive to its own cloud gaming service, or available there on materially better terms than on rival cloud gaming services. They say:  We provisionally found that, after the Merger, Microsoft would find it commercially beneficial to make Activision\u2019s titles exclusive to its own cloud gaming service or available there on materially better terms than on rival cloud gaming services.  The CMA suggests that it could block the merger. Alternatively, it could requiring a partial divestiture of Activision Blizzard, which could mean the sale of the business associated with Call of Duty, or the sale of either the Activision or the Blizzard segments of the company.  Updated at 12.31pm GMT    11.23am   Price of diesel falls below 170p per litre for first time since March 2022  The price of a litre of diesel has fallen below 170p for the first time since last March, in a boost to some motorists and businesses. Figures from data company Experian show UK forecourts were charging an average of 169.9p per litre on Monday. It is the first time the price has been cheaper than 170p in 11 months, since the invasion of Ukraine drove up fuel prices. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said:   \u201cThis is good news for drivers of diesel vehicles as they have had to endure some tough times with the average price of a litre nearly hitting \u00a32 at the end of June. Since then the price has tumbled 30p, saving more than \u00a316 on a full tank. But, if retailers play fair with drivers, the price should fall further still as the wholesale price is now back to a level last seen around the time Russia invaded Ukraine. Even with retailers taking a higher than average margin of 10p a litre, the price of diesel should really be 10p lower at 160p.\u201d       11.18am   Network Rail boss suggests Grant Shapps \u2018galvanised\u2019 workers to strike  The boss of Network Rail has suggested that government minister Grant Shapps \u201cgalvanised\u201d rail workers into continuing strike action when he was transport secretary through \u201cnoisy political rhetoric\u201d. Andrew Haines said negotiations with trade unions have been conducted in a less confrontational and more \u201cmeasured tone\u201d since Mark Harper took on the role in October last year. Widespread strikes over jobs, pay and conditions began in June 2022, when Mr Shapps was transport secretary. Last June, Shapps accused the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union of a \u201ctotal lie\u201d over claims that he disrupted negotiations. In July, Shapps said the power of \u201cthese very militant, extreme-Left unions\u201d to cause disruption should be curbed. Asked whether Harper and his rail minister, Huw Merriman, have \u201cchanged the narrative with the unions\u201d, Mr Haines said:   \u201cThey have taken some of the more robust rhetoric out and said \u2018We\u2019re prepared to talk, we\u2019re prepared to meet\u2019. \u201cThe conversations are equally direct and blunt but they\u2019re done in a measured tone that isn\u2019t confrontational. \u201cThe underlying realities haven\u2019t changed but what that\u2019s allowed us to do is avoid the distraction. \u201cIt\u2019s a harsh reality that, however well-intentioned, noisy political rhetoric, if anything it galvanised the workforce against settling.\u201d  Haines made the comments during a question and answer session last night, after Harper gave the rail industry\u2019s annual George Bradshaw address in central London. The previous approach created a \u201cthem and us approach\u201d and \u201cdemonised\u201d rail workers, Haines said, adding:  \u201cI\u2019ve seen a very material change in the sentiment among Network Rail colleagues because the heat\u2019s been taken out. \u201cHowever well-intentioned, bashing people up in the newspapers doesn\u2019t work if you want to get people to vote for something.\u201d  Shapps moved to run the BEIS department in October, and was yesterday named as the head of a new Department for Energy Security and Net Zero.     10.48am   Turkey\u2019s stock market halts trading after main index drops 7%  Trading on Turkey\u2019s stock market has been suspended this morning after the country\u2019s benchmark equities index fell 7 per cent. Stocks dropped sharply again on Wednesday, following heavy losses on Tuesday after Turkey and Syria were hit by a devastating earthquake that has killed thousands of people. The Bist 100, which contains the hundred largest companies listed on the Borsa \u0130stanbul, has been suspended after dropping 7%. The index twice tripped a \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d that is in place to calm trading this morning.   Turkey\u2019s Borsa Istanbul says:  \u201cTrading in Equity Market and Single Stock &amp; Index Futures and Options Contracts in the Derivatives Market has been suspended.\u201d  The stock market operator did not say when trade would resume. According to Bloomberg, this is the first time that Turkey\u2019s stock exchange has suspended trading in 24 years. Last night, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan declared a state of emergency in areas hit by the region\u2019s worst earthquake in decades.  The earthquake has also put pressure on the turkish lira, which has tumbled to a record low this week. The lira weakened last year as Turkey\u2019s central bank cut interest rates several times, which helped to push Turkey\u2019s inflation rate to a 24-year high of 85.5% in October. The earthquake will add to Turkey\u2019s economic pressures. Md. Shabbir Ansari, senior insurance analyst at GlobalData, says:  \u201cThe preliminary estimate of economic loss due to the current catastrophic event is more than $1.0 billion, and it will take years for Turkish insurers to settle the insured losses. The economic loss is expected to be more than two times the losses from a similar earthquake in 2020.  Emergency services are continuing to search for survivers from the earthquakes. And today, a container blaze at Turkey\u2019s southern port of Iskenderun has been brought under control (our liveblog reports).     10.20am    The FTSE 100 continues to hit new alltime highs this morning, and just touched 7928 points, up 0.8% today. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has soothed the markets with his comments last night about inflation easing, says AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould.  \u201cConcerns that last Friday\u2019s bumper jobs report would see the Fed react to what it perceived as an overheating labour market were eased, with Powell\u2019s relatively relaxed response possibly reflecting the seasonal anomalies which often affect the January numbers. \u201cWhether Powell will remain so relaxed if the next set of payroll figures are similarly elevated is open to question and investors will be keeping a close eye on next week\u2019s US inflation figures for January. If there is any sign of a renewed uptick in prices, then the market would likely respond very negatively. \u201cFor now, the positive sentiment has allowed the FTSE 100 to reach new sunny uplands, hitting a fresh all-time high. Now the milestone has been achieved though there may be a bit of an inquest into why it has taken the FTSE 100 so long when many of its global counterparts were making records years ago.\u201d      10.12am   Maersk forecasts plunge in profits as container shipping boom ends   Shipping group A.P. Moller-Maersk has warned this morning that its profits will tumble this year as the transportation sector cools. Maersk predicted that lower container volumes and freight rates would drive a roughly four-fold plunge in profits this year, after reporting record earnings for 2022. Maersk benefitted from the jump in freight rates as in the pandemic, due to the surge in consumer demand and supply chain problems such as logjams at ports. In its annual report, Maersk predicts that the global ocean container market could contract by as much as 2.5% this year, if global GDP growth remains muted. It predicts underlying profits of between $8.0 and $11.0, down from the record $36.8bn recorded in 2022. Vincent Clerc, Maersk\u2019s new chief executive, has told the Financial Times that its customers, who include most of the world\u2019s largest retailers, had over-ordered during the congestion of recent years. That\u2019s led to a glut now, meaning less demand for container shipments. As Clerc puts it  \u201cWhen this congestion goes away, you get more goods, your warehouses are full, your inventory is high.\u201d   Updated at 10.12am GMT    9.36am    European shares have hit their highest level in over nine months this morning. Investors are cheered by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s remarks overnight about inflation starting to ease. German gas giant Linde and Dutch paints maker Akzo Nobel have jumped 2.4% and 6.5%, respectively, after giving higher 2023 earnings forecasts, Reuters flags. In CopenHagen, the OMX share index has hit a record high.      9.29am    The pound is also having a decent morning, up half a cent against the US dollar to $1.2095. Yesterday sterling hit a one-month low against the dollar, but is perkier today as the dollar languishe on the back foot. Hopes that US inflation is easing are hitting the dollar, as Ricardo Evangelista, senior analyst at ActivTrades explains:  The greenback\u2019s weakness started late on Tuesday, after a public address by the Federal Reserve Chairman, Jerome Powell, who mentioned that interest rates may end up climbing higher than previously thought but also acknowledged an ongoing disinflation process. The markets chose to focus on the second part of Powell\u2019s message, finding reasons to be cheerful in the fact that the Fed remains data dependent and therefore a pause, and even a monetary policy pivot in the not-too-distant future, could still be on the cards should inflation continue to stabilise. With moderate optimism returning to the markets, the US dollar lost ground to other major currencies, halting the rally that followed Friday\u2019s monster jobs report.      9.20am         9.13am    UK equity markets remain on the front foot today, says Neil Wilson of Markets.com. Wilson says China\u2019s economic reopening has lifted the FTSE 100, and predicts the index could soon reach 8,000 points. He adds:  Bulls pushed the FTSE 100 to a new record intraday high at 7,926 in early trading as investors continue to shrug off just about most things. 8,000 looks assured.   Updated at 9.25am GMT    9.12am    The UK\u2019s smaller share index, the FTSE 250, has jumped by over 1% this morning. The FTSE 250, which is more domestically-focused than the FTSE 100, is approaching the 10-month highs it reached last week.     8.47am    Optimism that China\u2019s relaxation of Covid restrictions has also pushed the FTSE 100 index higher in recent weeks. The share index is packed with major multinationals, such as mining companies and financial stocks, whose fortunes could benefit from a pick-up in China\u2019s economy, after it weakened in 2022. China\u2019s slowdown in growth is \u201calmost certainly behind it\u201d, predicts Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at trading firm OANDA, adding:  In fact, the transition from zero-Covid to living with it is reportedly going very smoothly which could boost the economy earlier and by more than expected, leading to higher growth forecasts for 2023. While that could support the global economy through a difficult period, it may also worsen the inflation problem due to much higher demand for commodities including crude oil. Oil prices have been trending higher in recent days on these improved forecasts, although they still remain around the middle of the range they\u2019ve traded within since early December.      8.34am    Oil giant BP is the top riser on the FTSE 100 this morning, up 3.2%. BP shares have hit 533.5p, the highest since August 2019. Yesterday BP smashed its annual profits record, with earnings more than doubling to $27.7bn (\u00a323bn) as fossil fuel prices soared following Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. BP also lifted its shareholder dividend by 10%, and slowed its plans to cut oil and gas production.      8.09am   FTSE 100 hits new record  Newsflash: The UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index has hit a new alltime high at the start of trading in London. The blue-chip share index has hit 7926 points, as it surges over the record high set on Friday (which was the first since 2018). As explained in the opening post, the rally comes as hopes build that the UK economy could fare better in 2023 than feared, with the NIESR thinktank predicting a recession could be avoided. Shares are also benefiting from hopes that central banks could end their interest rate increases soon. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, tells us:  The FTSE 100 has hit a record high again, surpassing Friday\u2019s peak. Following a wobbly start to the week in which global equities were hit by concerns about a more hawkish path from the Fed after a strong US jobs report as well as heightened US-Sino tensions, the UK large-cap index has restored its bullish momentum. Yesterday Fed Chair Jerome Powell said inflation is easing, raising hopes that the US could be approaching the peak for interest rates. A strong close on Wall Street with the Nasdaq closing up by 1.9% has helped drive a positive start to the European session. Over a one-year period, Pearson is the best performing stock on the FTSE 100 followed by BAE Systems and Antofagasta. Over the past one month, JD Sports is the top performer with IAG and 3i in second and third place. The pound is trading higher against the greenback driven by US dollar weakness against most European currencies today following Powell\u2019s relatively hopeful remarks about the outlook for US inflation.\u201d   Updated at 8.21am GMT    7.44am    Charlie Huggins, Head of Equities at Wealth Club, says the housing market is very difficult to call right now.  There has clearly been a marked slowdown in housing market activity in the last six months. Faced with higher mortgage costs and soaring bills, it\u2019s no surprise that new home buyers are exercising greater caution. Barratt has responded by battening down the hatches, significantly reducing land approvals and placing restrictions on hiring and new site openings. This is sensible in the circumstances. However, the picture is not looking as grim as it was back in the Autumn, following the disastrous mini budget. Despite rising interest rates, mortgage rates have fallen in recent months due to intense competition between lenders. And there is a growing sense that interest rates are close to peaking. If that turns out to be the case, confidence in the housing market could quickly return.      7.39am    David Thomas, chief executive of Barratt Developments, warns that the economic background has \u201cclearly been challenging\u201d for housebuilders. Thomas tells shareholders this morning:  \u201cWe have delivered a strong operating performance for the six months to 31 December 2022. This was possible because of our significant forward order book at 30 June 2022 and the tremendous efforts of our employees, sub-contractors and supply chain partners. However, the economic backdrop has clearly been challenging and consumer confidence weakened significantly during the half, which meant we saw lower reservation rates for future sales - particularly in the second quarter. Whilst we have seen some early signs of improvement in current trading during January, we will need to see continued momentum over the coming months before we can be confident that these challenging trading conditions are easing.      7.38am   Barratt: Marked slowdown in UK housing market  Britain\u2019s largest homebuilder, Barratt Developments, is warning this morning that high mortgage rates are hitting the housing market, as demand slows. Barratt\u2019s latest half-year results, for the six months to 31 December 2022, also show that the drop in UK house prices has hit its sales and profit margins, as its costs also rise. Barratt reports that there was a \u201cmarked slowdown in the UK housing market\u201d in the first half of its financial year (the second half of 2022), as the mini-budget hit confidence and drove up borrowing costs. The company tells the City:  Political and economic uncertainty impacted the first quarter; this was then compounded by rapid and significant changes in mortgage rates which reduced affordability, homebuyer confidence and reservation activity through the second quarter.  Barratt completed 8,626 homes in the second half of last year, a 6.9% increase on a year earlier. Gross profits rose 15.2%, but its gross profit margins dropped to 23.3% from 25% in the six months to 2021.  Demand has been weaker in 2023, although Barratt does say that trading has picked up a little in January. In January, Barratt\u2019s net private reservations per active outlet per average week has fallen by 45%, due to \u201cmore tentative demand\u201d. This slowdown prompted the company to freeze hiring in January. Forward sales are down too. On 29th January, they were 10,854 homes, worth \u00a32.665bn, compared with over 15,000 at 30 January 2022 (which were worth \u00a34,109.7m).  Yesterday, Halifax reported that UK house prices were roughly flat in January, having fallen in the previous four months.      7.37am   Introduction: UK may avoid recession, as FTSE 100 heads towards record  Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 share index is heading back towards last Friday\u2019s record high, as hopes build that the UK economy could avoid a recession. The blue-chip index is rallying in premarket trading, and on track to open just below Friday\u2019s intraday record high of 7906.58 points. This would extend the Footsie\u2019s gains in 2023, as stock markets rally on hopes that central banks will slow, or stop, their interest rate increases soon. Last night, the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, warned, though, that more US interest rates rise will be needed to cool inflation and the red-hot US jobs market. \u201cWe think we are going to need to do further rate increases,\u201d Powell said on Tuesday at the Economic Club of Washington. \u201cThe labor market is extraordinarily strong.\u201d  Investors were cheered, though, that Powell said he US was in the \u201cvery early stages of disinflation.\u201d European markets are also set for a higher open, as shares continue to rally in 2023.  The FTSE 100 is dominated by multinational companies, so its strength does not reflect the UK\u2019s economic state. But there are hopes that Britain may avoid a recession this year, despite the gloomy forecasts from the Bank of England and the International Monetary Fund. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) predicts this morning that the UK economy will grow marginally in 2023 despite high prices hitting household budgets. But it warned while the UK may not fall into recession, it will feel like one for at least seven million households. According to NIESR, households in Britain will suffer a hit to their finances of up to \u00a34,000 this year, with low and middle-income households facing the biggest financial hit from the cost of living crisis.

                    "body": "1) Have Barkley\u2019s best years gone to waste?\nChelsea\u2019s Abramovich era has launched the careers of many promising footballers into the stratosphere. It has also halted a few in their tracks. Steve Sidwell, Scott Parker and Danny Drinkwater all left clubs where they were hot properties to sign for Chelsea, where they spent varying portions of their prime years watching blankly from the dugout. To this list we can add Ross Barkley, trusted to take a penalty but nothing more on Saturday by a manager for whom he has played 428 minutes this season. Five years after moving to west London, Barkley has started fewer league games for Chelsea than he did in his final season at Everton, and has had as many managers as he has scored league goals. Not every talented youngster will fulfil their potential; not every transfer will be a success. But it\u2019s hard to think back to Barkley\u2019s breakout years and not lament the scattergun stockpiling in which football\u2019s super-clubs can afford to indulge. Alex Hess\n\nMatch report: Chelsea 0-0 Liverpool (5-6 pens)\n\n\n2) Destiny still lies in Burnley\u2019s grasp\nTwo straight defeats have taken Burnley back into the relegation zone and Thursday\u2019s visit to Aston Villa has assumed monumental proportions. There was room for optimism in a battling performance at Tottenham that arguably deserved a draw, though. \u201cI am really proud of the group,\u201d Mike Jackson said. \u201cThey had a right go today. I\u2019ve seen a group that was fighting and had spirit.\u201d A point at Villa Park will keep their fate in their hands. Jackson will have to decide whether to stick with the five-man back line that largely blunted Spurs, or whether to be more expansive and go for the early goal that might make life considerably easier. There is the added complication that, unusually, they played Villa at home nine days ago and were well beaten. Jackson must get the formula right but has shown an ability to set up a team that can handle the fight. Nick Ames\n\nMatch report: Tottenham 1-0 Burnley\n\n3) Talismanic Zaha still willing to take the bait\nWilfried Zaha is enjoying fruitful times. As his powers peak, so do his returns. More finisher than creator now, Zaha\u2019s 13 league goals this season is a career high. His previous best (11) came last year. But that less welcome part of his game \u2013 the side that sees him engage with baying crowds \u2013 remains. At Villa Park, Zaha did so with a beaming smile but it is still energy best channelled elsewhere. \u201cThis is part of Wilfried, his character, his personality,\u201d explained Patrick Vieira. \u201cIt is a strength and a weakness at the same time. He is a target player and has to manage his mind, to keep that energy, that strength to allow him to make the difference in the last third.\u201d Vieira knows that when Zaha mismanages things, life becomes easier for his opponents. \u201cIt\u2019s a sideshow,\u201d Steven Gerrard said. \u201cHe had a really quiet afternoon. We dealt with him really well.\u201d Sam Dalling\n\nMatch report: Aston Villa 1-1 Crystal Palace\n\n\n4) Struijk gives Leeds hope and belief\nPascal Struijk\u2019s added-time equaliser for Leeds not only changes the dynamics surrounding the final week of the relegation battle but the entire mentality around Elland Road. Just a few minutes before Struijk scrambled home Joe Gelhardt\u2019s cross, deafening renditions of Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s name could be heard before the home supporters turned their ire on the board. It threatened to overshadow the bigger challenge at hand for Leeds, given how sacking Bielsa in February remains an incredible gamble that remains grossly unpopular with large swathes of Leeds fans. But as Struijk headed home and Elland Road erupted, the mood changed, as did the permutations. Burnley could change the whole script again if they get a result at Aston Villa on Thursday night but for the first time in a few weeks, Leeds supporters can look at the table with tentative confidence. If momentum really is a thing in sport then Struijk, the unlikeliest of heroes, has ensured Leeds have at least a sliver of it with one game remaining. Aaron Bower\n\nMatch report: Leeds 1-1 Brighton\n\n\n5) Daka must step up to phase out Vardy\nIt\u2019s been a strange season for Leicester. Last year\u2019s FA Cup win came off the back of two strong league campaigns, and it looked like a young, talented, improving squad would push on again. But though things haven\u2019t turned out like that, they haven\u2019t wasted their time. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall has established himself, James Maddison has rediscovered himself \u2013 and Harvey Barnes \u2013 scorer of two fine goals \u2013 is a better player now than in August. But at some point soon, and despite his brace, they must replace Jamie Vardy. In an ideal world, his role from now on would be as rotation player and impact sub. The question is whether Patson Daka is ready to step up. Though he has shown flashes of immense ability \u2013 at both Leicester and RB Salzburg \u2013 he has struggled in recent months. The onus is now on him to find the consistency it\u2019ll take to displace a club legend. Daniel Harris\n\u2022 Match report: Watford 1-5 Leicester\n\n6) Fernandinho struggles in emergency role\nManchester City\u2019s injury worries in defence are well documented, but it was interesting last week to see Fernandinho support the idea that youngsters CJ Egan-Riley and Lucas Mbete deserved some game time in the title run-in. At West Ham, Pep Guardiola opted for experience, with Fernandinho starting at centre-back. The Brazilian is a legend at City but increasingly looking like a weak link, with Michail Antonio and Jarrod Bowen exposing the 37-year-old on the counter. Both West Ham\u2019s goals capitalised on the space in behind and Fernandinho was also wasteful with the ball, including a poor back-pass that might have led to a third Hammers goal. Fernandinho deserves some sort of send-off before his return to Brazil this summer but it would be a shock to see him deployed in defence again for City\u2019s crucial final game against Aston Villa. Michael Butler\n\nMatch report: West Ham 2-2 Manchester City\n\n7) Wolves must remedy scoring problems\nIt\u2019s hard to know what to make of Wolves. They\u2019re far more enjoyable to watch under Bruno Lage than they were when Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo was in charge. And yet 37 goals in 37 games \u2013 the fewest of any side outside the bottom three \u2013 is almost as miserable as last season\u2019s 36 in 38, the lowest outside the bottom four. Something has to change, and Lage will hope he has the internal solutions. After 10 months out with injury, Pedro Neto is back, and will be much the better for a full pre-season. But the form of Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez must be a worry, his 44 appearances yielding only nine goals, eight yellow cards, and two red cards. The hope is that he is building back confidence and sharpness after a long time out as a result of a potentially life-threatening head injury, but if he does not start next season well, his manager will \u2013 reluctantly, no doubt \u2013 need an alternative. Daniel Harris\n\u2022 Match report: Wolves 1-1 Norwich\n\n8) Chaos threatens to drag Everton down\nJust when it seemed Everton had edged their way to safety, they returned to the farce that has dragged them down all season. Two red cards and some desperate defending left Frank Lampard\u2019s team needing something from Thursday at home to Crystal Palace and next Sunday at Arsenal to stay ahead of Burnley and Leeds. In the Goodison stands, Joe Royle and Peter Reid, both playing legends, with Royle a former manager, looked on, while the chairman, Bill Kenwright, looked positively tortured alongside them. Each of those famous Evertonians would recognise the mayhem that can grip their beloved club. It had briefly seemed that Lampard had harnessed the chaos, and Everton fans have responded warmly enough to his leadership. But his team still have no recognisable approach and lack discipline. Burnley\u2019s and Leeds\u2019s problems mean Everton will probably survive but a tough close-season awaits. Farce, chaos and mayhem rarely add up to sustained success. John Brewin\n\u2022 Match report: Everton 2-3 Brentford\n9) England\u2019s women\u2019s team blessed with riches\nThe England coach, Sarina Wiegman, was at Wembley on Sunday and will surely have learned far more from this high-stakes FA Cup final than any number of bloodless qualifiers. Keira Walsh and Alex Greenwood both excelled in defeat for Manchester City; Millie Bright and Jess Carter both advanced their cases for Chelsea. But the real bright spot was City winger Lauren Hemp, who feels increasingly pivotal to England\u2019s chances this summer. The next big women\u2019s game at Wembley will be the Euro 2022 final. Will England be there? Jonathan Liew\n\nMatch report: Chelsea 3-2 Manchester City\n\n\n10) Reds harness history into shootout success\nIn August 1974, Liverpool beat Leeds United 6-5 on penalties to win the Charity Shield \u2013 the first of 26 shootouts in which they\u2019ve competed. Of those, a quite ridiculous 19 have been won, including two European Cup finals, two FA Cup finals and three League Cup finals. Two of them have come this season, at the end of goalless draws against Chelsea. On the face of things, what happened in, say, Rome in 1984 has nothing whatsoever to do with what happened at Wembley on Saturday. But an overall success rate of 73.08% cannot possibly be a coincidence, and instead speaks volumes about Liverpool\u2019s mythology and self-mythologising \u2013 veins into which J\u00fcrgen Klopp has tapped so astutely. Of course, all professional footballers are capable of beating a goalkeeper with a free shot from 12 yards, but Klopp has given those who play for him confidence, entitlement and aggression, their sense of history and destiny bordering on the messianic \u2013 and they are not finished yet.

David Loughnane\u2019s colt was less than a length behind Perfect Power in last season\u2019s Middle Park and within three of El Caballo in the Sandy Lane despite a stumble at the start that meant he could not get anywhere close to the lead.\nHe has winning form over track and trip in April, in a decent time too, and a swift exit from the gates should put him right in the mix.\nRoyal Ascot 2.30 Mawj was friendless in the betting before her debut at Newmarket in May but stormed nearly five lengths clear of a subsequent winner and should improve for the experience.\nRoyal Ascot 3.40 Just Fine would be a popular winner in the Queen\u2019s colours but his overall form does not justify his status as favourite and the fast-improving Contact makes more appeal at around 9-1.\n\nRoyal Ascot 4.20 Inspiral, the winter favourite for the 1,000 Guineas, was ruled out a week before the Classic and looks a shaky favourite for this Group One with no recent form in the book. Prosperous Voyage, a neck behind Cachet in the Guineas and the type to progress with racing this season, is a fair bet at around 10-1 to reverse the Newmarket form and get off the mark at Group One level.\nRoyal Ascot 5.00 Fresh Hope won in an excellent time at Doncaster last month and can give Charlie Fellowes a third success in this race in the past four years.\nRoyal Ascot 5.35 Fast-improving Ottoman Fleet could well find enough progress to beat Changingoftheguard, fifth home in the Derby last time.\nRoyal Ascot 6.10 Sterling Knight is dropping back to the minimum trip but quickened to lead well over a furlong out over six here last time and looks the type to make further progress."

                    "body": "As tourists at the Hooksiel resort on Germany\u2019s North Sea coastline lean back in their wicker beach chairs or stomp around the mud flats, the jetty that stretches for 1.3km into the ocean to their right is a familiar sight. The frantic clanging of metal on metal at its furthest tip, however, is new. Built in 1982, the jetty was designed to host not just two import terminals for chemicals but also one for liquefied natural gas (LNG), shipped in on tankers from the US. With cheap Russian gas beating LNG for price, those tankers never arrived. Two adjacent plots of land, reclaimed from the North Sea to make space for industry, instead attracted rare warblers and bitterns. But as Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine upends decades of German energy policy, getting LNG tankers to dock on the Hooksiel jetty is suddenly a matter of national priority. Wilhelmshaven, the nearby historic port city, has become emblematic of a two-fold, seemingly contradictory promise made by Germany\u2019s government: that it can import LNG to compensate for throttled gas imports from Russia at record speed, belying a reputation for bureaucratic plodding; and that the jetty into the North Sea will carry LNG \u2013 a polluting fossil fuel \u2013 for only a short time, soon to be replaced with a more climate-friendly substitute. Wilhelmshaven is one of five floating LNG terminals Germany is rushing to build by the end of the year, creating infrastructure that a study in July by the Fraunhofer Institute argued would be vital to avoid cold homes and closed factories this winter not just in Germany but across all of Europe as Vladimir Putin turns off the tap. The H\u00f6egh Esperanza, a 300-metre long tanker converted into a Floating Storage and Regasification Unit and chartered by the German government at a mooted cost of \u20ac200,000 a day, will dock at the jetty and turn liquid back into gas at a rate of about 10 hours per tanker load. Roughly 80 tankers are expected to arrive at Wilhelmshaven each year, substituting half of the gas imports the German energy company Uniper used to have from Russia, or 8% of Germany\u2019s overall gas usage before the start of the war. Shortly after Russian troops crossed on to Ukrainian soil in the spring, the talk was that building LNG terminals would take three to five years. Now politicians are confident the terminal and its connecting pipeline can be built in seven months, with works finishing on 21 December and gas flowing the day after.  Uniper, which is managing the build, is only slightly more cautious, saying windy weather in the colder months could yet delay completion until the second half of the winter. Behind-schedule building projects, such as Berlin\u2019s new airport and Hamburg\u2019s Elbphilharmonie concert hall, have in recent years busted myths of German efficiency. The LNG terminals are trying to buck the trend by instead emulating the model behind the creation of Tesla\u2019s new Gigafactory in Brandenburg, with building works already starting while permit applications are still being scrutinised. \u201cEverything that\u2019s usually done step by step, we are now doing in parallel,\u201d said Holger Kreetz, Uniper\u2019s chief operating officer for asset management, on a boat trip to the far end of the Hooksiel jetty at the start of the week. Environmental impact assessments, usually a requisite step, are simply being skipped. The economic affairs minister, Robert Habeck, a Green party politician and self-proclaimed \u201cbiggest porpoise fan in the government\u201d, has shrugged off concerns that building works could disturb the endangered aquatic mammals basking in Jade Bay. Ensuring Germany was no longer blackmailable by Putin had to take priority, he said. Germany\u2019s about-face from Russian natural gas pipelines to shipped-in LNG will not just test the political credibility of the Greens. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to admit, but we probably wouldn\u2019t have got around to building these terminals so quickly if it wasn\u2019t for the war,\u201d said Olaf Lies, the centre-left Social Democrat environment minister for the state of Lower Saxony. \u201cTo an extent, what is happening in Wilhelmshaven now also shows up the political failures of the past. We got too comfortable and neglected other projects we should have tackled.\u201d The hope is that Europe\u2019s energy crisis could be an opportunity to take strides towards a greener future rather than be a setback for its climate targets, said Lies, who insisted that the Hooksiel jetty would host a \u201cmolecule terminal\u201d rather than one specific to LNG.  As Germany has committed to being greenhouse gas-neutral by 2045, the pipelines on the North Sea coast would soon not be pumping LNG but green hydrogen, produced by using renewable electricity to drive an electrolyser that splits water into hydrogen and oxygen, Lies said in an interview. Some of the green hydrogen would be produced in Wilhelmshaven, where Uniper is converting a phased-out coal plant into an electrolyser. The rest would be imported via the new terminal infrastructure. Open Grid Europe, the company connecting the terminal to the national gas grid, said its pipelines were 100% hydrogen-compatible barring some additional insulation before a switch over. Tests are proceeding to establish whether a natural underground salt dome outside Wilhelmshaven, where German emergency crude oil supplies have been stored since the 1970s, could hold hydrogen. \u201cThe big energy exporters of tomorrow aren\u2019t going to be those countries rich in natural gas, but the ones that have plenty of wind, sun and water,\u201d Lies said, painting a picture of his home town\u2019s reinvention as a renewable energy hub for imports from Australia, South America and Africa. \u201cGreen Wilhelmshaven\u201d brochures have already been printed. Among Wilhelmshaven\u2019s residents some scepticism remains. The coastal city north of Bremen is a place of superlatives: the largest hub for Germany\u2019s military, which coordinates its maritime forces from here; the country\u2019s only German deepwater port; and the largest import terminal for crude oil, pumped all the way down into the industrial heartland in the Rhine valley. It was here that a sailors\u2019 revolt against the Kaiser\u2019s orders in October 1918 set off a chain of events that swept away the old German empire. But triumphant highs in Wilhelmshaven\u2019s history have been swiftly followed usually by humiliating lows. After emerging as a pirate stronghold in the 14th century its fortress was destroyed by the Hanseatic League. Flourishing as the hub of the German imperial navy under the rule of Kaiser Wilhelm II, it was cut down to size by the restrictions of the Versailles Treaty. After Hitler used Wilhelmshaven town square to denounce the naval agreement with Britain came Allied bombs, destroying two-thirds of the city\u2019s residential buildings. The city\u2019s unemployment rates have still not recovered from the closure of the typewriter maker Olympia in 1991 and a loss of almost 3,000 jobs. Floating LNG terminals are unlikely to change that, since they come with their own trained staff; one official put the number of jobs created at no more than 20. While the new terminal will not spoil the vista from Wilhelmshaven\u2019s S\u00fcdstrand tourist spot, or stink out the seaside air, some residents have concerns around the project\u2019s long-term function. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity, but also a risk,\u201d said Fritz Santjer, an electrical engineer and member of Scientists for Future, an initiative started three years ago in support of the Fridays for Future climate movement.  Santjer, who lives on a green plot of land by the dyke in the neighbouring village of Sande, added: \u201cIf the government follows up on its plans to expand offshore wind farms, then we\u2019re making real progress to meet the Paris agreement, and floating LNG terminals could be a good bridging technology on that path. \u201cBut what if we have a new government in four years, which decides the targets are unrealistic and is quite happy to keep pumping fracking gas? Are we certain Germany will switch to hydrogen then? Do we know whether it will be green or blue?\u201d The pressure group Environmental Action Germany warns that the pipelines built in Wilhelmshaven will create more capacity for gas imports than required to bridge a nervous winter, and also lead Germany to miss its carbon reduction targets. Last Friday, climate activists blocked parts of the pipeline building site at Hooksiel and poured sand into the tanks of diggers. A spokesperson said the damage caused would not set back the works\u2019 timeline. While the enthusiasm of German politicians and energy companies for green hydrogen is palpable, economic realities may yet tie them to non-renewable gas for longer than they desire. China and Japan, the globe\u2019s largest importers of LNG, have underused their long-term options with suppliers this summer, allowing Europe to rake in their off-takes. Come winter, they may insist on their share of the market, forcing countries like Germany into long-term commitments. Berlin\u2019s negotiations over an LNG deal with Qatar are reportedly proving more difficult than expected, because the gas-rich Middle Eastern state was insisting on a contract running over 20 years until 2042. For Wilhelmshaven to become the symbol of Germany\u2019s carbon neutrality success in 2045, the country needs to keep up its newly found momentum."

                    "body": "  9.02pm   Closing summary  Three years of court battles came to a close today, when the supreme court allowed the Democratic-led House ways and means committee to receive Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns over the former president\u2019s opposition. Also ending today was Anthony Fauci\u2019s streak of appearances at the White House. The top US public health official who became a household name during the Covid-19 pandemic made his last briefing to reporters before he steps down from the role, and implored Americans to get a booster shot to protect against the virus. Here\u2019s what else happened today:  Joe Biden extended the pause on federal student loan repayments until 30 June in order to give his administration time to defend his debt forgiveness plan at the supreme court. A former top prosecutor on Robert Mueller\u2019s team investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election has some thoughts for how newly appointed special counsel Jack Smith could approach the criminal investigations into Trump. Democrat Raphael Warnock has a narrow lead over GOP candidate Herschel Walker in the runoff election for Georgia\u2019s Senate seat scheduled for 6 December. Florida\u2019s legislature appears to be moving to change a law that would allow Governor Ron DeSantis make a much-expected run for president. Republican senator Lindsey Graham spoke to a special grand jury investigating meddling in Georgia\u2019s 2020 election result, after months of trying to get out of it.   Updated at 9.04pm GMT    8.51pm    The NAACP civil rights group is among those cheering Biden\u2019s decision to extent the pause on federal student loan repayments. \u201cIn the face of extreme greed and hypocrisy by the far-right, President Biden today is standing up for all Americans \u2013 middle-class and low-income families \u2013 who carry the heavy burden of student loan debt,\u201d the group\u2019s president Derrick Johnson. \u201cThe impact this extension will have in the lives of those who have been targeted by predatory student loans cannot be overstated.\u201d Progressive House Democrat Ro Khanna joined in:      8.40pm    Here\u2019s Joe Biden in his own words, explaining his decision to extend the pause on federal student loan repayment:  Biden first announced the plan in August, and said federal student loan payments would restart in January of next year, and no later. He\u2019s now reversed that, and in the video above, cites recent court rulings putting his loan forgiveness program on hold as the reason.     8.21pm    The Biden administration will extend its pause on student loan repayments until 30 June, Bloomberg News reports:  The decision comes after Joe Biden\u2019s plan to relieve as much as $20,000 of some borrowers\u2019 federal student loan debt was blocked by a federal court. The White House is appealing that order before the supreme court.  Updated at 8.23pm GMT    8.08pm    Lindsey Graham\u2019s office has released a brief statement after the Republican senator appeared today before a special grand jury investigating attempts by Donald Trump and his allies to meddle in the state\u2019s election results. \u201cToday, Senator Graham appeared before the Fulton County Special Grand Jury for just over two hours and answered all questions. The Senator feels he was treated with respect, professionalism, and courtesy. Out of respect for the grand jury process he will not comment on the substance of the questions,\u201d the statement read.     7.53pm    No supreme court justices recorded dissents to the order lifting a stay on an appeals court ruling that allows the House ways and means committee to access Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns. The Democratic-led committee in 2019 requested the then-president\u2019s returns under federal law, saying they were part of their investigation into Trump\u2019s compliance with Internal Revenue Service auditing. Trump has been fighting the matter in court ever since, and supreme court chief justice John Roberts had earlier this month put a stay on the most recent ruling from a federal appeals court in the committee\u2019s favor. The Treasury department is now cleared to hand the documents the ways and means committee. Democrats currently control the House, but will lose it at the start of 2023, when the new Republican majority takes their seats.      7.38pm   Congress cleared to get Trump tax returns after supreme court ruling  The supreme court will allow a congressional committee to receive Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns, the Associated Press reports, ending a three-year battle by the Democratic-led body to see the documents the former president has famously refused to release since his first White House bid. We\u2019ll have more on this developing story as it happens.     7.35pm    Donald Trump is having his day in court as the justice department challenges the appointment of a special master in the Mar-a-Lago case. Politico reports that the appeals panel hearing the matter is skeptical of why an official was appointed to filter out privileged documents from the trove seized by federal agents:  The special master review is seen as an attempt to frustrate and learn details of the investigation into alleged government secrets discovered at the former president\u2019s south Florida resort. On another note:      7.18pm    An interesting development from Florida, where the new leader of the Republican-controlled House appears ready to repeal the state\u2019s \u201cresign to run\u201d law, currently an obstacle to Ron DeSantis\u2019s expected campaign for the White House. As things stand, DeSantis, who was re-elected this month in a landslide to a second term, would have to step down if he were to challenge for his party\u2019s 2024 presidential nomination. His supporters acknowledged as much by chanting \u201ctwo more years!\u201d at his election night party. Governors in Florida serve four year terms. It\u2019s the same rule that required Charlie Crist, DeSantis\u2019s beaten Democratic opponent, to resign his US House seat earlier this year to challenge him. Politico\u2019s reports that state House speaker Paul Renner says he\u2019s willing to change the law next year, and allow DeSantis to fulfil his four-year term as governor at the same time as pursuing a presidential campaign in 2024.  And with a compliant, super-majority in both chambers of the state\u2019s legislature, Republicans can pretty much do as they please.     7.03pm    The US relationship with Saudi Arabia is still under review despite a Biden administration ruling that the Saudi crown prince has immunity from a lawsuit over the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said today.  Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist then living in the United States, was killed and dismembered in 2018 by Saudi agents in the kingdom\u2019s consulate in Istanbul, in an operation US intelligence believes was ordered by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Reuters writes. The prince has denied ordering the killing, which has cast a pall over relations between the two countries. Khashoggi\u2019s fiancee has sued the prince in US court, but in a ruling last week, US justice department lawyers concluded that the prince had immunity as a result of having been named prime minister in the Saudi government in September.  The opinion that we provided does not in any way speak to the merits of the case or the status of the bilateral relationship. Our review of that relationship is ongoing,\u201d Blinken told reporters at a news conference in Qatar after an annual US-Qatar strategic dialogue.  Blinken also said there were no plans for the prince to visit the United States.   Updated at 8.34pm GMT    6.34pm    Donald Trump today asked a federal court in Florida to provide him and his lawyers with a complete version of the affidavit that federal investigators used to obtain a search warrant for his Florida property in August.  Prosecutors are conducting a criminal investigation into the retention of government records at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort after his presidency ended, Reuters reports. The request to unseal the search warrant affidavit was made to US District Judge Aileen Cannon in Florida. A redacted version of the affidavit was made public in August after media organizations sought its release, with sections blacked out that prosecutors said should remain secret. The Justice Department said the redactions included information from \u201ca broad range of civilian witnesses\u201d as well as investigative techniques that, if disclosed, could reveal how to obstruct the probe. US Attorney General Merrick Garland last Friday appointed a special counsel, Jack Smith, to preside over criminal investigations involving the former president after Trump announced he would run for president again. A federal appeals court later today will hear arguments on whether an outside arbiter appointed by Cannon should be allowed to continue a review of documents seized in the search and determine whether any of the records should be kept from criminal investigators.  Updated at 6.47pm GMT    6.08pm   The day so far  Juror are deliberating over whether to convict five Oath Keepers militia members of seditious conspiracy, in what would be a milestone for the government\u2019s prosecution of alleged January 6 insurrectionists. Meanwhile, Anthony Fauci made what could be his last appearance at the White House podium and asked Americans to get the latest Covid-19 vaccine booster as the holiday travel season arrives. Here\u2019s what else has happened today so far:  Top House Republican Kevin McCarthy plans a \u201cmajor\u201d announcement around 4:30 pm eastern time during his visit to El Paso, Texas. This could be the start of a GOP effort to impeach homeland security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas over his handling of the surge in migrants to the US-Mexico border since Joe Biden took office. A former top prosecutor on Robert Mueller\u2019s team investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election has some thoughts for how newly appointed special counsel Jack Smith could approach the criminal investigations into Donald Trump. Democrat Raphael Warnock has a narrow lead over GOP candidate Herschel Walker in the run-off election for Georgia\u2019s Senate seat scheduled for 6 December.      5.46pm    Andrew Weissmann was one of the top members on special prosecutor Robert Mueller's team looking into Russian interference in the 2016 election that brought Trump to power. Now another special prosecutor has been appointed to decide on whether to bring charges against Trump over the January 6 insurrection and the alleged government secrets found at Mar-a-Lago. Writing in the New York Times, Weissmann shares some advice for Jack Smith, the veteran prosecutor appointed to the role. Chief among these is the possibility of Smith bringing charges against Trump \u2013 an option Mueller didn\u2019t have, Weissmann says. \u201cMr. Smith is stepping into a political context very different from the one that confronted Mr. Mueller. Most notably, because of Justice Department policy, Mr. Mueller was forbidden to charge a sitting president. Now that Mr. Trump is a former president, Mr. Smith is not subject to that limitation. (That policy does not apply to presidential candidates like Mr. Trump.),\u201d Weissmann writes. He also notes that Smith has the option of taking a more transparent approach to his investigation than Mueller, who was famously tight-lipped about what he was finding. \u201cNeither the current special counsel regulations nor Justice Department rules require Mr. Smith to take a vow of silence with the American public,\u201d Weissmann writes. \u201cHis ability to explain and educate will be critical to the acceptance of the department\u2019s mission by the American public. It will permit Mr. Smith to be heard directly and not through the gauze of pundits and TV anchors; it will allow the public to directly assess Mr. Smith, a heretofore little-known figure; and it will permit Mr. Smith to counteract those strong forces seeking to discredit or misleadingly shape the narrative about the investigations.\u201d     5.26pm    Under Joe Biden, the United States passed the first significant piece of legislation to fight climate change and reversed decades of opposition to creating a fund for poor countries suffering the worst effects of global rising temperatures. Now, it\u2019s trying to portray China as the world\u2019s climate change villain \u2013 but as Oliver Milman reports, activists aren\u2019t buying it: The US, fresh from reversing its 30 years of opposition to a \u201closs and damage\u201d fund for poorer countries suffering the worst impacts of the climate crisis, has signaled that its longstanding image as global climate villain should now be pinned on a new culprit: China. Following years of tumult in which the US refused to provide anything resembling compensation for climate damages, followed by Donald Trump\u2019s removal of the US from the Paris climate agreement, there was a profound shift at the Cop27 UN talks in Egypt, with Joe Biden\u2019s administration agreeing to the new loss and damage fund. The US also backed language in the new agreement, which finally concluded in the early hours of Sunday morning after an often fraught period of negotiations between governments, that would demand the phase-out of all unabated fossil fuels, only to be thwarted by major oil-producing nations such as Saudi Arabia and Russia. Despite these stances, the US continued to be the leading target of ire from climate activists who blame it for obstruction and for failing to reckon with its role as history\u2019s largest ever emitter of planet-heating gases. On Friday, the US was given the unwanted title of \u201ccolossal fossil\u201d by climate groups for supposedly failing to push through the loss and damage assistance at Cop27. The US delegation in Sharm el-Sheikh chafed at this image, with John Kerry, Biden\u2019s climate envoy, using his closing remarks to shift the focus on to China, now the world\u2019s largest emitter. Kerry said that \u201call nations have a stake in the choices China makes in this critical decade. The United States and China should be able to accelerate progress together, not only for our sake, but for future generations \u2013 and we are all hopeful that China will live up to its global responsibility.\u201d      5.10pm   Fauci urges Americans to get latest Covid shot  Anthony Fauci is making his final appearance at the White House podium, ahead of his retirement next month as America\u2019s top public health official:  The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984, Fauci became a household name as the public face of the US government\u2019s response to the Covid-19 pandemic beginning in early 2020.  Here\u2019s where his parting words to reporters gathered at the White House:  Fauci is appearing alongside the White House\u2019s coronavirus response coordinator Ashish Jha to announce the Biden\u2019s administration\u2019s new six-week campaign to encourage Americans to get Covid-19 boosters in anticipation of the holidays.  Updated at 5.49pm GMT    4.50pm    He\u2019s in court, he\u2019s on the campaign trail and he\u2019s once again being investigated by a special prosecutor. Like it or not, Donald Trump will frequently be in the news for the next two years \u2013 at least \u2013 and the Guardian\u2019s community team would like to hear your thoughts on how reporters should cover the former president. Weigh in at the link below:      4.35pm    Donald Trump has had a bit of an unlucky break in the appeals court hearing today over the appointment of a special master in Mar-a-Lago. The Guardian\u2019s Hugo Lowell reports that two of the three judges hearing the case have previously said that judge Aileen Cannon, who granted the former president\u2019s request for the special master to filter out privileged documents from those federal agents seized by Mar-a-Lago, erred in her decision:      4.19pm    Joe Biden might be going on vacation, but Donald Trump is heading to court, or at least his lawyers are. Hugo Lowell reports that the justice department will today present its arguments to an appeals court about why it should put a stop to the special master review of documents seized from the former president\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort: The US justice department is scheduled to ask a court on Tuesday to void the special master review examining documents seized from Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago residence and make the materials available to the criminal investigation surrounding the former president. The hearing is particularly consequential for Trump: should he lose, it could mark the end of the special master process on which he has relied to delay, and gain more insight into, the investigation surrounding his potential mishandling of national security information. In a 40-page brief filed in advance of an expedited afternoon hearing in the 11th circuit court of appeals, the department argued that Trump should never have been able to get an independent arbiter because the federal judge who granted the request misapplied a four-part legal test in making her judgment. The department also argued that the 11th circuit should terminate the injunction preventing federal investigators from examining the documents in the special master review since Trump appeared to drop his claims that some of the materials are subject to privilege protections. \u201cAbsent any likelihood of any success in the merits of the claim, there is no justification for an injunction,\u201d the department wrote in its brief, as it sought the appeals court to reverse the entirety of the Trump-appointed US district court judge Aileen Cannon\u2019s special master order.      4.03pm    Joe Biden isn\u2019t alone in traveling today. In fact, it\u2019s the busiest day of the year for air travel, and the Federal Aviation Administration has tweeted out a graphic that shows just how packed the skies will be as Americans move around ahead of the thanksgiving holiday:      3.48pm    Joe Biden heads today to Nantucket, Massachusetts, keeping with a family tradition of spending thanksgiving there. Yesterday, he honored another tradition: pardoning a turkey before the annual holiday. David Smith went to the White House see the spectacle for himself: Hail to the grandpa-in-chief! With important legislation under his belt, Republicans in disarray and Vladimir Putin in retreat, Joe Biden is looking pleased with himself and ready for family time. On Saturday he hosted the wedding of his granddaughter, Naomi Biden, on the White House South Lawn. On Sunday he was at family brunch to celebrate his 80th birthday. So if it\u2019s Monday, it must be the annual pardoning of a Thanksgiving turkey, complete with \u201cGod love yas\u201d and grandad jokes. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful Thanksgiving tradition here at the White House,\u201d America\u2019s first octogenarian president said as he welcomed turkeys Chocolate and Chip on the South Lawn. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to say about it, but it\u2019s chilly outside, so I\u2019m going to keep this short. Nobody likes it when their turkey gets cold!\u201d People laughed politely. Looking over at the gobblers, Biden added: \u201cI don\u2019t know if they\u2019re mad yet or not.\u201d      3.30pm    In other unfinished business from the midterms, a Republican who voted to impeach Donald Trump won re-election in California, after a lengthy ballot count, Richard Luscombe reports: A Republican who voted to impeach Donald Trump in the House of Representatives has won re-election in California, making him only the second of the 10 to do so still in Congress. David Valadao was called the winner of his competitive race with Democrat Rudy Salas late on Monday, almost two weeks after election day. With his party having already secured control of the House, albeit narrowly, his result was significant only for the survival of his political career after turning on the former president. Other than Dan Newhouse, who swept to victory in his Washington state race, none of the Republicans who voted for Trump\u2019s impeachment last year will serve another term.      3.16pm   Democrat Warnock holds narrow lead over GOP's Walker for Georgia Senate seat: poll  Democratic incumbent Raphael Warnock has a slight lead over his Republican challenger Herschel Walker ahead of the 6 December runoff election for Georgia\u2019s Senate seat, a poll released today finds. The survey by AARP Georgia finds Warnock has 51% support over Walker\u2019s 47%. The Democrat has an edge among young voters, while Walker is more popular among people older than 50, which are a large part of the electorate. Walker and Warnock are battling for a Senate seat that Democrats took control of only last year in a special election. While Joe Biden\u2019s allies have secured a majority in Congress\u2019s upper chamber for another two years, a victory by Warnock would pad their margin of control. Republicans, meanwhile, hope Walker\u2019s victory would put them in a better position to retake the chamber in the next elections set for 2024.  Updated at 3.23pm GMT    2.51pm   McCarthy plans 'major' announcement on DHS secretary  Top House Republican Kevin McCarthy will make a \u201cmajor\u201d announcement about homeland security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas today, Fox News reports:  The announcement will come during McCarthy\u2019s visit to El Paso, Texas, where he will probably draw attention to the surge in migrant arrivals at the US-Mexico border since Joe Biden took office. Republicans have criticized the White House for its handling of the situation, and rightwing lawmakers in Congress have reportedly called for impeachment proceedings against Mayorkas, a rare step to take against a sitting cabinet secretary. McCarthy is hoping to be elected speaker of the House when Republicans take control next year, after winning a majority of seats in the 8 November midterms. But he is scrambling to find the votes after several of the chamber\u2019s most conservative lawmakers said they would not support him.     2.27pm   Lindsey Graham set to testify in Georgia election meddling inquiry  Republican Senator Lindsey Graham will today appear before a special grand jury investigating efforts by Donald Trump\u2019s allies to meddle with Georgia\u2019s election result, Fox 5 Atlanta reports. Graham has fought the subpoena from Fulton county district attorney Fani Willis for months, but exhausted his legal options when the supreme court turned down his challenge earlier this month. The South Carolina lawmaker\u2019s appearance before jurors in an Atlanta courthouse will not be public, but Willis could use evidence he provides to bring charges in the case. The district attorney has said she wants to ask Graham about two calls he made to Georgia\u2019s secretary of state Brad Raffensperger and his officials following the 2020 election, in which he alleged voter fraud in the state and asked about the possibility of \u201creexamining certain absentee ballots,\u201d Fox 5 reports. Georgia was one of several states whose votes for Joe Biden proved crucial to his election victory two years ago.     2.09pm    The Oath Keepers don\u2019t dispute that some of their members were around the Capitol on January 6, but jurors need to believe they entered the building in an attempt to stop the certification of Joe Biden\u2019s election win. Whether prosecutors have succeeded at this will be key to determining if they win a conviction in the seditious conspiracy case. Here\u2019s more from the Associated Press on what\u2019s come out of the trial so far: As angry supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the US Capitol, ready to smash through windows and beat police officers, Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes extolled them as patriots and harked back to the battle that kicked off the American revolutionary war. \u201cNext comes our Lexington,\u201d Rhodes told his fellow far-right extremists in a message on 6 January 2021. \u201cIt\u2019s coming.\u201d Jurors will begin weighing his words and actions on Tuesday, after nearly two months of testimony and argument in the criminal trial of Rhodes and four codefendants. Final defense arguments wrapped up late Monday.  Hundreds of people have been convicted in the attack that left dozens of officers injured, sent lawmakers running for their lives and shook the foundations of American democracy. Now jurors in the case against Rhodes and four associates will decide, for the first time, whether the actions of any January 6 defendants amount to seditious conspiracy \u2013 a rarely used charge that carries both significant prison time and political weight. The jury\u2019s verdict may well address the false notion that the 2020 presidential election was stolen, coming soon after 2022 midterm results in which voters rejected Trump\u2019s chosen Republican candidates who supported his baseless claims of fraud. The outcome could also shape the future of the justice department\u2019s massive and costly prosecution of the insurrection that some conservatives have sought to portray as politically motivated. Failure to secure a seditious conspiracy conviction could spell trouble for another high-profile trial beginning next month of former Proud Boys national chairman Enrique Tarrio and other leaders of that extremist group. The justice department\u2019s January 6 probe has also expanded beyond those who attacked the Capitol to focus on others linked to Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the election. In the Oath Keepers trial, prosecutors built their case using dozens of encrypted messages sent in the weeks leading up to January 6. They show Rhodes rallying his followers to fight to defend Trump and warning they might need to \u201crise up in insurrection\u201d. \u201cWe aren\u2019t getting through this without a civil war. Prepare your mind, body and spirit,\u201d he wrote shortly after the 2020 election.      1.49pm   Jury begins deliberating in Oath Keepers seditious conspiracy trial  Good morning, US politics blog readers. A Washington federal jury is starting deliberations in the trial of five members of the Oath Keepers militia, including its founder Stewart Rhodes. The group stands accused of seditious conspiracy, a rarely used charge that prosecutors say is an appropriate way to describe the alleged plot they attempted to carry out on January 6 to stop Joe Biden from taking office. The trial will be an important indicator of if the government can win convictions against the most violent actors in the insurrection, and a verdict could come at any time. Here\u2019s what else is happening today:  Top House Republican Kevin McCarthy is visiting border patrol personnel in El Paso, Texas. Expect him to talk up the GOP\u2019s plan to address the surge of migrant arrivals at the US-Mexico border when they take control of the House next year, and criticize Joe Biden\u2019s handling of the situation. Biden is heading to Nantucket, Massachusetts, this afternoon for the Thanksgiving holiday. Anthony Fauci and Covid-19 response coordinator Ashish Jha will appear at the daily White House press briefing at 11.30am eastern time, where they\u2019ll likely talk about the threat of coronavirus during the holiday season.

                    "body": "With many finances so tight, this is a good time to look at your spending and see whether you can make your money work harder. If you need to buy a particular item or switch to a new service, one way to do this is to look for a purchase or deal that comes with cashback. From current accounts and mobile phones to investments and electrical appliances, there are dozens of products and services where you can get \u201cfree\u201d cash. However, the general rule is: do not buy something or move to a new provider just to get the money. These offers work when it is something you were going to buy or do anyway, such as quitting your bank because you are unhappy with the service or upgrading your phone contract. It is vital to shop around because you may find you can save more money by going with one company than you would get in cashback from another. Bank accounts This week, Lloyds became the latest high street bank to launch a current account switching offer. You can get \u00a3125 if you switch from another bank to its Club Lloyds account. You need to pay at least \u00a31,500 a month into the account, otherwise there is a \u00a33 monthly fee. Lloyds says the \u00a3125 will be paid directly into your account approximately three working days after the switch takes place. This offer is due to end on 27 June. A couple of other banks are offering bigger cash incentives. HSBC will give you \u00a3170 if you switch from a rival to its Advance account. You will need to pay in at least \u00a31,500 within the first 60 days, among other criteria. This account has no monthly fee but to be eligible you will need to qualify for an arranged overdraft of at least \u00a31,000.  The bank says: \u201cOnce you meet all our eligibility criteria, we\u2019ll pay \u00a3170 into your account within 30 days.\u201d  First Direct, a subsidiary of HSBC that is often rated the best bank for service, is offering a \u00a3150 payment when you switch to its 1st Account. You need to pay in at least \u00a31,000 and will get the \u00a3150 within 28 days of all the terms and conditions being met. Meanwhile, Nationwide will give you \u00a3125 if you are already a member of the building society, or \u00a3100 if you are not, when you switch to one of its current accounts (FlexPlus, FlexDirect or FlexAccount). With all of the previous accounts will need to use the banking industry\u2019s switching service to arrange your transfer. Phone and internet Some mobile phone and broadband providers are offering payments when you sign up to a new contract. However, this is an area where you really need to do your homework to check you are getting the best deal rather than being dazzled by the headline incentive. The mobile network Three is offering up to \u00a3250 cashback if you switch to it between now and 7 July. The offer applies to some of the latest handsets, including the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra and the iPhone 13, as well as sim-only deals. For example, there is an unlimited data 24-month sim plan costing \u00a311 a month for the first six months (then \u00a322 a month) and comes with \u00a3100 cashback. Those who switch will receive the money via a prepaid Mastercard delivered after 45 days, provided they pay their first month\u2019s bill on time.  Meanwhile, Zen Internet \u2013 which claims to be \u201cthe only Which?-recommended\u201d broadband provider \u2013 this week announced a scheme whereby customers can receive an \u00a380 giftcard (redeemable at retailers including John Lewis and Marks &amp; Spencer) for every friend they refer, with the friend receiving a \u00a320 gift card. Investments There are a number of cashback offers from investment firms at the moment. However, in the current economic climate, many people may want to prioritise having cash in an easily accessible savings account rather than locking money away.  This month, the investment platform Interactive Investor launched two offers, giving qualifying customers cashback when they transfer an Isa or Sipp (self-invested personal pension) to it by 30 June. For example, Interactive Investor is offering new customers \u00a3100 cashback if they transfer an Isa with a value of more than \u00a310,000. Meanwhile, at the time of writing, the investment site Moneyfarm has a cashback offer whereby it will give you a \u00a3200 investment boost when you invest at least \u00a35,000 in one of its stocks and shares Isas. This money will be paid into the \u201cavailable cash\u201d section of a customer\u2019s account and can then be invested or withdrawn. NatWest is running an investment Isa transfer cashback offer for customers that only has a few more days to run \u2013 it ends on 27 May. The offer is open to those who have existing cash Isas with any provider, including NatWest, or stocks and shares Isas with an external company. To get cashback ranging from \u00a325 up to \u00a31,000, you have to transfer your Isa(s) to NatWest Invest. You need to be a NatWest customer with online banking to apply."

                    "body": "Elon Musk has said his $44bn (\u00a336bn) takeover of Twitter is \u201ctemporarily on hold\u201d in a tweet that rocked the company\u2019s share price and cast doubt on whether the deal will happen. The Tesla chief tweeted on Friday morning that the deal was being frozen while he awaited details supporting Twitter\u2019s assertion that fewer than 5% of its users were spam or fake accounts. In a subsequent tweet, Musk said he was \u201cstill committed to acquisition\u201d, amid speculation that the world\u2019s richest man was about to walk away from the deal or seek a lower price. Musk later claimed that he would conduct a \u201crandom sample\u201d of 100 Twitter followers to investigate the issue.  The announcement left analysts and observers scratching their heads, prompting some to ask if the eccentric billionaire was trying to exit the deal or renegotiate it. Musk and Twitter have signed an agreement that includes a $1bn break fee payable by the Tesla CEO if he walks away, although it also includes a \u201cspecific performance clause\u201d that a judge can cite to force Musk to complete the deal at the agreed price of $54.20 per share. \u201cI suspect he wants to use the threat (legally weak) that the disclosure about bots on the platform results in a failure of a Twitter representation (it doesn\u2019t) and then push for a renegotiation,\u201d said Brian Quinn, an associate professor at Boston College Law School. \u201cThat\u2019s hardly an original thought and this is not an uncommon strategy. If the Twitter board has a spine it will just say no and sit on its rights under the agreement.\u201d  Musk announced the hold on the Twitter takeover alongside a link to a Reuters article published on 2 May that referred to a filing with the US financial regulator, in which Twitter claimed that false or spam accounts represented fewer than 5% of its 229 million daily average users. The filing does not appear to contain new information on spam accounts, however, with previous quarterly filings going back to 2014 also referring to the \u201cfewer than 5%\u201d figure, albeit with the caveat that the true number could be higher. The move comes a day after Twitter announced the departure of two top figures at the company in an internal shakeup. The Musk takeover plan has prompted a backlash among both Twitter users and staff. Meanwhile, the Tesla CEO has been looking for additional investors to support the deal, the Washington Post reported, as Tesla\u2019s stock price has weakened. Musk\u2019s Tesla stake is a key component in his financing of the deal, with fears that he will sell or pledge more of them contributing to pressure on the share price. Tesla shares have lost a quarter of their value in the last month, and have fallen from about $1,150 in early April when Musk confirmed he had taken a huge stake in Twitter, to $769.59 on Friday. Musk has already secured more than $7bn (\u00a35.7bn) in outside funding from a group of investors that includes the tech tycoon Larry Ellison, a Saudi prince, the Qatar state investment fund and the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency exchange. Musk\u2019s net worth, estimated by Forbes earlier this week at $240bn, was $232 bbn as of Friday. \u201cWe\u2019d always said he may cut or run or change his tune at the 11th hour and 59 minutes and 59 seconds on the clock. It is farcical,\u201d said Neil Campling, head of technology research at Mirabaud Equity Research. \u201cHe has never had the full funding. We know that from his constant attempts to get financial support, but he also held all the cards.\u201d Musk\u2019s tweet on Friday sent Twitter\u2019s shares down nearly 10% to $40.71 when Wall Street closed, on concerns that the deal could collapse. Musk will probably be legally bound to either follow through with the deal or pay the fee, said Art Hogan, the chief market strategist at National Securities. \u201cSaying it\u2019s temporarily on hold is not standard operating procedure when you\u2019ve made a tender offer for a company. It\u2019s confusing and also nonsensical. It just doesn\u2019t hold up,\u201d said Hogan. US short-selling firm Hindenburg Research, which takes bets against companies\u2019 share prices, said this week that Musk could submit a lower bid for Twitter, owing to a slump in tech stocks and a weak financial performance at the social media platform. Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, a US financial services firm, said: \u201cThe implications of this tweet will send this Twitter circus show into a Friday the 13th horror show as now the Street will view this deal as 1) likely falling apart, 2) Musk negotiating for a lower deal price, or 3) Musk simply walking away from the deal with a $1bn breakup fee.\u201d Musk has railed against automated or \u201cbot\u201d Twitter accounts \u2013 which are not run by human users \u2013 and said after announcing the takeover that he wanted to improve the platform by \u201cauthenticating all humans\u201d.   Twitter allows automated accounts on its platform, ranging from disaster early warning systems to algorithmic art. In 2021, it introduced an \u201cautomated account\u201d label to publicly mark such accounts as being run by a computer, not a human. But those accounts need to follow strict rules and can lose access if they misbehave. One such automated account may even have been the driver for Musk\u2019s initial purchase of Twitter stock. Created by a 19-year-old aviation enthusiast, the @elonjet Twitter feed tracks and automatically tweets the location of Elon Musk\u2019s private plane, taken from public flight tracker data. In January, Musk offered the teenager $5,000 to buy the account and shut it down, declining the creator\u2019s $50,000 counter-offer. A few days later, he began purchasing Twitter stock, filing his legal declaration that he own a substantial stake in early April. But declared automated accounts such as @elonjet are far outnumbered by spam accounts, which deliberately break Twitter\u2019s terms of service in pursuit of commercial or political goals. Such accounts may use the reply function or direct messages to send adverts or scams to other users, or they may represent attempts to influence the public discourse by tweeting political propaganda. Other fake accounts exist purely to boost the metrics of individual users, who can buy followers, likes and retweets from \u201cbot sellers\u201d who control thousands or millions of fake accounts. \u201cBots massively multiply the ability of one person to attempt to manipulate people,\u201d Samuel Woolley at Oxford University said after the launch in 2017 of a report into social media manipulation. \u201cPicture your annoying friend on Facebook, who\u2019s always picking political fights. If they had an army of 5,000 bots, that would be a lot worse, right?\u201d Agencies contributed reporting"

                    "body": "Formula One returns to Australia this weekend after a two-year absence since the sport\u2019s blase attitude toward the oncoming pandemic left it reeling when the meeting in Melbourne fell apart. Mismanagement and hubris had brought F1 low but, finally back at Albert Park, it could not be in ruder health. F1\u2019s insistence on pushing on with holding the race was wildly over-ambitious, up to and including allowing fans to turn up at the gates, only not to be admitted as the event was called off with Covid cases among the teams. That weekend was a nadir for F1\u2019s owners and the FIA. But the recovery has been nothing short of remarkable. As other sports floundered, F1 put on 17 races in 2020 and 22 in 2021, including one of the great championship fights.  This season the plan is to hold 23 races and, last week, F1 announced a race in Las Vegas next year. The significance of which goes far beyond the mere publicity and glamour of staging a race on the Strip. The Las Vegas GP will take place in November, on a Saturday at 10pm local time, the usual Sunday afternoon scheduling summarily dismissed in order to hit prime time TV in the United States. With Miami and Texas already on the calendar, the US will host three meetings in 2023. Given the sport\u2019s recent history there, this is an extraordinary feat. F1 enjoyed great popularity in the US in the 60s and 70s, with Watkins Glen, New York rammed with fans, but it has struggled since then. From the 1980s on there were periods without a GP, while the brief spell at Indianapolis between 2000 and 2007 ended in ignominy. Racing returned in 2012 at Austin, a meeting that for some time struggled to bring in the numbers. Bernie Ecclestone had long tried to pull off a GP in Las Vegas but never succeeded. Since Liberty Media took over the sport in 2017, however, its efforts to drag F1 into the modern age have paid off and Vegas is the definitive evidence. A concerted effort has been made to attract a new, younger audience, targeting social media as part of making the sport accessible and aiming at a large, inclusive global demographic, rather than relying on a traditional, ageing fanbase. Part of that strategy was allowing Netflix to make the Drive To Survive series about the sport.  Its success has been a vindication and a priceless marketing tool, especially in the US, as recognised by F1\u2019s CEO, Stefano Domenicali. \u201cThe beauty of the growth of our sport in this country is we are reaching a lot of young people that are starting to be thrilled by our sport,\u201d he said. \u201cTo think that next year we\u2019re going to have three races in the US, if you think back a couple of years ago, you would say you are crazy.\u201d Yet three races there will be as F1\u2019s numbers come up. Austin drew in 400,000 fans over the weekend last year, while last season the US broadcaster ESPN enjoyed consistently rising viewing figures, including the sport\u2019s highest since 1995. Austin and Miami are expected to be sellouts this year.  Liberty has long made a point of wanting to expand in the US and, in the case of Las Vegas, it has boldly stepped up to make it a reality. The race is being promoted by F1 in conjunction with the city and a group of hotels and casinos. F1 has put itself up to take any potential losses should the event prove unpopular. It is a brave decision and something Liberty would not have dared try without the increase in the sport\u2019s popularity. Las Vegas last hosted two, unloved, GPs in 1981 and 1982 on a terrible circuit built in the car park of the Caesars Palace casino, attracting poor crowds and viewing figures despite hosting championship deciders. This time it is hard to imagine the meeting being a failure. The 3.8-mile track will stretch around the city\u2019s landmarks, the Strip, the Bellagio fountains, Caesars, the Paris Casino. Visually, at the very least, this is the backdrop F1\u2019s owners have fantasised about. But it comes at a price. The season is capped at 24 races according to the commercial agreement with the teams, a number 2023 is already set to exceed. It appears that, largely, European races are in the danger. With Vegas, Qatar and China all set to race in 2023, there would be 25 meetings and that does not include the determination to add a meeting in Africa as soon as possible. Domenicali has already mooted the idea that some races will have to be on and off the calendar on a rota basis in future.  Belgium, France and Mexico have no contract for next year and none of them can compete financially with the big money being hurled around in the Middle East. Monaco, too, must be considered as at risk. The track is wholly unsuited to the large, heavy modern F1 cars and its former special status in not having to pay a hosting fee has been removed by F1. For many European fans this is the unacceptable cost of expansion in the US, but it is the reality of a success story that sits in stark contrast to the painful humility of Australia in 2020. F1 is vibrant, popular and expanding globally. Bringing Las Vegas on board is the sign of a sport utterly confident in this roll of the dice."

                    "body": "If you want to know who the world\u2019s richest man has on speed dial, then a regulatory filing on Thursday provided an insight. Elon Musk announced a score of new backers for his $44bn (\u00a335.6bn) Twitter takeover, including Oracle tycoon Larry Ellison, the crypto market\u2019s leading trading platform, the Qatari sovereign wealth fund and a Saudi prince. If this was Tesla\u2019s boss displaying his power network, it was also an admission that \u2013 despite recent words to the contrary \u2013 the numbers behind his audacious bid do matter. Discussing his offer last month, Musk said: \u201cI don\u2019t care about the economics at all.\u201d For some of Wall Street\u2019s biggest banks, Tesla\u2019s shareholders and even Twitter users, the economics are very important indeed. The initial funding package behind the takeover, which requires shareholder approval,was initially split into three elements: $21bn in equity, or Elon Musk\u2019s own cash; $12.5bn of loans secured against Musk\u2019s shares in Tesla, the electric carmaker that he runs; and a further $13bn in loans from a group of seven banks, secured against Twitter itself. That changed on Thursday. According to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the equity commitment had risen to $27.25bn, helped by a group of 18 investors including Ellison ($1bn), the Binance trading platform ($500m) and Qatar Holding ($375m), an investment arm of the Gulf state\u2019s wealth fund. They are putting in $7.1bn, plus a contribution from the Saudi Arabian investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who also plans to roll his $1.9bn Twitter stake into the deal rather than cashing out. As part of this reshuffle, the loans secured against Musk\u2019s 15.7% stake in Tesla have been halved to $6.25bn. The bank loan commitment stays the same. Musk\u2019s comment about the economics of the bid, in an interview at a TED conference in mid-April, came before he confirmed hastily put-together funding for a takeover. It was a move that swayed shareholders in Twitter and the company\u2019s board, who accepted the bid days later. But the off-the-cuff nature of his comments belie the serious nature of the financial commitments the Tesla tycoon is making. Some experts point to a high-risk structure, regardless of last week\u2019s changes \u2013 and what it means for the company he is buying. \u201cMusk hasn\u2019t provided a lot of detail about his business plan for the company,\u201d says Jill Fisch, a professor of business law at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cAlthough he has taken steps to reduce his risk by bringing in additional investors, he still has a lot of personal exposure financially, he is paying a high price based on Twitter\u2019s existing business model and he has large loans from the banks. Given the size of Musk\u2019s personal financial exposure, he will be under pressure to run Twitter to make money, both to manage his own financial risk and to repay the bank financing.\u201d First, let\u2019s look at Musk\u2019s commitment. Last month he revealed he had sold $8.5bn worth of shares in Tesla since announcing the takeover, presumably to help fund the deal. His stake in Tesla, which forms the core of his wealth, is integral to financing the deal. If you strip out new investors and Prince Talwaleed\u2019s stake, plus Musk\u2019s own $3.9bn stake in Twitter, he still needs to provide around $14.3bn of equity for the deal. A simple reading of this would be: he owns $155bn in Tesla shares, so contributing just over $14bn should be easy.  But it is not quite as straightforward as that. According to a filing with the SEC, Musk has already pledged 92.3m of his 163m Tesla shares as \u201ccollateral to secure certain personal indebtedness\u201d. Then there is the $6.25bn already pledged for the deal \u2013 in an arrangement known as a margin loan, where the borrower could be required to make good any shortfall in the value of the shares that the debt is secured against. Presuming the loan-to-value ratio of 20% in the original margin loan agreement is carried over, this means a further 35.8m shares are tied up. So, looking at Musk\u2019s total shareholding, this leaves him with about 35m unpledged shares worth $30bn. In theory, these could be pledged or sold to raise the remaining $14bn of cash needed for the deal. But Musk tweeted on 29 April that he had \u201cNo further TSLA sales planned after today\u201d.  Drew Pascarella, a senior lecturer of finance at Cornell University, says he would be surprised if Morgan Stanley, the Wall Street bank that has played the lead role in the debt financing, had not carried out some form of due diligence on Musk\u2019s commitment. \u201cThere is no way Morgan Stanley would have proceeded as they did unless they had looked in Elon\u2019s eyes and seen some evidence that he could come up with that money.\u201d The Tesla chief executive has other sources of wealth, including Tesla shares already sold, his SpaceX rocket business and his Boring Company tunnelling firm. He is also in line to receive $20bn worth of Tesla share options (based on Friday\u2019s share price), although he cannot cash these in for five years. According to calculations by CreditSights, a credit research firm, the bank financing alone will leave Twitter highly leveraged once the deal is completed. Twitter\u2019s gross indebtedness will be nine times its underlying Ebitda \u2013 a measure of profit \u2013 for 2021, says CreditSights. \u201cThat is very high and certainly not a comfortable amount of leverage,\u201d says Jordan Chalfin, a senior technology analyst at CreditSights. It is against the backdrop of these numbers that Musk has floated ideas such as charging a \u201cslight\u201d fee for commercial and government users, although it will stay free for casual users.The New York Times also reported on Friday that Musk expects to pay down the $800m-$900m debt interest costs with free cash flow that he expects to grow to $9.4bn by 2028, although in the short term it looks like it will be tight. According to Chaflin, a proxy for Twitter\u2019s ability to cover its debt interest would be subtracting Twitter\u2019s capital expenditure costs \u2013 $1bn last year \u2013 from the company\u2019s Ebitda. Stock market analysts\u2019 forecasts for Twitter Ebitda, according to a Reuters poll, is $1.4bn in 2022 and $1.8bn in 2023. It could be a squeeze.  \u201cThe extremely high levels of debt Elon plans to saddle Twitter with come at a high price \u2013 investment for growth,\u201d says Cornell\u2019s Pascarella. \u201cA technology company like Twitter needs to invest in itself to continue to innovate and grow. Post deal, most of Twitter\u2019s cash flow will be used not for investment, but to service debt.\u201dSpeaking about Twitter at a recent conference, Musk said: \u201cI mean, I could technically afford it.\u201d He can, but some users might have to pay."

                    "body": "  5.55pm    And that\u2019s it from the blog today. Thanks for reading. A reminder of those weekend Premier League fixtures. Can Manchester United do Liverpool a massive favour?  Saturday Leicester v Leeds - 12.30pmAston Villa v Southampton - 3pmBurnley v Chelsea - 3pmNewcastle v Brighton - 3pmNorwich v Brentford - 3pmWolves v Crystal Palace - 3pmLiverpool v West Ham - 5.30pm Sunday Watford v Arsenal - 2pmMan City v Man Utd - 4.30pm Monday Spurs v Everton - 8pm      5.44pm    Emma Hayes is confident her highly successful Chelsea women\u2019s team will remain an important and properly funded part of the club once new owners move into Stamford Bridge. Roman Abramovich\u2019s decision to sell Chelsea has prompted concern that future support could be withdrawn from Hayes\u2019s squad but the manager does not share such worries. \u201cWe\u2019re fully embedded into this football club,\u201d said Hayes as she prepared for Saturday\u2019s League Cup final against Manchester City at AFC Wimbledon\u2019s Plough Lane ground. \u201cI know any future owners are going to want success for the club and the women\u2019s team are part of that. \u201cYou hear about underfunded women\u2019s teams but there\u2019s no chance of that happening here or things going backwards. This club is invested in its women\u2019s team and I expect that to remain long and strong into the future. I have no anxieties or worries about our status.\u201d      5.37pm    Thanks to Peter Oh for noting that I\u2019d written Jesse March instead of (now corrected) Marsch.  Well, I got the Jesse bit right, the new Leeds manager now my second favourite Jesse after Jesse Birdsall. Roger Webb from Footballers\u2019 Wives to some but always Eldorado\u2019s Marcus Tandy to me.     5.24pm    Wolves v Crystal Palace preview. Erm, these are getting harder now. Why, of course, it\u2019s the Bakary Sako derby.      5.18pm    Here\u2019s the Fiver.      5.12pm    Your preview of the Julian Joachim derby is right here.      5.08pm    It\u2019s all eyes on the <strike> Joe Cole </strike> <strike> Paul Ince </strike> Titi Camara derby on Saturday evening.   Updated at 5.10pm GMT    5.03pm    And now the Steven Davis derby.      4.59pm    Let\u2019s have a burst of match previews. First, the Dan Burn derby.   Updated at 5.02pm GMT    4.47pm    One man who could prove a thorn in the side for Jesse Marsch and Leeds is returning Leicester striker Jamie Vardy. The 35-year-old still darts around the pitch like a keen and hungry man in his early 20s and came back from a two-month absence to register a goal and an assist in the 2-0 victory at Burnley in midweek. Here\u2019s Leicester boss Brendan Rodgers on full gush mode - his favourite setting - when asked about Vardy\u2019s importance. \u201cHe\u2019s a natural goalscorer. He works at his game. He\u2019s very astute. He studies the game. He\u2019s very clever, he picks up on things in his game. \u201cHe\u2019s sharp, he has a bright mind. He\u2019s looking for ways to get in. He\u2019s got a lovely soft finish if he has to. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt he has been one of the world\u2019s best over these last few years. He works tirelessly at his game and he has a hunger to keep proving a point.\u201d Rodgers also heaped praise on departing Leeds boss Marcelo Bielsa. \u201cMarcelo is a big loss to the Premier League, as much for the human qualities he showed. \u201cIt\u2019s a big loss for the city, he was a father figure. He was admired there and by managers. I spent some time with him while he was here. \u201cThe game is a circus now but he brought old-school values. He was not taken in by everything that goes around the modern game. It was what football used to be like. He will be a loss.\u201d  Updated at 5.31pm GMT    4.32pm    It\u2019s pretty obvious what new Elland Road boss Jesse Marsch has to address first: Leeds\u2019 defence. These stats make grim reading:  Leeds goalkeeper Illan Meslier has conceded 60 goals in 26 appearances this season, conceding once on average every 39 minutes. Over the course of a season, no goalkeeper to play at least 20 times has had a worse minutes per goal conceded ratio in the competition.    Leeds conceded at least three goals in all five of their Premier League games in February, setting a competition record for the most goals conceded in a single calendar month (20). The last team to concede 3+ goals in six consecutive top-flight matches were Birmingham City between October-December 1964.    Leeds have shipped at least two goals in the first half in each of their last five Premier League games, the longest run of any side in Premier League history. In the club\u2019s history, they have only once previously shipped 2+ goals in five consecutive league games, doing so in February and March 1937, never doing so in six in a row.   Erm, how about some new manager bounce then... oh!  Including caretakers, six of the last seven managers to take charge of Leeds in the Premier League have lost their first game in the competition. The exception was Terry Venables.   But let\u2019s end on a positive...  Leeds are unbeaten in their last five away league games against Leicester (W2 D3). They won this exact fixture 3-1 last season.       4.23pm    David Moyes has also revealed that Ukraine forward Andriy Yarmolenko will miss West Ham\u2019s trip to Anfield. Yarmolenko was given time off last week following Russia\u2019s invasion of his homeland and Moyes says the player isn\u2019t yet ready to return to the squad. \u201cHe has been training but he won\u2019t travel to Liverpool with us,\u201d said Moyes. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s quite ready and we want to give him every opportunity to do everything he can for his family and for his country. I think he just feels a little bit bogged down with the situation at this present time. \u201cI feel helpless and that\u2019s not just me as a football manager, but we as a country and a population. I think we all feel as if we can\u2019t do anything. \u201cWe can only give him our full support. We continually ask if there\u2019s anything we can do. \u201cI spoke with him this morning for 20 minutes about it and tried to ask a few questions about what\u2019s going on etc., but it\u2019s really difficult because nobody\u2019s ever been in these circumstances before and I hope I\u2019m never in them again. \u201cComing into training sometimes makes things feel a little better for him and we try to give him a bit of release, but we also want to do everything we can for him and his family.\u201d     4.14pm    Thanks Luke. I\u2019ll start with West Ham boss David Moyes addressing player workload and his poor record at Anfield. \u201cWe\u2019re not pleased with the Premier League that we\u2019ve had to play so many games, and you can relay that to them please,\u201d said Moyes in today\u2019s press conference. \u201cWe had a game on Sunday (1-0 home win over Wolves), a cup game on Wednesday (3-1 loss at Southampton) and now we\u2019re playing again on Saturday (away to Liverpool), so three games in six days would not be correct. \u201cBut they (the players) have been really resilient. Whenever we have had to continue playing, even in lockdown and the periods when we\u2019ve been really busy, they have always backed it up and come good again. \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of confidence that will happen, but obviously with the fixtures we\u2019ve got it\u2019s made it a really difficult week for us.\u201d As for his Anfield hoodoo which shows 17 failed attempts to win there as manager of West Ham, Everton, Manchester United and Sunderland, he had this to say. \u201cGoing to Anfield is difficult and it has been for me over many years. I have found it really difficult throughout my career because Liverpool have really, really good teams and they tend to have top managers. Hopefully it gets better this time.\u201d  Fighting talk!     4.03pm    That\u2019s the lot from me for today\u2019s blog \u2013 I shall hand you back to David Tindall to take you through the rest of today\u2019s football news.     3.56pm    Steven Gerrard is relishing the chance to end Southampton\u2019s excellent run in order to kickstart one of his own with Aston Villa. Villa endured a run of just one win in eight matches before the much-needed 2-0 victory at Brighton and Gerrard wants to see more consistency from his side as they bid to make a strong end to the season.  \u201cWe can certainly see the belief and the confidence on the back of that result,\u201d Gerrard said. \u201cThe players knew that they\u2019d put in a really strong performance, they were really difficult to play against and at the right times we went and hurt Brighton. Our game plan certainly played off, the players went and delivered that and it was on the back of a couple of tough weeks, so you can certainly see a bit of a release and relief in them by getting that win. Now it\u2019s all about backing it up this weekend going into a home fixture. We don\u2019t want to be inconsistent.\u201d (PA Media)   Updated at 4.00pm GMT    3.52pm    Thomas Frank says Christian Eriksen may be ready to make his first start since his cardiac arrest at Euro 2020 when Brentford face Norwich in the Premier League on Saturday. Eriksen made his comeback as a substitute in last weekend\u2019s 2-0 home defeat by Newcastle, 259 days after collapsing during Denmark\u2019s clash with Finland at Parken Stadium last June. Frank has revealed that the 30-year-old midfielder has successfully emerged from an important staging post in his return to playing regularly again.  \u201cChristian\u2019s good. He keeps progressing in terms of his fitness and getting good training minutes into him,\u201d Frank said. \u201cIt was not a box ticked, but I think it was very important to get that game played. Now hopefully for everyone involved we can focus on football.\u201d When asked if Eriksen will be picked in the starting line-up against Norwich, Frank replied: \u201cYou\u2019ll find out tomorrow. Of course I\u2019m interested in getting him on to the pitch as much as possible.\u201d  Saturday\u2019s Carrow Road showdown will be overseen by Anthony Taylor, the referee who took charge of that Euro 2020 match. Taylor was praised for the way he handled the cardiac arrest after his understanding of the urgency of the situation led to medical attention arriving promptly. Frank said: \u201cI\u2019ve mentioned it to Christian. I said \u2018do you know who the ref is?\u2019. He didn\u2019t know....and then he said \u2018ah is it Anthony? How funny, what a coincidence\u2019.\u201d (PA Media)      3.47pm    The new head coach Jesse Marsch has vowed Leeds will show no fear in their bid to keep their Premier League status. Marsch, 48, will take charge of his first game in the early Saturday kick-off at Leicester.  Marsch said: \u201cOur style of play is fearless. I think we have a lot of fearless young men here and we have to tap into that fearlessness, it will help us in a situation like this. The thing I loved about this team in the past is their fight, their ability to run for each other, to do whatever it takes no matter what the result was. This will have to remain a big part of our DNA.\u201d       3.43pm    A story from the newswires from earlier today:      3.38pm    Ralf Rangnick believes Manchester United have to become more like Manchester City and Liverpool by appointing a manager who has a clear way of playing and can implement this over the long term.      3.31pm    Roy Hodgson says Watford need to \u201cbreak the cycle\u201d of their current disappointing run when Arsenal visit on Sunday. Watford have taken five points from six games following Hodgson\u2019s appointment as Claudio Ranieri\u2019s successor in January.  That run has included one victory, Watford\u2019s first since the 4-1 win over Manchester United in November which proved to be Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s last match in charge, and the Hornets are three points from safety.  \u201cIt\u2019s results that really keep the mood high; they keep the spirits higher, they keep everyone with a smile on their face,\u201d Hodgson said. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to maintain that good feeling about yourself, about the club, about the players \u2013 and for the players to feel good about themselves when you\u2019re losing games all the time.  \u201cSo we badly need to break the cycle that we\u2019ve found ourselves in where we need points. And what we need basically is what the one or two teams around us have found. A period where they played three games and took a lot more points than everyone thought they were going to take - it\u2019s lifted them a little bit higher up the table.\u201d  Watford will probably have to go into the game against Arsenal without Isma\u00efla Sarr after he sustained a hamstring problem during his side\u2019s goalless draw at Old Trafford last Saturday. \u201cHe played so well at Manchester United. He was really good,\u201d said Hodgson. \u201cHis work rate was excellent, he did a really, really good job for the team. \u201cWe were looking forward so much to get him back (from the Africa Cup of Nations) and we\u2019ve not had the benefit we would have liked from that. These things happen in football.\u201d (PA Media)   Updated at 3.34pm GMT    3.22pm    Premier League matches will be blocked by Chinese broadcasters this weekend because of planned displays of solidarity with Ukraine. Under the banner \u201cFootball Stands Together\u201d, club captains will wear armbands in the colours of Ukraine this weekend and a \u201cmoment of reflection and solidarity\u201d will take place before kick-off. The gestures of solidarity are to feature in international broadcast feeds of all Premier League fixtures, and the league\u2019s Chinese broadcast partner, IQIYI Sports, has informed the league that matches will not be broadcast in the country as a result.      3.19pm    La Liga fixtures for this weekend: FridayDeportivo Alav\u00e9s v Sevilla SaturdayOsasuna v Villarreal Espanyol v Getafe Valencia v Granada Real Madrid v Real Sociedad Sunday C\u00e1diz v Rayo VallecanoElche v BarcelonaCelta Vigo v Mallorca Real Betis v Atl\u00e9tico Madrid MondayAthletic Club v Levante     3.07pm    The Everton manager Frank Lampard says the sanctioning of one of the club\u2019s main sponsors, Alisher Usmanov, has not impacted on his work. On Thursday the owner of USM, which sponsors the Finch Farm training complex, was the latest Russian billionaire to have restrictive measures imposed in response to Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.  The club had already announced earlier in the week they had suspended all dealings with Usmanov\u2019s companies - MegaFon had a deal at Goodison Park while smartphone company Yota was the women\u2019s team\u2019s shirt sponsor. \u201cI haven\u2019t any conversations on that and it hasn\u2019t impacted on my side at all,\u201d said Lampard.  USM has also paid for first option on bidding for naming rights for the new ground currently being constructed at Bramley Moore Dock, and Lampard was asked whether there were any worries about the future of that project.  \u201cI don\u2019t have concerns and by that I mean I don\u2019t have enough information to comment on the stadium,\u201d he said. \u201cMy focus has to be on the pitch and the job I\u2019m here to do.\u201d  Lampard is hopeful of having Dominic Calvert-Lewin back for Monday\u2019s trip to Tottenham after the forward missed the last two matches with a groin problem. Another forward, Demarai Gray, should be available after he sat out Thursday\u2019s FA Cup win over non-league Boreham Wood with a fever. The midfielder Andre Gomes is back after a thigh problem but the centre-back Ben Godfrey is not set to return to training until next week due to a hamstring injury. (PA Media)   Updated at 3.10pm GMT    2.59pm   Turkish businessman Bayrak \"discussing terms\" to buy Chelsea  Muhsin Bayrak is trying to buy Chelsea, according to reports in Turkey. The Turkish businessman is quoted as saying: \u201cWe are discussing the terms of Chelsea\u2019s purchase with Roman Abramovich\u2019s lawyers. We are in the negotiation phase. We will fly the Turkish flag in London soon.\u201d     2.50pm    Serie A fixtures for this weekend: there\u2019s a huge game on Sunday night when Napoli, who went top on goal difference with a 2-1 win against Lazio last Sunday thanks to Fabian Ruiz\u2019s late goal, host fellow table-toppers Milan: FridayInternazionale v Salernitana SaturdayUdinese v SampdoriaRoma v Atalanta Cagliari v Lazio SundayGenoa v Empoli Bologna v Torino Fiorentina v VeronaVenezia v SassuoloJuventus v SpeziaNapoli v Milan   Updated at 2.53pm GMT    2.45pm    Back to our regular programming. The Manchester United manager Ralf Rangnick has been opining about club\u2019s need to develop a \u2018corporate identity\u2019 similar to Manchester City. I thought a corporate identity was the one thing United had nailed, but there you go. Rangnick said: \u201cGuardiola has a clear idea of how he wants to play. This idea is the headline for everything that happens at the club - recruitment, players they will sign or, at one stage, sell,\u201d Rangnick told reporters ahead of Sunday\u2019s Manchester derby at the Etihad. \u201cThis is the secret behind their success. They have a clear corporate identity and this is their guideline for everything that they do. That is for new players and staff members. This is what all top clubs in Europe have in common and this is something that needs to be developed and improved at Manchester United in the next couple of years.\u201d (Quotes via PA)     2.35pm    Thanks very much David. I\u2019m staggered by the news about Shane Warne.  From the ECB\u2019s YouTube in 2013, Mike Gatting recalls receiving the \u2018Ball of the Century\u2019: \u201cI keep seeing it, and it looks a pretty decent ball to me ... Would I have swept it? Could I have swept it? ... Well bowled, Warney, unlucky me.\u201d  RIP Shane Warne.  Updated at 2.37pm GMT    2.31pm    Righty, that\u2019s my stint over. I\u2019ll hand you back to Luke McLaughlin for the rest of the afternoon. Cheers.     2.29pm    Cristiano Ronaldo has managed just one goal in his last 10 games. Cook that how you like but let\u2019s go with Craig Dawson has two in his last four. As for failing to score more goals, Manchester United boss Ralf Rangnick wasn\u2019t too concerned when addressing the issue today. \u201cWe created enough in the last 10, 11 games. At times we converted them, like at Leeds, for example, where we scored four goals. \u201cBut it\u2019s correct we should have scored more goals, especially in the last game against Watford. We should have scored at least one, two, three goals in order to win the game. \u201cBut I would be more worried actually if we didn\u2019t create chances.\u201d     2.21pm    Back to Sunday\u2019s Manchester derby and a few stats to chew over.  Premier League meetings between Manchester City and Manchester United have seen the away team win more often than in any other fixture in the competition\u2019s history (21)    Man City\u2019s Raheem Sterling is still yet to score in 18 Premier League appearances against Manchester United    Manchester United are looking to win four consecutive away games in all competitions against Man City for the first time since a run of four between November 1993 and November 2000   Grounds for Pep Guardiola to be cautious.      2.13pm    Antonio Conte admits he already knows the extra feeling of exasperation that comes with being the manager of Tottenham Hotspur. In a classic Spurs-y week, he\u2019s watched his team score a memorable 3-2 win at leaders Manchester City and then crash out of the FA Cup to Championship side Middlesbrough. Here\u2019s Conte\u2019s take. \u201cTottenham\u2019s story is this, many ups and downs. To be competitive and try to win something and try to fight for something important and to become a strong team, the first thing that has to happen is to be stable and to avoid these ups and downs. \u201cTo do this and to change this type of situation that has been for many, many years is not simple. In a short term it is impossible to do this, not only me but for every manager to come here and change the situation. \u201cThis story of this club for the last 20 years.\u201d Lots of Tottenham fans nodding in agreement.  As for team news for Monday\u2019s home game with Everton, Conte gave this update. \u201cBentancur is available, the same for Lucas Moura. For Skipp and Tanganga they are not available, we have to wait.\u201d     2.01pm   Ruben Dias to miss four to six weeks with injury  Pep Guardiola has revealed that defender Ruben Dias will be absent for four to six weeks due to a hamstring injury. Dias was taken off at half-time during the FA Cup tie at Peterborough in midweek, as was fellow centre-back Nathan Ake. Guardiola explained: \u201cMuscular. Hamstring. Four to six weeks. It happens. In other seasons our best players have been out for months. I\u2019d love him but he\u2019s not there, I will not cry. It is what it is. We have decent players available. We have 14-15 players. With these players we are going to fight and try to play good. Impossible to fight if you don\u2019t play good. We play with our people and hopefully our people support as they always do.\u201d  Updated at 2.03pm GMT    1.53pm    Next, some Manchester United team news for Sunday\u2019s derby showdown with City. Ralf Rangnick reckons he\u2019ll be able to call on the services of Edinson Cavani again following the striker\u2019s groin issue that caused him to miss five games. The Uruguayan\u2019s absence was certainly felt during the 0-0 draw with Watford last weekend which dented United\u2019s hopes of grabbing a top-four finish. \u201cHe\u2019s back in training since yesterday. Today was his second training session with the team,\u201d said the German coach.  \u201cIt looks good so I think he could at least be part of the group for Sunday. \u201cApart from that, we have two or three question marks behind some players but we will have to wait and see what happens by tomorrow or Sunday. \u201cBut Edinson I think as it stands now will be part of the group.\u201d  Updated at 2.43pm GMT    1.46pm    While we\u2019re on Liverpool, some team news for the West Ham game: The centre-back Joel Matip, who has been far more robust this season, misses out due to an illness (not Covid-related) while Thiago Alc\u00e2ntara\u2019s pesky hamstring still isn\u2019t right. Elsewhere in midfield, Curtis Jones and Naby Keita will be given late assessments. \u201cSo from eight midfielders to four midfielders in a week, that can happen easily,\u201d said Klopp.   Updated at 3.36pm GMT    1.41pm    Some more from J\u00fcrgen Klopp. There was talk of the Liverpool manager\u2019s future plans during today\u2019s press conference, a subject that will cause all Reds fans to put fingers in ears and and hum until all such nasty, don\u2019t-want-to-think-about-it talk has stopped. His current five-year deal was signed in 2019 so, how about it then J\u00fcrgen, surely this sexy, quadruple-chasing squad will make you want to stay on? \u201cThe plan is still the same, nothing changed really. If I decide to leave in 2024 it is nothing to do with the quality of the squad: \u2018My God, I have to manage them\u2019 or \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019d better stop managing them\u2019. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing to do with that. All we do is for the long term. This club must be even better especially when I am not here any more and that\u2019s the plan, that\u2019s what we are working on. \u201cIt\u2019s not so important how long I will stay, it is much more important what we do until then.\u201d     1.34pm    Thankyou. While Luke heads off to do Wordle in 3, I\u2019ll fill in for an hour.     1.30pm    Dan Roan of the BBC is reporting that Chinese rights-holders have informed the Premier League that matches will not be broadcast this weekend, \u201cbecause of planned shows of support for Ukraine\u201d. More to come on that I\u2019m sure ... for now, I\u2019ll hand you over to my colleague David Tindall for a spell.     1.26pm    \u201cWhen Chelsea and Manchester City step out at a sold-out Plough Lane on Saturday, it will be, somewhat incomprehensibly, the first time English football\u2019s two dominant teams of recent years have met in a cup final.\u201d Suzanne Wrack speaks to the Chelsea full-back Jonna Andersson before the Continental League Cup final:      1.21pm    Patrick Vieira was also asked about Roman Abramovich: \u201cHe helped the Premier League to grow ... 20 years, 19 trophies ... regardless of what\u2019s going on, I strongly believe he was one of those people who helped the Premier League to be successful.\u201d     1.17pm    Patrick Vieira has told Crystal Palace to stay focused on the Premier League and not allow their FA Cup run to distract them ahead of fixtures with Wolves and Manchester City in March. The Eagles progressed to the last eight of the competition with a 2-1 win against Stoke this week and discovered on Thursday they will host Everton for a semi-final spot, which would mean a trip to Wembley.  Palace are nine points clear the relegation zone but the 45-year-old urged his squad to focus on the league. \u201cNo, honestly we did not talk about the draw at all,\u201d Vieira said. \u201cThe only conversation this morning in training was about the Wolves game and how important it is for us. We have had some positive results lately and it is important for us to keep that momentum.  \u201cWe wanted to have a really good run in the FA Cup and so far it has been good but there is still the game to come against Everton and a long way to go (before Wembley). We don\u2019t want to get carried away or be too excited for it. We are pleased with where we are but we still know there are massive games to play before the FA Cup. In the league the games coming before will be massively important for us because we need points, need wins but going through builds this momentum, confidence and excitement we need and want.\u201d (PA Media)      1.03pm    Pep Guardiola and Ralf Rangnick are up soon, looking ahead to Sunday\u2019s Manchester derby. Frank Lampard will also be along to talk Spurs v Everton.  Updated at 1.06pm GMT    12.57pm    The lowdown on Norwich v Brentford here (Saturday 3pm), courtesy of Conrad Leach:      12.47pm    Sky Sports News are running an interview with Wout Weghorst of Burnley ... and it emerges that he once beat Michael Van Gerwen at darts! \u201cWe played once, it was at the [Dutch] national team ... at the end we played from 301, we played down, and then I beat him. Of course that was crazy, it was really nice, but he was a little bit angry and he wanted to play more two more games and there I had no chance.\u201d Weghorst says he threw two 140s and then nailed a double. Only one word for that: magic darts.   Updated at 12.54pm GMT    12.43pm    Liverpool meet West Ham at Anfield tomorrow at 5.30pm. The manager J\u00fcrgen Klopp is asked if he is enjoying chasing down Manchester City at the top of the Premier League: \u201cI have to be careful whatever I say then you, some of you, will make something really weird of it. I enjoy the situation that we\u2019re in, that\u2019s true ... I really want to win tomorrow, really ... but if we lose, you will all sit here [the media] and tell me the title race is over now ... and these kind of things. I don\u2019t have enough capacity for all these different scenarios. I don\u2019t really think about it. The only thing I think about is to prepare for West Ham, and then Inter [in the Champions League], and Brighton ... they\u2019re all so difficult to play. I cannot think about what we can win in the end ... I am barely smart enough to get enough concentration and maybe focus for one game, and not the whole general situation. \u201cWe are obviously not in the worst moment, but there are so many challenges ahead of us that I really ... I don\u2019t feel in a \u2018chasing mood\u2019 [against Man City], or whatever, but hopefully we\u2019re ready to face West Ham in a better way than when we played them there.\u201d It is mentioned that David Moyes has never managed a team to win at Anfield: \u201cLong may it continue ... What West Ham is doing is incredibly good ... I\u2019m really pleased for David, he\u2019s really a nice colleague ... making smart transfers, bringing really good players in and having ... it\u2019s a really strong side, I have to say. Against us, traditionally, they are more defence-orientated with counterattacking but if you let them play football now, with this team ... [Jarrod] Bowen, what a player he became, unbelievable ... [Sa\u00efd] Benrahma, outstanding, [Pablo] Fornals, outstanding, [Michail] Antonio, outstanding.\u201d  Updated at 1.12pm GMT    12.27pm    Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl hopes Southampton\u2019s key men will feel they can wait a little longer before thinking about moving on. The Saints are on an upward trajectory following an unbeaten run of seven matches in all competitions.  Hasenh\u00fcttl takes his squad to Aston Villa on Saturday, where they are set to meet the forward Danny Ings who left in the summer. The Denmark defender Jannik Vestergaard also departed during August, joining Leicester.  Hasenh\u00fcttl believes the outlook for a longer stay at St Mary\u2019s should now appear more appealing: \u201cIt is not about was it the right or wrong decision letting [players] go. We were without alternatives with what we did in the summer, to be honest,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we have now a situation which is a very good learning atmosphere here at the moment, everybody improves, everybody has a positive effect. This is not something normally naturally given in this business.  \u201cYou have tough moments and we also had those here, where it is not so nice to be in this club. But at the moment you can feel that the team is growing and we are in a very good flow I think. That doesn\u2019t mean that super-talented guys have to stay with us for the next 10 years. Everybody is ambitious and wants one time in his life to come to a top club.  \u201cThis is understandable, we always want to develop them. When they develop, we do as a club, then it is OK when they want to take the next step. But I always say \u2018be very careful when is the right moment\u2019 and \u2018you don\u2019t want it to be too early too much\u2019. Not (stay) for the rest of our life but for a necessary time to develop, and this is very often what I tell my players.\u201d (PA Media)     12.20pm    The Brighton manager Graham Potter insists Dan Burn\u2019s impact at Newcastle has come as no surprise. Towering defender Burn completed a \u00a313m switch from Brighton to St James\u2019 Park on the final day of the January transfer window.  \u201cI think he has done really well,\u201d said Potter. \u201cWhat we would expect of him, I would say, because everyone held him in such high regard here. He was fantastic for me. I think he is playing with a real confidence and a real maturity that he had, and it is nice that he\u2019s taken that to his new club, and we are pleased for him.  \u201cObviously we don\u2019t want it to go so well for him at the weekend, but apart from that we wish him well. The guys have been in touch with him and I\u2019ll look forward to seeing him at the game. It is an exciting move for him, and an exciting time.\u201d  Regarding Newcastle\u2019s recent uptick under Eddie Howe, Potter said: \u201cThey\u2019re more on the front foot, more intense, they attack and defend better. Everything has grown in terms of results and positivity, they\u2019ve had the investment, the crowd has become a lot more positive.  \u201cEddie and his staff have been the catalyst for that and they\u2019ve not just invested in players, they\u2019ve improved the ones that were there before. I think everything has improved and that shows in the results.\u201d   Updated at 12.21pm GMT    12.17pm    So, for Roman Abramovich,  after 19 years of being garlanded in Britain for the glittering success his money bought for Chelsea football club, the game is finally up. A whole era in which the government, Premier League and crowds of London professionals were untroubled by the well-documented way the Russian oligarch had amassed his fortunes crashed when Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine.      12.16pm    Clyde are in the process of terminating David Goodwillie\u2019s loan deal after the striker was banned from their stadium. North Lanarkshire Council wrote to the League One club telling them they would be immediately evicted if the striker entered Broadwood. The re-signing of Goodwillie has also resulted in the council telling the club they will not have their lease renewed in 2023.  A brief Clyde statement read: \u201cThe club are in the process of terminating the loan agreement with Raith Rovers for David Goodwillie.\u201d Goodwillie rejoined Clyde on loan earlier this week, four weeks after his move to Raith sparked a major backlash from sponsors, employees and supporters of the Fife club. There was further criticism from the likes of First Minister Nicola Sturgeon when it emerged Clyde and Raith had agreed a loan deal for the 32-year-old, who was ruled by a judge at a civil court case in 2017 to have raped a woman.  Goodwillie returned to action on Tuesday in a Glasgow Cup tie against Rangers B at the Scottish champions\u2019 training ground. But Clyde Ladies Football Club announced on Wednesday that their general manager had resigned and all of their players no longer wished to play for the club, and North Lanarkshire Council took action on Thursday. (PA Media)     12.10pm    And here\u2019s the Burnley v Chelsea match preview from Graham Searles:      12.07pm    Last but not least from Tuchel. It is suggested to him that playing Burnley is a very different challenge to facing Liverpool or Manchester City: \u201cVery different, and fair enough, because every team has its style and they had huge success throughout the years, they\u2019re very consistent in what they\u2019re doing and how they\u2019re approaching their games, it\u2019s very physical, it\u2019s very direct, it\u2019s very direct up front, a lot of crosses, very dangerous at set pieces.  \u201cWe think we know what\u2019s coming and still we hold ourselves back and and don\u2019t allow ourselves too much to predict ... in the end, it\u2019s to enable the players to find answers on the pitch and not today in the meeting. They need to find solutions and they need to be well prepared ... I think we played a very good match [against Burnley in the 1-1 draw in November] ... we had a look into it ... we created a lot ... and we were punished in the end with a very typical Burnley goal that we could not defend ... we\u2019re looking for a better outcome tomorrow.\u201d     11.59am    The Norwich head coach Dean Smith knows time is running out on his side\u2019s battle for Premier League survival as they prepare for Saturday\u2019s \u201cmust not lose\u201d showdown with Brentford. The Canaries sit bottom of the table, five points from safety, following a run of three straight league defeats. However, victory over a Brentford side who have lost seven of the past eight league games would breath life back into the survival bid - and also drag teams above them into the equation again.  \u201cI don\u2019t think anything is a must-win at the moment, but it is certainly a \u2018must not lose\u2019,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe are going into each game that we have to try to win. We know we are running out of games, there are a dozen left. It is a big game for both teams \u2013 a loss against them means they are 10 points ahead of us.   \u201cThey are one of the clubs who came up with us last season and we all know how hard it is to stay in the league in the first season. We feel we are ready and have a fairly full squad to go into it as well.\u201d  Following such a positive start to their campaign, the Bees now sit only three points above the drop zone and having played more games than the teams below them. Smith was manager at Griffin Park before he left for Aston Villa, with his assistant Thomas Frank promoted to manager in October 2018. \u201cI had three great years at Brentford. You could see the direction they were going in,\u201d said Smith, who took over at Norwich in November. \u201cBrentford are a strong squad and they have proved that. If you have been promoted then you have usually been winning, but when you start losing it is a different feeling.\u201d (PA Media)  Updated at 11.59am GMT    11.56am    More Tuchel \u2013 Will the club\u2019s sale impact negotiations on new contracts with the players whose deals are close to ending? \u201cMaybe the bottom line is we cannot help it. It\u2019s what it is. You never know, maybe it has a positive effect on the negotiation. Maybe it has a negative effect ... we cannot predict ... of course, like I said, everybody has a different situation ... still I think Chelsea is a strong club and will stay a strong club ... our owner sells a strong, solid and very well-organised club on the highest level.\u201d Can the success of the Abramovich era be repeated? \u201cWe will see. Let\u2019s speak in the next 20 years. Whoever buys it is lucky to have it.\u201d     11.49am    Are any summer transfer plans on hold for Tuchel given the current situation? \u201cActually to be totally honest there are no talks at the moment for summer ... it\u2019s simply a bit too early ... the main focus in the last weeks ... was on the different competitions and to be as successful as we can only be ... we are in a good place at the moment ... it\u2019s still a long way to go [until summer].\u201d  Updated at 11.50am GMT    11.47am    Tuchel is asked a question regarding the doubt on the future of Marina Granovskaia, the Chelsea director: \u201cI will not comment on any speculation about that, but my communication with Petr and Marina was excellent from day one. Marina is ill at the moment, otherwise she would have been here. There is no doubt she would have briefed everybody ... There is no doubt this [club sale] will continue for the next days, weeks, months ... I hope it stays on the same level, hopefully with the same person. If not, OK, we need to adapt. It seems we need to adapt on a daily basis to new situations.\u201d Would a change of ownership lead him to question his own future at Chelsea? \u201cI have the opposite of a problem staying here ... I love working in the Premier League, I love to be in England and feel the tradition and the love for sports in general, and for football in particular, it\u2019s an amazing place to be. Chelsea is from my point of view, for me, a perfect fit ... and hopefully it continues ... I am used and trained to deal with it [uncertainty] on different levels ... but this is quite a level, I have to be honest, but I\u2019m positive and hope things will end well.\u201d  Updated at 11.51am GMT    11.38am    Thomas Tuchel is asked about the ongoing situation at Chelsea and how the club being put up for sale may be affecting players and staff: \u201cWe had a briefing here after the [Luton] game, the day after the match, from Petr [Cech] who gave everybody here in the building, not only the players, a quick brief and explained the situation, not too much that we did not already know. So we have to live in this situation.  \u201cIt does not make sense to worry too much, because we don\u2019t have a lot of influence, not to say no influence at all. So that was the bottom line, we are allowed to focus on football, and do the best to focus on football ... this is what we try to do anyway, to create an atmosphere where you feel safe once you enter the building, where you feel calm ... because we do this on a daily basis and this can can help now to deal with this situation.  \u201cOf course there is uncertainty ... of course there will be, like with all humans, there are almost 100 people in the building ... and everybody will feel different about this. Some will feel scared, some will feel excited, some will feel, I don\u2019t know, sad. And I think everything is allowed for every individual ... but we should allow ourselves to focus on what we love this most, and this is football, and to perform the best way possible.\u201d Chelsea travel to Burnley tomorrow for a 3pm kick-off in the Premier League.  Updated at 11.42am GMT    11.27am    When Manchester City\u2019s midfielder Caroline Weir came off the bench in the first of back-to-back Manchester derbies three weeks ago and found herself, six minutes later, in an almost identical position to the one she was in for her Puskas award-nominated chip last year, it was all instinct. \u201cAt practice, when I see that area just outside the box, on that angle, it\u2019s subconscious that I always try a little dink,\u201d the 26-year-old says. \u201cI try it in training and in every matchday warmup, in the shooting. It\u2019s something I practise a lot so when I tried it again, I wasn\u2019t overly surprised that I tried it. They definitely don\u2019t all come off.\u201d      11.14am    Poya Asbaghi was at Zurich airport waiting for a connecting flight to Stockholm from Barcelona when the then assistant manager of Dalkurd, a team founded by the Kurdish diaspora in the Swedish county of Dalarna, received a panicked call from the chairman. \u201cHe asked: \u2018Where are you?\u2019\u201d says Asbaghi, now the head coach of Barnsley. \u201cI told him I was in Switzerland and he said: \u2018One of those planes from Barcelona has crashed.\u2019 I didn\u2019t know which plane but, of course, you start doing the maths. I understood that there was a bigger chance that some of our players were on that flight than not. We didn\u2019t get to speak more before we had to go on our next flight. We were sitting on that flight just thinking about which players might have died, basically.\u201d      11.09am    The Newcastle manager, Eddie Howe, was also asked about the situation with Chelsea and the impact on that club of the war in Ukraine \u2013 and if he is concerned that political issues could impact Newcastle in a similar way given their financial backing from Saudi Arabia, and its involvement in armed conflict.  Howe refused to comment on other clubs, and said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to get drawn into that. I\u2019m not going to predict what people will do. I\u2019ll only react to clear facts that I have in front of me. I think commenting on things like that is not relevant to me. I\u2019m a football manager and I\u2019m coaching the team to get results. And that\u2019s all I\u2019m going to comment on.\u201d  Updated at 1.11pm GMT    11.00am    Will Jesse Marsch make an instant impact at Leeds? Will C-Ron rouse Manchester United to get a result in Sunday\u2019s derby against City? Which Harry Kane will turn up for Spurs against Everton on Monday night? Get your Talking Points here:      10.52am    Norwich City host Brentford at Carrow Road (3pm tomorrow). The Canaries manager, Dean Smith, speaks: \u201cThey\u2019re one of the clubs that came up with us last season. It\u2019s a big game for both clubs ... we feel we\u2019re ready, and it\u2019s nice we\u2019ve got a fairly full squad to go into it with, as well.\u201d On Christian Eriksen\u2019s return following his cardiac arrest during last year\u2019s Euros: \u201cEveryone is so pleased to see, No 1, that he\u2019s here with us, and No 2, that he\u2019s back doing what he loves, playing football. I\u2019ve spoken to my friends at Brentford and they say he\u2019s in really good spirits ... I think everyone in football is pleased to see him out there.\u201d   Updated at 10.54am GMT    10.42am    Breaking news from 2008: On this day 14 years ago, Arsenal became the first English club to beat AC Milan at San Siro, with goals from Fabregas and Adebayor:  More live press conference news coming up as soon as I get it ...     10.32am    A typically excellent piece here by Jonathan Wilson, on why Chelsea are unlikely to find another Abramovich:   Updated at 10.36am GMT    10.25am    More from Eddie Howe, who is speaking to the media now to preview Newcastle\u2019s match against Brighton: On Dan Burn, the centre-back who signed from Brighton in January: \u201cHe\u2019s a great lad and has mixed well with the team. He\u2019s got the respect of everyone with how he\u2019s conducted himself and he\u2019s trained very well. He had to be patient for a little period but when he got his chance in the team he\u2019s performed very strongly.\u201d On Ryan Fraser: \u201cHe has played very well for me on the left [at Bournemouth]. I\u2019ve used him more off the right here due to Maxi preferring that side too so it\u2019s a difficult one. I\u2019ve said before that good players can play in multiple positions and Ryan\u2019s proved that.\u201d On Joelinton, who scored the opener in the win against Brentford last week: \u201cI think there\u2019s centre-forward qualities in there. Last week we saw that \u2013 it was a brilliant header. It was great to see him attack the box. His flexibility is something we\u2019ll utilise but he\u2019s doing so well in midfield I\u2019m reluctant to move him.\u201d On the atmosphere at St James\u2019 Park: \u201cIt\u2019s hugely important. I can\u2019t thank everybody enough. I have to compliment @worflags on the effort and detail they go into to make a difference to the visual look of the stadium. It\u2019s incredible. That all plays a part.\u201d Again, all quotes courtesy of Newcastle on Twitter.  Updated at 10.43am GMT    10.19am   Mansour spokesman denies plan to bid for Chelsea  It could be another eventful day at Chelsea as Roman Abramovich\u2019s attempts to sell the club continue. A consortium headed by Hansjorg Wyss and Todd Boehly leads the race to buy the club and negotiations are ongoing.  There has also been speculation that Loutfy Mansour, an Egyptian businessman and a season ticket holder at Chelsea, could launch a takeover bid. However, his spokesman told me this morning: \u201cIn light of the recent media speculation, we want to make it clear that we are not pursuing a bid for Chelsea Football Club at this time.\u201d     10.18am   Wales anticipate delay to World Cup tie v Austria  Wales\u2019s World Cup play-off against Austria will be delayed should Fifa postpone Scotland\u2019s clash with Ukraine, Football Association of Wales chief executive Noel Mooney has suggested. Fifa confirmed on Thursday that Ukraine have requested a postponement of their play-off semi-final in Glasgow on 24 March following the Russian invasion.  Ukraine or Scotland are due to visit the winners of the Wales v Austria game on 29 March to determine a place at the World Cup in Qatar later this year.  \u201cWe are planning to play against Austria on March 24 at the Cardiff City Stadium,\u201d Mooney told BBC Radio Wales. \u201cI spoke to Rob Page (Wales manager) yesterday and we are all set for that. But then news came through about Ukraine requesting postponement of the match to June.\u201d  Football has been suspended in Ukraine and it is now expected that Fifa will grant the request for the play-off at Hampden Park to be postponed. Asked about the likelihood of Wales\u2019s game being delayed to June should the Scotland v Ukraine semi-final be played then, Mooney said: \u201cUntil we get official clarification of that, you can surmise it. We can surmise that, but that\u2019s not what we have at the moment. We know Ukraine have asked for a postponement until June, but these things change quite quickly.  \u201cI have spoken to my Ukrainian counterpart and will speak to him again. We\u2019ll definitely make the right decision for football and for our friends in Ukraine, and at the same time balance it against the fact we\u2019d like to qualify for our first World Cup since 1958.\u201d (PA Media)     10.13am    The Newcastle manager, Eddie Howe, is having a chat with the media now looking ahead to the meeting with Brighton at St James\u2019 Park tomorrow, a 3pm kick-off.  Fitness update: \u201cMaxi [Allan Saint-Maximin] hasn\u2019t trained yet with us but we\u2019re hoping he does today. We\u2019ll have to make a decision based off how he looks and how is injury status is after the session. Other than that, we\u2019re as we were pre-Brentford.\u201d On the overall strength of the squad: \u201cWhen I first came in to the job we wanted competition for places in all positions. I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re absolutely there yet, but I think there\u2019s a healthy competition in the squad.\u201d \u201cI think players are elevating their levels and there\u2019s a fight to get in the team. Then when you\u2019re in it you have to fight to stay in it. Maxi coming back will give everyone a lift and hopefully he gets through today, then we\u2019ll make the decision.\u201d Quotes via NUFC Twitter.  Updated at 11.03am GMT    10.06am   Preamble  War in Europe rages on but that won\u2019t stop the football. At least not yet. Added to the usual late-season Premier League questions \u2013 who will win the title? who will be relegated? \u2013 there is another significant unknown, to which we should have the answer within a couple of weeks: who is going to buy Chelsea? Potential suitors are preparing their offers and Thomas Tuchel is getting sick of the questions and it promises to be another day when Chelsea dominates the football news agenda \u2013 and of course there is a full programme of domestic action across the UK and Europe to look forward to.

                    "body": "In hindsight, it probably was not the best of ideas to throw a boozy party for most of his MPs the night before Prime Minister\u2019s Questions, even if he had strong-armed someone else into picking up the tab. Because the Boris Johnson that turned up in the chamber gave the appearance of either being out of his head on a combination of quaaludes and psychedelics or still desperately hungover. Either way, what we got was the Suspect at his most incoherent self. Not that this seemed to bother any of the Tory backbenchers who appear supremely unworried both by the cost of living crisis or proof of criminality inside No 10. And by the fact that their leader can give effusive support to Tory MP Jamie Wallis, who had just revealed he had gender dysphoria, the day after he had opened his dinner party speech with a trans joke. No disconnect there. They happily cheered whatever lies Boris chose to tell. And there were plenty of them; from the Tories having reduced the tax burden to Labour being hellbent on taking the UK back into both lockdown and the EU. Keir Starmer was also having a bad day. His questions lacked their usual focus and Johnson was able to get away more easily than usual without answering anything directly. Time and again, the Labour leader was unable to pin the greased piglet down. He could not even really make Partygate count, despite the Suspect continuing to insist that no lockdown rules had been broken in No 10. No matter that the police have issued 20 fixed penalty notices and counting. The closest anyone got to unsettling Johnson was Labour\u2019s Sarah Champion when she asked him how he slept at night. The answer being that he gets pissed at parties. Or by himself. It was more of the same when the Suspect appeared before the liaison committee \u2013 the parliamentary supergroup of select committee chairs \u2013 midway through the afternoon, only rather more soporific. The hangover hadn\u2019t gone away and it was all Johnson could do not to doze off. The effect was clearly contagious. Most of the committee chairs were also struggling to stay awake and the session was catatonically dull. For a brief moment at the start, things had looked rather more promising when committee chair Clive Betts \u2013 deputising for Bernard Jenkin who had Covid: a loss to comedy if nothing else, as no one takes himself more seriously than Bernie \u2013 ripped up the schedule and allowed Pete Wishart and Catherine McKinnell to ask questions on Partygate. So were you one of the 20 to receive a fixed penalty notice, Wishart enquired. The Suspect toyed with the toddler haircut and forced one eye half open. \u201cI\u2019m sure you would know if I were,\u201d he mumbled. After that it was all downhill. Wishart continued to rattle through his questions. Could any prime minister survive being busted and found guilty? Was breaking the ministerial code a resigning matter? Would he accept that issuing FPNs was proof that criminality had taken place? Could he explain why his answers on parties had changed from \u201cThey never took place\u201d to \u201cI was outraged that other people had been to lockdown parties\u201d to \u201cI didn\u2019t realise I was breaking the law\u201d? To every question, the Suspect pleaded the 5th amendment. \u201cNo comment,\u201d he said repeatedly. It was like an episode of Line of Duty. Johnson could not possibly say anything because he did not know how much dirt the police had on him. So it was best to say nothing for fear of further incriminating himself. He would be very happy to come back to the liaison committee at a later date when the police had convicted him. Or not. He didn\u2019t sound like a man who was overly concerned one way or another. No one really expected him to tell the truth \u2013 even Dominic Raab, the deputy prime minister, was now admitting Johnson could only tell the truth \u201cto the best of his ability\u201d. Which was a very low bar. The point was further made when McKinnell asked how he felt about a petition calling for lying to the commons to be made a criminal offence. The Suspect shook his head. He tried to tell the truth, he said. But he just could not prevent the lies from spewing out of his mouth. He had already forgotten the lies he had told during PMQs. And he was definitely not responsible for any future lies that he would tell that afternoon. Like saying to Stephen Timms that he had corrected a previous lie about the employment figures. Or that he would just lapse into fantasy about how there were now 1.3 million people fewer in absolute poverty \u2013 which just so happened to be the exact number of people thinktanks had predicted would be tipped into absolute poverty as a result of his government\u2019s tax hikes. The rest of the session was devoted to Ukraine and the cost of living and proved to be spectacularly unrevealing. The highlights were Bill Wiggin, who has just come back from an expenses paid trip to Qatar, asking for more visas for, er, Qataris and Neil Parish wanging on for a full minute and a half about fertiliser. It was comedy gold. The Suspect tried to look interested and ended up promising both men the earth, as he had with all the other select committee chairs. Then that\u2019s how Johnson operates. It\u2019s classic Boris. Drag everyone down to your level. Keep the waters as muddy as possible. That way no one can see your own shit."

                    "body": "THE FINALISSIMA COUNTDOWN The biggest game of football tonight is, of course, the emotional World Cup qualifying playoff between Ukraine, currently under invasion by Russia, and Scotland, colonised since 1707. Good luck to one and all there. However in a masterclass of scheduling, another notable fixture is taking place this evening a few hundred miles south of Hampden Park. A Wembley showdown between European champions Italy and Copa America winners Argentina: the 2022 Finalissima! [Fiver spends a couple of frantic minutes on Google]  The Finalissima \u2013 which is Italian for Grand Final, which is rugbyleaguespeak for Ersatz Super Bowl Lite Occasion \u2013 is a revival of the Artemio Franchi Cup which was [Fiver spends a bit more hectic time on Google] last played in 1993 between 1991 Copa America champions Argentina and Euro 92 surprise package Denmark. You, and by extension the Fiver, can be forgiven for not knowing too much about this trophy because (1) it wasn\u2019t mentioned in Big Paper at the time, not a word; (2) there was only one previous staging, a highly random eight years earlier, France welcoming Uruguay to Paris in 1985, presumably without pepper spraying them; and (3) we occasionally forget that it\u2019s not worth arranging things in a numbered list when you\u2019ve only got two of them. Anyway, now The Man has revived it, taken erstwhile Uefa president Franchi\u2019s name off it, slapped on a new and suitably pompous moniker, and here we are, at long last, with edition number three. Tonight\u2019s match will probably mean a little more to Italy, who ballsed up their World Cup qualification true and proper, again, and could do with something to cheer themselves up as a sullen and broken Roberto Mancini begins the Azzurri\u2019s painful rebuild. Argentina wouldn\u2019t say no either, mind you, on account of their being the proud, if almost certainly unaware, holders of the trophy for the last 29 years. For the record, the Albiceleste beat the Danes on penalties in 1993, while France won the other one 2-0, little-known sepia-toned facts that either lend the Finalissima a sense of history, or hammer home the point that it doesn\u2019t really matter and nobody cares.

                    "body": "As the last of the sun\u2019s rays curl away from the coast in Australia\u2019s remote north-west, Josie Alec opens her arms and sings in traditional language to a mass of ochre-coloured rocks along Hearson\u2019s Cove. But her voice competes with the low rumble of a gas production plant less than a kilometre away, its flared emissions lightly hazing the sky above the beach. This is the duality of what First Nations people refer to as Murujuga country, home to one of the world\u2019s largest and oldest collections of rock carvings as well as one of the largest new fossil fuel developments in Australia in a decade. Taking in the Burrup peninsula and the nearby Dampier archipelago, the culturally rich area has an estimated 1m ancient petroglyphs. Some of the images, including illustrations of long-extinct species such as the thylacine and flat-tailed kangaroo, are believed to date back nearly 50,000 years. Traditional custodians such as Alec and Mardudhunera woman Raelene Cooper come to Hearson\u2019s Cove to connect with nature, and the thousands of generations of their people who lived in the country before them, through song.  \u201cYou feel them in your heart and your soul, our ancestors in the rocks,\u201d Alec says. \u201cWe have to wake them up, sing them we\u2019re here, sing them we\u2019re still protecting them. Then you hear the wisdom that they have for the past and the future. And it\u2019s time for listening.\u201d But just who is listening \u2013 and who is being listened to \u2013 is a live question in Murujuga. While the historical and cultural significance of the art is uncontested, and the subject of a Unesco world heritage bid, it sits uneasily alongside the industrial city of Karratha, a settlement of about 23,000 that is about to double down on fossil fuel extraction.   Production in the region is expected to expand significantly after Woodside Energy, an Australian petroleum company, announced in November that it would proceed with a US$12bn liquified natural gas (LNG) development.  The scale of Woodside\u2019s proposal is vast. It would open an untapped gas field nearly 250 miles (400km) off the Australian coast and connect it to the mainland via a pipeline through an area rich in marine biodiversity, while expanding its existing Pluto LNG processing plant near Karratha to more than double its current capacity. Opponents say the Scarborough-to-Pluto project could lock in new polluting infrastructure expected to run beyond 2050. Researchers at Climate Analytics estimate it could lead to 1.37bn tonnes of greenhouse gases being pumped into the atmosphere across its lifetime \u2013 roughly three times the total annual emissions of Australia or the UK. Woodside and the conservative Australian government claim the Scarborough development would be good for the country and the planet. Australia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, told business leaders that when he heard Woodside had made a final decision to invest in Scarborough he celebrated with \u201ca bit of a jig\u201d. \u201cI could not be more thrilled about that,\u201d he said.  This is broadly a bipartisan view. The Labor opposition, narrowly favoured to win a national election on 21 May, also supports gas industry expansion. The Western Australian Labor state government declared it would change the law to ensure Scarborough could proceed if a legal challenge by conservationists was successful. Australia has done little to cut greenhouse gas emissions since the government was elected in 2013. Its 2030 reduction target is less than half that set by the UK and EU, and it has committed about A$1bn in public funding to a \u201cgas-fired recovery\u201d from the Covid crisis. Under pressure, Morrison set a net zero emissions goal shortly before the Cop26 UN climate summit in Glasgow in November \u2013 but his plan requires no emissions reductions and Australia was widely condemned by international leaders as a laggard in addressing the climate crisis.  Opposition to the Scarborough project has come from environmental groups and a small but determined section of the local Indigenous community. They argue it is a \u201ccarbon bomb\u201d that would be disastrous for the climate, that construction would destroy unique local marine life and acidic pollution from the production facility would damage the irreplaceable rock art.  \u201cAcross the board, Scarborough is just a terrible project,\u201d says Maggie Wood, the acting executive director of the Conservation Council of Western Australia. \u201cBut I would say the likelihood of it going ahead is high. The state and federal governments argue continual expansion of fossil fuels is a job creator, but we know that is fundamentally untrue \u2013 it doesn\u2019t bring in much money from taxes and royalties, it doesn\u2019t create that many jobs and the gas is mostly going to be exported. The reality is that fossil fuel companies have a hold over Australian politics.\u201d  Part of the problem, Wood and others argue, is that the cumulative impact of the Scarborough development had not been properly assessed before it was approved by national and state authorities. Instead it was broken up and submitted piecemeal for approval. The project is a continuation of the dramatic expansion of the Australian gas export industry across the continent\u2019s north over the past decade. LNG exports have quadrupled in volume over that time to reach about 80m tonnes, with sales forecast to top US$50bn this year, twice that of the thermal coal industry. Australia now runs neck-and-neck with Qatar in the race to be the world\u2019s biggest gas exporter. Scarborough is the most advanced of several proposals to expand that further. All are at odds with a warning last year from the head of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol, that no new gas or oilfields should be opened if the slim prospect of limiting global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels was to survive. The impact of gas expansion is clearly visible in Karratha. The city is saturated in fossil fuel money that helps pay for upmarket coffee shops and wine bars, large modern homes for gas and iron ore mining families and well-kept four-lane highways to production facilities. Many Indigenous families who have lived in the region for generations largely reside in older, comparatively rundown satellite towns such as Roebourne, a half-hour drive from Karratha\u2019s air-conditioned shopping malls. Most residents in the region, including a significant proportion of the Indigenous community, strongly support continued expansion of the fossil fuel sector that keeps the area afloat. But the gas industry is also having an impact on the region\u2019s cultural heritage. In some places, rocks have been disturbed to make way for infrastructure, and a recent peer-reviewed study found evidence that industrial pollution was \u201cactively degrading\u201d Murujuga rock art. Carmen Lawrence, a former Labor state premier and ex-chair of the Australian Heritage Council, said it was clear that gas processing was having a significant effect on petroglyphs and further expansion would only increase the duration and severity of the impact. She likened the management of the risk to the mistakes that two years ago resulted in the miner Rio Tinto\u2019s catastrophic destruction of an Aboriginal heritage site in an explosion at nearby Juukan Gorge.  Cooper, a former chair of the Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation, describes the rocks at Hearson\u2019s Cove as \u201cour church, our parliament house\u201d. She says damage is already visible, and believes world heritage status for the region is the best hope for protection. \u201cThere is no price you can put on this place,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople see the rock as just a rock with some artwork on it but, to us, they speak. They tell a story. They are alive.\u201d Woodside disputes suggestions its expansion on the Burrup poses a risk to the petroglyphs. A spokesperson said research had not demonstrated that its operations had any impact, and it was supporting a \u201cworld-best-practice programme to monitor and protect the rock art\u201d that was co-managed by the local Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation and government officials. \u201cIt is Woodside\u2019s view that traditional custodians must be central to the management of their heritage,\u201d the spokesperson said, adding the company had consulted with them and responded to requests for environmental monitoring, archaeological and ethnographic surveys and access to independent expert advice. In response to the claim the project would not create many jobs, the spokesperson said Scarborough would create 3,200 positions during construction and 300 ongoing jobs in Western Australia, including an expected 70 in Karratha. The company hopes Scarborough will be the start of a new wave of fossil fuel development in the country\u2019s north-west. In an interview with the Australian Financial Review, Woodside\u2019s chief executive, Meg O\u2019Neill, said she hoped the fallout from Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine would allow it to kickstart consideration of two other gas mega-projects that had stalled during the pandemic \u2013 the Sunrise gas reservoir in the Timor Sea and the Browse development off Western Australia.   The latter had been written off by many analysts and campaigners as commercially unviable and would be significantly more carbon-intensive than Scarborough. Woodside\u2019s fossil fuel footprint is expected to expand even more dramatically next month if its shareholders rubber-stamp a deal in which it would merge its petroleum assets with those of the global miner BHP. It would allow BHP to shed a massive decommissioning liability for its oil assets and overnight make Woodside a global top 10 oil and gas company with investments in the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean, Algeria and Australia. The company argues this is consistent with climate commitments that it says are aligned with the goals of the Paris agreement. It has a target of cutting its scope 1 and 2 emissions \u2013 those on site and from the electricity it uses \u2013 by 30% by 2030, and an \u201caspiration\u201d to reach net zero emissions \u201cby 2050 or sooner\u201d. It says avoiding and reducing emissions is its \u201cfirst priority\u201d but the use of carbon offsets \u2013 cuts in emissions elsewhere to allow it to pollute \u2013 and the development of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, which is not yet used at any scale, will be important. It aims to help reduce its scope 3 emissions \u2013 those released by its customers when they eventually burn the gas \u2013 by investing in \u201cnew energy products\u201d such as hydrogen, ammonia and CCS. It has set a US$5bn investment target in these plans by 2030, less than half the expected cost of the Scarborough development. Analysts argue that Woodside\u2019s claims on emissions are full of holes. Bill Hare, the chief executive of Climate Analytics and a recent appointee to the UN secretary general\u2019s expert group looking at the best way for non-state actors to reach net zero emissions, says Woodside \u201cdoes not have a scientific leg to stand on\u201d on emissions reduction. \u201cI don\u2019t really like the term greenwashing but there\u2019s no other word for it. Woodside is engaged in extreme greenwashing,\u201d he says. \u201cIt has no real net zero plan. It is all about using offsets to make it look like it is acting when it is not.\u201d  Hare says the annual emissions from Scarborough gas would be globally significant, with a conservative analysis suggesting they would be enough to, in effect, wipe out the emissions reduction from all the rooftop solar panels installed in Australia twice over. Roughly one in three Australian homes have solar systems. On the BHP deal, Hare says Woodside may come to regret the scale of the gargantuan rehabilitation costs the company will inherit for relatively short-term gain. \u201cI really don\u2019t see this is working out very well.\u201d Woodside is unlikely to hear the same messages from the Australian political system. Its board includes former cabinet ministers from the Liberal and Labor parties, and it has successfully lobbied governments. For example, it was part of a campaign that persuaded the state government to shelve a proposal that would have required new large fossil fuel developments to offset all emissions. Scarborough still faces a legal challenge over whether the carbon dioxide emitted during production should be considered a pollutant, but even if successful it would probably lead only to a change in the conditions under which it could be developed. It leaves little reason for hope for the traditional custodians of Hearson\u2019s Cove \u2013 but still they are here. As dusk wears on, Alec and Cooper are joined by Robyn Churnside, a Ngarluma elder who has been fighting fossil fuel and mining developments since the 1970s. She says her family is used to being minority voices of dissent and will persist. \u201cIt\u2019s about time the world listened to First Nations people, because we\u2019ve been here long, long time,\u201d she says. \u201cOur spirit in this land will never rest. It needs protection.\u201d"

                    "body": "  9.40am   What we learned \u2013 Monday 19 September  We will leave our live blog for the day here. Here\u2019s some of what made the news today:  South Australia will drop its mask mandate for public transport from tomorrow, while New South Wales will follow on Wednesday. The federal health minister, Mark Butler, has indicated some Covid rules will continue into 2023. The NSW rail union has indicated it has provided a new application to the Fair Work Commission which would see Opal machines switched off during ongoing industrial action if approved. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has said he would be very comfortable with King Charles III continuing to express his strong views on the need for action on climate change. Origin Energy announced it would divest 100% of its interest in Beetaloo Basin. The NSW state emergency service conducted about 20 flood rescues through the New England region over the weekend.  That\u2019s all from us until tomorrow. If you\u2019re following the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II, you can find our UK colleagues providing the latest updates here.  Updated at 9.43am BST    9.23am         9.09am    Mike Cannon-Brookes has \u2018reservations\u2019 about AGL\u2019s new chair Signs of instability continue to swirl at AGL Energy, Australia\u2019s biggest electricity generator. As mentioned in an earlier, the company has appointed acting chair, Patricia McKenzie, as its new chair. That followed reports last week that former Tabcorp chair Paula Dwyer was headed for that role, but then shareholders got antsy and the move was halted. Anyway, Mike Cannon-Brookes, AGL\u2019s biggest shareholder and a climate campaigner as well as a billionaire tech entrepreneur, isn\u2019t happy about McKenzie formally taking over as the AGL chair. Through his family investment vehicle, Grok Ventures, Cannon-Brookes said he has \u201creservations\u201d about McKenzie \u201cappointing herself to chair AGL given her involvement in the failed demerger and what has been a chaotic board renewal process\u201d. \u201cGrok believes AGL will be best served by a chair who is appointed externally (which we believed the board was working towards) and has either substantial renewable energy experience or major operational transformation experience,\u201d the company said. \u201cGrok again stresses the renewed Board needs independent, fresh thinking. We have one opportunity to get this right because the renewable energy transition is waiting to be captured by a reinvigorated AGL under new leadership,\u201d Grok said. And in an ominous warning, Grok said it was \u201creserving our position in relation to our voting intentions\u201d about McKenzie\u2019s appointment. More happily, Grok supported and welcomed the appointment of Miles George (formerly the head of a wind farm operator) as an independent board member, and the choice of AGL\u2019s chief financial officer, Damien Nicks, as its interim chief executive. More strife to come, you would have to think, when AGL updates the market soon about what it plans to do now its plans to split into two have been cancelled thanks to Grok\u2019s intervention. AGL\u2019s shares ended down about 2% today compared with a 0.3% drop in the benchmark ASX200 share index.  Updated at 9.25am BST    8.52am         8.45am    EU-Australia free trade deal soon to be finalised Negotiations for a long-lasting free trade deal between Australia and the European Union are on the eve of being finalised, with hopes an agreement will be ratified by 2024, AAP reports. Australian officials including the trade minister, Don Farrell, met with a delegation of the EU Parliament Committee on International Trade (INTA) at Parliament House in Canberra on Monday to discuss its progression. Negotiations with the bloc stalled under the former Morrison government over Australia\u2019s perceived lack of action on climate change, and the souring relationship with Paris after the dumping of a $90bn contract for French submarines. The EU has welcomed the Albanese government\u2019s pledge to cut emissions by 43% on 2005 levels by 2030, and Australia\u2019s strong military support for Ukraine following Russia\u2019s invasion. INTA committee chair, Bernd Lange, said the last time the entire delegation had travelled to Australia was the launch of negotiations in 2017, and he wanted this to be the \u201ceve\u201d of the conclusion of the deal. He said he wanted the trade deal ratified by the end of the EU parliament\u2019s term in 2024. Farrell, who was greeted by the EU ambassador-designate to Australia Gabriele Visentin, said discussions were \u201cbehind the eight ball\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re prepared to make all the time available that we need to achieve an agreement,\u201d he told the delegation. \u201cWe want it to be a long and lasting agreement that benefits the people of both countries, expresses our democratic values and improves on the prosperity.\u201d Farrell said officials also discussed sustainable development during the meeting, and how Australia could become a leading global supplier of green energy. The European market has a gross domestic product of about $23tn, and Australia is seeking to improve access for agricultural and industrial products as well as create new opportunities for education, financial and professional services.  Updated at 8.54am BST    8.22am    In the Victorian premier Dan Andrews\u2019 Twitter thread today on what level crossings would be removed should Labor be re-elected in November, he inadvertently made it look like he was going to be removing large parts of the inner-north suburb of Brunswick.  He\u2019s since clarified the people of Brunswick are safe, but not after the internet had a bit of fun with it.    Updated at 8.31am BST    8.16am    Victorian toddler dies after being found unresponsive in Hamilton dam A toddler is dead after being found unresponsive in a dam at a Victorian rural property, AAP reports. Emergency crews including Victoria police and the SES were called to reports of a missing child at a large property at Hamilton in the state\u2019s west at 10.15am on Monday. The child was found shortly after 1pm and taken to hospital, where they died. The death is not being treated as suspicious and a report will be prepared for the coroner.  Updated at 8.24am BST    8.14am    Investigation into truck and train collision in Victoria in July  A truck and train crash in central Victoria in July happened after a farmer opened a gate so hay could be picked up. In a preliminary report released on Monday, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau found that on the morning of the crash in July, a farmer unlocked and opened the gates of a passive level crossing, near Bendigo, to allow a truck on to their property. The crossing is not available for public access. When the driver of a V/Line passenger train saw the truck on the crossing, they sounded their horn and pulled the emergency brake but collided with the truck. The truck driver was seriously injured and the train driver suffered minor injuries. None of the V/Line train passengers were hurt. The leading car of the train was substantially damaged, with both of its bogies derailed. The accident also resulted in substantial damage to the track infrastructure and the truck. \u201c[We] will include review and examination of the arrangements for the use of this level crossing, the operation of the truck and the train involved, and the configuration of the level crossing,\u201d chief investigator Mark Smallwood said in a statement. The investigation is ongoing.  Updated at 8.20am BST    8.04am    Varroa mite eradication efforts hamper honeybee genetics program  Australia\u2019s national honeybee genetics program has suffered a significant setback after it was forced to destroy around 20 million bees in the Hunter region of NSW, due to the threat from the varroa mite, AAP reports. While around 50 queen bees in the national Plan Bee project were preserved, some 342 hives each containing around 60,000 bees have been destroyed in the past fortnight. \u201cIt\u2019s a significant impact to the project but the silver lining is that we will be able to work with the queen breeding sector around the nation and ramp up data collection and selection outcomes,\u201d Elizabeth Frost, from the NSW Department of Primary Industries and the Plan Bee project, said. While the hives at Tocal Agricultural College near Newcastle were found to be free of the deadly mite, they had to be euthanised because they fell in one of the varroa eradication zones. Under a permit system, developed to protect bees with high genetic value, 50 queen bees were found homes elsewhere in NSW. \u201cIt only applies to queen breeders, of which there are very few in the red [eradication] zone, so that\u2019s a beekeeper that produces queen bees for sale. In Australia there\u2019s a very small queen breeding sector,\u201d Frost said. The varroa mite was first detected near the port of Newcastle in June and an emergency order was introduced in NSW to try to prevent the spread of the deadly mite. Frost said the honeybee genetics project which has been running since February 2020 will continue but given the hives at Tocal contained the largest bee population and the reference group, the project has been \u201csignificantly impacted.\u201d \u201cWhilst this is a disappointing setback, the program will continue and the genetic and production data we have generated so far lives on,\u201d she said. She said it\u2019s now more important than ever for bee breeders to support the national genetics program by collecting data on their own genetic lines and submitting that data to the Plan Bee project. \u201cThe real strength of this national program comes from the diversity and volume of data we generate.\u201d  Updated at 8.13am BST    7.51am    Rolling coverage of Queen\u2019s funeral begins We\u2019ve now entered the phase of TV channels beginning their coverage of Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s funeral. The actual funeral doesn\u2019t begin until 8pm tonight. You can read more about how that will all work below.   Updated at 7.56am BST    7.43am   NSW to end mask mandate on public transport  NSW has followed South Australia in ending the requirement for people to wear masks on public transport from Wednesday 21 September. That will include all public transport, taxis and ride share. NSW health recommends people wear masks where they can\u2019t physically distance or in settings where there are vulnerable people and those who are at high risk of severe illness. NSW Health continues to recommend that people wear masks where they cannot physically distance from others, and in settings where there are vulnerable people and those who are at high risk of severe illness. The health minister, Brad Hazzard, said:  Continuing to wear a mask in crowded areas will be particularly important for people who have underlying health conditions or who are vulnerable to Covid-19 infection for other reasons. Wearing a mask in these settings will not only protect those around you, but will also reduce your risk of infection. We can all continue to help protect each other, but particularly those most vulnerable to Covid-19 infection, by staying at home when feeling unwell, taking a Covid-19 test straight away and self-isolating.    Updated at 7.51am BST    7.31am   Union bid to turn off NSW ticket card readers may proceed  More on that last post, via AAP: A rail union plan to deactivate the NSW transport network\u2019s Opal card readers could still go ahead despite government claims the plot to switch off the ticket scanners could be illegal. The union is now confident it will prevail and have the readers switched off as part of its industrial campaign, calling the government\u2019s tactics \u201cdesperate\u201d. The union withdrew its initial application to shutdown the readers, after the government appeared to identify a fault in its filing. \u201cWe went through a fairly severe process to make sure that it was legal and above board,\u201d RTBU secretary Alex Claassens told media on Monday. \u201cHowever, the government of course, in its midnight application, identified that there may have been a particular issue with a process. \u201cSo it was a matter of ticking boxes in a particular format.\u201d A new application to switch off the readers was filed on Monday morning, which the union is confident will stand up, Claassens said. \u201cIt was just a last-minute desperate bid to try and stop us from locking those gates open and allowing the commuters of NSW to travel for free,\u201d Claassens added. A decision over whether the Opal scanners can be shut down will be made during a hearing in the Fair Work Commission (FWC) in the next 48 hours. If the commission accepts the actions, the readers will be switched off 10 days later.   Updated at 7.40am BST    7.17am    Reports NSW train union in bid to shut off ticket machines Radio station 2GB is reporting that the rail union has made an updated application to the Fair Work Commission to shut off Opal machines as part of the ongoing industrial action over the pay dispute in NSW.   Updated at 7.18am BST    7.12am    Fatal plane crash in Queensland Queensland police say the forensic crash unit is investigating a fatal plane crash at Canaga. An agricultural aircraft lost altitude while crop dusting near Chinchilla Wondai Road and crash landed in a paddock, the police said:  The pilot, believed to be a man in his 30s, was the sole occupant of the aircraft and passed away at the scene. A crime scene has been established. The forensic crash unit, working alongside the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), will prepare a report for the coroner.

Updated at 6.54am BST    6.38am    Not going to get any warmer for quite a few of us this week.      6.27am   Australia condemns cyber attacks against Albania  The foreign affairs department has released a statement condemning the cyber attacks directed at Albania at the moment. The statement says:  Australia condemns the recent cyber attacks on critical infrastructure in Albania. Australia is committed to upholding the rules-based order online, just as we do offline. We call on all countries to act in a responsible manner in cyberspace in order to build trust and cooperation, in pursuit of our mutual interest in a peaceful and stable online environment.  The attacks on government agencies have been attributed to Iran by the Albanian government, a claim Iran denies.  Updated at 6.30am BST    6.21am    Moderate flood warning issued for Lodden River in Victoria   Updated at 6.28am BST    6.11am    Banks to close for Thursday public holiday Australian bank branches will be shut on Thursday due to the national day of mourning for Queen Elizabeth II. The day is a public holiday across the country \u2013 in Victoria, it kicks off a four-day weekend as the following day is also a public holiday to celebrate the AFL grand final on Saturday. \u201cFor banks with branches and other financial institutions, Thursday will be a \u2018bank close day\u2019 with branches closed,\u201d the Australian Banking Association said in a statement. \u201cAs a result, there will be delays to some payments, as is the case with other public holidays. \u201cBanks will still be contactable, albeit in a reduced capacity, and customers are encouraged to contact their individual bank for further information.\u201d The ASX will also be closed on Thursday.  Updated at 6.14am BST    6.01am    Daniel Andrews defends plan to change name of Maroondah hospital Victoria\u2019s First Peoples\u2019 Assembly has accused the Andrews government of making a hospital in Melbourne\u2019s east \u201cculturally unsafe\u201d for Indigenous Australians after it vowed to rename the site in honour of Queen Elizabeth II, dumping its Indigenous name.   Updated at 6.03am BST    5.48am    Redmayne wiggles into World Cup warm-ups Australian goalkeeper Andrew Redmayne is taking Peru\u2019s creative response to his trademark World Cup qualifying heroics in his stride, AAP reports. The Socceroos goalkeeper broke the hearts of the South American nation in June. Substituted on for a penalty shootout, his eye-catching dancing movements on the line and some cunning gamesmanship in between shots helped Australia to an upset victory that sealed passage to Qatar later this year. Redmayne, who wore a grey jersey that night in Qatar, was officially inducted as the Grey Wiggle after appearing alongside the entertainers last week in a TV episode he says has since been playing non-stop for his child and wife at home.  And it\u2019s been more surreal for the Sydney FC keeper watching the reaction in Peru, where circus performers and even a rodeo clown in a bull ring have donned his grey attire. In Brisbane today, ahead of a World Cup warm-up game against New Zealand on Thursday, Redmayne said:  They\u2019ve been quite inventive. I don\u2019t know how they\u2019ve taken it, kind of tongue in cheek and good fun but [Peru] is well and truly off the bucket list I think. [I take it] in my stride, enjoying it and it\u2019s sometimes a welcome distraction for football but anything to help the sport\u2019s profile in Australia.   Updated at 5.53am BST    5.41am    Thanks for your attention this Monday, I hope the start of the week has been kind to you. The inimitable Josh Taylor will now take you through the rest of today\u2019s news.     5.35am    Large water main ruptured in western Sydney      5.30am   SA to drop mask mandate for public transport tomorrow  South Australia will drop Covid-19 mask mandates for public transport after the latest advice from health officials, AAP reports. The new provisions will take effect from Tuesday, bringing SA into line with most other jurisdictions. The premier, Peter Malinauskas, said:  This is another step forward in terms of the management of the pandemic. We are very determined to relax restrictions as soon as it is safe to do so. We think this is another practical step going forward.  As of Friday, QR check-ins for disability, health and aged care settings will also be removed along with Covid-19 vaccine mandates for visitors to aged care centres. Mask mandates for aged care and other health settings, including pharmacies and hospitals, will remain. The changes come after SA recorded 3,631 new virus infections last week, in the first change from daily to weekly reporting. SA Health also reported 58 more deaths, taking the toll in the state since the start of the pandemic to 860.  Updated at 5.33am BST    5.24am    Missing pilot found dead in Victorian high country We brought you the news earlier that there was concern for a pilot of a recreational aircraft missing on a flight in north-east Victoria since Sunday. The plane has since been located, but the pilot was deceased. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) said:  At about 10am on Monday, after a search of the area involving multiple aircraft and ground crews, a Victorian police helicopter located the crash site about 30km east of Tallangatta in the north-east Victorian high country. Victoria police have confirmed the pilot of the aircraft was found deceased at the scene. AMSA acknowledge this is a difficult time for family and friends of the pilot and would like to thank all those who assisted with the search.    Updated at 5.26am BST    5.16am    New meningococcal case in South Australia A case of invasive meningococcal has been detected in a 21-year-old in Adelaide. It\u2019s the the 11th case of meningococcal reported in South Australia this year, compared with several reported the same time last year.   Updated at 5.19am BST    5.04am   Covid rules needed into 2023, health minister says  The health minister, Mark Butler, has confirmed some Covid measures will continue well into 2023, even as some in politics and the media pressure the federal government to drop pandemic rules. Butler was speaking in Adelaide to confirm $1.4bn in new Covid federal funding for rapid tests, aged care staffing and Medicare subsidies. Asked by a journalist at his press conference when he expected \u201cthe shackles will be lifted off\u201d (their words, not ours), Butler said it would be a while yet. The health minister said:  There will be a need to retain some measures over the course of 2023, I\u2019m very sure. And so over the course of the rest of this year, we will be considering the need for measures to be extended beyond the end of calendar 2022. And we\u2019ll have more to say about that later in the year.  Butler didn\u2019t say exactly which measures would remain through 2023, but confirmed that government backing for pathology and Covid testing would be one part of the continued response. The minister also spoke of his concern about long Covid, or serious chronic symptoms lingering months after infection. Butler said Australia needed to have \u201ca national focus on long Covid\u201d, saying there had been more than 200 different symptoms associated, and that more research and data was needed. Butler said:  We don\u2019t know yet really what the true prevalence and scale of long Covid is here ... But there\u2019s no question it is going to be a very substantial pressure on our community, on individuals and on our health system. Even health professionals are still coming to grips with the scale of this in terms of numbers, but also the diversity of symptoms that patients are presenting with.  Butler said the national strategy on long Covid would develop over the coming months.  Updated at 5.14am BST    4.53am   Rex Patrick takes information commissioner's office to court over FOI delays  Former senator Rex Patrick will use the federal court to demand Australia\u2019s information commissioner explain the lawfulness of her office\u2019s delays in reviewing freedom of information decisions. Patrick has taken the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) to the federal court over huge delays in its handling of FOI reviews, a crucial part of the overall FOI system. The former senator says some reviews are unresolved more than 1,000 days after referral to the OAIC, delays which he says are unreasonable. The hearing was due to take place next week. But at an interlocutory hearing on Monday morning, the case was delayed by more than a month. The hearing will now take place in November. The delay occurred after the OAIC\u2019s lawyers made a late application to amend its argument. Patrick\u2019s team will also be allowed to make additional arguments as part of its case.  Updated at 5.04am BST    4.45am    People with a disability more likely to be victims of crime in NSW People with a disability are twice as likely to be a victim of a violent crime in NSW, according to a data pilot which is the first of its kind in the state. They are also over-represented in parts of the justice system, being more likely to face drug and domestic violence offences, AAP reports. Data from the NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research (Boscar) released today shows 17% of people accessing core disability support had been victims of crime. Between 2014 and 2018, 6.5% of people claiming support experienced a violent incident and 4.4% experienced a domestic violence related crime. Indigenous women with a disability suffered even worse, with 18% experiencing a violent crime over that same five year period. People who commit violence against people with a disability were 17 % less likely to have criminal matters proceed against them. Police were less likely to take action if the victim had a cognitive and physical disability. People in NSW with a disability who experienced domestic violence-related crime were also more likely to experience it again within a year. Generally, people with a physical, cognitive and mental health disability were more likely to become victims of crime. BOSCAR\u2019s director, Dr Suzanne Poynton, said the data pilot was the first of its kind to offer insight into both the victimisation and offending among people with a disability in NSW. Poynton said:  Filling this significant knowledge gap is important for developing disability policy in the justice system.

She replaces Peter Botten effective today. While Vales Point goes through a dance of a thousand veils (see earlier post), AGL is enduring its own corporate twists. The largest electricity generator in Australia has had its share of management turmoil after billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes made a takeover bid for the company in February. Then he returned for a second tilt in May when his family firm Grok emerged as AGL\u2019s largest shareholder. That second effort managed to stymie AGL\u2019s plan to split into two (a \u201cbad AGL\u201d full of coal-fired power plants, and a \u201cgood\u201d one with a 4m-plus customer book of power and gas customers). Corporate heads rolled, as they say, leaving the company scrambling to settle on new leadership. McKenzie had been the chair-elect, and has held roles at Essential Energy, APA Group, Transgrid and the Australian Energy Market Operator, among others. An interesting appointment to AGL\u2019s board is Miles George. George was formerly head of renewable energy firm Infigen Energy. Managing director and chief executive officer Graeme Hunt will stay in his role until 30 September, with current chief financial officer Damien Nicks stepping up be the interim CEO. (The hunt, so to speak, for a new chief goes on.) We\u2019re hoping the Atlassian co-founder, Cannon-Brookes, will tell us what he thinks of AGL\u2019s changes. Investors, though, are not too chuffed. They\u2019ve sent AGL\u2019s 2.4% lower for the day compared with a roughly flat overall market.  Updated at 4.39am BST    4.30am    Flood threat reduced near Bright The Victorian SES says:  This is a final flood watch for 15 Mile Creek, Buckland River and Ovens River to Bright. Minor flood warnings are current for following catchments: Seven and Castle Creeks, Ovens, Kiewa, and Goulburn rivers.  The threat of flooding is reduced. You can now return to normal activity, but be aware of any hazards that may still exist in the warning area.    Updated at 4.33am BST    4.25am    Bulldog Josh Dunkley keen to join Brisbane Lions Star Western Bulldogs midfielder Josh Dunkley is set to walk out on the club to link up with Brisbane, AAP reports. Dunkley\u2019s future has been up in the air since the Bulldogs crashed out to Fremantle in the first week of the AFL finals. The 25-year-old\u2019s bid to join Essendon last year fell through, but he is now out of contract and keen to join the Lions for what\u2019s reported to be a six-year deal. It\u2019s believed the Bulldogs had offered Dunkley a five-year extension in a bid to keep him.  Port Adelaide were also in the hunt to secure Dunkley\u2019s services. Dunkley\u2019s partner, Tippah Dwan, plays professional netball for the Adelaide Thunderbirds in what loomed as a potential advantage for the Power. Brisbane will now need to weave some magic on the trade front in order to satisfy the Bulldogs. Complicating matters is the fact Brisbane are committed to taking star father-son prospect Will Ashcroft. Ashcroft, son of three-time Brisbane premiership player Marcus Ashcroft, is regarded as the standout player in this year\u2019s trade pool, meaning the Lions are highly likely to need to match a bid at No 1. It means the Lions, who currently hold pick No 15, might need to offer future draft picks to snare Dunkley, or go into a significant draft points deficit. Dunkley averaged 25.4 possessions and 4.4 clearances a game this season, and his arrival at Brisbane will add further potency to a midfield already featuring Brownlow medallist Lachie Neale, Jarrod Berry and Zac Bailey.  Updated at 4.30am BST    4.09am    Fire in Port Kembla bush Fire Rescue NSW are working to extinguish a fire in an area of bush within the city.      3.57am    Car swallowed by sinkhole in Perth suburb A luxury car has become submerged in a sinkhole after a water pipe burst and flooded a street in the affluent Perth suburb of Subiaco, AAP reports. The Mercedes-Benz was parked near a water main in the inner Perth suburb, when it burst just before 10pm on Sunday. It became almost completely immersed in the water, along with a nearby park bench. A Water Corporation spokeswoman said no one was injured in the incident. Emergency crews attended the scene and repair works were conducted throughout the night. About 60 homes and businesses were without water early on Monday but that number had fallen to three by mid-morning as works continued. The spokeswoman said:  Traffic management is on site and road diversions are in place. Motorists are asked to please show caution in the area. The cause of the burst (pipe) is being investigated. We sincerely apologise to those affected.   Updated at 3.58am BST    3.31am         3.24am    An update on the trains dispute in NSW From AAP: The rail union and NSW government are returning to the industrial umpire in a bid to break their long-running stalemate over the safety of a new intercity train fleet and wages and conditions for workers. The Rail, Tram and Bus Union (RTBU) will meet with the government at the Fair Work Commission (FWC) on Monday for a second day of conciliation talks. The talks come after the union on the weekend dropped plans to shut down Opal Card readers this week, following a government threat to launch court action over it. \u201cThere won\u2019t be anything this week,\u201d a union spokeswoman told AAP. The RTBU had planned to leave station gates open as it did last month, but to also deactivate Opal Card readers, preventing commuters tapping on to pay for trips. The measure reportedly could have cost the government more than $1 million a day. As part of its campaign, the union recently took Sydney Trains and NSW TrainLink to the FWC in a bid to keep negotiating a new enterprise agreement and changes to Korean-built trains that have been mothballed for years, with the union saying they are not safe to operate. Premier Dominic Perrottet declared negotiations were over at the end of August and threatened to terminate the enterprise agreement if there was further industrial action, after weeks of union disruptions to train services. RTBU NSW secretary Alex Claassens has said the union is doing everything it can to reach a speedy resolution but says the government \u201cis stalling the process at every opportunity\u201d. Transport minister David Elliott has been contacted for comment.  Updated at 3.31am BST    3.07am    Pricier properties predicted to fall more in relative terms: RBA As in our earlier posts, the RBA\u2019s head of domestic markets, Jonathan Kearns, has been commenting on how higher interest rates will affect property markets. Among the comments from Kearns was the prediction that more pricey properties will fall more in relative terms than other segments of the market. Here is the article too:  CoreLogic\u2019s research director Tim Lawless has confirmed that the data for most cities so far backs up Kearns\u2019s view. The upper 25% of the market showed prices across the combined capitals peaked in January and values had fallen 7.4%.  Lawless says:  In contrast, the lower quartile of the market peaked much later, in July, and housing values are down a much smaller 0.2% by the end of August.  For Sydney, where prices had started to turn lower before other capitals, housing values were down 7.5% across the upper 25% over the past three months, while the lower quartile was down 2.8%. Mind you, the top end of the market has further to fall. From the trough in prices during the Covid pandemic to the recent peak, dwelling values across Sydney\u2019s upper quartile had surged by 33.9% compared with a 17.5% rise in the lower 25% of the market. CoreLogic\u2019s data also showed house prices across the capital cities had risen just shy of 30% from the trough to the peak, compared with unit values\u2019 13.2% increase.  Updated at 3.13am BST    2.55am   Australia signs economic pledge with Indonesia  Australia and Indonesia have pledged to increase economic cooperation ahead of a G20 finance ministers meeting, AAP reports. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, met with the Indonesian finance minister, Mulyani Indrawati, in Canberra on Monday to sign the memorandum of understanding. The agreement will facilitate the exchange of departmental officials from both nations, with dialogue and cooperation to focus on areas such as tax policy and financial regulation.  Clean energy, climate financing and pension systems were also on the agenda. Chalmers said in his opening remarks:  That\u2019s why we deepen and renew the MoU today, so we can continue sharing policy experiences in key reform areas and build capacity in both our departments.  Chalmers also flagged facilitating further investment from Australia\u2019s $3.4tn superannuation pool into Indonesia. G20 finance ministers are due to meet in Washington DC in October.

The formerly state-owned coal-fired power plant near Lake Macquarie in the NSW Hunter Valley region, has been sold by its Australian owners Delta Electricity to what it calls \u201ca family office investment group from the Czech Republic\u201d, Sev.en Global Investments. No price was given, but News Corp is reporting the sale was worth more than $200m. Not for a 1,320-megawatt clunker that was offloaded by the NSW government for just $1m in 2015? Add in the $130m-odd in dividends to Delta\u2019s owners, Trevor St Baker and Brian Flannery, since then. And unlike other plants sold off, such as AGL\u2019s Liddell and Bayswater, Delta didn\u2019t have to pick up the rehabilitation costs of Vales, Renew Economy has reported. It\u2019s also reported this morning that Sev.en plans to extend the life of the plant beyond its touted closure date of 2029. That, among other things, would likely increase the rehab costs for the ash ponds and other nasties that result from burning fossil fuels. We\u2019ve asked the NSW government and also Delta about those plans. In the meantime, Tim Buckley, a seasoned energy analyst and now director of Climate Energy Finance, said the plant\u2019s sale to Sev.en, owned by Czech billionaire Pavel Tyka\u010d, is \u201cthe worst of all outcomes\u201d. \u201cThere is absolutely no accountability\u201d for the new owners, Buckley says.  Who\u2019s actually going to hold them to account? We\u2019ve been fleeced twice. First, with the $1m sales and secondly on the clean-up costs.  He noted the Foreign Investment Review Board would have to clear the sale but given the group has secured other generation assets in Australia, namely half of InterGen in 2019, there may not be much of a hurdle to clear. Buckley said the NSW government could intervene and use its powers to limit pollution to put a stopper to Vales Point\u2019s extension. (New clout sought by the NSW Environment Protection Authority could help that, as we reported here.) For its part, Sev.en suggests it\u2019s in the market for more of these ageing coal-fired power plants. It says on its website:  We are convinced that the combination of our firm rooting in the world of traditional energy, together with a deep expertise and willingness to share our knowhow, could bring big advantages to energy markets in transition. We understand our role in an energy market as a bridge between the energy of today and tomorrow.   Updated at 3.52am BST    2.18am    More on Origin Energy decision to quit Beetaloo Basin gas project We brought you the news earlier about Origin Energy quitting the Beetaloo Basin gas project. My colleague Ben Butler has the full story:  Origin Energy will sell its stake in its Beetaloo Basin gas project at a loss and review all its other exploration permits in a move that will distance it from an environmental controversy and end its association with sanctioned Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg. Chief executive Frank Calabria said gas remained \u201ca core part of our business\u201d but getting out of gas exploration would free up money to \u201cgrow cleaner energy and customer solutions, and deliver reliable energy through the transition\u201d.

Updated at 2.10am BST    1.56am    Fines for Victorian public transport mask dodgers More than 100 fines have been issued on Victorian public transport and in excess of 181,000 warnings given as part of a Covid-19 mask compliance crackdown so far this September, AAP reports. Under Victoria\u2019s pandemic orders, public transport passengers must wear a fitted face mask covering their nose and mouth unless they have a valid exemption. The fine for failing or refusing to wear a fitted mask on public transport is $100 for an adult. A government spokesperson said:  Our focus remains on educating Victorians rather than handing out fines, which is why we\u2019ve given out almost 160,000 masks to passengers on public transport. With an increase in cases over the winter period, public transport operators are continuing to ensure mask compliance and additional masks have been made available to customers travelling on our public transport network.  Recorded announcements reminding passengers to use a mask have been in place since December 2020. It is still mandatory to wear a face mask on public transport in NSW, Queensland, Western Australia, the ACT and South Australia. On Sunday, Victoria\u2019s chief health officer Brett Sutton said while Covid-19 cases and hospital admissions had dropped, people should remain vigilant. In a series of tweets, Sutton said new variants were causing concern in immunological circles because of immunity evasion and there may be another peak closer to the end of the year.  National cabinet recently agreed to scrap mask mandates for domestic flights amid falling Covid-19 case numbers. The Victorian government also lifted its work-from-home recommendation at the end of winter, with health minister Mary-Anne Thomas citing improving case numbers.

Updated at 1.44am BST    1.32am    Liz Truss could soon visit Australia, Albanese says Prime minister Anthony Albanese has flagged his British counterpart Liz Truss could soon visit Australia, and remarked that the new King Charles was \u201cless tired\u201d than he expected him to be. Albanese is in London for Queen Elizabeth\u2019s funeral, which will be held tonight (Australia time). Speaking to ABC Melbourne radio this morning, the Australian PM reflected warmly on his first meeting with Truss over the weekend. He said:  It was a good gathering. I visited her in what is the foreign secretary\u2019s residence down in Kent. And we had a good discussion about the range of issues and about the relationship that we have between Australia and the UK. Of course, we\u2019ve come to an economic and trade agreement that is due to go through our parliaments, we had a discussion as well about the potential visit by Prime Minister Truss to Australia.  Albanese also met Charles for the first time as King. He said he found the new monarch to be \u201cless tired than is reasonable to have expected frankly, given the extraordinary schedule\u201d.  And what must be, of course, a very emotional time for him as well as physically tiring. But he was very focused. And it was a very positive meeting. And it was a great honour to have the first face to face meeting with King Charles.  Albanese, an avowed supporter of an Australian republic, has kept quiet about his political views in that sphere since the Queen\u2019s death, saying it was not the time for such conversations. But the PM did recount what he said was a \u201cfamous story\u201d in his family, of his mother \u2013 while pregnant and about to deliver the baby Albanese \u2013 wanting to see Queen Elizabeth on her 1963 visit to Australia.  My mother was a republican, but also liked the Queen. I think you can have different views but have respect for Queen Elizabeth and the role that she had. When I was about to be born, my mother in 1963, the royal visit, my mother insisted on the way to the hospital to give birth to me, going via the city, George Street, to see all the festival paraphernalia. Well apparently my family used to tell that story about my mother insisting that while she was in labour on the way to the hospital. And that\u2019s a story that is fairly famous in my family, so my mother did have regard for Queen Elizabeth. I think the fact that Queen Elizabeth was such a strong woman was a role model as well for so many people.   Updated at 1.39am BST    1.26am   Andrews defends renaming of Maroondah hospital to honour Queen  The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has defended the renaming of the Maroondah hospital to honour the Queen following opposition from Indigenous groups and leaders about the scrapping of the Aboriginal language name. In a pre-election pledge, the Andrews government on Sunday vowed to rebuild the hospital in Melbourne\u2019s east at a cost of more than $1bn and rename it to pay tribute to the Queen. But the renaming has sparked backlash from some Indigenous groups and leaders.  Speaking to reporters on Monday, Andrews said the entire council area used the Aboriginal name \u201cMaroondah\u201d:  I think it\u2019s a fitting tribute to someone, in Queen Elizabeth II, who was a great supporter of our health system and a great supporter of healthcare.  The announcement came after Victoria\u2019s opposition promised a $400m upgrade to Maroondah hospital if it won the election in November.Andrews and deputy premier Jacinta Allan on Monday announced that the state government would remove eight additional level crossings in the marginal electorate of Brunswick in a bid to ease traffic congestion and improve road safety. The inner-city electorate is currently held by the Greens on a 2% margin, following the redistribution of electorate boundaries.

Larissa Waters, the Greens leader in the Senate and spokesperson on women, said that fairer paid parental leave is a \u201cno brainer\u201d and that the government could afford it if they scrapped the controversial stage three tax cuts.  Australia has one of the weakest parental leave schemes in the developed world, especially for fathers. There was unanimous support from the jobs and skills summit participants for that to change.If the government is serious about increasing women\u2019s workforce participation, it needs to do more than to nod sagely while a panel of expert women says these things. Labor needs to actually act.  Barbara Pocock, the Greens spokesperson on employment, said:  As chair of the parliament\u2019s first Senate select committee on Work and Care I know that the evidence on paid parental leave is overwhelming: we need it, and we need more of it. As an economist I know that without kids - and the care put into raising them - there is no economy. It is that simple. Having children is hard labour and it should be recognised with decent recovery time and paid leave. It has been known for more than a century that economies benefiting from women\u2019s work should ensure recovery and bonding time when they have a baby.   Updated at 1.17am BST    12.54am   Origin to divest 100% of its interest in Beetaloo Basin  The company has also announced it intends to exit upstream exploration. As my colleague, Adam Morton, Guardian Australia\u2019s environment editor, put it \u2013 it\u2019s a big deal. More to come shortly.      12.40am   About 20 flood rescues across New England in NSW, including horses  Rankine provided details about the SES flood rescues that have occurred over the weekend in the state\u2019s north-east:  We did quite a large number of flood rescues right across the New England over the weekend, probably in the vicinity of 20 flood rescues \u2013 people making that decision to drive around flood water and around closed road signs. That was a bit disappointing from an organisational perspective, people not being responsible behind the wheel. That takes a lot of the effort away from our volunteers to help community members when we\u2019re fishing people out of their cars.  He said agricultural areas between Gunnedah and Narrabri have been affected, which has meant farmers have had to move livestock and equipment to higher ground.  There\u2019s a lot of water in the river. Obviously the catchment is really saturated. There wouldn\u2019t be an empty dam anywhere in that vicinity for our farmers but what that means is a lot of farmers have been moving livestock to higher ground. We did have a couple of horse rescues over the weekend as well where people\u2019s livestock got surrounded in and around the New England communities. We have asked a lot of those farmers to lift their pumps and those sort of infrastructure that exist on those rivers and move their livestock to higher ground to ensure they\u2019re safe. And to make sure that there\u2019s no stock and equipment losses for those farmers.   Updated at 12.46am BST    12.33am    Flood waters receding in north-eastern NSW The Namoi River is in flood, which has affected many towns in north-eastern NSW over the weekend, particularly Gunnedah, and now as the water travels further downstream there were fears Wee Waa could be cut off. The public information manager at the NSW SES, David Rankine, spoke to ABC this morning. Rankine said although the water in Gunnedah is receding, at least four homes in the low-lying areas of the town have been inundated.  It\u2019s now sitting right at the minor flood level, just at 7.3 metres. It\u2019s receded really well and is moving its way down the Namoi River system through Narrabri. Thankfully Wee Waa seems to have almost peaked as well. It peaked yesterday afternoon at 6.85 metres which is in the major flood level but now receded to about 6.77. So we were concerned for a moment that Wee Waa may become isolated with all the flood water. There was access during that and with the water now receding thankfully the community of Wee Waa, which is protected by quite a substantial levee, won\u2019t be isolated for any particular period this week which is really good news for that community.  Rankine confirmed there was no water expected through homes in Wee Waa, due to the protection from the levee but that farming properties which will be isolated.

Updated at 12.21am BST    12.03am   Albanese says he\u2019s \u2018very comfortable\u2019 with King Charles expressing views on climate crisis  The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, was interviewed by the BBC\u2019s James Naughtie after his meeting with King Charles III. Asked to describe what the conversation was like and how it went, Albanese said \u201cit was very warm and friendly\u201d. As for the possibility King Charles visiting Australia early in his reign, Albanese said \u201che would be very welcome\u201d. \u201cThere will be a standing invitation for him, as there is for other members of the royal family.\u201d Naughtie also asked Albanese about the King\u2019s position in relation to climate change:  Now, the King is now out of the political arena in the sense that he has to tread carefully on political issues that are matter for government. But everyone knows his commitment on these questions. No doubt you would hope that that is a conversation despite his accession to the throne that can go on.  Albanese:  I think that is a matter, of course, for King Charles, what he comments on. And it\u2019s important that the sovereign stay distant from party political issues. But from my perspective, what I\u2019ve said, is that I\u2019d be very comfortable with the King expressing views about the importance of climate change, and it is about the very survival of our way of life. We know that in Australia the impacts of bushfires, floods, natural disasters, are doing exactly what the science told us would happen \u2013 which is that there have always been natural disasters in Australia, but they\u2019re more frequent and they\u2019re more intense, and that\u2019s why this issue shouldn\u2019t be a partisan political issue. It should be an issue which the world needs to confront.    Updated at 12.57am BST    11.57pm   Victorian dining and entertainment program returns  The Victorian government is bringing back its dining and entertainment program today, which allows customers to claim 25% cash back at businesses within the state. The program will cover purchases of over $40 at restaurants and cafes, live music venues, museums and cinemas. The first round was launched in March this year and saw $32m claimed within three months. Dumpling Alley was amongst the most popular dining venues, while Harry Potter and the Cursed Child was one of the most popular entertainment choices in the previous round, according to the government.  The $25m program runs until 16 December 2022 or when funds are exhausted. The minister for sport, tourism and major events, Steve Dimopoulos, said:  With a blockbuster summer of major events upon us, we\u2019re providing Victorians even more reasons to get out and enjoy everything the state has to offer \u2013 while saving money and supporting local businesses.   Updated at 12.03am BST    11.47pm    Where supply of housing is less flexible, mortgage debt is higher: RBA The RBA\u2019s Kearns, though, says that the higher interest rates will have varying effects on property prices (even if the precise impacts are uncertain). He notes research by the RBA found that, all else being equal, interest rates can have larger effects on housing prices \u201cin locations where the supply of housing is less flexible, mortgage debt is higher, there are more investors and incomes are higher\u201d. Back in April, we looked some of the areas where mortgage stress might be highest, and researchers pointed to outer suburban areas in particular:  When it comes to property prices themselves, the greater sensitivity is likely to be in the \u201cmost expensive areas\u201d. Data showed prices in pricier suburbs are \u201cmore cyclical\u201d than the average, Kearns said.  Kearns added that evidence also exists to show houses are more sensitive to changes in interest rates than apartments. The limited supply of available zoned land partly explains this result, he said. \u201cOverall this indicates that an increase in interest rates narrows the distribution of housing wealth since more expensive properties experience a larger fall in prices,\u201d he said, but adds the distributional effects are temporary and disappear over time. Commercial property tends to be less affected than residential property to higher rates, Kearns said, although the unrelated working-from-home impacts might provide other headwinds for that sector.

If you\u2019re wondering why there seem to be so many problems across the aviation industry as it recovers from the pandemic, and when travel will get back to normal, yours truly looked at the issue in an article this weekend:   Updated at 11.44pm BST    11.35pm    Borrowing costs just one of the factors affecting property prices A couple of other takeaways from the speech by RBA\u2019s Jonathan Kearns about the links between higher interest rates and property prices. The uncertainty of those links can be seen in this chart from Kearns that underscores how volatile real estate prices are, not least because borrowing costs are just one of the factors affecting property (but arguably the biggest one):  As Kearns notes, interest rates affect all asset prices, including housing prices, because those assets are valued for what they provide us in the future. \u201cAn increase in interest rates means that a given amount of income (or benefit) at a future date is worth less today, and so an asset with a fixed future stream of payments will be worth less today,\u201d Kearns said, noting that future cash flows may also change with interest rates, amplifying or moderating the impact on prices. As rates rise, the ability of people to borrow (and that\u2019s what most of us do when buying property unless you have suitcases of cash under the bed), falls quite rapidly, as this chart shows:   Updated at 11.38pm BST    11.27pm   Motorcyclist dies after hitting cow in NSW  A motorcycle rider has died after hitting a cow on the New South Wales mid-north coast yesterday.

NSW police said in a statement:  Witnesses rendered first aid to the rider \u2013 a 64-year-old man \u2013 before the arrival of NSW Ambulance paramedics; however, he died while being taken to Macksville Hospital. Officers from Mid North Coast Police District established a crime scene and commenced inquiries into the circumstances surrounding the crash. A report will be prepared for the information of the Coroner.

Last week the union announced their plans to shut down the Opal card system indefinitely as part of their ongoing dispute with the state government. In a series of tweets by the union, they said that plan has now been cancelled, wider industrial action will still be continuing.   Updated at 11.25pm BST    11.13pm    RBA economist says there is \u2018considerable uncertainty\u2019 about where property prices are heading In a week that is likely to be marked by another week of overseas interest rate rises by central banks, Jonathan Kearns, head of domestic markets for the RBA, has chimed in about the connections between higher borrowing costs and property prices. Those hoping for some definitive comments about how much rates might rise and how deep the dive in real estate prices will be, take a breath. Kearns makes some interesting comments but doesn\u2019t reveal much about what\u2019s coming as far as higher rates. Nor does he go as far as his boss, RBA governor Philip Lowe, who last week noted he expected property prices to fall as much as 10%, as we reported. Rather, there are these sorts of comments from Kearns:  [W]e know that higher interest rates will tend to depress residential and commercial property prices but there is considerable uncertainty about the magnitude and even the timing. Not only can declining property prices have implications for economic activity, but also for financial stability as we outlined in the April financial stability review. As we noted, those financial stability risks appear to be contained given the low leverage for residential and commercial property. But we will continue to carefully monitor the evolution of these risks.  Anyway, financial markets reckon there\u2019s a 74% chance the RBA will lift the cash rate another 50 basis points at its board meeting on 4 October. That would take it to 2.85%, with another 100bp or more to come before it peaks.  Commercial bank economists are more sanguine, expecting a peak at about 3.35%, or lower.   Updated at 11.31pm BST    11.05pm    Stan Grant\u2019s weekend piece \u2018compelling and devastating\u2019: Andrew Bragg Liberal senator Andrew Bragg followed Khalil on ABC radio, discussing the news we brought you a little earlier that he is proposing a private member\u2019s bill to tighten regulation on cryptocurrency. At the end of the interview Bragg brought up Stan Grant\u2019s analysis: \u201cAfter Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s death, Indigenous Australia can\u2019t be expected to shut up. Our sorry business is without end.\u201d Bragg called Grant\u2019s piece \u201ccompelling and devastating\u201d and said the issues raised by Indigenous Australians shouldn\u2019t be swept under carpet.  Updated at 11.22pm BST    10.58pm    \u2018It is significant\u2019: Khalil on Indian and Chinese concerns about Russia Indian prime minister Narendra Modi and Chinese president Xi Jinping raised concerns about Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine over the weekend.  Asked about the significance of this development, Khalil said \u201csignificant is probably an understatement.\u201d  It is significant. The question in my mind is if chairman Xi is really having those concerns because Russia is failing so badly. From the perspective of India it\u2019s significant, because India has a long standing relationship with Russia \u2013 it goes back historically. I think significant is probably an understatement in terms of the concerns you\u2019re seeing from those big major powers.    Updated at 11.18pm BST    10.52pm    Khalil says Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China meeting focused on defending democracy ABC radio asks Khalil about his recent trip to Washington DC for a meeting of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China.  The focus was on particularly how we develop policy around China. It\u2019s about the commitment we have as democracies to the rule of law. As lawmakers we have a lot of challenges, not just from state actors like China and Russia but also non-state actors, in defending democracy in a period of time when there\u2019s a lot of disinformation.   Updated at 11.13pm BST    10.47pm    New intelligence committee chair says priority is \u2018the best national security laws\u2019 Labor MP Peter Khalil has been appointed the new chair of the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security, and is speaking to ABC Radio about the appointment. RN Breakfast host Patricia Karvelas asks Khalil about what he wants to achieve as chair of \u201cone of the most powerful Committees in the Parliament\u201d. Khalil says he has two principle objectives:  There are two objectives really of this committee. The first is that we pass as a parliament \u2013 the best national security laws. Secondly, it is a critically important committee as you said we are charged with the responsibility of reviewing and oversight of all our national security laws \u2026 and also an assessment around intelligence and security agencies.    Updated at 11.10pm BST    10.43pm    Western NSW town to be cut off by flood waters, as warnings also issued for Victoria The town of Wee Waa in north western NSW is preparing to be isolated for up to a week after flood levels reached 6.7 metres over the weekend. Several roads in the region have been closed, with major flooding along the Namoi River at Gunnedah being closely monitored. State Emergency Service spokesperson David Rankine told the ABC that local units have been preparing for roads into the town to be cut from tomorrow. He said:  Wee Waa could be cut off for a few days from tomorrow into Tuesday.  More flood warnings have also come through overnight for the King River in Victoria:   Updated at 11.04pm BST    10.39pm   Liberal senator pushes for cryptocurrency crackdown  The Liberal senator Andrew Bragg has proposed a private member\u2019s bill to tighten regulation on cryptocurrency, to address what he calls a \u201cWild West situation\u201d created by current laws. Bragg, a senator for NSW, is pushing for a new system for licensing digital asset exchanges, including rules mandating that cryptocurrency companies keep currency in reserve in an Australian bank in a bid to give consumers more protection in the case of the collapse of an exchange. He said there were both \u201crisks and opportunities\u201d for Australia in further embracing digital assets, and has long advocated for new rules to support the country becoming a leader in crypto. In a speech to a blockchain forum on Monday, Bragg noted the \u201cendless advertising of crypto throughout the football finals\u201d and called for the government to take action. Bragg was chair of a Senate committee that investigated cryptocurrency issues last year, and said the former Coalition government had been committed to implementing proposals to further regulate the market. His proposal, the digital assets (market regulation) bill 2022, would create licensing schemes for digital asset exchanges, digital asset custodians and stablecoin issuers.  The licensees would be subject to minimum capital requirements, conduct regulation and governance, requirements to segregate consumer funds from corporate funds in the event of an exchange declaring bankruptcy, cyber security standards, disclosure requirements to government agencies, and requirements for key personnel to be based in Australia. Bragg said:  Waiting is not an option and Australian consumers are exposed to an unregulated market as we speak. At the moment Australians face a gaping hole in that investment in a financial product is protected by regulation whereas a similar looking crypto product is not.  Bragg was critical of the Labor government for announcing further reviews into cryptocurrency, instead of taking swifter action. He said:  The consequence of Labor\u2019s inaction is clear. Australia is falling behind on consumer protection and investment promotion.   Updated at 10.51pm BST    10.39pm   Covid response to be boosted with extra $1.4bn  The federal government is pouring in another $1.4bn to Australia\u2019s Covid response, with $840m going to aged care alone. The major pandemic announcement will be confirmed on Monday morning by the health minister Mark Butler, at a press conference in Adelaide. Numerous measures in the federal Covid response were due to run out by 30 September, but Monday\u2019s announcement extends several key programs. The aged care support program \u2013 which funds extra cleaning, staff wages and training, waste removal and infection control measures \u2013 will get $840m. Of that, $35m will extend ongoing on\u2011site PCR testing. The latest federal Covid snapshot for aged care, as of 14 September, reported 40 resident deaths and 1,580 combined new resident and staff cases in the prior seven days. There were 270 facilities with an active outbreak at that date, down 70 from the previous week. Active aged care outbreaks have been trending down steadily since a peak in late July, and are now at the lowest level since January.  Butler\u2019s announcement will also include $235m for PPE, treatments and rapid tests for aged care, disability care, frontline workers and First Nations health services; $115m for rapid antigen tests to high-risk settings including aged care; $142m in Medicare Benefits Scheme items for Covid tests and anti-viral prescriptions; $48m to extend 100 respiratory clinics; and funding for communication campaigns around Covid. Last week, national cabinet agreed to extend the pandemic leave disaster payment for workers who had to isolate but didn\u2019t have sick pay. Butler said the federal government would \u201ccontinue to review the Covid-19 response measures, according to expert advice, as it develops a long-term strategy for managing the pandemic\u201d. Butler said:  This action will provide Australians with effective testing, medical care and treatments to protect themselves and those most vulnerable in the community.   Updated at 11.02pm BST    10.39pm   Good morning!  In London, the prime minister Anthony Albanese has attended a reception for world leaders hosted by King Charles III at Buckingham Palace, ahead of Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s funeral. Albanese has also met with his counterparts from the 14 Commonwealth realms, including Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau yesterday. The health minister, Mark Butler, will today announce the government is allocating another $1.4bn to the nation\u2019s Covid-19 response, with $840m going to aged care alone. Many measures in the federal Covid response were due to run out by September 30, but today\u2019s announcement will extend several key programs. The government is consulting on new laws to boost work security, including minimum wages and other entitlements for gig workers, in what the ABC is reporting as an \u201cUberisation\u201d overhaul. The Liberal senator Andrew Bragg has proposed a private member\u2019s bill to tighten regulation on cryptocurrency, to address what he calls a \u201cWild West situation\u201d created by current laws.

                    "body": "Uefa has defended the decision of its two most senior executives to leave Paris early the day after the Champions League final descended into horror and chaos, to watch the Championship playoff final at Wembley.\nTheodore Theodoridis, Uefa\u2019s general secretary \u2013 the equivalent of chief executive \u2013 and his deputy, Giorgio Marchetti, were guests of the EFL at the final between Nottingham Forest and Huddersfield. Theodoridis and Marchetti were in the dignitaries\u2019 seats at Wembley, after the scenes in Paris where thousands of supporters were held in distressingly long queues and many were teargassed by French police and violently attacked by local thugs around the Stade de France.\n\nBy Monday 30 May, two days later, Uefa announced it had set up an \u201cindependent review\u201d into the Paris failures, and selected a Portuguese MP, Dr Tiago Brand\u00e3o Rodrigues, to lead it. Liverpool and their supporters questioned the credibility and independence of the review and of Rodrigues, and the rigour of Uefa\u2019s processes, and the realisation that Uefa\u2019s two most senior administrators were at Wembley through the Sunday afternoon has increased resistance to it. Uefa has insisted that Theodoridis was able to devote himself fully to Uefa\u2019s response, on calls and video conferences from London.\nThe Champions League final was delayed for 36 minutes and did not finish until close to midnight on Saturday 28 May, then violent attacks on Liverpool and Real Madrid supporters took place in the early hours of Sunday morning on their way out of the stadium. In an internal email to Uefa staff on Thursday 2 June, six days later, Theodoridis acknowledged that the scenes outside the stadium were harrowing, frightening, distressing and shocking, and apologised for them, then Uefa apologised publicly to supporters the following day.\n\nOn Sunday 29 May, with Uefa waking up to the shock and distress of its staff and thousands of fans, and a burgeoning international scandal, Theodoridis and Marchetti left Paris on a midday train, for a prearranged four days in London. Theodoridis, who supports Olympiakos, sat at Wembley behind the Nottingham Forest owner, Evangelos Marinakis, who also owns the Athens club, leading some observers to presume that he went as a guest of Marinakis.\nHowever, Uefa has explained that Theodoridis had decided three weeks previously that it would be a good idea to attend, because Uefa was jointly organising the \u201cFinalissima\u201d match between Italy and Argentina at Wembley on Wednesday 1 June. A Uefa spokesperson said Theodoridis had asked the English Football Association on 11 May for the tickets to the Championship playoff final, which was before Forest won the semi-final on 17 May, so he was not a guest of Marinakis.\n\nThe spokesperson said that Theodoridis was in \u201cpermanent contact\u201d with key people at Uefa from London and able to work throughout his trip on the Paris response, as well as on the organisation of the Finalissima match.\n\u201cPrior to their departure to London, they held meetings with various persons from the top management of Uefa to discuss the events of the previous night and to start discussions on the next steps to take,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\u201cPlease note that it is very common for Mr Theodoridis to attend games while travelling, as it allows him to meet various stakeholders.\u201d\n\nIan Byrne, the Liverpool MP and board member of the supporters\u2019 trust Spirit of Shankly, said that this greater understanding of Uefa\u2019s decision-making had further confirmed his view that the process to establish the review and appoint the chairman was inadequate.\n\u201cYou have to question their priorities,\u201d Byrne said. \u201cThousands of supporters suffered terribly in Paris and we only narrowly avoided another catastrophic disaster with people losing their lives. You would have thought Uefa\u2019s top executives would have wanted to stay in Paris and really find out what went wrong, and wouldn\u2019t go to Wembley the next day to watch an unconnected match. It makes me further question how much rigour went into establishing the review.\u201d\nThe Uefa spokesperson insisted that the work was still rigorous, saying: \u201cThe follow-up of the events in Paris took centre stage in the agenda of the days in London and led to completing immediately needed steps such as reviewing initial internal reports, the appointment of the chairman of the independent review and all arrangements required for the review to start without delay.\u201d"

                    "body": "The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has sought to reassure Israel and its Gulf allies that Iran will never acquire atomic weapons, ahead of the possible renewal of the nuclear deal with Tehran. \u201cWhen it comes to the most important element, we see eye to eye,\u201d Blinken said at a news conference on Sunday with Israel\u2019s foreign minister, Yair Lapid. \u201cWe are both committed, both determined, that Iran will never acquire a nuclear weapon.\u201d Blinken\u2019s comments came before a meeting with four Arab foreign ministers at an extraordinary summit hosted by Israel\u2019s prime minister, Naftali Bennett \u2013 an event that in itself shows how the landscape of Israel\u2019s relations with some Arab states has been transformed in the past 18 months, driven partly by fears about the imminent end of Iran\u2019s economic isolation. The US also sought to reassure the ad hoc alliance that Washington would not agree to Iran\u2019s demand for the US to lift its designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) as a foreign terrorist organisation. Speaking at the Doha forum in Qatar, Robert Malley, the US special envoy on Iran, said: \u201cThis is not a deal that is intended to resolve that issue. Many in the region view the IRGC in the same way we view them. I can tell you that the IRGC will remain sanctioned under US law, and our perceptions, our views, our policy towards the IRGC have not changed.\u201d A senior adviser to Iran\u2019s supreme leader insisted earlier at the same event that the removal of the IRGC from sanctions was a precondition for the revival of the 2015 nuclear deal. Talks on the deal have been under way for nearly a year in Vienna. \u201cThe IRGC is the national army and the national army cannot be listed as a terrorist group,\u201d said Sayyid Kamal Kharrazi. \u201cThe real thing is that IRGC is very important for Iran and they are not going to compromise on that.\u201d The IRGC is a centrepiece of the Iranian\u2019s regime\u2019s power base, and its activities in Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq and Syria have, in Iran\u2019s eyes, been central to reducing the influence of Islamist terrorism, the US, and Gulf monarchies that depend on the US for their power. The corps has been designated as a terrorist organisation since 2019 and had sanctions imposed upon it in 2017, but its activities across the Middle East have been kept off the table by Iran, which has insisted the agenda focus solely on the terms for America\u2019s return to the nuclear deal. The US walked out of the deal in 2018, leading Iran in stages to reduce its own commitments under the deal, including expanding its ability to enrich uranium. Malley said the Biden administration could promise only that the US under its watch would remain in the deal so long as Iran remains in compliance with its terms. Kharrazi said there were 500 other individuals and institutions subject to US sanctions that had \u201cdirect impact\u201d on Iran\u2019s relations with the west, and called for the US to take actions on those too. Kharrazi, a former foreign minister, is the president of Strategic Council on Foreign Relations in Tehran and his views are closely in line with those of the Iranian regime. Malley refused to be upbeat about a deal, saying: \u201cWe have been pretty close for some time and that I think that tells you the difficulty of the issues that remain.\u201d Also on Sunday, the EU\u2019s coordinator for the nuclear talks met Iran\u2019s foreign minister and its chief negotiator. \u201cWorking on closing the remaining gaps in the \u001d#ViennaTalks,\u201d the EU diplomat Enrique Mora tweeted before his trip. \u201cWe must conclude this negotiation. Much is at stake.\u201d In the US, Republican and Democrat senators are coming together to form an alliance this week to block any recognition of the IRGC or any lifting of sanctions on the organisation. In a joint statement last week, the Israeli prime minister and foreign minister said: \u201cThe IRGC is a terrorist organisation that has murdered thousands of people including Americans. We refuse to believe that the US would remove its designation as a terrorists organisation. The IRGC are Hezbollah in Lebanon, Jihad in Gaza, they are Houthis in Yemen, they are the militias in Iraq. They kill Jews because they are Jews, they kill Christians because they are Christian, and Muslims because they refuse to surrender to them.\u201d Speaking in Israel, Blinken nevertheless defended the principle of trying to revive the Iran nuclear deal, saying: \u201cThe US believes that a return to full implementation of the deal is the best way to put Iran\u2019s nuclear programme back in the box that it was in, but has escaped from since the United States withdrew from that agreement. \u201cBut whether there\u2019s a deal or not, our commitment to the core principle of Iran never acquiring a nuclear weapon is unwavering. And one way or another, we will continue to coordinate closely with our Israeli partners on the way forward.\u201d The Israel summit was also attended by foreign ministers from Bahrain, Egypt, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates. Malley revealed that the British have taken on the task of negotiating the release of US dual nationals still held in Iran, including Morad Tabhaz, the tri-national who was not released nearly a fortnight ago along with Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. Roxanne Tahbaz, his daughter, has accused the UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, of a betrayal of her family. When Tahbaz was allowed out on furlough the family complained about the number of armed guards accompanying him. He was subsequently sent back to Evin prison but then moved to a hotel in Tehran after representations by the British and American governments, the Foreign Office said."

                    "body": "To sum up why Leinster have been head and shoulders above the rest in Europe this season, and why they head into Saturday\u2019s Champions Cup final against La Rochelle as favourites, Stuart Lancaster provides the perfect example. I worked with Stuart during his time with England and his abilities as a coach, first and foremost, were obvious. The problem was he inherited a team that, from a PR and a sporting perspective, had failed at the 2011 World Cup. He took it upon himself to try to change everything, from ensuring the players reconnected with supporters, to overhauling all facets of a team who had underperformed by going out in the quarter-finals.  It was his first international job and it speaks volumes about his character that he wanted to take it all on himself. Ultimately, that proved too big a challenge but the reason why he is proving so successful with Leinster, where he is responsible for shaping the attack, is that he has taken all that experience and channelled it into just one aspect of the club. It typifies what Leinster are about \u2013 so many good individuals focusing on doing their specific job very well and the ripple effect is the synchronicity of how they play. It makes them such a difficult opponent to stop. It sounds simple, but they have brilliant players, brilliant coaches and an infrastructure that allows them to be the best version of themselves. When I say infrastructure, I mean a setup that enables their first team to stay at home rather than go to South Africa for United Rugby Championship fixtures. Spending that time working on unit skills, recovery, cohesion \u2013 you cannot overestimate how much good that does for a team. They effectively go into these mini pre-seasons where they are finessing everything all over again and it\u2019s plain and obvious to see when they get back into competitive rugby. You\u2019ve only got to look at the two No 15s. Jordan Larmour was the new kid on the block, Billy Whizz, and then he got injured and you\u2019ve got Hugo Keenan who was one of the standout players in the Six Nations. It is a real incubator of talent.  I played in the Premiership for 14 years and during that time you did all your skills work and your team units work, or the majority of it, in pre-season. Then you try to top it up as you go, while trying to remain fresh, going Saturday-Saturday-Saturday. It was incredibly difficult but Leinster have so many weeks when they can rest, recover and hone their skills and craft. When I look at their pack, I can\u2019t think of another set of forwards in the club game with so many ball-playing and ball-carrying options. That is a clear product of the work they do in those mini pre-seasons.  By contrast, the French calendar is relentless. The fact that Victor Vito is absent for the final, having picked up an injury in a must-win league match against Stade Fran\u00e7ais last week, is a case in point. In the URC, Leinster don\u2019t have that concern. It would be disrespectful to call it a second team because it was still littered with international players and they still came out victorious, but the fact they could rest the side who line up in Marseille against Munster last week is an obvious advantage. I can\u2019t emphasise enough that I\u2019m not saying that is the only reason for their success, just that it provides them with the environment in which to flourish. As an Englishman who played in the Premiership for so long I can only applaud how Ireland have set up their structure to enable that.  There is a bit of doom and gloom about English clubs in Europe at the moment but I believe it\u2019s too early to see it as a long-term decline, whether due to the salary cap reduction or anything else. Rugby can be very cyclical and rather than the Premiership\u2019s demise, I see the European competitions mirroring what we are seeing at international level at the moment. Three French clubs and one Irish team in the two finals reflects how those two national sides were a cut above during this year\u2019s Six Nations. That doesn\u2019t happen overnight, it requires the pillars for success to be put in place and Ireland and France have managed to achieve that. I was listening to Pep Guardiola talking about the England football team recently. He was reflecting on how they\u2019ve got to the semi-finals of a major tournament, then a final in which they lost on penalties and predicted that once they finally get over the hurdle, they will have something intangible that makes them think they can go on to win many more. In essence, defeats sting but they help to develop character and Leinster are a prime example of that given how difficult it was for them to win their first European title in 2009.  They\u2019ve had some chastening defeats since then, none more so than losing the 2019 final against Saracens and they were overpowered by La Rochelle in last season\u2019s semi-final. While that will add a sense of fuel, they don\u2019t want to be haunted by those losses. This match has to be about excitement and achievement and they have players who have been part of their previous victories in this side to help in that sense. On the day, that might just be the most important factor."

                    "body": "\u201cThe Russian economy is on track to be cut in half,\u201d Joe Biden said in March last year, as he heralded sanctions brought against Russia after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Annalena Baerbock, the German foreign minister, vowed that sanctions were \u201chitting the Putin system \u2026 at its core of power\u201d. Liz Truss, her counterpart in the UK at the time, forecast that Vladimir Putin\u2019s oligarchs would have nowhere to hide. EU sanctions, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said, \u201care working to cripple Putin\u2019s ability to finance his war machine\u201d. The language before the invasion had been no less assertive. At a briefing in January 2022, US state department officials said Washington was prepared to implement sanctions \u201cwith massive consequences that were not considered in 2014 [when Russia annexed Crimea]. That means the gradualism of the past is out, and this time we\u2019ll start at the top of the escalation ladder and stay there.\u201d The Institute for International Finance (IIF) predicted a 15% fall in Russian GDP in 2022. JP Morgan envisaged a 12% contraction. Russia\u2019s own technocrats privately warned Putin of a possible 30% fall.  The reality was somewhat different, reflecting what analysts say was a hubristic over-confidence in the west about the speed with which sanctions that were agreed with unprecedented coordination by the G7 could damage Russia. The Russian economy contracted by only 2.2% last year. Unemployment, according to admittedly dubious official figures, now stands at 3.7 %. The construction sector has been able to grow significantly even if the car and electronics industries have suffered. A bumper harvest has driven growth in the agricultural sector. Russia is now forecast by the International Monetary Fund to grow faster in 2023 and 2024 than the UK. It is hardly financial apocalypse now. As the war approaches its one-year anniversary on 24 February, the debate about whether sanctions are effective has intensified. Defenders of sanctions say the ruble and headline gross domestic product are dreadful indicators, partly because Russian statistics are either classified or manipulated as part of the war effort. \u201cPlease do not ask me about GDP figures. They do not matter,\u201d said Elina Ribakova, the deputy chief economist at the Institute of International Finance, a global industry body. Vladimir Milov, a former Russian deputy energy minister and author of a Martens Centre report on sanctions, said it may be more instructive to track a dozen or so \u201csoft indicators\u201d such as alcohol sales, divorce rates, shoplifting, spending on food, opinion polls, bank customer sentiment or tax revenues. \u201cDon\u2019t look at the watch every five minutes to see if sanctions are working. Exercise strategic patience,\u201d said Milov, who is also an ally of the jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny Agathe Demarais, the author of Backfire, a study of US sanctions, said: \u201cThis is a marathon rather than a sprint, but financing the war is getting more difficult.\u201d Economists at the Kyiv School of Economics go further, arguing that a decisive turning point may already have been reached as a growing Russian fiscal deficit \u2013 spurred by extra defence spending and collapsing hydrocarbon revenues \u2013 forces Russia\u2019s central bank to eat up its reserves. Initial financial blitzkrieg \u201cIt is understandable that the west got carried away at the beginning, leading to false expectations of a palace coup,\u201d said Charles Lichfield, a deputy director of the Atlantic Council, a US thinktank. After all, Russians started to rush for the cash machines, fearing a run on the banks. The rouble tanked, falling from from about 70-75 against the dollar to nearly 140.  The gates to the oligarchs\u2019 European playgrounds were padlocked, their ostentatious toys put into dry dock. The loss of mobility and respectability was a heavy blow, particularly in London where the Conservative government suddenly turned on the Russian rich after decades of laxity and reputation laundering. Within about four months, Russian assets worth about \u20ac13.8bn (\u00a312.3bn) had been frozen. Even the smallest transactions were at risk of getting stuck in correspondent bank accounts for weeks if not months, as international banks became wary of facilitating transfers by Russian clients. In total the EU put sanctions on 1,386 individuals and 171 entities. Hundreds of the larger western firms from McDonalds to BP to IT multinationals \u201cself-sanctioned\u201d themselves by suspending or winding down their Russian operations, even if some did not actually leave. The German chemical firm BASF suffered a $7.9bn (\u00a36.5bn) writedown in the process, even if it hopes to pass it on to the taxpayer.  But in the key opening exchange of the sanctions battle, the Russian central bank, ironically largely staffed by liberal pragmatists opposed to the invasion of Ukraine, got the better of the west. On 28 February, the west tried to ambush Russia by simply freezing what was reported by the country\u2019s central bank to be roughly $300bn or (40%) of its total foreign exchange reserves held overseas. The remainder was not held in western currencies. \u201cThe aim was to make it harder to defend the currency, increase the cost of financing the war and fuel inflation,\u201d said Demarais.  But the Russian central bank\u2019s governor, Elvira Nabiullina, responded decisively, raising the key interest rate to 20% on 28 February, effectively shutting down mortgages and corporate lending but making deposits extremely attractive. It deterred citizens from panicking and withdrawing all their money from their accounts. On 7 March, for the first time in the modern Russian history, the central bank completely banned the sale and withdrawal of dollars and euros deposited before 24 February. Russia also negotiated for some its banks \u2013 notably Gazprombank \u2013 to remain in the global financial messaging system Swift because they handled payments related to oil and gas exports on which the EU were heavily reliant. After a short period of stress in March 2022, structural liquidity returned more or less to pre-sanctions levels. By June the rouble had stabilised. Sanctions war footing \u2013 but not all are in step Once its initial financial blitzkrieg \u2013 prepared in secret in the US Treasury in the months before war \u2013 had been repelled, the west had to revise its strategy, accepting implicitly it had not quite started at the top of the sanctions ladder and there were further rungs to climb. The second phase was going to be more a war of attrition, constant adjustment and consensus-building across the EU. The European Commission went on to a sanctions war footing, according to a study by the Danish Institute for International Studies. \u201cFormal processes that would traditionally take several weeks were concluded within a day,\u201d it found. But flaws in the process appeared. Since EU sanction packages require unanimity, ideological outliers like Hungary held massive leverage. Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s personal connection with specific Russian oligarchs became apparent. For instance, in September last year the Hungarian prime minister asked, probably in return for favours by Putin, for three Russian oligarchs to be removed from the EU sanctions list. Before the 15 March renewal deadline, Orb\u00e1n has lobbied to remove the same trio plus an other six. At successive European Council meetings, his ministers have threatened use of the veto, delaying key sanctions decisions. Most recently, Orb\u00e1n breezily insulted Ukraine as \u201ca no man\u2019s land akin to Afghanistan\u201d.  Some EU states found they did not have the laws, compliance departments or procedures to implement the sanctions agreed in Brussels. Only now is the European Commission working with member states for instance to establish a single contact point for enforcement and implementation issues with cross-border dimensions. Differences in the vigour with which sanctions were enforced became striking. EU figures show Greece had frozen only \u20ac222,000 in Russian assets and Malta only \u20ac200,000. The same two countries in April had tried to block a ban on Russian flagged ships entering EU ports. Austrian companies have hardly rushed to leave Russia. One estimate says 43 Austrian firms have stayed and only two left completely. Belgium has lobbied to keep the 500-year-old diamond industry in Antwerp open to Russia\u2019s Alrosa mining company. Among Nato members, Turkey\u2019s refusal to join the sanctions coalition has become a major problem. By the third quarter of 2022, Russian imports from Turkey had surged to over $1bn a month, roughly double the figure for the same period the previous year.  Turkey became a route for Russia to import vital western-produced goods such as manufacturing parts. Some economists for instance have noticed a mini boomlet in trade between Italy and Turkey, suggesting enterprising Italian traders regard Istanbul as a useful access point into forbidden Russian markets. US Treasury sources say they have now elevated Turkey\u2019s approach to trade with Russia to an issue of prime importance in the bilateral relationship. The US is also looking askance at another ally, the United Arab Emirates. Research by a team of Berlin-based data analysts examining more than 500,000 bank transactions after the war started found that, in terms of value, 66% of withdrawals by non-resident customers of Russian banks went to beneficiaries located in the UAE. This represents a 40% rise on the previous year.  Putin\u2019s throw\u2019s energy poker game lead with dud card The surprising resilience of the Russian economy is not primarily due to the technical professionalism of central bank officials or murky sanctions busting, but instead a blindingly obvious structural flaw in the sanctions: Europe\u2019s reliance on Russian oil and gas exports, the source of 40% of Russian budget revenue. \u201cNot imposing a Russian export embargo early on led to record high trade and fiscal surpluses that gave Putin\u2019s regime a huge financial cushion, enough to sustain many months of the war,\u201d said Oleg Itskhoki, a Russian-American economist. \u201cOnly Putin\u2019s imports were boycotted, while his exports continued. As a result the Russian car and electrical industry collapsed, but not the export of oil and gas.\u201d Various groups of western economists, including R\u00fcdiger Bachmann, Moritz Schularick, Ben Moll and Christian Bayer, tried through March and April to persuade German politicians that cutting off the supply of Russian energy would not lead the German economy to crash. Moll recalled: \u201cSoon after the war started, statements were being made by German politicians that an energy embargo would have dramatic economic consequences. For instance, the economics minister said there would be mass unemployment and poverty. \u201cWe just thought it was important to look at the data and think this through systematically so we put together a team of energy economists as well as micro- and macroeconomists and concluded it might lead to a recession between 0.5 and 3 % but not economic Armageddon. Not all of us agreed with an energy embargo. But the unions and industry lobby denounced our analysis and the chancellor called us \u2018irresponsible\u2019 on national TV, a reflection of the large influence of corporate Germany.\u201d Moll believes in retrospect his analysis of the system\u2019s flexibility and adaptability has been proven right. But the EU could decouple itself from Russian energy only at the speed Germany, the major economy most vulnerable to Putin\u2019s energy blackmail, was prepared to tolerate.  It took until June, after private lobbying by the US and evidence of war crimes in Ukraine, for the EU in its sixth sanctions package to agree to an EU-wide ban on Russian oil exports. But the ban was only to come into force in two delayed phases. The ban on the purchase, import or transfer of Russian seaborne crude oil was not to apply until 5 December and the ban on other refined oil products such as diesel came in on 5 February. The price of Europe\u2019s caution is well known. With the exception of 2020 and 2018, oil and gas had provided 60% of Russian goods exports in every year since 2002. But the early summer of 2022 was a total bonanza for the Russian treasury, as it benefited from the record surge in energy prices. In March, Russia was making \u20ac1bn a day from energy exports. Oil and gas increased to 60% of Russian fiscal revenues, up from 40%. Germany alone has bought \u20ac24bn of Russian fossil fuels since the invasion. Europe funded the Russian war machine that it denounced. The surplus on Russia\u2019s current account for the year was $227.4bn \u2013 a 86% increase on the previous year and more than double the previous record. That helped strengthen the rouble, making imports cheaper. This in turn helped to gradually bring down inflation, taking some pressure off the real incomes of the ordinary Russian population. By the summer Russian treasury coffers were so bloated that Putin felt confident enough to launch a counterattack by slowing gas supplies to Europe. With 40 % of Europe\u2019s gas coming from Russia, he demanded in April that any country refusing to pay for its gas in roubles would be cut off. Europe huffed but complied. By June he started tampering with the gas flow through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline from Russia into Germany. He first cut deliveries through the pipeline by 75%, from 170m cubic metres a day to roughly 40m. In July, the pipeline was shut for 10 days, citing the need for essential maintenance work. On reopening, the flow was reduced to 20m cubic metres a day. Then on 26 September an as yet unidentified intelligence service blew up the pipeline and the neighbouring Nord Stream 2 pipeline \u2013 which had yet to go into service - leaving a mangled wreck and an unsolved crime scene at the bottom of the Baltic.  \u201cPutin shot himself in the foot because by turning off the gas tap, he completely changed the calculus in the European Union and gave the impetus to Europe to diversify away from Russian gas,\u201d Demarais said. \u201cHe made the decision for Europe a lot easier.\u201d Through a mixture of planning and good fortune, Europe has, in the space of six months, largely weaned itself off Russian gas. Renewables have been boosted, the lives of nuclear power stations extended and liquid natural gas terminals built at lightening speed. The European Commission sent out search parties for alternative sources of energy ranging from Morocco, Qatar, Angola, Venezuela, Norway and Nigeria. It was a form of Putin-inspired \u201cshock therapy\u201d. In another blow to Putin, \u201cGeneral Winter\u201d, once assumed to be Russia\u2019s greatest ally, failed to report for duty. Temperatures averaged well above the norm with record highs for winter broken in the Netherlands, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Latvia, Czech Republic, Poland, Denmark and Belarus. That lowered demand for energy, as did the self-restraint of European consumers rocked by record bills. Gas storage levels in Germany in January were at 90%, the highest level ever for the month. Russian gas exports to Europe tumbled by more than 75% compared with the prewar period. The daily price of natural gas on the stock exchange Amsterdam Euronext which had peaked at more than \u20ac300 a megawatt hour after the invasion, has now fallen well below 100 again, to under \u20ac60, still high by the standards of 2020 . Inflation is slowly descending across Europe, and Germany looks to have avoided the widely predicted recession.  Putin had played his best economic warfare card \u2013 cutting gas exports to Europe \u2013 and it was a dud, and will remain so next winter if the EU controls demand. In the space of a year, Putin destroyed Russia\u2019s gas bridge to Europe, the centrepiece of Russian postwar economy. Where do we go from here? The question now is how quickly he can construct a different bridge to the east, and so keep the Russian finances afloat. Russia exports natural gas from eastern fields to China through the 2,500-mile Power of Siberia 1 pipeline, but the western fields, which had served the European markets, are not connected to this export route and cannot be easily redirected to China. Eventually a Power of Siberia 2 pipeline will connect the two fields, but the estimated completion date is 2030. China is also not such a profitable market. Russia was estimated to be charging $3 a metric million British thermal unit (MMBtu) for deliveries to China via the Power of Siberia pipeline, while the estimated charge for deliveries to Europe had been sold at $10-$25/MMBtu. Putin is also in danger of being screwed to the floor over oil, his crown jewel. After persistent US Treasury lobbying, the west supplemented the EU ban on Russian crude oil exports by introducing an unprecedented market intervention that seeks to set a world wide price cap of $60 a barrel for Russian seaborne oil. From 5 December, the same date as the EU import ban, any firm providing payments, insurance, financial services, or brokering, bunkering, piloting services to a ship carrying Russian oil could not receive insurance cover if the oil was being purchased for more than $60 a barrel. If the US or EU catches any company misrepresenting the price or submitting a fraudulent attestation, the G7 can impose sanctions on that company. The UK proposes fines of $1.2m. Putin blustered, saying he would not supply oil to any country for five months that complied with this price regime from 1 February. But this may be a bluff. For China and India do not need to endorse the cap explicitly, but they can take advantage of its existence and their purchasing power to negotiate heavy price discounts in comparison with Brent crude. The price cap is in its infancy, and since the price of seaborne Urals crude averaged $49.48 in January, below the $60 cap, EU tankers \u2013 mainly Greek \u2013 can legitimately carry on transporting oil to China and India. Reports suggest crude oil loading from Russian ports have reached a multi-month high. At best the cap has had the effect of institutionalising price discounts. At worst it is proving toothless. Ukraine and its expert team advisers on sanctions led by the former US envoy Michael McFaul say the cap needs to be halved especially if its purpose is to blow a hole in Russia\u2019s budget. But the US Treasury, in setting the cap, was balancing different objectives: reducing Russia\u2019s income and keeping enough supplies on the seas to avoid another spike in oil prices. That requires a perilous assessment of the price at which Putin decides it is not profitable to extract or export oil. The US is trying to postpone a review of the cap level until March to allow more evidence to be collated. The Kyiv School of Economics insists the numbers on the Russian dashboard are flashing red. Russia\u2019s monthly fiscal deficit reached a record 3.9tn roubles (\u00a343.3bn) in December and its total budget deficit for 2022 was 3.3tn roubles \u2013 or 2.3% of GDP \u2013 set against a projected an annual surplus of 1.3tn. Overall spending in 2022 was 7.3tn roubles higher than forecast, presumably due to vast defence spending. Putin plans to spend 6.3 % of GDP on defence and national security in the 2023 federal budget alone, doubling defence spending to more than 10tn roubles. The question then becomes how long this level of spending can be sustained if energy revenues are falling so fast. Demarais said the first signs of serious strain would be unplanned debt issuance and the sale of some of its 310bn yuan (\u00a337.5bn), the only currency in Russia\u2019s reserves that can be used for interventions in the foreign exchange market. Various estimates exist, but some say Russia\u2019s planned spending is probably sustainable on an assumed Urals crude oil pice of $70 a barrel. Russia won\u2019t burn through its stock of yuan assets this year unless the Urals price halves and averages $25 a barrel, according to Bloomberg Economics. The US bank Citigroup estimates it would only take an average price of $35 to deplete the available yuan resources already in 2023.  But as the past year has shown, Russia is not sitting idle in the face of a price cap. Learning from its growing ally, Iran, it has assembled an ageing dark fleet of smaller, older ships carrying crude oil mainly to China and India. Evasion will be attempted through multiple means: flags of convenience; the blending of crude; Russian insurance schemes; or the simple manipulation of documents. New crude oil transfer hubs are already emerging. It will depend on whether this covert market grows into a viable alternative to the G7 cap, and the price at which the oil is bought by China. In the end an international sanctions war is a game of cat and mouse in which both sides look for clues amid the disinformation to try to pre-empt the other\u2019s moves. Ultimately it is not as decisive as the battlefield, but if the west can stay the course, Putin may yet find his options narrowing. If he survives it will be a huge blow to the power of the dollar, and one that will not go unnoticed in Beijing."

                    "body": "Dave Southgate is toasty in his chilly Canberra home \u2013 and he pays no power bills. A USB-rechargeable heated vest, worn underneath a jumper, and a heated scarf wrapped around his neck offer all the warmth he needs. His heat-loving wife prefers an electrically-warmed seat. They keep electric throw rugs on the couch. A cyclist mate uses heated socks, Southgate says, while hand warmers \u2013 either disposable heat packs that use a chemical reaction to give about 10 hours of warmth, or battery-powered gloves \u2013 are great in pockets for going outside, and in bed instead of a traditional hot water bottle.  \u201cThey\u2019re using bugger all energy,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd you can get yourself beautifully warm.\u201d Australia is in the middle of an energy crisis, a broader cost of living crisis, and an uncommonly bitter cold snap across much of the land. Google data show searches for \u201cheated blanket\u201d and \u201cheated socks\u201d have soared to their highest rates ever in the past couple of weeks. In recent years, the range of personal heating devices available, usually made with small filaments threaded through fabric, has also increased.   There are app-controlled \u201cbody furnaces\u201d that can be strapped to limbs or torsos. Trendy heated scarves come in a rainbow of colours and sport jaunty bows. Remote controlled insoles offer three levels of heating inside your shoes. Chemists sell cheap, disposable hand heaters, while a heated computer mouse will set you back a little more (and only help one hand at a time). There are waist warmers that sit on the hips like corsets or fluffy pink bustles complete with rabbit tails attached, and retro-futuristic heated shoulder pads.  Southgate, 74, describes himself as a \u201cfrustrated climate change bureaucrat\u201d, who has been documenting his family\u2019s transition away from fossil fuels over about a decade. Solar panels now provide more than enough power for the family home. He started by sealing the house from any draughts, and installing energy-efficient infrared panels. \u201cThen we started asking, why are we heating all the air?\u201d Southgate says. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point if you only want to heat people?\u201d So he started experimenting with personal heating devices, and landed on his preferred outfit. \u201cMy wife\u2019s from Malaysia, she wants things very hot. The heated seat is a great favourite,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve left the hot water bottle for heated hand warmers \u2013 they last all night and on a cold day I\u2019ll \u2026 put them in my pockets.\u201d There are more conventional articles, of course, like Oodies and beanies. His son splurges on the fan heater sometimes, but there\u2019s no fighting over a thermostat. \u201cWith personal heating, you can choose what you want,\u201d Southgate says.  Alan Pears, a senior industry fellow at RMIT, says he was working with a retirement home where half the people complained it was too cold and the other half complained it was too hot. \u201cSo we offered the ones who felt cold heated rugs,\u201d he says. \u201cThey loved them.\u201d Many people really don\u2019t understand heating and energy use, he says \u2013 there is a particularly broad misunderstanding that small fan heaters are cheap. But while they\u2019re cheap to buy, a reverse cycle air conditioner on heating mode is far more energy efficient.  But a heated throw rug only uses about as much energy as a light globe, he says (the old fashioned ones, not LEDs).  \u201cWith personal heating devices, you can be cosy and use enormously less energy than trying to heat a room.\u201d Chris Barnes, Choice\u2019s household product expert, points to research that found Australians are more likely to die of the cold than Swedes, because the Swedes are better prepared; while UNSW researcher Philip Oldfield wrote this week that Australian homes are closer to tents than modern eco-houses. Barnes agrees, calling them \u201cglorified tents\u201d. It doesn\u2019t have to cost a lot to make a home more thermally efficient, Barnes says. Using a candle to detect draughts, door snakes to stop them, and even bubble wrap to trap air against windows can help, he says. You might even have a ceiling fan with a \u201cwinter\u201d switch, which will help push warmer air downwards. \u201cIn this day and age, with terrible electricity prices and so on, obviously it\u2019s important to reduce the amount of energy we use as much as possible, and to get as much value as possible,\u201d he says.  Barnes reiterates the point that it\u2019s cheaper to heat a human than a house. But he urges caution when using products like electric blankets and heaters. It\u2019s always worth checking if there have been any product recalls for faulty goods to avoid house fires or electrocutions. Plug-in electric blankets come with particular safety risks, Barnes warns, as the wiring can wear out over time, especially when they are stored folded. \u201cSo if you\u2019ve got an older one, it\u2019s worth replacing,\u201d he says. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission also warns of the harm heating devices can cause when being brought out of storage, used on top of each other or with other electric products. Damaged electric blankets, for example, can start fires or give electric shocks.  Even basic wheat packs or hot water bottles can cause serious burns, and battery-powered heated socks have been recalled in the US after malfunctioning and causing minor burns. Southgate says he wouldn\u2019t let children use heated devices, and that extra care should be taken with older people, who might not realise they\u2019re overheating. But his family is cosy, has reduced its carbon footprint, and hasn\u2019t had a power bill \u201cfor some years\u201d. \u201cIt can be done,\u201d he says, adding that people can start small, by turning the thermostat down just a couple of degrees and working out how to cope. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go cold turkey.\u201d"

                    "body": "Born in Michigan in 1962, director Paul Feig is known for films such as Bridesmaids, Ghostbusters, A Simple Favour, Spy and Last Christmas. On the small screen, he created the comedy series Freaks and Geeks and directed episodes of shows including The Office, Mad Men and Arrested Development; his most recent show is Welcome to Flatch, a US adaption of the BBC series This Country. He is also an actor and starred in the sitcom Sabrina the Teenage Witch. Feig has recently launched his own gin brand, Artingstall\u2019s Brilliant London Dry Gin, in his quest to create the perfect martini. He lives in Chelsea with his wife.  1. Film Tick, Tick... Boom! (Dir Lin-Manuel Miranda, 2021)  Last year was an interesting one for movies, but this was the one that really got me. It\u2019s based on Jonathan Larson, who wrote Rent \u2013 he was a struggling songwriter who wanted to write musical theatre so he put together this stage show based on his struggles. Andrew Garfield turned in a great performance. There\u2019s a whole sequence about people who have Sunday brunch in New York that I thought was one of the most cleverly shot things I\u2019ve ever seen. I was really affected by the film \u2013 it was emotional but very uplifting. 2. Theatre Get Up, Stand Up! The Bob Marley Musical  This is so much fun. Obviously I\u2019m a big fan of Bob Marley \u2013 most people are. But you hear his music so much on the radio that you forget the live power it has. It makes you want to move: every time I\u2019ve seen it, people are up in the audience, dancing and going crazy. It tells his life story, going from song to song, with these great performances. There\u2019s a scene where the woman who plays Rita Marley sings No Woman, No Cry to him almost angrily. It\u2019s really powerful for a woman to sing that song \u2013 it brings the house down. 3. Place Claridge\u2019s, London W1  My mum\u2019s side of the family was British, so I love traditional stuff: Anderson &amp; Sheppard suits, Savile Row. Claridge\u2019s is a happy place for me, because it represents everything I like about London glamour. It\u2019s so well run, and their attention to service is great. I go there to have breakfast, and we have Christmas dinner there when we\u2019re in town. I walk down that curving staircase that goes into the lobby, wearing my finest, and feel like \u201cHey, I belong here\u201d. For an anglophile who grew up in Detroit, Michigan, it\u2019s a fairytale dream come true. 4. Podcast Disaster Girls  I love this podcast by two hilarious young women, Jordan Crucchiola and Amanda Smith. Every episode is about a disaster movie \u2013 some are terrible, some are actually good \u2013 and they go really deep into it and have an interesting perspective on everything.They don\u2019t go in cynically, they really do love disaster movies: anything from Sharknado to a giant Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson movie to Roland Emmerich. They have so much fun doing it and it really makes me laugh. It\u2019s a delightful way to spend a walk. 5. Bar Dukes London, SW1  Dukes bar is my favourite \u2013 I\u2019ve been going there for 25 years. Alessandro Palazzi, the bartender there who\u2019s the king of the martini, started around then too, so I\u2019ve befriended him. I\u2019m a cocktail enthusiast, let\u2019s say. When I was a kid I didn\u2019t want to be a kid, I just wanted to be grown up, and the martini always represented that to me. I love the pageantry of it: Alessandro will roll up a cart, frozen glass, frozen bottle, and make it right in front of you with a lemon peel from the Amalfi coast. It\u2019s just this beautiful, classy place \u2013 it\u2019s my Valhalla. 6. TV Gogglebox  This is my favourite show anywhere. I love Gogglebox \u2013 it\u2019s got me through so many times. When I first heard about it I thought it sounded like the worst idea for a TV show ever. And literally within five minutes I thought, this is comfort food for me. Everybody on it is so incredibly funny, and it just cheers me up. As an American it gives me the chance to catch up on current British TV \u2013 it\u2019s a great highlight reel for the week. Giles and Mary just destroy me.  7. Book Under the Harrow by Flynn Berry I really like thrillers \u2013 Patricia Highsmith is one of my favourite authors. This is a book that came out a few years ago, which is a very affecting story of this woman whose sister is murdered and she\u2019s trying to figure out who did it. It hits a lot of topics about violence against women and sexism and how the legal system is stacked against victims of domestic crime and sexual assault. But then on top of that it\u2019s a cracking good mystery, with twists and turns and a very unexpected ending. Whenever I can\u2019t predict what the ending is, I\u2019m really happy."

                    "body": "Thomas Tuchel believes that Arsenal, Manchester United and Tottenham have spurned opportunities to capitalise on their early exits from the domestic cups and European competitions by making a stronger push for Champions League qualification.\nArsenal, United and Spurs have had long spells to prepare for league games this season but their inconsistency has left them scrapping over fourth place. They have been unable to challenge Chelsea, who have a tight grip on third before hosting Arsenal on Wednesday, and Tuchel was amused to hear some of his side\u2019s rivals have been complaining about fatigue.\n\nChelsea have had little time to rest this season and have already played 54 games after winning the Club World Cup and the European Super Cup, making it to the last eight of the Champions League and reaching the FA Cup and Carabao Cup finals.\nTuchel has had to manage his squad carefully and he is surprised that Mikel Arteta feels Arsenal are at a disadvantage due to their trip to Stamford Bridge being rescheduled three days before they host United.\n\u201cBecause they have one more day off?\u201d Tuchel said when the topic was raised, sarcastically pointing out that Arsenal\u2019s defeat by Southampton in the league last Saturday came 24 hours before his side won their FA Cup semi-final against Crystal Palace.\nThere was another shrug of the shoulders when the German heard that United are unhappy about the scheduling of their fixture against Chelsea next month. Arsenal have played 38 games after missing out on European qualification and losing in the third round of the FA Cup, United lost in the Champions League last 16 and Spurs failed to qualify from their Europa Conference League group.\n\n\u201cThey have been given a huge advantage,\u201d Tuchel said. \u201cIt depends what you make about your situation. That\u2019s why we can use it as an excuse. We can use it to feel very tired and we feel the challenge at the moment mentally and physically. We can use it to have an excuse if things go wrong. Or we can just accept the challenge and go from there.\n\u201cI was not happy when Tottenham were out of the Conference League because I thought: \u2018Wow, I know what Antonio Conte can do with teams when they are focused and he can train them physically.\u2019 I thought this will be a huge uplift for them in the domestic competition, and the same for Arsenal when they went out of the Cup. I thought it would be a huge boost for them, because they have a very young and talented team. To train them and to focus on one competition can be an advantage.\u201d\n\nTuchel had a dig at United by pointing that a disappointing season can be more draining than a busy one. \u201cIt can be also a disadvantage if, maybe, you are Manchester United and you underperform and you are out of cups and you are out of European competitions too early for what you demand of yourself,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can limit your spirit.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult and if you build a team which is built for 60 or 65 games and suddenly you have only 40 and you have whole weeks to prepare for games it can be heavy on your shoulders. It can be more heavy than your heavy legs from playing all the time.\u201d\nTuchel, who said that Mateo Kovacic is out for two weeks with damaged ankle ligaments, hinted that Romelu Lukaku could start against Arsenal. He added that Chelsea will hold talks with Kepa Arrizabalaga over the goalkeeper\u2019s future after he was left out against Palace at Wembley."

                    "body": "The dilemma Do I need a man in my life? I\u2019m 52 and have been a single mother for 14 years. Very occasionally I\u2019ve seen men for purely physical reasons. I\u2019ve never felt I wanted their company beyond that. My child\u2019s father had addictions \u2013 gambling and drugs \u2013 that I only discovered after the birth. That was a painful time. I recovered and grew stronger as a result. I have found I love solitude though I take care not to isolate. I know many people and have a few I would call close friends. I\u2019m now concentrating on my career, which is going well after many years of being mainly focused on parenting, which I have loved. I can\u2019t seem to allow myself past a certain point in a relationship, and struggle to see the worth of allowing someone into my life. When discussing the point of being in a relationship, a friend said, \u201cWell it could offer you a different perspective on life.\u201d I guess sometimes I wonder if I am missing out. I can barely recall what it feels like to be close and have a support, it was so long ago. My previous relationships were with people who were either physically or emotionally unavailable. It\u2019s a painful thing to recall. I have much more love for myself these days, I adore my teenager and my animals. Is there really any need for a partner-relationship? Philippa\u2019s answer If you are asking yourself this question, you can probably do well without someone but, equally, you might still thrive in a partnership. If you never ask this question then it\u2019s because you probably know the answer either way. There\u2019s much research about the health, wellbeing benefits and costs of being in a long-term relationship and you could spend some hours Googling it all. You could have therapy with a practitioner who specialises in attachment theory, to learn how you make or don\u2019t make relationships. When we become more aware of these relationship processes, we can then decide whether we want to change our behaviour \u2013 but I think what you are really asking me here is: are you missing out? The writer Naomi Alderman said that the point of having a partner is to have a witness for your life. While there are plenty of people who can do life happily and successfully without a romantic partner, it is a different experience to do it together. She added, \u201cI like having someone around who gives me a look if I speak to a waiter sharply.\u201d She has a point. It is important to have someone close who can challenge us but with goodwill. Teenage children are good at this. They can get us to think about how we choose to live because they tend to question things, but the other thing with teenagers is that they will probably leave home.  I can imagine that making yourself vulnerable with someone again might feel like sticking your hand into a fire, so it might be an idea to unpick your fears. Ask yourself: \u201cWhat am I most afraid of about being in a relationship? What am I imagining they might do to me, or stop me doing?\u201d If you do embark on a relationship again, it will be different now as you have learned to love yourself \u2013 you won\u2019t settle for someone who makes you unhappy. You would know to find out whether they had addictions and how they made you feel when you were with them. You can take your time. You can take things as far as you are comfortable with and no further. You don\u2019t have to end a relationship you enjoy just because you don\u2019t want to share your whole life and live with them. Sophie Heawood, a single mother for years and author of The Hungover Games, told me that she recently realised that the point of a romantic partner is as much about your experience outside the home as the one you have with them in it. She says her experience out in the world has improved since knowing there is someone at home who loves her no matter what. She says, \u201cIt\u2019s like wearing waterproof clothing after many years of feeling a bit too easily rained on.\u201d For me, one of the reasons for having a partner is to have a mutual, equal relationship with someone you love who accepts you exactly as you are and who loves you, faults and all. It\u2019s difficult under those circumstances not to grow as a person, not to have more courage, generosity and love to give, not only to your partner but to everyone. If you ask other people why, there might be as many answers as there are people. You sound happy with work, you know a lot of people and have some good friends, so you have witnesses for your life. You also have people to have fun with, who give you different perspectives, on whom you can call, and who make you feel good. I think if you find a loving partner it will be icing on a well-made cake. And if you think you prefer your cake without icing, that\u2019s fine, too.

Joe Biden responded to the plan by hammering the \u201cMaga Republicans\u201d he said want to ban abortion nationwide and slash social security. Here\u2019s what else happened today:  A Twitter whistleblower whose anonymous testimony was made public by the January 6 committee warned of the peril facing America\u2019s democracy in an interview with The Washington Post. US intelligence agencies have restarted their assessment of the risk to national security posed by the documents found at Mar-a-Lago. White House officials are said to be mulling an effort to oust the Trump-installed World Bank president after he quibbled over whether humans caused climate change. Former supreme court justice Stephen Breyer expressed remorse over its decision ending Roe v Wade.      8.58pm    Lawyers for Donald Trump are citing legal privilege to try to stop former White House officials from answering questions before a federal grand jury investigating his attempts to meddle with the 2020 election, CNN reports. The effort shows how attorneys for Trump hope to seize on both executive privilege conferred on presidents as well as attorney-client privilege to frustrate the investigation by the grand jury in Washington. His attorneys had made similar claims when they successfully petitioned a judge to appoint a special master to review documents seized from Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort, in a ruling that also temporarily halted the justice department\u2019s probe into the materials found there. Here\u2019s more from CNN\u2019s story:  Former President Donald Trump\u2018s attorneys are fighting a secret court battle to block a federal grand jury from gathering information from an expanding circle of close Trump aides about his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, people briefed on the matter told CNN. The high-stakes legal dispute -- which included the appearance of three attorneys representing Trump at the Washington, DC, federal courthouse on Thursday afternoon -- is the most aggressive step taken by the former President to assert executive and attorney-client privileges in order to prevent some witnesses from sharing information in the criminal investigation events surrounding January 6, 2021. The court fight over privilege, which has not been previously reported and is under seal, is a turning point for Trump\u2019s post-presidency legal woes. How the fight is resolved could determine whether prosecutors can tear down the firewall Trump has tried to keep around his conversations in the West Wing and with attorneys he spoke to as he sought to overturn the 2020 election and they worked to help him hold onto the presidency.      8.35pm    Michael Avenatti was once a firebrand attorney and darling of those who loathed Donald Trump. Now he\u2019s been disgraced by a series of criminal convictions, and today was ordered to pay restitution to former client Stormy Daniels, who claimed to have had an affair with the former president. Reuters reports that a Manhattan court ordered Avenatti to pay Daniels $148,750 after his conviction earlier this year on wire fraud and aggravated identity theft charges for embezzling her book proceeds. He was sentenced to four years in prison in that case, and is also awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty to five federal charges in California.      8.15pm   US intelligence resumes national security review of Mar-a-Lago documents after court ruling  American intelligence agencies have again begun their review of the national security risks of classified documents found at Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort after an appeals court overturned a judge\u2019s order that had temporarily blocked it, Politico reports. The review is one of two that director of national intelligence Avril Haines said would be done of the documents the FBI found at Trump\u2019s Florida resort last month: one focused on their classification levels, the other on what would happen if their contents were made public. Trump-appointed federal judge Aileen Cannon had granted a request from the former president to halt the review of the seized material, but that was thrown out by an appeals court earlier this week.      7.49pm    More on Sinema: a recent poll on the senator found that she was viewed unfavorably by all political parties and across all demographic categories.  A poll conducted by AARP Arizona on the current political environment found that a majority of voters in both political parties did not view Sinema favorably, including across all age categories, genders, as well as racial and ethnic demographics.  The poll results can be viewed here.     7.24pm    In other news, Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona will be giving a talk on Monday at the McConnell Center, an institution named after Republican senator Mitch McConnell that connects young people in Kentucky with political leaders.  The center advertised the talk on Twitter, writing:   This Monday, Sept. 26, the McConnell Center is excited to welcome U.S. Senator Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) to give a talk titled \u201cThe Future of Political Discourse and the Importance of Bipartisanship.\u201d Join via livestream at http://McConnellCenter.org at 10 AM.   Reaction to Sinema\u2019s upcoming talk was somewhat negative, as users criticized the first-time senator for agreeing to give a talk at McConnell\u2019s namesake institution given McConnell\u2019s voting record.      7.03pm   The day so far  With an eye to reclaiming their majority, House Republicans have released their Commitment to America \u2013 which is not to be confused with 1994\u2019s Contract with America or 2010\u2019s Pledge to America unveiled before they reclaimed the chamber in those years\u2019 midterms.

White House officials are said to be mulling an effort to oust the Trump-installed World Bank president after he quibbled over whether humans caused climate change. Former supreme court justice Stephen Breyer expressed remorse over its decision ending Roe v Wade.   Updated at 7.15pm BST    6.43pm    This speech has amounted to a point-by-point rebuttal of House Republicans\u2019 Commitment to America, and as he wrapped up the speech, he turned to its call to \u201cincrease accountability in the election process\u201d. \u201cAnd finally, with a straight face, Kevin McCarthy says that Maga Republicans will restore faith in our elections. As we say in my faith, bless me father for I have sinned,\u201d said Biden, a practicing Catholic. \u201cMaga Republicans refused to accept the results of the 2020 election and the will of the people. \u201cYou can\u2019t let the integrity of elections be undermined,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWhen one side believes there\u2019s only two outcomes in an election, either they win or they were cheated, that\u2019s not democracy. And that\u2019s where the mass majority of Maga Republicans are today. They don\u2019t understand what every patriotic American knows: you can\u2019t love your country only when you win.\u201d  Updated at 6.59pm BST    6.25pm    Biden is hitting back at House Republicans and the Commitment to America plan they announced today, calling it \u201ca thin series of policy goals\u201d and saying the GOP\u2019s true goal is banning abortion nationwide. He cited the words of rightwing supreme court justice Samuel Alito, who wrote in his opinion overturning Roe v Wade that the decision \u201callows women on both sides of the abortion issue to seek to affect the legislative process by influencing public opinion.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t believe Maga Republicans have a clue about the power American women,\u201d Biden said to applause in his speech stumping on behalf of the Democratic National Committee. Referring to the plan announced by top House Republican Kevin McCarthy, Biden said, \u201cHere\u2019s a few of the things we didn\u2019t hear. We didn\u2019t hear mentioned the right to choose. We didn\u2019t hear mentioned Medicare. We didn\u2019t hear mentioned social security.\u201d He went on to link the upcoming midterms to continuing availability of abortion in America, saying, \u201cIn 46 days, America is going to choose. If Republicans win control of the Congress, abortion will be banned. And by the way, it will be initially banned, but if they win Congress, I will veto it.\u201d \u2022 This post was amended on 24 September 2022 to correct a mistranscription of Joe Biden\u2019s remarks about abortion law.  Updated at 1.35pm BST    6.07pm    We\u2019re about to hear from President Joe Biden at an event hosted by the Democratic National Committee, where he\u2019ll no doubt stump for the party and potentially respond to House Republicans\u2019 Commitment to America plan announced today. You can follow the event at the headquarters of the National Education Association here.  Updated at 6.16pm BST    5.50pm    \u201cWithout intervention we really are on this path to catastrophe.\u201d Those are the chilling words of former Twitter employee Anika Collier Navaroli, whose anonymous testimony to the January 6 committee was shared last July, and who has now made her name public in an interview with the Washington Post. She recounted how the platform relished the attention brought by Trump as he turned Twitter into a bully pulpit to rival all others, and downplayed her concerns that he was inciting violence:  After Trump told the Proud Boys, a far-right group with a history of violence, at a September 2020 presidential debate to \u201cstand back and stand by,\u201d Navaroli pushed for the company to adopt a stricter policy around calls to incitement. Trump \u201cwas speaking directly to extremist organizations and giving them directives,\u201d she told the committee. \u201cWe had not seen that sort of direct communication before, and that concerned me.\u201d She had also seen how his tweets were quickly sparking replies from other accounts calling for \u201ccivil war.\u201d After Trump\u2019s \u201cwill be wild\u201d tweet in December, she said, \u201cit became clear not only were these individuals ready and willing, but the leader of their cause was asking them to join him in \u2026 fighting for this cause in D.C. on January 6th.\u201d The company, however, declined to take action, she told the committee. She pleaded with managers, she said, to face the \u201creality that \u2026 if we made no intervention into what I saw occurring, people were going to die.\u201d  In the interview with the Post, Navaroli called on other whistleblowers to come forward while warning that America\u2019s democracy may be irrevocably damaged:  \u201cMy fear within the American context is that we have seen our last peaceful transition of power,\u201d Navaroli said. But \u201cthe same playbook,\u201d she added, is being used around the world, \u201cteeing up the idea that if an election is not in someone\u2019s favor, it\u2019s been rigged. Without intervention we really are on this path to catastrophe.\u201d   Updated at 6.17pm BST    5.31pm     The Trump-appointed World Bank president David Malpass is under fire for deflecting on the question of humans causing climate change, and Axios reports the Biden administration is mulling an effort to remove him. Appointed in 2019, Malpass, a Republican, worked in the Treasury under Trump and also at global financial crisis-casualty Bear Stearns. While Axios reports Biden officials have long been suspicious of him, the uproar began when Malpass replied, \u201cI don\u2019t even know -- I\u2019m not a scientist and that is not a question,\u201d when asked at an event on Tuesday if he believed climate change is manmade. While advocates for actions against climate change, including Democratic president Al Gore, have called for his ouster, it\u2019s not clear if the White House has the ability to boot him, since it does not control the executive directors board that appoints leader of the global development lender. Meanwhile, Malpass has tried to smooth over the situation, telling CNN on Thursday he is \u201cnot a denier\u201d of climate change.     4.55pm   Ex-supreme court justice Breyer 'very sorry' about overturning of Roe abortion rights  Recently retired US supreme court justice Stephen Breyer says he did \u201ceverything\u201d he could to stop the highest bench in the land overturning Roe v Wade to strip US woman of their federal abortion rights, and is \u201cvery very sorry\u201d the decision was made. In his first television interview since retiring earlier this year, Breyer told journalist Chris Wallace that he disagreed with the court\u2019s decision in the Mississippi Dobbs case that including the overthrowing of Roe, announced in June. \u201cWas I happy about it? Not for an instant. Did I do everything I could to persuade people? Of course, of course. But there we are, and now we go on. We try to work together,\u201d he said in the interview that aired on HBO Max today and airs on CNN on Sunday evening. Breyer, 84, said: \u201cDid I like this Dobbs decision? Of course I didn\u2019t. Of course I didn\u2019t.\u201d He tells Wallace it was frustrating to be in the minority on the court, in terms of justices leaning liberal. The court\u2019s conservative majority was consolidated and then expanded by the Trump administration. The final addition under Donald Trump of ultra-conservative Amy Coney Barrett in 2020, replacing the late liberal Ruth Bader Ginsburg, gave the nine-judge bench a six-three super majority in favor of judges leaning right. Breyer announced in January that he would retire and he left the bench this summer, replaced by Joe Biden\u2019s nominee, Ketanji Brown Jackson, who became the first Black woman on the court. Breyer was one of the least high-profile justices. He lamented to Wallace the increasing rigidity of the conservatives on the bench. \u201cYou start writing too rigidly and you will see, the world will come around and bite you in the back. Because you will find something you see just doesn\u2019t work at all. And the supreme court, somewhat to the difference of others, has that kind of problem in spades.\u201d \u201cLife is complex, life changes, and we want to maintain insofar as we can -- everybody does \u2013 certain key moral political values: democracy, human rights, equality, rule of law, etc. To try to do that in an ever-changing world. If you think you can do that by writing 16 computer programs \u2013 I just disagree.\u201d Breyer concluded that he was \u201cvery, very sorry\u201d about the overturning of Roe v Wade. He also said the unprecedented and still-mysterious leak in May of that draft decision, which was penned by ultra-conservative justice Samuel Alito in the drafting and the final version, was \u201cvery damaging\u201d.  Vice-President Kamala Harris earlier this month criticized what she dubbed an \u201cactivist\u201d court and said the US was suffering as a nation since the court took away the constitutional right to an abortion, leaving it up to individual states to decide on the law over the procedure.  Updated at 5.19pm BST    3.54pm    Republicans might be gunning for the House majority, but they have apparently thrown in the towel in one race. Axios reports that the National Republican Congressional Committee tasked with winning House seats for the GOP has withdrawn $1m in television advertisements for JR Majewski, who is trying to unseat longtime Democratic incumbent Marcy Kaptur. It wasn\u2019t his embrace of the QAnon conspiracy theory that did him in. Nor his call for states that supported Donald Trump to secede from the union. Not even his participation in the January 6 insurrection. No, it was an Associated Press report that revealed Majewski did not see combat while deployed to Afghanistan following 9/11 attacks, as he had claimed, but rather loaded airplanes in Qatar for six months. Majewski remains in the race and is spending his time decrying \u201cfake news\u201d, but it\u2019s unclear if he can recover from the news.   Updated at 4.35pm BST    3.36pm    Much as today\u2019s high inflation may benefit Republicans, Democrats have their own advantage they are hoping to work as they woo voters ahead of the midterms: Donald Trump. To be more specific, Donald Trump and everything that happened during and since his presidency. While the Commitment to America top House Republican Kevin McCarthy rolled out today focuses on quality-of-life issues like fighting crime and lowering the cost of living, Joe Biden\u2019s allies are eager to remind Americans that\u2019s not all Republicans stand for. House majority leader Steny Hoyer has distributed a list of eight questions Democrats have for Republicans about their platform, which takes aim at many House members \u2013 including McCarthy\u2019s \u2013 defense of Trump. \u201cWho won the 2020 Presidential Election?\u201d the list asks. \u201cLike President Trump, do you believe that the January 6 insurrectionists were engaged in \u2018legitimate political discourse\u2019 and should not be prosecuted for their violent actions?\u201d it continues. \u201cDo you support defunding the FBI in retaliation for executing a search warrant at Mar-a-Lago?\u201d It also seizes on the GOP\u2019s opposition to abortion access and attempts to cut costs for Americans, particularly when it comes to health care. \u201cWill Republicans pursue a nationwide abortion ban?\u201d Hoyer asks. \u201cIf given the chance, will you try again to repeal the Affordable Care Act and strip health-care access away from millions of Americans?\u201d     3.15pm     Are you a follower of American politics in your 30s or older? Do the words \u201cCommitment to America\u201d sound familiar to you, but you can\u2019t quite put your finger on it? You are definitely on to something. In 1994, the top Republican in the House Newt Gingrich rolled out the Contract with America which contained pledges to, among other things, fight crime and strengthen the economy \u2013 as Kevin McCarthy promised today in his Commitment to America. There are, of course, differences germane to the times. Gingrich, for instance, promised to tighten down on American troops\u2019 ability to serve in United Nations peacekeeping missions, while McCarthy has the issue of inflation to campaign on, which today is at rates not seen since the 1980s. McCarthy clearly hopes to pull off what Gingrich did in the midterms held 28 years ago: wipe out the Democrats and decisively take control of the House. Indeed, the GOP won 54 seats and pushed House Democrats into the minority for the first time since 1954, with Gingrich as speaker until his resignation in 1999.  The similarities aren\u2019t lost on opponents of today\u2019s Republican Party. The anti-Trump Lincoln Project has released an advertisement highlighting the connection:      2.58pm    Speaking in Pennsylvania, top House Republican Kevin McCarthy went through a laundry list of perceived Democratic failings to pitch his party as the right one to control Congress. Among them were topics familiar to anyone who has heard a Republican speak over the last two years: inflation is too high and so is crime, the border isn\u2019t secure and fentanyl is killing too many. McCarthy also made mention of some specific Biden policies that have lately become targets for GOP attacks, saying he\u2019d stop the hiring of new IRS agents and blaming the president\u2019s American Rescue Plan spending bill enacted last year for fueling inflation.  \u201cThey control the House, the Senate, the White House, they control the committees they control the agencies. It\u2019s their plan, but they have no plan to fix all the problems they created,\u201d McCarthy said.     2.39pm    Democrats have failed you, elect us instead. That\u2019s the message top House Republican Kevin McCarthy delivers in the video below, which was released ahead of the debut of the party\u2019s Commitment to America platform happening right now in Pennsylvania. The California representative hones in on high inflation, rising crime and migrant and asylum seekers\u2019 arrival at the southern border. Considering the likelihood of Republicans again winning a majority in the House following the midterms, it\u2019s a message worth paying attention to:  The platform\u2019s debut can be watched live here.     2.21pm    Trump isn\u2019t alone in spending big to get Republicans who deny Joe Biden\u2019s election win into power in November. Peter Stone reports that Pacs controlled by multibillionaire Charles Koch are spending big to support Republicans: Fossil fuel giant Koch Industries has poured over $1m into backing \u2013 directly and indirectly \u2013 dozens of House and Senate candidates who voted against certifying Joe Biden\u2019s win on 6 January 2021. Koch, which is controlled by multibillionaire Charles Koch, boasts a corporate Pac that has donated $607,000 to the campaigns or leadership Pacs of 52 election deniers since January 2021, making Koch\u2019s Pac the top corporate funder of members who opposed the election results, according to OpenSecrets, which tracks campaign spending. In addition, the Super Pac Americans for Prosperity Action to which Koch Industries has given over $6m since January 2021, has backed some election deniers with advertising and other communications support, as well as a few candidates Donald Trump has endorsed who tried to help him overturn the 2020 election, or raised doubts about the final results.      2.06pm    It\u2019s no secret that Donald Trump would like to run for the White House again. The bigger question is when will he announce a 2024 campaign? Reports in recent weeks emphasize that Democrats would love if he did so before the midterms, so they can once again remind voters of the GOP\u2019s ties to the polarizing former president. The announcement of Maga, Inc, the new Super Pac run by Trump\u2019s allies, doesn\u2019t answer that question, but it does show that the former president is willing to work to get the lawmakers he wants elected in the Senate and elsewhere. That\u2019s welcome news for Kevin McCarthy and Mitch McConnell, the GOP leaders of the House and Senate, respectively, who hope voters will give them a majority following the 8 November midterms. But it would also give Trump the chance to make sure candidates he favors win their elections \u2013 potentially putting politicians who support his baseless claims of fraud in the 2020 election in positions of power.  Updated at 2.32pm BST    1.50pm   Embattled Trump aims funding firepower at loyal Republicans  Good morning, US politics blog readers. It might be hard to believe, but the midterms are about to get even more Trumpier. The former president is poised to spend millions of dollars supporting candidates loyal to his wing of the Republican party through a new super PAC launched by his top allies, Politico reports this morning. It isn\u2019t just an effort to bolster embattled GOP politicians nationwide \u2013 it may also be a prelude to Trump\u2019s widely expected announcement of a second run for the White House. That\u2019s not all that\u2019s going on today:  House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy will debut the party\u2019s \u201cCommitment to America\u201d platform as he hopes for a return to the majority in Congress\u2019s lower chamber. Trump will hold a rally in North Carolina at 7 pm eastern time, where we could hear more about his plans for the midterms. Elton John performs at the White House at 8 pm this evening, where president Joe Biden will also give remarks.   "

                "fields": {
                    "body": "For years rugby clubs barely considered their wider profile. As long as their captive audience of season ticket holders and local sponsors were happy, everything else was a bonus. Even for prestigious London sides like Harlequins it was less about the scattering of customers at their games than ensuring there was enough ice and lemon for the committee\u2019s gins and tonics. Sometimes we forget the huge difference professionalism has made. These days a packed house will be in full cry at the Stoop for the European last-16 second leg fixture against Montpellier, hoping to see last Sunday\u2019s 14-point deficit thrillingly overturned. After last season\u2019s Premiership final, when Quins were memorably crowned domestic champions, there should hopefully be a sizeable lunchtime TV audience on Channel 4 as well on Saturday.  Professional club rugby, though, remains a commercial speck on the horizon behind the Premier League, the NFL and the NBA. There is even a quantum leap to be made before it can hope to compete with the international game. Which is why Quins\u2019 biggest promotional platform this month is arguably not the Montpellier fixture but a revealing three-part documentary series about the club made by the Bath and England prop Beno Obano\u2019s company, Sinnybaby Media. Prep To Win, coming soon to Amazon Prime, is an intriguing project on many levels, not least Quins\u2019 willingness to place their trust in an active player from a rival team. Nor was the club permitted full editorial control which even Obano describes as a major \u201cleap of faith\u201d by their senior management. \u201cWe spoke briefly to a lot of other people and initially I found it quite weird how many blockades there were. But Quins were just so helpful. They were like \u2018Yeah, let\u2019s get it done.\u2019 They really wanted it.\u201d Quins\u2019 chief executive, Laurie Dalrymple, confirms it was \u201ca bit of an easy decision\u201d with the club already looking to capitalise on their title success with an inside-the-camp production. Like everyone else Dalrymple has watched Drive to Survive transform perceptions of Formula One and, rugby-wise, is keen for Quins to stay at the front of the grid. It did no harm, either, that Obano is friendly with Marcus Smith, was previously coached by Tabai Matson at Bath and has already cut his directorial teeth by making the well-regarded Everybody\u2019s Game which explored rugby union\u2019s attitudes to social and cultural diversity. The 27-year-old Obano, capped three times by England and a cousin of Maro Itoje, also argues he has an inbuilt advantage over other would-be rugby filmmakers: the ability to deliver a truly authentic end product. \u201cWhen you\u2019re actually in the game, you\u2019re able to go to topics you know are interesting that another director wouldn\u2019t be privy to.\u201d By doing so, he hopes to open the audience\u2019s eyes to aspects they might not fully appreciate. \u201cYou can focus on the people involved, rather than just hoping the viewers will enjoy it.\u201d An unintentional plus \u2013 \u201cDivine timing is what I call it\u201d \u2013 is that Obano has been injured for several months, giving him more time to work on his latest creation. Although he could not snoop around everywhere \u2013 \u201cObviously that\u2019s a huge conflict of interest\u201d \u2013 and some tactical details had to be withheld, he had three cameramen shooting footage for him and was on hand for all the keynote interviews.  Stitching everything together was a challenge but Obano believes people will swiftly develop a new-found appreciation of unflashy players like James Chisholm \u2013 \u201cI couldn\u2019t have made this film without him\u201d \u2013 and gain a deeper insight into recognisable stars such as Smith. \u201cWhen you stick a camera in front of someone\u2019s face, some people are better at being honest than others. But I think we\u2019ve got a good diverse group who were able to speak quite candidly. I\u2019ve known Marcus for a while and been close to him. Marcus is hot right now and he\u2019s a proper nice person. His whole family are in the documentary as well.\u201d There is also a cameo appearance from the ubiquitous David Flatman \u2013 \u201cFlats is very good in it \u2013 he\u2019s proper funny\u201d \u2013 but above all Obano is desperate to demonstrate there is more to rugby than just the international arena. \u201cWe cling on, as a country, to England players. People\u2019s perception of whether somebody is good is only defined by who the England coach is at that particular time or who the commentators are on BT Sport. \u201cA lot of rugby players finish their careers and if they haven\u2019t played for England they feel like a failure. That was in my mind. Let\u2019s try and promote these guys, let the fans understand the game a bit more and make a decision for themselves rather than who Ben Kay or Ugo Monye tells them is really good.\u201d  Not quite so glamour-soaked as Drive to Survive, perhaps, but Obano deserves substantial credit simply for getting the series in the can and for his ongoing mission to enlarge the sport\u2019s footprint. Quins, coincidentally, have hosted the England football manager Gareth Southgate at their training ground this week and Dalrymple, previously chief executive of Wolverhampton Wanderers, can clearly sniff a commercial half-chance. Obano\u2019s view, from the outset, was that the exposure would so obviously benefit Quins and, potentially, the wider game that he \u201cstruggled to see the downside.\u201d  Of course it would also help all involved if Quins, 34-0 down at one point in France, could now complete a remarkable Easter resurrection but Obano has longer term goals. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy making a series. You get days when you wonder if it\u2019s going to be as good as you want it to be. But I created this to make good content around rugby. The sole purpose is not just to create a wider audience. I feel like that\u2019s a by-product of good content. \u201cRugby fans, players, staff \u2013 I hope they all connect with the people they see on screen and understand and admire those stories. Rugby players don\u2019t always come across that well. A lot of them aren\u2019t that cool. They\u2019re just good at sport. But what if we\u2019re able to show some of their personalities? There are so many themes in it but I want people to feel: \u2018I\u2019m now really connected to this sport.\u2019\u201d Perhaps unsurprisingly, Obano says that he has already had messages from other Premiership sides keen to feature in series two. Club rugby could just be on the brink of a game-changing innovation."

                    "body": "Eyebrows were raised among Victorian Liberals when returning opposition leader Matthew Guy announced last September that his new chief of staff would be marketing expert and celebrity wrangler Mitch Catlin. Catlin, known for his Birdcage antics at Flemington and rehabilitating the image of Today show host Karl Stefanovic after his divorce, had little political experience, several Liberal MPs demurred. Others questioned whether he would be able to juggle the demands of the job with his private marketing company and another venture, Buy Aussie Now, launched during the pandemic to support local businesses. Across the Yarra, public relations mavens were also sceptical, although for different reasons.  \u201cI did question it, not because he couldn\u2019t do it, but because it was so far removed from his world,\u201d one PR executive reflected this week. \u201cMitch is absolutely at home in a place like the Birdcage, working \u2013 and mingling \u2013 with the celebrity set. I genuinely couldn\u2019t imagine him behind the scenes at parliament.\u201d Now, less than a year after he was hired, Catlin has resigned after the Age reported he had proposed a donor make more than $100,000 in payments to his marketing company, Catchy Media Marketing and Management, for services described as \u201csupporting business interests\u201d. The government has referred the saga, including any part Guy had in it, to the anti-corruption watchdog, the ombudsman, the electoral commission and state and federal police. Liberal colleagues were irate the party would have even considered supplementing a staffer\u2019s salary through a donor. \u201cPolitics is not a glamorous gig,\u201d one MP said. \u201cYou don\u2019t do it for the dough. I know of many MPs on our side of the chamber who have taken a pay cut to this job, myself included.\u201d  Guy said the proposed payments were considered as part of Catlin\u2019s employment as his chief of staff, telling reporters on Tuesday: \u201cOf course that was part of the discussion.\u201d \u201cBut the point is that was not considered transparent enough \u2026 and nothing was ever [acted] on,\u201d he said. \u201cMitch and I believed it was better to have everyone employed through the budget, which is what it is today.\u201d It is believed Catlin put his hand up to help the Liberals during the pandemic \u2013 who under the leadership of Michael O\u2019Brien were failing to land any blows on the premier, Daniel Andrews \u2013 citing his ability to get a message across. If the reported arrangement had gone ahead, Catlin\u2019s business would have begun invoicing the donor from 7 September 2021 \u2013 the day of Guy\u2019s successful leadership coup \u2013 until the end of this year, totalling more than $140,000.  A former television journalist, Catlin moved into PR and marketing in 2005 and was soon heading up publicity at Myer, where he worked closely with model Jennifer Hawkins, before leaving to join to Swisse vitamins. When Swisse entered the Birdcage marquee at Flemington Racecourse in 2011, Catlin and his team turned a no-show by Kim Kardashian into a social media phenomenon by installing a cardboard cut-out of the reality star for guests to pose with. Later branching out on his own, Catlin worked with basketballer Liz Cambage, former swimmer Geoff Huegill, rugby player James O\u2019Connor and Stefanovic. When Guy was reinstalled as leader, Catlin appeared to be working his marketing magic again. The Bulleen MP \u2013 who in his previous stint as opposition leader came to be known for his aggressive style \u2013 appeared to be reformed. In his first press conference, Guy was optimistic, spruiking a positive plan for Victoria and a united team. He sounded like a new man from the one whose poor 2018 election showing was attributed to the \u201clobster with a mobster\u201d saga and a focus on African gangs. There followed a series of solid policy releases, including new hospitals for regional Victoria and a commitment to legislate an emission reduction target of 50% by 2030. In parliament this week, Guy planned to focus on integrity, an issue where the opposition was considered to have the upper hand in light of the recent report from Ibac and the ombudsman on Labor\u2019s culture. But now, Liberal MPs have said they\u2019re going to struggle to campaign on the issue. \u201cWhile you cannot compare this to what the government has done, it really doesn\u2019t help me when I was doing well [campaigning] on integrity in my seat,\u201d an MP said. \u201cVoters are now going to paint all pollies with the same brush.\u201d  Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning   Former leader O\u2019Brien was outspoken during a Coalition meeting on Tuesday, saying MPs and staff took pay cuts to be in politics and described it as a service to the public. \u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be a place for people doing a side-hustle,\u201d one MP recalled O\u2019Brien as saying. Another Liberal source conceded the party found it hard to attract like-minded people to parliament given the private sector paid \u201cmuch, much better\u201d. \u201cI think we\u2019re all a little bit mad, the ones of us who chose to work in this place,\u201d they said. Guardian Australia has made attempts to contact Catlin."

                    "body": "Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah will be fit for the Champions League final, J\u00fcrgen Klopp has confirmed. The manager said the pair would miss Liverpool\u2019s trip to Southampton on Tuesday but could return for the Premier League finale against Wolves.\nLiverpool\u2019s influential defender and leading goalscorer were substituted during the FA Cup win against Chelsea with knee and groin issues respectively. Both will be absent at St Mary\u2019s Stadium, where a Liverpool win would reduce Manchester City\u2019s lead in the title race to one point with one game to play, but there are no concerns over their involvement against Real Madrid on 28 May. Klopp planned to rest Van Dijk at Southampton before injury intervened.\n\nKlopp, asked whether Salah or Van Dijk could feature on Tuesday, replied: \u201cNo. Virgil definitely not. That was pretty much clear before the game already. We thought this was the game [to rest him] because he played really a lot. Saturday-Tuesday again was clear.\n\u201cThey are both OK. The target for both would be that they could be involved again at the weekend. Properly involved. On the bench and on for a few minutes or start \u2013 we will see with that because that would be perfect for the [Madrid] game. If not, we take each day afterwards. It is very positive and we have no doubt about the Champions League final but we are pretty realistic about the Wolves game. But tomorrow, not.\u201d\nKlopp has reiterated that the financial package it would take to sign Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 is beyond Liverpool\u2019s means. The France international is expected to join Real Madrid when his contract at Paris Saint-Germain expires next month, although there have been reports of another club entering the race for the striker. Klopp, who tried to sign Mbapp\u00e9 from Monaco, insists it is not Liverpool.\n\u201cOf course we are interested in Kylian Mbapp\u00e9; we are not blind,\u201d he said. \u201cI have nothing to say about that [a reported approach] but between Kylian and Liverpool it\u2019s all set, it\u2019s all fine. We of course like him and if you don\u2019t like him then you have to question yourself but, no, we are not, we cannot, be part of these battles. There must be other clubs involved and that is fine. He is a great player.\u201d\n\nKlopp, meanwhile, has said there must be good reason why fans of the club booed Abide With Me, the Duke of Cambridge and the national anthem before the FA Cup final on Saturday.\n\u201cIn these situations I think it\u2019s always best to ask the question: \u2018Why do they do it? I know our people well enough that they would not do it if there was no reason. I am not here long enough to understand the reason. It\u2019s for sure something historical, and that\u2019s a question you can answer better than I ever could.\n\u201cOur fans, and I know a few fans from other clubs see it slightly differently, the majority are wonderful people, smart and go through lows and highs, suffer together. They wouldn\u2019t do it if there was no reason. That\u2019s what I know. Maybe we should ask this question.\u201d\nThe Liverpool manager\u2019s stance drew criticism from Boris Johnson\u2019s official spokesman, who said there was no reason to boo the national anthem and it was a \u201cgreat shame\u201d given the FA Cup is meant to \u201cbring people together\u201d."

                    "body": "For a manager close to winning so much J\u00fcrgen Klopp is remarkably sanguine about the risk of trophies slipping from his grasp over the next fortnight. Had he wanted guaranteed success the Liverpool manager would have accepted one of several job offers from Bayern Munich. Digging in and fighting for it suits his nature better. Part two of the quadruple chase takes Liverpool to Wembley for the third time in four months on Saturday, seeking a first FA Cup triumph in 16 years. Chelsea, Manchester City and Real Madrid. The strength of each opponent in the way of a historic achievement demonstrates the scale of Liverpool\u2019s task and ensures there is no certainty to how the campaign will end. The high stakes and fine margins do not worry Klopp, who is so content that he managed two afternoon naps on Wednesday after Liverpool\u2019s win at Aston Villa the night before.  \u201cWhich club should I go to, to have a different situation?\u201d he says when asked about the challenges and stresses that the decisive final weeks of the season will bring. \u201cThe only thing I could do is ask Pep [Guardiola] if he is sick of all that winning and I take over at City. That wouldn\u2019t work, I don\u2019t want to do it. I could have gone to Bayern a few times, [where] I could have won more titles in my life, pretty sure I would say \u2013 a good chance at least. I didn\u2019t do it. I had a contract here and I never did it. \u201cThe world is not full of winners, the world is full of triers hopefully. And I try and sometimes I win with other people together. I am happy with that. I am not always positive; give me a second and I will find a reason for optimism, that\u2019s probably true, but that\u2019s it. This club went through incredibly tough periods and always hit back and if people can\u2019t appreciate the time we are in or the team they have I would really feel for them, because it\u2019s fantastic what the boys do. \u201cIf you saw the Aston Villa game, the situation we are in, you could write books about the resilience of these boys. One-nil down, everything looks like: \u2018Ah, this time.\u2019 But no. We are three points away [from City] and seven goals. We will try. We cannot do more and I can enjoy that. If people can\u2019t, I cannot change that.\u201d Winning the FA Cup \u201cwould mean the world to us\u201d according to Klopp, though he readily admits to having no personal history with a competition celebrating its 150th anniversary. \u201cI don\u2019t have a lot of FA Cup final memories,\u201d he says. \u201cDo people get asked if they have any memories of the DFB-Pokal?\u201d Klopp\u2019s last game in charge of Borussia Dortmund was a DFB-Pokal final against Wolfsburg in May 2015. Kevin De Bruyne was among the Wolfsburg goalscorers in a 3-1 win that denied Klopp a fairytale farewell.  Seven years on and De Bruyne is still a thorn in the Liverpool manager\u2019s side, scoring four times as City re-established a three point lead in the title race with a 5-1 rout of Wolves on Wednesday. In a week when City also announced the \u00a351.5m signing of Erling Haaland, and Sadio Man\u00e9 was linked with Bayern, future challenges to Liverpool were made clear, if they were not already. Klopp\u2019s priority is the present, however, and savouring every moment of a remarkable pursuit. \u201cIf we are only happy when we are winning in the end, whenever your race finishes, what life would that be?\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I say, \u2018Enjoy the journey\u2019, I mean it. Enjoy the journey because there have been so many great moments already. \u201cIf we stop now it\u2019s not great that we didn\u2019t win the FA Cup final and didn\u2019t win the Champions League final and came second in the Premier League. Forget that and just say: \u2018Wow, that was a ride.\u2019  \u201cWe only cause ourselves problems as human beings. \u2018Don\u2019t come home without a quadruple,\u2019 for example \u2013 then you will never be happy. If that is the only way to satisfy you that is really difficult. Let\u2019s give it a go. Football games are sometimes decided by single players; most of the time they are decided by the whole performance and we can work on the whole performance and have world-class players \u2013 and we will have world-class players. \u201cIt is not what other teams are doing and like: \u2018God, they signed him.\u2019 I never thought that, to be honest. When they took a player from me and put him there, in Germany quite frequently, it gives them 20% extra, and us minus 20%, and that\u2019s not cool. But as long as they don\u2019t pick from us I\u2019m fine.\u201d Klopp adds: \u201cIt [the quadruple] has never been done before so it\u2019s like the first step on whichever island. We know the decisive part is coming now. Warming up is finished and we have rhythm, finally. Now we can go for it.\u201d"

                    "body": "Joe Biden\u2019s hardline stance on Russia has won him widespread plaudits, but with the most serious oil shock in decades now a reality, the US president\u2019s attempt to cushion the blowback continues to meet resistance from the two allies he needs most. Saudi Arabia\u2019s de facto leader, Mohammed bin Salman, and his counterpart in the United Arab Emirates, Mohammed bin Zayed, are yet to agree to a phone call with the west\u2019s most powerful man \u2013 a scenario all but unthinkable during previous administrations.  Biden\u2019s immediate priority is for both countries to help exert maximum economic pressure on Russia by cranking up their oil output. Each capital is a major supplier of oil, with excess capacity, which would soften the effect on US consumers through fuel prices before midterm elections in November that threaten Democratic control of Congress. With relations between the Middle East oil powers and Washington at their lowest ebb in modern times, though, a reckoning is due that may realign the regional order on terms that favour Riyadh and Abu Dhabi. Both leaders have made it clear that they will settle for nothing less, and are ready to extract their price. As if to show the Biden administration what it could do, the UAE ambassador to Washington, Yousef al-Otaiba, last Wednesday said it favoured production increases \u201cand will be encouraging Opec to consider higher production levels\u201d, leading oil prices to fall by 13% the next day. But no action to increase supply followed and by the week\u2019s end the price per barrel was back up to almost $130 (\u00a3100), an uncomfortably high level for Biden to take to the midterms. However, the standoff involves far more than oil. In Riyadh, Prince Mohammed feels snubbed by Biden\u2019s refusal to engage with him ever since he took office. The murder of the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi by the crown prince\u2019s security aides, the war on Yemen, the jailing of rights activists and the boycott of Qatar have made him a pariah to the administration.  Disputes with Abu Dhabi are nearly as stark. The US has been particularly taken aback by UAE\u2019s repeated abstentions in the UN security council, which have been seen by western diplomats in New York as a quid pro quo for Russian support of some of the anti-Houthi positions it wanted the council to take over the war in Yemen. Saudi Arabia and the UAE have been incensed by the Biden administration removing the Iran-backed Houthis from the global terror list as they continue a painstaking series of negotiations with Iran to restart the Obama-era nuclear deal shredded by Donald Trump. Beyond that, though, there is a strong feeling in both capitals that Biden has approached the region with a deeply critical view of countries that had long been security allies, and lenient on Iran, which remains a foe. Having attempted last week to recruit Venezuela to the cause of isolating Russia, the White House views efforts at repair work on the relationship with Saudi Arabia and the UAE as an acceptable price to pay. The administration in February sent Brett McGurk, the White House coordinator for Middle East policy, and Amos Hochstein, the state department\u2019s special energy envoy, to Riyadh for a meeting with the crown prince. On the eve of the invasion of Ukraine, the Treasury announced sanctions on an alleged Houthi financing network. Sir John Jenkins, a former British ambassador to Riyadh and a senior fellow at the UK thinktank Policy Exchange, said ties that had been growing between Riyadh and Moscow, particularly since Biden sidelined Prince Mohammed, would probably need to be recalibrated if a reset was to take place. \u201cI think it\u2019s very complicated,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t make a one-way bet on Putin myself. But that\u2019s how the Saudi position in particular will look to many in DC. That will just piss people off. And tempt them in turn to bet on Iran instead. You have to deal with [Prince Mohammed]. But if he demands a complete climbdown from Biden, I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll get it. \u201cThere has to be some way of squaring this circle. A renewed US promise to defend KSA [Saudi Arabia] and the UAE from Iran is one way. Redesignation of the Houthis and a renewed commitment to settling Yemen in a way that would suit Riyadh and Abu Dhabi is another. But I can\u2019t see Biden saying he\u2019s simply going to forget Khashoggi. \u201cI personally don\u2019t think Russia matters that much to KSA. China\u2019s far more important. Beijing wants to avoid a collapse of global trade \u2013 or a prolonged western recession. And there are signs Beijing is trying to position itself appropriately. The risk then is that a hard line from Riyadh will just backfire.\u201d Robin Mills, the CEO of the UAE-based consultancy Qamar Energy, said increasing oil supply, and therefore reducing prices at the bowser, was a relatively straightforward technical process, but carried political and economic risk in dealings with the global oil body Opec, of which Riyadh and Abu Dhabi are members. \u201cThey could ramp up supply within one month and reach full capacity within 90 days,\u201d he said. \u201cOpening chokes on wells, restarting wells entirely, perhaps restarting gathering and production stations. \u201cEveryone has always cheated on Opec agreements when it suited them. Can you do it quickly? Not tomorrow, certainly. But unless something\u2019s gone seriously wrong, KSA should be able to make a three-month difference. That in itself would help \u2013 to a degree \u2013 in calming oil markets.\u201d"

                    "body": "  9.56pm    Thank you so much for joining me for this stunning and scintillating match. The Arnold Clark Cup and a first home win against Germany bagged for England. Germany put up a great fight but in the end England managed to claim the win, albeit with Bright\u2019s goal being offside. If you want to recap all the action from the match, read Suzy Wrack\u2019s report here.     9.49pm    I didn\u2019t notice it at the time but Bright was actually offside for her goal. There isn\u2019t any VAR in the match and so England got away with that. Ian Wright has made a good point as the assistant referee was perfectly line up and should have spotted the error.   Updated at 9.58pm GMT    9.47pm    England manager Sarina Wiegman told ITV: \u201cThe tournament was as we expected, three top level games. We have seen different players and starting line-ups. We have seen different style. \u201cToday we weren\u2019t tight enough but then you have to be compact as a team. \u201cWhen I came in this team had a lot of experience. The eagerness to commitment and wanting to learn is immense. It has been a pleasure so far. \u201cYou want to keep all the players fit and in form at their clubs. Other teams progress too so it\u2019s hard to predict [Euros outcome].\u201d     9.44pm    Wiegman remains undefeated as England boss and has shown her brilliance with those late subs and formation changes. So many people were questioning putting Bright up front in the closing moments of the match but it paid off massively. It\u2019ll be interesting to see what the manager says, she should be facing the press shortly.     9.40pm    Yellow streamers drown the England team as they raise their arms and the crowd goes wild. A great moment for the team who have struggled for form over the past few years. Wiegman has done unbelievably well since taking the helm in 2021.   Updated at 9.56pm GMT    9.37pm    Millie Bright and Alexia Putellas have posed for a picture with the golden boot, both scoring two goals in three games. The breakthrough star of the tournament has been named as Spain\u2019s Athenea del Castillo - very much deserved. England players are putting medals around each other\u2019s neck ahead of the trophy lift.     9.35pm    It\u2019s worth remembering how close this tournament was, England have won this cup on goal difference. The only side not to claim a win was Germany and Canada and Spain only bagged a victory each. This sets up such an exciting stage for the Euros! Trophy ceremony to come ...     9.32pm    Player of the Match Millie Bright told ITV: \u201cIt\u2019s brilliant. For us in the past it was a rocky road, for us to finally be on a journey together we are on the right road. \u201cThis is just the beginning. It wasn\u2019t pretty out there but it\u2019s another element to our game that we can win dirty. \u201cWe\u2019re not bothered who scores, it\u2019s just about getting it in the back of the net. \u201cWe have shown that we can win\u201d     9.30pm    While the concentration and talk will be around England because of the dramatic late win, props need to be given to Germany. They came into this tournament without 12 players due to injury and Covid. They held Spain to a draw, lost 1-0 to Canada and suffered a late defeat to England. And my, oh my Magull\u2019s strike is something so promising for the visitors. Imagine Magull at the Euros when all of their star players return. The Euros are going to be amazing.     9.28pm    Take a look at the England goals which sealed the win:       9.25pm    England are screaming and hugging each other, such wholesome scenes! Bright, Player of the Match, embraced Sarina Wiegman and you can just see what it means to them.     9.23pm   Full-time: England 3-1 Germany  England have won the Arnold Clark Cup and defeated Germany for the first time at home. A great strike from White in the first match was cancelled out by arguably the goal of the tournament from Magull. The second half saw both teams playing well with shots coming in. But it was England\u2019s Bright who broke the deadlock and Kirby added the extra. A breath-taking match, I am so excited for the Euros!  Updated at 9.26pm GMT    9.22pm    Kirby makes a sensational break and just kept going. And going. And going! She smacks it home and seals a cracking match.    Updated at 10.03pm GMT    9.22pm   GOAL! England 3-1 Germany (Kirby, 90+3')  Wow, this is why Kirby should be at 1o     9.19pm    90 + 2 min: There are three minutes added to this match. Germany look desperate to keep England to two goals as Russo and Hemp look to shoot. The defence does enough to quell the danger     9.17pm    90 min: Player of the Match has been confirmed as Millie Bright. The defender has played well in defence and came through for England when they needed her.  She\u2019s also the joint top tournament scorer with Spain\u2019s Alexia Putellas.     9.16pm    88 min: England look to get a third as Hemp passes to Kirby but German shirts swarm. The visitors look to equalise one again, Rall is doing so well to battle with Kirby. The Chelsea star, though, ends up on the better end and wins a free kick. Germany make a change as Buhl comes off for Cerci. What a match this has been!     9.14pm    86 min: It\u2019s interesting to note that was one of the many runs Hemp made where she kept her head up. Emma Hayes mentioned the Manchester City star didn\u2019t have enough awareness but she seemed to get it just in time. What a finish from Bright as well! The camera has panned to Spain who are not happy with that score.     9.13pm   GOAL! England 2-1 Germany (Bright, 84')  England are so intent on finding a winner they have left Bright up front. And what a decision that is! A cracking ball from Hemp sees Bright tap home.     Updated at 10.01pm GMT    9.11pm    84 min: Hemp thumps the ball upfield as England throw everything at Germany to try and find a winner. But it\u2019s the visitors who look dangerous, Brand almost scores from a cracking header. This is so tense!     9.10pm    82 min: Williamson takes a shot and the attempt sails way over the bar. Possession pinballs around the midfield and it ends in a break in play. England take the opportunity to bring Russo and Toone on for White and Bronze.     9.08pm    80 min: We are back, I have a feed back up and running! England have a free kick and Kirby takes it. Bright gets a head to it but it goes wide. Wow, what a stressful few minutes!     9.06pm    75 min: I apologise for the lack of on pitch updates, the ITV Hub has decided to have a meltdown and Twitter is raging about it! According to my Twitter sources, Germany were pinging the ball in the box but couldn\u2019t quite get a shot away. England countered as Kirby saw a shot rattle the woodwork. Russo on shortly.     9.01pm    71 min: Neither side are yet to find a winner and Germany are the first to bring on their next changes. Hagel and Dallmann are on for Dongus and Magull. Interesting move taking Magull off. The goal-scorer and such a bright spark to this second half.     8.59pm    69 min: Alessia Russo is said to be warming up and will be the next England change. It will be interesting to see (if ITV wants to get their Hub back up and running) how she goes as she hasn\u2019t had the best tournament.     8.55pm    66 min: England are on the attack once again with Daly smashing a great ball in. It just beats White as the hosts look to put themselves ahead once again. I\u2019m relieved and frustrated to update you that it isn\u2019t my internet causing the issue with my feed, it\u2019s ITV Hub cutting out. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s because so many fans are trying to watch the match. If you want to vent Hub frustrations to me, I\u2019m all ears! Email or send me a tweet!     8.52pm    64 min: A heavy challenge comes in as Hemp and Gwinn collide. The England star looks in pain, let\u2019s hope she is okay! She is on her feet and is staying on the pitch. My feed has decided to cut again, the joy. I\u2019ll be all over any updates while my laptop decides to play ball though!      8.49pm    62 min: It was a solid cross from Stanway but it pings back out to Bronze. Her cross doesn\u2019t have an affect. But Hemp is with the ball again and this time shoots, it\u2019s saved by Frohms and she was offside anyway. England make their first change as Stanway comes off for Parris.     8.48pm    60 min: Hemp is great at dribbling the ball around the box but she needs to shoot! She\u2019s in a great position but gets caught in two minds and doesn\u2019t pull the trigger. She makes up for it by winning a free kick. Stanway on the kick again ...     8.46pm    58 min: Brand concedes a free kick with a foul on Walsh. The kick goes to Bronze but her pass is cut out.  This is turning into a slightly sloppy performance from England now. Germany are really building and the mistakes are seeping into the Lionesses game. This may be the brightest Germany has played this tournament.     8.44pm    56 min: Williamson this time the one to lose the ball in the midfield but Bronze does well to get back to clear. England counter well with Hemp crossing to White but Feldkamp shuts down the attack - a great defensive move.     8.42pm    53 min: Bronze has a sloppy pass and it would have seen Buhl away but the German stops as she fouls Bronze. A lucky escape for England. Walsh passes sublime ball to Hemp who wins a corner. Stanway plays it short and low which is easy to read from Germany. Interesting the Lionesses have switched who takes the kick. Greenwood had been the taker.     8.40pm    51 min: Dongus\u2019 pass goes straight out after impressive play from goal-scorer Magull. England look to build but they spill the ball in Germany\u2019s half, a dangerous spell here for the hosts. Brand gets it into the box but a sloppy pass sees England full of relief.     8.38pm    49 min: Bronze does excellently as Germany look to shoot in a great position. She calmly intercepts the ball. Buhl has had a bright game so far and continues to be a big threat.     8.35pm    47 mins: What a fun fact, England have never drawn three consecutive matches in their international history. Hemp looks to break but it just gets away from her. Williamson gets the ball and the crowd encourages her to shoot, she doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s a high tempo star with only one change at half-time with Brand on for Germany.  Updated at 8.36pm GMT    8.33pm    We are back underway. England need to score again in order to win the Arnold Clark Cup. If Germany hold them to a draw or bag a win, the cup will go to Spain. In other news, did I grab another Skittles bag in the break? Maybe I did, maybe I didn\u2019t.     8.20pm    Here\u2019s a look at Magull\u2019s sensational strike!      8.18pm   Half-time: England 1-1 Germany  As I said before the game, don\u2019t count out Germany. White scored a beautiful opener after sustained England pressure. The hosts continued to impress and an error from Greenwood led to a German freekick. Magull then struck the perfect freekick, it superbly curled into goal with Roebuck able to do little to stop it. We are all square!     8.16pm    45 +1 min: England are retaining possession here, maybe running down the clock? There are two minutes added. Feel like my stress levels are back to normal now, phew the panic when my feed cut was very real!     8.15pm    44 min: My feed is back, huzzah! Gutted I missed that goal in real time, it was an absolute stunner. The equaliser means as things stand, Spain will win the tournament.     8.12pm    From Twitter sources it seems Greenwood was booked, giving Germany a free kick. Magull curled the shot straight into goal, now we have a match on our hands!     8.12pm   GOAL! England 1-1 Germany (Magull, 43')  Don\u2019t you just love it when the feed cuts and a goal is scores, I know I do!    Updated at 8.31pm GMT    8.10pm    39 min: Another mistake from Kirby in the midfield, unlike the Chelsea star. A pass gets away from her to gift the ball to Germany. Walsh wrestles the ball back, who passes to Greenwood and she sends it upfield. Hemp clatters to the floor to earn a free kick in scoring distance.  Greenwood takes the kick and just as she does my feed on ITV Hub cuts out. Just what I need!      8.06pm    36 min: Dabritz, what a mistake! She nabs the ball after Kirby\u2019s pass is loose in the midfield.  The German captain makes a great run but doesn\u2019t get it away to a teammate and Bright runs her off the pitch. England counter and White is almost through to double the lead.     8.04pm    34 min: Magull dribbles the ball around the top of the box and feeds Rall. She takes a shot but Roebuck calmly collects. Carter is receiving more treatment, surely she is coming off here? Yeah she is, Daly on in her place.  Updated at 8.05pm GMT    8.02pm    32 min: A lot of play in the midfield with possession exchanging hands. Carter looks to be suffering from that earlier clash, will keep you up to date on if she is taken off.     8.00pm    29 min: A clever play started by Rall sees Germany in the box for some time. Unfortunately for Germany, England manage to get the ball away. The match has so much tempo but some passes need to be more clinical for both sides.     7.57pm    27 min: Oh Stanway what a goal that would have been. White has a great pass and it looks like a bicycle kick from Stanway.  Frohms makes a cracking save to limit England\u2019s lead. Hemp wins a free kick from England\u2019s half, seeing the Lionesses build again from deep.     7.55pm    25 min: Roebuck almost loses control of the ball in front of goal but she manages to scoop it up. A shaky start from the Manchester City keeper so far. Bright gifts away a throw in to halt Germany attack. Gwinn takes the throw but England clear. Hemp now on the run who passes to Carter. The Chelsea star\u2019s pass isn\u2019t good and it goes all the way back to Roebuck.     7.53pm    22 min: The game has wound down slightly with Carter down with injury. She got back to her feet and will play on.  With the lull in the game, a recap of where we are at in the worst to best Skittles debate. We are now on yellow, green, orange, red and purple. Let me know your thoughts! An England corner sees Greenwood cross in but it goes to nothing.  Updated at 7.58pm GMT    7.50pm    20 min: Bronze concedes a corner after great play from Gwinn. Buhl takes the kick but England clear well. The ball then pinballs around the box and eventually get it away. This game is full throttle!      7.49pm    18 min: As things stand England will win the tournament on yellow cards but Germany aren\u2019t going to lay down and let the hosts take a win. The goal hasn\u2019t shaken the visitors but they will have to do something to stop the momentum soon.     7.47pm    Kirby tries to get a shot away but Germany tap it back. The lack of power on the clearance meant Kirby could pass to White who splices it home. Are England on their way to a first home win against Germany?     7.46pm   GOAL! England 1-0 Germany (White, 15')  Finally England get their opener, a great team goal!     Updated at 8.32pm GMT    7.44pm    14 min: Hemp holds onto the ball in the final third a touch too long to silence a deadly attack. And Greenwood puts a delightful pass in but again England spill the attack. This must be frustrating for England fans to watch. The German defensive wall holds strong though and the visitors look to counter.     7.42pm    12 min: Bronze deals well with a slow build from Germany, the pressure from the visitors is brilliant. Williamson concedes a corner and Buhl takes the kick. Rall gets a head to the cross but Roebuck jumps on it. Roebuck gets herself out of trouble as a pass from goal goes loose. She smothers the ball heading back to goal.     7.40pm    9 min: Carter did well to win a throw in as Germany players swarm the ball.  Germany start to counter but Walsh intercepts the ball and look to build from deep. A great start from England so far.     7.38pm    7 min: As Rall clears a great Greenwood pass, we have had more opinions on Skittles. Courtney has tweeted me: \u201cOrange deserves to be higher up that list.\u201d I don\u2019t think I would be mad if orange rose in the ranks, anything but the yellow.     7.36pm    5 min: Is there anything Hemp can\u2019t do? Every time she has played for England this tournament she has made great breaks. Her danger is dealt with well though Buhl. The hosts wins a free kick, Greenwood takes the set-piece but it goes to nothing. Rall looks to counter but Roebuck collects. Lively exchanges!     7.33pm    2 min: The Skittles debate is raging on and I have received a controversial comment. Daniel reached out via Twitter and said: \u201cI\u2018m very uncouth and just bundle a lot in and snaffle them down, so I don\u2019t really know if yellow ones are gross or not. I hate yellow Starburst and Fruit Gums though.\u201d I feel you need to do a taste test Daniel to see if your hate for yellow sweets extends to Skittles. An interesting experiment. Back to the football, England have started brightly!     7.31pm   Kick-off: England 0-0 Germany  I think this is the loudest crowd yet, huge applause and cheers for both teams! The anthems ring out and the players discard their jumpers. Here we go!   Updated at 7.48pm GMT    7.25pm    Earlier I said I was unsure who would win the tournament if England beat Germany 1-0 and pick up three yellow cards, I now have the answer - England and Spain would share the trophy. I don\u2019t know how to feel about a shared win if I\u2019m honest The players are about to come out onto the pitch with anthems to follow. Kick-off isn\u2019t far away ...     7.17pm    I am grateful to share I am not the only person who hates yellow Skittles, our very own Suzy Wrack has told me she tolerates them. Suzy went a step further and ordered them worst to best, I can\u2019t say I disagree with her. Yellow, Orange, Green, Red, Purple.  I will welcome, and challenge, any other orders or opinions on Skittles. Email me or send me a tweet @rendellx.     7.12pm    The stats are ever in Germany\u2019s favour ahead of this clash. The visitors have played England 26 times and they have only lost once. On top of that, Germany have never lost to England away from home. It\u2019s an astonishing achievement and they will look to maintain it. Kick-off in just over 15 minutes.     7.07pm    If anyone was intrigued by what snack I landed on, I went with Skittles. The only issue is I hate the yellow ones. Does anyone else share my disgust? Anyway, back to the task in hand, we are just over 20 minutes away from kick-off. Can England take the trophy? Or will Germany halt the celebrations? Get in touch and let me know.     6.59pm    I believe this is the first Arnold Clark Cup match England have played without a storm going on. First it was Eunice, then Franklin.  The weather isn\u2019t much brighter but at least it\u2019s not gale force winds and rain!   Updated at 7.45pm GMT    6.53pm    England manager Sarina Wigeman told ITV: \u201cAs we said we play three games, we will try some things. A lot of players will get minutes and after this tournament we will have a lot of information. \u201cIt is very competitive [in goal]. At the moment Mary is our first choice keeper.\u201d     6.48pm    Considering how injury hit Germany\u2019s team was heading into this tournament, they have played extremely well and it won\u2019t do England any favours if they under-estimate them. They were able to claim a late equaliser against Euros favourites Spain and just lost 1-0 to Canada. We have quite the match on our hands.     6.40pm    The biggest surprise for me there was Hannah Hampton\u2019s change. I know I should have seen it coming with the goalkeepers changing every match but Hampton did fantastically well on her debut last time out. Before the tournament decider gets underway I\u2019m going to raid my snacks cupboard, I\u2019m thinking maybe some Skittles or crisps. Do you have a go to snack for football? Let me know be emailing me or dropping me a tweet @rendellx! I\u2019ve also gone rogue and made myself a coffee past 6.30pm. Will I regret this later? More than likely.  Updated at 6.41pm GMT    6.36pm    England have made six changes following their draw with Spain and it sees Leah Williamson handed back the captaincy. England\u2019s starting XI is: Roebuck, Walsh, Greenwood, Bright, Kirby, Williamson, White, Hemp, Bronze, Stanway, Carter Substitutes: Earps, Daly, Stokes, Toone, Hampton, Mead, Parris, Nobbs, Charles, Scott, Russo, Zelem Germany have made five changes from their loss to Canada. Their starting 11 is: Frohms, Rall, Feldkamp, Kleinherne, Gwinn, Dongus, Dabritz, Magull, Anyomi, Schuller, Buhl They haven\u2019t released a list of substitutes but I will try and track them down.     6.30pm    Preamble Welcome back to the Arnold Clark Cup and we return with its concluding match. England take on Germany and the hosts have the potential to win the tournament if they can limit their disciplinaries and claim victory over their opponents. England are currently third and but with Spain beating Canada 1-0 earlier today, the Lionesses could take the crown. Germany, meanwhile, are unable to win after a draw and a loss so far in the competition. So how can England win? This is where it gets complicated ... If England beat Germany 1-0 and only get two disciplinaries they win. If they beat Germany and score more than two goals they win. I\u2019m unsure how the tournament would be decided if England beat Germany 1-0 and pick up three disciplinaries as they would then be all square with Spain. But we will cross that bridge if it comes to it! Both England and Germany will release their starting XI\u2019s shortly for the 7.30pm kick-off, so stay tuned.  "

                    "body": "Chelsea have withdrawn a request for Saturday\u2019s FA Cup quarter-final at Middlesbrough to be played behind closed doors after causing exasperation and disbelief in the sport and in Downing Street with their desperate push for permission to sell tickets.\nThere was widespread incredulity after the European champions, blocked from taking up their full allocation of 4,500 tickets at the Riverside Stadium, said they were asking the FA board \u201cto direct that the game be played behind closed doors for matters of sporting integrity\u201d. Middlesbrough said the suggestion was \u201cbizarre and without any merit\u201d and it drew a furious response from the government, who accused Chelsea of blurring their priorities with the club up for sale and Friday\u2019s deadline for bidders to submit proposals drawing closer.\n\nThe move was set to be rejected by the Football Association, which announced: \u201cAfter constructive talks between the FA and Chelsea, the club has agreed to remove their request for the Emirates FA Cup quarter-final tie against Middlesbrough to be played behind closed doors.\n\u201cThe FA remains in ongoing discussions with Chelsea, the Premier League and the government to find a solution that would enable both Chelsea fans to attend games and away fans to attend Stamford Bridge, whilst ensuring sanctions are respected.\u201d\nChelsea have been frustrated in their attempts to make further amendments to the operating licence they are under as a result of the sanctions imposed on Roman Abramovich. The club have sold 500 tickets for Saturday\u2019s game but the licence prohibits further sales and is intended to stop Abramovich from profiting from any income.\nChelsea\u2019s view is that the ban on ticket sales will lead to financial difficulties and they are upset that the government has not responded to their pleas. The club have issued assurances that the money from tickets would not go to Abramovich, who has been accused of having links to Vladimir Putin and the Russian state. They are also annoyed that their request to give away tickets for the Middlesbrough game for free did not receive a response from the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI).\nWhitehall officials said they had seen Chelsea\u2019s statement with \u201cdisbelief\u201d after making concessions to the club by changing parts of the licence last weekend. It was pointed out that Abramovich is linked to a \u201cbarbaric regime\u201d and one senior government source said Chelsea\u2019s behaviour was \u201clike a drowning person in shark-infested waters, complaining they aren\u2019t on an oligarch\u2019s yacht and threatening the people throwing them a life ring\u201d.\n\nThe official said the statement was indicative that Chelsea had not fully appreciated the seriousness of their situation and the complex nature of the licence that is allowing the club to continue to play, and said the government was willing to listen further on spending limits and ensuring some away fans were able to attend.\nThey described it as \u201cgalling\u201d to see Chelsea say they were prepared to damage other supporters at Middlesbrough when several hundred of their fans were able to attend. The source said: \u201cWe are not opposed to Chelsea having fans at games in the long run, but we will not allow money from ticket sales to flow to a sanctioned entity. Chelsea should spend less time worrying about having a few thousand fans at one game, and focus on moving their club into the hands of someone who isn\u2019t linked to a warmonger.\u201d\nThe Chelsea Supporters\u2019 Trust had urged the club to withdraw their request, and Middlesbrough\u2019s chairman, Steve Gibson, told the Telegraph the Premier League team\u2019s move was \u201cabhorrent\u201d and described Chelsea as a \u201crotten football club\u201d. A Boro statement said: \u201cGiven the reasons for these sanctions, for Chelsea to seek to invoke sporting \u2018integrity\u2019 as a reason for the game being played behind closed doors is ironic in the extreme.\u201d\nIn outlining their position Chelsea had said: \u201cIt is with extreme reluctance that we are asking the FA board to direct that the game be played behind closed doors for matters of sporting integrity. Chelsea FC recognises that such an outcome would have a huge impact on Middlesbrough and its supporters, as well as our own fans who have already bought the limited number of tickets that were sold before the licence was imposed, but we believe this is the fairest way of proceeding in the current circumstances.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to discuss the issue of ticket sales with OFSI as there are a number of fixtures still to be played this season and we hope to reach a resolution.\u201d\nChelsea are still lobbying the government to lift the \u00a320,000 cap on travel to away games. They argue it would normally cost three times as much to travel to Middlesbrough and it remains to be seen how Thomas Tuchel and his players will get to the match.\nChelsea\u2019s travel to France for Wednesday\u2019s second leg of their last-16 Champions League tie against Lille is unaffected because it was paid for before sanctions were imposed. Chelsea are 2-0 up.\nNigel Huddleston, the sports minister, said the government did not want to drive Chelsea out of business. \u201cCan the government allow an entity to fail? Yes, it can, whether it\u2019s sport or football or anything else, \u2026 but what we want to do is make sure the impact of sanctions hits those we want them to hit,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not intended to harm other entities or the overall sports ecosystem.\u201d\nChelsea\u2019s licence is designed to keep them in operation until 31 May and the Premier League\u2019s director of policy and corporate affairs, Helen MacNamara, admitted: \u201cWe haven\u2019t worked through the consequences should the club not be sold by 31 May.\u201d"

                    "body": "\n 11.12pm  \n\nDavid Hytner\u2019s match report has arrived from Paris - the technology these days - so I\u2019m going to wrap this blog up. Thanks for your company and emails throughout. Commiserations to Liverpool, but huge congraulations to Real Madrid and the adorable Carlo Ancelotti, the Jeffrey Lebowski of football management.\nFor the second time in a month he has made history, and his team have just completed the greatest European Cup campaign of all time, ever. Goodnight!\n\n\n\nUpdated at 11.47pm BST\n\n\n 11.04pm  \n\nCourtois made nine saves in total. Two stand out: in the first half he pushed Sadio Mane\u2019s fierce shot onto the post, and in the second he made a stunning reaction save - I think with his bicep - to deny Mo Salah.\n\n\n\n\nUpdated at 11.11pm BST\n\n\n 11.01pm  \n\nThe champagne moment\n\n\n\n\n 11.00pm  \n\nEight months is a long time in football\n\n\n\n\n 10.58pm  \n\nReal Madrid have now won the Champions League 14 times. That\u2019s the same as England, two more than Italy and six more than Germany.\n\nSpain 19\nEngland 14\nItaly 12\nGermany 8\nNetherlands 6\nPortugal 4\nFrance, Scotland, Romania, Yugoslavia 1\n\n\n\n\n 10.55pm  \n\n\u201cStrangely,\u201d writes J.A. Hopkin, \u201cLiverpool have failed to score in each of their three finals this season.\u201d \n\n\n\n 10.55pm  \n\n\u201cSorry, Rob strongly disagree,\u201d says Robert Yeoman. \u201cReal were the better team tonight. That was an exemplary European final performance. Ancelotti masterminded a brilliant tactical plan that stopped Liverpool playing the final in the way that suited them best, Yes, Courtois was amazing but keepers aren\u2019t magic. They\u2019re part of a team\u2019s tactics as is the 10 players in front of them then that reduce \u2018the better team\u2019 to attempting to score in a way that the keeper can handle. Liverpool were beaten tonight because they had no answer to how Real set themselves up to win this game. Hats off to them!\u201d\nNot sure I agree with much of that, but I do take your point. And Real\u2019s oft-maligned defence was excellent, Carvajal and Militao in particular.\n\n\n\n 10.53pm  \n\nThe player of the match is Thibaut Courtois. The player of the tournament, though there isn\u2019t an official award, is Karim Benzema. He scored 15 goals, including hat-tricks against PSG and Chelsea and winners against Chelsea (in the second leg) and Manchester City. He probably should have had one tonight as well, but thankfully we won\u2019t be talking about that.\nOne thing we will be talking about for a while is the scenes outside the ground before the game. \n\n\n\n\n 10.51pm  \n\nReal have formed a guard of honour for the Liverpool players, who are collecting their medals. Mo Salah is particularly glassy-eyed. It\u2019s still been an incredible season for Liverpool, but it\u2019ll take a few weeks before they see it like that.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.54pm BST\n\n\n 10.48pm  \n\nHere\u2019s Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s reaction (eyebrow status: jaunty)\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe. I cannot believe. We are really happy. [Spreads arms wide] What can I say? I cannot say more. \n\u201cI am a record man! I had the luck to come here last year and we\u2019ve had a fantastic season. I found a squad, as usual, with a lot of quality and a lot of mental character.\n\u201cWe passed through some really difficult games. The supporters helped us a lot. Tonight, I\u2019m really happy that they are happy.\n\u201c[What about Courtois?] Unbelievable. I tell you, I cannot believe!\u201d\nAnd with that, he strolls off into the night. There\u2019s a cigar with his name on it, and a trophy with Madrid\u2019s.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.52pm BST\n\n\n 10.43pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 10.42pm  \n\nThibaut Courtois\u2019s reaction\n\u201cThank you very much. I said at the press conference yesterday that when Madrid play in finals, they win. I saw a lot of tweets saying I would get humbled. It was the other way round. Today I needed to win a final - for my career, for all the hard work, to put respect on my name because I don\u2019t think I have enough respect, especiallyin England. I saw a lot of criticism that I was not good enough or whatever.\n\u201cI\u2019m just really happy and proud of the performance of the team, and when I needed to be there I was there for the team. We have beaten the best clubs in the world, together with us. Liverpool were very strong today. I think I played a great game and that was the difference.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 10.45pm BST\n\n\n 10.38pm  \n\nIt\u2019s a sore one for Liverpool. Maybe the long season caught up with them, yet they were still the better team tonight: they had 23 attempts at goal to Real\u2019s three. And they lost, because Real Madrid\u2019s name was on the trophy all along.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 12.53am BST\n\n\n 10.36pm  \n\nA month ago, Carlo Ancelotti became the first coach to win the league in each of Europe\u2019s five biggest leagues. Now he is the first coach to win four Champions Leagues. BUT WHAT DOES HE ACTUALLY DO?\n\n\n\n\n 10.35pm  \n\nReal have done it again, and this might be the best of the lot - they\u2019ve beaten Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea, Manchester City and now Liverpool. They had two big heroes tonight: Vinicius Jr, who scored the winner in the second half, and the outstanding Thibaut Courtois.\nLiverpool were the better team without ever really being at their pulsating best, but Courtois made two exceptional saves and a number of good ones. \n\n\n\n 10.32pm  \nREAL MADRID WIN THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FOR THE 14th TIME!\n\nFull time: Liverpool 0-1 Real Madrid\nIt\u2019s Real Madrid\u2019s continent, we just live in it.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 12.36am BST\n\n\n 10.32pm  \n\n90+5 min Fabinho crosses too close to Courtois, and that might be Liverpool\u2019s last chance.\n\n\n\n 10.30pm  \n\n90+3 min Mane\u2019s cross is headed away well by Eder Militao, an often erratic defender who has been almost faultless tonight.\n\n\n\n 10.29pm  \n\n90+3 min: Real substitution Rodrygo replaces the goalscorer Vincius Jr.\n\n\n\n 10.29pm  \n\n90+2 min Camavinga shoots over from 20 yards.\n\n\n\n 10.29pm  \n\n90+1 min Benzema flips a lovely pass to put Dani Ceballos through on goal, but he takes too long and is tackled by Robertson. Real eventually win a corner, over which Kroos takes an age. \n\n\n\n 10.27pm  \n\n90+1 min There will be five minutes of added time.\n\nUpdated at 10.28pm BST\n\n\n 10.26pm  \n\n90 min: Real substitution Dani Ceballos comes on for Luka Modric.\n\n\n\n 10.25pm  \n\n88 min Alexander-Arnold curls it deep, and Courtois comes through the crowd to claim with authority. He has been immense.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.38pm BST\n\n\n 10.24pm  \n\n88 min Mane, back on the left now, runs Camavinga to win a corner...\n\n\n\n 10.24pm  \n\n87 min Alexander-Anrold makes an important tackle on Benzema, who tried to twist away from him in the area.\n\n\n\n 10.22pm  \n\n85 min: Real substitution Eduardo Camavinga replaces Fede Valverde, who made the goal and ran his branded socks off.\n\n\n\n 10.21pm  \n\n84 min Like the man said.\n\n\n\n\n 10.20pm  \n\n83 min Real break dangerously, three on three, only for Benzema to slightly overhit a through pass to Vinicius. \n\n\n\n 10.20pm  \n\n82 min: Magnificent save from Courtois! Salah kills a crossfield pass, scoots past Mendy in the area and pings a right-footed shot that is diverted just wide of the far post by Courtois! That is a wonderful reaction save.\n\n\n\n\nUpdated at 10.30pm BST\n\n\n 10.19pm  \n\n81 min Mane plays in the underlapping Firmino, whose cutback evades everyone at the near post. The ball runs to Keita on the edge of the area, and he wafts it high and wide. That was another decent chance. \nFirmino has made a difference since coming on.\n\nUpdated at 10.19pm BST\n\n\n 10.17pm  \n\n80 min: Good save from Courtois! Make that 20 attempts at goal: Salah\u2019s shot is redirected by Jota, arriving late in the area, and Courtois changes direction to push it behind for a corner.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.24pm BST\n\n\n 10.17pm  \n\n80 min Liverpool have had 19 attempts at goal to Real Madrid\u2019s two. \n\n\n\n 10.15pm  \n\n79 min Liverpool are now playing with Mane and Firmino up front, Salah to the right and Jota to the left. \n\n\n\n 10.15pm  \n\n78 min Alexander-Arnold\u2019s cross is crucially intercepted by Militao. He might have gone for goal as well. \n\n\n\n 10.14pm  \n\n77 min: Double substitution for Liverpool Roberto Firmino and Naby Keita replace Thiago Alcantara and Jordan Henderson, which means a switch to 4-2-4.\n\nUpdated at 10.15pm BST\n\n\n 10.13pm  \n\n76 min Kroos\u2019s long free-kick finds Casemiro in space on the left side of the area. He should go for goal but instead tries to cushion a volley back across the penalty area, and makes a mess of that as well.\n\nUpdated at 10.14pm BST\n\n\n 10.11pm  \n\n74 min Alexander-Arnold whistles a cross shot well wide. The stretching Jota got a slight touch, but not enough to divert it towards goal. Liverpool\u2019s response to the goal has been decent, if slightly impatient at times.\n\nUpdated at 10.12pm BST\n\n\n 10.10pm  \n\n73 min Mendy wins the ball fairly off Alexander-Arnold, who gets up and points angrily at him. Not sure what that was about.\n\n\n\n 10.09pm  \n\n72 min \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be too harsh on Alexander-Arnold,\u201d says K\u00e1ri Tulinius. \u201cThat Valverde assist was both incredibly precise in terms of placement and pace, but it came from a really unlikely source. I think this is only his second assist all season. But if you keep your powder dry, that\u2019s the way to ignite it.\u201d \n\n\n\n 10.08pm  \n\n71 min Modric releases Vinicius, one v one with Konate. Vinicius charges infield and seems to have beaten Konate, who then makes a brilliant recovery tackle on the edge of the area. He\u2019s had a fine game.\n\nUpdated at 10.09pm BST\n\n\n 10.06pm  \n\n69 min: Great save from Courtois! Henderson dumps a high, hanging cross beyond the far post, where Jota does well to loop a header back across goal. Salah scurries onto it, a couple of yards out, but Courtois charges back acrosss his line to block Salah\u2019s shot. \n\n\nUpdated at 10.13pm BST\n\n\n 10.05pm  \n\n69 min Jota wins two corners in quick succession down the left. The second, taken by Robertson, leads to a short game of head tennis before Alaba blooters the ball clear.\n\n\n\n 10.04pm  \n\n67 min Kroos buys a foul from Salah, which eats up another 20 seconds. Every little helps.\n\n\n\n 10.03pm  \n\n66 min \u201cI am currently at a stadium concert in the centre of Istanbul (mor ve \u00f6tesi) which my partner has surprised me with tickets,\u201d says Phil Reed. \u201cI know one of their songs and do not speak Turkish... I am also trying to sneak a view of the score on mbm so thanks for your work Rob! You are saving my life (and relationship) here...\u201d\n\n\n\n 10.02pm  \n\n65 min: Liverpool substition Diogo Jota replaces Luis Diaz, who was handled very well by Dani Carvajal. Mane moves left, Jota goes up front.\n\n\n\n 10.01pm  \n\n64 min Salah cuts inside from the right, 20 yards out, and shapes a curler that is pushed away by the diving Courtois. It was a camera-friendly save, fairly comfortable for a keeper of his class.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.17pm BST\n\n\n 9.59pm  \n\n62 min Fabinho is booked for flattening Valverde.\n\n\n\n 9.59pm  \n\n61 min Vinicius got behind Alexander-Arnold, who will inevitably be criticised for his part in the goal. I\u2019d like to see it a few more times to be sure. My first thought was that the angle of Valverde\u2019s cross shot made it extremely difficult to defend, even if Alexander-Arnold was sleeping a bit.\n\nUpdated at 10.00pm BST\n\n\n 9.57pm  \n\n60 min The goal stands! \n\n\n\n\nUpdated at 10.47pm BST\n\n\n 9.56pm  \n\nValverde was found in space on the right. He cut inside, unchallenged the whole way, and drove a low cross shot that was turned in from close range by Vincius Jr. It\u2019s really close to offside, but I think he\u2019s okay.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.08pm BST\n\n\n 9.55pm  \nGOAL! Liverpool 0-1 Real Madrid (Vinicius Jr 59)\n\nOut of nothing - and a VAR check for offside permitting - Real take the lead!\n\n\nUpdated at 10.05pm BST\n\n\n 9.55pm  \n\n58 min Liverpool appeal for a penalty when Salah\u2019s snapshot hits a Real defender in the area. Nothing to see here. It may have brushed Alaba\u2019s fist, but it was tight to his body.\n\n\n\n 9.53pm  \n\n56 min There\u2019s a break in play while Eder Militao receives treatment. Luis Diaz fell on him accidentally after they wrestled for a 50/50.\n\n\n\n 9.51pm  \n\n54 min Mane forces a pass out to Diaz on the left. He teases Carvajal and then gives the ball back to Mane, whose first-time from the edge of the area is blocked by Militao. Real may have had a goal disallowed in strange circumstances but there\u2019s no doubt Liverpool have been the better team.\n\n\n\n 9.48pm  \n\n52 min It\u2019s been a pretty slow start to the second half, same as the first. Thiago Alcantara still looks fine, and has arguably been the perkiest of Liverpool\u2019s attacking players.\n\nUpdated at 9.48pm BST\n\n\n 9.47pm  \n\n49 min \u201cNot all MBM readers are in exotic places or camper vans,\u201d says Colum Farrelly. \u201cSome of us are in Stansted Airport (for the last 8 hours!) because of a delayed and now cancelled flight home. MBM saves sanity.\u201d\n\n\n\n 9.44pm  \n\n47 min A wonderful first-time cross from Alexander-Arnold just evades Diaz, swooping at the far post. Carvajal did pretty well to put him under pressure from the wrong side, and the ball brushed one of their heads before drifting to safety.\n\n\n\n 9.42pm  \n\n46 min Peep peep! The second half ius under way. The consensus on the disallowed goal is non-existent.\n\n\n\n 9.34pm  \n\nOn BT Sport, former referee Peter Walton says the goal could only have been given if Fabinho was deemed to have deliberately played the ball.\n\n\n\n 9.30pm  \n\nApparently the Madrid goal was ruled out because the ball deflected off Fabinho, and therefore doesn\u2019t count. I\u2019m not making this up by the way; that\u2019s the explanation that has been given. \n\nUpdated at 9.33pm BST\n\n\n 9.26pm  \nHalf time: Liverpool 0-0 Real Madrid\n\nThe kick-off was delayed, and the match still hasn\u2019t really got going. Liverpool were the better team for most of a relatively low-key half. Thibaut Courtois did brilliantly to push Sadio Mane\u2019s shot onto a post, and then Karim Benzema had a goal controversially ruled out for offside. See you in 15 minutes for the second half.\n\n\nUpdated at 9.53pm BST\n\n\n 9.24pm  \n\n45+2 min There will be three minutes of added time, even though the VAR check took about half an hour.\n\n\n\n 9.24pm  \nNO GOAL! Liverpool 0-0 Real Madrid\n\nBenzema was in an offside position when Valverde got a touch, though you could argue that it became a new phase of play after Konate pushed the ball off Fabinho and back towards the Liverpool goal. I thought Benzema\u2019s goal should have been given, though I\u2019ll be honest, I haven\u2019t a clue about the offside law any more. \n\nUpdated at 9.28pm BST\n\n\n 9.23pm  \n\nIt\u2019s still being checked...\n\n\nUpdated at 9.28pm BST\n\n\n 9.22pm  \n\nIt started when Benzema ran onto a long ball forward and turned inside Robertson near the six-yard box. Alisson blocked the goal so Benzema waited and then poked the ball tamely across the area. Alisson pushed it away and then there was a scramble, with Valverde, Konate and Fabinho all touching the ball (in that order, I think) before Benzema swept it into the net.\n\nUpdated at 9.27pm BST\n\n\n 9.21pm  \n\nVAR check! Benzema was definitely offside, because he was in front of the goalkeeper Alisson, but the issue is whether the ball was played through by a Madrid player (Valverde) or a Liverpool defender (Fabinho). If it\u2019s the latter, it\u2019ll be a goal. I think this will be given.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 9.39pm BST\n\n\n 9.20pm  \n\n43 min: Benzema has a goal disallowed for offside!\n\n\n\n 9.19pm  \n\n42 min \u201cI think the 37th minute was your first mention of Modric,\u201d says John Starbuck. \u201cHasn\u2019t he been as usually effective yet?\u201d\nI find MBMs aren\u2019t a great guide to individual performances, certainly not with subtler players like Modric or Xavi. But he has been pretty quiet.\n\n\n\n 9.18pm  \n\n41 min Robertson\u2019s corner is headed away by Benzema to Henderson, 30 yards out, and he whistles a shot well wide. It was beautifully struck but nowhere near the target.\n\n\n\n 9.17pm  \n\n40 min Robertson plays a short pass into Mane in the area. He spins away from Militao, who tracks Mane well and blocks the resulting shot on the stretch. Corner to Liverpool. Mane looks really sharp by the way.\n\n\n\n 9.16pm  \n\n38 min After a very quiet start, Vinicius and Benzema are starting to make mischief on the left wing. It\u2019s not an exciting game but it remains a thoroughly intriguing one.\n\n\n\n 9.13pm  \n\n37 min \u201cIt\u2019s incredible to watch Thiago\u2019s passing, really,\u201d writes Shiladitya Pandit. \u201cThe range, the vision, the elegance on the ball, all while not being at 100%. Being the best playmaker on a pitch that also has Luka Modric on it, is a feat in itself, irrespective of what happens in the game at the end.\u201d\n\n\n\n 9.13pm  \n\n36 min Vincius nutmegs Konate in the area and is about to shoot when Henderson appears on his blind side to poke the ball behind for a corner. Excellent covering.\n\nUpdated at 9.13pm BST\n\n\n 9.12pm  \n\n34 min: Chance for Liverpool! Alexander-Arnold curls in a left-footed cross that is headed straight at Courtois by Salah, 12 yards out. That was a decent chance, though it was alarming how easily he lost Eder Militao. That\u2019s Liverpool\u2019s eighth attempt at goal and their fifth on target. Madrid? Nada. Zilch. Sweet bugger all.\n\n\n\n 9.10pm  \n\n34 min I told you right from the off this wouldn\u2019t be a classic.\n\n\n\n 9.09pm  \n\n33 min Real are coming into the game a little more. Benzema drops off and tries to thread a pass through to Vincius Jr, but van Dijk steps across to do the necessary.\n\n\n\n 9.08pm  \n\n32 min Astonishingly, it seems people are still being teargassed outside the ground.\n\n\n\n\n 9.07pm  \n\n30 min Kroos\u2019s dangerous long pass is crucially intercepted by the stretching Alexander-Arnold. Vinicius had got the wrong side of him and would have been through on goal.\n\n\n\n 9.07pm  \n\n30 min Here\u2019s more on the problems outside the stadium that led to the kick off being delayed by 37 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n 9.06pm  \n\n29 min Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s eyebrow is on the move. Status: mildly befuddled.\n\n\nUpdated at 9.21pm BST\n\n\n 9.05pm  \n\n28 min \u201cStrange to think of it this way,\u201d says Hugh Molly, \u201cbut that Mane shot would have beaten any other human on the planet. Not Courtois.\u201d\nHe\u2019s definitely the unsung hero of this Real Madrid campaign \u2013 he has made an absurd number of saves throughout the competition. I think it\u2019s something like 54 saves to Alisson\u2019s 15. If Real win tonight, he should get a medal.\n\n\n\n 9.03pm  \n\n26 min Diaz has a run at Carvajal, who holds him up well and then wins a throw-in. \n\n\n\n 9.02pm  \n\n26 min Real enjoy their first extended, unmolested spell of possesion. Eventually Vinicius overhits a cross that is grabbed the backpedalling Alisson.\n\n\n\n 9.02pm  \n\n25 min \u201cIs it me or is the camerawork a bit bizarre?\u201d writes my colleague Tim de Lisle. \u201cThe view is so distant, except when it\u2019s a tight close-up. It feels as if there are two directors and they\u2019re not talking to each other.\u201d\nI think I saw that film at the Curzon Soho. I hadn\u2019t really noticed the camerawork, though a few of you have mentioned it and I see what you mean now.\n\nUpdated at 9.03pm BST\n\n\n 9.00pm  \n\n23 min Real can\u2019t cope with Liverpool\u2019s intensity. I suppose we said the same in the Chelsea and City ties, and look what happened there, but at the moment Liverpool are well on top.\n\n\nUpdated at 9.49pm BST\n\n\n 8.59pm  \n\n21 min: Mane hits the post! Thiago slides a typical disguised pass into Mane on the edge of the area. He zips inside Eder Militao and whacks a shot that is pushed onto the inside of the post by the diving Courtois before rebounding to safety. That\u2019s a marvellous save!\n\n\n\nUpdated at 9.16pm BST\n\n\n 8.56pm  \n\n19 min Now Alexander-Arnold shoots over from the edge of the area after a layoff from Salah. Real haven\u2019t got going at all.\n\n\n\n 8.54pm  \n\n18 min Mane lays the ball off nicely to Salah, whose rising half-volley from 18 yards is pushed down by Courtois and claimed at the second attempt. Liverpool are well on top now.\n\nUpdated at 8.55pm BST\n\n\n 8.54pm  \n\n16 min: Good save from Courtois! A deep crossfield pass is headed back by Henderson to Alexander-Arnold on the right corner of the box. He wriggles away from Vinicius and Mendy before sliding a low cross that is turned towards goal by the off balance Salah, six yards out. Courtois gets down smartly to his left to save.\n\nLiverpool keep the pressure on. Diaz has a shot blocked and then Thiago\u2019s long-range curler is too close to Courtois.\n\nUpdated at 9.18pm BST\n\n\n 8.52pm  \n\n15 min Vinicius has his first run at Konate, who calmly pokes the ball away and then muscles Vinicius away from the loose ball. Superb defending, exactly the kind of thing he was picked for.\n\n\n\n 8.50pm  \n\n13 min Still nothing to report. Liverpool have been the better side, though they are not playing with their usual intensity. \n\n\nUpdated at 9.01pm BST\n\n\n 8.46pm  \n\n9 min Nothing much is happening. The atmosphere is subdued, the tempo fairly slow. It needs a chance at one end or another to get everyone going.\n\n\n\n 8.44pm  \n\n7 min Thiago looks okay, since you asked, but Sadio Mane is limping after a strong challenge by Casemiro.\n\n\n\n 8.42pm  \n\n5 min It\u2019s been a fairly slow start. That might be down to the delayed kick-off, with both teams - Madrid especially - trying to find their bearings.\n\n\n\n 8.41pm  \n\n4 min \u201cThe legs in that Real midfield\u2026\u201d says Ruth Purdue. \u201cIt didn\u2019t work against City so I worry for them. Need the excellent Camavinga in it. He changed the game.\u201d\n\n\n\n 8.40pm  \n\n3 min An early free-kick for Liverpool on the left. Alexander-Arnold curls it in and Benzema clears. Liverpool have started on the front foot. \n\n\n\n 8.37pm  \n\n1 min Peep peep! At 9.37pm local time, Liverpool get the Champions League final under way.\n\n\n\n 8.33pm  \n\nThe players are walking onto the field, so the game is about to start. Here\u2019s a reminder of the teams.\nLiverpool (4-3-3) Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Konate, van Dijk, Robertson; Henderson, Fabinho, Thiago; Salah, Mane, Diaz.Substitutes: Kelleher, Milner, Keita, Firmino, Gomez, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Jones, Minamino, Jota, Tsimikas, Matip, Elliott.\nReal Madrid (4-3-3) Courtois; Carvajal, Eder Militao, Alaba, Mendy; Kroos, Casemiro, Modric; Valverde, Benzema, Vinicius Jr.Substitutes: Lunin, Hazard, Nacho, Asensio, Marcelo, Lucas Vazquez, Bale, Dani Ceballos, Rodrygo, Camavinga, Isco, Mariano.\nReferee Clement Turpin (France).\n\n\n\nUpdated at 9.00pm BST\n\n\n 8.32pm  \n\nThiago starts for Liverpool. His injury scare feels an age ago. Now, sorry to say, there\u2019s a far bigger story emerging.\n\n\n\n\n 8.32pm  \n\nThanks for all your emails. I\u2019m trying to read as many as possible, though there\u2019s all sorts going on.\n\n\n\n 8.31pm  \n\nThe kick-off has been delayed again. I know this because it\u2019s 8.30pm, and there are no footballers on the field. I think it\u2019s going to start in the next few minutes, even though it sounds like there are still thousands of fans outside the ground. \n\n\nUpdated at 8.38pm BST\n\n\n 8.30pm  \n\n \u201cI\u2019m watching it in a very quiet neighbourhood bistro in Paris,\u201d writes Helena Horton, \u201cmainly full of nice local couples having steak frites and little plates of dried sausage save for a deliriously drunk group of about eight Liverpool supporters all hugging each other and shouting \u2018go on boys\u2019 at various intervals - and I think so pleasantly pissed they don\u2019t realise how at odds they are with the atmosphere. However the people here are looking on with fond amusement! It\u2019s being shown on a small screen near the bar. I\u2019m sat nearby eating a giant profiterole.\u201d \n\n\n\n 8.29pm  \n\nMeanwhile, in the year 2022\n\n\n\n\n 8.28pm  \n\n\u201cAfter a poor night\u2019s sleep I still got up at 6.45am ready to watch game in cold Christchurch NZ,\u201d writes Emma Daly. \u201cMy first thought was I could have had an extra half hour in bed. But now I am increasingly worried for the Liverpool fans outside the stadium. This is not okay. No kick off until all those fans are safe please.\u201d\nUefa couldn\u2019t give a solitary toss. The European Championship final last summer started on time despite a complete free-for-all inside and outside the stadium.\n\n\n\n 8.26pm  \n\nThis is scandalous. Meanwhile, the opening ceremony is taking place on thep itch as if nothing has happened. This is all a bit surreal, and I can\u2019t believe the game is about to start with so many fans still stuck outside.\n\n\n\n\n 8.19pm  \n\nThere are still thousands of empty seats in the Liverpool end, and we\u2019re only 11 minutes away from the planned kick-off. \n\n\nUpdated at 8.23pm BST\n\n\n 8.17pm  \n\n\u201cA Champions League final at 3am is already a tall order,\u201d says Conor Gannon. \u201c3:30 is a low blow.\u201d \nI had no idea you lived in Arizona.\n\nUpdated at 8.18pm BST\n\n\n 8.17pm  \n\n\n\nUpdated at 8.36pm BST\n\n\n 8.15pm  \n\nThe misinformation has already started\n\n\n\n\n 8.14pm  \n\n\u201cMade it,\u201d says Steve Horne (19:53). \u201cIt has four screens. Only problem is likely to be the cost of my wife\u2019s mojitos.\u201d \nPretty good of them to put on free beer for the Champions League final.\n\n\n\n 8.09pm  \nKick off delayed by a further 15 minutes\n\nThe match will now begin, all being well, at 9.30pm local time, 8.30pm BST. Uefa are now saying the delay is for \u201csecurity reasons\u201d rather than blaming it on the supporters as they did when the first delay was announced.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.14pm BST\n\n\n 8.08pm  \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve just arrived at Lake Atitlan in Guatemala for a weekend break,\u201d writes Tobias Peggs. \u201cThe whole journey here from Guatemala City was through myriad towns and villages with seemingly everyone wearing Real Madrid or Liverpool shirts. The whole country seems obsessed. And my hotel\u2026 which we\u2019ve just arrived at\u2026 doesn\u2019t have a TV! So here\u2019s my view while I\u2019m trying to get a dodgy live stream on the internet. Hard to complain.\u201d\nI can\u2019t upload Tobias\u2019s picture, for reasons too boring to explain, but I can confirm that his view is a whole lot better than mine. And yours. \n\n\n\n 8.07pm  \n\nThe Liverpool players are coming out to warm up again. Spoiler alert: this isn\u2019t kicking off at 8.15pm.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.39pm BST\n\n\n 8.03pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 8.00pm  \n\n\u201cWell,\u201d muses our resident Liverpool supporter Matt Dony. \u201cThis is it. The end of a ridiculous season. No matter what happens, it\u2019s been a ride. I\u2019m not generally a confident person when it comes to big games. And this is pretty much as big as it gets. (Last week wasn\u2019t ever really on. Wasn\u2019t that big a game really\u2026) \n\u201cThis Liverpool is a better team than This Madrid. But This Madrid have had an equally ridiculous march through the knockout games. They\u2019ve been the best team for about 30 minutes across six matches. But it was the right 30 minutes. Almost feels like they\u2019re fated to win. Almost. But not quite. I\u2019m not confident. But, anything can happen. And this Liverpool team are amazing. There is very little they can\u2019t do. Hoping for a good game. But I\u2019d also take a rubbish game and a Liverpool win. My nerves are in shreds. Argh, and there\u2019s a delay!! That\u2019s not helping!!\u201d\nIn the nicest possible way, you\u2019re all over the show aren\u2019t you? \n\n\n\n 7.59pm  \n\nThat 8.15pm BST kick off is looking very optimistic. There\u2019s a serious issue brewing here - BT Sport are reporting that Liverpool fans have been teargassed outside the stadium. Dear me, what a mess.\n\n\nUpdated at 7.59pm BST\n\n\n 7.56pm  \n\nIt sounds like there are big issues outside the ground: gates closed, fans unable to get in, other supporters entering without tickets. It doesn\u2019t help that Uefa are blaming it on fans arriving late, which has gone down as well as you\u2019d expect.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 8.01pm BST\n\n\n 7.53pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 7.53pm  \n\n\u201cI\u2019m in a campervan in a car park in Bremen and can barely contain my excitement,\u201d says Steve Horne. \u201cWaiting for the rain to ease so I can make a dash to the only bar within striking distance. Hopefully it\u2019s showing the game.\u201d\nYou didn\u2019t think to check earlier?! Good luck, hope they have it on. You have an extra 15 minutes now for the rain to stop.\n\n\n\n 7.53pm  \n\n \u201cJurgen Klopp talked about the newly laid pitch at the Stade de France,\u201d says Peter Oh, \u201cbut to be honest the surfaces I\u2019m most worried about are the outside of Luka Modric\u2019s right boot and the top of Karim Benzema\u2019s forehead.\u201d\n\n\n\n 7.52pm  \n\nAs the kick-off has been delayed, why not calm the nerves by listening to this old charmer.\n\n\n\n\n 7.50pm  \nKick off delayed by 15 minutes\n\nIt sounds like there is chaos outside the ground, and the match will now begin at 9.15pm local time. Here\u2019s more from the news wires.\n\nA lack of organisation meant there were shambolic scenes outside the Stade de France.\nLong queues formed and the Liverpool end was noticeably patchy less than half an hour before kick-off as supporters struggled to get in.\nA few ticketless fans were seen trying to gain access to the Stade de France, despite a permanent fence being in place around the perimeter.\nHuge queues of Liverpool fans have formed outside the Stade de France in Paris ahead of the Champions League final.\nLong queues began to form due to delays in searches at the gates, with many supporters likely to miss kick off. \n\n\n\n\n 7.48pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 7.48pm  \n\nThiago has just had a long chat with Naby Keita. At first I assumed Thiago was pulling out through injury, but now it seems more likely that he was telling Keita to be ready to come on as a substitute from the first whistle.\n\n\n\n 7.45pm  \n\nThis season, the football world has woken up to what the people of Madrid realised years ago: that Karim Benzema is a genius.\n\n\n\n\n 7.45pm  \n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m doing my maths (as you might say) right, it will be 1am in Bangladesh and Kyrgyzstan at kickoff,\u201d says Joe Pearson. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d\nYes, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a Coen brothers film called Raising Dhaka.\n\n\n\n 7.43pm  \n\nDon McRae interviewing Trent Alexander-Arnold was always going to be great. If you only have time to read one preview piece, make it this one. The bits about Alexander-Arnold\u2019s role are especially fascinating, and his lack of false modesty rather refreshing.\n\n\n\n\n 7.43pm  \n\nMeet the Madrid cavalry\n\n\n\n\n\n 7.43pm  \n\nAnother plug for Jonathan Wilson\u2019s tactical preview\n\n\n\n\n 7.41pm  \n\nJurgen Klopp speaks\n\u201cIt\u2019s the comeback kings against the mentality monsters \u2013 nice headline.\n\u201cThe pitch is \u2026 okay. It\u2019s not a great pitch but it\u2019s absolutely okay. \n\u201cWe expect a very strong side: vary calm, very experienced, very cool, but we\u2019ll try to give them a bit of pain.\n\n\n\n 7.34pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 7.33pm  \n\nLiverpool and Real met in the 2018 final in Kyiv, when Gareth Bale (and poor Lorus Karius) gave Real a 3-1 win. Both teams have evolved since then, and Liverpool have five changes from the XI that started that game.\nOut Karius, Dejan Lovren, Gini Wijnaldum, James Milner, Roberto Firmino.\nIn Alisson, Ibrahima Konate, Thiago Alcantara, Fabinho, Luis Diaz.\n\n\n\n\n 7.32pm  \n\nLiverpool v Real Madrid: a brief history\n\n\n\n\n 7.31pm  \n\nThiago, who was injured before the Carabao Cup final, may be heading for more heartbreak. He is jogging on his own, with Naby Keita warming up with the rest of the starting XI. It\u2019ll be desperately cruel if Thiago misses out again.\n\n\n\n 7.28pm  \n\n\u201cI know you were joking,\u201d says Joe Pearson, \u201cbut your readers should know that it will be noon in Arizona at kickoff. Just trying to be helpful.\u201d\nI actually wasn\u2019t joking, I just had the first of tonight\u2019s myriad brainfades. 1am?!\n\nUpdated at 7.28pm BST\n\n\n 7.28pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 7.27pm  \n\n\u201cIf Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s eyebrow is going to go arch-shaped today, I can\u2019t think of a better place than the city known for the Arc de ... No, please, not another Real Madrid Triomphe!\u201d weeps Peter Oh. \u201cMay the merengues be forever stuck at unlucky number 13! YNWA!\u201d\n\n\n\n 7.25pm  \n\nAnother plug for Barney Ronay\u2019s preview\n\n\n\n\n 7.07pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 7.07pm  \n\n\u201cThanks, Michael Smith,\u201d writes Simon McMahon. \u201cI kept Peter Cormack off my list because I though he was too niche, forgetting of course that this is the MBM. He led Cowdenbeath to promotion as manager in his only season in charge of the Blue Brazil, so I\u2019m pretty sure this is the only email that will mention both 1978 Anglo-Scottish Cup winners Bristol City and the now Scottish Lowland League side in a Champions League final live blog.\u201d\n\n\n\n 7.05pm  \n\nA grown man\n\n\n\n\n 7.01pm  \n\nIf Real win tonight, Carlo Ancelotti will become the first manager in history to win four Champions Leagues.

But here are two giant clubs, who play fun football, with nary a sh1thouse in sight. I guess I\u2019ll just let the narrative of the match pull my affections to and fro. Enjoy the match!\u201d\n\n\n\n 6.53pm  \n\nNostalgia corner\n\nWhat\u2019s [Gerd] M\u00fcller doing? Nothing. What\u2019s M\u00fcller doing? Still nothing. M\u00fcller? Nothing. Wait.

Fabinho has also made it, and Ibrahima Konate is preferred to Joel Matip as the right-sided centre-back. \nLiverpool (4-3-3) Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Konate, van Dijk, Robertson; Henderson, Fabinho, Thiago; Salah, Mane, Diaz.Substitutes: Kelleher, Milner, Keita, Firmino, Gomez, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Jones, Minamino, Jota, Tsimikas, Matip, Elliott.\n\n\nUpdated at 6.58pm BST\n\n\n 6.45pm  \n\n\u201cAlways put one in the brain, indeed; sage advice from the Coens\u2019 Miller\u2019s Crossing,\u201d says Charles Antaki of the gratuitous Johnny Caspar reference in the preamble. \u201cBut perhaps there are one or two other apt titles tonight: The Man Who Wasn\u2019t There (if Thiago doesn\u2019t make it), No Country for Old Men (if Kroos\u2019 and Modric\u2019s age catches up with them) and of course True Grit (and possibly Intolerable Cruelty) if it goes to extra-time and penalties.\u201d\nDon\u2019t forget Raising Arizona: I think it kicks off at 1am there.\n\n\n\n 6.42pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 6.38pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 6.35pm  \n\nYou can\u2019t be no one else\n\n\n\n\n 6.35pm  \n\n\u201cLook,\u201d says Michael Smith, \u201cI\u2019m neither Scottish nor a Liverpool fan but I have to add the forgotten man Peter Cormack to Simon McMahon\u2019s list (18:16). Yes they all won lots of stuff but only Peter added the Anglo-Scottish Cup to his honours (with my team Bristol City since you ask).

Some way to watch the game: \u2018Just announced over the p.a. that the ship has received confirmation that they can broadcast the game tonite at 7:30pm. We will be off the north coast of Scotland heading to Invergordon - it will be on the big screen under the stars, in the casino TVs and in our stateroom TVs as well. Think I\u2019ll bundle up and watch it on deck on my favourite bar stool. Should be an experience!\u2019\u201d \n\n\n\n 6.05pm  \n\n\u201cHow much do you think missing out on the league title last weekend will affect Liverpool tonight?\u201d wonders David Wall. \u201cGiven how poorly they started against Wolves (who could have been out of sight if they\u2019d been able to finish their first-half chances) it seemed that Everton\u2019s win the Thursday before, ruling out the quintuple (four trophies plus Everton being relegated), was playing on their minds. Now the quadruple is also ruled out, might that affect them too?\u201d\nI don\u2019t see it having a negative impact, but I think it will have less of a positive impact, if that makes sense. If Liverpool were going for the Quadruple tonight, I think they\u2019d be close to unstoppable.\n\n\n\n 5.46pm  \n\nSome games are bigger than others\n\n\n\n\n 5.42pm  \n\nJonathan Wilson\u2019s tactical preview\n\n\n\n\n 5.25pm  \n\nWhen you\u2019ve gotta go, you\u2019ve gotta go\n\n\n\n\n 5.00pm  \n\nEarly team news\nThere are two big decisions for Jurgen Klopp - whether to risk Thiago in midfield (all reports suggests Fabinho will be okay to return) and whether to go with the pace of Ibrahima Konate or the nous and ball-playing ability of Joel Matip at centre-back. If Thiago doesn\u2019t make it, James Milner, 36, looks a good bet to take on Madrid\u2019s midfield geriatricos. \n* If indeed it is - both teams can use five subs, so it doesn\u2019t matter too much if Thiago\u2019s achilles goes in the first five minutes.\nCarlo Ancelotti\u2019s team looks easy to predict. His only decision is on the right wing, where the industrious Fede Valverde is likely to be preferred to Rodrygo. Two reasons for that: Valverde gives extra protection in midfield - he\u2019s very good in the Ray Parlour role, as it should be known - and Rodrygo has made a devastating impact from the bench in this season\u2019s competition.\nPossible XIs\nLiverpool (4-3-3) Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Konate, van Dijk, Robertson; Henderson, Fabinho, Thiago; Salah, Mane, Diaz.\nReal Madrid (4-3-3) Courtois; Carvajal, Eder Militao, Alaba, Mendy; Kroos, Casemiro, Modric; Valverde, Benzema, Vinicius Jr.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.46pm BST\n\n\n 5.00pm  \nPreamble\n\nHello and welcome to live coverage of Europe\u2019s biggest custody battle. The identities of Liverpool and Real Madrid are inextricably linked to the Champions League, and both clubs feel a kind of moral ownership of that giant trophy. Tonight one of them will lift it again, and the other will be left to wrestle with a bit of the old cognitive dissonance as they walk straight past it on the podium. \nBoth clubs have an intimidating sense of destiny at the business end of the Champions League. This season it\u2019s even more powerful: Real because of their form in this competition, Liverpool because of their form in every competition. Defeat in a Champions League final is always unthinkable for these two. In 2021-22, it\u2019s a concept they barely understand.\nReal, in particular, simply don\u2019t lose Champions League finals: just three out of 16, the last in 1981, when they were beaten by\u2026 yep, Liverpool, in Paris. Liverpool\u2019s most recent defeat in the final was also against tonight\u2019s opponents, an emotional night in Kyiv four years ago that took out a lease in Mo Salah\u2019s subconscious. Since Jurgen Klopp came to Anfield, Liverpool have only been knocked out of the Champions League by teams whose name ends in \u2018Madrid\u2019. I\u2019m going to stick my neck out and say that will still be the case after this game.\nThat\u2019s just about the only sure thing. Usually, we have a rough idea - or at least we think we do - of how a big game might pan out. Ahead of this game, there is nary a scooby. That\u2019s mainly because of a Madrid side who have cheerily defenestrated logic all season. It\u2019s only a slight exaggeration to say that Liverpool could feasibly win 5-0 or Real 7-3. \nIf Liverpool take control of this game, they need to remember Johnny Caspar\u2019s advice: always put one in the brain (NB: link is from an 18-rated film). Madrid have come back from the dead in every round, culminating in their unfathomable defeat of Manchester City in the semi-finals. Liverpool, by contrast \u2013 and there are a lot of contrasts tonight \u2013 haven\u2019t been behind in a knockout tie. The moral of this story will become apparent around 11pm when the victors start writing the history of the 2021-22 Champions League. If Madrid win, they can claim this as the greatest European campaign since GOATs began. \nThree weeks ago, Liverpool were strongish favourites for this match, but their legs and muscles have started showing the strain of a uniquely demanding season. Real have had their feet up for the last 24 days. You can argue it either way: that Liverpool are too tired or that Madrid are too battle-softened. \nEven the individual duel that everyone is talking about, Vinicius Jr v Trent Alexander-Arnold, is more complicated than the usual story of attacker v defender or midfielder v midfielder. Vinicius could be the matchwinner, as he was when Real beat Liverpool in the quarter-final last year. But then so could Alexander-Arnold, who plays like no right-back in football history.\nThere are a gazillion points of interest, but in the name of brevity we\u2019ll settle for a few. Whether Real can do the same Hulk Hogan homage in the Stade de France as they have in the heady atmosphere of the Bernabeu; whether Thiago Alcantara is fit to start and, if not, whether Jurgen Klopp risks Naby Keita after his minor shocker against Madrid last season; how many times Luis Diaz and Karim Benzema will leave us agape; and the contrast in styles, between Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s free jazz and Jurgen Klopp\u2019s heavy metal.\nMadrid are chasing a record-extending 14th Champions League. Never mind other clubs: no country other than Spain (duh) has won more than that. For Liverpool it would be No7, moving them joint second with AC Milan and \u2013 this stuff matters, let\u2019s not pretend it doesn\u2019t \u2013 four clear of Manchester United. Oh, and seven clear of Manchester City. It would also complete a deluxe version of the treble they did under Gerard Houllier in 2000-01.\nThe modern Champions League is as good as football gets, maybe as good it has ever gotten, but in recent years the greatest drama has been reserved for the quarters and semis. Most of the finals have been either a bit dull or a bit one-sided. This, please, is going to be different. \nKick off 8pm in Liverpool, 9pm in Paris and Madrid.\n\nUpdated at 7.32pm BST\n\n\n 5.00pm  \n\n\n\nUpdated at 5.43pm BST\n"
