                    "body": "  8.53am    I want to say a huge thank you to all of you for joining me, not only for this final but for all the matches at this World Cup. Women\u2019s rugby has always had these rivalries, fantastic talent and inspiring stories and now it finally has been given the platform it deserves. What a final eh?! It was tense and it went down to the wire. For all the action, Rob Kitson\u2019s report is below. England\u2019s women\u2019s club tournament, the Premier 15s, starts next weekend, get to a game if you can.      8.46am    The team filter through with their glittering medals, they line up and Demant and Simon are likely to lift this together as co-captains. Eden Park are chanting \u2018Black Ferns\u2019, to see this with women\u2019s rugby is so emotional. The impact of this tournament is huge. But now we look to the trophy and they raise it into the air which is met with a thunderous roar. Wow, wow, wow! What a moment. History is made.     8.43am    The crowd have stayed to see their side pick up their medals, what a special moment for these girls! The noise is deafening and this will stay with them forever. It\u2019s so good to see Woodman okay to pick up her winner medal too.     8.42am    England have their runner-up medals, the hurt on the faces is just so cutting. Whoever won this, the runners-up would be gutted \u2013 sadly for Simon Middleton\u2019s side they are the losers. Middleton collects his medal and he looks so gutted, the work he has done with England is immense though. I hope he remains for 2025.     8.40am    Sarah Hunter has used the heartbreak of 2017, losing to New Zealand in the final, to get her to this point. She said ahead of the tournament that this is her final World Cup but will she be tempted by 2025 now?     8.38am    France are getting their bronze medals and England will follow with their runner-up medals.      8.37am    England captain Sarah Hunter told ITV: \u201cI\u2019m gutted. So proud of the team. We came out fighting, we had our backs against the wall but we never gave up. WE kept coming out. We said in the circle one result does not define who we are as a squad or as people. \u201cSport is cruel, it doesn\u2019t always end the way you want to. Credit to New Zealand, they kept coming. \u201cRegardless of the result if we left everything on the pitch we can be proud and we have done that.\u201d     8.35am    What are you all thinking? Let me know! Email or Twitter.     8.33am    New Zealand captain Demant said: \u201cI can\u2019t even put it into words. All I can say is thank you and I am so proud of our team. It\u2019s been really challenging, most people don\u2019t even know when we went north we got pumped. The way the players have turned themselves around, there is so many things that are unseen. So many players who have got us here who aren\u2019t in the team right now. \u201cIt has been so overwhleming. We aren\u2019t used to so many fans. We hope we have made our country proud. We hope we have inspired the next generation. \u201cI want to say a massive [thank you] to Sarah and her team. Massive congratulations to them, 30 wins in a row, I hope they celebrate tonight too.\u201d     8.31am    I believe Simon Middleton\u2019s contract comes to an end after this World Cup and there were questions on whether he would re-sign for 2025. I think he will now, it\u2019s a home World Cup too.     8.29am    England\u2019s winning run comes to an end, they had 30 matches on the bounce. But that has come tumbling down. You can take nothing away from New Zealand, they were really good and it is worth noting New Zealand scored the winning try with both sides down to 14. As an England fan I am devastated but you cannot help but smile for the Black Ferns with a jumping Eden Park.      8.27am    The reaction from both sides just show how tough this final was. What an incredible performance from England after they went down to 14 after 20 minutes. But in the end New Zealand rallied their first half nerves, the clinicism came into their game \u2013 especially with that final line-out.     8.26am   Full-time: New Zealand 34-31 England  What an ending. What a match. New Zealand celebrate wildly, England in floods of tears.      8.25am    80 min: New Zealand have stolen the line-out and they win the penalty! NEW ZEALAND WIN.     8.24am    80 min: England have the penalty again! What is going to happen. I am in floods of tears. Back we come to the pen, they\u2019ll kick to corner again.     8.23am    79 min: Dow is back on after passing her HIA, New Zealand bring down England\u2019s maul legally. This is surely their last shot here. They are going through the phases here, my heart is thumping! England have the penalty, what will they do here? They kick to the corner. BIG CALL!!     8.21am    77 min: New Zealand win the ball at the breakdown and surely that is that. Never say never but I think the hosts have this. Demant went to kick that but she tapped the penalty and they are in the attack \u2013 an error though as England win the penalty! Oh my, oh my! I can\u2019t take this.     8.20am    76 min: Muir is on for Cornborough and Tubic, who is on for Fluhler, kicks away. England have the line-out, this could be their last chance to throw a punch and they lose the line-out! The first they have lost and it comes just after Davies comes on for Cokayne. England have it now though with a clean Kildunne catch, England have the advnatage too.      8.18am    74 min: Jeeeeez, who will win this?? The final has lived up to the hype. Huge.     8.15am   TRY! New Zealand 34-31 England (Leti-I\u2019iga, 73')  The NZ line-out is good and England have to put in a great defensive effort here. Kabeya makes a rare miss tackle and they hosts keep coming. They are so fast, Fluhler\u2019s offload is amazing. Fluhler has hurt herself in that and she is off \u2013 a standing ovation for her. So emotional. Holmes misses it! The gap is three.  Updated at 8.17am GMT    8.14am    71 min: The replay shows Demant did not touch that, it looks like it skims her arm \u2013 that is so so close! They have reversed it. Cleall is remaining on.     8.13am    71 min: There\u2019s a loose pass from New Zealand and with their attack stalling Holmes kicks ahead, she almost finds her teammate but it is out of play. England to have the line-out and it is sloppy but England have it. Both sides are fighting so hard. Harrison kicks away but it was touched by Demant and England have the line-out. Cleall is receiving some treatment here so there\u2019s a break in play.     8.11am    69 min: Demant kicks and New Zealand have the line-out. It is clean and they employ the driving maul. Cocksedge kicks away and MacDonald does really well to collect that, England on the attack now but they will do so from deep. Harrison kicks away and now New Zealand come again. I\u2019M SO NERVOUS.     8.09am    67 min: Dow is coming off for a HIA and Heard is on. Bern remains on.     8.08am    67 min: New Zealand turn it over at the breakdown, Ward again giving away the penalty there. Time is off again as Bern receives treatment.     8.08am    67 min: We are back underway and England have the line-out, the driving maul gets them a few metres but New Zealand do really well to bring it down legally. They are running it now, they will have to get some points if they want to feel more secure in this.     8.06am    65 min: Surprisingly Dow is not off for a HIA     8.06am   YELLOW CARD! New Zealand 29-31 England (Simon, 65)  Mitigating factor is the initial contact is on the shoulder. Both teams have 14. Ahhhh, Dow is back to her feet. Think she\u2019ll have a HIA.     8.04am    65 min: I think this will be at least a yellow.     8.04am    65 min: It\u2019s a clean scrum from both sides and New Zealand come away with it. They kick away and Dow runs it from their own 22, the winger is down here and in pain. We head to the TMO \u2013 is there another card?     8.03am    65 min: England have the scrum and they are marching, a great set piece from the visitors. They have walked it to halfway and now they decide to pass it out. I feel sick. Ward\u2019s pass is loose and Bern knocks on. All that hard work and now New Zealand have the scrum. Ngan-Woo is on for Roos.     8.02am    63 min: England are 17 minutes away from winning this final but New Zealand are throwing absolutely everything at them. This is a huge testament for the game, I was worried the final could fall apart after the red but it has stayed exciting. Rule is off and Taumata is on.     8.00am    63 min: England are doing so well to defend but New Zealand are moving closer to the line but England turn it over! Another New Zealand\u2019s Rule us down injured here, there\u2019s a break in play.     7.59am    62 min: New Zealand kick it away and Kildunne does well to run it from her own 22. A New Zealand player is down, I\u2019m unsure who yet. Harrison kicks it out on the full though and the hosts have the line-out in their 22. New Zealand\u2019s line-out is loose but they get it back as Matthews knocks on. How are the players coping? I am a bag of nerves.     7.57am    60 min: England have the line-out and it is clean but Ward is under pressure and New Zealand win it on the floor. Jeez Louise. I am so nervous!!!     7.56am    59 min: England have the scrum after that knock on. They come away with it and have the advantage, the celebrations from the subsequent penalty is huge! Every metre and anything gained is hugely celebrated. What a performance. This could still go either way.     7.54am    58 min: We are back underway and Murray is okay to stay on.     7.53am    58 min: There is a break in play as Murray receives treatment.     7.52am    58 min: England looked as though they had turned it over but they knock on! New Zealand have the advantage but they are still with the ball. England turn it over and Harrison kicks, New Zealand knock on! Wow.     7.51am    56 min: Hunter is shouting and jumping around for that, the captain is loving it from the sidelines. New Zealand have it now and they are looking to regain their lead.     7.49am   TRY! New Zealand 29-31 England (Cokayne, 55')  And that\u2019s the hooker\u2019s hat-trick! The celebrations show what that mean! Oh my word this final is breathless. Scarratt misses the extras.   Updated at 7.56am GMT    7.48am    54 min: England win a scrum penalty and they opt for another scrum. They win another scrum penalty and they kick to the corner. The driving maul? I think so.     7.47am    52 min: England make some changes with Kabeya coming on for M Packer and MacDonald is on for L Packer. New Zealand bring on Simon for McMenanin. I am so nervous.     7.44am   TRY! New Zealand 29-26 England (Murray, 50')  They employ the driving maul and England give away the penalty. New Zealand come again but the driving maul is down, they will have to run this. Murray powers over and New Zealand are ahead for the first time. Holmes misses the kick.   Updated at 7.55am GMT    7.42am    48 min: New Zealand make replacements Love is off for Murray and Ponsonby is off for Connor. England come away with the ball and they will play from halfway. They kick cross field but New Zealand come away with it, they kicked and that is sublime from Cocksedge! It is a 50:22, they have the line-out.     7.40am    47 min: New Zealand get it back and kick away and Kildunne does well not to touch it as it bounced around. England have the line-out and it is clean. They are picking away at this and Scarratt kicks away. Holmes come s away with it but they knock on through Fluhler. An England scrum to come! Oh wow, this game!     7.38am    45 min: Finn has got in touch via email, saying: \u201cWow, this game is just outrageous. I think bringing Cleall on will change the game but it is going to be tough for the Red Roses no matter what.\u201d You are not wrong! Back to the match and England have the scrum and they come away with it.     7.37am    44 min: New Zealand are in possession once more and they are on the attack. They smell blood. Scarratt wins the penalty at the breakdown to relieve some pressure. There\u2019s a break in play as Cornborough receives treatment.     7.34am   TRY! New Zealand 24-26 England (Fluhler, 41')  Wow!! New Zealand have a great start and there\u2019s great play between Fluhler and Holmes, the ball comes back in for Fluhler who goes over. Holmes misses the extras.   Updated at 7.54am GMT    7.33am   Back underway! New Zealand 19-26 England  We are back for the second half, can England hold on? Or will the hosts win this? I\u2019m so TENSE! England have made a change with Cleall on for Hunter.     7.30am    Have my nerves settled? Absolutely not! How are you feeling? Let me know!     7.25am    Before kick-off and 17 minutes in I was convinced England were going to win this. But now I am unsure. They have done well so far with 14 players but can they keep this up? I\u2019m not sure.     7.21am    It is spirited performance from England who went down to 14 just under 20 minutes into the match. Thompson\u2019s high shot on Woodman deserved the red card, it was dangerous and Woodman has been forced out of the match. Have a look:      7.18am   Half-time: New Zealand 19-26 England  Well what a 40 minutes. Seven tries and a red card.     7.16am   TRY! New Zealand 19-26 England (Rule, 40')  The line-out is clean and the driving maul is employed. England defend it well but Rule peels off and she is over! Holmes misses the extras.  Updated at 7.18am GMT    7.15am    39 min: New Zealand have the advantage but Leti-I\u2019iga makes a great break. England give away a penalty and New Zealand kick to the corner.     7.14am    38 min: England try to disrupt the line-out but the hosts come away with it. Fluhler is loose with the pass but Holmes does so well to collect it. O\u2019Donnell puts in a great tackle but still New Zealand come.     7.13am    37 min: England have the scrum penalty and they are dominating the set piece. They are running it but New Zealand have the penalty as O\u2019Donnell has a neck roll \u2013 not what they need right now. But they knock on! So back and forth! Harrison puts in an absolute cracker of a kick which finds touch a metre away from the try line, it\u2019s not a 50:22 though.     7.11am    35 min: England are defiant in this final, they are a player down but they are playing so well! If they can go in and not concede again it will be impressive. New Zealand knock on through Leti-I\u2019iga and England have the scrum.   Updated at 7.16am GMT    7.09am   TRY! New Zealand 14-26 England (Cokayne, 33')  The maul is good and Cokayne celebrates! This is some shift from the team down to 14. Scarratt adds the extras!  Updated at 7.15am GMT    7.08am    32 min: A long pass is intercepted by Holmes but Davidson blows the whistle as we come back for the advantage, she runs it anyway \u2013 much to Eden Park\u2019s dismay. England kick to the corner and they will look to bring in the driving maul here.     7.06am    30 min: New Zealand come away with it at the scrum and they run it wide, they decide to pop it through with Holmes kicking to try and find Tui but it\u2019s out of play. Cokayne\u2019s line-out is good and the maul is back in play, they will have to march a long way here. England do have the advantage.      7.05am    28 min: We\u2019re back underway and Aldcroft has received some treatment and she is off for a HIA. O\u2019Donnell is on in her place.     7.03am    28 min: They match to a few metres from the line and Matthews picks it up. It seems McMenamin has turned it over but Davidson comes back for a penalty. But England knocked on first so I think it\u2019s a New Zealand scrum. Slight break in play with a water break.     7.01am    27 min: New Zealand with the ball again, this could be a landslide win after the red. But as soon as I say that Demant throws the ball out of play. England\u2019s line-out is clean and the driving maul is here again/     6.59am   TRY! New Zealand 14-19 England (Leti-I\u2019iga, 26')  New Zealand employs the driving maul and England are doing well to repel it. They are forced to run it wide and replacement Leti-I\u2019iga is over. Holmes adds the extras with a superb kick!   Updated at 7.11am GMT    6.58am    24 min: This game could still go either way but this will be a tough ask from England, the early tries will help them but my word defence will have to be clean. Ward knocks on at the restart and New Zealand kick to the corner.     6.55am   TRY! New Zealand 7-19 England (M Packer, 21')  The driving maul is over, this time from Packer. Simon Middleton punched the air when they went over, shows what it means after the red card. Scarratt conversion is off the post.   Updated at 7.06am GMT    6.55am    21 min: New Zealand have a bad restart and England have a line-out just five metres out. The driving maul is surely going to come into play and it does. They need the points here now.     6.53am   TRY! New Zealand 7-14 England (Ponsonby, 18')  The driving maul is deadly for New Zealand this time. Holmes gets the extras. I\u2019m a little shellshocked by the last few minutes.   Updated at 7.07am GMT    6.52am    18 min: Woodman is off, she is conscious but is off on a cart. Leti-I\u2019iga is on for her. This is a huge moment in this final.     6.50am   RED CARD! New Zealand 0-14 England (Thompson, 18')  That is completely the right call. It was head-on-head tackle with Woodman and the winger is in some pain.   Updated at 6.57am GMT    6.50am    18 min: Woodman looks as though she is in some trouble here with the medics around her as England turn it over and clear their lines with M Packer turning it over. This is worrying for the winger and Davidson is looking here.     6.48am    17 min: Aitchison\u2019s kick is charged down by Fluhler but Packer does well to collect it! However, England give it away in attack and we have the first scrum as the ball hits the referee. New Zealand have the puts in and England have the slight nudge but the hosts come away with it. Woodman springs down the wing and they spread it to the other wing to Tui!  Updated at 6.52am GMT    6.44am   TRY! New Zealand 0-14 England (Cokayne, 13')  They kick to the corner, will we see the driving maul? We do! New Zealand are doing well to repel it but England march forward and Cokayne is over! The hooker screams in celebration and there\u2019s more cheers as Scarratt gets the extras.   Updated at 7.03am GMT    6.43am    12 min: New Zealand\u2019s attack was slightly stalled and so they opt for the kick. Dow runs it and then kicks and the hosts are forced to run it, Woodman makes a huge break! She offloads to Hirini and they are now going through the phases. But England turn it over again as New Zealand are off their feet. Harrison kicks and we have another England line-out. It\u2019s clean once more and Scarratt slickly offloads to Kildunne. New Zealand think they have turned it over but it\u2019s England\u2019s penalty.     6.40am    10 min: New Zealand are once again on the attack, the kick came in but it can\u2019t reach Tui or Fluhler. England line-out is clean once more and Harrison kicks it away. Woodman streams down the wing but England turn it over at the breakdown. This is end-to-end!     6.38am    8 min: The full-back Holmes misses the kick! Wow, the nerves showing slightly.     6.37am    7 min: Bern gives away the penalty at the breakdown and New Zealand point to the sticks, they know how important points are.     6.36am    6 min: It\u2019s a poor restart from England and New Zealand have it. They exchange kicks and the Black Ferns have their first line-out. It\u2019s loose from Ponsonby but the hosts have it and they are looking to strike back quickly.      6.34am   TRY! New Zealand 0-7 England (Kildunne, 3')  Dow escapes down the wing and she passes to Thompson who does well to keep it alive. England have the advantage and they run it wide with Kildunne crashing over! Scarratt slots a great kick for the extras.   Updated at 6.51am GMT    6.33am    2 min: The kick-off is won by Thompson and Harrison gets the first kick in. New Zealand decide to run it but England turn it over through M Packer. Harrison puts in another kick but Holmes does well under pressure to not give back possession. The hosts are playing it from deep here but Demant kicks and England have their first line-out, it\u2019s clean and England attack.     6.31am   Kick-off! New Zealand 0-0 England  Five weeks, 25 matches and just one game to play. Over the next 80 minutes we will find out the winners of the 2021 tournament, here we go!      6.24am    I am crying just seeing the crowd, what an occasion! As cheesy as it sounds, no matter who takes the trophy, women\u2019s rugby is the definite winner.     6.22am    The players are out and the anthems will be in full flow, followed by the haka! It all comes down to this! The nerves are so real, I have no idea how the players are feeling.     6.20am    England head coach Simon Middleton told ITV: \u201cExciting. I think everybody is excited. We hope it\u2019s a great game. We\u2019re focusing on the job at hand.\u201d And he added on L Packer late change: \u201cWe sort of knew all week, Leanne ahs been struggling. She is tough but you can\u2019t send someone in at 70%. We teed it up all week. We anticipated it might happen.\u201d     6.15am    England are favourites for this one but it will be such a tough Test to down New Zealand in their own back yard. So much suspense, 15 minutes to go \u2026     6.10am    Catch up with our previews for Saturday\u2019s huge game at Eden Park.         6.05am    The opening montage has made me cry, this morning will be emotional \u2026     6.02am    Here are some stats for you to get you warmed up for this one! England have scored 239 points so far in the tournament and only conceded 50. The Black Ferns, meanwhile, have scored 234 points and conceded 56.     5.57am    Eden Park is set to be sold-out for this final with 40,000 fans expected to be there. If that many supporters turn out, which looks likely with it filling up ahead of kick-off, it will smash the attendance record for the women\u2019s rugby union match. An astounding achievement and it shows what impact this tournament has had.     5.52am    World Rugby have confirmed that if England can beat New Zealand in today\u2019s final that they will be awarded the highest ever rating given to an international rugby team in the world rankings!     5.48am    I am nervous, excited, emotional \u2013 you name it I\u2019m feeling it! How are you feeling ahead of the final? Let me know via Twitter, @rendellx, or email.     5.43am    Third and fourth place was decided earlier today with France demolishing Canada 36-0. The scoreline was not reflective of the fight Canada displayed, it would be great to see them a professional team before the next World Cup.   Updated at 6.15am GMT    5.38am    All eyes will be on England\u2019s Lucy Packer in this final, a match she was not even down to be on the bench for until today! Leanne Infante is injured and Packer will start with Claudia MacDonald on the bench as cover. A lot of people have said Simon Middleton made a mistake not bringing Mo Hunt to New Zealand just in case this exact situation happened \u2013 a huge occasion for the 22-year-old.     5.32am    The team news is here!

                    "body": "\u201cFootball is happiness. It\u2019s a dance. It\u2019s a true party,\u201d Pel\u00e9 had said and here, on the night he watched from the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein in S\u00e3o Paulo, it was. O Rei had posted that in September to encourage Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior never to back down in the face of abuse: if he wanted to celebrate goals dancing, he should dance. In fact, they all should. \u201cWe will not allow racism to stop us smiling\u201d, he had insisted; \u201cdance, Vini,\u201d became the command, going viral; and by the time Brazil reached Qatar, they had a whole repertoire, ready to perform.\n\n\u201cWe have 10 different dances,\u201d Richarlison revealed, one for each goal they scored. They threatened to run out in a single night, a single half. In the end it was \u201conly\u201d four, all scored within 36 minutes, special delivery.\nAt the final whistle, they paraded a banner showing Pel\u00e9 celebrating that header at the 1970 World Cup. A few hours before Pel\u00e9 had recalled walking Stockholm\u2019s streets in 1958, dreaming of fulfilling a promise to his father to win the World Cup; \u201cI know,\u201d he said, addressing the latest generation wearing that yellow shirt, \u201cthat you have the same dream.\u201d\nOh, they do. They might not make it still, but this felt like a statement. After defeat against Cameroon, perhaps they needed it. More importantly, perhaps Pel\u00e9 needed it, hospitalised with cancer of the colon, treatment withdrawn. \nOn Sunday, assistant coach C\u00e9sar Sampaio asked everyone to pray for Pel\u00e9; now his team provided a homage. Not because they won or scored four, but because they danced, together. Even Tite joined in, a birdie on the touchline. Above all, because they played.\n\nThere\u2019s a moment in the buildup to the final goal in the 1970 World Cup final, before the whole thing unfolds with Pel\u00e9 strolling about, not a care in the world, and Carlos Alberto steaming in, as if rushing to rescue his dog from a fire, when Clodoaldo does this, well, this thing. It\u2019s a stepover, dribble, twist, all in one and it wipes out four Italy players.\nAnd then when he\u2019s finished, he just passes the ball on like there was no reason for it except fun, which is the best reason of all. \u201cThey\u2019re taking it in turns to give an exhibition,\u201d commentator Kenneth Wolstenholme says.\n\nIt\u2019s one of those scenes watched a million times on the goals tapes you recorded as a kid, finger hovering over that red triangle: endless VHS cassettes, commentary still somewhere in your head, buried there before and returning to the surface now at Stadium 974. \u201cSheer delightful football.\u201d\nIt\u2019s also a kind of cliche, of course \u2013 1970, that idealised technicolour dream of a tournament, endlessly replayed and eternally aspired to but never truly emulated.\nOr maybe you prefer 1982, the Brazil team despite losing, joy and tragedy in one \u2013 Goals Tape 8, footage sliced up and set, inevitably, to Santana. Then there\u2019s 1998 and Mas que nada, but that was an advert and at an airport, not on a pitch. Which is partly the point.\nThere is something about Brazil, jogo bonito and all, and they are a bit different. There\u2019s no trio like Ronaldo, Ronaldinho and Rivaldo. But the lament, which is also a cliche, notes that it\u2019s not really like that any more. Only here \u2013 exaggeration alert, and apologies for the rush of childish nostalgia \u2013 for a little while, it kind of was.\n\nAnd even if it isn\u2019t, so what? Go with it for a little bit. They did. When Vin\u00edcius clipped the ball to Lucas Paquet\u00e1, so easy, so smooth, there was the slightest echo of \u00c9der. When Neymar pirouetted round three men \u2013 one of them the referee, because why not? \u2013 there was something, well, Brazilian about it. And when Richarlison coolly completed the third from Thiago Silva\u2019s pass \u2013 what was he doing there? \u2013 it was a ridiculous move. The goal that started it was too cool. Dance, Vini. Even Neymar\u2019s penalty was a little bit silly.\nIt was so easy, there was time for changes, a chance to rest and, more importantly, to take part, for more of them to enjoy this. The second half slipped away amidst smiles and, unexpectedly, Alisson saves.\nDani Alves \u2013 \u201cpeople ask why I still play at 39. Because I love this game, love it!\u201d \u2013 came on and almost scored a flying volley, which was reminiscent too: \u201cZico, what a cracker.\u201d\nEarlier, one of that 82 team worried that no one dribbles any more, but here they did, the fear he lamented in football gone for the night.\n\nThey dribbled and passed and danced and had fun and for a little while it wasn\u2019t about whether they went through or won this whole thing, pressure left for another day; it was just happiness, a dance, a party.\nThey were taking it in turns to give an exhibition, and it was just like watching Brazil. When Pel\u00e9 played. Hope you enjoyed it, King."

                    "body": "Rob Key has dedicated his life to cricket. The current managing director of the men\u2019s game in England played professionally for the best part of 20 years and scored almost 20,000 first-class runs. He loved batting and was very good at it, yet he spent the overwhelming majority of his time as a cricketer doing something he loathed. He hated fielding. \u201cThe fear of letting people down is constant, as is knowing you can\u2019t do anything about it,\u201d he writes in his memoir Oi, Key. In a chapter entitled The Grind, Key describes how he never grew tired of the part of the game he truly loved \u2013 scoring runs \u2013 but says the \u201cdread\u201d of fielding was always with him. Post-retirement he said wryly: \u201cFielding is as close as a human gets to being a dog.\u201d Key\u2019s less than favourable feelings towards fielding are reflected in the views of many cricketers, both amateur and professional. It\u2019s a curiosity that a whole discipline of the game is hated by large swathes of the people who play it. For them, the third element is cricket\u2019s third wheel \u2013 a chore to be endured before it\u2019s their turn to have a go at the good stuff. Fielding can be desolate, relentless, sapping of mind and body. In the timed or limited-overs matches generally played by amateurs, there is succour to be found in knowing that it can\u2019t go on forever. Not so in first-class cricket, where teams can spend days in the field; session after session, slow death by a thousand deliveries. For Paul Collingwood, perhaps England\u2019s greatest ever fielder, there is still enjoyment to be taken from those days in the dirt. A flaxen-haired jaguar prowling at backward point, he was never happier than when hurling himself at a cricket ball, straining every sinew to stop a shot or take a catch.  \u201cIt\u2019s all part of it for me,\u201d he says. \u201cThe deep satisfaction you get when you win Test matches means so much more when you\u2019ve been through those never-ending days, the sessions that burn with proper fatigue, your whole body aching, legs like lead. I guess that\u2019s what you play the game for. Those hard days give the other days more meaning. You\u2019ve got to get through \u2019em, get the dark humour out.\u201d Nevertheless, Collingwood admits that even he might have been struggled to summon gallows humour if he had been playing in the 1999 Durban Test between South Africa and England. Nasser Hussain\u2019s side spent 1,112 minutes (just shy of 19 hours, spanning three days of play) in the field watching Gary Kirsten compile 275 in 878 minutes, the second-longest Test innings on record. Such stints in the field are incomprehensible to the amateur player, who will never appreciate the erosion of the soul brought about by session after session of torment and toil. You could argue the biggest chasm between the professional and amateur game is not batting or bowling, but in the field. Skills with bat and ball have evolved markedly in the modern era, but of the three disciplines it is fielding that has seen the biggest transformation. The athleticism we see today, largely as a result of the proliferation of short-form cricket, is unrecognisable from 10 or 20 years ago. The recent T20 World Cup in Australia was the latest tournament to show off acrobatic feats from unlikely sources \u2013 Ireland player Barry McCarthy pulled off a memorable boundary save that seemed to defy gravity, bringing gasps from the commentators and spontaneous applause from the Australian dug out. When burly fast bowlers named Barry are displaying the gymnastic flair of a prima ballerina, it is an indication of just how far fielding has come. Leaps and bounds. During the ill-timed Australia v England ODI series that began just days after the T20 World Cup final, Ashton Agar (another bowler) left the cricketing world open mouthed with a piece of fielding at the Adelaide Oval that was immediately clipped up and shared online with debate swirling as to whether it was the greatest piece of fielding ever. It has to be seen to be believed.  \u201cIt\u2019s incredible what people can achieve when they practise,\u201d says Collingwood. \u201cT20 triggered a real momentum shift in fielding and the attitudes around it. You know, there\u2019s a lot of money to be made. You\u2019ve got to be a good fielder to get anywhere near a side these days.\u201d It wasn\u2019t always this way. Surviving footage of cricket\u2019s early years tends to show a somewhat gentlemanly approach to fielding, whereby a light trot is the most effort given \u2013 diving or haring after the ball was seemingly not the done thing. In these highlights reels, fielders often resemble extras in a silent movie. However, there are accounts of superlative fielders from the game\u2019s formative years. The Reverend Vernon Royle was one. A middle-order batter for Lancashire who played a solitary Test match for England against Australia in 1879, Royle was said to be ambidextrous, lightning fast in the covers, and in possession of a powerful throwing arm. Gilbert Jessop, who made the first of his 18 Test appearances for England in 1899, earned the nickname \u201cThe Croucher\u201d for his hunched technique at the crease but was also lauded for his fielding. Jessop\u2019s obituary in Wisden noted that his skills in the field were as \u201cphenomenal\u201d as his batting.  Australia had Clarence Everard \u201cNip\u201d Pellew, an enterprising batter who was also said to be able to throw the ball a hundred yards and sprint the same distance in just over 10 seconds. After his death in 1981, aged 87, Wisden noted: \u201cIn any discussion of the world\u2019s greatest outfielders, he must be a candidate for a place.\u201d But there is one man who changed everything: Colin Bland. Tall, athletic and long-limbed, Bulawayo-born Bland was nicknamed \u201cthe Golden Eagle\u201d for his ability to swoop and collect the ball with graceful precision. He could certainly bat \u2013 scoring three centuries and averaging 49 from 21 Tests \u2013 but it\u2019s a testament to Bland\u2019s fielding prowess that his primary role in the side is generally mentioned only as an afterthought. His former Test captain, Peter van der Merwe, said in 1999 that Bland \u201crevolutionised the attitude to fielding and set a standard not yet equalled\u201d. It\u2019s notable that van der Merwe said this seven years after Jonty Rhodes had flown on to the global stage with his \u201cSuperman\u201d run out of Inzamam-ul-Haq in the 1992 World Cup. For those who had the privilege of seeing him, Bland was and is unparalleled.  Bland was evangelical about his craft, from methodically hurling stones at telegraph poles as a child to the arduous, almost obsessive, practice methods he adopted as a player. He wrote in his 1969 book, Dynamic Cricket, that he carried out an 11-minute daily exercise routine favoured by the Canadian Air Force: \u201cWhen the chips are down, it is fitness that sorts the sheep from the goats.\u201d Through his dedication and skill, Bland unlocked new possibilities. His run-out of Ken Barrington for 91 during the Lord\u2019s Test of 1965 was seismic, Barrington admitting afterwards that he had invited disaster upon himself by \u201ctrying to snitch a single when that cove was anywhere around\u201d. Bland ran out Jim Parks during the same game in equally impressive style, swooping low to pick up the ball one-handed before unleashing a rapid throw while off-balance that sent the stumps cartwheeling and his teammates and the crowd into raptures. In the immediate aftermath, footage shows Bland standing calmly, hands on hips, as if idly waiting for a bus. For him these feats were not extraordinary; they were simply the standards he expected of himself. Spectators could not get enough of this electrifying presence in the field and there was a clamour to see the Golden Eagle in full flight. So much so that after the 1965 Lord\u2019s Test, during a rain-interrupted tour match at Canterbury which was being shown on the BBC, the reticent Bland was persuaded by Colin Cowdrey to put on an exhibition in front of the television cameras. The footage is remarkable. In front of a mesmerised crowd, Bland resembles not an eagle but a panther, stalking around the turf before springing into action. He didn\u2019t disappoint. While \u201con the run\u201d, he hit the stumps from 12 attempts out of 15, noting drily afterwards: \u201cThey spoiled me by giving me three stumps to aim at. I always practise with one.\u201d Like Bland, Collingwood pushed himself to the limit in pursuit of excellence. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest, I used to do quite a lot of training myself,\u201d says England\u2019s former white-ball captain. \u201cI loved practising. Loved seeing what I could push myself to do, seeing what the body and reflexes were capable of.\u201d Collingwood credits his teenage years as a football goalkeeper for laying the foundations. Even before that, he was fond of diving around and getting stuck in. \u201cMany times I would come home with a hole in my jumper and in the knees of me trousers. I think from an early age I got used to falling down. I was not scared to dive and fall down. Once I knew I was gonna be safe, I could really attack fielding.\u201d  Until relatively recently, gun fielders such as Collingwood and Rhodes were the outliers. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t everybody\u2019s cup of tea,\u201d admits Collingwood. \u201cIt was almost unfashionable in many ways.\u201d But he claims, somewhat self-deprecatingly, that he wouldn\u2019t stand out in this era. He picks out Chris Jordan as the best he\u2019s seen. \u201cIt\u2019s like he\u2019s in The Matrix. He can do freakish things, man. He has Velcro for hands!\u201d So what\u2019s next? How much further can fielding excellence go? Collingwood doesn\u2019t think it will be long before we see further developments: genuinely ambidextrous fielders, and more gravity-defying catches and boundary-saves thanks to ongoing advances in strength and conditioning. Not to mention how much time players are now spending on honing their skills.  \u201cThe England boys always ask: \u2018Do you miss playing?\u2019\u201d says Collingwood. \u201cAnd the only thing I do miss is fielding. I never had any anxiety in the field like I did with batting. I wanted the ball. All the time. I do miss it. I was good at it.\u201d For some, fielding will never be more than drudgery. But for those who truly embrace it \u2013 Bland, Rhodes, Collingwood and the like \u2013 the game\u2019s third element gives them everything they need and more.

                    "body": "\u201cDreaming is free but to do it is different.\u201d Romain Sa\u00efss could hardly have put it better. Morocco have written themselves, a continent and a region into football folklore and the impact could be priceless. Every underdog, which in practice also means every African country, arrives at a World Cup with big hopes and the occasional bold proclamation but the Atlas Lions have delivered in a way none of them has been able to match.\nBefore the tournament Walid Regragui, their manager, had warned: \u201cOne should not have too many expectations about this team.\u201d Sa\u00efss, the captain and former Wolves defender, had suggested himself that a last\u201116 place should be their target. Morocco were a low-key entrant to Qatar 2022 and never let themselves get carried away. The dream has increased in scope with every hurdle jumped; its rewards are already priceless.\n\u201cWe want to keep making history,\u201d Sa\u00efss said. On the face of things it will be a tall order against France, especially given the extent of Morocco\u2019s walking wounded. Three of the back four that finished against Portugal were deputies; a second-half injury to Sa\u00efss, who was taken off on a stretcher and looked distraught at the time, was part of the reason. \u201cI hope it\u2019s going to be OK but, if I feel it\u2019s too difficult, I won\u2019t take any risk and put my team in trouble just to play the semi-final,\u201d he said, cutting a much more upbeat figure in the hours after full time.\n\nSuch selflessness has helped to bring Morocco this far. Regragui has produced a minor miracle in coaxing painstaking defensive contributions from Hakim Ziyech and Sofiane Boufal, neither of whom was renowned for such diligence. One bonus of demanding contributions deep in defensive territory is that both are confident enough to execute some of the extraordinary flicks, passes and turns that fashion attack from defence in a few dizzying instants and are a beguiling hallmark of this side. No team at this tournament has broken opponents\u2019 presses in such inventive fashion.\nSofiane Amrabat, the outstanding midfielder, explained how Morocco are reaching into hidden reserves. \u201cWe are very tired but there is no choice,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t fresh but this is the World Cup and you must give everything you have: run like crazy until the end.\u201d\nHe did exactly that. One slalom out of trouble and through Portugal\u2019s midfield in injury time made a mockery of suggestions Morocco were spent and it is hard to imagine the degree of willpower, coupled with ability to remain so clear-headed, that was required to pull through at that stage. \u201cI\u2019ve already played almost 30 games this season in three or four months,\u201d Amrabat said. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard but you have no choice. Everyone has to go until the end and ask the maximum from himself, from his body.\u201d\nMorocco have rewritten the rules of possibility. The thought that a left-back from the Casablanca club, Wydad AC, might start a World Cup semi-final would never have seemed credible but Yahia Attiyat Allah showed on Saturday that he will be more than capable of competing if Noussair Mazraoui has not recovered from illness and injury. Achraf Dari, who came on for Sa\u00efss and showed no fear of putting his head where it might hurt most, had been his clubmate until joining Brest in July.\nThese things matter: they change everything, opening up the possibility that a headlong dash to Europe is not the only path to fulfilment. During the group stage it was common to sit in on African teams\u2019 press conferences and hear, particularly from Ghana\u2019s eloquent coach Otto Addo, why the continent\u2019s attempts to break new ground are hamstrung by poor representation at World Cups. Little margin for error is possible with five slots. \u201cIf they had 10 African teams, perhaps five would get to the quarter-finals,\u201d Regragui said after Morocco\u2019s draw with Croatia, which raised few eyebrows at the time. \u201cAfrican teams need to be aware we are elite teams.\u201d\n\nAnother of Regragui\u2019s points back then was that Africa\u2019s sides \u201coften end up losing right at the end\u201d. No longer. That spectre was thoroughly dismissed in the closing stages, swept away after Yassine Bounou had denied Cristiano Ronaldo the kind of ending he used to take for granted. When the Morocco substitute Zakaria Aboukhlal ran clear only to miss the most inviting of chances to settle things the ghosts of Ghana in 2010 and, perhaps less painfully, the fine Senegal and Cameroon sides that preceded them loomed large. But this time there was no cruel twist: just sheer proficiency. The removal of that mental barrier shifts the entire conversation for Africa and, quite conceivably, for traditional outsiders in general.\n\u201cThe 22 players, how we defend, our fighting spirit,\u201d Amrabat said when asked about Morocco\u2019s secret. They have more strings to their bow than that but it has more than paid off to be self-effacing so far. Then came the bigger question: could they dare think of winning the entire thing?\n\u201cYes, why not?\u201d he replied in a millisecond. Morocco have earned their right to reach for the stars."

                    "body": "Denmark are braced for a Socceroos onslaught, with coach Kasper Hjulmand expecting \u201cthey\u2019ll run against us\u201d early and hard. The only question remaining is whose legs will be doing the running, as counterpart Graham Arnold pushed back a decision on the make-up of his starting XI until match day.\nIn the clearest indication yet that Australia are being taken seriously by World Cup opposition, Fifa\u2019s 10th-ranked nation are preparing to face \u201ca well-organised football team\u201d with both \u201cindividual and collective\u201d strengths when they meet to decide their fate on Wednesday night (Thursday 2am AEDT).\n\u201cThey have really some strengths in the team, individually but mostly as a team \u2013 just like we do,\u201d Hjulmand said on the eve of their final Group D match at Al Janoub Stadium. \u201cWe also define ourself as a very strong unit and a team that works very well together.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a well-organised football team with strength in the organisation and the way they work together. They attack together, they defend together, and they stick to a plan. They have some quality players with some strengths we have to be sure we are aware of, both with the young players but also the experienced players. We know this \u2013 we met them four years ago as well.\u201d\nThe difference between that 1-1 draw, also during the group stage of the 2018 World Cup, is that both teams were overseen by two different managers and Australia, at least, fielded an almost-unrecognisable team and only equalised via a penalty \u2013 with help from the VAR \u2013 to cancel out Christian Eriksen\u2019s opener.\nThe Socceroos scored two goals across their three matches in Russia and both were Mile Jedinak penalties. In Qatar they also have two goals, this time both from open play and of genuine quality.\n\nLike his predecessor Bert van Marwijk, Arnold\u2019s philosophy is rooted in pragmatic tendencies and a proclivity for counter-attacking, as evidenced in the build-up to Craig Goodwin\u2019s goal against France and Mitchell Duke\u2019s against Tunisia.\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Hjulmand said, \u201cbut I think they\u2019ll come out strong against us. They won\u2019t just be sitting, I think they\u2019ll run against us. I think we\u2019ll be put under pressure. They\u2019ll try to get close to us in the duels.\n\u201cI see them also attack. They pass the ball very well in the beginning, and then they find some spaces and some pockets after duels that pick up the second ball, and they move forward and run forward. So I expect them to come out just like they did the last couple of matches, and that\u2019s very, very strong.\n\u201cWe should make sure that we have the positions and movement that will hurt the structures of Australia as much as possible, but I have great respect for the way they do [things].\u201d\nThe alteration in language around the Socceroos has shifted markedly since Saturday\u2019s landmark win over Tunisia. Arnold may not have been anticipating Hjulmand\u2019s complimentary words because, in his own pre-match press conference directly afterwards, he said Denmark under-appreciated Australia\u2019s quality.\n\u201cThere could be one thing they underestimate us on, and that is our quality,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about being fighting kangaroos or, you know, the Australians are just fighting all the time. It\u2019s also the quality that we can bring as a team as well.\u201d\nAs is so often the case in the final round of group games, the permutations play out live while both games take place concurrently. Third-placed Denmark\u2019s position is straightforward: they must beat second-placed Australia and hope last-placed Tunisia do not upset already-qualified France.\n\nThe Socceroos, however, can still progress via a draw but only if Tunisia do not defeat France. It is a gamble Arnold says he will not take \u2013 only a win will do \u2013 though both coaches will receive real-time updates on the score of the other fixture and have in the back of their mind what they must do.\nThe obvious blueprint for Australia is their own display against Tunisia: score early, protect the lead with their lives and put the onus on the opposition to play.\nHjulmand felt that would be \u201ca dangerous attitude\u201d. \u201cBecause they don\u2019t really know if they\u2019ve progressed with a draw,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I think they will come out very strong and try to have their periods where they put pressure on us as well.\n\u201cAnd, like all football games, there will be times where we have to break down a very strong defensive unit. They have been very close in their organisation, and the toughest thing in football is to break down an organisation like that.\u201d"

                    "body": "Darkness falls quickly in Qatar. The night steals in like a kidnapper, wrapping its shroud around the desert like a bag over the head. Sunsets barely last long enough to choose an Instagram filter. On Saturday evening, either England or France will also discover that in these parts, oblivion descends with a devastating brutality.\nCome 10pm local time, what has gone before will cease to matter. To the loser, the ruthless and often scintillating football that brought them to this quarter-final will be of no consolation at all. One of Harry Kane or Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 is a fraud. One of Didier Deschamps or Gareth Southgate is a moron. One of Declan Rice or Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni is about to be \u201cpainfully exposed at this level\u201d. Either the Football Association needs to take a long hard look at its French counterpart, or vice versa. Two hours of football decides the lot. Sorry, that\u2019s just the way it goes.\nThat we all willingly buy into this quasi-fiction is what lends World Cup knockout football its maniacal power. A microscopic VAR call; an act of unrepeatable brilliance; a lucky deflection off the backside of Olivier Giroud; a penalty kick. On these slippery wheels are broken the work of four years. And for all the inevitable pre-match prophecy and post-match autopsy, England v France feels impossible to call with any confidence.\n\nTempo is one reason for this. Unlike Spain or Argentina, France and England lack a recognisable motif, a single consistent energy. This is both blessing and curse. Few teams rival France\u2019s ability to accelerate through the gears, to turn patience to impatience, ice to fire, verse to chorus.\nThey sit, they settle, they absorb, they go quiet. Then they attack with sudden and concussive speed, a sensory overload that short-circuits a defence in seconds. But the rest of the time they give you a chance.\nEngland have also played this tournament at two speeds. For 30 minutes against Wales and Senegal, and for 90 minutes against the United States, they looked bereft and maladroit: a team of spoons in a world of pork chops. But in their moments of clarity, when the wingers dovetail and the midfielders storm the keep, few teams can withstand them. Southgate\u2019s substitutions have often been dazzlingly effective.\nMbapp\u00e9 and Kane personify this dichotomy. Mbapp\u00e9 will consciously harness his efforts during a game, saving his legs for the eight or nine full-gas sprints that will capture his evening. He barely defends. He will not come back at set pieces. Incredibly, he has not touched the ball in France\u2019s defensive third all tournament. But he has had 42 touches in the opposition penalty area: more than Kane, Phil Foden, Jude Bellingham and Bukayo Saka combined.\n\nKane\u2019s extremes manifest differently. Few strikers are better at disrupting the balance of a defence: holding the ball up, dropping deep, releasing swanky diagonal passes for Saka and Foden. But when he quietens, England fumble a little. Opponents push up the pitch, squeeze the space, force England to punt up the flanks. If Kyle Walker\u2019s supervision of Mbapp\u00e9 is the most important duel on the pitch, then Tchouam\u00e9ni against Kane is a close second.\nHere the roles of Bellingham and Antoine Griezmann will be vital: sniffing out space, creating supremacies out wide, making dangerous runs beyond the backline, snuffing out counterattacks at source. With Giroud and Kane in retreat, and assuming an unchanged England 4-3-3, the midfield essentially comprises two diamonds. Kane and Bellingham will try to overload Tchouam\u00e9ni; Griezmann and Giroud will do the same with Rice. Jordan Henderson and Adrien Rabiot will merrily slap each other around all night.\nA tight, structured game probably suits England; if it stretches, France can usually be trusted to score one goal more than you.\nWhere France hold the clear advantage is in pedigree, pacing, knowing how these games are won. They have faced teams as good as England; Southgate\u2019s England have never faced a team as good as this France. France know how to defend a lead and they know how to chase one. Their squad, many of whom won in Russia in 2018, drips with big-game panache. Ten Champions League medals to England\u2019s three tells a story; when it comes to losing finals, meanwhile, England lead 10 to six.\nHave England learned from their mistakes? All three of their tournament exits (Croatia 2018, Netherlands 2019, Italy 2021) came after peaking too soon, mislaying the balance between aggression and caution. Here, the very opposite has been true: stay in the game, build the layers, identify the problems before you solve them. Really this has been the story of Southgate\u2019s England: a journey of refinement, machine learning, fitful growth. Talent has been added. Talent has been discarded. Systems have been trialled and junked. But every misstep has toughened them a little.\nAnd look, it takes time to crack this thing. Spain went through cycles of underachievement before striking perfection. Joachim L\u00f6w\u2019s Germany lost two semi-finals and a final before winning in 2014. Deschamps\u2019 side evolved over three tournaments: a promising run snuffed out by savvier opponents (Germany 2014), followed by an agonising defeat on home soil (Portugal 2016) and finally the triumph of 2018. Anyone reducing this elephantine process to the crude binary of \u201chandbrake on, handbrake off\u201d has probably never won a thing in their lives.\n\nNonetheless, there is a kind of boss-level finality here. Win or lose, this game is likely to define the Southgate era. More so because it is a purer footballing test, stripped of the emotional heft of a Wembley final, the blithe naivety of 2018, the historical baggage of England v Germany.\nToxic nationalism is mercifully sparse in this fixture, even if politically the rivalry dates back much further. England fans do not crow about the hundred years war or sing about \u201cTen French Archers\u201d. Indeed the role of the crowd should be minimal. Whatever fate befalls England here does so on their terms.\nFor Deschamps the stakes are equally high. Two early exits in succession would likely mark the end of his decade in charge and his replacement by Zinedine Zidane. It would bring down the curtain on that golden class of 2018: Giroud, Hugo Lloris, Paul Pogba, perhaps even Griezmann and N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9. Questions would be asked over the reliance on Mbapp\u00e9, the culpability of the national federation, perhaps even French football itself, which is battling numerous off-field scandals and an increasingly strained relationship with the public.\nAll this and more on the line. This is the tournament\u2019s penultimate weekend, but only now does the end feel within touching distance. From Croydon to Cr\u00e9teil, from Doha to Douala, the world will pause for this genuine heavyweight bout. And as any seasoned heavyweight will tell you, the end often comes a little quicker than you think."

                    "body": "There are plenty of contenders in the annals of rugby league history to choose from, but this could well be the most dominant day in Australia\u2019s long and illustrious history. No two Rugby League World Cups are the same in terms of the narratives, the plot-lines and the stories that are told. They are thrilling rollercoaster rides, and this year\u2019s has been no different. But more often than not, the final chapter is the same: and that was the case once again at Old Trafford. The statistics alone are frightening. Of the last 12 men\u2019s World Cups, Australia have now won 11 of them. They conceded just eight tries all tournament long here. Throw in the fact the Jillaroos won their third consecutive World Cup earlier in the day with a 50-point win over New Zealand, and there is no sign of the green and gold dominance ending across the male and female disciplines of rugby league any time soon.  There is an argument across the rest of the international game that the Australian authorities need to show more willingness to stage Kangaroos fixtures. Yes, the pandemic has stunted rugby league across the globe but the fact Australia had not played a single Test since 2019 before this World Cup underlines the apathy with which their hierarchy treat the international game. Whether this latest victory changes that remains to be seen: but the world needs Australia to be playing more often in the years between now and the next World Cup in 2025. Perhaps the most chastening thing here was this was all so predictable. The story of Samoa, an island nation of just over 200,000 people, reaching the final for the first time captivated the rugby league world. But really, without getting up into top gear, the Kangaroos chewed that narrative up, spat it out and sauntered their way to yet another World Cup title. There was no shortage of effort from Matt Parish\u2019s side, but the outcome was a typically familiar one. \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic,\u201d the victorious coach, Mal Meninga, said. \u201cThe first half was exceptional and we did what we needed to do. In the second half we scrambled well, a man down but we still scored points. I wasn\u2019t nervous, I\u2019m confident in this footy team.\u201d  Leading 14-0 at half-time, the Kangaroos always felt like they had Samoa at arm\u2019s length. Samoa actually enjoyed the greater possession in the early exchanges but you felt that when they couldn\u2019t make it count, the Kangaroos would make them pay. They duly obliged when Latrell Mitchell forced his way over before five minutes later, a break from Josh Addo-Carr led to James Tedesco scoring. Tedesco, the Australian captain who was playing for Italy in the last World Cup, was the game\u2019s outstanding contributor here. \u201cHe was exceptional, absolutely on it tonight,\u201d Meninga said. \u201cWe needed him.\u201d Liam Martin was next to cross for the Kangaroos to make it 14-0 at half-timeand while Samoa had certainly battled, there was little doubting they had been outplayed in the crucial moments. But this proud nation can look back on an unforgettable tournament. Hopefully, they have created a legacy for more Australian-born players to commit to Pacific nations and in the long term, that could help close the gap on the Kangaroos. It could, in the years to come, be viewed as a breakthrough moment for the sport. \u201cIt\u2019s been a fantastic journey,\u201d Parish said. \u201cI\u2019d like to thank all the Samoan people around the world for supporting this team. The support we\u2019ve had all around the world has been unbelievable.\u201d However, his side were undone when it mattered here. Cameron Murray\u2019s try while Australia were reduced to 12 men, following an elbow from Angus Crichton on Chanel Harris-Tavita that could have easily resulted in a red card, underlined the gulf in quality. Samoa at least created two special moments with tries from Brian To\u2019o and Stephen Crichton, the man who broke English hearts last week in the semi-finals. But they were mere consolations. Five minutes after To\u2019o\u2019s try, Tedesco cut through for his second before Mitchell did the same in the dying moments. The celebrations come full time were ones we\u2019re used to seeing now. Who can stop the Kangaroos? Right now, the answer appears to be nobody."

When conversation turned to the upcoming World Cup, it brought back the happiest memories of his childhood. He was rocked by a wave of nostalgia for friends and food, but especially for his lifelong passion: football.\nSo, he took a bold decision: he would sell all his things and move back to Buenos Aires to watch the tournament. It was a choice some might consider radical. But in this South American country where football is arguably a spiritual experience, it felt like keeping the faith.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the things that I miss about living in the US, because it\u2019s not the same,\u201d he told the Observer at the sidelines of a match with some friends in the well-heeled Buenos Aires neighbourhood of Colegiales. It was Friday evening, and every restaurant, cafe and bar was festooned in Argentinian bunting, TV screens showing a clock counting down in the corner: 39 hours, 21 minutes and 15 seconds until the match to end all matches.\n\u201cPeople [in the US] are not as passionate as they are here. When we were talking about the World Cup, I said, \u2018I can\u2019t miss the opportunity to be with my family and friends for this.\u2019\u201d His loyalty has been richly rewarded so far: on Tuesday, Argentina beat Croatia 3-0 to score a place in the tournament\u2019s final.\nWorld Cup fervour has been palpable in Buenos Aires since before the first kickoff. Businesses are decked in blue and white. Electronic highway signs usually reserved for traffic updates now read: \u201cVAMOS ARGENTINA.\u201d During the team\u2019s matches, shops shut, workers clock off early, and university lectures are suspended. But this week, it\u2019s reaching fever pitch.\n\nAfter a shock 2-1 loss to Saudi Arabia and a nail-biting penalty shootout against the Netherlands, the latest victory of La Scaloneta, as the team is affectionately called, finally has Argentinians hoping that superstar captain Lionel Messi will take his team all the way.\nAfter each match, growing numbers of fans have flocked to the obelisk in the city centre to celebrate. After the Netherlands, even a torrential summer storm wasn\u2019t enough to clear revellers draped in flags, who appeared to take it as tears of joy from Maradona in heaven. Come Tuesday\u2019s Croatia victory, impromptu block parties were breaking out all over the city.\n\u201cI think people really need to celebrate,\u201d said Alexis Bellani, 36, who organises the Friday evening games at the Colegiales pitch. \u201cWe\u2019re always in the news for bad stuff, politics and the economy aren\u2019t going in the direction you might want, and it\u2019s been a long time since there\u2019s been a genuine reason to celebrate.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s been playing football since he was a toddler. He is the proud owner of a vast collection of football shirts, which he cajoles friends into bringing from all corners of the world. As well as playing, he supports River Plate, and got tickets to the infamous 2018 Copa Libertadores final between Boca Juniors and River Plate \u2013 although it was ultimately relocated to Madrid after crazed River fans attacked the Boca team\u2019s bus. But he says all this doesn\u2019t make him any more of a fan than the average Argentine.\n\u201cThe day of the quarter-final with the Netherlands, I ended up with body pains, like when you exercise too hard,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause here you experience it almost like a kind of ego, patriotism, a historic moment \u2013 your life depends on whether Argentina wins or loses.\u201d\nA victory would mean bringing home football\u2019s most prestigious trophy for the first time since 1986, the year Maradona\u2019s infamous \u201chand of God\u201d goal knocked England out at the quarter-final stage. To say that Maradona is revered in Argentina is no exaggeration: Argentina is even home to a Church of Maradona.\n\nBellani plans to watch the game at his parents\u2019 house, because it\u2019s c\u00e1bala, he says, using the word for the superstitions Argentinians develop as they watch the tournament. Some c\u00e1balas are personal, but others shoot to international fame. Mar\u00eda Cristina Mariscotti, a 76-year-old woman from Buenos Aires, became a c\u00e1bala after she started dancing in the street with the fans in her neighbourhood after games. They went viral, adopting the chant \u201cabuela [grandmother] la la la la la!\u201d, even though Mariscotti doesn\u2019t have grandchildren.\nIf you change something about how you watch the match and the team loses, that\u2019s mufa. Like c\u00e1balas, these can be anything \u2013 including, according to some, former president Mauricio Macri, who has been in Qatar for the tournament.\nPablo Noya, 29, a sports journalist who used to play football professionally for JJ Urquiza and Deportivo Espa\u00f1ol, said football was a way for Argentinians to escape the problems of their day-to-day lives. \u201cIt\u2019s a moment where we\u2019re all equal,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are people who have nothing, but with football they can celebrate \u2026 there\u2019s no social class, there are no economic problems. For me, that\u2019s what football is.\u201d\nAnd his greatest hope for Sunday? His beaming smile says it all. He just doesn\u2019t dare speak the C word \u2013 although he points out it ends in H-A-M-P-I-O-N in English \u2013 because any Argentinian knows that saying the quiet part out loud would be mufa."

Ali Catterall The Great Game 9pm, Sky Atlantic  It\u2019s still early doors for this Italian drama about a disgraced football agent with scores to settle, but it has intrigue and bling to burn. Corso Manni (Francesco Montanari) may have the look of a stage hypnotist but he retains an enviable contacts book. Can he pull off a tricky favour for fickle striker Quintana (actual former footballer Jes\u00fas Mosquera Bernal)?

There are notes of Before Sunrise and It\u2019s a Wonderful Life as the story shifts uneasily between black comedy and sadness. But you should really watch this for the immensely likable Cuoco \u2013 on a roll after The Flight Attendant \u2013 who brings a zesty, slightly acidic humour and chippy vulnerability to her character.

                    "body": "\n 6.54pm  \n\nDavid Hytner was at the Lusail Stadium tonight. His report is in, and here it is. Congratulations to Argentina, commiserations to France, and thank you both so much for serving up perhaps the greatest final of all. Thanks to you as well, dear reader, for sticking with us on the MBM all the way through the tournament. See you all for the Carabao Cup next week. (Too clunky a gear change?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated at 11.46pm GMT\n\n\n 6.49pm  \n\nMessi disrobes \u2026 just the robe \u2026 and jumps around a bit more, better to show off his Argentina shirt. Then he hands the trophy to his team-mates as he jigs around with his kids again. At last, at long last: Argentina and Lionel Messi: Campeones del Mundo.\n\n\n\n 6.45pm  \n\nLionel Messi, fully robed up, rubs his hands in anticipation of finally \u2013 finally \u2013 lifting the World Cup. The Emir of Qatar and Fifa president Gianni Infantino hand over the golden prize. Messi takes possession of the holy grail, ekes out the moment by bobbing lightly along the podium, in front of his team-mates \u2026 then hoists the World Cup high into the air! Fireworks! Dancing! Glee! Argentina are champions of the world!\n\n\nUpdated at 8.41pm GMT\n\n\n 6.42pm  \n\nArgentina come up to get their gold medals in numerical order. That means it\u2019s not a long wait for the man who converted the winning penalty, Gonzalo Montiel. Huge cheers for Manchester City\u2019s Julian Alvarez and Angel Di Maria. Aston Villa\u2019s Emi Martinez. Lisandro Martinez of Manchester United. Cristian Romero of Spurs. Alexis Mac Allister of Brighton. A medal around the neck of manager Lionel Scaloni \u2026 then his namesake Messi. The roof comes off as he hugs the Emir, and he\u2019ll be lifting the World Cup in a few seconds \u2026\n\n\n\n 6.38pm  \n\nHugo Lloris leads his brave France team up to the podium. Every one of them look drained, disappointed, distraught. They\u2019ll appreciate having taken part in an all-time classic \u2026 one day, one day. But for now, it\u2019s silver medals and sympathetic handshakes all round. They\u2019ve accepted defeat with good grace. No surprise there: it was a final competed in the best spirit. Les bleus line up for a group photo. Last man up, Kylian Mbappe, who looks utterly ruined. He contemplates taking his silver medal off, but doesn\u2019t. Like I say, good grace. What a team. They came so close to retaining the trophy, something that hasn\u2019t been done for 60 years. What a team.\n\n\n\n 6.33pm  \n\nAll four award winners pose for a group photo. Three of them are signally happier than the other one. Congratulations to Lionel, Enzo, Emi and Kylian. Poor Kylian.\n\n\n\n 6.32pm  \n\nMore awards. Then the golden glove award is given to Emi Martinez. He first uses it as a phallic symbol, then sucks on its thumb. It\u2019s a way of celebrating, I guess. And next up, a grim Kylian Mbappe, getting his golden boot for top goalscorer. Shades of Messi picking up his player-of-the-tournament award after losing the 2014 final. Hats off to Mbappe for forcing a smile when posing for the photos. And finally the Golden Ball goes, just as it did in 2014, to Messi. Of course it does. He\u2019s a damn sight happier this time. A huge smile. Then he walks past the World Cup Trophy and gives it a tender stroke and kiss. Aww! The crowd go wild. Imagine the noise we\u2019ll hear when he finally gets to lift it.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 8.43pm GMT\n\n\n 6.27pm  \n\nRight, here come the dignitaries. Fifa bauchle Gianni Infantino (you\u2019re welcome, Gordon in Ayr) and the Emir of Qatar. Medals are hung around the neck of referee Szymon Marciniak and his team. They all had a fine game. Then the young player of the tournament award goes to Enzo Fernandez of Argentina. Not a bad month\u2019s work for the 21-year-old Benfica midfielder.\n\n\nUpdated at 6.31pm GMT\n\n\n 6.23pm  \n\nThe lights dim in the stadium. Time for the trophy presentation. As we wait for all the celebrations, let\u2019s again consider Lionel Messi, who has become the first player to score at every stage of a modern finals: the groups, the round of 16, the quarters, the semi, and the final. That\u2019s not quite up there with Jairzinho, who scored in every single match of Brazil\u2019s successful 1970 run (though he didn\u2019t have a round of 16 game to play) but six out of seven ain\u2019t bad: the only game he didn\u2019t score in was the group win over Poland. \n\n\n\n 6.19pm  \n\nMessi is doing the family thing right now, a world of delight. Di Maria, who has pretty much been in tears on and off ever since scoring that sensational first-half goal, gets a hug from his loved ones too. An awful lot of pogoing going on.\n\n\n\n 6.12pm  \n\n\u2026 and the final standings in the race for the Golden Boot.\n8: Kylian Mbappe (France)7: Lionel Messi (Argentina)4: Julian Alvarez (Argentina), Olivier Giroud (France)\nThat\u2019s the biggest haul since Ronaldo also scored eight in 2002. You have to go back 52 years for a better personal goalscoring performance at a World Cup, Gerd Muller scoring ten at Mexico 1970. Poor Mbappe, head dropped, is heartbroken right now. France\u2019s president Emmanuel Macron gives him an avuncular hug, gathering him back up to full height. He\u2019ll look back on this tournament with pride \u2026 given time. A lovely tweet waiting for him when he gets back in the changing room, too.\n\n\n\n\n 6.06pm  \n\nThe updated World Cup roll of honour, then.\n5: Brazil (1958, 1962, 1970, 1994, 2002)4: Italy (1934, 1938, 1982, 2006), Germany (1954, 1974, 1990, 2014)3: Argentina (1978, 1986, 2022)2: Uruguay (1930, 1950), France (1998, 2018)1: England (1966), Spain (2010)\n\n\n\n 6.04pm  \n\nMbappe sits on the bench with his number 10 shirt pulled up over his head. A few tears no doubt. Who could blame him? A hat-trick in the final! Finally, someone makes it onto the list alongside Sir Geoff Hurst. But unlike England\u2019s 1966 hero, there\u2019s no joy for him today. At least he\u2019s already got a winner\u2019s medal in his cabinet, not that he\u2019ll be thinking about that right now. A lot of pensive French stars staring into the middle distance right now.\n\n\nUpdated at 6.11pm GMT\n\n\n 6.02pm  \n\nMessi is wandering around in disbelief. A huge stoned smile across his face. High on life. No wonder. He\u2019s at the top of the world. But spare a thought for poor Kylian Mbappe, who has just scored a hat-trick in the World Cup final, only to find himself on the losing side. He looks bereft. When the pain subsides \u2026 and it will take a while \u2026 he\u2019ll look with satisfaction upon his stellar contribution to the greatest World Cup final of all time. Because it was, wasn\u2019t it? What a story! What performances by Messi and Mbappe! What a final.\n\n\nUpdated at 6.39pm GMT\n\n\n 5.57pm  \n\nArgentina pile on each other in a mixture of glee and, well, tearful glee. Argentina held their nerve in the penalty shoot-out \u2013 with a little help from Emi Martinez\u2019s mind games \u2013 and they\u2019ve won their third World Cup! Lionel Messi has his winners medal at last, and the weight of the world is visibly lifted off his shoulders! He smiles, sparkling like a young boy, just a happy lad. What a performance! What a career! What a final.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 6.21pm GMT\n\n\n 5.55pm  \nArgentina win the 2022 World Cup!!!\n\nPENALTIES: France 2-4 Argentina. Montiel rolls confidently into the bottom left, and Argentina are kings of the world!\n\n\nUpdated at 6.17pm GMT\n\n\n 5.54pm  \n\nUp comes Gonzalo Montiel. He can win the World Cup for Argentina\u2026\n\n\nUpdated at 6.16pm GMT\n\n\n 5.54pm  \n\nPENALTIES: France 2-3 Argentina. Martinez is booked for trying it on again. And this time his throw-away ruse doesn\u2019t work, Kolo Muani roofing one down the middle.\n\n\n\n 5.53pm  \n\nPENALTIES: France 1-3 Argentina. Paredes whistles his kick into the bottom left, and Argentina are so close now! Lloris went the right way and may wonder if he should have done better.\n\n\n\n 5.52pm  \n\nPENALTIES: France 1-2 Argentina. Martinez flings the ball away, forcing Tchouameni to go fetch. More time to think \u2026 and he drags a dismal effort wide left. Martinez had gone the right way, too!\n\n\n\n 5.51pm  \n\nPENALTIES: France 1-2 Argentina. Dybala was brought on for this. He fires his straight down the middle, and it\u2019s advantage Argentina. As cool as Messi.\n\n\n\n 5.50pm  \n\nPENALTIES: France 1-1 Argentina. Coman goes bottom left \u2026 but it\u2019s not good and Martinez gets down to make the easy save. The stadium erupts!\n\n\nUpdated at 5.54pm GMT\n\n\n 5.50pm  \n\nPENALTIES: France 1-1 Argentina. Messi rolls slowly down the middle. Just a little bit to the left. Not much, but enough to evade the reach of Lloris. What nerves!\n\n\nUpdated at 5.52pm GMT\n\n\n 5.49pm  \n\nPENALTIES: France 1-0 Argentina. Mbappe lashes towards the top left. Not quite, and Martinez gets fingers to it, but can\u2019t stop it going in.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.52pm GMT\n\n\n 5.48pm  \n\nThat was an astonishing period of extra time. How was it only 3-3?!! But here we are. It\u2019s an awful shame that either Lionel Messi or Kylian Mbappe has to lose. It\u2019s not on, really. But it has to happen. The captains Messi and Lloris both win something at the coin toss. The penalties will be taken at the end packed out with Argentina fans. France get to take their kicks first. Here we go, then!\n\n\n\n 5.45pm  \nEXTRA TIME, FULL TIME: Argentina 3-3 France\n\nMbappe nearly sets the seal on a classic by scoring his fourth, twisting the blood of Romero and Paredes as he dribbles in from the left. Dybala batters clear, just in time, and we\u2019re going to penalty kicks!\n\n\n\n 5.44pm  \n\nET 30 min +3: Huge chances to win it at either end! Kolo Muani is one on one with Martinez, who spreads and makes the save of his life! Then Messi skitters down the right and stands one up for Lautaro Martinez in the middle. He heads wide right from ten yards!\n\n\n\n 5.43pm  \n\nET 30 min +2: Messi and Lautaro Martinez very nearly replicate the Maradona-Burrachaga winning combination of 1986 \u2026 but as Martinez chases down the middle and prepares to shoot, Konate steps up and the offside flag springs up. Lloris kicks away in any case.\n\n\n\n 5.41pm  \n\nET 30 min +1: Both teams make a change with penalty kicks in mind. France replace Kounde with Disasi, while Argentina send on Dybala for Tagliafico.\n\n\n\n 5.40pm  \n\nET 30 min: Nope. France deal with the corner easily enough \u2026 then go up the other end and nearly snatch it at the death! Mbappe crosses from the left. Kolo Muani rises and aims a header towards the top right. Martinez is scrambling, unlikely to get there if it\u2019s on target. But it bounces inches wide of the top corner!\n\n\n\n 5.39pm  \n\nET 29 min: \u2026 so Mbappe becomes only the second player in history to score a hat-trick in the final, after Geoff Hurst in 1966. But there\u2019s no time to think about that, because Acuna wins a corner down the left for Argentina. They couldn\u2019t, could they?\n\n\n\n 5.38pm  \nGOAL! Argentina 3-3 France (Mbappe 118 pen)\n\nThere was some confusion when that penalty was awarded. Was it a free kick? Nope! A penalty. No confusion about the kick itself, though. Mbappe sends Martinez the wrong way and lashes into the left-hand side of the net!\n\n\n\nUpdated at 5.48pm GMT\n\n\n 5.37pm  \nPenalty for France!\n\nET 26 min: The corner\u2019s half cleared. Mbappe, to the left of the D, curls for the top right. Montiel jumps and blocks with his forearm. The referee points to the spot!\n\n\n\n 5.36pm  \n\nET 25 min: Konate, of all people, wins a corner down the right wing. Before it can be taken, Pezzella comes on for Mac Allister.\n\n\n\n 5.35pm  \n\nET 24 min: Camavinga drives down the inside-left channel at Paredes, who, perhaps imagining the Dutch dugout in front of him, ploughs straight through his man at full speed. Cynical as you like, and it nearly kicks off. Just a yellow. \n\n\n\n 5.33pm  \n\nET 23 min: Argentina waste some time near the corner flag.\n\n\n\n 5.33pm  \n\nET 22 min: Martinez, who has been exceptional since coming on, tries to spin Varane down the left wing. He doesn\u2019t quite get past his man, but does enough to force a throw near the corner flag. Varane collapses. Spent. Can\u2019t continue. On comes Konate in his stead.\n\n\n\n 5.31pm  \n\nET 20 min: Martinez was only just onside. Messi only just bundled over the line. VAR checks. But all\u2019s good! Argentina retake the lead, and the stadium takes off into space. What a noise! Messi conducts the crowd as he celebrates. They don\u2019t need any encouragement!\n\n\n\n 5.29pm  \nGOAL! Argentina 3-2 France (Messi 109)\n\nArgentina triangulate down the inside-right channel. Messi slips Martinez into the box down the inside-right channel. Martinez creams a pearler goalwards from a tight angle. Lloris parries, but the rebound falls to Messi, who bundles over the line!\n\n\n\n\nUpdated at 5.36pm GMT\n\n\n 5.28pm  \n\nET 17 min: A long pass down the Argentina right. Lloris, under pressure from the scampering Martinez, comes out of his box to clear for a throw. Then Messi shoots from distance, towards the bottom right, only for Lloris to palm away from the corner.\n\nUpdated at 5.29pm GMT\n\n\n 5.26pm  \n\nArgentina get the second half of extra time underway. They were the better side in extra time in the quarters against the Netherlands, having shipped a two-goal lead late in that game too. They hadn\u2019t repeated the trick this time \u2026 but the introduction of Lautaro Martinez has given them a timely boost. Shades of Viola in the 1994 final?\n\n\n\n 5.24pm  \nEXTRA TIME, HALF TIME: Argentina 2-2 France\n\nLautaro Martinez wants the corner Argentina deserve, but there\u2019s not even time to take the goal kick France don\u2019t.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.29pm GMT\n\n\n 5.23pm  \n\nET 15 min +1: Upamecano denies Martinez again! Martinez races after a long pass down the inside-left channel. He\u2019s clear! But as he shoots, Upamecano\u2019s studs deflect the ball wide left of goal.\n\n\n\n 5.22pm  \n\nET 15 min: Argentina spring into life! Messi one-twos with Lautaro Martinez on the edge of the box. Martinez shoots, only for Upamecano to slide in from nowhere to block. The rebound falls to Montiel, who sends a rising screamer towards the top left. Varane eyebrows bravely out for a corner, from which nothing comes.\n\n\n\n 5.20pm  \n\nET 14 min: Acuna bustles down the left and reaches the edge of the France box, only to hysterically slice his cross into the stand behind the goal.\n\n\n\n 5.20pm  \n\nET 13 min: A double change for Argentina. De Paul and Alvarez make way for Paredes and Lautaro Martinez. What a story it would be if Lautaro Martinez, after all his struggles in this tournament, grabbed the winner the final.\n\n\n\n 5.18pm  \n\nET 11 min: France pin Argentina back. A free kick, then a corner, from the left flank. Eventually the offside flag releases the pressure on Argentina.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.21pm GMT\n\n\n 5.16pm  \n\nET 9 min: Mbappe goes off on a dribble down the left wing. At one point he\u2019s got four men around him, yet still keeps going. Inevitably the numbers prevail, but that\u2019s a determined run, and France look much more positive right now. The way the game\u2019s gone, there\u2019s no wonder in that.\n\n\n\n 5.14pm  \n\nET 7 min: Romero stands on Mbappe\u2019s foot. That\u2019s not a great challenge but the referee is lenient, perhaps because the flag had already gone up for offside.\n\n\n\n 5.13pm  \n\nET 6 min: Fofana comes on for Rabiot. Meanwhile here\u2019s Simon McMahon with the \u201chighlight of the tournament on ITV as Ally McCoist asks, with a straight face: \u2018Has anyone ever scored a hat-trick in a World Cup final?\u2019\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 5.19pm GMT\n\n\n 5.12pm  \n\nET 5 min: Acuna leads with his elbow into an aerial challenge. Just a garden-variety free kick, but Acuna, already on a booking, wants to watch himself here.\n\n\n\n 5.10pm  \n\nET 3 min: Messi, 35, runs hard at Camavinga but can\u2019t get past the 20-year-old. He then tries to rugby tackle the France midfielder, to stop a counter attack, but doesn\u2019t get booked. \u201cI bet Ronaldo has turned the game back on,\u201d quips Victoria Pearson.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.13pm GMT\n\n\n 5.09pm  \n\nET 2 min: Argentina begin the first period of extra time on the front foot. Acuna curls in from the left. Varane clears under pressure from Mac Allister. \u201cScaloni outthought Deschamps with the original lineups, but Deschamps\u2019 rearranging of the French team outfoxed the Argentine,\u201d writes K\u00e1ri Tulinius. \u201cWhatever happens now, Didier has earned his spot in World Cup folklore.\u201d\n\n\n\n 5.07pm  \n\nFrance get the first half of extra time underway. Argentina have made a change, replacing their right-back Molina with Montiel.\n\n\n\n 5.06pm  \n\nLionel Scaloni gathers his shell-shocked troops and presumably gives them the Alf Ramsey you\u2019ve-won-it-once-lads spiel. Messi is his usual inscrutable self. Mbappe meanwhile receives a massage. He\u2019s deserved it. Only one team has ever recovered from a two-goal deficit in a World Cup final: West Germany against in 1954, the Miracle of Bern.\n\n\n\n 5.02pm  \nFULL TIME: Argentina 2-2 France\n\nMessi drops deep and launches a long pass down the left wing. The Maradona-to-Burruchaga dynamic doesn\u2019t quite come off, and we\u2019re going to extra time!\n\n\nUpdated at 5.05pm GMT\n\n\n 5.01pm  \n\n90 min +8: France clear the resulting corner easily enough, then Acuna is booked for cynically scything Coman as he plans to launch a counter.\n\n\n\n 5.00pm  \n\n90 min +7: \u2026 so having said that, they launch what has now become a rare attack. Messi cuts in from the right and his eyes light up. He puts his laces through a riser intended for the top left. It\u2019s on target. Lloris gets a strong hand to tip over. What a story that would have been!\n\n\n\n 4.59pm  \n\n90 min +5: The tension is palpable. Giroud, on the bench, is booked for haranguing the referee. Then Kolo Muaini drives at the Argentinian back line. Argentina swarm him and just about manage to scramble clear. This is wild! Argentina have completely fallen to bits.\n\n\n\n 4.58pm  \n\n90 min +4: The corner\u2019s half cleared. Coman is fouled near the left corner flag. The referee waves play on. Camavinga tees up Rabiot, who slams towards the bottom left. Emi Martinez fumbles, but gathers the loose ball under pressure from the lurking Kolo Muani.\n\n\n\n 4.56pm  \n\n90 min +3: A free kick for France out on the left. Argentina look nervous. They\u2019re fortunate that Mbappe\u2019s delivery is no good. They clear. But France come straight back at them, Mbappe looking to become only the second scorer of a World Cup final hat-trick. He tears towards the France box and sends a rising heatseeker goalwards. It\u2019s deflected over the bar.\n\n\n\n 4.55pm  \n\n90 min +2: Acuna attempts to release Tagliafico into the France box down the left. Too much on the pass. Goal kick. On the bench, Di Maria stares at a spot roughly 1,000 yards in the distance. \u201cMight Scaloni\u2019s decision to take off Di Maria turn out like Ramsey\u2019s subbing off Bobby Charlton in 1970 in the quarter final?\u201d wonders David Wall.\n\n\n\n 4.54pm  \n\n90 min +1: France certainly look the more likely to find a winner in added time. But there\u2019s no point trying to second guess this match.\n\n\n\n 4.53pm  \n\n90 min: There will be eight added minutes.\n\n\n\n 4.53pm  \n\n89 min: A couple of players down, requiring treatment. So they\u2019re showing replays of the Mbappe equaliser. Mbappe really caught the shot \u2013 it was an exceptional volley \u2013 but Emi Martinez got a good hand to it. It\u2019s not an error, but how close did he come to stopping both Mbappe\u2019s goals? The thin line between success and failure at the very pinnacle of sport.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.00pm GMT\n\n\n 4.50pm  \n\n87 min: Argentinian hearts in mouths as Thuram goes over Fernandez\u2019s leg in their box. Screams for a penalty, but in fact it\u2019s a yellow card for Thuram, who instigated the contact by hanging out a leg and dived.\n\n\n\n 4.49pm  \n\n86 min: Mbappe will get all the headlines, but France\u2019s first-half subs Kolo Muani and Thuram have made a huge impression on this game. What a call by Deschamps that was, however this ends.\n\n\n\n 4.47pm  \n\n84 min: The momentum has completely shifted Mbappe finds space down the left and curls towards Kolo Muani at the far post. Kolo Muani can\u2019t get his head onto the ball, six yards out, but there wasn\u2019t much in it.\n\n\n\n 4.46pm  \n\n83 min: This is simply astonishing! Three minutes ago, France looked down and out! But suddenly they found something from somewhere \u2013 assisted by Otamendi\u2019s hesitance \u2013 and this is 1986 all over again. Can Argentina recover like they did back then?\n\n\n\n 4.45pm  \nGOAL! Argentina 2-2 France (Mbappe 81)\n\nComan robs Messi in the midfield, out on the right. The ball\u2019s shuttled across the pitch to Mbappe. He one-twos with Thuram down the inside-left channel. He meets the dropping return first time, and sweeps into the bottom right! What drama here!\n\n\n\nUpdated at 4.54pm GMT\n\n\n 4.44pm  \n\n81 min: That really came out of nowhere \u2026 and now French tails are up. And would you believe this \u2026\n\n\n\n 4.43pm  \nGOAL! Argentina 2-1 France (Mbappe 80 pen)\n\nMbappe sends the penalty into the bottom left. It\u2019s not perfect, and Emi Martinez gets fingers to it, but the keeper can\u2019t stop it and this is back on!\n\n\nUpdated at 4.48pm GMT\n\n\n 4.42pm  \nPenalty for France!\n\n79 min: Hello! Hello! Kolo Muani bustles his way past Otamendi down the inside-left channel and enters the box. Otamendi tries to battle his way back, but can\u2019t get goalside and brings his man down. All of a sudden, a chink of light for France! Mbappe to take.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.45pm GMT\n\n\n 4.40pm  \n\n77 min: De Paul has been kicked from pillar to post this afternoon, and he takes another for the team. Camavinga skittles him out on the right, and there\u2019s another opportunity to eat up some clock. Argentina have earned it.\n\n\n\n 4.39pm  \n\n76 min: Tonight\u2019s attendance: a full house of 88,966. The highest attendance at a final since Roberto Baggio launched that penalty into the Pasadena sky in 1994.\n\n\n\n 4.37pm  \n\n74 min: Not today, though. Tchouameni barges into Romero, and the Argentinian takes the opportunity to stay down, catch his breath, and let the clock tick on.\n\n\n\n 4.36pm  \n\n73 min: As mentioned earlier, Argentina have shipped a two-goal lead in a World Cup final before. Karl-Heinz Rummenigge sparked a (brief) West German comeback after 74 minutes in 1986. Just saying.\n\n\n\n 4.35pm  \n\n72 min: Messi has been quiet in this second half, but suddenly pops up on the left-hand edge of the French box, dribbles infield, then tees up Fernandez, whose curler towards the top right is weak and easily gathered by Lloris.\n\n\n\n 4.34pm  \n\n71 min: Another double change for France, as Griezmann and Hernandez make way for Coman and Camavinga.\n\n\n\n 4.33pm  \n\n70 min: Mbappe dribbles in from the left and shoots over the bar. France are asking a couple of questions now.\n\n\n\n 4.31pm  \n\n68 min: The resulting corner is whipped in from the left. Kolo Muani meets it six yards out at the near post, but shoulders it wide. That was a decent chance. For all Argentina\u2019s dominance, one goal would change everything.\n\n\n\n 4.30pm  \n\n67 min: Hernandez curls in low from the left. Otamendi, under pressure from the lurking Thuram, shanks a panicked clearance over the bar. For the first time this evening, France are suddenly carrying a little threat.\n\n\n\n 4.29pm  \n\n66 min: Griezmann finds a second out on the left wing and fizzes a low cross through the Argentina six-yard box. There\u2019s nobody in bleu to poke home.\n\n\n\n 4.28pm  \n\n64 min: That was a well-timed challenge by Upamecano. Any more force, and it could have been another penalty. Just enough pressure to put Mac Allister off. Meanwhile Di Maria, having run himself into the ground, is replaced by Acuna. What a game he\u2019s had!\n\n\n\n 4.26pm  \n\n63 min: Mac Allister storms down the middle, chasing a Messi pass, and plays a long-distance one-two with Alvarez. Mac Allister nearly gets on the end of the return, by the penalty spot, but Upamecano leans gently on him to put him off, and Lloris hacks clear.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.34pm GMT\n\n\n 4.24pm  \n\n62 min: France still haven\u2019t had an attempt on goal. Argentina have had nine, with five on target.\n\n\n\n 4.24pm  \n\n60 min: Di Maria causes all manner of bother down the left. He crosses low. Messi, 12 yards out and level with the right-hand post, takes a touch and prepares to shoot. This could be it! Rabiot slides across to get a toe on the ball. Messi is still able to shoot, but Rabiot\u2019s intervention causes him to poke wide right. That\u2019s kept France in the game.\n\n\n\n 4.22pm  \n\n59 min: Alvarez works his way down the inside-left channel and has a dig from a tight angle. It\u2019s probably going wide, but Lloris gets down well to smother, just in case.\n\n\n\n 4.21pm  \n\n58 min: Mbappe petulantly clips De Paul on the ankle. Just a free kick, but France are in danger of losing the collective head here.\n\n\n\n 4.21pm  \n\n57 min: Kounde romps down the right with purpose. He\u2019s forced to turn tail, but lays off to Kolo Muani, who takes his turn to run towards the Argentina box. He\u2019s unceremoniously \u2013 but legally \u2013 stopped by Tagliafico on the edge of the box. Tagliafico wasn\u2019t moving anywhere. What a challenge! Not an inch given.\n\n\n\n 4.18pm  \n\n56 min: Thankfully, although De Paul felt that, he\u2019s able to continue.\n\n\n\n 4.18pm  \n\n55 min: Rabiot is booked for an awful scissor tackle on De Paul\u2019s standing leg. That could have been really nasty, and the France midfielder is lucky not to have been sent packing. That was a potential leg-breaker.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.21pm GMT\n\n\n 4.17pm  \n\n54 min: Now it\u2019s Argentina\u2019s turn to win a corner down the right. They take their sweet time over it. Griezmann clears at the near post. France counter. A long ball. Emi Martinez comes out of his box to blooter clear, only to slice comedically. He\u2019s fortunate the ball doesn\u2019t drop to a France player. That could have been extremely embarrassing.\n\n\n\n 4.15pm  \n\n52 min: Griezmann loops the corner straight down Emi Martinez\u2019s throat. A confident claim nevertheless. The aforementioned Giroud, incidentally, was beyond angry upon being hooked in the first half. A lot of water-bottle-bothering antics and effing and jeffing in the expressive Gallic style.\n\n\n\n 4.14pm  \n\n51 min: Kolo Muani works hard to get the ball off Otamendi, and sends Mbappe into space down the right. He wins a corner. Where\u2019s Giroud? Oh.\n\n\n\n 4.12pm  \n\n49 min: Di Maria wants that man-of-the-match award all right, and nearly registers another assist with a raking cross from the left. De Paul comes in from the opposite side and batters a first-time shot straight at Lloris. He caught that well. A wee bit either to the left or right, and Lloris would have had some work to do.\n\n\n\n 4.11pm  \n\n47 min: \u2026 so that was very nearly a horror start to the second half for France. Another goal and that\u2019s surely it. They look bereft of energy. If they don\u2019t find something, expect plenty of chat about the bug that reportedly tore its way through the squad this week.\n\n\n\n 4.09pm  \n\n46 min: Messi runs at a worryingly tatty looking French back line. He slips a ball down the left channel for Alvarez, who cuts inside and considers shooting from distance. Instead he feeds Fernandez on the right. A cross is claimed by Lloris, with Mac Allister not too far away from connecting.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.13pm GMT\n\n\n 4.08pm  \n\nArgentina get the second half underway. No further changes. Didier Deschamps has been here before, in a way: his team are playing like Brazil did when his France team went in 2-0 up at the break en route to glory in 1998. Argentina surely won\u2019t be taking anything for granted, though: they were two up and coasting in 1986, only for West Germany to hit them with a quick double whammy to level things up. They still won that final, of course, but you can bet your last shiny bronze centime they wouldn\u2019t fancy going through the wringer like that again today.\n\nUpdated at 4.36pm GMT\n\n\n 3.56pm  \nWho are you supporting?\n\nAs the World Cup draws to a close, we\u2019d like to thank you for reading. We\u2019ve published hundreds of thousands of words, covered all 64 matches, more than 160 goals, not to mention penalty shootouts (four), red cards (also four), and Fifa own goals (too many to mention).\nSo if we ask you today \u2018who are you supporting?\u2019, we\u2019d like to think the answer might be \u2018The Guardian\u2019.\nShow your appreciation for our honest, straight, independent journalism today. It depends on readers like you.\nSupport the Guardian today \u2013 it only takes a minute. Thank you.\n\n\n\n 3.55pm  \nHALF TIME: Argentina 2-0 France\n\nNo more than Argentina deserve. They\u2019re 45 minutes plus stoppages away from their third World Cup. Lionel Messi is 45 minutes plus stoppages away from completing football.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.04pm GMT\n\n\n 3.53pm  \n\n45 min +8: Griezmann swings the free kick in from a deep position on the right. He can\u2019t find Varane at the far stick. Goal kick, and at long last from a French perspective, that\u2019ll be the end of the first half.\n\n\n\n 3.52pm  \n\n45 min +7: Fernandez is booked for a cynical clatter into an in-flight Kolo Muani.\n\n\n\n 3.51pm  \n\n45 min +5: Griezmann, so influential during France\u2019s run to the final, has seen very little of the ball. He\u2019s beaten to it easily in the midfield by Fernandez, who blooters upfield. The first half in microcosm: Argentina have been wonderfully intense; France utterly flaccid.\n\n\n\n 3.49pm  \n\n45 min +4: France have seen more of the ball since the double change. Argentina sitting back, perhaps, so they can work out what\u2019s what.\n\n\n\n 3.47pm  \n\n45 min +2: Thuram busies himself down the left and troubles the Argentinian back line. His promising work is undone when he lays off to Hernandez, who brushes De Paul with his studs. Free kick, and the rare bit of French pressure is released.\n\n\n\n 3.45pm  \n\n45 min: There will be seven added first-half minutes.\n\n\n\n 3.43pm  \n\n43 min: Say what you like about Deschamps, that\u2019s a brave call in a World Cup final all right. At least he won\u2019t leave Qatar wondering. Mbappe is now leading the line for France.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.09pm GMT\n\n\n 3.42pm  \n\n41 min: Well, what about this? Didier Deschamps isn\u2019t waiting for half-time to change things. Off come Dembele, who has been off it today from the start, and Giroud, who has reportedly been struggling with a knee problem. On in their place: Thuram and Kolo Muani.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.46pm GMT\n\n\n 3.40pm  \n\n40 min: France can hardly get a touch. They could do with hearing the half-time whistle. \u201cMessi is going to win the Golden Boot on pens, just as Megan Rapinoe did in 2019,\u201d writes Tracy Mohr. \u201cShe has better hair though.\u201d\n\n\n\n 3.39pm  \n\n38 min: Messi is this close to tearing into acres of space down the right. France are extremely fortunate that Upamecano reads the danger, comes across, and stands firm to ease his man off the ball.\n\n\n\n 3.38pm  \n\n37 min: This scoreline doesn\u2019t flatter Argentina at all. It kind of flatters France if anything. The French simply haven\u2019t turned up! Argentina are playing like they feel the World Cup is their destiny. Di Maria is already in tears.\n\n\n\n 3.37pm  \nGOAL! Argentina 2-0 France (Di Maria 36)\n\nTalk about justifying your selection! Mac Allister, in his own half, finds Messi to the right of the centre circle. Messi plays a ball around the corner and down the right for Alavez, who instantly releases Mac Allister along the wing. France are all over the shop in the middle. Mac Allister swings a low pass across to Di Maria, coming in from the other flank. He strides into the box and, from the left-hand corner of the six-yard box, whistles a shot across Lloris and into the bottom right! What a sensational team goal!\n\n\n\n\nUpdated at 4.02pm GMT\n\n\n 3.35pm  \n\n35 min: Mbappe nearly gets the better of Molina down the left but can\u2019t win a footrace into the box.\n\n\n\n 3.34pm  \n\n34 min: France have yet to register an attempt at goal. Argentina are in charge.\n\n\n\n 3.33pm  \n\n32 min: Mac Allister takes a whack from great distance that goes out for a throw. Full marks for ambition. \n\n\n\n 3.31pm  \n\n31 min: Argentina look in total control right now. France are strangely shapeless.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.55pm GMT\n\n\n 3.30pm  \n\n29 min: Messi dribbles down the right at great speed. Thoughts of what Messi did to Josko Gvardiol of Croatia must be going through Hernandez\u2019s mind, but the defender stands firm, limiting the damage to a corner. The set piece is fired towards the near post, where Giroud does some staunch defensive work to clear.\n\n\n\n 3.28pm  \n\n27 min: Griezmann curls the ball into the mixer. It\u2019s half cleared. Hernandez and Fernandez compete for the ball in mid-air and both go down in a crumpled heap. Free kick to Argentina \u2013 Hernandez was a little bit late, though the collision seemed accidental \u2013 and thankfully both players are back up and running again soon enough.\n\n\n\n 3.26pm  \n\n26 min: France look to bounce back quickly. Giroud works his way down the inside-right channel and is checked by Romero. A free kick just to the right of goal, 30 yards out. Griezmann stands over it.\n\n\n\n 3.25pm  \n\n25 min: There was plenty of wild celebration in the stands when Messi arrogantly \u2013 in a good way \u2013 stroked that penalty home. Fair to say Argentina are enjoying the lion\u2019s share of support in the stadium.\n\n\n\n 3.24pm  \n\n24 min: The penalty may have been a little bit soft, but the lead is no more than Argentina deserve.\n\n\n\n 3.23pm  \nGOAL! Argentina 1-0 France (Messi 23 pen)\n\nMessi strolls up to the spot. He gives Lloris the eyes. Lloris blinks first. Messi rolls the ball into the bottom right, having sent the keeper the other way. The stadium erupts!\n\n\n\n\nUpdated at 3.33pm GMT\n\n\n 3.22pm  \n\n22 min: VAR checks, but there\u2019s no clear an obvious error. Messi to step up.\n\n\n\n 3.22pm  \nPenalty for Argentina!\n\n21 min: The ball pinballs around the edge of the France box. Alvarez pings it cleverly towards Di Maria on the left. Di Maria dribbles his way past Dembele and enters the box. He goes down. He was looking for it, but there\u2019s a little bit of contact from Dembele, who had put his arm on his opponent from behind. The referee points to the spot. Penalty!\n\n\nUpdated at 3.32pm GMT\n\n\n 3.20pm  \n\n19 min: Griezmann whips the free kick to the far post. Giroud powers a header over the bar from six yards, but only after clambering over Di Maria to get to the ball. Free kick.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.25pm GMT\n\n\n 3.19pm  \n\n18 min: Hernandez drops a shoulder to make good down the left. He\u2019s heading for the byline when he\u2019s crudely clattered by De Paul. A free kick here just to the side of the Argentina box. \u201cProbably a wise move by Lloris to ditch his Dutch-looking orange kit for a yellow one,\u201d writes Peter Oh. \u201cNo need to unnecessarily rile up the already amped-up opposition.\u201d\n\n\n\n 3.17pm  \n\n17 min: Messi slips De Paul into space down the right. De Paul cuts back for Messi, who fresh-airs his attempt at a first-time shot. Whether that\u2019s better or worse than the manner in which Di Maria then shins wildly over the bar is a moot point.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.22pm GMT\n\n\n 3.16pm  \n\n16 min: Argentina have enjoyed 48 percent possession so far. France are on 39, while the ever-mysterious IN Contest has snaffled 13.\n\n\n\n 3.15pm  \n\n14 min: Argentina counter. Messi dribbles purposefully towards the France box and slides a diagonal pass down the left to release Di Maria into the box. But Di Maria is miles offside. Argentina will be far the happier at the minute.\n\n\n\n 3.14pm  \n\n13 min: A first touch for Mbappe, who probes down the left, then suddenly instigates a one-two with Rabiot. The return ball down the channel is too heavy and easy for Emi Martinez to gather.\n\n\n\n 3.13pm  \n\n12 min: Di Maria has been a complete handful since the get-go. Another ball in from the left finds Messi, but the little genius doesn\u2019t have enough space in which to work a shooting opportunity. France close ranks.\n\n\n\n 3.12pm  \n\n11 min: A worrying couple of minutes for France as Lloris is checked over. He\u2019s good to continue, but not very happy with the challenge by his Tottenham teammate. Not sure Romero could do much about it \u2013 he had been shoved from behind by Upamecano \u2013 but Lloris gives the referee the what-for anyway.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.13pm GMT\n\n\n 3.10pm  \n\n9 min: The corner leads to a tense game of head tennis in the French box. Rabiot half clears. Another aerial battle. Upamecano barges into Romero, who dominoes his way into the leaping Lloris. The France keeper and captain cops an elbow in the ribs from Romero. Down he goes, and on comes the trainer.\n\n\n\n 3.08pm  \n\n8 min: Messi sets Argentina on the attack with a clever pass from the centre circle to release Mac Allister down the left. He feeds Di Maria, who cuts back for De Paul. A shot from the edge of the D is deflected wide right. Had that gone on target, Lloris was rooted to the spot and beaten.\n\n\n\n 3.07pm  \n\n7 min: France steady themselves with some patient possession in the middle of the park.\n\n\n\n 3.05pm  \n\n5 min: A cheeky back-heel by Alvarez down the inside-left channel. He\u2019s teed up Mac Allister, who aims a powerful arrow straight at Lloris from 25 yards. Easy for the keeper. This is a bright start by Argentina; not so positive from France. Early days of course.\n\n\n\n 3.04pm  \n\n4 min: Upamecano leaps all over the back of Messi to win a header and now it\u2019s 1-1 in lectures from the referee.\n\n\n\n 3.03pm  \n\n3 min: Di Maria digs out a cross from an unpromising position on the left. De Paul and Messi combine to the right of the D. The ball\u2019s scooped through to Alvarez, who attempts to poke into the bottom left while on the turn. An easy claim for Lloris, and Alvarez was offside anyway. But that was cute play from Argentina.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.09pm GMT\n\n\n 3.02pm  \n\n2 min: The first lecture of the match as De Paul needlessly shoves Rabiot in the back. The referee\u2019s not happy, and tells him in no uncertain terms to rein it in.\n\n\n\n 3.00pm  \n\nFrance get the 2022 World Cup final underway. Griezmann back to Tchouameni, who launches long. Throw for Argentina. The only way is up.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.05pm GMT\n\n\n 3.00pm  \n\nAnthem passion-o-meter\u2122. Lionel\u2019s goes up to 11. He gives it plenty. Full pipes. Kylian, singing along with a cheeky smile, just about managed to stop himself bursting out with laughter.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.11pm GMT\n\n\n 2.55pm  \n\nThe teams are out! Argentina in their albiceleste, France their bleu. It\u2019s all too beautiful on this lazy Sunday afternoon. There\u2019s a wild anticipatory atmosphere at the Lusail Iconic Stadium; it\u2019s the World Cup final all right! Once the anthems and all other pre-match folderol are complete, edition number 22 will be underway. It really is on!\n\n\nUpdated at 2.58pm GMT\n\n\n 2.54pm  \n\nPre-match postbag II. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole card-deck of reasons why we could all live with Messi being on the losing side; I guess the most poignant is that then he would be remembered, as was Don Bradman, as having achieved all but the very final touch to his sport\u2019s greatest career. In a sense, that\u2019s one step more memorable than perfection itself. I admit that he might not be quite of the same mind\u201d \u2013 Charles Antaki\n\u201cThe philosopher Isaiah Berlin once wrote that great authors can be categorized as either hedgehogs, who have one big idea and fit everything to it, or foxes, who distrust big ideas and work from experience. In football the image of the great manager is the hedgehog type, Guardiola, Lobanovskyi, Michels and so on. Deschamps is not like that. Each tournament, his France play in a different style. Like Ancelotti, Ferguson and Happel, Didier is a fox.\u201d \u2013 K\u00e1ri Tulinius\n\u201cAs exciting as this game will be, I saw Musk and Beckham arrive at stadium. That sums it up, money is the number one driving force behind these competitions\u201d \u2013 Jeff Sachs\n\n\n\n 2.45pm  \n\nThe final edition of the popular PENNANT WATCH. Argentina win it hands down. Just look at this beauty (not pictured).\n\nAs for the French one \u2026 thankfully, so this isn\u2019t a total fiasco, there is a photo of their finale pennant. And yes, it\u2019s all right, you can never go wrong with the tricolore, though there\u2019s a sense of the FA\u2019s it\u2019ll-do abomination about the whole thing. Will it do? Juste \u00e0 propos de.\n\n\n\n\n 2.37pm  \n\nPre-match postbag. \u201cFor all the talk about Messi and Mbappe, there\u2019s also been (well-deserved) focus on Griezmann and the different role he\u2019s played here from previous tournaments and at club level. But what has surprised me about that focus is people\u2019s surprise that he is so defensively aware. This is a guy who has spent half his career with Atletico Madrid, being coached by Diego Simeone. It would have been almost impossible for him not to have learnt about defensive positioning in particular, even stood at the other end of the pitch during training sessions. Kieran Trippier said how much he learnt about defending while at Atletico and he was only there for 18 months. Griezmann could probably teach Deschamps a thing or two about that role, rather than the other way round, given how much time he\u2019s been learning from Simeone\u201d - David Wall\n\u201cAlthough I will only be \u2018watching\u2019 by means of your perceptive eyes, I am hoping it will be a good match, for everyone\u2019s sake, but most of all that Argentina win. At least then we get the \u2018was Messi better than Maradona\u2019 arguments out of the way: they will be equals\u201d \u2013 Jeremy Boyce\n\u201cThanks for introducing the world to the word \u2018nyaff\u2019, the perfect noun for Putin. Could you please now describe Infantino as a \u2018bauchle\u2019?\u201d - Gordon in Ayr\n\n\n\n 2.31pm  \n\n\u2026 and to complete a tuneful triptych, here\u2019s the latest from our man on the spot.\n\n\n\n\n\n 2.20pm  \n\nWhile we\u2019re on the subject of music, here are the national anthems that\u2019ll stir the soul before kick-off. As Vanesa Valenti of La Nacion wrote in our pre-tournament guide to Argentina \u2026\n\n\nThe Himno Nacional Argentino was written by the clearly multi-talented politician Vicente L\u00f3pez y Planes and the music composed by Blas Parera and approved by the general constituent assembly in 1813. Initially it included a strong anti-Spanish sentiment, which was taken out in 1924. It starts \u201cHear, mortals, the sacred cry: \u2018Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!\u2019 Hear the sound of broken chains. See noble equality enthroned.\u201d But because of the anthem\u2019s length often at sporting events only the instrumental intro is played.\n\n\u2026 and as Adam White and Eric Devin write for Get French Football News wrote in our pre-tournament guide to France \u2026\n\n\nAn early (the earliest?) example of the \u201cEuropean march\u201d style of anthems, La Marseillaise is arguably the world\u2019s most recognisable and stirring. Written in 1792 by Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle in Strasbourg, its lyrics were meant to encourage soldiers to defend France against foreign incursions. It gained its popular name when it was adopted by soldiers who marched from Marseille to Paris to aid in the capital\u2019s defence, and became the anthem in 1795. While it was later banned under Napoleon, it was reinstalled permanently in the late 19th century.\n\n\n\n\n 2.14pm  \n\nThe closing ceremony has taken place. A celebratory \u201cmash-up of songs from the World Cup Qatar 2022 Official Soundtrack\u201d performed by Aisha, Ozuna, Gims, Nora Fatehi, Balqees, Rahma Riad and Manal. Tracks included Hayya Hayya (Better Together), Arhbo, Sepp\u2019s Gonna Sexx Ya Up, Gianni\u2019s Gotta Grind and Light the Sky.\n\n\n\n 2.05pm  \n\nToday\u2019s referee, Szymon Marciniak, will become the first Pole to take charge of a World Cup final. The 41-year-old has already officiated matches involving Argentina and France during this World Cup. In the groups, he took charge of France 2-1 Denmark, booking Jules Kound\u00e9 for standing on Victor Nelsson\u2019s ankle, while in the round of 16 he whistled his way through Argentina 2-1 Australia without dishing out a single card.\nMarciniak has quite the back story, as Robert Holmes explains: \u201cI\u2019ll be watching today\u2019s game in Dublin with my good friend from Poland, Karolina. She\u2019s not just a football nut, she also into referees (no idea) and is particularly excited for today\u2019s game due to the man in the middle, Szymon Marciniak, hailing from her native land. \n\u201cShe\u2019s been telling me his origin story: as an undisciplined amateur player, he picked up a red card and gave the ref some backchat. The ref in question duly gave him the old \u2018if you think you\u2019re so clever why don\u2019t you become a ref and show us how it\u2019s done\u2019 line. Challenge accepted, this he duly did and today he\u2019s reffing the biggest match of them all. I can tell you, this Pole sitting beside me here is bursting with pride.\u201d\n\n\n\n 1.59pm  \n\nLionel Messi makes his 26th appearance for Argentina at the World Cup finals, breaking the all-time men\u2019s record in doing so. There\u2019s only one change to their starting XI from the semi-final against Croatia. Angel Di Maria \u2013 who hadn\u2019t started since the group win over Poland, and played only eight minutes in the quarter-final victory over the Netherlands \u2013 takes the place of Leandro Paredes as Lionel Scaloni moves to a 4-3-3.\n\nFrance coach Didier Deschamps goes back to the 4-2-3-1 starting XI named for the quarter-final victory over England. Dayot Upamecano and Adrien Rabiot both return having recovered from a virus, meaning Ibrahima Konat\u00e9 and Youssouf Fofana step down. Hugo Lloris becomes the first goalkeeper to make 20 appearances at the finals.\n\nUpdated at 2.07pm GMT\n\n\n 1.47pm  \nThe teams\n\nArgentina: Emiliano Martinez, Molina, Romero, Otamendi, Tagliafico, Di Maria, De Paul, Fernandez, Mac Allister, Messi, Alvarez.Subs: Armani, Foyth, Montiel, Paredes, Pezzella, Acuna, Rulli, Palacios, Correa, Almada, Gomez, Rodriguez, Dybala, Lisandro Martinez, Lautaro Martinez.\nFrance: Lloris, Kounde, Varane, Upamecano, Theo Hernandez, Tchouameni, Rabiot, Dembele, Griezmann, Mbappe, Giroud.Subs: Pavard, Disasi, Guendouzi, Muani, Fofana, Veretout, Mandanda, Saliba, Coman, Areola, Konate, Camavinga, Thuram.\nReferee: Szymon Marciniak (Poland).\n\n\n\n 1.45pm  \n\nThe golden boot. Four players in this match are in with a shout of ending the tournament as the leading scorer. If two or more players finish with the same number of goals, assists will decide the winner. If that doesn\u2019t produce a result, the player with the fewest minutes played will bag the prize.\n5 goalsLionel Messi (Argentina): three assists, 570 minutes playedKylian Mbappe (France): two assists, 477 minutes played \n4 goalsJulian Alvarez (Argentina): no assists, 364 minutes playedOlivier Giroud (France): no assists, 383 minutes played\n\n\n\n 1.40pm  \n\nOnly four players have scored in more than one World Cup final: Vav\u00e1 (1958 and 1962), Pel\u00e9 (1958 and 1970), Paul Breitner (1974 and 1982) and Zinedine Zidane (1998 and 2006). Antoine Griezmann and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, both on the scoresheet in 2018. have a chance to add their name to that exclusive list tonight.\n\n\n\n 1.30pm  \n\nThe Fifa World Cup roll of honour. Should Argentina win, they\u2019ll become the first country from outside Europe to lift the trophy since Brazil, 20 years ago in Japan. Should France prevail, they\u2019ll be the first side to retain the trophy since Brazil, 60 years ago in Chile. Either way, someone will be winning their third World Cup, which will fill the currently vacant 3 slot on this list, therefore making it more structurally pleasing to the eye.\n5: Brazil (1958, 1962, 1970, 1994, 2002)4: Italy (1934, 1938, 1982, 2006), Germany (1954, 1974, 1990, 2014)2: Uruguay (1930, 1950), Argentina (1978, 1986), France (1998, 2018)1: England (1966), Spain (2010)\n\n\n\n 1.20pm  \n\nThe head-to-head between the countries reads Argentina six wins, France three, and three draws. Eight of those games were friendlies, however, while another was a goalless draw at a 1972 tournament designed to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Brazilian Declaration of Independence. Let\u2019s not go down any of those rococo rabbit holes, and instead concentrate on the three showdowns that really matter: the only previous times Argentina and France have met at the World Cup.\n1930: Argentina 1-0 FranceThe French had just beaten Mexico 4-1 in a match that kicked off concurrently with USA-Belgium in another group; those two games were the first-ever World Cup matches. Two days on, they faced a fresher Argentina, and as if being knackered wasn\u2019t enough, were effectively down to ten men after two minutes when Luisito Monti crocked Lucien Laurent (who clearly had used up all his luck when scoring the first-ever World Cup goal against Mexico). Monti went on to score the game\u2019s only goal from a direct free kick nine minutes from time. Argentina went on to lose in the final.\n1978: Argentina 2-1 FranceA pivotal game in a group also containing Italy and Hungary. Marius Tr\u00e9sor was in the process of tackling Leopoldo Luque while falling over when the ball hit his arm from close range. Daniel Passarella dispatched the controversially awarded penalty on the stroke of half time. Michel Platini equalised on the hour, following home after Bernard Lacombe\u2019s delicate chip over keeper Ubaldo Fillol came back off the bar. The decider came on 73 minutes when Luque crashed home from the edge of the box. France were on their way back home, Argentina en route to the title.\n2018: France 4-3 ArgentinaIt was Kylian Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s time. Had Lionel Messi\u2019s passed?\n\n\n\nUpdated at 1.21pm GMT\n\n\n 1.00pm  \nPreamble\n\nWelcome to the Guardian\u2019s minute-by-minute coverage of the 64th and final match of the 22nd Fifa World Cup: Argentina versus France. One of these great footballing nations will tonight win the biggest prize of all for the third time in their illustrious history. It\u2019ll be Argentina\u2019s sixth appearance in the final; France will compete in their fourth. Where shall we begin, then? There\u2019s only one place \u2026\n1930: Uruguay 4-2 Argentina\u2026 and it\u2019s the first-ever World Cup final at the Centenario in Montevideo! Argentina led Uruguay 2-1 at half time through winger Carlos Peucelle and pencil-moustached striker Guillermo St\u00e1bile, but the hosts came back at them in the second half. H\u00e9ctor Castro, who lost half an arm to a chainsaw while a teenager, crowned a 4-2 win for Uruguay. St\u00e1bile would have to make do with being the tournament\u2019s leading scorer. Argentinian midfielder Juan Evaristo played this match in a beret.\n\n1978: Argentina 3-1 Netherlands (aet; 1-1 after 90 mins)Argentina 78 was every bit as controversial as Qatar 22, played against a grim backdrop: General Videla\u2019s military junta, the Disappeared, accusations of bribery. Step in self-proclaimed socialist C\u00e9sar Luis Menotti, the manager doing it for the people. His efforts nearly didn\u2019t get their reward, Netherlands striker Rob Rensenbrink coming within the width of the left-hand post of winning the final for the Dutch in injury time. Argentina escaped, and Mario Kempes spurred the hosts to extra-time victory on a pitch littered with ticker tape. Argentina finally got their hands on the World Cup, nearly half a century after coming so close first time around.\n\n1986: Argentina 3-2 West GermanyThis was a fairly one-sided affair for 74 minutes, Jose Luis Brown and Jorge Valdano putting Argentina two goals up. But then a couple of Andy Brehme corners from the left turned the game. First Karl-Heinz Rummenigge tapped home, then Rudi Voller scrambled an equaliser for West Germany on 82 minutes. The game was suddenly in the balance \u2026 for three minutes, after which the previously quiet but utterly irrepressible Diego Maradona slipped a delightful through ball to Jorge Burrachaga, who had an awful long time to think about missing, but didn\u2019t. Argentina had their second World Cup, a mere eight years after claiming their first.\n\n1990: West Germany 1-0 ArgentinaArgentina at Italia \u201890 is one of the great under-rated World Cup campaigns. Maradona sashayed through the entire tournament metaphorically flicking Vs left, right and centre. He turned goalkeeper against the USSR and got away with it. He did for fierce rivals Brazil with one of the great assists, setting up Claudio Caniggia while being mugged and playing with a dodgy foot. He missed a quarter-final penalty against Yugoslavia, but then in the semi at his home club ground in Naples, put another in exactly the same place to knock out Italy, a country he\u2019d nearly plunged into civil war during the run-up to the game with some hilariously brazen north-south divide-and-rule you-belong-to-me mind games. The final was a step too far, however. West Germany were too good, and the referee wasn\u2019t having any of Pedro Monzon and Gustavo Dezotti\u2019s nonsense. Off you go, lads. Thanks to a late Brehme penalty, the Germans had their third World Cup. Argentina could console themselves with having irritated purists and hipsters worldwide. Hats off to them for that. A bravura performance.\n\n1998: France 3-0 BrazilFrance had twice previously fallen at the semi-final stage in spectacular fashion: 5-2 to Brazil in 1958, in a game in which Vav\u00e1 crocked captain Robert Jonquet after 26 minutes; then in 1982 on penalties after an exhilarating 3-3 draw with West Germany, during which Toni Schumacher nearly killed Patrick Battiston. They\u2019d also failed to turn up for the semi-final rematch with West Germany in 1986, but the less said about that 2-0 elongated yawn the better. So it was fourth semi lucky on home soil in 1998, when Lilian Thuram\u2019s uncharacteristic goalscoring heroics turned things around against Croatia. Zinedine Zidane took up the attacking slack in the final against Brazil with a couple of first-half headers, Emmanuel Petit wrapping up a 3-0 win during the last knockings. The team became poster boys for the new multi-cultural France, and this may just be the first precis of the 1998 final that doesn\u2019t take a deep dive into the subject of Ronaldo\u2019s pre-match fitness.\n\n2006: Italy 1-1 France (aet; 1-1 after 90 mins; Italy won 5-3 on pens)Zinedine Zidane nearly missed a Panenka, then stuck the nut on Italy\u2019s Marco Materazzi. Beauty is truth, truth beauty, and that is all ye need to know.\n\n2014: Germany 1-0 Argentina (aet; 0-0 after 90 mins)Argentina had laboured to a semi-final victory on penalties against the Netherlands, while Germany had done a number \u2013 specifically the number seven \u2013 on hosts Brazil. Lionel Messi wasn\u2019t really at the top of his game during these finals, either, so with the benefit of 20-20 hindsight, the result of this match seems inevitable. And yet. Gonzalo Higuain missed a golden chance to put Argentina ahead in the first half. He had an effort disallowed for offside. Rodrigo Palacio floated a chip off target while one on one with Manuel Neuer. Messi duelled with Neuer as well, only to drag dismally wide. Mario Goetze made them pay. To add insult to injury, an understandably seething Messi was forced to hang around interminably post-defeat to be presented with the player-of-the-tournament award. Oh Sepp. How could you be so tactless.\n\n2018: France 4-2 CroatiaThe highest-scoring final since 1966 had pretty much everything. Mario Mand\u017euki\u0107 scored the first-ever own goal in the showpiece\u2019s history. Ivan Perisic equalised for Croatia with a pearler. France regained the lead through VAR, then pulled away with a spectacular quickfire second-half double through Paul Pogba and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9. Hugo Lloris handed Mand\u017euki\u0107 a little redemption on a plate, after which the heavens opened during the trophy presentation on Croatian president Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovi\u0107 and her French counterpart Emmanuel Macron. Vladimir Putin was given an umbrella to stand under, though, the wee nyaff.\n\nSo that\u2019s the historical context as the 2022 final looms. Not long now! Kick-off is at 3pm GMT, 7pm at the Lusail Iconic Stadium in Lusail, Qatar, midday in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and 4pm in Paris, France. \u064a\u062d\u062f\u062b! It\u2019s on!\n\nUpdated at 1.25pm GMT\n"

                    "body": "Netherlands (3-4-1-2) Andries Noppert (GK) Was brave to deny Tim Ream three minutes into the second half and made a couple of decent first-half saves. 7/10 Jurri\u00ebn Timber (CB) A decent night\u2019s work for the 21-year-old Ajax defender. Unruffled but never truly tested. 6 Virgil van Dijk (CB) Arguably started the move for Depay\u2019s slick opener inside his own 18-yard box. Will surely face a tougher test in the quarter-finals. 6 Nathan Ak\u00e9 (CB) Made a couple of typically smart interventions, including a sprawling headed clearance when under the cosh early on. 7 Denzel Dumfries (RWB) The most dangerous player on the pitch. Was alert to sniff danger and set up two goals before volleying in. 9 Marten De Roon (CM) Quietly efficient without doing anything remarkable as the Netherlands coasted into a two-goal lead. Withdrawn at the break. 7 Frenkie De Jong (CM) His poise calmed things down after a nervy start and his class soon told. Was at the heart of everything for the Dutch. 8 Daley Blind (LWB) The 32-year-old arrived on cue at the penalty spot to convert Dumfries\u2019s cross and register his first Netherlands goal since 2014. 7  Davy Klaassen (AM) Involved in the first two goals; in the intricate passing for Depay\u2019s opener and slipped in Dumfries in buildup to the second. 7 Cody Gakpo (ST) Showed a couple of neat touches and slid the ball through Ream\u2019s legs in search of Depay. Is having a superb tournament. 7 Memphis Depay (ST) Fine first-time finish to sweep home Dumfries\u2019s cross was his first goal in Qatar and 43rd for his country. Only Robin van Persie has more. 8 Substitutes: Steven Bergwijn Missed chance to open up a three-goal advantage; 6. Teun Koopmeiners Booked for chopping down Pulisic; 5. Xavi Simons PSV teenager entered for his World Cup debut; 5. Wout Weghorst On too late to make a difference; 5. Matthijs de Ligt Another late replacement; 5.  USA (4-3-3) Matt Turner (GK) Had no chance with the goals but twice superbly denied Depay. More than creditable display by Arsenal\u2019s backup goalkeeper. 7 Sergi\u00f1o Dest (RB) Born in the Netherlands, the full-back was busy down the flank. Roamed into the opposition box but his shot lacked conviction. 6 Walker Zimmerman (CB) It had all been going so well. These goals were the first USA had conceded from open play at the tournament. 5 Tim Ream (CB) Had a rare sight of goal at a corner but at the other end was fortunate a trio of stray passes went unpunished. 5 Antonee Robinson (LB) Spent a lot of time in the Dutch half when marauding forward but Dumfries had plenty of joy up against him. 5 Tyler Adams (CM) The captain was bypassed for Depay\u2019s 10th-minute opener and never stamped his authority on the game. Disappointing. 5 Weston McKennie (CM) Powered a shot over the bar in the second half but was outclassed by a superior Dutch midfield. Replaced by goalscorer. 5 Yunus Musah (CM) Perhaps the brightest of the USA\u2019s midfield three, the 20-year-old was positive and industrious without much reward. 6 Timothy Weah (RW) Quiet until stinging the palms of Noppert with a smacked shot from outside of the box. Replaced in the second half. 5 Jes\u00fas Ferreira (CF) Given his World Cup debut as a false nine, the 21-year-old Major League Soccer young player of the year failed to shine. 5 Christian Pulisic (LW) All of the USA\u2019s good work went through the Chelsea forward. Failed to beat Noppert one-on-one after three minutes. 7 Substitutes: Gio Reyna Failed to make a meaningful impact; 5. Brenden Aaronson Provided a welcome thrust; 5. Haji Wright Fortuitous finish earned USA an unlikely lifeline on 76 minutes; 5. DeAndre Yedlin Unable to help find an equaliser; 5. Jordan Morris On too late to make a difference; 5."

                    "body": "Gareth Southgate has dropped a strong hint that he could walk away from the England manager\u2019s job, saying he feels \u201cconflicted\u201d about whether to stay on in light of the various lows of the past 18 months.\nSouthgate remains physically and mentally shattered by his team\u2019s World Cup quarter-final defeat against France on Saturday night, although he is proud of how they played.\nHe was determined to enjoy the tournament in Qatar, saying so on several occasions, which fuelled the belief that it could represent his last dance with England, even if he is contracted to the Football Association until December 2024.\n\nSouthgate did enjoy the finals but the same cannot be said of some of his other experiences in recent times, beginning with the fallout from the penalty shootout defeat against Italy in the European Championship final in the summer of last year.\nThere has long been the sense that an element of the fanbase was ready to erupt at him in the case of any further defeats and it happened during the disappointing Nations League campaign \u2013 the nadir coming in the 4-0 home reverse against Hungary at Molineux in June. Southgate was shocked by the vitriol of the crowd that night.\n\u201cI\u2019ve found large parts of the last 18 months difficult,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cFor everything that I\u2019ve loved about the last few weeks, I still have \u2026 how things have been for 18 months. What\u2019s been said and what\u2019s been written. The night at Wolves. There\u2019s lots of things in my head that\u2019s really conflicted at the moment.\n\u201cWhat I want to make sure, if it\u2019s the right thing to stay, is that I\u2019ve definitely got the energy to do that. I don\u2019t want to be four or five months down the line thinking: \u2018I\u2019ve made the wrong call.\u2019 It\u2019s too important for everybody to get that wrong.\u201d\n\nIt is clear that the decision will rest with Southgate alone because the FA does not want to lose him. The governing body has been delighted at how he has transformed the mood around the squad since he took over soon after the disastrous Euro 2016 campaign when the team were knocked out by Iceland. England travel in expectation rather than hope, these days. The players, meanwhile, are also supportive of him.\nIt is unclear when Southgate will decide but he indicated he needed at least a few days to clear his head before he even thought about it.\n\u201cWhen I\u2019ve been through the past few tournaments, my emotions have been difficult to really think through properly in those following few weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cIt took so much energy out of you and you have so much going through your mind.\n\u201cI want to make the right decision either way because it has to be the right one to go again, or the right one not to go again, and I don\u2019t think now is the time to make a decision like that. Neither are the next few days, really.\u201d\nIt was put to Southgate that he might not have too long to reach a conclusion. \u201cAfter every tournament I\u2019ve sat with everybody at the FA and talked things through logically and I think that\u2019s the right process to go through again,\u201d he replied.\nAfter three tournaments and the remorseless demands and stresses of the role, it is easy to wonder whether Southgate still needs it, whether he can reset for Euro 2024 in Germany. While he was in Qatar, he had to beef up the security at his house after photographs of it were published. It is one of the many examples of things that he could do without.\nSouthgate was asked how long it would take before he got this tournament out of his system. \u201cI don\u2019t think I have got over the last one [Euro 2020],\u201d he said. \u201cBut this feels a little bit different because when we reflect on what we\u2019ve done, I\u2019m not sure what more we could have done or given. I think we\u2019ve given a really good performance against a top team [France]. It was a significant psychological step for those players.\n\n\u201cI have been involved in nights where we have played top teams and been on the back foot for the majority of the game and been dominated. I know France are a bit more counterattacking so it is a little bit different from a possession team who can pin you back. We wanted to be bold in the tournament and I think we went toe to toe with them.\n\u201cWe have said we want to be competitive all the way through with England and we are, I believe, in that top table \u2026 the last three tournaments, we have restored credibility. The rest of the world look at us as a good side. But we are here to win and we haven\u2019t won.\u201d\nWhen Southgate extended his contract in November of last year, he talked of the depth of playing talent at his disposal, how he had \u201cdone a lot of the work culturally\u201d to turn them into contenders and his desire to bring it to fruition. \u201cTo step away at a moment where we still think the next few years can be very exciting \u2026 that would have been difficult to live with,\u201d he said.\nDoes Southgate still remember that feeling, or have things changed irrevocably?"

Thirty-six years on from Mexico 86, Valdano would love a third, a spectator again but in the stadium, not some bar. \u201cI asked [the coach C\u00e9sar Luis] Menotti. He said if the World Cup started that day, I\u2019d be in the squad. \u2018What I can\u2019t promise,\u2019 he said, \u2018is that I\u2019ll be coach tomorrow, given this chaos.\u2019\n\u201cThere was a strike on. We were in the hotel together but he wasn\u2019t allowed to coach us. He would sit in the car, watching from a distance. A bit of crossing and heading, then a kickabout. It was like being back in the potrero. He did continue but I didn\u2019t play in the first division [until 1979]. Menotti only took one \u2018foreign\u2019 player: Mario Kempes. The rest were playing in Argentina. There was a guy called Maradona who was also left out.\u201d\n\nValdano laughs. \u201cI was in good company.\u201d\nAlways. Valdano tells great stories, if too rarely about himself, instead analysing and describing others, which he does better than anyone, taking you with him. He\u2019s been talking for 69 minutes before his goal in the World Cup final even gets mentioned, and he\u2019s not the one that eventually brings it up. As he talks, certain themes dominate: the joy taken from talent, inspiration, genius, the men who transcend, break through the system. \u201cPel\u00e9 is one, Cruyff, Di St\u00e9fano who revolutionised football. Every 20 years or so they appear. Messi is the latest. Maradona before.\u201d\n\nLionel Scaloni says something that helps explain what Messi represents and how it is to be him: when he walks into the dining room everyone looks at him, players, staff, chefs, kitmen, the lot. And that\u2019s people who know him. Did that happen with Maradona? And how do you manage it? How could you not look at Maradona? It\u2019s easier to end up like Maradona than like Messi. Messi has a remarkable self-control that has saved him. There\u2019s no hiding place. He can touch down in an African country, an Asian country, he\u2019s still Messi. The others have to know how to live with a genius. For a long time, this Argentina team didn\u2019t; now they\u2019ve learnt. The idea that everyone\u2019s the same isn\u2019t true. If you\u2019re Messi, how are you going to be the same? If you\u2019re Maradona? You have to respect their space, their habitat \u2013 and give them the ball even if they\u2019re marked.\nIs that a risk? It\u2019s a reality. One day, Menotti calls a team meeting. When we get there, he tells Maradona he\u2019s not allowed to come in; he doesn\u2019t want him to hear what he\u2019s going to say about him. Maradona goes. He sits us down and says: \u201cRight, I have to ask you something. How many times do you think you have to give the ball to him during the game?\u201d There\u2019s a pause and Menotti says: \u201cAll of them. Right, tell Maradona to come back in.\u201d It\u2019s not good for him to find out, but it is good to \u201coveruse\u201d a genius. He wins you the game.\nIs integrating a star hard? Can we compare Messi and Maradona in that sense? Every time has its peculiarities. [Daniel] Passarella had to live with Maradona. We all knew the relationship was broken. As chance would have it, Passarella got ill and from there Diego reigned. There are lots of elements, including luck, in making a team. Karim Benzema is the example now. This game never stops surprising us. Three days ago we were talking about Messi, the next day it was Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, the day after Neymar. The three stars of the World Cup all play for PSG and they can\u2019t find a way to win the Champions League. Give me your all-time team. How can I not put in Cruyff, Pel\u00e9, Maradona \u2026 but you write it down and think: \u201cWould they actually beat anyone?\u201d\nAnd Argentina? I feel like Argentina have found the right ecosystem. I saw a photo that looked like Ocean\u2019s Eleven: the players getting off the bus, Messi at the head, the rest behind him, flanking him in a triangle. That has a symbolic value that went without comment but explains what Argentina is. You see the happiness that Leo has: he\u2019s liberated. By the group and by the Copa Am\u00e9rica in Brazil in 2019. There is a before and after for them and above all for Leo. He talks about how despite losing there was a unity. What struck me was him saying he most regrets not having enjoyed the Guardiola era more, as if he wishes he had savoured what he now knows is special.\n\nYou once said that Messi is Maradona every day and even Maradona wasn\u2019t Maradona every day \u2026 And in different positions. He abandoned one role and adapted to a new one on the very day he occupied it. I\u2019m a winger and Guardiola says play false 9: we win 6-2 and I inspire it. Now we see him as a strategist, a midfielder. As if being a genius wasn\u2019t enough, time made him wise. Against Australia, it was like the essence of his 1,000 games, the aroma of everything he\u2019s been. Even as a madridista, I\u2019ve always thought that whoever doesn\u2019t love Messi doesn\u2019t love football. I won\u2019t allow anyone to say he is less than anyone ever.\nYou mentioned the three from PSG. This is a World Cup where big players are performing. Except Ronaldo. People talk about ego, but it\u2019s the most profitable ego in history \u2013 for his teammates too. His case speaks to me of the speed with which people forget. Big players performing is important because World Cups are defined through them. 1970 was Pel\u00e9 and his band; 1986 was Maradona and his. That\u2019s why it\u2019s such a pity Sadio Man\u00e9\u2019s not here, that Erling Haaland isn\u2019t. It\u2019s wonderful seeing Mbapp\u00e9, who seems to have time for everything: he can do it all, and then score the goal. Whereas with Leo, it\u2019s about his brain identifying the opportunity to make his talent tell, even without the physical condition. He has less but is giving more. We\u2019re seeing individuals against systems, returning us to the football we came from. Football came from its place: Brazil had an identity, Germany had an identity. Now, it belongs to its time. And this is a time of uniformity, national teams look alike. Football, as ever, tells us about the world.\nWhat does having the football here tell us about the world? It feels like it has been the most political tournament of all. Partly because we did that. Russia provided ample material for a political debate which has been made even more patent by what followed. And that\u2019s before we mention the Argentina World Cup. A complicity between Fifa, and especially [former Fifa president [Jo\u00e3o] Havelange, and the state. It\u2019s good to put the focus on the sociological elements because we\u2019re talking about the most representative game in the world; football explains many things. Argentina was the interruption of a democratic process by the most butcherous government in the country\u2019s history.\nArs\u00e8ne Wenger claimed that the teams that focused on politics were the teams that lost. I don\u2019t think a footballer is distracted because he has a political position. I have no doubt attention will also be placed on the aberrations that happen in the US, which are more sociological than political. Not much has been said about the most popular sport staging its defining competition in one of the most expensive countries. Football has turned towards the rich. Argentina\u2019s connection with the people is so powerful that it becomes another reason to want them to win \u2013 for that to prevail, not the artificiality of marketing and finance. That said, I\u2019m as scared of method as marketing: one removes something from around the game, the other removes the soul from the game itself. And technology alarms me too. [The Spanish author] Javier Mar\u00edas described football as savage and sentimental. Technology removes that savagery. We seem determined to turn it into entertainment when it\u2019s emotion, a prolongation of life.\nWe talk about a star defining each team but Brazil have more than one. Yes, but it\u2019s curious. The best player on the pitch was Casemiro. Or Alisson. But they gave the man of the match award to Neymar. There\u2019s a subservience to big names. And Neymar is a pop star, a persona. While Messi hides that persona, Neymar plays the role. At first I felt Vin\u00edcius was a bit inhibited but not any more. England and Brazil have as much talent on the bench as the pitch. No one else has that.\n\nEngland play France next. One day we\u2019re going to have to talk about Guardiola, wouldn\u2019t you say? In South Africa, Spain won with six from Barcelona. In Brazil, Germany won with six from Bayern. There aren\u2019t so many from City but there\u2019s a cultural movement he has pushed. I look at Harry Kane: he can play a pass, combine, see things, finish. He\u2019s a crack. And Jude Bellingham is buenisimo, buenisimo. He does everything so naturally, including running. He runs like a gazelle. It\u2019s wonderful. He\u2019s differential.\nArgentina face Holland. Not much is said about Louis van Gaal. And what the Dutch do say is negative! Someone asked me what I thought of Van Gaal\u2019s catenaccio. I said: \u201cListen, it\u2019s one thing not having the possession of old, another to accuse him of that.\u201d We could say they\u2019re more the Netherlands than Holland. Argentina\u2019s advantage is that first traumatic loss created a vicious circle but also a virtuous cycle: it obliges change, forces you to overcome, makes you stronger. That would be my fear with Brazil: they\u2019re living happy times, too happy for football, which tends to hide around the corner and stab you when you least expect. So happy even the coach dances.\nWas that a lack of respect? If I dance, it\u2019s a lack of respect. But they\u2019re Brazilians. They had Ronaldinho, Rom\u00e1rio, Ronaldo, for whom life is an exercise in happiness and football is an extension of life.\nAll this time and not one mention of your goal in 1986 \u2026 Without doubt the happiest moment of my life. That classic thing: this isn\u2019t happening to me. There\u2019s a limit to happiness and then suddenly you\u2019re beyond it. I had missed out in 1978 but the World Cup that really hurt was 1982. I got injured early in my first start, when I was flying. In 1986 I had missed an open goal in the semi-final and in Argentina they abused me in every language. If you miss, it marks you, kills you. In the final I was running through, praying to the ball: go in, please. Now people who weren\u2019t even born ask me how I scored. That\u2019s a moment that makes you happy the rest of your life. Football."

                    "body": "This was the Faberg\u00e9 egg of football friendlies. A simple, unremarkable thing transformed by ambition, dedication, an absence of taste, and money, lots of money, into something transcendental. The full time score in Riyadh: entertainment 7 \u2013 geopolitics 6. The top line was Ronaldo v Messi. Billed as potentially the last encounter between the two footballing giants, it was a chance to \u201cappreciate their Goatness\u201d as a host on PSG TV put it. The Argentina captain was at the heart of the French champions\u2019 gilded forward line, alongside Neymar and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9. The Portuguese, meanwhile, captained an amalgamated team from the Saudi league, from players taken from the champions, Al-Hilal, and his new club, Al-Nassr, billed as the Riyadh Season Team.  This match was arranged two years ago and scheduled for 2022, but it was deferred because of Covid and things have changed since. That there was ultimately more to it than the appearance of two superannuated superstars will not come as a surprise to anyone who has been awake in the intervening period. Ronaldo\u2019s arrival in the country this winter, on a contract worth $214m over its two-and-a-half-year duration, is a statement about the importance of sport to Saudi Arabia. It is also an attempt to swing the limelight back to Riyadh after the regional acclamation that followed Qatar\u2019s hosting of the World Cup. Qatar, of course, own PSG and is currently upset with the Saudis who have been blocking its digital TV service in the country. That service includes the sports brand BeIn, which had the rights to screen this match in 43 countries. It\u2019s complicated. So when the president of PSG, Nasser al-Khelaifi, walked out on to the pitch of the King Fahd Stadium arm-in-arm with Turki al-Sheikh, the owner of La Liga side Almer\u00eda, poet, and the head of Saudi\u2019s General Entertainment Authority, there was a certain amount of symbolism involved. There was a third man in the walk-out, too, the Bollywood legend Amitabh Bachchan, although the political significance of his presence was not immediately ascertainable. Bachchan greeted the players before kick-off and his role as leading dignitary was unlikely to have been performed for free. The same could be said of the recruitment of Marcelo Gallardo \u2013 perhaps the world\u2019s most celebrated out-of-work football manager \u2013 to coach the Riyadh Season Team for all of 90 minutes. The Riyadh Season, in case you were wondering, is a new Saudi initiative designed to bring tourists to the capital during the more tolerable winter months (if you consider 11 degrees tolerable) to enjoy 15 different \u201centertainment zones\u201d.  The Riyadh Season is Sheikh\u2019s idea and it has been immaculately programmed, from music to theatre to cheeseburgers. A similar attention to detail was visible at this match. The talent was there, the in-stadium audio visuals too. The VIP access was unprecedented with one individual paying $2m for the chance to get into the dressing rooms at half-time and meet the Goats. Funnily enough, the football also delivered. Goat #1 opened the scoring in the third minute, Messi latching on to a dinked Neymar pass to slot home under David Ospina, the Colombia international and former Arsenal stand-in. Twenty-five minutes in and Mbapp\u00e9 had apparently scored another only for VAR to rule it out. Yes this was a friendly with VAR, what did you expect?  In the 34th minute the video assistant was at work again, this time awarding Riyadh Season a penalty for no earthly reason after Ronaldo and Keylor Navas had both contested for a ball and missed it. Goat #2 stepped up, scored easily and did a \u201csiiiuuuu\u201d which duly reverberated through the 66,000 punters in the crowd. Then PSG\u2019s Juan Bernat was sent off, Marquinhos scored with a backheeled flick, Neymar missed a penalty and Ronaldo fired home his second after an imperious header had come back off the post. And this was all before half-time. The scores were level at 2-2 and it soon became 3-3 when Sergio Ramos turned home the ball after a piece of Mbapp\u00e9 blood-twisting, then the Korean centre-half Jang Hyun-soo headed home for Riyadh from a corner. Mbapp\u00e9 restored the PSG lead in the 59th minute before he, Messi, Neymar and Ronaldo were all withdrawn on the hour in a move that was not in any way contractually pre-agreed.  The 10 men of Paris scored a fifth through the substitute Hugo Ekitik\u00e9 before, in the 90th minute, Ronaldo came up on the big screen and blew a kiss to the crowd and the Riyadh sub Anderson Talisca scored a belter from the edge of the box. A win for the non-scratch side with a front line worth nigh on half abillion euros, but a close contest all the same. Everyone could go away happy. After the medal ceremony, yes this friendly had a medal ceremony that was not entirely unlike that of the World Cup final, the Black Eyed Peas played on over the tannoy and the Goats toured the sidelines clapping the crowd, who were decent. Meanwhile, elsewhere in the world, the 1.3 million concurrent viewers who had been watching the match on a YouTube livestream clicked off and asked their mothers what was for dinner."

Please join Scott Murray tomorrow for the big one: Argentina v France in the World Cup final. Goodnight!      5.06pm         5.02pm         5.02pm    Luka Modric poses for a selfie with one of the Moroccan backroom staff, then runs across to rejoin his mates as they celebrate in front of the Croatia fans. He\u2019s been killing teams softly for over 15 years, and the World Cup will seriously miss him.     4.58pm    In other news      4.57pm    Some of the Moroccan players are trying to get at the referee, which is more than a little ridiculous, and now Walid Regragui is having an animated discussion with him. I can\u2019t remember any dodgy decisions at all, apart from the penalty that should have given to Croatia for the foul on Gvardiol. Don\u2019t tarnish it lads, the world loves you.   Updated at 5.02pm GMT    4.55pm   Full time: Croatia 2-1 Morocco  Croatia finish third at the World Cup, as they did in 1998, after winning an enjoyable game against Morocco.     Updated at 5.18pm GMT    4.55pm    90+6 min: So close from En-Nesyri! Attiat-Allah beats his man again on the left, but this time he stands up a lovely cross to the far post. En-Nesyri gets up early, hangs in the air for an age and heads onto the roof of the net. A great effort.    Updated at 5.00pm GMT    4.54pm    90+5 min Mislav Orsic, whose memorable goal has probably settled this game, is replaced by Kristijan Jakic.     4.53pm    90+4 min Attiat-Allah beats Stanisic with ease on the left but smashes his cross too close to Livakovic.     4.52pm    90+2 min Amallah\u2019s dangerous inswinging cross is headed away well by Perisic. What a brilliant, multi-purpose footballer he has been.      4.50pm    90+1 min There will be six minutes of added time.     4.50pm    90 min Morocco appeal for a penalty when En-Nesyri\u2019s header, from Hakimi\u2019s cross, deflects off Petkovic and wide. Replays show it hit his shoulder blade, not his arm.     4.48pm    88 min \u201cGreetings from Los Angeles!\u201d writes Michael S Weller. \u201cI appreciated Eric from Pittsburgh\u2019s point about Croatia/Morocco/Belgium in Group F, and his comment made me think about this year\u2019s group stage as a whole. Others have noted how exciting the conclusion of this year\u2019s group stage was; I also wonder if there has been a more evenly balanced set of groups in recent tournaments? In any case, I hope Fifa decide to keep the groups of four for 2026.\u201d Yes, agreed. Groups of three, for reasons I\u2019m too weary and cold-ridden to go into, are a hideous idea.  Updated at 4.50pm GMT    4.46pm    87 min Kovacic misses a great chance to seal the match. He made it for himself with some beautiful footwork, shifting the ball one way and then the other to hoodwink a defender in the area. That put him through on goal, but his left-footed shot faded past the far post.  Updated at 4.46pm GMT    4.43pm    84 min Now Amallah is booked for dissent, and a number of Morocco players are surrounding the referee, angry that he gave a free-kick when Petkovic was caught in the face by a stray arm. There was a bit of pushing and shoving from the players on both sides before things settled down.  Updated at 4.44pm GMT    4.41pm    82 min \u201cThat penalty was so obvious,\u201d says Peter Oh. \u201cIt\u2019s right there in his name, GVARdiol!      4.40pm    81 min \u201cKudos to the referee,\u201d says Paul Pooley, \u201cwho is clearly trying to see if he can keep his cards in his pocket all the way to the finish.\u201d Alas, Ounahi opened his mouth in the 69th minute and was booked.   Updated at 5.26pm GMT    4.38pm    80 min The intensity of this game has been surprisingly high. It clearly means a lot to both teams, particularly Morocco.     4.37pm    78 min It\u2019s a shame Gvardiol\u2019s World Cup will be chiefly remembered for a Lionel Messi body swerve because he has been fantastic, probably the best defender in the tournament. Croatia would have gone out at the group stage but for his glorious last-ditch tackle on Romelu Lukaku.     4.36pm    77 min You can understand the referee not seeing the foul by Amrabat, as his view was slightly impeded, but for VAR to wave it away is preposterous. State of it.     4.35pm    75 min: Fine save from Livakovic! A cross from the left skims the head of Gvardiol and comes to En-Nesyri, whose close-range shot is superbly saved by Livakovic. Then Hakimi goes down appealing for a penalty after a challenge from Petkovic. That wasn\u2019t a foul, but we\u2019ve just seen a replay of the Gvardiol appeal, and it was one of the clearest penalties of the tournament. Amrabat just legged him up. Chalk up another triumph for VAR.   Updated at 4.55pm GMT    4.33pm    74 min Gvardiol rampages into the area, onto a superb angled pass from Orsic, and falls over under a challenge from Amrabat. The referee says no penalty, and the Croatia bench are fuming.   Updated at 4.52pm GMT    4.30pm    71 min A dodgy ball from Amrabat goes straight to Vlasic, 40 yards out. He makes a beeline for goal and slashes a long-range drive over the bar. That\u2019s Croatia\u2019s 12th attempt on goal; Morocco, despite some bright attacking play, have had only three.     4.28pm    69 min Ounahi is booked for dissent.     4.27pm    68 min \u201cFIFA should allow unlimited substitutions in consolation games,\u201d says Peter Oh, \u201cso that unused subs can get a run out on the big stage.\u201d I can\u2019t think of anything more perfectly designed to tip a weary liveblogger over the edge at the end of a long tournament.     4.26pm    67 min Now Jawad El Yamiq is injured, which means Morocco are without five defenders. They have no more on the bench, so Selim Amallah comes on in El Yamiq\u2019s place and the admirable Sofyan Amrabat drops into the defence.     4.25pm    66 min: Double change for Croatia Bruno Petkovic and Mario Pasalic replace Marko Livaja and Lovro Majer.     4.24pm    65 min Hakimi\u2019s lofted cross is headed away well by Sutalo, under pressure from En-Nesyri.     4.23pm    64 min Two changes for Morocco. Sofiane Boufal and the limping Achraf Dari are replaced by Anass Zaroury, the Burnley youngster, and Badr Benoun.     4.22pm    62 min It sounds like Kramaric has a hamstring injury. His team, Hoffenheim, don\u2019t return to Bundesliga action until 21 January so hopefully it won\u2019t affect him too much.     4.19pm    61 min: Croatia substitution Nikola Vlasic replaces Andrej Kramaric, who is in tears as he walks off the field.  Updated at 4.19pm GMT    4.18pm    59 min Kramaric is struggling, having pulled something in the act of crossing. The interesting thing is that he was offside, but play continued because of the change in the law. And now look!     4.15pm    57 min This will go to extra-time and penalties if necessary. I know.     4.14pm    56 min: Morocco substitution Azzedine Ounahi, a team of the tournament staple, replaces the impressive teenager Bilal El Khannouss.     4.13pm    55 min Majer hits another wicked cross towards Livaja, who mistimes his volley and does himself a temporary mischief in the process. Majer has a left foot to die for.     4.12pm    53 min Kovacic is tackled just inside the Morocco area, with the ball running on towards Mayer near the byline. He draws Bono and lifts a short-range cross that is cleared.     4.11pm    52 min Boufal\u2019s long pass is chested into the area by En-Nesyri, but Perisic tracks him all the way.     4.10pm    51 min A vicious cross from Majer on the left is shinned past the far post by one of the Moroccan defenders, El Yamiq I think. The referee wrongly gives a goalkick.  Updated at 4.10pm GMT    4.07pm    48 min Ziyech, who has moved into a more central position, finds Attiat-Allah in space on the left side of the area, but he can\u2019t quite control the bouncing ball on the stretch.     4.06pm    47 min Orsic almost scores another belter. He cut inside from the left and thrashed a rising drive that took a slight deflection off El Yamiq and rippled the side netting at the near post.     4.04pm    46 min Peep peep! Morocco have made a half-time substitution: Ilias Chair has replaced Abdelhamid Sabiri.     4.03pm    The players are coming back out. And it looks like Achraf Dari is okay to continue.     3.54pm         3.52pm    \u201cSeeing the goals and today\u2019s play, one can only imagine what was possible if Dali\u0107 had been braver with the lineup,\u201d says Tomislav Chagall. \u201cOh well.\u201d     3.49pm   Half time: Croatia 2-1 Morocco  That was plenty of fun. Josko Gvardiol and Mislav Orsic scored quite brilliant goals for Croatia either side of Achraf Dari\u2019s equaliser. But poor Dari went down just before the half-time whistle and looks like he\u2019s struggling.   Updated at 3.54pm GMT    3.46pm    45 min There will be two added minutes.     3.45pm    Mislav Orsic has restored Croatia\u2019s lead. It looked like they had missed the chance by overplaying, but Kovacic won the ball back on the edge of the D and gave it to Livaja (I think). He flicked it outside to Orsic, who ran round the ball, on the left edge of the area, and floated an exquisite first-time shot across goal with his right foot. It beat the flying Bono, hit the inside of the far post and rebounded into the net.      Updated at 5.28pm GMT    3.43pm   GOAL! Croatia 2-1 Morocco (Orsic 42)  Another tremendous goal for Croatia!     3.41pm    40 min Ziyech shoots wide from 30 yards after twisting Modric one way and then the other. When he\u2019s in the mood, Ziyech is just so much fun to watch. In fact, you picked a decent XI from this World Cup of players who aren\u2019t regulars for their clubs.     3.38pm    37 min Ziyech\u2019s wicked inswinging corner from the right is flicked right across the face of goal by En-Nesyri.      3.37pm    35 min Morocco are having a good spell. Ziyech whips a free-kick from the left towards the far post, where Perisic stretches to head clear. That was an important touch because there were a couple of unmarked Moroccan players behind him.     3.34pm    33 min Lovely play from Morocco. Boufal zips infield from the left, plays a one-two with the teenager El Khannouss and is about to shoot when the covering Sutalo knocks the ball off Boufal and behind for a goalkick. The Morocco players are fuming that a corner wasn\u2019t given, but replays show the referee got it right.  Updated at 3.35pm GMT    3.32pm    31 min \u201cGood morning from Pittsburgh!\u201d says Eric Peterson. \u201cI consider Belgium to be this recent era\u2019s greatest underachievers - tons of individual talent that never reached its potential as a team - but this game makes me wonder how much fun it would be to go back in time one month and tell folks not only that Group F would provide both contestants in the third-place game, but that neither one would be Belgium. Talk about getting laughed out of the alehouse, huh?\u201d     3.31pm    29 min Hakimi plays a gorgeous one-two with Ziyech on the right, surges into the area but then hits his cross behind En-Nesyri, who was waiting in front of an open goal at the far post. That was a real chance for Morocco.   Updated at 3.37pm GMT    3.30pm    28 min Croatia have been the dominant team, with six shots to Morocco\u2019s one I think. Ultimately none of this matters \u2013 life, I mean, not the third-place playoff \u2013 but it\u2019s enjoyable stuff.   Updated at 4.30pm GMT    3.29pm    27 min \u201cAgreed with Steve Wilson being among the very best of our commentators,\u201d says Mark Harrison. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought of him as the natural successor to Barry Davies - fairly understated, but very good at finding the right words for the big moments. His \u2018it\u2019s five-nil. FIVE-NIL!?\u2019 in that semi-final in Belo Horizonte comes to mind - it was perfectly judged given both the magnitude and absurdity of the moment. Commentary is hugely subjective of course, but I do greatly prefer him to most.\u201d Yes, \u2018understated\u2019 is the word. Very little ego, knows the value of silence, seems an excellent judge of an incident in the heat of the moment.     3.26pm    24 min Modric makes room for a low left-footed shot from the edge of the area. Bono sees it late and shovels it away unconvincingly, then sprawls across his line to push the loose ball away from Livaja. For a second it looked like Livaja would have an open goal.   Updated at 3.34pm GMT    3.23pm    22 min Sorry, been sifting through emails. You haven\u2019t missed anything, unless I missed it, in which case we all did.     3.19pm    18 min Orsic has a shot blocked by his own teammate Kramaric, who then heads straight at Bono. Croatia, so toothless for much of the tournament, look like they are enjoying themselves today.     3.16pm    15 min The goalscorer Dari stretches desperately to stop Livaja\u2019s cross reaching Kramaric in front of goal. Excellent defending. The two teams look right up for this.     3.14pm    13 min And here\u2019s the equaliser.      3.12pm    11 min I\u2019ve never seen a free-kick routine quite like that. It\u2019s still only the second best training-ground free-kick of the tournament, mind you.   Updated at 3.13pm GMT    3.11pm    10 min Orsic cuts inside from the left and thrashes wide of the far post.      3.10pm    Achraf Dari has equalised straight away. Ziyech\u2019s inswinging free-kick was unwittingly looped towards his own goal by the head of Majer, and Dari reacted quickest to head past Livakovic from five yards. It\u2019s his first international goal.    Updated at 3.53pm GMT    3.09pm   GOAL! Croatia 1-1 Morocco (Dari 9)  Now that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about.     3.09pm    The free-kick was 30 yards from goal in the inside-left channel. The left-footed Majer curled it elegantly over the wall towards Perisic, who ran away from goal to meet it and then flicked a superb header back across the face of the area. Gvardiol charged onto the ball, 12 yards out, and powered a spectacular diving header past Bono.   Updated at 3.27pm GMT    3.08pm   ONE OF THE GOALS OF THE TOURNAMENT! Croatia 1-0 Morocco (Gvardiol 7)  This is an unbelievably good free-kick from Croatia.   Updated at 3.11pm GMT    3.06pm    6 min \u201cRob, it\u2019s been a pleasure,\u201d says Aaron Roston. \u201cThis will almost certainly be my last World Cup as well, at least in this capacity, as I plan on attending the 2026 one. Since this is the consolation game, is this your consolation MBM? I think the biggest upside to this World Cup is the fact that the worker deaths, and half empty stadiums will put the kibosh on Saudi Arabia\u2019s bid.\u201d I wish I shared your confidence on that! And yep, this is my last MBM of the tournament, unless, say, a horrible accident befalls the great Scott Murray in the next 24 hours.     3.06pm    5 min It\u2019s been a bright start, particularly from the Morocco fans, who are whistling every time Croatia get the ball.     3.03pm    3 min Bono almost scores one of the great own goals! He sliced a routine pass across the penalty area, and the ball ran just past the far post for a Croatia corner.     3.02pm    2 min \u201cLike many Europeans, I don\u2019t know much about Moroccan football history, so I watched sections of the games they played in the 1986 World Cup,\u201d begins K\u00e1ri Tulinius. \u201cWhat surprised me is how they play in a remarkably modern style. Instead of the blood and thunder football I associate with the 80s, they played a patient possession game, less reminiscent of other teams of that era than of Spain in 2010. It\u2019s a shame that in the round of 16 they lost to a last-minute goal against West-Germany, because it would\u2019ve been interesting how other teams would\u2019ve been influenced by them. Instead decades passed before the rest of the world caught up with Morocco.\u201d They played brilliantly in the win over Portugal, and from memory were pretty much the equals of West Germany. Who was the class act in midfield, Aziz Bouderbala?      3.01pm    1 min Peep peep! Croatia get the match under way.     2.55pm    Good news for UK viewers. This chap is right up there with the best; might even be the best.      2.54pm    Here come the players. I was going to say it\u2019ll be hard to get up for this game, but I think we all know Sofyan Amrabat will be winning 40/60 balls from the first whistle.   Updated at 3.08pm GMT    2.50pm    Here\u2019s a question for you, and no cheating. According to the very detailed WhoScored.com data, who has been the best player at the World Cup? He (I\u2019ve said too much) has a tournament rating of 8.15, 0.01 ahead of old Lionel.     2.46pm    \u201cUnless I\u2019m hallucinating (perfectly possible), weren\u2019t you just on the OBO in Karachi?\u201d writes Saurya Chakraborty. \u201cIs it possible (and can we request for this) for you to do the whole OBO for Australia/South Africa, take up the Karachi OBO post-lunch and then do the final tomorrow? I\u2019d love it if by the end you were seriously discussing the magic of Messi\u2019s mystery spin in Brisbane.\u201d I can promise you I\u2019ve typed worse at 4am during a 2009-10 tour of Bangladesh.     2.38pm    The BBC have Croatia playing a back three, with Orsic and Perisic as wing-backs. Do we care about tactics in a third-place playoff?      2.23pm    \u201cThank you for your coverage...\u201d says Jeff Sachs. \u201cMust never forget the worker deaths that made this competition possible.\u201d I suspect, even if Lionel Messi scores 12 goals tomorrow, it\u2019ll still be the first thing many people remember about Qatar 2022. And while we\u2019re here, thanks to all of you who\u2019ve emailed and tweeted our writers throughout the tournament.      2.22pm    \u201cThough I\u2019ve lived in the UK for many years now, I hail from Kannur, a small town in northern Kerala,\u201d writes Ramesh Nair. \u201cIt was lovely to see Kerala\u2019s love for football mentioned in the Guardian, though I would not lump it in with the rest of India. Be it politics, sport, development indices, food habits (we eat a lot of beef) or our unfortunate weakness for excessive amounts of hard-liquor, Kerala is very different to the rest of India. And that extends to its rich and long standing international football fan-culture as well, with perhaps the exception of West Bengal.\u201cIt\u2019s a football crazy state (especially the northern half) and has long had massive fan associations for (primarily) Brazil and Argentina, but other teams as well, including more recently England! The biggest ever football related event in Kannur was Maradona visiting Kannur in autumn 2012. It remains one of the only two places that Maradona has visited in India and over 50,000 fans arrived to see him in Kannur that day. Kerala even observed a two-day official mourning period when Maradona died. He was and is a legend in these parts.      2.13pm    \u2018Harry Maguire, your defense is terriyfing\u2019      2.11pm    Rate it, rank it \u201cSo, how do we rate this World Cup on the level of footballing spectacle?\u201d wonders Ben Kybett. \u201cGood, but not great? The climax of the group stage was thrilling, the quarter finals provided some great thrills and spills, and Morocco have been wonderful.  \u201cHopefully we\u2019ll have an exciting final between two tough, talented teams. But perhaps a few too many one-sided and/or drab knockout ties? No ding-dong high-scoring classics or heavyweight epics? A few early morning 0-0s in the group stages didn\u2019t help either. For me, last year\u2019s Euros, despite all the weirdness that it involved, is probably the best tournament in my lifetime. But then, I\u2019m in my late 20s, so what do I know?\u201d Yeah, I\u2019d say it\u2019s been somewhere between decent and good, on the field that is. There\u2019s an argument it\u2019s the best World Cup since 1998, but anything beyond that is a reach in my opinion. Its main virtues have been great drama, moments and particularly stories, but the actual football has been no better than middling and it hasn\u2019t had a great match or a great team. All that said, it\u2019s quite hard to judge a World Cup until you have a bit of distance from it, six months or so. But I\u2019m sure not everyone agrees, and nor should they.   Updated at 2.12pm GMT    2.04pm   Team news  As you\u2019d expect, both managers have made a number changes \u2013 five for Croatia, three for Morocco. Luka Modric stays in the team for what will almost certainly (I said almost) be his last World Cup game. A few of the injured Morocco players are named among the subs, including the captain Romain Saiss. Their starting XI includes the uncapped teenager Bilal El Khannouss. Croatia (possible 4-3-3) Livakovic; Stanisic, Sutalo, Gvardiol, Perisic; Majer, Modric, Kovacic; Orsic, Kramaric, Livaja.Substitutes: Grbic, Ivusic, Barisic, Erlic, Lovren, Brozovic, Vlasic, Pasalic, Petkovic, Budimir, Sosa, Vida, Juranovic, Sucic, Jakic. Morocco (possible 4-3-3) Bono; Hakimi, Dari, El Yamiq, Attiat-Allah; Sabiri, Amrabat, El Khannouss; Ziyech, En-Nesyri, Boufal.Substitutes: Aguerd, Saiss, Ounahi, Hamdallah, Zaroury, Chair, El Kajoui, Aboukhlal, Amallah, Ezzalzouli, Cheddira, Tagnaouti, Benoun, Jabrane. Referee Abdulrahman Al-Jassim (Qatar)  Updated at 2.52pm GMT    1.42pm    Croatia have happy memories of the third-place playoff. In 1998 they beat the Netherlands 2-1; more importantly, Davor Suker scored his sixth goal of the tournament, which gave him the Golden Boot ahead of Gabriel Batistuta and Christian Vieri. Look out also for an, ahem, unique celebration from Bolo Zenden.       1.30pm    Wait, come back      1.30pm   Preamble  Hello and welcome to live coverage of the third-place playoff between Croatia and Morocco. To some, this is the most pointless game in world football; to others, it\u2019s an essential part of the rhythm of the World Cup\u2019s final week, a gentle little palate cleanser before the final. On this occasion, it\u2019ll also be a celebration of the underdogs who have enriched Qatar 2022. Croatia and Morocco drew 0-0 in their opening game, managing only four shots on target between them; had you said, at the final whistle, that they would meet again in the bronze-medal match, you\u2019d have been laughed out of the alehouse. On reflection, Croatia\u2019s might have been the greater achievement. At times they have looked like a 2018 tribute act, minus a frontman, and it was a miracle of resilience that they lasted as long as they did. For a county of four million people to reach a final and a semi-final in successive World Cups is arguably \u2013 pound for pound, or rather person for person \u2013 the greatest achievement since Uruguay won it in 1950. Morocco, by contrast, looked like they still had plenty in the tank (the fit players, anyway) in their stirring defeat to France on Wednesday. It\u2019s no exaggeration to say they have given us one of the great World Cup stories. This is a chance to celebrate them, and Croatia, and the greatest World Cup ever (sic), and anything else you fancy toasting on a Saturday afternoon. Kick off 3pm GMT, 4pm in Zagreb and Rabat, 6pm in Ar-Rayyan.  "

                    "body": "England were talk of the town in Auckland, pegged as the team to beat by almost everyone on and off the stage at Saturday\u2019s 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup draw. The only person who seemed to be managing expectations was Sarina Wiegman, who learned her European champions had been handed a relatively clean run to the knockout stages. The England manager played down the hype and said the Lionesses would have to further improve to make this trophy a genuine prospect.\n\u201cWe have built some trust and confidence, but we know we have to be better next year because the game develops so quickly,\u201d said Wiegman after the Lionesses were drawn in Group D with Denmark, China and a yet-to-be-determined qualifying playoff winner \u2013 either Senegal, Haiti or Chile.\n\u201cAs you could see in the Euros, there are so many good countries now \u2026 the games are really tight. That\u2019s what I expect from this tournament. In the group stage there are some very tight matches but also some will give a high score, because 32 countries come from different levels at different moments of their development.\n\u201cThe further the tournament goes the tighter the games will become,\u201d added Wiegman, who led her native Netherlands to the 2019 final. \u201cThere are many favourites for this World Cup so I wouldn\u2019t predict anything.\u201d\nEngland begin their campaign in Brisbane on 22 July, but will not know the identity of their first opponent until February\u2019s intercontinental playoffs complete the expanded 32-team draw. They then head to Sydney to play Denmark on 28 July, followed by China in Adelaide on 1 August. Top the group and they would face the Group B runners-up \u2013 possibly co-hosts Australia \u2013 back in Brisbane in the last 16.\n\u201cWe know Denmark very well, they are very technical and have a very recognisable style of play,\u201d Wiegman said. \u201cChina have been in transition a bit and have a new coach \u2013 they struggled a bit at the Olympics \u2013 but are good opponents.\u201d\n\nAll this will play out while the two-time reigning champions, the USA, do their business on the other side of the draw, headlined by a 2019 World Cup final rematch against the Netherlands, this time in Wellington on 27 July.\n\u201cMixed feelings,\u201d said the USA manager, Vlatko Andonovski, after finding out his side were drawn with the team they beat in Lyon. \u201cThe first thing is: \u2018Wow, there\u2019s a really good opponent\u2019. But at the same time it\u2019s exciting because we know that\u2019s the match from the last World Cup, and it\u2019s going to be a good game.\u201d\nThe USA are in Group E, also featuring debutants Vietnam and another playoff winner \u2013 either Portugal, Thailand or Cameroon. Andonovski finds himself under unenviable pressure to replicate his predecessor Jill Ellis\u2019s exploits, particularly in light of this month\u2019s friendly losses to England and Spain. \u201cObviously we\u2019re coming with hope to win it all,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not gonna be easy \u2013 there\u2019s so many good teams around.\u201d\nThe benefit for the 29 qualified teams is that they can now begin to make logistical plans. One side of the draw plays all their group games in New Zealand, the other in Australia, though the latter involves more travel for those such as Canada and Ireland, who are scheduled to play each other in Perth after landing in Group B with Australia and Nigeria.\n\nThe first co-hosted Women\u2019s World Cup also means a divvying up of the big moments. Sydney has the final, at Olympic Park, and Auckland\u2019s Eden Park has the official opener between New Zealand and Norway, who are in Group A with the Philippines and Switzerland.\nFrance, 2019 quarter-finalists at their home tournament, are in Group F with Jamaica, Brazil and the winner of the final four-team playoff between Taiwan, Paraguay, Papua New Guinea and Panama.\nSpain, in the throes of a player mutiny against their manager, Jorge Vilda, are in Group C with Costa Rica, Zambia and Japan. Sweden, South Africa, Italy and Argentina make up Group G with Germany, Morocco, Colombia and South Korea together in Group H.New Zealand also laid claim to the pomp and ceremony of the draw, a rich embodiment of M\u0101ori and First Nations culture coupled with a less brilliant showcase of the Fifa machine. Among the officials and dignitaries \u2013 Carli Lloyd conducted the draw, Ian Wright plucked out some balls \u2013 were the Fifa secretary general, Fatma Samoura, and president, Gianni Infantino, who declared without a hint of irony that \u201cFifa is the official happiness provider\u201d. Infantino had just attended the biannual Fifa council meeting, also in Auckland, where he criticised what he called unacceptably low offers for rights to screen this World Cup.\n\u201cWhen broadcasters \u2013 often public broadcasters, but also private broadcasters \u2013 offer us 100 times less for the Women\u2019s World Cup than the men\u2019s World Cup, even more than 100 times in some occasions, that is not acceptable,\u201d he said earlier on Saturday. \u201cWe are not going to accept this.\u201d\n\nHe said the tournament would cost Fifa around $US400m. The governing body, courtesy of next month\u2019s men\u2019s World Cup in Qatar, is expected to rake in an income toward $7bn for the four-year commercial cycle ending in December.He also called broadcasters hypocritical for pushing Fifa to treat women\u2019s football equally, particularly on the issue of World Cup prize money \u2013 the 32 teams at the men\u2019s 2022 World Cup will share a $440m pot while a pot of $60m was initially proposed for the first 32-team women\u2019s edition.\n\u201cIn some countries they are quite good at telling us that we should give more emphasis on equal opportunities, on equality, on non-discrimination, on treating men and women in the same way,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich is, of course, what we have to do, and we try to do that to the best of our ability.\u201d"

Thanks for your company and emails, and please join us on Sunday morning for the big one: England v Pakistan at the MCG. Or is it Pakistan v England? Who cares, they\u2019re playing each other, in a World Cup final. Ta-ra!   Updated at 12.02pm GMT    11.41am    The weather forecast for Sunday is mixed. I say \u2018mixed\u2019; it\u2019s rubbish. There\u2019s a reserve day on Monday, but the forecast isn\u2019t great then either. If the match can\u2019t be completed, the trophy will be shared. As unsatisfying as that sounds, there is a precedent: the winners of the 2002 Champions Trophy were Sri Lanka and India.     11.36am    \u201cIndia have done this before,\u201d writes Tim de Lisle, \u201cright down to the match-losing fifty from Kohli.\u201d The Sky pundits are discussing whether they were too cautious, particularly at the start of the innings. World Cups do seem to act as a handbrake. I still don\u2019t think they were that far short of par, though. England won what turned out to be a good toss and batted incredibly. That said, this is a cracking statistic.  And so is this. \u2018Whisper it\u2019 indeed. If any Indian fans would like Booth\u2019s phone number, I have a nuanced attitude towards bribery.   Updated at 12.05pm GMT    11.34am    \u201cWhat an outstanding win!\u201d says Colum Fordham. \u201cNot in my wildest dreams did I think England would coast to victory over such a (potentially) good India team. \u201cFaced with three hours of teaching that clashed perfectly with the match, I managed to introduce my Italian pupils to the world of cricket as an excuse to follow the contest while allegedly teaching them English. They were a bit bemused to begin with but gradually became interested in the rules and were cheering for the players in red (no moral suasion or attempt to please teacher). The players in red are winning/losing\u2026 etc.     11.30am    Hales (211) and Buttler (199) have scored 58 per cent of England\u2019s runs at this tournament, and that includes extras. Fifty-eight is the operative number: that\u2019s how many runs Ben Stokes, the next highest scorer, has made.  Updated at 11.32am GMT    11.27am    How to finish a World Cup semi-final, part 1 of 1      11.26am    Right, enough of the celebrations, let\u2019s get this pessimism party started \u201cWhat an amazing game!\u201d says Jacob Reed. \u201cI\u2019m worried, though, that it looks like England at the Rugby World Cup in 2019\u2026 destroyed the All Blacks in the semi then fell flat in the final as there was nowhere else to go.\u201d But they also, as Mike Atherton has just pointed out on Sky, hammered Australia in the semis in the 2019 Cricket World Cup.  Eight flags for Liam Livingstone, which might be a subtle comment on the fact that Phil Salt, Harry Brook and Moeen Ali all won the Thanks for Coming award.  Updated at 11.49am GMT    11.25am   Match report  Simon Burnton had the considerable pleasure of being at the Adelaide Oval tonight. Here\u2019s his report on a mind-blowing England victory.      11.24am    More from Jos Buttler. He\u2019s buzzing  You couldn\u2019t ask for a better runchase. I ummed and aahed over the toss, but gut feel said to chase today. India are sometimes more dangerous when they know what target they need. I thought Adil Rashid was outstanding; that\u2019s the best I\u2019ve seen him bowl in a long while. I thought he was our best chance to pick up wickets and he got the key one of Suryakumar. The dimensions of this ground suited Chris Jordan and I thought he bowled fantastically well. I don\u2019t think CJ was thanking me too much for bowling him three overs in a row at the death. I thought it was an incredible effort. It\u2019s too soon to say whether Dawid or Mark will be fit for Sunday. We\u2019ve seen quite a lot of Pakistan recently; they\u2019ve found some great form. At the moment we\u2019re just excited to be in the final. We had the stress of trying to get through the group stages and now we\u2019re in the final.      11.19am    Jos Buttler\u2019s verdict  [Is that the perfect game?] It feels that way, against such a good side. We always want to start as fast as we can with the bat and be really aggressive. A long batting line-up gives you a lot of freedom. Alex was so hard to bowl to today. We complement each other well and he was fantastic today. We\u2019ll enjoy this win but we know there\u2019s one big dance to go.      11.17am    Rohit Sharma\u2019s verdict  It\u2019s pretty disappointing. I thought we batted pretty well at the back end, but we were not good enough with the ball. We just didn\u2019t turn up. It\u2019s all about handling pressure [in the knockout stages]. We have played enough IPL cricket to understand that. The way we started off with the ball was not ideal, which shows we were a bit nervy. You have to give credit to those openers too; they played really well. The new ball swung a bit for Bhuvi but not from the right areas. We wanted to keep it tight on the stumps. That\u2019s a little disappointing. If you don\u2019t execute your plans, you\u2019ll find yourself in trouble.      11.13am    A quick plug for the Spin      11.13am     The thoughts of Adil Rashid, who bowled marvellously and took the wicket of Suryakumar Yadav  Lovely. One more game and hopefully we\u2019ll get there. I thought we bowled exceptionally well \u2013 we were happy chasing 169. There was a bit of turn. You have to get used to being able to bowl in the first Powerplay, I\u2019ve been practising that so that I\u2019m ready if the captain needs me. [The openers] played magnificently. When they\u2019re in that form nobody can stop them. There was no chat about the approach \u2013 just, \u2018Boys, go do your thing.\u2019 The job\u2019s not done yet. One more game \u2013 play the way we play and hopefully we\u2019ll get over the line.      11.09am    The player of the match is Alex Hales  It\u2019s a huge occasion, India in a World Cup semi-final, and I\u2019m really happy with the way I played \u2013 it\u2019s as special as it gets. This is one of the best grounds in the world to bat on, especially in the Powerplay. I never thought I\u2019d play in a World Cup again, so to get the chance \u2013 in a country I love \u2013 is very special.      11.09am    So, 30 years on from Wasim Akram\u2019s ball of the millennium, England will play Pakistan in another final at the MCG. We thought their seven-match series was a World Cup warm-up; turns out it was a World Cup final warm-up.     11.05am    The partnership of 170 is the highest for any wicket in a men\u2019s T20 World Cup. Buttler can\u2019t stop beaming as he embraces his team mates. He set the tone by taking 12 off the first over from his nemesis Bhuvneshwar Kumar, and then Alex Hales went ballistic. Buttler almost caught him up with a starburst of strokes at the end.   Buttler 80* (49 balls, 9x4, 3x6) Hales 86* (47 balls, 4x4, 7x6)  And we still don\u2019t know who was down to bat at No3.     11.02am   ENGLAND WIN BY 10 WICKETS!!!!  16th over: England 170-0 (target 169; Buttler 80, Hales 86) Hales backs away to clatter a slower short ball from Shami over extra cover for four. It almost went for six. Dear me, this is savage. Buttler finishes an unbelievable runchase in the grand manner, pinging Shami back over his head for one last six. He takes over his helmet, leans back and roars to the heavens. That, surely, is the best T20 performance in England\u2019s history. They have marmalised a great India team with ten wickets and 24 balls to spare.   Updated at 11.12am GMT    10.57am    15th over: England 156-0 (target 169; Buttler 71, Hales 81) A quiet over from Axar Patel, two from it. Both batters have faced 45 balls; Buttler has a strike rate of 158, Hales 180. \u201cThis is like Brazil losing 7-1 to Germany,\u201d says Vivek Jaitly. \u201cOnly if India manages to take a wicket here.\u201d Ah but Brazil were hosts. That\u2019s what gave it an extra layer of WTF.     10.55am    14th over: England 154-0 (target 169; Buttler 70, Hales 80) Jos Buttler took a mid-innings break to admire Alex Hales from the non-striker\u2019s end, but he\u2019s back to his spine-tingling best. He dumps Shami over extra cover for four and then makes room to launch a 100-metre six straight down the ground. That\u2019s an unreal shot. He tries again next ball, doesn\u2019t get hold of it and is dropped by Suryakumar Yadav running back from mid-off. To compound India\u2019s abundant misery he can only punch the ball to the boundary for four more. \u201cI\u2019m all for a redemption arc but Alex Hales was banned for recreational drug use and the captain refused to pick him after this,\u201d says Niall Mullen. \u201cSeems tough but fair?\u201d I think it\u2019s the length of the ostracism that most people were unhappy about. I can see both sides, and not only because my subconscious is so terrified of cancel culture that I haven\u2019t expressed an opinion since 2018. Look, I\u2019m sorry, I just don\u2019t feel that strongly either way about Marmite.     10.51am    Another great stat from Tim  England spinners: 7-0-41-1 India spinners: 5-0-55-0  \u201cWasn\u2019t expecting that!\u201d  Updated at 10.51am GMT    10.49am    13th over: England 140-0 (target 169; Buttler 56, Hales 80) Hales backs away, Pandya follows him, and Hales muscles the ball over mid-on for three. Buttler scoops the next ball for four, a particularly good shot because Pandya followed him outside off stump. And then he reaches his half-century with a stunning flat six over midwicket. England are taking India to the cleaners.  \u201cAt the moment,\u201d says Harsha Bhogle on commentary, \u201cit looks like a contest between two boxers from different weight categories.\u201d     10.45am    12th over: England 123-0 (target 169; Buttler 42, Hales 77) Ravichandran Ashwin returns to the attack. He bowled a very good first over, even though it went for 12. England are so far ahead of the rate that they are able to work Ashwin around for low-risk ones and twos. Buttler hasn\u2019t hit a boundary since the last ball of the Powerplay; with Hales running amok, he hasn\u2019t needed to. There he goes again! Hales gets down on one knee to dump Ashwin over backward square leg for six more. That\u2019s his seventh six, which equals Jason Roy\u2019s record for an England opener in T20Is. The overall record is Liam Livingstone\u2019s nine, and it\u2019s imperilled. This is sensational stuff from Hales, up there with his amazing hundred against Sri Lanka in 2014. He slaughters Ashwin\u2019s last ball to the cover boundary to move to 77 from 40 balls. England now need less than a run a ball.     10.40am    11th over: England 108-0 (target 169; Buttler 38, Hales 66) Pandya\u2019s first ball is pulled flat and hard over midwicket by Hales. That\u2019s his sixth six \u2013 I SAID THAT\u2019S HIS SIXTH SIX - and it brings up the century partnership from just 64 balls. It\u2019s so easy to think of Hales as a punisher, and by heaven does he punish, but his shot selection has been immaculate tonight. We probably don\u2019t give him enough credit for his intelligence.  Updated at 10.40am GMT    10.36am    10th over: England 98-0 (target 169; Buttler 37, Hales 57) England won the Ashes in 2005 because Glenn McGrath hurt his ankle during a game of rugby. If they win this tournament, it might be because Jonny Bairstow decided to have a round of golf.  His replacement, Alex Hales, is batting formidably. He smashes the new bowler Arshdeep\u2019s first ball through wide mid-off for four, then survives a potential run-out chance when Buttler\u2019s straight drive hits the stumps at the non-striker\u2019s end. Hales was well out of his ground, but Arshdeep didn\u2019t get a touch. There are still five overs of spin remaining; if India are to pull off a stunning victory, they will be key. England need 71 from 60 balls.     10.31am    Drinks Rishabh Pant needs treatment, so the umpires have called drinks an over ahead of schedule. Rohit Sharma takes the opportunity to get his team in a huddle and ask them what the eff they\u2019re playing at.     10.28am    9th over: England 91-0 (target 169; Buttler 34, Hales 51) Buttler gets a peculiar all-run four. He scooped the new bowler Pandya to third man, where Shami tried a simple relay throw to the supporting fielder. And it all went wrong, big time. It went over the fielder\u2019s head and allowed England to turn two into four. \u201cThey could still lose of course,\u201d says Nick Butler, \u201cbut Hales showing in this and the previous two matches - all of which were must-win games, just how bizarre and damaging Morgan\u2019s excessive personal vendetta against Hales has been.\u201d I don\u2019t know. It felt harsh, but I\u2019m loath to judge without knowing exactly what happened. We shouldn\u2019t forget is that Hales would only have been a back-up in 2019 (although he would have played when Jason Roy was injured). One thing\u2019s for sure: that post-match interview the other day redefined the word \u2018awkward\u2019.   Updated at 10.31am GMT    10.22am    8th over: England 84-0 (target 169; Buttler 30, Hales 50) A lamentable short ball from Axar Patel is munched over cow corner by Hales. That\u2019s his fifth six \u2013 as Tim de Lisle notes, that\u2019s already as many as Hardik \u2013 and a single off the last ball takes him to an accomplished, occasionally brutal half-century from 28 balls. England need 85 from 72 balls. \u201cEvening Rob,\u201d says Phil Withall. \u201cWatching this pair bat, the way they are starting to dominate, they way their mindset is so perfectly predisposed to taking the game to India. I would like to retract my previous, petty comment. Bring on the trumpets\u2026\u201d Well, if you insist.   Updated at 10.23am GMT    10.19am    7th over: England 75-0 (target 169; Buttler 29, Hales 42)  Hardik Pandya was going to bowl, but because he was off the field for a while it will be Ravichandran Ashwin instead. Pandya can bowl the next over. Ashwin\u2019s second ball turns appreciably to hit Buttler on the pad. There\u2019s an appeal for a bat/pad catch to the keeper but the umpire isn\u2019t interested; nor is Rohit Sharma.  It\u2019s a really good over from Ashwin, with plenty of encouragement for India, but Hales keeps England moving with another sweep round the corner for six. He has 42 from 23 balls and is playing beautifully.     10.15am    6th over: England 63-0 (target 169; Buttler 28, Hales 33) Let\u2019s not get carried away. England were 70-0 after six overs against Sri Lanka and only just reached a target of 142. But jeez, they are going outrageously well at the moment. Hales sweeps Axar over backward square leg for his third six.  Buttler clunks a pull not far short of midwicket \u2013 but he ends the over by crashing a pull stroke over the same fielder for four. In their last three Powerplays, against New Zealand, Sri Lanka and now India, England have 181-0 from 18 overs.   Updated at 10.37am GMT    10.10am    5th over: England 52-0 (target 169; Buttler 24, Hales 26) Mohammed Shami replaces Bhuvneshwar Kumar (2-0-25-0). Hales backs away to pump his second delivery over mid-off for a big six. For the third game in a row, England\u2019s openers are doing serious damage in the Powerplay. Hales slashes between keeper and slip for four to bring up a rapid fifty partnership from 31 balls. I\u2019m pretty sure this is the first time in England\u2019s T20 history that they\u2019ve had three consecutive opening stands of 50 or more.   Updated at 10.14am GMT    10.06am    4th over: England 41-0 (target 169; Buttler 24, Hales 15) Now then. With two right-handers at the crease, the left-arm spinner Axar Patel is coming on. Buttler backs away to chip his first ball over extra cover for a one-bounce four. That\u2019s an imperious statement of intent. He tries a similar stroke next ball, but doesn\u2019t middle it and only just clears the fielder running back from cover. In fact it was Pandya, who must have come back on the field between overs. The ball seems to be stopping in the pitch a bit for Patel, and England are happy to milk the remainder of the over. Eight from it. England need 128 from 96 balls.     10.03am    3rd over: England 33-0 (target 169; Buttler 18, Hales 13) Hardik Pandya is off the field, receiving treatment to his left hand. It doesn\u2019t look serious, so I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be okay to bowl.  It\u2019s Kumar to Hales for the first time. With Pant standing back, the England openers are walking down the pitch quite a lot to counter the swing. Hales does exactly that to launch an emphatic six over extra cover. A handful of ones and twos make it a really good over for England \u2013 12 from it.     9.58am    2nd over: England 21-0 (target 169; Buttler 17, Hales 2) The brilliant left-armer Arshdeep Singh, India\u2019s leading wicket-taker in the tournament, shares the new ball. Alex Hales is vulnerable to left-arm inswing \u2013 which right-hander isn\u2019t \u2013 and leading-edges the first ball through the covers for a single. Buttler thick edges through backward point for another boundary, which takes him to 16 from seven balls, but Arshdeep closes out the over very well. When Buttler drives a low full toss to mid-off, Kohli throws at the non-striker\u2019s end and seems to warn Hales about backing up illegally. Do bookies offer odds on a Mankad?     9.52am    1st over: England 13-0 (target 169; Buttler 12, Hales 0) Buttler walks down the track to his first ball, offering no stroke to an outswinger that is harshly called wide. India\u2019s response is instant \u2013 the wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant calls for a helmet and moves up to the stumps. Great stuff. Buttler reaches outside off stump to crack the first legitimate delivery of the innings through extra cover for four, then \u2013 with Pant now standing back again - does the same to the third ball. So much for England having a look. Kumar responds beautifully to beat Buttler with consecutive deliveries \u2013 the first wide and full, the second shorter and straight. And Buttler responds to the response with a measured stroke to the midwicket boundary. Blimey, what a start.     9.47am    Bhuvneshwar Kumar will bowl the first over. Of course he will.   Updated at 9.48am GMT    9.47am    \u201cWhat\u2019s your opinion of a par total in this wicket?\u201d says Chris Heron. Not a clue. But with the pressure of chasing, I reckon India are slight favourites. I\u2019m also worried about the short turnaround for Buttler, who must have been frazzled by that Pandya assault.     9.46am    The players are back out on the field. It\u2019s been said a gazillion times in the last 48 hours, but the contest between Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jos Buttler could be pivotal. Don\u2019t be surprised if Buttler and Alex Hales take a couple of overs to get their eye in.     9.37am   ENGLAND NEED 169 TO WIN  For much of that innings, England had a degree of control. But with India there is usually chaos at the death, and today was no exception. They (I say they, it was mainly Hardik Pandya) smashed 88 from the last seven overs to take India to what feels like a par total. A word for Chris Jordan, whose figures of 4-0-43-3 don\u2019t do justice to some very good death bowling.    Updated at 9.51am GMT    9.36am   WICKET! India 168-6 (Pandya hit wicket 63)  Pandya times Jordan devastatingly over midwicket for six, then pulls a full toss for four. He whips the last ball to the boundary as well \u2013 but treads on his stumps in the process and is out hit wicket. Those four lost runs might be vital. Even so, that\u2019s an awesome innings from Hardik Pandya: 63 from 33 balls with five sixes, including 59 from his last 24 deliveries.   Updated at 9.51am GMT    9.33am   WICKET! India 158-5 (Pant run out 6)  Pant blazes a wide full toss for a single, which brings the rampant Pandya back on strike. He pings a yorker to the cover sweeper for a single, an outrageously good shot for one, and then Pant misses a wide yorker. Pandya charges down the wicket, deliberately running Pant out so that he can regain the strike. In the circumstances, that\u2019s smart cricket. (Had it been a catch, the new batter would have been on strike, but because it was a run out they are allowed to cross.) Three balls remaining.   Updated at 9.45am GMT    9.29am    Chris Jordan will bowl the last over\u2026    Updated at 9.49am GMT    9.29am    19th over: India 156-4 (Pandya 52, Pant 5) Sam Curran\u2019s last over disappears for 20! Pant makes room to carve his first ball over backward point for four, then flicks a sizzling yorker for a single. Another wide yorker is steered deftly for four by Pandya, who then pulls a monstrous six over midwicket. The over finishes with a vicious clip towards cow corner that not even the diving Stokes can stop. That brings up a punishing half-century from Pandya. He scored 4 from his first 9 deliveries; he\u2019s belted 48 from the last 20.  Sam Curran, England\u2019s premier death bowler, finishes with R-rated figures of 4-0-42-0.    Updated at 10.02am GMT    9.22am    18th over: India 136-4 (Pandya 37, Pant 0) That was a fine catch from Rashid, and it ends a seriously eventful over. The new batter is Rishabh Pant.  Updated at 9.23am GMT    9.21am   WICKET! India 136-4 (Kohli c Rashid b Jordan 50)  Virat Kohli is out, and if that doesn\u2019t isn\u2019t worth an exclamation mark then I don\u2019t know what is! But first, let\u2019s flash back to the start of the over\u2026 Jordan tries to surprise Pandya with a short ball first up. Pandya surprises Jordan by swatting it in to the crowd at midwicket. That\u2019s his second six, and he gets his third next ball with an incredible shot. Jordan didn\u2019t quite nail a leg-stump yorker, and Pandya helicopter-flicked it sweetly over backward square leg. Jordan, who was tagged at the death in last year\u2019s semi-final, must be having flashbacks. But his response is admirable: a bouncer that beats Pandya and then a perfect yorker that Pandya can only squeeze for a single. Kohli drives two through extra cover to bring up his usual half-century: 39 balls, four fours, one six. But he falls next ball, squirting a wide yorker to Rashid at short third man. Virat Kohli is out!   Updated at 9.49am GMT    9.16am    17th over: India 121-3 (Kohli 48, Pandya 24) Here comes Sam Curran. He\u2019s been England\u2019s banker at the death in this tournament, but this is an entirely different challenge. His first ball is short, wide and slammed savagely over the short square boundary for six by Pandya. Kohli punches the air with delight. The next ball is heaved to deep square leg, where the sprawling Hales does very well to save two runs. Curran nails a wide yorker that is scrunched down the ground, with the non-striker Kohli scarpering back for two. That\u2019s excellent running. But it\u2019s also an excellent comeback from Curran: six from the first ball, five from the next five. Three overs to go, and there is absolutely no consensus about what would be a par score.       9.11am    16th over: India 110-3 (Kohli 48, Pandya 13) Kohli smiles at his reprieve and then drives Jordan\u2019s next ball through extra cover for four. Glorious batting. A misfield from Livingstone gives him a single, and then Pandya pulls another to deep square. India score 10 for the third consecutive over.     9.08am   KOHLI IS NOT OUT!  Well, I thought it was plumb but in fact it was only clipping leg stump. That means it\u2019s umpire\u2019s call and Kohli survives. I can\u2019t decide whether that\u2019s a remarkably good decision from Paul Reiffel or a really poor one.  Updated at 9.10am GMT    9.07am    15.2 overs: India 102-3 (Kohli 43, Pandya 10) Chris Jordan has bowled 10,000 yorkers in the nets, all for a moment like this. If all goes to plan, he\u2019ll be out form this end. He starts inauspiciously, with a leg-side wide to Pandya, and then knocks Kohli off his feet with a sensational yorker. Paul Reiffel says not out but England go for the review. If it\u2019s pad first, it\u2019s plumber than plumb.  Updated at 9.08am GMT    9.04am    15th over: India 100-3 (Kohli 43, Pandya 9) Livingstone does indeed continue; I suspect this is Woakes\u2019s fourth over that he\u2019s bowling, which would love three from Jordan and two from Curran. After his usual watchful start, four from nine balls, Pandya smears a terrifying boundary just past the umpire\u2019s head. After a couple of useful dot balls for England, Kohli waves a superb boundary through extra cover. Not even Jordan, running round from long off, could stop that. India have scored ten from each of the last two overs. If they keep that up they\u2019ll get to 150 \u2013 but I suspect they\u2019ll be eyeing closer to 170.   Updated at 9.04am GMT    9.00am    14th over: India 90-3 (Kohli 38, Pandya 4) Kohli slashes Woakes past short third man for four, his first boundary since the seventh over. He is so good at vrooming through the gears at the death, so England won\u2019t feel remotely comfortable while he is at the crease. Woakes is wided when Pandya misses a hook stroke. It looked pretty clear to me. A single off every other delivery makes it ten from the over.     8.54am    13th over: India 80-3 (Kohli 31, Pandya 2) Livingstone returns, and Pandya edges consecutive deliveries just short of a fielder, first short third man and then backward point. There\u2019s a bit in this pitch for the spinners, which will interest Axar Patel and Ravichandran Ashwin. A good over from Livingstone, three from it. England have filled their fifth-bowler quota, though they might give Livingstone another one after that.  Updated at 8.59am GMT    8.51am    12th over: India 77-3 (Kohli 29, Pandya 1) Rashid ends another masterful spell with figures of 4-0-20-1. The only boundary he conceded was off his first delivery.   Updated at 8.59am GMT    8.50am   WICKET! India 75-3 (Suryakumar c Salt b Rashid 14)  Adil Rashid has picked up the big wicket! Suryakumar charged down the track and sliced the ball high in the air towards deep point, where Phil Salt took a simple catch. It was a really good delivery, slower and turning just enough to take the edge. Suryakumar goes for 14 from 10 balls; England will take that all day and all of the night.   Updated at 9.02am GMT    8.48am    11th over: India 74-2 (Kohli 27, Suryakumar 14) Ben Stokes returns to the attack. The first ball beats Suryakumar\u2019s attempted violence, but you can\u2019t keep him quiet forever. Or even 10 minutes. After a relatively slow start \u2013 4 from 7 balls \u2013 he lifts a spectacular hook over the keeper\u2019s head for six. He probably didn\u2019t mean it to go that fine, but he certainly intended it to for six. The next balls is blazed over extra cover for four. It\u2019s on! \u201cFar too pumped for any rational analysis here,\u201d writes Andy. \u201cPerhaps harsh on Brook! V good take from Curran though and great over from Jordan.\u201d     8.41am    10th over: India 62-2 (Kohli 26, Suryakumar 3) Suryakumar sweeps Rashid off middle stump for a single. The ball drifted in nicely, and for a split-second England thought he was going to be plumb LBW. Kohli, who is batting with formidable certainty, lifts two more down the ground. But then he berates himself for only managing to whack a full toss for a single. This is good stuff from Rashid, 3-0-17-0. Time for drinks.     8.37am    9th over: India 57-2 (Kohli 23, Suryakumar 1) SKY flicks his first ball to deep square for a single. \u201cDisagree that that was a minor chance for Brook (5th over),\u201d writes Andy. \u201cWent like a rocket but not at full stretch and got his full palm on... at least a half chance. Brook\u2019s fielding has been iffy in tournament in general.\u201d Tough crowd!     8.36am   WICKET! India 56-2 (Rohit c Curran b Jordan 27)  Chris Jordan, who is in for Mark Wood, replaces Livingstone. He doesn\u2019t nail his yorker second ball, and Rohit pings him imperiously over extra cover for a one-bounce four. The non-striker Kohli punches his bat in celebration. But \u2013 pick this cheesy segue out \u2013 it\u2019s England who are celebrating later in the over when Rohit falls for 27! He smeared Jordan high over midwicket, and Curran ran in from the boundary before diving forward to take a superb two-handed catch. Ladies and gentlemen, it\u2019s time for Suryakumar Yadav.    Updated at 9.00am GMT    8.32am    8th over: India 51-1 (Rohit 23, Kohli 22) A moment of fortune for Rohit, who has a hack at Rashid and slices the ball on the bounce to short third man. There\u2019s a bit of turn for Rashid and India are happy enough with five singles from the over. Rohit has 23 from 24 balls, Kohli 22 from 19.     8.28am    7th over: India 46-1 (Rohit 21, Kohli 19) Liam Livingstone replaces Sam Curran (2-0-11-0). Kohli smashes the first ball he faces back over the bowler\u2019s head for four, a shot of delicious contempt, and there are eight runs from the over. This, as Mike Atherton notes, is where England would love to have Mark Wood around to cause some mayhem. And this is another absurd Kohli stat.   Updated at 8.29am GMT    8.26am    6th over: India 38-1 (Rohit 20, Kohli 12) A statement of intent from Rohit, who sweeps Adil Rashid\u2019s first ball emphatically for four. There was a time when Rashid went nowhere near the Powerplay but he has bowled the sixth over a few times in this tournament, most crucially against Sri Lanka. Rashid pulls the over back pretty well, with just three singles from the last five balls. There was almost the chance of a return catch when Rohit smacked the last ball back towards the bowler. Rashid dived low to his left but couldn\u2019t quite get there. \u201cEngland have 11 batters, seven bowlers and two wicketkeepers and a captain who seems to understand his options,\u201d says Gary Naylor. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t guarantee success, but it doesn\u2019t half help.\u201d True, although so does having specialists like Virat, Suryakumar, Bhuvneshwar and Arshdeep.  Updated at 8.27am GMT    8.22am    5th over: India 31-1 (Rohit 14, Kohli 11) Rohit\u2019s off and running. He hits Curran through midwicket for successive boundaries, a languid clip followed by a flamboyant tennis shot. He smashes the next ball towards backward point, where the flying Brook puts down an almost impossible one-handed chance. Technically it\u2019s a drop; in reality he saved three runs. An eventful over continues with an unsuccessful LBW appeal against Kohli. I thought England might review, just because it\u2019s Kohli, but Jos Buttler was calm enough to realise it had pitched outside leg. This is great stuff!   Updated at 8.39am GMT    8.18am    4th over: India 21-1 (Rohit 5, Kohli 10) Blimey. Kohli drives Woakes\u2019s first ball magnificently over extra cover for six. A single takes him to 1100 runs in T20 World Cups, at the obscene average of 85, and there are 10 runs from the over. Rohit is struggling to time it, though we\u2019ve seen him do this in the past and end with 110 off 70 balls. \u201cI wonder if Buttler\u2019s decision to bowl first is a self-challenge?\u201d says John Starbuck. \u201cThere have been a fair few wicketkeeper-openers and it\u2019s always seemed odd to me, since after a full innings of keeping they have to get their batting gear on and play a hugely important role. Are there any stats about the really good keeper-openers, especially those who captain, and their success rates?\u201d You want to talk about this now? (Buttler\u2019s record isn\u2019t very good when opening, captaining, keeping and batting second: 93 runs at 13.28.)     8.13am    3rd over: India 11-1 (Rohit 4, Kohli 2) Sam Curran angles his first ball across Kohli, who pushes nervously and is beaten. The next ball is shorter and does take the edge, but it drops just short of Moeen at slip. Sheesh, that was close.  Curran concedes just a single from a terrific over, which ends with an unsuccessful (and more than a little optimistic) LBW appeal against Rohit. England have started really well.     8.09am    2nd over: India 10-1 (Rohit 4, Kohli 1) Evening Virat. (PS: Virat loves Adelaide.)  Updated at 8.10am GMT    8.08am   WICKET! India 9-1 (Rahul c Buttler b Woakes 5)  Gottim! Chris Woakes strikes with his fourth ball. It kicked from back of a length, and Rahul edged a flashing cut stroke through to Jos Buttler. That was smart bowling from Woakes, whose first three deliveries had been full and straight, too straight in fact, to Rohit Sharma. This was much shorter, much wider, and seemed to take Rahul a bit by surprise.     Updated at 8.23am GMT    8.03am    1st over: India 6-0 (Rahul 5, Rohit 1) And they\u2019re off. Stokes\u2019s first ball is a wide outswinger that KL Rahul back cuts for four. \u201cThis looks, already, a very, very good pitch,\u201d says Ravi Shastri, after two balls. There\u2019s a bit of swing for Stokes, and Rohit Sharma is beaten chasing a full, wide delivery. Rohit pushes the next ball to mid-off to get off the mark, and then Rahul plays and misses at an excellent delivery. A fascinating first over, with something for everyone. Okay not everyone. \u201cGood evening from Brisbane,\u201d says Phil Withall. \u201cI have a small problem. I want England to win, I really want England to win. However, the prospect of 100,000 Indian and Pakistani fans in the MCG is rather exciting. The repetitive drone that is the Barmy Army does get more than a tad repetitive for my tastes. I may be being unfair, I admire their undying support and commitment but the trumpet\u2026\u201d You want to talk about trumpets now?   Updated at 8.12am GMT    7.57am    Ben Stokes will bowl the first over. England would love an early wicket or seven.  Updated at 7.59am GMT    7.56am    The players line up for the anthems. Some look relaxed, others intense. There\u2019s more than one gameface for an occasion like this.    Updated at 8.10am GMT    7.52am         7.45am    I\u2019m off to grab a coffee. See you in a bit for \u2013 gulp \u2013 India v England in the World Cup semi-final.     7.44am    \u201cRob,\u201d says Yog Wadhwa, \u201cIndians are without their first-choice fast bowler and spinning allrounder - Jasprit Bumrah and Ravindra Jadeja.\u201d I know, I was being flippant. It shows the depth of both squads that the first XIs still look so strong. I\u2019d fancy an India C team to make the semi-finals.   Updated at 8.03am GMT    7.40am    \u201cYour mention of India winning the last four series between the teams got me thinking about the unpredictability of T20 as the chaos theory version of cricket,\u201d says Tom Van der Gucht. \u201cEverything, at some point, as to happen: England are therefore due a win against them... Hopefully\u2026  \u201cBut, in terms of the cricketing gods playing a larger game with the teams merely their chess pieces, a final between Pakistan and India would be the more glorious conclusion\u2026 So, I suppose it comes down to the old clash between science and religion as to who will progress.\u201d William Goldman knew a lot about cricket.     7.38am    England are without almost half of their best T20 XI \u2013 Bairstow, Malan, Archer, Wood and Topley. Let\u2019s get the excuses in early, eh.   Updated at 8.00am GMT    7.35am   Team news: Wood misses out  Mark Wood has failed his fitness test and is replaced by Chris Jordan. That might be a blessing in disguise for England, although of course England would love Wood\u2019s breathtaking pace. The only other change is Phil Salt for Dawid Malan. Salt is carded to bat at No3, though Eoin Morgan says he would open with him because of his ability to go hard from ball one in the Powerplay. India are unchanged, which means Rishabh Pant \u2013 another hitter who is very strong square of the wicket \u2013 is preferred to Dinesh Karthik. Look at that middle order, and gulp if you\u2019re an England fan: Kohli, Suryakumar, Pant, Pandya. India KL Rahul, Rohit Sharma (c), Virat Kohli, Suryakumar Yadav, Rishabh Pant (wk), Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Ravichandran Ashwin, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed Shami, Arshdeep Singh. England Buttler (c/wk), Hales, Salt, Stokes, Brook, Ali, Livingstone, Curran, Woakes, Jordan, Rashid.  Updated at 7.46am GMT    7.32am   England win the toss and bowl  Well that\u2019s interesting. England have been nervous chasers this year, but it\u2019s been their preferred approach since the revolution in 2015. Rohit Sharma drily notes that India would have batted anyway.  Updated at 7.53am GMT    7.21am    It\u2019s a beautiful evening in Adelaide, so you can put the DLS sheet away. The pitch is used, though it\u2019s nearly a week since the last game so the curator has had plenty of time to freshen it up. All the commentators think it looks like a belter. The toss isn\u2019t straightforward, not least because \u2013 absurd statgasm alert \u2013 all 11 T20Is on this ground have been won by the team that lost the toss. Psychologically, batting first important for England but the can come on nicely under the lights.  Updated at 7.37am GMT    7.17am    Early team news Dawid Malan is definitely out with a groin injury, and Mark Wood is doubtful. Phil Salt and Chris Jordan \u2013 whose yorkers are a good option on a ground with such short square boundaries \u2013 are likely to come in. India have one big decision to make: Dinesh Karthik or Rishabh Pant.      7.15am    Simon Burnton\u2019s big-match preview      7.00am   Preamble  At last. Since white-ball cricket was invented in 2015, England and India have been the best teams in the world. But in that time, they have danced around each other at major tournaments. They\u2019ve met only once, never in the knockout stages. They were on course for a humdinger of a final in 2016 (World T20), 2017 (Champions Trophy) and especially 2019 (World Cup), but on each occasion one of them was beaten in the semi-finals. They won\u2019t meet in the final this year either, but we\u2019ll happily make do with a blockbusting semi-final: India v England in Adelaide for the right to play \u2013 oh yes \u2013 a rampant Pakistan in the final on Sunday. It\u2019s been a long time coming. But unlike many long-awaited rumbles \u2013 Mayweather v Pacquiao, Tyson v Lewis, Barlow v Baldwin \u2013 this will take place with both parties close to their peak. Though England and India each have a bigger rival, their matches still have a unique intensity. (Don\u2019t mention the M word, but keep an eye out for it if the game gets fractious.) There is also huge mutual respect, fostered mainly through the IPL. Both teams recognise in each other the thing that elite sportsfolk crave the most: a worthy adversary. India go into today\u2019s game as slight favourites. They\u2019ve won their last four T20 series against England, which must count for something; they are No1 in the world rankings and have played better cricket than England in this tournament \u2013 even though, paradoxically, they were closer to the brink during their win over Bangladesh. There\u2019s also a argument that India are under more pressure to win \u2013 firstly because they haven\u2019t won a global tournament since 2013, secondly because they are India, thirdly because they are India. England, as an endearingly candid Moeen Ali said the other day, would like another white-ball trophy to confirm their greatness. They have a history of raising their game for the toughest opponents, certainly at World Cups, and a few key players \u2013 Jos Buttler, Alex Hales, Mark Wood (though he is an injury doubt), Sam Curran \u2013 are bang in form. If you are into the whole positive-accentuation thing, those who aren\u2019t in form are due. Buttler\u2019s new-ball contest with Bhuvneshwar Kumar, who has caused him all sorts of trouble in the recent past*, could be vital. England also need plans for Virat Kohli, who averages 123 in this tournament and a scandalous 84 at all T20 World Cups \u2013 and for Suryakumar Yadav, the freest spirit in world cricket. Suryakumar should love the short square boundaries at the Adelaide Oval. England could do with \u2013 here comes the cheesy pun \u2013 a bit of blue-SKY thinking, because nobody seems to have a clue how to bowl to a man who can hit any ball for six. It might just be an extended purple patch, but at the moment it feels like he is redefining middle-order batting. He has a T20I strike rate of 180, and abracadabrad 117 from 55 balls against England in the summer. The good news for England is that they won that game. The bad news is that it was a dead rubber because they\u2019d already lost the series. In short, nobody knows anything, but it\u2019s England v India in a World Cup knockout game for the first time since Graham Gooch\u2019s sweepathon in 1987**. If your mouth isn\u2019t watering, you should seek urgent medical advice. * In T20Is Buttler has scored 30 from 32 balls off Bhuvneshwar \u2013 and been dismissed five times ** The infamous group game in 1999 was effectively a knockout, though that only became apparent at the start of the second innings  Updated at 7.43am GMT "

                    "body": "The Women\u2019s T20 World Cup is fast approaching and yet the Women\u2019s Premier League that follows it in March is the talk of the town. Television rights sold for \u00a395m with players set to earn in excess of six figures. This Indian revolution, to use a cliche, will be a gamechanger. Looking on at its formation with interest is the England captain, Heather Knight, and for a couple of reasons. Not only will the 32-year-old\u2019s name be in the forthcoming auction \u2013 an unimaginable scenario when she started playing boy\u2019s cricket at Plymstock CC in Devon, aged eight \u2013 but because it is a topic she knows better than most.  Before departing for South Africa at the start of last week, and a World Cup campaign that will look to break Australia\u2019s recent dominance, starting against West Indies on 11 February, Knight was finishing off a dissertation on this very subject: how the rise of franchise cricket will affect the women\u2019s game. It was the final submission for a master\u2019s in leadership in sport at the Institute of Sports Humanities, with Ed Smith, the former men\u2019s national selector, the course director marking her work. Before pressing send, Knight discussed the year ahead and cricket\u2019s dramatically changing landscape. \u201cI think the women\u2019s IPL will be a great thing for the game,\u201d says Knight, fresh from a chilly pre-World Cup training session at the England and Wales Cricket Board\u2019s performance centre in Loughborough. \u201cIt could really kickstart things in other countries. Already with the Hundred, the ECB are thinking: \u2018How are we going to match this?\u2019 \u201cBut there are some possible negatives, if it\u2019s not handled properly. The differences in pay and professionalism around the world are way more stark in the women\u2019s game compared to the men\u2019s. There also isn\u2019t the same depth in talent for a number of countries. There is the Hundred, the Big Bash, the FairBreak T20, maybe a Pakistan Super League \u2013 if a few of their semi-professional players go fully freelance, that will affect the international game a lot. \u201cThe best place you can be is both international and domestic cricket thriving. But you need a good solid plan of how that looks for all countries, not like the men\u2019s game where it has just been allowed to happen without any direction. The women\u2019s game will change far quicker as a result of this.\u201d With her captaincy cap on, Knight is also mindful of how the likely injection of cash into various pockets could affect England\u2019s World Cup campaign. The expectation is that, come auction day, her players could be split into haves and have-nots. With \u00a31.1m per 15-strong squad and seven overseas slots, salaries may well eclipse central contracts for some and differ to the pecking order of the national setup. \u201cWe have to see it as a bonus,\u201d Knight says, after explaining the reserve prices for capped players that sit between \u00a325,000 and \u00a340,000. \u201cIt will create a different dynamic, because the idea of being in an auction is so new to the women\u2019s game. Being able to manage that as individuals and a group will be vital.  \u201cOur head coach, Jon Lewis, brings knowledge of this from the men\u2019s game. Our team doctor was saying the other day he was on a men\u2019s tour where they sat down to watch a draft or auction together and it massively derailed them. I see my role as looking after the younger players, keeping them on track and grounded.\u201d England have certainly had a recent injection of youth, much of it when Knight was sidelined by a hip injury last summer. Lauren Bell has pepped up the attack, while a power player such as the 18-year-old Alice Capsey could fly at auction. The latter\u2019s importance to England is underlined by her presence in the World Cup squad while still recovering from the broken collarbone suffered in Antigua last month. That tour was an uncompetitive 8-0 Caribbean cruise, which underlined Knight\u2019s point about the depth \u2013 and finances \u2013 outside Australia, England and India. But it was not without positives. Nat Sciver and Katherine Brunt returned strongly after time out for personal reasons, while Knight began life alongside Lewis \u2013 her third head coach as captain \u2013 amid a drive to \u201cfree up\u201d players for a more aggressive outlook. It feels the way to go with Australia having won the last four global titles since Knight lifted the 50-over World Cup at Lord\u2019s in 2017. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a huge difference,\u201d she insists, \u201cand in T20 the gap is the smallest. It\u2019s maybe just that injuries or absences affect us more; they have a lot of depth after eight years of the Women\u2019s Big Bash League.\u201d Meg Lanning\u2019s defending champions are in Group A, with India representing England\u2019s immediate threat on the other side of the draw. Their encounter in Gqeberha on 18 February has some added spice, too. A 3-0 ODI series defeat to Harmanpreet Kaur\u2019s side last summer ended in controversial fashion when Deepti Sharma ran out Charlie Dean at the non-striker\u2019s end at Lord\u2019s to spark a fierce Mankad debate. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be built up as a grudge match but we can\u2019t look at it like that,\u201d Knight says. \u201cWhat happened, happened. We\u2019ve had a lot of success against them, especially in World Cups and when we beat them 3-0 in the Twenty20 series before those ODIs. The only focus will be on performance.\u201d Though injured at the time, Knight joined the debate about Dean\u2019s dismissal when, in response to Sharma saying she had warned the then 21-year-old about backing up, she posted on Twitter that the Indian all-rounder was \u201clying\u201d. \u201cYeah, that was quite strong in hindsight,\u201d admits Knight, wincing. \u201cReflecting on it, and knowing Deepti well, it was probably a slip of the tongue. For me it was about protecting a young player.\u201d Is her team now considering that mode of dismissal? \u201cI think there has to be a rule that stops [the non-striker stealing ground]. It divides opinion but it\u2019s not something we\u2019re looking to do unless someone is taking the piss. And it\u2019s something we\u2019re going to talk about being mindful of, because it\u2019s a stupid way to get out.\u201d  Along with the T20 World Cup and the new WPL, 2023 takes on even greater significance with a multi-format Ashes in parallel with the men this summer. Ticket sales are strong \u2013 more than 14,000 sold for the first T20 at Edgbaston \u2013 and Knight is hoping her side emulates the impact of Leah Williamson\u2019s footballers last year. \u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019ve spoken about as a group,\u201d says Knight. \u201cWatching the Lionesses and the shot in the arm for the sport was remarkable \u2013 we want a piece of that. Winning the World Cup in 2017 did a bit but with the Hundred now, it feels like the landscape is more prepared for something similar. \u201cThe Ashes will be our most visible series ever. I really like the fact it\u2019s being marketed together with the men\u2019s. There are no clashes, it brings the teams together and just normalises England cricket as one. If they\u2019re separate, and you\u2019re watching as a kid, you become ingrained to put the men\u2019s game on a pedestal.\u201d After seven years and 139 matches in charge, Knight\u2019s drive appears strong. There has been just one wobble along the way, early last year after a draining, Covid-restricted three-month tour of Australia and New Zealand. \u201cI thought: \u2018I\u2019m not sure I can do this any more,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cThe pandemic was serious hard work as captain. I know Joe [Root] found it the same.\u201d While Root called time, Knight ploughed on and was re-energised by the new faces. But last summer\u2019s absence exposed a lack of alternatives, and though Sciver, possibly reluctant to step up in the past, is back as vice-captain, Knight wants more leaders. \u201cIt\u2019s not about a successor, more players dictating the direction, not always looking to the coaches,\u201d she says. \u201cI still feel I can make an impact as captain. I\u2019d never say never about going back into the ranks but it\u2019s not something I have thought about.\u201d As a batter who goes on \u201cfeel\u201d rather than technical precision, Knight also fancies she is on the verge of a return to her best. As such, with the dissertation now in, a sport about to dramatically change means there is no rush to think about the next chapter."

                    "body": "All the focus is on Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and Lionel Messi but if Argentina want to win the World Cup final, the man they will need to stop is Antoine Griezmann. Mbapp\u00e9 has the No 10 on the back of his shirt but his teammate is playing the role to perfection.\nGriezmann links everything together for France. Without the Atl\u00e9tico Madrid forward, Mbapp\u00e9, Olivier Giroud and Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 would not be getting the ball as much. No one has more than his three assists and that level of creativity will need to be stymied by Argentina.\nGriezmann\u2019s overall performance has been outstanding. He has a slightly different role to the one at club level. He still operates as a No 10 but he has the freedom to roam for France, allowing him to drop deeper to collect the ball so he can affect the game more. The best No 10s have three ways of playing \u2013 they can operate in tight spaces, have the ability to run in behind and can also play as a winger \u2013 and he can do all of these.\n\nI would advise Argentina to be physical with Griezmann. These types of players do not like the aggressive side when they are given no space or time on the ball. Argentina need to stop the ball at source to prevent it from getting to Mbapp\u00e9, Giroud and Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, who are more than capable of causing damage.\nGriezmann has not shirked his defensive responsibilities. Against Morocco he was really good and at times he was acting as a centre-back when the ball was coming into the box. In addition to natural talent, players at the top require that level of drive and determination to help their team.\nThe Netherlands have offered France a plan to think about after troubling Argentina in the quarter-final. The aerial threat of Wout Weghorst highlighted that Argentina can struggle with the direct approach and that is something Giroud could make the most of. I am a huge fan of him, a great player who has had a fantastic career. He comes up with big goals at crucial moments and this is the occasion for those types of players.\n\nFrance have looked solid at the back, further aided by Ibrahima Konat\u00e9 coming into the team against Morocco. They will need their back four and midfield to be perfect against Argentina and a certain Paris Saint-Germain forward.\nIf it is Messi\u2019s last game for Argentina, he is going to turn it up another level. I have seen Messi in person for his club a couple of times but had not seen him play for his country before this World Cup. He has blown me away.\nI know he walks around a lot waiting for those moments to pounce but when he does he is incredibly clinical and ruthless. It was mesmerising to watch him live. Every time he got the ball it was like the stage light was focused on him. Yes, everyone speaks about him, but how can you ignore him when he is that good?\nMessi will be looking to make the most of France\u2019s mistakes. Both teams will aim to have good shape and sit behind the ball, with neither particularly wanting possession. France had 39% possession against Morocco and 43% against England and Argentina were on the back foot until they scored the opener against Croatia. Luka Modric et al had 61% possession but were caught out by the genius of Messi.\nIt is interesting that neither side really press. France did not Morocco in the semi-final; they went round the deep-lying midfielder and were quite happy if the ball went into him. Similarly, you do not see Messi or Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez pressing \u2013 they just drop off and wait.\nThe finalists are not dominating the ball or pressing teams, but they have players capable of magic moments, and plenty of them. Mbapp\u00e9 has not been at his best in the past two games, but he showed against Morocco that in the blink of an eye he can beat two players with incredible skill and create a goal.\n\nThe first goal, cliched as it sounds, will be important on Sunday. France scored early against Morocco, putting their opponents on the back foot, and Argentina dominated after taking the lead against Croatia. It will be interesting to see the effect an opening goal has on the opposition and how they adapt their tactics. It suited France that Morocco were trying to get back into the game because it allowed them to counterattack with pace.\nBoth teams have shown they can be physical and that should make it a spicy final. I think the majority inside the stadium will be Argentinians, which could have an impact.\nThe France fans were outnumbered by Moroccans but their team coped with the pressure, which will be heightened on Sunday. France have the experience of winning a World Cup and have progressed through the quarter- and semi\u2011finals despite not being at their best. That\u2019s what good teams do.\nIt is going to be a tight game, too close to call. But France and Argentina have players who can make something from almost nothing."

                    "body": "Before kick-off Herv\u00e9 Renard denied that Saudi Arabia\u2019s government had gifted his players a Rolls Royce apiece in recognition of their achievement in beating Argentina. The Green Falcons\u2019 French manager reminded everyone his team had not yet escaped the group stage and, to the considerable dismay of the massed Saudi support congregated in Doha, Robert Lewandowski revelled in reinforcing the point before promptly bursting into tears.\nPoland\u2019s record scorer not only finally registered his first World Cup goal but created Piotr Zielinski\u2019s opener as Renard\u2019s initially dominant team missed a penalty and ultimately ran out of steam.\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of my players,\u201d said Renard, whose hopes of guiding Saudi to a first knockout appearance since 1994 hinge on the outcome of their final Group C match against Mexico. \u201cBut we weren\u2019t efficient and Poland are strong. They have three fantastic players in Wojciech Szczesny, Piotr Zielinski and Robert Lewandowski. Congratulations to Lewandowski on his first World Cup goal ... but we are still alive.\u201d\n\n\u201cLewangoalski\u201d was suitably delighted. \u201cI always wanted to score at a World Cup and my dream came true,\u201d he said. \u201cI was so emotional. I can confirm they were tears of joy. As Poland\u2019s captain I\u2019m so happy for our team.\u201d\nBarely two minutes into the game he was grimacing after being left limping following a full-blooded, tone-setting Saudi challenge. It was cheered to the rafters by a full house at Education City, where the overwhelmingly Saudi-supporting crowd transformed the stadium into a sea of green. Poland players were booed like pantomime villains every time they touched the ball.\nThe atmosphere served as a tailwind for Renard\u2019s vibrant side and it took an excellent save by Szczesny to palm a shot over the bar from the impressive Mohammed Kanno. Invariably half a yard off the pace at this juncture, Poland were in danger of being submerged by wave upon wave of attacks and it spoke volumes that three of Czeslaw Michniewicz\u2019s players were booked by the 20th minute.\nLewandowski was so starved of service that he dropped ever deeper in search of the ball, and at one point was spotted in the right-back position. Everything changed when Aston Villa\u2019s Matty Cash, Michniewicz\u2019s actual right-back, overlapped, and although Lewandowski could not control Cash\u2019s eventual cross in the manner he would have hoped, he laid it off adroitly to Zielinski.\n\nAs Zielinski\u2019s fabulous first-time volley flew high into the net Poland\u2019s captain smiled for the first time. His frown soon returned, however, when Krystian Bielik caught Saleh al-Shehri\u2019s ankle in the area and a soft penalty was given after a VAR review. Salem al-Dawsari\u2019s poor spot-kick was parried low by Szczesny and the former Arsenal goalkeeper then performed acrobatic wonders to tip Mohammed al-Burayk\u2019s follow-up over the bar.\nSzczesny\u2019s double save was up there with the finest goalkeeping interventions seen at the World Cup. By now it was dark in Doha and Renard desperately needed one of his players to switch the lights back on for his side.\nHowever, Poland\u2019s back four \u2013 Michniewicz had switched from his more familiar defensive trio specifically for this game \u2013 held firm. Indeed they would have increased their advantage but for a header from Arkadiusz Milik and a shot from Lewandowski, who by now was joining the attacking dots for Poland, hitting the bar.\nSaudi Arabia had lost their earlier shape, structure and sharpness, and were visibly tiring. Renard\u2019s typically hyperactive touchline exertions left his trademark fitted white shirt soaked in sweat as he watched his substitutes fail to have the desired effect.\nWhen Abdulellah al-Malki\u2019s heavy, apparently fatigued, touch permitted the often deceptively anonymous yet ever-alert Lewandowski to snatch the ball off his toe the game was up for the Green Falcons. After directing a low left-foot shot under the goalkeeper for his 77th international goal, the Barcelona striker was overcome with emotion and engulfed by teammates, eventually emerging to blow a kiss to the crowd. The result leaves both sides with all to play for.\n\u201cI hope our fans won\u2019t give up on us,\u201d said Renard, fretting that momentum may be ebbing from his team. \u201cMy message is please keep supporting us and help Saudi Arabia make history.\u201d"

                    "body": "\n\nThe main event\nCommiserations, friends: today marks our final Tetris, the sole remaining quadruple-consecutive-match extravaganza which has made the start of this World Cup so immersive and compelling. That\u2019s the sad news. The joyous news is that today is also the day that things get really serious \u2013 most particularly in Group H.\nSouth Korea, who drew 0-0 with Uruguay last week, take on Ghana, who managed to be both promising and shambolic in a 3-2 defeat to Portugal. A positive result there \u2013 either way \u2013 will make things especially interesting, but even if it\u2019s a draw, Portugal v Uruguay is a clash of such prodigious dimensions it makes even Sam Allardyce look insubstantial.\nGiven the attacking talent at Fernando Santos\u2019 disposal, the other Selec\u00e3o should be title contenders. They have a fine young goalkeeper in Diogo Costa and are solid at the back, while boasting offensive options as varied as Jo\u00e3o Cancelo, Bruno Fernandes, Bernardo Silva, Rafael Le\u00e3o and Jo\u00e3o Felix.\n\nHave we forgotten anyone? Well, that depends. It\u2019s easy to look at Portugal, see a side nowhere near as fluidly cohesive as it should be, and cite Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s inflexibility as a major reason why; or, in other words, to say Santos must be brave and pick on merit, not reputation. But conversely, it\u2019s also not that difficult to look at the slower pace of international football and understand why the experience and calmness of one of the greatest players ever is deemed essential.\nInterestingly, Uruguay are in a similar situation. Their centre-back pairing of Diego God\u00edn and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gim\u00e9nez is of sumptuous nastiness, and in front of it can be found the already-excellent and fast-improving Rodrigo Bentancur alongside Federico Valverde, one of this season\u2019s most devastating attacking players. In attack, the coltish, brutish Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez will definitely start but Luis Su\u00e1rez \u2013 another ageing superstar who can be useful in front of goal but otherwise trends towards anonymity \u2013 may not.\nRegardless of who\u2019s picked, we\u2019re set for a tense and juddering encounter. In the second half of their match against Ghana, Portugal looked to have found some kind of balance, the introduction of Le\u00e3o\u2019s pace and intelligent running helping create space for Fernandes\u2019 incisive passing.\nSimilarly, in the closing stages of their opening match against South Korea, it was Uruguay who doing more to force a winner \u2013 especially once Su\u00e1rez was replaced by Edinson Cavani who, though he is the same age, has aged better. Ultimately, it\u2019s impossible to predict an outcome with any authority, and that\u2019s exactly as it should be. As Alex Trebek used to say, let\u2019s play jeopardy! DH\nTalking points\nMisadventures on the mic\u201cExpect the USA to play the same system,\u201d announced Martin Keown confidently as Croatia kicked off their match against, erm, Canada. Not the best start from the Beeb\u2019s endearingly oddball co-commentator, whose North American buddies did him an immediate solid by diverting attention away from the slip-up with a dazzling goal. After a gentle detour into his England career in which Keown bemoaned having been picked for two World Cups without getting on the pitch (a fair enough qualm, though perhaps not one shared by Tony Adams, Sol Campbell or Rio Ferdinand) came his two-penneth on protective face masks: \u201cI used to just get on with it.\u201d After attributing Croatia\u2019s first goal to somebody called \u201cKramavic\u201d, the real highlight was Marko Livaja\u2019s strike, which brought a gloriously mixed metaphor from our man in the gantry: \u201cThat had Croatia DNA written all over it!\u201d Live broadcasting: not as easy as it looks, kids. AH\nCosta Rica restore defensive prideIn the run-up to the World Cup, Costa Rica established a reputation as masters of the low block. In 12 games this calendar year they had conceded six goals, largely down to the heroic goalkeeping of Keylor Navas and the granite centre-back pairing of \u00d3scar Duarte and Francisco Calvo. It seemed a bit out of character, then, when they were absolutely wellied by Spain, passed into oblivion in their joint-record heaviest defeat. Following up with a tight 1-0 win against Japan might make them seem wildly unpredictable, but really it\u2019s a return to the norm. With one shot on target, one goal and three points from 180-plus minutes of football, they are remarkably efficient for a side that began the tournament with a 7-0 defeat. WM\n\nBeyond the football\nUSA v Iran: not a fixture that needs any extra needle. But that\u2019s what Tuesday\u2019s fixture has been given \u2013 and by the bucketload \u2013 following a remarkable demand by Iran that their opponents are given a 10-game ban for \u201coffending the dignity\u201d of their country. The furore comes after the US Soccer Federation posted an image on social media of Iran\u2019s national flag without the emblem of the Islamic Republic. The federation explained that it did so in \u201csupport for the women in Iran fighting for basic human rights\u201d. The graphic has since been deleted from social media, but the the semi-official Tasnim news agency has reported a legal adviser at the Iranian football federation has requested their Group B rivals are banned in accordance with section 13 of Fifa rules. The Iran flag has become a point of contention at this World Cup, with fans who oppose the regime in Tehran waving the lion and sun flag instead. AH\nGlobal media-watch\nAfter decrying the \u201cnightmare\u201d of the defeat by Saudi Arabia, the Argentinian newspaper Ol\u00e9 greeted Saturday\u2019s victory as \u201ca colossal relief\u201d \u2013 and a rescue job by Lionel Messi. Unsurprisingly the other papers have followed suit, largely overlooking Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s late golazo in favour of placing the focus squarely on the man wearing No 10. P\u00e1gina 12 hailed the win as a \u201cstrength of hope\u201d, Clar\u00edn called it \u201ca triumph to get excited again\u201d and Tiempo described the side as having won \u201cthe first final\u201d. In Mexico, meanwhile, there will be no public holidays doled out, Cancha describing the team as \u201con the canvas\u201d with one point from two matches.\n\nThe internet reacts\nOn the back of their shock dethroning of Germany, Japan fans went into their Group E meeting with Costa Rica in high spirits \u2013 and in full regalia.\n\nIn the end, what they witnessed was something of a sickener: their side dominated the game without scoring before Keysher Fuller\u2019s late gut-punch of a winner blew the group wide open. But while the mood was dampened among the Japanese fans, they made sure not to abandon their famed habit of clearing up the stands after the final whistle, the shock result lending a note of melancholy to the wholesome tradition.\nIt was a decidedly mixed day for Canada fans, who got to see their nation\u2019s first-ever goal at a men\u2019s World Cup finals \u2013 only for Croatia to hit back with four goals, destroying John Herdman\u2019s claim that his team would \u201ceff Croatia\u201d. Andrej Kramaric, who got two of those goals, offered the quote of the day in response.\n\nToday\u2019s matches\nCameroon v Serbia (Group G, 10am GMT, ITV1) Both teams must recover from opening defeats and find their first goals of the tournament. Since the glory of their run to the quarter-finals in 1990, Cameroon have not made it out of the group stages while Serbia have never reached the knockouts. Will Dragan Stojkovic play both his star forwards in Dusan Vlahovic and Aleksandar Mitrovic? They spent just 17 second-half minutes together as Brazil ran away with the game in Serbia\u2019s opener. Rigobert Song, the Cameroon coach whose tracksuits have made him a cult hero, must find a way to get service to Eric Choupo-Moting and Bryan Mbeumo in attack. JB\nSouth Korea v Ghana (Group H, 1pm GMT, BBC1) Andr\u00e9 Ayew has a simple plan for Ghana as they look to recover from losing to Portugal. \u201cWe need to stay calm, relax and increase our performance,\u201d said the captain. \u201cWe need to try and score more and concede less.\u201d Portugal\u2019s defence was given a scare during that 3-2 win but also found great gaps in Ghana\u2019s defence. The Koreans could not yield a shot on target against Uruguay but dealt well enough with the physical challenge of the South Americans. The masked Son Heung-min was something of a passenger, when so much usually relies on him, and the probable absence of Napoli\u2019s Kim Min-jae in defence is another big problem for coach Paulo Bento. JB\n\nBrazil v Switzerland (Group G, 4pm, ITV1) Neymar will miss the rest of the group stage at the very least, allowing Brazil\u2019s gang of attacking talents the chance to show what they can do without their crown prince. For the moment, Richarlison, following his two goals against Serbia, takes on the burden. Antony replaced Neymar against Serbia but has suffered from \u201cflu-like symptoms and vomiting\u201d \u2013 as have Lucas Paquet\u00e1 and Alisson \u2013 so perhaps Gabriel Jesus might yet be selected. Murat Yakin, the Swiss coach, is a lifelong fan of the Brazilian national team, inherited from his 89-year-old mum who idolised Pel\u00e9. \u201cThey won\u2019t get any weaker,\u201d he said of Neymar\u2019s absence. JB\nPortugal v Uruguay (Group H, 7pm ITV1) Monday\u2019s primetime viewing will likely see Cristiano Ronaldo, 37 and Luis Su\u00e1rez, 35, both currently clubless, lead the frontlines ahead of younger attacking talent. On Saturday, Ronaldo treated his teammates to a slap-up meal at the Tatel de Doha restaurant on Al Maha Island, a flashy joint he has a business interest in. Danilo Pereira\u2019s injury, suffered when playing in central defence against Ghana, leaves Fernando Santos short, and Pepe, 39, may step in. Uruguay did not manage a shot on target against South Korea in their opener. JB\nPlayer to watch\nBryan Mbeumo In Cameroon\u2019s pedestrian 1-0 defeat to Switzerland , the Brentford forward was their most dangerous player. His ability from set-pieces and ingenuity in open play caused problems for the Swiss defence despite Cameroon\u2019s general unwillingness to attack. Last season, Mbeumo created seven goals and scored four of his own in 35 Premier League appearances. With more ambition, a team that will have Eric Choupo-Moting or Vincent Aboubakar up front should be a greater threat but they need to give their creative talent greater freedom. WU\n\nAnd finally \u2026\nMartin Boyle was ruled out of Australia\u2019s campaign with an ACL injury, but remains in high spirits. So much so he has been appointed as the team\u2019s \u201cofficial vibes manager\u201d, a job title coming with enormous pressure to curate a genre-defining tropical house playlist. \u201cWe\u2019ve moved him into the staff now ... he\u2019s just one of the most fantastic blokes you will meet in your life,\u201d explained Graham Arnold, the Socceroos manager. Arnold brought Boyle, wearing knee brace and walking with crutches, into the team huddle to celebrate their crucial 1-0 win against Tunisia. If that doesn\u2019t give them good vibes then, probably, nothing will. WM"

                    "body": "Gareth Southgate\u2019s words were diplomatic but his eyes and broad smile told the real story. The subject was that video, the one of the Wales squad celebrating wildly upon England\u2019s Euro 2016 exit against Iceland in the last 16. Would the England manager draw upon it before the World Cup meeting with Wales on Tuesday night?\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t say,\u201d Southgate replied. \u201cWe are aware of some of that but I couldn\u2019t say if we would use it or not \u2026\u201d\nAs Southgate trailed off, all that was missing from him was a nod. The clip had landed, all right. Southgate was an observer for Uefa\u2019s technical committee that night rather than a part of the England setup but he felt it \u2013 a shovel of salt to an open wound.\n\nThe subsequent Wales explanations did not exactly smooth things over \u2013 the protestations of having been lost in the romance of Iceland\u2019s moment, the kinship with an underdog nation. Perhaps the Wales players were just sorry that the footage had leaked. Then again maybe they were not.\nLuke Shaw has already referenced it here in Qatar, the defender saying that England are a \u201crespectful group\u201d who \u201cdo things in the right way\u201d. In other words, they would not gloat at the demise of a rival. But the dynamics of an England fixture against one of the home nations have long been peculiarly lopsided, the impression being that they do not have as much to gain in victory and so much more to lose in defeat.\nEddie Jones, the England rugby union head coach and a confidant of Southgate\u2019s, has often said the home nations want to beat his team more than anything and it has been possible to argue that Wales would paint their World Cup as a relative success if they were to win \u201cThe Battle of Britain\u201d \u2013 even if it were not enough to carry them through to the last 16.\nSouthgate might not have chosen to have a derby like this at a major tournament, loaded with the potential for chaos, when control can be difficult to find. It did not work out too well when it last came up \u2013 the second group game at Euro 2020, when his team laboured to a 0-0 draw against Scotland, the manager saying the heat of the occasion had affected his players.\nSouthgate described the game as a \u201creference point\u201d, one in which Scotland \u201cfound a level physically they hadn\u2019t found before and couldn\u2019t find in the game after\u201d. Then again, he continued, was it not ever thus when England play? He noted how the USA had covered more ground against his team in the 0-0 draw last Friday than any other opponent across his six-year tenure. \u201cIt will be interesting to see if they can replicate that in their next game,\u201d he said.\n\nSouthgate will not shy from embracing the emotion of the showpiece at the Ahmed bin Ali Stadium. He wants to channel it. \u201cIf people want to say that Wales will have more passion, then no problem, but they wouldn\u2019t know our dressing room very well. Or any of the England dressing rooms I was in as a player. That\u2019s an easy narrative for people to say. It\u2019s not my experience of it.\u201d\nOn the other hand, Southgate knows cool heads must accompany the hot hearts. As ever, balance is everything. \u201cYou have to match the spirit [of Wales] and display the quality with the ball that allows us to be ruthless. We have to make sure our emotional focus is on what we do well.\u201d\nIt has been easy to see the parallels between England\u2019s Euro 2020 campaign and their World Cup so far. An encouraging victory in the opening match (Croatia at the European Championship; Iran here) followed by an underwhelming stalemate after which the team were booed off. And now, as before the Czech Republic fixture at Euro 2020, there is the demand for a cohesive, front-footed win \u2013 and featuring a fresh face in the forward line. Against the Czechs, the clamour was for Jack Grealish, who came in and played well. Now it is for Phil Foden.\nSouthgate, who is into his fourth World Cup, is all too familiar with the drama, including those around team selection. \u201cWhen I was playing, the players were more narky about it. Every country has got it. We are 32 teams \u2026 26 are in crisis at the moment.\n\n\u201cEvery individual country has their support entirely focused on them. You have to live with that, be strong enough and calm enough to come through that. You are never sitting comfortably and, if we were, that would be a worry because you don\u2019t want that comfort. You need an edge.\u201d\nThe key difference between now and the European Championship or, indeed, the 2018 World Cup, is that Southgate\u2019s team have not qualified after two games. England need something against Wales, especially to progress as the group leaders, although they do not need very much to avoid elimination \u2013 anything other than a four-goal defeat.\nSouthgate will make changes against a Wales team he suspects could change their system. \u201cEvery team we have played has defended slightly differently against us because they recognise our threat,\u201d he said.\nEngland defeated Wales at the Euro 2016 group stage with a last-gasp Daniel Sturridge goal but it was Wales who went further, all the way to the semi-finals, and how they revelled in the achievement. It has not been forgotten."

                    "body": "Denmark have a problem, Martin Braithwaite reckons. They\u2019re too nice, and way too modest. Or they were, anyway. \u201cDanes are so humble that they will never claim they\u2019re capable of big things, even though it\u2019s in our DNA with the Vikings,\u201d the former Barcelona striker says, laughing as he realises how far back he\u2019s going in search of lost national character.\n\u201cSometimes that\u2019s the Danish mentality: so humble we\u2019re too humble. As Danes, something has been missing: not arrogance exactly, but the confidence to go and do it.\u201d No more. So here\u2019s the thing, a clear message: Denmark have come to win the World Cup.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a change in mindset for players and the population: the belief we can really do this, we\u2019re genuinely good,\u201d Braithwaite says, because it was time someone did. \u201cBefore, people were happy to win a couple of games. Now people say: \u2018Wow, we have a team that can actually win things.\u2019 Which doesn\u2019t mean being overconfident: that\u2019s where the humbleness and hard work kicks in. That\u2019s why we\u2019re serious contenders.\u201d\n\nDenmark won nine of 10 qualifying games, scoring 30 and conceding three, defeated France twice in the Nations League and reached the semi-final of Euro 2020. If they were unlucky, maybe even robbed, against England \u2013 \u201cdefinitely robbed\u201d Braithwaite shoots back, laughing \u2013 something shifted that summer. \u201cThat\u2019s where we saw we had the quality, that things changed,\u201d he says. \u201cWe came sneaking past people\u2019s eyes.\n\u201cI said before the Euros: \u2018Don\u2019t count us out: we can do something special\u2019 and now people have a different view because it was not luck, it was not a coincidence. We have a very strong team player by player, a good game plan, and it\u2019s very difficult to beat us. We\u2019re a really, really strong side. We have a special relationship and atmosphere: we don\u2019t have that competition you see at clubs, where you just want to play ahead of the other guy.\u201d\n\nAsked whether the cardiac arrest that Christian Eriksen suffered played a part in changing the team, Braithwaite says: \u201cIt changed each individual, more than just the group: it was beyond football.\u201d There\u2019s a prolonged pause, his tone quiet when he eventually starts up again. \u201cLife passes by so fast, you need to enjoy every moment. We went through it together, will always share that feeling. It\u2019s kind of a fairytale now that we\u2019re at the World Cup and Christian part of the team. No one could imagine that.\u201d\nBraithwaite can still see the moment, still feel the fear. But, he says: \u201cIt\u2019s not the same fear now as those first days. The first game we played without him, you felt this energy in the stadium, something special: something emotional, powerful, the way the fans tried to carry us. He seemed really relaxed afterwards; you didn\u2019t see fear, [just] determination about what he wanted to do. We\u2019re so happy for him as a person and being able to do what he loves again is even better, and at a top level. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d\n\nFor Braithwaite there has also been a return. He played all bar five minutes at the Euros, but a cartilage injury then saw him miss four months. Having opened 2021-2022, Barcelona\u2019s first post-Messi, with two goals and an assist, he returned to find a new manager and few opportunities, the club trying to force his departure. On deadline day city rivals Espanyol appeared.\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy, a lot happened in one year,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter recovering from injury, I thought I would continue. I was ready, I\u2019d put in the work, but I saw I wasn\u2019t needed. It was strange. There\u2019s a lot happening, a lot of politics. I had proved I could be important but didn\u2019t get the chance.\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of the game, how businesses are run sometimes. I knew the club wanted me to move, but I also knew it wasn\u2019t for football reasons. It\u2019s in the past, a life experience. Don\u2019t hold on. I don\u2019t take these things too personally. I know myself, my value. People can\u2019t paint a picture or push me. It\u2019s pretty obvious what was happening, what they were trying to do \u2013 not just with me, but others. Sometimes saying nothing says a thousand words.\u201d\nWhy did it take so long? \u201cThat\u2019s a good question,\u201d Braithwaite says. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I was refusing to go. I had fun reading the papers every day: everyone had an opinion. I wanted things to go faster too. When Espanyol came I thought: \u2018Wow, this is meant to be.\u2019 It took so long because it had to. Opportunities come but you need to be ready. I\u2019ve been training so hard. I took my personal trainer on holiday. Sometimes my wife was not too happy. I knew I\u2019d find a club. At Espanyol I\u2019ve shown I\u2019m sharp, better daily. I couldn\u2019t have done more, building foundations while everyone was relaxing. I knew I had the World Cup.\u201d\n\nWaiting there will be former teammates. Just the mention of Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 has Braithwaite laughing \u2013 \u201cthat guy just has so much talent it\u2019s unbelievable. I would be confused to have two right feet like him,\u201d he says \u2013 and there is also admiration for Antoine Griezmann.\n\u201cPeople who don\u2019t understand football only see really visual things: going past a defender, scoring goals,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen people rated him \u2013 which I still do \u2013 it was because he was scoring, but he always had so much quality. The way he links midfield and striker, finds the right spaces, the understanding of how to overload, be that extra man. It\u2019s amazing to play with a guy like that. You can combine, he\u2019s generous, works so hard, a true team player.\n\u201cTheir reaction to the draw was the same as mine: \u2018Here we go again.\u2019 We always seem to play France. OK, we\u2019re against one of the best but we\u2019re one of them too \u2013 and we\u2019re confident. We have ambition and belief to do something special. It\u2019s good to play the champions first to show the world we\u2019re taking this competition seriously.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a competition Braithwaite first remembers from 1998 and 2002. Brazil, \u201cmy national team after Denmark\u201d, captured his imagination. Ronaldo especially. \u201cI loved watching him and was really excited to see him return in 2002. I\u2019m going to watch The Phenomenon, definitely. It\u2019s special how Brazilians express their love for the game in a way only they truly manage. I remember getting Eurogoals, trying to copy some of the things Ronaldo did.\u201d\nDid you master any? Braithwaite laughs. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t want to compare myself to a legend. But when I was younger, it would be like: the stepover, the stepover: it\u2019s just amazing how he used that to go past people.\u201d\nEspecially goalkeepers. Ronaldo claimed to have gone round 90 of them to score. Braithwaite ponders the stat. \u201cIt\u2019s true: it doesn\u2019t happen any more. Actually today in training I could have gone round the keeper and didn\u2019t. And yet it\u2019s a lot easier. It\u2019s a really good question: I don\u2019t know why it doesn\u2019t, if the game has changed. It\u2019s actually the best choice.\n\u201cThing is, you also need the calmness. One on one, I try to stay relaxed. It\u2019s about understanding the pace, the angle. It\u2019s like a dance: can you make the keeper move? Sometimes it\u2019s easier than others. If you look at Ronaldo\u2019s goals \u2013 and I\u2019ve studied him so much \u2013 he is so calm, really, really relaxed. My idol? It\u2019s always been that guy.\u201d\nSo if you can\u2019t win the World Cup, would you like Brazil to? There\u2019s the flash of a smile, that new Danish mentality. \u201cThe only team I\u2019m thinking about winning is Denmark. If we can\u2019t, I don\u2019t care,\u201d Braithwaite says. \u201cI\u2019ve pictured myself holding the trophy many times. Hopefully, it will be a reality. I\u2019ve seen the images of \u201892. I would love to be in a team that did the same, and if it\u2019s the World Cup, even better.\u201d"

                    "body": "Last week the Denmark head coach, Kasper Hjulmand, announced he had loose plans to duplicate Christian Eriksen. \u201cI would like to clone him,\u201d he said before the side\u2019s group game against France. \u201cI would like to have him in the back of my own penalty area and in front of the other goal.\u201d\nThe fact that, in the very same press conference, Hjulmand joked that he would also like to borrow Erling Haaland from Norway may reveal something about why they find themselves playing Australia to save their World Cup campaign.\nDenmark arrived in Qatar as the darkest of dark horses, with Eriksen back in glittering form and the Nations League win against France in September a clear sign the team had rekindled the panache which won hearts and minds at Euro 2020. Yet here they are, languishing second-last in Group D, having been held by Tunisia and beaten by Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 (and France). Against the latter they attacked brightly enough to suggest they can \u2013 should \u2013 account for Australia.\n\nEqually, there is also a sense of trepidation among the Danish media and public, about their capacity to right the ship against a much lower-ranked team who played out of their skins against Tunisia. While not the overriding factor, Hjulmand has spoken of his struggle in dealing with the OneLove armband controversy, of which his country has been at the forefront, and Fifa\u2019s rejection of their \u201chuman rights for all\u201d training kits.\nOn the pitch Denmark need goals, pure and simple, and it seems Hjulmand is yet to land on his strongest combination \u2013 one that does not require a clone of his standout player but instead brings out the best in the one he has.\nEriksen \u2013 \u201cthe heart and soul and brains\u201d of the team, according to Kasper Schmeichel on Sunday \u2013 cannot be everywhere all at once. To try would be, as one Danish journalist put it on Monday, damaging to the performances of those around him. Another predicted Hjulmand may shift to a back four in a bid to give Eriksen more freedom than what he had against France. If it works, the 30-year-old could well be the rod in Australia\u2019s back on Wednesday.\n\nHjulmand says Eriksen is the group\u2019s inspiration, as he was even in his absence at the European Championship. But the coach also points to his breadth of goalscorers; to Jesper Lindstr\u00f8m and Andreas Skov Olsen and Kasper Dolberg. \u201cYou cannot expect to push a button and expect to score a lot of goals,\u201d Hjulmand after the France defeat. \u201cWe have a lot of good strikers and we were very close.\u201d\nThe challenge the Socceroos will face is twofold. The first is to break down Denmark\u2019s sound defence. Andreas Christensen, the centre-back who scored against France and practically rugby-tackled Mbapp\u00e9, is quick and brave while Galatasaray\u2019s Victor Nelsson is fast making a name for himself.\nThe second is to repeat the brilliant defensive display that ensured a clean sheet against heavy Tunisia pressure \u2013 and then step it up a notch given the class of this next opponent. There is also perhaps a third: to cast aside for 90 minutes a genuine appreciation for Eriksen\u2019s calibre and for what he has overcome in the 18 months since having a cardiac arrest on the pitch during Denmark\u2019s European Championship group game against Finland.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s such a tremendous player,\u201d the Australia midfielder Keanu Baccus said on Monday. \u201cIt was sad, that moment, for everyone involved in football to see that. But it\u2019s great to see him back. He\u2019s obviously at Man United as well and it\u2019s good to see him back playing for his country because he\u2019s a great player.\u201d\nSince arriving in Doha, the Socceroos have been vocal about their strength as a collective unit despite their relative lack of experience and well-known faces. Ajdin Hrustic explained it by way of the little-known stick analogy.\n\u201cHe\u2019s good,\u201d the attacker said of Eriksen. \u201cBut one manager at Schalke [youth] once put out 11 sticks. He tied \u2019em off then put one stick on the right, and he said: \u2018Boys, do you realise something?\u2019 No one knew what he was talking about and one of the boys said: \u2018There\u2019s 12 sticks out there.\u2019 And he goes: \u2018No, there\u2019s 11 sticks which stick as a team. One stick, which is an individual. Eleven sticks will always be stronger than one.\u2019\u201d\nHelping the case of those 11 metaphorical sticks is Andrew Clark, Australia\u2019s head of sports science who was recently poached by FC Copenhagen and \u201cloaned back\u201d to the national team for the duration of the World Cup. \u201cAndrew Clark is obviously head of sports science and I actually didn\u2019t think the Danish club would release him for that reason,\u201d the Australia head coach, Graham Arnold, said. \u201cHe has a lot of detail on the Danish players.\u201d\nHjulmand was vigilant with his words after the France defeat, careful not to convey overconfidence. \u201cI think we\u2019ve all seen how many people take World Cup results for granted, but a World Cup is something else,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all extremely close. There\u2019s nothing you can take for granted. Australia fight with might, driven on by fantastic team spirit. It will be a hard match. It will be a close match.\u201d"

                    "body": "Michael Gove\u2019s justification for approving the UK\u2019s first coalmine in three decades is \u201cobviously nonsense\u201d and has no climate justification, according to the carbon offsetting standard whose credits could be used to make the operation \u201cnet zero\u201d. Last week, the levelling up secretary gave the green light for the new mine in Whitehaven, Cumbria, which will produce 400,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions a year from mining operations alone, not counting the emissions produced when the coal is used. Gove told the Commons the mine would be \u201cnet zero\u201d, and said he knew of no other mine of its kind in the world that \u201caspires to be net zero in the way the Whitehaven development does\u201d. In the judgment, Gove said he accepted the operation would inevitably release carbon into the atmosphere, but noted that the proposal by West Cumbria Mining included proposals to mitigate residual emissions by buying carbon credits from the Gold Standard carbon credit organisation or an equivalent. These certify greenhouse gas emission reductions from reforestation projects, cooking stove schemes and renewable energy projects, often in the developing world, which are sold on as carbon credits. Margaret Kim, the chief executive of Gold Standard, said using their carbon credits to claim carbon neutrality was \u201cnonsense\u201d. \u201cWe are in a climate emergency and new extraction of fossil fuels is unjustifiable. Our claims guidelines make it clear that to make an offset claim organisations should prioritise the avoidance and reduction of emissions \u2013 something that is clearly impossible for a coalmine,\u201d she said. Owen Hewlett, the chief technical officer of the carbon standard, told the Guardian that the claim by the coalmining firm, which were accepted by Gove, were \u201cobviously nonsense, morally nonsense and technically insane\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly not in line with the science of 1.5C [above pre-industrial levels] warming scenario. And it\u2019s clearly not what we would consider to be offsetting because [the mine] is not an organisation that\u2019s trying to reduce its emissions. We don\u2019t back the offset claim in the first place but you can\u2019t use mitigation as a justification for your new coalmine. \u201cI was pretty shocked at the secretary of state\u2019s position. If you think this is economically and politically the right decision, take that decision and stand by it, but don\u2019t try and somehow kind of point to it being good for the climate. I mean, it\u2019s absurd. \u201cWe think it\u2019s greenwashing nonsense,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s the coalmine\u2019s emissions that are being offset, not the coal. Its greenwashing is similar to the football World Cup in Qatar. It\u2019s smoke and mirrors accounting to say this coalmine is not really doing much damage. The actual emissions of the mining activity are probably not great. But it\u2019s like saying that a gun can\u2019t kill people, it\u2019s the bullets. It doesn\u2019t make any sense, it\u2019s just nonsense thinking.\u201d A spokesperson for the Department of Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said: \u201cThe secretary of state has agreed to grant planning permission for a new metallurgical coalmine in Cumbria as recommended by the independent planning inspector. \u201cThis coal will be used for the production of steel and would otherwise need to be imported. It will not be used for power generation. The mine seeks to be net zero in its operations and is expected to contribute to local employment and the wider economy. \u201cThe reasons for the secretary of state\u2019s decisions are set out in full in his published letter, alongside the report of the independent planning inspector who oversaw the inquiry into the proposal\u201d."

                    "body": "  12.57pm    The match report on Pakistan\u2019s win:      12.02pm         12.00pm    So Pakistan are in the final, which takes place in Melbourne on Sunday (7pm local time, 8am in the UK). If they end up lifting the trophy, they may have to dedicate it to the cricketers of the Netherlands, without whose shock victory over South Africa Pakistan would not have reached this semi-final. But all you can do is take your chances and Babar, Rizwan and the gang took theirs superbly tonight. Tomorrow England and India meet in Adelaide to see which of them will join Pakistan in the final. Do join Rob Smyth for that game, which starts at 6.30pm local time, 8am in the UK. That\u2019s it from me \u2013 thanks for your company.      11.53am    Babar Azam pays tribute to the crowd. \u201cWe are feeling like we\u2019re playing at home!\u201d he says. \u201cEveryone is coming and cheering for Pakistan team.\u201d He gives the rest of the credit to his bowlers: \u201cWe had a good start with the ball, we have good spinners with Shadab and Nawaz bowling very well, and the fast bowlers finished very well.\u201d Modesty forbids him to dwell on his own return to form, which came at just the right time.  Updated at 12.01pm GMT    11.48am    Kane Williamson, as ever, is generous in defeat. \u201cWe were outplayed,\u201d he says. \u201cPakistan bowled really nicely, we managed to wrestle back a little bit of momentum, at half-way we felt that was a competitive total. Very disappointing to not make Pakistan work a lot harder\u2026 They certainly deserve their win.\u201d  Updated at 11.49am GMT    11.40am    Pakistan produced a superb all-round performance. The bowlers allowed New Zealand only 12 boundaries (ten fours, two sixes), with Shaheen Shah Afridi again proving to be the leader of the pack with 2-24. The other bowlers took only one wicket between them but they all kept it tight, with nobody going for more than 8.25 an over. The fielding was sharper than usual. And then Babar and Rizwan, the captain and his mate, suddenly remembered that they are the best international opening pair in the world. They put on 105 and turned a run chase into a cruise. Mohammad Haris, Pakistan\u2019s latest wonder-kid, applied the finishing touches with a nerveless 30.  Updated at 11.43am GMT    11.35am    So New Zealand, the team of the first fortnight of the tournament, are heading home. When Pakistan\u2019s openers found their form, the Kiwis had no plan B. Trent Boult was good, taking 2-33, but the other four bowlers managed only 1-113. The fielding was faulty for once and the captain, Kane Williamson, was too set in his ways, risking neither a sixth bowler nor a Test-match field. It\u2019s especially cruel for Daryl Mitchell, whose record in T20 World Cup semi-finals is unbelievable: 72 not out against England last year, 53 not out today. And that sixth bowler might well have been him.     11.28am   Pakistan reach the final!  20th over, first ball: Pakistan 153-3 (Shan Masood 3, Iftikhar Ahmed 0) Southee to bowl the final over. He starts with a wide! Oh dear. The next ball is at least on target, but Masood has no trouble pushing it for a single. Pakistan have won by seven wickets, with five balls to spare, to reach their first T20 final since 2009. The crowd are roaring, and so are the cornered tigers.      11.24am   Wicket! Haris c Allen b Santner 30 (Pakistan 151-3)  19th over: Pakistan 151-3 (Shan Masood 2) One last over of spin. Santner, bowling to the left-handed Masood, finds some sharp turn \u2013 but it misses everything and dribbles away for three byes! Cruel stuff. With two needed, Haris goes for glory and top-edges to short fine leg, but he has done his job. Pakistan need two off six balls.  Updated at 11.25am GMT    11.20am    18th over: Pakistan 145-2 (Mohammad Haris 28, Shan Masood 1) It\u2019s Lockie Ferguson, and he starts well, but then Mohammad Haris simply takes over. He\u2019s 21, playing in his fourth T20 international, and he\u2019s got sang-froid to die for. Staying deep in the crease, he hammers an off-drive for four. Then he chooses the perfect moment to hit the first six of the innings, hooking hard, high and handsome. Pakistan need only eight now off 12 balls: not even they can blow it from here.     11.15am   Wicket! Rizwan c Phillips b Boult 57 (Pakistan 132-2)  17th over: Pakistan 132-2 (Mohammad Haris 17) A fine, fighting over from Trent Boult brings a wicket, after some confusion. Rizwan slapped a high full-toss to Phillips, who caught it easily, realised it might be a no-ball, threw to the non-striker\u2019s end and got a run-out just to be sure. But it wasn\u2019t reckoned to be above waist height, rightly, because Rizwan had gone down the track. End of an excellent innings, but now New Zealand have a faint sniff. Pakistan need 21 off the last 18 balls.  Updated at 11.17am GMT    11.09am    16th over: Pakistan 127-1 (Rizwan 55, Mohammad Haris 15) And now Santner drops a catch! Williamson belatedly posted a catcher, at gully, for Southee. Haris went for the cut and Santner couldn\u2019t hold on. It was a tough chance, and it was probably New Zealand\u2019s last chance. Pakistan need 26 off 24.  Updated at 11.10am GMT    11.05am    15th over: Pakistan 122-1 (Rizwan 54, Mohammad Haris 11) Santner and Sodhi have been so incisive in this World Cup, but the force is not with them tonight. Every ball in this over goes for something, Rizwan plays a sweep for three and the spin twins have 0-49 between them off seven overs. Pakistan need only 31 off the last 30 balls.  Updated at 11.05am GMT    11.02am   Fifty to Rizwan!  14th over: Pakistan 113-1 (Rizwan 50, Mohammad Haris 6) Bodhi bowls his final over and Rizwan helps himself to a single to reach a well-judged fifty off 36 balls. He tucked into Tim Southee early on, then let Babar take over at the buffet. The scoreboard flashes up the attendance: 36,443 (more than you ever get at a game in England, where the grounds are smaller). And about 25,000 of them are having a ball because they\u2019re wearing green, like the pavilion roof.     10.57am    13th over: Pakistan 109-1 (Rizwan 48, Mohammad Haris 4) Interesting decision here, probably made by Matthew Hayden in Babar\u2019s absence: the new batter is Mohammad Haris, a fast starter, rather than an accumulator like Shan Masood. Haydos is a middle-aged man in a hurry. Haris duly whacks his second ball for four, marring a fine over from Trent Boult, who was brought back to take a wicket and did so.     10.54am   Wicket! Babar c Mitchell b Boult 53 (Pakistan 105-1)  At last! Babar succumbs to the adrenaline and plays a big hit when he didn\u2019t need to, making it easy for Mitchell at long-on. But he has done a fine job here, and it will be enough unless Pakistan produce one of the all-time great chokes.     10.50am   Hundred partnership!  12th over: Pakistan 102-0 (Rizwan 46, Babar 52) Pakistan can just about get \u2019em in singles now and one from Rizwan, pushed down the ground off Sodhi, brings up the hundred partnership. These two have been immense. Cometh the hour, cometh the pair of them.      10.46am   Fifty to Babar!  11th over: Pakistan 97-0 (Rizwan 43, Babar 50) Back comes Lockie Ferguson as Williamson acknowledges that spin hasn\u2019t worked for once. But he doesn\u2019t post the slip cordon that is surely his only way out of this now. Babar pulls for four, then adds a flick for two to reach fifty from only 36 balls, beating Rizwan to it. Before this game Babar had only 39 in the whole tournament, off 63 balls. And he was dropped first ball tonight.  Updated at 10.47am GMT    10.40am    10th over: Pakistan 87-0 (Rizwan 41, Babar 43) Just when they can\u2019t afford one more bad over, the Kiwis have one. Sodhi floats one ball up outside leg, so Rizwan plays a paddle for four. He drops another short outside off, so Babar threads a cut through the covers. That is Pakistan\u2019s 11th four, one more than New Zealand managed in twice as many overs. At the halfway stage, this has become an awful mismatch. Pakistan need only 66.      10.34am    9th over: Pakistan 75-0 (Rizwan 37, Babar 35) A decent over from Santner too, seven off it. But being decent won\u2019t do for NZ. Pakistan need just 78 now and they have 11 overs \u2013 and ten wickets \u2013 to play with. Game off!     10.32am    8th over: Pakistan 68-0 (Rizwan 32, Babar 33) Ish Sodhi joins his spin twin and bowls the best over for some time, going for just five. But Babar already has his highest score of the tournament, and he can afford to cruise because Rizwan (who has faced six balls fewer) is leading the charge. Kane Williamson is going to have to turn into Steve Waugh and set Test-match fields. Three men round the bat!  Updated at 10.32am GMT    10.28am    7th over: Pakistan 63-0 (Rizwan 30, Babar 30) Only one thing can save New Zealand now: spin. And it very nearly makes the breakthrough as Mitchell Santner appeals for LBW against Babar, Williamson reviews \u2026 and it would be plumb if it wasn\u2019t going over the stumps. In Australia, even a low-and-slow wicket can have a trampoline hidden inside it.     10.23am   Pakistan rule the powerplay  6th over: Pakistan 55-0 (Rizwan 28, Babar 25) Even the false shots are going for four now: Babar top-edges Ferguson, way over the keeper, and off it goes, trickling to the Toblerone. New Zealand hit only ten fours in their whole innings, and Pakistan have nine already. The powerplay ends with the best T20 opening pair (before this tournament) right back in business.      10.19am    5th over: Pakistan 47-0 (Rizwan 27, Babar 19) Southee changes ends and Rizwan decides to target him. He moves over to off stump and plays a crunching on-drive for four, like Viv Richards on speed. He likes it so much, he does it again next ball. Babar joins in the fun by flicking for four more. Fifteen off the over, again. Williamson has used only five bowlers in the whole tournament, so if Pakistan can hit one of them out of the attack, they should win the match.      10.14am    4th over: Pakistan 32-0 (Rizwan 18, Babar 14) Babar is getting into the groove now. Facing Lockie Ferguson, he starts with a classy off-drive, then uses the extra pace to dab through the vacant slips. Slip is a run-saving position! That\u2019s 21 off eight balls, but Ferguson puts the plug in, conceding only two off the last four.     10.09am    3rd over: Pakistan 24-0 (Rizwan 17, Babar 7) Boult, artisan that he is, can be expensive and both batters tuck into this over. Babar plays his best shot for several weeks, a flashing cover force for four. Rizwan, sensing the moment, piles in with a glance for four and a cut for four more. Fifteen off the over!      10.06am    2nd over: Pakistan 9-0 (Rizwan 7, Babar 2) The Kiwis need a strong start from their senior seamers and they get it from Tim Southee, whose first over goes for just two singles. The algorithms are giving Pakistan a 65pc chance of a win, which seems about right, although chasing has been unexpectedly tricky in this tournament.     10.02am    1st over: Pakistan 7-0 (Rizwan 6, Babar 1) It\u2019s Trent Boult to get the Pakistan innings under way, and just like New Zealand\u2019s, it begins with a bang. Mohammad Rizwan cuts the first ball for four. Boult bounces back, inducing a nick from Babar Azam \u2013 but it\u2019s dropped by Devon Conway, who has to change direction behind the stumps. Kane Williamson reacts with nothing more than a sly smile. Babar has been in such bad form that the plan may be to keep him there.   Updated at 10.17am GMT    9.51am         9.49am   NZ finish on 152  20th over: New Zealand 152-4 (Mitchell 53, Neesham 16) Naseem Shah bowls the last over and again, it\u2019s all ones and twos. Only eight off it. Pakistan must now be firm favourites, especially with the pitch (low and slow) making them feel at home. Shaheed Shah Afridi was superb, taking 2-24 off his four overs. Kane Williamson was characteristically cool and calm, possibly too much so. But let\u2019s hear it for Daryl Mitchell, who has now appeared in two T20 World Cup semi-finals and proved impregnable: 72 not out to win last year\u2019s semi against England, and 53 not out to make a game of this one against Pakistan. His temperament is made of teak.   Updated at 10.08am GMT    9.42am   Fifty to Mitchell!  19th over: New Zealand 144-4 (Mitchell 50, Neesham 14) Haris Rauf comes back for his final over. NZ are getting something off every ball, if only a leg-bye, but they\u2019re still not threatening any kind of carnage. Neesham does manage to flick a yorker for four, and Mitchell fends off a high full-toss to scamper two and reach a fine fifty, off only 32 balls. He\u2019s been head-and-shoulders above the batters who come in before him.  Updated at 9.43am GMT    9.36am    18th over: New Zealand 133-4 (Mitchell 46, Neesham 8) As Naseem Shah comes back, Mitchell spots his slower ball and lofts it over extra-cover for four. But, not for the first time this evening, the bowler recovers well and there\u2019s no second boundary in the over.  Updated at 9.43am GMT    9.31am    17th over: New Zealand 123-4 (Mitchell 38, Neesham 6) Here\u2019s Jimmy Neesham, a man who did not deserve to be on the losing side in the 2019 World Cup final. Can he reach another one? He takes one ball to play himself in, then works Shaheen\u2019s yorkers around for two, two, two. NZ need another 20 from him, and the same from Mitchell. The goods news is that, for the first time tonight, they have hitters at both ends.  Updated at 9.43am GMT    9.27am   Wicket! Williamson b Shaheen Shah Afridi 46 (NZ 117-4)  The breakthrough! One big gun removes another as Williamson walks across to the off side and Shaheen\u2019s slower ball thuds into leg stump.      9.24am    16th over: New Zealand 116-3 (Williamson 46, Mitchell 38) Pakistan\u2019s fielding, so often a talking point, has been sharp tonight \u2013 but now it\u2019s wobbling. They miss a run-out when it would have been much easier to pull it off, and then Babar himself is slow to run back from mid-off, so he fails to catch Mitchell off Haris Rauf. He may well regret that.  Updated at 9.28am GMT    9.20am    15th over: New Zealand 106-3 (Williamson 43, Mitchell 31) Back comes Shaheen Shah Afridi, the leader of the pack, looking for reverse swing. He starts with two dots to Williamson, who retorts with a whipped four to long leg. That\u2019s his first four! Incredible but true. The PA plays a burst of Crowded House, always take the weather with you. If Neil Finn played cricket, he\u2019d play like Kane Williamson.     9.14am    14th over: New Zealand 99-3 (Williamson 37, Mitchell 30) Shadab returns, the batters take four singles, one of the commentators says \u201cYou can feel something\u2019s about to happen,\u201d and it does \u2013 Mitchell brings out the shimmy again and straight-drives for six. That brings up the fifty partnership, 51 off 35 balls. But even with those two sixes, the last two overs have only gone for nine apiece, and it feels as if Pakistan are still in the driving seat.     9.11am    13th over: New Zealand 90-3 (Williamson 36, Mitchell 22) After being there for 11 and a half overs, Kane Williamson hadn\u2019t managed a single boundary (28 runs off 28 balls). He has now: Mohammad Wasim returns and his first delivery is swatted for six. Is it a pull? Is it a whip? It\u2019s definitely a great shot, though it does make you wonder why Williamson waited so long before attempting anything like it.      9.05am    12th over: New Zealand 81-3 (Williamson 28, Mitchell 21) Babar, given something to think about at last, goes back to pace and brings on Naseem Shah. NZ go back to getting \u2019em in ones and twos. The cameras give us some views of the SCG, those bright-green roofs glinting below a grey-blue sky. Of all the cricket grounds in all the world, this is the one where I would choose to watch my last game.     8.59am    11th over: New Zealand 73-3 (Williamson 24, Mitchell 18) Mitchell is dancing round his crease, itching to go big. He cuts Shadab, uppishly, and somehow squeezes the ball between the two men at backward point. A much-needed four. And then another, as Mitchell waits till the last second before dashing down the track and playing a lofted straight drive. That\u2019s 14 off the over. Reports of NZ\u2019s demise may have been exaggerated.  Updated at 8.59am GMT    8.53am    10th over: New Zealand 59-3 (Williamson 23, Mitchell 5) Williamson is working it around, classy as ever, but he\u2019s not worrying Pakistan. Nawaz\u2019s second over is all singles until Daryl Mitchell goes down the track and manufactures a two. At the halfway stage, NZ are heading for 150 rather than 200, and Pakistan are heading for the final.     8.49am    9th over: New Zealand 52-3 (Williamson 20, Mitchell 1) Plus, Pakistan keep taking wickets off the last ball of the over, which means they can whizz through the next one while the new batter plays himself in. This over from Shadab goes for just three singles, and NZ are in a spin: three overs of the slow stuff, 14 runs, one wicket.     8.46am    8th over: New Zealand 49-3 (Williamson 18) So it\u2019s spin at both ends, as so often in Sydney, and both spinners have already taken a wicket. Pakistan on top.     8.45am   Wicket!! Phillips c&amp;b Nawaz 6 (NZ 49-3)  The big one! Phillips tries to whip Nawaz\u2019s slow left-arm to leg, but gets a thick leading edge and gives the bowler a Christmas gift of a catch.  Updated at 8.55am GMT    8.41am    7th over: New Zealand 44-2 (Williamson 14, Phillips 5) No sooner has Shadab pulled off that run-out than he has to come on to bowl his leg-breaks. No rest for the gifted. He keeps it tight apart from a googly that\u2019s too short, allowing Phillips to late-cut for four.     8.38am    6th over: New Zealand 38-2 (Williamson 13) So the powerplay ends with Pakistan ahead on points, but NZ avoiding the third wicket that so often spells doom. Shaun Pollock feels that the ball is keeping low, and a graphic backs him up \u2013 the average bounce has been about one ball diameter lower than in the other five games at the SCG, which may mean that 180 is a good score.  Updated at 8.42am GMT    8.36am   Wicket! Conway run out (Shadab) 21 (NZ 38-2)  Conway, seeing the need to go big, charges Rauf\u2019s first ball and chips it for four, inside-out. Shot! But soon there\u2019s a direct hit and the Pakistan players begin to celebrate \u2026 They\u2019re right! The dangerous Conway dismissed by the dead-eye Shadab, proving Mel Jones\u2019s point.  Updated at 8.36am GMT    8.30am    5th over: New Zealand 30-1 (Conway 14, Williamson 12) Another change as Afridi gives way to Mohammad Wasim. Some of the sense of theatre goes with Afridi, but Pakistan will still be happy enough. Five singles and a two: it\u2019s as if the middle overs have started already.     8.26am    4th over: New Zealand 23-1 (Conway 11, Williamson 8) The first bowling change from Babar Azam as Haris Rauf replaces Naseem Shah. Rauf has Conway\u2019s number \u2013 he\u2019s dismissed him four times for only 29 runs. Williamson, perhaps aware of this, takes more of the strike, which makes for a quiet over. The highlight is a straight push, more of a caress, for two \u2013 would have been four but for a good half-stop at mid-on. Mel Jones, on the boundary, says she feels the game could be decided by the fielding. She\u2019s such a good commentator, confident and engaging.       8.19am    3rd over: New Zealand 19-1 (Conway 10, Williamson 5) Afridi to Williamson: feels like a big moment. Williamson, usually so serene, plays a loose uppish drive, but it\u2019s into the gap at extra cover and he picks up three. A couple of dots, then a couple of singles. Pakistan have bowled so well, yet it\u2019s still been a run a ball. NZ need to get through the next three overs with only one more wicket, to set the stage for Glenn Phillips.     8.15am    2nd over: New Zealand 14-1 (Conway 9, Williamson 1) At the other end, Naseem Shah starts strongly \u2013 line and length, dot dot dot. Conway whips one away for four, then comes very close to playing on as his back-foot dab flirts with the stumps. Then another four! It\u2019s all happening. \u201cNo idea how the match will go,\u201d says Alistair Connor, \u201cbut I\u2019m backing our twirlers (I\u2019m from NZ).\u201d They\u2019ve been so impressive. \u201cMy daughter went to work in /emigrated to (time will tell) Melbourne a couple of weeks ago. She is French but has lived in Scotland for the last six years. I suggested she should follow the creekit, as a factor of integration. She asked me for bullet points / conversation starters.\u201d Brave woman. \u201cMy suggestion to her was, if she is presenting herself as a New Zealander, she\u2019d best avoid the subject completely. If she\u2019s being French, she can just let them explain it all to her. But her boyfriend\u2019s mum is from County Down, so I suggested they should be Ireland fans.\u201d Choices, choices. I\u2019m hoping she lets them explain it all to her, then hits them with a killer stat.     8.09am    1st over: New Zealand 6-1 (Conway 1, Williamson 1) So this over went four, wicket overturned, wicket \u2026 what we need now is a single or two. Kane Williamson and Devon Conway provide them, and then, finally, there is a plain old dot. What a start: instant drama.      8.05am   Wicket! Allen LBW b Shaheen Shah Afridi 4 (NZ 4-1)  The first ball of the match is straight-driven for four by Finn Allen! But Afridi bites back with the second, a classic inswinger, and Marais Erasmus raises the finger. Reviewed and reprieved! There was an inside edge. Next ball, same again! No inside edge\u2026 It\u2019s plumb!  Updated at 8.08am GMT    8.01am    \u201cKia ora Tim,\u201d says Graeme Simpson, \u201cfrom a very nervous Aotearoa/New Zealand. Was on Eden Park with the lads after the 1992 semi as part of directing a doco on Marty Crowe.\u201d Wow. \u201cHis brother, Jeff, was the interviewer, hence, Crowe on Crowe. (Including a question about the rumours about Martin\u2019s personal life.) Some hard men in tears that afternoon. However, Martin held his composure, waved to the crowd, freeze frame, fade to black with Dire Straits\u2019 Brothers in Arms and credits. We\u2019d only started in Christchurch earlier in the week where NZ badly lost their last pool game to the Pakistanis. TVNZ had scheduled the doco for the following Tuesday, so, no sleep for the next 48 hours\u2026 RiP Marty.\u201d Absolutely. A shame he didn\u2019t live to see NZ make a habit of reaching finals.     7.58am    Time for the anthems, and some body language. The Pakistan team sing theirs with belief, hand on heart. In the crowd, the cameras find hijabs and green wigs and broad smiles. The Kiwis sing theirs with belief too, stern-faced, arm in arm. The cameras don\u2019t spot so many of their supporters.     7.53am   Pitch: not looking its best  The pitch looks not so much worn as knackered. Shaun Pollock, out there as a pundit, says: \u201cIt\u2019s jigsaw-puzzley, if you want to put it that way.\u201d Polly, it\u2019s you who wants to put it that way. And I\u2019m struggling to see what you mean. Possibly this: the pitch is in pieces, and the players will have to put it together themselves.      7.39am   Teams: both unchanged  Ch-ch-ch-changes? No thanks. NZ 1 Finn Allen, 2 Devon Conway (wkt), 3 Kane Williamson (capt), 4 Glenn Phillips, 5 Daryl Mitchell, 6 Jimmy Neesham, 7 Mitchell Santner, 8 Tim Southee, 9 Ish Sodhi, 10 Lockie Ferguson, 11 Trent Boult.

Updated at 7.45am GMT    7.36am   NZ win toss and bat  Captains used to chase, but this tournament has changed all that. Babar Azam calls heads, it\u2019s tails, and Kane Williamson has no hesitation in saying '\u201cwe\u2019ll have a bat\u201d. There have been six games at the SCG, and five have been won by runs not wickets, including both of New Zealand\u2019s wins here.      7.00am   Preamble  Hello everyone and welcome to the first semi-final of the 2022 T20 World Cup. In five hours\u2019 time, either New Zealand or Pakistan will have booked their place in the final. On form in this tournament, it should be New Zealand \u2013 but on past form in knock-outs between these sides, they don\u2019t stand a chance. NZ will lose because \u2026 (a) they\u2019ve had three meetings with Pakistan in situations like this and lost the lot. (b) NZ, historically, are simply not as good at T20 as Pakistan, who lead them by 17 wins to 11, some way from the parity you might expect. (c) After their sorry start and sudden revival, it feels as if Pakistan are getting out their favourite moves again, the dance of the cornered tigers, 30 years on from the original. Pakistan will lose because \u2026 (a) those three previous knock-out games against NZ are distant history, the most recent being 15 years ago, which, in T20 terms, is basically Victorian times. (b) Babar Azam, usually so serene, has been having a nightmare, making scores of 0, 4, 4, 6 and 25, and not even making them fast \u2013 those 39 runs have come off 63 balls, making you wonder if he is now a Sunil Gavaskar tribute act. (c) The match is in Sydney, where the ball turns, and NZ have two of the top seven spinners in the tournament in Mitchell Santner and Ish Sodhi \u2013 two of the top five if you go by performances at the SCG, where NZ have played twice and won twice, marmalising Australia and Sri Lanka. In other words, as usual, there\u2019s no way of telling who will win. Let\u2019s just sit back and enjoy the duel between two entertaining teams, with Shaheen Shah Afridi\u2019s pace and chutzpah coming up against Glenn Phillips\u2019s penchant for sixes. The forecast, by Australia\u2019s rather soggy recent standards, is encouraging. Play starts at 7pm Sydney time, 8am in the UK, and I\u2019ll be back 25 minutes before that with the toss and the teams.  Updated at 7.39am GMT    7.00am    Tim will be here shortly. While you wait, here\u2019s Simon Burnton on Pakistan\u2019s wild ride to the semi-finals.   The first semi-final of the T20 World Cup throws together two teams whose experience of the competition so far could not have been more different. Where New Zealand\u2019s thumping victory over Australia in their opening game put them instantly in control of their group, Pakistan\u2019s presence in the final four, having lost their first two games to India and Zimbabwe, feels like a minor miracle. For the batter Shan Masood even playing in those games was extraordinary, given that during a net session before the first he was hit full on in the head by a vicious shot from Mohammad Nawaz. \u201cI took my helmet off, and I was walking across the nets to get some water, and then I heard someone saying, \u2018Watch out!\u2019 And before I could do anything I felt something hit my ear,\u201d he says. \u201cI went down, and my first thoughts were, it\u2019s hit me really hard. I thought at least it would be a fracture or something. I was taken to hospital, but when the scan came out it was just bruising. \u201cNext day I was not allowed to partake in practice, but I passed every single concussion test, I was good to go. I did not have any practice before the game but I tried to reframe it. I said, \u2018look, anything could have happened. I could have been in hospital. I could have been back home. But I\u2019m actually here and I\u2019m playing, so savour the occasion, make the most of it.\u2019\u201d   "

But she held her nerve. \u201cIn the end,\u201d she said as she relayed man-of-the-match Andrej Kramaric\u2019s words, \u201cCroatia demonstrated who eff\u2019d whom.\u201d Sunday night at the Khalifa Stadium was a cruel, chastening one for Canada. The ignominy didn\u2019t end at the final whistle. Kramaric, whose two goals came in an emphatic 4-1 Canadian defeat, was joined by his manager Zlatko Dalic at the post-match top table where the final words, no matter which language you translate them into, were all Croatian. The defeat meant Canada were the second team eliminated from Qatar 2022 but, technically, the first sent home, seeing as the pitiful hosts already are home. From the most moral victory in defeat to Belgium and then those fateful fighting words on Wednesday to it all being over by Sunday, it was a hell of comedown. What part did Herdman\u2019s \u201cEff Croatia\u201d comments play in it all? Enough. Enough of a part for them to account for at least 20%, maybe 25%, of the combined questions from the floor after the Croatia game. But zoom out and look at the four days as a whole and there is, if not a pattern, then a patch. A sticky patch of naivety off and then on the field that brought Canada\u2019s return to the men\u2019s World Cup to such a screeching halt. As largely harmless as they were, Herdman\u2019s words did not help Canada. Why? Because they clearly helped Croatia. And the 2018 World Cup finalists, already operating on a higher plane than Concacaf\u2019s top qualifiers, definitely didn\u2019t need a leg up. Of all the teams to provide some bulletin-board motivation to, a gnarled veteran Croatian core coming off a dispiriting opening stalemate with Morocco is not one of them. Even to observe Kramaric and Dalic without the help of a translator told you as much. It was written on their faces.  Herdman said he didn\u2019t regret his words and then intimated that he did. He was processing it all in real time and, as Wednesday had taught him, that can be risky. \u201cNo, not at all,\u201d he replied when asked if he wished he hadn\u2019t used the f-word. \u201cAs I keep saying, we\u2019re here to push as far as we can. We\u2019re here to change the mentality of the group. I could have been a bit more composed coming out of the huddle. That\u2019s my learning. I\u2019ll take that on the chin.\u201d If the comments and the ensuing Croatian tabloid mockery had helped turn an already chaotic Group F into Group Eff, it was Herdman\u2019s job to get it all back on an even keel. That was something Canada never had Sunday at Khalifa Stadium. They roared out of the gates and Alphonso Davies created personal and national history with the fastest goal of this World Cup and the Canadian men\u2019s first in any edition. For the next 20 minutes they searched for a second. But they never settled. So Croatia did. And naivety cost Herdman, and Canada, a second time.  Captain Atiba Hutchison is beloved, an older brother to the other 25 players here. He was winning his 100th cap a couple of months before his 40th birthday. But as Luka Modric, Mateo Kovacic and Marcelo Brozovic got a grip and then ran rampant through the middle, Hutchinson was bypassed and bullied. Porto\u2019s Stephen Eustaquio was hobbled by injury but inexplicably both were left in to flail and inevitably Croatia turned it all around. Hutchinson was partially or prominently at fault for three Croatian goals yet Herdman argued that his captain was \u201cnext level\u201d before admitting soon after that he could have made changes sooner. \u201cI think there are small margins,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me it\u2019s trying to get those tactical shifts in earlier. In that first half there was a moment where Modric and Brozovic had started to pick apart our midfield two and we needed a tactical shift a little bit quicker and maybe needed the subs a bit quicker. It might have made the difference. I\u2019ve got to reflect. I\u2019m a bit raw at the moment.\u201d When he did belatedly make the changes, Herdman brought in rising star Isma\u00ebl Kon\u00e9 and veteran Jonathan Osorio. A decade separates the two players but what ties them is that neither has ever played outside MLS. And here they were being sent into the white heat of a decisive World Cup game to tame a Croatian midfield built from Real Madrid, Chelsea and Internazionale. It\u2019s the kind of moment to pause and realise how far Canada have come \u2013 and how far they still have to go. In that wider context, Herdman was of course right to say he was \u201cproud of what they achieved \u2026 we came here to make history.\u201d Davies\u2019 storming header was historic, an instant Canadian heritage moment. But zoom in again and it counted for little. The team weren\u2019t tipped by many to make it out of a group that was expected \u2013 and has proven to be \u2013 one of the least predictable and most competitive here. But for it to all be over before the final group game stings. Herdman will regroup for Morocco on Thursday and hope his side can have a say in how the group shakes out. But not too loud of a say. That lesson has been learned."

                    "body": "Whether Gareth Southgate intended to call up James Justin to his England World Cup squad on Thursday may for ever be a mystery after the Leicester defender was carried off on a stretcher during the second half of a routine Carabao Cup victory over Newport County. Southgate is already fretting over his full-back options with Ben Chilwell ruled out and Reece James and Kyle Walker major doubts. Justin, who is thought to have been on Southgate\u2019s provisional 55-man long-list for Qatar, was forced off after an innocuous collision with Newport\u2019s Liverpool loanee Adam Lewis soon after the hour and will undergo a scan on Wednesday to determine the extent of his injury. He made his playing comeback in January after missing almost a year of action with an anterior cruciate ligament injury. It was a cruel way for Justin\u2019s night to finish given the 24-year-old had set Leicester on the path to victory with a stunning left-foot shot that cracked in off a post before Jamie Vardy scored two second-half goals as Brendan Rodgers\u2019s side eased into the last 16 of the competition. Perhaps Justin took inspiration from Kevin De Bruyne, whose recent match-winning free-kick here for Manchester City also pinged in off the upright.  \u201cHe felt something so we will have to see how it goes,\u201d said Leicester\u2019s assistant manager, Chris Davies. Three and a half years ago Leicester learned the hard way about Newport\u2019s appetite for a cup upset and the Leicester chairman, Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha, alluded to that shock FA Cup third-round exit at Rodney Parade under Claude Puel in his programme notes, citing how those still in the squad would be well-versed on the standards required to advance here. Jonny Evans was the only survivor from the starting lineup that day, with Rodgers making seven changes from the team that earned a third win in four league matches at Everton on Saturday. James Maddison, another hoping for an England call, was among those rested altogether, while Youri Tielemans began on the bench. Newport are 18th in the fourth tier but arrived for their first visit to Filbert Way on a five-match unbeaten run that began when Graham Coughlan took charge last month. The early signs under the former Bristol Rovers and Mansfield manager are encouraging but this was always unlikely to be an evening where they could express themselves and Leicester assumed control from the off. \u201cThe mindset for this game was no different to a Premier League game, because complacency can be the biggest threat,\u201d Davies said. \u201cWe see surprises and shocks all the time in the cups.\u201d  In swirling wind and rain, Leicester\u2019s enthusiasm would not be dampened by stubborn opponents. Dennis Praet skewed wide after Vardy chested the ball into his path and seconds later Wilfred Ndidi looked to the skies after pulling a shot past Nick Townsend\u2019s right post. The visiting goalkeeper then made a smart save to deny Harvey Barnes from a tight angle. But just as Newport could scent half-time, Justin played a give-and-go with Praet and drove inside from the right flank before curling a brilliant left-foot shot in off the upright. Cue the goal music to turn up the volume on a flat evening. Barnes tested Townsend with a swerving right-foot shot midway through the second half and Vardy doubled Leicester\u2019s lead soon after with a superb glancing header from the substitute Marc Albrighton\u2019s cross. Townsend will perhaps feel he should have done more than get fingertips to the ball. Vardy completed the scoring after rounding Townsend and fooling centre-back Priestley Farquharson, who ended up skidding on to the turf before the striker slammed home. Vardy stuck his tongue out in celebration but a good night\u2019s work was soured by Justin\u2019s injury."

                    "body": "If this is boring football then give Louis van Gaal more of it. The Netherlands\u2019 head coach has bridled at claims he has brought a tedious team to the World Cup but they had the class, nous and killer instinct that the United States lacked to become the first country into the quarter-finals.\nA player named after the actor Denzel Washington \u2013 the Internazionale defender Denzel Dumfries \u2013 was the architect of the USA\u2019s demise with two assists and a fine third goal that extinguished any chance of a comeback by Gregg Berhalter\u2019s young side. The USA rallied strongly after finding themselves two goals down at half-time and the cheekiest of flicks from Haji Wright brought hope.\n\nBut the Netherlands, resolute and clinical, were unmoved. It is now 19 matches without losing since Van Gaal returned to the job for a third time last year, with 11 World Cup games unbeaten under the charismatic manager, and his team are settling into their stride in Qatar. \u201cOur ball retention needs to improve but we scored beautiful goals today and that gives us confidence,\u201d he said.\nThe Netherlands have five days\u2019 rest before facing Argentina on Friday, while the co-hosts of the 2026 World Cup have four years to digest the painful lessons of this last-16 defeat.\nBerhalter\u2019s team dominated possession in the first half but it was an exaggeration by the coach to suggest that they were \u201con top\u201d. The USA rarely threatened their opponents before the interval and were exposed whenever the Netherlands broke from their tight, defensive shape. Van Gaal was unhappy with the Netherlands\u2019 sloppiness in possession in the first half\u2013 \u201cunacceptable at a World Cup,\u201d he called it \u2013 although he rightly purred over their \u201cflawless transitions\u201d.\nThe breakthrough was beautifully worked and prised the USA apart in seven pristine passes. Memphis Depay was involved at the outset in his own half and at the conclusion in the opposite penalty area. Having carved open the USA midfield with a series of one-touch passes Cody Gakpo surged forward and released Dumfries on the right. The wing-back pulled an intelligent cross towards the penalty spot where the unmarked Depay converted into the bottom corner. They had lured the USA into a trap and punished them in flowing, polished style.\nThe complexion of this first knockout tie could have been so different had Christian Pulisic converted a one-on-one after three minutes. Pulisic, cleared to play after suffering a pelvic injury when scoring the crucial winner against Iran on Tuesday, found himself free inside the area from a Tyler Adams flick. The forward was denied by the outstretched leg of the goalkeeper Andries Noppert.\nThe USA were too safe in possession in the first half, short of ideas on how to recover from falling behind for first time at the tournament. On the few occasions they did find gaps in the Dutch defence, prospects of an equaliser were undermined by a poor final touch.\n\nThe Netherlands\u2019 second goal was almost a carbon copy of the first. Dumfries escaped down the right once again, latching on to a deft touch from Davy Klaassen, and played an identical cross to the opener. This time Daley Blind arrived in space to tuck away a neat finish into the same corner Depay found. Blind, who had skied a similar invitation from Dumfries earlier in the half, sprinted over to the Netherlands\u2019 technical area to celebrate with his father, Danny, who is also Van Gaal\u2019s assistant.\nThe USA did not let the deficit or the timing of the second goal deflate them. A much-improved second-half display almost brought an immediate response when Pulisic\u2019s corner dropped to Tim Ream, whose awkward touch took the ball beyond Noppert. Gakpo was perfectly placed to clear off the line.\nWright injected some desperately needed menace into the USA attack. The substitute was also denied on the goalline after pouncing on a careless back-pass from Depay and rounding the Netherlands\u2019 keeper. Dumfries came to his team\u2019s rescue on that occasion.\n\nBut a minute later Wright had his goal and the USA had a route back. Depay was again culpable with a showboating touch that DeAndre Yedlin turned on to Pulisic. He crossed low and Wright, falling in front of Virgil van Dijk, somehow managed to flick the ball up and over Noppert with his heel.\nDumfries was unable to intervene at the back post, although the hugely influential defender would have one more part to play in the USA\u2019s downfall. Their chances of a recovery were over within five minutes. The left wing-back Blind delivered an inch-perfect cross to the back post for the unmarked right wing-back to steer an unstoppable left-footed volley into the far corner. \u201cYesterday I gave him a big fat kiss,\u201d said Van Gaal as he sat next to Dumfries at the post-match press conference. \u201cToday I will give him another one.\u201d He then planted one on the defender\u2019s cheek.\n\u201cThe aim of the match was to win and I\u2019m happy I was able to help the team,\u201d said Dumfries.\n\u201cI was pleased for Daley [Blind] too. If I\u2019m honest we\u2019ve had some criticism recently. And I think it\u2019s a good boost for both of us that we were important tonight for the group.\u201d"

When I moved into presenting football on television, it often felt as if we were endeavouring to do the opposite \u2013 take something as simple as football and make it as complicated as possible. Don\u2019t get me wrong: the analysis of the best ex-footballers in the business, as long as they use the most accessible language, can be fascinating. My favourite to work with was the former Arsenal and England player Lee Dixon. To make sure what he was saying was intelligible, he used to run it past me first. He called me, very few might say unkindly, his idiot filter. But I was very proud to perform this function for him because I was very good at it. Working Lunch was the business programme I co-presented with Adam Shaw, who was as expert on matters financial as Lee was on football. And, like Lee, Adam used me as a bit of an idiot filter, too. Interestingly, Adam used to say of football that he\u2019d like to be more into it but found a lot of the language around it baffling. This made him feel excluded, as if he was a guest at the wrong party.  I think about this a lot, especially at World Cups, when many non-fans may engage with football. I hope they fall in love with this simple, beautiful game, but we don\u2019t make it easy for them. Straining the rivers of football talk through my expert-approved idiot filter, I find a good deal of guff stuck in the mesh. What is a casual viewer to make of a team described as being \u201cgood in the transition\u201d? Or a team needing to, in the words of England\u2019s captain, Harry Kane, \u201cplay better with the ball in the attacking third\u201d? And how about a player described as \u201cmore of an 8 than a 10\u201d? The uninitiated will assume they are being judged, unfavourably, as more of an 8 out of 10 than a 10 out of 10. It doesn\u2019t mean that. As for what it does mean, I\u2019m afraid that this idiot isn\u2019t quite sure. \u2022 Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnist  Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

                    "body": "For Emiliano Mart\u00ednez, this chilly evening in Aston must have felt strangely reminiscent of the World Cup on the Persian Gulf last month. There was the magnificent point-blank save to deny Jack Harrison and Leeds a certain equaliser on the brink of half-time; a replica of the free-kick routine from which Wout Weghorst, the Netherlands striker who has just joined Manchester United, scored to force extra-time in the quarter-final; there were the dark arts, perfected by Villa, that infuriated Jesse Marsch on the touchline. And, ultimately, there was a sweet victory at the end of it all. By contrast, the last few months have represented a pretty miserable existence for Marsch, not that you would know it given the buoyant tone of his 13-minute post-match press conference, in which he insisted this was his side\u2019s most complete performance since he took charge last February. Marsch\u2019s demeanour was a world away from a manager worried about whether he would survive until Wednesday\u2019s FA Cup third-round replay at home to Cardiff but the reality is, dating back to August, Leeds have won two of their past 17 matches in all competitions. They have kept one clean sheet in their past 13 matches and remain 14th, two points above the relegation zone. In a week in which Marsch joined LinkedIn, the networking website, it is hard not to think the American could soon find himself out of work.  Unai Emery is feeling the love at Villa Park after winning 13 points from his first six Premier League games in charge. Marsch, meanwhile, was booed by some Leeds supporters as he went to to thank the away end after the final whistle and some fans made clear their disdain, calling for him to be sacked towards the end of the second half. \u201cI understand the pressures that come with the expectations for a club like Leeds United,\u201d Marsch said afterwards. \u201cI\u2019m more positive than I\u2019ve ever been since I\u2019ve been here. We\u2019re not even halfway through the season. There\u2019s no panic. When the team doesn\u2019t win the coach is always going to take the heat but I handle that.\u201d Equally, Marsch is not naive. \u201cIt\u2019s always about results,\u201d he added. \u201cI know if we play like this we will get results much more often than we have.\u201d Leeds got off to a dreadful start when Leon Bailey curled a shot into the far corner with less than three minutes gone. The galling thing for them was that it was a counterattack goal that stemmed from a Leeds corner. An unmarked Marc Roca swiped at thin air when attempting to convert Harrison\u2019s cross and the again impressive Ashley Young located Boubacar Kamara, who excelled at the base of the Villa midfield. Kamara ploughed upfield into the Leeds half before turning Brendan Aaronson and picking out Bailey, whose crisp left-foot finish sent the home support wild. \u201cI\u2019m so, so happy with Leon because against Wolves he had two really good chances to win the match and he was a bit upset,\u201d Emery, the Villa manager, said. \u201cBut today he scored the goal and did a really good action.\u201d  Emery had to make two first-half changes with Lucas Digne and Ollie Watkins forced off inside half an hour and Leeds should have gone in at least level at the interval. Aaronson played the role of Teun Koopmeiners as Leeds attempted to recreate Weghorst\u2019s strike in Qatar and passed the ball to Rodrigo but, under pressure from Douglas Luiz, the forward could not get a clean shot away. Villa squandered a chance to double their lead when Bailey, played in superbly by Young, overcooked a simple pass that would have presented Watkins with an easy finish. \u00c1lex Moreno had a chance to cap a fine debut with a goal after a give-and-go with the returning Jacob Ramsey and Villa did increase their advantage when Emi Buend\u00eda pounced on the rebound of Bailey\u2019s powerful strike. Illan Meslier got his left hand to Bailey\u2019s drive but, despite getting his right hand to the ball, the Leeds goalkeeper could not prevent Buend\u00eda\u2019s header from looping over him. The goal was initially ruled offside before a VAR check overturned the decision. In the first half Mart\u00ednez saved superbly from Harrison and, moments earlier, Moreno made a brilliant sliding block to deny Rodrigo a certain goal. In the end the substitute Patrick Bamford\u2019s first goal for 404 days, on his first appearance since October following groin surgery, proved nothing more than a consolation. Leeds\u2019s \u00a330m move for the Hoffenheim striker Georginio Rutter suggests they are happy to support Marsch this month but whether the manager\u2019s version of events will wash remains to be seen. \u201cIf we can use this as a moment to really make it click, I believe we have a bright future,\u201d Marsch insisted. He will hope he is afforded the chance to realise it."

                    "body": "In 2011, Peter Christiansen opened his inbox to find he had been sent an aeroplane ticket to Australia. The ticket would not only fly him from Denmark to the other side of the world but also signal a new chapter in his career, forge a new development pathway for Australian football and, eventually, see Socceroos captain Mat Ryan make his Champions League debut.\n\u201cMy eyes were opened during that two-week trip. I went everywhere,\u201d Christiansen tells Guardian Australia before this week\u2019s make-or-break World Cup clash between the Socceroos and Denmark. \u201cCentral Coast, Brisbane, Melbourne; I met Ange [Postecoglou], Peter Cklamovski [Postecoglou\u2019s long-time assistant and now head coach at Montedio Yamagata]. \n\n\u201cSo I met people there; of course, Arnie [Socceroos coach Graham Arnold]) and Clarky [Socceroos fitness coach Andrew Clark], and had the chance to go and watch a lot of training\u2026 trying to understand how people were from that part of the world, and just listening, learning, and it was a really good feeling going back.\u201d\nChristiansen, who won three Danish Superliga titles as a player with FC Copenhagen, has become one of the most influential individuals in Danish football over the past decade, and is simply known as \u201cPC\u201d. Now back at FC Copenhagen as sporting director, Christiansen\u2019s rise has also seen Denmark become a popular destination for Australian footballers.\nWhen Christiansen made his first trip Down Under, just two Australians were playing in the Danish Superliga. Since then, Superliga clubs have completed 19 transfers involving Australians. Christiansen has been central to seven of those deals, while he also added Clark \u2013 the Socceroos\u2019 fitness guru \u2013 to FC Copenhagen\u2019s staff earlier this year.\n\u201cI think the talent [in Australia], in general, is underestimated, with us Europeans looking at it. I think there\u2019s a lot of talent down there,\u201d Christiansen says.\n\nBack in 2011, Christiansen was head scout at Randers FC, which was looking to cement itself in the Superliga. Access to \u201cniche markets\u201d such as Australia, in Christiansen\u2019s words, gave him \u201can edge\u201d over bigger clubs.\nMost significantly, he spent time at Central Coast Mariners in 2011 where Arnold had assembled an impressive array of young talent, including Ryan, Mustafa Amini and Bernie Ibini. While interested, Christiansen was unable to make any immediate signings, but would eventually secure Amini in 2015.\n\u201cSo that basically kicked it off,\u201d says Christiansen, who has signed Australians at all three clubs he has worked at \u2013 Randers, AGF and FC Copenhagen. \u201cI\u2019ve not had a bad [experience] with regards to a player or staff member from Australia.\u201d\nThe wait to sign Ryan would be much longer, but Christiansen finally landed the Socceroos goalkeeper on a two-year deal in August this year. the transfer saw Ryan play in the Champions League group stage for the first time in his career.\n\u201cHe played a massive part in us [FC Copenhagen] qualifying for the Champions League,\u201d Christiansen says. \u201cThe two playoff games we had against Trabzonspor, he was absolutely outstanding, coming up big in a couple of occasions in both games. So he\u2019s definitely been a top performer for us.\u201d\nFor Christiansen, the lure of Australia was access to an undervalued market of young talent, comprising \u201cvery professional players, hard-working, good talent, good mindset, intelligent\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, Australian footballers have benefitted from a new pathway to Europe. Following the Socceroos\u2019 so-called \u201cgolden generation\u201d of Kewell, Viduka et al, few Australians have had opportunities to play in Europe\u2019s top leagues. Denmark has provided a culture strikingly similar to home, clubs where English is the primary working language, and a shop window for bigger leagues.\n\nThe Danish pathway has broadened over the years with other clubs \u2013 in particular, FC Midtjylland \u2013 providing some competition for Christiansen. Last season, Socceroos fullback Joel King joined Odense Boldklub from Sydney FC. Awer Mabil, who has twice come off the bench so far this World Cup, is the poster boy of the Australia-Denmark talent trail. Mabil spent seven years in Midtjylland\u2019s setup, including three stints on loan, winning the Danish Cup and the Superliga, and playing in the Champions League and Europa League. He now plays for Cadiz in La Liga.\n\nAs the Socceroos prepare to face Denmark at Al Janoub Stadium on Wednesday (Thursday morning AEDT), Christiansen is convinced that the performances of Mabil, King and others with a Danish connection at this World Cup will be critical to maintaining current pathways and blazing new trails to Europe.\n\u201cI think the Aussie national team has a big responsibility to do well because it\u2019s also the future of a lot of young players that are at stake,\u201d he says. \u201cIf the Socceroos do well at the World Cup, I think that Australian football will gain more recognition in Europe.\u201d\nRegardless, Christiansen plans to keep monitoring the Australian market, which he otherwise might never have discovered if not for that unexpected aeroplane ticket sent by an insistent football agent by the name of Buddy Farah, who has also represented many of the players Christiansen has signed from Australia.\n\u201cI was always trying to find a reason not to go because of my calendar. I was that busy, so, in the end, he just sent me a ticket,\u201d Christiansen says. \u201cAnd then I thought, \u2018OK, now I\u2019m going\u2019.\u201d"

At Twickenham on Monday he talked simply and well about what he thinks has gone wrong with England and how to fix it. Given how little time he has he said wants to concentrate on trying to coach improvements in two or three key areas. He wasn\u2019t about to lay out what they were, except to say that his priority will be strengthening the set piece and making sure they\u2019re \u201cbrilliant at the basics\u201d of the game. Beyond that, Borthwick spoke with unabashed passion about how much he loves English rugby and how he wants his side to be able to inspire that same pride in everyone else.\nIt was a convincing pitch. He is meticulous but uncomplicated, honest but uncompromising. The only problem is that it hasn\u2019t been tested yet. It\u2019s easy to sound good on the first day in the job, the worrying thing for Borthwick is that he has only 45 more before England play Scotland at Twickenham. That\u2019s not his fault. He was supposed to start after the World Cup and had already spoken to Eddie Jones about how to manage that transition. Then the RFU brought it forward.\nThis Six Nations is going to be a pitiless introduction to Test rugby. After Scotland, England play Italy, then Wales, who will at the very least be harder to beat now they are back under Warren Gatland. After that it\u2019s France, who are on a 13-match winning streak, then Ireland, who are top of the world rankings.\nBorthwick has got six weeks or so and then he\u2019s going up against coaches who are three years in to a four-year plan that is clearly working for them. England lost three matches in this year\u2019s Six Nations and three the year before. There is an assumption they ought to be better than that, but not a whole lot of evidence why that is necessarily the case.\nBorthwick says he is ready for the pressure he will be under if they finish in a similar position in next year\u2019s championship. \u201cIn the last 22 years I\u2019ve been involved in international rugby as a player or an assistant coach for 17 of them,\u201d he said, \u201cso the simple answer to that, is yes.\u201d But he\u2019s not. He can\u2019t be until he\u2019s lived through it.\nNo wonder then that having just explained they had sacked Jones because the results were not as good as they wanted, the RFU chief executive, Bill Sweeney, seemed reluctant to set Borthwick any performance targets. \u201cWe see this as a really exciting new age for England rugby,\u201d Sweeney said when the question was put to him. \u201cWe think this is a new chapter. What we\u2019re not going to do is say first thing, \u2018by the way here\u2019s a target for the 2023 World Cup\u2019. This is a long-term rebuild.\u201d\nNine months out from a World Cup they\u2019ve been telling everyone to wait on for the last four years, the RFU suddenly seem keener to be judged on the one after it.\n\nPushed again as to whether he was confident Borthwick\u2019s England will do better next year than they would have done otherwise, Sweeney stretched as far as saying he thought they would be \u201cvery competitive\u201d in the World Cup. The draw means they ought to be. Make it through the group and England face a quarter-final against either Australia, who Jones had beaten 10 times out of 11, or Wales, who he had beaten eight times in the same number of games. You would have backed him to do it again, especially in a knockout match. After that are the semi-finals and Jones has never lost one of those.\nThe RFU have traded the hope that Borthwick\u2019s England may do well for the expectation that Jones\u2019s would because they were worried his team would not live up to it. Given the way England had been playing lately, perhaps they were right. But it still seems a strange bet to make nine months before the tournament, especially given they were going to bring Borthwick in once it was over. If they aren\u2019t sure it has improved England\u2019s chances of winning the thing, then what have they gained by making the change now except a better excuse for failing to do it?\nBorthwick, at least, had another good answer about all this. \u201cThe competition right now at Tier 1 level is very, very, high,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone wants an England team that wins, but we also want an England team that even when they don\u2019t win still plays in a manner, and fights in a manner, and competes in a manner, where you can get behind them. A team that might not win every game, and might not win every contest, but where we can certainly be proud of what they\u2019re doing. My job is to build that team.\u201d\nAgain, it made him sound like a fine coach. So yes, there is hope. It\u2019s going to be fascinating to see how far that carries them."

And Harry Souttar is probably going to earn Stoke City quite a bit of money during the January transfer window. For now, though, his only focus is reproducing that performance, that last-man tackle. The one that ensured a resurgent Tunisia did not equalise and Australia could claim a first win at a World Cup in 12 years.\nDown went Taha Yassine Khenissi in the 85th minute, and up went the dollar signs \u2013 and social media. Set it to the Titanic soundtrack, they said. Put his face on a coin. Tattoo it on your neck.\n\nShortly after the full-time whistle blew on Saturday\u2019s 1-0 win, Souttar\u2019s Wikipedia page received an unofficial update: \u201cAgainst Tunisia, Souttar caused mass boners across the great southern land with one of the greatest sniping tackles god\u2019s earth has ever seen.\u201d\nBy the time the site administrators had removed it Souttar was already modestly talking down his contributions and talking up those of his teammates. As he spoke, both Scotland and Australia were laying claim to him, the boy born in Luthermuir who plays stopper for the Socceroos. It was BBC Scotland that called him \u201cSuperman\u201d. Australia is trying to cobble together enough bronze for a 1.98m statue.\n\nThree days later he is still being sent footage of that defining moment in a career-defining outing. It was the 24-year-old\u2019s third senior match back after a year out with an anterior cruciate ligament tear. His fourth could come against Denmark on Wednesday night (Thursday 2am AEDT), when Australia play for a place in the round of 16 for the first time since 2006.\nThe first question, of course, is not about that at all, instead one of whether he would like to move up a tier. Premier League clubs were circling before his injury last year, though Stoke\u2019s $35m minimum asking price will undoubtedly have risen based on Souttar\u2019s World Cup campaign. His agent is in Doha and likely fielding phone calls from interested parties, though the player himself insists he has separated himself from any discussions.\n\n\u201cMy focus has got to be the here and now,\u201d Souttar says. \u201cIf you ask every player, they want to play at the highest level they can, but my focus is purely on Denmark. I\u2019ll let other people deal with all that for me, I don\u2019t need to do that. I need to just concentrate on my performances on the pitch.\u201d\nWhat, then, makes Souttar so good? Sasa Ognenovski, a former hard-nosed centre-back with 22 Socceroos caps, says his greatest strength is simplicity.\n\u201cHe\u2019s just a nice, clean, hard, simple defender,\u201d Ognenovski says. \u201cHe does his job defensively \u2013 he doesn\u2019t complicate things, try to dribble out the back. He doesn\u2019t do anything spectacular, but he just defends really well. He knows when to hit a long pass, when to hit a short pass.\n\u201cHe made every tackle, it was physical. You see a lot of centre-halves these days that just want to win the ball cleanly all the time and not go to ground. You just have to put your body on the line. It\u2019s as simple as that, and really effective. And he, in the last game in particular, did it really well.\u201d\n\nConsider also an aerial presence which made mincemeat of some of the Socceroos\u2019 early World Cup qualifying opponents \u2013 he scored six goals from his first five international appearances \u2013 and a composure alongside Kye Rowles in a blossoming central defensive partnership.\n\u201cHe is always taking players away in those set pieces, even if the ball doesn\u2019t get to him,\u201d Ognenovski says. \u201cI think they feel a bit more complete in the back line with him as well. He\u2019s a big asset.\u201d\n\n\u201cBig\u201d is the operative word here. Souttar is one of the tallest players in Qatar and towers over fellow Scotland-born players Martin Boyle and Jason Cummings \u2013 even if some of his food choices are questionable. The Socceroos stayed on brand last week, filming a \u201cScot-eroos\u201d YouTube video of the trio, during which Souttar reveals his choice of sandwich. \u201cChicken breast and ham on Italian bread,\u201d he starts, \u201cwith a bit of onion, cheese and onion crisps sprinkled on top, tomato sauce, three cookies and a Pepsi Max.\u201d\nThe other pair were about as astonished as some Scotland supporters have been that Souttar was not snapped up by Scotland like his older brother and fellow defender John, who plays for Rangers. \u201cIn terms of the Australia thing, listen, I got the phone call,\u201d Souttar says. \u201cIt was a very simple decision from my point of view, and it\u2019s probably the best decision I\u2019ve ever made.\u201d"

                    "body": "Christian Pulisic was taken to hospital with a pelvic injury sustained while scoring the winner in USA\u2019s tense 1-0 victory over Iran, raising concerns about his availability for Saturday\u2019s last-16 tie against the Netherlands. The forward underwent scans after being substituted at half-time on Tuesday night, having initially attempted to shrug off his collision with the Iran goalkeeper Alireza Beiranvand. He took the knock as he bravely converted Sergi\u00f1o Dest\u2019s header in the 38th minute but was clearly in discomfort.  Pulisic was examined in hospital in what was described as a precaution. A later statement from the US men\u2019s national team on Twitter said: \u201cChristian Pulisic has been diagnosed with a pelvic contusion and his status is day-to-day.\u201d  \u201cHe was feeling some dizziness, it was a blow to his abdomen,\u201d Gregg Berhalter said. \u201cWe FaceTimed him from the hospital and he was in good spirits.\u201d Weston McKennie said Pulisic had sent him a text reading: \u201cBest believe I\u2019ll be ready on Saturday.\u201d A fit Pulisic would be valuable against a Netherlands team that topped Group A. \u201cIt\u2019s a great opportunity but we are not going in thinking it\u2019s an honour,\u201d Berhalter said of the task ahead. \u201cWe want to go on, we deserve to be in the position we are in, we have to come up with an idea of how to beat a very good Dutch team.\u201d  That has been achieved by a USA side once before, winning a friendly in Amsterdam 4-3 seven years ago, although the Netherlands prevailed in their previous four meetings. History will have little impact this weekend, though, and Berhalter emphasised that all bets are off when the knockouts come around. \u201cFrom here anything can happen,\u201d he said. \u201cAll we need to do is play one game at a time, there\u2019s no need to project how far this team can go.\u201d Berhalter paid tribute to the way his players dealt with considerable noise around the Iran fixture, drawing comparisons with the 2-1 defeat when the countries met at France \u201898. \u201cI talked about 1998 and the guys not having the appropriate intensity to compete against Iran,\u201d he said. \u201cToday we had it, battling. You saw that from the opening minute. \u201cYou see how resilient this group is, you see the energy. The American spirit is summed up in this group.\u201d"

                    "body": "Graham Potter may have benefited from a recent \u201cGlow Up\u201d but his players seem to be experiencing a bit of a messy makeover. Given Chelsea have failed to win any of their last five Premier League games, it has proved somewhat less successful than their manager\u2019s new hair style, as, thanks to Joe Willock\u2019s sumptuously curling winner, Eddie Howe\u2019s renascent Newcastle registered a sixth straight victory. \u201cI rate Joe very, very highly,\u201d said \u201can immensely proud\u201d Howe at the end of an evening in which the midfielder thoroughly upstaged England\u2019s Mason Mount and Conor Gallagher. \u201cJoe\u2019s continuing to improve but he\u2019s very important to us.\u201d  Willock and co go into the World Cup break third in the top tier with the domestic season\u2019s impending six-week hiatus apparently the only thing that can apply a brake to the extraordinary momentum which promises to sweep them into next season\u2019s Champions League. Chelsea\u2019s growing fear of missing out on Europe was reflected by their body language at the final whistle when Kai Havertz briefly found himself at the centre of a finger-pointing melee. Although it began with Havertz squaring up to Newcastle\u2019s Dan Burn the conclusion seemed to be more about his Chelsea teammates losing their cool and arguing with each other. Tellingly such recriminations continued as they headed down the tunnel and Howe\u2019s players began a mini lap of honour. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t get any easier, we\u2019re in a bad place; we need to go away and regroup,\u201d said Potter whose side suffered a third straight defeat for the first time since Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s troubled tenure in 2015 and now sit eighth, eight points behind fourth-placed Tottenham. \u201cIt\u2019s not nice to get bad results. But sometimes you have to accept your struggles. There\u2019s been a lot of learning in the last eight weeks. The first half was relatively even but Newcastle are a very good side. Defensively they\u2019re one of the best teams in the Premier League; they don\u2019t make it easy for you. But we made too many unforced errors.\u201d He blamed tiredness. \u201cYou could see the difference in the schedules; we looked fatigued but our schedule\u2019s demanding,\u201d Potter continued. \u201cNewcastle have one game a week. It showed. We\u2019re just hoping the guys going to the World Cup come back in a good place and we can re-focus.\u201d  Chelsea had flown north without Raheem Sterling. The forward has been suffering from migraines but is still expected to join up with Gareth Southgate\u2019s Qatar-bound World Cup squad. Newcastle\u2019s key striker, Callum Wilson, is also Doha bound but he spent most of the evening on the bench after recovering from a virus and watched Chelsea almost imperceptibly lose control of a first half in which they barely created a single chance and Willock won his central midfield duel with England\u2019s Gallagher. Unlike certain other colleagues the latter was at least industry personified. It was not Gallagher\u2019s fault he struggled at right wing-back in the second period after being relocated to an unfamiliar role following Potter\u2019s attempt to recalibrate his formation. Gallagher created Chelsea\u2019s sole real moment of menace when he cut inside and stretched Nick Pope to the limit with a curling shot the England goalkeeper proved brilliantly equal to. Howe identified it as a key turning point, stressing that Pope has contributed a great deal to Newcastle\u2019s four clean sheets in the past six League games. With Bruno Guimar\u00e3es\u2019s style slightly cramped by Potter\u2019s decision to man mark Howe\u2019s Brazil midfielder, Newcastle\u2019s high possession quotient did not translate into multiple chances. Even so, \u00c9douard Mendy denied Chris Wood at point-blank range after Joelinton flicked on Kieran Trippier\u2019s cross, while Miguel Almir\u00f3n conjured an excellent chance Sean Longstaff could only lift over the bar. Undeterred, Almir\u00f3n controlled a bouncing ball before dribbling across the area and, just when he seemed set to shoot, overran it and laid it off to Willock instead. As the midfielder sent a first-time shot curving beyond Mendy, any remaining radiance drained from Potter\u2019s face."

                    "body": "The Americans, Gareth Southgate warned in the wake of England\u2019s 6-2 dissection of Iran, will be \u201ccoming for us full throttle\u201d. What does Top Gear USMNT: World Cup Edition look like? We saw the engine revving at close to maximum for 45 minutes or so against Wales on Monday before a splutter and a second-half stall. If Wales overcome Iran in Friday\u2019s early kick-off the US will have seven hours before facing England to digest the need to win at least one of their remaining two games in Group B. Iran, clearly, are beatable. And there\u2019s an argument to be made that the Welsh defence is more solid than England\u2019s, which contrived to look slapdash against hapless opponents who had only 21% of the possession. A loss to England would leave qualification for the knockout stages \u2013 an important marker for a team trying to build a resum\u00e9 to match its hyped reputation \u2013 in the balance. But on the evidence of the opening fixtures it would be brave to predict that the US can suppress England\u2019s effervescent attack over 90 minutes (or 100-plus minutes, as games seem to be in Qatar).  It\u2019s the fake baby effect. In the 2014 Clint Eastwood film, American Sniper, Bradley Cooper\u2019s character cradles a plastic doll that we are supposed to believe is his newborn son. A solitary misbegotten scene in an otherwise carefully crafted movie that lasts more than two hours. Perhaps it shouldn\u2019t matter much. However, it\u2019s such an obvious prop, such an egregious misjudgment by the filmmakers, that the entire enterprise loses credibility. For competitors at this level, be it Academy Awards or World Cup, one glaring screw-up is one too many. So it was that a single foul, the penalty conceded by Walker Zimmerman late in the 1-1 draw, undermined a convincing first-half performance. You could appreciate the entertainment and see the talent \u2013 just not fully trust it, not believe wholeheartedly and unconditionally that what you\u2019re watching will stand up to the most intense scrutiny. Not, at any rate, at this mid-point on a growth curve plotted from the low of failing to reach the 2018 tournament towards co-hosting in 2026. With two-thirds possession but only a one-goal lead at the break the US failed to reap enough profit from what was, given the stakes, as impressive a half as any under Gregg Berhalter\u2019s tenure. But for a rash tackle from one of his most reliable players during Concacaf qualifying, the prevailing narrative centered on the head coach would be praise for his team selection, not serrated questions about why he left the prodigal playmaker Gio Reyna on the bench but introduced a more workaday winger in Jordan Morris in the late stages. The decision to call 35-year-old Tim Ream in from the cold paid off, with the Fulham defender composed and competent. Midfielder Tyler Adams, a day after being announced as captain after a players\u2019 vote, was the best player on the pitch. Those conked-out September friendlies against Japan (0-2) and Saudi Arabia (0-0) felt distant and irrelevant. Enacting Berhalter\u2019s vision, the US pressed high from the first whistle. Wales were almost overwhelmed by younger, faster, trickier opponents, their initial bunker-and-break strategy swiftly rendered untenable. A starting XI of World Cup debutants with an average age of 25 was so ferocious they clean forgot to be nervous. Berhalter\u2019s side were versatile, too, with supple goalscorer Tim Weah and buzzing set-up man Christian Pulisic dangerous on the flanks, Antonee Robinson and Sergi\u00f1o Dest advancing with intent from full back, 19-year-old Yunus Musah scudding through central midfield and striker Josh Sargent grazing a post with a header and hassling center backs. \u201cWe came out on fire,\u201d goalkeeper Matt Turner told Fox Sports. But fires burn out or are put out. The context for the individual error that led to Gareth Bale\u2019s equalizer was a build-up of pressure on the US defense caused by Wales employing more direct tactics and raising their tempo in the second period and the US proving unable to adjust to the new challenge.  This is not a new complaint. As Berhalter continues a project began during the J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann era to renovate the foundations of the national team, to make the planet admire an American side for its skill as well as its spirit, its dazzle and not merely its grind, some resilience and flexibility has been lost. That may be the price of youth, or a coaching blemish. Wales, for all the talk of this being their first World Cup finals since 1958, did compete in Euro 2020 last year, reached the semi-finals of Euro 2016, and qualified for this tournament via two do-or-die playoff games. Their squad is limited but has abundant experience and tenacity and one of the great moment-seizers in Bale.  In the second half, as the Americans sought to protect their lead and reassert their dominance, Berhalter introduced fresh legs but not fresh ideas. Weah\u2019s 36th-minute goal turned out to be the only US shot on target, reinforcing pre-tournament fears about the team\u2019s lack of potency in the absence of a high-caliber striker. New generation, old problem: the US haven\u2019t beaten a European nation at a World Cup finals since a 3-2 victory over Portugal in 2002. A line-up that is almost entirely stacked with Europe-based players gets another opportunity on Friday. Playing to their dynamic strengths, they will no doubt aim to start fast again, as the England manager expects. But if the US can\u2019t act the part in the later stages, when the first flurries subside and the contest evolves into a test of wit and will, then they aren\u2019t yet for real."

                    "body": "The casual cricket fan \u2013 particularly one who avoids social media \u2013 could conceivably think England\u2019s Barmy Army remains a wholly amateur affair. A regular run of printed T-shirts, perhaps, and an uncomfortably large WhatsApp group. A scratch brass quartet and a couple of organised types who block-book flights to the Caribbean or Cape Town. That would be about the size of it; or so the uninitiated may believe. Cricket\u2019s more avid followers know the reality. Since its inception nearly 30 years ago on the 1994-95 Ashes tour to Australia, the Barmy Army has become a phenomenon, constantly visible and certainly audible wherever England are playing. It has transformed into a smartly run travel company specialising in selling cricket tours, that now aims to diversify into offering British &amp; Irish Lions and Ryder Cup packages.  Pakistan is the next stop, 17 years since England\u2019s previous visit for a Test series, but the recent assassination attempt on Imran Khan has thrown the itinerary into doubt. A decision is imminent on moving the first Test, due to begin on 1 December, from Rawalpindi. \u201cWe\u2019re working on extra measures to see how we can provide that extra comfort to anyone that\u2019s travelling,\u201d says Chris Millard, the Barmy Army\u2019s 28-year-old managing director, of the security situation. \u201cIf we can play our role in making sure it\u2019s as safe as possible we\u2019ll try our best to do so. We\u2019re in direct communication with the consulate.\u201d It is a different world now from the 1990s, an era when the Baggy Greens, led by Mark Taylor and then Steve Waugh, turned into a ruthless Pom-bashing machine. Through all those gleeful beatings over five days or fewer, English fans kept on coming, and carried on singing. Their enthusiasm for taking a drubbing on the cricket field became an object of confusion, curiosity and mirth. A term casually coined by an Australian journalist was a reflection of what was, based on results, a desperate time for English cricket. \u201cIt was a case of England getting battered. Fans doing the conga, getting all sorts of stuff chucked at them, fruit and whatever,\u201d Andy Thompson tells the Guardian. Thompson led the Army\u2019s tours for several years, and has witnessed 71 of England\u2019s overseas Tests. \u201cI don\u2019t think the locals could understand the humour, really,\u201d he says. \u201cSomebody wrote, \u2018They\u2019re the Barmy Army\u2019 and it caught on.\u201d There was method in the madness. Even before the end of that 94-95 tour, having initially printed \u201cAtherton\u2019s Barmy Army\u201d on T-shirts and shifted a few hundred, the astute founders had trademarked the Barmy Army brand. It is fair to observe that the organisation continues to divide opinion. From obvious complaints such as the relentless singing, through to more delicate post-colonial tensions inherent in plastering foreign stadiums with the flag of St George, it is a complicated picture.  There is a discussion to be had about the commodification of sporting passion, and what can be perceived as forced fun. Simultaneously loving Ben Stokes and leaving your shoes on remains a valid choice. But like it or not, the Barmy Army is in the dictionary, part of the lexicon, a pillar of the sport\u2019s establishment. Is it, perhaps, a bit too easy to criticise? Significantly, at a moment when the existence of the five-day game is threatened by shorter formats and an increasingly jammed calendar, the Barmy Army continues to go into bat for the future of Test cricket. \u201cI do think while the Barmy Army is around, Test cricket will still be played,\u201d says Millard. \u201cWe\u2019re really passionate Test cricket fans. That\u2019s where we developed from, and it will always be our roots.\u201d An England tour to Barbados, as Millard says, generates millions of dollars for the hosts\u2019 economy. The locals naturally welcome it, although they, like England fans, must wait at least five years for the next Caribbean Test tour. The organisation is also committed to increasing diversity among its 40,000-plus membership. \u201cWe don\u2019t want it assumed we\u2019re middle-class men drinking on terraces. It\u2019s just not true,\u201d Millard says. \u201cThe demographic is wider than that, and that\u2019s something we should be proud of.\u201d Thompson, who will travel to Pakistan, adds: \u201cThere\u2019s the image of sunburn and tight football shirts. That\u2019s an incorrect stereotype, really. We know our cricket. Most of the journalists know us, and respect us.\u201d He says a number of tourists are \u201cwidows, widowers, single travellers who want to travel on their own but be with like-minded people\u201d. The Barmy Army are also determined fundraisers, involved with local charities wherever England tour. They actively support women\u2019s cricket, having sponsored a team at the FairBreak T20 tournament in Dubai this year. The cost of their packages is an issue for some, but as Millard says: \u201cWe can\u2019t do everything for free \u2026 we run a membership that\u2019s only \u00a335 a year, and for that we give access to \u2018beat the ballot\u2019 Ashes tickets.\u201d Millard points out that in 2020, when the pandemic forced the cancellation of England\u2019s Sri Lanka trip, full refunds were issued within a couple of days.Back in the 1990s, attitudes from the press box were distinctly sniffy and suspicious. As Thompson says, however, the majority of journalists have come to see the Barmy Army as a force for good: loyal, genuine supporters who love the game.  And never mind the media \u2013 it is notable that players, not just England\u2019s, have been converted. \u201cPlaying in front of the English fans has been an absolute pleasure,\u201d the West Indies wicketkeeper Joshua Da Silva told the Guardian during England\u2019s tour in March. \u201cI love the songs, the jokes, the laughter \u2026 the Barmy Army has pushed us on to play hard Test cricket.\u201d Rawalpindi is (for the moment) the next stop. \u201cIt\u2019s been such a long time since we\u2019ve been to Pakistan,\u201d says Millard. \u201cWe reckon there\u2019ll be 100 to 150 members there, which is a great number. We\u2019re excited for it.\u201d Defending the longest form of the game while reviving sports-driven tourism to destinations such as Pakistan. Having fun and raising money for charity. Boosting the women\u2019s game. Even motivating England\u2019s opponents to play harder Test cricket. What, exactly, could be the problem? \u201cTo get the true experience, you need to get on a plane to Pakistan with us,\u201d Thompson says. It doesn\u2019t seem like such a bad idea.

                    "body": "Eddie Howe believes Dan Burn was unlucky not to make England\u2019s World Cup squad and is adamant his 6ft 6in defender should not abandon hope of a call from Gareth Southgate. Burn has excelled at centre-half and, more recently, left-back since joining Howe\u2019s Newcastle from Brighton for \u00a313m last January. After proving instrumental in helping the team avoid relegation last season, the 30-year-old has been integral to their rise. Last Tuesday Burn, who grew up in Northumberland idolising Alan Shearer, scored his first goal for Newcastle as they beat Leicester 2-0 in the Carabao Cup quarter-final.  Howe said of an England call-up: \u201cDan probably is silently very motivated by that. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something he\u2019d necessarily communicate to me or his teammates. I think he\u2019s very much of the mindset that his performances speak for themselves and that he would hope they would be enough to be in contention. \u201cFor me, without putting too much pressure on Gareth, he was very unlucky not to go to the World Cup. I think he would have been very close. He just missed out I think and he\u2019s carried that form on since. Credit to Dan, he\u2019s maintained the same level since the World Cup ended and that dream faded for him. \u201cBut at 30 there\u2019s still time for him. I think his adaptability and versatility is potentially a real avenue, potentially a real way into the England squad.\u201d The irony is that Burn, rejected by Newcastle as an 11-year-old but watched several times in person by Southgate during the autumn, was not Howe\u2019s first- or even second-choice defensive signing this time last year. Not that Newcastle\u2019s manager harbours the remotest shred of regret about acquiring his burgeoning talent and mature off-field influence. \u201cI think Dan has improved,\u201d said Howe. \u201cHe\u2019s done a very, very good job in any position I\u2019ve asked him to play. He\u2019s embraced everything this club stands for. He\u2019s got a winning mindset. He\u2019s not here just to play for Newcastle, he wants to achieve things here. It\u2019s turned out to be a very good transfer for us. \u201cDan\u2019s very humble, he\u2019s very easy to manage. He\u2019s very low maintenance. And he\u2019s a top player as well.\u201d"

                    "body": "Patrick Vieira must be wondering how he got this so wrong. Crystal Palace\u2019s hopes of recording a fourth successive home victory in the Premier League for the first time in their history were destroyed within three minutes at the end of the first half by a clinical Fulham team led by the brilliant Aleksandar Mitrovic. Disastrous defending which allowed Bobby De Cordova-Reid to open the scoring was compounded by Tyrick Mitchell\u2019s rush of blood that earned him a straight red card and left Vieira\u2019s side with a mountain to climb. Another red card for James Tomkins \u2013 making his first Premier League start since Boxing Day last year in the absence of the suspended Marc Gu\u00e9hi \u2013 plus goals from Tim Ream \u2013 the captain\u2019s first in the Premier League \u2013 and Mitrovic\u2019s 10th of the campaign, earned a deserved victory for Marco Silva\u2019s side. That means they already need only two more wins to match their points tally from two seasons ago.  \u201cWe had a plan and the players stuck to the plan,\u201d said Silva. \u201cTheir home record is very strong but we were the best team on the pitch and showed the maturity we needed.\u201d Both teams went into the World Cup break having to stew on disappointing defeats, with Palace starting the day behind their visitors only on goal difference having played a game fewer. With the home support starved of competitive action since a win over Southampton here nearly two months ago, Palace were given a hearty welcome as they emerged to Insomnia, by Faithless, in a tribute to Palace\u2019s former associate director Maxi Jazz, who died on Saturday. Silva admitted beforehand that Mitrovic had still not fully recovered from the foot injury that caused him to miss Fulham\u2019s last two matches before the World Cup despite then going on to play all three of Serbia\u2019s games in Qatar. Yet such is his importance to this side that it was no surprise to see him playing a starring role as they recorded a first win since winning at Leeds in October.  Almost as much as Mitrovic, Andreas Pereira was the driving force behind Fulham\u2019s excellent start to the season and his dipping free-kick from long range forced Vicente Guaita into early action. With Eberechi Eze stuck out in an unfamiliar position on the left flank, Harrison Reed and the outstanding Jo\u00e3o Palhinha were able to dominate the early midfield exchanges. Meanwhile, an isolated Wilfried Zaha was left to feed off the few scraps that came his way up front. A mazy dribble from the elusive Michael Olise midway through the half finally injected some urgency into the home side but Jordan Ayew saw his shot strike the bar. Mitrovic looked aghast when the referee, Andy Madley, ruled against him after a tussle with Nathaniel Clyne but less than a minute later it was his inviting pinpoint cross that allowed De Cordova-Reid to give Fulham the lead with a glancing header.  The Palace supporters barely had time to digest that bad news when more arrived in the form of Mitchell\u2019s dismissal. Having miscontrolled the ball with his chest, the England defender caught Kenny Tete high up on a shin and left Madley with no other option. Mitchell headed down the tunnel with his shirt over his head. Vieira looked less than impressed as Palace left the pitch at half-time and they emerged for the second half no doubt with their manager\u2019s words still ringing in their ears. But any hopes of a comeback appeared to be over when Tomkins was sent off after being shown a second yellow card for blocking a Mitrovic run with his shoulder. It was a decision that incensed Vieira and the home supporters, who must have sensed this was not going to be their day. \u201cFrom the first minute Fulham were the better team. In the end we got what we deserved,\u201d admitted a despondent Vieira. Palace\u2019s fate was sealed when Ream lashed home from close range after Mitrovic was first to another corner. Replays showed the Serb was pulling Joel Ward\u2019s shirt in the box and the ball struck his hand but Madley ruled that it was still a goal after being sent to review the incident by VAR. Having already hit a post, Pereira could have made it an even more forgettable occasion for Palace had Guaita not come to the rescue. But it was Mitrovic who was to have the final say as he glanced home Willian\u2019s cross to round off the perfect afternoon for Fulham."

                    "body": "Good morning. From today, an EU and G7 price cap of $60 a barrel for Russian oil will put unprecedented new limits on Vladimir Putin\u2019s ability to fund his war machine. Meanwhile, a ban on importing any Urals oil within the EU will further limit the market for Russian crude. This might sound technical and obscure. But taken together, the two measures are arguably the biggest intervention by buyers in global oil markets in modern history. As significant as they are, these steps raise many questions. Will they increase overall global oil prices \u2013 which rose slightly this morning - and push inflation further up? Will countries like China and India fall in line? And will they really hit Russia where it hurts \u2013 or do they fall short of what\u2019s needed to have an impact on the ground in Ukraine? Today\u2019s newsletter, with the Guardian\u2019s diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour, is about what the key players want the strategy to achieve \u2013 and how Putin might react. Here are the headlines \u2013 and for the details of England\u2019s victory over Senegal in last night\u2019s knockout match, scroll down to the World Cup section. Five big stories  Inequality | People in the UK are getting \u201csicker and poorer\u201d, with a worsening health and wealth divide between regions, research has found. New data shows that sickness is twice as likely to force people out of work in the north-east of England, Wales and Northern Ireland as in London and the south-east. Policing | Metropolitan police officers in schools are to be monitored to see if they are disproportionately targeting black children. The initiative is part of a package of new measures which London mayor Sadiq Khan says will reduce racial disproportionality in the use of police powers. Strikes | The Conservative party chairman, Nadhim Zahawi, has been accused of insulting NHS workers with a \u201cludicrous\u201d suggestion that it is the wrong time to strike over low pay because it would help Vladimir Putin divide the west. Strep A | The UK government has urged parents to be vigilant for signs of a rare invasive form of strep A infection, after it was reported that a 12-year-old schoolboy from London was the latest person to have died after contracting it. Immigration and asylum | Locking up people who enter the country illegally and barring them from settling in the UK are \u201coptions\u201d under consideration as the government puts a crackdown on \u201csmall boats\u201d at the heart of its agenda. The ideas are set out in a new thinktank report with a foreword by home secretary Suella Braverman.  In depth: \u2018It\u2019s very hard to find agreement on measures that will really hit Russia\u2019  After Russia invaded Ukraine, the US and EU acted to bring in an unprecedented set of sanctions designed to limit the country\u2019s ability to wage war. But because of Europe\u2019s heavy reliance on Russian oil and gas, it moved more cautiously on energy than in other areas. As Moscow found alternative buyers to replace the decline in orders from Europe, Russian crude oil exports held up. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of short-term oscillation,\u201d Patrick Wintour said. \u201cBut there\u2019s not been a huge long-term change. They\u2019re still raking in a huge amount of revenue.\u201d That is the backdrop to the interventions finally agreed by EU countries that are set to come in today after they were initially proposed in May. They include a ban on maritime imports of Russian oil, and a price cap \u2013 together with the G7 nations and Australia \u2013 that would apply to any country wishing to use European insurance or shipping. But the plan has to serve two goals that are clearly in tension, Patrick said. \u201cOn the one hand, it has to reduce Russian revenue. But it also has to protect the global economy and keep inflation under control.\u201d Now that the EU has agreed to a $60 limit, here\u2019s a guide to how the key players have been thinking about that balance. *** The US, EU leaders, and the G7 Before the war and the coronavirus crisis, Russian crude oil typically sold for between $55 and $65 a barrel. In that context, a cap of $60 looks conservative. That reflects the influence of Brussels and the US in shaping the decision, Patrick said. \u201cThe issue for them is, you don\u2019t want the Russians to pull the plug altogether. You need it to be worth it for them to sell the oil, but you want to limit their profits.\u201d Another upward pressure on the agreed cap: the influence of Greece and Malta. \u201cThey have big oil tanker industries, and when the negotiations started, they were arguing for a price of around $80,\u201d Patrick said. The other main intervention coming into effect today \u2013 the ban on maritime imports to EU nations \u2013 will have a limited impact. \u201cAt one point, it felt like the US was pushing the cap because it thought that ban would lead to a massive spike in the price of oil. But now there are so many carve-outs it is less consequential.\u201d *** Poland, Estonia, and other Baltic states The Baltic states closest to the conflict have argued for a much lower cap. \u201cA group of countries led by Poland and Estonia say that it should be well below $60 \u2013 they argue that anything above about $45 is giving Russia a profit. Poland was arguing for around $30, and Estonia has backed the Poles,\u201d Patrick said. Meanwhile, Volodymyr Zelenskiy was critical of the $60 cap at the weekend, calling it a \u201cweak position\u201d, and noting that the difference between $30 and $60 a barrel was about $100bn a year. That disagreement has led to intensive US lobbying \u2013 and while Poland and Estonia might be smaller nations and economies, they wield significant influence because of the need for EU unanimity. \u201cThe pressure applied to the Estonians from the Americans has been quite extraordinary,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cBut they have really held out.\u201d The deal that was eventually struck came after Poland secured a mechanism which would see the level of the cap reviewed every two months, with the aim of setting the cap at least 5% below the market price for Russian crude. *** India, China, and other global buyers  As European demand has fallen, Russia has been able to make up a lot of the shortfall in revenue by selling more oil to other countries, with India and China among the largest new buyers. One crucial question about the efficacy of the European cap is whether those countries will abide by it. You might think that other buyers would be delighted at any move which means they get cheaper oil \u2013 but they will also be considering the strategic downside of alienating Russia. Still, the EU and US wield a useful tool: any country importing oil needs to insure its transportation, and find the shipping in the first place. The rules enforcing the cap state that no European insurance firm or shipping company can be involved in a deal at a higher price. \u201cUK firms provide about 95% of the insurance for oil shipping,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cSo the theory is that that will limit purchases at a higher price. But the British insurance industry doesn\u2019t want to lose what is effectively a monopoly.\u201d With six months since the policy was first announced, there is a possibility that alternative insurance suppliers, perhaps Russian, could appear. \u201cBut it\u2019s a very sophisticated market,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t clear that they have been able to do that.\u201d *** Opec and other global sellers It has been clear since Saudi Arabia rejected Joe Biden\u2019s entreaties to increase oil production in October that major oil producers, particularly the 13 Opec member states, are unwilling to bring the price down to suit western interests. \u201cThey are very opposed to third party interventions,\u201d Patrick said. The US has sought to mitigate the impact of Opec\u2019s stance by releasing large quantities of oil from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve. \u201cBut that stock is running down quite fast, and its ability to do the same in future is going to be less.\u201d Sure enough, at a meeting of Opec+ on Sunday \u2013 the Opec countries with other oil producing nations including Russia and Venezuela \u2013 member states stuck to their guns, and agreed to maintain their existing output targets. But it reserved the right to take \u201cimmediate\u201d action to stabilise markets \u201cat any time\u201d. *** Russia As ever for Ukraine\u2019s western allies, the most difficult unknown is how far Vladimir Putin is prepared to go to hurt his enemies. The fact that Russia has been working to put in place alternative insurance options \u2013 and has sought to acquire about 100 tankers for a \u201cshadow fleet\u201d to transport its oil if others will not \u2013 suggests that a total cut-off is unlikely. But there are other significant questions hanging over the decision on the cap. \u201cThere\u2019s a finger in the wind element to this,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cNobody is absolutely sure of the real price Russia is paying to produce a barrel. And you can\u2019t predict worldwide demand.\u201d In the end, he said, caution over cutting off supplies completely are likely to mean that the cap has fewer teeth than initially hoped. \u201cIf it is set at a price that the market is currently bearing, it\u2019s going to be a pretty nugatory effect,\u201d he said. \u201cYou might see it as slightly pointless. But it is very hard to find agreement on measures that will really hit the Russian war machine.\u201d What else we\u2019ve been reading  Made.com was a stunning e-commerce success story, capitalising on a millennial appetite for affordable luxury furniture to pass \u00a31bn in total sales by its tenth birthday.

                    "body": "Gareth Southgate moved to dismiss the \u201cmisconceptions\u201d that have built around James Maddison after giving him a shock call-up to his World Cup squad. The England manager also recalled Marcus Rashford, Callum Wilson, Conor Gallagher and Ben White as he looked forward to travelling to Qatar early next week and kicking off the tournament against Iran on 21 November.\nThe manager has selected Kyle Walker and Kalvin Phillips despite their fitness issues but he felt that he could not include Reece James, who would not have recovered from a knee injury until the latter stages. There was disappointment for Fikayo Tomori, Marc Gu\u00e9hi, James Ward-Prowse, Jarrod Bowen, Tammy Abraham and Ivan Toney \u2013 all of whom were omitted.\n\nSouthgate made a personal call to Maddison on Thursdaymorning to tell him the good news. It came out of the blue for the Leicester playmaker, who feared he would remain in the cold despite his outstanding form this year.\nMaddison has played only once for England, as a 56th-minute substitute against Montenegro in November 2019. The previous month, he had withdrawn from the squad for the games against the Czech Republic and Bulgaria, citing illness. He was then photographed at a casino while his teammates lost in Prague, leading to uncomfortable questions for Southgate and the sense that the ultra-confident player might not be a good fit with the manager.\nSouthgate said that the casino episode had been a bigger issue for Maddison than him as he offered a ringing endorsement of the now 25-year-old\u2019s character and ability to be a good tourist in Qatar.\n\u201cThere are some misconceptions, perhaps, about James,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cHe is a bit of a football student. I was with him at an Under-21s tournament and my experiences with him then and when he was with us was that he wanted to talk about the game and what was expected.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always said that not selecting him was for football reasons and in the main the capabilities of others in the group. I\u2019ve got no concerns about how he will be with the group.\u201d\nSouthgate insisted that Maddison could force his way into the starting XI \u2013 the same is true of every player, he added \u2013 and he concluded a couple of weeks ago that he could ignore him no longer. \u201cHe is playing as well as any of the attacking players in the country,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cHe can offer something different.\u201d\nRashford is back after a torrid season last time out, during which Southgate first overlooked him for the friendlies in March. The striker\u2019s previous England appearance came in the Euro 2020 penalty shootout defeat against Italy, when he missed his spot-kick.\n\nThe forward has been much improved under Erik ten Hag at Manchester United, scoring seven goals \u2013 most recently the far-post headed winner against West Ham at the end of last month. Southgate sees him primarily as an option off the left, running in behind opponents, although he said that he could use him as a backup to Harry Kane in the middle.\n\u201cHe is showing signs with United that the joy of playing is back in his face,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him arrive at the far post with a header which is quite staggering. They are things that we\u2019ve talked about over the years. He\u2019s looking more like the player we\u2019ve seen and I think he can be even more than that.\u201d\nWith Maddison, Rashford and the in-form Wilson on board, there is a boldness about Southgate\u2019s selection, which also takes in the threat and pressing energy of Gallagher.\nWilson won the last of his four caps in October 2019 but he has forced Southgate\u2019s hand with six goals in 10 Premier League matches for Newcastle this season. Southgate made the point that Abraham, who he had picked in all his squads since October of last year, had chosen a bad time to stop scoring at Roma. \nPhillips has barely played all season but he did return from a shoulder injury as a substitute for Manchester City against Chelsea in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday. Southgate has taken him because he is the only specialist defensive midfield support for Declan Rice, although he is mindful of the need to build Phillips\u2019s fitness. Walker is not yet back in full training after groin surgery but he should be available before the end of the group stage.\nSouthgate promised to continue to engage with questions about Qatar\u2019s dismal human rights record, despite Fifa ordering the competing nations to focus on the football.\n\u201cFrankly, I will choose if I speak or not and I am sure the players will as well,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we are necessarily going to be swayed by that communication. We have to be focused on the football but we will speak when asked. We will answer questions and rightly so.\n\u201cI am not sure there is a lot more I can say on those topics that is new, if I am frank. But we are in a position where we do have some influence and we have tried to use that.\u201d"

                    "body": "Cristiano Ronaldo has left Manchester United by \u201cmutual agreement\u201d in the aftermath of his making serious allegations in an interview, in an ignominious end to a supremely successful career at the club. He has left without a payoff and there are no restrictions on whom he can play for next.\nUnited had appointed lawyers to explore potential action against Ronaldo for alleged breach of contract but their preferred option was to engineer his departure and that was confirmed on Tuesday.\nA statement said: \u201cCristiano Ronaldo is to leave Manchester United by mutual agreement, with immediate effect. The club thanks him for his immense contribution across two spells at Old Trafford, scoring 145 goals in 346 appearances, and wishes him and his family well for the future. Everyone at Manchester United remains focused on continuing the team\u2019s progress under Erik ten Hag and working together to deliver success on the pitch.\u201d\nRonaldo\u2019s allegations included that he was being forced out by United, that senior executives lacked empathy after his newborn son died in April, that the owners, the Glazer family, do not care about the club and that the manager, Ten Hag, did not respect him.\n\nRonaldo is with Portugal at the Qatar World Cup and in his absence United banned him from the training ground and explored potential legal action.\nRonaldo, who had about \u00a313.5m left on a contract that expired in June, said: \u201cFollowing conversations with Manchester United we have mutually agreed to end our contract early. I love Manchester United and I love the fans, that will never ever change. However, it feels like the right time for me to seek a new challenge.\u201d\nUnited may seek to replace him in January.\nIn his first spell at United, between 2003 and 2009, Ronaldo won the Champions League, three Premier Leagues, the FA Cup, two League Cups and the Fifa World Player of the Year award.\n\nThe manner of his exit and what predicated it, though, may seriously tarnish his reputation. He twice walked out of United games after Ten Hag took over, after letting it be known he wanted a transfer in the summer.\nThe first early departure came when Ronaldo was taken off at half-time of the July friendly visit of Rayo Vallecano to Old Trafford, Ten Hag having removed him because this was Ronaldo\u2019s first action after missing most of pre-season because of a family issue. Although other United players including Diogo Dalot also departed early, Ronaldo was the only one in the match-day squad.\nHe received a warning from Ten Hag, yet before the final whistle of October\u2019s 2-0 victory over Spurs the forward twice refused to enter as a substitute before exiting down the tunnel. The manager suspended Ronaldo for the next match but then made him captain at Aston Villa on 6 November, a 3-1 defeat.\n\nThat last appearance has proved Ronaldo\u2019s last in a United shirt and his next move is unclear. In the summer Chelsea expressed interest but it is thought this was more the desire of the co-owner Todd Boehly than the then manager, Thomas Tuchel, who vetoed signing the player. It is understood Chelsea will not pursue Ronaldo now.\nNapoli, who had been considered another option, recently ruled out signing him in January, though as a free agent Ronaldo can join a club at any time. If an acceptable side in Europe proves impossible another option is to consider playing in Major League Soccer, the Chinese Super League, or making a lucrative move to a western Asian club. Ronaldo recently claimed to have been offered a two-year contract worth \u20ac305m last summer to play for a Saudi Arabian team."

                    "body": "Harvey Elliott is the \u201cone in a million\u201d supporter playing for his boyhood club. The midfielder was indoctrinated into Liverpool by his father, who took him to Anfield on Champions League nights. They would arrive back in Surrey in the early hours before a bleary-eyed Elliott was sent to school. Fate drew the midfielder back to Liverpool, where he has become a mainstay of the midfield this season. Elliott played 11 times last season for the club but an appearance against Spurs on Sunday will be his 20th this time around.  An excellent loan spell at Blackburn in 2020-21 ensured he was firmly in J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s plans at the start of last season, but a dislocated ankle suffered at Leeds in September ruled him out for five months, a spell the teenager used as a learning experience. \u201cIt has made me a better and stronger person. It was probably the best time to go through it, being young and able to get through as quickly as I did,\u201d he says. Elliott has featured in every Premier League and Champions League match this season, a feat matched only by Alisson, Virgil van Dijk, Fabinho and Mohamed Salah. The 19-year-old is coping with the rigours of twice-weekly matches in this condensed run of fixtures before the World Cup. It is unlikely the uncapped teenager will be part of Gareth Southgate\u2019s squad for Qatar, allowing Elliott some rest. Elliott travelled to Kyiv to watch the 2018 final when Liverpool lost to Real Madrid with his father, who fell in love with the team of John Barnes and Ian Rush and took his son to Anfield for the first time aged three. It was this bond that helped him choose the Reds over a number of top European clubs when leaving Fulham. \u201cI went to the majority of games when they were down south, if I wasn\u2019t playing for Fulham. To get to the games was hard, but if we could, we would,\u201d he says. \u201cA few times we travelled up to watch Champions League games. I remember seeing the floodlights and the teams warming up, it was something I dreamed of, whether it was for Liverpool or any team professionally. It is a one in a million dream to end playing for your boyhood club.\u201d  Sixteen points from 12 games make this Liverpool\u2019s worst start to a Premier League season under Klopp. They have suffered back-to-back defeats against Nottingham Forest and Leeds going into their trip to north London. \u201cThere\u2019s no point in feeling the pressure and getting yourself worked up over things,\u201d Elliott says. \u201cIt\u2019s what I\u2019ve dreamed of and I\u2019m doing it so each and every game I\u2019m the happiest kid in the world putting on the Liverpool shirt to go out and play.\u201d A first Premier League goal arrived for Elliott in the 9-0 win over Bournemouth, causing his euphoric father to throw his coat 40 feet from his seat. \u201cIt was a tough one for me because I lost a family member [his grandmother] a few days before, so it was mixed emotions scoring my first Premier League goal,\u201d Elliott says. \u201cMy mum actually said: \u2018You\u2019re going to score today and dedicate it to her,\u2019 so to know that someone\u2019s up there listening and to be able to do it at Anfield in front of all the fans, there\u2019s no better place to do it.\u201d It seems a long time ago that Elliott broke the record as the youngest Premier League player, making his Fulham debut aged 16 and 30 days. Since then he has made the move to Anfield, won the League Cup, Uefa Super Cup and Fifa Club World Cup, all before turning 20. \u201cI remember when I used to get a new pair of boots, I always used to sleep with them. I\u2019ve grown up in a football family; my uncle plays football, my dad used to play, and now my brother plays. Wherever you go there\u2019s a football and as a kid if there was anything laying around on the floor I used to volley it as hard as I could. \u201cI\u2019ve always had that vision of being a footballer and just put everything into it along with my family and, thankfully, it\u2019s paying off a little bit,\u201d says Elliott, with a touch of understatement."

                    "body": "A mixed bag of June fixtures wrapped up on Tuesday with a testy 1-1 draw away to El Salvador as USMNT head coach Gregg Berhalter continued his World Cup preparations. The window opened with two useful friendlies against World Cup-bound nations \u2013 a morale-boosting 3-0 victory over Morocco and a resilient and sometimes fluent goalless draw with a slightly superior Uruguay team. Then came the imposition of two Concacaf Nations League fixtures: a virtually meaningless 5-0 win over Grenada and Tuesday\u2019s visit to sodden San Salvador, in which an injury-time Jordan Morris header saved American blushes \u2013 and exemplified American determination. A spirited second-half display was the main positive for the US, as Yunus Musah delivered a kinetic star turn. Substitute Paul Arriola was sent off for a lunge and El Salvador also ended the match with 10 men. It was an archetypal febrile, bad-tempered, VAR-less Concacaf scrap on a dreadful surface, a context that will bear little resemblance to the Group B games in Qatar against Wales, England and Iran. You\u2019d hope. Here are a few takeaways from the latest round up matches. Ferreira up front France famously won the \u201998 World Cup with a goal-averse striker turned swimming-pool salesman, St\u00e9phane Guivarc\u2019h, leading the line. It shouldn\u2019t be beyond the US to get out of their group without a top-class No 9. The wingers are a threat, the midfield has drive, and it\u2019s not as if the central strikers contributed much from open play during the successful qualifying campaign. As of now the best option appears to be Jes\u00fas Ferreira of FC Dallas. The in-form 21-year-old moves well off the ball and scored four goals against Grenada in Austin last Friday. True, you could fit the entire adult population of Grenada into 108,000-capacity Michigan Stadium. But given the modest calibre of the opposition and his quiet performances against Uruguay and Morocco, the pressure was on Ferreira to fill his boots and he did, with three fine finishes and a tap-in.  Haji Wright of Antalyaspor was given his first US start against El Salvador but enjoyed little service and there was not much to note other than a decent chance the 24-year-old put wide. He was taken off at half time and replaced with Ferreira, but it was another substitute, the pugnacious Morris, who delivered the equaliser from close range. Horvath horror show  Nottingham Forest back-up keeper Ethan Horvath got his chance on Tuesday on a pitch seemingly imported from the Glastonbury festival. His feet appeared stuck in the mud in the 35th minute as he watched Alexander Larin\u2019s cross/shot fly into the net. Rain won\u2019t be a problem in Qatar, but the goal \u2013 El Salvador\u2019s only shot on target \u2013 was the kind of cruel moment that can doom an international career. Matt Turner was solid in goal against Morocco and didn\u2019t face a shot on target against Grenada, while Sean Johnson excelled against Uruguay, the toughest opponent the US met this month. With Zack Steffen not in the squad, both Turner and Johnson bolstered their cases to be picked ahead of the error-prone Manchester City reserve. Turner may now be the favourite to start in Qatar, even if he doesn\u2019t see much first-team action at Arsenal next season. Tuesday\u2019s freakish strike was the only goal the US conceded in the four games. The redoubtable Aaron Long partnered Cameron Carter-Vickers at center-back against El Salvador and deserves the edge over the Celtic defender as Berhalter decides who will slot in alongside first-choice Walker Zimmerman. Two games to go  The US only have just 180 minutes of match action before the World Cup. Come the autumn and September\u2019s climatic pair of friendlies in Europe, Berhalter will have to decide how much weight he places on current club form as opposed to what he\u2019s witnessed over the longer term in training camps and international matches. That\u2019s a calculation for any manager ahead of a World Cup, of course. But this time the finals take place in November and December, less than halfway through the European season. Not to mention the sheer number of American players who may be on the move this summer \u2013 or have already switched clubs, like Brenden Aaronson. The Athletic listed 14 who could soon change employers, including key men such as Christian Pulisic, Sergi\u00f1o Dest and Weston McKennie. Maybe they flourish in fresh surroundings; perhaps they struggle to adapt. Berhalter\u2019s best-laid plans may end up requiring significant last-minute revision even without injuries. Leaving it late On the one hand, the fewer people who see Pulisic\u2019s latest hairstyle, the better. On the other, the lack of buzz around the June window was a shame. With five months until kick-off against Wales in Qatar, the fixtures didn\u2019t feel like a send-off series. But US Soccer\u2019s policy of playing in small MLS stadiums and late kick-off times for matches broadcast on a merry-go-round of niche channels do nothing to promote the product to casual observers. Sure, Friday\u2019s NBA finals Game 4 held more interest for the average American sports fan than a Nations League stroll in a Texan sweatbox against the world\u2019s 170th-ranked team. But did the Grenada game need to kick off on a Friday night at 10pm ET and be broadcast in English on the cavernous ESPN+ subscription streaming service, where viewers may have been distracted by alternative delights such as the La Crosse Loggers versus the Bismarck Larks in the Northwoods baseball league?  Tuesday\u2019s clash in San Salvador, on FS1, Univision and TUDN, also kicked off at 10pm ET as the USMNT continued its war on people who have to get up early the next morning. The game even clashed with a rescheduled home MLS match for one of the continent\u2019s most popular clubs, as Seattle hosted Vancouver. This on the day that MLS announced a lucrative and comprehensive deal with Apple TV; compare and contrast. Thoughts turn to 2026 As hosts of the biennial Gold Cup, the US are fortunate to play a lot of home games. Habitual travel sickness \u2013 their only away win in the Octagonal was against Honduras, by far the worst team \u2013 doesn\u2019t bode well for Qatar, but it won\u2019t be a problem four years from now. Fifa finally reveals the identity of the 2026 World Cup host cities on Thursday. Mexico City, Monterrey and Guadalajara are safe bets but there\u2019s intrigue regarding the American and Canadian cities. Kansas City ahead of Baltimore/Washington? Houston but not Boston? There are rumblings that Fifa will snub Edmonton, leaving Canada with only Toronto and Vancouver. Then there\u2019s the matter of who\u2019s awarded the prime fixtures, with the New York and Dallas areas vying for the final. Los Angeles, too, though the field at SoFi Stadium is too narrow for Fifa\u2019s liking. That\u2019s right: Stan Kroenke \u2013 the owner of Arsenal and the Colorado Rapids \u2013 built a $5.5bn stadium with soccer as an afterthought."

                    "body": "Cristiano Ronaldo was claiming the goal long after the final whistle and despite all available evidence to the contrary. The superstar without a club was denied, and denied another slice of Portuguese football history too, and may eventually have to accept his country\u2019s serene progress into the last 16 of the World Cup was somewhat more important. Bruno Fernandes scored twice \u2013 despite Ronaldo\u2019s protestations that he converted the first goal against Uruguay \u2013 to ensure Portugal joined Brazil and France as the only teams with a 100% start in the competition.\n\nAn eagerly-awaited clash of two talented and tempestuous heavyweights did not meet expectations but the repercussions could prove monumental for Uruguay. The South Americans must beat Ghana on Friday and hope Portugal do them a favour against South Korea to avoid an ignominious early exit. Ghana have waited 12 years for a chance to avenge their infamous defeat by the hand of Luis Su\u00e1rez at the 2010 World Cup. How they would love to torment a Uruguay team that is yet to become the sum of its big name parts in Qatar.\n\u201cIt is a crucial game but it has nothing to do with what happened 12 years ago,\u201d insisted the Uruguay head coach Diego Alonso. \u201cThis is a different situation. We will bring all the weapons we have.\u201d Alonso started with Federico Valverde, Rodrigo Bentancur, Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez and Edinson Cavani. He introduced Su\u00e1rez and Maxi G\u00f3mez, who both went close to equalising before Portugal were awarded a ridiculously harsh penalty in stoppage time.\n\nBut they were second best throughout to a Portugal team that needed to be patient before finding holes in a resilient Uruguay defence in the second half. Uruguay committed the first foul inside 25 seconds and collected the first booking after six minutes, when Bentancur foolishly fouled R\u00faben Dias. But it did not develop into a simmering game of needle and gamesmanship, despite the presence of Pepe, Su\u00e1rez and others. There was little sign of urgency from Uruguay either in the opening half an hour as they allowed Portugal to dominate possession without seriously troubling the goalkeeper Sergio Rochet. Cavani and N\u00fa\u00f1ez were isolated until Bentancur brought belated positivity to Uruguay\u2019s performance.\nThe Tottenham midfielder should have opened the scoring following a fine run from inside his own half that took him past William Carvalho and Dias. There was one job left to do but, as Diogo Costa advanced, he shot straight at the Portugal goalkeeper who saved with his thigh before gathering at the second attempt. The faces said everything. Bentancur looked to the sky and cursed his finish. Dias and Carvalho glared at each other over their lack of protection.\nA lone and brave pitch invader ran onto the pitch early in the second half carrying a rainbow flag in protest at Qatar\u2019s discriminatory laws. The protestor sported a Superman t-shirt that also had \u2018Save Ukraine\u2019 printed on the front and \u2018Respect for Iranian Women\u2019 on the back. He was wrestled to the ground by two security guards before others helped escort him away.\n\nWhen the game restarted, Portugal seized control thanks to Fernandes\u2019 beautiful cross from the left. Ronaldo read the Manchester United midfielder\u2019s intention perfectly and, played onside by the right wing-back Guillermo Varela, soared to send a glancing header into the far corner. Or so everyone would have thought from Ronaldo\u2019s celebrations. Replays showed he never made contact and Fernandes was rightly awarded the goal.\nRonaldo stared at a giant screen with a look of amusement and amazement as his ninth World Cup goal was chalked off. It would have taken him level with Eus\u00e9bio\u2019s World Cup goalscoring record for Portugal. His nine all came at the 1966 edition. \u201cThe most important thing is that we achieved our aim which is to be in the next round,\u201d said Fernandes. \u201cI celebrated as if it had been Cristiano\u2019s goal. It seemed to me that he had touched the ball. My aim was to cross the ball for him.\u201d\n\nUruguay responded well and were desperately unfortunate not to level when G\u00f3mez struck a post following a neat exchange on the edge of the Portugal penalty area. Costa was well beaten but saved by his left hand post. Su\u00e1rez, who was arguing with the fourth official before setting foot on the pitch, was inches away from converting Giorgian de Arrascaeta\u2019s free-kick at the near post. Their misfortune carried into stoppage time when Portugal were awarded a penalty after Fernandes had nut-megged Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gim\u00e9nez on the edge of the area. The ball struck the defender\u2019s trailing hand as he fell into the challenge and used his arm to support himself yet the Iranian referee was advised to check the pitch-side monitor.\nHe gave a most draconian penalty, sparking understandable fury among Uruguay\u2019s players. Fernandes kept his cool and with a hop, skip and a jump, sent Rochet the wrong way from the spot. The United midfielder was denied a hat-trick by the legs of the Uruguay keeper and a post in the closing seconds. He then had to listen to Ronaldo, who would have taken the penalty had he not been substituted, harp on about the first goal glancing his hair. Ah well, onwards and upwards."

                    "body": "Gareth Southgate has urged his players to stand up and be counted when England play their World Cup quarter-final against France on Saturday night.\nEngland, who have never won a knockout game against an elite-level nation at a major tournament away from home, face a huge test of their quality and mental strength when they take on the world champions at the Al Bayt Stadium. There will be no room for fear against France, whose chief threat will come from Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, and Southgate wants his side to show how how much they have matured since reaching the semi-finals in 2018.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing is going to be our mentality,\u201d England\u2019s head coach said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be tactically prepared. But on these nights you\u2019ve got to have men that stand up and take on the challenge. That\u2019s the bit we\u2019ve got to prove. We\u2019ve had some outstanding nights and the next game is always the most important. It\u2019s against a good level of opponent, one we\u2019re ready for.\n\n\u201cOne, if you\u2019d asked me four years ago were we quite ready, I\u2019m not sure. Now I feel differently and that\u2019s because we\u2019ve got evidence over a long period of results. Historically we have always talked well, but the evidence wasn\u2019t there. Now we\u2019ve got more evidence and we\u2019ve got to nail this type of game now.\u201d\nEngland, boosted by Raheem Sterling returning to their base in Al Wakrah yesterday, have had near misses in their previous two tournaments. They relinquished early leads when they lost to Croatia in the last four of the 2018 World Cup and to Italy in the final of Euro 2020.\n\u201cWe remind them of the hurdles they have overcome to get to this point,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cWe have got players with big-match experience and I have no fear about the young ones because I think they are just going to go and play.\n\u201cThere will be moments where France have bits of play and we have to accept that we are not going to stop them creating a chance. But we have to continue to be brave when those things happen.\u201d\n\nThere has been speculation over whether Southgate intends to revert to a back five to counteract Mbapp\u00e9, who has scored five goals in four games. The 52-year-old revealed that he picked his team on Monday and is expected to stick with the 4-3-3 that helped England beat Senegal in the last 16.\n\u201cUsually if we change shape it\u2019s for a tactical problem rather than an individual problem,\u201d Southgate said. He stressed that England\u2019s forwards were capable of hurting France and he backed Kyle Walker to cope with Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s speed, though he added that combatting the Paris Saint-Germain striker must be a collective effort.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to have zonal coverage on players like that,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cWe also can\u2019t let Antoine Griezmann have the run of the park because he\u2019s a pretty good player. You can\u2019t, against a team of this level, just go out and play and not have any preparation for what they\u2019re doing. But also we can\u2019t overdo that. We\u2019re playing well, we\u2019ve got a lot of strengths and we want to keep accentuating those strengths to the players because they should go into the game in confident mood.\u201d\nSouthgate hopes that Sterling will be able to be on the bench. The winger was back in training as England went through their final preparations, but he missed the Senegal game after flying back to the United Kingdom following a robbery at his home and only returned to Qatar yesterday morning.\nEngland trained with a full complement in mild conditions. The players have spoken with conviction this week and Southgate did not blink when he was asked whether he had become a better manager.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t win, I know where the buck will stop,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s fine. I have to take responsibility. I feel good about where I am on my decision-making and my energy and my excitement for the game.\u201cI\u2019d be an idiot if I hadn\u2019t learned over five years managing some of the biggest games in world football, managing some of the most high-profile players in Europe. I know people think I have a preference for a certain system, but if anything my preference has always been 4-3-3.\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s always been appropriate for us. The job is not just to have a philosophy, the job is to win matches. You can have a philosophy but if you\u2019re going home at the start of the tournament then the philosophy doesn\u2019t wash.\u201d\nIt was pointed out to Southgate, whose deal runs until December 2024 and takes in that year\u2019s European Championship, that defeat by France could see him leave his post. \u201cI would think the sun will come up tomorrow and life will be the same whatever happens,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not the point where we are thinking of going home. I have got confidence in the players. We are in a good place. We have got to step up mentally.\u201d\nSouthgate ended on a positive note, laughing and saying that he was unlikely to celebrate goals by dancing like Brazil\u2019s manager Tite, but he admitted his stance could change if England win the World Cup.\n\u201cThat might be different,\u201d he said. \u201cI am quite happy to embarrass myself at that point. But not beforehand.\u201d"

                    "body": "Germany has agreed a contract with Qatar for the supply of liquefied natural gas (LNG) that will help the European country wean itself off its dependency on Russian energy.\nBut the contract is a long-term solution and will do little to slow the current flow of European money into Russian coffers, estimated to be worth $285m (\u00a3217m) a day for oil alone.\nGermany\u2019s economy minister, Robert Habeck, announced the deal after discussions in Doha, where he was accompanied by German business leaders. \u201cIt is great that I can say it was firmly agreed to enter into a long-term energy partnership \u2013 a cooperation,\u201d Habeck said. \u201cThe companies that are now involved in this journey will enter into contract negotiations with the Qatari side.\u201d He gave no detailed figures on planned imports from Qatar.\nHabeck, a Green party leader in the German coalition government, has faced sharp criticism in recent weeks for refusing to accept a complete energy embargo on Russia, as sought by the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. In a speech to the Bundestag last week, Zelenskiy accused Germany of having only three priorities: \u201ceconomy, economy, economy\u201d.\nPolling shows a majority of Germans would be prepared to make sacrifices, including higher gas prices, if it helped defeat Russia, but the German government either does not believe the polling or thinks the public do not understand the real risk of mass unemployment that an embargo would entail.\n\nHabeck\u2019s visit to Qatar follows Boris Johnson\u2019s apparently fruitless trip to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in an attempt to persuade two traditional British allies in the Gulf to boost oil production.\nQatar is expected to almost double its production of LNG by 2025. Habeck promised that Europe was in the process of reducing its flow of energy from Russia to zero, but at present Germany has no LNG terminals. Two have just been given the go-ahead, at Brunsb\u00fcttel and Wilhelmshaven, but may take three years to build.\nGermany imported about 56bn cubic metres of natural gas from Russia in 2020. Nearly 55% of its gas imports came from Russia, with 40% of the demand for gas in Germany coming from industry. The EU\u2019s total gas imports from Russia are about 168bn cubic metres.\nIn 2020, Qatar exported 106bn cubic metres, selling the bulk of the product to Asian markets. \nIn Doha, Habeck stressed the future for Europe was to develop a diversity of suppliers, and there would be little point in Germany transferring its dependency from one supplier to another. Germany is also in talks with Norway, Canada and the US. He admitted previous German administrations had made a mistake by becoming so dependent on Russia.\nMoscow also provides 34% of German oil, predominantly along the Druzhba pipeline.\nAs a result Germany has insisted the EU does not sanction two banks that service German purchases of Russian energy.\nThe former head of the Ukrainian state energy company Naftogaz, Andriy Kobolyev, believes Germany could take a tougher line by continuing to take Russian energy but refusing to pay for the gas until Russia pulled out of Ukraine. He said Russia cannot simply turn off the gas supplies, and there would be enough to get Germany through the next winter.\n\nHabeck has ruled out reversing the planned switch-off of nuclear power in Germany, scheduled for the end of 2022. But he is said to be open to extending the life of coal powered stations, all due to close by 2030.\nDisputes inside Germany rage over whether it would be possible to cut off Russian energy.\nBruegel, a Brussels-based thinktank, has suggested the EU could survive next winter if all Russian pipeline imports were halted, though it would require painful measures including power rationing.\nThe EU itself has said it aims to reduce the bloc\u2019s gas imports from Russia by nearly two-thirds by the end of 2022, and to make Europe independent from all Russian fossil fuels well before 2030.\nThe French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, hinted France was willing to go further, saying: \u201cShould we immediately stop buying Russian oil, should, a little bit further down the line, we stop importing Russian gas? The president has never ruled out these options.\u201d"

                    "body": "Before England set off for Qatar, there was a feeling at the top of the Football Association, a consensus even. The World Cup was wide open, with eight or nine countries capable of winning it and England were absolutely a part of this pack. Yet if there was one team that stood out in the view of senior FA figures, one to be feared more than the others, it was France.\nPerhaps the view was coloured by the possibility of France lying in wait for England at the quarter\u2011final stage, being the first elite-level nation that Gareth Southgate\u2019s team stood to face. It was a prospect to sharpen minds and one that has duly played out \u2013 the showdown is on for Saturday night at Al Bayt Stadium.\nBut English football has had eyes on France for rather longer \u2013 going back, without exaggeration, to the turn of the millennium. It has felt, at various times, that the FA has measured itself against its French counterpart, that the game in England has had something of a complex about the one across the Channel. It was never more pronounced than in the wake of France\u2019s 1998 World Cup triumph.\n\nWith France on top and England lagging without direction, the FA made an admission that was both humbling and transformative. It was not only ready to learn from France\u2019s methods, it was ready to copy them. It meant a focus on Clairefontaine, the storied academy to the south-west of Paris, which served as the preparatory centre for the France national team and a coaching hub for elite 13- to 15-year-olds.\nBefore the opening of Clairefontaine in 1988, France had won only one international tournament. Then came 1998 and it was followed by victory at Euro 2000, the players in those squads having been nurtured at Clairefontaine.\n\nThe FA wanted to create something similar and, if its research was wide-ranging, it found that the answers did not lie too far from home. In December 2000 it sent a delegation to Clairefontaine, featuring the then director of technical development, Les Reed, and the technical director, Howard Wilkinson. The fixer had been G\u00e9rard Houllier, a former technical director of the French federation who was the manager of Liverpool.\n\u201cThey told us everything,\u201d Reed said, which raised a simple question. Why? Was it out of pity? It was certainly a demonstration of supreme French confidence.\nAt the time, Reed was trying to take elements of the French style and instil them into England\u2019s youth teams \u2013 the one-touch passing and movement off the ball. The broader idea was to rebuild the English game from the bottom up and the driver had to be a national academy. When the plan for such a centre in Burton-on-Trent was announced in February 2001, Wilkinson merely reinforced the old line about imitation and flattery.\n\u201cIt is very difficult to look at the French system and find anything about it with which you do not agree and I see nothing wrong in copying something which is so good,\u201d he said. \u201cI think what they do with players, coaches, strategy and how they manage their teams and operate on a long-term basis, is as sound as you can get and I think the proof is there in the results. We hope we have learned and to a degree we have copied.\u201d\nThe St George\u2019s Park project suffered more than a few false starts. It became marked by missed deadlines and financial problems. After the introspection of the woeful 2010 World Cup campaign under Fabio Capello \u2013 and the latest root-and-branch review \u2013 Southgate remembers thinking: \u201cIf we can\u2019t get a national football centre over the line, then what are we doing?\u201d\n\nSouthgate joined the FA in January 2011 as the head of elite development and one of his responsibilities was to drive the development of the new coaching centre. St George\u2019s Park would eventually open in October 2012 and, as with the French equivalent, Southgate has no doubt that it has been a catalyst for what the England team have gone on to achieve on his managerial watch.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about having a hub for English coaches and young players \u2013 helping them to be comfortable in an England shirt,\u201d Southgate has said. \u201cIt has complemented the great work that has gone on in club academies.\u201d\nSouthgate made a revealing comment after England\u2019s last-16 win against Senegal, which set up the generational showpiece with France. \u201cWhen we look at them at every age group when we are studying all our development teams, they have such depth in every position,\u201d he said.\nFrance remain the benchmark, the team to be toppled. The morning after the Senegal tie, the FA\u2019s head of coaching, Tim Dittmer, gave a detailed presentation to the players on France whom, it emerged, he had tracked for the past two years. It is called preparation. It also advertises a certain respect, a wariness.\nTen years after Clairefontaine opened, France were the world champions. St George\u2019s Park opened 10 years ago. And so, well, you know \u2026 What this England team have to embrace is their status as France\u2019s equals. After Southgate\u2019s one game against them as manager \u2013 the 3-2 friendly defeat at the Stade de France in 2017 \u2013 he said England had to aspire to be more like Didier Deschamps\u2019 team. The belief inside the squad is that now they are.\n\nThere has been much made at this World Cup of the new TV angle for penalties, shot from behind the taker. It makes the goal seem smaller, the goalkeeper enormous, the challenge of scoring so much more difficult. But nothing has changed. It is still a penalty.\nSouthgate and his players cannot be distracted by how France might look, their aura as the defending world champions, the X factor of Kylian Mbapp\u00e9. England have to focus on their reality, what they have rather than what they lack.\nThe manager made the same point before the European Championship final against Italy in the summer of last year, which his team would lose on penalties. \u201cWe always see what\u2019s good in other countries but we look at the negatives of our own country and yet we have got so much to be proud of and so much talent coming through \u2013 in all industries, really,\u201d Southgate said.\nThe signs are that the message has got through. England\u2019s self\u2011assurance is rock solid, partly because of what they have lived in reaching the semi-final at the last World Cup and then the final of the Euros. They trust in the process. It was also interesting to hear Harry Maguire\u2019s take on Wednesday. The central defender not only believes that England will win the World Cup; he feels they have to do so. Nothing else will suffice. And Maguire is not a guy who is given to this kind of talk.\nThe narrative that has bubbled in the background relates to Southgate and whether he will carry on in his role after the tournament. The suspicion is he may not, despite being under contract to December 2024. It is certain that the FA would not want him to walk away \u2013 no matter what happens against France. But would they accept him winning the World Cup and waltzing off into the sunset? They would love it. For all concerned, it is about the glory."

                    "body": "There was an added note of pain for Germany in the tone, the pitch, the basic jauntiness of Costa Rica\u2019s designated goal music, a taunting blast of trumpets and maracas, the kind of thing that gets played on a particularly cruel TV gameshow as the bucket of gunge upends itself over the dunce\u2019s booth.\nGermany did manage something novel at Al Bayt Stadium, exiting the World Cup at the earliest stage despite winning this game 4-2. They spent most of it in, then out; and even witnessed an extraordinary period where it seemed Costa Rica, who played with real heart, were going through instead. With 48 minutes gone Hansi Flick\u2019s team had been bossing this Group E endgame, eyes still fixed on the horizon towards the last 16 of Qatar 2022. Elsewhere in the Doha orbit zone Spain were 1-0 up.\n\nThe German campaign had been weird, marked by Antonio R\u00fcdiger\u2019s mocking knees-high run, and then the F\u00fcllkrug interlude, where a man who could actually score a goal briefly became a kind of Teutonic folk saviour. But this felt like a kind of safety.\nAt which point semi-disaster struck. Japan equalised at the Khalifa International Stadium. Germany now had to recrank the engines, score again and hope for a Spanish revival. But now outright disaster struck as Japan went 2-1 up and suddenly Germany were freewheeling towards the exit doors. This had become a ghost game, dead football, a night of second-screening.\n\nGermany did need a just-in-case goal, needed to win by two, to play like this was still there. They did the opposite. A large channel of space opened down the right. Costa Rica surged through, Keysher Fuller crossing, Manuel Neuer saving the first header and Yeltsin Tejeda burying the rebound.\nThe music blared. Flick slumped deep in his padded chair, eyes bulging. And now the night brought a genuine plot twist. Briefly this stopped being a Germany story and became a Costa Rica one. The second Ticos goal was farcical, all flailing legs, the ball bundled home off Neuer. A goal to the good, Costa Rica stood on the verge of pub quiz immortality, set to edge ahead in their final group game of a team that had beaten them 7-0 in their first.\nBut wait. What was this? More madness. Germany equalised! 2-2. Where are we? Is this really the Place Vend\u00f4me? Kai Havertz had equalised. There were 17 minutes to go at this stage. How many more worlds, how many alternate universes would we need to absorb?\n\nGroup E has been a weird kind of torture for Germany. This was something new, five goals, a wild inversion of emotions and a mutual assured footballing destruction, with both teams here now going out. Niclas F\u00fcllkrug had already been summoned to add muscle and vibes to Germany\u2019s attack. The sublime Jamal Musiala twice hit a post, playing a different game for a different Germany team.\n\nHavertz made it 3-2. Pointlessly Germany got to their two-goal cushion, F\u00fcllkrug scoring after a wild, hallucinogenic VAR delay during which the stadium seemed to melt and ooze through the floor. Germany had done Spain a solid here by seeing off the surging Ticos. Any chance of returning the favour?\nIt wasn\u2019t to be. All four teams had entered this final round able to go through or go out. All four had revolved like a formal dance over 90 minutes. This was World Cup group final match day as free\u2011form jazz flute solo , and a great advert for the four-team format just as Fifa contemplates tearing it up to inflict pre-match penalty shootouts and other three-team inanity for the next bloated edition.\nAt kick-off Germany needed to win and hope Spain beat Japan. Costa Rica needed to win and hope Japan beat Spain. Or Germany could just say hang it all and try to win 9-0. Flick did go for broke in a way, with Thomas M\u00fcller starting ahead of Musiala plus the twin man-bun speedsters Leroy San\u00e9 and Serge Gnabry.\n\nAnd Al Bayt felt like a fitting last-chance saloon, a stadium with an air of the one-horse desert town, the clock ticking around closer to midnight. Musiala was sublime early on, coming on like a miraculous human pond-skater, gliding through the red shirts, making the game throb and buzz with possibilities.\nThe opening goal came from his side, David Raum crossing for Gnabry to head in. Spain had also gone one up against Japan. For a while nothing much happened. Al Bayt waited, awkwardly for time to pass. It came in a rush.\nAt the end a dejected Flick spoke about the need to spend the next 10 years overhauling the youth system (hasn\u2019t this happened?). Something will have to change, because this is now the worst German World Cup era in the history of German World Cup eras. West or unified, Germany have failed to get out of a first-round stage only twice in 16 men\u2019s World Cups. This one and the last one.\n\nHas there been a greater recent footballing chimera than that 2014 triumph, which was hailed at the time as the birth of some German machine-football uber-generation all set to dominate for the next decade. Germany\u2019s golden crop, Das (borrowed, Spanish) Reboot has turned out to be something else. So often what we see as just the start of an era is instead its high point, the wave not gathering strength but breaking. For all Flick\u2019s urgent talk of starting again, this felt like the end of something."

Grealish had promised Finlay Fisher he would perform the shoulder waggle celebration after the 12-year-old wrote to him upon learning that the player\u2019s sister Holly also has cerebral palsy. True to his word, the Manchester City forward pulled out the dance after scoring the sixth goal in England\u2019s 6-2 win against Iran at the World Cup in Qatar on Monday. Speaking after the match, Grealish said: \u201cFor me, it\u2019s just doing a celebration but for him that\u2019ll mean the world to him, I\u2019m sure. So Finlay \u2013 that one\u2019s for you.\u201d  Finlay said he was amazed to see his idol perform the move as he watched from his living room in Manchester. \u201cIt feels like a dream come true, I can\u2019t say how happy I am. I\u2019ve still not got over it yet,\u201d he told BBC Breakfast on Tuesday. He said speaking with Grealish the week before had been like \u201clike meeting Superman\u201d. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it, I was star-struck,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you meet your idol, it\u2019s like meeting Superman or Batman, you can\u2019t imagine it. He wanted to come and see me in his spare time, so I really want to thank him for that.\u201d However, Finlay almost did not get to watch the match at all. He had spent two hours in hospital after hurting his leg in a fall in the morning. The game started just 10 minutes after he returned home. \u201cI hurt my leg in the morning, and I had to sit in A&amp;E for two hours, and I was like: \u2018C\u2019mon let me out, let me out,\u2019\u201d he told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain. The avid Man City fan said \u201cit really made me happy\u201d when he met Grealish after writing to him earlier this year. Finlay said he had been inspired by the footballer speaking about his love for his younger sister, Hollie, who has cerebral palsy. \u201cI think he\u2019s very inspirational,\u201d Finlay told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cBecause he\u2019s lived with people he knows what it\u2019s like so he gets his message across. I think he supports me and makes me grow confidence so I hope he does that to other people as well.\u201d The schoolboy said he had named the celebration \u201cthe Finlay\u201d and that he felt he was now \u201cbest friends\u201d with the Premier League\u2019s most expensive footballer. And if Grealish thinks he can retire the dance, he may need to think again. Finlay urged him to do it each time he scores: \u201cThat must be his signature celebration!\u201d"

                    "body": "Not since 2003 has MLS Cup been contested between two No 1 seeds. The Major League Soccer playoffs almost always produce shocks, but Saturday\u2019s showpiece between Los Angeles FC and the Philadelphia Union was predicted by many to materialise. If LAFC have been the unstoppable force in 2022, Philly have been the immovable object. In terms of quality, the 2022 MLS Cup final has the potential to be the best ever. Steve Cherundolo and Jim Curtin are probably the best two head coaches in MLS too. LAFC and Philly will have plenty of star power to showcase down the road from Hollywood this weekend, but the men on the touchline deserve top billing \u2013 they are the reason their teams have made it this far. In Curtin\u2019s case, that is certainly true. The Philadelphia Union have the second-lowest wage bill ($10.36m) in MLS, but that hasn\u2019t stopped them from becoming an Eastern Conference superpower \u2013 Philly won the Supporters\u2019 Shield in 2020 and made the conference final last season as second seeds. That success has earned Curtin a reputation as one of the sharpest tacticians working in the American game.  Philly could, and perhaps should, have won the Supporters\u2019 Shield this year too, only losing out to LAFC on number of wins when almost every other league in the world uses goal difference as a tiebreaker. The Union, not LAFC, may well be MLS\u2019s most complete team having finished the regular season with the best attacking and defensive record. The eight years of Curtin\u2019s Philadelphia Union tenure haven\u2019t all been as successful as the last few. In fact, the 43-year-old insists he was close to being fired as recently as 2018 when Philly won just two of nine fixtures to open the season. Had they lost to Montreal in a match in May of that year, Curtin might not have lasted. \u201cI bet money if I lost that game, I was fired. You could feel it,\u201d he said. The Union won, however, and Curtin is now the second longest-serving MLS manager.  Victory on Saturday would be the culmination of Curtin\u2019s time as Philadelphia Union head coach, the end point of a long process that has turned Philly into a ferocious high-pressing, high-energy outfit capable of running through opponents at will. However, these traits are also shared by Los Angeles FC who are similarly reflective of their head coach. Compared to that of Curtin, Cherundolo\u2019s managerial path has been short, reaching MLS Cup in his first season as LAFC coach. Unlike Curtin, the USMNT defender inherited a squad with the talent to compete, but his appointment at the start of the year came amid challenging circumstances. Many expected a rebuild after the apparent end of a cycle under Bob Bradley. Rather than rebuilding Bradley\u2019s team, though, Cherundolo revitalised it. He opted for evolution over revolution, retaining much of the tactical framework that had made LAFC so successful for so long. This was coupled with a shrewd approach to recruitment from general manager John Thorrington who brought in proven MLS performers (like Kellyn Acosta) at the start of the year to provide a solid foundation and added to it with star names (like Gareth Bale and Giorgio Chiellini) signed in the summer. \u201cIf you look at the style and the success that LAFC had in the first four years, it was great,\u201d Cherundolo said. \u201cI think I would be pretty naive to try to change all that.\u201d Bradley\u2019s fingerprints are still all over this team, but Cherundolo\u2019s pragmatism was exactly what the club needed to move forward again.  Neither Cherundolo\u2019s nor Curtin\u2019s reputation will be made or broken by what happens at Banc of California Stadium on Saturday, but glory for either of them will be emblematic of a new, rising generation of American soccer coaches. The USMNT\u2019s current crop of players is the strongest the country has ever produced and the same could be said of its managers. It\u2019s not just Cherundolo and Curtin who make up this new generation. Josh Wolff has caught the eye, taking Austin FC from second-bottom of the West to the conference final in the space of just 12 months, while Pat Noonan has turned FC Cincinnati from Wooden Spoon winners into playoff threats in the same timeframe. LA Galaxy\u2019s Greg Vanney has also achieved a lot in MLS for a manager who is still only 48. These names would almost certainly be mentioned as potential USA head coaches should the 2022 World Cup go badly for Gregg Berhalter and his team. Berhalter is already under pressure with many fans fearful of a disappointing showing in Qatar. It\u2019s not beyond the realms of possibility that a change could happen after the World Cup and the sight of Cherundolo or Curtin lifting MLS Cup this weekend might provide some comfort that the future of American soccer may well still be in good hands."

                    "body": "Certain things in rugby union never seem to change. Australia have not hoisted the Bledisloe Cup since 2003 and their breathless 39-37 defeat by New Zealand in Melbourne on Thursday has extended that sequence. The difference on this occasion was the unique manner victory was ripped from the Wallabies\u2019 grasp, courtesy of one of the more dramatic refereeing interventions in the history of the fixture.  Leading by three points with a penalty kick to touch from close to their own line, any team in the world would have taken their time and checked whether their bootlaces were securely tied. On this occasion, though, the time bandits were rumbled. Having awarded Australia a turnover penalty with the game clock showing 78 minutes and 25 seconds, the French referee, Mathieu Raynal, changed his mind and gave a New Zealand scrum with the timer by now showing 79:04. Is 39 seconds an unreasonable delay? Could Monsieur Raynal have not simply added on a little more time rather than taking the nuclear option, from which the All Blacks duly scored through Jordie Barrett in the right corner? Even the similarly initialled John Buchan\u2019s The Thirty-Nine Steps could not match this late twist. Or, as the Australian captain, James Slipper, put it: \u201cThat was probably the most gutting way to finish a game.\u201d Of course World Rugby wants to speed up the game. Raynal had shouted \u201cWe play\u201d on a couple of occasions as Bernard Foley waited for his pack to break from their tactical huddle behind him. The New Zealand coach, Ian Foster, called it \u201cclear-cut\u201d. Either way it felt mighty harsh in the context of Australia\u2019s fine fightback from 31-13 down and has set a major precedent.  It also obscured the fact that the All Blacks remain distinctly mortal. Yes, they sneaked it at the last. But the majority of their points came when the Wallabies were reduced to 13 or 14 men and at no stage did the All Blacks look remotely back at the peak of their powers. Instead it was a flawed, fluctuating match to give the national coaches of Ireland, England, Wales or even Scotland further encouragement about what the next 13 months might hold. Did either side look more organised than Ireland, more powerful than France, have a better lineout than England or seem as defensively inspired as Wales were on tour in South Africa? Even with a numerical advantage, the All Blacks often huffed and puffed and only the sharp instincts of Richie Mo\u2019unga and Will Jordan ultimately bailed them out. Clearly there is still time to tinker selection wise but it is in the crucial areas of tactical nous and clear thinking that New Zealand, once past masters at both, are currently diminished. Even the second-half try scored by the eager Samisoni Taukei\u2019aho showcased some average decision-making, the hooker ignoring numerous extra men outside him. The rationale behind Hoskins Sotutu kicking ahead with the Wallaby cover stretched and, again, support runners at his elbow was equally curious. Australia will be massively disappointed, consequently, to have let their visitors off the hook. The powerful Rob Valetini, the tireless Pete Samu and the returning Foley all deserved to be in the winners\u2019 enclosure at Marvel Stadium and the craft of Foley at 10 made a notable difference to the variety of their attack. With Michael Hooper, Quade Cooper, Hunter Paisami, Will Skelton, Rory Arnold among those still potentially available to Dave Rennie next year, there is clear potential for further improvement. First, though, they have to start taking a higher percentage of their chances. Andrew Kellaway contributed a lovely second-half try but his failure to ground the ball after a slick first-half move was to prove extremely costly. Darcy Swain also needs to calm down if he wants to prolong his international career. Sent off for butting England\u2019s Jonny Hill in July, he appeared to target the braced lower leg of Quinn Tupaea in a maul in a manner that looked far more dangerous. There will also be fresh concern in New Zealand about their battered captain, Sam Cane, who has a history of concussions and failed another head injury assessment. The All Blacks got lucky on this occasion but a potentially tough European autumn still awaits."

                    "body": "Ten days. That\u2019s how long it has been since Australia played Argentina in the World Cup\u2019s last 16; a week and a half since Garang Kuol came within a whisker of sending the game into extra-time. Now, Lionel Messi and co are bound for a World Cup final, while Australian football has descended into a resentful civil war that is threatening to irreparably sever the relationship between the A-Leagues and its most devoted supporters.  Two days on from the initial announcement, the furore surrounding the Australian Professional Leagues\u2019 (APL) move to sell hosting rights for the next three men\u2019s and women\u2019s grand finals to Sydney shows no signs of abating. If anything, it\u2019s getting worse.  Supporters\u2019 rage at the decision appears to have become self-sustaining, an ouroboros of loathing that only grows bigger with every passing moment the NSW commitment remains. Boycotts and mass walkouts are planned this weekend. Players such as Craig Goodwin, Remy Siemsen and Jason Davidson have taken to social media to disavow the move. And some clubs have released their own statements distancing themselves from the decision-making process. Despite the vote on the partnership reportedly being unanimous, Melbourne Victory chairman Anthony Di Pietro has resigned as one of the APL board\u2019s directors, and his name was notably absent on a late-night statement released by the APL on Tuesday which doubled down on the decision. At least it was until it was yanked off Facebook and reposted without the names of the 11 other club representatives. It\u2019s beyond parody. Even before Socceroos squad members began to return home from their history-making stint in Doha, sardonic jokes were flying \u2013 just how would the local game mess this up? That\u2019s the well-earned cynicism of Australian football. But not even the most jaded would have anticipated it would take just over a week for a self-inflicted existential crisis to materialise. While it is easy to dismiss the ongoing rancour as just the latest example of Australian football eating itself, it increasingly appears that this is the latest front in the increasingly bitter ideological conflict between fans and administrators over what matters in modern sport, and what\u2019s worth sacrificing. Beyond the discontent surrounding a grand final, it has become a moment of class consciousness among those who provide the passion and atmosphere, in opposition to those who lay claim to its ownership. Even if the decision was reversed today, anger would likely remain; fans rebelling against those they now believe see them not as partners but as cash registers whose concerns can be discounted when the dollars add up. This is about more than a grand final now. It\u2019s about trust, connection and a feeling that supporters don\u2019t matter at all. How the A-Leagues come back from this, if they even can, is difficult to imagine. The indignation of the past days has been driven almost entirely by a sea of collective fans, and there are no definitive leaders to target or schmooze to ease tensions. The media is not driving the conversation so much as being observers holding on for dear life.  Backtracking by the APL seems impossible: the NSW government will not let them out of their contract and, even if they did, the reputational damage of such a move would likely adversely impact any future hopes of securing government funding. There is also a level of belief that their concept, a week-long \u201cfestival of football\u201d (details of which are still scarce), is what the game needs to grow. And that\u2019s to say nothing of the eight figures over three years \u2013 it costs money to run a league these days. It\u2019s a crisis. But this is also modern football, where commercial considerations, investment vehicles, data lakes and other words you would find on LinkedIn have become just as integral in the game as joga bonito. When Lionel Messi steps out into Lusail Stadium in the early hours of the Australian morning on Monday, he will be doing so in a World Cup sold to the highest bidder, in the last final before the tournament swells to 48 teams and becomes even more profitable. He will then return to a Paris Saint Germain side which is effectively owned by Qatar, and take part in a Champions League that will expand from 32 to 36 teams in 2024 \u2013 which itself was a response to the not-yet-dead attempts to establish a European Super League. Now, it appears Australian football is having its own modern moment. Just what is the value of a dollar?"

                    "body": "When Rob Page announces his Wales squad for their first World Cup in 64 years on Wednesday, he will return to an old haunt for something of a trip down memory lane. Back to Tylorstown Miners\u2019 Welfare Hall, the last surviving one in the Rhondda valley, which this week was home to a Welsh wrestling extravaganza and last month held a Tom Jones and Tina Turner tribute act. Page smiles when informed the comedian Owen Money will take centre stage a few days after him. \u201cIt was my old snooker hall,\u201d he says. \u201cBefore I moved away at 16 [to play for Watford] I\u2019d go in, not through the big doors in the middle but to the left, down into the cellar and there was a little cubby hole where you\u2019d get your tray of balls. I was not exactly Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan.\u201d The magnitude of leading Wales at a World Cup is not lost on Page, who won 41 caps, and Rhondda council closing roads to enable satellite trucks to broadcast the event live across the country underlines that the tournament is big deal to a small community of about 4,000 and far beyond. Page has family dotted around the valleys \u2013 from Ferndale to Penygraig \u2013 and fond memories of playing kick-a-can in the street and representing Tylorstown Boys Club, which his father helped run. \u201cMy mother helped wash the kits every Sunday \u2013 you\u2019d see them out on the washing line. White top, claret socks, claret shorts \u2026 if a claret sock went in with the white jerseys, you\u2019d be playing in pink the following week.\u201d  In those days there was no football pitch in Tylorstown so home matches were in nearby Maerdy, the last coal-mining pit in the Rhondda to close. \u201cMy dad would have to drive round and knock some of the lads out of bed because they\u2019d slept in. It used to take us an hour just to get to Maerdy, which should have been 20 minutes. You\u2019d see the wind and the rain driving down the valley and you\u2019re freezing cold, but you\u2019re playing because you absolutely love it.\u201d A centre-half\u2019s dream, then? \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a winger\u2019s pitch, let me tell you,\u201d he says with a smile. \u201cYou\u2019d be ankle-deep in mud. Great memories. It shapes you and I thought: \u2018Do you know what? If I can make a career out of this then I\u2019m going to throw everything into it.\u2019\u201d So was it always football for Page? \u201cMy PE teacher in forms one and two, Warren Evans, was a fanatical football fan and so he used to just throw us a football and we\u2019d go play in the Darran Park for an hour. That was our lesson. Brilliant. Kelvin Wigley, a PE teacher I then had in Maerdy, was [focused on] rugby so I didn\u2019t kick a football in forms three and four \u2013 it was all rugby. I played a couple of games. I was full-back, centre \u2013 anywhere other than in the front row.\u201d Page did, in effect, have a front-row seat when Michael Sheen visited his squad in September after the actor\u2019s rousing speech on A League of Their Own. Sheen, who was presented with a Wales shirt by Gareth Bale, adapted his original speech, which went viral, and had the players in the palm of his hand. \u201cI said to him: \u2018It\u2019s taken me two years to make a nation cry and it took him two minutes and 40 seconds,\u2019\u201d Page says, laughing.  \u201cIt was incredible. The part that got me was when he said: \u2018Feel the breath on the back of your necks, because that\u2019s every man, woman and child from back home supporting you\u2019 \u2026 We\u2019ve invited him to come out [to Qatar] and be part of it. Wherever he\u2019ll be, he\u2019ll definitely be supporting us.\u201d Sheen is not the only performer to inspire Wales of late. The folk singer Dafydd Iwan sang Yma O Hyd before and after Wales\u2019s nervy playoff final victory over Ukraine in June, second time around with the help of Bale and his teammates. \u201cI have it on my phone, all my kids have got it and every now and then we\u2019ll sit together in the car going somewhere and blast it,\u201d Page says of Wales\u2019s World Cup anthem, though he was missing from the mass sing-song on the pitch. \u201cYou won\u2019t see me in any of the pictures because I just took a step back and just took it all in,\u201d he says.  Was he choked up? \u201cUmm, yeah,\u201d he says, eyes watering. \u201cAnd I was really proud as well, yeah. It was like a carnival. I was just so pleased, and relieved. There was a lot of emotion that we had to hold in that week. The last 15 minutes were just incredible; the stress and the pressure \u2013 \u2018Come on, boys: just hang on\u2019 \u2013 and Wayne [Hennessey] in particular that day gave an incredible performance to help us achieve it. The players showed their true class at the end because they went straight over to show their appreciation to the Ukraine supporters, and rightly so.\u201d The last manager to lead Wales at a World Cup, Jimmy Murphy, ended up with a blue plaque at 43 Treharne Street, his old house in Pentre, about three miles from where Page grew up, and there is another degree of symmetry in that Wales\u2019s first game in Qatar is against the USA, the opponents for Page\u2019s first game in interim charge in November 2020. In 1958 Wales exited at the quarter-finals courtesy of a Pel\u00e9 goal and Page is adamant they can reach the knockout stages. \u201cWe\u2019re not just going out there to make the numbers up,\u201d he says.  Last week Page and his staff spent two days sifting through clips of Iran, USA and England, their final Group B opponents. What would success in Doha look like? \u201cWe\u2019re a country of three million people, so when you strip it all away, what the boys have achieved is incredible. But when you\u2019re there, you\u2019re greedy.\u201d Wales have qualified for three of the past four major tournaments and it is a ride fans will not want to get off in a hurry. \u201cEuro 2016 set the wheels in motion. The connection with the supporters doesn\u2019t just come because you wear a bucket hat, because you wear an old jersey or because you sing a couple of songs \u2026 you\u2019ve got to win games of football as well. I\u2019ve got friends in England that enjoy watching Wales play, and I\u2019m not going to name names \u2026 they really enjoy it.\u201d  Wales\u2019s head of medical, Sean Connelly, has visited Los Angeles FC and Nice to keep tabs on the fitness of Bale and Aaron Ramsey respectively but Page is not bothered that others are playing in League Two. \u201cJonny Williams is just as important to that group as what Gareth Bale is, and that\u2019s why I continue to select him. He is first class. Along with Chris Gunter. These lads have created this environment.\u201d How different is the Wales setup compared with when Page played? \u201cChalk and cheese,\u201d he says in a room adjacent to the gym at Wales\u2019s impressive base. \u201cWe\u2019d have to borrow training grounds, park pitches, whatever pitches we could get our hands on really, sometimes in England. I remember training abroad and Carl Robinson went over on his ankle while we were trying to do some team shape because of a raised drain that was two inches high. In the meantime, we\u2019ve taken every excuse away from the players. We have to compete with the likes of LA, Nice and Spurs, because if we offer anything less than that, they\u2019ll pull you up on it.\u201d  Page, who lives in Sheffield, previously managed Port Vale and Northampton but leading a nation brings a different spotlight. It also means it is harder to keep a low profile. \u201cI took my kids to Cyprus for a week and I landed in Paphos airport and went to get the bags and realised on the screen that I was being joined by a flight from Cardiff,\u201d he says. \u201cMy son nudged me and went: \u2018Dad, do you think you\u2019ll be recognised?\u2019 I said: \u2018Nah, probably not.\u2019 Within seconds, a Cardiff City supporter recognised me and word got round so a few more wanted to come and have a photo. It\u2019s a bit surreal at times as well because you\u2019re still pinching yourself. When people come up to me thanking me, I\u2019m going: \u2018What are you thanking me for?\u2019\u201d"

                    "body": "It\u2019s been another big year for women\u2019s cricket (is there ever a quiet one, these days?) It began with an Ashes series and a 50-over World Cup in New Zealand, but the highlight was surely a maiden appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham. Only two Tests were played, though, so this team is an all-format XI \u2013 with a slight bias towards Test performances. That perhaps reflects The Spin\u2019s Christmas wish to see more multi-day cricket for women in 2023, please! 1) Alyssa Healy (Australia) She loves a World Cup final (see also the MCG in March 2020) and England had no answers for Healy\u2019s ridiculously good 170 at Christchurch in April. The highest individual score in any World Cup final (women\u2019s or men\u2019s), it was not just the innings of the year but one of the best of all-time. The rest of 2022 was leaner for Healy than she might have liked, but after her record 509-run haul at the World Cup she\u2019s a no-brainer for inclusion in this team. 2) Beth Mooney (Australia) Remember Mooney breaking her jaw two weeks before the Ashes and having to have emergency surgery? No? That\u2019s because she played anyway \u2013 and hit two half-centuries. She also averaged 101 in ODIs in 2022 (yes, you read that correctly), and top-scored with 61 in the final of the Commonwealth Games. Just call her women\u2019s cricket\u2019s Lara Croft.  3) Alice Capsey (England) Finally made her international debt in July, aged just 17, by which time her brilliance was probably the worst-kept secret in English cricket. Sealed the deal with a 37-ball half-century against South Africa in only her fourth match for England, becoming the first teenager to achieve the feat since Sarah Taylor. England will be desperate for her to recover from shoulder surgery in time for the World Cup in February. 4) Nat Sciver (England) Enjoyed a phenomenal year with bat in hand, bookending the World Cup with two centuries against Australia, and scoring an unbeaten 169 in the Test against South Africa. Despite missing the entire India series she still managed to break the record for most ODI runs scored by an English woman in a calendar year (833). She is also a handy first-change bowler, taking 22 wickets across all formats in 2022. Just don\u2019t try to force her to captain, she\u2019s got enough to do already! 5) Harmanpreet Kaur (India), captain The Spin\u2019s choice of skipper for our team of the year led an India side which exceeded expectations by winning silver at the Commonwealth Games, and then securing a historic 3-0 ODI win away from home against England in September. Also inflicted Australia\u2019s only defeat of the year in Mumbai in December, courtesy of a super over. Remains a potent danger with the bat \u2013 her 143 not out at Canterbury was a mammoth onslaught which had more than a few shades of Derby 2017. 6) Amelia Kerr (New Zealand) After stepping away from cricket to focus on her mental health in mid-2021, Kerr came roaring back to her best in New Zealand\u2019s ODI series against India at the start of 2022, hitting three half-centuries and an unbeaten 119 as the hosts walloped their opponents. Continues to possess the most effective googly in the world, bar none.  7) Tahlia McGrath (Australia) There are meteoric rises and then there is the career of McGrath. After clawing her way back into the Australia team at the end of 2021, it took the all-rounder only 14 months to reach the top of the ICC\u2019s T20 batting rankings. She was central to her side\u2019s Commonwealth Games triumph, despite contracting Covid before the final. The decision to appoint her vice-captain in November shows just how highly regarded she has become. 8) Marizanne Kapp (South Africa) Would probably have earned her spot purely for her magnificent 150 against England in the one-off Test at Taunton in June \u2013 an astonishing innings given it was Kapp\u2019s (and South Africa\u2019s) first Test since November 2014. Add to the tally a maiden five-wicket haul against England in the World Cup, and an unbeaten 37 off 33 balls in the final of the Hundred to help Oval Invincibles retain their title. The Spin would rather cower in a corner than go up against Kapp in a fight.  9) Sophie Ecclestone (England) \u201cBecause she\u2019s been around a long time and been so consistent, you sometimes forget how good she is and what she\u2019s achieved \u2013 you almost take it a bit for granted.\u201d Heather Knight spoke for all of us when she summed up Ecclestone\u2019s contribution to England in 2022, after she broke the record for most wickets taken by a woman in a calendar year (final tally: 56). She also took six for 36 in the World Cup semi-final against South Africa, made some handy contributions with the bat and was temporarily elevated to the England vice-captaincy during a memorable year. Not a bad set of achievements. 10) Jess Kerr (New Zealand) She may have taken fewer wickets than some, but if you look across all bowling metrics in 2022, the older Kerr sister comes out right at the top \u2013 a reward for economy, consistency and Frank Sinatra levels of swing. Missed the Commonwealth Games due to a foot injury, but had a decent Big Bash for Brisbane Heat after she stepped in as cover for first Danni Wyatt and then Pooja Vastrakar. 11) Renuka Singh Thakur (India) The 26-year-old quick bowler announced herself on the world stage in stunning fashion in the opening match of the Commonwealth Games, single-handedly reducing Australia to 34 for four in a bewitching display of seam movement which did for Healy, Mooney, McGrath and Meg Lanning. Jhulan Goswami may have retired in 2022 but the future of Indian pace bowling is secure in Thakur\u2019s hands. This is an extract from the Guardian\u2019s weekly cricket email, The Spin.

                    "body": "American TV viewers were treated to the pop-cultural equivalent of Gegenpressing in the leadup to Friday\u2019s postcolonial grudge match between the USA and England: whenever a semblance of coherence materialised in Fox Sports\u2019s preview of the match, it was quickly shut down. In the 10 minutes before kickoff, members of the Fox \u201cteam\u201d asserted, variously, that \u201cit all circles around Harry Kane\u201d (does it?), that America is \u201cused to being the biggest, the baddest, and the best in everything\u201d (tell that to the tennis players of Europe or India\u2019s cricketers), and that \u201cyou\u2019re going to see this US team playing aggressively, stepping in the English players\u2019 faces\u201d (seems bookable). George Washington and the American Revolution scored a mention over footage of midfielders performing pre-match squats. On the field, a match eventually took shape, with America\u2019s players executing something close to Fox\u2019s on-air strategy of confusion and harassment, only with much more pleasing results. For much of the match, the USA were consistently faster to the ball, playing with an urgency and an incision that made England look lumbering and befuddled. Despite their dominance, however, America once again paid for their lack of decisiveness in the final third \u2013 a story that has become depressingly familiar for a team that is at last threatening to make good on its immense promise. An acute awareness of their finishing difficulties seemed to accompany the USA players on to the pitch at Al Bayt Stadium. As this oddly hysterical stalemate ticked past the hour mark, America\u2019s on-field brains trust \u2013 Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie and Walker Zimmerman \u2013 gathered by the corner flag for a brief strategy meeting. England had just conceded their sixth corner of the night. Pulisic\u2019s set-piece delivery, so woeful in the USMNT\u2019s World Cup opener, had been routinely excellent in this match, with only one problem: there was never anyone in the penalty area to meet the ball after it cleared the first English defender. On the fly, the USA\u2019s key trio devised a plan for how to shackle England\u2019s defenders and create space for an American opening in front of goal.  Pulisic\u2019s corner arced across the clump of English players, beyond the reach of Jordan Pickford, and toward the vacant far post. Zimmerman arrived \u2013 but around two seconds too late. The pattern of the match \u2013 in which the USA carved England\u2019s midfield apart at will, creating chance after chance from wide areas that no American player was on hand to convert \u2013 was confirmed. A battling, courageous effort only confirmed what many have long suspected about this vintage of the USMNT: it remains a team in search of a striker. Midfield control, speed on the flanks, balls spraying across the box, England on the rack, and no goals: such was the story of this match for the USA. In midfield and out wide, this team boasts a cleverness that the more agricultural American outfits of years past lacked. Much of America\u2019s joy in this match came down the right side, with Sergi\u00f1o Dest and Tim Weah providing the kind of buccaneering thrust that England so clearly missed, while on the other flank Pulisic had perhaps his best match in national colours, hitting the crossbar once and repeatedly skipping away from defenders with the graceful commitment of a New York subway rider beating the closing doors. For once all the dreary, incessant insistence of American fans that Pulisic is a generational talent that three successive Chelsea managers have miraculously conspired to shackle seemed justified.  A match of half-chances cried out for a ruthless finisher to settle the affair but if England\u2019s misfortune was that Harry Kane spent most of the game bailing out his back four, America\u2019s was that its own frontman was mostly invisible. Gregg Berhalter dropped Norwich City\u2019s Josh Sargent, a largely peripheral figure in the 1-1 draw against Wales, and elevated Haji Wright to his starting lineup. But the 6ft 3in target man \u2013 a former youth international who appeared in the same under-17 side as many of this team\u2019s most important players \u2013 struggled to impose himself on proceedings, an early header that flashed just wide of the upright representing his most telling contribution. At times Wright combined well with Dest and Weah but these interventions felt emptily decorative; it says everything about his absence in front of goal that the USA\u2019s two best scoring opportunities fell to Pulisic and McKennie. The lack of a reliable finisher creates a real problem for Berhalter for a must-win encounter against Iran. It also represents something of a historical anomaly: in every other World Cup played this century the USA\u2019s biggest outfield stars were its forwards \u2013 players of the caliber of Landon Donovan and Clint Dempsey, now ensconced as pundits on the Fox Sport set on Doha\u2019s waterfront. If anything those earlier teams were over-reliant on their forwards and let down by a certain stodginess in the middle of the pitch. Now the opposite dilemma holds: this USA team is loaded with skilled midfielders and creates a torrent of chances but has no one to put them away. Berhalter may now turn to the remaining striker in his squad, but it\u2019s doubtful that FC Dallas\u2019s Jes\u00fas Ferreira will succeed where Sargent and Wright have not. Despite the pre-match optimism of Fox Sports\u2019s revolutionary war historians, the USA will have to wait until Qatar holds its next World Cup before it can complete the Bunker Hill-Al Bayt double over England. Until then, America\u2019s search for a No 9 goes on."

                    "body": "Gregg Berhalter knows all about the magnified importance of fine margins in the World Cup. As a US defender he was denied an equalizer in the quarter-finals of the 2002 World Cup when a handball on the line by Germany\u2019s Torsten Frings went unpenalized. The US lost 1-0.\nIf Iran had shown more composure in the box on Tuesday they might have pinched the point they needed to finish above the US, and instead of looking forward to a round-of-16 tie against the Netherlands on Saturday the American head coach would have faced an uncertain future.\nBut tallies of heart-in-mouth moments, total time spent watching through fingers and length of bitten fingernails aren\u2019t statistics that count in the official standings, so what matters is that the US finished second in Group B behind England. Right where their talent level suggested they should be.\n\nAs a result, Berhalter\u2019s almost certainly earned some long-term job security. Barring a change to standard practice, as co-hosts the US will not brush up against the potential tripwire of a Concacaf qualifying campaign, so he\u2019s likely still to be in charge for the 2026 tournament, when many of the fast-improving current team should be at their peak.\nFairly or not, this, Berhalter\u2019s 59th match in charge, was a referendum on his entire tenure. And he won. Faster, stronger, smarter and more skillful than their opponents, a program on a perpetual quest for respect, a nation that didn\u2019t even qualify for the finals four years ago, is in the World Cup\u2019s last 16.\nIt\u2019s what the US expected and what the coach needed; risky business, being in charge of the most talented group of footballers your country has ever produced. Finishing below Wales and Iran would not have been a good look.\nThey\u2019ve achieved the minimum while enacting Berhalter\u2019s grand vision: youth, energy and a high-pressing possession-based style that, without too much suspension of disbelief, could make you believe you\u2019re watching one of the better sides in the world.\nSure, it\u2019s fitful and some faults are still obvious, most notably the lack of goalscoring threat at striker. This is a team of purple patches and gray areas. Injuries to Christian Pulisic and Josh Sargent and Weston McKennie\u2019s fitness are concerns ahead of the clash with the Netherlands, though even at full strength the US would be underdogs. Some of Berhalter\u2019s substitutions are puzzling.\nBut if we\u2019re going to play \u201cwhat if?\u201d from the Iranian perspective, we can do it from the American view, too: what if Tim Weah\u2019s knee hadn\u2019t been offside as he ran clear and finished with aplomb at the end of the first half? The second period would have been far more tranquil with the two-goal advantage that was the least the Americans\u2019 superiority merited.\nAfter an offbeat build-up featuring a Gio Reyna conspiracy theory, a social media stunt and questions about his influence on US foreign policy, it barely registered on the weird-o-meter that Berhalter dropped Walker Zimmerman, a trusted starter at center-back for more than a year, in favor of the far less experienced Cameron Carter-Vickers.\n\nWith his job on the line, against a nation with the oldest roster in Qatar, and without a win in his past five matches, Berhalter \u2013 boss of the second-youngest squad in the tournament \u2013 picked his youngest line-up of the three group games.\nNo one is accusing the coach of hidebound loyalty to \u201chis guys\u201d any longer; it turns out that he is willing to mix-and-match his players as well as his sneakers. The switch, coming after Zimmerman played well in a hugely creditable goalless draw with England, was another example of the ruthless streak Berhalter demonstrated by culling goalkeeper Zack Steffen and forward Ricardo Pepi when he named his 26-man tournament roster.\nThe risk of pairing Carter-Vickers with Tim Ream for the first time paid off. Both impressed \u2013 the physical 24-year-old and the bearded veteran with the appearance of a lumberjack and the anticipation of a chess grandmaster.\nUp front, Sargent, restored to the starting XI, was a valuable, busy contributor until injury struck \u2013 albeit mainly with his back to goal. When the time came to shelter from the storm late on, Berhalter brought on Shaq Moore, a right-back who hardly featured during Concacaf qualifying, rather than DeAndre Yedlin, the only player on the roster with World Cup experience from a prior finals. That was a gamble that paid fewer dividends.\nThe overall pattern of play was similar to the Americans\u2019 opening game against Wales: first-half dominance yielding only one goal, making for an anxious second period as cautious and limited opponents left their bunker in search of an equalizer. The difference here was that the US did not make a decisive error.\n\nStill, US goalkeeper Matt Turner did not need to make a save until the last 10 minutes, and the team showed it could cope without its talisman after the goalscorer, Pulisic, went off injured at the break.\nEntering the tournament Berhalter needed to resolve personnel issues, such as who to play at striker and center-back. But the key question was more fundamental, and perhaps substantially beyond his control: would pressure make this band of World Cup novices shrivel or grow? Now we know.\nAs another high-profile American manager put it: \u201cThat\u2019s a big game, man\u2026 They did it, God love \u2018em.\u201d Berhalter, much doubted and debated, has earned the right not to be second-guessed \u2013 at least until the weekend."

                    "body": "\n\nThe main event\nGermany\u2019s shock defeat to Japan was a strange game to parse. Hansi Flick\u2019s men were probably the better side during the first half \u2013 they had the lion\u2019s share of possession and chances \u2013 and yet Daizen Maeda would have given the Japanese an early lead from an onside position had he showed just a modicum of patience, then very nearly equalised Ilkay G\u00fcndogan\u2019s 31st-minute penalty with a header that sailed inches wide on the stroke of half-time.\nThe second half was similarly \u2013 that is to say strangely \u2013 all over the place. At one point Jamal Musiala almost replicated Ricky Villa\u2019s famous slalom at the 1981 FA Cup final replay; at another, Shuichi Gonda in the Japanese goal was forced to make four big saves in not many more seconds. But then Japan swapped out a few men, shoogled things around, and came at their opponents in a manner that would make a banzai charge look like a polite request for the vicar to pass the cucumber sandwiches. Germany froze, Japan scored twice, could easily have had another couple, and now the 2014 champions are on the precipice of a second group-stage exit in a row.\n\nA total debacle for one of the pre-tournament favourites, though it\u2019s not as though Germany simply failed to turn up, or that they\u2019re flat out rotten. It\u2019s the unpredictability that\u2019s killing them. The game against England in September illustrated their problems in microcosm. A nondescript first half was followed by 25 minutes of old-time strutting exuberance, which in turn was superseded by a farcical defensive collapse. A late equaliser scrambled a 3-3 draw, and nobody should be surprised by the way things have got out of hand so quickly in Qatar. It was all there in plain sight at Wembley.\nGermany now need a result against Spain. With Musiala, G\u00fcndogan and Serge Gnabry in fine fettle, and Leroy San\u00e9 hopefully back from injury, there\u2019s no reason why they can\u2019t get one. On the other hand, the last time the teams met, a year ago in the Nations League, Spain won 6-0. The Germans haven\u2019t beaten the Spanish at a tournament since 1988, when La Furia Roja were slap-bang in the middle of their 44-year phase of almost supernatural underachievement. Spain shook that monkey off their back with a symbolic victory over Germany in the final of Euro 2008, then put Die Mannschaft out of the World Cup en route to victory two years later. Godspeed, then.\n\u201cThis is the first final for us at the World Cup,\u201d Flick says, if nothing else showing admirable confidence that they\u2019ll get to play a second. \u201cWe are optimistic. We want to stick to our game because we have the quality. We have to be brave and believe in our quality.\u201d Flick could do worse than reminding his squad that far worse Germany teams than this have gone deep, using the 2002 runners-up as his starting point before bringing up Jupp Derwall. The odds may be against the Germans against Spain, but it\u2019d be a bold punter who writes them off. SM\nTalking points\nConservative Tunisia sunk by SocceroosWhile France look like the class of Group D, it was Tunisia that were trending towards second spot after keeping Denmark at bay in their opener. Trailing 1-0 after 23 minutes against Australia, Jalel Kadri\u2019s side needed a bolder approach but struggled to change gear and now find themselves needing an unlikely result against Les Bleus. It was telling how much of the ball was spent at the feet of centre-backs Yassine Meriah and Montassar Talbi rather than the more creative players. The half-time departure of Youssef Msakni \u2013 who was bright, if not a little wasteful \u2013 was a shame, but the absence of Anis Ben Slimane\u2019s creative spark became increasingly bizarre as the game wore on. Perhaps a return to underdog status will suit the Eagles of Carthage. TB\nSaudis\u2019 spot of bother proves costlyAt last, Robert Lewandowski came to the show, scoring his first ever World Cup goal. In a minor classic at Education City Stadium, Saudi Arabia could not repeat the trick of taking down one of football\u2019s modern greats, as with Lionel Messi and Argentina. Poland, against the run of play, and under heavy pressure from highly physical opposition, picked off the Saudis where Argentina repeatedly failed to pierce their high line. Herv\u00e9 Renard\u2019s team will rue Wojciech Szcz\u0119sny save from Salem al-Dawsari and wonder whether Firas al-Buraikan, who was passed over for the spot-kick, might have done better. JB\nBeyond the football\nThe sight of the Emir of Qatar, Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, wearing a Saudi Arabian scarf, and Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, wearing a Qatari scarf during the World Cup opener suggested some form of detente between two nations at frequent diplomatic loggerheads. But then came the weekend\u2019s news that Saudi viewers had been blocked from watching the tournament on the orders of Saudi Arabia\u2019s ministry of media. Qatari-owned BeIn Sports, home of Richard Keys and Andy Gray, has the broadcast rights for the World Cup in the Middle East and North Africa. While 22 matches are broadcast free-to-air, the remaining 42 matches are live-streamed on a platform called TOD TV. That platform was scrambled in Saudi Arabia on the eve of the tournament around the time Al Thani and Bin Salman were palling up for the cameras. The dispute brings back memories of when a Saudi pirate station named beoutQ was broadcasting copyrighted BeIn content from 2017 to 2019. At least Saudi fans were able to catch their own team\u2019s match on free-to-air, though the loss to Australia made for uncomfortable viewing. JB\nGlobal media-watch\nIt\u2019s been tit-for-tat in the Croatian and Canadian tabloids and Sunday\u2019s Group F encounter will certainly not lack edge as a result. After Canada\u2019s narrow opening loss against Belgium, when they largely had the better of their more illustrious opponents, the Maple Leafs\u2019 coach, John Herdman, told his players: \u201cWe\u2019re going to go and eff Croatia.\u201d The Croatian media did not take this perceived slight lying down: the tabloid newspaper 24 Sata (24 Hours) ran a full front-page mock-up of a naked Herdman with Maple Leaf flags over his mouth and private parts, and a headline asking: \u201cYou have the mouth, but do you have the balls as well?\u201d The Toronto Sun promptly hit back with \u201cOur Balls are Bigger\u201d, with a picture of some, er, footballs. The gloves are off. LMc\n\nThe internet reacts\nSoon after the final whistle blew on Australia\u2019s 1-0 win over Tunisia, video emerged showing what can only be described as \u201cscenes\u201d in Melbourne\u2019s Fed Square. Thousands of Socceroos fans bounce around with abandon. They\u2019ve waited 12 years for a World Cup win after all, so why not go wild? Mitch Duke, you hero. GB\n\nToday\u2019s matches\nJapan v Costa Rica (Group E, 10am GMT, ITV1) The Samurai Blue are buoyed by their sensational opening win against Germany. Costa Rica are recovering from a 7-0 demolishing by Spain. All things point to a Japanese victory that would see them to progress with a match in hand. A point would even be enough to secure a place in the knockout stages should Spain defeat Germany. LMcBelgium v Morocco (Group F, 1pm GMT, BBC One) How good are Belgium, really? After Kevin De Bruyne was named man of the match following their somewhat fortunate victory against Canada, he wondered aloud if he deserved it. \u201cThe team was better four years ago,\u201d admitted Eden Hazard, meanwhile, of the supposedly golden generation that finished third in 2018. It will be understandable if Roberto Mart\u00ednez chooses to freshen up his team for the second group match. Morocco, on the other hand, were heartened after they successfully denied Croatia three points. Might another shock be on the cards? LMcCroatia v Canada (Group F, 4pm GMT, BBC One) \u201cWe have to be cautious,\u201d said the Croatia coach, Zlatko Dalic, in assessing Canada\u2019s strong first performance. \u201cIf you look at the tournament, many of the teams that were underdogs are now great \u2026 you cannot enjoy the glory of the past, we have to be at our best.\u201d There are subplots aplenty \u2013 as mentioned in the global media-watch. The view of Ivan Perisic? \u201cWe have to be very fast and adopt an aggressive attitude.\u201d A match that should answer the question: are Croatia capable of replicating that run to the final in Russia? LMcSpain v Germany (Group E, 7pm GMT, BBC One) If Hansi Flick\u2019s side fail to get a positive result, they would be in serious danger of going out at the group stage for a second straight tournament. The mesmeric passing patterns of Luis Enrique\u2019s Spain are hardly ideal fare when you are fighting for survival, but it\u2019s tough at the top. Flick is still waiting until after their final training session to see if San\u00e9 is fit. \u201cI am convinced of the idea of how we want to play \u2026 we have courage and belief.\u201d Now would be a good time to show it. Spain will almost certainly be through to the knockouts with a win, so will not lack motivation. LMc\nPlayer to watch\nAtiba Hutchinson The only Canada squad member old enough to have been around when the country made its sole previous finals appearance - 1986 - will pass another milestone when receiving his 100th cap against Croatia. Against Belgium, the captain became the tournament\u2019s oldest outfield player at 39 years and 288 days, second only all-time to 42-year-old Roger Milla. \u201cI think all of us are in a moment where we\u2019ll be doing this as much for Atiba as we are to get three points,\u201d said John Herdman. \u201cHe\u2019s a legend.\u201d JB\nAnd finally \u2026\nIt\u2019s official, Fifa see diving for a penalty as fully valid. Or at least that\u2019s the view of Sunday Oliseh, of the Fifa technical study group helmed by Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. Cristiano Ronaldo winning the penalty against Ghana enraged many, including opposition coach Otto Addo. \u201cWhy?\u201d raged Addo. \u201cBecause it\u2019s Ronaldo or something?\u201d In Oliseh\u2019s view: \u201cThe smartness to wait for that second, to touch the ball, continue his leg and then get the contact. That is total genius. Let\u2019s give strikers the compliment for getting smarter.\u201d Wenger may now wish to retrospectively consider his 2004 comments on Wayne Rooney\u2019s \u201cgenius\u201d in falling over Sol Campbell. JB\n\u2022 This article was amended on 29 November 2022. An earlier version stated that Germany would be out if they failed to get a positive result, while Spain would be through to the knockout stages with a win. Both of these outcomes depend on the results of the final matches in the group. This has been corrected."

                    "body": "Four people have been arrested as part of an investigation into corruption and money laundering centred on a Gulf state\u2019s attempt to buy influence at the European parliament, Belgian prosecutors have said. Belgian police seized \u20ac600,000 (\u00a3515,000) in cash, computers and mobile phones after searches at 16 properties across Brussels on Friday morning, according to a statement from Belgium\u2019s federal prosecutor. It said the searches were part of a major investigation into alleged criminal organisation, corruption and money laundering. The four suspects, who have not been officially named and were born in 1955, 1969, 1971 and 1987, will be questioned and could appear before an investigating judge, the prosecutor\u2019s office said. Police investigators have suspected for several months that a Gulf country has sought to influence decisions at the European parliament through \u201cpaying large sums of money or offering large gifts\u201d to people with \u201ca significant political and/or strategic position\u201d, according to the statement from the federal prosecutor. Qatar, the gas and oil-rich state currently hosting the World Cup, was named by Belgium\u2019s Le Soir and Knack as the country that had offered large sums of money and gifts in an attempt to shape decisions at the European parliament. All the suspects are Italian nationals and were said to be active in a human rights NGO, Belgian media reported. The police operation was targeted at MEPs\u2019 assistants, who can play a crucial role in shaping legislation and acting as a gatekeeper for elected members of parliament. The homes of four assistants close to the socialist group and one employed by the centre-right European People\u2019s party were among those searched according to Belgian media. The searches were carried out across five Brussels communes (boroughs), including the large city centre district, according to prosecutors. European parliament officials would neither confirm nor deny if the parliament\u2019s premises had been searched, although its postcode suggests it was not on the list. In a statement, the European parliament said it did not comment on judicial proceedings, adding: \u201cAs always, the European parliament fully cooperates with the national authorities in charge. The same in this specific case.\u201d  If confirmed, it would be the most significant case of corruption affecting the European parliament in recent history. Recent corruption allegations have instead hit the Council of Europe\u2019s parliamentary assembly, a body that is separate to the EU. In 2018, an internal inquiry by the Strasbourg assembly concluded there was \u201ca strong suspicion\u201d that current and former members had \u201cengaged in activity of a corruptive nature\u201d, by altering reports on Azerbaijan in favour of the authoritarian regime and failing to follow the rules in declaring gifts."

                    "body": "CITY: SLICKER The football calendar has been out of whack for a few years now, what with the pandemic being followed in short order by a World Cup starting in November. All the old reference points, such as being top of the table at Christmas, or receiving an unfunny email every weekday at 5pm, mean absolutely nothing right now. What time is it? Who are we? Where is love? Don\u2019t ask us. So thank goodness for Mikel Arteta and his punctual pals, who went well out of their way to reassure all footballing existentialists that the more things change, the more they stay the same. Good old Arsenal, Jimmy Hill was right after all. See, time was, the Gunners would, at the exact same point each season, get their trousers freshly laundered, neatly pressed and handed back to them, usually by Bayern Munich in Big Cup\u2019s always-entertaining Round of Arsenal. You could set your watch, or at least your calendar, to it. Everyone would know exactly where they were. February! But now, as a result of Covid, Qatar and some pretty shonky form over the last five years, that particular outcome isn\u2019t possible right now, and as a result everyone\u2019s chronologically adrift. What a selfless gesture, then, by Arsenal to manufacture a different sort of February-infused fiasco that puts us all back at ease. Thanks, Takehiro! Nice one, Gabriel! Top work, Eddie! You\u2019ve done all time-travellers a big favour here.  Thing is, Arsenal were the better side in the first half of their top-of-the-table Premier League showdown with Manchester City. But Tomiyasu\u2019s blind backpass gifted the champions one goal, Gabriel\u2019s brain fade set off a chain of events that led to another, and Nketiah missed a couple of close-range headers in a way which caused fans to scream for Jesus in a most passionate and ambiguous manner. Having thus wedged the door ajar for City, Kevin De Bruyne, Jack Grealish and Erling Haaland barrelled straight through it, and now the champions, eight points adrift of the Gunners not so long ago, are top and odds-on to retain their title. Manchester United will finish second, too, we\u2019re with Gary Neville on this one. All told, a painful night for Arsenal, then, who are technically still in charge of their own destiny with a game in hand and a visit to the Etihad to come, but y\u2019know. Still, by taking one for the team, they can at least be proud of repairing most of the virus/Platini-related damage to football\u2019s space-time continuum. Although ironically, by blowing a nice lead at the top of the table, they\u2019ve made it feel exactly like 1987, 2003, 2005, 2008, 2014 and 2016 all over again. So while we\u2019ve established it\u2019s February, we probably also need to double-check what year this is. Oh Arsenal!

I thought they brought their best game tonight \u2026 it\u2019s a tough tournament and fatigue starts to kick in but they\u2019ve been rewarded for effort tonight.\u201d     5.54pm    James Tedesco speaks: \u201cIt\u2019s pretty unbelievable. We came over here six, seven weeks ago with this group of blokes and built a close bond \u2026 it\u2019s so special represent our country \u2026 it\u2019s a really proud moment, at the moment. \u201cWe formed a close bond on and off the field \u2026 it\u2019s important to build that connection \u2026 we wanted to work hard for each other, and we showed that tonight. \u201cIt\u2019s very special to put this jersey on and represent my family and friends. I know they\u2019re watching, so shout out to them. It\u2019s unbelievable, it\u2019s an unbelievable feeling. \u201cWe got better and better \u2026 and this was probably our best performance.\u201d   Updated at 6.15pm GMT    5.50pm   Full-time! The Kangaroos are champions! Australia 30-10 Samoa  The relentless Kangaroos are, entirely deservedly, named the Rugby League World Cup winners once again. Samoa gave it 100%, and maybe more, but Mal Meninga\u2019s side just had too much in defence and attack. It\u2019s double joy for Australia after the Jillaroos won their final earlier on.  Updated at 5.58pm GMT    5.49pm   Try! 79 min: Australia 30-10 Samoa (Mitchell)  All over. I mean, it already was. A fantastic fizzing pass off his right hand by Cleary sets up the final try of the match.    Updated at 5.59pm GMT    5.45pm    78 min: Jonathan Davies, who is on commentary duty, names the Kangaroos captain, James Tedesco, the player of the match. It has been an all-round quality performance from the No 1. Tedesco\u2019s finest. We have an \u2018intruder\u2019 on the pitch. A streaker, I think. But they\u2019re not showing it of course.  Updated at 5.47pm GMT    5.44pm    77 min: Samoa work through their latest set and move towards the Aussie line \u2026 Luai sets up Leniu, the replacement, but he is hauled down by this relentless Kangaroos defence.     5.42pm    75 min: Tedesco again makes inroads for Australia to within striking distance of the line \u2026 Addo Carr then wants it on the left wing but an attempted grubber kick is off the mark. Still, Australia lead by 16 points with just five minutes to play.     5.39pm   Try! 70 min: Australia 26-10 Samoa (Crichton)  A superb interception by the Samoan Stephen Crichton on the Australian left \u2026 and he\u2019s in at the corner! The conversion attempt comes back off the post.   Updated at 5.46pm GMT    5.35pm   Try! 68 min: Australia 24-6 Samoa (Tedesco)  Lovely, lovely try. A set training ground move that is beautifully worked, with Munster involved and Tedesco rushing into space and over the line. Australia are the champions \u2026 again.   Updated at 6.09pm GMT    5.32pm    66 min: Cleary puts up a bomb close to the Samoa try-line after Australia work through their latest set. Luai claims it. Australia continue to push.     5.30pm    63 min: It certainly looks like Australia are the better conditioned of the two sides, and they should turn the screw in the final quarter. But could Samoa get another try and place a little doubt in Kangaroos\u2019 minds?     5.27pm   Try! 61 min: Australia 20-6 Samoa (To'o)  And there it is! A lovely run by Jarome Luai sets up the chance for To\u2019o to run and dive in at the corner. Brilliant conversion by Stephen Crichton from a tight angle.    Updated at 5.44pm GMT    5.26pm    60 min: It would be nice for Samoa to get on the board. Even if it looks like the game has gone \u2026     5.24pm    59 min: Another try for Australia? Addo Carr jinks through and then kicks inside. Crichton tries to touch it down but did he knock it on? Yes he did. No try.     5.21pm    57 min: Crichton is back on from the bin. We are back to 13-a-side.     5.20pm    56 min: The sin-bin for Crichton is nearly over \u2026 and yet it\u2019s Australia, still a man down, threatening to extend their lead at the opponent\u2019s end of the field.  Updated at 5.21pm GMT    5.17pm   Try! 53 min: Australia 20-0 Samoa  A stunning steal by Munster sets up the latest Australia attack. Cameron Murray runs a good line and nabs a pass, diving over and celebrating demonstratively. This is looking all but over with nearly 30 minutes to go. Cleary converts.    Updated at 6.11pm GMT    5.15pm    52 min: \u201cSaying hi from Australia\u2019s most southern municipality (county) the Huon Valley, from the Apple Isle in the great state of Tasmania,\u201d emails Scott Dufty. \u201cGreat to be up 14-0 at half time, hoping we can go on and retain the trophy!\u201d Ah, beautiful Tasmania, AKA the South Island. It\u2019s looking good for the Kangaroos, Scott \u2026     5.13pm    50 min: Australia\u2019s defence holds firm after another frantic set by Samoa. There is just no way through \u2013 yet. Can Samoa make their numerical advantage count before the end of the 10 minutes?     5.11pm    48 min: Samoa are in on the left corner, Taylan May touches down \u2026 but it was a forward pass. However, a fumble by Australia gives Samoa another set close to the Kangaroos\u2019 try-line.  Updated at 5.12pm GMT    5.10pm   Yellow card for Australia! Crichton  It was an odd one: After a knock-on by Australia, Harris-Tavita lunged towards Angus Crichton, who raised his elbow into the Samoan\u2019s face.     5.08pm    47 min: Harris-Tavita is still down. I think this is a red card. But the referee is waiting for the treatment to the player to end.     5.07pm    47 min: Harris-Tavita goes crashing to the deck after taking an elbow in the face from Crichton. This could be a red card. It\u2019s at least a yellow.  Updated at 5.07pm GMT    5.04pm    43 min: Samoa ask the question down their left wing after some fast hands sends Taylan May haring down the field into space out wide. Two, three Aussie defenders are there to smash the runner into touch. There is a bit of celebration from Australia after another strong bit of defending.  Updated at 5.05pm GMT    5.01pm    41 min: Samoa fluff their first possession of the second half with a knock-on. They need to be more precise than that \u2026     5.00pm   Second half kick-off!  Here we go.     5.00pm    Can Samoa successfully search for the heroes inside themselves?      4.59pm    Here come the players for the second half.     4.48pm    HT reading:       4.46pm   Half-time! Australia 14-0 Samoa  \u201cClinical,\u201d is Jonathan Edwards\u2019 assessment of Australia on the BBC, which seems fair. Samoa need to find something remarkable after the break if they are going to make a game of this.  Updated at 4.55pm GMT    4.45pm    39 min: Mitchell is triple-tackled out on the Australia left wing. Tedesco then has a dart from a central position. Samoa get hands on it but they are forced back over the try-line \u2026     4.43pm    38 min: The Kangaroos are threatening the try-line, rather than Samoa threatening to cause any problems at the other end.     4.42pm    36 min: Now it\u2019s Tedesco probing for an opening just a few metres from the Samoa line. Suaali\u2019i goes down and claims a low grubber kick, bravely, taking a bit of a knock on the head in the process. Now, can Samoa trouble the scorers before the half-time whistle?     4.39pm    34 min: Taylan May finds a yard of space on the Samoa left after the ball is sent through the hands and he roars down the wing. A fine covering tackle by Tedesco snuffs out the danger.  Updated at 4.40pm GMT    4.36pm   Try! 30 min: Australia 14-0 Samoa (Martin)  Liam Martin is unstoppable from short range as Australia attack across the length of the field, following an error by Samoa as they neared the try-line. Martin has a couple of Samoans on hand to try and smash him backwards and repel him from the try-line but it\u2019s no use. The referee has a look at the replay, and is happy.   Updated at 5.20pm GMT    4.33pm    28 min: Luai puts a kick up after Samoa work towards the try-line \u2026 there is a decisive intervention by Addo-Carr, who stops what looks to be a try-scoring pass out to the right. But he does give Samoa another set and they are held up over the try-line! Positive signs for Parish\u2019s team but they need to get on the board.     4.28pm    24 min: Australia attack again \u2026 and it looks like Mitchell, the No 8, is over again, with a massively powerful run, smashing into contact, hitting the pitch, and reaching over the try-line. But he knocks it on! How do Samoa break out of this? They\u2019ve been on the back foot for 15 minutes now.  Updated at 4.30pm GMT    4.26pm    20 min: \u201cKiwi living in Broome, WA so don\u2019t really care who wins but really hope for a tight contest,\u201d emails Kelly George. Australia are certainly in the ascendancy now \u2026 Samoa need to get on the board if they are going to make this a contest. But the Kangaroos have a bit of a stranglehold right now.     4.23pm   Try! 18 min: Australia 10-0 Samoa (Tedesco)  Fantastic bit of skill from Addo Carr to break the Samoa line, he spots a gap, and zips through it \u2026 then he has a simple task to offload to Tedesco on his inside, and the Kangaroos captain sprints over. That was slack defence from Samoa in truth but they aren\u2019t out of this yet \u2026 Cleary adds the conversion.    Updated at 4.33pm GMT    4.19pm   Try! 14 min: Australia 4-0 Samoa (Mitchell)  Stunning finish. Latrell Mitchell bounces off a tackler on the left wing and flops over for the first try after Milford is caught napping (very slightly) in defence for Samoa. After a fantastic first 10 for Samoa, they let Australia down to their end of the pitch once, and have paid the price. \u201cJust brilliant, basic rugby league,\u201d says Jonathan Davies. The conversion attempt by Nathan Cleary comes up short.   Updated at 4.35pm GMT    4.17pm    12 min: \u201cI have lived in Australia and Samoa my whole youth but my heart is with Samoa,\u201d emails Anja Hansen. \u201cGO SAMOA!!!!\u201d     4.16pm    11 min: Hunt tries a cute little kick in behind from within inches of the try-line but Samoa deal with it.  Updated at 4.17pm GMT    4.15pm    10 min: Paulo smashes into contact for Samoa and gives them plenty of go-forward. Then a kick over the top from Luai is misjudged and Australia are able to burst away on the counterattack when they win back possession! They make 60 metres in a few seconds thanks mostly to a pacy run by Valentine Holmes!  Updated at 4.49pm GMT    4.14pm    9 min: It remains 0-0 approaching the 10-minute mark. Samoa are competing well, off-loading well, and putting the Kangaroos under tonnes of pressure. This is stirring stuff.  Updated at 4.14pm GMT    4.12pm    7 min: \u201cAtmosphere is great here in Auckland, as always when a Pasifika team is playing, flags are everywhere!\u201d emails Stephen Cooper.  \u201cMoney on Samoa, but hope it\u2019s a great game at least.\u201d Thanks for the email Stephen. It\u2019s pretty good so far \u2026  Updated at 4.13pm GMT    4.11pm    6 min: Another superb set from Samoa. They kick in behind the try-line, on the last tackle, and put the Kangaroos under plenty of pressure. Then there is a forward pass from Ben Hunt and we\u2019ll have a scrum.     4.08pm    4 min: A stunning early kick from Harris-Tavita for Samoa for the corner is kept in play by Tedesco \u2026 it looks like he\u2019s stayed infield, but on replay, he is in touch. But the officials missed it. That should have been a 40-20 for Samoa. Anyway, they are certainly competing well early doors.  Updated at 4.47pm GMT    4.07pm    3 min: Valentine Holmes claims a high bomb close to the try-line for Australia. He was under pressure there and passed the test. To\u2019o then makes a very good catch when Australia kick again.     4.05pm    2 min: Australia move through their first set and then kick down the middle. The hits are crunching on both sides. But we expected that.     4.03pm   First half kick-off!  Let\u2019s go!     4.01pm    During the Siva Tau, their traditional challenge, Samoa look pretty fired up! As well they might! Wow, they get right up in the faces of the Kangaroos. RIGHT in their faces. This is big.   Updated at 4.17pm GMT    3.59pm    \u201cAm watching from sunny Dubai,\u201d emails James Keith. \u201cReally looking forward to this one. Am an Aussie but will not be destroyed if we lose.\u201cThis is great for League.\u201d Good luck James!     3.56pm    The teams are out on the pitch, and it\u2019s time for the anthems. Samoa first. Some of the players lay an arm across their chest, eyes closed, and savour the emotion of the moment.   Updated at 4.18pm GMT    3.54pm    Aaron Bower\u2019s report here from last night, and England\u2019s win against France to win the wheelchair title: \u201cEngland, champions of the world. You only have to go back a few years since wheelchair rugby league was being played in empty sports halls. So here in Manchester, as almost 5,000 people watched England win the Wheelchair Rugby League World Cup on home soil, with the nation having taken this incredible sport to its heart, it was hard not to feel a little moved.\u201d      3.51pm    If you\u2019re burning the midnight oil in Australia, or indeed Samoa, why not send me an email and let me know how you\u2019re feeling? Email or tweet @LukeMcLaughlin  Updated at 3.52pm GMT    3.48pm    \u201cOn the main street of Apia, the capital of Samoa, everything is blue. People are in royal blue T-shirts, blue streamers hang from car windows, some houses have even been painted blue in the last week.\u201d Joyetter Feagaimaali\u2019i reports from on World Cup fever in Samoa.      3.46pm    Josh Addo-Carr of Australia is the leading try-scorer in the tournament, with 12. The closest man on the opposing side is Tim Lafai, who has crossed the whitewash six times before today.     3.40pm   Team news  Australia are unchanged from the semi-final against New Zealand. For Samoa, Fa\u2019manu Brown is sidelined by concussion, meaning Chanel Harris-Tavita comes in.       3.38pm    Is Matt Parish surprised Samoa are in the final? \u201cNo. We\u2019ve believed from day one \u2026 we\u2019ve improved every week, and we\u2019ll need to improve again today. \u201cWe\u2019ve prepared really well this week \u2026 we know we\u2019ve got an enormous job ahead but we\u2019re looking forward to it.\u201d     3.37pm    Mal Meninga, the Australia coach, speaks to the BBC: \u201cEveryone\u2019s fit and healthy \u2026 we\u2019re in fine spirits at the moment \u2026 the semi-final helped us as a pressure game, to help us make better decisions \u2026 our prep\u2019s been excellent, yeah, looking forward to today\u2019s game. \u201cPressure\u2019s part of playing in finals footy. They\u2019ll feel pressure too, they\u2019ll want to come out and play their best game.\u201d     3.32pm    Aaron Bower\u2019s preview: If you are in and around Old Trafford on Saturday and can smell something familiar in the air, it\u2019s probably the lingering scent of Australian dominance. As the sun sets on another Rugby League World Cup, it does so in utterly recognisable fashion: only this time there is not one, but two Australian sides looking to cement their status as the world\u2019s best in their respective finals.      3.24pm    The Australia full-back, Sam Bremner, gives her reaction to the BBC: \u201cOh my god \u2026 Joy but relief \u2026 we\u2019ve been thinking about this exact moment for so long, some of us nine years, some of us five years \u2026 I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re currently in that moment, just taking it all in. Just so overwhelmed with happiness and relief.\u201d Bremner takes a moment, overcome with emotion, before continuing: \u201cI\u2019ve been in this team since I was a teenager \u2026 I\u2019m now almost 31, it\u2019s shaped me, it shapes all of us to be really good humans \u2026 good footballers but best of all good humans, and when we play a World Cup it\u2019s our chance to say thank you for all the values that this team instills in you \u2026 these tears are happy.\u201d Brilliant interview.   Updated at 3.34pm GMT    3.17pm    Aaron Bower is our man on the scene in Manchester: Australia\u2019s Jillaroos sauntered to a third consecutive Women\u2019s Rugby League World Cup courtesy of a commanding, one-sided victory over New Zealand\u2019s Kiwi Ferns. The two sides delivered the game of the tournament in the group stage, with Australia edging their opponents 10-8 to finish top of Group B.   Updated at 3.17pm GMT    3.15pm    The presentations for the women\u2019s World Cup are ongoing. The Jillaroos squad and back room staff just formed a victorious circle and had a bit of a sing-song. Now they get their hands on their winners\u2019 medals, not to mention the trophy.     3.08pm   Women's World Cup final result: Australia 54-4 New Zealand  The Jillaroos are champions. Aaron Bower\u2019s report will be coming up.     3.00pm   Preamble  No one would have predicted Samoa going deep in this competition after a 60-6 demolition at the hands of England in their opening match. Very few people expected them to emerge victorious last week, against the same opposition, in a dramatic semi-final at the Emirates Stadium. But, thanks to Stephen Crichton\u2019s extra-time, golden-point drop-goal, they earned themselves a shot at glory at Old Trafford today. So why shouldn\u2019t they go one better, having reached their first final, and win the whole thing? Because, the realists among you will point out, Australia are aiming for their third straight tournament victory and their 12th overall. Technically they haven\u2019t even missed a final since 1957 (the final of the inaugural event, in 1954, was contested by Great Britain and France). So the odds are stacked against Samoa and the Kangaroos supporters, many of whom will be up at all hours of the night, will understandably be feeling confident. Do today\u2019s official underdogs have more than a puncher\u2019s chance? Team news and more coming up. Kick-off: 4pm UK time  Updated at 3.02pm GMT "

                    "body": "He is the boy from Whitchurch, north Cardiff, about to lead Wales on the world stage. Gareth Bale\u2019s first World Cup memories are a little hazy \u2013 probably France 98, he says \u2013 not helped by the sustained absence of his country and a team to truly get behind. \u201cI just remember having this pencil case with the [tournament] logo on it,\u201d he says. But a moment that perhaps seemed as though it would elude a glittering, superstar career stacked with honours and individual accolades is finally here. Towards one end of the Corniche, Doha\u2019s opulent waterfront, an industrial-sized image of Bale, plastered on to the facade of a sparkling skyscraper, glistens above the city.\nBale remains a big deal, a commercial entity in his own right, but the fire in him to prove he can still do the business on the pitch burns brightly. Recent evidence has already suggested as much: a fortnight ago he scored an 128th-minute leaping header to help Los Angeles FC lift the MLS Cup. For Wales to be able to lean on their captain, a player who has a handy habit of calmly rising to the occasion, is something of a priceless commodity at their first World Cup finals for 64 years. Bale and his teammates are determined to enjoy however long this latest ride lasts.\nThe past six years have brought Wales three major tournaments, including that unforgettable and mesmeric run to the semi-finals at Euro 2016, which Bale began with a darting free-kick against Slovakia in Bordeaux. For the younger generation of fans, Wales\u2019 recent success may have blurred the lines. \u201cThey don\u2019t realise how spoiled they are,\u201d Bale says. That endearing, goofy grin follows.\n\nAfter all, it has not always been this way. \u201cWatching Brazil and Argentina and those big teams play and now to be in that tournament is quite a cool feeling to have, especially as growing up there was not a Wales side [at a World Cup],\u201d he says. \u201cFor the kids now to be able to have Wales, being able to watch them and have the poster up on the wall to mark out each game will be incredible.\u201d\nBale, not for the first time, will go where others have failed. When the goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey, Bale\u2019s best friend in the squad and, like him, a fellow Wales centurion, recently told of his pride at representing his country at a World Cup, he almost sounded a touch embarrassed at doing so knowing his idol, Neville Southall, never made it this far. The same applies to Ian Rush, whose goalscoring record Bale broke four years ago, Ryan Giggs, Gary Speed, Mark Hughes and John Toshack, who handed a 16\u2011year\u2011old Bale, then a fizzy left\u2011back on the books of Southampton, his senior debut in 2006.\n\nThe magnitude of wearing the dragon on his chest \u2013 as well as at least two armbands, only one of which is endorsed by Fifa \u2013 at a finals is not lost on Bale. \u201cIt is a very proud moment. Not only for us as players but the whole nation. Every time there has been a failure it has been \u2018we want to get over the line eventually\u2019 and the longer time went on it became an even bigger task, I guess. To be the ones to achieve it has been incredible and something we have all dreamed of since we were young \u2013 it is crazy now that the tournament is upon us and we are just going to try to enjoy it.\u201d\nRob Page, the Wales manager, insists the team are not as reliant on Bale as they once were and that is a sentiment shared by the midfielder Jonny Williams, who made his international debut in 2013 when he replaced Bale as a substitute. Williams, who would have been lining up for a Swindon Town side that lost at home against Crewe in the fourth tier on Saturday had he not been here, is actually Wales\u2019s leading goalscorer at club level this season, not that he has been ribbing Bale about that fact. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do that,\u201d he says, typically modestly. \u201cThey\u2019ll just say \u2018it\u2019s in League Two\u2019 so I\u2019ll get there first and say it myself.\u201d\n\nHow has Bale evolved over the years? \u201cInto a real leader of the team and a leader of men,\u201d Williams says. \u201cThere is no ego or big-time [nature]: \u2018I am not going to do this\u2019. He just treats everyone with respect. He makes people feel a part of something. I have played in changing rooms where that has not necessarily been the case \u2013 and that is with players that are of a lot less ability than Gareth.\u201d Williams breaks into a smile. \u201cFair play, and credit to him and his parents.\u201d\nBale had a quick, understated word with Luke Harris and Jordan James to instantly put the teenage pair at ease on their first Wales camp at their team base in Hensol in September. It was a similar story with Sorba Thomas earlier this year. \u201cI said to Sorba: \u2018Have you met Gareth before?\u2019\u201d Page says. \u201cHe said: \u2018Well, only playing Fifa on PlayStation.\u2019 The next thing he\u2019s sat having dinner with him and I watched Sorba and he was looking up in awe of his hero who is standing above him and talking to him on a level. But Gareth\u2019s got a knack of doing that, he just makes people feel at ease.\u201d\n\nThe thing that has not changed with Bale is the gaze that follows him. \u201cHe just lights the room up just with his presence, with him just being there,\u201d Page says. \u201cI used to liken it to club management when you\u2019re writing the team sheet down and you want the best players on the team sheet because you know the impact it\u2019s going to have on the opposing manager. Gareth\u2019s goals have taken us to the World Cup \u2026 but without what everybody else has done on that pitch, doing the hard yards, the graft, to get opportunities and give him the chance to put a free-kick in, it doesn\u2019t happen. It\u2019s a massive team effort.\u201d\nFor Bale, this is his final guaranteed appearance on the biggest stage and almost certainly his last at a World Cup. Depending on how Wales fare in Group B, he could bow out in nine days\u2019 time against England, of all teams. It is too early to say how this will play out but Wales, despite the strides they have taken in recent years, will still undoubtedly look to Bale for inspiration. \u201cHe has been doing it for years and is still massively capable, even at his age,\u201d Williams says. \u201cHe is 33 now, scoring huge goals in America and having big moments for us, in the [World Cup playoff] semi-final [against Austria, in which he scored twice]. We still look to him as the main man.\u201d"

                    "body": "Tottenham\u2019s Boxing Day draw with Brentford was not the most dramatic of the games in which they have claimed 21 points from behind this season across Europe and domestically, but it further reinforced the notion that, however down they seem, there is always a way back. That is character.\nTake Harry Kane who, on his first appearance since skying that penalty in Qatar, scored a superb headed second-half goal to begin a rescue operation finished minutes later by Pierre-Emile H\u00f8jbjerg. That is character.\n\nTake Ivan Toney, whose inspired performance having missed out on the World Cup completely, and then been charged with what is now 262 alleged breaches of Football Association gambling rules, looked for more than an hour to have secured a home victory. That is character.\nKane and Toney, the clubs\u2019 respective poster-boys, were the pre-game focus. Thankfully \u2013 with the notable exception of various online cesspits \u2013 football has largely moved on from the vitriolic, personal abuse endured previously by those who have erred on England duty. But there were still some insults aimed Kane\u2019s way, among them an early cry of \u201cIvan Toney, he would have scored that\u201d from home fans. It was equal parts Kane critique and Toney support.\nWhether or not you believe the breadth of the FA\u2019s Rule E8 is draconian, Toney faces a potentially lengthy absence if the charges are upheld. Such is his importance to Brentford that it could derail their steady-as-she-goes second season in the top flight. Typically, though, Toney did not give off the air of a man with the weight of the world on his shoulders; more a man inspired.\n\u201cI wish I knew, because I\u2019d bottle it up and sell it for a lot of money,\u201d Thomas Frank said when asked how Toney was able to put aside the outside noise. \u201cI would be very, very rich. In that way he is very, very special. Character and mentality is the ability to focus in the moment. To stay focused on the task. His performance today \u2026 wow.\u201d\n\nToney bullied Tottenham, with a particular focus on Japhet Tanganga, whose rare start was mercifully cut short by Antonio Conte. Cristian Romero, absent basking in World Cup glory, will not be concerned for his place.\nFifteen minutes in, Toney rose above Tanganga to flick on for Bryan Mbeumo. His cross was met by Mathias Jensen\u2019s volley, which would not have troubled Fraser Forster but for a deflection off Cl\u00e9ment Lenglet. Forster, handed his league debut for Spurs with Hugo Lloris on the bench, could only palm the ball straight to Vitaly Janelt, who scored.\n\nShortly before the break Toney coolly rounded Forster and finished, but the flag was raised. He did not have to wait long for the goal he craved, though. Ten minutes after the break, Mbeumo\u2019s inswinging corner was flicked on by Christian N\u00f8rgaard at the near post, and Toney stabbed in.\nConte\u2019s irritation was obvious, but his side\u2019s lackadaisical showing until that point did not merit anything better. Kane was virtually anonymous until he more or less begged David Coote for a penalty early in the second half. He had grappled with Ben Mee at the far post but VAR did not ask Coote to reconsider. Almost immediately, Eric Dier made a hash of a clearance, conceding the corner from which Brentford scored their second, and Conte sat down.\n\nBut Kane would soon bring the Italian back to his feet, rising to head Lenglet\u2019s whipped centre beyond David Raya. \u201cMomentum swung their way when Kane scored that,\u201d admitted Frank. \u201cIt was a situation where I would have said to our players: \u2018Happy days, let them cross from there.\u2019 What an unbelievable cross from Lenglet, and a great header from Harry.\u201d\nWith it Kane passed Robbie Fowler\u2019s tally of nine Boxing Day goals in the Premier League and completed a full house of scoring against all 32 sides he has faced in the division.\nBournemouth, Marseille, Leeds: surely Spurs could not do it again? Well, not quite, but almost. They levelled when Dejan Kulusevski was fleet of foot in the penalty area, played a one-two with Matt Doherty and pulled back for H\u00f8jbjerg, who finished calmly.\nA relatively serene Boxing Day lunchtime had suddenly turned chaotic. In a two-minute spell Doherty escaped a booking for tumbling easily in the penalty area, Mbeumo was booked for an obvious attempt at deception, and Ethan Pinnock appeared to block Kane\u2019s close-range shot with his hand, only to be saved by the offside flag.\nKane almost claimed victory when beating Raya to a cross only to see his header hit the bar. It would have been unjust.\n\u201cBy the way, what a game to reopen the Premier League with. What an advert for the league,\u201d Frank added before departing. And he was right."

                    "body": "Cody Gakpo: PSV Eindhoven, striker PSV\u2019s plan was to let the Netherlands international move in the summer but after his exceptional World Cup he has a chance to leave in January. Erik ten Hag is a big fan and Manchester United remain interested, making contact with the 23-year-old\u2019s agents. Negotiations between the clubs have not started, though, and it depends on how much United are willing to invest in a forward. PSV wanted \u20ac50m last summer but are now demanding more than \u20ac60m. Josko Gvardiol: RB Leipzig, defender Chelsea are pushing again to sign the 20-year-old but there is also interest from Manchester City and Real Madrid. The question is whether the Croatia centre-back, who can also play at left-back, moves in January or next summer. Chelsea bid \u20ac80m at the end of August, with a view to Gvardiol staying on loan at Leipzig for another season. The asking price has gone up to more than \u20ac90m. David Datro Fofana: Molde, striker A deal is imminent for the 20-year-old to join Chelsea, who will pay the Norwegian club about \u20ac12m and give Fofana a five-year deal. Chelsea are deciding whether the Ivory Coast international should stay with them or go on loan but the deal has been agreed by the clubs and with the player. Mykhaylo Mudryk: Shakhtar Donetsk, winger The Ukrainian is Arsenal\u2019s priority target and wants to join the Premier League leaders but the other important consideration is what happens between the clubs because Shakhtar want more than \u20ac65m-70m and Arsenal want to pay less. Contacts are ongoing.  Cristiano Ronaldo: free agent, forward The 37-year-old has been training since the World Cup to be in the best possible shape and is waiting for an opportunity in Europe after leaving Manchester United. He has an offer on the table from the Saudi Arabian club Al Nassr worth \u20ac200m a season until June 2025 with commercial deals included. Youssoufa Moukoko: Borussia Dortmund, forward Dortmund are negotiating with the 18-year-old in the hope of extending his contract beyond the summer but are yet to make an offer that satisfies Moukoko. The Germany international has a great relationship with his manager, Edin Terzic, and would be happy to stay but Dortmund need to act fast because Premier League clubs will push to sign him if no agreement is reached. Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix: Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, forward The Portugal international is open to leaving and Atl\u00e9tico are willing to listen to offers but will start with an asking price of more than \u20ac100m. There will be discussions with F\u00e9lix\u2019s agent, Jorge Mendes, in the coming weeks to try to bring proposals from English clubs or Paris Saint-Germain. There is a good chance the 23-year-old will move but it is too early to say where. Sofyan Amrabat: Fiorentina, midfielder Fiorentina will demand \u20ac40m for the Morocco international after he shone at the World Cup. Tottenham wanted Amrabat last January and Antonio Conte remains a big fan but Spurs are happy with Rodrigo Bentancur so nothing is advanced there. Liverpool are tracking the 26-year-old but a lot of other clubs also like him and it will not be an easy deal given the asking price.  Hakim Ziyech: Chelsea, attacking midfielder Chelsea are open to letting Ziyech go if they receive the right offer for a permanent transfer \u2013 a loan does not interest them. Milan are not negotiating to sign him, contrary to rumours, but talks were held last summer. Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez: Benfica, midfielder The Argentinian had a fantastic World Cup and a number of clubs, notably in the Premier League and La Liga, are interested. Liverpool and Chelsea are among those tracking him but this does not look a straightforward transfer because Benfica would like to keep their two biggest players: Fern\u00e1ndez and the forward Gon\u00e7alo Ramos. Fern\u00e1ndez has a \u20ac120m release clause."

                    "body": "  9.21pm    Nick Ames\u2019 match report is now in, so I\u2019ll shut things down here. A disciplined, mature performance from the young American team sets up a clash with the Netherlands on Saturday. We\u2019ll see you then.   Updated at 9.21pm GMT    9.18pm    Alex Greenberg didn\u2019t think much of Gregg Berhalter\u2019s leadership in that game: \u201cBerhalter needs to sub earlier and more,\u201d he writes. \u201cYou\u2019ve got players dead on their feet and he\u2019s holding back his substitutions. It was a miracle we pulled that off.\u201d Kurt Perleberg has other views: \u201cThis was the greatest soccer game I ever saw.\u201d  Updated at 9.19pm GMT    9.17pm    Weston McKennie speaks to Fox Sports: \u201cWe\u2019re a really close group of guys. We love the pressure. We have our own swagger, our own style,\u201d he says. Asked about Pulisic he says: \u201cWe\u2019re very thankful that he put his body there. But we have 25 other guys who would do the same thing.\u201d     9.14pm    The US will play Netherlands in the next round. England advance as group winners after their victory over Wales, and will play Senegal.      9.12pm    US coach Gregg Berhalter is interviewed on Fox Sports. He is asked how he feels about his young team. \u201cProud. The first half we showed what we could do soccer wise. The second half we showed what we could do determination wise.\u201d He is asked about Christian Pulisic\u2019s injury, which he sustained as he scored the game\u2019s only goal. He says there is \u201cno update\u201d. He adds: \u201cI can\u2019t say enough [good things] about Christian.\u201d     9.08pm    Iran look devastated. It must have been an incredibly draining tournament for them as they contended with the Qatari heat and the pressure of events off the pitch as turmoil in their home country continues.      9.06pm    The US have now reached the last 16 in their last three World Cup appearances. Christian Pulisic was devastated when the Americans missed out on Russia 2018 and it was Pulisic who put his body (and possibly his testicles) on the line as he scored the winner.      9.03pm   Full-time: Iran 0-1 USA  The US have done it! They are through to the last 16. It was an incredibly tense finish as Iran had that penalty shout but the US were deserved winner. They had the lion\u2019s share of the chances and possession and Turner didn\u2019t have to make a save worth its name in the 90 (plus) minutes.   Updated at 9.16pm GMT    9.03pm    90 min+9: Wright has a brilliant chance. He should probably have run the ball into the corner but shoots. And it\u2019s a terrible one.      9.02pm    VAR REVIEW! Did Carter-Vickers foul Taremi as he bore down on goal?!! No! Play on.      9.00pm    90 min+7: Another throw for the US, who are running down the clock well/giving themselves no time to come back after Iran\u2019s miraculous equaliser.      8.59pm    90 min+6: Jalali is booked as he pulls down Musah, who is looking to break. Cameron-Vickers takes a looooong time with the free-kick. Understandably.      8.58pm    90 min+5: Ghoddos whizzes down the left but dribbles the ball out to give the US another breather.  Updated at 8.58pm GMT    8.57pm    90 min+4: Play slows down for the US as they win a throw.      8.56pm    90 min+3: Free-kick to Iran to the left of the area. It\u2019s a wicked, whipped ball and Pouraliganji\u2019s diving header whisks just wide of Turner\u2019s near post.      8.54pm    90 min +2: Iran play the ball around patiently given that they need to score very soon. ZImmerman heads a cross clear. Just about.      8.53pm    90 min: Musah loses the ball after he stumbles but Iran\u2019s attack breaks down (no) thanks to a poorly placed ball.      8.51pm    89 min: Iran win their first corner, a minute short of the regulation 90. It was not worth waiting for. The US clear. \u201cIs it just me or do you hear a beeping sound? It must the the US bus reversing into its parking spot in the 18-yard box,\u201d says Peter Oh.  Updated at 10.12pm GMT    8.51pm    88 min: Nine minutes of added time. This is going to be tense.      8.50pm    87 min: Iran try a patient build-up before a pretty poor through-ball is hit too far and ambles into Matt Turner\u2019s loving arms. Then the US have a chance at the other end but Iran scramble clear.      8.48pm    85 min: The next 10 minutes or so, will be a wave of Iran attacks. Not great for the nerves of either set of fans.      8.46pm    83 min: Iran shout for a penalty as the ball rolls up Moore\u2019s body after that free-kick. It\u2019s not given. The US have five at the back now. If you\u2019re joining us from the US and want to get daily updates on the World Cup in your inbox every morning then might we interest you in First Thing? It covers all the US and global news you need to know each day, as well as a round-up of the latest updates from Qatar 2022, written by me.    Updated at 8.47pm GMT    8.44pm    82 min: Weah clips Jalali and Iran have a set-piece around 45-yards from the US goal. Zimmerman and Moore are on for Dest and Weah. The US are looking to preserve their lead rather than search for a killer second goal.      8.42pm    80 min: Ansarifard is on for Gholizadeh. Iran shout for a free-kick as Carter-Vickers muscles out the busy Ghoddos but the ref waves play on.      8.40pm    78 min: Hosseini is booked for a foul on Aaronson. And Wright comes on for Sargent, who played well this evening.      8.39pm    76 min: USA are down to 10 men as Sargent continues to be treated off the pitch.      8.37pm    75 min: Sargent is being treated after landing heavily \u2013 looks like he may have tweaked his knee. One of his knees \u2013 he has two.      8.36pm    73 min: The game has slowed a little as it nears its end. A little strange seeing as Iran need to score.      8.35pm    71 min: Torabi comes on for Noorollahi.      8.32pm    69 min: A handball from Iran sets up a free-kick for the US around 25 yards out in the centre of the pitch. Acosta and Musah debate who will take it. It\u2019s the birthday boy who gets the opportunity, but Musah sends the ball over. \u201cA couple of these young American players (McKennie, Weah) look faster on the ball than most of their opponents off it. Some impressive fleetness,\u201d says Alex Whitney.      8.29pm    66 min: Ghoddos has had two good looks at goal this half and has failed to hit the target twice. This time he finds himself free-ish in the area and curls the ball past the far post. Acosta is on for the US in place of McKennie.      8.26pm    64 min: Rezaeian goes down hard and cries out in pain, loudly enough to be heard above the Iranian fans (although maybe he just landed near a microphone). He\u2019s fine to continue though.      8.24pm    62 min: Iran\u2019s fans continue to make it sound like they\u2019re the home team. Rezaeian has plenty of time to pick out his man on a cross from the right but Ream clears well.  \u201cA definite candidate for the daily pedant award, but Tyler Adams\u2019 name technically covers three US presidents, not two, as both John Adams and John Quincy Adams were presidents,\u201d writes Matt Guthrie. No wonder the guys is such a good leader.      8.22pm    59 min: Taremi strays an inch or four offside. They\u2019re looking distinctly zingy in the last few minutes.      8.20pm    57 min: Two corners in succession for the US. Neither achieve much.  Elsewhere, England have scored twice against Wales and are 2-0 up. They will almost certainly go through as group winners. You can follow the match here:      8.18pm    55 min: Sargent, whose build-up play has been excellent today, releases Dest who bumbles into some Iranian defenders. That leaves the US exposed at the back and Cameron-Vickers does well to escort Taremi away from danger as he bursts into the box. It\u2019s an open game as Iran go after the goal they need and the US look to kill the contest off.      8.15pm    52 min: Ghoddos, on as a sub, gets ahead of Dest and heads over the bar. Iran\u2019s best (and only) real chance of the game. The ref and Gregg Berhalter are arguing about something. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure no US president has fathered a top football (spherical version) player but Tyler Adams\u2019 name covers two former commanders-in-chief,\u201d says Peter Oh.   Updated at 8.30pm GMT    8.13pm    50 min: The US clearly want to get a second and save themselves from being vulnerable to a sucker punch from Iran. Pulisic\u2019s injury is an abdominal one, according to Fox Sports. Not sure if that\u2019s code for a knock to the unmentionables.      8.10pm    48 min: Sargent cuts in and unleashes a left-foot shot but Beiranvand blocks. The ball trickles away from the keeper but he smothers it before any Americans can pounce.      8.08pm    46 min: Pulisic is off after that heavy collision when he scored \u2013 we\u2019re not sure of the exact diagnosis yet. Brenden Aaronson comes on as his replacement.      8.06pm    Here\u2019s K\u00e1ri Tulinius: \u201cI have a cockamamie theory that the USMNT is always the team that most fits the vibes of each World Cup. \u201890 they went to Italy expecting to have fun, and didn\u2019t. In \u201894 they had joy until Brazil rearranged their faces. \u201898, went to France expecting great things, but only France got great things. \u201802, when outsiders had good tournaments, they had their best since \u201830. \u201806, they drew with Italy but somehow lost. \u201810 they opened up new markets for football fandom. \u201814 they were a hot mess that somehow got to the second round. Let\u2019s skip over Russia \u201818, but in retrospect maybe Fifa should\u2019ve skipped over Russia in 2018. And in \u201822 they\u2019re all midfield and no striker.\u201d     8.02pm    The US have won their last eight matches in which Christian Pulisic has scored. Brendan May wants his fellow Brenda(e)n to get involved. \u201cThink we need to go with Aaronson early for McKennie, perhaps even at the half. US waited too long against Wales,\u201d he writes.      7.57pm    That was an excellent half for the US: they completely dominated Iran who, from the first minute, looked to be playing for the draw that will almost certainly put them through. The one criticism for the Americans would be the lack of a final ball after creating so much pressure from the wings. It\u2019s worth bearing in mind that the US did this against Wales in the first-half too before fading badly. Iran\u2019s World Cup is far from over too: they only need one chance \u2013 which will surely come \u2013 to get back in this and go through. \u201cTimothy Weah\u2019s appearance has me wondering which other international footballers have also been the sons of sitting heads of state,\u201d writes Isaac Abraham. \u201cThe only other one I can think of is Al-Saadi Gaddafi!\u201d  Updated at 7.59pm GMT    7.53pm   Half-time Iran 0-1 USA  And that\u2019s it for a dominant half for the US. Weah has the ball in the net but he\u2019s just offside. A lovely finish from Weah though. At the moment, USA are going through as group runners up and will face the Netherlands. A long way to go though. Joshua Reynolds may have diagnosed the true reason for Pulisic\u2019s suffering: \u201cI am in awe that he can go on after full speed kick in the balls.\u201d     7.49pm    45 min +4: Dest breaks down the right but he overhits his pass to Weah. Goal-kick to Iran.      7.48pm    45 min+2: Mohammadi is down injured for Iran. Karimi trots on as his replacement.      7.47pm    45 min: A brilliant pass from Adams releases Sargent, who taps it to Weah on the edge of the area. Weah tries to return the compliment but his pass is a little off and Iran intercept. A surprisingly modest five minutes have been added on to the half.      7.44pm    44 min: Pulisic is back on. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he struggles on until half-time and is reassessed then. If he\u2019s concussed he should, obviously, be nowhere near the pitch.      7.43pm    43 min: Chance for Sargent who fires across the face of goal. The US clearly want to give their biggest star time to recover but for now they continue a man down. That extra man benefits Iran, and Adams concedes a foul \u2013 and yellow \u2013 as the Iranians break on the counter.     7.41pm    41 min: Pulisic is up on his feet but looks shaky. I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019ll be able to continue. For now, the US play with 10 men.   Updated at 7.59pm GMT    7.40pm   GOAL! Iran 0-1 USA (Pulisic 38 min)  Well, that makes up for his terrible corners. Dest nods across the area and Pulisic taps home. It\u2019s a brave effort as Beiranvand comes out to clear. The keeper\u2019s knee smacks into Pulisic and he\u2019s still being treated. A crucial strike but Pulisic looks like he has been badly hurt.   Updated at 7.43pm GMT    7.38pm    38 min: The US win their second corner. Pulisic trots over to the flag and passes it short to an incoming teammate, but it\u2019s underhit and Iran clear. Nice idea, shame about the execution.      7.36pm    35 min: The US have already had more shots in this game than they had in the entire match with Wales. And none of them have seriously threatened Beiranvand.      7.34pm    33 min: Noorollahi is OK to continue. Weah gets under a shot and blasts over. \u201cThe reason Iran should win or draw, humanly speaking, is that its players will desperately need the protection of hero status when they fly back to Tehran,\u201d emails Johan Bavinck. \u201cWhereas the US players will be fine in all cases.\u201d     7.32pm    31 min: Dest dances along the edge of the area and falls as he shoots and it\u2019s cleared by Iran. Ream then gives away a throw-in close to the US goal. Berhalter is claiming that Iran are already time wasting, which means we\u2019ll have just the 28 minutes of added time. Noorollahi is down injured in the US area and is being treated. Make that 29 minutes of added time.      7.29pm    29 min: Sargent turns and shoots, and the ball deflects off a defender\u2019s leg and spins up into the night sky. It finds Weah around eight yards out but he can\u2019t get enough power on the header and Beiranvand gathers it comfortably.      7.28pm    26 min: US corner, won by Robinson. Pulisic to take \u2026 and he places it beautifully on the forehead of the Iran defender on the near post.      7.24pm    23 min: It\u2019s England 0-0 Wales in the other match, so at the moment England and Iran are going through. The US once again cut in from wide. And once again, the final ball is missing.      7.21pm    21 min: Chance for Iran! Taremi and Azmoun are free in the US area. And as Taremi knocks the ball to his teammate in plenty of space, Tim Ream puts in a crucial interception. Very nearly 1-0 to Iran.      7.19pm    19 min: This has similarities to the Wales and England games as the US threaten plenty in the build-up but without anyone to apply the finishing touch.      7.17pm    16 min: Robinson gets into space again and sends in a cross that is just behind Weah. Then Dest sends in a cross from the other side, which Beiranvand dives out to punch clear. US are threatening from the wings here.   Updated at 7.22pm GMT    7.14pm    13 min: Robinson has been getting plenty of joy down the left while Carter-Vickers is getting up in support too. Pulisic\u2019s terrible touch \u2013 his second of the game \u2013 gives possession away to Iran, who knock it back and forth nicely while note really doing too much attacking.  An email from Paul Griffin: \u201cHUGE game today: Iran v USA,\u201d he writes, winding up for the punchline. \u201cA nation steeped in religiosity, abundant in mineral resources, with a fanatical hatred of its opponent, versus Iran.\u201d     7.11pm    10 min: Unconfirmed reports a US fan was thrown out of the game for wearing a rainbow armband.      7.10pm    9 min: Tyler Adams\u2019 shot is so bad that in ends up being a decent cross-field pass to Robinson, whose cross is dealt with by Iran. Adams then races back to stifle an Iranian counterattack. His reputation has been bolstered in this tournament, and looks like he will lead his country for years to come. Musah has the clearest chance of the game so far for the US when he lashes a shot over the bar from just outside the area.      7.07pm    6 min: Birthday boy Yunus Musah (Happy 20th!), who has been excellent this tournament, wins a throw in after some good work down the right but Iran clear the danger. The US have had the better of the play so far. Or they did, as Iran enjoy some good pressure in the US area. The Americans looked a little nervy defending there \u2013 they know they\u2019re the ones who have to win this one.   Updated at 7.09pm GMT    7.03pm    3 min: An early set-piece for Iran around 40 yards from goal, but the US clear thanks to the head of captain Tyler Adams. Pulisic then scampers forward but is tackled by Hosseini as he bears down on the penalty area.      7.01pm    1 min: And we\u2019re off. The Americans in blue and Iran in white.  USA go through if they win. Iran will also progress if they win, and a draw could also be good enough, depending on how the Wales v England game goes. You can follow that one here:  Meanwhile, Brendan May asked and now he regrets. \u201cI wanted Cameron Carter-Vickers, but now I\u2019m nervous about messing with chemistry,\u201d he writes.      6.56pm    The teams are out on the pitch and Iran sing their national anthem first, some more enthusiastically than others. There are also whistles and jeers in the stadium, presumably from Iranian fans giving their thoughts on their country\u2019s regime. The US then belt our theirs, just without the whooshy jet flyover you get at NFL games. Which is understandable in someone else\u2019s airspace.   Updated at 6.57pm GMT    6.51pm    The atmosphere in and around many of the stadiums at the Qatar World Cup has been oddly flat. That\u2019s not the case tonight. It was clear outside the Al Thumama Stadium more than three hours before kickoff that US supporters would be vastly outnumbered and it\u2019s even clearer now inside the 44,400-seat venue, where Iran have just emerged from the tunnel for their warm-ups to deafening roars and an ear-splitting cacophony of vuvuzelas and drums straight out of South Africa 2010.  The United States were always going to face an uphill climb tonight \u2013 needing three points against Asia\u2019s highest ranked team in their own region to keep their tournament alive \u2013 but the hostile atmosphere is guaranteed to make it that much tougher.     6.48pm    Fox Sports joins the long list of people/organizations who have not listened properly to the lyrics of the Bruce Springsteen classic as they belt out Born In The USA in the lead-up to the match.      6.46pm    Peter Oh emails in about the Gio Reyna selection controversy. \u201cNever mind the geopolitics. More likely to make-or-break the US\u2019s chances tonight are the Gio-politics,\u201d he chortles.      6.44pm    Prediction time: I put USA\u2019s chances of advancing at around 38% (weirdly I just checked Predicto-fest FiveThirtyEight and they have exactly the same odds). Their midfielders have been excellent so far this tournament and are a great sign for the future, but that lack of cutting edge is a nagging worry. And I suspect the true Iran are the team that beat Wales rather than the one who were thumped by England. I think that 6-2 opening loss had to be influenced by their brave decision not to sing the national anthem. The possibility of personal repercussions probably don\u2019t help you concentrate on a crucial World Cup match.      6.35pm    The Iranian fans are very loud in the stadium tonight, armed with World Cup 2010 co-star Mr A Vuvuzela. They were also in fine voice against Wales as the team scored a crucial victory amid protests back home:      6.28pm    The only other World Cup game between these two sides was at France \u201898, amid ongoing political tension between Washington and Tehran.In his Guardian match report from Lyon, Richard Williams described the opening minutes of the group game as being filled with the \u201cfierce noise of the Iranian crowd\u201d and a \u201cblizzard of high speed attacks\u201d by the US.It was Iran who took the lead through Estili, and the celebrations after his header \u201cshook the foundations of Stade de Gerland, if not the Islamic Republic,\u201d said Williams. A second Iran goal followed from Mahdavikia, before the US forward McBride scored a consolation goal, despite a scramble to keep his effort out. Not long after, the referee blew the whistle, confirming Iran\u2019s historic win.You can read more on the game here.    Updated at 6.36pm GMT    6.22pm   Iran team news  Goalkeeper Alireza Beiranvand is back in the team after suffering a concussion against England in Iran\u2019s opener.  Iran starting XI: Beiranvand, Rezaeian, Majid Hosseini, Pouraliganji, Mohammadi, Noorollahi, Ezatolahi, Hajsafi, Gholizadeh, Azmoun, Taremi. Subs: Moharrami, Khalilzadeh, Ansarifard, Amiri, Niazmand, Kanaani, Ghoddos, Cheshmi, Torabi, Karimi, Abedzadeh, Hossein Hosseini, Jalali.  Updated at 6.34pm GMT    6.10pm   USA team news  Youth knows no pain: Berhalter has named the youngest starting XI at Qatar. Josh Sargent is the man charged with leading the attack, replacing Haji Wright. And Walker Zimmerman, who gave away the penalty against Wales, is replaced by Cameron Carter-Vickers. As Chad Noyes notes by email: \u201cIt\u2019s the first time the US have fielded a lineup that includes ZERO players based in the MLS. Every player on the field for us today is based in Europe.\u201d  USA starting XI: 1-Matt Turner, 2-Sergi\u00f1o Dest, 4-Tyler Adams (capt.), 5-Antonee Robinson, 6-Yunus Musah, 8-Weston McKennie, 10-Christian Pulisic, 13-Tim Ream, 20-Cameron Carter-Vickers, 21-Tim Weah, 24-Josh Sargent. Substitutes: 12-Ethan Horvath, 25-Sean Johnson, 3-Walker Zimmerman, 7-Gio Reyna, 9-Jes\u00fas Ferreira, 11-Brenden Aaronson, 14-Luca de la Torre, 15-Aaron Long, 16-Jordan Morris, 17-Cristian Roldan, 18-Shaq Moore, 19-Haji Wright, 22-DeAndre Yedlin, 23-Kellyn Acosta, 26-Joe Scally  Updated at 6.14pm GMT    6.04pm    As may have been mentioned once or 7,468 times in the build-up to this game, Iran and the US have a little \u2026 let\u2019s call it history. Both coaches have been asked about human rights in the two countries about as often as they\u2019ve been asked about their tactics. Paul MacInnes was at a stormy press conference given by Iran manager Carlos Quieroz yesterday and then hopped over to see Gregg Berhalter give his views:      5.56pm    There were two other games earlier today, and they decided USA\u2019s (potential) opponents in the last 16. As expected, the Netherlands beat Qatar comfortably to go through as group winners, while Senegal came from behind to beat Ecuador and advance. The Netherlands will play the runners up in USA\u2019s group and Senegal the winners. So, if the US do beat Iran to advance tonight, they will probably play the Dutch. Probably.        5.51pm    One of the more intriguing storylines in the run-up to today\u2019s USA-Iran game has been a claim by former US striker (and part-time Guardian columnist) Eric Wynalda around Gio Reyna\u2019s lack of action at the tournament. Berhalter says the Dortmund player is carrying an injury while Wynalda says he has spoken to Reyna\u2019s father and that is not the case \u2013 and the situation is causing \u201cinternal strife\u201d in the US camp. Berhalter addressed the issue on Monday. \u201cWhat I\u2019d say is: I\u2019ll leave it to you to decide if I asked Gio to lie about it,\u201d Berhalter told reporters. \u201cThat\u2019s just not who I am. That\u2019s not what I represent. So if you have to take Eric\u2019s word or my word or whatever, feel free, but I know what happened and that\u2019s not what I represent. Like every other person, Gio is a member of this team that we care deeply for and we know can help the team. It\u2019s a matter of when he can help us and how he can help us.\u201d The US have impressed many observers with their approach play in this World Cup - they just lack someone to finish the chances they create, a problem that cost them against Wales and England. Berhalter has not yet said who will play up front against Iran. \u201cI think [the US strikers have] been OK,\u201d Berhalter said. \u201cWhen we\u2019re evaluating the performance in the first game, Josh had a good chance at the near post and, looking at the second game, Haji was very effective on the defensive end of the game, had some good runs into the channel, very lively. Perhaps there were a couple of times when we could have been more effective with the movement in the penalty box.\u201d     5.40pm   Who needs what today  USA: A simple one. They must beat Iran to qualify, the result in Group B\u2019s other match \u2013 England v Wales \u2013 is irrelevant to their chances. Iran: Currently second in the group, a win against the USA will put Iran through to the World Cup second round for the first time in their history. A draw against the USA will also be enough for them, provided Wales fail to beat England. England: A win against Wales will see England top the group. A draw will guarantee qualification. In fact, England will progress with any result except for a defeat by Wales of more than three goals. Wales: Wales must beat England and hope that Iran and the USA draw. If the USA v Iran match ends with a winner, then Wales must beat England by four goals or more to knock them out directly. Wales have not beaten England since 1984, and have never managed a winning margin of four goals or more against their nearest neighbors. You can get a full rundown of the permutations from the other World Cup groups here:      5.30pm   Preamble  Hello! Given the US\u2019s so-so qualifying campaign, many fans would have been happy before the tournament if they knew Gregg Berhalter\u2019s team would have their fate in their own hands going into the final group game. And yet, things could have been a lot easier if they had managed to follow up their impressive first-half against Wales with a decent second 45 minutes. And, against England, turned their dominance into goals.  But we\u2019ve known for a long time that the lack of a true goalscorer is this young team\u2019s main problem \u2013 and that\u2019s unlikely to be resolved in the [checks watch] 90 minutes before kick-off. Having said all that, this talented generation of players will peak in 2026, when the US co-host the World Cup, and even if they go out today, there are signs that the foundations are strong (whether Gregg Berhalter survives is another question). USA\u2019s World Cup so far:  In the opener, the US came storming out the gates and looked like they would carve up Wales for a convincing victory after Tim Weah\u2019s goal. But the Americans faded badly in the second period and the game ended in a 1-1 draw. USA then faced England, and maintained their unbeaten record against the Three Lions at the World Cup. The Americans were the better team but could not covert chances in a 0-0 draw.   Updated at 5.38pm GMT "

                    "body": "Kim Min-jae describes it as \u201cone of the greatest moments in my life\u201d, and it certainly made for an unusual scene, quite the entrance. The imposing South Korea centre-half has taken Serie A by storm since signing for Napoli in the summer and he intends to do likewise at the World Cup. But before he looks forward \u2013 South Korea kick off against Uruguay on Thursday \u2013 he wants to look back, to reflect on when it all started.\nKim had to do things the hard way. The boy from Tongyeong, a small city on Korea\u2019s south coast, was thrilled to have received his first call-up to the South Korea under-17s team in 2012 but it meant a long journey to the Paju national football centre at the other end of the country.\nSome of his teammates would travel the night before and others on the morning of the meet. It was more difficult for Kim. His parents worked around the clock to run a little sushi restaurant in Tongyeong and getting him up north on time was always going to be a challenge.\n\nKim\u2019s father had the solution, even if it was a slightly less than perfect one. He would combine dropping Kim off with a business trip to the East Sea and they would take the restaurant\u2019s fish-transportation truck. It meant setting off in the middle of the night because the truck\u2019s top speed was nothing to get excited about and the journey would last seven hours. But they made it.\n\u201cThe truck was really, really big, about 15 to 20 tons,\u201d Kim says. \u201cIt had a water tank where they could put fresh fish. I remember the day so clearly because the excitement was huge. I was only sorry that my dad then had to go to another city to drop off some fish.\n\u201cIt was my first call-up to a national team, I was very young and I was a bit shy and ashamed to arrive like this. The other kids came in normal cars. But it was a very good story for me. I am close to my father and these are the kind of moments that have made me who I am.\u201d\nKim can tell plenty of tales about his humble background. How, for example, he would wear hand-me-down boots from the older boys during his schooldays because his parents could not afford new ones. When he dropped out of Yonsei University in his second year to pursue a career in professional football \u2013 he had studied sport, leisure and physical education \u2013 he said it was because he was impatient to help his parents financially.\nBut the hardships and sacrifices have long since come to feel worthwhile. The 26-year-old has hit the big time at Napoli after his \u20ac19m move from Fenerbahce, making the club\u2019s fans forget the sale of Kalidou Koulibaly to Chelsea.\n\nKim has not missed a beat during Napoli\u2019s march into an eight-point lead at the top of Serie A and their progress to the Champions League last 16. He was named by EA Sports as the Serie A player of the month for September and given the same honour by the Italian Footballers\u2019 Association for October. This is not supposed to happen to players with no previous experience of Europe\u2019s elite divisions.\nIf Kim\u2019s hero status in Tongyeong is well-established \u2013 there is a placard in the city that celebrates his status as a South Korea international \u2013 he now stands to become a poster boy for Asian football at the World Cup.\nWhat marks Kim out is his hulking 6ft 3in frame. \u201cIt\u2019s not difficult to recognise me on the street in Naples,\u201d he says with a smile, as he considers how he sometimes has to stay at home to draw breath in the football-crazy city. His nickname of \u201cthe Monster\u201d is well established, given to him by fans and media at the beginning of his career. \u201cI really like it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt sums up my positive attributes as a defender.\u201d\nThere is also his pace and comfort on the ball, not to mention his determination and obsession with learning \u2013 from his international and domestic managers, Paulo Bento and Luciano Spalletti respectively; from the strikers he faces. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to defending against Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez in the Uruguay game,\u201d Kim says. Cristiano Ronaldo is also in his sights. South Korea play Portugal in their final group game. Their other opponents are Ghana.\n\u201cNever stop dreaming, time won\u2019t wait for you,\u201d reads a tattoo on Kim\u2019s left arm, which speaks volumes. He also has Carpe diem inked on to his chest. \u201cOur main goal is to pass the group stage,\u201d Kim says, and South Korea have done it twice, most memorably as the co-hosts in 2002 when they reached the semi-finals.\nKim was too young to take it in but part of his preparations for Qatar has involved rewatching old matches in which South Korea have upset the odds. One was the 1-0 win over Portugal in the final group game in 2002, when Park Ji-sung scored.\n\u201cI really loved that,\u201d Kim says. \u201cYou could see the desire in the players\u2019 eyes. I was very impressed by how the right-sided defender, Song Chong-gug, played Lu\u00eds Figo. Because I\u2019m a defender that was the part I focused on.\u201d\nThe conversation turns towards Son Heung-min, South Korea\u2019s superstar and captain, who sparked a national panic after he fractured his eye socket playing for Tottenham at the start of the month. He underwent surgery and hopes to play in a protective face mask.\n\u201cEveryone was devastated by the news but we tried to put a positive spin on it when we heard he would be joining the squad,\u201d Kim says. \u201cHe is a pivotal player that has to be in the team no matter what.\u201d\n\nKim played with Son for South Korea\u2019s under-23s at the Asian Games in 2018 \u2013 Son was an overage wildcard \u2013 and much of the coverage that followed their gold medal zeroed in on how the squad, and Son in particular, had secured an exemption from 21 months of military service. There was still a requirement for them to complete the basic four weeks\u2019 soldier training.\n\u201cI will be joining the army next summer,\u201d Kim says. \u201cBut now I\u2019m doing some social contributions via Zoom. I give talks to young Korean footballers. I tell them how I felt at their age, how to get to where I am. I try to get my knowledge across as much as possible during a one-hour session. But most of the time it\u2019s not enough so I do it two times for every player.\u201d\nKim was tracked by a host of clubs in Europe after a stellar season with Beijing Guoan in 2019 and he eventually went to Fenerbahce in the summer of 2021. His Premier League suitors have included Spurs, Everton and Leicester. But everything felt right when Napoli called and the results so far have been spectacular. Title fever is brewing. Could Napoli be set to add to their triumphs of 1987 and 1990 when Diego Maradona was a deity in their colours?\n\u201cI\u2019ve been told all about the Maradona story, how he brought the team to glory,\u201d Kim says. \u201cBut what amazes me is how \u2018Maradona 10\u2019 shirts are still sold at the stadium and on every street corner. The fans are still wearing them. It just shows the levels of love and respect for him.\u201d"

                    "body": "For 18 minutes, the Socceroos dared to dream. For 18 minutes they had scored from open play at a World Cup for the first time since Brazil 2014, when Tim Cahill conjured that exquisite volley against the Netherlands. For 18 minutes they led a match at the finals, something not achieved since that same fixture in Porto Alegre \u2013 and that was only for four. And for 18 minutes they had done those things against France, the defending champions.\nThis match was the domain of Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, of Olivier Giroud and Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9. Except that for 18 minutes it was the realm of Craig Goodwin, a concept so surreal the packed media tribunes at the Al Janoub Stadium practically shook in psychedelia. Cognitive processes became frazzled. Twitter exploded. Pubs across Australia woke up the neighbours who did not yet know that this unfathomable thing was happening 10,000km away.\n\nThe Socceroos had always been up against it to take anything from their opening fixture. But, in the ninth minute, when Harry Souttar had provided that long diagonal ball to the right wing, and Mathew Leckie had cut inside and crossed to Goodwin for that superb finish, they allowed a sliver of possibility that something wonderful might happen.\nOnce the drugs wore off and the defence wilted to a concoction much more potent than theirs, the comedown felt all the more harrowing. The 4-1 loss was not unexpected; few would have predicted anything else. But that\u2019s what happens when hope is involved.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why they\u2019re world champions,\u201d a deflated coach Graham Arnold said afterwards. \u201cWe started the game very well. Physically they were just so much bigger and faster and stronger than us. The boys did everything they could and that\u2019s all I can ask.\u201d\n\nAdrien Rabiot\u2019s equaliser in the 27th burst the bubble. As nice as those 18 minutes were, reality had been coming. France had been laying siege to Australia\u2019s goal and continued to do so until the final whistle.\nIt is difficult to call this performance anything else but admirable. The nature of the 4-1 rout will have come as a shock to the players, many of them young with little experience on big stages such as this.\n\nThat is certainly the case for Nathaniel Atkinson, who was deployed at right-back with one of the less enviable tasks in existence, and Mbapp\u00e9 was not keen on being contained.\n\u201cHe did his best against one of the best players in the world,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cLeckie and Jackson Irvine helped him. That was the plan, that when Mbapp\u00e9 got the ball the three of them got out there and helped. But how do you stop someone so quick? It\u2019s very difficult. It\u2019s a great lesson for the kid.\u201d\n\nThat is how the Socceroos would be best to treat this. France have a hold on Group D but second place is there for the taking. Tunisia\u2019s draw with Denmark has heightened the stakes, though a defeat of Tunisia on Saturday would mean next Wednesday\u2019s final tie with Denmark is very much a live opportunity.\nArnold will know this, and the challenge for him now is to somehow resurrect the positive mindset that had been a pre-tournament fixture.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve built the belief, and the energy and the energy and focus, in the last week since we\u2019ve been in camp,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cThe way we started, I think they believed. We just got punished by our mistakes, and the delivery of their crosses was right on target. That\u2019s that game gone, and the other result was a draw, so now it\u2019s about winning on Saturday.\u201d\n\nArnold emptied his bench, bringing on Jason Cummings and Awer Mabil and giving runs to Milos Degenek, Keanu Baccus and Garang Kuol, the latter of whom became Australia\u2019s youngest World Cup player in history. The 18-year-old will surely see more game time this tournament, and tired bodies may mean changes against Tunisia.\n\n\u201cWe can do, that\u2019s why we\u2019ve got 26 players,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cI just felt that tonight, having Harry Souttar [was ideal] for the size of Giroud and these players. But we\u2019ve got the option of obviously changing players, and making sure we get some fresh ones out there.\u201d\nOne could pick through individual performances, dissect what went wrong and who didn\u2019t do what. But really, against this sort of opponent, what is the point? France may be beset with problems \u2013 of injuries and divisions and coaching uncertainty \u2013 but they are still France. Their players are regular starters for Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid and Bayern Munich. Goodwin is a regular starter for Adelaide United, Leckie for Melbourne City. Only Mabil, for La Liga side Cadiz, plays in one of Europe\u2019s top five leagues. Kuol is now on the books of Newcastle United.\nThis was a walkover waiting to happen. But for those precious 18 minutes, the Socceroos were winners."

                    "body": "Three years have now passed but Mako Vunipola\u2019s memories of the 2019 Rugby World Cup final remain horribly clear. Things did not end well for England on the last occasion he faced a South Africa pack and the Saracens loosehead is seeking a more positive experience when he encounters the Springbok forwards again at Twickenham this Saturday.\nEven the mere sight of a green jersey gives Vunipola vivid flashbacks to Yokohama, where the Springbok scrum suffocated England\u2019s world title ambitions at source. \u201cThat game will probably stay with me for the rest of my life, not only because of how we lost but because of how they imposed themselves on us,\u201d acknowledged the 31-year-old, one of four starting changes to the home side in the wake of the 25-25 draw with New Zealand.\n\nThe Boks, to quote Eddie Jones, \u201cwill be coming through the front door\u201d this time as well, hence the strategic recalls for the experienced Vunipola and his club-mate Jamie George in the front row and the addition of a third lineout option in Northampton\u2019s Alex Coles at blindside flanker. Another Saint, Tommy Freeman, is back on the wing to help England defuse the wider aerial threats presented by the world champions.\nIt is up front, though, where South Africa\u2019s \u201cBomb Squad\u201d most enjoy flexing their muscles and Vunipola is in no hurry to revisit the sense of post-match deflation England endured in Japan. \u201cSitting in the changing room afterwards was tough. If we\u2019d played our best and they\u2019d still beaten us, I could live with that. But the fact we didn\u2019t fire a shot \u2026 that is probably the toughest thing to reflect on.\n\u201cAfterwards you watch it back and review it but it\u2019s too late by then. You have to have the ability to adapt on the field. On that day we didn\u2019t.\u201d\nSouth Africa will be without one or two familiar faces, with this weekend\u2019s Test taking place outside the official November Test window, but the presence of, among others, Eben Etzebeth will still guarantee another heavy-duty encounter. \u201cHe\u2019s very physical, confrontational and tough and he\u2019ll keep coming all day,\u201d Vunipola said. \u201cWe have to be ready for that. As a pack there are numerous players that can set the tone for them. It\u2019s a great challenge. You can either walk towards them or shy away and probably never play international rugby again.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the late confidence engendered by their dramatic three-try finish against the All Blacks, however, England believe their own forward talisman Maro Itoje is ready to give a performance that will cause even Etzebeth to stop and think.\n\u201cI think we are seeing the second coming of Maro,\u201d suggested Jones, the head coach. \u201cHe came out like a comet, but like all good players there is a period where you stabilise. Now he is going up again \u2013 we will see the best of Maro on Saturday.\n\u201cAt his best, he is the best defensive player in the world and we want to see more of that. There was a certain American basketballer, Kobe Bryant, whose focus was on being the best defensive player. Maro has that in him.\u201d\nVunipola, who has played alongside Itoje for years, also feels his teammate is still improving. \u201cThere are times where maybe he\u2019s over thought things and tried to solve everything by himself but that\u2019s just the growing pains of a young player. He\u2019s now a massive leader for us ... he\u2019s the one who leads the physicality in the forwards.\u201d\nWith Ellis Genge, Sam Simmonds, Luke Cowan-Dickie and Jack Nowell all poised to come off the bench, there is clear potential for England to finish strongly again if they can stand firm early on. Jack van Poortvliet has rightly been backed at scrum-half despite a difficult game against the All Blacks while Manu Tuilagi is set to win his 50th cap.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve selected a different side to neutralise their strengths and play to our strengths,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to fight and fight and fight and when we get a chance to break them we\u2019re going to have to take it. I\u2019ve never seen a Springbok team not turn up. That\u2019s just part of the game.\u201d"

                    "body": "\nThe Sele\u00e7\u00e3o are in full flight and, as you may have heard, enjoying themselves in the process. Their first-half evisceration of South Korea felt like a throwback, moments such as Richarlison\u2019s seal impression offering reminders of those days when nobody could rival Brazil for sheer fun. Even without Gabriel Jesus they retain a depth of attacking talent few can match, partly thanks to Neymar\u2019s Lazarus-like recovery from injury. Keep this up and a first World Cup since 2002 should be theirs, although there are caveats: they squeaked past Switzerland, the only practised tournament side they have faced, and Croatia should offer an even sterner test on Friday. Alisson Becker was also worked harder than he may have liked on Monday night, although he demonstrated the value of a top-class keeper in the process. Can anyone stop them?\n\n\nSometimes it feels France\u2019s plan is to send possession Kylian Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s way and say: \u201cYou do the rest.\u201d The problem for their opponents is that it tends to work. Anyone who can halt Mbapp\u00e9 may be able to stop Les Bleus but he is in virtually unplayable form and already looks a safe bet for the Golden Boot. Didier Deschamps will also be encouraged that the supporting cast is showing signs of life and France, who have scored nine goals across the three games in which he has selected a first-choice side, may be clicking at the right time. The evergreen Olivier Giroud adds a valuable balance while Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni has taken to life as their midfield linchpin. Further injuries would give Deschamps a headache but the core look in lean shape.\n\n\nThat wasn\u2019t so difficult, was it? Now that Fernando Santos has, perhaps terminally, cut the cord with Cristiano Ronaldo the tournament seems alive with possibility for Portugal. They were devastating against Switzerland, a rejuvenated frontline slicing their unusually loose opponents open at will and Gon\u00e7alo Ramos coming from nowhere to become a potential star of this winter. Beating decent Ghana and Uruguay sides in the group stage was further evidence of the weapons Santos has in his armoury, which include a potent substitute in Rafael Le\u00e3o. They will not be devastated at facing Morocco on Saturday, who spent 120 minutes on a highly rewarding but hugely exacting task in defeating Spain. Could Ronaldo\u2019s much-sought World Cup be won from the sidelines?\n\nGareth Southgate\u2019s players will find France a clear step up from several lower-key assignments but it would not take an over-active imagination to see them pull through on Saturday. There were rocky moments early on against Senegal but England have some of the best young players in the tournament \u2013 Jude Bellingham has announced himself as an essential pick \u2013 and are a gripping proposition when on the front foot. When they are denied space, much of their possession can appear sterile: France will know that and may be content to utilise their own speed through counterattacks. But Harry Kane has opened his account, the midfield looks well-balanced and defensive bloopers have been minimised: could it be coming home for Christmas?\n\nEvery Argentina match in Doha feels like appointment viewing, if not for the fare produced by Lionel Scaloni\u2019s team then for the jaw-dropping support that turns stadiums into pulsating places of worship. La Albiceleste have only shone in flashes but have done well to banish that remarkable defeat by Saudi Arabia, and one thing is clear: Lionel Messi is already enjoying his best World Cup, scoring three times and operating on a different level to everyone else. There are signs his younger teammates are raising theirs: Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez is showing why Manchester City brought him to the Etihad and the Benfica midfielder Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez looks an outstanding talent. They still need to put it together against the best but with supporters that make it feel like they have home advantage, Argentina have a chance.\n\n\nThere is a sense Louis van Gaal\u2019s team has flown beneath the radar so far but, like others, they are stirring at a convenient point. Critics accused them of boring football during an unremarkable group stage but Memphis Depay and Cody Gakpo \u2013 the latter was certainly exempt from criticism in earlier games \u2013 shone against the USA and Denzel Dumfries was outstanding at right wing-back. Frenkie de Jong was also back to his best and their tie with Argentina, a reprise of previous classics, looks finely poised. The Netherlands are unbeaten in 19 games since Van Gaal\u2019s return and, while he would still like greater control in possession, can be rapier-like in the transition. If Messi is to land the biggest prize, he has a stiff hurdle to overcome on Friday.\n\nMorocco showed in the group stage that they are a serious team and everyone is awake to that now after they dumped Spain out. Walid Regragui oversees a tough, clever unit with extraordinary tactical discipline and an attack capable of the unexpected. The only goal they have conceded was a consolation in the win over Canada and that is some achievement given they have played Croatia, Belgium and Spain. Shutting out Portugal on Saturday would top the lot and Morocco have a chance. In Achraf Hakimi they possess a genuine star, while Luis Enrique can testify to the qualities of the midfield whirlwind, Azzedine Ounahi. And nobody can discount a flash of genius from Hakim Ziyech. Africa has never had a representative in the last four and Morocco are a win away from making history.\n\nYou know the old saying: never write off the Croatians. In all seriousness, Zlatko Dalic\u2019s team have a whiff of past Germany sides about them: they never know when they are beaten and, while they are creaking in some departments, few know their way around a tournament more adeptly. They were on the ropes against a sparky Japan but pulled through; Ivan Perisic\u2019s equaliser was a reminder that half this squad still boasts several World Cup finalists and that counts for plenty when fine margins need navigating. Whether they can handle Brazil\u2019s attacking tempo remains to be seen but it would be foolhardy to rule them out on Friday. One way or another, Croatia have a habit of making you play on their terms."

                    "body": "On 2 December 2010, I was hosting an event on behalf of the England 2018 World Cup bid outside City Hall in central London. It was toe-curlingly cold. My co-host, Charlotte Jackson, and I were joined by Peter Crouch and David Ginola among others to celebrate England\u2019s certain success \u2013 the first World Cup on home soil since \u201966. We were favourites. It was a good bid, albeit laced with that hubris that we often fail to acknowledge. They do actually play football in other countries. A small crowd were in some temporary seating as we beamed pictures back from Switzerland. We got word of the result 20 minutes before it was officially announced. The crowd had already started to ebb away when Sepp Blatter stood at the lectern and laboured over opening an envelope with the word Russia written on both sides.  The director shouted down my earpiece. \u201cJust fill for the next 10 minutes so the crowd stay for the 2022 result.\u201d Trying to retain a withering and despondent crowd in sub-zero temperatures proved too much for my broadcasting abilities. By the time Qatar was officially given the tournament we were talking to a couple of unsuspecting dog walkers. The hot chestnut seller by the river had a bigger audience. Even our guests had gone inside. We have heard a great deal about Qatar in the following 11 years. We\u2019ve been through the corruption allegations, the realisation that it\u2019s hot in the summer in the Middle East and the tragedy of the (disputed) number of migrant worker deaths. And now we have the complex job of working out how to cover it. On the Guardian Football Weekly podcast the other day I asked an open question about what we should do. I genuinely don\u2019t know the answer. Do we record one episode about human rights at the start of the tournament and then forget all about it and focus on the football? There will be countless journalists and ex-pros who don\u2019t even do that \u2013 before we even consider those taking money from Fifa to promote it. I was as guilty as anyone of nodding to the invasion of Crimea and the repression of political opposition in Russia before 2018 and then forgetting it all as England reached the semi-final. Should I have spent less time worrying about why the Croatians weren\u2019t tired and more questioning how this tournament was legitimising Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime? I have literally no idea what, if any, impact hosting the World Cup contributed to the horrifying scenes we see today. But I don\u2019t think I used my platform enough regardless of whether it would have made a jot of difference.  The latest Amnesty International report into private security firms who employ tens of thousands of migrant workers in Qatar is pretty damning. It says they are still subject to \u201cforced labour\u201d and a number of other abuses and it criticises Fifa for failing \u201cto put in place adequate processes\u201d to address these issues. So this time around should we break off our discussion of Harry Kane\u2019s late penalty to beat Iran to find out if the working conditions of migrants really have changed? After Ghana get retribution against Uruguay do we talk about what life is like for the LGBTQ+ community in Qatar? As Jonathan Wilson said on the podcast, this World Cup will be one of gear changes. Journalists and broadcasters will know workers died providing the stadiums from where they are reporting. \u201cHey Max,\u201d wrote someone on Twitter. \u201cI hope between now and the World Cup you can work out your duty as a \u2018journalist\u2019 when covering the tournament. Because your answer of \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019 is a little disappointing \u2026 Feels a bit of a cop out. Let\u2019s hope you can work out your job by the end of the year!\u201d Is it a cop out to be unsure of yourself on such complicated issues? Or is it good to be honest? Social media can be blamed for many things, one of which is a seeming desperation for journalists and pundits of all kinds \u2013 not just within sport \u2013 to have unequivocal opinions on everything. Outrage and fury certainly get more retweets than saying: \u201cIt\u2019s complicated and I\u2019m just not quite sure.\u201d Saying you don\u2019t know, or worse, that you were wrong about something, appears now to be an admission of complete failure.  The more understanding we get on the bleakness in sport below the surface, the less I really know how to cover it or what our priorities should be. Clearly this goes beyond Qatar. I routinely fail to mention Abu Dhabi\u2019s human rights abuses during my coverage of Manchester City. I want people to ask Eddie Howe about the number of people executed in Saudi Arabia. But to what end? To get him and the players to walk out on principle and the fans to follow? It goes beyond the Middle East and human rights \u2013 the gamblification of football, the racism, the misogyny, the worrying link to domestic and sexual violence. I don\u2019t check where all the money is coming from all the time. In December 2010, when that draw was made, social media hadn\u2019t permeated our lives to the extent that you could scroll through war crimes while you sit on the toilet. Dejan Lovren might have hated the idea of teaching children about being open-minded towards different sexualities. Matt Le Tissier might have engaged in conspiracy theories, but they had no way of telling me. I miss that blissful ignorance. I knew nothing of Qatar and I spent very little time thinking about human rights. \u201cIt was a different time\u201d people say, and it feels like it was to me. Perhaps I\u2019ll learn how to do my job by the time the World Cup begins. Now back to Frank Lampard\u2019s excuses, Diego Simeone\u2019s shithousery and Kalvin Phillips\u2019s Cornish pasty shoes."

                    "body": "  6.12pm    Nick Ames was at Education City Stadium. His report has landed, and here it is. Congratulations to Croatia, who will face either Argentina or the Netherlands in the semi-finals: let Rob Smyth be your MBM guide for that one. Commiserations to Brazil, who will always have Stockholm, Santiago, Mexico City, Pasadena and Yokohama. Thanks for reading this MBM.      6.07pm    A quick reminder to subscribe to our daily football email: Football Daily. Here\u2019s a snippet of the flippant nonsense you missed earlier.  The Netherlands stand between Lionel Messi and a semi-final showdown with Croatia. (We\u2019re pretty sure Brazil will at some point implode under the pressure of being Brazil, so why not on Friday afternoon.)    Updated at 6.08pm GMT    6.06pm    Post-match mailbag. \u201cC\u2019mon Croatia our boys have been great and deserve to go through. Our keeper is a champion. I\u2019m especially proud of him and the rest of the boys. Croatia were outclassed by Neymar, but the equaliser was inevitable. We did it!\u201d \u2013 Kat Stolica \u201cAs a Croatian, obviously I can\u2019t be happier! But, the bigger point is: almost inevitably, people perennially underestimate us. Well, by now they should know better! Kind regards from jubilant Croatia!\u201d \u2013 Tino Andic \u201cPoor match management from Brazil. How do you get caught so badly on a counter attack when you are leading with a couple of minutes to go?\u201d \u2013 Michael Hayen \u201cNeymar scores the best goal of the tournament and 40 minutes later he is out! A big loss for the tournament\u201d \u2013 Philip Murphy \u201cBrazil deserve to go home. Give them a medal for dancing\u201d \u2013 Jeff Sachs \u201cRoy Keane is going to be insufferable isn\u2019t he?\u201d \u2013 Zafar Sobhan \u201cFrederick Freaking Forsyth. Wow. Whew\u201d \u2013 Eric Peterson (second-half kick-off)  Updated at 6.17pm GMT    5.58pm    There seems to be a general sense of disbelief in the stadium. Many of the Brazil fans remain in situ, perhaps to sportingly congratulate Croatia as the delighted victors pose with their flag for a squad photo. Or maybe they\u2019re just in shock. Brazil surely thought they\u2019d made it to the semis, with Neymar and Antony doing the professional thing in running the clock down. But then, with Fred preparing to break through the Croatian back line, Jo\u0161ko Gvardiol made a crunching tackle, Luka Modric sent his team off on one last counter \u2026 and here we all are. What a World Cup story this is! One for the ages \u2026 but one that could take Brazil some getting over. Neymar is in floods. Absolutely stricken with grief. He crumples to the floor and it takes Thiago Silva some effort to haul him up and into his arms. It\u2019s lovely to watch Croatia celebrate; it\u2019s not so easy watching Brazil come to terms with what\u2019s happened.     5.53pm    Croatia cavort in delight! They\u2019ve done a number on the pre-tournament favourites. Luka Modric smiles beatifically. Neymar stares at a point approximately one thousand yards into the distance. What a goal he scored! One that so nearly took his country one step closer to that elusive sixth title! But Brazil will have to wait at least another four years to slake a thirst that stretches back to 2002. The Education City Stadium in Al Rayyan falls quiet, the Croatian fans apart. The majority within had wanted Brazil to win \u2026 but they haven\u2019t got their way. On the BBC, Mark Chapman observes that the \u201cair has gone out of this stadium big time.\u201d A lot of footage of Brazilian fans in tears. You\u2019ll be seeing that replayed over and over again for the next four years at least.   Updated at 6.00pm GMT    5.48pm   RESULT: Croatia 1-1 Brazil (Croatia win 4-2 on pens)  \u2026 and Neymar didn\u2019t even get to take a penalty. The 2018 runners-up make the last four again! Brazil fall to European opposition again!   Updated at 5.54pm GMT    5.47pm    PENALTIES: Croatia 4-2 Brazil. Marquinhos slams his penalty off the base of the left-hand post, and Croatia are through to the semi-finals again! Brazil are out!     5.46pm    Marquinhos must score to keep Brazil in the competition. He steps up, and \u2026     5.46pm    PENALTIES: Croatia 4-2 Brazil. Orsic fires a forensic penalty into the bottom left. Alisson went the correct way, but again couldn\u2019t reach a perfectly placed effort!     5.45pm    PENALTIES: Croatia 3-2 Brazil. Pedro walks up, and he doesn\u2019t look confident. But he is! He stutters, sends Livakovic to the right, and clips into the left. This is just his fourth cap!     5.44pm    PENALTIES: Croatia 3-1 Brazil. Modric strokes a lovely penalty into the bottom left, sending Alisson the wrong way.     5.44pm    PENALTIES: Croatia 2-1 Brazil. Huge pressure on Casemiro \u2026 who belts an unstoppable penalty into the bottom left. Livakovic goes the right way, but can\u2019t get anywhere near it, as the ball ripples the inside side netting.     5.43pm    PENALTIES: Croatia 2-0 Brazil. Majer slams down the middle, sending Alisson to his right.     5.42pm    PENALTIES: Croatia 1-0 Brazil. Rodrygo takes an elongated run-up, and hits a poor effort towards the bottom right. Livakovic saves!     5.41pm    PENALTIES: Croatia 1-0 Brazil. Vlasic up first. He sends it down the middle, into the roof of the net.     5.40pm    The captains Thiago Silva and Luka Modric embrace at the coin toss. Then Modric wins it. He opts for Croatia to take first. The penalties will be taken in front of the Brazil fans.     5.38pm    Brazil looked like they were heading into the semi-finals thanks to Neymar\u2019s quite sensational goal. But Croatia never know when they\u2019re beaten, and Bruno Petkovic\u2019s late equaliser keeps the 2018 runners-up in the 2022 tournament. It\u2019s no more than they deserve for their contribution to an always-enthralling match, and a particularly entertaining period of extra time. Penalties ahoy! More drama for certain!      5.36pm   EXTRA TIME, FULL TIME: Croatia 1-1 Brazil  To paraphrase Sir Alex Ferguson: Croatia, eh? Bloody hell!   Updated at 5.40pm GMT    5.35pm    ET 30 min +2: Neymar loops the free kick into the mixer. Some head tennis. The ball drops to Casemiro on the left-hand corner of the six-yard box. What a chance! Casemiro shoots \u2026 but the ever-heroic Livakovic parries!     5.34pm    ET 30 min +1: Antony dribbles down the right. He checks back and is cleaned out by Perisic. One last free kick. One last chance for Brazil to nick it. Everyone into the Croatia box!     5.33pm    ET 30 min: Majer sends a long-distance rake well wide left of Alisson\u2019s goal. There will be two more minutes.     5.33pm    ET 29 min: Neymar fouls Lovren in the centre circle. Modric looks to take the free kick quickly but is whistled back by the referee. Penalties loom now \u2026 unless somebody can find something really dramatic?     5.32pm    ET 28 min: Petkovic is booked for removing his shirt in the throes of ecstasy. He\u2019ll care not one jot, I\u2019ll be bound!     5.31pm   GOAL! Croatia 1-1 Brazil (Petkovic 117)  Orsic tears down the left, sent into space by Modric. He reaches the edge of the Brazil box and rolls infield for Petkovic, who shoots first time. A slight deflection sends the ball whistling into the bottom left! Alisson can\u2019t get there in time!    Updated at 5.36pm GMT    5.29pm    ET 26 min: Gvardiol\u2019s loose ball looks like letting Fred scamper clear down the inside-right channel, but the young defender recovers with a sensational tackle. And what an important tackle it is, because \u2026     5.28pm    ET 25 min: Neymar and Antony play it short, then the former draws a clumsy foul from Petkovic. Brazil are more than happy with this bitty state of affairs. The clock ticks on.     5.27pm    ET 24 min: Brozovic makes way for Orsic. When play restarts, the always-on Antony wins a corner off Majer down the right.     5.26pm    ET 23 min: Perisic drops a shoulder and knocks the ball past Antony down the left, but can\u2019t win the resulting footrace. Antony holds his line and ushers the ball out for a goal kick.      5.24pm    ET 21 min: Lovren crosses from a deep position on the right. He swings in a good one, and Budimir attacks it, but Thiago Silva rises highest to head clear.     5.23pm    ET 20 min: Before the corner can be taken, Budimir replaces Sosa, who have to go for broke now. Nothing comes of the set piece.     5.23pm    ET 19 min: Perisic whips in a cross from the left. Nobody in chequerboard can connect. Neymar tries to launch a counter but brings down Gvardiol. Croatia come back at Brazil, Modric sending Fred off for the paper and a pack of fags with an outrageous change-of-direction dummy down the left that wins a corner.     5.21pm    ET 17 min: Probably worth pointing out that Brazil were too busy pogoing in sheer delight at Neymar\u2019s goal to break out the choreographed dance moves. \u201cInteresting to see Neymar\u2019s celebration after scoring there!\u201d writes Billy Ditchburn. \u201cActually looked like a spontaneous expression of joy and relief, and not a prerecorded snippet of self congratulatory smugness.\u201d     5.19pm    Croatia get the second period of extra time underway. They\u2019ve replaced Kovacic with Majer, while Brazil switch out Eder Militao and Paqueta with Alex Sandro and Fred.     5.18pm    That was one hell of a goal by Neymar! Never mind dropping deep to start the move. Never mind executing two one-twos en route to breaking into the box. What about that finish, straining every sinew to brush off Sosa, rounding the keeper Livakovic, and having the presence of mind to lift his shot, with Sosa sliding along the line in a desperate attempt to block. Wow!     5.15pm   EXTRA TIME, HALF TIME: Croatia 0-1 Brazil  Not a bad time to equal Pele\u2019s all-time record for the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o, huh? That\u2019s number 77 for Neymar, and one of the most important.   Updated at 5.22pm GMT    5.14pm   GOAL! Croatia 0-1 Brazil (Neymar 105+1)  Brazil suddenly spark into life just as half time in extra time looms! Neymar drops deep, exchanges passes with Rodrygo and Pedro, then powers into the box, rounding Livakovic on the right and absolutely roofing home from a tight angle!    Updated at 5.18pm GMT    5.12pm    ET 15 min: Rodrygo jigs in from the left and lays off to Danilo, who flays a dismal long-range effort many miles over the bar, and wide to boot. A slight hint of desperation from the tournament favourites there.   Updated at 5.14pm GMT    5.11pm    ET 13 min: Kovacic dribbles hard down the inside-left channel but runs into a cul-de-sac. Brazil attempt to counter, but Neymar is tackled by Lovren. Crunch! Modric sends Croatia off on the counter-counter, and Petkovic dribbles into the box from the left. He rolls across to Brozovic, teeing him up on the edge of the D. A huge chance \u2026 but Brozovic blazes wildly over the bar!     5.08pm    ET 11 min: Casemiro crosses from the right. Pedro, on the penalty spot, attempts the spectacular overhead kick, but slips midway through execution. Livakovic gathers.   Updated at 5.10pm GMT    5.06pm    ET 9 min: Rodrygo curls in from the left. Paqueta looks to meet it, sliding in at the far post, but he can\u2019t get ahead of Sosa, who ushers the ball out for a goal kick.     5.05pm    ET 8 min: Modric nutmegs Pedro out on the right. Or maybe he dinked the ball around him cutely. Either way, lovely skill from Croatia\u2019s star turn. He\u2019s 37!     5.03pm    ET 6 min: Danilo crosses from the left. Sosa heads clear. Brazil are pressing forward but there\u2019s no way through.     5.02pm    ET 5 min: He\u2019s happy to let Neymar get away with a couple of frustrated swipes at Brozovic, too. Michael Oliver in a very laissez-faire mood.     5.02pm    ET 4 min: Antony\u2019s really not happy now, as he knocks the ball past Sosa only to be crudely bodychecked. The referee is happy to let things slide.     5.01pm    ET 3 min: Thankfully things don\u2019t look too bad for Paqueta, and he\u2019s up and running again. Then Antony cops one in the face from Sosa \u2013 a finger hooks the side of his mouth in the angling style \u2013 but he doesn\u2019t even get a free kick. He\u2019s not happy.     4.59pm    ET 2 min: Danilo launches a long ball down the right, forcing Sosa, pressured by Antony, to head behind for a corner. Neymar takes, and Pedro connects, but his header is weak and wafts out on the left. Paqueta tries to keep the ball in play, and rolls his ankle, or twists his knee, as he fails to complete his task. He\u2019s down getting a spot of treatment.     4.57pm    Brazil get the first period of extra time underway. No changes.     4.56pm    As the teams regroup and wait for extra time, Neymar sits down. Marquinhos hauls him back to his feet unceremoniously. Shades of Alf Ramsey, who didn\u2019t allow his England players to sit down after 90 minutes of the 1966 final, in order to show the prone West Germany they weren\u2019t as tired. Even if they were. And people say Alex Ferguson invented mind games.     4.52pm   FULL TIME: Croatia 0-0 Brazil  \u2026 and that\u2019s that. Extra time it is!   Updated at 4.53pm GMT    4.52pm    90 min +4: Antony dribbles in from the right and sends a weak effort towards the bottom right. Easy for Livakovic.     4.51pm    90 min +3: Rodrygo attempts to launch an attack and is cynically clipped by Modric, who is extremely fortunate to escape a booking. Had he been yellow carded, he\u2019d miss the semi-final should Croatia make it.     4.50pm    90 min +2: Antony tries to burst into space down the inside-right channel. He accidentally handles and Croatia take their sweet time over the resulting free kick. They\u2019ll be more than happy to take this to extra time.     4.49pm    90 min +1: Rodrygo\u2019s presence forces Livakovic into the concession of another corner. Croatia clear it with ease.      4.48pm    90 min: There will be four added minutes.     4.48pm    89 min: Rodrygo drives down the left but can\u2019t get past Juranovic. Same old story. \u201cCeltic\u2019s Champions League campaign might not have been the most glorious but apparently it enabled Juranovic to study Vicinius Jnr and determine his weaknesses in a manner reminiscent of the Terminator,\u201d writes Gerry Scott. \u201cI did not predict that.\u201d     4.46pm    88 min: Kovacic drops deep and nearly releases Modric down the inside-left channel. Then a low cross finds Petkovic on the edge of the Brazil D, but the substitute striker can\u2019t sort his feet out. Brazilian hearts were in mouths for a nanosecond there!     4.45pm    86 min: Antony works down the right and cuts back for Militao, who whips a low shot wide right from the edge of the box. In fact it\u2019s deflected out for a corner, but nothing comes of that.     4.44pm    85 min: Silva gives Alisson a hospital pass, and the Brazil keeper hacks out for a throw. Nothing comes of the mild panic, but it illustrates the palpable nerves in the stadium as we reach the business end of this quarter final.     4.42pm    84 min: That\u2019s Richarlison\u2019s last contribution. He makes way for Pedro. \u201cCroatia are playing this brilliantly, turning Brazil\u2019s samba stars into a bunch of wallflowers waiting impatiently to be invited onto the dancefloor,\u201d riffs Justin Kavanagh. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly Friday Night Fever: You Should be Dancing, Brazil; but Croatia are Staying Alive.\u201d     4.40pm    82 min: Rodrygo flashes in a cross from the left. Richarlison eyebrows over the bar from 12 yards. Gvardiol wasn\u2019t letting him get any closer.     4.39pm    80 min: Antony turns on the jets to burn past Sosa on the right. Casemiro arrives to help and crosses deep. Rodrygo cuts back for Paqueta, who batters a low shot from the edge of the box towards the bottom left. Livakovic smothers brilliantly. Any fumble and it\u2019d have been a tap-in for Neymar. \u201cStudents of the Roy Keane School of Samba must be delighted with the absence of rhythm in this match so far,\u201d quips Peter Oh.      4.36pm    78 min: Brazil are attempting to pick up the pace. Richarlison drives at the Croatian back line only to have the ball stolen off his toe by Sosa. He hops around in impotent frustration.     4.35pm    77 min: Marquinhos is booked for wrestling Modric as the Croatian maestro attempts to launch a counter attack. No complaints.     4.34pm    76 min: Rodrygo and Richarlison combine briskly down the inside-left channel before releasing Neymar. Brazil\u2019s biggest star enters the box \u2026 but yet again can\u2019t beat Livakovic, albeit from a tight angle. Great save. Nothing comes of the resulting corner.   Updated at 4.41pm GMT    4.32pm    74 min: Antony cuts in from the right and dives in the environs of Perisic. The referee\u2019s not buying it. Neymar then dribbles down the left wing but can\u2019t diddle his way past the immense Juranovic. Brazil aren\u2019t doing very much at the moment. Croatia will be the far happier side.     4.30pm    72 min: Croatia continue to be patient. Then suddenly Modric creams a pass down the right for Juranovic, who pings infield for Kramaric. His shot is blocked then cleared, and that\u2019s his last act of the evening: he makes way for Petkovic, while Vlasic comes on for Pasalic.     4.28pm    70 min: Croatia slow it down again. They\u2019re flatly refusing to play into Brazil\u2019s hands, South Korea style.     4.26pm    68 min: Casemiro clips the heel of Kramaric and goes into the book. That looked a little bit harsh.     4.24pm    66 min: Lovren and Gvardiol confuse each other on the edge of the Croatia box, allowing Paqueta to nip in between them. Paqueta is suddenly one on one with Livakovic, but yet again the Croatia keeper proves unbeatable. A block for a corner that leads to nothing.   Updated at 4.27pm GMT    4.23pm    65 min: Brozovic tugs Neymar\u2019s shoulder to concede a free kick 30 yards out, just left of centre. That\u2019s his second free kick conceded since picking up a yellow card. He really needs to be careful. One more transgression and he might be for the off. The free kick is wasted.     4.22pm    64 min: Juranovic has been the boss of Vinicius Junior down the Brazil left. On comes Rodrygo to have a go at the Croatia right-back instead.     4.21pm    63 min: Kovacic slips Perisic into a little space down the left. Perisic zings a low cross towards the near post, but there\u2019s nobody in chequerboard taking a gamble. Easy for Alisson.     4.19pm    61 min: Croatia have slowed the game down and it\u2019s causing Brazil and their supporters palpable frustration. \u201cI used to love that game,\u201d writes Fourth Protocol fan Se\u00e1n Connolly. \u201cI played it to death after reading the book. I was super thrilled when they made a film of it. I was a strange 12 year old.\u201d     4.17pm    59 min: Antony powers in from the right and feeds Richarlison, who doesn\u2019t spin quite so elegantly this time. Goal kick.     4.16pm    58 min: Croatia play keep-ball, making Brazil chase.     4.14pm    56 min: Brazil blink and make the game\u2019s first change. Antony comes on for Raphinha.     4.13pm    55 min: Richarlison spins elegantly on a sixpence down the inside-left channel, and out of nothing, Brazil are suddenly dangerously on the attack! He slides Neymar into the box. Neymar strides to the left-hand corner of the six-yard box but can\u2019t force past Livakovic. A good save, though it wasn\u2019t a crisp connection from Neymar.   Updated at 4.18pm GMT    4.12pm    53 min: Juranovic romps down the right again, before switching play to Perisic on the other flank. Perisic curls in from the left, looking for Kramaric in the middle. The cross is too high, and floats out for a goal kick. A few inches lower, though, and Kramaric was surely heading home from six yards.     4.10pm    52 min: Neymar drives down the left and speed. He\u2019s eventually legally skittled to the floor, and stays down for a bit. No need to worry, though, he\u2019s back up soon enough. The crowd enjoyed that run, even if it led to nothing.     4.09pm    50 min: The ever-busy Juranovic wins a corner down the right. Modric floats it in. It drops to Perisic on the left-hand corner of the six-yard box. Alisson blocks, then the flag goes up for offside. It\u2019s been a fast start to the second half by both sides!     4.08pm    49 min: \u2026 but there\u2019s a VAR check for a possible penalty. The ball hit Juranovic on the arm as it dropped over his shoulder, earlier in the move that led to Neymar\u2019s chance. But he knew nothing about it, and the officials aren\u2019t interested in pursuing the matter any further.   Updated at 4.10pm GMT    4.07pm    48 min: Brazil come again through Vinicius Jr down the left. His pass finds Neymar, who scuffs a shot from the penalty spot. Gvardiol blocks brilliantly. Lovren hacks a dismal clearance that nearly drops to Richarlison, but the flag goes up for offside.     4.06pm    47 min: Raphinha scampers with purpose down the right. He reaches the byline and crosses low. With yellow shirts around, Gvardiol deflects the ball towards his own net. Livakovic sticks out a leg to block. That\u2019s one hell of a reaction save!  Updated at 4.17pm GMT    4.04pm    46 min: Neymar embarks on a power run down the right; Vinicius Jr scampers after a long pass down the left. Goal kick, but it\u2019s clear Brazil have been ordered to up the tempo a little.     4.03pm    Brazil get the second half underway. No changes. \u201cI\u2018m dating myself with my taste in Cold War literature here,\u201d begins Eric Peterson, \u201cbut that first half was like slogging my way through the first half of a Frederick Forsyth novel. Tons of backstory and technical hoo-hah that\u2019s a real chore, but boy does it pay off with the roller coaster that\u2019s in store for you through the duration of it. Dearly hoping this game plays out like that.\u201d Can\u2019t say I\u2019m au fait with Forsyth\u2019s oeuvre, but I did once play the Fourth Protocol game. Probably not worth sitting through the whole walkthrough, it wasn\u2019t very good. When push came to shove, I preferred Amidar. Anyway, we\u2019ve veered some way off piste here. Back to Qatar!      3.47pm   Who do you support?  Before you reach for the half-time oranges, please consider supporting Guardian journalism like this, for three reasons: \u2022 We are independent - no one tells us what we can and can\u2019t publish (and that includes Fifa)\u2022 We rely on readers funding us to keep us independent\u2022 We give you the full picture - the excitement on the pitch and the shame, corruption and injustice off it Support the Guardian from as little as \u00a31 \u2013 it only takes a minute. Thank you.     3.46pm   HALF TIME: Croatia 0-0 Brazil  The 2018 finalists will be much happier than the five-time champions. This is in the balance all right!   Updated at 4.02pm GMT    3.46pm    45 min: There will be just one added minute.     3.44pm    44 min: Sosa finds a little space down the left wing and tries to release Perisic into the Brazil box. Nearly, but Thiago Silva reads the play well and gets to the pass first, ushering both ball and Perisic away from the danger zone.     3.42pm    42 min: Neymar aims the free kick towards the top left. It takes a deflection off the wall but doesn\u2019t wrong-foot Livakovic, who stoops to gather by the bottom left. There wasn\u2019t much conviction in that free kick at all.     3.41pm    41 min: Vinicius Jr skitters down the left wing and is clipped by Brozovic, who is already on a yellow and needs to watch himself here. Just a free kick, beside the left-hand corner of the Croatia box. A very dangerous position.     3.40pm    40 min: Neymar drops deep to quarterback in the Modric style. He flicks a lovely pass down the right channel for Raphinha, who controls carelessly, allowing Kovacic to mop up.     3.38pm    38 min: Brozovic drives dangerously down the inside-left channel, but then finds he doesn\u2019t have any options in the middle, and eventually runs the ball out for a goal kick. If only Mario Mand\u017euki\u0107 was ten years younger.     3.36pm    36 min: It\u2019s 45 percent possession apiece right now, with the ludicrous In Contest on ten percent. What can it mean? Let\u2019s not overthink. It doesn\u2019t matter.   Updated at 3.40pm GMT    3.35pm    35 min: Croatia hog the ball in midfield, Modric dictating terms. The majority in the crowd don\u2019t like it, jeering as they keep possession. The Croatian fans however are loving it, their songs louder than the efforts of their Brazilian counterparts right now.     3.33pm    33 min: Juranovic crosses yet again from the right. Perisic prepares to meet it at the far post, but Alisson comes a long way off his line to flick the ball away from him. Croatia look the more likely at the minute.   Updated at 3.35pm GMT    3.32pm    31 min: Brozovic clips Neymar and goes into the book. Brazil try to take the free kick quickly, but it only leads to Lovren and Richarlison bickering. Perhaps Joe Pearson (2 min) was onto something. Brazil then waste the free kick. They\u2019re a bit ragged.     3.30pm    30 min: Perisic, scorer of one of Croatia\u2019s goals in the 2018 final, zips in from the left wing and looks for the top-right corner of the goal. He finds the top-right corner of the stand behind.     3.29pm    29 min: Neymar floats the free kick towards Paqueta, to the right of the Croatian goal, but his team-mate can do nothing with it. Croatia clear.     3.29pm    28 min: Brozovic clips Vinicius Jr and it\u2019s a free kick for Brazil the best part of 30 yards out. Neymar stands over it, eyes lighting up.     3.27pm    26 min: Modric sticks the free kick into the mixer but Brazil clear and the whistle goes. It could be a long evening for Danilo now, on a booking and up against the sprightly Juranovic, who has caused him plenty of bother already.     3.26pm    25 min: Juranovic strides down the right only to be high-kicked in the face by Danilo! That could easily be a red card, but it\u2019s just a yellow, presumably because Danilo got a slice of the ball. Still, it\u2019s a free kick just to the side of the Brazil box, and Modric prepares to wave his wand.     3.24pm    24 min: The corner is no good. This game hasn\u2019t quite tipped over from Intriguing to Fun yet, but it might not be long.     3.23pm    23 min: Lovren\u2019s poor clearing header finds Raphinha, who tees up Paqueta for a long-distance shot. It\u2019s deflected out for a corner on the right. Raphinha to take.     3.22pm    21 min: Vinicius Junior wriggles in from the left wing. He exchanges a wall pass with Richarlison and opens his body, aiming a curler towards the bottom left. Lovren blocks. Neymar then sends a pea-roller straight at Livakovic. Brazil quickly come again, Neymar unable to release Vinicius Jr down the inside-left channel. Easy for Livakovic. Better from Brazil.   Updated at 3.25pm GMT    3.19pm    19 min: Kovacic cuts in from the left and has a dig from distance. Blocked. Croatia are the better side right now, while Brazil are struggling to make passes in the opposition half stick.     3.17pm    17 min: Brazil pass it around the back, though they\u2019re getting severely hassled by the Croatian press. And there\u2019s Croatia supposedly old and knackered. Meanwhile here\u2019s K\u00e1ri Tulinius, who has a long MBM memory stretching back to the very last entry of this one: \u201cThough your astute prediction at the end of the 2010 World Cup that Brazil would implode in 2014 proved spectacularly true, I think that this year\u2019s team is far less consumed by its own sense of destiny. If they lose today, which they might, it won\u2019t be because they\u2019re so high on their own supply that they stagger around their own box like people thrown out of a nightclub for passing out in the toilet.\u201d     3.16pm    15 min: \u2026 but Brazil don\u2019t clear their heads. Alisson tries to send his team on the counter, but his roll-out to Casemiro puts his mate in bother. Modric nips in, then crosses from the right. Militao heads clear. Brazil aren\u2019t exactly rattled, but they haven\u2019t started well.   Updated at 3.18pm GMT    3.14pm    14 min: Croatia are on top, and now win a corner down the left. Richarlison heads it clear powerfully to allow Brazil to gather themselves.     3.13pm    12 min: Juranovic steams down the inside-right channel before slipping Pasalic into space on the overlap. Pasalic whistles a low cross through the six-yard box. Juranovic, who had continues his run, flashes at fresh air, then so does Perisic. A big chance for both Croatians there.     3.10pm    10 min: Raphinha drops a shoulder to skip past Sosa on the right. He reaches the byline and cuts the ball back \u2026 but he\u2019s run it out of play. Goal kick. Both teams are in a lively mood, and why not, it is the quarter-finals of the World Cup after all.     3.09pm    9 min: Perisic crosses from the left. There\u2019s nobody in the centre to take advantage. But Croatia are having some joy down the wings during these early exchanges.     3.08pm    7 min: Juranovic crosses from a deep position on the right. Perisic competes for a header at the far post, but Militao wins a hard-fought contest, and it\u2019s a free kick for Brazil. Speaking of putting it about, here\u2019s Justin Kavanagh: \u201cSerbia, Switzerland, Cameroon, and South Korea are all solid enough teams in the second tier of world football. But Brazil start to step out against the elite today and we should discover if they belong up there with the greats of 58, 70, and 82. As Roy Keane might say, time to steel-tip those dancing shoes, boys.\u201d   Updated at 3.09pm GMT    3.06pm    5 min: The first shot in anger, and it\u2019s a decent one. Vinicius Junior cuts in from the left and attempts to find a team-mate. His pass rebounds back to him. He opts to shoot instead, curling for the top right. It\u2019s on target, but not hit firmly and an easy claim for Livakovic. Lovren then passes out carelessly from the back, allowing Raphinha to intercept and nearly find Vinicius Junior on the edge of the box. Goal kick.     3.04pm    3 min: Kovacic dribbles down the left and draws a free kick from Casemiro. A chance for Croatia to put one into the box, but Brozovic can\u2019t manage it. Still, there\u2019s an early sign that the 2018 finalists haven\u2019t come here to simply defend.     3.02pm    2 min: Brazil have lost five successive knockout matches at the World Cup against European opposition. Some sort of dramatic early statement wouldn\u2019t go amiss. They don\u2019t make one, though. Speaking of which, here\u2019s Joe Pearson: \u201cSo it\u2019s an ex-Merseyside derby, is it? I guess that means Brazil should prepare to play with ten, after Richarlison gets sent off for leaving a two-footer in on Lovren.\u201d     3.00pm    Croatia get the ball rolling. A reminder that if these guys can\u2019t sort themselves out in 90 minutes, we\u2019ll be going to extra time and possibly penalty kicks. A semi-final against either the Netherlands or Argentina awaits!     2.55pm    The teams are out! Brazil are in their iconic yellow shirts, while Croatia wear their equally distinctive red-and-white checkerboard tops. We\u2019ll be off once anthems have been performed, coins tossed and hands clasped.     2.46pm    A reminder of how these two teams got here \u2026 via the mediums of match report, music and movement.       2.23pm    The result of the match is already in. Ritinha, a shark incarcerated in some aquarium or other in Rio, has reportedly plumped for the contents of a food bottle with a Brazilian flag on it, cocking a snook at the one emblazoned with signifiers of Croatia. Congratulations to Brazil for making the semi-final!  Admittedly this directly contradicts the prediction made by Kent, a gibbon at Zagreb Zoo, who got tucked into the open Croatian food box wafted under his hungry face. What could it all mean? Not sure if any other species were consulted: for the record, Paul the Octopus died in 2010, while Triumph the Insult Comic Dog was unavailable.   Updated at 2.25pm GMT    2.02pm    Croatia make two changes to the starting XI named for the win over Japan. Borna Sosa returns from illness, replacing Borna Barisic, while forward Bruno Petkovic is sacrificed for additional midfield strength in Mario Pasalic. Brazil name an unchanged line-up. First-choice left back Alex Sandro still hasn\u2019t fully recovered from a hip injury and remains on the bench. Danilo will once again move across from right back to stand in, with Eder Militao covering in turn.     1.53pm   The teams  Croatia: Livakovic, Juranovic, Lovren, Gvardiol, Sosa, Modric, Brozovic, Kovacic, Pasalic, Kramaric, Perisic.Subs: Stanisic, Barisic, Erlic, Majer, Grbic, Vlasic, Livaja, Petkovic, Budimir, Orsic, Vida, Ivusic, Sutalo, Sucic, Jakic. Brazil: Alisson, Eder Militao, Marquinhos, Thiago Silva, Danilo, Lucas Paqueta, Casemiro, Raphinha, Neymar, Vinicius Junior, Richarlison.Subs: Alex Sandro, Fred, Weverton, Dani Alves, Fabinho, Bruno Guimaraes, Antony, Rodrygo, Everton Ribeiro, Ederson, Bremer, Pedro, Martinelli. Referee: Michael Oliver (England).     1.30pm   Preamble  Brazil have only met Croatia twice at the World Cup, and it\u2019s not entirely clear what history teaches us. The bottom line is that the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o have won both matches, 1-0 in 2006, 3-1 in the opening match of 2014. But on both occasions the Croatians made the five-time champions work. Kaka\u2019s curler decided the former match, but Dado Prso, Ivan Klasnic, Marko Babic and Igor Tudor all went close; eight years later, hosts Brazil required a controversial second-half penalty for some non-contact Dejan Lovren-near-Fred action to turn a game that looked set for a draw. No definitive answers there \u2026 though Brazil lost their first-ever World Cup game 2-1 to Yugoslavia in 1930, drew 1-1 with them in 1954 and 0-0 in 1974, and beat them 2-0 in a crunch match in 1950, Yugoslav captain Rajko Mitic missing the start after cracking his head open on an exposed girder in the still-half-finished Maracana. Do any of those distant memories of a former way of life help any? Almost certainly not. Perhaps more up-to-date analysis will help us? In the round of 16, Croatia were more resilient than impressive in keeping up with a superior Japan, then holding their nerve better in a penalty shoot-out. Brazil by contrast were juggling the ball around against South Korea like it was the Pel\u00e9-Garrincha era all over again. However look at it another way: Croatia might be a superannuated bunch out for one last hurrah, but they were finalists last time round and know how to grind their way through a tournament. And while Brazil play like Brazil, they also have to be Brazil, with all the concomitant expectation, pressure, weight of history, etc. Hmm. Still nothing definitive. So both teams will, in very different ways, and for very different reasons, fancy their chances this afternoon. Brazil are strong favourites to progress to a semi-final against the Netherlands or Argentina \u2026 but while their attack is flying, Alisson had to make three big saves on Monday night and Croatia may not let them get away with that sort of defensive profligacy again. It\u2019s going to be a whole load of fun watching this unfold, and it could go to extra-time and penalty kicks. Kick off is at 3pm GMT, 6pm at the Education City Stadium in Al Rayyan. \u0627\u0646\u0647 \u064a\u062d\u062f\u062b! It\u2019s on!  "

                    "body": "Who knew the final phase of rugby league\u2019s Pacific revolution would arrive to the sounds of Neil Diamond, but it did as the delirious Samoa players sang Sweet Caroline after exacting revenge against England in the semi-final of the Rugby League World Cup. Samoan flags have sold out across Australia and the \u201c685 revolution\u201d (a reference to the country\u2019s international dialling code) has gone international with street parades and \u201cchee-Hoo\u201d, the universal Samoan expression of joy, screamed at all hours in Apia, Western Sydney, Auckland and even in the American-Samoan colonies in Utah. When they take on Australia at Old Trafford on Saturday (Sunday AEDT), Samoa will make history as the first new nation to play in a World Cup final in 34 years and also the first second tier and Pacific nation.  There are a dizzying number of narratives in play ahead of the title decider, but the most far-reaching is the potentially seismic impact of a Samoan victory on game\u2019s international eligibility rules and its golden calf, State of Origin. Should Samoa beat the Kangaroos in Manchester, they can make a case for elevation to tier one status alongside traditional powerhouses Australia, New Zealand and England. Players would then have to choose between playing for Samoa or playing in State of Origin, and with most of the Samoans on good money at NRL clubs, the lure of $30,000 Origin match payments may not prove the siren call of bygone days. The Origin model was hatched in the \u201cus or them\u201d monocultural 1980s and hasn\u2019t adjusted to the fluid identities of migrant players. Labelling Australia-born Pacific players traitors or defectors ignores the nuance and exposes the lack of empathy that comes with insularity and a patch-protecting siege mentality. If Samoans opt out of State of Origin, rugby league would arrive at a fascinating crossroads, according to Samoan-Australian Frank Puletua, the NRL\u2019s most senior Pasifika administrator. \u201cThe tiered system is flawed and creates complexity with an anomaly like State of Origin \u2013 no other major sport has a state rivalry that supersedes every other event.\u201d The rise of Tonga in 2017 and Samoa this year has triggered furious debate regarding their place in the hierarchy and for Puletua, the stakes are high. \u201cIf you keep placing Origin and Test footy against each other, there is ultimately going to be a decision that involves trade-offs because we can\u2019t keep undermining the progress of the international game.\u201d For the privileged, equality feels like oppression and levelling up the international game at the expense of State of Origin is seen by some as form of treachery to Australian rugby league. For others, the cultish devotion to State of Origin is stopping the growth of the international game by using the lure of playing Origin to bludgeon loyalty and enable the Kangaroos to stockpile the best Pacific players. It\u2019s not a level playing field and must come to an end, says Puletua. \u201cIf the Samoans are made tier one and are forced to choose their country over Origin, then the broadcasters for the first time will not be able to authentically market Origin as the \u2018best v the best\u2019 which will have ramifications.\u201d Looking into the future, Puletua sees the tier system being dropped and players allowed to nominate for any country. \u201cMy feeling is that the dial has shifted so much for the Pacific players that they are not going to pull back.\u201d Part of the reason for the younger generation of players declaring for Samoa and for their revival after the embarrassment of their opening 60-6 loss to England has been the team\u2019s deep immersion in Fa\u2019a Samoa, the 3,000-year-old Samoan cultural and social system. Fereti \u201cFredi\u201d Tuilagi, the Leicester-based former league and union cult hero has been tasked with \u201cbringing the culture\u201d to the current squad. Tuilagi holds the title of Lauaki, a high chief title from Savai\u2019i, the cultural capital of Samoa, and his job is to complement the coaches by blending the team together through culture and tradition. He notes that although some of the team have not been to Samoa, they love representing their heritage. \u201cIt\u2019s their way of saying thank you for their elders\u2019 sacrifices in leaving Samoa and opening up this opportunity for them.\u201d He has a couple of rules, including a strict one that all players, \u201ceven the shy ones\u201d, must learn cultural dance in addition to practising the anthem and the fearsome Siva Tau. \u201cWe Samoans love to express ourselves, so to see Joseph Sua\u2019ali\u2019i go from shy to dancing in the changerooms was joyous,\u201d Tuilagi says.  Cameras also spied the teenage star Sua\u2019ali\u2019i sweeping the changerooms after the game with a smile, an act of humility in line with the team\u2019s mantra and key Samoan phrase they are learning: \u201cO le ala i le pule o le tautua\u201d \u2013 the pathway to leadership is through service. Tuilagi has worked in this capacity with Samoan teams for 20 years and he is the connective tissue to the \u201cbad old days\u201d of no budgets and no respect. He uses the power of story to build tradition, and to write the next chapter of the Pacific rugby league story. \u201cWe use lots of stories to teach them about Samoa and the sacrifices of those before them, funny stories about bad hotels and no allowances and bus trips where the toilets overflowed,\u201d Tuilagi says. \u201cThey realise they\u2019re a part of that journey and it fills them with pride.\u201d "

                    "body": "Ah, the euphoric release of celebrating a goal. No inhibitions. No boundaries. Just grab the nearest stranger and shake them with unnerving force. Take that bald man\u2019s head in your hands and kiss it. Gurn and roar and swear and hold your fists to the sky in glory (or relief). As a longtime Arsenal season ticket holder I\u2019ve lost count of how often I\u2019ve nearly fallen down the row in front, propelled by swarming bodies and the melee of flailing arms \u2013 full \u201climbs\u201d (the internet term). Let\u2019s go fucking mental (the technical term). Embrace pure instinct. Except, for some England fans it\u2019s not. Even in a tournament where Qatar is literally paying fans to be there, is there anything more artificial this World Cup than the choreographed pint throwing across England\u2019s fan zones? Yes, the pint throwing is back. What started during the 2018 World Cup with viral videos of fans in Hyde Park and Flat Iron Square has limped on to today. It\u2019s not as widespread this time around \u2013 the winter? The vibe? The passage of time killing its momentum? \u2013 but there are still plenty of videos circulating of fans drenching each other with beer after every goal. Even the England team\u2019s official Twitter account is tweeting them out. Goal celebrations used to be proportional: the more crucial the goal the more riotous the scene. That relationship is broken. Is the natural response to the third goal in a dead rubber group match against Wales to launch your drink into the air? I love Bukayo Saka as much as the next person, but was his goal against Senegal, England\u2019s third, of such significant relief it was worth losing your drink over? Or is the pint-throwing craze football fandom\u2019s collective fake orgasm?  It rarely happens outside tournament football, if at all. Most match- or pub-going fans probably hold synchronised beer-chucking in the same disdain they do Mexican waves. I\u2019ve certainly never witnessed it outside of England matches (though I have been hit by a beer thrown in anger at the Emirates stadium \u2013 there may be a ban on pitch-side alcohol but trust me, if you want to get it through you can). No, this phenomenon is largely contained to England\u2019s dedicated fan zones, with Boxpark its ground zero, where the drenching is such a part of the action that waterproof ponchos are now the fashion accessory of choice. There\u2019s a lot that feels forced about these fan theme parks; in every viral video you can usually spot a handful of guys who pause their celebrations, pick a pint off the table and dash it across the room. It\u2019s hard to escape the feeling it\u2019s all simulation for the cameras.  Which probably shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. Football fandom drifted into the realms of celebrity fandom via content creation a long time ago. Every major club now has its share of online fan channels and influencers peddling over-the-top reactions and manufactured outrage in pursuit of compelling content. And it\u2019s not uncommon to see fans filming their every reaction at actual matches for social media clout. Fan competition for online attention is nothing new. Pre-planned pint-chucking is just another TikTok dance, the latest display of fan narcissism for those hoping to see themselves in the next viral \u201cLIMBS!\u201d video. I know what some of you are probably thinking: here we go, the fun police have arrived. And sure, we could just leave Boxpark\u2019s poncho ultras be, let them enjoy the flashmob revelry and move on. But we should strive for better. Australian fans produced numerous scenes of anarchic joy celebrating goals and victories \u2013 arguably the best of the tournament. None required mass drenching.  What may have felt natural and bacchanalian when we were all outside in the glorious sunshine of 2018 now feels as organic as astroturf. The vibe has long since dissipated. Lads, don\u2019t throw your pint in the air. Pour one out for a craze that should have been left in the past.  Chris Godfrey is a commissioning editor on G2 "

The score was 1-0 to the Spanish side when a late challenge from Alex Cochrane on an Almer\u00eda defender caused his opponent to push back before teammates from both sides joined the melee. Cochrane was sent off alongside Almer\u00eda\u2019s Rodrigo Ely following their involvement. Coaching staff became involved while the match officials tried to calm the situation, although a truce could not be reached and it was decided to curtail proceedings in Marbella. Hearts tweeted: \u201cFollowing altercations between both sets of players, the decision has been made to abandon the match.\u201d The Hearts manager, Robbie Neilson, said: \u201cIt was a very competitive game and then, all of a sudden, there was a tackle from Alex [Cochrane], which I thought was a standard tackle and then all hell broke loose with their players running round it, forearm smashes from their centre-half on Alex. \u201cI think the ref just totally lost control of it; benches were over and there were about 60 people on the pitch. It was a bit of a shambles so we just felt, it\u2019s a pre-season game, we\u2019ve already got injuries, so there is no point carrying on because I think tensions were extremely high, to say the least. \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be a competitive edge but there\u2019s a line that can\u2019t be crossed, and I think they crossed it several times. The referee didn\u2019t have any control of it, he was all over the shop. We just felt there was no point.\u201d Dyego Sousa had scored the opener for Almer\u00eda before the incident taking place in Marbella.

                    "body": "Eddie Howe believes there is still time for Callum Wilson to earn a place in England\u2019s squad for the World Cup in November. A thigh injury has dictated that the Newcastle centre-forward has not been named in Gareth Southgate\u2019s squad for the Nations League games against Italy and Germany, when he was widely expected to receive a recall. Instead England\u2019s manager has called up Brentford\u2019s former Newcastle striker Ivan Toney in what appears a key audition for the role of Harry Kane\u2019s principal understudy.  Howe, though, believes Wilson could yet add to his four senior caps in Qatar. \u201cI feel for Callum because he\u2019s not in the England squad,\u201d said Newcastle\u2019s manager, who, conscious of the 30-year-old\u2019s tendency to pick up injuries, signed Alexander Isak for \u00a359m from Real Sociedad last month. \u201cBut it will just fuel his motivation, it will fire him even more, so when Callum returns to our team he will show how good he is.\u201d  Although close to full fitness, Wilson is expected to miss out on Saturday\u2019s match with Howe\u2019s former club Bournemouth at St James\u2019 Park but should return after the international break. \u201cI think there\u2019s time for Callum to make the World Cup squad,\u201d said Howe. \u201cAnd I know Gareth feels the same. What does he have to do? He has to return and score and be consistent in his availability. Maybe he has to have a bit of luck somewhere else to make that plane.\u201d Before signing Isak Howe \u2013 who believes the Sweden striker could play alongside Wilson \u2013 explored the possibility of recruiting Toney. After making only two senior appearances for Newcastle, Toney was allowed to leave in 2018 during Rafael Ben\u00edtez\u2019s managerial tenure but has rebuilt his career at first Peterborough and now Brentford. Part of Howe\u2019s brief is to try to help prevent any future Toneys slipping through the Tyneside net. \u201cI\u2019d love to think that wouldn\u2019t happen now,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a criticism of anyone here at that time; why Ivan left, I don\u2019t know. But when you watch him play now and see his attributes and what he can bring to his team, he\u2019s an outstanding player. \u201cHis England call-up is a great thing for people that drop into the lower leagues. It gives them hope that it\u2019s not the end of their dreams. Ivan\u2019s had to work his way back up and he\u2019s done incredibly well.\u201d"

                    "body": "It is always revealing when a manager namechecks an opposition player before a game and it was no different when Gareth Southgate did so on Sunday. Asked to assess Germany, whom England face in the Nations League at Wembley on Monday night \u2013 in a tie that has become fraught for so many reasons \u2013 he zeroed in on one man, betraying admiration and envy in equal measure. \u201cJoshua Kimmich is fundamental to the team and the way they play,\u201d Southgate said of the midfield controller. \u201cHe organises the game for them and he reads it so well.\u201d The envy is rooted in Kimmich being the type of player that England lack. A little like Luka Modric, Frenkie de Jong, Jorginho and Marco Verratti. The link between this group? They have each been central to the most painful defeats of Southgate\u2019s six-year England tenure. Modric helped to move Croatia away from England in the 2018 World Cup semi-final, ditto De Jong for the Netherlands in the 2019 Nations League semi-final and both Jorginho and Verratti for Italy in the Euro 2020 final.  After five matches without a win and all of the angst and introspection, the fear that Southgate has entered his international end game, he is desperate to turn back the clock to the summer of last year when he enjoyed perhaps his finest hour \u2013 the 2-0 Wembley win against Germany in the last 16 of the European Championship. Could a similar victory change the narrative after what has been and ahead of what is to come \u2013 the World Cup in Qatar? Kimmich played at right wing-back in the Euro 2020 tie, filling in for his team. But he was back in midfield when Germany hosted England in June in the reverse Nations League fixture, dictating the tempo, pulling the strings. England would pinch a 1-1 draw when they rallied in the final 20 minutes \u2013 an isolated purple patch in what has been a wretched campaign. \u201cWe don\u2019t have that sort of player in this country,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we develop that sort of player well through youth football and through academies. Other countries probably have a little bit more focus on that.\u201d So what is the solution? How do England impose themselves on Germany? From listening to Southgate after England had trained at Tottenham\u2019s Enfield HQ two things were clear and one of them involved what he would not do. The manager noted that the time was tight \u2013 between the 1-0 loss against Italy in Milan last Friday and Germany\u2019s visit and also to the World Cup. England will not play again before they take on Iran in their opening group game on 21 November. As such, the emphasis is more on \u201ctrying to bed things in\u201d than experimentation \u2013 say, trying a playmaker like Phil Foden or Jack Grealish in central midfield. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen their clubs do it,\u201d Southgate said, when this was put to him. \u201cWe have talked about the passing of Trent [Alexander-Arnold] \u2013 that\u2019s why we gave him a go in midfield [against Andorra last year]. That got completely lambasted. If you are not doing that every day for your club in certain positions, it is very difficult to transfer that on to an international stage.\u201d Southgate\u2019s more proactive point was that we are where we are, he has to work with what he has and, in the pivotal area under discussion, it means Declan Rice, Jude Bellingham, Jordan Henderson and James Ward\u2011Prowse. (Kalvin Phillips is injured and a major fitness doubt for Qatar). \u201cWe cannot buy somebody, we cannot generate somebody,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cWe try to find different ways of building from the back to allow us that lack of a playmaking pivot. We have players with other excellent attributes and we try to get the most out of that.\u201d  Southgate wants to stick to what he knows and that includes his three-at-the-back system; to work smarter and better. He cannot countenance a repetition of old shortcomings. He simply trusts the process, with a little fine-tuning, which includes the need to transition more incisively. Raheem Sterling offered an insight into the Germany preparations. \u201cEven today, we had to go over things to try to find where we can find that extra man with this five at the back,\u201d the winger said. \u201cDo we put a midfielder higher up in the buildup? The manager is working on things to get us that space in the attacking third to try to change [the situation]. It\u2019s not a time to panic.\u201d Also interesting was what felt like a reservation from Sterling about his role in the 3-4-3, which is as more of an inside forward as the width comes from the wing-back behind him. \u201cIf a team plays with a back five and matches you up, their centre-half follows you in,\u201d Sterling said. \u201cIt\u2019s about trying to find key areas in the final third where we can get an extra player. There are benefits for the forwards and the difficulty is that you have always got your back to goal. I\u2019m normally wide, which is a position I\u2019m more than comfortable playing. The more we play it, the better it will be.\u201d Southgate is obsessed with ensuring that the marginal gains go in his team\u2019s favour; the nuances of a formation; balance and \u201cproviding the players with clear pictures of how you want to play.\u201d Above all, this has to be a time for unity. \u201cIn these moments, you\u2019ve got to stay resilient and stick to your beliefs \u2013 approach every day in the right way,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cThe players have responded brilliantly to that.\u201d"

                    "body": "England, Wales and five other European nations feared their captains would be exposed to \u201cunlimited liability\u201d and would have faced suspensions if they had defied Fifa\u2019s banning of the pro-diversity OneLove armband during the World Cup.\nDespite facing criticism for backing down after coming under pressure from Fifa, the English Football Association\u2019s options were limited by concerns that the sporting sanctions for Harry Kane could have been worse than an instant booking if the captain had worn the armband against Iran. There were also fears that Gareth Southgate\u2019s side could have been prevented from entering the field.\nThe FA\u2019s worries were shared by the other six countries involved in the OneLove campaign after talks with world football\u2019s governing body, with those close to the process left with the impression that \u201cFifa could do anything\u201d to any captain who wore the armband in Qatar.\n\nThe German federation has described Fifa\u2019s behaviour as \u201cextreme blackmail\u201d and sources have indicated there was no clarity over whether the captains would merely receive a caution.\nEngland, Wales, Belgium, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark feared their captains could be banned. It was unclear whether any suspension would be limited to one match. None of the countries were prepared to put their players in that position. A source said that the captains would have risked \u201cunlimited liability\u201d if they had defied Fifa\u2019s warnings.\nSeparately the FA was concerned that England\u2019s game against Iran would not have started if Kane had tried to leave the dressing room with the armband. The FA is exploring if it will be legally possible to challenge the threat of sporting sanctions, and there has been fury within the seven associations about Fifa\u2019s behaviour.\n\nSuggestions that Kane could have created an iconic moment by walking on to the pitch with the armband and receiving an instant booking are misplaced. The yellow card would have been shown in the dressing room, stripping away any potential symbolism.\nSouthgate, speaking before Friday\u2019s game against the USA, was asked about the threat of sanctions for Kane. \u201cI don\u2019t know all the ins and outs because I wasn\u2019t in the meeting but there was definitely a feel there were sanctions and not all of those were really clear, I think, so the decision was taken out of the hands of Harry,\u201d England\u2019s head coach said.\n\u201cThe decision from the organisation was: \u2018We\u2019re not even putting the armband in the dressing room.\u2019 There is no discussion. The player had no say.\u201d\nGermany\u2019s players were praised for covering their mouths with their hands to suggest they had been gagged by Fifa before their game against Japan on Wednesday. Six players, including the captain, Manuel Neuer, also wore Adidas boots with rainbow stitching during the team\u2019s shock 2-1 defeat against Japan, and the squad sported tops with rainbow colours on their sleeves in the warm-up.\n\nGermany have faced no punishment from Fifa but Southgate questioned whether there would be any value in England mounting a similar form of protest on Friday.\n\u201cI\u2019m quite comfortable with our position and I think we should be confident in what we stand for,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cThere was a plan \u2013 we weren\u2019t able to carry out that plan. What do we do now? Do we all try to outdo each other on a gesture that, however we do it, probably won\u2019t be enough.\n\u201cWe want to support the LGBTQ community in particular and recognise that a lot of those people aren\u2019t here with us, and we wanted them here with us. But we could also rush into doing things that don\u2019t really make any difference.\n\n\u201cI understand that is going to be uncomfortable for people because I could be criticised, the captain has been criticised, the organisation will be criticised. I\u2019m very comfortable with what I stand for, and how I deal with people every day of my life is more important than a statement that might land well and might not.\u201d\nKane trained on Thursday and will start on Friday after an injury scare. Southgate indicated that England, who would seal progress from Group B by beating the USA, will name an unchanged side against Gregg Berhalter\u2019s team. James Maddison is still recovering from a knee injury.\nHarry Maguire, who has recovered from the dehydration that forced him off against Iran, has opened up on the criticism he has faced and compared it to the negativity aimed at his former Manchester United teammate Cristiano Ronaldo. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the greatest players ever and gets criticised day in, day out,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if it\u2019s going to happen to him I think it\u2019s part and parcel of the game.\u201d\nSouthgate revealed that Prince William had told England\u2019s players to block out distractions on social media. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t have paid him for better advice,\u201d Southgate said."

                    "body": "Time is ticking away and the World Cup is looming large. Not exactly the moment, you might think, for Germany or any of the other qualified sides to call up a debutant. This one, however, is different \u2013 young he may be, but callow he isn\u2019t, and he is arriving at the forefront of Hansi Flick\u2019s mind at the perfect moment. Like most of the runs he makes in the yellow of Borussia Dortmund as autumn turns to winter, it appears as if Youssoufa Moukoko has timed this just right.\nThere are many remarkable things about the 17-year-old striker, not least that he has had to be patient to arrive at this point at which he is one of the first names on Edin Terzic\u2019s team sheet. Yet now, as not only his talent but how vital he is to Dortmund in the here and now becomes unquestionable, the stars are aligning for him.\n\nIt was not just that Moukoko spent Saturday afternoon scoring twice in the 3-0 win over Bochum (\u201cIt always tastes better in a derby,\u201d he said, judging the moment and the mood so well as he often does), but the way in which he did it. His finishes were typically full of conviction \u2013 a lusty sweep of the trusty left foot, followed by a canny chip over the wandering Bochum goalkeeper, Manuel Riemann, for the second with his weaker right, both from outside the area \u2013 and spoke of ability, form and confidence all combined.\nMuch of Germany\u2019s media and supporters are already convinced. \u201cHansi Flick has to take Moukoko to the World Cup,\u201d the Bild commentator Corni K\u00fcpper said with some insistence after the teenager\u2019s latest display. Meanwhile Kicker\u2019s customary question of the week is whether Moukoko or Werder Bremen\u2019s Niclas F\u00fcllkrug, the Bundesliga\u2019s top scorer who netted again in Saturday\u2019s 2-1 win over Schalke, should be called up. With Timo Werner ruled out in midweek, it is not out of the question that both players get on the flight to Doha.\n\nWhile F\u00fcllkrug\u2019s candidature has become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre, Moukoko\u2019s is conversely less romantic, but pragmatic. He is utterly convincing via either the numbers angle or the eye test. His opening goal made him the youngest player to reach double figures in the Bundesliga, and by a distance (the previous record holder, Florian Wirtz, hit the mark at 18 years and 145 days, while Moukoko doesn\u2019t turn 18 for another two weeks), but it feels almost like trivia in the context of his overall brilliance.\n\u201cHe\u2019s made a huge step forward,\u201d said a beaming Terzic, while BVB\u2019s sporting director, Sebastian Kehl, spoke glowingly about the teenager \u201cdeveloping his overall package.\u201d That much has been apparent since the moment he wrested the starting centre-forward berth from the new signing Anthony Modeste a month ago for the Champions League trip to Sevilla.\nNot all of Dortmund\u2019s issues were solved, of course, but one major problem went away at a stroke. If the concern had been that Moukoko couldn\u2019t function as a target man like Modeste, being about 10cm shorter than him, then his ability to link, move and mesh with his teammates in the house style was far superior. Without scoring in Andaluc\u00eda, Moukoko made it clear this was his spot in the XI.\nAmong the many elements that mark Moukoko out as special is his ability to lift those around him up a little bit higher. He did so in Der Klassiker, calling on Signal Iduna Park\u2019s main stand to rain praise down on Modeste, a player twice his age whom he had deposed from the XI but who had netted BVB a last-gasp equaliser \u2013 realising that this was the older man\u2019s moment, and he needed the love of the crowd after a difficult adaptation since arriving. Having given a leg up to his apparent competition, he may be able to do the same for his coach.\n\nThere are still many doubts about Dortmund, with lots of individual quality but very little discernible style of play. There is a growing feeling that even though Terzic is well-liked at the club, he may not be the long-term solution. Yet Moukoko couldn\u2019t be clearer with words or actions about clicking with his coach.\n\u201cI have Edin\u2019s trust,\u201d he emphasised, responding to a question on whether he will extend a contract that expires at the end of the season. Part of the reason he hasn\u2019t yet signed again \u2013 and looked as if he would leave last season, such was the frustration under Marco Rose \u2013 is he wanted game-time guarantees. He appears to have that under a coach he loves \u2013 and could help stay in the job.\nIn the meantime, the Germany dream is on. Moukoko spoke to Flick on Thursday, exactly a week before the coach announces his squad for Qatar. \u201cHe said that I should just keep going,\u201d he revealed, \u201cthat they watch everything and in the end those who perform will be there.\u201d On this basis, it\u2019s hard to see how Flick could leave him behind.\n\nTalking points\n\u2022 Bayern are on top after a 3-2 win over Hertha which should have been more comfortable. They led by three late in the first half, only for quickfire goals from Dodi Lukebakio and Davie Selke (with a penalty) to reignite the contest. It was the Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting show all over again: after Jamal Musiala tucked in a neat opener, the Cameroon striker scored twice, hitting the net for the seventh game in a row. Bild noted on Sunday he is scoring every 70 minutes this season, compared to every 82 for Robert Lewandowski at Barcelona. \u201cWe would like to keep him,\u201d Hasan Salihamid\u017ei\u0107 told Sky 90, with Choupo-Moting out of contract at the season\u2019s end.\n\n\u2022 The Rekordmeister stayed at the summit thanks to Leverkusen\u2019s emphatic win over Union on Sunday. It was goalless at half-time before the former K\u00f6penicker Robert Andrich\u2019s deft finish from a corner just after the interval prompted a goal avalanche as Die Werkself hit five in half an hour. It was a hint of what the club hope their new head coach, Xabi Alonso, can bring to the party. Mitchell Bakker, who was outstanding at wing-back and scored the fifth, credited the coach\u2019s half-time team talk. \u201cHe told us: \u2018Get angry when you look at the table,\u2019 and that if we kept going, the chances would come,\u201d said the Dutchman. Leverkusen are now out of the bottom three.\n\u2022 Freiburg move up to second after a 2-0 win over K\u00f6ln in Saturday\u2019s late game, where their initial profligacy was covered by an eighth clean sheet of the season. Having topped their Europa League group, they have done well to get through an uncommonly hectic campaign so far largely unscathed. \u201cWe still want to play,\u201d said Christian Streich, \u201cbut I\u2019ll be glad for next Sunday when we can take a deep breath.\u201d\n\u2022 Leipzig are on the heels of the top four, completing a great week with a 3-1 win at Hoffenheim thanks to two more from Christopher Nkunku \u2013 the first a stunning free-kick. \u201cHe is a difference maker with exceptional qualities,\u201d said Marco Rose after the Frenchman\u2019s goals took him past Timo Werner for the most Bundesliga goals ever scored by a Leipzig player in a calendar year (24).\n"

                    "body": "One point gained, or two hours lost? Certainly as England and the United States trundled their way to a fey and forgettable goalless draw, it was only natural to wonder how we might all have been spending this time more productively. Perhaps when the end finally comes, when we are lying on our deathbeds preparing to gasp our final breath, we will think back to that night we spent watching John Stones and Harry Maguire mesmerically passing the ball to each other, and quietly mourn the passing of time.\nIt was scarcely more enthralling in the flesh than it will have been on television. Al Bayt stadium rumbled and murmured. A lone drummer in the US end pounded out a menacing rhythm. Stones and Maguire carried on passing the ball to each other, with Luke Shaw and Kieran Trippier occasionally chipping in. There was some more passing. Some more drumming. Empires rose and fell. The seas parted and unparted again. Everyone got a little older.\nAfterwards, Gareth Southgate sat in his press conference chair and took little sips of water and gently nudged aside a few shuffling questions. Next to him, the FA\u2019s media officer Andy Walker scrolled listlessly through his phone. The whole occasion seemed ornately, magnificently pointless: everyone simply going through the motions, doing the things they knew how to do, content simply to stay out of trouble.\n\nPerhaps the lack of energy should not surprise us. The Iran game was a draining occasion on both a physical and emotional level. England may have looked flat here, but they did not subside or collapse as other major nations have done in this tournament. Even so, it\u2019s hard to remember an England tournament game that felt so devoid of basic purpose, basic adventure, basic commitment. The safest conclusion to draw is that this is simply how it goes sometimes. England played a similar game against Scotland in 2021 and we all know how that ended. Trust the process.\nAnd yet if you peered under the bonnet here (hood, for our American readers) it was possible to spot a slightly subtler process at work. It wasn\u2019t just the loss of sporting momentum, the sparkle and awe of the Iran performance evaporating in the space of 90 translucent minutes. On a wider level Southgate\u2019s England feel like a team suddenly searching for its wider purpose, its identity, its reason for being. A lot of the air and the urgency seems to have gone out of this thing. How has it happened, and how can they get it back?\n\nThis goes beyond one performance, and in many ways goes beyond performance itself. Naturally results like this, a run of one win in eight games, do not help. But in large part England are also the victims of forces beyond their control: football overload, the existential drudgery of the Nations League, the psychotic weirdness of this Qatar World Cup. Football\u2019s place in the world, and our place in football, has never felt quite so uncertain. England may yet do extremely well at this World Cup, may even win it. But what would it mean? What would it feel like?\nYou can occasionally sense that ambivalence in England\u2019s football. Do you go for the bold option, take the risk, invite contact, embrace the contest? Or do you simply pass the ball back to Stones and start the cycle again? Do you wear the armband and screw the consequences? Or do you step back from the brink, take your medicine, withdraw and regroup? Do you let Phil Foden loose or keep him on the bench for later? Part of the reason England have been so inconsistent in recent months is because they seem unsure of the right answers, unsure that there even is a right answer.\n\nPerhaps the point to be made here is about confrontation. The US had come for a scrap. They had a clear strategy based on compact shape and rapid forward movement. They were prepared to make the game ugly. England, by contrast, played as if they wanted the game to be as frictionless as possible. There was a squeamishness to them, a determination to take the path of least resistance. The first tackle did not come until 38th minute. The back four had more touches (358) than the rest of the team put together. Afterwards, Southgate said they were \u201coutstanding\u201d. It is, as it ever was, a game of opinions.\nEngland have players here with a thrill for a fight. Bukayo Saka, Jude Bellingham, Jack Grealish, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Marcus Rashford: these are risk-taking players at heart, players who want to express themselves, players unafraid of contact. But to win a duel you first have to want to fight it. On the field and off it, England\u2019s approach to the World Cup appears to be to stay out of trouble for as long as possible. Well, we\u2019ll see how that goes.\nThey gained a point here, and will probably qualify for the next round. But it\u2019s hard not to feel that something important and essential has been lost somewhere along the way."

                    "body": "Louis van Gaal believes the Netherlands can win the World Cup because his squad has a \u201chigher average quality\u201d than the group he led to third at Brazil 2014. The Netherlands begin their Qatar campaign against Senegal on Monday at Al Thumama Stadium. This is Van Gaal\u2019s third tenure, after taking charge from 2000-01, and 2012-14. The latter side included Arjen Robben, Robin van Persie and Wesley Sneijder; his current strongest XI is captained by Virgil van Dijk and features Frenkie de Jong and Matthijs de Ligt. Van Gaal said: \u201cVan Dijk truly is an excellent captain and this group is keen to execute the job. The 2014 group wanted to execute but the average quality of this group is higher than them. In 2014 there was Van Persie, Robben and Sneijder but Sneijder had to serve the squad [in a different position] as he was usually a No 10.  \u201cI believe in this squad of players. In 2014, we came third with a squad less than this group but [doing well] not only depends on tactical and technical skills but a bit of luck: can you score at the right time, things like that. We could become world champions but there are squads who are at a higher level than my squad but it is about how my squad deals with that. I like to think I can affect this as I have a head start [with his experience] and we can [win it].\u201d Van Dijk is expected to wear two armbands \u2013 the official Fifa issue as captain and the \u201cOneLove\u201d armband which features rainbow colours in support of the LGBTQ+ community and anti-discrimination in a stance against Qatar\u2019s laws. Van Gaal was asked whether he feared Van Dijk could receive a yellow card for wearing the unofficial one. \u201cI am no longer going to speak about political issues,\u201d the 71-year-old said. \u201cI am focusing on this coming match and I put a full stop on all these issues after we invited the migrant workers to watch our practice session. \u201cI have requested all my players to stop doing that too because I want them to focus on football and focus on the game against Senegal.\u201d Van Gaal is without Memphis Depay because of a hamstring problem, though there is hope he can recover to participate in the tournament. Sadio Man\u00e9 will play no part for Aliou Ciss\u00e9\u2019s team after surgery on a fibula injury. Man\u00e9 is a former Liverpool teammate of Van Dijk, who said: \u201cI called him the next day [after he was injured]. I wanted to know how he was first and foremost because there were so many rumours coming out that he was injured for a while. It was not the best news at the time but there was a little bit of hope but unfortunately he was not able to make this tournament. \u201cI feel sad for him because I know I hard he worked for this and he wanted to be important for Senegal \u2013 he has been important in the last couple of years especially. It\u2019s tough. He\u2019s going to be a big miss for them, like our manager has said, and hopefully we can benefit a little bit from that.\u201d Ciss\u00e9 led Senegal to a first Africa Cup of Nations triumph in February. Of Man\u00e9\u2019s absence, he said: \u201cIt is a great shame but now a great challenge for us.\u201d After Van Gaal left out Jasper Cillessen, who has 63 caps, his three goalkeepers \u2013 Andries Noppert, Remko Pasveer and Justin Bijlow \u2013 have only eight appearances between them."

Jones\u2019s side kick-started their autumn campaign with a dominant 52-13 victory over Japan, running in seven tries in a performance far improved from the defeat by Argentina six days earlier. Next up are New Zealand, against whom Jones led his side to victory in the 2019 World Cup semi-final and to a one-point defeat in 2018 in his two meetings as England head coach. Without Jones, England have fared considerably worse against the All Blacks, having won just eight of their 42 meetings in history and only two of the last 17, beating them most recently on home soil in 2012 when Manu Tuilagi ran amok.  \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to play against one of the giants of world rugby,\u201d said Jones, whose own record against New Zealand is six wins in 14 matches. \u201cFor an England player it is a massive opportunity. You look at the history of the sport, the game has been going for what, 150 years, and England have won 19% of their Tests against New Zealand. So there is a narrative about the game that says England can\u2019t beat New Zealand but in 2019 we showed if you have got the right attitude and the right gameplan that history can be broken. We have got a great opportunity this coming week to break history again and we\u2019re looking forward to the opportunity.\u201d The All Blacks have endured their struggles this year, most notably losing their home series against Ireland, but did win the Rugby Championship and began their November campaign with an ominous victory over Wales before facing Scotland on Sunday. Jones said: \u201cThey are playing a slightly different game than they used to but certainly guys who played in that [2019] game like Owen Farrell, and Mako and Billy Vunipola, Jamie George and Maro Itoje are going to be important in reinforcing to the players it is not Mission: Impossible. If we go after them they are there for the taking and we are going to go after them.\u201d Against Japan, England began far more brightly than against Argentina with Freddie Steward scoring the opening try before Marcus Smith and Guy Porter added two apiece while Ellis Genge got in on the act with the hosts also awarded a penalty try. \u201cIt\u2019s an improvement, as we said at the start of November, each game we want to get a little bit better and we were better than Argentina,\u201d added Jones."

                    "body": "Barcelona and Espanyol were a quarter of the way into their first game for more than 50 days, La Liga back at last, when the referee, Antonio Mateu Lahoz, was suddenly set off. Urgently heading across the pitch wearing a determined look, triggered by what he heard or perhaps remembering something really important he had to do, he sprinted straight at Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez, who was all in black and shouting. This was only ending one way. Pulling up pitchside, he grabbed Bar\u00e7a\u2019s coach. And then he kissed him, whispering in his ear. \u201cHe said he was happy to see me,\u201d Xavi revealed later. \u201cAnd I said: \u2018Me too.\u2019\u201d\nThe Barcelona coach was speaking for everyone. Well, sort of. Turns out that the World Cup star who most marked the return of domestic football was the one who doesn\u2019t actually play but doesn\u2019t half perform, the Spaniard who was in Qatar longer than any other. Antonio Mateu Lahoz \u2013 To\u00f1o to his mates, which he likes to think is everyone \u2013 did it again. A record-breaker for clubs and countries, the man whose name has become a verb was mateulahozing once more this weekend. The celebrity referee who handed out 17 cards during the Argentina-Netherlands quarter-final came home and immediately went one better, and without the benefit of extra time or penalties. Two matches, 35 cards, two all-time highs, and some show to restart football in Spain.\nThey had been waiting for this, if not this exactly. Talking about referees is not big, not clever and best avoided. Sometimes, though, it is inevitable \u2013 and not just in Spain where it\u2019s inevitable every time \u2013 and this was one of those. However hard you resist, Mateu Lahoz made it so on Saturday, at turns absolutely infuriating and very, very funny as he made history in the Catalan derby, providing the kind of wild New Year\u2019s Eve where even the numbers don\u2019t add up and the referees\u2019 report, which must have taken him to midnight to complete, certainly doesn\u2019t. Maybe this photo helps: Mateu Lahoz standing there like some gunslinger, yellow card in one hand, red in the other. At his side, Espanyol\u2019s Sergi G\u00f3mez just shrugs.\n\n\u201cChaos,\u201d Frenkie de Jong called it, having somehow survived two recent meetings with Mateu Lahoz without getting a card. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened exactly but the referee decided to give some red cards, I don\u2019t know why,\u201d the midfielder said after a match which ended 1-1, Joselu\u2019s second-half penalty equalising Marcos Alonso\u2019s early opener.\nSome? Mateu Lahoz might have forgiven Xavi with a kiss the first time but he did give the coach a red card in the 96th minute and that took him to 19: 15 yellows and four reds, one rescinded. No one has ever handed out more, his own record falling to the only man it could fall to, like the Sergey Bubka of referees. In a single afternoon, he handed out as many reds as all of the officials in Qatar put together, and one more yellow than he managed at Lusail. Which wouldn\u2019t have surprised everyone: after that quarter-final, when most in Spain were just pleased that everyone else finally knew what they were up against, Lionel Messi admitted that Argentina\u2019s players had been \u201cscared because we know what he is like\u201d.\n\nWhat he\u2019s like has often been exaggerated and has also changed. In a country where every referee is a suspect, always under attack, and the cynicism and bias comes invariably not from the judged but the judges; where the officials are handed a responsibility for results they simply don\u2019t have, some of the criticism of him is grotesque: as unfair as it is facile, the tone terrifying. Born in Valencia, where he is a PE teacher, Mateu Lahoz is one of six siblings, a father of two sons, a footballer who reached Segunda B level, and became a referee partly because his father passed away and the family needed the money. He first went mainstream a decade ago when Jos\u00e9 Mourinho praised him as the only man to let the game go, employing dialogue and not just discipline.\nSoon though, the things he did well were held against him: talking to players, calling them by their first names instead of by surname or a number became a stick to beat him with. Chatting was a crime, smiling a disgrace. Who does he think he is?! He\u2019s always trying to get on camera, they claimed as they turned their cameras on him, following every move, magnifying every gesture. A smile, a thumbs-up, a conversation with a player or fan, a wink to the camera or a wave to someone in the stands was proof that he should not be there. The people who accused him of thinking he is a celebrity made a celebrity of him; he\u2019s a showman, they said, editing his showreel. He became a dog with a bad name, like Rex or Spot, an all to easily easily identified public enemy \u2013 as if you become Spain\u2019s representative at the World Cup, or take charge of a Champions League final if you\u2019re irremediably awful, as if any decisions ever happen entirely in isolation.\n\n\nAnd yet it is also true that him getting those games baffles many here and he does have his moments; true too that he sometimes seems to follow his own rules, that he\u2019s not always easy to work out, that occasionally the discipline seems disproportionate or just daft. Or other times, nonexistent. It was certainly true that sometimes players found him disconcerting, hard to predict; not least because he wasn\u2019t always what he was supposed to be, the referee who opened dialogue suddenly deciding to shut all the doors, the chatty man turning all authoritarian. \u201cYou can\u2019t talk to him,\u201d Messi said of the referee who talked to them.\nA little before the World Cup break, in the last minute of one match, he gave Betis\u2019s Sergio Canales \u2013 just about the most polite player in La Liga \u2013 two yellow cards in 13 seconds. The first was for \u201cmaking observations\u201d and, after showing it, he warned Canales: \u201cIf you keep talking, I\u2019ll send you off.\u201d To which Canales replied: \u201cIf I can\u2019t talk, don\u2019t ask me about personal things, then,\u201d \u2026 and was sent off. Now, less than 24 hours after Xavi had said: \u201cI like him, he talks,\u201d he was at it again. La Liga had never seen anything like it.\n\nIt had started early, Ansu Fati booked for using his arm \u2013 the only one of Barcelona\u2019s eight yellow cards to be given for a foul \u2013 before Gavi and Brian Oliv\u00e1n were booked for \u201carguing with an opponent, without insults or threats\u201d. But the golden minutes were the five or 10 that followed Espanyol\u2019s penalty, when suddenly he was dishing out the cards like a croupier on crack. At around 73.50, Jordi Alba and Vin\u00ed de Souza were booked. On 74.58, Ferran Torres was. On 75.30, it was Pedri. On 76.13, Edu Exposito. On 76.56, Alba again, a red following, discussions starting. On 79.34, Souza got a yellow and Leandro Cabrera a red \u2013 which was taken off again on 84.29, via the VAR.\nIn case you\u2019ve lost track like everyone else, that\u2019s eight yellows, two reds, one taken away again, in five minutes 44 seconds (10 minutes, 39 seconds if you count the wait for the red to be removed), and 31 seconds of actual play. Or to use the referee\u2019s own report, there were yellow cards in minutes 74, 74, 74, 75, 76, 78, 80, 81, and reds in minutes 78 and 80. Six minutes for 10 cards. \u201cI told him he lost control,\u201d Xavi said. \u201cHe said: \u2018Do you think?\u2019\u201d\nThose numbers suggest a mass brawl, but there was none. A game out of control, but it was not the game that was out of control: it was a referee who didn\u2019t so much manage the situation badly as create it.\n\nThe stats suggest confrontations, bone-crushing challenges, but there were few. Of the yellow cards handed out, only five were for fouls, yet by the referee\u2019s own admission there were no insults or accusations. \u201cI\u2019m aware that sometimes I protest too much, but that wasn\u2019t the case this time,\u201d Alba insisted. When Mateu Lahoz booked Torres, his gaze was fixed, waiting for the Barcelona player to say something, the card out lightning fast. When he told Cabrera he had not been sent off after all, instead of contrition there was a defiant look. Of the 10 minutes and three seconds of injury time, less than five minutes was played, Mateu Lahoz seeming determined to have as many unnecessary conversations as he could. Like the VAR, it\u2019s not the decisions themselves that\u2019s the issue \u2013 it\u2019s what is done to the actual game.\n\nWhich is not always a bad thing. Because if there\u2019s a serious point here, there is also a silly one. It may be childish to laugh but it\u2019s also true. Worse is the way referees are attacked, there to be abused and discarded by those without the moral authority to stand in judgement, a useful scapegoat. In the final minutes, TV commentators were talking about how this was the definition of a derby but it wasn\u2019t the derby that made this dramatic, different: it was him. One Catalan paper insisted Mateu Lahoz had \u201cruined the spectacle\u201d, but that wasn\u2019t true: he is the spectacle. \u201cEvery party needs someone to get it going,\u201d Santi Gim\u00e9nez wrote in AS, \u201cand Mateu Lahoz was a dancefloor-filler like Chimo Bayo, capable of turning the dullest meeting into the most memorable piss-up.\u201d\nIn the end, history was made and maybe it was more fun this way; and if there were many things that were Mateu Lahoz\u2019s fault, the lack of football wasn\u2019t one of them. Nor was the result. \u201cI don\u2019t blame Mateu,\u201d said Xavi, the man he had come over to kiss at the start and sent off at the end.\n"

                    "body": "At the outset Gareth Bale said Wales\u2019s first World Cup since 1958 was about more than football and to that end at least they probably succeeded. \u201cHopefully in the future when you speak to people from other countries they won\u2019t ask where Wales is,\u201d he said.\nAfter leading Wales out of the tunnel to face England on Tuesday, he sipped on some water, chucked his bottle down towards the throng of photographers snapping away furiously pitchside and proceeded to rattle through the pre-match formalities. Lopsided team photograph. Another with match officials. Handshake with the referee. Lock hands with Harry Kane. Hand Kane a pennant stitched in Welsh. And \u2013 hang on a minute \u2013 give Kane a tricolour bucket hat.\nOn the eve of their Group B opener against the USA, Ben Davies made a slice of World Cup history by conducting a press conference entirely in Cymraeg, Welsh. For their second game, against Iran, teachers at Aaron Ramsey\u2019s old school, Ysgol Gyfun Cwm Rhymni in Caerphilly, scrapped the timetable so that children \u2013 one wearing a Wales shirt with the words Yma o Hyd, Dafydd Iwan\u2019s rousing anthem, the title of which has become a motto for many \u2013 could watch the game together.\n\nWelsh tattoo parlours have reported an influx of Yma o Hyd requests. Carlos Queiroz, the Iran head coach, made a point of praising the Red Wall, part of a charm offensive that perhaps influenced Wales\u2019s loyal fanbase when applauding Iran\u2019s players on their post-match victory lap.\nJob done? The reason for pointing out all of this is that Wales games have grown organically into something more than fans supporting 11 players trying to score a goal, into a showcase of national pride and cultural heritage guaranteed to warm the soul, regardless of the result.\n\nThe bucket hat, for example, has become synonymous with Wales fans, to the point where on match days it is easier to spot those not wearing one. In recent months, the Football Association of Wales put 10ft bucket hat art installations in Aberystwyth, Bangor, Cardiff, Swansea and Wrexham to celebrate their place on the biggest stage on a platform decorated with the words Cymru ar ben y byd, Wales on top of the world. Another giant bucket hat was launched on Doha\u2019s waterfront, ironically the day before fans had rainbow-coloured bucket hats confiscated at the Ahmad bin Ali stadium.\n\nOf course, dishing out a red, yellow and green bucket hat to England\u2019s captain, Tyler Adams and Ehsan Hajsafi does not mask what has been a deeply disappointing tournament on the pitch, one place where Wales certainly failed to make a lasting mark. \u201cWelcome to the big show,\u201d was Querioz\u2019s warm introductory message before the two nations met, but Wales got stage fright and went missing.\nWales head back to Cardiff with one point and one goal to their name. \u201cEveryone looked at the group and thought: \u2018Maybe they\u2019ll do this or that\u2019 but we played against three very good teams,\u201d said the defender Connor Roberts. \u201cI know England blew Iran away, but they are no mugs and they showed that against us.\u201d\nRob Page said the frustration really rankles because his team did not show their true colours. But maybe this is just where Wales are at now, the leading lights of the team dimmed. Ever since taking the reins, at first on a temporary basis and then permanently, signing a four-year contract in September, Page has spoken of key players regularly turning up for duty undercooked. Bale and Ramsey moved to California and the south of France respectively, effectively to prepare for this tournament, but the cautious optimism, in hindsight, looks misplaced.\nPage will review his options between now and March, when Wales begin their Euro 2024 qualifying campaign in Croatia. By the time that tournament comes around, Bale will be touching 35, Joe Allen 34 and Ramsey 33. There is unlikely to be great change but Wales must evolve. Joe Rodon, Neco Williams and Brennan Johnson will surely be given responsibility. The same goes for Ethan Ampadu who, at the age of 22, has amassed 40 caps, as many as John Toshack and more than John Charles. Ampadu headed down the tunnel in tears at full-time on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have a look at the squad and if there are young players out there that we need to push and promote, now\u2019s the time to do it,\u201d Page said after the 3-0 evisceration by England.\nOne of those will surely be the 17-year-old Luke Harris, a precocious talent viewed by Page as \u201cthe future of Welsh football\u201d who signed a professional contract with Fulham in September, a month before making his Premier League debut. The Jersey-born No 10 was spotted aged 14 at a tournament on Guernsey by Malcolm Elias, Fulham\u2019s chief academy scout who was influential in the development of Bale and Luke Shaw.\nBale has been at pains to provide some perspective in recent days and rightly so. Aside from the hosts, Wales, with a population of three million, were the smallest nation in Qatar. Many supporters were resigned to never seeing them on the biggest stage. In 2011, they were 117th in the Fifa rankings, sandwiched between Haiti and Grenada.\nPerhaps gripes about Wales\u2019s failure to lay a glove on three top-20 ranked opponents and reach the knockout stage at a World Cup can wait. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit disappointing, but for a lot of the players \u2013 myself included \u2013 I am ecstatic to be able to say that I represented my country at a World Cup,\u201d Roberts said.\nThe feeling of pride is mutual."

                    "body": "Risking players short on fitness or injured Gareth Southgate is not a fan of the 26-man tournament squad, believing it is more difficult to manage. And yet there is an upside. It allows him to include one or two players who have been out with injury and may not be ready to feature in the early ties. Before the European Championship in the summer of last year, which England kicked off on 13 June, Harry Maguire had been out with ankle ligament damage since 9 May and Jordan Henderson was only just coming back from the groin operation he underwent in late February. Southgate selected them both and it paid off handsomely in the case of Maguire, who missed the opening two group games but ended up in the team of the tournament. This time, Southgate has decisions to make over Kalvin Phillips and Kyle Walker \u2013 likely starters under normal circumstances. Phillips was named on the Manchester City bench on Wednesday night for the Carabao Cup tie against Chelsea, his first such involvement since undergoing shoulder surgery towards the end of September and came on after 50 minutes. His minutes total for the season before the game stood at 14. Walker, meanwhile, is behind him in terms of a comeback date after groin surgery on 4 October, although Pep Guardiola says Walker \u201cfeels really good\u201d. Both are expected to receive good news from Southgate. There is sadly no decision to make on Reece James, another key player, who has not played since injuring a knee for Chelsea on 11 October. He is simply too far away from fitness. Chilwell\u2019s absence to open door to another defender Poor Ben Chilwell. The Euros were a disaster for him on a personal level as he failed to appear and now he is out of the World Cup, having injured a hamstring for Chelsea last Wednesday. The good news for Southgate is that Luke Shaw, his first-choice left-back or left wing\u2011back, has rediscovered his form after a poor start to the season but where is the cover for him with Chilwell out? Most likely from Kieran Trippier, although, with James out and the uncertainty over Walker, the Newcastle player is in line to start on the right. Southgate considers Trippier to be ahead of Trent Alexander-Arnold. Could the manager call up a back-up left\u2011back, say Tyrick Mitchell or even the uncapped Ryan Sessegnon? Kyle Walker-Peters and James Justin, who can both play on the left, are injured. More likely is that he further bolsters the right side to free up Trippier to switch, which would bring into the equation Ben White, who is ahead of Joe Gomez in Southgate\u2019s thinking. White is expected to be selected and would offer an option at centre-half, where Fikayo Tomori and Marc Gu\u00e9hi appear to be battling for a single place. Tomori seems to have the edge, despite his poor performances in Milan\u2019s high\u2011profile Champions League defeats against Chelsea.  Is it time for Rashford? It was easy to worry that Marcus Rashford was finished last season. The Manchester United forward felt his confidence crash and it was pretty painful to watch him at times. Southgate dropped him for the friendlies against Switzerland and Ivory Coast in March and he noted a little pointedly that Rashford had pulled out of six of the previous eight squads. Rashford\u2019s last England appearance came in the defeat by Italy at the Euro final when he missed his penalty shootout kick. But he has been much better for United this season, playing with the pace and intent of old and scoring seven goals \u2013 even if his finishing has not always been lethal. Southgate selected Rashford for the 2018 World Cup. The player\u2019s pedigree, which takes in 12 England goals, is a part of his appeal and it would be a big surprise if Southgate did not recall him.  The battle to understudy Kane Rashford is a part of this and so, too, are Tammy Abraham, Ivan Toney and Callum Wilson. Southgate talks of having a batting order in each position, the sense being that if somebody is unavailable or drops off, he automatically moves to the next man down and it really takes something to disrupt what is a carefully calculated hierarchy. All of which is to say that Abraham appears to be in possession of a squad place up front, having been consistently called up since October of last year. And yet Southgate has been troubled by how he did not take his chance when he started the Nations League game against Italy in June (did anybody?) and the fact that he has scored only three goals for Roma this season. Toney won a first call-up for the internationals in September but Southgate did not give him his debut and it has left Wilson, who has been in eye-catching form for Newcastle, hopeful of timing a late run to perfection. Wilson won the last of his four caps in October 2019. Is there room for a wildcard? The short answer is probably not. James Maddison has shown his class for Leicester this season and delivered the goods (six goals, four assists in 12 Premier League games) to emerge as a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. But Southgate has overlooked the creative midfielder since giving him his only cap in November 2019. Ruben Loftus-Cheek, in assured touch for Chelsea and a veteran of the squad from the last World Cup, has pushed his claim but it seems that it has not been enough. It could also be that the West Ham winger Jarrod Bowen is squeezed out."

                    "body": "Sarina Wiegman is told to make herself at home when she arrives for an end-of-year sit-down with journalists at Wembley and she doesn\u2019t miss a beat in reply. \u201cI am home,\u201d she says with a wry smile that points towards the venue of the Lionesses\u2019 Euros triumph in the summer. Wiegman believes it is hard to compare a historic Euros win in 2017 for the Netherlands, her home nation, on home soil, with guiding England to a first major trophy because England were at a \u201cdifferent stage\u201d in their development and expectations in the Netherlands \u201cwere a lot lower\u201d. What is even harder is to try to comprehend how England can better an unbeaten year with a Euros win at its centre. \u201cYou can\u2019t beat that \u2013 you can only get equal on that,\u201d says Wiegman of 2022. \u201cWe actually don\u2019t talk about these results all the time. We want to win every game, but we talk about how we can improve the next game. How can we make sure that we perform at the highest level at the next game? How can we develop our style of play, making our chance of winning the next game as high as possible? Of course, we want to break all the records, but breaking a record doesn\u2019t say what you have to do. We always bring it back: how do we stick together as a team? I truly believe that\u2019s where it starts.\u201d  Wiegman has her players truly believing that too. The England squad and players on the fringes have taken to the manager. \u201cWe have to give clarity about the style of play, what\u2019s expected, what role and task players have, and then give them the freedom to make their own choices on the pitch,\u201d Wiegman says. \u201cThe players feel very comfortable with that.\u201d The new year brings the next challenge: the World Cup trophy that eluded Wiegman in 2019 when the Netherlands lost to the USA in the final. \u201cI\u2019m not about revenge; I\u2019m not really vengeful,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t really think that way. At that time, they were the better team, although I thought after half-time we could have won that game until the penalty. No, I don\u2019t really think of revenge, I just want to do better in the next game and I want to win.\u201d She will not be telling her new charges what it feels like to lose a World Cup final. \u201cIf you play your best game, like the England men did against France, [it could] be a win, could be a tie, could be a defeat, but you can be proud of yourself because you played at your highest level. You\u2019re going to be devastated by not winning, but at the end you can be proud because you did everything that\u2019s in your control and that\u2019s the level you have. That\u2019s how I approach it all the time because you can\u2019t always control the result because the other teams, the best teams in the world, are really, really, good. \u201cDon\u2019t always think of the result. We\u2019re not going to a World Cup just to play, we\u2019re going there to win. But that\u2019s not always what you can control. I was devastated against the USA, but I did think they were better at that point. I was even more devastated when we didn\u2019t win with the Netherlands against the USA in the Olympics because at that point we were absolutely the better team; we should have won that game.\u201d The task of bettering 2022 and winning a World Cup was made a bit harder with the announcement that Beth Mead, the Golden Ball and Golden Boot winner at the Euros, had joined a growing list of players to rupture an ACL, likely ruling her out of the tournament in Australia and New Zealand next July and August.  \u201cIt\u2019s so sad \u2013 I really feel for her of course,\u201d says Wiegman, who is not sentimental when it comes to keeping items related to her victories but does have the shirt she was given by Mead. \u201cEveryone who gets an ACL injury, you feel for them. She did so well, she was in such a good place \u2026 I hope she just will recover. It\u2019s too early to say whether she will be [available for the World Cup], so we just take it easy now.\u201d Mead has been joined in the treatment room by her partner and teammate at Arsenal Vivianne Miedema, who ruptured an ACL in last week\u2019s Champions League tie against Lyon. \u201cIn general, for the top, top-level players the schedule is too much,\u201d Wiegman says, when asked whether the growing fixture list was piling too high, before Fifa announced ambitions of launching a Club World Cup. \u201cFor the top players worldwide, we have five consecutive tournaments in a row, hopefully with the Olympics \u2026 The growth has gone so quickly so players also need a proper rest to get things settled down and they don\u2019t have that rest. \u201cAfter the Euros, for example, the Manchester City players only had a couple of days off because they went into the Champions League again. That is not good. You can have that sometimes, but they need a rest. They need some rest just to get some head space and get the head and body right. I think Fifa, Uefa and the federations just need to do a better job and all think of the players.\u201d Fifa\u2019s rejection of requests to increase squad sizes from 23 players to 26 for next year\u2019s World Cup to help lift the load is \u201cvery disappointing\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve been told that there had been some that did not want it to increase but the group of coaches I talked with at the draw all wanted it to increase,\u201d says Wiegman, who adds that she will take extra players to camps before the tournament in case of late injuries. The situation is not straightforward because whereas \u201cin Europe our infrastructure is really well [set up] \u2026 other continents are really struggling with getting good internal matches, so their need is to get more international matches. We don\u2019t need more international matches because we have very good domestic competitions. \u201cThat makes it complex, and still I think we can do a better job and just talk to each other and try to make it good for all. It\u2019s the same here when we talk about the schedule of the Women\u2019s Super League. \u201cYou have to look at what your philosophy is, what\u2019s your vision and then you have to prioritise and you have to make choices. And you have to dare to make the choices too. \u201cAnd then you can\u2019t keep everyone happy \u2013 that\u2019s impossible in life. As long as there\u2019s a vision behind it, you can argue [for the choices] you make.\u201d"

Maybe the most iconic moment was created by Tommie Smith and John Carlos, two American sprinters who raised their fists at the 1968 Olympics in protest at racism and injustice in their communities. Their freedom to speak, the risk they each took to protest, has helped shape sport\u2019s role in our society. You will know that going into this World Cup, several national federations and their teams had planned to wear a familiar rainbow armband \u2013 one they had worn in previous competitions. This was a simple and modest gesture \u2013 they wanted to shun prejudice and show solidarity with millions of people around the world who are not free to love whom they want. What followed \u2013 threats of sanctions against players, scrambling for answers by the federations \u2013 revealed the friction between players and the various sporting institutions, and an inability to look beyond their political wrangling to the values that might unite them. Overnight, a symbol of support became a source of institutional controversy \u2013 without a backup plan for that eventuality. And as often happens, the buck was passed to the players. We saw uncertainty about the level of sanction players might face (yellow cards? Match bans? Worse?), inconsistent messages from the federations and silence from those who could have taken clear decisions months before.  But how did it come to this? Why did a gesture of support meet such resistance? Why were players left to feel isolated when their actions came from a place of dignity and respect? \u201cI don\u2019t feel comfortable, and that is telling enough,\u201d Belgium\u2019s Jan Vertonghen said, as he struggled to understand \u2013 prior to his team\u2019s elimination \u2013 whether speaking on matters of human rights might have led to his suspension from the tournament.  There is an easy answer \u2013 that everything stems from the decision to host in Qatar. But that avoids deeper challenges that will remain beyond this World Cup. Peel away the details of the armband saga and we find, at its core, two questions. First, what are the values that sport will truly embrace and defend when it claims to be a unifying influence in a fragmenting world? And why are the players whose conduct on the field is regulated, who are called on to represent those values, not at the table when the rules and decisions are made that have such an impact on their sport? The latter question shows a repeated failure of football\u2019s governance system to listen and share power with the very people who bring the sport to life, on the pitch. A failure, ultimately, to open the decision-making to the people it directly affects. But the former question is more sensitive and complex than most reporting and commentary would have us believe. Major international sports events have never been free of geopolitics; propaganda, protests and boycotts are part of their history. And when the organiser strives to impose its identity and a single set of rules \u2013 not only to protect its commercial interests but also to provide a meeting point that is open to all \u2013 it might pursue a legitimate goal. But only if it accepts that all sport is rooted \u2013 deeply \u2013 in the society that feeds it.  Whatever the intention, any bid to isolate sport from our fundamental rights, as codified in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, ratified by all governments of the nations competing in this World Cup, and enshrined in the statutes of Fifa, is to abandon one of the few common standards available and to miss the rare opportunity of an equal framework for all people around the world. Sports organisations need to understand that their commitment to neutrality in matters of politics or religion cannot be applied to human rights. Inaction, or purported neutrality on matters of human rights, is a deeply political choice. When we see sport\u2019s place at the heart of our society, we see more clearly the role of our athletes: they are centre-stage, playing out the drama, channelling our emotions, even as they build their own professional careers. Theirs is a world that brings great rewards for some but also the demands of public life.  As an international trade union that represents 65,000 players around the world, our job is to protect their human rights, social conditions and economic prospects. We help them to excel as athletes, workers, colleagues, citizens, public figures and, above all, as human beings. But the expectations placed upon those players today are neither fair nor realistic. In any group of people you find some who want to speak and take a stance for what is bigger than themselves, and others who do not, even though they share the same values. Why would football players be any different? Many do want to talk, but freely, on their own terms, and independent of the decisions in which they have no say, of their federations, clubs or leagues. But if we ask them to find their voice, surely we must also respect their right to silence. Every player remains, first and foremost, a professional athlete. No one should coerce them into a public role they do not want; but if they do want to assume that role, they have the same right to do so as anyone else. This World Cup has put a harsh spotlight on all these difficult challenges. But the players and coaches are not alone. While much of the globe grapples with economic and social conflict, inequality and a growing sense of divorce from the decisions that shape our lives, the old models of closed, top-down governance are reaching their limits. Citizens of the most diverse societies are demanding a louder voice. Today, sport faces the very same challenge \u2013 from its players, its fans, and the general public. Players are now finding their voice \u2013 individually and collectively \u2013 in a system that for so long wanted them silent. Sports federations should embrace this \u2013 genuinely, openly, urgently \u2013 and share the stewardship of the game with those at the heart of it. Perhaps that will help us rediscover the spirit of humanity that many feel is lacking within our sporting institutions. Open the door, give players a say.

                    "body": "It began as a tale of two centre\u2011forwards and ended as a game of two goalkeepers. As the Netherlands began their World Cup campaign with a 2-0 win against Senegal, it had seemed the decisive factor would be the absence from the starting lineups of Sadio Man\u00e9, and Memphis Depay. But in the end it turned out to be about the two goalkeepers, the debutant Andries Noppert of the Netherlands, who had a fine game, and \u00c9douard Mendy of Senegal, who did not.\nFor Senegal, it had all seemed to be going well. With their fans drumming away behind Aliou Ciss\u00e9\u2019s bench, this sounded like a Cup of Nations game and, for a long time, it looked like a Cup of Nations game as well. There was very little width, a lot of bodies banging into each other in a congested centre, and only ever the vaguest sense that a goal might come.\nWhen one did eventually arrive, with six minutes remaining, it was for the Netherlands and Mendy was badly at fault. Nor did he impress with the decisive second that sealed the game deep into injury time.\n\nWith their three powerful central midfielders, Senegal had, for the most part, negated the Dutch but when Frenkie de Jong was given time to measure his cross from the left, Mendy was slow to react, allowing Cody Gakpo to get to the ball first and direct it into the net.\nThen, Depay, who had come off the bench just after the hour, was released on the break as Senegal chased the game, Mendy tamely pushed his low shot into the path of Davy Klaassen.\nGiven Senegal had the better of what few clear chances there had been before that, the contrast was obvious. The Dutch have so struggled with goalkeepers of late that Remko Pasveer, a 39-year-old who had never previously been capped, played in the last two games before the World Cup, but Noppert looked an inspired selection \u2013 an entirely characteristic Louis van Gaal gamble. As Noppert acknowledged, nobody else would have picked him.\nHis is a remarkable story. Noppert is 28 but has only ever played 45 league games. A late developer, he was briefly without a club after leaving Dordrecht in 2020 at which his family begged him to give up football.\n\nIt\u2019s as well for the Netherlands that he ignored them. Noppert made a tidy low save early in the second half to keep out an effort on the turn from Boulaye Dia, pulled off a far more spectacular block to deny Idrissa Gueye from the edge of the box with quarter of an hour remaining, and then made a sprawling save low to his right to keep out a long\u2011ranger from Pape Gueye just after the Dutch had taken the lead.\n\u201cHe has an open personality,\u201d said van Gaal, who seemed amused that Noppert had said in his post-match interview he is similar to his manager.\n\u201cHe is quite direct and outspoken, that is probably what he meant, but that does not mean he can be a coach. His quality is that he can stop balls and he did that three times today, perfectly.\u201d\nVan Gaal himself was in typically direct and outspoken mood. \u201cFrenkie de Jong? It was not his best match,\u201d he said, \u201cbut he gave the assist for the winning goal and that is Frenkie de Jong. It was a very tough match for us.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have that many difficulties when the opponent was in possession, but I was not happy with ball possession on our side, we were inaccurate and ran with the ball too much.\u201d\nTo an extent, that played into Senegal\u2019s hands. \u201cWe deserved at least a point from this match,\u201d said their coach Ciss\u00e9. \u201cWe had a definite plan from the outset. We had a plan to press them high up the pitch but eventually we had to drop back a little bit. We had chances but we didn\u2019t score.\u201d\nHe felt his side lost intensity after Cheikhou Kouyat\u00e9 was forced off with a twisted ankle and he must wait also on the fitness of the left\u2011back Abdou Diallo, who limped off with a muscle strain.\n\nSenegal\u2019s biggest injury issue, though, without question, is the absence of Man\u00e9. Ciss\u00e9 acknowledged it was \u201ca problem\u201d but insisted that \u201cthe players who did play did what was expected of them\u201d, particularly in \u201cshutting down their attacks on the wings\u201d. Van Gaal, at least, had the option of introducing Depay, whom he praised for bringing added \u201cprecision\u201d.\nNext up for Senegal are Qatar, who surely cannot be as bad again as they were in losing to Ecuador on Sunday. \u201cIf you lose the first match,\u201d Ciss\u00e9 said, \u201cthen the second match becomes like a final.\u201d\nQualification remains within their reach, but it is the Dutch who control the group."

                    "body": "The first thing to say is that Gareth Southgate has not outstayed his welcome. This honourable, dignified, intelligent coach is not to blame for England\u2019s latest heartbreaking World Cup defeat. There can no be recriminations, no anger, no calls for root-and-branch reform; all there is, in the cold light of day, is the bitterness of knowing that England went toe to toe with the world champions, used the right tactics and came up short only because Harry Kane\u2019s nerve betrayed him at the worst possible moment.\nIt hurts. \u201cMaybe it was because England were very good,\u201d Didier Deschamps said when he was asked why France spent so much of the game on the back foot. The France coach was under no illusions. Deschamps knew how close England had run the defending champions. Bukayo Saka and Jude Bellingham were irrepressible in attack, Declan Rice outstanding in midfield, Kyle Walker tireless against Kylian Mbapp\u00e9. This was different from the typical England exit, a world apart from the defeats by Croatia in 2018 and Italy in the Euro 2020 final, and only the most blinkered of Southgate\u2019s critics could possibly try to take this performance apart.\nBut it is not easy to be rational after watching England\u2019s hopes of winning the World Cup sail away when Kane\u2019s second penalty flew over the crossbar. Later, when Southgate appeared for his post\u2011match performance, he looked and sounded close to tears. \u201cTo go again takes a lot of energy,\u201d the 52\u2011year\u2011old said as thoughts turned to his future. \u201cYou have to make sure you are ready for that.\u201d\n\nSouthgate sounded ready to walk away. He has done this for six years and has experienced three crushing disappointments. The Football Association does not want him to go, particularly as there is no obvious successor, but how much does Southgate have left in the tank? Is it really fair to expect him to still be in charge when Euro 2024 qualifying begins in March? Maybe it is time for a return to club football.\nSouthgate, whose contract runs until December 2024, spoke about not wanting to outstay his welcome after the penalty shootout defeat in the Euro 2020 final. Patience has run thin since then; the grumbling grew during England\u2019s dismal Nations League campaign. Yet it is to be hoped that Southgate ignores the noise. He should listen to Kane, Rice and Harry Maguire calling for him to stay. These players love Southgate. There is a reason the mood around the camp was so positive throughout the tournament and, once the dust has settled, the FA will be desperate for Southgate to realise that his maturing side\u2019s efforts against France are proof that he can lead them to glory at the Euros.\n\nOf course there will be people waiting to dismiss Southgate as a mere FA suit. Only, two things can be true at once. Southgate is good at dealing with difficult questions away from football. He is also England\u2019s best manager since Sir Alf Ramsey. Just remember where they were after defeat by Iceland at Euro 2016 was followed by the humiliation of Sam Allardyce\u2019s pint of wine. The shirt could not have weighed more heavily.\nSouthgate changed everything. He stripped away the fear of playing for England but he also lifted an underperforming team. The idea that he is a lucky coach who always enjoyed easy draws is the usual English arrogance. In 2018 Southgate went to the World Cup with a game but callow squad. England, who had not won a knockout game since 2006, had no divine right to reach the last four by beating Colombia and Sweden.\nThat they exceeded expectations was down to Southgate covering up his side\u2019s weaknesses by switching to three at the back and focusing on set pieces; that their limitations were eventually exposed by Croatia was no great surprise.\nOf course Southgate could have reacted quicker to Luka Modric and Ivan Rakitic taking control for Croatia. He has made mistakes. At Euro 2020 he took England to their first final in 55 years, but he was slow to respond to Italy\u2019s fightback. Southgate, who had reverted to a back five, should have been bolder. Bringing on Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho just before the shootout was an error.\nEqually Southgate was a kick away from winning the European Championship. Football is random in its cruelty. He is not perfect, but the tactical preparation he undertakes with his staff is part of a driven culture. England were ready for France. Southgate ensured they were not inferior. He coached them well. It is not his fault that Harry Maguire lost Olivier Giroud for the winner.\n\nThe counter is that Maguire should not have started after losing his place at Manchester United. But is there a better English centre\u2011back out there? Southgate tends to get the big calls right. He backed Raheem Sterling at the Euros but rightly dropped the winger here. The gamble of starting Saka instead of Rashford against Senegal paid off. More depth in attack has given Southgate more freedom. There is an idea that he has finally lifted the handbrake, allowing his players to express themselves, but the reality is the attack has improved mainly because the midfield has become more balanced. Too cautious? Only if you\u2019ve paid no attention to England\u2019s performances in Qatar.\nThis is the moment for Southgate to push on. Bellingham is 19. Saka is 21, Phil Foden is 22. Rice, Mason Mount and Reece James are 23. Aaron Ramsdale, 24, will push Jordan Pickford for the No 1 spot, and there is plenty of young talent waiting to burst on to the scene. This cycle is not done. Why walk away now?\nThe FA must hold on to him. Nobody is better qualified to lead this team. The two best English candidates, Eddie Howe and Graham Potter, are unavailable. There are whispers of Thomas Tuchel or Mauricio Pochettino, but the mere whiff of a celebrity appointment is a reminder of the excesses of the Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson and Fabio Capello eras, of an assumption the only thing missing is a sprinkling of magic from afar, and above all an attempt to cover up the failure to produce more homegrown coaches by throwing money at the problem.\nIt would go against the calm of the past six years. The FA has invested in St George\u2019s Park, in developing coaches, and Southgate has been an integral part in the improvement in academies. Southgate was crucial before he became manager and he remains an asset now. He should not be asking us for more time. We should be begging him to stay."

That was the headline instruction, front and centre, on the Polish website gazeta.pl on Thursday morning after the tense, chaotic conclusion to Group C the night before. Poland had stumbled into the last 16 of the World Cup with a performance so devoid of ambition that the domestic media coverage seemed more like a postmortem than a celebration of reaching the knockout stages for the first time since 1986. It should have been a day of jubilation. Instead, there seemed to be a wide sense of embarrassment. \u201cWe will not tell our grandchildren by the fireplace years later about how the Polish national team progressed from the group at the 2022 World Cup,\u201d wrote Dariusz Tuzimek for SportowyFakty.pl. \u201cWhen they ask about it, we\u2019ll try to change the subject.\u201d  \u201cShould Lewandowski be ashamed? The whole world saw that,\u201d was the question in the headline of Tuzimek\u2019s article. \u201cOne Wojciech Szczesny was not enough for Argentina and Messi, but still we got through,\u201d said Polityka.\u200apl, a reference to the goalkeeper\u2019s individual heroics in defeat, including a breathtaking first-half penalty save from Lionel Messi. Facing Argentina and Messi was never going to be straightforward. Yet it was still a frustratingly poor, disjointed display from a team that began the evening top of Group C and in control of their destiny. By the end they were left counting yellow cards \u2013 and praying. As has so often been the case at Poland\u2019s recent tournament appearances, Lewandowski was left isolated, despite Karol Swiderski being nominally selected to play alongside him. The Barcelona forward was left fighting for scraps: on the occasions Poland did win possession he sometimes battled impressively to win a free-kick around halfway. But he never looked like making a significant impact, certainly not compared to the ever-threatening Messi. Swiderski, who did not look sure what he was supposed to be doing, mostly became an extra defender rather than a companion for Lewandowski. Even when Lewandowski\u2019s teammates got close enough to link, it felt fragmented and lacking fluency. Despite a lack of service Lewandowski was not above criticism, either. Rather than attempting to inspire the team after they fell behind after half-time, he appeared increasingly withdrawn, his body language negative.  The closest Poland came to scoring, appropriately, was a set piece nodded fractionally wide by the centre-back Kamil Glik.  After the final whistle at Stadium 974, when coverage switched to Saudi Arabia v Mexico, it was an immediate reminder of what matches look like when both teams pose an attacking threat. The Saudis underlined the point during a thrilling conclusion by scoring a beautifully worked goal that in effect ended Mexico\u2019s hopes of progress. The former defender and Poland captain Jacek Bak said Napoli\u2019s Piotr Zielinski was the team\u2019s \u201cinvisible representative\u201d. He wondered aloud whether the playmaker had \u201ca mental problem\u201d when playing for his country. It seemed an appropriate question given the 28-year-old\u2019s indifferent performance against Argentina, give or take a couple of decent set-piece deliveries. Zielinski is the creative linchpin for Luciano Spalletti\u2019s Partenopei, who lead Serie A by eight points. They are unbeaten in the league, with 13 wins from 15 matches, and have scored 37 goals. In September they memorably thrashed Liverpool 4-1 in the Champions League. Where is that swashbuckling player? And could the fault lie not with the players but the coach, Czeslaw Michniewicz? Would Zielinski perform better in a central position, where his range of passing and searching runs could do more damage? He also needs someone to shore up the central areas to give him licence to attack. Unfortunately Qatar 2022 appears to be a tournament too far for the former Sevilla, Paris Saint-Germain and West Brom holding midfielder Grzegorz Krychowiak. There is a parallel between Poland\u2019s frustrating, traumatic history at major tournaments and England\u2019s travails pre-Russia 2018. They do not lack talent but they never seem able to fully show it, to become equal to or greater than the sum of their parts. Many of the players seem fearful of harsh media treatment, conscious of the anger stirred up when pre-tournament hype is regularly replaced by another limp failure. They have often been paralysed by the potential consequences of elimination, rather than motivated by the elusive rewards of success at a World Cup. The cumulative effect of so many disappointments feeds the anxiety.  The good news? They are still in the game. There were times when Poland succeeded in shackling Messi, \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda and Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez quite effectively. At times driving runs by the full-backs, Matty Cash and Bartosz Bereszynski, helped to make inroads. Collectively they must carry that defensive solidity into Sunday\u2019s last-16 meeting with Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and friends. But they must also find a way to take the game to the world champions, to cherish possession rather than surrender it. Standing off and inviting pressure will be a one-way ticket home. Has anyone told Poland \u2013 and Michniewicz \u2013 that this is meant to be the greatest show on earth? Their supporters must pray they will find a way to release the handbrake against France. Support Lewandowski, unleash Zielinski. Zagrajmy w pilke: Let\u2019s play ball."

But the towering BC Place was deathly silent. John Herdman\u2019s side, who bridged a 36-year gap to qualify for the Qatar World Cup and light a wildfire of interest in the team, had taken a protest against their own governing body to its most drastic point.

Canada Soccer had managed to lose not one but two friendlies in less than a week and a whole lot more besides. Millions of dollars in ticket revenue, oceans of goodwill and positivity that Alphonso Davies and co had brought to the sport here. All of it. A statement from the players two hours before kickoff made clear that a standoff over World Cup bonuses has now morphed into something much bigger. They blasted the association, saying: \u201cCanada Soccer has disrespected our team and jeopardized our efforts to raise the standards and effectively advance the game in Canada.\u201d They made five significant demands which included Qatar 2022 payments, but also aimed to reshape how the game is run here. As dismayed fans milled around outside the venue in Vancouver, dozens in Davies No 19 jerseys, some digested the players\u2019 lengthy statement and lamented that a team who had become just the second Canadian men\u2019s side ever to qualify for a World Cup were now being forced to perhaps prove why success has been such a rare feeling here. Canada Soccer, an association for whom dysfunction has been a much more frequent visitor, don\u2019t appear nearly ready to meet this moment. Cochrane\u2019s bizarre boast wasn\u2019t the only head-scratching moment in a delayed press conference where he was joined by Canada Soccer president Nick Bontis. The pair provided plenty of overly earnest generalities and apologies to the fans but little in concrete detail and, as a result, not a lot of promise that this latest mess will come to a clean end any time soon.  The players\u2019 demands called for changes in leadership of Canada Soccer, an equitable pay and bonus structure with the country\u2019s women\u2019s team, a 40% cut of Qatar prize money, better perks for the tournament and, most significantly, called for clarity on a 2019 agreement the association made with an entity called Canada Soccer Business, closely tied to the country\u2019s upstart domestic competition, the Canadian Premier League. The 10-year deal sees CSB guarantee Canada Soccer $3m in annual revenue, but CSB get to capitalize on both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s national teams by handling all sponsorship and broadcast deals. In these unprecedented times of success and interest in the game here, the deal looks particularly flawed. \u201cWe want to know who signed this deal that has hand cuffed our association,\u201d the player statement read. \u201cWhy have Canada Soccer given up autonomy of the greatest opportunity to grow our program in years?\u201d Bontis defended the CSB agreement and said it had been \u201cpivotal\u201d to growing the game here. He also claimed that the men\u2019s demands related to World Cup finances were \u201cuntenable\u201d. \u201cIf we as an association only had the men\u2019s team and the women\u2019s team to take care of and nothing else \u2026 we still could not afford this proposal,\u201d he said pointing to programs like futsal, para sport, underage teams and referees. But that immediately begged the question as to why World Cup revenue should be needed to find such areas. If Herdman\u2019s side had fallen short in qualification, would those programs have simply been wound up? There were a few more answers from the pair but each begged more questions. The most pressing one, of course, is what next? Curacao is the literal answer. The minnows are due to pitch up in Vancouver this Thursday for Concacaf Nations League action. Whether they will get a game or, like Panama, merely fly all the way for a private training session at BC Place remains to be seen. The leadership were headed straight back to the team hotel and said they were ready to talk to the players again. But given how the initial conversations went, things weren\u2019t looking good. One source told the Toronto Star that Bontis had got on his knees and begged players to take Canada Soccer\u2019s deal ahead of the Panama game. To add yet another layer, the country\u2019s women\u2019s team later released a statement that took a more positive tone to Canada Soccer\u2019s most recent offer while also apparently taking issue with the wording of the men\u2019s statement around equitable pay. All of this on the back of the US Soccer Federation reaching a groundbreaking deal with its men\u2019s and women\u2019s national teams. The men\u2019s team agreed to return to training on Monday while negotiations continue. \u201cThe players have met with senior leaders at Canada Soccer \u2026 and will continue the negotiation process, but questions have yet to be answered and actions have yet to be taken,\u201d said a statement. \u201cWe move forward in hopes that Canada Soccer will work with us to resolve the situation.\u201d What\u2019s clear is that time is neither on the association\u2019s side nor on Herdman\u2019s. Before Friday, the Englishman had just 16 training days and a handful of games with his squad before they face Belgium, Croatia and Morocco in Qatar. They lost two training sessions and their most meaningful game of this window. As Canada Soccer dither and cry poor with their convoluted finances, the manager is left counting the cost."

                    "body": "England\u2019s footballers are on the verge of the World Cup knockout stages despite a turgid goalless draw against the USA. But their lack of imagination and guile will surely temper expectations about whether they have the class to go all the way in Qatar.\nThe good news for Gareth Southgate\u2019s side is that they only need to avoid losing to Wales by more than three goals on Tuesday to progress to the last 16. They know, too, that in almost every major tournament they are liable to put in the odd whiffer of a performance. But the loud boos from England supporters at the end suggested that this was a proper stinker.\nGone was the free-flowing football that blitzed Iran 6-2. That performance was so unusually bold and aggressive that Southgate was universally lauded for taking the handbrake off his young side. Here, though, England\u2019s manager was altogether more cautious. The gear stick was pushed into reverse. The handbrake yanked back up.\n\nEven so, England remain on top Group B on four points, one ahead of Iran and they remain firmly in the box seat to qualify for a knockout tie against either the Netherlands, Ecuador or Senegal.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t our best performance for sure,\u201d admitted their captain, Harry Kane, afterwards. \u201cWe weren\u2019t clinical. But overall we were playing a tough team, and we move on.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a draw at a World Cup. No game is easy. People thought after our first performance we would landslide every team, but that\u2019s not the case. It leaves us in a really good position.\u201d\nEngland started brightly enough and had the best early chance when Kane\u2019s shot was blocked by defender Walker Zimmerman. But the US team became increasingly assertive, with midfielder Weston McKennie shooting over from the penalty spot and the Chelsea forward Christian Pulisic hitting the bar.\nIf Southgate was hoping for a response in the second half, he was to prove sadly disappointed, even if the introduction of Jack Grealish briefly galvanised his side.\nHowever the England manager was upbeat afterwards, saying: \u201cIt was exactly the sort of game I thought it would be, a good opponent who were very athletic. Some of the quality in the final third could have been a little bit better, but we\u2019ve shown great resilience to defend against opponents who kept asking questions. We\u2019re not going to roll through a tournament, and sweep through everybody without having nights like that.\u201d\n\nBefore the match the Football Association lit the Wembley arch in rainbow colours to protest at not being able to wear the OneLove armband, which was designed to be a symbol of inclusivity and tolerance at a tournament in a country where LGBTQ+ community is criminalised.\nThe FA\u2019s chief executive, Mark Bullingham, also spoke for the first time about how unspecified threats from Fifa, football\u2019s governing body, had stopped Kane wearing the armband against Iran.\nHe explained to ITV: \u201cOn the day of the game they came here with five officials and they ran us through a scenario where at a minimum anyone wearing the armband would be booked and face disciplinary action on top of that.\u201d\nBullingham said that the FA had backtracked on their initial pledge after being warned that any player wearing the armband could face a ban of multiple matches. \u201cWe are frustrated, we\u2019re angry, we thought it was outrageous the way this was handled,\u201d he added. \u201cWe wanted to show our support to the community and were not able to do so.\u201d\nHowever Bullingham was criticised by the former England striker Ian Wright, who said that the team should have gone through with their protest, regardless of Fifa\u2019s threats. \u201cIt\u2019s a valid point of view,\u201d Bullingham said. \u201cWe felt that we couldn\u2019t put the players in that position \u2013 the World Cup which many of them had dreamt of playing in since they were young \u2013 suddenly they may not be able to play a part in it.\u201d\n\n\nMeanwhile despite Fifa reiterating its promise that anyone wearing rainbow-coloured attire would be allowed into matches, a BBC cameraman wearing a rainbow watch strap was initially stopped by security and refused entry, while a Times reporter with a rainbow wristband was also questioned.\nHowever, England fan Sayed Tangam, an IT worker from Croydon, said that he had been impressed by the kindness of the Qatari hosts. \u201cThe way everyone has behaved to us has been exemplary,\u201d he said. \u201cThe four of us have booked a service apartment for $400 a night and we plan to watch three games in the four days we are here.\u201d His friend Raja Hyderali, an IT consultant from Orpington, insisted that England still had the side to progress deep into the competition. \u201cPlayer for player we have a stronger squad than in 2018, and if Kane stays fit, we can go really far,\u201d he said.\nTrue. But this will be a night from which England will want to quickly reset \u2013 and forget."

                    "body": "In Ban Jelacic Square there was not a soul who cared about the Friday night temperature, which had plummeted towards freezing. A reveller removed his shirt and dived into a nearby fountain; it always takes one to go first and soon enough he had company. Zagreb\u2019s city centre was packed, celebrations continuing into the early hours under the shine of Christmas decorations. Now a country wonders whether it, and the football team that continue to defy belief, can do it all again twice more.\nWalking out of a stadium 2,400 miles away in Doha, a smiling Josip Juranovic clutched a plastic bag. Its contents were inescapably yellow and it did not take much to prise out the nature of his loot. Croatia\u2019s right-back had managed to swap shirts with his idol, Dani Alves, a non-playing substitute, who is squeezing out every last drop of a stellar career at 39.\nShould Alves ever pluck up the courage to watch a rerun of Brazil\u2019s latest quarter-final exit, he would see familiar traits in Juranovic. The Celtic player rampaged forward whenever possible and was rarely outdone at the back, seeing off the challenge of Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior within 64 minutes. It was a distillation of what Croatia achieved at Education City: their opponents had arrived with songs in their hearts and a quickstep in their feet but came second in all the charts that mattered.\n\nJuranovic may never share a dressing room with Alves but knows the benefit of a wise, evergreen teammate better than most. \u201cWe believe in our team, especially our oldest players,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is my first tournament and they said some words to us younger ones.\u201d\nIt is all relative: in footballing terms the 27-year-old is middle-aged. But Luka Modric has seen it all and forgotten anything else; this was another big occasion when the veteran set the tone with a colossal performance that seemed to pull everyone else along.\n\u201cFor me he\u2019s in the top five midfielders of all time,\u201d said the left-back Borna Sosa. \u201cNobody, absolutely nobody, has performed to his level at 37. When it\u2019s most important he gives us this experience and confidence. He\u2019s really calm on the ball and hopefully he will stay with us as long as he can.\u201d\nIn this nick it would be foolhardy to dismiss at least a European Championship swansong from Modric in 18 months\u2019 time. The mechanism he runs with Marcelo Brozovic and Mateo Kovacic has no parallel in this World Cup. \u201cI can say we have the best midfielders,\u201d Juranovic said. \u201cIf they\u2019re on their game we control 90% of it and because of that I think we win.\u201d\nIt is a fair assessment. Croatia are not polished in every area but it rarely tends to matter: the three in the centre take a grip their way. It is a collection of cogs that works through glances, appreciation of half-space, moving possession in a steady wave rather than through a lightning bolt of transition. Against Brazil they barely created a chance until extra time. What they did, beyond opportunities that were carved out in isolated attacks rather than through concerted spells of pressure, was treat the match as if it was to be played purely in the middle third.\nKeeping the opponent at one arm\u2019s length while not pushing unduly with the other: that is the balance Croatia strike. They have the confidence to do it and the psychological edge from another shootout success is real. \u201cWhen the scores were level it was a really good feeling because we knew that, if it comes to penalties, we have the edge on our side,\u201d Sosa said.\nThat was echoed by Juranovic. \u201cWhen we equalised for 1-1 I was thinking: \u2018Yeah, we have this,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nWhen does an underdog cease being an underdog? Legend and accepted wisdom are developed through layers of experience and achievement: a 31-year-old country of 3.9 million has reached at least the semi-final stage in three of its seven entries at this level. It does not matter whether they got there via the flair of Suker, Prosinecki and Stanic or the durability of their indomitable successors. Croatia have long passed the consistency test and should not be considered a notch below Argentina. It is among the small clutch of leading football nations from this era and the past one.\n\u201cWe showed in the Nations League against France and Denmark that we are one of the top teams in the world,\u201d Juranovic said of a campaign when they took 10 points from four games against those opponents, including two away wins. Their only defeat in 21 games since a rollercoaster Euro 2020 exit to Spain was an anomalous no-show against Austria, which Modric did not start. In form like this, what are an extra pair of high-octane assignments for that triumvirate in the engine room?\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have 25 players who are playing for Barcelona and Real so everybody has to be ready,\u201d Sosa said. \u201cLuka is playing every game because he has to. There is no place for him to rest, because we need him every second on the pitch.\u201d\nModric and Croatia have made it this far, yet again: the water in those fountains may be even chillier on Tuesday but they look ready to light their biggest fire yet."

                    "body": "\u201cWhat\u2019s the lowest-ranked club side to send a player to the World Cup? Has anyone from the second or third tier popped up in a WC finals?\u201d tweets George Davidson. Second or third? How about the seventh tier? But first, let\u2019s acknowledge some of the higher-profile players who went to a World Cup while slumming it in the lower leagues. \u201cSome scandals in Italy that resulted in clubs being relegated provide a few examples,\u201d writes Jonathan Bartley. \u201cIn 1982, during the fallout from the Totonero scandal, Milan were relegated to Serie B for the second time in three seasons, this time on sporting merit. That summer Franco Baresi and Fulvio Collovati were in Italy\u2019s World Cup-winning squad, with Collovati playing every game, and Joe Jordan scored for Scotland against the USSR. \u201cJuventus were relegated in 2006 and had a few players at that year\u2019s World Cup who stayed with the club in Serie B the following season: Pavel Nedved, Gigi Buffon, Alessandro Del Piero, Mauro Camoranesi and Robert Kovac.\u201d Buffon, Del Piero and Camoranesi, like Collovati and Baresi in 1982, went on to lift the trophy.  As Emanuele Giulianelli points out, the future Bangor City manager Pedro Pablo Pasculli won the World Cup with Argentina in 1986 shortly after his club Lecce had been relegated to Serie B, scoring the only goal in the win over Uruguay in the last 16. While we\u2019re on a Serie B tip \u2013 and we still can\u2019t quite believe this happened \u2013 the wonderful Gheorghe Hagi spent the 1993-94 season in Italy\u2019s second tier with Brescia before having the time of his life at USA 94. He was soon bought by Barcelona.  Old Gold goal machine Steve Bull was in the second tier with Wolves when he appeared for England at Italia 90. So was John Aldridge (Tranmere) when he scored for Ireland against Mexico (and, more memorably, almost chinned a Fifa official) four years later. A generation earlier, Sweden\u2019s Agne Simonsson made an even greater impact.  At the same tournament, the Wales squad was \u2013 and we say this with love, especially given what they achieved \u2013 a bit of a motley crew.  The \u201cone\u201d was midfielder George Baker, who played for Plymouth in Division Three South. The current squad includes two players from League Two, AKA tier four: Chris Gunter of AFC Wimbledon and Jonny Williams of Swindon Town. But the best answers come from the 2006 World Cup, specifically the squads of Togo and Trinidad and Tobago. \u201cIn 2006, they took Dennis Lawrence, who was playing at fourth-tier Wrexham, and Evans Wise, who was playing in Germany\u2019s fifth tier for Waldhof Mannheim,\u201d writes Leigh Cartwright. \u201cBrent Sancho, Ian Cox, and Chris Birchall were also selected from League One (Gillingham, Gillingham, and Port Vale, respectively).\u201d  \u201cDuring the same tournament, three Togolese footballers represented clubs on the lower rungs of French football,\u201d adds Chai in Atalanta. \u201cAffo Erassa played for AS Moulins (tier three), Alaixys Romao played for Louhans-Cuiseaux (tier three) and Richmond Forson played for amateur team Vend\u00e9e Poir\u00e9 sur Vie in R\u00e9gional 1 (tier seven).\u201d Finally, Florian Camphausen has news of the one that got away. \u201cSherif Tour\u00e9 Coubageat from German seventh-tier club Concordia Ihrhove did play a few minutes for Togo in the 2006 Africa Cup of Nations. But he was not called up to represent them at the World Cup.\u201d Some people have no respect for trivia. The great World Cup flops \u201cHas any team ever qualified with a 100% record and then lost all three matches in their group? If not, what\u2019s the worst World Cup performance for a team with a flawless record in qualification?\u201d tweets Andy Brook. Let\u2019s start with an unlikely contender: Germany. Joachim L\u00f6w\u2019s team were both holders and favourites in 2018, having qualified with 10 wins out of 10 and a goal difference of +39. Schadenfreudians will never forget what happened next. They were shocked by Mexico, scraped a late win over Sweden and then fell in a heap against South Korea. OK, they didn\u2019t lose all three, but it was a shocking turn of events.  In the modern era, where qualification is increasingly long-winded, few teams win every game. None of the 32 teams at Qatar 2022 did so. The majority of sides with perfect qualification records \u2013 a list that includes iconic teams like Brazil 1970, Brazil 1982, West Germany 1982 and Spain 2010 \u2013 went at least as far as the quarter-finals. We think that only two sides have lost all three group games at the World Cup after qualifying with a perfect record, and they\u2019re both Mexican. In 1950, Mexico reached Brazil by hammering the United States and Cuba home and away, scoring 17 goals in four games. But the step up was painful: they lost 4-0 to Brazil, 4-1 to Yugoslavia and 2-1 to Switzerland. Twenty-eight years later they won all five games in the Concacaf Championship, scoring 20 goals in the process. In Argentina they found life much tricker. A side that included a teenage Hugo S\u00e1nchez lost 3-1 to Tunisia (the first time an African team had won a World Cup game), 6-0 to West Germany and 3-1 to Poland.  (A bit of housekeeping. Many of the early World Cups either went straight to the knockout rounds or had three-team or two-team groups. For example, in 1954 there was a team that won every qualifying match and then lost both their group games. Yep, it was Mexico.) Better late than never \u201cWhich late call-up/injury replacement has been the biggest success story at a World Cup?\u201d tweets David Ardisson. The first person who springs to mind is Josimar, the unknown, uncapped, unemployed Brazilian right-back who scored two absurd screamers at Mexico 86 after being called up as a late replacement for Leandro. You can read about his story here.  \u201cJust Fontaine holds the record for goals at a World Cup finals, 13 in 1958,\u201d writes David Warriston. \u201cIn the previous four years he had managed only two games for the national team. The fact he played all six games in Sweden wearing another player\u2019s boots supports the idea that he was not originally part of the coach\u2019s plans.\u201d Fontaine did play in friendlies in March and April 1958, so we\u2019re not 100% sure he qualifies as a late call-up. But if he does, we should also include Salvatore Schillaci. After a fine first season with Juventus, he made his Italy debut on 31 March 1990. You know the rest. Chris Woods: an apology In last week\u2019s Knowledge, we looked at players who had been to multiple tournaments without getting on the field. And inevitably, we made a cock-up.  Knowledge archive \u201cPanini have to select the players for their World Cup sticker albums in advance of the squads being announced \u2013 so what has been the most glaring omission?\u201d enquired Dan Leach in 2018. Publishing schedules mean Panini and other sticker-album manufacturers cannot wait for the World Cup squads to be announced \u2013 and they certainly can\u2019t wait for unlikely heroes to emerge once the tournament starts. That, and the fact the albums usually contain around 16 players rather than the full squad, inevitably means a few have slipped through the net. \u201cA mega one from Italia 90 would surely be Salvatore Schillaci, who was not included in the Italy spread,\u201d began Ben Raza. \u201cTo be fair, he only had one cap to his name when the tournament began. The only striker who came close to matching his feats was Roger Milla \u2026 who also wasn\u2019t featured. Nor was David Platt, if we\u2019re talking about England.\u201d  These are the most notable omissions: 1970: Clodoaldo (Brazil), Roberto Boninsegna (Italy). 1974: Rainer Bonhof and Bernd H\u00f6lzenbein (West Germany), Jan Jongbloed, Wim Jansen and Wim Rijsbergen (Netherlands), Andrzej Szarmach and Wladyslaw Zmuda (Poland), El\u00edas Figueroa (Chile). 1978: Arie Haan and Dick Nanninga (Netherlands), Antonio Cabrini (Italy). 1982: Alessandro Altobelli (Italy), Manuel Amoros (France). 1986: Josimar (Brazil), Igor Belanov (USSR), Peter Beardsley (England). 1990: Salvatore Schillaci (Italy), Sergio Goycochea (Argentina), Roger Milla (Cameroon), David Platt and Mark Wright (England). 1994: Aldair, Mazinho and Viola (Brazil), Andr\u00e9s Escobar (Colombia), Daniele Massaro (Italy). 1998: Emmanuel Petit and Bixente Lizarazu (France), Edgar Davids (Netherlands), Michael Owen and Alan Shearer (England), Javier Zanetti (Argentina). 2002: Ronaldinho (Brazil), Miroslav Klose (Germany), Nicky Butt (England). 2006: Jens Lehmann (Germany), Maxi Rodr\u00edguez (Argentina). 2010: Pedro (Spain), Thomas M\u00fcller (Germany). 2014: Benedikt H\u00f6wedes (Germany), Tim Krul (Netherlands).  Can you help?   \u201cEthan Ampadu has more Welsh international caps than appearances for any one club team. Has anyone else managed this?\u201d asks Rob Berry.

                    "body": "  2.31pm    And that concludes the blog. Thanks all for your company and comments, now join Rob Smyth for France v Poland. Enjoy!      2.30pm    \u201cNot exactly a classical back four ,\u201d emails Ben Dunn, \u201cbut Parma circa 1999, Canavaro, Sensini, Thuram in front of Buffon \u2013 pretty solid. AC Milan with Tassotti, Baresi, Maldini, and Costacurta were a difficult bunch to score against too, although I did like Nesta when he came in.  No lies here.      2.27pm    In fairness, we\u2019ve all done it.      2.26pm    Elsewhere, in League 1, Wycombe lead Portsmouth 2-0. Here\u2019s the former\u2019s manager, Gareth Ainsworth, who appears to have come to the game straight from the discotheque.       2.23pm    In the WSL, Man City lead Brighton 2-0 after 19 minutes, and Chloe Kelly is wreaking havoc.      2.23pm    Coming to the Premier League very soon:      2.21pm    Not a back four, but Bergomi, Gentile, Scirea, Collovati, Cabrini must\u2019ve been pleasant to encounter, and Vogts, Beckenbauer, Schwartzenback, Breitner is also nice.      2.18pm    \u201cBest back four,\u201d says David Watton. \u201cAm I a maniac for thinking Neville, Rio, Terry, Cole has to be in with a shout? With Woodgate, Southgate, Ledley King, Sol Campbell and, er, no right-backs or indeed left-backs on the bench? Solid. Can\u2019t really argue against the classic Dixon, Adams, Bould, Winterburn either.\u201d That England one should\u2019ve been up there, but I suppose didn\u2019t do enough when it had to \u2013 maybe, had Ferdinand been, er, available for Euro 2004, that\u2019d be different. But the strength in depth was incredible. Another good domestic one is Brown, Ferdinand, Vidic, Evra, likewise Ferreria, Carvalho, Terry, Cole.      2.10pm    Back to our sub discussion, Adam Bateman tweets thusly: \u201cCasey Stoney had the right idea, to call them \u2018game changers\u201d rather than subs, because that is exactly what they are.\u201d Casey Stoney has a lot of right ideas. When Gareth Southgate turns it in, I\u2019d love for her or Emma Hayes to take the job, if they were up for it.      2.03pm    Earlier, I beseeched for footage of Almer\u00eda v Hearts and you\u2019ll be ecstatic to know that the internet hasn\u2019t let us down.      1.59pm    I think I preferred it when Thuram held the record.   On which point, is that back four \u2013 Thuram, Desailly, Blanc, Lizarazu \u2013 the best we\u2019ve ever seen? Panucci, Baresi, Costacurta, Maldini is up there, but can\u2019t think of too many others.      1.56pm    I\u2019m really pleased Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 is getting into the France side on a reg. He has the raw materials to be one of the most devastating players in the game, and now he\u2019s saying fit, we\u2019re beginning to see that. The first time I saw him play, in pre-season friendly for Dortmund v Man United, I thought he\u2019d be a superstar, and though it\u2019s not yet happened, he\u2019s still got time.      1.54pm    The teams for that one: France: Lloris, Kound\u00e9, Varane, Upamecano, T.Hern\u00e1ndez, Tchouam\u00e9ni, Rabiot, Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, Griezmann, Mbapp\u00e9, Giroud. Poland: Szczesny, Bereszynski, Glik, Kiwior, Cash, Krychowiak, Zielinski, Szymanski, Frankowski, Kaminski, Lewandowski.  Updated at 1.54pm GMT    1.45pm    Rob Smyth\u2019s France v Poland blog is live\u2026  \u2026we\u2019re an hour 15 away from World Cup FootballTM!     1.41pm    I said earlier that Marcus Rashford is a really good sub\u2026      1.38pm    Back to today\u2019s first game, it\u2019s hard but not impossible to see a way for Poland. France have been impressive, it\u2019s true, but it\u2019s also true that mainly, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 has been impressive. If he\u2019s off it, or if he can be crowded out, with Robert Lewandowski up front and Piotr Zielinski out wide, Poland are in the game. That they\u2019ve only scored against Saudi can\u2019t be ignored \u2013 they\u2019re big outsiders \u2013 but they\u2019ve a puncher\u2019s chance if France are off it.  Updated at 1.38pm GMT    1.33pm    In whose countenance have you felt something similar? I\u2019ve got Eric Cantona, my hero, and Denis Law, my dad\u2019s hero.      1.32pm    But I\u2019m going to interrupt because I\u2019m just watching footage of Tite speaking about Pel\u00e9, saying he\u2019s the only person whose presence caused him to shake. He calls him \u201cthe human representation of health,\u201d which is lovely. I wrote the other day that in 1958, he incarnated youth forever, and it\u2019s great that the news on him has improved.       1.28pm    We\u2019ve not really chatted about France v Poland, so let\u2019s! To kick-off, here\u2019s our briefing.      1.25pm    \u201cSecond best random duet on the internet,\u201d emails Mark Hooper. Glorious!      1.21pm    Everything that no one wants to see. Video footage please!      1.19pm    Senegal are, though, a good and settled side. But if you\u2019re pushing me, I\u2019d say that the absence of Cheikhou Kouyat\u00e9 and Idrissa Gueye tips the balance strongly in England\u2019s favour.      1.15pm    Senegal, meanwhile, are enjoying life. What a shame Sadio Man\u00e9 isn\u2019t with them.      1.06pm    Sky have heard, and Talksport are reporting, that it\u2019s Saka on the right and Foden on the left for England. I\u2019m a little surprised by that \u2013 of the four wide attackers, I thought Foden was the least likely to start. But he\u2019s a brilliant player, probably the best of them, and my guess as to the rationale? He wants the width kept, so a natural left-footer on the left, and knows Rashford is fantastic sub.      1.04pm    Which puts me in mind of one of the greatest videos on the internet. There aren\u2019t many tunes that feature on every party playlist I ever make but this is one \u2013 and what a moment at the end.      1.01pm    I just watched this and Jimmy Somerville\u2019s You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real) came on. I was momentarily extremely impressed, but turned out it was an ad on SSN. But if anyone knows Dhr Noppert, please do pass on my suggestion.       12.54pm    Little newsline on a player not in England squad, who should be in the England squad.   To be clear, that\u2019s not a criticism of Gareth Southgate \u2013 Sancho hasn\u2019t done anything like enough to demand inclusion. But his ability is such that he should\u2019ve made himself an automatic choice and this seems like a sound move from for him \u2013 he has all the skills already, so doesn\u2019t need games, he needs to get stronger and faster.      12.48pm    Tom Farrell\u2019s Vase ruse is going down well! Here\u2019s Gerry Carr: \u201cChina, India and eh, Ireland finally find a competition suited to their lack of talents. The World Cup has finally stumbled on the ideal format and numbers. The Vase gives the opportunity to retain it and \u2018grow the game\u2019. Would also make the 3/4/5 spot in qualifying worth fight for. Win. Win. Win.\u201d The phrase \u201cgrow the game\u201d always makes me think of a rapper in a plant pot.   Updated at 12.48pm GMT    12.45pm    Back to USA, I think they\u2019ve the germ of a really useful side. I think Brendon Aaronson is going to be a very good player, Gio Reyna will improve, likewise Tyler Adams. They need to find a reliable scorer, but I\u2019m optimistic they\u2019ll be decent in their home competition, four years from now.      12.42pm    It\u2019s Matt Jarvis! He thins are going to win.      12.41pm    Can you tell who it is yet?      12.39pm    I was in the away end that night, and I\u2019d not have a clue.      12.39pm    A clue: one cap, v Ghana in 2011\u2026     12.38pm    Competition time: Sky Sports News are interviewing a \u201cformer England winger\u201d. Can you guess who?      12.36pm    Here are Aaron Timms\u2019 thoughts on USA\u2019s elimination.      12.30pm    \u201cJust seen the comments today suggesting a Vase tournament as a second tier World football competition,\u201d emails David McMahon. \u201cSurely it should be Saucer rather than Vase: cup and saucer goes together so much better doesn\u2019t it? (or is that too parochial a view?)\u201d I\u2019m not sure \u2013 I get the rationale, but it might be a bit similar to Plate, which is very rugby union.      12.23pm    \u201cA Fifa Vase/Shield/Trophy/Plate would be amazing in the \u2018North\u2019 of England across Brum, Manchester and Liverpool, Newcastle,\u201d reckons Hugh Molloy. \u201cEight groups of four with two stadia in each location hosting two groups each. Easy peasy. Also, if the English FA wanted to really stick two fingers up to Fifa and receive endless goodwill, they would just do it off the books and call them \u2018friendlies\u2019 and just put in an under-21 team themselves as hosts. Zero infrastructure to be built, all four home nations there, uber-cheap tickets, a festival of football. It would be a blast.\u201d You had me until the insertion of the u21 sides, which gives us a problem of sporting integrity. I get the logic, though \u2013 I\u2019m not sure there\u2019d be sufficient local appetite without them \u2013 so think we need to let countries participating host, as per the original plan.     12.17pm    Oh Ars\u00e9ne. I wish I was more surprised by this than I am, but it\u2019s been on the cards for a while, sadly.   The link to the full chat is here.     12.10pm    My colleague, Jason Rodrigues, emails with news of a classic match report: \u201cSenegal made an impressive World Cup debut at Korea/Japan in 2002, famously beating defending champions France in a group match before narrowly losing to Turkey in the quarter finals, conceding an extra-time golden-goal.Kevin Mitchell for the Observer reported from the Osaka Nagai Stadium: \u2018Turkey soaked up what Senegal had to offer, which was sporadically spectacular through the quick feet of El Hadji Diouf...when the Turks struck, though, it was sudden and clinical, four minutes into golden-goal extra time.\u2019\u201cEl Hadji Diouf, bound for Liverpool, said: \u201cWe gave it everything we had, but that\u2019s what God wanted. Turkey deserved it but the luck was with them. We leave with our heads high. We had nothing to lose and we are going to try to keep this team together, to keep the same mentality.\u201d\u2019\u201d The full report is here:   Goodness me, Ilhan Mansiz is a name I\u2019ve not heard in a minute.      12.07pm    More generally, I can\u2019t say I\u2019m loving a lot of the telly so far. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s nostalgia bias and also football overkill, but the commentators we have now don\u2019t, to me at least, seem close to Barry Davies, John Motson and Brian Moore. I\u2019m glad we\u2019re getting some Clive Tyldesley, though \u2013 I\u2019ve not a clue why he\u2019s been overtaken by various others \u2013 but wish we had some better co-commentary than we\u2019re getting.      12.04pm    She\u2019s not mentioned in the piece, but hold tight Pien Meulensteen who I think is doing a great job.      11.56am         11.50am    \u201cTried this with Rob Smyth earlier in the week, but as it was the dying moments of Croatia v Belgium, probably wasn\u2019t the right time,\u201d begins Tom Farrell, who\u2019s about to pitch us the Fifa Vase. \u201cHere\u2019s the proposal: as an alternative to World Cup expansion, how about a second tournament for the 32 teams who filled the next 32 places in qualification - the Fifa Vase! Today there are 211 Fifa members. About eight of them have a realistic chance of winning a tournament. The Vase would give the players and fans of solid mid-tier football nations the chance to compete in a meaningful, global competition that they can actually dream of winning. There\u2019s loads of other advantages: if could be hosted on a smaller scale, which would again mean that countries who could never host a tournament otherwise could get involved. And it would help grow the game without watering-down the actual World Cup. The winners would qualify for the next World Cup of course. Easy! Time for a Guardian campaign....\u201d In a sense, the rationale isn\u2019t dissimilar to that of the Nations League, which is mainly about making friendlies less unwatchable but also gives countries unused to challenging for trophies the sense of movement. I guess I can\u2019t see anything wrong with the plan, though it might be a logistical struggle given potential hosts and varying season timetables. However, the Manchester Guardian campaign space has already been seized by my plan for a London World Cup,      11.43am    I can\u2019t always say the same about his teams, but Louis van Gaal is absolute box office. I\u2019d not bet on it, but at the same time, I\u2019d not be at all surprised if they found a way by Argentina, by smothering midfield and snaffling a goal.       11.36am    Southgate also has a choice to make at right-back and in midfield. I\u2019d be surprised if Kyle Walker didn\u2019t keep his place, not just because of today, but because if England progress, they could well face France next and he\u2019s clearly the best available option to mark Mbapp\u00e9. We can safely assume Declan Rice and Jude Bellingham will start, but alongside \u2013 or in front \u2013 of them will be someone else. Mason Mount is another Southgate favourite and with good reason. But I\u2019d be very tempted to insert Kalvin Phillips, because if he makes up the trio England should be able to out-physical anyone, and also keep the ball and create.  Updated at 11.38am GMT    11.29am    Now that you ask, I\u2019d probably have gone with Foden on the right, ultimately because I think he\u2019s just a little bit better, and a little more of a goal-threat. But it\u2019s a great problem to have and, assuming it is Saka, it makes me wonder if it\u2019ll be Sterling not Rashford on the left, for that same reason of loyalty. This too would be understandable \u2013 and Rashford is, it shouldn\u2019t be forgotten, a brilliant sub \u2013 he\u2019s been great off the bench for Man United, over a fair period, and having to handle his pace and aggression after 60 minutes chasing about does not sound a lot of fun.      11.25am    Sky are reporting that Bukayo Saka is expected to start for England tonight, which I guess that\u2019s unsurprising because he\u2019s brilliant. But it also reflects a manager who is loyal, perhaps to a fault, when it comes to players who\u2019ve done well for him, and I also wonder if he thinks Saka\u2019s ability to defend is worth something.      11.21am    In similar vein and prepared in honour of Ghana v Uruguay, here\u2019s a playlist of absolute, stone-cold, steaming hot, complete and utter Ghanaian bangers:       11.17am    And this!      11.17am    Ah, that didn\u2019t work, so let\u2019s try this:      11.15am    I have a teenage niece \u2013 hi Amelia! \u2013 which I don\u2019t mention for your information, but to explain to the perplexed why I\u2019m aware of TikTok gold like this.   Updated at 12.35pm GMT    11.10am    Also going on, a prime cut of Bazball:      11.06am    Will mentioned Lisandro Mart\u00ednez below, so let me say this: I have not a scooby why Lionel Scaloni, or anyone else, would pick Otamendi or Romero ahead of him. I think the latter could develop into a very serious operator \u2013 and he\u2019s pretty good now \u2013 but he won\u2019t be at Mart\u00ednez\u2019s level till he has Mart\u00ednez\u2019s discipline, I\u2019d say. I guess I also thought Mart\u00ednez was a strange exclusion given he came in and played well in the Mexico clean sheet; I wonder if he\u2019ll keep his place now, after last night\u2019s terrific last-ditch challenge.      11.02am    Morning all! What a day this is going to be! Football always wins, doesn\u2019t it?      11.00am    Time for a cup of tea, is it? Ah, go on then. Daniel Harris will take the reins now. He knows his live blogs, does Daniel. You\u2019re in good hands.     10.49am    Conducting a technical briefing on the group stage, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has suggested that it may well be coming home. \u201cEngland has learned a lot, been in the last four. England looks to be a team that is now at the peak to deliver. It has learned and is still a young team.\u201d      10.18am    It wasn\u2019t a bad World Cup campaign for the USA, even if they\u2019ll be disappointed not to have gone further. Here\u2019s the post-mortem on their last-16 exit.     Updated at 10.20am GMT    10.14am    Jack Torcello has something to add. \u201cFrom pretenders to contenders \u2013 as Klinsmann said, a lot of the American players are playing this season for Champions League teams (Chelsea, Juventus) whereas not so in the past!\u201d     10.05am    We have our first bit of email correspondence, in the form of a short poem from Kurt Perleberg. \u201cIn 2022 the USA were World Cup pretenders. In 2026 the USA will be World Cup contenders.\u201d Thought-provoking.     10.02am    Argentina have also been celebrating after beating Australia 2-1. Lisandro Mart\u00ednez, who came on as a second-half substitute for the Albiceleste, has tweeted: \u201cProud of this group. What passion, united as always we keep moving forward!\u201d      9.56am    Having secured a spot in the quarter-finals, Van Gaal has also been talking up the Netherlands\u2019 hopes of winning the tournament. \u201cI think we have big chances here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe still have three matches to go. I\u2019ve been talking about this for a year. We can become world champions \u2013 not that we will \u2013 but we can. I am talking about team bonding, how we can build the strongest possible team and I derive pleasure from the group of players and, of course, performances and results.\u201d      9.54am    Seasoned Louis van Gaal watchers will have enjoyed his reaction to the Netherlands\u2019 3-1 win against the USA yesterday. Not only did he give Denzel Dumfries, scorer of his side\u2019s third goal, \u201ca big fat kiss\u201d in his post-match press conference, he also danced through the team\u2019s hotel lobby with all the rhythm of an eccentric uncle in the last hour of a wedding.      9.41am    Looking for a bit more background on Senegal, before they take on England later on? Here\u2019s Ed Aarons\u2019 scouting report.      9.36am    In more unwelcome news, researchers have warned that mass gatherings in pubs and at home as people follow England\u2019s progress in Qatar could lead to a rise in Covid infections. They have pointed to a similar effect during Euro 2020, with Professor Christophe Fraser, an epidemiologist at Oxford University, saying: \u201cIt was a much bigger event in terms of mixing people and spreading the virus than the celebrations we had at Christmas that year. That suggests that a key factor in influencing infection rates this year will be England\u2019s performance during the World Cup.\u201d      9.21am    Jesus has posted a message of his own, addressing his younger self. It reads: \u201cIf there was a timeline and I could see you and tell you something, I would say \u2018Gabriel, you are a winner\u2019. Thank you to everyone who sent messages of support and affection.\u201d      9.08am    According to SporTV in Brazil, Gabriel Jesus could be facing three months on the sidelines with the knee injury which has brought his World Cup campaign to a premature end. Unsurprisingly, Arsenal fans have their heads in their hands.      9.00am   Beyond the football  Even as we delve deeper into the knockout stages, what\u2019s going on off the field at this World Cup is, in many ways, much more pressing. Here\u2019s the latest.          8.41am    In Deptford, south-east London, there\u2019s a generational divide in the local Senegalese community over who to support. \u201cSenegal represents home and I think they\u2019ll win,\u201d says Ndene Ndiaye. \u201cBut my children were born here and they\u2019re English supporters all the way.\u201d      8.31am   Preamble  Welcome to another day of Qatar 2022, the tournament which continues to plumb new depths. The first game today is, of course, France against Poland, aka the valiant-Napoleonic-cavalry-charge derby. Who will win the battle of the strikers, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 or Robert Lewandowski? There\u2019s another game on, too, possibly \u2013 let us find our notes, they must be here somewhere \u2013 ah yes, England against Senegal. Will it come home? Won\u2019t it? The age-old question. And are England even any good? Here\u2019s Jonathan Wilson with the answer.   "

Thanks for your company and emails \u2013 goodnight.     Updated at 10.08pm GMT    9.30pm    The post-match thoughts of Tim Weah, who scored a delightful opening goal  [On the goal] Christian gave me a beautiful ball and it was up to me to finish it. [On a game of two halves] It felt like in the first half we had a lot of energy, a lot of momentum ... and then coming into the second-half we dialled down and Wales turned it up a notch. They started pressing us, they had most of the ball and I think at the end that\u2019s what really hurt us.  [On what changes are needed before the England game] In a World Cup, the most important thing is that we didn\u2019t lose. We need to continue to do what we do best and keep working.         9.25pm    \u201cWith the USA\u2019s wonderful first half wiped out, this has to be considered a victory for Wales,\u201d says Mary Waltz. \u201cThe USA advanced in 2014 with a W1 D1 L1 record but they wilted under the Wales pressure. Disappointing.\u201d It\u2019s stupid to look too far ahead, so that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m going to do. If England win all three games, and both Wales and the USA beat Iran, one of them will go through with four points. Also, if England beat the US on Friday, chances are they will rest players in their final match against Wales. Then again, the USA have never lost to England at a World Cup.     9.20pm    I\u2019ve just realised that Gio Reyna didn\u2019t get on the field. Unless he was injured, that\u2019s pretty hard to fathom.     9.18pm    Gregg Berhalter\u2019s verdict  I think we lost a little bit of power [in the second half], but in the same sense Wales stepped up the pressure and we had some good counter-attacking opportunities but I thought the guys dealt with it well. We kept going until the end, we left everything out there.      9.18pm    \u201cThe view from the USA on Fox,\u201d begins Eric Garcia. \u201cLandon Donovan, Alexi Lalas and Clint Dempsey all disappointed and feel like this was a win thrown away.\u201d They were so good in the first half. They did sit on their lead a bit too much after the break, though part of that was down to Wales\u2019 improvement.     9.16pm    And here\u2019s Gareth Bale  Not a good first half \u2013 they played really well and we were poor. But it was a great talk from the gaffer at half-time, we changed a few things \u2013 nothing I wanna share too much \u2013 and came out battling. We looked like we were gonna win the game from the second half. It\u2019s a great point, we showed character\u2026 and we go again. Yeah, I was always gonna take the penalty. No doubts in my head. I feel like I have to step up, and I\u2019m happy to do so. It\u2019s incredible to have a World Cup goal but I\u2019d rather have the three points. Our second-half performance was fantastic so we\u2019ll take a lot of confidence. I felt a little bit tired towards the end \u2013 I can\u2019t believe there were nine minutes added on \u2013 but we have to dig deep for our country. We always do.       9.13pm    Next up in Group B Wales play Iran on Friday (10am GMT), then England meet the USA later in the day (7pm GMT, 2pm EST).     9.09pm    Rob Page\u2019s verdict  It\u2019s important not to lose the first game. It was similar to the Switzerland game in the Euros \u2013 we showed character and determination to come back and get a point. [On the half-time change] It was nothing against Daniel James, it just suited the game to have Kieffer [Moore] on. We couldn\u2019t play through their press so we tried to play over it. \u201cIt\u2019s all about Bale-o, rightly so. He\u2019s never let us down. We had some players who cramped up in the last few minutes \u2013 they haven\u2019t played much football this season - so the medical team have got some work to do to get us ready for Friday. To see the Red Wall, it\u2019s been incredible.\u201d    Updated at 9.17pm GMT    9.03pm         9.02pm   Full time: USA 1-1 Wales  Peep peep! A game of two distinct 45-minutes segments, and an honourable draw. The USA were too dynamic for Wales in the first half and scored a lovely goal through Timothy Weah. Wales\u2019 second-half performance was much better, and they were rewarded when Gareth Bale \u2013 who had barely had a kick \u2013 won and converted a penalty in 82nd minute. I say \u2018converted\u2019: he walloped it in.   Updated at 9.02pm GMT    9.01pm    90+10 min Acosta is booked for a very cynical foul on Bale. Turner had come miles out of his area to head a long ball back towards the halfway line. It fell to Bale, who was lining up a shot from 55 yards when Acosta showed him over.     8.59pm    90+8 min Wales play on even though Pulisic is down. Thomas\u2019s cross is controlled well by Moore, who tries to rumble through three defenders and almost manages it. Wales come again but Bale is tackled superbly on the edge of the D by Adams.     8.57pm    90+7 min Yedlin\u2019s deep cross is punched away a little nervously, but ultimately safely by Hennessey.     8.56pm    90+5 min Ampadu is down again. I think it\u2019s cramp rather than anything more serioues, but he is going to be replaced by Joe Morrell. Ampadu had a fine game and has arguably been Wales\u2019 best player, though not their chief headline-grabber.  Updated at 8.56pm GMT    8.55pm    90+4 min Roberts\u2019 dangerous cross is headed away well by Zimmerman, this time forcing his way legitimately in front of Bale.     8.54pm         8.53pm    90+3 min: Wales substitution Ampadu wins a thrilling block tackle with Zimmerman, but injures himself in the process. While he is beating treated, Sorba Thomas replaces the weary Harry Wilson.     8.51pm    90+1 min There will be, gulp, nine minutes of added time.     8.50pm    89 min Johnson almost wins it for Wales! He collected a loose ball in the inside-right channel, surged into the area and struck a shot straight at Turner from a tight angle. He didn\u2019t really have any support \u2013 Bale was wheezing towards the area \u2013 so it was fair enough to go for goal.     8.48pm    88 min Ah, mea culpa: apparently it was Walker Zimmerman who fouled Bale, not Tim Ream. A shocking bit of manbunism from me, for which I apologise.     8.47pm    88 min Robinson is lucky not to be booked for a cynical foul on Johnson.     8.47pm    87 min Some people claim Gareth Bale is a big-game player, and frankly that is absolute nonsense: he is and always has been a huge-game player.      8.46pm    86 min Looks like that email about the Cubs just before half-time wasn\u2019t too far off the mark. Wales have been very good in the second half, but the USA will wonder if they were a bit too content to sit on their 1-0 lead. You do that at your peril when Gareth Bale\u2019s scriptwriter is in the mood.     8.45pm    84 min \u201cFelt like I didn\u2019t breathe for a long time there!\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cI love Bale so much. He has a Stokes-esque ability to make things happen. Unbelievable force of will.\u201d     8.44pm    83 min I\u2019m not sure Ream Zimmerman did get the ball, on reflection. Either way it was a foul, and a pretty stupid one, because he went through Bale.  Updated at 9.11pm GMT    8.43pm    He smashed it in! Turner went the right way, to his left, but Bale bulleted it into the corner. He has done bugger all tonight, the square root of bugger all, and it matters not one jot. This is spine-tingling stuff!  Updated at 8.43pm GMT    8.42pm   GOAL! USA 1-1 Wales (Bale 82 pen)  Take that peg off the nose, inhale the sweet fragrance: Gareth Bale has scored Wales\u2019 first World Cup goal in 64 years!    Updated at 8.55pm GMT    8.41pm   PENALTY TO WALES!  80 min Ramsey\u2019s cutback from the byline bobbles towards Bale, back to goal in the area. Ream Zimmerman goes straight through him and the referee gives a penalty! Ream Zimmerman did get the ball, but he took an absurd shortcut through the back of Bale to get there. It\u2019s a clear penalty.   Updated at 9.11pm GMT    8.41pm    80 min \u201cBale\u2019s having a peg-on-the-nose stinker tonight,\u201d says Tony Hughes. How many times have I told you about the word yet.   Updated at 8.52pm GMT    8.39pm    79 min: Wales substitution Weah goes down and the referee stops play. Wales aren\u2019t happy, and Wilson gives him a mouthful. The break in play allows Brennan Johnson to come on in place of Neco Williams; that should mean a switch to 4-3-3.     8.37pm    77 min Pulisic\u2019s very deep corner is headed wide by the off balance Aaronson. A half chance at best.     8.37pm    77 min Wales had a really good spell at the start of the second half, but the USA seem to have weathered the storm. I\u2019m surprised we haven\u2019t seen Brennan Johnson yet.     8.36pm    76 min Wright gets involved straight away, flicking a header wide from about 15 yards. It wasn\u2019t much of a chance \u2013 he was running away from goal when he met Weah\u2019s cross.     8.35pm    75 min \u201cHiya Rob,\u201d writes Bethan McKernan. \u201cI\u2019m the Jerusalem correspondent for the paper and I\u2019m watching at the British consulate here \u2014 a room full of Americans and a few very supportive English people. They\u2019ve decorated with Welsh flags. Atmosphere completely different this half. I am bursting with pride! Great job on the blog, da iawn!\u201d Diolch yn fawr iawn! (I really hope I haven\u2019t cocked that up.)  Updated at 8.36pm GMT    8.35pm    74 min: Triple substitution for the USA Haji Wright, Kellyn Acosta and DeAndre Yedlin replaces Dest, Musah and Sargent. Musah, the teenager who made history tonight as the USMNT\u2019s youngest player at a World Cup, has had a fine game in midfield.     8.34pm    73 min Rodon plays a loose pass straight to Musah. He runs 40 yards and finds Pulisic on the left of the area. He stands up an excellent cross towards the penalty spot, where Aaronson and Weah (I think) get in each other\u2019s way.     8.32pm    71 min Now Pulisic is down, but he seems okay. The US are about to make a triple substitution.     8.31pm    70 min Wilson loses the ball to Pulisic near the byline. Ben Davies gets him out of trouble, blocking Pulisic\u2019s subsequent cross.     8.29pm    69 min Williams is still receiving treatment. It didn\u2019t look great, although he\u2019s getting to his feet as I type.     8.28pm    67 min Weah, the goalscorer, runs at Williams to win a corner. Williams was horribly off balance when he lunged to tackle Weah, and he\u2019s in a lot of pain.      8.27pm    66 min: USA substitution Brenden Aaronson replaces Weston McKennie.     8.26pm    65 min: Chance for Moore! Wilson curls the resulting corner to the near post, where Moore gets away from Turner but flicks a header over from four yards! That was an excellent chance; he just couldn\u2019t quite get over the ball.   Updated at 8.36pm GMT    8.25pm    64 min: Good save from Turner! That\u2019s the closest Wales have come to scoring. Wilson\u2019s inswinging free-kick was headed up in the air, which led to an impromptu game of head tennis. Eventually Davies\u2019s diving header was tipped over by Turner, a dramatic but relatively comfortable save above his head.  Updated at 8.29pm GMT    8.23pm    62 min Weah\u2019s long cross from the right almost breaks for Pulisic at the far post. The sliding Mepham gets the slighest touch on the ball, which then hits Pulisic and goes behind for a goalkick. It was right on the edge of the area, so without that touch the USA might have had a penalty; Mepham would certainly have been given a second yellow card. I\u2019d like to see it again to be sure, but I\u2019m pretty sure it was a fair tackle from Mepham.  Updated at 8.24pm GMT    8.20pm    59 min Wales are pinning the USA back now. Rodon sparks another attack with a lovely sliding tackle on Sargent. Eventually Roberts\u2019 curling cross is slightly too heavy for Bale beyond the far post.     8.19pm    58 min \u201cI rarely watch football,\u201d says Filip from Macedonia, \u201cbut Wales clearly need someone who can pass and be the designated playmaker. And they also happen to have Joe Allen on the bench.\u201d He\u2019s not fully fit \u2013 he\u2019s a certain starter when he is.     8.18pm    57 min Dest concedes what looks like a corner, but the referee gives a throw-in. Then Williams\u2019 dangerous cross is headed away from Bale at the near post. Wales are right in this game now.     8.15pm    54 min Ben Davies plays a good pass through the lines to release Wilson. He finds Williams, who twists past Dest on the edge of the area. McKennie comes across to clear, but this is much better from Wales.     8.12pm    52 min Wales are playing with greater intensity and aggression in the second half, presumably after an almighty roasting in the dressing-room from Michael Sheen.   Updated at 8.17pm GMT    8.11pm    51 min Bale dribbles past Ream, who wrestles him to the ground and takes the yellow card.      8.11pm    50 min Wilson\u2019s corner is dropped by Turner, who recovers to punch the loose ball clear. The referee gave a foul against Turner, though I\u2019m not sure there was one.     8.08pm    47 min \u201cGreetings from Chicago,\u201d says Matt Burtz. \u201cThe point about Pulisic is well taken, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily a slight on him if he can\u2019t do similar things in a Chelsea squad packed with international talents.  \u201cI\u2019m not saying he should have turned Chelsea down, but sometimes I wonder if he would have been better off going to say, Aston Villa, where he would likely be guaranteed 90 minutes every week instead of having to compete for playing time, which probably compels him to try too hard, which leads to mistakes and bad decisions, which leads to benching. Lather, rinse, repeat.\u201d  Updated at 8.11pm GMT    8.07pm    46 min Musah wins an early corner down the left. Pulisic\u2019s inswinger is headed away by Roberts. Actually, as good as Pulisic has been in open play, his set-pieces have been poor.     8.06pm    46 min Peep peep!     8.05pm    A half-time change for Wales Kieffer Moore replaces Dan James up front.     8.04pm    \u201cThe Cubs are pre-2005 Ashes England,\u201d says Joseph Harvey. \u201cHope that clears things up.\u201d No further questions your honour.     7.59pm    \u201cAm in a packed bar in NYC,\u201d writes Rachel Clifton. \u201cAmazing turnout for a Monday afternoon (albeit thanksgiving week). Ref seems a touch card-happy tho... feel like a red card in the second half seems likely.\u201d I think his decisions have been fine (Bale\u2019s booking aside), but he has been on the officious side.     7.56pm    Bigotry latest    Updated at 8.00pm GMT    7.54pm    \u201cPulisic plays well when he is the best player on the field, as when the opponent is outmatched in CONCACAF or here,\u201d says Paul Pooley. \u201cFar less productive for club and country when the quality of opponent improves. Sure, not a novel concept, but being direct is a feature that is also a limit in his case.\u201d     7.52pm    Depressing half-time reading    Updated at 7.56pm GMT    7.51pm   Half time: USA 1-0 Wales  After a 64-year wait, that was a 45 minutes to forget for Wales. They were overrun by a young, aggressive US side, who lead deservedly through a terrific goal from Timothy Weah. It was made by Christian Pulisic, who has been the best player on the pitch. Wales defended pretty well, the goal aside, but they were really disappointing in possession. Gareth Bale\u2019s only notable contribution was to receive a slightly unfortunate yellow card.   Updated at 7.52pm GMT    7.49pm    45+2 min Mepham, who might have been booked earlier, gets a yellow card this time for pulling back Pulisic. Wales can\u2019t handle him.     7.47pm    45+1 min Four added minutes.     7.47pm    45+1 min \u201cGood that we\u2019re up,\u201d says Tom Soule. \u201cDeserved. But I\u2019m bracing myself for the all-but-inevitable second-half letdown by the USMNT. Can\u2019t help it; it\u2019s the Cubs fan in me.\u201d I haven\u2019t a clue what this means, but I suspect about 70 per cent of you will understand.      7.47pm    45 min Wales win their first corner. The increasingly officious referee tells Ramsey off for something or other before it is taken. A dodgy haircut? Eventually Wilson curls it deep, it skims off the head of Davies and goes well wide.      7.45pm    43 min Wales are now having a lot more of the ball. Human nature is so weird.     7.44pm    42 min Davies drives a crossfield pass towards Bale that is calmly headed away by Ream. He\u2019s winning the battle of the four-letter surnames.     7.43pm    41 min Pulisic has been a big disappointment for Chelsea in the last two years, but he\u2019s been the best player on the pitch tonight: skilful, direct and full of menace.     7.42pm    40 min Bale is booked for what looked like a decent sliding tackle on Musah. See, he should have worn the armband after all, then he wouldn\u2019t have dared to make that tackle.   Updated at 7.55pm GMT    7.41pm    38 min The USA are a younger, more dynamic side, and at the moment it is showing.  Updated at 7.41pm GMT    7.39pm    Christian Pulisic made the goal with a superb run from the halfway line. From the moment he surged past Rodon, who committed himself unnecessarily, Wales were in trouble. Pulisic then swerved past Mepham (I think) and played a perfect through ball towards Weah. He made a brilliant angled run, away from Williams, and flicked an accomplished first-time finish past Hennessey. That really is a fine goal: the electricity of the runs from both Pulisic and Weah, and the cool precision of the finish.  Updated at 7.58pm GMT    7.37pm   GOAL! USA 1-0 Wales (Weah 36)  Timothy Weah, the son of the legendary George, gives the US a deserved lead with a superb goal!     Updated at 7.50pm GMT    7.35pm    34 min Mephan shoves Pulisic over but escapes a yellow card, which doesn\u2019t impress the US players much. Could have gone either way; it wasn\u2019t as bad as the fouls by Dest and McKennie.     7.34pm    33 min \u201cI was expecting the young US squad to get frustrated but so far they have been fairly disciplined,\u201d says Mary Waltz. \u201cWales actually looks a little rattled by the US pressure. But we need a goal badly.\u201d Don\u2019t we all.     7.33pm    31 min Ampadu is having a good game for Wales, diligently putting our fires in front of the defence, though he already looks shattered. Wales have been decent defensively. The problem is that \u2013 stop me if you think I\u2019ve already said this about 40 times \u2013 they cannot keep the ball.  Updated at 7.33pm GMT    7.32pm    30 min \u201cI\u2019m currently on a Teams call for a school governor resources committee,\u201d writes Rich W. \u201cKeeping one eye on the spreadsheets whilst following the game. Not easy - running the risk of some angry fellow parents should the budget go south...\u201d Bom bom bom\u2026   Updated at 7.33pm GMT    7.30pm    29 min Dest, a real go-getter of a footballer, marches to within 25 yards of goal but then smashes a shot into orbit.     7.28pm    27 min Against that, the only save Wayne Hennessey has had to make was from his teammate Joe Rodon.     7.28pm    26 min The US have been very good without the ball, harassing Wales into making mistakes. It\u2019s a pretty one-sided 0-0, at least in terms of possession percentage: USA 68-32 Wales.   Updated at 7.52pm GMT    7.25pm    24 min \u201cAll very well you lot going on about Wales this and USA that,\u201d says Ian Copestake, \u201cbut in the words of my mum, \u2018Where has Emmerdale gone?\u2019\u201d     7.25pm    23 min Pulisic stabs a dangerous pass towards Robinson on the left side of the area. His driven cross takes a deflection and is belted clear by Ampadu.     7.23pm    22 min Wales have their first extended spell of possession. Most of it was in their own half, but it beats chasing leather. They\u2019re not playing well, but at least they have limited to the US to that double chance early on,     7.22pm    21 min \u201cEvening Rob,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cThere\u2019s so much that\u2019s wrong with this World Cup, it\u2019s something of a relief when the games are actually going on. Scotland of course took the ultimate moral high ground by refusing to qualify, which certainly beats going out in the group stage to Qatar or Saudi Arabia, as would likely have happened had they made it through. Good luck to Wales, who have Dundee United\u2019s Dylan Levitt in their squad. Make of that what you will, Wales fans.\u201d     7.21pm    19 min Tim Weah, the son of George, is causing Wales plenty of problems down the USA right. He\u2019s quick, direct and has a good relationship with Sergino Dest, who keeps pinging balls in behind Neco Williams.     7.19pm    17 min Wales are starting to settle down after a slightly nervous start. They still aren\u2019t keeping the ball well enough, though, and Gareth Bale has been peripheral. He often is, either side of the screamers.   Updated at 7.34pm GMT    7.16pm    14 min Ampadu has Wales\u2019 first effort at goal, half-volleying over the bar from 25 yards.     7.14pm    13 min Now Weston McKennie is booked for a scissor tackle on Neco Williams. The US did promise they\u2019d be aggressive.  Updated at 7.14pm GMT    7.13pm    11 min Sergino Dest is booked for clattering Neco Williams, a needless and overzealous challenge on the halfway line.     7.12pm    10 min: Double chance for the USA! First Weah ran onto a long pass from Dest and hooked a cross that was headed instinctively towards his own goal by Rodon. The ball hit Hennessey, who had almost no reaction time and knew sweet bugger all about it, and rebounded to safety. Briefly. The US regained possession, and seconds later Sargent flicked a close-range header just wide of the near post. It may even have hit the outside of the post.  Updated at 7.15pm GMT    7.10pm    8 min \u201cI am a proud American,\u201d writes Edward Sieferman, \u201cbut... if your hairs don\u2019t stand on end after hearing the Welsh national anthem, you must be DEAD!\u201d Not the ideal way for some of our readers to discover they have shuffled off this mortal coil, but it\u2019s a valid point.     7.08pm    7 min Lots of USA possession in the early minutes, although most of it has been in the middle third. Wales haven\u2019t been able to keep the ball.   Updated at 7.26pm GMT    7.06pm    6 min Sod the game, just watch this.      7.06pm    5 min Now Pulisic breaks down the left to win the first corner of the game. His routine inswinger is headed away by Mepham.     7.04pm    3 min It\u2019s been a fast start from the US, as promised. Pulisic is fouled by Rodon 30 yards from goal, in the inside-right channel, and takes the free-kick himself. It\u2019s a poor one and Wales clear.     7.03pm    2 min \u201cGreetings from the bay area,\u201d writes Mary Waltz. \u201cThe vibe coming from the ESPN pundits the last few days is very pessimistic. \u2018Too young, too inexperienced\u2019 to be playing an aggressive attacking game. They suggest they should \u2018know who they are\u2019 and sit back and counter as US teams did in the past. Maybe true. But at least I would like to see them try. And the Three Lions looked scary.\u201d     7.02pm    1 min Peeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep peeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep! The USA, kicking from left to right as I watch, get the game under way.      7.01pm    The Wales anthem was predictably wonderful. I\u2019ll post a video as soon as I can, because there are no words that could adequately describe it.     6.59pm    \u201cGreetings from Detroit,\u201d writes Jeff Lily. \u201cAs I get older, I\u2019m counting my years by fours, since my favorite sporting events are the international ones. I mark my life by which tourney in which country with which international group of friends, beginning with being in Germany in \u201886 with my extended family.  \u201cIt\u2019s a great time, but it\u2019s sad that FIFA has firmly landed on the side of evil. It is a challenge to separate the games from their background. Best wishes to the Wales supporters who had their hats confiscated. Such BS and I hope it leads to strong pushback.  \u201cTime to see what this USA squad can do.\u201d      6.54pm    The players walk out of the tunnel, all looking deadly serious. After 64/8 years, Wales/the USA are about to play in a World Cup again. This is huge.    Updated at 7.08pm GMT    6.52pm    Yunus Musah, who graduated from Arsenal\u2019s Hale End academy, made 30 international appearances for England at various age levels and captained their U15, U16 and U17 teams, becomes the youngest player ever to start a World Cup match for the United States.  The 19-year-old is not a well-known name stateside but that could change in this tournament. His ability to dribble out of pressure, carry the ball into the final third and create attacking chances for his teammates could prove critically important \u2013 especially given the Americans\u2019 gnawing lack of a reliable goal-scoring central striker.

It\u2019ll be emotional.   Updated at 6.48pm GMT    6.44pm    \u201cHello from California,\u201d writes Ryan Casey. \u201cI have to say anecdotally that this is the most buzz I\u2019ve heard around a USA opening game in my lifetimes. I\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised as to how non-footy/soccer/let\u2019s not go there following fans actually know that our opponent is in fact Wales, and many are even familiar with Gareth Bale. Also your cheeky omission of Qatar as a possible last 16 opponent in the preamble is appreciated.\u201d You say \u2018cheeky\u2019, I say \u2018did you watch the game yesterday?\u2019     6.43pm         6.42pm         6.42pm         6.38pm     The Football Association of Wales is investigating the circumstances around female supporters having rainbow-coloured bucket hats confiscated upon entry to their Group B opener against the USA. Some Wales fans reported being confronted by security for bringing the hats into the Ahmad bin Ali stadium and others have had them confiscated. The Rainbow Wall, a Welsh LGBTQ+ fans\u2019 group, said on Twitter: \u201cNot the men, just women. @FIFAcom ARE YOU SERIOUS!!\u201d      6.34pm         6.30pm    1958 and all that Wales have qualified for the World Cup for the first time since 1958, when the tournament was held in Sweden. Back then, they surprised a few people by reaching the quarter-finals. But their opponents in the last eight were Brazil, eventual winners of the trophy, who beat them 1-0, thanks to a goal by a 17-year-old called Pel\u00e9. The Guardian match report from Gothenburg noted that Wales began by playing \u201cfine football\u201d and that they \u201cswung the ball about\u201d and caused the Brazil defence some \u201canxious moments\u201d. In the second half, Brazil asserted themselves and with the Wales goal under threat, Pel\u00e9 scored late on to win the game. Things may have turned out differently for Wales had their free-scoring centre-forward John Charles, known as the \u201cGentle Giant,\u201d not been injured in their previous match.      6.28pm   Report: female Wales supporters having rainbow hats confiscated  It would be quite the understatement to say that this is not good. What the actual eff is happening here?   Updated at 6.34pm GMT    6.26pm    A bit more pre-match reading      6.25pm    \u201cWhy this World Cup, rob?\u201d writes Matt Dony. \u201cThis should be an absolute lifetime sporting highlight. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m excited. But it\u2019s muted. It\u2019s not just \u2018Qatar\u2019, it\u2019s not just the wintery weather outside, it\u2019s not just the interminable (but necessary and important) discussions around oppression and rights, it\u2019s not just the working conditions (David Squires\u2019 magnificent cartoons over the last few weeks have been so moving). It\u2019s a combination of everything. \u201cAnd yet, it\u2019s Wales. In a World Chuffing Cup. With winnable games. I don\u2019t want to bring negative energy, because now this is about the football. There is space for coverage of the important stuff, and there is space for coverage of the football, and they don\u2019t have to cancel each other out or indicate support for anything in particular. But separating them completely in the mind is taking a fair bit of mental origami. Am I a hypocrite if I enjoy watching Wales? I don\u2019t honestly know. And believe me, I\u2019ve been giving it some thought recently. Anyway. Here we are. I\u2019ve got that out my system. Any further emails I send you tonight will be as facile, silly and 90\u2019s-music-referencing as ever. (Sigh)\u201d Fair to say you\u2019re not the only one who feels this way. To be honest, I\u2019ve thought myself out of contention on this one and I don\u2019t even have an attachment to any of the teams in the tournament.   Updated at 6.42pm GMT    6.25pm    Meet Gareth, a 33-year-old veteran who loves his country and golf      6.24pm    The thoughts of Wales manager Rob Page  It was a really, really hard decision [to pick Wayne Hennessey ahead of Danny Ward] \u2013 it gave me a few sleepless nights. Wayne\u2019s got the shirt at the moment and his performance against Ukraine to get us here was probably the best I\u2019ve seen from a goalkeeper in a Welsh jersey. Wardy understands; the keepers are a tight group. [On leaving out Kieffer Moore] I want pace up front, and DJ [Dan James] certainly falls into that category. We\u2019re not happy [about the armband issue] - it was made so late that it\u2019s out of our control. I\u2019m not gonna risk Gareth Bale going onto the pitch on a booking, it\u2019s crazy. He\u2019s waited so long to play at a World Cup, and if he did that he\u2019d be suspended for the third game.

Has there ever been a song sang in a football stadium... or any sport... that can stir the blood as much as that?  \u201cIt\u2019s basically cheating, they already had Land of My Fathers, Cwm Rhondda and others, and now they\u2019ve upgraded them all to add this. It\u2019s like City buying Haaland, but worse.

More importantly, are the US better?      5.58pm   Team news  The 19-year-old Yunus Musah becomes the USMNT\u2019s youngest player at a World Cup, while Borussia Dortmund\u2019s Gio Reyna is only on the bench.

Referee Abdulrahman Al-Jassim (Qatar)   Updated at 7.07pm GMT    5.47pm    Gareth Bale won\u2019t be wearing a OneLove armband tonight. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re familiar with a story that has been simmering for the last couple of days. But if not, this is what happened.       5.35pm   Preamble  I think I\u2019ll leave this one to Michael Sheen.  Yep, it\u2019s time for Wales\u2019 first World Cup game since 19 June 1958, when a future Viagra salesman named Edson scored the only goal in their quarter-final against Brazil. Wales have had a number of near misses since, none more painful or poignant than 17 November 1993, but it feels almost cheesily appropriate that this golden age of Welsh football should end with them finally reaching a World Cup. As someone who is neither Welsh nor patriotic, I won\u2019t pretend to understand how this feels, or what it says about national identity. But I\u2019d have to be the king of all dullards not to appreciate just how important tonight is to approximately 3.19 million people. If Qatar 2022 feels like a last hurrah for Wales, certainly Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey, then it\u2019s the beginning of something for the USA. They are the second youngest squad at the tournament behind Ghana, with an average age of 25. And at 23, Leeds midfielder Tyler Adams is their youngest captain at a World Cup since Walter Bahr in 1950. All connected with the USMNT already have half an eye on 2026, when they will co-host the tournament and can dream about going beyond the quarter-finals for the first time. The World Cup is also a new experience for their squad. It\u2019s only eight years since the last appearance, but after qualifying for seven tournaments in a row, missing out in 2018 was an unwelcome shock. DeAndre Yedlin is the only player who was in Brazil in 2014. Both teams had to work pretty hard to qualify. Wales beat Austria and then Ukraine in the play-offs; the US finished third in the Concacaf standings, behind Canada and Mexico, thanks almost entirely to their excellent home form. They\u2019ve won none of their last eight games outside America, but they are traditionally awkward opponents for anyone at a World Cup. It feels close to a 50/50 game. If you\u2019re into the whole rankings thing, this game is 16th v 19th. (Surprisingly, given events earlier today, this is the only group in the tournament with all four teams in the top 20.) If the other results go as expected \u2013 which they won\u2019t, they never do, so I\u2019m not sure what my point is \u2013 this will be the most important game in Group B, the one that decides who plays the Netherlands, Senegal or Ecuador in the last 16. As such this feels like a classic musn\u2019t-lose game, although for some it\u2019s a who-gives-a-flying-one-about-the-result game: Wales are playing at a World Cup for the first time in 64 years, and the rest is just detail. Kick off 7pm GMT, 2pm in New York, 10pm in Al Rayyan.   Updated at 5.44pm GMT "

And that\u2019s just the players; at least one of Argentina\u2019s coaching team was also booked.  Updated at 10.21pm GMT    10.17pm    After that weirdly wonderful game, it\u2019s time for a lie-down. Thanks for all your emails tonight; it was so frantic towards the end that I had to shut my inbox in the interests of sanity-preservation. I\u2019ll leave you with Ben Fisher\u2019s report from the Lusail Stadium. Goodnight!      10.13pm    Empathy corner      10.12pm    If England do somehow meet Argentina in the final, don\u2019t be surprised if Andy Carroll gets a late call-up. They went to pieces when the Netherlands starting going long towards Luuk de Jong and Wout Weghorst.     10.07pm         10.03pm    Argentina won that game three times. First when they went 2-0 up in normal time, then when they went 2-0 up in the penalty competition, and then finally \u2013 after Enzo Fernandez\u2019s miss threatened yet another twist \u2013 when Lautaro Martinez scored the decisive penalty.     10.01pm    I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a game quite like that. In many ways it was a stinker, but it had drama, aggro, a couple of sublime passes from Lionel Messi and Teun Koopmeiners, at least 14 yellow cards and the bizarre sight of the Netherlands playing lime Bobby Gould\u2019s Wimbledon, and doing it brilliantly.  Updated at 10.19pm GMT    9.58pm    Wout Weghorst is in tears, lying head down on the pitch. His two late goals brought Netherlands back from the dead, but they didn\u2019t go in for the kill in extra time. Ultimately the hero was not Weghorst but Emi Martinez, who made two quite brilliant penalty saves.     9.57pm    It was a really good penalty from Lautaro Martinez, who sent Noppert the wrong way and whipped the ball high to his left. For the second time in three World Cups, Louis van Gaal\u2019s Netherlands have gone out on penalties to Argentina. Meanwhile, the two benches are having yet another fracas, though it\u2019s hard to see exactly what is happening.  Updated at 10.07pm GMT    9.56pm   Full time: Netherlands 2-2 Argentina (3-4 pens)  Argentina will play Croatia in the semi-final on Tuesday after finally overcoming the Netherlands in a weird classic!   Updated at 10.02pm GMT    9.56pm    PENALTIES: Netherlands 3-3 Argentina Luuk de Jong keeps the Netherlands alive with another calm penalty. But now it\u2019ll be Lautaro Martinez, with the chance to put Argentina in the semi-finals.  Updated at 10.06pm GMT    9.55pm    PENALTIES: Netherlands 2-3 Argentina Fernandez shoots just wide of the left-hand post! It\u2019s not quite over yet.     9.54pm    PENALTIES: Netherlands 2-3 Argentina Weghorst scores! Then there\u2019s a row between Timber and one of the Argentina players. It\u2019s been such an ill-tempered game. But if Enzo Fernandez scores, Argentina will be through.     9.53pm    PENALTIES: Netherlands 1-3 Argentina Montiel sends Noppert the wrong way! Argentina are one more Martinez save away from the semi-finals.  Updated at 10.06pm GMT    9.53pm    PENALTIES: Netherlands 1-2 Argentina Koopmeiners scores emphatically to keep the Netherlands in with an outside chance.     9.52pm    PENALTIES: Netherlands 0-2 Argentina Paredes whacks an excellent penalty into the left-hand corner, and Argentina are already on the brink of the semi-finals.     9.51pm    PENALTIES: Netherlands 0-1 Argentina Martinez makes an even better save from Berghuis! He saved three in the Copa America against Colombia, and now he\u2019s doing it again. It was a pretty good penalty, hammered low to Martinez\u2019s left, but Martinez guessed right and beat it away.  Updated at 9.51pm GMT    9.50pm    PENALTIES: Netherlands 0-1 Argentina Lionel Messi scores, cockily sending Noppert the wrong way.     9.49pm    PENALTIES: Netherlands 0-0 Argentina Martinez saves brilliantly from Van Dijk!   Updated at 9.52pm GMT    9.48pm    The Netherlands will go first. Virgil van Dijk, to be precise.     9.47pm    Argentina beat the Netherlands 4-2 on penalties in the 2014 semi-final, with Ron Vlaar and Wesley Sneijder missing. Traditionally, Argentina have a much better record in shootouts than the Netherlands, who were eliminated on penalties in 1992, 1996, 1998, 2000 and 2014.     9.46pm    Whichever team loses this will have all sorts of regrets \u2013 Argentina for wobbling in the face of Total Longball, the Netherlands for not killing Argentina off in the first period of extra-time.     9.45pm   Full time: Netherlands 2-2 Argentina  And after all that, it goes to penalties.      9.44pm    ET: 120+1 min: Fernandez hits the post! Dear me. The corner was taken short and worked to Fernandez, 25 yards out. He took a touch and pinged a sweet shot across goal that beat Noppert and rebounded off the outside of the post.     9.44pm    ET: 120 min: Di Maria almost scores from the corner! He smashed it towards the near post, deliberately I think, and Noppert leapt to push it over.  Updated at 9.45pm GMT    9.43pm    ET: 120 min The Netherlands area hanging on desperately. Messi\u2019s shot from the edge of the D takes a deflection and rolls a few yards wide.     9.42pm    ET: 119 min The lively Lautaro Martinez rolls Timber neatly on the edge of the D and hits a rasping left-footed drive that is punched away by Noppert, diving to his right. Good save.      9.42pm    ET: 119 min You couldn\u2019t call this a great game, but it will certainly live in the memory as a kind of disgusting classic.     9.41pm    ET: 118 min A good inswinging cross from Lang is confidently claimed by Emi Martinez, with Berghuis waiting behind him to score.     9.39pm    ET: 116 min I have no idea where Argentina have found this burst of energy. Di Maria\u2019s outswinging corner is headed over at the near post by Pezzella, a half chance at best.     9.39pm    ET: 115 min It\u2019s Argentina who are pushing for the winner. Fernandez\u2019s long-range shot hits Weghorst before bouncing over the stranded Noppert and onto the roof of the net! Dear me, that was so close.     9.38pm    ET: 114 min: Chance for Argentina! Di Maria zips round the back on the right and arrows a cutback towards Lautaro Martinez, whose sweet first-time shot hits Van Dijk in the breastbone and flies behind for a corner. I don\u2019t think it was going in, though I wouldn\u2019t bet the farm on it.  Updated at 9.40pm GMT    9.36pm    ET: 113 min Netherlands bring on Noa Lang for Cody Gakpo.     9.36pm    ET: 113 min: Chance for the Netherlands! Gakpo lookps the free-kick towards the unmarked Luuk de Jong, whose volley is crucially blocked by Fernandez.     9.35pm    ET: 112 min Gakpo charges forward and is challenged strongly by Pezzella. He gets the ball but scissors Gakpo afterwards. Another yellow card, the 15th of the game I think.     9.34pm    ET: 111 min Another Argentina substitution, and an attacking one: Angel Di Maria replaces Lisandro Martinez.     9.33pm    ET: 110 min Messi take a short free-kick on the right, then shimmies infield towards the edge of the area. \u201cHere we go, here we go,\u201d says the BBC commentator Jonathan Pearce, at which point Messi picks out the man in Row F.     9.33pm    ET: 109 min Argentina are having more of the ball now. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s happened to the Netherlands in extra time. Maybe they\u2019re just shattered. Meanwhile, the referee has booked Montiel for dissent, which means he\u2019ll miss the semi-final if Argentina get there. That\u2019s the 74th booking of the game.     9.31pm    ET: 108 min \u201cRob, we need to dwell on that Dutch free kick,\u201d says David Griffiths. \u201cReminded me very much of the Argentine free kick trick vs England in 1998. Could we say the Dutch out-Zanettied the Argentines there?  That\u2019s a good comparison. I think this one was even better because Koopmeiners played the pass infield, which is much harder to pull off. Zanetti\u2019s finish was even better than Weghorst\u2019s, though.     9.30pm    ET: 107 min Messi\u2019s inswinging corner is claimed at the second attempt by Noppert.      9.29pm    ET: 106 min Peep peep!     9.28pm    Argentina substitution Gonzalo Montiel replaces Nahuel Molina, whose superb goals feels forever ago.     9.26pm   Half time in extra time: Netherlands 2-2 Argentina  The first period of extra time was soundtracked by Brian Eno. No chances, no shots, unless I\u2019ve forgotten them, and a surprising lack of ambition from the Netherlands.   Updated at 9.33pm GMT    9.25pm         9.25pm    ET: 104 min Messi\u2019s floated free-kick just evades Otamendi, stretching at the far post.     9.24pm    ET: 104 min Timber commits another foul, this time on Lautaro Martinez, and gets, erm, another final warning.      9.23pm    ET: 103 min It feels like this is going to penalties. The Netherlands might, to use one of Diego Maradona\u2019s favourite phrases, be letting the tortoise get away from them here.     9.22pm    ET: 102 min \u201cShould that free kick equaliser have counted?\u201d says Alan Cormack. \u201cThe laws of the game state that no Dutch player should have been within 1m of the Argentine wall when that free kick was taken. Weghorst may have been ok, but there was another Dutch player between him and the wall who moved towards it as the ball was kicked. It would be difficult to argue that he wasn\u2019t interfering with the ball in such close proximity.\u201d Crikey, I missed that. I almost wish they\u2019d disallowed it, just to see Van Gaal\u2019s reaction when he was told why it had been ruled out.     9.22pm    ET: 101 min Messi runs into Timber and falls over. The referee buys it and gives Timber a final warning.     9.21pm    ET: 101 min \u201cAs magnificent as that free kick was, let\u2019s not forget the delightful contribution of German Pezzella for committing, arguably, the stupidest foul in this World Cup,\u201d says Sam Hankins. \u201cHow thick do you have to be to shoulder barge an opponent in the back with seconds to go to a semifinal? Unbelievable.\u201d     9.20pm    ET: 100 min Berghuis\u2019s inswinger is headed away.     9.20pm    ET: 99 min Luuk de Jong receives a neat pass from Frenkie de Jong and is fouled by Otamendi. The free-kick about 22 yards from goal, in line with the right edge of the area.     9.19pm    ET: 98 min Nothing has happened in extra time. Argentina look a bit shocked, the Netherlands look happy to be alive. I\u2019m surprised they haven\u2019t been more positive because all the momentum is with them, or at least it was at the start of extra time.     9.18pm    ET: 97 min \u201cVan Gaal also went full long ball against Ireland in 2001,\u201d says Tristan Murphy. \u201cHe had six attackers on at one stage, and was trying to hoof it up to the big man for the last 20.\u201d He brought himself on? Ho ho ho.      9.17pm    ET: 96 min The Netherlands have gone back to playing football, which is a bit strange in the circumstances.     9.16pm    ET: 95 min An overhit cross from Gakpo lands on the roof of the net. Martinez pulls his hands away at the last second. He still hasn\u2019t made a save in this game. In fairness, I know we\u2019ve been joking about Total Longball but Weghorst took both his goals beautifully.     9.15pm    ET: 95 min Where\u2019s Tim Krul when you need him.     9.15pm    ET: 94 min \u201cNo matter what occurs from here, that was one of the all-time-great free kicks,\u201d says Mac Millings. \u201cTechnique, strength, precision, and nerves of steel. Magnificent.\u201d And to do it at that moment, knowing how ridiculous you\u2019ll look if you mess it up. I\u2019d have been a quivering wreck, like a teenage boy who was invited t- well never mind.      9.13pm    ET: 93 min I thought Argentina had the game under control. They did, until Van Gaal revealed a hitherto unknown love of Charles Hughes\u2019 footballing philosophy. Thing is, Van Gaal 2.0 is all about one thing, results, and the last 15 minutes brooks no argument on that score.     9.11pm    ET: 92 min \u201cLong ball from the Dutch?\u201d says Niall Mullen. \u201cLike De Boer to Bergkamp?\u201d That was a long pass (or, as Cris Freddi put it so brilliantly, \u201ca stretch limo of a pass\u201d). Most of the, a-hem, passes in the last 20 minutes have been based on the Wimbledon 1988-89 season review VHS.      9.11pm    ET: 91 min Peep peep! Apparently Steven Bergwijn was booked during that mini-rumble at the final whistle. Messi is having a moan at the referee, although he should be thankful that Paredes wasn\u2019t sent off.  Updated at 9.11pm GMT    9.07pm    Blimey, it kicked off again at the final whistle, with both benches pushing and shoving. That equaliser, the nerve of it! The free-kick was on the edge of the D, just to the left of centre. Koopmeiners dummied to shoot and then threaded a gentle little pass into the area. Weghorst, who knew exactly what was coming, controlled it deftly, ignored Fernandez\u2019s challenge and gave Martinez no chance.   Updated at 10.15pm GMT    9.06pm   Full time: Netherlands 2-2 Argentina  Well that escalated slowly.   Updated at 9.13pm GMT    9.05pm    90+13 min Otamendi is booked, don\u2019t ask me why. It was Total Longball that unnerved Argentina, but that second goal really was ingenious and, in the circumstances, spectacularly ballsy.     9.05pm    This is uuuuuuuuuuunbelievable! Koopmeiners took the free-kick, but instead of shooting he angled a brilliantly clever pass into Weghorst. He took a touch, held off Fernandez and dragged a left-footed shot across Emi Martinez! What a goal!  Updated at 10.15pm GMT    9.03pm   GOAL! Netherlands 2-2 Argentina (Weghorst 90+11)  Total Football is dead, long live Total Longball!   Updated at 9.07pm GMT    9.03pm    90+11 min  Messi, who should have been booked earlier, does get a yellow card this time, I think for dissent.     9.02pm    90+10 min Pezzella shoves Weghorst over on the edge of the D, a stupid and needless foul\u2026     9.01pm    90+8 min Argentina have restored a little bit of order. Van Dijk is now playing as a centre-forward as well, but the Netherlands aren\u2019t putting enough balls \u2013 decent or otherwise \u2013 into the area.  Updated at 9.01pm GMT    8.58pm    90+6 min Gakpo\u2019s inswinging cross is headed away superbly under pressure by the backpedalling Otamendi. Better still for Argentina, he is fouled by De Jong and they can waste another 30 seconds.     8.57pm    90+5 min What a weird end to what looked like being an easy victory for Argentina. Netherlands are just lumping everything forward, and it\u2019s working far better than anything else they\u2019ve tried in this game.     8.56pm    90+3 min Lisandro Martinez is down after a clash of heads with Otamendi.      8.55pm    90+3 min Berghuis\u2019s free-kick hits the wall.     8.54pm    90+2 min In fact it was Van Dijk who was booked, not Ake.   Updated at 8.58pm GMT    8.54pm    90+1 min Otamendi fouls Gakpo on the edge of the D. Argentina have gone to pieces in the face of this unlikely Wimbledon 1988 tribute.  Updated at 8.55pm GMT    8.53pm    90+1 min: Ten minutes of added time!     8.53pm    90 min Ake was also booked apparently. Van Dijk put an Argentina player on the floor, possibly Paredes, but he wasn\u2019t booked.     8.52pm    90 min Paredes gets one yellow card, not two.      8.51pm    89 min: It\u2019s kicking off big time! Paredes fouls Ake and then hoofs the ball straight at the Dutch bench, who all charge on to the field looking to have an urgent discussion about etiquette. Oh my. It disperses quickly enough but for a few seconds it looked like there might be an old-fashioned bar-emptier. Paredes should really get two yellow cards here, one for the foul and one for smacking the ball at the Dutch bench.  Updated at 8.53pm GMT    8.50pm    87 min This is the first time all night that Argentinave have looked uncomfortable. Messi buys some time by running into Berghuis and falling over. Berghuis is booked.  The referee has been a bit pathetic tonight.     8.49pm    85 min: Just wide from Berghuis! All of a sudden, Total Longball has got Argentina on the reack. A long cross is headed down by Luuk de Jong to Berghuis, who whistles a screaming half-volley into the side netting at the near post. I thought that was in.  The referee gave a corner, though it didn\u2019t seem to take a deflection. And it certainly wasn\u2019t saved by Martinez, who barely saw it.     8.47pm    84 min That was the Netherlands\u2019 first attempt on target. Imagine if they win the World Cup with an orgy of headers from Weghorst and Luuk De Jong.     8.45pm    Total Longball may yet save the Netherlands. It was a simple goal: an inswinging cross from the right by Berghuis, and a fine flicked header from 12 yards by Weghorst.  Updated at 8.46pm GMT    8.45pm   GOAL! Netherlands 1-2 Argentina (Weghorst 83)  Hello!      8.44pm    82 min Another change for Argentina. Lautaro Martinez replaces Julian Alvarez up front.     8.43pm    81 min After good play from Mac Allister, Tagliafico\u2019s cross takes a deflection and loops into the hands of Noppert.     8.43pm    80 min Argentina and Croatia have met twice at the World Cup, both in the group stages. Argentina won 1-0 in 1998; Croatia hammered them 3-0 in 2018.     8.41pm    78 min: Double substitution for Argentina German Pezzella and Nicolas Tagliafico replace Cristian Romero and Marcos Acuna. The Netherlands bring on Wout Weghorst for Memphis Depay, who had a minor stinker. The Dutch cognoscenti will be loving this \u2013 Van Gaal now has two big lumps up front.     8.40pm    78 min \u201cDumfries withdrew his leg and didn\u2019t touch him,\u201d says Jan Schreuder.  Really? I missed that if so, though more importantly VAR missed it.     8.39pm    77 min Gakpo goes over in the area after a clumsy tackle, I think from Romero. That looked like a decent shout for a penalyt, though nobody really appealed.     8.38pm    76 min Lisandro Martinez and Depay have been booked. Apparently there\u2019s a protester on the field, though the cameras aren\u2019t showing it.     8.37pm    75 min There\u2019s a bit of a row between Emi Martinez and De Jong, though I don\u2019t think there was much in it.     8.36pm    It was a cool penalty, swept to the right of Noppert, who didn\u2019t even dive. Argentina are heading for a semi-final against Croatia.  Updated at 8.37pm GMT    8.35pm   GOAL! Netherlands 0-2 Argentina (Messi 73 pen)  Messi scores!     Updated at 8.50pm GMT    8.34pm    Acuna was on the left edge of the area when he cut back inside Dumfries, who dangled a lazy leg and brought him down. A clear and entirely needless penalty.     8.34pm   PENALTY TO ARGENTINA!  71 min I was just about to say Acuna has dominated his duel with Dumfries, and now he has won a penalty!     8.33pm    70 min Argentina are in total control of this game. I suppose you could have said the same about Brazil before they were stung by Croatia, but even so, the Netherlands have been so disappointing going forward.      8.32pm    69 min In fact they\u2019ve only had one shot off target.     8.29pm    67 min The Netherlands still haven\u2019t had a shot on target.      8.29pm    66 min: Argentina substitution Leandro Paredes replaces the excellent Rodrigo De Paul, who isn\u2019t fit enough to play 90 minutes.     8.27pm    65 min: Netherlands substitution Luuk de Jong replaces Daley Blind, which presumably means a switch to 4-3-3 with Ake moving to left-back.     8.27pm    64 min This is great. I got so excited about the pass that I forgot to mention the lovely sleight of hip to lose Ake.      8.26pm    63 min Messi smashes a spectacular free-kick just over the bar. It flashed across Noppert, who wouldn\u2019t have saved it, and brushed the top of the net.     8.24pm    61 min Messi is shoved over just outside the area by van Dijk. The free-kick is 22 yards out, slightly to the left of centre, which makes it perfect for a right-footer. Arf.  Updated at 8.25pm GMT    8.24pm    60 min \u201cNo Argentina Netherlands World Cup game would be complete without a mention of the Argentinian shithousery before the 1978 final,\u201d says Richard Hirst. \u201cEvery possible delaying and unsettling tactic utilised, and successfully in that the crowd were wound up to even greater heights of partisanship (and use of toilet rolls/streamers - those were the days). And let\u2019s not forget the Dutch goal, scored by the least \u2018total football\u2019 Dutch player imaginable.\u201d Yes, the kick-off was delayed by about 10 minutes because of van Hanegem\u2019s van der Kerkhof\u2019s cast, wasn\u2019t it? Abraham Klein wouldn\u2019t have allowed that nonsense.  Updated at 8.39pm GMT    8.22pm    59 min Mac Allister, who has generally been excellent, breaks through midfield but then overhits a relatively simple through pass to De Paul. It does feel like Argentina are going to pick the Netherlands off on the break.     8.21pm    59 min \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of talk about the way Messi is always looking two steps ahead and planning what could happen,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cFootball as chess. I admit, I don\u2019t always buy into that. The game is too fluid and reactionary. I always figured it\u2019s more a case of, he is so stupendously good, he can react to whatever situation is unfolding around him.  \u201cHe has the vision to see all of what\u2019s happening now, and the technical ability to do whatever is needed. But that pass has made me wonder. It never looked on. It didn\u2019t seem like a part of the game at that moment. Even watching it back, it doesn\u2019t look on. I\u2019ve never loved Messi, because I have an irrational hatred of Barcelona. But I respect the hell out of him. He deserves a shot at the World Cup. And Van Dijk can get back to training with his mates.\u201d  An Argentina v England final would be a feelgood classic.     8.19pm    57 min The Netherlands are having all of the ball now, though it\u2019s Argentina who are controlling the game. Their defence looks very comfortable.  Updated at 8.19pm GMT    8.18pm    55 min Messi is penalised, but not booked, for a brazen handball. That\u2019s a sackable offence from the referee.   Updated at 8.20pm GMT    8.15pm    52 min Lots of Netherlands possession now, though it\u2019s all in front of Argentina. At the moment they don\u2019t look like scoring.     8.14pm    51 min De Paul overhits a through pass to Messi, allowing Noppert to charge from his line and claim. That was half a chance.     8.12pm    49 min Gakpo does well to beat Martinez on the right but then chips a cross too close to the other Martinez, Emi. The Netherlands still haven\u2019t had a shot on target.     8.10pm    49 min \u201cThe France \u201898 edition of this matchup is one of my most vivid World Cup memories, so I\u2019m chuffed to see the legendary Edgar Davids coolly observing proceedings from the Dutch bench,\u201d says Peter Oh. \u201cHe\u2019s got to be one heck of an assistant coach for the Oranje. They will need his combative qualities in midfield to grind their way back against an abrasive opponent.\u201d     8.10pm    48 min Messi\u2019s corner is headed on at the near post and flashes across the area.     8.09pm    47 min Acuna wins an early corner for Argentina\u2026     8.08pm    46 min Peep peep!     8.08pm    Louis van Gaal has made a double substitution at half-time. Steven Berghuis and Teun Koopmeiners are on for Steven Bergwijn and Marten de Roon.     7.55pm    Half-time reading      7.55pm    Urgent rewrite required      7.52pm   Half time: Netherlands 0-1 Argentina  Peep peep! For all bar five seconds, that was a dismal, tetchy, downright boring 45 minutes. But what a five seconds they were. Nahuel Molina scored his first goal for Argentina after a devastatingly brilliant pass from Lionel Messi, whose World Cup dream is alive and well.    Updated at 8.23pm GMT    7.49pm    45+3 min \u201cHello Rob, re: Netherlands kits, 2006 is a paragon to be admired for simple elegance,\u201d says Rob Moore. \u201cQuite the opposite of the 2002 Nike pattern. Their 1988 van Basten kit was excellent, too, in all its Arsenal bruised banana &amp; Liverpool Candy-flecked glory.\u201d Yes 1988 is the ultimate, which I think goes for nearly four figures these days.     7.48pm    45+2 min Another booking, this time for the Dutch substitute Weghorst.     7.47pm    45+1 min The Netherlands appeal unsuccessfully for a penalty, saying Ake was pushed by Acuna as he tried to get to the resulting free-kick. No dice. There will be five minutes of added time.     7.46pm    45 min Now Romero is booked for a deliberate and slightly bizarre handball just outside the area on the left.     7.45pm    44 min Hang on, Acuna was booked, and rightly so \u2013 he stood on Dumfries\u2019 achilles. Acuna will miss the semi-final if Argentina get there.     7.44pm    43 min Acuna is lucky not to be booked for a really poor tackle on Dumfries. Timber pushes Acuna over and does get booked.     7.44pm    42 min \u201cSomewhere in the world,\u201d says Paul Griffin, \u201cClaudio Caniggia, and the family of Diego Maradona, are nostalgically looking at that pass out of nowhere, and remembering 1990.\u201d      7.42pm    41 min Here\u2019s the greatest moment of Nahuel Molina\u2019s professional life (to date).      7.41pm    40 min Alvarez angles a sharp pass into Messi on the edge of the area. He has Ake up his derriere but still makes room for a low right-footed shot on the turn that is comfortably saved by Noppert.  Updated at 7.41pm GMT    7.40pm    37 min There were three elements to that Messi pass, all nigh-on perfect \u2013 spotting it, timing the release and, perhaps most crucially, weighting it. Some of the Messi hype in this tournament has verged on the weird, but that deserves whatever praise you fancy.     7.37pm    It\u2019s Molina\u2019s first goal for his country, and he took it superbly. But we have to start with Messi. He shuffled infield from the right, 35 yards from goal, and suddenly reversed a glorious eye-of-the-needle pass between van Dijk and Blind to put Molina through on goal. He controlled the ball neatly on the run with his left foot and poked it past Noppert with his right.  Updated at 8.06pm GMT    7.35pm   GOAL! Netherlands 0-1 Argentina (Molina 35)  Nabuel Molina gives Argentina the lead after a sublime pass from Lionel Messi!    Updated at 7.45pm GMT    7.35pm    34 min Tite has resigned as Brazil coach after their defeat to Croatia this afternoon. There\u2019s something savage about the World Cup, isn\u2019t there.      7.34pm    33 min A shot on target! Molina angles a cross back to Messi on the edge of the area. He lays it back to the onrushing De Paul, who sidefoots a first-time shot straight at Noppert.     7.33pm    32 min De Paul nicks a loose ball 35 yards from goal and finds Alvarez. His imaginative reverse pass to Mac Allister is crucially cut out on the edge of the area.     7.32pm    30 min The referee has booked one of the Argentinian coaching staff, possibly out of boredom.   Updated at 7.33pm GMT    7.30pm    29 min The Netherlands are having slightly the better of it now, though it\u2019s still an arm-wrestle rather than a slugfest.   Updated at 7.31pm GMT    7.29pm    27 min \u201cI\u2019m supporting Argentina, and not just because I drew them in the work sweepie,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cAlexis Mac Allister - the best Argentinian name since Jos\u00e9 \u2018Joe\u2019 Brown claimed a winners\u2019 medal in 1986.\u201d Bit harsh on Alexis\u2019s dad.     7.27pm    26 min It\u2019s Netherlands 0-0 Argentina, and that\u2019s just shots on target.     7.25pm    24 min Bergwijn shoots well wide from the edge of the area after a quick one-two-three with Depay. That was half a chance.     7.25pm    24 min \u201cThe Dutch kit is a little hard on the eye,\u201d says Peadar de Burca. \u201cIt\u2019s orange, but it\u2019s not, you know orange. Cruyff would be Cruyff-turning in his grave.\u201d Pele-turning surely?  I know what you mean about the kit. For sheer brilliance, they\u2019ll never beat 2006.      7.23pm    22 min Messi shoots over the bar from 25 yards.     7.22pm    21 min Gakpo takes a short corner and lifts a cross that is headed away at the near postl.     7.21pm    21 min Ake waves a pass down the inside-left channel to Depay, who wins the first corner of the game off Otamendi.     7.21pm    20 min I\u2019d love to tell you this is a thriller, but I don\u2019t want to lie to you.     7.19pm    19 min \u201cArgentina play such negative soccer\u2026\u201d says Jeff Sachs. \u201cHope they lose.\u201d  Updated at 7.25pm GMT    7.19pm    18 min The Netherlands are coming into the game, and Martinez has to charge from his line to beat Bergwijn to a through ball.     7.18pm    17 min \u201cI too think this might be the Netherlands\u2019 night,\u201d says Marlon Cameron. \u201cAfter various approaches to the game have been found wanting (e.g. too many attacking players in Euro 2008, too little actual football as opposed to, ahem, vigour in 2010) could we finally be seeing the cradle of Total Football finding the kind of unflashy but effective system that you don\u2019t notice till it\u2019s taken the tape?\u201d There will be all sorts of cognitive dissonance if the Netherlands finally win the World Cup playing with three centre-halves and no wingers.     7.17pm    16 min Gakpo\u2019s deep cross is volleyed back across goal by Dumfries towards his fellow wing-back Blind. Romero eases him out of the way, a risky but ultimately fair challenge.     7.16pm    15 min \u201cEvery time the World Cup rolls around, I always seek out the Spanish-language channel that\u2019s showing it,\u201d says Michael Day. \u201cThis year, NBC\u2019s Peacock has Spanish streaming rights and the coverage is quality. My Spanish is almost non-existent, but the enthusiasm and presentation is always a much more joyful experience. Zero chest-puffing blowhard action. Brilliant.\u201d I don\u2019t suppose you can take the same approach to text commentary.     7.14pm    13 min De Paul is penalised for what looked a fair, if strong, challenge on Bergwijn. The referee has a word but no more.   Updated at 7.27pm GMT    7.13pm    12 min So far, on the NEDARGometer, this is more 2014 than 1998. It\u2019s been really cagey.     7.11pm    11 min Messi has started brightly. He runs across the line of the penalty area and slides the ball towards the overlapping Acuna. He wallops a cross straight out of play on the far side.     7.11pm    9 min \u201cThe last time Messi faced VvD, he lost,\u201d says Joe Pearson. \u201cNot a prediction, per se, but an observation.\u201d Yes but the Netherlands don\u2019t have Andy Robertson to violate him, do they.  Updated at 7.11pm GMT    7.10pm    8 min The goalkeeper Noppert plays a risky pass that only just evades the sliding Alvarez.      7.08pm    7 min The Argentina fans are making the usual racket, and their team have been the slightly better team so far.     7.06pm    5 min Messi is already finding space between the lines. He picks up a loose ball just past the centre circle, runs at the Netherlands defence and plays in the overlapping Molina. His cross is cleared to De Paul, whose long-range shot is blocked.   Updated at 7.29pm GMT    7.05pm    4 min Gakpo goes down after an off-the-ball collision with Molina. I say \u2018collision\u2019, Molina just ran into him. Both men are fine.     7.05pm    4 min Argentina have the extra man in midfield, with Gakpo playing pretty high up for the Netherlands \u2013 more false nine than orthodox No10.     7.04pm    4 min It\u2019s just like being there!      7.03pm    3 min The first half-decent move of the game. Mac Allister scurries through midfield and finds the overlapping left wing-back Acuna, whose low cross is booted clear at the near post.     7.02pm    2 min As expected, Both teams are playing with three centre-backs.      7.01pm    1 min Peep peep! Memphis Depay gets the game under way, with the Netherlands kicking from left to right as we watch.   Updated at 7.02pm GMT    7.00pm    \u201cI dunno, Rob, I\u2019m feeling jaded and mildly depressed,\u201d writes Neymar Charles Antaki. \u201cI wanted free-flowing, carefree, attacking football with beautiful moves, stunning skills, and both sides reliving the football of yesteryear that probably never really was. So then Morocco, and Croatia. Wonderful, of course, in their own way; hooray for resoluteness and three cheers for Luka Modri\u0107. But yes I\u2019m still feeling jaded and mildly depressed. Will this one cheer me up?\u201d Erm, it might?     6.58pm    Will Lionel Messi get No2 tonight?      6.56pm    Here come the players. The crowd is about 95 per cent Argentinian, if that counts for owt.     6.54pm    Five minutes to kick off Let\u2019s have a reminder of the teams. This time it\u2019s 11-a-side. Netherlands (3-4-1-2) Noppert; Timber, Van Dijk, Ake; Dumfries, De Roon, F de Jong, Blind; Gakpo; Depay, Bergwijn.Substitutes: Pasveer, Bijlow, De Ligt, De Vrij, L de Jong, Berghuis, Lang, Klaassen, Malacia, Janssen, Weghorst, Koopmeiners, Taylor, Simons, Frimpong. Argentina (3-5-2) E Martinez; Romero, Otamendi, Lisandro Martinez; Molina, De Paul, Fernandez, Mac Allister, Acuna; Messi, Alvarez.Substitutes: Armani, Rulli, Foyth, Tagliafico, Montiel, Paredes, Pezzella, Di Maria, Palacios, Correa, Almada, Gomez, Guido, Dybala, Lautaro Martinez. Referee Antonio Mateu Lahoz (Spain)     6.54pm    \u201cWow, that Croatia v Brazil game\u2026\u201d writes Rachel Clifton. Have escaped to the pub now to watch the second QF, mostly to avoid Alexi Lalas SHOUTING. ALL. THE. TIME. Fox coverage here is so so dreadful.\u201d So I hear.      6.51pm    This will be Lionel Messi\u2019s third World Cup quarter-final. He didn\u2019t get off the bench in the defeat to Germany in 2006, which seems absurd with hindsight but wasn\u2019t particularly outrageous at the time. In 2010 he was quiet as Argentina were picked off 4-0 by Germany, and in 2014 he started the move that led to Gonzalo Higuain\u2019s early winner.     6.42pm    \u201cRob, greetings from California,\u201d says Mary Waltz. \u201cSince they knocked out my eagles I should be bitter but I think the Netherlands will win. The psychological pressure to win one for Messi puts too much pressure on his squad to play naturally, they always look tight.\u201d     6.39pm    One last bit of pre-match reading      6.38pm    Match report: Croatia 1-1 Brazil (4-2 pens)      6.33pm    \u2018Beautifully pulled down by Bergkamp\u2026\u2019      6.27pm    Yes, yes, I realise I\u2019d put 12 players in the Dutch team. To you, dear reader, and especially to Davy Klaassen, I apologise.  Updated at 6.35pm GMT    6.25pm    Remember when Lautaro Martinez was a Golden Boot contender?   Updated at 6.28pm GMT    6.21pm    \u201cIt may be because I was young at the time and now lack the joy in my heart to be open to new things,\u201d boasts Niall Mullen, \u201cbut that 1998 quarter final remains the greatest game of Association Football I have ever seen. Somehow the game itself was bettered by the winning goal which itself was perfectly complemented by Barry Davies\u2019 wonderful commentary.\u201d If tonight\u2019s game is a stinker, you can always relive that match instead.      6.12pm         6.07pm    Fairytale No2      6.07pm    Fairytale No1   Updated at 6.07pm GMT    6.06pm    \u201cThis isn\u2019t unique; Brazil never met Argentina in a semi-final,\u201d writes Tenaiji. \u201cYeah, it happened twice 1974 &amp; 1982, both in Brazil\u2019s favour, but they were playing in a group game following the first round.\u201d Don\u2019t forget the goalless kickfest in 1978 \u2013 that was probably the closest to a semi-final, as a win for either team would have left them needing one point in the last game to reach the final. You could do a Joy of Six of Brazil v Argentina games that didn\u2019t happen because one or the other let the side down. The ultimate, of course, is the 2014 final: Brazil v Messi in the Maracana. Strange to think they haven\u2019t met at any stage of the World Cup since Maradona\u2019s heist in 1990.     5.56pm    This is a great read      5.50pm   Team news: Argentina switch to a back three  Both teams make one change from their second-round games. Steven Bergwijn replaces Davy Klaassen in the Netherlands team, which presumably means Cody Gakpo will drop back to play as the No10. Lisandro Martinez comes into the Argentina side in place of Papu Gomez. That should mean a switch from 4-3-3 to 3-5-2, which has jiggered my thesis on Argentina being more Dutch than the Dutch.

Luke McLaughlin has taken a trip down memory lane, just for you.      5.32pm    The winners of this game will play\u2026 actually we still don\u2019t know, because Croatia have just equalised in the 117th minute! Join Scott Murray for the denouement.      5.30pm   Preamble  This World Cup ain\u2019t big enough for both fairtytales. For reasons that would be intelligence-insulting to explain, it will be a tremendous story if either Louis van Gaal or Lionel Messi win the World Cup. But one of them has to leave the competition tonight. Netherlands v Argentina is such a tough game to call. Both have looked good at times, particularly when scoring silky team goals against the USA and Poland respectively. But at others \u2013 especially against Ecuador and Saudi Arabia \u2013 they\u2019ve looked a level below the big boys. Neither team has played an elite opponent yet, so we\u2019re still not sure how good they are, or how realistic it is to speculate that Van Gaal or Messi will win the World Cup. Over the next two hours \u2013 don\u2019t be surprised if it\u2019s three \u2013 we might find out. Kick off 7pm GMT, 10pm in Qatar, 8pm in Amsterdam, 4pm in Buenos Aires  Updated at 5.35pm GMT "

                    "body": "It moves like a Roman phalanx. A cohesive mass of humanity, relentlessly drilled, ruthless in its ambitions, clinical in its executions. In a different time and place, the Red Roses pack might have conquered the Mediterranean. \u201cThey\u2019re formidable, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d says Michaela Leonard, the Australian lock assuming the role of a Gallic warrior this weekend as her Wallaroos face up to the toughest challenge in world rugby. \u201cWe\u2019re ready for it. We\u2019re confident. We back ourselves. We want to prove to ourselves that we can do it.\u201d  In their 75-0 demolition of South Africa, England\u2019s forwards scored a dozen tries. There were hat-tricks for second rower Rosie Galligan and hooker Connie Powell. Sadia Kabeya and Poppy Cleall bagged two each with Shaunagh Brown crashing over as well. What\u2019s frightening, as far as Australia are concerned, is that none of them are guaranteed starters for the quarter-final clash in Auckland. \u201cBecause they\u2019ve got so much depth, you have to plan for so many scenarios,\u201d Leonard says. \u201cI help call the line-outs and I have to pay attention to a number of different possible combinations. You don\u2019t know who you\u2019ll be up against or who they\u2019ll put up in the air. That\u2019s why we\u2019re choosing to focus on our own game. If we spend too much time worrying about them we\u2019ll lose sight of what we can do.\u201d That\u2019s a romantic notion but the Wallaroos will be wise to be cautious. England were disjointed with ball in hand against South Africa but their set piece was brutally effective. The scrum routinely won penalties in both red zones. The line-out operated at 88%. The maul, the Roses\u2019 most potent weapon, contributed six tries to the cause. Australia will need to find a way of halting the tide but will have to do so within the laws of the game. Discipline has been a concern and they\u2019ve collected cards in each of their group games for a tally of four yellows and a red. Ten minutes with a numerical disadvantage against England could prove fatal which places extra pressure on the way they defend their line. \u201cYou never try to bring down a maul illegally or collapse the scrum, but at the same time you\u2019re doing everything you can to stop them getting over,\u201d says tight head prop, Bridie O\u2019Gorman. \u201cYou\u2019re desperate and in those moments you can do something that you shouldn\u2019t. We\u2019ve spoken about the aggression that we need to bring. We have to match them up front. It\u2019s a mindset thing.\u201d  The South African men\u2019s hooker, Bongi Mnonambi, has said that he envisages his wife and children behind him whenever he\u2019s up against a pack on the march, reimagining his opposition as home invaders. This helps him dig deep into his psyche to ignite his primal instincts. Leonard doesn\u2019t have any children, but she likes the strategy involving visualisation. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll think of my dog on Sunday,\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe that will give me a boost.\u201d She\u2019ll need it. Australia\u2019s squad, composed of teachers, personal trainers and a labourer, is up against a fully professional outfit that enjoys the advantages of adequate rest and recovery time. Conversely, when they\u2019re not in camp or on tour with their country, O\u2019Gorman works as a civil engineer and Leonard practices as a physiotherapist. Both state their desire for change in the women\u2019s game and point out the obvious impact of such a disparity. But that is no excuse, at least not for Scott Fava. The former five-Test Wallaby now serves as the Wallaroos\u2019 defence coach and argues that his charges are amateur in name only. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been together for the last five weeks, we\u2019ve done nothing else but gear up for this moment and prepare ourselves for it,\u201d Fava says. \u201cIf this was a one-off Test, then sure. We\u2019d be coming in cold. Back in August we had a two-month break and we got whacked 52-5 by New Zealand in Christchurch. We were effectively club players coming into a professional game.  \u201cBut they are professionals now. They\u2019re training like professionals and have the mindset of professionals. We\u2019re focussed on bringing the physicality against England because we know we can. We\u2019ve proved that by beating two northern hemisphere teams in the competition already.\u201d Narrow wins over Scotland and Wales has helped catapult Australia to sixth on World Rugby\u2019s rankings. It is also the first time since July 2019 that they\u2019ve won back-to-back Tests. According to Leonard, this change in fortune is a consequence of increased contact time. \u201cIt\u2019s so important that you understand each others\u2019 games when you\u2019re working together as a pack,\u201d she says. \u201cYou start to know what someone is going to do before they do it. If they\u2019re going to break around the fringe or if they need you to support them in the maul or on the floor. We\u2019re starting to click.\u201d Now is the acid test. Rugby Australia has set themselves a three-year target to offer professional contracts for its players. A win on Sunday might hasten that deadline."

                    "body": "In this uniquely concertinaed season, matches played every few days, squads in permanent rotation, results are probably all that matter. Though performances remain important, too, and as Arsenal lost focus against opponents who grew in belief, it appeared their minds had drifted to Sunday, and Chelsea. Three matches remain before Arsenal sign off for the World Cup, two in the Premier League, and still being leaders when football turns its focus on Qatar is clearly top priority.\nStill, the key objective of reaching the Europa League last 16 and winning their group was achieved, if without much style. Z\u00fcrich gave Arsenal some late scares and probably plenty of bruises but Kieran Tierney\u2019s first-half goal ended up being enough.\n\nVictory meant avoiding the extra two legs facing a Champions League dropout that Manchester United must fulfil. Ducking Juventus, Barcelona, Ajax, Sevilla and extra fatigue in February was a not inconsiderable prize, and Mikel Arteta had picked Gabriel Jesus, despite Sunday\u2019s high noon appointment at Stamford Bridge, as captain for the evening to lead an inexperienced forward line alongside Reiss Nelson and Eddie Nketiah.\nBukayo Saka\u2019s presence on the subs\u2019 bench, and second-half arrival, was relief in this precarious netherworld when any knock can cancel a plane ticket to Qatar. Japan\u2019s Takehrio Tomiyasu, a second-half sub subbed off with what looked a muscle injury, looked the latest sufferer of a hoodoo that this week may have claimed Tottenham\u2019s Son Heung-min and Chelsea\u2019s Ben Chilwell.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know,\u201d said Arteta of Tomiyasu. \u201cHe felt something and we didn\u2019t want to take any risks. With the amount of games we are playing, it\u2019s part of [it]. It can happen in training, it can happen in games and unfortunately it happened to Tomi.\u201d\nWith Granit Xhaka\u2019s suspension preventing him from facing his compatriots, Mohamed Elneny, a rare Arsene Wenger remnant, partnered Sambi Lokonga in midfield with Fabio Vieira offering the creativity. The Portuguese youngster played his part in Tierney\u2019s goal, his shot blocked after Ben White\u2019s ball from the byline. Tierney steered the rebound with venom, beyond Z\u00fcrich keeper Yanick Brecher, the first real shot on goal after a slow start.\n\nJesus may not have scored since 1 October but he is Arsenal\u2019s true live wire, dictating their tempo with his relentlessness. He was sorely missed after being subbed off just past the hour.\n\u201cIt does bother him for sure,\u201d said Arteta of his star striker\u2019s barren run. \u201cBut what he generates for the team is amazing. Last week he gave three assists. Today he was involved in every action again. The goals will come.\u201d\n\nWithout Jesus\u2019s defending from the front, Z\u00fcrich found life far easier, though also used the rough stuff as their way back in. Zoran Boranijasevic tearing the chest plate of Tierney\u2019s shirt asunder with a cynical grab but somehow escaping a booking was a highlight of their strong-arm tactics. Tierney, late on, took a further hefty whack, but afterwards \u00a8pronounced it \u201cjust a swollen ankle but it will be fine\u201d.\nSaka\u2019s arrival in place of Jesus received a huge cheer from the home fans. There was yet louder noise from the away contingent when they briefly believed Adrian Guerrero had equalised, only for him to be called offside. That immediately preceded Tomiyasu\u2019s fateful arrival as he and Martin \u00d8degaard came on for Vieira and White, the latter having been one of his team\u2019s best performers in overlapping from right-back.\nWith PSV leading Bodo/Glimt in the other group game, a Z\u00fcrich equaliser would have been, if not disastrous, then a problematic inconvenience. When Bohdan Vyunnyk, the Ukrainian, came on as sub and flashed a shot wide, Ramsdale launching himself at full stretch, there were collywobbles, shared by Gunners fans and an increasingly agitated Arteta.\n\u201cWe did not control the game well enough, especially in the second half,\u201d he admitted. \u201cAt the end, we were a bit leggy I think.\u201d His team has three matches, nine more days to play out."

                    "body": "Not since Martin Johnson hoisted the Webb Ellis Cup into the Sydney sky in 2003 has an English rugby union team been as tantalisingly close to World Cup glory in the southern hemisphere. If the Red Roses can join a truly exclusive club it would be a similarly symbolic moment and unquestionably place them among the finest women\u2019s sides of all time. Before all those debates can begin, though, there is still a game to be won. In September the head coach, Simon Middleton, acknowledged there could be no excuses in New Zealand for a squad who have benefited from full-time contracts for a longer period than any of their rivals. For all the Black Ferns\u2019 rapid improvement, England have now won 30 Tests on the spin. Hence Middleton\u2019s bullish tone on a sunny day in Bagshot a little over seven weeks ago: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to win it. This is the best prepared squad with the best strength in depth we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d  Now, finally, that moment of truth has arrived, with Middleton having also spoken before the tournament of his desire for England to be seen as \u201cthe best team in the world, across any sport\u201d. On the eve of their defining 80 minutes, the Red Roses would swap such grandiose talk for the ugliest of wins if it delivers them safely to their promised land. While a stylistic clash between England\u2019s hard-edged forwards and New Zealand\u2019s silky runners is likely, it could also boil down to which side starts the fastest. Should the Black Ferns get ahead early, the hosts could prove a real handful. To be in and around the England team hotel this week, nevertheless, has been instructive. The Red Roses\u2019 captain, Sarah Hunter, has felt \u201ca sense of calmness\u201d and a collective determination to play with no fear. Middleton has also sounded relaxed, even aiming a mischievous potshot at a New Zealand team he believes may find it harder to stay composed. \u201cI think it will be more intimidating for them,\u201d he suggested, when asked whether the Eden Park factor might sway the outcome. \u201cTo lose in front of a home crowd is a tough gig, so the pressure on them is absolutely massive.\u201d His opposite number, Wayne Smith, was suitably amused when this soundbite was relayed to him \u2013 \u201cHe\u2019s trying to put pressure on an old fella \u2026 I\u2019ve been coaching for 36 years, he\u2019s just a newcomer\u201d \u2013 and chose instead to talk up the Red Roses. \u201cWe\u2019re playing the best team in the world and we will have to be at our best,\u201d said the long-serving coach, for whom beachside retirement beckons after this weekend\u2019s contest. \u201cI was part of an All Blacks team which won 18 games in a row, so to have won 30 is difficult to get your head around.\u201d  A classic finale, either way, would further fuel the steady growth of the women\u2019s game, with a crowd of more than 40,000 set to contribute to a gamechanging occasion. \u201cIn 2010 nobody knew who the Black Ferns were,\u201d observed Ruby Tui, the Black Ferns\u2019 charismatic winger. \u201cWe were told we would never be paid. We were told we\u2019d never play at Eden Park. We were told women\u2019s rugby didn\u2019t matter. And now here we are 12 years later and Eden Park\u2019s sold out, bro. It\u2019s a really, really special moment. Kiwis are normally so laid back we\u2019re lying down but we\u2019ve finally got up.\u201d Tui is a sports promoter\u2019s dream and Smith confirmed she ranks high among the thousands of players, male and female, with whom he has worked over his long career. \u201cShe is phenomenal,\u201d said the former All Black. \u201cIf I had to write a book on the top 10 athletes I\u2019ve worked with, she\u2019d be one of them. She\u2019s an incredible character and deserves everything she gets.\u201d The Olympic sevens gold medallist, though, will find herself sharing a pitch with opponents who are also developing a special aura. Fate also seems to be at work. Decades ago a youthful Middleton, then playing for his local club Knottingley, near Pontefract, attended a coaching masterclass given by the widely respected Smith. Now here he is, pitting his wits against the great man in a World Cup final. While England have not been entirely faultless in this tournament, they may just be saving their best until last."

It is a minor miracle the Kinshasa-born Tshiunza is even a rugby player, let alone a vital presence in an Exeter squad who flew into South Africa on Monday on his 21st birthday. A very different life beckoned when he was growing up in the Democratic Republic of Congo, until his French-speaking family fled the country\u2019s civil war in 2010 and began a new chapter in Cardiff.  Initially they were wedged into a one-bedroom flat in Splott. The seven-year-old Christ, the youngest of five children, slept on a mattress he shared with two of his four sisters. \u201cWe were in and out of council houses and no one could speak English so that was tough. But then we met a nice Algerian family who spoke English and French and helped us out. People understood life at home wasn\u2019t easy \u2026 everyone in Wales was so nice.\u201d Life was similarly challenging when he started school. \u201cYou\u2019re sat in class without a clue what\u2019s going on. At playtime you can\u2019t really speak and make friends. So you find the only thing that doesn\u2019t have a language. I never had any brothers so sport was a way of connecting with other people. As soon as I started running around I knew I was going to do some form of sport. I was tall and moving faster than a lot of people. I knew I was different in a way.\u201d Rugby, though, mostly remained a foreign concept even when he first attended Whitchurch high school, alma mater of Gareth Bale, Sam Warburton and the Tour de France champion Geraint Thomas. At 15, though, Tshiunza had a sizeable growth spurt. The school\u2019s director of rugby, Steve Williams, urged him to give the sport a go and the coaches helped to raise sufficient funds to send him on a school tour to South Africa. There were three fixtures and the gangly Tshiunza was man of the match in two of them. \u201cDoors just started opening after that. You get to a point where you think: \u2018I\u2019ve got something here. I could use it or I could be an idiot and not fulfil it.\u2019\u201d  Just four years later, in November 2021, he was making his debut for Wales against Fiji at the Principality Stadium. Afterwards, with his new cap still perched on his head, Tshiunza handed over his first Wales jersey to Williams to thank him for his encouragement and guidance. \u201cWhen rugby started going well it would have been so easy to say: \u2018I\u2019ve found my sport now,\u2019 and blow off school. Guys like Steve Williams really keep you grounded. I\u2019m happy I met him when I did.\u201d There was to be another formative moment on a 2019 trip to South Africa, this time with Wales Under-18s. While visiting a local township, Tshiunza was given a glimpse of the world he had left behind. \u201cThe way they lived and they way they treated us rugby players was a very humbling experience. Being around all those children \u2026 that could have been me realistically. Not having much, living a very different lifestyle.\u201d Which is why Christ \u2013 pronounced as in \u201cwrist\u201d \u2013 is now so determined to make the most of his God-given talents. \u201cI don\u2019t go out much, if at all. The only thing I\u2019ll really do is go out for food with my mates now and then. I literally go home from the club straight to my laptop \u2026 you can get lost in the uni lifestyle and the rugby culture.\u201d His galloping late try to win a thrilling game against Harlequins in September was a striking reward for his dedication. \u201cHe\u2019s one of those guys who\u2019s going to keep getting better and better,\u201d says Exeter\u2019s director of rugby, Rob Baxter, whose side are in Pretoria to face the Bulls in the Champions Cup. \u201cThe good stuff he does is great but there\u2019s a bit more there.\u201d  If the versatile 6ft 6in tall, 114kg forward can force his way into Warren Gatland\u2019s Six Nations squad, it will also be partly down to the mental example of a former Royal Marines physio named Nick Cox, who supervised his recovery after a badly torn hamstring ruled him out for a large chunk of 2022. \u201cComing out of rehab I felt like a different person. Before I was kind of drifting but you flick a switch when you spend time with a man like Nick. Even now I\u2019m reaping the benefits of it.\u201d The year 2023 has long since been circled in red as well. \u201cI set myself the goal of playing at this World Cup in an interview four years ago. There\u2019s proof of it online. My parents were like: \u2018C\u2019mon Christ. Really?\u2019 But look where we are now. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s inner belief or God being in my favour but I\u2019ve found that things have always just panned out right.\u201d Should he ever falter he only has to think of his parents, Felix and Bernadette, and the alternative path they gave him and his sisters, who now work in healthcare and accountancy. \u201cIt keeps me level-headed because I know where I come from. I know the hardship my parents went through for me. They came here not knowing anyone. \u201cThey sacrificed their jobs, their friends and family back in Congo. I do a lot now with the end goal of being able to do the same for my parents one day. So they can finally relax. I want to be a successful person. That\u2019s it. Not an athlete or a businessman. I want to be a successful person.\u201d The story of Christ is already inspirational and he is not finished yet."

                    "body": "Walid Regragui walked into the room hidden beneath his hood. Slowly, he peeled it back, the reveal met by applause. Then he sat down and, with his first words, said: \u201cWell, it\u2019s a World Cup quarter-final\u201d.\nWhich of course it is, but the Morocco coach knows it is also more than that, seeing in their bid for a place in the semi-finals a means of bringing people together beyond their borders, a motor for African football and an opportunity for the continent\u2019s coaches.\nRegragui has only been in the job four months and, he revealed here, in discussions with the Moroccan football federation, that it is only his success that means he is still here now. Had the national team already gone, he might have done so too, determined to impose demands that would lead to his departure if they weren\u2019t met. They have been: this team is only the fourth from Africa to make the quarters and, the coach insisted, having taken a harder route there than their predecessors.\n\n\u201cI want to change the mentality,\u201d he said on the eve of the match against Portugal. \u201cThis won\u2019t be easy, just like Spain, Belgium and Croatia weren\u2019t easy.\u201d\nBorn in France, Regragui fought to bring Hakim Ziyech and Noussair Mazraoui back to the national team. He defended his turn to the diaspora in the face of criticism \u2013 \u201ca lot of journalists said \u2018why don\u2019t we play with guys born in Morocco\u2019,\u201d he noted \u2013 and named a squad with footballers born in France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Belgium and Canada. Of the starting XI against Spain, seven were born outside Morocco; 14 of the squad were.\n\n\u201cWe had a lot of problems about the guys born in Europe,\u201d Regragui admitted after victory over Spain. But the winning penalty was scored by Achraf Hakimi, raised in Madrid, and the Montreal-born Yassine Bono saved two penalties, the team now projected not just as representatives of their country but a continent and a community, supported by fans from all over. With the exception of Argentina, no one has packed stadiums or made noise like Morocco, the first Arab team to reach a World Cup quarter-final.\nA recurring theme, the idea of Morocco as the team of a continent and the Arab region is a discourse Regragui has been cautious about, but he is not unaware of its power and he talked here of the \u201cgood vibes\u201d, the symbolism of their success. He also expressed his hope that it \u2013 that he \u2013 could have a practical impact on coaches. For the first time at a World Cup, all of the African nations are coached by Africans: Aliou Ciss\u00e9, Jalel Kadri, Otto Addo, Rigobert Song and him.\n\u201cYou would have to ask European clubs why they don\u2019t hire African and Arab coaches,\u201d Regragui said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s culture, maybe it\u2019s mentality. Today I think it\u2019s impossible for Manchester City or Barcelona to bring in an Arab coach. They don\u2019t even think about it, as if we\u2019re not worthy, incapable. But there are moments in history that make people change their minds. And it is up to us Arab and African coaches to show we\u2019re ready.\n\n\u201cWhen you have five African coaches, if the results are there as we have seen with Senegal and with Morocco, it can happen. I\u2019ve been a coach for 10 years and nobody looked at me. \u2018Oh, no, he doesn\u2019t have experience. He can\u2019t go to Europe.\u2019 When there are five African coaches at a World Cup, there are more chances somebody will see. But what matters is competence. Your background doesn\u2019t matter, your religion, your culture. Competence. If you\u2019re not worthy, leave. I want to change the mentality. Sometimes we have to be honest. Competence. A lot of African coaches could coach in Europe and at great clubs.\u201d\nOne of the very few African or Arabic coaches in Europe is Mehdi Nafti, the former Birmingham midfielder who managed Levante until last month and also played with Regragui at Racing Santander. \u201cIt\u2019s a deep, interesting debate that Walid opens,\u201d he says. \u201cThe World Cup creates a boom, publicity and awareness, but that\u2019s only brief. Short term, it probably doesn\u2019t change much but mid-long term, why not? It can help to open doors but we have to do our bit too.\u201d\nChange requires improvement in the leagues where coaches start out, Nafti suggests. And Regragui too talked of the need for professionalisation and structural shifts. \u201cAfrican football is making progress,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a Super League, we want to invest. There has to be a locomotive to drive it, show the way. If we can do that, fantastic. The players can show anything is possible: that\u2019s the role of sport. To bring people together, show them they can believe. That\u2019s what the World Cup is doing.\u201d\n\u201cWe want to make history, inshalla,\u201d Regragui said. \u201cI\u2019m proud. We can feel the positive vibes: you don\u2019t only have one country, you have a continent, the Arabic people with you. That\u2019s very important for us, but we don\u2019t forget that we do it for us first. A lot of people pray for us. We\u2019ve achieved a great deal but it\u2019s not enough. We have to fight. We have surprised many: the algorithms, a lot of stats, all this data and calculations thought they knew who would win the World Cup but we want to show them we\u2019re here and hungry.\n\u201cWe have united Moroccans behind the team and that is worth more than money, titles, but I\u2019ve told the players it is not enough. We have made people happy and proud and if we can bring hope and energy, great. But our focus is the pitch. Of course Portugal are the favourites. They want to win the World Cup, just as Spain did. We are going to do everything we can to try to win this game.\u201d"

                    "body": "It was never part of the plan for Didier Deschamps to unveil a gambler\u2019s instinct. France\u2019s manager reads from a pragmatic playbook. When he was putting the finishing touches to his tactical preparations for this contest, Deschamps never could have imagined that Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 would have been standing over a penalty with two minutes of extra-time remaining, readying himself to rescue France for a second time and become the first player to score a hat-trick in a men\u2019s World Cup final since Geoff Hurst in 1966.\nEverything had spiralled out of control, Argentina\u2019s emotion trumping French cool. Caution? Organisation? Waiting for moments to strike on the break? Forget it. Lionel Messi had given Argentina a 3-2 lead and France needed something extraordinary.\nOf course, fairytale endings are often ripped up when Mbapp\u00e9 grabs the script. Even Messi could feel the narrative slipping away as Mbapp\u00e9 stirred towards the end of normal time, a two-goal lead vanishing, the story changing from Argentinian fantasy to France establishing themselves as one of the greatest teams of all time.\n\nHow to make sense of it all? France, flu-ridden and misshapen, were barely with us for the first 79 minutes. They lost it once, fought back from 2-0 down, lost it again and equalised again when the astonishing Mbapp\u00e9 converted his second penalty.\nBy the end Mbapp\u00e9 had the Golden Boot. Not the trophy, though. That belonged to Messi, which felt right. Argentina were the more complete team. France did not deserve to escape and the harsh reality is that Deschamps must reflect on the meek way his team started. It finished with a penalty shootout; really, though, France lost it during a wretched opening.\n\nThe deposed world champions were outclassed during the first half. It had been a choke, a collective and individual capitulation, a tactical and psychological failure. If ever there was a moment for Deschamps to roll the dice this was it.\nDrastic action was necessary after \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda made it 2-0 to Argentina. After watching his team arrive late to every loose ball and play as if they would rather have been somewhere else during the first 41 minutes, something snapped in Deschamps.\n\nThe desperation of the double change followed. In truth Deschamps could have replaced the lot of them. As it was, two numbers went up on the fourth official\u2019s board: those of Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and Olivier Giroud. They were the fall guys who had to endure the humiliation of a premature exit from the biggest game of all.\nIt was hard to argue. Giroud angrily kicked a bottle when he reached the bench, but he had landed no blows on Argentina\u2019s centre-backs. As for Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, he had started the evening by letting a pass run out for a throw-in. After doing so well to force his way back into the France team, the Barcelona winger froze. Much had been made of Demb\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019s improved work ethic before the game. But he is not a defender, as he demonstrated when he lost Di Mar\u00eda, naively fouled the winger and presented Messi with the chance to open the scoring from the spot.\n\nThat sense of panic was unlike France. They did not muster a shot in the first half. Antoine Griezmann and the hapless Theo Hernandez conceded possession in dangerous positions inside the first 10 minutes. Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni and Adrien Rabiot got nowhere near Messi in midfield.\nMeanwhile Mbapp\u00e9 was hurting his own team rather than Argentina. The issue is that the 23-year-old\u2019s talent gives him permission to cheat in a tactical sense. Much like Mohamed Salah at Liverpool, Mbapp\u00e9 holds a high position when France lose the ball and waits for counterattacking opportunities. But the issues with that approach were evident when the forward let Achraf Hakimi charge forward from right-back during France\u2019s semi-final against Morocco. Order was restored only when Deschamps took Giroud off for Marcus Thuram, who went to the left, and put Mbapp\u00e9 in the middle.\nDeschamps will wonder if that should have been the play from the start. Mbapp\u00e9 never tracked back on the left to help Hernandez with Messi, and was more dangerous when Thuram came on. Randal Kolo Muani, who would win the penalty for Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s first goal, offered more drive than Demb\u00e9l\u00e9.\nYet it was a response to Argentina seizing the initiative. Deschamps had been thrown by Lionel Scaloni adding width to his team by starting Di Mar\u00eda, who hung out on the left and tormented Jules Kound\u00e9.\n\nThis will inform criticism of Deschamps. France are often spoken of in grudging terms. They are clinical and cold, surgical and precise, pragmatic rather than flamboyant. They rely on moments, on flashes, sometimes even on opponents beating themselves.\nWhat often gets forgotten is that France can play. They were missing key players but their depth remains enviable. After 71 minutes Deschamps turned to his bench again, introducing Eduardo Camavinga and Kingsley Coman, who sparked the move that led to Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s spectacular second goal by barging Messi off the ball.\n\nFrance almost went into overdrive at 2-2. Even so, it is not how Deschamps wanted to win. He wanted an early goal, perhaps from a set piece, then maybe another on the break. Two-nil would have been nice. Deschamps would have hated a desperate and top-heavy France losing their identity and balance in midfield, their adrenaline levels dipped during extra-time, Messi running riot.\nThe question is whether Deschamps needs to send his team to play with more authority from the start. All tournament there has been a sense of France doing just enough. They were fortunate to get away with sitting on 1-0 leads against England and Morocco. In the end their luck ran out. It was their punishment for waiting too long to let their talent reveal itself."

Updated at 9.40pm GMT    9.35pm    Speaking after the match, M\u00fcller seemed resigned to the end of his international career. He may not be the only one.      9.24pm    For the record, Costa Rica\u2019s second goal has been reallocated to Neuer. Just in case he wasn\u2019t feeling bad enough.  Updated at 9.25pm GMT    9.19pm    Here\u2019s another Opta stat which gives some historical context to Germany\u2019s back-to-back group-stage exits. The fallout is going to be swift and brutal.      9.15pm    Here\u2019s a good stat. Musiala started the game really brightly but, unfortunately, the dribbling wasn\u2019t matched by the end product.      9.09pm    There was lots of correspondence in the second half, but it all got a bit hectic there. This, from Kate Roberts, gives some insight into the fleeting joy in Costa Rica after Tejeda and Vargas had threatened a miracle. \u201cThank goodness for the brilliant Guardian footie blogs. I\u2019m in Costa Rica, stuck at home with Covid and no telly. Not the same as hanging out in a local bar to see the match but really enjoying your commentary. For a bit of atmosphere, the car horn honking and the whoops of joy of the whole of eastern San Jos\u00e9 come right in my bedroom window when there\u2019s a goal.\u201d     9.02pm   Full time, Costa Rica 2-4 Germany \u2013 the four-time World Cup winners are out!  Despite avoiding another upset, Germany have crashed out at the group stage just as they did at Russia 2018. Costa Rica roared ahead in the second half and briefly looked set to displace Spain as runners-up, but ultimately finish bottom of Group E. Both sides are left disappointed, then, but Costa Rica can feel proud of coming so close to the knockouts. Germany, meanwhile, face a harrowing inquest.   Updated at 10.10pm GMT    8.57pm    90+9 min Musiala continues to chase an elusive goal, but can\u2019t find a way past Navas.  Updated at 9.45pm GMT    8.55pm    It\u2019s all over at Khalifa International Stadium. Germany are out of the World Cup, with Japan going through as Group E winners and Spain as runners-up.     8.54pm    90+6 min Musiala gets in behind and looks certain to score, but Salas makes a vital intervention and hoofs the ball away.     8.53pm    Japan still lead Spain. This is nail-biting stuff.     8.52pm    It\u2019s actually a double substitution for Costa Rica, with Roan Wilson also swapping in. Tejeda makes way.     8.52pm    90+3 min Both sides make late changes, Matthias Ginter coming on for S\u00fcle and Anthony Contreras for Oviedo.     8.50pm    90+2 min There will be 10 minutes of extra time here. Havertz almost has his hat-trick, but can\u2019t quite apply the finish.     8.49pm   GOAL! Costa Rica 2-4 Germany (F\u00fcllkrug 89)  88 min Kimmich plays a lovely quarterback-style ball from deep to San\u00e9, who chests it down for F\u00fcllkrug to lash home. It looks set to be chalked off for offside but, after some consultation with her team and VAR, Frappart awards the goal.   Updated at 9.46pm GMT    8.45pm    Japan still lead Spain 2-1, meaning Germany are heading out. They can only hope that Spain magic up a late equaliser.     8.43pm   GOAL! Costa Rica 2-3 Germany (Havertz 85)  It\u2019s a hammer blow for Costa Rica. Gnabry flashes a cross to the far post from the right flank, setting up Havertz to score his second goal of the game.   Updated at 9.47pm GMT    8.41pm    83 min Musiala sets off on another mazy dribble, working an opening only to lift his shot over the crossbar.   Updated at 9.48pm GMT    8.40pm    82 min Matarrita gets a dangerous ball into the box, but R\u00fcdiger is first to it. Costa Rica are pushing for a winner and look as likely to score as Germany at this stage.     8.39pm    79 min Bennette presses R\u00fcdiger high up the pitch and makes him extremely uncomfortable, but he recovers and gets the ball back to Neuer.     8.36pm    Amid all the chaos, Costa Rica made a couple of substitutions. Jewison Bennette and Ronald Matarrita are on for Fuller and Venegas. Oh, and \u00d3scar Duarte has been booked.     8.34pm    75 min Magnificent goalkeeping. San\u00e9 gets in behind and squares to F\u00fcllkrug. He connects nicely, but Navas throws himself in the way and saves from point-blank range.   Updated at 9.49pm GMT    8.32pm   GOAL! Costa Rica 2-2 Germany (Havertz 73)  Germany equalise almost immediately. Costa Rica fail to clear their lines, F\u00fcllkrug flicks the ball to Havertz and he lifts a shot over Navas and into the back of the net. For a moment there, Costa Rica looked poised to go through to the last 16 at the expense of Spain. It\u2019s not over yet, mind.    Updated at 9.50pm GMT    8.29pm    There\u2019s a VAR check for offside, but the goal passes muster. Germany are on the precipice.     8.28pm   GOAL! Costa Rica 2-1 Germany (Vargas 70)  Wow. Costa Rica win a free kick. Campbell lofts a high ball into the box. Waston heads it back across goal. It bobbles and falls for Vargas, who pokes it past Neuer with an outstretched boot.     Updated at 9.51pm GMT    8.25pm    67 min Germany can\u2019t believe their eyes. Musiala hits the post again, clanging a shot against the upright from distance.     8.24pm    66 min Flick makes a double change, bringing on Kai Havertz and Mario G\u00f6tze for M\u00fcller and Raum.     8.21pm    61 min Germany hit the woodwork again! Kimmich gets down the right flank and whips a cross to R\u00fcdiger, who grazes the outside of the same post that Musiala rattled moments earlier.   Updated at 8.56pm GMT    8.19pm    60 min Germany come forwards with a glimmer of desperation. Musiala hits the inside of the post, leaving his teammates with their heads in their hands.     8.18pm   GOAL! Costa Rica 1-1 Germany (Tejeda 58)  It\u2019s all going horribly wrong for Germany. Fuller makes inroads down the right and floats an inviting cross into the box. Kendall Waston has roared forwards and smashes a header at Neuer, who can only parry it. Yeltsin Tejeda follows up to score from close range.    Updated at 9.52pm GMT    8.15pm    55 min San\u00e9 has a crack from distance. The ball sails harmlessly into the stands. Flick makes another change, bringing on Niclas F\u00fcllkrug \u2013 the hero against Spain \u2013 for Ilkay G\u00fcndogan.  Updated at 8.22pm GMT    8.14pm    High drama. Japan are now 2-1 up against Spain after a goal from Ao Tanaka. Germany are in big trouble.     8.13pm    53 min Klostermann picks out Leroy San\u00e9 on the edge of the area, only for San\u00e9 to fluff his return ball. It\u2019s been an ineffectual performance from the Bayern forward.     8.10pm    52 min Musiala gets in behind on the left and tries to pick out a teammate, but Juan Pablo Vargas clears. Germany squander the ensuing corner.     8.08pm    Big news from the other game in Group E. Ritsu Doan has brought Japan level with Spain at 1-1 which means that, as things stand, Germany are going out.   Updated at 9.53pm GMT    8.05pm    Flick seems to be looking for more control in midfield. Klostermann has displaced Kimmich at right-back, with the Bayern Munich man moving into the middle of the park.     8.04pm   Second half kicks off  We\u2019re back under way in Al Khor.     8.02pm    Both sides make half-time changes. Goretzka swaps out for Lukas Klostermann, while Brandon Aguilera makes way for Youstin Salas.     7.59pm    Neil Jones writes in, and he\u2019s disappointed in Germany. \u201cThomas M\u00fcller [is] past it, how is he on there? I know Gnabry\u2019s scored, but his main function seems to be to kick it at the opposition\u2019s legs. Standard of crossing lamentable. Clueless in the box. They\u2019re going to sneak through, aren\u2019t they?\u201d     7.55pm   Half-time  Germany were in complete control for the first 40 minutes, but the last five minutes illustrated how Costa Rica could still hurt them. La Sele don\u2019t create many opportunities, but they still have the potential to capitalise on individual mistakes and hit back on the counter. Another goal would settle Germany\u2019s nerves but, while they have had little problem creating chances, their finishing has been scattergun. With 12 shots \u2013 four on target \u2013 but only one goal to show for their efforts, Flick\u2019s side need to kill this game as early as possible in the second half.  Updated at 8.01pm GMT    7.48pm    45 min Germany bombard Navas\u2019s goal ineffectually, before Costa Rica burst forwards on the counter-attack. They have a momentary four-on-two, but Campbell can\u2019t get the ball out from under his feet and the danger dissipates.     7.46pm      Updated at 8.06pm GMT    7.46pm    41 min Case in point. Raum lets the ball bounce and Fuller latches on to it. He gets the wrong side of R\u00fcdiger and, suddenly, he\u2019s one-on-one with Manuel Neuer. He smashes a shot at goal, which Neuer brushes over with his fingertips. How Germany could do with another goal before half-time.   Updated at 9.54pm GMT    7.42pm    39 min Gnabry wraps his foot round the ball in the box and swings a shot just round the far post. Navas breathes a sigh of relief. The score steadfastly refuses to budge beyond 1-0.     7.40pm    35 min Musiala skips into the box once again, shooting wide from a promising position. Germany are well on top, no doubt about it, but they have let a few decent chances pass them by and, as they know all too well from their defeat to Japan, a 1-0 lead certainly isn\u2019t unassailable.     7.36pm    34 min Kimmich has a shot from distance which swerves wickedly in the air, almost wrongfooting Navas. He makes the save but spills the ball, scrambling to tidy up.   Updated at 9.55pm GMT    7.35pm    Daniel Stauss writes in, and he\u2019s not impressed. \u201cCosta Rica are giving the ball away so cheaply in the middle third. There\u2019s space there to get at Germany, but it\u2019ll never happen with so many easy turnovers.\u201d     7.31pm    28 min Costa Rica have their first half-chance of the game. Bryan Oviedo curls in a cross from the left which falls nicely for Joel Campbell, the mercurial former Arsenal winger. He attempts to hit it on the volley, but scuffs horribly wide.     7.29pm    25 min Musiala, who has been Germany\u2019s biggest threat, has a shot blocked inside the area. Germany have had 72% possession and six shots to Costa Rica\u2019s none, which gives some sense of the pattern of the match.   Updated at 9.55pm GMT    7.27pm    Richard Hurst shares his thoughts via email: \u201cThe HRWC started off with such promise of genuine upsets, but it looks as if we romantics will be disappointed again, with Argentina and Germany going through, and only Belgium going out \u2013 and how much of an upset is that, in truth?\u201d     7.24pm    22 min Gnabry and Musiala combine menacingly on the edge of the area, but the attack breaks down when the former fails to control a return ball.     7.23pm    18 min Costa Rica are doing their best to get service to Johan Venegas up front, but Germany\u2019s centre-backs are dealing with the threat well so far. Having come in for a lot of criticism, especially after the defeat to Japan, Niklas S\u00fcle has been reasonably self-assured, while Antonio R\u00fcdiger has been solid.     7.16pm    14 min Leon Goretzka beats the offside trap and gets a header on target from close range, but Navas produces a reflex save to deny him.   Updated at 9.56pm GMT    7.15pm    Meanwhile, at Khalifa International Stadium, Spain have just taken the lead against Japan via \u00c1lvaro Morata. That\u2019s good news for the Germans.   Updated at 7.33pm GMT    7.13pm   GOAL! Costa Rica 0-1 Germany (Gnabry 10)  It\u2019s a simple opener for Germany and no more than they deserve after a dominant start. David Raum gets down the left and whips in a cross to Gnabry, who glances a header into the far corner.    Updated at 9.56pm GMT    7.10pm    7 min Musiala dances into the box and hurdles several attempted tackles, but fails to get a shot away. Costa Rica are living dangerously.   Updated at 9.57pm GMT    7.09pm    Another reader writes in. From Kari Tulinius: \u201cOf all the amazing stories so far in this World Cup, I think it\u2019s getting underplayed how remarkable it is that Costa Rica go into the final game of the group stage still in control of their destiny considering they lost their opening game 7-0. If I think of other teams that got that kind of first-game shellacking, like Saudi Arabia in 02 or El Salvador in 82, they were out by game two. Costa Rica have shown immense character.\u201d  Updated at 9.57pm GMT    7.06pm    4 min Navas makes another save after Gnabry ghosts in behind and lashes a shot on target from a narrowing angle. The assistant\u2019s flag goes up but, regardless, it\u2019s been a shaky start from Costa Rica.     7.04pm    2 min Keylor Navas is called into action almost immediately, keeping out Jamal Musiala at the cost of a corner. Joshua Kimmich\u2019s delivery is cleared.     7.02pm   Kick off!  We\u2019re under way at Al Bayt Stadium.     7.01pm    We have some correspondence. Alexandra Fullerton writes in from a less forgiving time zone: \u201cA very good early morning to you! These 3am matches are killing me but here\u2019s hoping La Sele manage to do it! Once again Pura Vida and thank you again for the commentary. Entertaining and enlightening as always!\u201d Flattery, is it? More please.     6.58pm    The national anthems are done and dusted. Up next, some football.   Updated at 7.19pm GMT    6.58pm    Will we get a low-block masterclass from Costa Rica tonight? Before their collapse against Spain, they had conceded only six goals in 12 games going back to the beginning of the year. Their 1-0 win against Japan \u2013 with Keysher Fuller\u2019s winner going down as their only shot on target at the tournament so far \u2013 was far more in keeping with their reputation as rearguard specialists. Leroy San\u00e9, Thomas M\u00fcller and Serge Gnabry will need to be at the top of their game here.     6.42pm   Beyond the football  As the tournament approaches the knockout stages and events on the pitch take on a life of their own, addressing the human cost of this World Cup remains as urgent as ever. Here\u2019s some pre-match reading.          6.20pm    For those already criticising Frappart\u2019s appointment, Derek Rae, ESPN\u2019s lead Bundesliga commentator, has a concise response.      6.16pm   Frappart set to make history  Whatever else happens this evening, St\u00e9phanie Frappart will mark an important milestone. She is about to become the first female referee to take charge of a men\u2019s World Cup match, leading an all-female officiating team alongside assistants Neuza Back and Karen D\u00edaz Medina.    Updated at 9.59pm GMT    6.06pm   Germany team news  \u2026 and here\u2019s Flick\u2019s starting XI.    Updated at 7.04pm GMT    6.05pm   Costa Rica team news  Here\u2019s how Luis Fernando Su\u00e1rez\u2019s side line up this evening.      5.47pm   Preamble  Well, well, well. If it isn\u2019t Germany having an existential crisis at the World Cup, again. Hansi Flick\u2019s side come into this match bottom of Group E after a shock 2-1 defeat to Japan and a dicey 1-1 draw against Spain, meaning they need a win here \u2013 and a sympathetic result between Japan and Spain \u2013 to avoid going out at the group stage in a repeat of Russia 2018. Costa Rica could make for tricky opponents, having beaten Japan 1-0, or they could be utterly rubbish, having lost 7-0 to Spain. It\u2019s honestly hard to say.   Updated at 6.24pm GMT "

                    "body": "A\u2019ja Wilson scored 19 points, Kelsey Plum added 17 and the United States beat China 83-61 on Saturday to win their fourth consecutive gold medal at the women\u2019s basketball World Cup. This was one of the most dominant teams in the Americans\u2019 storied history in the World Cup that now has won 11 gold medals. They now have won four straight gold medals for the first-time ever. This was also the biggest win in a gold-medal game, surpassing the 20-point wins that the Americans had done twice. \u201cIt feels great,\u201d said Wilson, who was selected as the tournament\u2019s MVP. \u201cWe came here on a mission, we got it. We got gold. Now we\u2019re going home with some hardware. It feels great to us. Australia was great to us. I didn\u2019t see any kangaroos, but it\u2019s OK because we are leaving with a gold.\u201d What started with Sue Bird and Diana Taurasi has now been passed down to Wilson and Breanna Stewart. With Alyssa Thomas the oldest player at 30, the domination could continue for years to come. As they\u2019ve done all tournament, the Americans did it on both ends of the court, playing stellar defense as well as using a high-powered offense. The US (8-0) finished the World Cup averaging 98.8 points \u2013 just short of the mark held by the 1994 team that averaged 99.1. They won by an average of 40.8 points, topping the mark held by the 2010 team.  The game was a sellout with nearly 16,000 fans \u2013 the biggest crowd to attend a women\u2019s World Cup game since the inaugural tournament in 1953 in Chile. Led by Li Yueru and Wu Tongtong, China hung around. The Chinese team trailed 33-28 late in the second quarter before the US went on a 10-2 run highlighted by fast-break layups by Stewart and Wilson to extend the advantage to double-digits. Jin Weina hit a three-pointer just before the halftime buzzer to get China back to within 10. The US were just too good to let the upset happen, outscoring China 25-14 in the third. The Americans did have one scary moment when Thomas went down after a collision with Li in the lane. She was helped off the court, but returned a few minutes later. China won their first medal since the 1994 World Cup when the team also took the silver and are a rising power in women\u2019s basketball. After the game, the team posed for a photo with their flag and men\u2019s great Yao Ming, who is the president of the Chinese Basketball Association. Li finished with 19 points and Wu added 13 before leaving the game in the fourth quarter after her knee gave out driving to the basket. She had to be carried off the court. The victory was the 30th in a row in World Cup play for the Americans, who haven\u2019t lost since the 2006 semi-finals against Russia. The Soviet Union holdsthe World Cup record with 56 straight wins from 1959-86. This is only the second time in the Americans\u2019 storied history they\u2019ve reached four consecutive gold medal contests. They also did it from 1979-90, winning three times. This US team, which has so many new faces on it, also continued to dominate the paint even without 6ft 8in Brittney Griner, outscoring their opponents by an average of 55-24. These two teams met in pool play and China gave the US their toughest game, losing by 14 points."

                    "body": "Here they are, back in the bus, and there\u2019s something exhilarating about being on the move with a police escort. It\u2019s a special little part of the pomp and pageantry of a truly big event. Just like the sound of aluminum studs clack-clack-clacking in a stadium tunnel before kickoff, it\u2019s a mental and sensory cue that it\u2019s game time. It\u2019s on. The US team steadily moves through traffic, winding through the Eternal City, gladiators on their way to Rome\u2019s latter-day Colosseum, the Stadio Olimpico. Just like in Trinidad, they\u2019re once again playing the antagonist to the crowd favorites. It\u2019s them against an entire nation, and they\u2019re behind enemy lines. Inside the bus, the mood is, somehow, looser than it was on the way to the Czechoslovakia game. How to describe it? The feeling on the way to their first game was filled with ignorance. Now that they\u2019ve been stung, they feel a little wiser. And, oddly, a little more confident, even if they\u2019re the only ones. Someone pushes play on a boom box. It\u2019s a hip-hop song, and the beat sounds awfully familiar.  It\u2019s \u201cVictory\u201d \u2026 their celebrity-studded novelty rap song/video! Hoots and hollers light up the bus. John Harkes stands up in the aisle and starts dancing the Roger Rabbit, to more cheers. They aren\u2019t Italy, they aren\u2019t Brazil, they aren\u2019t Argentina. They\u2019re the United States men\u2019s national team, and this is their song. This is them. The mood is suitably lightened. \u2022\u2022\u2022 A couple hours before kickoff, they get another warm-up out on the Stadio Olimpico field. The field is like a putting green \u2013 but even this early, the stadium is nowhere near as quiet as a golf course. There are maybe 500 people in the stands, and it already seems noisy. By kickoff, there will be 72,500 more. All 73,000 fans are expecting a goleada \u2026 meaning a rout. A thrashing. A trouncing. A licking. The Italian press has already written the script for this game. They\u2019ve been whipping up the nation ever since the Czechoslovaks had their own goleada against the United States four days ago. Actually, they\u2019ve been dreaming about it since last December, when Sophia Loren fatefully matched up the US with Italy at the World Cup draw. Pope John Paul II \u2013 a former goalkeeper \u2013 moved forward the Corpus Domini parade happening elsewhere in town today by one hour so that Italians won\u2019t miss a single goal of this match. The LA Times describes the US team as \u201cwalking through the valley of the shadow of death\u201d \u2026 that \u201cthere may be a blackout in Rome from all the electricity consumed by the Italian side of the scoreboard\u201d \u2026 and that \u201cthe situation may be hopeless.\u201d The New York Times\u2019 headline in its article about today\u2019s game is \u201cOlympic Stadium or Colosseum?\u201d John Harkes stunned reporters earlier in the week when he was asked how much of a blowout he\u2019d consider to be a good result. \u201cA tie or a win,\u201d he responded to the press pack. Silence. \u201cA tie or a win,\u201d Harkesy repeated. \u201cLook, if we do lose, I want to at least show the Italians we can play.\u201d His fellow Jersey boy and buddy-cop counterpart in midfield, Tab Ramos, was more pragmatic. \u201cThis game is going to be more difficult because the Italians are better than the Czechs,\u201d Tab told reporters. \u201cThe first few minutes are going to be difficult to stay composed. Then it\u2019s only going to get worse. I said before the World Cup that we might play the best games we\u2019ve ever played and lose them all by 3\u20130 or 4\u20130. That\u2019s a reality. It\u2019s not something we\u2019re ashamed of.\u201d Then there was Paul Caligiuri, ever the beatific Southern Californian, with his own take. \u201cI look at it as an inspiration to play against the best, in the most spectacular environment imaginable,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the time of my life, and I\u2019m going to make the best of it. I want to step up and take the challenge.\u201d The media have been talking about the record scoreline in a World Cup, since history might be about to beckon: It\u2019s a nine-goal margin, which has happened three times before. Oh, and this Italian team has not allowed a goal in its last 653 minutes \u2013that\u2019s seven straight shutouts. The Italian players already seem to be celebrating their victory, which is worrying their coach, Azeglio Vicini. \u201cI\u2019ve seen too much optimism here this week,\u201d he told reporters after practice. \u201cThere is too much talk of a high-scoring game, which I think we should forget about. We have to go for the two points and the mathematical qualification it will give us. We think the United States, having suffered five goals, will revamp their lineups and tactics and be even more determined to avoid such a result.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 From the Stadio Olimpico locker room, the Americans can hear the noise. Chanting. Stomping. A hum. A white noise. Energy vibrating through the steel and concrete, and into their safe little bunker. Everyone\u2019s suited up. Bob Gansler and the other coaches are once again dressed for a special occasion, in navy suits. Here comes one more talk by Bob. \u201cGents, I\u2019ve said it before. You can\u2019t be in awe of a team, and you can\u2019t be in awe of a situation,\u201d he reminds them. What awaits them outside that locker door isn\u2019t 40,000 delirious Trinidadians all in red expecting victory. It\u2019s 70,000 Italian fans expecting a massacre. It\u2019s indeed beginning to resemble the Colosseum. And this time, the US are not about to face the finest players from a tiny island, they\u2019re about to face the finest gladiators in the world: Walter Zenga, goalkeeper for Inter. A back line of Franco Baresi of Milan and Riccardo Ferri of Inter, with Giuseppe Bergomi of Inter and Paolo Maldini of Milan the fullbacks. A midfield of Nicola Berti of Inter, Roberto Donadoni of Milan, Fernando De Napoli of (yes) Napoli, and Giuseppe Giannini of Roma. The forwards are Andrea Carnevale of Napoli and Gianluca Vialli of Sampdoria. These are the very best Italians in a country with the very best professional league in the world. Baresi is already a legend. Maldini, the son of the great Cesare Maldini, is quickly becoming one. Donadoni is virtually unstoppable, a man who\u2019s everywhere at once. Vialli is hailed as Italy\u2019s finest forward. He\u2019s scored against the US before, when they played his club team in the Italian Alps last summer. Italy are so strong that not even Roberto Baggio, The Divine Ponytail \u2013 the man who just joined Juventus for a world-record transfer fee \u2013 can get into this starting XI! Most of the US team don\u2019t even play for a club. What a contrast this is. So, once again, just like back in Trinidad, here they are in a little locker room with their back against the wall and their reputation on the line, and once again they\u2019re about to walk onto a grassy stage where a hostile crowd expects them to be executed. Another blowout would be a terrible look indeed for American soccer. And it\u2019d be a terrible look for each of these players before the eyes of the world \u2013 destroying any career hopes they have in the world\u2019s game. Same shit, different stakes. \u201cDraw on the closest experience you have,\u201d Gansler tells his troops. He brings up Trinidad and Tobago, a do-or-die situation. \u201cThe Czech game was a \u2018do\u2019 situation,\u201d Gansler says. \u201cAnd we didn\u2019t.\u201d Yogi Berra couldn\u2019t have said it better. But this, he says, is bigger. This one\u2019s another do-or-die. And just as his players are quietly, confidently up for this game, Coach Gans is too. He\u2019s got a trick up his sleeve \u2013 not a genius one, but at this level, an effective chess move need not be elegant, just unexpected.  Soccer tactics 101 dictates that the inferior team set themselves up to defend deep, then try to make the most of their few chances throughout the game with quick counterattacks. After the world joyously ridiculed the Americans\u2019 last game, Gansler knew that everyone expected him to set up his team in accordance with this well-worn playbook. Gans decides, then, to mix up the quick counterattacks. The Americans would be defending deeply, in three banks like a Macedonian phalanx. No surprises there. When the Americans do get possession of the ball, they will aim to strike quickly if the chance is there; but other times, they\u2019re to slow it down. Get control. Hold it up. Focus on stringing passes together. Actually retain possession. It\u2019ll be the last thing the over-confident Italians \u2013 and their goal-hungry fans \u2013 will expect. And the last thing the Italians want is their own crowd on their back. As he always does, Gansler simplifies the strategy for his players and gives each a basic, straightforward assignment: Marcelo Balboa\u2019s job as a defensive midfielder is to break up attacks, and when he wins the ball back, just feed it to Harkesy or Tab. Jimmy Banks is to stick to Donadoni no matter what, like overcooked pasta. Bruce Murray is to lead the line, win battles in the air, and hold up play when necessary. Peter Vermes is to drop deep and help hold up the ball and retain possession. If they each do their jobs and keep the game close, all they need is one single chance to present itself \u2013 which it will, if their game plan can throw the Italians off of theirs. The Americans clack-clack-clack their way into the tunnel, lining up tallest to shortest, as usual, waiting to come onto the pitch. They\u2019re in their white shirts with blue stripes, white shorts, and white socks. If this is to be it for them, at least they\u2019re going down in style. Morituri te salutant. Soon, the Italians appear, in matching white Diadora warm-up jackets. They\u2019re not Eastern Bloc giants like the Czechoslovaks. In fact, they\u2019re not big at all. But they\u2019re giants nonetheless. Tab is in awe of these players he\u2019s seen on TV and looked up to. All these stars \u2013 the world\u2019s best \u2013 are in front of them. Unfortunately, they\u2019re all on the same goddamn team! It\u2019s starting to sink in. But there\u2019s something different in the Americans as they\u2019re here in the tunnel this time. It\u2019s not in the pit of their stomachs, but in their heads and their hearts. They know, somehow they just know that they\u2019re not going to get their asses kicked this time. Even by these world-class stars. The noise of the stadium surging in from the end of the tunnel isn\u2019t just heard, it\u2019s felt. Almost time to go out there. The referees signal that it\u2019s time to walk out onto the field. John Doyle, who\u2019s at the front of the American line, looks over at the first player lined up for Italy, Donadoni, to begin walking together. \u201cNo, no, my friend \u2013 you go. You go,\u201d Donadoni says to JD. Sweet ... this guy\u2019s really nice, JD thinks to himself, as the United States team walk out by themselves onto the Stadio Olimpico field, across the track and onto the grass. Immediately a deafening, terrible sound cascades down on them from all directions: the bellowing of boos and the shrieking of whistling. Christians being thrown to the lions. It was a trick. The Americans got done again by the Italians. Moments later, the Italians strut out of the tunnel \u2026 one at a time, as the crowd roars for each of them. They\u2019re cheering, waving flags, shouting, and applauding. The fans here in the Stadio Olimpico have caught the delirium of tournament hosts: they become intensely patriotic, and the hosts\u2019 games are as much celebrations as they are sporting events. Tonight there\u2019s a festive atmosphere in the stadium. The energy is palpable \u2013 and not an edgy kind of energy, as if the hosts had to face Brazil or West Germany. No, this feels like a national holiday. Italy\u2019s tricolor flags are everywhere, in all sizes. Thousands of them! And they\u2019re all in motion. It\u2019s a spectacular sight. The Americans take in the sights: 73,423 people \u2013 far more than they\u2019ve ever played in front of before. They line up on each side of the referees for the national anthems: First is The Star-Spangled Banner. The Americans put their hands over their hearts and look off into the middle distance, focusing on the task ahead. Then, here it comes: the Italian national anthem, Il Canto degli Italiani. An entire military marching band is in formation behind the players, and they play the jaunty tune. There\u2019s nothing quite like standing in the middle of 73,000 people who are all belting out the national anthem of your opponent. You can do nothing but stand there and endure it. What a moment \u2013 a very, very intimidating one ahead of kickoff. This is what you face when you play the host country. The Americans are already keyed up for this game \u2026 but hearing this, oh man \u2026 this really gets the adrenaline going. Holy shit \u2026 this is it. It\u2019s 75F and humid at kickoff, 9pm. Rome time. As the teams take their positions to kick off, the noise is something entirely different. It\u2019s gone from celebratory to raw energy. The thousands of Italian flags are still swaying throughout the stadium. The Azzurri are in blue shirts, white shorts, and blue socks. Bruce and Peter stand at the center circle, ready to get the ball rolling. Under the stadium floodlights, the match ball is gleaming, sparkling white. Now the decibels are unlike anything these Americans have ever played in, by a long shot. Teammates shout to each other, but nothing comes out. So they jog over closer, and still nothing. The Americans can move five yards from each other and still they can\u2019t be heard. How are they going to play in this? Murray rolls the Adidas Etrusco Unico ball to Vermes, who passes it backward, and with that, the Americans are in the game of their lives \u2013 pupils dilated, adrenaline jacked, hearts thumping in their chests, laser focused.

Worth noting the Europeans are still unbeaten. Saudi, Tunisia and Ecuador all looked good. But Iran, Qatar and Argentina have all looked pretty poor. Senegal were OK with a Man\u00e9 shaped hole up front.\u201d  Updated at 3.19pm GMT    3.17pm    We had *only* eight minutes added on in this match. Fergie-time has become Fifa-time.    The reason, Fifa has confirmed, is down to a new directive to ensure that all \u201cunnatural lost time\u201d is added on at the end of each half. In Qatar it has asked officials to more accurately monitor when a game is stopped for goal celebrations, time wasting, video assistant referee decisions, substitutions, penalties and red cards \u2013 even if it means extending a match by many minutes.      3.13pm    As we await the match report, some armband news.       3.10pm    Bogdan Kotarlic gets in touch: \u201cSaudi Arabia won earlier today, Tunisia held out for a draw against a very good Danish team, it seems to me that the non-European teams playing here in Qatar have improved in the last few years? Or maybe it is the case of few good performances and later these teams will be well beaten by the Europeans?\u201d     3.07pm    On that non-penalty, from my esteemed colleague Philip Cornwall: \u201cI think the no penalty call was not because of the handball, but because of a Denmark playing shoving a Tunisian beforehand. That\u2019s why it restarted with a Tunisia free-kick. Jensen shoves someone over with an arm in the back. The No 11, before the ball comes in: Taha Khenissi. Why else restart with a Tunisia free-kick?\u201d On ITV, rentaref Peter Walton is rattling on about it not being a handball. He\u2019ll probably change his opinion later to suit events, as is his way.  Updated at 3.08pm GMT    3.02pm   Full-time: Denmark 0-0 Tunisia  A result that will not resound as globally as Saudi Arabia beating Argentina but Tunisia celebrated that with gusto. They deserved their point, giving their all, and not without danger on the attack. Denmark lacked a cutting edge and were put off their stride, they were also denied a penalty late on, a couple, in fact. Instead, VAR\u2019s screen of doom was shown short shrift by the Mexican referee, and Tunisia got the point they deserve. That lived up to the description of an entertaining goalless draw.   Updated at 3.09pm GMT    2.58pm    90+8 min: Yeah, he\u2019s dragging this one out but more clumsiness from Cornelius results in a Tunisia free-kick. Surely that\u2019s it, and it is. A famous draw, a point well won by Tunisia.      2.57pm    90+6 min: Tunisia clinging on now, this would be a famous, and deserved, point, they will have at least one more corner to come. Eriksen will take, and the Tunisian keeper claims. Well done, him.      2.55pm   VAR called into action - Denmark penalty denied!  90+4 min: Hang on\u2026what\u2019s this? VAR called into action. The handball that took place ages ago is seen on screen, a penalty looks likely, and then the ref goes to the screen and waves it away. Told you he was no fan of VAR. Unprecedented scenes. C\u00e9sar Arturo Ramos, for it is he, you old renegade, you.   Updated at 3.00pm GMT    2.53pm    90+2 min: Getting scrappy now, and Dahmen slides to try and prevent a corner, but can\u2019t do it. Cornelius had got the ball stuck under his feet. There\u2019s an appeal for handball from the Danes. Again, no VAR called in.      2.51pm    90 min: Laidouni got hugs from all the Tunisia staff, for one hell of a shift.  Only five minutes added on. Fifa robbing us of bonus soccer when there\u2019s been a load of subs this half, is it?     2.49pm    88 min: Chance for a break as Damsgaard gets the ball but Cornelius is cumbersome and knocked over. Tunisia make another chance., two of them. Drager and Laidouni, who has looked tired since his solo run, go off, and Sassi and Kechrida off.  Updated at 2.50pm GMT    2.46pm    86 min: Booking for Khenissi, who wallops into Jensen.      2.44pm    84 min: Hannibal takes ball and man \u2013 Maehle \u2013 out at the touchline. There is nothing doing but that one looked close. The referee, who doesn\u2019t seem to like VAR much, shows utter disinterest.   Updated at 2.45pm GMT    2.43pm    83 min: Jensen has to hurry the ball back to Schmeichel as Hannibal gives chase.      2.41pm    80 min: Big cheers from the Tunisian fans \u2013 feels like the home fans \u2013 for a double substitution. Off go the two older strikers in Jebali and Msakani, for Hannibal, and Taha Yassine Khenissi.   Updated at 2.46pm GMT    2.39pm    79 min: Tunisia look tired, and so do Denmark. And there\u2019s probably 20 minutes to play yet if the referee follows the Fifa doctrine.      2.38pm    77 min: Cornelius and the high ball seems to be the new tactic for Denmark. If it can work for Kieffer Moore and Wales then why not? Jensen is booked for a foul on a speeding Sliti.      2.36pm    75 min: Cornelius holds up the ball down a channel but can\u2019t find a colleague. Jensen ducks and weaves but then can\u2019t get his shot on target. Hannibal, the Manchester United kid, may be imminent soon. The Tunisian crowd seems to hope so.      2.34pm    73 min: Kasper Hjulmand looks annoyed on the bench. This has been a decent match but must be frustrating to be involved in.      2.33pm    71 min: Tunisia want a penalty, the ball came off the naturally positioned hand of Andersen. He was close so no penalty. VAR did not have a look, the ref waved it away. Lengthy protests. A replay of the Cornelius incident: he had to score\u2026but didn\u2019t.   Updated at 2.35pm GMT    2.31pm    70 min: The corner causes chaos, Christensen heads across and the ball is heading over the line, it just needs Cornelius to tap in, and he fails to do so.   Updated at 2.34pm GMT    2.30pm    69 min: Those changes are taking a while to percolate, the game a bit shapeless, and Eriksen, coming into the middle, gets the chance to shoot from the edge of the box. Dahmen makes a fine save.      2.28pm    67 min: Tunisia sub: Slimane off, and Na\u00efm Sliti comes on.      2.26pm    65 min: Here it comes. Kjaer off, and he hands the armband to Jensen of Brentford. Cardiff legend Cornelius on, for Dolberg. Lindstrom, a Europa League winner with Eintracht, on for Skov Olsen. And with it comes a rejig, perhaps three at the back and a flooding of defence.   Updated at 2.30pm GMT    2.23pm    63 min: It appears a triple Denmark change is in the offing.      2.21pm    61 min: Ball headed behind for a Denmark corner. Eriksen skids the ball at Andersen but Tunisia clear.      2.19pm    59 min: Tunisia aren\u2019t done, and they try and mount an attack, their fans roaring every pass. The rarely spotted \u201cOl\u00e9\u201d at 0-0.   Updated at 2.20pm GMT    2.18pm    57 min: Maehle shows his skill, making space for Damsgaard to whip in the ball from the flank. Dahmen in the Tunisia goal flaps, and it\u2019s beginning to look like Denmark can see a way through. Dolberg\u2019s flick was there for the taking but Skov Olsen fails to read the ball\u2019s flight.      2.16pm    55 min: Denmark get the ball in the net after a lengthy ricochet session, Skov Olsen slots in, but there\u2019s an offside on the play.   Updated at 2.19pm GMT    2.15pm    54 min: Yann Dury is back with that Forest contingent in full(ish): Squad players:- Bren Johnson (Wales)- Neco Williams (Wales)- Wayne Hennessey (Wales)- Freuler (Switzerland)- Kouyate (Senegal)Loaned players:- Laryea (Toronto / Canada)- Drager (Dunno / Tunisia)- Aguilera (Dunno / Not that one / Costa Rica)- Hwang Ui-jo (Olymiakos / South Korea)- Horvath (Luton / USA!!)     2.13pm    53 min: Bronn, the centre-back, has a shot, and deflected behind. What a wall of noise. Slimane\u2019s corner is cleared.      2.12pm    51 min: Damsgaard is on the field to add extra creativity and ball-carrying, but he is surrounded by Tunisian defenders, whose line is held. And then the ball breaks for Laidouni, who is away, but not confident in himself, or his own energy. Then Draeger smashes over. Laidouni is bent double in exhaustion after that run. Not even the energy of the crowd can stop him feeling fatigued.      2.09pm    49 min: The Tunisian defence remains strong, and it feels like something special is going to be required.      2.07pm    47 min: Denmark immediately concede a corner, as Tunisia go again at the B of the Bang. It\u2019s cleared but the time when Denmark must pick off their opponents draws closer. At the moment, they are still being swarmed all over.   Updated at 2.13pm GMT    2.05pm    46 min: And we\u2019re back\u2026can the Tunisians keep it up?      1.56pm    Some emails.  K\u00e1ri Tulinius: \u201cI\u2019m surprised how lacking in imagination the Danes have been. A team of that quality shouldn\u2019t be sending speculative crosses in from deep in the first half. I imagine Jalel Kadri must be pretty happy with the way the match is going.\u201d Gregory Phillips: \u201cAll the focus on the players backing down has made us momentarily forget the point, I think, which is that FIFA is the villain here. Infantino is a joke, except he isn\u2019t funny. Not intentionally, anyway, and even the unintentionally farcical nature of his \u201cmanagement\u201d of this event is hard to laugh at given how many people have suffered. Sorry, I might just be annoyed that someone just scheduled a meeting with me during Mexico-Poland. What is wrong with people?\u201d Yann Dury: \u201cFive from the PL squad and a further five who are out on loan. Five of them were on team sheets yesterday (for three teams in two of the matches).\u201d Name them\u2026     1.54pm    Have some half-time Squires.       1.52pm   Half-time: Denmark 0-0 Tunisia  That\u2019s been a decent half, full of Tunisian energy, and Denmark frustrated. It took a Kasper Schmeichel save to keep it level at the break. The Danes will feel the bruises, and be deafened by the noise from the North African fans.      1.50pm    45+4 min: We get some added time, of course. But that\u2019s it for the first half.      1.50pm    45+3 min: Denmark have a free-kick in a decent, inside-right position, Eriksen territory. It zips in, and Meriah, one of the Tunisian towers, heads behind.      1.48pm    45+1 min: We had just four minutes added on, which feels like a tournament low. Delaney is being iced up on the sidelines.      1.47pm    45 min: Jembali shoves over Andersen, and somehow escapes a booking. It looks like Thomas Delaney will be going off. His day is done, and on comes Mikkel Damsgaard, of Brentford, though who hasn\u2019t made much of an impact in west London just yet. Delaney looked to be holding his hamstring. Uh oh.      1.44pm    43 min: So close! Looked like the one. Jembali was through, and Schmeichel, in a one-on-one, somehow smothers a ball heading for goal. That reminded very much of his father\u2019s starfish...it was a brilliant save, genetics in action.   Updated at 1.51pm GMT    1.42pm    41 min: Hjoberg wants a penalty for a foul from, yes, Laidouni. No dice. Thomas Delaney meanwhile has a problem. And gets slowly to his feet.   Updated at 1.47pm GMT    1.41pm    39 min: Slimane takes a corner for Tunisia, after plenty of jostling, and it falls to that man Laidouni, who sees glory and crashes it just wide. He\u2019s been excellent, the Ferencvaros player.  Here\u2019s our profile from our interactive.   The warrior in Tunisia\u2019s midfield. La\u00efdouni embodies Tunisian \u201cgrinta\u201d \u2013 grit and determination. A combative box-to-box runner, formidable in the tackle, he arrives in Qatar tipped to be his nation\u2019s breakout star this winter. It is clear that his days in Hungary are numbered, with major European clubs tracking his progress. He has spoken previously of his ambition to make the step up: \u201cI really like England and Germany. These are really two championships that make me excited \u2026 I just have to give the best of myself in each match: I always try to move forward. But there are no givens in football. That\u2019s why you should never stop working, surpassing yourself. That\u2019s my focus: I have to continue this momentum.\u201d       1.38pm    37 min: Laidouni, who has been the player of the game so far, attempts to thread a pass through. Tunisia have been close on a couple of occasions when looking to supply the final ball.      1.35pm    35 min: Denmark now dominating possession. Tunisia coiling ever backwards.      1.35pm    33 min: Tunisia\u2019s danger lies on the counter. Denmark are still trying to play their way through but they at last have a shot on goal. It\u2019s Hojbjerg who hits it, but the Tunisian keeper, Aymen Dahmen, has no problems saving it.      1.32pm    31 min: Kjaer launches it at Skov Olsen, who takes the ball down, and is then crowded out. Eriksen\u2019s corner causes trouble but Tunisia are good in the air, and throwing themselves at everything that comes their way.   Updated at 1.42pm GMT    1.31pm    29 min: Delaney\u2019s burst causes problems for the Tunisians, who hurriedly clear. The Danes are being hurried along in their attempts to attack, too. Tunisia\u2019s energy levels have been high.      1.28pm    27 min: It\u2019s opened up, at last. Skov Olsen perhaps could have got closer to a Maehle ball, and that man Laidouni cleans up at the back.      1.26pm    25 min: Laidouni, ever lively, ever involved, buys a fouls from Rasmus Christensen, and gets the Dane booked via his theatrical skills. He also bounces up to his feet soon after.   Updated at 1.33pm GMT    1.25pm    23 min: Tunisia get the ball in the net. Slimane escapes, holds off two defenders and slots, but he was offside. The flag was late, very late. No goal. And it looked offside some seconds before.      1.23pm    22 min: Denmark win a free-kick in dangerous position. Eriksen takes, and the ball zips across the box, begging to be knocked in. Skhiri \u2013 in mask \u2013 clears. He plies his trade for K\u00f6ln.      1.21pm    21 min: Eriksen\u2019s corner comes in, Andersen heads down and Tunisia clear. That\u2019s the most danger so far from Denmark.      1.21pm    20 min: Yes, we are somewhat short of goalmouth action at both ends. The Tunisian defence has been all powerful, though Maehle escapes down the flank, and Abdi has to clear behind.      1.19pm    17 min: Tunisia continue to be in the ascendancy, if not yet to warm the hands of Kasper Schmeichel, who has had a mixed time in Nice, it has to be said. And Leicester have missed him, too.   Updated at 1.20pm GMT    1.17pm    15 min: The noise and the singing from the Tunisian fans is all-encompassing. Hugh Molloy gets in touch from the actual Education City Stadium: \u201cI\u2019m at the game as a neutral and 99% of the noise is Tunisian. They are pumped!\u201d So does Lars Fink, back home, I think. \u201cTwo Tunisian players in the starting line-up are playing in the Danish Superligaen. Slimane for Br\u00f8ndby \u2013 and Jebali for OB (Odense Boldklub)\u2026That is BTW as many players from Superligaen in the Tunisian squad as in the Danish (Daniel Wass, Br\u00f8ndby and Andreas Cornelius FC K\u00f8benhavn/ FC Copenhagen).\u201d Great colour, chaps. Thanks for writing in.      1.14pm    13 min: Denmark look a little rattled, it must be said.      1.13pm    11 min: Tell you what, that was close. Mohamed Drager, of Nottingham Forest no less (loaned to Luzern), shoots, and the ball spins off Christensen and behind. Tunisia fancy this. There\u2019s probably a few random Forest players floating around this tournament.      1.11pm    10 min: Denmark attempt a couple of long balls. They aren\u2019t successful. Patience may be a virtue here. For those of us watching, too. The chances of a World Cup classic appear to be dwindling fast.      1.09pm    8 min: Denmark are staying calm in possession. As calm as they can be. Tunisia are set to destroy.      1.07pm    6 min: Been an intriguing tactical battle so far, as they say. Denmark with most of the possession, Tunisia holding their line well, and closing down everything. Laidouni seems to be leading the press and loses his boot in launching his latest reducer.      1.04pm    3 min: Boos and hisses for the Danes. This game has atmos, something lacking in a couple of matches so far, but not here. This feels like a home game for Tunisia, and Denmark\u2019s first job is to quieten the crowd. Good luck with that.   Updated at 1.07pm GMT    1.03pm    1 min: Away we go, and Denmark force a corner. Eriksen takes and when it\u2019s cleared, the Tunisian fans roar. They also love it when Eriksen, picking up the loose ball, is tackled by a sliding Laidouni, who celebrates in the manner a linebacker enjoys a quarterback being sacked.   Updated at 1.08pm GMT    12.58pm    Two very loud anthems done, and we are soon to kick off.      12.54pm    The Danish fans are making a raucous old noise, and their red colours proliferate in the Education City Stadium, though Tunisia have brought many more. I sat with their fans during their team\u2019s game with Saudi Arabia in 2006 in Munich and they were very loud, very passionate.   Updated at 12.57pm GMT    12.49pm    This match has a little bit to live up to. A World Cup classic took place this morning.       12.15pm    The armband farrago \u2013 and embargo \u2013 continues.       12.09pm    Kasper Dolberg starts, having not scored since joining Sevilla on loan. Tunisia make four changes from the team that lost 5-1 to Brazil in their final pre-World Cup friendly, with Danish-based players Anis Ben Slimane and Issam Jebali both in the starting line-up, with Wahbi Khazri is on the bench.     12.04pm    Simon Kjaer, who captains the Danes today, was The Guardian\u2019s 2021 Footballer Of The Year. He spoke to Nick Ames, our expert on this rather likeable team.      12.03pm   The starting teams  Denmark: Kasper Schmeichel, Joakim Andersen, Simon Kjaer (c), Andreas Christensen, Joakim Maehle, Pierre-Emil Hojbjerg, Thomas Delaney, Christian Eriksen, Andreas Skov Olsen, Kasper Dolberg, Rasmus Kristensen Tunisia: Aymen Dahmen, Ali Abdi, Montassar Talbi, Yassine Meriah, Dylan Bronn, Mohamed Draeger, Aissa Laidouni, Ellyes Skhiri, Anis Ben Slimane, Youssef Msakni (c), Issam Jembali     11.46am    Nick Ames spent time in Doha in the Denmark camp, and reminds us of the formula for their recent successes.   Eriksen\u2019s addition to the unit that, without his peerless ingenuity, captured so many imaginations should help tilt the numbers favourably. The team looks nicely balanced, with Pierre-Emile H\u00f8jbjerg and Thomas Delaney to either side of him in midfield while Simon Kj\u00e6r, feted for his reaction to Eriksen\u2019s collapse, has returned from long-term injury to anchor the defence. Atalanta\u2019s Joakim M\u00e6hle will bomb on from left-back while Mikkel Damsgaard and Kasper Dolberg remain bright sparks in attack.       11.41am    Kasper Hjulmand, the Denmark coach, also spoke ahead of this game. He was asked \u2013 of course \u2013 about Christian Eriksen.   After he came back, it\u2019s been unbelievable. The second he stepped into the pitch for the first time in Amsterdam, playing against Holland, he just took control of the match and scored, and since then, he\u2019s just been better and better. He is the rhythm, he is the heart of our team, the pulse of our play. He\u2019s a tremendous football player.      11.38am    The Tunisian coach, Jalel Kadri, spoke ahead of this match. A reminder: Tunisia have never got beyond the group stage of a World Cup.   Our group will not be easy, the draw has not been kind. Denmark is among the best squads in Europe. We know they have high quality in every department. But we will give our all. We have our strengths, but we also know our weaknesses. We are aware we will be compared to past Tunisia squads.  Tunisia have two players in the Danish league, Anis Ben Slimane at Brondby and Issam Jebali with Odense.     11.34am    Martin Braithwaite, Denmark\u2019s former Barcelona now Espanyol striker whose name reminds you of the lad whose parents ran the grocers, spoke to Sid Lowe.   Asked whether the cardiac arrest that Christian Eriksen suffered played a part in changing the team, Braithwaite says: \u201cIt changed each individual, more than just the group: it was beyond football.\u201d There\u2019s a prolonged pause, his tone quiet when he eventually starts up again. \u201cLife passes by so fast, you need to enjoy every moment. We went through it together, will always share that feeling. It\u2019s kind of a fairytale now that we\u2019re at the World Cup and Christian part of the team. No one could imagine that.\u201d       11.30am   Preamble  We Premier League viewers are used to seeing him back playing but Christian Eriksen\u2019s return to a major tournament stage is surely a moment. It was less than 18 months ago that his collapse and cardiac arrest brought Euro 2020 to a halt, and his return to top-level football is one of the game\u2019s good news stories. And he is a member of a rather handy Denmark team, one that did just fine without him, becoming one of Europe\u2019s best. They won nine of 10 qualifying games for this tournament, scoring 30 and conceding three, and reached the Nations League semis. Eriksen\u2019s supporting cast, who reached Euros semis without him, is full of quality, from Kasper Schmeichel to Kasper Dolberg. And they are a team who have shown a humanitarian edge, Hummel removed from their shirt, training in black, and it remains to seen if there is a gesture of the type Fifa is threatening sanctions on. Their opponents? Tunisia are in their sixth World Cup finals, and have ambitions to reach the knockouts. With a number of their players playing in Qatar, they should be acclimatised to the surroundings, and will make it tough for the Danes with the defensive formation that Jalel Kadri usually selects for decent opposition. Youssef Msakni is their key man though Sunderland legend Wahbi Khazri and Manchester United loanee Hannibal Mejbri may make appearances. Kick-off is 1pm UK time at the Education City Stadium Join me.  Updated at 1.14pm GMT "

                    "body": "Welcome to your new favourite sport. Well, that\u2019s what those fortunate enough to be at London\u2019s Copper Box Arena must have thought after witnessing a thoroughly entertaining night with 20 of the most remarkable athletes you are likely to find anywhere. This is rugby league, but not quite as you know it. And it is perhaps England\u2019s best chance of winning a Rugby League World Cup this year. The previous three iterations of the tournament have almost been held in low-key circumstances but this time, rugby league\u2019s best kept secret is there for all to see. And how we saw the best of the game here.  The hosts have lost the last two finals to France, but having beaten the French mid-season hopes are high Tom Coyd\u2019s side can go one further on home soil. Those hopes were raised further with a commanding win over Australia\u2019s Wheelaroos to put them in control of Group A, and on course to make the final in Manchester on 18 November. There were audible winces from the Copper Box crowd every time the players collided at full tilt, often with their chairs being tipped over and sending the heroes of this sport to the floor. Those at the heart of the collisions were, by and large, smiling every time they pulled themselves up and back into the thick of the action. That is the beauty of wheelchair rugby league. It is arguably the toughest version of the sport to play. It is uncompromising and it is beyond physical. But the players play the game in the right way with smiles on their faces: it is a celebration of everything that is wonderful about rugby league. And now it has the stage and the platform it deserves. With able-bodied and disabled players sharing a field, as well as players of any age and gender, there are few sports that are as open and welcoming. Just a few years ago, the sport was being played in empty arenas on courts littered with markings from other sports. This felt like the night the wheelchair game announced its arrival to the world. It was helped by the nature and manner of England\u2019s victory, of course \u2013 the hosts were outstanding. The early exchanges were, as you\u2019d expect between England and Australia, brutal. The Wheelaroos took the lead after nine minutes when Diab Karim collected his own chip over the top to ground the ball. But that stirred England into life and by half-time they were 26-6 ahead. Two tries from Joe Coyd and another from Jack Brown put the hosts in control, and while the intensity \u2013 and the huge collisions \u2013 did not stop from either side, England were much more impressive with ball in hand. The outstanding Nathan Collins then added a fourth try before Coyd claimed his second to move the hosts into what felt like an unassailable position, even with 40 minutes still to play. England retained control of the proceedings after the interval and while there weren\u2019t as many points, you sensed their experience meant they were able to hold Australia at arm\u2019s length. Seb Bechara crossed for the first try of the second half before, with nine minutes remaining, Coyd broke free to send Collins over in the corner for his second. That made it 38-6 and in truth, it was a scoreline that did not flatter the hosts, with Australia adding a late penalty before both sides received the applause their efforts deserved. In the other match in Group A, the first match of the double-header in London, Spain defeated Ireland 55-32. Ireland\u2019s Phil Roberts scored the first try of the tournament to put the Wolfhounds ahead but Spain took control of the remainder of the first half, scoring 30 unanswered points. Spain\u2019s Theo Gonzalez scored a try in each half and was generally at the heart of everything they did well in that first half. Peter Johnston Jr scored a hat-trick for the Wolfhounds either side of half-time to make it 34-20 and threaten a comeback from the Irish. But Spain regained control, with Yannick Martin among their scorers in the second half as they managed to keep the Irish at arm\u2019s length and emerge comfortable winners."

                    "body": "You drop Cristiano Ronaldo and the man you pick instead of him best not miss. Gon\u00e7alo Ramos is 21. He made his international debut last month. Before Tuesday he had played only 36 minutes of international football. And yet within 17 minutes he had already scored more World Cup knockout goals than Ronaldo; by midway through the second half he had completed the first hat-trick of Qatar 2022. Fernando Santos could hardly have been more obviously vindicated. Ramos, emphatically, did not miss, setting up a quarter-final against Morocco.\nSantos has the rumpled air of a man who has slept in his car. He could be Peter Falk playing Columbo. He is not a man who has ever willingly done anything interesting, so when the day before the game he criticised Ronaldo for his shushing gesture after being substituted against South Korea, it felt significant. Ronaldo himself claimed it was directed at the South Korean forward Cho Gue-sung, who was trying to chivvy him off the pitch but, given similar situations at Manchester United, the widespread assumption in Portugal seems to be that it was aimed at his critics, of whom there are a growing number. A poll in the sports daily A Bola suggested 70% of readers thought he should not start against the Swiss.\n\nIt was 6,747 days since Portugal last began a live tournament match without Ronaldo, against Russia at Euro 2004. But age, it feels, has caught up with him very quickly of late. Ramos had not quite turned three when that Russia game was played. Ronaldo inevitably draws the attention, the mass of his celebrity so great that everything else is drawn into his orbit but R\u00faben Neves and Jo\u00e3o Cancelo were also left out having played in every group game, which perhaps hinted that Santos had recognised that Portugal had not played especially well despite sealing qualification by winning their first two games.\n\nThis was far better. As United have found this season, teams function better without a black hole up front, dragging everything else into its overwhelming gravitational field. There was a lightness to Portugal, a sense of relief, of imagination. Ramos moved, and that allowed others to move off him. And that attacking midfield three of Portugal \u2013 Bruno Fernandes, Bernardo Silva and Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix \u2013 is packed with creative talent just waiting to be unleashed.\nTaking the handbrake off is not usually Santos\u2019s style (perhaps he worries the car will roll away with him snoring on the back seat), but it worked. Switzerland, surprisingly starting with a back three, simply could not cope. Fabian Sch\u00e4r, so improved for Newcastle this season, looked especially uncomfortable. Ramos turned him far too easily for the first and he was then emphatically beaten in the air by Pepe as he headed in a corner to make it 2-0 after 33 minutes, becoming the oldest man ever to score in a World Cup knockout game. Sch\u00e4r\u2019s yellow card for a lunge on Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix was indicative of his befuddlement and he was understandably withdrawn at half-time.\n\nRamos darted across the near post to turn in Diogo Dalot\u2019s low cross in via the undercarriage of Yann Sommer, laid on the fourth for Rapha\u00ebl Guerreiro and then dinked a fifth as the Swiss defence fell apart. Rafael Le\u00e3o floated in a brilliant sixth. Stop all the clocks: if you thought the Swiss would last forever, you were wrong. This was Portugal\u2019s biggest ever win in a tournament knockout game, the first time they had won a World Cup knockout game by two or more goals since beating North Korea 5-3 in 1966.\nIt was all very incongruous for a Santos team, all the more so when Manuel Akanji bundled in a corner at the back post to make it 4-1 just before the hour. Santos immediately was out to the edge of his technical area, pointing and glaring. A lot of people were having far too much fun.\n\nRonaldo seemed genuinely enthused by it all, joining the celebratory huddle after Pepe\u2019s goal, grinning broadly after Ramos\u2019s second and standing and applauding the fourth. Every now and again the big screens in the four corners of the ground would flash up a picture of Ronaldo on the bench, drawing screams of excitement. It all seemed a little uncomfortable, especially when the crowd started singing his name and then booing when Santos, never the most instinctive people-pleaser, refused to accede to their demands. Through it all, he sat impassive, chin propped on hand.\nThen, just one more thing, as Ronaldo was brought on for Ramos to rapturous cheers. By then, though, the applause for every touch felt pitched somewhere between pity and a disturbing hero worship. Even Ronaldo gave a slightly embarrassed grin before thumping a free-kick into the wall in time-honoured style.\nPerhaps there could yet be one great narrative crescendo in the Ronaldo-Lionel Messi saga with a Portugal v Argentina final. Such is Ronaldo\u2019s sense of his own destiny that it is entirely possible he could yet correct the climax of Euro 2016 when he was injured early and Portugal won without him, by coming off the bench to seal the glory. Right now, though, Portugal look an awful lot better without him."

                    "body": "Lionel Messi has the farewell he wished for. Or the stage for it, at least. On Sunday the forward \u2013 a well-known failure at international level \u2013 will play his sixth major final with Argentina. It will be his 26th World Cup game, more than anyone else ever, another record gathered up; it will also be his last.\n\u201cTo be able to finish my journey in the final makes me happy, and everything I have lived here is lovely,\u201d Messi said at the end of another night graced by another moment, like a gift given: something to hold when he has gone. \nEveryone \u201cknew\u201d that this would be Messi\u2019s last World Cup, the feeling that you might never see him again clinging to every game. He knew that too, which is part of the reason it has played out like this: call it mission, destiny or, just enjoyment. Seize the day, there aren\u2019t many left. And yet, 16 years after his first, as a substitute in that 6-0 win against Serbia and Montenegro, hearing it confirmed still hit. Wait, what? The final will be your last? \u201cYes, it surely will be,\u201d Messi said on Tuesday night. \u201cIt\u2019s many years until the next [World Cup] and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll make it. Finishing this way is nice.\u201d\n\nSo this is goodbye as far as Argentina is concerned. Still, what a way to go. It is not done yet: the greatest game of all awaits. It is colossal, of course. But even getting there felt a little like something had been won, like some realisation had been reached. By Messi and about Messi. You don\u2019t know what you have got until it\u2019s (almost) gone. Late at the Lusail Stadium, one Argentinian television reporter down on Level 0 chose not to ask her final question. Instead, and you may have seen the clip by now, she used it to give thanks: \u201cWhatever the result, you have made people happy,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have made an impact on everyone\u2019s life.\u201d\nEventually, he made himself happy too, with more than a little help from new friends and old. At the end of the 2016 Copa Am\u00e9rica, defeated by Chile in the final, he had walked away. He had not always felt embraced, the weight overwhelming; he said he came to feel that everything was his fault. As it was put to him here: \u201cYou had to eat a lot of shit.\u201d Yes, he conceded, but it\u2019s different now. \u201cFor a while now I\u2019ve been enjoying it so much, everything that\u2019s happening to us. Being able to end all this in the final makes me happy.\u201d\n\nThis has been the doctrine of the manager, Lionel Scaloni: the sun will rise tomorrow. Messi has embraced that message and the time he has left; it has become his message too, and there has been a sense of his teammates being invested not just in Argentina\u2019s success but his happiness, in doing some sort of justice.\n\u201cPeople have understood that this is something we have to enjoy,\u201d Messi said. \u201cWe did extraordinary things: the Copa Am\u00e9rica, the 36 games unbeaten, a World Cup final. Obviously, we all want to win it but it\u2019s a football match and anything can happen. Hopefully, this will be different to Brazil [in 2014, when they lost against Germany]. I don\u2019t know if this is my best World Cup, but I\u2019ve been enjoying it since we got here.\u201d\nIn Qatar he has five goals and three assists. The stellar moments here are his. The goal against Mexico and the goal against Australia, so very Messi both of them, seen a thousand times if not quite like this. The absurd assist against Croatia, instant iconography: Josko Gvardiol, the defender everyone was talking about, turned inside out and back again, hips snapped, legs tied in a cartoon knot.\nMessi leads the tournament stats in goals, assists, chances created, dribbles and fouls suffered. Which still hasn\u2019t stopped him. He has played every minute. He has been Maradonian. He has been Maradonaing, in fact. And that\u2019s not just about the excellence; there\u2019s the energy, the expression of commitment, identification. The sacrifice. Messi had been holding his hamstring for a long time, then he did that to Gvardiol. It is about the absolute refusal to let go: he was the one declaring that this wasn\u2019t done after the Saudi Arabia defeat. The leadership, pulling them through. There may be no moment of skill like the semi-final, but that doesn\u2019t compare to the release of his goal against Mexico.\n\nThere was the flash of anger which preceded the goal against Australia. The confrontations against the Netherlands. The edge, the aggression, the shithousery if you like. The: what you looking at, fool? Argentina\u2019s fans have loved that. Messi seems to have, too. \u201cHe\u2019s always been like that,\u201d Scaloni insists, and there is a fierce, furious competitor in him, but the fact that the coach had to say so was instructive. They have never felt him so close, nor has he felt them like this. This is not just a competition, it is a cause. A rebellion.\n\u201cSometimes it\u2019s an extreme situation, it\u2019s not easy to go out on to the pitch knowing that you have to win and if not you\u2019re going home. We have been doing that since the second game. That has a very big mental cost, and the group has overcome that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have played five \u2018finals\u2019 and we have one more.\u201d\nIt would be wrong to forget how he pulled them towards finals before, but this is something else again. He looks different, sounds different, acts different. Not least because it is a different generation on the journey with him, his role shifting, some of the weight of the past relieved, left behind. Yet there is legacy too, Scaloni says, in what he leaves them. They, in turn, have been desperate to leave him this one last dance.\n\u201cWhat he did in the Copa Am\u00e9rica was incredible but I have never seen anything like this World Cup in my life,\u201d the goalkeeper Emiliano Mart\u00ednez said. Cristian Romero added: \u201cIt\u2019s madness. Everyone knows what he is as a player but it\u2019s the kind of person he is. He\u2019s an example, a guy who always wants more. He has taken so many hits but he always gets back up again.\u201d\n\nOver the past few days, a photo has done the rounds: in it, an 11\u2011year\u2011old Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez stands alongside his idol, Lionel Messi. He now has another one 11 years on: teammates this time, Messi holds him in a headlock and beams after the Manchester City striker scored against Croatia.\n\u201cThe things Leo can do are incredible,\u201d he said, and he had seen that first hand, there to finish off an impossible assist, the best of the competition. Except perhaps for the one Messi gave to Nahuel Molina in the previous round.\nMessi had provided that pass and the tackle-pass which released \u00c1lvarez, running and bundling through, to score the second. It was Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez meanwhile who had delivered the ball that led to Messi scoring the first, via the penalty spot. And he too had grown up watching the man who gave Argentina the lead, who grabbed them and pulled them to a second World Cup final, much like Maradona.\nIn 2016, when Messi was contemplating walking away, Fern\u00e1ndez posted a message on Facebook which signed off saying sorry and thank you. It ran: \u201cHow are we, a bunch of nobodies who don\u2019t live with 1% of the pressure you do, 40 million people making ridiculous demands of perfection when we don\u2019t even know you, going to try to convince you? Do what you want but think about staying and enjoying it.\u201d\nNow at last he is, the time of his life and theirs carrying all of us to a final farewell."

Having long referred to their team by the C-word in their internal and external communications, the powers that be at FAW HQ have decided they might follow the lead of T\u00fcrkiye in renaming themselves for future tournaments. \u201cThe team should always be called Cymru, that\u2019s what we call it here,\u201d said their head honcho Noel Mooney, an Irishman who is working towards fluency in Welsh. \u201cOur view at the moment is that domestically we\u2019re clearly called Cymru. That\u2019s what we call our national teams. If you look at our website, how we talk about ourselves, we are very much Cymru.\u201d While any prospective change will not be undertaken without consultation with different stakeholders including but not limited to the Welsh Assembly and Uefa, it seems a natural next step for a national football team and fanbase that are currently having the time of their lives and have recently embraced Dafydd Iwan\u2019s spine-tingling Welsh language folk song Yma O Hyd as their unofficial pre-match anthem. There would, of course, be other, alphabetical benefits when it comes to the Cymru delegation\u2019s seating arrangements at the draws for major tournaments. \u201cWe sit by the Ukrainians all the time and that\u2019s nice because we\u2019ve become good friends with them,\u201d said Mooney. \u201cBut we would like to sit by the Croatians and the Czechs a bit more.\u201d Of course they would also be sitting in close proximity to Belgium, whose midfielder Kevin De Bruyne will surely welcome the mooted name-change after stating last month that he is \u201cbored\u201d with constantly having to play Wales. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cEver since I left France, you have nothing to talk about. France needs me, I don\u2019t need France. Even if you have Mbapp\u00e9, Neymar and Messi, it doesn\u2019t help you because you don\u2019t have God\u201d \u2013 who else but Zlatan Ibrahimovic?  RECOMMENDED LISTENING Football Weekly is here! The podders chat about another rough weekend for J\u00fcrgen Klopp, Mikel Arteta\u2019s high-flying Gunners and a 4-4 draw at the Valley. FIVER LETTERS \u201cArsenal are top of the table after 12 games. Erling Haaland does not score. Liverpool lose at home \u2026 to Leeds. Chelsea lose 4-1 to \u2026 Brighton. I can safely say that I do not understand football anymore. All that is left is for Qatar to win the HRWC\u201d \u2013 Krishna Moorthy. \u201cGiven the first instalment gave us a thrashing, a tactical mishap, blistering hot schadenfreude, a memorable quote and thus so many talking points, there is only one way to refer to the matchups of Graham Potter\u2019s Chelsea and some bloke\u2019s Brighton, from now on: El Guardianistico\u201d \u2013 Jon Millard. \u201cBravo! I wanted to echo fully the letter contents from Jason Palivoda (Friday\u2019s letters) \u2013 actually with interest given the appalling skullduggery of even staging a winter World Cup \u2013 and I won\u2019t be troubling the viewership statistics at all. A proper winter break lies ahead for some of us punters\u201d \u2013 Mike Cornwell. \u201cThanks for giving us a sight on Friday of what seems to be a large-scale ceramic representation of the World Cup mascot. It looks like an especially ugly giant ashtray with the boiled head of one of the Ninja Turtles attached, a combination all but defeats any attempt to find a useful allegory for it. I suppose we could go for what happens when you match up crass avarice with cynical manipulation, but that might be unfair to tobacco manufacturers and children\u2019s toy-makers\u201d \u2013 Charles Antaki.

                    "body": "Welcome to Moving the Goalposts, the Guardian\u2019s free women\u2019s football newsletter. Here\u2019s an extract from this week\u2019s edition. To receive the full version once a week, just pop your email in below:  In October Sophia Smith sat in front of the gathered media in Washington DC and calmly outlined her ambition: to become the best player in the world. It is quite a claim but then she had already had a pretty good year: She was the 2022 NWSL MVP (the youngest ever), was awarded the same accolade for the season\u2019s final, which her club Portland Thorns won, and scored in the final. The goal \u2013 in the fourth minute \u2013 was celebrated with a shrug, which went viral. What was it for? The critics. Smith said there had been people who didn\u2019t feel she deserved being the league MVP. She added: \u201cAnd that\u2019s that.\u201d When we catch up with the rising star of the USWNT she is in relaxed mood but reiterates that her drive to become the world\u2019s No 1 is as much about having the right mentality as it is about any end point. The goal, to some extent, is the point. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a constant grind and getting better,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s an end goal in what that looks like. But I think it\u2019s just putting myself in an environment every day where I know I\u2019m going to be challenged and I\u2019m going to get better and grow. Not only just as a player, but a person as well.\u201d To achieve that mindset, she says she needs to be constantly challenged: \u201cI know that I need someone to push me. I need someone to have very high standards for me. Even if I don\u2019t like to hear certain things, or get frustrated, ultimately I understand that that\u2019s what\u2019s helping me get better and what\u2019s helping me grow.\u201d  The success of women\u2019s football has been hard to ignore in 2022 and Smith is excited about that growth. Reflecting on the upward trajectory of the game, she is keen to mention the women that laid the foundation for her: \u201cI\u2019m lucky enough to have grown up with NWSL as a career and a goal to have. I know a lot of players before me didn\u2019t have that. \u201cThroughout my career there\u2019s been so much growth in the investment of women\u2019s soccer. I think people are finally starting to realise that if you pay attention, and if you put the game on a channel where people can watch it easily like the men\u2019s \u2026 and if you invest, and if you take the time, it\u2019s a really amazing sport and people want to watch, and people care about it.\u201d Like a few USWNT stars before her, Smith rose through the ranks at Stanford University and helped them to the championship title in 2019 before being the No 1 pick in the 2020 NWSL draft. Smith\u2019s growth with Thorns has been steady since then, something she credits to the legends and veterans she plays with. That\u2019s a list that includes Canadian powerhouse Christine Sinclair, who Smith says is one of the best goalscorers of all time. Smith was also among the first of the new generation\u2019s stars to break into the USWNT. When Vlatko Andonovski began to transition eras in earnest this year, she was the first to break into the lineup and has been the coach\u2019s go-to on the wing since then. She is very likely to be found playing there in the World Cup next year. She has some advice to aspiring footballers, based on how she handles the hard work it takes to keep progressing: \u201cThe main thing is you have to love it. I don\u2019t think you will get too far if you don\u2019t genuinely love the game. Because you know as a career, it\u2019s fun, but it\u2019s also a grind.\u201d She adds: \u201cSo I say to have fun and enjoy it. But also you have to do the work. You have to do work when nobody\u2019s watching and put the time and put the effort into it. Because women\u2019s soccer is growing, and it\u2019s becoming harder and harder to be great. And I think that\u2019s great, but I also think it\u2019s important for people to know that you have to put in the work and you have to truly care about what you\u2019re doing.\u201d  Smith is currently resting and enjoying time with her boyfriend, reflecting on a successful year with the Thorns. But everything from here forward, she says, is about the World Cup. It\u2019s always on her mind, and watching the men\u2019s tournament now has her even more excited: \u201cHonestly, everything I do is for that, to make that roster and to contribute to that team. I think we started preparing for the World Cup a long time ago. Now it\u2019s just getting closer and closer. \u201cEverything \u2013 how we train, how we recover \u2013 you know, everything goes into our preparation for that World Cup. It\u2019s definitely something that I\u2019m constantly thinking about. But also, I\u2019m just so excited. If I get the chance to represent this country, that would be a dream come true.\u201d Talking points Statistics: This month the stats website Fbref said it was expanding its data reporting service to include a vast array of women\u2019s football competitions. The announcement includes 19 total new competitions, eight of which are women\u2019s leagues, as well as both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s World Cups. Their service provides data on everything from xG and shot-creating actions to data on passing and ball progression. Women\u2019s Champions League: The group stage picked up again last week. Now halfway through, Chelsea, Wolfsburg, Barcelona and Arsenal sit atop their respective groups. Chelsea lead their section by the widest margin, with three wins, 11 goals scored and none conceded.  Injury research: Beth Mead\u2019s recent ACL injury has sparked renewed calls for more substantial research and support regarding this devastating injury in women\u2019s sport. Global stars such as Marie-Antoinette Katoto and Alexia Putellas as well as younger rising talents such as Catarina Macario and Ellie Carpenter are currently sidelined with the injury, which affects women six times more often than it does men. Quote of the week \u201cThe greatest moment in Canadian soccer is hands down #CANWNT winning the Olympic gold medal. There is no debate about that. Differentiating between Canadian men\u2019s and women\u2019s soccer is also imperative\u201d \u2013 the CBC journalist Shireen Ahmed, in response to a pundit\u2019s claim that Alphonso Davies\u2019s World Cup goal in defeat against Croatia was the greatest moment in the country\u2019s football history. Recommended viewing Chelsea\u2019s 11th goal in this year\u2019s Champions League group stage came from Erin Cuthbert. Her 75th-minute strike from the wing made it 2-0 against Real Madrid \u2013 although it may have been more of a cross. Got a question for our writers \u2013 or want to suggest a topic to cover?

                    "body": "1) Grealish giving City extra dimension Jack Grealish had Pep Guardiola positively purring after an effervescent and relentless performance of attacking play in Wednesday\u2019s 2-0 Carabao Cup win over Chelsea. For this observer it was by far the 27-year-old\u2019s finest outing in Manchester City colours as he menaced Graham Potter\u2019s visitors at will, both from his wide left zone and through more central areas. Afterwards, Guardiola said: \u201cI want Jack to have the responsibility, to play with Kevin [De Bruyne] with Phil [Foden]. I want Jack to get the ball to attack the back line. We talk to him \u2013 that the first intention is to score a goal. And today the body language is that the first intention is to score a goal and after to pass. He was exceptional again, Jack is playing really good.\u201d The winger seemed, at last, to remember how brilliant he can be, how his blend of dribbling, pace, trickery, power and athleticism can take him past most opponents and give City \u2013 and England at the World Cup \u2013 a different and breathtaking dimension. Brentford should beware. Jamie Jackson  Manchester City v Brentford, Saturday 12.30pm (all times GMT)  2) Howe shows patience needed for Potter Chelsea arrive on Tyneside without a win in their last four league games and sitting seventh, six points behind third-placed Newcastle. It means this has become much more than a mere beauty contest between two potential successors to Gareth Southgate as England manager. While Eddie Howe can reinforce Newcastle\u2019s Champions League credentials, Graham Potter hopes to reassure anxious Chelsea fans. He may well succeed in doing so but, even if he doesn\u2019t, Howe\u2019s example underscores the importance of patience. It was a year ago last Tuesday that the former Bournemouth manager succeeded Steve Bruce at St James\u2019 Park but Howe started slowly, so slowly indeed that by the time Newcastle visited Leeds on 22 January he had presided over only one win. Like Howe, Potter wants to change Chelsea\u2019s playing style but first he, too, needs to pass through a pain barrier. \u201cIf you want to do something properly you sometimes have to fail first,\u201d said the former Brighton manager this week. As Brighton fans would doubtless tell their Chelsea counterparts, it will surely be worth it in the end. Just look at Howe and Newcastle. Back in January some impatient fans wanted him sacked. Louise Taylor  Newcastle v Chelsea, Saturday 5.30pm   3) A new manager bounce at Anfield? Liverpool were stung by the element of surprise when they last hosted a team with a newly appointed manager. After the 3-3 draw with Brighton in Roberto De Zerbi\u2019s first match in charge in October, J\u00fcrgen Klopp admitted \u201cWe had no idea what they would do,\u201d until adapting at two goals down. He also conceded that Liverpool were suffering a crisis of confidence having dropped points for the fifth time in seven league games. They should be better prepared when Nathan Jones makes his bow as Southampton manager. First, the former Luton and Stoke manager has had little preparation time for the trip to Merseyside, having been officially installed on Thursday \u2013 a recovery day for players involved in the Carabao Cup shootout win over Sheffield Wednesday \u2013 before travelling north on Friday. More important for Klopp, confidence should not be an issue after Liverpool\u2019s impressive win at Tottenham last weekend. It is imperative his team build on that result if they want a more relaxing World Cup break. Andy Hunter  Liverpool v Southampton, Saturday 3pm  4) More of Marsch\u2019s strange alchemy? This will be Leeds\u2019 first meeting with Tottenham since the 4-0 loss in February which proved to be Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s final game in charge at Elland Road. Jesse Marsch has been attempting to step out of his predecessor\u2019s long shadow ever since, though how a man sat on an upturned bucket can cast a long shadow is open to question. Despite defeat for a much-changed side in the Carabao Cup in midweek, Leeds travel to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on a relative high after back-to-back league wins against Liverpool and Bournemouth. They still lack that enigmatic, intangible magic that Bielsa extracted from the team at his best but, if they can win three straight league fixtures for the first time in Marsch\u2019s tenure, it will go some way towards showing that the American has his own strange alchemy. With three defeats in five in the league, and no clean sheet in seven in all competitions, Spurs look vulnerable. Will Magee  Tottenham v Leeds, Saturday 3pm   5) Lopetegui keeps it in the family Julen Lopetegui will take in Wolves\u2019 game at home to Arsenal on Saturday evening before officially starting work at Compton Park on Monday. Lopetegui will be joined by his long-serving assistant Pablo Lanz and Edu Rubio, most recently West Ham Women\u2019s assistant coach, as first-team coach. Lopetegui has brought six staff with him to Molineux in total, including his son, Daniel, a performance analyst who studied football business and finance at the University Campus of Football Business at Wembley before working on opposition analysis at MK Dons. A family business? Across the West Midlands, Steve Bruce appointed his son Alex to his staff at West Brom and Lopetegui\u2019s predecessor, Bruno Lage, appointed his brother, Lu\u00eds Nascimento, to his staff upon taking charge last year. Ben Fisher  Wolves v Arsenal, Saturday 7.45pm  6) Eyes on Welbeck and Seagulls\u2019 strikers \u201cIf we want a striker as good as Danny Welbeck then we need to spend \u00a380m-90m in my opinion in the English market. They don\u2019t exist, they\u2019re not out there,\u201d Adam Lallana said after criticism of Brighton\u2019s lack of goals. He was defending his teammate, who does a lot of work in the final third without reward, although his valuation of an striker who is almost 32 and yet to score a league goal this season was just a tad generous. Lallana pointed out the team need to do better as a whole and Brighton did have three different goalscorers last weekend. There is plenty of one-touch play inside the opposition box, something Wolves were unable to cope with. Should they carry on playing with that level of speed and composure, Welbeck will inevitably get on the end of a chance, boosted by the penalty he scored at Arsenal in the Carabao Cup. De Zerbi does not mind his striker not scoring while those around him do but, for Welbeck\u2019s own confidence, he will want to get in on the act. Will Unwin  Brighton v Aston Villa, Sunday 2pm   7) Test for Ten Hag on the Thames There is no guarantee that Manchester United are going to bounce back from last Sunday\u2019s capitulation at Villa Park. Fulham are in good form and were unlucky to lose to Manchester City. Marco Silva has put a clever team together and Fulham\u2019s attack is capable of causing problems for anyone. It will not be easy for United. They have made progress under Erik ten Hag, but still have plenty of room for improvement. The defence can be exploited, the midfield can still be overrun and Ten Hag was unhappy with how reliant United were on crossing during their league defeat to Villa. \u201cI think it was stupid to do that,\u201d the Dutchman said. Ten Hag wants to see more thought and care from his players. But will United resist the urge to fling crosses in the general direction of Cristiano Ronaldo if they have to chase the game at Craven Cottage? Jacob Steinberg  Fulham v Manchester United, Sunday 4.30pm  8) Gibbs-White a perfect 10 for Forest? There\u2019s been plenty of tinkering in the Forest ranks in recent weeks while Steve Cooper tries to nail down a starting XI. Against Brentford one beneficiary of the changes was Morgan Gibbs-White. The forward was chased by Cooper for most of the summer but he had yet to get the best out of the former Wolves man. He scored his first goal for his new club on Saturday thanks to clever feet and a perfectly directed shot from the edge of the area. In addition to his goal, Gibbs-White was at the centre of all of Forest\u2019s best moments from the No 10 role behind Emmanuel Dennis and Brennan Johnson. Gibbs-White had previously spent more time out wide this season but Cooper might finally have found the role to make the most of Forest\u2019s record signing\u2019s attributes. Now he must prove he can do it consistently in the Premier League. WU  Nottingham Forest v Crystal Palace, Saturday 3pm  9) A meeting of Qatar-bound teammates James Maddison should be buzzing. The Leicester midfielder\u2019s international exile is over and he is going to the World Cup. Gareth Southgate has included him in England\u2019s 26-man squad for Qatar and Maddison will hope to sign off from domestic duty by helping Leicester beat West Ham. Standing in his way, though, will be an international teammate: Declan Rice. This is a huge game for West Ham\u2019s captain. David Moyes\u2019s side are two points above the bottom three after stinking the place out against Crystal Palace last weekend and they could do with an inspirational midfield display from Rice when they host Leicester. The pressure is on. The London Stadium was an impatient place when West Ham lost to Palace, so there is a responsibility on Rice to lift the mood. That will depend on whether the midfielder can pin down Maddison and stop him making chances for Leicester\u2019s forwards. JS  West Ham v Leicester, Saturday 3pm   10) O\u2019Neil to go out with bang? This could be Gary O\u2019Neil\u2019s final game in charge of Bournemouth. Everything started so brightly thanks to a run of six games unbeaten at the beginning of his tenure, but three straight Premier League losses have damaged his chances of getting the job on a permanent basis. Saturday\u2019s opponents, Everton, were hammered 4-1 at the Vitality Stadium in the League Cup in midweek to give Bournemouth great confidence going into this fixture. The players will want to give it everything in one last push for the interim manager; he has given them hope of staying up. Without O\u2019Neil the season could be over; he took charge after the 9-0 humiliation at Liverpool but managed to pick the players back up and help create a side capable of competing in the top flight, something Scott Parker had failed at. Whether O\u2019Neil stays or goes, he can be proud of what he has achieved in his first managerial role. WU  Bournemouth v Everton, Saturday 3pm  "

                    "body": "On a grisly, awkward night in S\u00e3o Paulo eight years ago Louis van Gaal could pick from a list of regrets. There was the fact Lionel Messi had been rationed to scraps in a game almost bereft of clear chances; he could reflect that, when one did arrive, Javier Mascherano slid in with Arjen Robben poised to score; then came a shootout and, with it, the kicker.\nVan Gaal had made all his substitutions by the time penalties seemed nailed on and could not bring on Tim Krul, who had successfully been deployed for exactly that purpose against Costa Rica. Instead, Jasper Cillessen was powerless to prevent Argentina scoring four times while Ron Vlaar and Wesley Sneijder fluffed their lines. A place in the final slipped away. \u201cI don\u2019t like to think about it,\u201d Van Gaal said this week.\nIt means the Netherlands\u2019 most recent memory of a glittering, glorious fixture is that of an achingly painful slog but Van Gaal has a chance to send those demons packing on Friday. Moreover, he does not mind who knows it. \u201cWe have a score to settle,\u201d he said after both teams had passed their last-16 assignments.\n\nThe statement was typically brusque and perhaps an insight into the reasons why the 71-year-old agreed to return for a third tenure last year. He will be replaced by Ronald Koeman in 2023: this is one last crack at the ultimate prize and the sense is he sees no value in playing things down.\nA case in point lay in the marvellously executed first goal against the USA, which was scored by Memphis Depay after a scintillating move. \u201cThat was a team goal, that transcends everything,\u201d Van Gaal said. \u201cIt was the best moment of this World Cup so far, really a super goal.\u201d He had bristled about the lavish praise of Brazil\u2019s attacking masterclass against South Korea, refusing to let his own side\u2019s accomplishments be swept away.\n\nVan Gaal knows what he is doing. The Netherlands are at their best when confident, a touch swaggery, grace and guile underpinned by steely edges. Eight of his squad are 23 or under and the same number have fewer than 10 caps; the respective figures for Argentina are four and three. A relatively callow group needs its hype man: someone who can deliver home truths but can, in the end, convince them their moments of brilliance are more enduring than mere flashes.\nThey have not attracted significant attention at this tournament, certainly by the standard of traditional powers, but Van Gaal wants them puffing out their chests. He has launched into the spirit of things, going viral for his dancing skills in a video of the celebratory reception that greeted the squad at their hotel on Saturday evening. Every Netherlands player facing the media this week has mentioned an extraordinary atmosphere wrought by Van Gaal since his comeback. It is usually easy to tell when footballers are trotting out a line but none of it sounds affected.\n\n\u201cThe togetherness of the team we have is special,\u201d Virgil van Dijk said on Wednesday, trading jokes with the goalkeeper Andries Noppert in between questions as if to prove the point. Far gone are the days when Dutch egos collided on the pitch or during dinner. They have a Barcelona star in Depay and one of Europe\u2019s most wanted talents in Cody Gakpo, but Van Gaal, who would never stand for nonsense in any case, has moulded a unit where nobody believes exceptions should be made for them.\nVan Dijk opted against biting on an invitation to play up a quarter-final against Argentina: such rhetoric is clearly best left to his manager. But there is no escaping the fixture\u2019s piquancy: it stretches back to 1974 and a masterful Cruyff-inspired 4-0 win during the second group stage, which led to the admiring \u201cNaranja Mecanica\u201d epithet in their opponents\u2019 country. That was dismantled in the 1978 final against a disturbing, sinister backdrop in Buenos Aires but the sheen returned when Dennis Bergkamp held the world agog with his last-eight winner in 1998.\n\u201cYou get brought up with it,\u201d Nathan Ak\u00e9 said of a goal that has stood the test of time. \u201cIt\u2019s with you, and we want to create those memories as well.\u201d\n\nTo have a chance of doing that Ak\u00e9, Van Dijk and company will almost certainly have to stop Messi again. Vlaar had the game of his life in helping subdue the world\u2019s best player in Brazil but in a cruel twist it counted for nothing.\nPerhaps it will be a goalkeeper who washes away the lingeringanguish Van Gaal harbours. Noppert, the Heerenveen player who has played only 54 senior matches at the age of 28, sounded breezy on the subject of facing a Messi penalty. \u201cI\u2019m always ready for that,\u201d he said. \u201cHe can also miss, we\u2019ve seen it in a game in this tournament [against Poland]. He\u2019s like us, he\u2019s human. For sure he\u2019s good, but of course I can save penalties.\u201d\nThe confidence Van Gaal has instilled was there in a nutshell. He will soon discover whether it is enough to light up one of international football\u2019s most compelling rivalries once again."

                    "body": "The weird thing about Jude Bellingham, the teenage sensation establishing himself as one of the best footballers in the world, is that there was nothing surprising about the way he ran the game for England when they demolished Senegal in the last 16 of the World Cup on Sunday night.\nThere are no limits to the England midfielder\u2019s prodigious talent. The 19-year-old from Stourbridge has the cockiness of Paul Gascoigne at Italia 90, the audacity of Michael Owen at the 1998 World Cup and the explosiveness of an 18-year-old Wayne Rooney at Euro 2004. Resistance is futile, even for those around the Borussia Dortmund star. \u201cI don\u2019t want to big up Jude Bellingham too much because he\u2019s still young, but he\u2019s one of the most gifted players I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Phil Foden said, trying and failing to play it cool as he discussed his teammate after the win against Senegal. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be the best midfielder in the world.\u201d\nToo much? Unlikely. Bellingham, who joined Birmingham City\u2019s academy when he was eight, has been destined for the top ever since he started playing football. His former coaches talk of a talent who was clearly head and shoulders above the other boys. \u201cYou\u2019d see him playing and you\u2019d say: \u2018Yeah, that kid\u2019s definitely got it,\u2019\u201d Phil Wooldridge told the BBC last month. \u201cSince then he\u2019s absolutely blossomed.\u201d\n\nBellingham was four when he was introduced to Wooldridge, who ran a company called PSI Sports. He joined in during children\u2019s games run by Wooldridge and, so the story goes, ended up on the winning side most of the time. \u201cHe just excelled,\u201d Wooldridge said.\nIt was clear that bigger tests were required. Bellingham\u2019s father, Mark, a sergeant with West Midlands police and a prolific striker at amateur level, worked with Wooldridge on creating a youth team called Stourbridge Juniors. The progress was rapid. At Birmingham an academy coach, Mike Dodds, told Bellingham that he could be a new type of midfielder: a No 22. Why? \u201cYou can be a No 4, a No 8 and No 10,\u201d Dodds said. \u201cSomeone who can do it all.\u201d\nBirmingham knew something special was happening. Bellingham became the club\u2019s youngest player when he made his debut aged 16 years and 38 days, breaking a record held for 49 years by Trevor Francis. He played 44 times during his first year as a professional and did not look out of place. Bigger clubs came calling. Manchester United wanted Bellingham, but he was intrigued by the thought of joining Dortmund. Plenty of young English talents had thrived after moving to Germany. It was the perfect breeding ground, particularly as Bellingham had already seen Jadon Sancho flourish after swapping Manchester City for Dortmund.\n\n\u201cThe way they integrate young players into the first-team squad is next level,\u201d Bellingham told the Guardian after joining Dortmund for an initial \u00a325m in the summer of 2020.\nBellingham was soon taking the Bundesliga by storm. The bemusement that greeted Birmingham\u2019s decision to retire the No 22 shirt has faded. Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City and Real Madrid will try to sign Bellingham in the summer. Europe\u2019s elite have all seen him dominate Champions League games for Dortmund, who know that an asking price of more than \u00a3100m is unlikely to deter suitors.\nWhoever signs Bellingham will be getting a player with an elite mentality. He is possessed with eerie levels of self-belief. The Dortmund manager, Edin Terzic, calls Bellingham \u201cthe oldest 19-year-old I have ever seen\u201d. England\u2019s head coach, Gareth Southgate, talks about a kid who wants to start every game, take all the corners and captain the side.\nIt was not enough for Bellingham to become the youngest player of any nationality to feature during a European Championship when, aged 17 years and 349 days, he came off the bench during England\u2019s victory over Croatia at Euro 2020.\nSince then he has established himself as a key starter for Southgate\u2019s side. He was outstanding when England beat Iran in their first game at the World Cup, opening the scoring with a beautiful header, but he was even better against Senegal. It was Bellingham who carried England when they went through a rocky period during the first half against the African champions. He whipped up the fans, urging them to make more noise. He won back possession. Eventually Bellingham drove through the Senegal defence and calmed England\u2019s nerves by setting up the opening goal for Jordan Henderson.\n\nIt was ridiculous. At one stage Bellingham picked up Harry Kane and told the England captain to put a missed chance behind him. This is not normal teenage behaviour. English football loves its mavericks but Bellingham does not really fall into that category. He is on the path to superstardom but there is no sign of the fame going to his head. It is rare to see him lose his cool on the pitch. He focuses on making the team better and lets his talent create the headlines.\nPressure is something to embrace. Bellingham does not even accept the notion that it will be him versus the brilliant France forward Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 when England meet the world champions in the quarter-finals on Saturday. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just me and him going toe-to-toe,\u201d Bellingham said. \u201cIt\u2019s just about playing my role in the team and trying to win the game.\u201d\nHe makes it look and sound so simple."

                    "body": "Maddison makes it in\nNothing came as a bigger shock than the revelation that Gareth Southgate has bowed to the clamour to include James Maddison. England are not exactly in a position to overlook creative talents, but even people close to the Leicester playmaker were not expecting him to be in the squad. All the talk was about the doubts over Maddison\u2019s personality; he has not been involved and the sense was that infamous visit to the casino while he was meant to be on international duty in 2019 was going to count against him.\nBut there is no need for any outrage. Who said Southgate was too conservative? Maddison, whose only cap came three years ago, has made himself impossible to leave out. He has 22 goal involvements in 2022 (13 goals and nine assists) \u2013 a record bettered only by Harry Kane, Kevin De Bruyne and Son Heung-min \u2013 and is a huge threat from set pieces. The only question is whether he will be given a proper chance to solve England\u2019s lack of imagination in open play.\n\nRashford returns\nThere is no question that Marcus Rashford deserves his recall. The Manchester United forward has not played for England since his miss in the penalty shootout defeat by Italy in the Euro 2020 final, but he is over his injury problems and Southgate has never closed the door on him. England need a fit and focused Rashford. He boasts tournament experience, can fill roles on the left or through the middle and he is the third-highest goalscorer during the Southgate era. In a squad short of reliable finishers, it would have made no sense to leave out Rashford. He has been in good form for United and his willingness to run beyond defences could be helpful for Kane, who loves to drop deep and release his fellow forwards with clever through-balls.\nWilson edges out Toney and Abraham\nThe role of being Kane\u2019s deputy is not an enviable one. England\u2019s captain is a guaranteed starter and rarely comes off. All the same, the biggest fear for Southgate is losing Kane to injury. No striker has shown they are capable of filling in for the Spurs player. Tammy Abraham has been underwhelming for Roma this season, scoring only four goals, and has rarely impressed for England. As for Brentford\u2019s Ivan Toney, he failed to catch the eye in training after Southgate called him up for the first time in September.\nNeither Abraham nor Toney can have many complaints about being edged out by Callum Wilson. The former Bournemouth striker has been in fine form for Newcastle, who are third in the Premier League, and has deservedly returned to the fold. Wilson, whose last cap came in October 2019, leads the line well, has six goals this season, offers good movement and takes penalties well. What\u2019s not to like?\nDefensive concerns\nSouthgate has taken a few risks. An obvious dilemma is having Luke Shaw as the squad\u2019s only specialist left wing-back. Losing Ben Chilwell to a torn hamstring was a blow, but Southgate has decided that he can live with the versatile duo of Kieran Trippier and Bukayo Saka as cover for Shaw. Youngsters such as Crystal Palace\u2019s Tyrick Mitchell and Tottenham\u2019s Ryan Sessegnon had not quite done enough to fill the hole left by Chilwell.\nThe problem, though, is that Trippier is likely to start at right wing-back and Saka struggled when he started at left wing-back against Italy in September. Ultimately Southgate has had to compromise. Injuries are inevitable. He has also lost Reece James, who would have started at right wing-back, and has replaced the Chelsea defender with the Arsenal centre-back Ben White, who has been playing as a converted right-back this season.\nThe situation at the back is not ideal. The Manchester United centre-back Harry Maguire has started one league game since August, John Stones has been playing at right-back for City and Eric Dier\u2019s recent performances for Spurs have been iffy. Intriguingly though, Southgate has not crammed his squad with centre-backs. He has omitted Joe Gomez, Fikayo Tomori, Marc Gu\u00e9hi and Tyrone Mings, enabling him to name more attacking options.\n\nGallagher squeezes in\nOne of those players is Conor Gallagher. Southgate is often accused of picking on reputation rather than form, but selecting the Chelsea midfielder slightly squashes that narrative. The energetic, enterprising Gallagher has caught the eye in recent weeks. He had a slow start to the season and was left out by Southgate but he has flourished since Chelsea\u2019s appointment of Graham Potter, who has given the 22-year-old plenty of opportunities. Selecting him is bold. The pragmatic move would have been to pick Southampton\u2019s James Ward-Prowse.\nWalker and Phillips make it in\nAlthough Southgate explained that it would have been too much of a gamble to pick James, he has decided to take Kalvin Phillips and Kyle Walker. Phillips has made one substitute appearance for City since shoulder surgery in September; Walker, who had groin surgery last month, will not be ready when England face Iran in their opening game on 21 November. Yet both City players were considered too important for Southgate to leave out. Phillips impressed in midfield during the Euros and Walker\u2019s recovery speed makes him invaluable at the back."

                    "body": "Julen Lopetegui has had far more glamorous nights in the business but victory in his first game in charge of Wolves to advance to the quarter-finals of the Carabao Cup represented job done as they squeezed past fourth-tier Gillingham courtesy of goals by substitutes Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez and Rayan A\u00eft-Nouri.\nWolves cannot be too fussy about wins either, this just their fifth of the season, three of which have come in this competition. For long periods it seemed a game low on quality and clear-cut chances was destined to be decided by a penalty shootout but the League Two side pressed self-destruct late on, conceding a spot-kick which Jim\u00e9nez, making his first Wolves appearance since August, calmly converted before A\u00eft-Nouri sealed victory in stoppage time.\n\nLopetegui is a coach of great pedigree \u2013 hence Wolves\u2019 owners Fosun\u2019s delight at appointing him as head coach at the third time of asking \u2013 but his first game in charge was tantamount to an entry-level test. Nevertheless, Lopetegui recognised the awkwardness of the task, alluding to Gillingham\u2019s shock victory over Brentford in the previous round. \u201cThese kind of matches are difficult because you play against a team that has nothing to lose,\u201d he said afterwards. \u201cThese kind of matches are very difficult because sometimes you want to take shortcuts. This kind of opponent I think is very different to the one we are going to find in the next matches.\u201d\nWolves travel to Everton on Boxing Day before hosting Manchester United on New Year\u2019s Eve. By then they expect to have sealed a loan deal for the Atl\u00e9tico Madrid forward Matheus Cunha with an option to make the move permanent. The arrival of Cunha is set to be the first of several transfers Wolves hope to ratify before the window opens in January as they seek to move up the table. A new centre-back and right-back are thought to be other priorities next month.\n\nThese teams may be three divisions apart but both are propping up their respective league tables, Wolves the Premier League and Gillingham League Two. Gillingham, relegated last season, have not tasted victory in the league since October and set up to flummox a Wolves team for whom this season has also been utterly miserable. For Gillingham, attention quickly shifts to their Boxing Day date with Colchester, who are a place above them in the table. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest game of the season,\u201d said their manager, Neil Harris, who travelled separately to Molineux in an attempt to prevent the spread of a virus. \u201cWe\u2019ll be right at it. It\u2019s so important to maintain our league status.\u201d\nLopetegui was given a warm welcome before Wolves\u2019 defeat to Arsenal in November and before kick-off here the South Bank unveiled a striking tifo with the words \u2018Julen is a Wolf\u2019. Lopetegui expressed a wish to see evidence of almost seven weeks of preparation since taking charge but until R\u00faben Neves, fresh from Portugal\u2019s World Cup quarter-final exit, rattled a post with the last touch of a dull first half there was little to whet the appetite. Joe Hodge, who was replaced by Adama Traor\u00e9 at the interval, should have hit the target but headed wide unmarked inside the six-yard box.\nLopetegui urged calm as his players appeared strangled by expectation. Matheus Nunes, Hwang Hee-chan and Jim\u00e9nez, three more who were involved in Qatar, entered in the second half and the hosts slowly stirred. Wolves were gifted a path to victory when the Gillingham defender Cheye Alexander tugged at the shirt of Hwang inside the box with 14 minutes of normal time to play. Jim\u00e9nez stepped up to the penalty spot and stroked the ball into the corner to set Wolves en route to the next round before A\u00eft-Nouri capped the win. \u201cIt has been a very special day for me,\u201d Lopetegui said. \u201cToday [Tuesday] is the birthday of my father and today is my first match in Molineux.\u201d"

                    "body": "After the trophy had been presented, the medals collected, the glitter cannons fired, and the players\u2019 families beckoned on to the pitch, England returned to their dressing room and the focus shifted. \u201cThe one thing about our team is, when we work we work hard,\u201d Moeen Ali said. \u201cAnd when we\u2019re not working, we relax well as well.\u201d Moeen was one of seven members of the squad celebrating a second World Cup win. For their coach, Matthew Mott, it was a fourth. \u201cIf you could bottle that hour straight after the game and have that for the rest of your life, you\u2019d be pretty happy,\u201d Mott said. \u201cFor a lot of people, particularly after games like that, the relief is obvious. Once you get over that, it\u2019s just pure joy. There was a lot of pressure coming into the game and there was a big release after it. Everyone sat back and reflected a bit and then the music came out and the boys who wanted to party partied and we all had a lot of fun. This team knows how to celebrate well.\u201d  Pretty soon Jos Buttler was standing on a table, medal still hanging around his neck, playing air guitar on the trophy; within hours the International Cricket Council had taken the probably sensible decision to take it away and leave England with a replica. Through it all one man was in the centre of the action, the proverbial life and soul. After the group was asked to leave the MCG at 1.30am he was the one roaring up and down the aisle of the team coach as it returned them to their hotel, leading the singing. Once they arrived, before the players reconvened in a private room where the celebrations continued until 7am, he made sure that Mott made good on his promise to shave his head if England won the World Cup. Sam Curran has become a key figure in the England team over the last few months, culminating in him being named player of the match and of the tournament after they beat Pakistan in the final, and it turned out he had no intention of stopping just because the tournament had. \u201cHe loves the occasion,\u201d Moeen said. \u201cHe loves the big time.\u201d  Curran will become even harder to ignore in the coming days, assuming he fulfils his side of the bet with Mott and dyes his hair in a colour of the coach\u2019s choosing. But that kind of superficial change seems unnecessary when over the last two months he has already transformed the way people look at him. Curran made his T20 debut for England more than three years ago but, of all the games in which he has taken two or more wickets, 67% have come in the last two months, and of those where he has leaked fewer than seven runs an over 64% have come in the last two months. After spending a third of England\u2019s white-ball games this summer on the sidelines, as he heads into the winter he, unlike a drunkenly toted trophy, is all but undroppable. \u201cThere\u2019s no ceiling for him,\u201d Mott said. \u201cI think his batting has got more in it as well \u2013 he\u2019s one of the sweetest timers of the ball we\u2019ve got and he\u2019s a gun in the field as well. And aside from all the cricket stuff, his character around the group is really infectious. He\u2019s going to be a very, very good player for England and could go down as one of the white-ball greats in my opinion.\u201d Curran\u2019s improvement seems to have coincided with the pre-tournament trip to Pakistan, and a conversation there with Buttler. \u201cI think that trip really did me good,\u201d he said. \u201cComing back from injury to get six games out of seven gave me a lot of confidence. Jos sat me down to have a chat about where he sees my role, and it was just making sure I\u2019m available for all three phases of the game. Previously, I probably bowled a lot more in the powerplay.\u201d  Across the World Cup, Curran has been remarkably consistent in every phase of the game: two wickets in six overs in the powerplay (overs one to six), costing 6.42 an over; nine wickets in 10.4 overs at the death (overs 16-20), costing 6.56 an over; and two wickets in five overs in between, costing 6.60. The only real blip on his statistics is the single over in the semi-final against India from which Rishabh Pant and Hardik Pandya plundered 22. \u201cHe\u2019s that type of player where when it\u2019s a big occasion, I think he loves it and he thrives,\u201d says Moeen. \u201cOn the tour of Pakistan he bowled at the death a lot and it just felt like: \u2018This guy\u2019s got something about him.\u2019\u201d Now one of the things he has is a World Cup winner\u2019s medal. \u201cIn the last few weeks I actually chatted to a few of the boys who won it in 2019 and asked what it was like to win a World Cup,\u201d Curran says. \u201cThey said it gives you that buzz and how cool it is to say you\u2019ve won a World Cup. I\u2019m a bit lost for words but to know that I\u2019ve won a World Cup and been involved \u2013you get goosebumps, it\u2019s incredible.\u201d Most of these players have been on the road for more than two months already, their path to the World Cup so long that when they eventually return home Harry Brook will go to a new house and Tymal Mills will meet his new child. But nobody\u2019s life has changed during this tour quite as much as Sam Curran\u2019s."

                    "body": "Lionel Messi had seen something: not much but just enough to be everything. An hour had gone and Argentina had been unable to find a way through against Mexico when he approached and had a quiet word. Within a minute, by his teammate\u2019s calculations, he was approaching again. This time he was running, shouting, losing it, leaping into Di Mar\u00eda\u2019s arms, his shot having just flown into the Mexico net. He had hit it from exactly where he said he would. This was, he admitted, a \u201cgreat liberation\u201d.\n\u201cWe have overcome a difficult test,\u201d Messi said. \u201cAlthough we trusted in ourselves, in what we can do, at the hour of truth lots of things go through your mind and it can be difficult to isolate yourself from everything. But this group is ready. We have taken a very important step; now we have to take another one.\u201d\n\nDi Mar\u00eda was asked after the 2-0 victory whether he was claiming the assist for the goal that pulled Argentina back from the edge.\u201cWhat?!\u201d he replied. The alchemy, he insisted, came from Argentina\u2019s captain, and with a material more base than metal. \u201cI threw him a turd, but he always finds solutions to everything,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat matters is that the ball got to him.\u201d And Di Mar\u00eda insisted that too was down to Messi \u2013 although from the way he talked through how it happened his role was certainly significant.\n\nThere is a line that Jos\u00e9 Luis Mendilibar came up with to describe the Argentina captain: he \u201cparks\u201d better than anyone, the former Eibar coach says. He can look as if he is not doing anything, as if he has stopped, but although he may have pulled over he has not stopped. Instead, he is watching, calculating. This was one of those occasions.\n\u201cWe had spoken a minute before [the goal],\u201d Di Mar\u00eda said. \u201cHe said they were dropping deep, narrow, inside [the area] and so the space in front of them would appear, to try to give it to him there. I waited for that moment to appear and gave it to him. And he scored a tremendous goal. I don\u2019t have words any more. I have had the chance to play with the best player in the world at club level, and for 14 years with the national team, and for me Leo is everything.\n\u201cWe had planned this,\u201d Di Mar\u00eda continued at the end of a long, exhausting night. \u201cWe knew the first 45 minutes would be very complicated. Mexico knew a draw might be OK because their last game is against Saudi Arabia and they could get their win there. We knew the second half would open up, and that\u2019s the way it was.\u201d\n\nIn the tension of Lusail, it didn\u2019t feel so certain. \u201cIn the first half we were trying to do things too fast, hastily, especially me,\u201d Rodrigo de Paul said. \u201cAt half-time the manager said to be patient, to not put pressure on ourselves, the goal would come. In the second half we had the patience that Leo and the manager impress upon us a lot.\u201d Argentina had improved certainly, Messi becoming the starting point of many of their moves, and yet when he occupied that space and took aim after an hour it was their first shot on target.\n\u201cWe had gone 36 games without losing and that couldn\u2019t all be ruined because of just one game [the defeat against Saudi Arabia] but at the same time it\u2019s not easy,\u201d Messi said. \u201cYou come here, play a great team like Mexico, and in a situation when you\u2019re on edge, knowing that if you lose or even draw the situation is very complicated. For some of our players it\u2019s only their second World Cup game.\n\n\u201cThe first half was very tense, very hard to play. We were doing things too quickly, pressured, we didn\u2019t find the spaces because Mexico closed off like never before \u2013 generally they come out to play but today they closed up. We were moving the ball from side to side, trying to find space, but it wasn\u2019t easy.\n\u201cIn the second half we did find our football, we started to move, we started to find passes between the lines, which is our strength. The goal came and that changes the situation. We had to defend the three points and luckily Enzo [Fern\u00e1ndez] scored a great goal.\n\u201cHopefully we can be calmer in the next game and finally find our football, the way we have been playing for a long time. We always try to attack our opponents, play to win, no matter who our opponents are and this victory gives the tranquility now of knowing it\u2019s in our hands. We could even win the group if we win [against Poland].\n\n\u201cWe have to keep believing. The support and togetherness was spectacular \u2013 we knew it would be. There were lots of nerves and we were able to give a win to the people, who also suffer a lot. This group has shown that it is ready to fight and we could not throw it all away for one game. When we\u2019re all together, we can do great things.\u201d\n\nDe Paul took the opportunity to call for the remaining doubters to join the cause in what seemed like a message for the media back home. \u201cThe majority of people were always with us; I invite the few that weren\u2019t to climb back on board,\u201d the midfielder said, a little pointedly.\n\u201cNow we can start to enjoy the World Cup. These last three days we haven\u2019t done so. We were going over it all in our minds, but today we have pulled it off, got out of [trouble]. The fans identify with us, they have a lot of hope placed on us. The day we have to leave this cup we want the fans to think: \u2018They didn\u2019t have any more left to give.\u2019 We will give everything until we\u2019re empty.\u201d"

                    "body": "Australia have been dealt a huge blow ahead of their crucial World Cup qualifier against United Arab Emirates, with key midfielder Tom Rogic withdrawing from Graham Arnold\u2019s squad. With just over a week to go before the Socceroos\u2019 Asian playoff in Doha, Rogic notified Socceroos staff of his decision to pull out, citing personal reasons.  Without one of his most creative attacking players, Arnold is left with a selection headache, but Football Australia on Tuesday said the Socceroos would not be calling up a replacement. \u201cMy focus must now be on the players we have here in Qatar,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cWe have selected an extended squad of quality players and I believe that we will achieve something special for Australia over the next two weeks.\u201d Australia need to win next Wednesday\u2019s one-off game to keep alive their hopes of reaching a fifth straight World Cup at the end of the year. A final playoff of a long-winded qualification campaign against Peru awaits the winner the following week. Rogic is without a club after announcing he will end his nine-year association with Celtic following the club\u2019s Scottish Premiership title win under the guidance of Ange Postecoglou. Boosting Arnold\u2019s midfield options is the return to the squad of Aaron Mooy, who has not played a competitive game of football this year but has a chance to prove his fitness in a friendly against Jordan on Wednesday (Thursday morning AEST). Mooy has been one of several big names missing for the Socceroos as their qualification campaign derailed in recent international windows, when back-to-back defeats to Japan and Saudi Arabia dashed their hopes of automatic qualification for the tournament in Qatar."

                    "body": "The Peru playoff gave us Andrew Redmayne and the water bottle, and now the World Cup has provided another superb display of gamesmanship in the form of Denmark\u2019s travelling tactical notes.\nViewers watching the Socceroos\u2019 historic upset win from Australia in the early hours of Thursday morning would have missed out on some juicy footage broadcast on the world feed, which appears to show coach Graham Arnold and his staff learning of their opponents\u2019 mid-game strategy and then adjusting their own accordingly.\n\nIn was the 69th minute at Al Janoub Stadium when, with Australia 1-0 up, Denmark coach Kasper Hjulmand made two substitutions as they chased an equaliser that would have stopped the Socceroos progressing to the knockout stages.\nAs forwards Andreas Cornelius and Robert Skov are brought on, the footage shows Skov holding a piece of paper as he runs on to the pitch. He hands to captain Christian Eriksen, who can be seen reading the message before the camera cuts away.\n\nAt some point over the next couple of minutes, the note appears to have retrieved by a Socceroos player and taken to staff on the sideline.\nThe camera then cuts to Australia\u2019s dugout, where head of sports science, Andrew Clark, is holding the piece of paper and conferring with Arnold and his assistant, Ren\u00e9 Meulensteen.\n\u201cThe Danish note may have found its way to the Australian bench now,\u201d the commentator said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the pure football, getting the job done.\u201d\nAnother two minutes later Arnold withdraws attacking midfielder Riley McGree and replaces him with defender Bailey Wright, who slots in as the fifth man in a bolstered backline to weather a late attacking storm as Denmark chase an equaliser.\nA supporter who was present in the stands said he saw the sequence of events unfold.\n\u201cA note came out from the Danish manager around 70th min,\u201d tweeted Adam Jones. \u201cGets handed to Eriksen, who then hands it to Hojberg. Hojberg throws it on the ground, Mitch Duke runs over picks it up. Hands it to Arnie, who instantly tells Wright to start warming up.\u201d\nWhether it actually influenced Arnold\u2019s decisions remains unclear, with Football Australia staff insisting he would have made the same substitution regardless, having already predicted Denmark would bring on tall forwards if they needed a late goal.\n\n\u201cThey put a big striker on and had two strikers on, and I knew they would start hitting long balls,\u201d Arnold said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I put Bailey Wright on for a back five. Obviously it\u2019s going to push you deeper, but we needed that extra man centrally to help with dealing with the crosses and long balls.\u201d\n\nThe whole thing was reminiscent of Australia\u2019s famous penalty shootout win over Peru in June when Redmayne, brought on as a shock 119th-minute substitute, sabotaged the scheming of rival goalkeeper Pedro Gallese.\nGallese had notes scrawled on his water bottle to tell him which way each Australian penalty-taker tended to go, but midway through the shootout Redmayne could be seen lobbing the bottle over the advertising board.\nThe Sydney FC stopper, dubbed the \u201cgrey Wiggle\u201d for his unorthodox goal-line dancing, saved a crucial penalty to send the Socceroos to Qatar."

                    "body": "Two leading officials in Ukraine\u2019s football association, including its head, have been arrested over fraud and money-laundering allegations related to the construction of an artificial grass factory. Andriy Pavelko, the president of the Ukraine FA, and Yuri Zapisotsky, the association\u2019s general secretary, are accused of \u201cembezzling\u201d 26.5m Ukrainian Hryvnia (\u00a3600,000). The two men were ordered to be held in custody until 22 January to allow further investigation or be released on bail of \u00a3200,000 on condition that they do not leave Ukraine\u2019s capital, Kyiv, or contact witnesses. The development is likely to kill off a joint bid Ukraine has made with Spain and Portugal to co-host the 2030 World Cup in a move that had been sanctioned by the country\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Ukraine, which has been under full-scale invasion by Russia since 24 February, had been due to host one of the tournament\u2019s groups under the bid led by Pavelko. The allegations against Pavelko and Zapisotsky follow a four-year investigation into claims of overpayments made by the UFA to a company in the United Arab Emirates, known as SDT, that had been working with the national football body to build Ukraine\u2019s first artificial grass factory. The general prosecutor\u2019s office alleged: \u201cAccording to the investigation, during the purchase of equipment for the construction of a factory for the production of artificial surfaces for football fields, UAF officials seized UAH 26.5m. Later, they laundered part of these funds. \u201cAt the request of the prosecutors, the Pechersk district court of Kyiv ordered the suspects to be placed in custody with the alternative of bail in the amount of UAH 9.9m each.\u201d When the charges against the men were first reported last week, the Ukrainian FA had accused those investigating them of acting on behalf of pro-Russian politicians. Denys Bugai, a lawyer acting for the UAF, also told a local media outlet, Glavkom, that while there had been overpayments to SDT, the money had been reclaimed by the football body. The cash had not re-emerged on the UAF\u2019s balance sheet, he said, as it had been paid via a third company, Softex, to the former Italian referee Pierluigi Collina, who was a creditor. There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by Collina, who oversaw refereeing in Ukrainian football between 2012 and 2015. Rivals for the 2030 World Cup include Egypt, Greece and Saudi Arabia, and a South American proposal from Uruguay, Argentina, Paraguay and Chile. Last month the Uefa president, Aleksander Ceferin, said he believed Spain and Portugal would put together a \u201cwinning bid\u201d. Pavelko, who has led the Ukrainian FA since 2015, served as a member of Fifa\u2019s disciplinary body for two years up to 2020. According to Fifa, he resigned from their body after being ordered to pay a fine for \u201cpublicly criticising a decision\u201d taken by colleagues on the disciplinary committee at the World Cup in Russia."

The Euro 2020 finalists, who are certain to finish bottom of Group A3, have gone five games without a competitive win for the first time since 1992 and have not scored from open play for 450 minutes \u2013 their worst run in 22 years.\n\nThe statistics made it hard to accept Southgate calling the display against Italy \u201ca step in the right direction\u201d. The 52-year-old, who described the jeers from the travelling support at the San Siro as an \u201cunderstandable emotional reaction\u201d, insisted that England had simply not managed the fine margins well enough against opponents who have failed to qualify for the World Cup.\nHowever Southgate, who was also barracked by supporters after England lost 4-0 to Hungary in June, acknowledged that the situation is far from ideal as Qatar 2022 draws closer. Monday\u2019s Nations League match against Germany at Wembley is England\u2019s final outing before their World Cup opener against Iran and Southgate accepted that he is under increasing scrutiny.\n\u201cWe are where we are in terms of the timing, so we\u2019ve got to do the best we can in terms of keeping the guys on track,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cThe reaction to tonight will be guided by the result, but we weren\u2019t far off in terms of the performance. I\u2019ve got to keep the players believing in what they\u2019re doing.\n\u201cWe are in a run of bad results. It\u2019s for us to put that right. The only way to do that is to stick with what we believe, stick with what\u2019s got us success in previous tournaments, and in the end the players have got to stay really tight.\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of noise but that will be around me and that\u2019s absolutely fine. It\u2019s my job to take that pressure for them.\u201d England are one of two countries yet to score a non-penalty goal during this Nations League campaign, the other being San Marino, but Southgate maintained that he saw positive signs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult for me to be too critical of the performance,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had more possession, more shots, more shots on target. For large parts we played very well. We didn\u2019t deal with the decisive moment defensively and we had moments to be more decisive in their final third and our quality wasn\u2019t quite right.\n\u201cI thought there were a lot of positives tonight. A lot of good individual performances. I personally thought the performance was a step in the right direction but I perfectly understand that because of the result that\u2019s not going to be the reaction.\u201d\nDeclan Rice said that England will improve in attack. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing,\u201d the midfielder said. \u201cIn the Nations League we have slipped our standards. I did not think it was all bad tonight. We controlled the game and passed the ball around well. We just lacked that cutting edge. I see in training that there are goals for fun.

Stokes\u2019 unbeaten 52 off 49 balls was remarkable not for the speed at which he scored but for the pressure he was labouring under, with the 31-year-old again displaying the characteristics that convinced England\u2019s then captain, Eoin Morgan, to call him \u201csuperhuman\u201d after a similarly crucial contribution to England\u2019s success in the 2019 50-over World Cup final.\n\u201cHe\u2019s been there in those scenarios time and time again, he just has a lot of knowhow for how to do it,\u201d Buttler said. \u201cIt certainly wasn\u2019t his most fluent innings, he probably didn\u2019t time the ball as well as he can, but you knew he was never going to go down without a fight, and would stand up and be there at the end. He\u2019s a true match-winner, and we\u2019re immensely lucky to have him.\u201d\nStokes insisted that he did not deserve to be singled out for praise given the quality of England\u2019s bowling, particularly that of Sam Curran, who took three wickets for just 12 runs in his four overs, and Adil Rashid. \u201cIn finals, especially chasing, you forget all the hard work that came first,\u201d he said. \u201cTo restrict them to 137, the bowlers have to take a lot of credit. Sam has done it all tournament and Adil has turned up at the back end of the tournament when it really matters, and that was the best I\u2019ve seen him bowl for England in a T20. I\u2019m very proud \u2013 you don\u2019t get to win World Cups too often so to win two of them is pretty special.\u201d\nIt was England\u2019s ninth game against these opponents in less than two months and as Pakistan came to terms with their defeat it cannot have helped to hear Buttler say that it was while in their country in September that his World Cup-winning side truly came together after a difficult first few months under his captaincy. \u201cRelationships take time, and as you get to know people better and better, you build trust,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d say the Pakistan tour \u2013 for the group, not just myself and the coach but for everyone involved, just seemed like a really good tour.\n\n\u201cLots of bonds were built, and I thought we got back to playing some really good cricket there. It takes a bit of time to get to know people well and get to feel comfortable, and there\u2019s so much talent in the group that as soon as we feel comfortable we\u2019re a dangerous team.\u201d\nPakistan scored just 137 runs in their 20 overs but restricted England\u2019s scoring effectively to bring the contest back into the balance before their star bowler, Shaheen Afridi, sustained a potentially serious knee injury while fielding.\n\u201cIn the batting we were 20 runs short but the way the fast bowlers started, in the first six overs and the middle overs, we had a comeback,\u201d said Babar Azam, Pakistan\u2019s captain. \u201cAfter the Shaheen injury maybe the match went to England\u2019s side, but I am very happy with the way we performed.\u201d"

                    "body": "The mood at Tottenham is never far from turning sour and the restless natives made their feelings plain after an unhappy start to the new year brought a dispiriting home defeat. Aston Villa struck the first blow after a mistake from the returning Hugo Lloris, with Emiliano Buend\u00eda taking advantage, before Douglas Luiz finished off a sharp move to continue their progress under Unai Emery.\n\nSpurs supporters have never appeared to buy into Antonio Conte\u2019s pragmatic approach and this dismal loss \u2013 greeted by vociferous boos from the masses \u2013 will do little to quieten talk of a change of coach with the Italian\u2019s contract running only until the end of the season.\nTottenham\u2019s lack of attacking guile was starkly laid bare with Conte likely to need fresh ammunition in the January window if he is to guide them to another top-four finish. The joyous scenes elsewhere in north London, during Arsenal\u2019s ascent to the top of the table, has only -deepened the gloom surrounding Spurs after their fourth defeat in the past seven Premier League games.\nConte made four changes from the team that drew at Brentford, with Cristian Romero making his first appearance since his role in Argentina\u2019s World Cup triumph. Romero and Ben Davies returned to the defence with Eric Dier and Japhet Tanganga demoted to the bench. Lloris also made his first start since returning from France\u2019s run to the final in Qatar. Bryan Gil was handed his first league start and the influential winger Dejan Kulusevski, out with a muscle injury, was sorely missed.\n\nEmery selected the same team that lost at home to Liverpool on Boxing Day, with the World Cup winner Emiliano Mart\u00ednez on the bench and the goalkeeper Robin Olsen keeping his place after the maverick Argentinian returned to training on Friday.\nVilla created the first opportunity with a long ball releasing Ollie Watkins and the striker cut inside but dragged his low shot harmlessly wide. Spurs responded and their first sight of goal came from an unlikely source, Matt Doherty nutmegging Tyrone Mings, but the defender\u2019s effort was deflected out for a corner off Boubacar Kamara.\nTottenham were struggling to create openings, with Villa content to sit deep and frustrate. The game needed something to spark it into life and Romero\u2019s lunging tackle on Watkins resulted in a brief skirmish between the teams and a yellow card for the Spurs defender.\n\nVilla\u2019s gameplan appeared to be working effectively with the onus on Spurs to open them up and the home fans were starting to become impatient as the half progressed.\nAshley Young had already been on the receiving end of a strong challenge from Davies and a further lunge by the Spurs defender on the Villa veteran resulted in another booking. Young\u2019s apparently everlasting energy was underlined before the break with the 37-year-old flinging himself on the goalline to prevent Harry Kane\u2019s header, after a cross from Ivan Perisic, from opening the scoring.\nSon Heung-min floated in an ambitious attempt from a free-kick on the right edge of the penalty area but Olsen was safely behind it. At the other end, sightings were rare for Villa but Buend\u00eda curled a long-range shot past Lloris\u2019s far post in a first half starved of attacking craft.\nVilla made the perfect start to the second half as they pounced to stun Spurs. Douglas Luiz\u2019s long-range shot was not dealt with by Lloris, the goalkeeper parrying straight to Watkins, who set up Buend\u00eda for a low finish into the unguarded net. It was the 10th consecutive game in which Tottenham had conceded the opening goal but there was no comeback this time.\nSpurs looked for an immediate response but Perisic could only blast over the bar after controlling Yves Bissouma\u2019s lofted ball. Conte\u2019s attacking options from the bench were limited but he acted just after the hour by introducing Ryan Sessegnon in place of Gil. Kane had been afforded precious few opportunities and the frustrated striker could only lash a strike off target after a knockdown from Son.\n\nVilla were increasingly growing in confidence and stamped their authority on the match with an exquisitely taken second goal. John McGinn chipped the ball over the static Spurs defence for Douglas Luiz and the Brazil midfielder controlled the ball and flicked a finish beyond Lloris\u2019s flailing arms.\nIt was the seventh successive league match in which Spurs had conceded at least two goals but their lack of creativity was the greater concern as they failed to put Olsen under any pressure.\nEmery\u2019s team were playing with conviction, with a third goal almost arriving but the impressive Douglas Luiz\u2019s shot was held by Lloris. Villa finished with a swagger, as Emery extended his unbeaten record against Tottenham to four league matches including his time in charge at Arsenal.\nA third win in four league games under Emery is a strong return after his October arrival at Villa but for Conte the storm clouds are gathering."

                    "body": "\u201cThere\u2019s no pressure,\u201d Lautaro Mart\u00ednez said, but no one was buying that. Dozens of cameras pointed his way and the question had been direct. Sure, it started, this team lifted Argentina\u2019s first trophy in 28 years, winning the Copa Am\u00e9rica at the Maracan\u00e3, but go out of the tournament on Saturday night and it would be the worst catastrophe in World Cup history. Had they discussed that, his interrogator wanted to know. \u201cNo, no, that\u2019s not been talked about,\u201d the striker replied, and why would they? It\u2019s the kind of thought probably best kept to yourself.\nWhich doesn\u2019t make it go away. It\u2019s some statement \u2013 the worst catastrophe in their World Cup history \u2013 and it may sound absurd, as well as still being avoidable of course, but it may not be so far off. Just framing it like that said something of the fear; what\u2019s at stake. Since they won their first title in 1978, Argentina have been knocked out of the group stage once in 11 World Cups. That was in 2002, when they finished below England and Sweden. Now they have lost to Saudi Arabia, falling a single step away from a joint-record 37th game unbeaten. Mexico, their opponents on Saturday, and Poland do not offer an easy way out.\nLittle wonder so much of the focus was on Argentina\u2019s emotional state, their capacity to get up again. \u201cThe sun will come up tomorrow,\u201d is the message Argentina\u2019s coach, Lionel Scaloni, has repeated to his players often over the past four years. An attempt to release the pressure, to see them through the traumas they had been through, the failure four years ago \u2013 losing in the last 16 \u2013 and inspired among other things by his experience at West Ham, it is a message that will be tested now, taking on ever greater significance.\n\nSignificance is the word too: elimination is bad enough but there is more. This is a last chance at the tournament that is a last chance for Lionel Messi, made more profound by many of the men who have won the World Cup \u2013 Mario Kempes, Ricardo Villa, Jorge Burruchaga and Jorge Valdano among them \u2013 gathering in Doha on the second anniversary of Diego Maradona\u2019s death.\nMexico\u2019s Argentinian coach, Tata Martino, described Maradona\u2019s absence as a \u201cpermanent sadness\u201d. \u201cThis afternoon our thoughts turned to him,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all know exactly where we were when it happened.\u201d It is not just that Martino is Argentinian. He was there when Scaloni, aged 16, reached the first team at Newell\u2019s Old Boys.\n\u201cI would be telling you a big lie if I said I remembered him,\u201d Martino said; Scaloni though does remember it. Martino, he says, is an idol for Newell\u2019s fans such as him. Such as Messi\u2019s father, Jorge, too. Martino was also Messi\u2019s manager at Barcelona, referring to him here as \u201cthe best player there has been \u2026 for the last 15 years at least\u201d.\n\nThose layers ensured that Martino was asked here how he would feel about knocking out his country, about bringing Messi\u2019s last World Cup to a premature, sad end. In asking, responsibility was loaded on to Martino, as if football would not forgive him, let alone his country. \u201cAnd if you were me, what would you do?\u201d he replied. \u201cI know where I was born, I can tell you which hospital I was born in, what my town is like, but I work for Mexico and I have to do everything I can for Mexico to win.\u201d\nThere had already been a moment in the news conference when he said: \u201cI don\u2019t think our needs are so different.\u201d It was a timely reminder, if probably offered in vain. All the attention has inevitably turned on Argentina but Mexico, having drawn with Poland in their first game, probably need to win too. \u201cI put it in a footballing context and I am not unaware of the importance of this game for Mexico and Argentina, that the future of both depends on what happens tomorrow. When we were drawn in the group with them, we never imagined a scenario like this.\u201d\nNo one did. In truth, few contemplate this scenario from a Mexican perspective and their position is not so dramatic: neither the expectations nor the potential impact are as great and, fundamentally, a defeat would not end it yet. They do not stand on the edge like Argentina. The key now is to not look down and not look back either.\n\n\u201cWe had our mourning; now we\u2019re thinking solely about Mexico,\u201d Mart\u00ednez said. \u201cWe believe in our work, we trust in that, in the coaching staff and ourselves. We\u2019re very calm. I am convinced that we\u2019ll go out and represent Argentina like we should.\u201d\nDespite the defeat, there has been support \u2013 earned during these past four years where Scaloni\u2019s side have gone from failure to Copa Am\u00e9rica winners, finalissima champions against Italy, unbeaten in 36 games and among the favourites coming into Qatar. There has been a shift in ideas, in environment. Messi said he had never enjoyed the national team like this. It has been three years since they lost, a strength built that must now withstand a new scenario. Doubts, though, are inevitable. The pressure is too.\n\u201cThis group stands out for its unity and strength; this is the moment to show we are genuinely strong,\u201d Messi said after the Saudi Arabia game. \u201cIt has been a long time since we found ourselves in a situation like this, where we were obliged [to win].\u201d Scaloni admitted there were some doubts about his team: the injury of Gio Lo Celso, a player he considered irreplaceable, meant they were already there. But he insisted the overall style \u2013 that evolved from a counterattacking game to one in which they sought possession and control, to \u201cgood feet\u201d, as he called it \u2013 would not change.\n\nHe also insisted Messi would be fit, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t know where the story that he didn\u2019t train yesterday came from: there are even pictures.\u201d The focus though was more psychological than technical. \u201cThe first blow is a shock, but it\u2019s how you get up,\u201d Scaloni said. \u201cThere\u2019s no other option. You have to be ready for the fall. It was all the colour of roses, everything was happiness. It can happen, it\u2019s football. The weird thing would have been for a run of 30 games or more to keep going on. We\u2019ll play for our lives, as if it was the last game, and then what has to happen will happen \u2013 which I hope is to win the game.\u201d\nAsked what was in play, Scaloni replied: \u201cA football match, with all the responsibility that brings, knowing we have a whole country behind us.\u201d He added: \u201cWe will give everything, every last bead of sweat, to turn this around. I would like people to know what this group has given and will continue to give the people. We\u2019re fine: we know that we have an important game tomorrow. Luckily, it depends on us. One trip cannot in any way damage the path we have travelled.\n\u201cToday is a sad day for all of us and we hope that tomorrow we can make Diego happy, looking down on us from heaven. It still doesn\u2019t seem real that he\u2019s not here and we want to win and dedicate it to him.\u201d"

Under the bright lights of the sold-out Eden Park stadium in Auckland, with ribbons glittering gold behind her, a beaming Tui sang T\u016btira mai ng\u0101 iwi (Come Together as One) to the crowd, and more than 40,000 adoring voices responded: \u2013 \u2018t\u0101tou t\u0101tou e!\u2019 the stadium roared: \u2018all of us, all of us!\u2019.  It was a moving and fitting end to a tournament that has sparked a new, and overdue, fever for women\u2019s rugby. Record-breaking crowds and TV viewership, wall-to-wall media coverage, and packed bars \u2013 the fandom for the women\u2019s tournament was unprecedented. \u201cIf you like sport, take away the gender,\u201d Tui said, urging people to ask themselves what\u2019s entertaining them. \u201cBecause I guarantee you, that semi and that final \u2013 that was entertainment, baby. That\u2019s what sport is.\u201d  Lily, a fan who flew from Wellington to attend the match at Auckland\u2019s Eden Park with her wh\u0101nau [family] said she had never experienced a sports game quite like it, \u201cwhere the crowd is so, so invested at every step of the game, right from the outset\u2026it felt like so much more was on the line\u201d. \u201cThe collective tension was unbelievable,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople were on the edge of their seats minute after minute \u2013 there was absolute euphoria at Eden Park.\u201d The connectedness to te ao M\u0101ori [the M\u0101ori world] was palpable, she added, noting that she had never seen so much use of M\u0101ori language songs, the M\u0101ori flag waving and tens of thousands of fans swinging poi in support. \u201cThe haka brought tears to people\u2019s eyes and through every high and every low the crowd was there \u2013 it was electric and proud.\u201d  At a packed out sports bar in Wellington, a pair of friends \u2013 one M\u0101ori, one British \u2013 took turns celebrating and despairing as their respective teams advanced and retreated throughout the match towards the final hair-raising minute. As the 80th minute ticked over and New Zealand\u2019s win was assured, long time rugby fan, Marnie (of Ng\u0101 Puhi descent), leapt out of her chair. \u201cI\u2019m overwhelmed, I want to cry,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m feeling fucking amazing, I am so proud. The women have worked so hard \u2013 they are mana w\u0101hine toa [strong women] \u2013 as a M\u0101ori woman, I am so proud.\u201d Marni paid respects to the English team: \u201cThe kiwis felt the pressure, they played us hard to the end \u2013 but, hey, kiwis love rugby, it\u2019s in our blood.\u201d Marni\u2019s friend, Charlie \u2013 a former rugby player - believed she was the only Brit in the bar but that she \u201cloved watching the New Zealanders go hard\u201d. Charlie, who lives in New Zealand, felt torn over who to root for in the final but said \u201cboth teams gave such an amazing performance.\u201d Prime minister Jacinda Ardern, who was flying to Cambodia during the match, congratulated the Black Ferns on social media. \u201cWhen we boarded the NZDF plane to head to the East Asia Summit this afternoon, I asked the crew whether they were expecting any updates on the Black Ferns game while we were mid air,\u201d she wrote. \u201cNot only did they update us on the score, we got a run down on injuries. We landed with enough time to catch the closing 20mins\u2026and I\u2019m so glad we did. There are no words for that game, just like there\u2019s almost no words for the Black Ferns. But for now, I\u2019m going to go with \u2018legends.\u2019\u201d  It is a sentiment echoed by fans \u2013 young and old \u2013 around the country, and a tournament sure to inspire a new generation of fans and players alike. As the cameras panned the Eden Park crowd a young girl held up a sign: \u201cThey\u2019re not girls, they\u2019re legends\u201d. \u201cWomen\u2019s rugby was just as good as I always told you it was\u201d, rugby super-fan and commentator Alice Soper posted on twitter, followed with a plea to New Zealand Rugby: \u201c[Now] bloody invest in these champions and all the ones you just inspired today.\u201d"

That is with no disrespect intended to debutants Greece, whose side is predominantly part-time and were always likely to be well-beaten.\nBut given how England have caught the eye in their opening two group games, and that Australia did something similar to Scotland, you felt the minimum expectation was to put down a statement.\n\nHow they did that: setting more English records than the points they conceded on a wet afternoon in Sheffield to set up a probable quarter-final against Papua New Guinea in Wigan next Saturday.\nEven with the visible gulf in class here, the list of team and individual records set is eye-catching. It was England\u2019s biggest World Cup victory, surpassing the 76-4 win against Russia in 2000 by some distance. Only Australia\u2019s 110-4 against Russia in the same year is bigger.\nThere were 17 England tries, four of them to the sensational winger, Dom Young.\nThat made it eight in three Tests and his reputation enhanced at pace once again. The 21-year-old is one of the standout talents in the tournament, but he was ably supported by his teammates, with 11 of the side scoring at least once.\nGreece, however, deserve credit for giving England an early scare before the onslaught began. Young and Matty Lees had crossed to make it 10-0 before Sitemi Taukamo stunned the hosts with a try and produce a roaring cheer from the hardy band of Greece supporters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s job done,\u201d Shane Wane, the England coach, said. \u201cIt was an awkward fixture and fair play to Greece, they\u2019ve turned up and didn\u2019t give in until the end. We did a lot of good things but it\u2019ll be a different challenge next week.\u201d\nEngland scored six tries in a blistering 20-minute spell after Taukamo\u2019s shock score to move 44-6 ahead by the break. Young scored three of them, while Ryan Hall, Tom Burgess and the ever-impressive George Williams also crossed for tries.\nThe second half was just as devastating with another 50 points and yet more records being set.\nRugby league was illegal in Greece as recently as five years ago, making the fact they are competing in the World Cup a remarkable feat in itself. They were always going to have a chastening experience against teams as strong as this on their debut, but they can now plan for a brighter future.\nBut they were dispatched emphatically. The scoring resumed three minutes after the restart when Tommy Makinson seized on a loose ball to touch down. Marc Sneyd added his name to the increasingly long scoring list and by full-time he had set a record for most points scored in a Test by an Englishman with 13 successful kicks giving him 30 of England\u2019s 94 points.\nBurgess and Hall \u2013 his 39th in 40 appearances for his country, second only to Australia\u2019s Billy Slater in the all-time international list \u2013claimed their second tries before the hour mark with Greece\u2019s defence visibly tired and being cut open at will almost every time England touched the ball.\n\nAndy Ackers\u2019s try in the 68th minute brought up the record-winning margin in a World Cup game, making it 78-4.\nKai Pearce-Paul, Joe Batchelor and Mike McMeeken also scored in the final quarter as England refused to take their foot off the gas. With so many impressive individual performances it was difficult not to cast an eye towards thinking about the side Wane will settle on to face Papua New Guinea.\nIt has been fun, but the real business starts now."

                    "body": "I heard someone say recently that the France forward Olivier Giroud, their new record goalscorer, \u201cdeserves his flowers\u201d. He does. Before each game for France at this World Cup, all eyes are on Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, the star who has scored five goals in five games, but the impact of Giroud, who has four in four, flies under the radar. In the buildup to England\u2019s 2-1 loss to France the story was the same: will Kyle Walker be the player to stop Mbapp\u00e9? How effective is Mbapp\u00e9 going to be able to be?\nThis matches a narrative that has stuck with Giroud throughout his career. We are so preoccupied with the speed, ball control and dribbling skills of players such as Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and Mbapp\u00e9, that top strikers such as Giroud are overlooked.\nAgainst England, we saw the full benefits of Giroud. France were not at their best. In some ways we\u2019ve been spoiled by some of the French teams over the years with players such as Zinedine Zidane, Marcel Desailly and Claude Makelele, teams and players against which this side will always be measured. Anytime we think of France, we think of the flair, the fluidity of play, the elegance, the finesse. We saw glimpses of that on Saturday, but we didn\u2019t see it in large doses.\n\nHowever, they did show they can get things done when they are not at their full, flying best. We still saw majesty from Mbapp\u00e9 on the ball and the intelligence of Antoine Griezmann dropped into that midfield role while Adrien Rabiot looked another level, dictating the linkup between defence and midfield and into the forward line. But the strengths and qualities of a forward such as Giroud, when things aren\u2019t going your way as a team, were fully on show.\nWe shouldn\u2019t underestimate the work he does to be on the defenders\u2019 case with his movement and his positioning so that they do not get a moment\u2019s rest. That is extremely tiring and frustrating because they constantly have to be switched on to his whereabouts. The mind is constantly racing: Where is he? Who\u2019s got him? Is he in between us? Here he is now. He\u2019s stretching the game. We can\u2019t squeeze that space because what about this space?\nHe is also the sort of forward who does not need to be involved in every action. He is happy to preoccupy the two centre\u2011backs or a centre\u2011back and a full\u2011back and slip in between them, stretch the game by pushing them back into their half or into their box and allow crafty, creative, agile teammates \u2013 Mbapp\u00e9, Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni \u2013 to do their thing. He is a team player, a selfless player who sticks to the gameplan, allows others to succeed and in turn they allow him to do what he is good at. He frees them up to be able to deliver the kind of balls he wants and expects to receive.\n\nGiroud understands his role and he thrives off it. If we look at the goal he scored against England \u2013 at an incredibly important time, in the 78th minute \u2013 we see it is a quality header. But his main priority is getting across the centre-back. He moves in between Harry Maguire and John Stones and looks to get good contact with the ball and redirect it. That is a forward\u2019s bread and butter. That\u2019s what every forward is coached to do. When you\u2019re in the box, make it difficult for the centre-backs, get across them as quickly as you can or on their blind side. Then it is the job of the wingers or wide forwards to put a good quality delivery in the box and you go after it.\nWhat sets Giroud apart from other traditional centre-forwards is how good he is when the team bring the ball down, dominate and play their way and also how good he is when they have to go more route one. You won\u2019t always dominate possession, you can\u2019t always build, you can\u2019t always create. Sometimes it is just a simple ball into the box and someone who\u2019s willing, committed and more determined than defenders to put themselves on the line.\n\nBut if France needed to play a more transitional counterattacking style Giroud still fits that shape. He can drop deeper into the midfield areas, link up the play and allow space in behind for the quick, dynamic players to get into. Then he will sprint into the box to try to get on the end of something too.\nHe is a great asset because he allows the team to be more flexible and adaptable, depending on the way they want to play and how they might be forced to play.\nIt is this adaptability that makes France such a force and why the match\u2011up with a thrilling Morocco side in their semi\u2011final on Wednesday is mouthwatering. It\u2019s the match I\u2019ve been most excited about in this tournament. Morocco have already done themselves, their country and their continent proud but it is going to be fascinating to see what kind of magic they can display. They\u2019ve shown they are real competitors. They are so disciplined and well organised as a team but, what excites me too, is that they have the potential to cause damage in their final third, too.\nThere were moments of transition in their quarter\u2011final defeat of Portugal, where they were moving at a blazing speed from defence to attack and committing numbers. This is a team showing real belief. They believe they can go out and beat big teams and because of the history of immigration in France, the large north African communities in the country and the number of players of African heritage competing for France over the years, there\u2019s an extra element to this tie.\nIt is like they are meeting their brothers \u2013 but brothers they want to beat."

                    "body": "Capuozzo\u2019s moment of magic Italy arrived in Cardiff on the back of 36 consecutive defeats in the Six Nations and though Wales had hardly had a championship to remember \u2013 a disappointing defence of their title \u2013 given the Azzurri\u2019s tendency to get worse as the tournament goes on they were given little hope of breaking their seven-year duck. They were heading for another gallant defeat when Josh Adams went over after 68 minutes, but with less than two minutes to go Edoardo Padovani gathered Kieran Hardy\u2019s overhit box-kick and passed inside to Ange Capuozzo. The full-back, then 22, cemented his burgeoning reputation with a dazzling run, through Adams, then twisted Hardy inside out and delivered the pass to Padovani to score. Paolo Garbisi nailed the conversion to seal a magnificent victory. Italy built on it by defeating Australia this autumn, adding further intrigue to next year\u2019s tournament, with a home match against France kicking off their campaign. Raynal\u2019s whistle does the talking Recent history suggests there is nothing unusual about New Zealand romping clear of Australia in the third quarter but, as was shown throughout the year, the All Blacks are susceptible to late rallies and so it was in Melbourne with a Nic White penalty edging the Wallabies, who had been 18 points down, ahead. The All Blacks shifted into another gear and pressed for the winning score but a penalty for Australia near their own line with around 90 seconds to play seemed to be decisive. That was until the referee, Mathieu Raynal, who had grown increasingly fed up throughout the match, pinged Bernard Foley for time-wasting and awarded New Zealand a scrum from which Jordie Barrett scored the matchwinning try. To some Raynal \u2013 who has consistently stood by his decision \u2013 was right to call up Foley, to others it was a dangerous precedent and questionable timing considering there are plenty of occasions calls like that could be made in most matches. World Rugby\u2019s recent directives designed to speed up the game suggest we will see more of it in the buildup to \u2013 and during \u2013 next year\u2019s World Cup. That doesn\u2019t make it any easier for the Wallabies to stomach, however. A shootout for the ages As much as the Champions Cup is floundering at the moment, it is worth bearing in mind that last season\u2019s competition looked, for long spells, unlikely to be completed due to Covid, before springing into life in a captivating knockout phase. None more so than Toulouse\u2019s trip to Dublin to face Munster in the quarter-finals and a first penalty shootout since 2009. The 80-minute contest wasn\u2019t bad in its own right but the tension went up several notches in a scoreless period of extra time before the thrilling denouement. They are so rare that broadcasters and spectators alike were not entirely sure of the format \u2013 indeed Romain Ntamack celebrated ahead of schedule when scoring Toulouse\u2019s third kick \u2013 but it was one of those moments that captured the attention of those with barely a passing interest in the sport. We are told often enough by administrators of the club game that is the holy grail so maybe we should see extra time done away with and shootouts take place a little more often. The steal that stole the Rugby World Cup In a final between favourites England and the host Black Ferns that pretty much had it all \u2013 breathtaking tries, an audacious off the floor offload to seize the lead following a scintillating comeback and a world record crowd for a women\u2019s rugby match \u2013 in the end, the game was won on the last play. England\u2019s lineout had dominated throughout the Rugby World Cup, their go-to catch and drive generating countless scores, including in the Eden Park finale, but at the very last, they were outplayed. Trailing by three points having played for 60 minutes with 14 after Lydia Thompson\u2019s red, England won a lineout on the New Zealand five-metre line. As they lined up for what should have been yet another scoring opportunity, the Black Ferns read the call, Joanah Ngan-Woo leapt and stole back possession in front of Abbie Ward, and took the cup away from Sarah Hunter\u2019s side. In the end, someone had to lose, but the Black Ferns\u2019 victory, based on freedom and fun and supported across the nation, meant that really, the winner was as much the women\u2019s game. Fan power sees off Jones Arguably the most significant moment of the year was when boos echoed around Twickenham at the final whistle of England\u2019s limp defeat by South Africa because for all that Bill Sweeney had endorsed Eddie Jones\u2019s World Cup masterplan through two dreadful Six Nations campaigns, supporters making their views so clear forced him to act. Sweeney insists the decision was purely results-based and as much as that rings true, you suspect Jones\u2019s comments about private schools over the summer particularly stung the debenture holders the RFU so cherishes. Jones\u2019s biggest strength at the start of his tenure was the clarity he brought to what was by and large Stuart Lancaster\u2019s squad, but by the end there was a fog of confusion around his setup. He maintains he could have lifted it in the buildup to France 2023 but he was denied the chance to have another crack at the trophy he so covets. Steve Borthwick will bring the usual bounce next year but the jury remains out on whether he can succeed where Jones narrowly failed."

                    "body": "Of all the issues facing England before they open their World Cup campaign by facing Iran on Monday afternoon, nothing feels more pressing than the question of whether Gareth Southgate will end up regretting his decision to stick by Harry Maguire.\nThe potential for everything to go wrong because of a stumble from a centre-back fortunate even to be in the squad is obvious. This, more than anything, is the call that has to come off for Southgate. This is a manager derided for his caution opening himself up to derision by playing with fire, albeit with an act of recklessness that feels pragmatic and limiting: a tactical choice that somehow manages to come across both as a risk and an example of the safety\u2011first approach that threatens to hold England back.\n\nThe contradiction is striking. On the one hand we have Southgate risking it all on one faltering defender; on the other it is possible to view the Maguiredependencia as the conservative move. It is a show of strength from a manager refusing to bow to public consensus and an admission of weakness for England, who would no doubt find it easier to move on from Maguire if they had defenders queuing up to take his place.\nEither way, Southgate is aware of the likely reaction if a Maguire error ends up costing his side. \u201cWhatever reputation I have, I\u2019m putting it on there,\u201d England\u2019s head coach said when asked about his trust in the Manchester United player in September. \u201cYou always have to back your judgment and we feel he is an important player.\u201d\nIt is not a widely shared view. There will be grumbles if, as expected, Maguire starts against Iran. Southgate will be accused of favouritism and it is hard not to worry for Maguire, who must ensure that the sceptics do not affect his focus when he steps out at the Khalifa International Stadium.\nThe pressure will be intense. Comb through Southgate\u2019s time in charge of England and it is impossible to find a bigger gamble than his loyalty to Maguire. He has made bold decisions \u2013 leaving Joe Hart and Jack Wilshere out of the squad for the 2018 World Cup, ending Wayne Rooney\u2019s international career, making Jordan Pickford his No 1 \u2013 but those calls were rooted in ruthless logic. With Maguire, the impression is that Southgate has developed a blind spot.\n\nHow far does loyalty inspired by past performances go? Maguire\u2019s crisis of confidence has gone on for a long time. He has started one Premier League game since August and appears to have no long\u2011term future at United. They have improved as a defensive unit since dropping Maguire, who has made only nine appearances this season, and Erik ten Hag will not stop him leaving next summer.\n\nOf course the difference for Ten Hag is that United\u2019s centre\u2011back options are not limited to a small pool of English players. Ultimately, while there have been complaints that Southgate has acted unfairly by picking Maguire on reputation rather than form, it is true that England do not have many alternatives.\nAs Southgate pointed out when he named his squad for Qatar, the young duo of Marc Gu\u00e9hi and Fikayo Tomori are not quite ready yet. Tyrone Mings is out of the picture.\nIf England play a back three there is no obvious replacement for Maguire as the left-sided centre\u2011back. What would Southgate do if the 29-year-old gets injured before, say, a quarter-final against France? Move John Stones to the left, put Eric Dier in the middle and have Kyle Walker on the right? It would hardly be a tried and trusted set-up.\nThat is why England are still leaning on Maguire and hoping that he can recapture the form that earned him a place in the team of the tournament at Euro 2020. At his best he is a powerful, imposing defender. He is decent on the ball and is perfectly capable of flourishing in a compact, deep defence, which is why he has been such a strong performer for Southgate\u2019s England.\nAt his worst, though, Maguire is a lumbering, accident\u2011prone presence. He is not quick, so it is hard for England to push up the pitch and play a high line. He is fallible in one-on-one situations, so Southgate tends to shed an attacker and play a back three against top opposition. It is not ideal and, for all that Southgate has continued to publicly and privately support Maguire, there is no escaping the fact that the former Leicester defender was at fault for at least one goal when England drew 3-3 with Germany in September.\nThe memory of Maguire losing possession, fouling Jamal Musiala and giving away the penalty from which Ilkay G\u00fcndogan put Germany ahead lingers. It will remain present against Iran, regardless of whether Maguire plays with Stones in a back four or, with Walker injured, Dier comes into a three. But Southgate has not been swayed. He will back Maguire to shine against Iran, who have dangerous forwards, and to handle the speed of England\u2019s other opponents in Group B, Wales and USA.\nThe risks are plain. Southgate knows the first hint of defensive vulnerability will leave him exposed. He is gambling everything on Maguire. Will it be worth the hassle?"

Ta-ra!      2.47pm    Thomas Frank\u2019s verdict  Until the Kane goal I think there was only one team on the pitch. They threatened when it was 2-2, but over the 90 minutes I think we deserved the win. It\u2019s a very good performance and we\u2019re disappointed [not to win]. Set-pieces are important. I think we are better than most teams. I would love to go more toe to toe against [teams like Spurs] but first and foremost I want to win. It\u2019s not bad to play five top-six teams and lose only one, to Arsenal. We said we needed to do three things to win the game: stop Kane, which we almost managed, win the transitions and then win the set-piece battle.   Updated at 2.48pm GMT    2.40pm    Ivan Toney\u2019s verdict  We shouldn\u2019t have given them a sniff to get back in the game but they\u2019ve got the quality and it was a great header from Harry. In the end a draw was probably a fair result. It was painful not getting picked in the [England World Cup] squad but that\u2019s life. The more you dwell on it, the more it\u2019s gonna hurt you. Just leave it behind and keep looking forward.   Updated at 2.46pm GMT    2.30pm    There are four 3pm games in the Premier League, and Simon Burnton is following them.      2.29pm    That was a pretty entertaining game, and the result feels about right. Vitaly Janelt and the superb Ivan Toney gave Brentford a deserved 2-0 lead early in the second half, but Harry Kane\u2019s fine header sparked Spurs into life and they created enough chances in the last half hour to win the game. In the end, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg\u2019s equaliser was all they could manage.  Updated at 2.31pm GMT    2.27pm   Full time: Brentford 2-2 Tottenham Hotspur  The Premier League\u2019s back, baby.      2.27pm    90+6 min Brentford are hanging on. Kulusevski fires a pass into Son, just outside the area to the right of centre. He shifts the ball onto his left foot and crunches a low shot that is well saved by Raya, diving low to his right.     2.25pm    90+5 min Lenglet is replaced by Ben Davies.     2.24pm    90+3 min Son\u2019s corner is cleared at the near post. Lenglet has gone down holding his face after wearing a stray elbow. There\u2019s a line of blood trickling down his forehead, so he will need treatment. The Brentford players aren\u2019t happy that the physios are attending to Lenglet on the field rather than off it.  Updated at 2.25pm GMT    2.23pm    90+3 min Hojbjerg\u2019s cross is headed behind by Zanka for a Spurs corner\u2026     2.22pm    90+2 min Kane threads a neat pass through to Kulusevski, who rides Mee\u2019s tackle on the edge of the area and cuts the ball back towards the penalty spot. There\u2019s nobody there for Spurs and a Brentford defender has time to boot it clear.     2.21pm    90+2 min Dier hoofs a cross straight out of play. Antonio Conte turns on his heels in disgust.     2.21pm    90+1 min There will be five minutes of added time.     2.20pm    90 min \u201cI agree that VAR can be frustrating and inconsistent,\u201d says Joe Pearson, \u201cbut if you\u2019re a fan of a team that plays a high defensive line and relies on the offside trap, VAR is often your friend. Yes, I am a Liverpool supporter.\u201d I thought you were going to say Saudi Arabia.     2.20pm    89 min A draw would probably be a fair result. Brentford were better for an hour but Spurs have been terrific since belatedly waking up.     2.18pm    88 min Perisic\u2019s corner goes straight into the welcoming embrace of Raya.     2.18pm    87 min Hojbjerg\u2019s long-range shot deflects behind for another corner. Spurs look the likelier winners, but then so did England against Romania in 1998, Brian.     2.17pm    86 min \u201cBoth teams embarrassing themselves with these dives and surrounding the ref,\u201d says Filip Gieldon. \u201cDon\u2019t understand why he is allowing it, one player even put his hands on the ref\u2019s shoulders. There should be retroactive bans for players who cheat this blatantly.\u201d It was the same at the World Cup. The entitlement is really tedious, isn\u2019t it.     2.16pm    85 min: Chance for Toney! And now an excellent chance for Brentford. Dasilva\u2019s deep cross was headed back across goal by Roerslev, and Toney stabbed a volley over the bar from six yards. He was probably put off by Forster, who was flying towards him, but it was still a really good opportunity.     2.15pm    84 min: Kane hits the bar! Spurs were so close to completing the comeback. Lenglet, the left-sided centre-back, was again the creator with a beautiful cross from deep on the left. Kane got across the keeper Raya at the near post and flicked a header off the face of the crossbar.  Updated at 2.15pm GMT    2.14pm    84 min \u201cHow on earth was that not a penalty for the foul on Doherty?\u201d says Richard Coopey. \u201cNot hard to see why people think VAR is rubbish when goals are disallowed for an offside toenail but a clear foul in the box is left unpunished.\u201d The argument would be that it wasn\u2019t a clear foul \u2013 there was contact, certainly, but was it enough to knock Doherty off his feet? I don\u2019t think you can say it was a clear and obvious error. Equally, had it been given I don\u2019t think it would have been overturned by VAR. That said, VAR in the bin at your earliest convenience please Fifa.     2.13pm    83 min A sweet long-range strike from Sanchez is held by Raya. He caught it beautifully but it was straight at the keeper.     2.13pm    82 min: Double substitution for Brentford Josh Dasilva and Yoane Wissa replace Norgaard and Mbeumo.     2.11pm    80 min \u201cI agree that Kane\u2019s overall performances in Qatar were better than in Russia (despite the goals - his hat trick in Russia must be the least glorious in World Cup history),\u201d says David Wall. \u201cBut i don\u2019t think he was the best centre forward. Sure, he wasn\u2019t fully fit in the final, but otherwise Giroud was excellent throughout for France (plus he got some goals). And Alvarez was similarly excellent for Argentina, his running being crucial to how they wanted to play.\u201d I suppose it\u2019s just personal taste. I thought Kane was more creative and influential than Giroud and Alvarez, but I appreciate the argument for both.      2.10pm    79 min Perisic\u2019s flat cross is headed wide by the late arriving Doherty. He was under pressure but it was still a decent chance. Perisic and Doherty have run riot in the last 10-15 minutes.     2.08pm    78 min Kane misses an acrobatic effort after good play from the wing-backs Perisic and Doherty. Perisic then appeals for handball against a Brentford defender, but VAR aren\u2019t interested.     2.07pm    76 min \u201cIt\u2019s not important but was there any mention of why Lloris is on the bench?\u201d says Joe Balfour. \u201cWas Conte perhaps trying to boost Harry\u2019s confidence by making him lead the team out? Either way, it\u2019s worked.\u201d I think he only resumed training yesterday and Conte decided to give him a bit more time to get over the final.     2.06pm    75 min Now Mbeumo is booked for diving! He ran onto a long pass, went past Forster and then went over. Replays confirm it was a risible dive.     2.05pm    74 min Doherty goes down in the area after a challenge from Zanka, and the two players square up to each other. There was a bit of contact, but Doherty certainly made the most of it. Zanka shoved Doherty in the face and might have been booked.     2.04pm    73 min Son\u2019s cross is headed over by Kane, who had to stoop away from goal to meet the dipping ball. It was an imaginative effort but he had no realistic chance of scoring.     2.03pm    Kulusevski combined nicely with Doherty before sliding a cutback that deflected off Mee and into the path of Hojbjerg, 12 yards out. He took a touch and calmly sidefooted the ball into the far corner.  Updated at 2.03pm GMT    2.02pm   GOAL! Brentford 2-2 Spurs (Hojbjerg 72)  The comeback kings are doing it again.    Updated at 2.37pm GMT    2.01pm    71 min This is Spurs\u2019 best spell of the game, with a much greater urgency in their attacking play.     2.00pm    70 min Brentford\u2019s last victory over Spurs was on 20 March 1948.     1.58pm    67 min: Brentford substitution Saman Ghoddos replaces Jensen in midfield.     1.58pm    67 min: Spurs substitution Davinson Sanchez replaces Tanganga, who was outfought and outsmarted by Toney.     1.57pm    67 min Mbeumo misses a good chance, pinging Henry\u2019s low cross over the bar from 12 yards. It might have bounced awkwardly.     1.56pm    Harry Kane has given Spurs hope with a superb goal. Lenglet moved forward and curled a good cross to the far post, where Kane got above Mee and powered an emphatic header back across goal.     1.55pm   GOAL! Brentford 2-1 Spurs (Kane 65)  Welcome back.   Updated at 2.03pm GMT    1.54pm    64 min \u201cIs it just me or was Kane\u2019s appeal for the penalty a little less animated than usual,\u201d says Brendan Large. \u201cWonder why?\u201d I think that\u2019s a bit harsh. Kane will be desperate to take a penalty as soon as possible.     1.54pm    63 min Toney is booked for leaving a bit on Lenglet.     1.53pm    62 min \u201cAnd just when I thought we were getting into the game,\u201d writes Alexandra Ashton. \u201cThat is dismal from Dier, really is, and it\u2019s quite perplexing as to why he\u2019s dropped off in form since his England recall. I can make any number of excuses for this performance, but it\u2019s just not been good enough.\u201d Most of the players look half asleep, and in fairness I know how they feel.     1.51pm    60 min \u201cKane scored two goals at the World Cup, one of them was a penalty,\u201d says Hugh Mallon. \u201cHe was outscored by both Saka and Rashford for England and was joint 12th highest goalscorer. Too much mulled wine this morning Rob?\u201d He made three goals as well, but the whole point is that I was talking about performances rather than stats. In 2018 he won the Golden Boot but he scored three penalties, two tap-ins and a deflection. This time I thought his general play was better than any other centre-forward.     1.50pm    59 min Jensen is booked for a foul on Son, and then Bissouma is booked for a foul on Toney. Spurs can\u2019t handle him.     1.48pm    57 min Ivan Toney has been fantastic today, totally unaffected by his FA charge. He rolls Tanganga with ease on the left, cuts inside and gives the ball to Mbeumo, who dithers and loses the ball. Toney could have had a shot himself.     1.46pm    56 min \u201cIn the age of analytics, has anyone studied exactly what transforms a decent lower league player into a top Premier League star?\u201d says Gary Naylor. \u201cWhat is Ivan Toney doing now that he didn\u2019t do for seven seasons in League One? Is it fitness, confidence, coaching, style of play, attitude, pay? More importantly, how do you spot the next one?\u201d     1.45pm    Dier shanked a volleyed clearance behind for a corner, and Brentford made him pay. Mbeumo\u2019s inswinger from the right was headed across goal by Norgaard (I think) and Toney studded it into the net from three yards.     1.44pm   GOAL! Brentford 2-0 Tottenham (Toney 54)  The big man doubles Brentford\u2019s lead!   Updated at 1.51pm GMT    1.43pm    52 min: No penalty! Perisic curled a deep, inswinging cross to the far post, where Mee had his arm round Kane and ensured he couldn\u2019t get clean contact on the ball. I suppose it doesn\u2019t count as a clear and obvious error, but Kane will feel he had a case.  Updated at 1.43pm GMT    1.41pm    51 min Kane appeals unsuccessfully for a penalty after wrestling with Mee in the area. This might be given by VAR\u2026     1.40pm    50 min Son\u2019s corner is headed away at the near post.     1.40pm    49 min Kane and Son combine to find Perisic, whose low cross is turned behind by Mee.     1.39pm    49 min \u201cThanks to Joe for the compliment,\u201d says Mary Waltz, \u201cbut being an old retiree myself afternoon naps make it easy to get up early, combined with the state of my kidneys means I am up around that time anyway. Look at what you youngsters have to look forward to!\u201d Merry Christmas!  Updated at 1.39pm GMT    1.38pm    48 min Son collects a loose ball 35 yards from goal but then overhits a relatively simple pass to Kulusevski. That sums up Spurs\u2019 performance so far.     1.35pm    46 min Peep peep! Brentford begin the second half.     1.27pm    \u201cOnly four minutes of added time?\u201d sniffs David Cross. \u201cSurely we expect a minimum of five, rising to 14 or 15 after the World Cup.\u201d     1.22pm    Half-time reading      1.21pm    \u201cHello Rob,\u201d says Ray Lewis. \"\u201cFrom here in pitch dark and gusty northwest Washington state, the Premier League has been gone so long I had forgotten that Tottenham doesn\u2019t wake up until the second half so perhaps should have done the same.\u201d They\u2019ve definitely picked up where they left off before Qatar.     1.20pm   Half time: Brentford 1-0 Tottenham Hotspur  Brentford lead a sluggish Spurs through Vitaly Janelt\u2019s opportunistic early goal. Spurs had more possession and more shots, but Brentford were undeniably the better team. Ivan Toney was superb, Harry Kane peripheral. See you in 10 minutes for the second half.     1.20pm    45+4 min Perisic\u2019s dangerous deep cross looks set to find Doherty in front of goal, but Mbeumo appears from nowhere to force the ball clear. Fine defending.     1.18pm    45+2 min Perisic\u2019s cross is headed away to the edge of the D, where Hojbjerg\u2019s half-volley is blocked by Janelt.     1.17pm    45+1 min Four minutes of added time.     1.15pm    45 min Lenglet\u2019s flat cross is headed back across goal by Kane, and Raya comes from his line to grab the ball just in front of Son.     1.14pm    43 min: Disallowed goal Toney calmly walks round Forster to score, though deep down he and everyone else knew he was offside. VAR confirms as much.  Updated at 1.14pm GMT    1.12pm    42 min \u201cMorning Rob, from a dark and freezing Austin,\u201d says David C Hunter. \u201cA little tranquility time with tea before the tree must be de-decorated. Your tradition may differ. Definitely put \u201866 up at the top of most exciting WC finals. \u201894 in LA, Brazil v Italy among the worst.\u201d      1.11pm    41 min An Amazon statbox tells us Harry Kane has had 10 touches, the fewest of any player on the pitch.     1.10pm    40 min Tanganga mistimes a header and instead nuts Janelt in the back of the neck. That looked pretty painful, and Tanganga is a bit fortunate not to be booked.     1.10pm    39 min \u201cRegarding Mary Waltz`s dedication,\u201d begins Bogdan Kotarlic. \u201cI remember when I was a fourteen-year-old during the Mexico 1986 World Cup. Some of the matches were starting very late (for us Europeans),I followed almost all of the games and I had school classes early in the morning so I hardly slept for a few weeks. Still, I was very proud to tell my scholomates that England had won 3-0 against Poland and that Gary Lineker had scored a hat-trick. I wouldn`t do that never again, I am 50 now and I love sleeping. But those were the days.\u201d Even when I was young I couldn\u2019t manage that. During USA 94 I woke up to the BBC Test Card every second morning, having fallen asleep during the late game.     1.08pm    37 min Lenglet\u2019s deflected long-range shot is headed away by Mee. Spurs have dominated possession but it\u2019s all been in front of Brentford. Kane has hardly touched the ball.     1.05pm    34 min: Good save from Forster! Jensen\u2019s long throw from the right isn\u2019t cleared properly by Spurs. Zanka, on the right side of the six-yard box, hooks a good shot on the turn that is instinctively kicked away by Forster.     1.04pm    34 min A quiet few minutes, nothing to report.     1.01pm    30 min Spurs are getting better, though Kane remains on the periphery of the game.     1.00pm    30 min Dier moves forward and plays a square pass to Son, 25 yards from goal. He shapes a left-footed curler that is comfortably saved to his right by the diving Raya.     12.59pm    29 min Mbeumo\u2019s deep, flighted corner is claimed at the second attempt by Forster.     12.59pm    28 min Mbeumo\u2019s free-kick is headed over his own bar by Dier.     12.58pm    27 min Hojbjerg fouls Mbeumo 25 yards from goal, a fair way to the left of centre.     12.57pm    26 min Kulusevski glides elegantly away from Mee on the right, cuts into the area and cracks a low drive straight at Raya. That was a lovely little run from a highly watchable player.  Updated at 12.57pm GMT    12.56pm    25 min The stretching Mbeumo just fails to control a long pass over the top. Had he done so, he\u2019d have been through on Forster.     12.55pm    25 min Son\u2019s long-range shot bounces gently through to Raya.     12.54pm    23 min There\u2019s a long way to go, and Spurs have had comebacks galore this season, but at the moment Brentford look hungrier and sharper.     12.52pm    21 min Henry squares up to Kulusevski, who fouled him and then seemed to leave his foot in as he walked past.      12.51pm    21 min Spurs aren\u2019t at the races yet.     12.50pm    19 min \u201cKudos to Mary Waltz for her dedication,\u201d says Joe Pearson. \u201cAs I am an old person, I sometimes wake up at 4.30am. But I don\u2019t get up that early intentionally just to watch football. There are such things as DVRs after all.\u201d     12.49pm    18 min Jensen\u2019s corner is looped towards goal by a Brentford player and pushed away a little nervously by Forster. I thought he might have been fouled but the referee disagreed.     12.48pm    17 min This is the fifth consecutive Premier League game in which Spurs have conceded the first goal.     12.47pm    Mee\u2019s speculative ball forward was headed on expertly by Toney to Mbeumo on the left wing. His deep cross picked out Norgaard, whose volley was going well wide until it hit Lenglet and ricocheted towards goal. Forster made a smart reaction save but Janelt gobbled up the rebound from six yards.  Updated at 12.47pm GMT    12.45pm   GOAL!  Brentford 1-0 Spurs (Janelt 15)  Vitaly Janelt puts Brentford ahead!   Updated at 1.16pm GMT    12.44pm    13 min \u201cJust me, or does the Brentford pitch look awful?\u201d asks Steve Coleman. \u201cFaded rugby lines never help, but has the feel of a ground that\u2019s been cut with a pair of scissors.\u201d I wondered about that as well \u2013 some players look like they are running through treacle.     12.43pm    12 min Kane whips the free-kick into the wall and behind for a corner.     12.42pm    12 min \u201cRob, greetings from cold, pitch dark California,\u201d writes Mary Waltz. \u201cBoxing Day means nothing to most Americans but the return of the PL is reason enough to get up at the crack of dawn. No depression for Harry Kane, he has already left that penalty miss in the past.\u201d     12.41pm    11 min Son is cleaned out on the edge of the D by Ben Mee. This is a really good opportunity for Spurs.     12.39pm    8 min I think Harry Kane is being booed by the Brentford fans, though he hasn\u2019t been on the ball enough for me to be sure.     12.38pm    7 min Spurs are really struggling to get out. Thomas Frank will be really pleased with this start.     12.35pm    6 min Brentford have made the better start, causing Spurs a few problems with long balls and set pieces.     12.33pm    3 min Jensen\u2019s corner is flicked on at the near post and headed away crucially by Lenglet at the far. There was a player behind him who would otherwise have had a simple headed chance.  Updated at 12.34pm GMT    12.32pm    2 min Janelt plays a one-two with Toney and finds Mbeumo, whose cross hits Doherty and goes behind for the first corner.     12.31pm    1 min Peep peep! After a minute\u2019s applause for the late George Cohen, Spurs\u2019 Dejan Kulusevski gets the match under way.     12.25pm    Ready? Well tough, the players are out on the field, the Brentford fans are singing Hey Jude, and the Premier League is about to resume.     12.18pm    Antonio Conte on Harry Kane  You can have a good tournament \u2013 he played really well \u2013 but at the same time he missed an important penalty. This is football. It\u2019s important now to move on and focus on Tottenham.      12.09pm    Thomas Frank, who has signed a new five-year contract at Brentford, is chatting to the Amazon Prime team. He\u2019s as jaunty and engaging as ever, and yes they did ask him about Ivan Toney: \u201cIf there\u2019s one player I believe is mentally strong enough to deal with everything around him, it\u2019s Ivan. He\u2019s a remarkable character.\u201d  Updated at 12.10pm GMT    11.58am    \u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry about Toney\u2019s state of mind,\u201d says Ian Copestake. \u201cHe will clearly back himself.\u201d And there it is!     11.58am         11.50am    Previously on Premier League      11.50am    \u201cDon\u2019t you think the 1966 World Cup final is a contender for the best final?\u201d says Francis Mead. \u201cI\u2019m old enough to have watched it live. It had a dramatic last-minute equaliser, an incredibly dramatic last-minute goal sealing the win, and also the still (rightly) contested third goal by England, as well as a hattrick. Maybe the 2022 is the best - but I think 1966 is in there, along with 1954 if you like.\u201d Yes, fair point. It is, in the parlance of our time, in the conversation along with 1930, 1938, 1950, 1954, 1986 and 2022.  Updated at 11.53am GMT    11.45am   Team news: Kane starts  Harry Kane and Ivan Perisic are among the World Cup players who start for Spurs. Hugo Lloris is on the bench and Cristian Romero is still on the pi- sorry, is still celebrating. Brentford make one change from the team that beat Manchester City six weeks ago \u2013 Christian Norgaard replaces Frank Onyeka in midfield. Brentford (3-5-2) Raya; Zanka, Pinnock, Mee; Roerslev, Jensen, Norgaard, Janelt, Henry; Mbeumo, Toney.Substitutes: Cox, Goode, Jansson, Dasilva, Wissa, Damsgaard, Canos, Ghoddos, Lewis-Potter. Spurs (3-4-3) Forster; Tanganga, Dier, Lenglet; Doherty, Bissouma, Hojbjerg, Perisic; Kulusevski, Kane, Son.Substitutes: Lloris, Sanchez, Royal, Davies, Skipp, Sessegnon, Sarr, White, Gil. Referee David Coote.  Updated at 12.27pm GMT    11.30am   Preamble  Well this feels a bit weird. Eight days after the greatest World Cup final in at least 68 years, the Premier League is back (baby). We start with Brentford v Tottenham Hotspur, or 10th v 4th if you\u2019re reliant on the league table for a bit of context as you\u2019ve completely forgotten what happened before the World Cup. In fact, these teams finished part one of the 2022-23 season with memorable victories: Brentford won 2-1 at Manchester City, and Spurs thrice came from behind to beat Leeds 4-3. Ivan Toney scored both goals in the win at the Etihad, and all eyes will be on him and Harry Kane today. Both were the subject of unwelcome headlines during the World Cup: Toney for allegedly having 262 flutters too many, Kane for missing a late penalty in England\u2019s quarter-final defeat to France. Funny how things work out. In 2018, Kane won the Golden Boot but didn\u2019t play particularly well. In Qatar he was superb, the best centre forward in the tournament in ma opinion, but all anyone will remember is the shocking moment when he launched his second penalty over the bar. England players have reacted to penalty trauma in a variety of ways. Stuart Pearce went on the rampage, scoring a career-best 16 goals in 1990-91; Gareth Southgate went into a funk; David Batty got on with life as if nothing had happened. Adversity stimulates people in different ways. We\u2019ll soon get our first insight into Kane\u2019s state of mind \u2013 and Toney\u2019s. Kick off 12.30pm.  Updated at 11.58am GMT "

                    "body": "A little before 8pm local time in Melbourne on Sunday, Adil Rashid stepped up to bowl the 12th over of Pakistan\u2019s innings. The 11th, bowled by Liam Livingstone, had just been swatted for 16. After a sluggish start, Pakistan were 84 for two and the tide of the game was beginning to turn. It was at this point, in the white heat of a World Cup final, that Rashid bowled a wicket maiden. We should probably talk a little more about this. Except it\u2019s not that easy. \u201cThe Wicket Maiden Heard Around The World\u201d doesn\u2019t really roll off the tongue. It doesn\u2019t have a score or number attached to it. You can\u2019t capture the brilliance of that over in a statue or a photograph. It ended not with wild celebrations or even a salute to the crowd, but a pat on the back and a medium-size round of applause.  You can try to break the over down into its constituent parts \u2013 the beautifully disguised googly that fooled Babar Azam into a return catch, the wicked variations in flight that prevented Iftikhar Ahmed from getting off strike. You could point out the statistical significance of the over in the context of Pakistan\u2019s innings, perhaps even assign some glitzy, data-derived metric like Total Match HyperImpact. But none of this would really grasp the greatness of what Rashid managed. In large part this is because the way we think and talk and write and feel about cricket is still essentially informed by its past. Nobody bothered celebrating or memorialising wicket maidens at the inception of T20 because they were common and unremarkable in red-ball cricket. We still talk about half-centuries as if they remotely matter, sanctify \u201cpartnership-building\u201d when inefficient partnerships often loses matches. Crowds still applaud singles more than dot balls, which is probably the wrong way round. The point is that this is an entirely different sport now and perhaps the greatest achievement of this England white-ball side is in recognising it faster and more fully than anyone else. Not everything they have done is new or incendiary. But as a blueprint of where cricket might be heading, it is the best effort yet produced by an international team. This has also been a shift in mindset, one that has required shedding the decades of ingrained cultural baggage that have defined the values and mores of English cricket for generation upon generation. Namely, the idea that for an male cricketer there is only one true currency of greatness, one path to glory, and it begins with a couple of promising seasons serving your tutelage at Chelmsford or Northampton, before finally taking ownership of a smart navy jacket.  Go through this England squad and the remarkable thing is that it contains a single regular member of the red-ball team (Ben Stokes). Of the rest, 10 or 11 will probably never play a Test match again. Harry Brook will get another chance in Pakistan. Mark Wood and Chris Woakes may edge their way back, but there are no guarantees and in any case white-ball cricket has already secured their legacy. Once Stokes retires, who is England\u2019s next genuine all-format star? Will there ever be another? For a certain section of the audience, the natural reaction to this will be a certain lament. This in itself feels like a form of ingrained cultural exceptionalism. Who\u2019s going to tell Rashid (two World Cup wins) he didn\u2019t scale the pinnacle of the sport? Who\u2019s going to tell Sam Curran he has been toiling and honing his skills in an inferior form of the game? Does anyone really care if Phil Salt plays a Test match? For the new generation the divergence of the formats simply is, an immutable fact of the game. While England were celebrating in Melbourne, the brilliant 21-year-old Somerset batter Will Smeed was giving an interview to the Telegraph, announcing his retirement from first-class cricket without having played a match. And why not? He averaged 16 in second XI cricket last season. He scored a century in the Hundred. He\u2019s quite clearly good at one form of the game and not very good at the other. This isn\u2019t hard.  This is a process that began years ago under Eoin Morgan, perhaps the first England great who refused to pay lip service to Test cricket or allow it to define him. And yet for all the euphoria and ultimacy of the 2019 World Cup win, there was still a tendency to see it as something of a standalone project, a happy diversion from the real stuff (\u201cand now for the Ashes! Jason Roy, this is your time to shine!\u201d) This feels like a more tectonic shift. Of course the formats will continue to intersect. Players may go through red and white-ball phases (like Sam Billings, who has turned down next year\u2019s Indian Premier League to try to nail down an England Test place). But with split coaches and split captains, overlapping calendars and increasing specialisation, it will become increasingly hard to maintain the facade this is all the same stuff. Already there is a bubbling debate in India and Pakistan about whether greater separation is needed between their red- and white-ball sides. Australia, too, have largely resisted specialisation in favour of a core group of good, hard cricket blokes.  Meanwhile, in the greatest of ironies, it is the English who are kicking the dust off their boots, remorselessly beating a path into an uncertain future."

                    "body": "Argentina (4-1-2-3)\nEmiliano Martinez (GK) For 96 minutes the Aston Villa goalkeeper was notable only for the Argentinian flag dyed onto the side of his head. But in the 97th minute he reacted magnificently to deny Garang Kuol one-on-one and secure his country\u2019s passage. 7\nNahuel Molina (RB) Like most of Argentina\u2019s defensive-minded players Molina\u2019s job for most of the night was to keep the ball in motion and not lose concentration. Job done. 6\nCristian Romero (CB) Untroubled by Mitchell Duke\u2019s physicality and Australia\u2019s direct lines of attack but remains a surprise selection ahead of Lisandro Martinez. 6\n\nNicol\u00e1s Otamendi (CB) The veteran was busy at both ends of the pitch, defending stoutly, attempting 97 passes, and playing his part in the opening goal by providing a screen for Lionel Messi, then getting out of his captain\u2019s way. 7\nMarcos Acu\u00f1a (LB) Plenty of collisions, theatrics, and dangerous crosses in an eye-catching display from the chunky little bull down the left. Acu\u00f1a looks and plays like he was designed in a lab to fit the prototype of a South American World Cup bruiser. 7\nRodrigo De Paul (CM) Demonstrated plenty of graft in midfield to ensure his side was never bullied by Australia. It was his hustle that forced Mat Ryan into the catastrophic error that led to the second goal. 7\nEnzo Fern\u00e1ndez (CM) Just 21 years old and with only three international caps coming into the tournament, the Benfica regista was Argentina\u2019s metronome. Nobody on the field touched the ball more often, and his 100 passes were executed with 92% efficiency. The only criticism would be how safe most of those passes were, circulating play from one side to the other without offering much incision. Credited with an own goal but he could do little about the massive deflection as he charged out to block Craig Goodwin\u2019s shot. 7\n\nAlexis Mac Allister (CM) Busy and neat in the first half without taking the game by the scruff of the neck. Played his part in the opening goal, providing the two to Messi\u2019s one as the ball came infield and the legend darted towards the box. 6\nPapu G\u00f3mez (LW) The veteran was a late bolter for the squad, and then a surprise stand-in for the injured Angel Di Maria. He only lasted 50 minutes before he was sacrificed for Lisandro Martinez and a change of shape, but in that time he contributed to the opening goal by knocking the headed clearance from the corner on the volley to Messi with excellent technique. 6\n\nLionel Messi (AM) In his 1,000th professional match Messi scored his 94th goal for for his country, and his first in a World Cup knockout. The goal was of the type you see when you close your eyes and dream of Messi; a slow build-up, a quicksilver change of pace, a one-two around the box, then a side-foot into the far corner beyond the goalkeeper. Around the goal it wasn\u2019t his finest night. He looked fatigued and spent most of the game walking, but still head and shoulders the most dangerous player on the park. 8\nJuli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez (RW) The Manchester City youngster burnished his growing reputation with an energetic display that showed he will not shirk the rough and tumble. His goal ultimately proved the difference, and it was a smart finish after Ryan clumsily tried to run the ball out of his six-yard box. 7\n\nSubstitutes:\nLisandro Martinez (50) Brought on just after the break to turn a back four into a five and his inclusion was justified late on with a trademark last-ditch block to deny Aziz Behich. 7\nNicol\u00e1s Tagliafico (71) Dragged a good opportunity wide to seal the victory shortly after coming on. Didn\u2019t seem to trust his speed to get closer to goal or his technique to beat Ryan from the edge of the box. 5\nLautaro Martinez (71) How do you rate a striker who repeatedly finds himself in the right position to score but then fails to execute in front of goal? In a 20-minute cameo the Inter forward pulled off the shoulder of the last defender time and again but side-footed over with only Ryan to beat, then shot straight at the keeper, before having a deflected effort saved. 6\nGonzalo Montiel and Exequiel Palacios (80) Brought on late to secure a narrow victory. n/a\nAustralia (4-5-1)\nMat Ryan (GK) A disastrous night for Australia\u2019s captain on the occasion of his national record 10th World Cup appearance. He had little chance stopping Messi\u2019s opener, but he was badly at fault for Argentina\u2019s second, trying to dribble out of his six-yard box and succumbing to the pincer movement of De Paul and \u00c1lvarez. Some good saves late on demonstrated strength of character, but this result will weigh heavy on his head. 5\nMilo\u0161 Degenek (RB) The third of Australia\u2019s three right-backs this World Cup played his part in a robust defensive showing. His head-to-head with Acu\u00f1a was classic World Cup theatre. 6\nHarry Souttar (CB) It has been a memorable tournament for the giant centre-half and again he did not disgrace himself against storied opposition. Graham Arnold will be disappointed the Stoke City defender wasn\u2019t more of a threat from set pieces. 7\n\nKye Rowles (CB) At times this tournament the gangly central defender has looked like a juvenile giraffe coming to terms with the length of his limbs, but his partnership with Souttar held firm for most of the night. The highlight was when he stood his ground to deny Messi a sight of goal when the Argentinian was weaving his magic. The lowlight was his role playing Ryan into difficulty, from which his keeper never escaped. 6\nAziz Behich (LB) Australia\u2019s most dynamic presence, Behich was always willing to get forward from fullback, relished the scrap, and so nearly scored one of the all-time World Cup wonder goals before Martinez slid in to break Australian hearts. His industry and cross led to the clearance that allowed Goodwin to strike Australia\u2019s consolation goal, but his hot-headedness also precipitated Argentina\u2019s opener when, after squaring up to Messi on the touchline he allowed Gomez to draw a foul in a dangerous area that ultimately led to the goal. 7\nMathew Leckie (RM) As hardworking as ever but denied time and space by Argentina\u2019s control of possession. 6\nAaron Mooy (CM) So often Australia\u2019s most influential force, the Celtic schemer was below par tonight. His range of passing was limited by Argentina\u2019s territorial dominance and he was unable to hit targets from deep. As has been the case all World Cup his set-pieces were poor, preventing Souttar from capitalising on an obvious strength. 5\n\nKeanu Baccus (CM) Brought in to stiffen Australia\u2019s midfield, he was busy early on, keeping a close eye on Messi, as Australia held their own. Drifted as the game wore on and offered nothing at all in possession. The obvious player to be substituted after Argentina\u2019s second goal went in. 5\nJackson Irvine (CM) Played further forward than in the three previous matches but that didn\u2019t prevent another all-action display. He set the tone with a yellow card after just 15 minutes but never stopped trying to support Duke in attack or helping out his defence. He leaves Qatar with his reputation enhanced. 6\nRiley McGree (LM) It\u2019s hard to know what to make of McGree\u2019s tournament. Tonight he put in a shift wide on the left but failed to make any attacking impact, consistent with a World Cup full of endeavour but only glimpses of quality. Sacrificed after an hour for Goodwin, before which he sent over Australia\u2019s first corner of the month to find Souttar\u2019s forehead. 5\nMitchell Duke (CF) Chased every lost cause and got through a mountain of work as Australia\u2019s sole target up front, but never looked like threatening Argentina\u2019s defence. 5\n\nSubstitutes:\nAjdin Hrustic (58) The playmaker came into this World Cup his country\u2019s brightest prospect but injury denied him a fast start and he has never caught up. Ineffective again tonight off the bench. 5\nCraig Goodwin (58) Another Australian to leave the World Cup with his name in lights. He injected pace as a substitute and gambled with his speculative shot from the edge of the box that was deflected past Martinez. Another guilty of poor set-piece delivery. 6\nGarang Kuol (72) Australia\u2019s youngest ever male World Cup performer had the country on its feet in the 97th minute and only the keeper to beat, but Martinez was too big and strong to deny the fairytale ending. 5\nJamie Maclaren (72) Made little impression off the bench. This side is not set up for a nippy No 9 who plays in behind. 5\nFran Kara\u010di\u0107 (72) Did his job after coming on, including a nice interception to deny Martinez. 6"

                    "body": "EU ministers have agreed a plan to cap the price of gas, ending months of argument over how to handle the cost of soaring energy prices after Russia cut gas supplies to Europe. \u201cMission accomplished,\u201d said the Czech minister for trade and industry, Jozef S\u00edkela, who chaired talks between energy ministers, adding that negotiations had not been easy. A gas price cap will kick in if prices on the main European gas exchange, the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF), exceed \u20ac180 (\u00a3157) a megawatt-hour for three consecutive working days, far lower than the European Commission\u2019s original proposal of \u20ac275 a MWh, which had been derided by cap-supporting countries as a joke. Belgium, Spain and Poland had been leading the charge for a price cap below \u20ac200, amid surging energy prices. However, in a concession to countries that feared energy suppliers would send their gas supplies to China or elsewhere when faced with a European price cap, another condition must also be met. The \u20ac180 cap will only be triggered when the TTF price is \u20ac35 higher than a global reference price for liquefied natural gas (LNG) for the same three successive working days.  This compromise persuaded Germany, the EU\u2019s biggest gas consumer but a sceptic over price caps, to back the plans. Berlin was also won over by a change to a legal text on permits for new energy grids, rewritten with the aim of speeding up the deployment of renewable energy. Other sceptics were not convinced, though: the Netherlands and Austria abstained, while Hungary voted against the plans. Following the deal, Poland\u2019s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, tweeted: \u201cThis means the end of market manipulation by Russia and its company Gazprom.\u201d S\u00edkela described the outcome as a \u201cdynamic cap\u201d, adding: \u201cThis proposal was never purely about the cap level; it was always about making sure that the mechanism would not jeopardise the security of supply or stability of the financial markets of the European Union.\u201d The EU energy commissioner, Kadri Simson, tweeted: \u201cWe now have an effective mechanism to prevent that #EU pays excessive high prices for gas that are not reflecting world prices.\u201d The cap can be triggered from 15 February 2023 and will apply for one year. Ministers also agreed that it could be switched off if the cap triggered risks to security of supply, financial stability or the \u201crisks of increased gas demand\u201d, according to a statement from the EU council of ministers. The agreement came after Qatar warned that the EU\u2019s response to a corruption scandal at the European parliament that has implicated Doha could \u201cnegatively affect\u201d security and energy cooperation. However, a Qatari diplomat later walked back the threat, telling the Financial Times that the country was not threatening to cut LNG supplies to Europe. Qatar has denied any involvement in the cash-for-influence scandal that has led Belgian police to charge four people with corruption, including a European parliament vice-president. In the wake of Russia\u2019s decision to cut gas supplies to Europe, the EU has been scrambling to find alternative energy suppliers, including in Qatar, the world\u2019s largest exporter of LNG. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said the price cap was an attack on market pricing and unacceptable, Russia\u2019s Interfax news agency reported."

                    "body": "The England head coach, Jon Lewis, will have been able to rest easy over his turkey and mince pies after his opening tour in charge concluded last week with a clean-sweep against West Indies in three one-day internationals and five Twenty20s \u2013 including wiping them out for 43 in the final match, their lowest total in T20 internationals. With Heather Knight (hip injury) and Nat Sciver (mental health break) both making successful returns, it has proved a dream first assignment for Lewis. England are back to winning ways after the disappointment of a medal-less Commonwealth Games and a 3-0 ODI defeat against India in September; while Knight has been effusive about the psychological impact of the new coach on her team. \u201cI\u2019m really enjoying working with Jon,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s come from the men\u2019s game, which brings a fresh pair of eyes. Often when someone comes from the men\u2019s game, they see things slightly differently \u2013 they don\u2019t know as much about the women\u2019s game, but they also bring a fresh perspective and fresh ideas, which has reinvigorated the group.\u201d  On the other hand, this West Indies team are a shadow of the side that won the T20 World Cup in 2016. Far more formidable challenges lie ahead for England in 2023 \u2013 a T20 World Cup in South Africa in February will be followed by an Ashes series starting in June. Lewis, who has focused on encouraging the team to play \u201cfearlessly\u201d, says that holding on to that approach will be key to success in 2023. \u201cWhen the pressure ramps up and you get bigger games, and you are put under more pressure by the opposition, the ability to trust that the way that we\u2019re trying to play our cricket will work \u2013 that\u2019s the biggest challenge.\u201d With West Indies bowled out for 165, 118 and 105 in the three ODIs, and looking poor in the field to boot, the tour above all laid bare the glaring gap between the haves and the have-nots in international women\u2019s cricket. England are the second-best resourced side in the world; by February, there will be almost 100 female professional cricketers in this country. Meanwhile West Indies have no domestic professionals, and are struggling to retain their best talent at the highest level. The leading all-rounder Deandra Dottin announced her retirement from international cricket in August, preferring to ply her trade in franchise leagues around the world.  If this is a vision of the future, it is a worrying one that could lead to more one-sided encounters similar to the one we have just witnessed in the Caribbean. For England, who have no matches scheduled before the World Cup in February, the more immediate risk is that they go into that tournament under-baked. \u201cWe haven\u2019t massively been challenged, which is a bit of a shame,\u201d Knight said. \u201cIn terms of growing as a side, you always want to be under pressure because it sharpens you up.\u201d By contrast, England\u2019s most dangerous rivals in the World Cup \u2013 India and Australia \u2013 have recently concluded a fiercely competitive T20 series in which both sides regularly scored more than 180; albeit on better batting wickets than England have enjoyed in Antigua and Barbados. One player who will be critical to Lewis\u2019s plans for 2023 is Alice Capsey, who embodies the aggressive outlook he is trying to promote. England will be desperate for her to return in time for the World Cup, after she sustained a broken collarbone in the field during the first ODI and subsequently underwent shoulder reconstruction surgery. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be quite tight [to get her fit],\u201d Knight said. The 17-year-old fast bowler Freya Kemp was also sent home mid-tour and has been ruled out of the World Cup with a confirmed stress fracture in her back, while Issy Wong played only one game because of a quad niggle. But Lewis is confident nonetheless that his fast-bowling stocks are overflowing, going into a tournament that is likely to be played on fast, bouncy wickets. \u201cThe fast-bowling group is probably the trickiest one to select,\u201d he said. \u201cKatherine [Brunt] has done fantastically well on the tour. She\u2019s been a real leader, she\u2019s been great sharing her knowledge around the group. Lauren [Bell] has had a really good tour.\u201d Bell, who had played only two T20 internationals before the Caribbean tour, was tasked with opening the bowling alongside Brunt in three of the T20s and claimed a career-best four for 12 in the third. Her prodigious swing means she is seen by England as the natural successor to Anya Shrubsole and it would be surprising if she did not feature in Lewis\u2019s starting XI when England next take to the field. That will be for their opening World Cup fixture, on 11 February. While the stakes will be higher, the opposition will be familiar \u2013 they are scheduled to play West Indies."

                    "body": "The eruption at Federation Square said it all. As far as feedback goes, pyrotechnics at 11pm more than 10,000km away is a decent barometer. \u201cI wish I was there as well,\u201d said Jackson Irvine. The midfielder is a Melbourne boy and a Socceroos fan from way back. As a kid in 2006 he was in Kaiserslautern to witness his country\u2019s first win at a World Cup \u2013 that famous 3-1 result against Japan. Four years later he watched the 2-1 defeat of Serbia.\nThe wait since then has been interminable. It has lasted longer than the decade he has played for the national team. Back in Australia, \u201cthe first win in 12 years\u201d was the ubiquitous headline in print and on the airwaves. In Qatar, journalists showed Irvine footage of the wild scenes at Fed Square. At first he couldn\u2019t speak.\n\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d he eventually said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to even \u2026 that just looks absolutely incredible. I hope every single one of them has had a night they\u2019ll remember for the rest of their lives like I\u2019ve had as a fan as well. It\u2019s special.\u201d\n\nIrvine had just finished espousing the need to keep the significance of the result under wraps, to let it \u201cbubble under the surface a little bit\u201d but not \u201cboil over\u201d given a pivotal meeting with Denmark awaits in four days.\nBut he had also just left the Al Janoub Stadium pitch, where everything was boiling over. The full-time whistle, which finally put an end to the late Tunisian onslaught, pulled a plug on the tension and sparked madcap celebrations among the players. Even the introverted Aaron Mooy had his mouth wide open and arms outstretched.\nMartin Boyle hobbled out on his crutches, his torn ACL keeping him from playing but not from fulfilling his new, self-assigned role as \u201cofficial vibes manager\u201d. Graham Arnold slung an arm over his shoulder as the squad formed a circle around the pair, then told them all to celebrate now and then hit the dressing room and get to bed because they hadn\u2019t \u201cdone nothing\u201d yet.\nBy \u201cnothing\u201d he meant make the knockout stages, a very live possibility after France\u2019s defeat of Denmark later on Saturday, which leaves Australia second in Group D with one match to play. To progress would break another drought \u2013 this one 16 years old, dating back to the golden generation\u2019s passage to the round of 16, where they lost to Italy under circumstances still controversial to this day.\n\nIs it actually possible? Is it worth even hoping? The Socceroos do live life on the edge, leave their runs late. The past two qualifications came via the playoffs, doing their best work under pressure with it all the line.\nThat was the case in the playoffs for Russia 2018 under Ange Postecoglou, a goalpost that saved them against Syria before a hard-fought 0-0 away draw in a hostile Honduras set them on the path to a home-leg triumph. It happened again five months ago when, under Graham Arnold, they won those unwinnable playoffs against the United Arab Emirates and Peru.\nAnd this clash, with its antagonistic atmosphere and dirty, hard-nosed football, did have a bit of Peru about it. \u201cIt was pretty similar,\u201d said Jamie Maclaren, who made his World Cup debut off the bench. \u201cYou know, when they showed up with 15,000 Peruvians and you\u2019re up against it from minute one, sometimes when you\u2019re the underdog and the fans are against you, it actually can work in your favour. It did today \u2013 we silenced them, Tunisia are a fantastic team. From minute zero to 96 they were at us and we stayed resolute.\u201d\n\nThis performance was the antithesis of that against France. It had Mitchell Duke, near-invisible in the opener, ever-present and with a goal as reward. Mooy, too, was vastly improved, his distribution vital and well-timed tackles a saviour in the final minutes under the pump.\nWell-timed tackles, of course, are now synonymous with Harry Souttar, who had an answer to every question in his path and even some that weren\u2019t. Three senior matches into his return from ACL rehab and the Stoke centre-half was already confident enough for a sliding intervention which thwarted a would-be equaliser and might well pique the interest of the Premier League clubs who were circling before his injury last year.\n\u201cWe had prepared for what they were going to be like, what the atmosphere was going to be like,\u201d Souttar said. \u201cObviously we know what their fans are like, and we know it will be more of a long-ball game so we had to win that battle first. I\u2019m just so pleased. But we\u2019ve won one game; we\u2019ve still got a huge, huge game to play.\u201d\nThat may be the case. but for now they have this. This standout display to rival all the others in recent memory. To let the records show that this inexperienced team, with those young players so unfamiliar to much of the country they represent, replicated the stuff of the established legends they succeed. Finally."

                    "body": "Liverpool v Chelsea, Carabao Cup final, Wembley \u2013 27 February 24mm lens 1/1600 f4 ISO 4000  A match that ended 0-0 after extra time was enlivened by an extraordinary penalty shoot-out. Every outfield player from both sides scored from the spot so it came down to the goalkeepers. Caoimhin Kelleher scored for Liverpool and then Kepa Arrizabalaga blasted his kick over the bar. I was glad I had a remote camera behind the net to record one angle, while I was standing on the other side of the goal getting a completely different shot. Chelsea v Newcastle, Premier League, Stamford Bridge \u2013 13 March 560mm lens 1/2000 f4 ISO 1250  After the Russian invasion of Ukraine and because of his close relationship with the Kremlin, Roman Abramovich had all his assets frozen in the UK and was forced to sell Chelsea. The day before this game against Newcastle, he was officially banned from being a director and uncertainty swirled around Stamford Bridge. Before the match I knew I wanted to make use of this banner in the Matthew Harding Stand. I waited for the right moment when the ball was in exactly the spot I needed. Cheltenham Festival, day two \u2013 16 March 62mm lens 1/1000 f2.8 ISO 640  The second day of the Festival suffered from appalling conditions \u2013 blowing a gale and pouring with rain. It was particularly bad for the poor jockeys. After the Coral Cup, a hurdle race with a big field where the mud was really flying, I went to the unsaddling enclosure to photograph the jockeys walking back to the weighing room. Sam Ewing from Ireland gave me such an intent stare, the definition on his face where his goggles had been easy to see. The 167th Boat Race, London \u2013 3 April 185mm lens 1/2000 f5.6 ISO 1600  It had been nearly a decade since I last photographed the Oxford v Cambridge boat races. I like it because it\u2019s so different, a highly unusual event that has a remarkable hold on the British sporting landscape. It also offers, especially for the winning coxes, a very wet way to celebrate. The best view of the crews throwing the cox into the water is from a balcony at the boathouse where they finish. This gave me a clear angle to see Jack Tottem of Oxford spinning through the air. Tyson Fury v Dillion Whyte, Wembley Stadium \u2013 23 April 600mm lens 1/1250 f4 ISO 10000  During the early rounds of their world heavyweight title fight, a member of Fury\u2019s backroom staff appeared to throw some sort of liquid at both fighters. This fight was an occasion where I was very thankful to modern camera technology. The lighting around the ring was appalling, incredibly dark with a horrible cast. A few years ago, it wouldn\u2019t have been possible to get a decent frame in those conditions \u2013 now things are very different. Liverpool v Villarreal, Champions League semi-final first leg, Anfield \u2013 27 April 33mm lens 1/1250 f9 ISO 800  The Liverpool team bus made its way slowly through the crowds outside the King Harry pub in Anfield. It has become quite a tradition in Liverpool for fans to line the streets like this before a big European match. The smoke from the flares is great for pictures, but only up to a point \u2013 if there are too many it becomes almost impossible to see anything. Round One, eSkootr Championship, Printworks, London \u2013 13 May 400mm lens 1/1250 f2.8 ISO 5000  I love getting to see a new sport and deciding out how to photograph it. I was invited to see the first round of a new global series of scooter racing that was being held in an old print works. The electrically charged machines whizzed around a circuit that weaved in and out of the building. There was one point on the track where I tried a photo technique I like to think of as a \u201creverse silhouette.\u201d It was where the scooters passed from the bright sunlight outside into a dark warehouse. By exposing for the inside, which also happened to be correct for the face of the rider, it blew out the background to make it almost white. This picture shows Luke Hedger, normally a superbike rider, on his way to finish first in qualifying on the opening day of the competition. Manchester City v Aston Villa, Premier League, Etihad Stadium \u2013 22 May 24mm lens 1/1600 f4.5 ISO 1250  Needing a win to claim the title, City were 2-0 down deep into the second half. Remarkably they scored three goals in just over five minutes to win the match and finish the season a point ahead of Liverpool. This picture of Ilkay Gundogan scoring the goal that won his side the Premier League was taken by one of two remote cameras I had positioned either side of that goal. For big games like this I often use two remote cameras, usually one at each end. At half-time I decided to gamble and put both of them behind the net City were about to attack. Luckily for me it paid off. Scotland v Ukraine, World Cup playoff semi-final, Hampden Park \u2013 1 June 120mm lens 1/2000 f5.6 ISO 800  Quite possibly the most emotionally charged game of football I\u2019ve ever covered. The Ukraine national football team walked out draped in their national flags to play their first game since the Russian invasion began. I wondered if they could perform under so much pressure. It turned out they were inspired, the motivation of representing their war-torn country driving them to a 3-1 victory. The LIV Invitational, Centurion Golf Club, Hemel Hempstead \u2013 9 June 145mm lens 1/2500 f5.6 ISO 400  Ian Poulter holing out at the 18th on the day civil war broke out in professional golf. The inaugural LIV tournament, with prize money of $25m, was the first in a breakaway series that lured some of the top names in the sport away from the traditional tours. It created a huge schism in the sport that remains unresolved. For me, this day was all about trying to find an image that hinted to a wider issue rather than who shot the best score. England v New Zealand, second Test, Trent Bridge \u2013 14 June 840mm lens 1/2500 f5.6 ISO 800  Jonny Bairstow scored the second-fastest century scored by an Englishman in Test cricket. His remarkable innings of 136 off 92 balls helped transform the match and led England to a magnificent victory. It was a prime example of the new positive brand of Test cricket introduced by the new partnership of Brendon McCullum and Ben Stokes. Elena Rybakina wins the women\u2019s singles, Wimbledon \u2013 9 July 400mm lens 1/1600 f4 ISO 400  It caused a major fuss when the All England Club decided to ban Russian and Belarusian players from competing in the tournament because of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. So it was ironic that the tournament ended with the Russia-born Rybakina being handed the Venus Rosewater Dish. Even though she switched her nationality to Kazakhstan in 2018, she still lives in Moscow. On a sunny day, the famous trophy turns out to be a lovely reflector of light and so it proved again here. The 150th Open Championship, St Andrews \u2013 14 July 115mm lens 1/2000 f9 ISO 800  There is nowhere else like it, a unique stretch of land that makes up the 1st and 18th holes at the Royal &amp; Ancient Golf Club. I never tire of this scene looking back towards the famous clubhouse from the top of a grandstand by the 17th green. On a beautiful sunny evening, at the end of the first day of this celebratory tournament, it felt even more special to be there. England v Germany, Euro 2022 final, Wembley Stadium \u2013 31 July 140mm lens 1/2000 f4 ISO 2500  Some days the luck goes for you, some days it doesn\u2019t. The most memorable image from the day the Lionesses won the Euros is the one of Chloe Kelly ripping off her top and waving it above her head after she scored the winning goal. Unfortunately for me she did that while running in the opposite direction. I did manage to get a nice clear frame of her vital goal in extra time, at least. 560mm lens 1/1600 f4 ISO 2500  As the final whistle blew at Wembley, the scenes of celebration among England players and fans were just fantastic. It felt like the whole stadium exploded with joy. I tried to focus on the nearest player to me. Thankfully, it was the charismatic Alessia Russo, who had become such a star during the tournament. She didn\u2019t let me down. Adam Peaty, men\u2019s 50m breaststroke final, Commonwealth Games, Birmingham \u2013 2 August 400mm lens 1/2000 f4 ISO 4000  Two days earlier, Peaty suffered perhaps the biggest shock in Commonwealth Games history as he finished fourth in the men\u2019s 100m breaststroke final. He came roaring back in the 50m to prove his doubters wrong. Peaty thumped his chest, punched the water and bellowed out a loud roar. No wonder he has a lion tattoo on his shoulder. Men\u2019s pole vault final, Commonwealth Games, Birmingham \u2013 6 August 28mm lens 1/2000 f6.3 ISO 2500  We were lucky with the weather during the Games in Birmingham. On one such beautiful evening I managed to get access to the infield to photograph the final stages of the pole vault final. The best of the sunset lasted a few minutes and there was only one attempt, this one by England\u2019s Harry Coppell, while the sky was orange. England v South Africa, third Test, The Oval \u2013 10 September 29mm lens 1/2500 f10 ISO 400  England\u2019s lower order were batting late in the day when the ground was suddenly lit up by a ray of sunshine. It seemed weird as we were surrounded by dark, menacing skies. In between overs, I quickly moved up to a vantage point not far from where I was shooting the game. I\u2019m glad I did. Roger Federer retires, Laver Cup, O<sub>2</sub> Arena \u2013 24 September 400mm lens 1/2000 f2.8 ISO 4000  It had gone midnight when Federer lost his final professional match, a doubles contest with Rafael Nadal against Jack Sock and Frances Tiafoe. It was during one of the post-match tributes that, for a few brief seconds, Federer held hands with Nadal. The two tennis greats were sobbing away \u2013 it was an amazing and touching moment between longtime rivals and great friends. England v Germany, Nations League, Wembley \u2013 26 September 70mm lens 1/1250 f4 ISO 3200  As a tribute to the late Queen, the two teams lined up on the centre circle as the lights were dimmed and a spotlight trained on the centre of the pitch. It was England\u2019s first match since the monarch\u2019s death in mid-September. Thousands of phone flashlights illuminated the background and the stadium fell silent. It was a very powerful and moving moment. Claressa Shields v Savannah Marshall, O<sub>2</sub> Arena \u2013 15 October 600mm lens 1/1250 f4 ISO 8000  October\u2019s all-female card was a real breakthrough night for women\u2019s boxing. The arena was packed and the headline acts didn\u2019t disappoint. Shields and Marshall, who before the fight had openly expressed their dislike for each other, put on a great fight. Shields produced a fantastic performance to win convincingly. Ondine Achampong, world artistic gymnastics championships, Liverpool \u2013 30 October 43mm lens 1/2000 f2.8 ISO 5000 multiple exposure  One of the reasons I love shooting gymnastics is that it opens up the opportunities to be a bit more creative. This image is a multiple exposure created in camera from nine frames. Normally for this sort of picture I would look for the cleanest background and keep the camera very still. However, after a few moments of trial and error, I thought I would try to create a different effect by moving my framing while shooting. Harry Kane, England v France, World Cup quarter-final, Qatar \u2013 10 December 560mm lens 1/1600 f4 ISO 4000  The dejected England captain looks to the sky just seconds before the referee blows the final whistle at the Al Bayt Stadium. It\u2019s the realisation that his missed penalty a few minutes earlier was going to be so costly. To try and show his face clearer and separate him more from the background I had quickly put on a converter on my lens a minute before this shot. Lionel Messi, Argentina v France, World Cup final, Qatar \u2013 18 December 35mm lens 1/1250 f4 ISO 3200  This was the moment I had dreamed of before the final. I think all the photographers there knew of the famous Maradona pictures, being chaired around the pitch while holding the trophy, from Mexico 1986 and I think all of them, like me, were hoping for something similar for Messi. For quite a while after the trophy presentation it seemed nothing was going to happen and I was getting a bit fed up. Friends, family and Salt Bae were on the pitch, nothing was organised andit was a bit of a mess. I had positioned myself behind the goal where the World Cup was won to see various people cutting up the net with scissors. I felt like this was where something could happen, because none of the hardcore Argentina fans had left the stands. A couple of the players hopped up on to the cross bar. I started to photograph them. All of a sudden, a crowd swept through the goal and there he was, almost right in front of me, on Sergio Ag\u00fcero\u2019s shoulders and carrying the trophy. It was pandemonium. I was right next to the advertising boards and got crushed by the weight of photographers and TV crews pushing up behind me, everyone was desperate for the shot. Even though it didn\u2019t last long, I don\u2019t think I will ever forget it \u2013 the crowning moment for the king of modern football."

                    "body": "Arsenal have signed the Netherlands midfielder Victoria Pelova from Ajax. The 23-year-old has been described by her new manager, Jonas Eidevall, as \u201cone of the most exciting young players in the game\u201d and takes the place in the squad of Jordan Nobbs, who has joined Aston Villa. Pelova has 31 caps and was a member of the Netherlands squad that reached the final of the 2019 Women\u2019s World Cup. She was also selected for the Tokyo Olympics and for last year\u2019s European Championship.  The player joined Ajax from ADO Den Haag in 2019 and leaves after scoring 11 goals in 66 appearances. Her debut could come in a home game on Sunday week against the WSL leaders, Chelsea. Arsenal are three points behind in second place with a game in hand. \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic news that we\u2019ve signed Victoria,\u201d Eidevall said. \u201cI think she\u2019s one of the most exciting young players in the game and she will bring added dynamism and energy to our midfield.\u201d Pelova\u2019s Netherlands colleague Vivianne Miedema is among her new teammates, though the striker faces a long period out with a knee injury. \u201cI\u2019ve always admired this club and dreamt of following in the footsteps of some of the great Dutch players who have worn the shirt,\u201d said Pelova. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to get going.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 6 January 2023. Due to an agency captioning error, an earlier version misidentified Arsenal\u2019s Kim Little as Katie McCabe."

                    "body": "Australia loves an underdog. Think Lionel Rose, Kieren Perkins and Samantha Stosur. Steven Bradbury in 2002. Paul Keating in 1993 (yes, politics is sport). In football, the underdog is frequently described as \u201cspirited\u201d or \u201cplucky\u201d, or some other mildly patronising term of encouragement. These are often reserved for a losing team, the \u201cminnows\u201d who could not defy their minnow status.\nSimilar lexicon surrounded the Socceroos at the start of the 2022 World Cup, before they had even played a match. This was just as much the case within Australia. According to former goalkeeping great, Mark Bosnich, they were not just underdogs but \u201ccomplete underdogs\u201d. He thus proclaimed their underdog-iness absolute.\n\nIf conceding four goals to France confirmed this, then the subsequent defeat of Tunisia shifted the Socceroos ever-so-slightly down the underdog-ometer. Nevertheless, the general sentiment remains. To beat Denmark would be, as it were, a win for the underdog, and it is so easy to get on board with that. To witness an upset on Wednesday would feel sweeter because it was unexpected, because superior opposition were taken down and the natural order disrupted.\nThis is, of course, only the external view, and athletes have spoken before about how the underdog mindset can be harnessed to competitive advantage. Craig Goodwin, who scored Australia\u2019s opener against France and assisted Mitchell Duke\u2019s goal against Tunisia, indicated the playing group thrives off it.\n\u201cEvery Australian team in history has been underestimated,\u201d Goodwin said. \u201cThat will always be the case from where we are, it\u2019ll always be the case in the future.\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that I think helps us, and something we relish, being the underdog. I think every Australian sporting team relishes that, and we are no different. We believe in ourselves and what we\u2019re doing, and we will fight until the very end to get the result against Denmark and try to put our names up in lights, and do the nation proud.\u201d\n\nThe other driving force behind the Socceroos is \u201cAussie DNA\u201d, a hereditary material invented by Graham Arnold before the qualifying playoffs. The very idea is ambiguous and, in many other settings within modern Australian society, problematic. But Graham Arnold is not a social scientist, nor is he a geneticist. He is a football manager, with a mandate to impel his side to perform.\nMore importantly, the current iteration of this national team is comprised of players with heritages including Bosnian, Croatian, Turkish-Cypriot, South African and South Sudanese, and all have vocalised belief in Aussie DNA, which Awer Mabil has described as \u201ca togetherness\u201d.\n\u201cNot many believed in us but we always believed that we would be here, it was just a matter of finding whatever way,\u201d said Mabil, one of three South Sudanese refugees in the team. \u201cBut I think us Aussies, we like the hard way. So I would say grit, that\u2019s the DNA we have \u2013 never giving in.\u201d\nSupporting the underdog is not a concept unique to Australia. It has underpinned Hollywood film scripts for as long as the memory serves. Perhaps a key difference lies in the outcome: Australia\u2019s support is not conditional on victory. To have tried and failed is still a triumph of sorts because the attitude was there, if not the capacity.\nSimilarly, if the Socceroos do not do enough against Denmark to advance to the knockout stages of this World Cup, they will still have achieved more than anticipated. If they do make it, they will not have done a Bradbury to get there. Denmark\u2019s manager has already confirmed as much.\n\n\u201cAustralia fight with might, driven on by fantastic team spirit,\u201d Kasper Hjulmand said after his side\u2019s loss to France on Saturday. \u201cIt will be a hard match. It will be a close match. We\u2019ll do everything we can to set it up properly and to try and win.\u201d\nHis opposition, meanwhile, will set up to try and upset the status quo.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be here to just experience the World Cup,\u201d Goodwin said. \u201cWe want to go as far as we can and do the best we possibly can, and we believe that we can qualify for the knockout stages. That\u2019s what we will be preparing for.\u201d"

                    "body": "  10.32am   Match report  France flyhalf Caroline Drouin missed a last-gasp penalty as defending champions New Zealand claimed a 25-24 win in a classic at Eden Park on Saturday and set up a blockbuster Women\u2019s Rugby World Cup final against England. With a shot awarded in front after prop Santo Taumata was yellow-carded for a high tackle, Drouin shanked her last-minute kick left as the Black Ferns made a great escape in front of a roaring crowd. Down 17-10 at half-time, the hosts charged into the lead through tries to Ruby Tui and Theresa Fitzpatrick and were well placed as France went a woman down with a yellow card for loose forward Safi N\u2019Diaye for another high tackle in the 70th minute. No 8 Romane Menager scored a brace of tries in a powerhouse display, pulling the French within a point with 14 minutes left.  But Drouin\u2019s late miss sealed their fate. France inside centre Gabrielle Vernier declined to blame Drouin, saying the team could have won earlier. \u201cWe are so proud of us today,\u201d she said. \u201cWe should have been better all the game, we should have been better in defence.\u201d New Zealand, winners of five of the last six World Cups, meet England in a repeat of the last final in 2017. England held off a spirited Canada 26-19 in the earlier semi-final at Eden Park. \u201cIt was an unbelievable ending, really,\u201d New Zealand coach Wayne Smith said. \u201cI thought it was gone, but it wasn\u2019t gone. It\u2019s there and we\u2019ve got a chance next week.\u201d New Zealand saw off a fierce, 17-phase assault on their try-line in the opening minutes but the pressure finally told as Menager crashed over at the left post in the 23rd minute.The French defence was brutal and Vernier was lucky not to draw a card after lifting winger Tui in a punishing tackle. France finally conceded after Drouin kicked the ball out on the full after the half-hour mark, giving New Zealand a scrum in front of the posts. Fly-half Ruahei Demant flung the ball wide to Stacey Fluhler who streamed over near the left corner to fire up the crowd. Full-back Renee Holmes\u2019s conversion levelled the match at 10-10 but the French came again, with Vernier bursting over by the left post on the stroke of half-time.  The match went up a notch as Holmes sent the French defence scrambling with a deft chip forward four minutes after the re-start. Tui won a sprint against Emilie Boulard, toed the ball out of the full-back\u2019s grasp and chased it down for a try just before the dead-ball line. Though Holmes missed the conversion and a long-range penalty a few minutes later, the Black Ferns\u2019 running game was now in top gear as the French wearied. Lock Maiakawanakaulani Roos carried the hosts to two metres from their posts and Fitzpatrick barged over to snatch the lead for New Zealand near the hour-mark. Demant slotted the conversion and a penalty to stretch the lead to eight points but Menager set up a grandstand finish as she pounded through a nest of Black Ferns for her second try. Further drama was to come as Taumata crashed into hooker Agathe Sochat, the high tackle, spotted by the television match official, directly in front of the posts. From about 30 metres out, Drouin\u2019s shot went well wide, leaving France in agony as Black Ferns scrumhalf Kendra Cocksedge booted the ball out and home fans rejoiced. Reuters     9.03am    Thank you so much for joining me for these two incredible semi-finals. We will see the highly anticipated final between New Zealand and England which was tipped ahead of the tournament. It\u2019s an impossible one to call and it is set to be an absolute thriller. Speaking of exciting matches, these two semis were alright weren\u2019t they? The understatement of the century. If you want to recap or get up to date with all the action from them, read the report below. Have a great week and I\u2019ll see you back here for the final next Saturday!      8.58am    Look at the precision on this Tui try:      8.53am    Looking back at the England highlights and it feels like the game was played ages ago after the thriller between New Zealand and France! Feel free to drop me any assessments of either match via Twitter or email.     8.49am    What we have learned from that game is that New Zealand do have chinks in their armour. But so do England. It is going to be a huge match in front of a massive crowd at Eden Park!     8.44am    New Zealand player Sarah Hirini told ITV: \u201cWhat the heck even happened in that game? Absolutely amazing, I\u2019m just so proud\u2026 They are one of the best defensive teams I have ever faced.\u201d On the crowd: \u201cWe have some tough training and competitions and they push us to the end.\u201d And on England: \u201cThey are going to be tough, they are favourites in this competition, there is no doubt about it\u2026 biggest game of my life. I can\u2019t wait!\u201d     8.41am    Just look how close France were to the final:      8.37am    New Zealand\u2019s head coach Wayne Smith said: \u201cIt was an unbelievable ending. I thought we were jittery at the start\u2026 We needed to get the ball in behind them and I won\u2019t tell you the other tactics! And on the crowd: \u201cIt was brought back 2011 [when the All Blacks hosted']. We have another chance next week.\u201d     8.31am    New Zealand co-captain Demant said: \u201cI\u2019m proud. This is what it means [gesturing to the crowd]. I don\u2019t think people realise how much difference it makes to us on the field. Our families and our country are supporting. People are coming out to support women and women\u2019s rugby like never before.\u201d I am now crying, the pride from her!     8.29am    You have to feel for France, they were one kick away from their first World Cup final where they would have fancied their chances against England. I honestly can\u2019t believe what we have just witnessed. What an advert for the game. Knock-out Test rugby just hits different.     8.26am    I can\u2019t believe it. I really though France had done that, they did all the vital work. They won the penalty in kickable range but Drouin\u2019s kick was way wide. The pressure definitely got to her and I hope France Rugby give her huge support.     8.24am   Full-time! New Zealand 25-24 France  Oh my god, heartbreak for France. Elation for New Zealand.     8.23am    80 min: Oh my word she has biffed it. She has completely missed.     8.22am    79 min: The referee is just making sure they get the right mark in order for France to take the penalty, my nerves cannot cope! WHAT A MATCH.     8.21am   YELLOW CARD! New Zealand 25-24 France (Taumata, 79')  It\u2019s Sochat that is hit, it seems she has been hit in the head by a shoulder. My heart is beating so fast! It\u2019s a yellow card and France have the penalty! Oh my word can they steal this at the death?     8.20am    79 min: Joy Neville is looking at something here, I think they are checking a tackle by a New Zealand player \u2013 could France have one more chance? It is kickable if this is a penalty! OMG I can\u2019t cope.     8.19am    79 min: France are going to have to build this try from their own half. Boulard is the latest to take the ball forward and France then stretch the ball wide. Left to right they are trying to find a way through this defence but so far no luck. It\u2019s spilled and New Zealand reclaim it. So close France but that could be it.     8.17am    77 min: The driving maul from the line-out is halted and France are forced to put it through the hands. What a hit from Fitzpatrick and it causes New Zealand to win the penalty! This could be the turning point here as Demant clears their lines, an opportunity missed from France. France almost steal the line-out but it is New Zealand\u2019s and they are looking to close this out. But Bourdon has turned over!     8.15am    75 min: France kick upfield and win the line-out. France have the penalty from the breakdown and Drouin kicks upfield! Any penalties given away from the hosts now could result in a kickable pen. I am so nervous!     8.13am    73 min: Demant spills again but it is knocked on by France. New Zealand take it quickly but Drouin turns it over! This match is absolutely insane and breathless! Tui has it now but Menager gets the tackle. But, you guessed it, France turn it over. The brutal nature of this game is showing with multiple players receiving treatment.      8.10am    71 min: New Zealand kick to the corner but France steal the line-out! France know just how close they are to their first World Cup final, just a few points! Jacquet makes some vital metres as France look to build from deep. But Boulard is chucked into touch.     8.08am   YELLOW CARD! New Zealand 25-24 France (N'Diaye, 70')  There\u2019s contact to the head by N\u2019Diaye\u2019s shoulder and she is off! What impact will that have.  Updated at 8.09am GMT    8.06am    69 min: New Zealand win the line-out and they are on the charge. There\u2019s a TMO check for a high tackle by N\u2019diaye.     8.05am    68 min: We are back underway and Lindelauf has come off injured so Desahye is back on.     8.03am    68 min: New Zealand have the advantage as they play from their own half. But it\u2019s advantage over and Demant spills!

New Zealand 25-24 France (R Menager, 65')  France have the line-out and it is good. They put the driving maul to work but they run it and Menager is under the posts!! Oh my word this is coming down to the wire, drouin gets the extras.  Updated at 8.01am GMT    7.59am    64 min: Woodman is singing and bouncing along with the music at Eden Park, New Zealand are jumping. Fall and M Menager are off and N\u2019diaye and Jacquet are on for France. There\u2019s a break in play as Fluhler has cramp.     7.57am   PENALTY! New Zealand 25-17 France (Demant, 63')  It is over! New Zealand in full control.     7.56am    62 min: It may be a French scrum but New Zealand have the penalty! Cocksedge takes it quickly again and her team are flying here \u2013 they have the advantage here. We come back for the penalty and they point to the sticks.     7.54am    60 min: This is the first time New Zealand have been ahead all match! France will have to put in quite a shift to get the hosts to give up this lead. Leti-I\u2019iga, who is on from the bench, is inches away from collecting a cross field kick from Demant. A French scrum to come.     7.51am   TRY! New Zealand 22-17 France (Fitzpatrick, 58')  New Zealand kick to the corner and their line-out is good. They employ the maul and it is marching forward. France bring it down though and the hosts run it through the hands and Fitzpatrick comes from nowhere to crash over! Demant is on the kicking duties and slots the extras.  Updated at 7.52am GMT    7.49am    56 min: Rule is down injured here again but she is fit to continue and France are making a replacement with Deshaye off for Lindelauf. The TMO has picked something up and the penalty has been reversed as there was a tackle off the ball from France!     7.48am    55 min: It\u2019s a bit like tennis at the moment with the possession changing hands. Fall makes an incredible break but she holds on at the breakdown, Cocksedge clears and now the kicking game is in play. Fitzpatrick has it and she muscles through some defenders and New Zealand win the penalty \u2013 they play it quickly! This is breathless. France manage to turn it over through Deshaye at the breakdown, wow.  Updated at 7.48am GMT    7.46am    53 min: Apologies it was Joyeux who was down injured and she has been replaced \u2013 I shall confirm who with when I have the info. New Zealand are fighting to get out of their own half here and Cocksedge box kicks away. France are in attack now but Grisez lobs the ball infield to keep it in play. Possession exchanges hands every few seconds here!     7.43am    51 min: New Zealand steal the ball at the line-out! This second half is so end-to-end. AS I say that France turn the ball over and they are coming again. France don\u2019t release at the ruck though and New Zealand have it. There\u2019s a break in play as Sochat receives some treatment.     7.41am    50 min: Holmes misses the penalty and New Zealand remain behind. France boot the ball upfield and the hosts are soon in possession. Boulard gets the ball back in the kicking game and she slots a 50:22! Murray is on for Love for New Zealand.     7.39am    48 min: New Zealand have been fuelled by that Tui try and they are going through the hands. But the pass to Tui is loose and France come away with it, they don\u2019t have the ball for long though as New Zealand win a breakdown penalty! I\u2019m finding it hard to keep up with all the action. They have pointed to the sticks.     7.38am    47 min: Wow, this game is impossible to call! New Zealand are currently on the ball but Brendan has got in touch via Twitter: \u201cMy preference in the Final would definitely be France. I think the lift for NZ playing in a home final would be one of the few things which could disrupt the Red Roses.\u201d     7.36am   TRY! New Zealand 15-17 France (Tui, 44')  It is awarded! Boulard couldn\u2019t collect it and Tui pounces \u2013 wow, wow, wow. Holmes misses the extras.  Updated at 7.36am GMT    7.35am    44 min: A frantic start to the second 40 but it seems New Zealand are shaken by a strong France side. The France scrum sees them come away with it but Bourdon kicks away and Woodman starts New Zealand\u2019s attack. They kick through and France cannot re-collect and Tui dives on the ball over the line! Wow, the TMO is checking but if that\u2019s scored that is impressive     7.33am    42 min: New Zealand knock on from the restart and France play with the advantage. Fluhler is scrappy under high ball too but it is backwards this time, New Zealand on the attack. But France have turned it over, Bourdon\u2019s clearance kick is out on the full \u2013 New Zealand line-out to come. France really need to be more clinical with their kicking game but they manage to pull back to ball at the line-out!     7.31am   Back underway! New Zealand 10-17 France  So will the hosts leave the competition after the next 40 minutes? Or can New Zealand blow France away? France will destroy some records if they do get the win here:      7.25am    England fans who would you rather see your team face in the final? France or New Zealand? Whatever the match up it will be a huge Test match. But let me know if you have a preference via Twitter and email.     7.23am    Whoever ends up winning this match, in which France have the upper hand, they will face England in the final. The Red Roses defeated Canada in a tight and thrilling match earlier today. Catch up with all the action with Rob Kitson\u2019s report here:      7.18am    A run down of that half, France got the first points with Drouin kicking a penalty. They also got the first try with R Menager going over before New Zealand launched a comeback. It was a mirror of France\u2019s points with Holmes adding a penalty and then Fluhler went over. But France managed to nudge themselves ahead before half-time. Game on!     7.16am   Half-time! New Zealand 10-17 France  Well, France could be knocking out the hosts here! They are 40 minutes away from their first World Cup final.     7.15am   TRY! New Zealand 10-17 France (Vernier, 40')  Amazing in defence and now in attack from Vernier! France will love having that try right on half time, they do deserve to be ahead it feels. Drouin adds the extras.  Updated at 7.16am GMT    7.14am    39 min: France are plugging away at this New Zealand defence, they want to be ahead at the break!     7.13am    38 min: Well after all their hard work in defence, it is all to play for. That all came from Drouin\u2019s poor goal line drop out. France have the penalty now and they kick to the corner.     7.10am   TRY! New Zealand 10-10 France (Fluhler, 35')  Wow! New Zealand win the scrum penalty and Cocksedge takes it quickly. The ball drifts out to Fluhler who goes over. Holmes hits the extras.  Updated at 7.12am GMT    7.09am    34 min: Here come New Zealand again, surely they are going to find a try soon? But no, despite New Zealand running over their try line, Fall has done incredibly well to hold up the ball! Wow! Drouin\u2019s goal line drop out is out on the fall though and France will have the scrum. There\u2019s a break in play ahead of the set piece with Ferer receiving treatment.     7.06am    32 min: Redmond had got in touch via email and said: \u201cFrench off to a good start, but how do they sustain this and how do they stack up to England?\u201d France managed to maintain a good performance for the full 80 against England so they are capable of doing it here. France and England are two high quality teams and both are amazing at set piece. I think the difference between them is England are better at attack and France better at defence. Back to the match, New Zealand are on the hunt here and are in the 22 but Fitzpatrick spills!     7.03am   PENALTY! New Zealand 3-10 France (Holmes, 29')  The full-back knocks it over and they reduce France\u2019s lead to seven points.     7.03am    29 min: New Zealand kick to the corner and Ponsonby\u2019s line-out if good. The maul marches on but France once again do well to bring it down legally. The Black Ferns get the advantage as the French are off their feet and New Zealand point to the sticks.     7.01am    27 min: It is a penalty over as it isn\u2019t clearly above the horizontal, the crowd don\u2019t like that. Tui is staying on.     7.00am    27 min: France get it back but Drouin\u2019s kick goes straight out of play. Ponsonby\u2019s line-out is lost and Bourdon clears the lines. Woodman catches the high ball and the Black Ferns look to strike. Tui gets absolutely thrown by Vernier and the New Zealander is injured here, TMO looking for a dangerous tackle here.     6.58am    25 min: Well, the crowd will have to get behind their team now. France are showing they are developing in this tournament. Against England their defence was impeccable but their attack was not clinical enough but today they are making sure they get the points on the board. The kicking game comes into play but New Zealand are running it now.     6.55am   TRY! New Zealand 0-10 France (R Menager, 23')  Sochat\u2019s line-out is clean once more and France are looking for the first try of the match here. The maul is marching but New Zealand bring it down legally! They run it through the hands and R Menager is over! This is her first match since their game against France after sustaining a head injury, so valuable for this team. Drouin adds the extras.  Updated at 6.56am GMT    6.54am    21 min: Apologies, it wasn\u2019t a scrum it was a line-out. It is scrappy from France but they have it and Bourdon brings the kicking game into play, it is a great tactic in the end with Holmes\u2019 kick out on the full. Another line-out sees the French maul and France have the advantage, Drouin kicks cross field and Woodman has it but we come back to the advantage. France kick to the corner.     6.52am    19 min: France come away with the ball from the scrum and Drouin kicks away. New Zealand again on the attack but they are building from halfway. Escudero makes three tackles in a row! This French defence is brutal and it works as New Zealand are loose once more and France have the scrum.      6.50am    17 min: Deshaye is to continue but the pause was slightly longer as the players had a water break. Back underway now.     6.49am    17 min: New Zealand knock on through Rule! The hosts are shaken here but France aren\u2019t quite settled either. France scrum but Deshaye is receiving treatment before the set piece.     6.47am    16 min: New Zealand\u2019s driving maul is well defended by France as the hosts are forced to play with ball in hand. They think they have it down over the line but this time France hold it up over the line! What a defensive effort and France have a goal line drip out. New Zealand are quickly back with the ball and they set off in pursuit of their first points.     6.45am    14 min: France\u2019s line-out was under pressure but they come away with it but they lose it at the breakdown with a knock on. After a reset at the New Zealand scrum they win the penalty! Demant boots the ball to the corner.  Updated at 6.45am GMT    6.43am    12 min: Rule is able to continue and France\u2019s line-out is good once more. France try quick flowing rugby but a pass to Fall doesn\u2019t go to hand and Demant clears with a kick. Ponsonby\u2019s line-out is good and New Zealand have their best attacking platform in this match. But France again do really well at the breakdown and they get the penalty. France are a real mean defensive outfit. However, all their good work is wasted with Drouin unable to find touch and Cocksedge finds a great touch.     6.40am    10 min: There is a break in play as Rule receives some treatment ahead of the French line-out.     6.39am    9 min: It has been all France so far and New Zealand will want to be on the attacking foot soon. Fall does really well to keep the ball with France as New Zealand looked as though they had turned it over. The French are building from deep here but as Menager tries to keep it in play, her pass is forward. New Zealand on the front foot now but not for long! France win the breakdown penalty, a really break start from them. Drouin kicks to the corner.     6.36am   PENALTY! New Zealand 0-3 France (Drouin, 7')  It is over from the fly-half. Game on!     6.36am    6 min: Filopon is almost through and France are just metres from the line here! They are into double figure phases but Bourdon is whacked backwards. France have the advantage and we come back for it as France are held up. The French point to the sticks, they want the points.     6.34am    4 min: Sochat\u2019s line-out is good but New Zealand do well to defend the driving maul. The French run it through Bourdon and run through the phases. M Menager makes vital metres with Tui eventually bringing her down.     6.32am    2 min: New Zealand have an early penalty and they take it quickly. Boulard gets the kicking game into play but New Zealand decide to run it and there\u2019s an uncharacteristic handling error \u2013 backwards though. But Bremner then knocks on a few phases later. A France scrum sees them come away with the penalty! They kick to the corner.     6.30am   Kick-off! New Zealand 0-0 France  So can France knock out the hosts? Or will New Zealand be able to batter down the impressive French defence? We will soon find out \u2026     6.25am    Before today started this semi-final was harder to call than England\u2019s. Then Canada almost caused an upset which has just made me more excited for this one! Who will get the win here? Kick-off coming in five minutes.     6.20am    The players will be out shortly and the haka and anthems will follow. The haka is always emotional and will be even more so with Eden Park filling up ahead of the match.     6.15am    Get in touch and let me know how you\u2019re feeling this morning! You can reach me via Twitter or email, I am surprisingly very awake but I think that\u2019s from the adrenaline from England\u2019s win over Canada \u2013 a cracking match.     6.10am    A fun fact for you:      6.05am    The team news is here! New Zealand have made one change to their starting XV with Renee Holmes back in at full-back. The move sees Ruby Tui back on the win with Ayesha Leti-I\u2019iga dropping to the bench New Zealand starting XV: Renee Holmes; Ruby Tui, Stacey Fluhler, Theresa Fitzpatrick, Portia Woodman; Ruahei Demant, Kendra Cocksedge; Phillipa Love, Georgia Ponsonby, Amy Rule, Maiakawanakaukani Roos, Chelsea Bremner, Alana Bremner, Sarah Hirini, Liana Mikaele-Tu\u2019u.

England have just beaten Canada in their semi which mean whoever wins this upcoming fixture will face the Red Roses in the final. And what a treat we have coming up with hosts New Zealand taking on France. The Black Ferns have wowed with their attack this tournament, particularly though Portia Woodman and Ruby Tui. They had answers for any question against Wales in their quarter-final but they face a different beast in France. The French have been electric in defence, only conceding one try when they played England in the pool stage. It will be difficult to batter down their defence but France\u2019s attack is not always clinical so it will be an intriguing match up today. The team news is out so stay tuned for all the updates ahead of kick-off at 6.30am GMT.  "

                    "body": "  6.01am    Thank you so much for joining me for this semi-final and what a match it was! England march on to the final but who they will face is still up in the air. Join me for New Zealand v France to see who the Red Roses will play, either team will be aiming to end England\u2019s 30-match winning run.      5.55am    Canada head coach Kevin Rouet said:\u201dI am proud of the girls. It\u2019s about details and England were better than us on details. I think there are more than a few missed opportunities for us\u2026 We\u2019ll be back.\u201d And he added on the bronze medal match: \u201cI think for tonight we will be disappointed but I am confident we will come back to win third place.     5.50am    England head coach Simon Middleton told ITV: \u201cWe had to do it by hook or by crook today. We have work to do, we have to make sure we recover really well. We didn\u2019t play well today. Canada were absolutely brilliant today. they just don\u2019t make any mistakes with the ball\u2026 We are under massive pressure. And on the penalty count: \u201cWe only conceded five last week but when you come under pressure you are going to concede.\u201d And on Dow: \u201cIt\u2019s why we brought her. Emily and the medical staff [are amazing], we were always going to give her a chance. A shout out to Claudia to, it\u2019s fairy tale they combined for that try. Who he wants in the final: \u201cI don\u2019t care. I\u2019m going to lie down in a dark room and watch the other semi!\u201d     5.46am    Have a look at Dow\u2019s second try, it is just insane:      5.44am    England vice-captain Emily Scarratt told ITV: \u201cIt was really tough, I am glad I was able to do my part today. Canada were fantastic, we pulled up in a few areas but at this point in the tournament you have to be on the right side of the scoreboard which we were today.\u201d On Dow: \u201cShe was supposed to be out for nine months [with her broken leg] and she is seven months in and she is scoring tries like that!\u201d On Eden Park: \u201cIt\u2019s nuts isn\u2019t it! When you think of bucket list stuff as a rugby player this is right up there.\u201d     5.41am    The ITV pundits have posed an interesting question, did England win that or did Canada lose it? I think the answer is not clean cut. Canada did lose a few line-outs by their line which would have seen them pop more points on the board. But equally England\u2019s defence was brutal and game management was incredible to get them over the line. I think we can all agree what a Test match it was though!     5.37am    Canada captain Sophie de Goede told ITV: \u201cWords can\u2019t put it into context. I am incredibly proud, we are disappointed. We are not happy losing in the semi. \u201cAll that really matters is the win, credit to them they got that today. I don\u2019t think this was our best performance.. with more time together and more [funding] we could do more. We\u2019re very grateful to be part of Rugby Canada, I don\u2019t think it is our union they have supported us really well. We just don\u2019t have the capabilities right now.\u201d     5.34am    England captain Sarah Hunter said: \u201cIt was incredible. Canada really tested us, for rugby fans I hope that was an advertisement for what women\u2019s rugby is all about. Canada were relentless and the girls put their bodies on the line.\u201d On game management: \u201cWe knew Canada would be in it, we know they have been fantastic all tournament. So when we knew there were points on offer you have to take them.\u201d     5.30am    Sport gets me so emotional and seeing the Canada players so heartbroken has sent me. They have challenged England the most we have seen in a long while, especially by an amateur side.      5.27am    The celebrations from England really shows how much they were pushed in this match. Canada were amazing, impeccable attack and brutal defence. But in the end the Red Roses displayed what they could do, they didn\u2019t concede a point in the sin bin period and they defended really well time and time again to keep the ever-threatening Canada at bay.     5.23am   Full-time: Canada 19-26 England  Canada put up a ferocious fight but in the end the Red Roses nail their defence to seal their spot in the RWC final! That was one of the best games of women\u2019s rugby I have seen and to think Canada are an amateur outfit is just crazy. England march onto the final.     5.21am    79 min: England have disrupted the ball at the line-out and they win it back. A line-out to come and it is clean from the Red Roses. They are building from deep here and will want to run down the clock here!     5.20am    78 min: Kabeya is Herculean in defence but Canada still come forward. But Kildunne turns it over! Harrison kicks away and Alarie catches. I don\u2019t know how the players are feeling but my nerves are shot! England now have the ball and surely they will look to tick down the clock but Brown gives away the penalty! Oh my word, what an ending we have as Canada kick to the corner.      5.18am    76 min: England will have to be squeaky clean here and that is a huge tackle from Kabeya. Canada are so good with ball in hand, so clinical and patient. They are edging closer and closer. They get into the 22 with five minutes left on the clock and Corrigan does really well to pick up a loose pass.      5.16am    74 min: England knock on through Aitchison in defence and Canada have the scrum once more. If this game does finish level we will have extra time here, I\u2019m unsure if my heart can take it! There was a slight break in play ahead of the set piece but Canada come away with it when we\u2019re back underway.      5.14am    73 min: A really poor kick from Aitchison sees Canada on the attack again, they have the advantage and we come back for it. The Canadian scrum sees England give away with penalty and they opt for the scrum again. Don\u2019t you just love Test rugby?! Canada come away with it and England have to do more defensive work.     5.11am   PENALTY! Canada 19-26 England (Scarratt, 71')  It is over and England have a seven point cushion, nerves of steel from Scarratt.      5.10am    70 min: Does anyone else feel sick with nerves? I definitely do! Ten minutes on the clock and just four points between these sides. Aitchison is on for Heard. Could Canada end England\u2019s winning run? They have been the silent assassins in this tournament with the spotlight being elsewhere. Canada are building from deep here, my heart is beating so fast. Canada kick away and England are now in possession for what feels like an age! They win the penalty and they opt for the sticks \u2013 a huge kick to come from Scarratt.     5.07am   TRY! Canada 19-23 England (Beukeboom, 68')  Oh my word, what a try! Beukeboom made the break and finished the move off, De Goede gets the extras and my oh my this semi is tight!  Updated at 5.08am GMT    5.07am    68 min: Cokayne is off for Davies as well for England as Canada look to attack once more \u2013 the questions over their fitness have surely been dispelled with this impressive and continued hammering of the England line. Beukeboom makes an incredible break to put Canada just a few metres away!     5.05am    66 min: Another counter-ruck from England is good and they turn it over! I think Cornborough will be able to rejoin this when there is a break in play. Harrison lofts it into the stands and here the prop comes. Back to 15 players and England did not concede a point during that sin bin. Kabeya is on too.     5.04am    65 min: Tuttosi is off for Beag and Cokayne received some treatment ahead of this scrum. After a reset England come away with it and Harrison kicks away under a low of pressure. Canada have it and are hunting for their third of the match, the fight from both teams is impressive. Alarie does really well again to gain valuable metres, they are getting closer.     5.01am    63 min: So can England see out this yellow card without conceding? Their defence are hoping so and they do well to bring down Canada\u2019s maul legally. Cleall makes a great tackle and she wins the penalty!     4.59am    62 min: England give away yet another penalty and Canada kick to the corner. There\u2019s a break in play here, a Canadian is receiving treament.     4.57am    61 min: Bern makes a great run and England are into the 22. They are doing really well with a player down. Scarratt picks up a loose ball but it has been turned over by Canada and Pelletier is almost away! Dow eventually gets her down but she has made a great break!     4.55am    59 min: I think Alarie is actually staying on! England\u2019s Muir makes an appearance as England have a scrum and with Cornborough in the bin they need a complete front row. They come away with it and are running through the phases.     4.54am    58 min: There\u2019s a big break in play as Alarie receives treatment, it seems likely the full-back will be replaced.     4.52am    58 min: England are sloppy but they come away with it. They are going through the phases here but Harrison kicks away. Alarie is down injured so for now the sides are even. England are in attack now but the referee pauses play for Alarie.      4.50am    56 min: This will be a test for England now, an 11-point cushion to defend with over 20 minutes to go. You would think the cushion would shrink but Tuttosi\u2019s line-out isn\u2019t straight! A huge let off for England. The Red Roses opt for the line-out and Ward has it. They go with the maul and they are looking to run it out of their 22 here. And wow! They have the penalty and they will clear their lines. Expert response to the yellow from the Red Roses.     4.48am   YELLOW CARD! Canada 12-23 England (Cornborough, 54')  Canada go for the driving maul and they win a penalty from the set piece. They kick to the corner again and England will have to be careful after that earlier warning from the referee. They go with the maul once more and Canada have the advantage again. A card is coming I think and yes it is.      4.45am    52 min: The tries in this match have been breath-taking, what an advertisement for women\u2019s rugby. This is spicy and could still go either way. The latest score left me with my mouth wide open! Hunter has been replaced by Cleall. Canada get the penalty and they kick to the corner.     4.42am   TRY! Canada 12-23 England (Dow, 50')  What have we just witnessed?! MacDonald\u2019s initial break is amazing who offloads to Dow and oh my word. She runs, runs and keeps on running! That is one of the best tries of this tournament.  Updated at 4.42am GMT    4.41am    49 min: Canada are patient in their attack and so far England are doing well not to give away the penalty. They are just metres away here, they are so close! England push Canada backwards and Cokayne turns the ball over. But they can\u2019t claim it and Canada are in attack again, jeez this is beautiful rugby. England turn it over again, superb defence to not give away a penalty in that. MacDonald is now countering!     4.39am    47 min: Castle is on for Canada as the team look to attack here. They have just entered the 22 but a Tuttosi pass which was meant for Paquin is loose, England look as though they have it back but MacDonald knocks on. A Canada scrum to come. Eight handling errors for England now, this has been their weakness for quite some time and they\u2019ll need to tighten up if they want to win this. Canada come away with the ball.     4.37am    45 min: Rowland is heading off the field on a cart, she is clapping the crowd but there will be worries for Simon Middleton. Confirmation Kildunne is on and we are back underway.     4.35am    45 min: Medics are surrounding Rowland and the injury must have come in that latest ruck. This will be heartbreaking for the star, especially if England do reach the final. I think Rowland will be replaced by Kildunne but I will confirm shortly.     4.34am    45 min: Canada have made a change with Kassil on for DeMerchant. Rowland again takes the ball into contact but Canada rip the ball and they will attack here. Tuttosi does extremely well to collect a ball which look destined for a knock on. England are defending with a player down as Rowland is down and receiving treatment. The referee pauses play to allow Rowland time for treatment \u2013 this will be a huge blow.     4.32am   PENALTY! Canada 12-18 England (Scarratt, 43')  It is over! A six point cushion but they\u2019ll need more.     4.31am    42 min: England are patient on the ball and they earn a penalty at the breakdown, England point to the sticks \u2013 they know how important each point will be.     4.30am    41 min: Rowland has made great metres in England\u2019s early attack, she has been cracking at full-back so far, and the team are now running through the phases. Bern gets some vital metres but so far Canada are doing well once again in defence.     4.29am   Back underway! Canada 12-15 England  So we are 40 minutes away from finding out one of the teams in the final! A lot of people have been talking about whether Canada will be able to match England in fitness and I hope they can. A toe-to-toe contest for the full 80 would be so tasty!     4.25am    Who do you think will take this match? I honestly cannot call it and I\u2019d love to hear from you, you can contact me via Twitter and email.     4.20am    Just take a look at this try, magic in motion:      4.15am   Half-time: Canada 12-15 England  Well this is coming close to the best game of the tournament so far. England raced to a 12-0 lead but Canada struck back with two beautiful tries. It is all still to play for. What a match!     4.14am   PENALTY! Canada 12-15 England (Scarratt, 40')  And it is over! That\u2019s half-time, what a thrilling half.     4.13am    39 min: After a reset Canada come away with it but they are under immense pressure, England keen to hit back before the break. Grant kicks away but England have it and they are looking for their third. Scarratt makes a great break to put them in the 22 and they are going through the phases here. England have the penalty and they are debating whether to go to corner or posts. They go for posts! Kick to come.     4.11am    37 min: There\u2019s a break in play but we are underway once more, a Canada scrum to come.     4.10am    37 min: It is worth noting that Canada are an amateur outfit, the only semi-finalists not to be professional. And they are going toe-to-toe with the world number one side. England looking to strike back but Heard knocks on.     4.08am   TRY! Canada 12-12 England (Corrigan, 35')  Canada opt for the maul again and what amazing work! They march at least 15 metres and England are pinged again. The referee has a word with Hunter warning her about these penalties piling up. Tessier kicks to the corner, another try for them feels imminent. Canada playing England at their own game as they go for the maul again, this time it is great defence from England to stop the maul charging over. The Red Roses have to maintain their defence though and Canada go so close. They run it wide and Corrigan is over. Do Goede adds the extras and we are level!  Updated at 4.09am GMT    4.05am    33 min: Canada have another clean line-out and they are now the ones to use the driving maul. Matthews is judged to have brought that down and Tessier kicks, not earning many metres though. The Canadian line-out is good and they are now on the hunt for their second try.     4.03am    31 min: Canada were going through the phases and were a little scrappy but play is halted by the referee as there was a neck roll from Canada \u2013 unsure which player as the replay wasn\u2019t clear. Harrison clears England\u2019s lines. The line-out is sloppy from England as Packer loses it and it is Canada who are on the attack here. Kaljuvee pops a kick in but Dow catches and calls the mark.     4.01am    29 min: Canada have the scrum and they come away with it, they kick away and England have it. But now England are the ones to be charged down! Canada can\u2019t pounce on the loose ball and Harrison boots it into the stands. A Canadian line-out in a great position, it was slightly loose but they come away with it.     3.58am    27 min: Hunt turns it over at the breakdown, great defence from the Canadian. There\u2019s time off as players receive some treatment and some water. Well what a semi this is!     3.57am    26 min: Aldcroft wins the penalty at the breakdown and Harrison kicks to the corner. Will the driving maul be called into action now? The line-out from Cokayne is clean but they decide to run it. Ward thinks she has it over the line but impressive defence sees the ball held up! A goal line drop out from Canada rolls all the way to halfway and England are in attack once more.     3.55am    24 min: England get the ball out the scrum and Harrison kicks away. The TMO are checking to see if that was a 50:22 and it is! England line-out is good and they decide to run it. Harrison offloads slickly to Rowland to get them into the 22.      3.52am    22 min: Canada have another scrum and they come away with it, fast and firing. But They knock on and England will have the set piece now. The try from Paquin has awoken the Canadian beast, this match is going to be tasty!     3.49am   TRY! Canada 5-12 England (Paquin, 19')  I am lost for words at how amazing that was. It is a clean scrum from both sides but Pelletier got the ball quickly and made a cracking break. She dummied to fool MacDonald and Paquin was in! Sensational.  Updated at 3.51am GMT    3.48am    18 min: Dow will get the plaudits for finishing that off but Rowland put in all the groundwork there. Harrison clears with a kick to halfway and Tuttosi will want a clean line-out here. But it is loose again and England look to attack once more. Rowland\u2019s pass to MacDonald isn\u2019t clinical though and Canada opt for the scrum.     3.45am   TRY! Canada 0-12 England (Dow, 15')  England get it back and Rowland makes a fantastic break! She offloads to Dow who stretches over, Middleton fist pumps! Scarratt narrowly misses the kick, it bounces off the post.  Updated at 3.46am GMT    3.44am    14 min: Canada\u2019s first line-out of the match is loose and Infante comes away with it. A great fend from Dow gets England into the 22 and carries from Cornborough and Aldcroft edge them closer. Harrison pops a gruber kick in, an interesting choice as England were going through the motions and a try felt imminent, and Canada clear.     3.42am    12 min: England regather at the restart but the kicking game is back, it seems it will be a key part of this match. The Red Roses are playing it wide but Harrison puts boot to ball and Tessier collects and kicks away. It works well for Canada but Heard charges down a kick from Tessier and England charge forward once more. Harrison\u2019s pass is loose though \u2013 it is frantic right now!     3.38am   TRY! Canada 0-7 England (Packer, 8')  A reset to the scrum eventually sees England come away with it. Rowland\u2019s dancing feet sees her spread the ball wide, she eventually passes to Scarratt and she is turfed into touch. They were playing the advantage though and Harrison kicks to the corner. A clean line-out and the driving maul gives them a try once more! Scarratt adds the extras.  Updated at 3.39am GMT    3.36am    6 min: Canada do really well to make sure they don\u2019t give it away and they clear their lines. England run it through the players as they attack with a slick offload from Scarratt to Heard. Harrison does her own dummy and she is almost away and England edge closer. But, alas, we will have to wait for the first try of the match. A loose pass from Ward to Packer is loose but England had the advantage, Red Roses scrum to come.     3.34am    4 min: Pelletier attempts a dummy but it is read well by the English defence. And it is a stellar effort from England who win it back but Canada win it back quickly! Wow what a start to this match. The Red Roses turn it over once more and Rowland brings the kicking game in once more. The Kick from Harrison is great and England pin Canada in their own 22.     3.32am    2 min: A great kick-off from Canada sees the side come away with it and they are running through the phases early doors. The kicking game comes into play and the ball is loose from Emily Scarratt who knocks on, a Canada scrum to come. The set piece will be interesting as Canada can match the Red Roses up front. It is a clean scrum and Canada come away with it and shift the ball wide, a really bright start from them.     3.30am   Kick-off! Canada 0-0 England  Here we go! Who will bag their final spot? England are red hot favourites but Canada are capable of an upset \u2026     3.24am    The players are out and the anthems will be in full flow shortly! Anyone else nervous? Knock-out rugby could throw up anything!     3.19am    England head coach Simon Middleton has not taken kindly to some criticism levied against his team about their dependable driving maul. A lot of tries are being scored by the England forwards, six of the seven scored against Australia were from the forwards, and he once again commented on the topic ahead of the semi-final. He said: \u201cWe know what our game looks like. We\u2019re confident we\u2019ve got whatever game we need to get in the performance we want. I think New Zealand have got a bigger problem because they can only score with their backs, but nobody is making a fuss about that.\u201d     3.12am    Canada captain Sophie de Goede told the BBC: \u201cWe all believe in each other. England is a formidable team. The pressure is on them. We\u2019re probably the only people that truly believe we can pull off that upset.\u201d     3.04am    The match today is a revisit of the 2014 RWC final where England won 21-9. This game is full of rivalry and it will be interesting to see which way it will go.     2.57am    Here are a few preview to sink your teeth into ahead of the match:         2.50am    Our man on the ground Rob Kitson has a weather update from Eden Park and says it is ideal weather for rugby today! As opposed to last week\u2019s torrential rain nightmare, the skies are clear, the sun is shining although there is a slight breeze. Will we see England use the weather to run the ball through the hands? Or will the driving maul once again come into action? All will be revealed from 3.30 \u2026     2.43am    Get in touch and let me know how you\u2019re feeling this morning! Did you stay up to keep up to date or have a nap? I had a four hour nap which I hope is enough to see my through both matches! You can contact me via Twitter and email.     2.36am    As I said the team news is here and Canada have an unchanged starting 15 but they have mixed up their bench. They have named seven forwards in their replacements in a bid to match England up front. Canada starting XV: Alarie; Grant, Corrigan, Kaljuvee, Farries; Tessier, Pelletier; DeMerchant, Tuttosi, Menin, Holtkamp, Hunt, Forteza, Paquin, De Goede (capt). Replacements: Boag, Kassil, Ellis, Fuamba, Beukeboom, Senft, Svoboda, Holly.  England, meanwhile, have made just one change from their win over Australia in the quarter-final. Claudia MacDonald comes in at the wing for Lydia Thompson. There were two late changes with the Red Roses announcing at 2.30am today. Hannah Botterman was due to start but has picked up a knee injury and so Vickii Cornborough is in the front row. Lucy Packer was named on the bench but she has an ankle problem. Shaunagh Brown and Sadia Kabeya come onto the bench. England starting XV: Rowland; Dow, Scarratt, Heard, MacDonald; Harrison, Infante; Corborough, Cokayne, Bern, Aldcroft, Ward, Matthews, Packer, Hunter (capt). Replacements: Davies, Muir, Brown, Galligan, Cleall, Kabeya, Aitchison, Kildunne.      2.30am   Preamble  Welcome back to our coverage of the Rugby World Cup! Both semi-finals will be played today and we have live updates from each match to make sure you don\u2019t miss any action. First up is Canada v England with the latter favourites to take their place in the final. Canada have been impressive during the tournament though and have been quite happy moving along with none of the media spotlight.  In recent years England have had the upper hand in this fixture, the last coming in the autumn of 2021 where the Red Roses inflicted a 51-12 result. But many will be expecting the result to be much closer this morning. And it is not just the RWC final spot that these teams are playing for, Canada have the opportunity to spoil England\u2019s winning streak. Simon Middleton\u2019s side are on a 29 game run and the opposition today would love nothing more than to stop them getting to 30. The team news is out so stay tuned for updates ahead of kick-off at 3.30 GMT.  "

                    "body": "Good morning.\nA looming US rail strike in protest against an absence of paid sick leave \u2013 a norm in every other leading democratic country \u2013 as well as concerns about pay, staff shortages and time off looks likely to be blocked legally by Congress.\nThe House of Representatives voted yesterday to approve a bill to block the potentially crippling US rail strike despite a majority of workers rejecting a tentative contract deal in part brokered by the Biden administration.\nIn the US Senate, Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who caucuses with Democrats, announced he would object to fast-tracking Joe Biden\u2019s proposal that Congress impose an industrial settlement, until he can get a roll-call vote on the amendment that would guarantee seven paid sick days for rail workers.\nThe US president, who built a reputation on being pro-labor, has put himself at loggerheads with the unions after asking Congress to avert a strike.\n\nThe economic consequences of a strike. A rail stoppage that could begin as early as 9 December and could cost the US economy about $2bn a day by some estimates, with chaos hitting freight and passenger traffic.\nNo brakes on the gravy train. As railroad carriers implemented cuts and more grueling scheduling systems, they have reported record profits and paid out $196bn in stock buybacks and dividends to shareholders since 2010.\n\nChina\u2019s vice-premier signals shift in Covid stance as some lockdowns eased\n\nOne of China\u2019s most senior pandemic response officials has said the country is entering a \u201cnew stage and mission\u201d in the latest indication of the government\u2019s changing approach after mass protests against its zero-Covid policy.\n\u201cWith the decreasing pathogenicity of the Omicron variant, the increasing vaccination rate and the accumulating experience of outbreak control and prevention, China\u2019s pandemic containment faces a new stage and mission,\u201d said Sun Chunlan, China\u2019s vice-premier, according to reports.\nIt came as several regions including Shanghai began to lift lockdowns despite continuing high case numbers.\nAt a meeting, Sun said China was also taking a more \u201chumane approach\u201d with its outbreak responses. She did not refer to the \u201cdynamic zero-Covid\u201d policy by name, instead emphasising vaccination and other measures.\n\nOmicron narrative flip.

Dear, oh dear,\u201d she writes.\n\u201cFulani\u2019s story is every person of color\u2019s story. I wish I could say it\u2019s unique. I wish I could say that nobody else has been asked such a thing. But that isn\u2019t the case; if it seems unique it is simply because not all of the people of colour get the chance to tell their story.

In 2021, governments directly subsidised oil and gas production to the tune of $64bn (\u00a353bn), and spent a further $531bn on keeping fossil fuel prices low.\n\u201cThe latest figures for fisheries, from 2018, suggest that global subsidies for the sector amount to $35bn a year, over 80% of which go to large-scale industrial fishing.

So now Cocaine Bear has to walk it like it talks it. To fulfill the promise of the trailer, it needs to only be a film about a bear on cocaine. There must be no heavy-handed moralizing about the drug trade. There must be minimal realistic depictions of a bear dying from a debilitating drug overdose.\n\u201cThere should be no subplots whatsoever. I am going to watch Cocaine Bear. I am going to pay for my own ticket. But I swear to god, if I so much as sense any dialogue whatsoever that does not directly discuss what a bear is like when it is on cocaine, I am demanding a refund.\u201d\nSign up\n\nFirst Thing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.

                    "body": "A FAMILIAR STORY As the England squad touched down in Birmingham airport at around the same time as the football Harry Kane struck for that second penalty landed somewhere in the middle of the Qatari desert, the post-mortems into England\u2019s latest Big Stage exit continued in earnest. Narrowly beaten by an underperforming French team they had on the ropes after 70 minutes of Saturday\u2019s tense quarter-final, the general consensus among an often difficult-to-please press pack is that England acquitted themselves well. They were, it was decided, unlucky to lose against the world champions and are in a much better place than they were after Euro Not 2020, a tournament in which they also failed to close out a knockout game against an elite side over which they were at one point dominant. And while these glorious England failures of the Southgate era may seem eminently preferable to the some of the more abject comedy prat-falls of yore \u2013 hello World Cup 2014 and Euro 2016! \u2013 the fact remains that, looked upon collectively, they can still be looked upon as failures and for England under Southgate, losing winnable matches against elite opposition at the business end of major tournaments is becoming a habit. The counter-argument, that at least England are consistently getting to the business end of major tournaments and therefore Southgate must be doing plenty right, is also fairly compelling.  Opinion on the 51-year-old appears to be divided among entrenched extremists, with one side thinking he can\u2019t put a foot right and the other of a mind he can\u2019t put a foot wrong. As is often the case, the truth is probably somewhere in between. An obviously good and decent man who is preposterously popular with his players, in his six years in the gig he has fostered a sense of togetherness that was previously absent from squads renowned for often toxic divisions. He has also overseen no shortage of good results on the pitch while behaving in a far more statesmanlike fashion than any of the four prime ministers in office during his tenure. If Southgate has one obvious shortcoming it seems to be a reluctance or inability to make decisive game-changing decisions from the touchline, a flaw which may have cost England dearly in a game full of our old friends, the fine margins, on Saturday night. Should he remain in his post for the next Euros, there is little evidence he will be any more reactive then. Having travelled to Qatar hoping to bring home the trophy, Southgate and his players returned instead with little more to show for their efforts than a stray Qatari cat. Adopted by John Stones and Kyle Walker, the feline they named Dave is presumably set for a life of pampered luxury prowling the Manchester City training complex, but must first spend several months in quarantine. Like Dave, England\u2019s manager also finds himself betwixt and between, although his limbo is of the self-imposed kind. Amid little or no press clamour for his departure and the endorsements from his players ringing in his ears, Southgate has said he is \u201cconflicted\u201d about his future having \u201cfound large parts of the past 18 months difficult\u201d. He will therefore consider his position in the coming weeks, although with no obvious candidate to succeed him, one suspects it will probably be best for everyone invested in the ongoing success of England\u2019s football team if he decides to stay. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cFrance v England should have been a semi-final or final. Unfortunately one of them had to go home.

FOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS \u201cIt\u2019s probably safe to say that most people assume that the HRWC will produce either a Messi Christmas or a Mbapp\u00e9 New Year.

                    "body": "The Wallaroos have booked themselves a World Cup quarter-final berth after stampeding through Wales 13-7 in Whangarei to secure their second-successive win of the tournament and lock themselves into the tournament\u2019s final eight. Iliseva Batibasaga\u2019s first-half try, eight points from Lori Cramer\u2019s boot and a dominant display at the breakdown were the cornerstones of the victory, as the Wallaroos build crucial momentum in their quest to dethrone New Zealand\u2019s all-conquering Black Ferns on home turf and win their first World Cup at this ninth staging of the event. But they had to do it the hard way, with a try-less final 75-minutes and a final nine minutes with just 14-afield, when debutante Kaitlan Leaney was sent to the sin bin.  The Wallaroos had taken the field without hooker Ashley Masters who was suspended after being red carded for a dangerous tackle in the first round victory over Scotland and they suffered another blow on match eve when lock Atasi Lafai was ruled out with an ankle injury. It brought Grace Kemp in, while Michaela Leonard and Ivania Wong were recalled to the starting side and Leaney named to debut from the bench. Although Wales had been demolished 56-12 in their Test against New Zealand, the scoreline blow-out belied the trouble their forwards caused the defending champions. Even so Wales fumbled the start and conceded a penalty from the kick-off. Australia capitalised, building pressure with fast ruck speed as Grace Hamilton then captain Shannon Parry and Adiana Talakai drove it to the line, allowing halfback Batibasaga to dart through a gap and cross untouched to make it 7-0 after five minutes. After 15 minutes Australia were ahead on the scoreboard and dominating possession with 71% of the ball. Wales had already made 67 energy-sapping tackles and coughed up too many penalties. And a tactic of grubber kicking from fullback Niamh Terry and centre Carys Williams-Morris had simply gifted the Wallaroos more possession. But the Welsh set-piece that had so infuriated the Black Ferns now began to purr. After a good shove in the scrum, a line-out win set up Jasmine Joyce for a burst down the left and a penalty. Wales kicked to the corner rather than the posts and the gamble paid dividends when big No 8 Sioned Harries crashed over from close range to become Wales\u2019 third all-time leading try-scorer with 28 behind Non Evans on 37.  Elinor Snowsill\u2019s conversion went through off the post to level the scores 7-all but Australia quickly rallied, as Arabella McKenzie and Hamilton made bullocking charges to set the Wallaroos up for what seemed a certain try. But in a cruel twist, referee Sara Cox accidentally impeded Batibasaga\u2019s easy pass to a three-player overlap outside. It cost Australia a certain try but they held a clear ascendency, with Wales tiring under the duress of 136 tackles while Australia had made just 34. In the shadows of halftime, those extra tackles showed when teenage wing sensation Bienne Terita, already the scorer of five tries in her first three Tests, burst through three defenders and looked certain to cross before Jasmine Joyce\u2019s desperate cover tackle saved Wales again. Australia did get some reward for their dominance when a late scrum penalty allowed Cramer to kick them three points clear and make it 10-7 at the break. After 10 minutes of scrum collapses and no further score in the second half, McKenzie broke the Welsh line only for Welsh flanker Alex Callender\u2019s crucial tackle to diffuse another near-try. Australia were actively looking for the killer blow and injected bulldozer tight-head prop Eva Karpani, last week\u2019s player of the match, to deliver it. But the stalemate continued, despite Australia\u2019s back row running riot. Both teams squandered attacking penalties as Wales grimly hung on and Wallaroo frustration grew. Finally the women in red inched back into the Wallaroos half and went for the line\u2026 only for Australia\u2019s flanker Emily Chancellor to intercept Snowsill\u2019s pass. But just as the stadium leapt to its feet, she knocked-on with open pasture in front of her. The match took a fresh twist late when debutante Leaney was almost red-carded but referee Cox judged that Wales\u2019 Callender had dipped her head into the tackle. Still, the ensuing yellow card left Australia with only 14 players for the closing stages. With five minutes to go, an exhausted Wales seemed content to hope that a losing bonus point might sneak them into the quarter-finals. The waver in intensity cost them as Australia won a penalty in the 77th minute and Cramer slotted it for 13-7 to snuff Wales and grind out a famous Wallaroos victory and a quarter-final berth. \u201cIt\u2019s massive to be in the quarter-finals, this group has come a long way since the start of the year and that was the first box we wanted to tick,\u201d Australian captain Shannon Parry reflected after the siren, as teammate and turnover queen Grace Hamilton was named player of the match. \u201cReally proud of the girls today to guts out that win against Wales. We\u2019ve been working really hard on our defence system and it\u2019s really good to see it pay off today.\u201d Providing South Africa do not shock England on Sunday, Wales will progress to the quarter-finals and could face hosts New Zealand, who thrashed Scotland 57-0 later on Saturday. The hosts stormed to a dominant victory in Whangarei, scoring seven tries to lead 45-0 at half-time before adding two more in a tighter second period. Renee Holmes and Renee Wickliffe both scored braces for the Black Ferns to end Scotland\u2019s hopes of reaching the knockout stages. \u201cWe got caught cold a little bit, but second half we kept the ball so much better. It shows what they\u2019re all about,\u201d the Scotland head coach, Bryan Easson, told BBC Sport after the game. France secured their quarter-final place with a 44-0 victory over Fiji. Pauline Bourdon scored two tries as France bounced back from defeat to England and underlined their title credentials. "

                    "body": "\u201cJust when I thought I was out \u2026 they pull me back in,\u201d growls Al Pacino\u2019s ageing mobster Michael Corleone in The Godfather Part III. The one-time mafia boss has been at pains to legitimise his ways and go straight, but an attempt on his life has made him realise that his efforts to stay on the right side of the law are futile. Once a mobster always a mobster. Pacino\u2019s scenery-chewing words are conjured when Virat Kohli plays one of those back-foot smites for six down the ground. They\u2019re there again when New Zealand\u2019s Glenn Phillips \u2013 the man with the name of a big-band leader but the athletic grace of a prima ballerina \u2013 pulls off a gravity-flouting diving catch. They\u2019ve been on repeat for the past fortnight since the T20 World Cup got under way. Just when I thought I didn\u2019t \u2013 couldn\u2019t \u2013 really care, this fascinating tournament has dragged me and no doubt many others back into T20\u2019s clutches.  There\u2019s too much cricket. Everyone knows this, but the number of matches, competitions and global tournaments swell like the cheeks of a gluttonous hamster. It can be overwhelming to keep up with it all, even if your job sort of demands it. There\u2019s seemingly not a day in the calendar when cricket isn\u2019t being played, someone somewhere is \u2018having a day out\u2019 while another is having a day to forget separated only by 22 yards. The danger of this Augustus Gloop approach is that it all begins to blend into one big indeterminable splurge, where one short-format game tends to become indistinguishable from the next. Take the recent (and historic) T20 series between Pakistan and England, seven matches reeled off in rapid succession before they headed to Australia for the T20 World Cup. Trying to remember matches from just a few weeks ago becomes akin to a cricketing version of Kim\u2019s game or the conveyor belt round on the Generation Game. \u201cThere was the one with a Babar fifty and a Rizwan fifty, the one where Babar and Rizwan made fifty, Rashid got a 3-fer, Moeen pongoed a huge six, the one where \u2026 \u201cI\u2019m going to have to rush you \u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026 Hales dropped a load, the one where Masood dropped anchor, Moeen pongoed a huge six, Babar got a fifty \u2026\u201d The amount of largely contextless bilateral series and the revolving door of franchise tournaments begin to become meaningless, the success or otherwise of the Originals, Invincibles, Supergiants, Tallawahs, Tuskers, Tombliboos or Pontipines raises little more than a shrug. Test cricket has also grappled with this and the introduction of a World Test Championship is an attempt to provide some context and an element of competition and cyclical completion to the churn of the longest format, even if you have to be a Bletchley code-cracker to understand how it works.  Over the past year I\u2019ve put large swathes of shorter-form cricket on the backburner. Players are increasingly eschewing some formats in order to prolong their careers, focusing their time and energies on others more suited to them. It seemed a decent strategy. Decide to specialise, hone your focus, you can\u2019t do it all. Cherrypick to preserve energy, creativity, sanity. In a reversal of the famous Neil Young quote, when it came to a lot of the short stuff I felt it was better to let it fade away rather than to burn out. This isn\u2019t particularly new thinking, CLR James\u2019s oft-quoted line from Beyond a Boundary in 1963 stated: \u201cWhat do they know of cricket who only cricket know.\u201d James was alluding to the impossibility of understanding cricket without reference to its social and cultural context, while also suggesting you couldn\u2019t really understand West Indian history and culture without cricket, one of its defining activities. I\u2019d always interpreted/adapted quote to mean that it was good to indulge other interests in order to inform or even better understand cricket, to bring something else to the table. No single approach is correct, each to their own and all that, but it was interesting to hear Josh Hazlewood \u201cadmit\u201d he was far from a badger. \u201cI hardly watch any cricket,\u201d the world No 1 T20I bowler said in these pages last week. On both sides of the boundary some live and breathe the game while others have a more hands-off approach. Speaking to Jack Russell last week about his art was an entertaining and enlightening conversation. He mentioned that when he was on tour he\u2019d have a quiet word with his captain, Michael Atherton, to suggest another training session wasn\u2019t going to do him any good at all. \u201cAtherton,\u201d Russell gleefully says, \u201cwould then say, \u2018go on bugger off with your paintbrushes and do some painting, see you in a day or so\u2019\u201d and Russell would do exactly that. Coming back refreshed for another long stint behind the stumps.  Which is all well and good but when the cricket is as entertaining, interesting, controversial and even life-affirming as the T20 World Cup has already been it demands attention. You can\u2019t help but get caught up in it. From India and Pakistan\u2019s epic (some suggest the greatest T20I ever) to West Indies sorrowful early exit to New Zealand chalking up their first win in Australia in more than a decade, this tournament has been the best yet and it\u2019s barely got into its stride. There\u2019ll be another one along in a year or so, not for the ICC the view that global tournaments should be fleeting or finite, to them they are more tortilla chips than white truffle, albeit with the money-making potential of the latter. All of that\u2019s for another day though, as I type England are on their way to defeat by Ireland at the MCG. Eyes drawn away from the page to the unfolding scenes on screen, a moth to the flame burning in Melbourne. As Pacino\u2019s Michael Corleone well knows, the game will get you in the end.

                    "body": "Spanish police have uncovered a drug route from Europe to South America after intercepting a yacht bound for Argentina that was carrying enough MDMA to make more than 1m ecstasy pills. Although boats \u2013 and the odd \u201cnarco-submarine\u201d \u2013 have long transported drugs from South America to Europe, the seizure of the boat suggests smugglers are using the reverse route to open up lucrative new markets in countries where ecstasy is less common and prices consequently very high. The Polic\u00eda Nacional force said the seizure represented the first known case of MDMA being transported on the route. The international operation, which led to the arrest of five people and the seizure of 56kg of MDMA, began at the end of October when Polic\u00eda Nacional officers learned that criminal gangs on the Costa del Sol were planning to ship a large quantity of the drug to South America. Police in Argentina then informed them that an Argentinian citizen had left Brazil and arrived in Spain to take charge of the boat that would be used to smuggle the drugs. The boat, which had been abandoned after being used to bring 1,500kg of cocaine to Spain in 2020, was carefully and clandestinely refitted and stocked by the man and four other Argentinians. \u201cThe arrested men remodelled both the inside and the outside of the boat as part of heavy security measures to ensure that it wouldn\u2019t be linked to the previous police operation,\u201d the Polic\u00eda Nacional said in a statement. \u201cAs well as avoiding contact with third parties, never leaving the boat unoccupied and loading the vessel with tools and material at ungodly hours, they organised some of their most suspicious movements to coincide with Spain\u2019s World Cup matches in Qatar.\u201d At the end of November, the name of the boat was changed and two of the suspects set out for Argentina from C\u00e1diz, only to have to put into port at Tarifa on the southernmost tip of the Iberian peninsula after the vessel broke down. When the repairs had been completed, they left port once again, planning to resupply in the Canary Islands. The plan, however, was short-lived and the boat was intercepted by customs patrol as it left Tarifa. \u201cAfter a search lasting several hours, investigators discovered a secret compartment made from aluminium that had been constructed under the kitchen fittings,\u201d the statement said. \u201cOnce the compartment had been opened, they found 28 packets containing 56kg of MDMA that had been neatly sealed and covered in diesel to mask the smell.\u201d After arresting three other members of the alleged gang in Marbella, police determined they had been trying to smuggle the drug to Argentina to manufacture between 800,000 and 1.2m pills, depending on purity. \u201cMDMA is a much scarcer drug in South America than in Europe,\u201d the force said. \u201cThis operation has brought to light a new drug route from Europe to Latin American countries that would allow these organisations to reach a new market of millions of potential consumer. The very high value of synthetic drugs in South America also explains why they opted to open up this novel transport route.\u201d"

                    "body": "Tunisia (3-4-3)\nAymen Dahmen (GK) Couldn\u2019t do anything with the goal and otherwise looked assured. 6\nDylan Bronn (CB) Part of a defensive unit that saw plenty of the ball but lacked the courage to step out and play with it. 5\nYassine Meriah (CB) Completed a game-high 80 passes and worked hard repelling Australia in transition but lost Mitchell Duke for the goal. 5\n\nMontassar Talbi (CB) Again, saw plenty of the ball but did little with it. One of the Tunisians to come off second best in the physical battle that gave Australia hope. 5\nMohamed Dr\u00e4ger (RM) Busy and lively in the first half, but also wasteful. He delayed his shot, allowing Harry Souttar to make a last-ditch block, and was removed at half-time following a head knock. That change allowed coach Jalel Kadri to revert to a more threatening 4-3-3. 6\nEllyes Skhiri (CM) Industrious but ineffective. Tunisia lacked invention in midfield all night. 5\nA\u00efssa La\u00efdouni (CM) An early booking limited his fiery influence and there was no repeat of the passion that saw him excel against Denmark. 5\nAli Abdi (LM) Looked sharp early on raiding down the left but drifted as the game wore on. 5\n\nNaim Sliti (RW) Forced Mat Ryan into a couple of saves but didn\u2019t do enough to justify his inclusion ahead of Anis Ben Slimane. 6\nIssam Jebali (CF) Found himself isolated from his teammates and then crowded out by opponents. Tough night for the centre-forward. 5\nYoussef Msakni (LW) Tunisia\u2019s brightest spark by some margin but also guilty of missing his side\u2019s decent opportunities. Looked like the only player in white capable of unlocking Australia\u2019s defence but should have scored at the near post in the first half. 7\nSubstitutes:\nFerjani Sassi His arrival at the break allowed Tunisia to restructure and assert themselves in midfield but the substitute himself made little impression but for a wild shot and a late yellow card. 4\nWahbi Khazri Quite why Kadri only gave his X-factor the final 25 minutes is a mystery in a match that was crying out for wit. In his short time on the pitch he had one shot saved by Ryan following a cutback. 5\nTaha Khenissi and Wajdi Kechrida n/a\n\nAustralia (4-3-2-1)\nMat Ryan (GK) Australia\u2019s skipper was calm and commanding. Tunisia only landed four shots on target and most of those required little saving. But Ryan asserted himself by coming for crosses and dominating his penalty area. 7\nFran Kara\u010di\u0107 (RB) The only change to the starting XI was an assured presence at the back and got forward regularly in the first half. 7\n\nHarry Souttar (CB) The big Aberdonian was a granite colossus. Everything Tunisia threw at him he had an answer to, be it with his head, his body, or an outstretched leg. His timing to step out of the line and intercept was like prime Franco Baresi. From a guy just back from an ACL it was phenomenal. 9\nKye Rowles (CB) Not as assured as his partner in the centre of defence but nonetheless Rowles put in an almighty performance, putting his body on the line time and again to make crucial blocks. 7\nAziz Behich (LB) Another outstanding performer in Australia\u2019s backline, and not only that, Behich was a consistent threat on the left, linking up well with Craig Goodwin and offering an extra body in midfield as an inverted fullback. 7\nAaron Mooy (CM) The Celtic playmaker is known for his range of passing and composure but against Tunisia he rolled up his sleeves and dug in for a battle. He was physical, sharp into the tackle, and still Australia\u2019s main outlet in possession. 8\nJackson Irvine (CM) For the second match in a row Irvine was the heartbeat of his side, working tirelessly to regain possession and making sure he was never far from Mooy\u2019s side. Australia won the match because they matched Tunisia\u2019s physical intensity and Irvine was a crucial to that fight. 8\nRiley McGree (CM) Far more involved than against France, linking play with the front three and working hard to execute Australia\u2019s successful press. 7\nMathew Leckie (RW) Tireless on the right hand side, doubling up to help his fullback, and flying into challenges all over the park. 7\nCraig Goodwin (LW) Australia\u2019s most creative attacker for the second match in a row, Goodwin was fortunate to be credited with an assist after his cross was deflected into the path of Duke. With better set-piece delivery he\u2019d be one of the more hyped players in the tournament so far. 7\nMitchell Duke (CF) The Socceroo spearhead took the fight to Tunisia from the off, never taking a backward step, competing for every loose ball, and refusing to back down in any physical confrontation. His involvement in the buildup and finish for the game\u2019s only goal was world class. 8\nSubstitutes:\nJamie Maclaren and Ajdin Hrustic both showed some neat touches in their 30-minute cameos but neither proved the relieving outlet their manager would have hoped. Maclaren did deliver one excellent cross that Leckie was unable to convert. 6\nMilo\u0161 Degenek, Awer Mabil, Keanu Baccus n/a"

                    "body": "Antonio Conte has spoken of the \u201cstrange\u201d experience of watching his two most senior players face each other from the penalty spot not once but twice during the World Cup.\nThe Spurs coach has the task of making sure both Harry Kane and Hugo Lloris are focused on achieving for Spurs in the second half of the Premier League season which resumes on Boxing Day. But the Italian has little doubt his two leaders will be ready, despite the unusual events of the quarter-final between England and France.\n\u201cDuring the game it was really strange because on one side I had Hugo and on the other I had Harry,\u201d Conte said. \u201cTo see two penalties and two teammates against each other it was not easy, honestly, and I think for the players it was really strange. When you are used to living every day and stay in the same club [it] is not easy.\n\n\u201cYour keeper and your striker one against the other twice, it was really strange but then I said: \u2018OK, that\u2019s what happened.\u2019 I enjoyed the game because the game was good and I think it was one of best games of the World Cup for sure.\u201d\nLloris returned to the Spurs training group on Christmas Day and will be on the bench against Brentford, with Fraser Forster set to deputise. Kane, however, has declared himself \u201creset and ready to go again\u201d on social media and Conte said he had felt no need to try to buoy the 29-year-old\u2019s mood.\n\n\u201cI spoke to Harry about my experience when I was a player and negative situations happen,\u201d Conte said, referring to being part of the Italy squad that lost the 1994 World Cup final on penalties. \u201cBut you know \u2026 it\u2019s not so important to find people to tell you \u2018don\u2019t worry\u2019.\n\u201cWe are strong people. Anyone who plays at this level has to be strong. In any situation there is positive and negative and you have to address them in the right way. Harry is a strong person, I was a strong person when I was a player. It\u2019s better not to speak and to try to justify because we are talking about an important player and they know the way to go.\n\u201cI think Harry will be motivated, I am sure, because Harry had a good period to rest and now he can come back strong and he knows well his role is very important. Like Hugo we are talking about our two most represented players and they have to show great motivation, to be leaders and to lead that group.\u201d\nConte did joke that he was slightly more concerned about the World Cup winner in his squad, Cristian Romero. \u201cI am a bit worried, honestly, because they are celebrating in an amazing way,\u201d the Italian said. \u201cTo see 4 million people [on the streets] is amazing. But now he has to come back and go into Tottenham vision. I repeat that we need to have our players to have great motivation. The Premier League will be difficult, and we have the Champions League against AC Milan. The winners and the losers [of the World Cup] have to stay at the same level: both with great passion and desire.\u201d\nConte said he was \u201cnot really happy\u201d to be playing again so soon after the World Cup and will think carefully about whether to start anyone who was at the tournament. \u201cOn one side I have players who I worked with for four weeks really well and on the other side I have players who worked at the World Cup and are not at the top at the moment,\u201d he said."

                    "body": "Every generation of Welsh football fans finds their own special moment of heartbreak. I wasn\u2019t alive to witness the great robbery of 1977 when a Maradona-grade handball decision sent Scotland to the 1978 World Cup at our expense and I was a touch too young to have my hopes and dreams brutally crushed by Paul Bodin\u2019s missed penalty of 1993, which would have taken us to USA 94. Instead, I had to wait for 2003 at the Millennium Stadium, watching Wales take on Russia for a spot at the 2004 Euros. It was a match so drab that our fans started chanting \u201cUSA, USA, USA\u201d, as though all we had to get excited about was the cold war. In the end, that chant turned out to be weirdly prescient. A few days after our 0-1 defeat, one of the Russian players, Yegor Titov, tested positive for Bromantan, a cold war-era drug allegedly used by the Russian military to give their troops extra stamina. The Welsh FA protested to Uefa, but the result was not overturned and so a new age of Wales supporters had their defining moment of pain.   Roman Igbagari and Louis Morris-Tarrant, both 11: \u2018We love wearing the hats because they are fun and support the Welsh side. Also they are bright colours!\u2019  Looking back, at least I can say that this match was memorable. There were emotions, intrigue and betrayal. Because the truth is that for every time Wales fell short with heroic misfortune, there were numerous other failures without anecdote or narrative. The only reason I know I watched Wales lose 0-1 to Georgia in 1995 was that, when I came to school the next day, my friends said they had seen me on TV. Apparently, the camera had zoomed in on me eating a huge, flappy burger that my dad had bought at half-time. As I bit down on one side of the bun, the other side flared open and all the ketchup and juices came oozing out so that \u2013 and here my friends may have been editorialising \u2013 it looked like when a boxer gets punched in the mouth, all the dangling strings of blood and saliva. My point is that I have zero recall of what happened on the pitch that day. Apparently Vinnie Jones got a red card and Georgi Kinkladze scored an elegant chip. I couldn\u2019t possibly comment. For many years, watching the Welsh football team was like this \u2013 an exercise in forgetting. These were nights on which no dreams were made.    Kofi Roberts, 30: \u2018The bucket hat represents pride and being Welsh. And we\u2019re going all the way to the final.\u2019 Tamara Roberts, 28: \u2018Wearing it shows we\u2019re thrilled at what we have achieved as a country\u2019  All of which is to say how strange it is that we find ourselves here, with Wales preparing for their third major tournament in less than a decade \u2013 and this time a World Cup. And what\u2019s more, the team projects infectious positivity as players and fans all sing Yma O Hyd, a heartfelt folk song that feels like the antithesis of your typical football singalong, not least because its first verse describes the history of our nation in the year 383. There\u2019s also the fact that football \u2013 at least when I was growing up in Swansea \u2013 was always seen as insufficiently or incorrectly Welsh, and clearly inferior to rugby. That\u2019s not the case any more. Obviously it helps that the country has a talented generation of footballers, but there\u2019s been a cultural shift, too, a sense of Welsh football finding itself.   Back row, from left: Richard Davies, 39, Tom James, 37, and Corey Glover, 26. In front: Brady Davies (left), 10, and Ollie James, 12. \u2018The hat shows other countries who we are\u2019  One symbol of that new identity is \u2013 stay with me \u2013 a garish yellow, green and red bucket hat. To borrow a phrase from Dylan Thomas, it is an ugly, lovely hat. Look at any picture of the Red Wall \u2013 as Wales\u2019s hardcore fans are known \u2013 and you\u2019ll see dozens and dozens of bucket-headed supporters so that, in fact, the wall is not just red but also daffodil-coloured. After Wales beat Ukraine to qualify for the World Cup in Qatar, the TV coverage returned to the studio where former Welsh internationals Ashley Williams and Danny Gabbidon were sitting, giggling, dressed in their three-piece suits with wincingly bright bucket hats on their heads. This was not \u2013 could not be \u2013 a matter of fashion.     Steffan Griffith, 24, and Charlotte Richards, 27: \u2018We like the way they look, plus it\u2019s fun spotting other fans.\u2019 Cath Brenton and Julie Hughes: \u2018The hat\u2019s a symbol of Welsh pride\u2019  The original hat\u2019s creator, Tim Williams, explains that for decades he travelled to watch Wales play \u2013 trips as far as Belgrade and Moscow: \u201cAll those defeats along the way, wondering if our time would ever come.\u201d He decided to start making his own shirts and hats because he was bored of wearing the same old replica kits and thought others fans might feel the same. This was in 2010 when, as he tells me from his shop in Bala, Gwynedd, \u201cWales weren\u2019t so good.\u201d He would come back from his job at a builders\u2019 merchants to stay up into the night, packing and sending out parcels. He named his company Spirit of \u201958, in reference to the last time Wales made it to a World Cup. (They played Brazil in the quarter-finals, losing to a scuffed goal by a skinny teenager called Pel\u00e9.) He says the bucket hat \u2013 inspired by his love of the Stone Roses \u2013 was \u201conly to bring a bit of colour and fun\u201d to the games. Almost apologetically, he admits, \u201cI know it\u2019s not for everyone.\u201d But \u2013 much like the team itself \u2013 the hat has gone farther than he, and anyone, expected. As the team improved, so his business picked up until one day: \u201cI came home from Bosnia [where Wales had qualified for Euro 2016] and handed in my notice for the day job.\u201d    Stacey, 37, Celt, 10, Fflur, 12, and Ceri Adams-Lewis, 45: \u2018Going to a Wales game without the hat doesn\u2019t feel right. It\u2019s become a terrace cult thing.\u2019 Viv Brooks, 76: \u2018I\u2019d like Bonnie Tyler to give a rousing team talk!\u2019  It was here, playing at their first major competition in 58 years, that Welsh football found its moment of iconography. They had reached the quarter-finals which, in itself, was hard to believe, and were now drawing 1-1 with Belgium \u2013 the highest ranked team at the tournament. On the 55th minute, Hal Robson-Kanu \u2013 a player out of contract at Championship side Reading \u2013 received the ball on the penalty spot, surrounded by defenders, at which point he performed the most elegant of feints \u2013 a Cruyff turn that wrong-footed his opponents, sending three Belgians stumbling away into oblivion \u2013 before he calmly slotted the ball home. As he ran down the sidelines grinning, the overwhelming feeling was disbelief. This was not the kind of thing that happens to us.   Back row, from left: Oliver Williams, Harvey Gray, Jesse Meacock, Toby Jones and Joshua Leonard-Cole, all 14 and players for Welsh Academy League-topping Pontardawe U14s, except for Harvey, who plays for Swansea City Academy U14s. Front row: Danny Todd (left) and Rio Gray, both 9. \u2018The hats look cool\u2019  Six years later and we are almost \u2013 almost \u2013 getting used to it. When I speak to Williams, he has just received a shipment of 500 pairs of Robson-Kanu-themed socks. He also now makes pin badges, mugs, cycling vests, bibs, beach towels and more \u2013 while the Spirit of \u201958 edition of the bucket hat sells for \u00a385 on eBay. As he explains, the hat has become a kind of homing beacon for travelling Welsh fans. \u201cWhen you\u2019re hundreds of miles away and walking down a high street, you can see it instantly,\u201d he says, \u201cand it gets everyone talking. It brings people together.\u201d This reminds me of the Welsh FA\u2019s recent marketing slogan Together, Stronger \u2013 which arguably sounds like the bland motto of a building society, except that it genuinely seems to capture an attitude among the team. Despite the range of personalities and backgrounds among the players \u2013 those who speak Welsh and those who do not, those who grew up in Wales and those who did not, those who are multimillionaire global stars and those like Kieffer Moore who, until recently, was playing non-league football while still working as a lifeguard in Truro \u2013 there is room for everyone beneath the capacious, absurd bucket hat.    Julia Ford, Ash Grove and Rosa Grove: \u2018The hat represents being a part of the group, like England have the Three Lions.\u2019 Paul Kavanagh, 50, and Robin O\u2019Brien, 27: \u2018The hat has given a kind of collective identity to us eternal underdogs! We are going to lift the Cup this year (in our bucket hats!)\u2019  And apart from this profound symbolism, let\u2019s not forget that the hat also, you know, keeps the sun off. It offers comprehensive neck coverage, which is what our fans will need in the punishing heat of Qatar as they watch Wales crush England in the groups, then make their inevitable, unstoppable progress towards the trophy. This is such a strange feeling. I\u2019m not even sure if I\u2019m joking.  Joe Dunthorne is a Welsh novelist."

                    "body": "The prospect of an unprecedented shared T20 World Cup title is looming with an inclement weather forecast for Sunday in Melbourne threatening to wash out the final between England and Pakistan. In what would be a first for cricket, the 2022 finalists could be crowned joint world champions if rain hits the MCG as expected over the weekend and lingers into Monday. There is a 95% chance of rain in Melbourne on Sunday, with up to 25mm predicted to fall by the Bureau of Meteorology, and a chance of a possibly severe thunderstorm. Play is scheduled to start at 7pm AEDT (8am GMT) but with a washout possible, the game could spill over to the reserve day on Monday, when play would start at 3pm local time.  Unfortunately for the tournament organisers, the ICC, the forecast then is only marginally better with slightly less rainfall expected, but still with a chance of another thunderstorm. If rain prevents any prospect of play, England and a resurgent Pakistan face the bizarre situation of being forced to share the trophy in what would be an underwhelming and disappointing conclusion to the tournament. To constitute a match, a minimum of 10 overs is required per team, unlike the group stage when only five overs per side were needed to complete a game. If play starts on Sunday and is later stopped the game will resume on Monday from where it left off. Melbourne has an indoor venue, Marvel Stadium, only 5km away from the MCG but there is no chance the ICC will consider moving the game to the Docklands ground. It comes after three games at the MCG during the group stage were abandoned due to wet weather without a ball being bowled \u2013 including Australia\u2019s showdown with England \u2013 and another match was shortened because of rain."

                    "body": "If Graham Arnold was reaching for the panadol to deal with selection headaches back in September, he might need something a little bit stronger at this point. With Australia\u2019s opening game of the World Cup against France just over two weeks away, deliberation time has run out for the Socceroos boss. There is no more football left to be played and no more opportunities to make cases for selection; 1,153 days after the Socceroos began their journey to Qatar, Arnold will on Tuesday name the 26 players he will take to the biggest sporting event on the planet. But unfortunately for Arnold, while the majority of his squad appears largely settled \u2013 the names of \u201c15 or 16 players\u201d were effectively decided on two months ago and several others have bolstered their cases since \u2013 the picture surrounding the final slots became no clearer across the weekend, particularly for those plying their trade in the Australian top flight.  \u201cIf you think too much about it it can affect your mentality and focus going into games,\u201d said Melbourne City attacker Mat Leckie. \u201cAt the end of the day, the only thing we can do is perform for our clubs and get ourselves in tip-top shape. And then it\u2019s up to Arnie.\u201d Admittedly, for players such as Leckie, the stakes associated with the opening weeks of the ALM season have been low. One of Arnold\u2019s defining features as a coach is his loyalty to his players and he will be loth to drop any that brought him to this point. This will only be heightened by the injuries, lack of club minutes, or some combination of the two that have befallen so many in the months leading into the tournament. The sudden uncertainty surrounding those that would have been considered cornerstones may make the pragmatic Arnold think twice about pulling too many shocks at the selection table. Coming from a position in which he has likely been protecting a position rather than trying to earn one, Leckie\u2019s spot in Qatar was likely secure even without taking into account his important contributions to City\u2019s undefeated start to the domestic season. The same goes for his teammate Jamie Maclaren, whose brace against Perth Glory on Saturday brings him up to seven goals in five games to start the season. Adelaide United winger Craig Goodwin, who has returned to fitness after battling injuries to lead the league in chance creation, is in a similar position, while penalty-shootout hero Andrew Redmayne has avoided falling into a crevice while keeping goal for Sydney FC and will almost certainly also be on the final list. But it all cannot be that easy. Across the last round of ALM before Arnold lays down his squad, City attacker Marco Tilio, Central Coast Mariners duo Garang Kuol and Jason Cummings, and Macarthur dynamo Daniel Arzani took to the field with what was likely just a single spot on the plane up for grabs \u2013 and that is excluding Roma\u2019s Australia-born, Italy junior international Cristian Volpato from the equation. Melbourne Victory romped to a 4-0 win over the Newcastle Jets with Chris Ikonomidis, Nick D\u2019Agostino, and Jake Brimmer all contributing, but the run of three straight games without a goal prior to Friday evening\u2019s dominant display has cast a shadow. Based on form, the player with the strongest resume from the 2022-23 season is Cummings. The Scotland-born attacker has played a key role in three of his side\u2019s four games to start the season and had a signature one-goal and three-assist performance against Western United in round four. Cummings, however, is attempting to break into a largely settled centre-forward group and was largely overshadowed by Kuol in the Mariners\u2019 3-0 win over Western Sydney on Saturday after the 18-year-old yet again turned the game on its head when introduced as a substitute. Kuol\u2019s latest eye-catching display off the bench came after Tilio netted his second goal of the season in City\u2019s win over Glory earlier in the day; the winger finished strongly after a switch to the left in the second half. The question for Tilio is if his combined 18 minutes across the season\u2019s two rounds will cost him at the selection table. With just one match-winning performance under his belt so far this season, Arzani started farthest back of the quartet of hopefuls when he made the trip to Wellington. An assist and another strong individual performance followed \u2013 the 23-year-old leads the league in dribbles attempted and is second in successful dribbles \u2013 but his side\u2019s 4-1 loss and his marker Callan Elliot scoring up the opposite end may have ended his hopes. Possible Socceroos squad: Mat Ryan, Mitch Langerak, Andrew Redmayne, Aziz Behich, Joel King, Harry Souttar, Kye Rowles, Trent Sainsbury, Milos Degenek, Bailey Wright, Nathaniel Atkinson, Fran Karacic, Aaron Mooy, Jackson Irvine, Ajdin Hrustic, Cam Devlin, Riley McGree, Craig Goodwin, Denis Genreau, Awer Mabil, Martin Boyle, Mat Leckie, Garang Kuol, Mitch Duke, Jamie Maclaren, Adam Taggart."

We have to fight. We have to perform and score some goals to present the brave people of Iran with a result. I hope conditions change as to the expectations of the people.\u201d\nA popular uprising has been gaining momentum since September after the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22\u2011year\u2011old detained by the country\u2019s morality police for allegedly not covering her head properly.\nSince then protests against the rules forcing women to wear the hijab have expanded into widespread discontent with the country\u2019s strict theocracy, with more than 380 people said to have been killed by security forces.\n\nAs a byproduct Carlos Queiroz\u2019s team have been placed in the unenviable position of being required to represent the Islamic republic while being under intense pressure to support millions of protesting compatriots. \u201cThe situation in Iran is very difficult,\u201d said Hajsafi, who is aware human rights groups have called for Iran\u2019s expulsion from the World Cup.\nTellingly, before taking questions he opened by offering support for those who had lost loved ones during the recent turmoil. \u201cI would like to express my condolences to all the bereaved families,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should know we are with them, we support them and we sympathise with them.\u201d\nA key moment will arrive shortly before kick-off when members of a squad thought to be still slightly divided as to how to respond must take individual decisions as to whether to sing a national anthem, all about glorifying the 1979 revolution.\nIt all dictated that, at the end of a day in which light winds whipped through Doha, creating piles of dust at almost every turn, Queiroz found himself at the eye of a diplomatic sandstorm he opted to ignore on Sunday.\nIran\u2019s Portuguese coach, and former assistant to Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United, preferred to concentrate on a different type of whirlwind. \u201cEngland have a storm of talent,\u201d the 69-year-old said as he smothered Gareth Southgate with flattery. \u201cEngland are one of the top teams in the world. They are a contender to be world champion. They have fantastic, strong talent and a great coach.\u201d\n\nIt will be the first time Queiroz has faced England and he claimed not to have sought any advice from Ferguson. \u201cI did not receive any help from Scotland,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course we talk frequently as friends. But you can relax!\u201d\nHe then launched into an ode to English players, claiming they were superior to the team of recent predecessors dominated by David Beckham, Rio Ferdinand and Paul Scholes. \u201cThis new generation of players Southgate is bringing for the national team in my opinion is probably the most competitive English team since 1966 that I have the opportunity to see \u2013 and I remember that team very well. But this team is very functional, very practical, very realistic.\n\u201cI worked with the generation of Rio, of Paul Scholes. Fantastic players, David Beckham and all those guys. But this national team is really different. They make a realistic approach to every single game which makes them very, very dangerous.\u201d\nAlthough Queiroz said Iran believed they could reach the knockout stage he confessed Monday would contain a surreal quality. \u201cFor many of our players to play against England is like magic, it\u2019s a gift,\u201d he said. \u201cSince watching football as kids, it\u2019s been a lifelong dream for my players to play in this game. We will enjoy it.\u201d"

                    "body": "Tite had just pledged to dance along with his Brazil squad, and to hell with the churls, when he alighted upon another form of visual display. \u201cWhen we paint a painting, the entire painting is the athletes,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are the ones who are portrayed in this painting and we are just participants. We just contribute to the painting; the painting is just the players themselves.\u201d\nIf they are to draw a line under two barren decades, Brazil will have to master all the arts. The choreographed routines that greeted each goal against South Korea were looked upon dimly in some quarters but that is a trifling concern. The more pressing theme is whether Croatia, with their savvy and seasoned core, will allow as many opportunities for festivity when they face Tite\u2019s players in the last eight.\nThe \u201cCroatian resilience\u201d was a theme in his pre-match pronouncements. It will be Brazil\u2019s toughest hurdle yet by some distance: there is no chance Zlatko Dalic will tell his side to leave gaps in the manner of South Korea, who entertained but were glaringly open. Croatia will sit down, strap in and try to lead Brazil along the slow road.\n\u201cWe want to score goals quickly so later we can feel more comfortable,\u201d Tite said. But unless Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior, Neymar, Richarlison and their cohort can repeat Monday\u2019s explosive start, the momentum may begin to shift glacially.\n\nThat is what happened when Croatia slowly took the wind out of Japan, eking a victory on spot-kicks for the third time in their past five knockout ties. \u201cWe have developed a mental strength and a certain consistency in extra time and penalties,\u201d said Luka Modric, who appeared with Dalic moments after Tite.\n\u201cSo if it comes to that our last match is confirmation we can do it again. We\u2019re prepared for anything.\u201d\nAnother exit at this stage would not be enough for Brazil, although a garrulous Tite showed little sign of strain. He played along with the suggestion of potential mascot status for the cat that interrupted a Vin\u00edcius press conference on Wednesday; if a particularly spicy question, usually on the topic of dancing, came his way he asked his interlocutor\u2019s name and fired back. \u201cI will not make comments to those who do not know Brazilian history and culture,\u201d he told one of them. \u201cI leave that noise aside. We will continue doing things our way.\u201d\n\nDalic pointed out that a third quarter-final for a country of 3.9 million people is nothing to be sniffed at. Expectations have been raised by their performance four years ago and he equated Friday\u2019s task with the game that proved their undoing in Russia.\n\u201cThe match ahead of us will be the most demanding game; I can compare it to France in the final. It\u2019s a great challenge for us. I wish such a difficult match was waiting for us a bit later but we\u2019re one of the teams that has reached this stage and our ambitions will not stop there.\u201d\nIn a curious climbdown, Dalic apologised for offending anyone in the winter sports fraternity who might have been upset when he said football is \u201cnot figure skating, this is a fight for a result\u201d after criticism of Croatia\u2019s muted attacking performance against Japan. They lack a reliable centre-forward and out-and-out pace on the flanks. Croatia are new and old: 18 of the squad were not around for their runners-up finish but five of the remainder have been heavily involved in Qatar. For the last game, Dalic named the oldest starting XI of any last-16 contender at a World Cup since France in the 2006 final.\n\nPatience may end up being critical for Brazil when faced with those wiles. Joyful exuberance, flicks and forehead keepy-ups will cut less ice now. The critical battle may lie in midfield, where Casemiro will be given the task of holding the fort against Modric, Mateo Kovacic and Marcelo Brozovic.\nCasemiro has played with the first two at Real Madrid; all three are battle-hardened and Tite may wrestle with the option of recalling Fred to subdue their influence. Then again, sacrificing a more creative force would risk playing into the opponents\u2019 hands.\nThat is the balance everyone must strike at this stage: idealism versus the understanding that these evenings often find a way of becoming protracted, tortuous, tense. The fine details matter more than ever.\nTite was accompanied by his assistant Cl\u00e9ber Xavier, who answered a question about how Modric might be stifled. He had begun to suggest work off the ball would rival combinations on it in terms of importance when he was half-jokingly reminded by his boss: \u201cWe must not give away our strategy.\u201d\nDalic was far happier to expound his theories on gaining the upper hand. \u201cIf we play wide we\u2019ll have great problems, we know that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when they lose the ball they have high pressing and if they do not take control of the ball in the next couple of seconds they have problems as well. We must retain possession.\u201d\nModric is more than capable of that, painting the type of picture Tite would rather not have to admire. It may become an occasion for the cinematic, the moment of brutal, decisive drama, rather than the deftly textured collage Brazil\u2019s manager would like. The Sele\u00e7\u00e3o would win awards for self-expression across most media but next comes a challenge in mise-en-sc\u00e8ne."

                    "body": "Graham Arnold says he can see \u201cin their faces\u201d that his preferred World Cup starting lineup will be ready to go again against Argentina, but he will wait until match day to name it after having some \u201chonest conversations\u201d with players about their physical state.\nThe Socceroos are preparing for their biggest match in history on Saturday night (Sunday 6am AEDT) at the Ahmad bin Ali Stadium, where every member of the squad wants to play for a place in the quarter-finals. Arnold has kept faith in a largely unchanged XI in Qatar but faces the prospect of having to rotate his squad to cater for Fifa\u2019s condensed schedule, which has drawn criticism from players and coaches under the physical strain of a three-day turnaround between the group stage and last 16.\n\nFor only the second time in his tenure, he will wait until match day to name his team. \u201cWe need 24 hours,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cBut I can see it in their faces, I can see it in their eyes. It\u2019s something that I\u2019m quite decent at \u2013 I can see it in their energy and their fatigue, and there is no fatigue. They don\u2019t have any, they\u2019re ready. This is a moment in their life that they\u2019re all grabbing hold of.\u201d\nThe Socceroos have been regulars at Aspetar, the internationally renowned sports science hospital next to their training base, Aspire Academy, for a full-body survey of their physical condition. The players also have access to doctors, sports scientists, physiotherapists and massage therapists around the clock, along with anti-gravity treadmills and altitude rooms.\n\n\u201cThey have got everything there for us, you can ride a bike in the pool, you can do everything,\u201d said Mat Leckie, who said he was \u201cexhausted\u201d after playing a starring role with a solo goal against Denmark.\n\u201cWe\u2019re very lucky to have that, it has been a massive advantage, especially given the intensity we play. We know as a team that we need to work harder and win our physical battles to get results. That has been the success for us, it\u2019s massive to get our bodies right for the game.\u201d\nArnold said he would partly rely on players\u2019 honesty in telling coaching staff if they were not fit to start against Argentina. \u201cIt will be an honest conversation for myself and the players,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause I know that every one of those players wants to start, but it\u2019s not about them \u2013 it\u2019s about the team and the nation.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got great medical staff and I sit down pretty much always with the individual to see how he is personally and professionally, and if there is a player who feels he can\u2019t start, he\u2019s got to be honest and let us make those changes. And he may come on for the last half-hour, so instead of starting you can come on and finish it for us.\u201d"

                    "body": "  3.04am    Well thank you so much for joining me for this quarter-final, whether that be staying up to watch or starting your day early! England were clinical in terrible conditions to get the win over Australia but despite the score line they were challenged by their opposition. The Red Roses march on and they will play either Canada or the USA, that quarter-final is kicking off at 3.30am GMT. Have a great rest of your weekend!     2.57am    This is the ninth time England have reached the semi-final stage of the World Cup, a familiar stage for them!     2.49am    Player of the Match Marlie Packer told ITV: \u201cEverything about this is about him [my son. I am here to do a job with England and to put those performances on, not just for me or Oliver but for the team. \u201cAustralia were fantastic today but we will build from this to the next one.\u201d And on her progression: \u201cI love the game, it drives me. For anyone to get involved, your local club at grassroots. Even if you don\u2019t aspire to play for your country.\u201d     2.44am    England head coach Simon Middleton told ITV: \u201cI don\u2019t think we could have imagined how difficult the conditions were going to be. I thought we managed the game brilliantly. \u201cSarah Hunter, record performance and that is so Sarah. It would have been so easy to get distracted but she turned it on. Marlie, another player on the march. You could go through the whole match, Bern on her 5oth had a great game.\u201d And on squad for semi: \u201cTo be honest we will have a look on how everyone has gone and how they brush up tomorrow It is a six day turn around. Canada or USA it\u2019s going to be physical either way.\u201d     2.40am    A real highlight of England\u2019s game today was their domination at the scrum. Given the amount of handling errors there were a lot of the set pieces and England managed to push Australia backwards time and time again.     2.34am    England captain Sarah Hunter told ITV: \u201cI think the thing that tops it all off has been the win. That is the focus, we are in knock-out rugby\u2026 Winning in this means the record cap number is even sweeter\u2026 It has been so surreal, I have had the most amazing support. \u201cNever in a million years [did I think I would break the record]. I just wanted one cap. I just wnated to play for England. I kept hanging on, it is like an addiction. The feeling to play for your country\u2026 hopefully there is more to come.\u201d On the match: \u201cIt was all about making sure we go that victory. We managed to assert ourselves, Australia were tough but I am pleased about how we overcame that.\u201d     2.29am    England are through but they do not know who they will be facing yet as the final quarter-final is to come. Canada play the USA and the winner of that will have England.     2.24am    Australian players embrace as their World Cup journey is over, it must be heart-breaking but England were just too much for them today.     2.23am   Full-time: England 41-5 Australia  England secure their semi-final with a business-like performance against Australia. The first half was tricky with conditions but they will take the win.     2.22am   TRY! England 41-5 Australia (Packer, 80)  Packer has her hat-trick as she reaps the reward from the driving maul. Rowland converts!  Updated at 2.22am GMT    2.21am    79 min: Botterman knocks on in attack, handling errors are ever the weak link in England\u2019s play. But they do come forward again as they run through the phases but it is called back for a deliberate knock on. Rowland kicks to the corner as England look to see this out with a try.     2.19am    77 min: Australia win the scrum penalty but all the good work comes undone once with a knock on. England\u2019s scrum is reset but they come away with it in the end.     2.17am    75 min: England charge it down but Australia do enough to keep it, that is well done. England knock on in defence and Australia\u2019s scrum is clean but they have a loose pass and Davies will have a line-out. It is good and they are marching to the line but Australia win the penalty! A great penalty for the Aussies and a well deserved one, despite the scoreline their defence has stood better than most against England.     2.13am    72 min: Andy has got in touch on Twitter and said: \u201cIs it the wind causing all the missed kicks, England going over at the corners, or Scarrett has toblerone shaped boots on?\u201d The conditions have not been perfect but Scarratt could have done a lot better with a few of those kicks. Something she\u2019ll sharpen I am sure before their semi-final which they are likely to have now. Australia on the attack.     2.11am    71 min: Australia come away with it but they have to build from deep here. They opt to kick and England knock on in the air and so Australia play on with an advantage. They eventually kick away and England have it through Kildunne, then M Packer and they keep on coming. But it\u2019s a forward pass from Galligan.     2.09am    69 min: Rowland has another knock on, her third of the match. It\u2019s an Australian scrum and they come away with it quickly. They want to hit England here, just need to be clinical. But Parry loses the ball and England kick it upfield. Kildunne does well to collect but there\u2019s a knock on, Aussie scrum to come. Scarratt is off for Aitchison.     2.07am    67 min: It is turning into a real England show now as Australia pile up the errors. Kildunne and Galligan are on for England.     2.04am   TRY! England 34-5 Australia (Matthews, 65')  Australia did so well to keep England out for a long time and to not give away a penalty in that last attack but England keep knocking and Matthews is over. Scarratt\u2019s kick is missed.  Updated at 2.05am GMT    2.02am    63 min: Davies loses it over the line but Australia gave away another penalty. The referee warns them once more, Harrison kicks to the corner again.     2.01am    62 min: England have some slick play with Matthews getting a break and they get the advantage. Harrison puts in a cross field kick but Scarratt can\u2019t quite collect, we come back to advantage and Harrison kicks to the corner. Before the line-out Infante is off for Packer.     1.58am    60 min: Botterman thinks she has grounded that but the referee is having none of it, saying she spilled it. England aren\u2019t happy with that and on the replays you can see why. Goal line drop out for Australia and England are on the attack again.     1.56am    58 min: Australia knock on through Kemp and England have the scrum, much to the delight of Packer who is picked up on the ref mic. There\u2019s a reset but England come away with it and kick away. Pauline Piliae-Rasabale kicks back but it goes straight out of play.     1.54am    56 min: Muir and Botterman are also on for Bern and Corborough for England. Australia win a breakdown penalty with Botterman immediately giving ne away. Leonard is also off for Naiqama. Rowland spills once more and Australia will have the scrum.     1.52am    54 min: England make their first changes as Davies and Cleall are on for Cokayne and Hunter. Australia are building from deep here.     1.50am   TRY! England 29-5 Australia (Cokayne, 52')  Packer peels off the back of the maul and she offloads to Cokayne who dots down. Scarratt misses again.  Updated at 1.51am GMT    1.49am    52 min: Robinson gives away a penalty and England clear their lines. The line-out is clean and England are marching forward here. Harrison puts in a cross field kick but England were playing with the advantage. They kick to the corner.     1.47am    49 min: There\u2019s a slight break in play before we get back underway with some changes for Australia - Robinson is on for Patu and Korpani is on for O\u2019Gorman.     1.46am    49 min: England come away with it but Rowland drops and Australia have the scrum. England have a huge shove but Australia still come away with it. I have to say Australia look more secure with wide ball in hands, just as I type that they knock on. Classic commentators curse.      1.44am    47 min: The kicking game comes into play and Harrison loses with the fly-half dropping it badly as she looks to pass. An Australian scrum is clean and they are on the run! But a forward pass harks them back and England have the scrum.     1.42am    45 min: Australia on the attack here, there first opportunity of this half. But they knock on and England look to counter.     1.40am   TRY! England 24-5 Australia (Ward, 43')  And just as I talk the Australia defence up, the TMO rules Ward\u2019s shot wasn\u2019t held up! Scarratt\u2019s kick is missed.  Updated at 1.41am GMT    1.39am    43 min: Oh wow, wow, wow. England players cheer like mad but Australia hold them up. The Australia defence is seriously impressive here, yes England have some tries but Australia have stopped many chances. The TMO has spotted something for a check.     1.37am    42 min: England showing the attack early in the second half with Heard and Thompson shining so far. Scarratt kicks the ball through and Dow ensures it is an England line-out. The driving maul to come\u2026     1.36am   Back underway! England 19-5 Australia  Can Australia capitalise on that try? Or will England close this out? We will soon find out \u2026     1.32am    I saw a tweet from the Rugby World Cup account saying Hunter not only becomes the most capped England player in this game, but the most capped women\u2019s player of all time.      1.27am    I just checked the time and got really confused as it\u2019s 1.25am here in England. But the clocks went back at 2am, I have mentioned this already this morning but just wanted to note my confusion!     1.22am   Half-time: England 19-5 Australia  England will be frustrated to give away that try at the death of the half there but they are still in control of this one. Two Packer tries and a score from Hunter sees them 19-5 up but Australia can take a lot of heart from Chancellor\u2019s score.     1.20am   TRY! England 19-5 Australia (Chancellor, 40')  Wow! Australia run it through the hands quickly and Chancellor picks a great line to crash over. I like to think my last post pushed them over the line! The conversion is missed  Updated at 1.21am GMT    1.19am    39 min: Parry is back from her sin binning but England have taken full control of this one. It feels as though Australia need to be the next to score.      1.17am   TRY! England 19-0 Australia (Packer, 38')  England kick to the corner and the line-out works well again, Bern runs off the back to make great metres. They run through the phases and it is a bit of Packer magic that gets them over! Scarratt has the extras!  Updated at 1.18am GMT    1.15am    37 min: The line-out is good and McKenzie opts to kick to clear which gives England another opportunity. O\u2019Gorman gives away a breakdown penalty and there is a break in play as some players receive some treatment.     1.13am    35 min: Officially a giant has got in touch on Twitter and said: \u201cWith that amount of water on the pitch you have to ask yourself is it actually safe to play.\u201d I can imagine there would have been some sort of pitch inspection but I\u2019m unsure, I\u2019ll see if I can find out about that. Back to the game, Hamilton does really well at the breakdown to keep the ball with Australia. The box kick is charged down by Infante but it goes out of play.     1.11am    33 min: England have the scrum after another knock on but it is not surprising with this torrential rain. Infante passes from the back and they kick away but Piliae-Rasabale responds with a great kick of her own to reach halfway. England\u2019s line-out is good again but Aldcroft loses it in the resulting phases.     1.08am   TRY! England 12-0 Australia (Packer, 31')  The driving maul comes true again, this time Packer on the end. Scarratt can\u2019t add teh extras.  Updated at 1.08am GMT    1.07am    30 min: It looks like Packer has held up her own try! So no try and we are coming back to an earlier penalty so England still have all the pressure. Harrison will kick to the corner and the referee warns Australia again.     1.06am    29 min: England opt for the scrum and they are marching toward the line. They wing it out to Rowland and Packer thinks she is over but the referee can\u2019t see a grounding. TMO check to come.     1.05am   YELLOW CARD! England 7-0 Australia (Parry, 28')  They had been warned and Parry is sent to the bin.     1.04am    28 min: Australia have the line-out but Talakai\u2019s throw isn\u2019t straight, England opt for the line-out. They come away with it and are on the attack, can they capitalise this time? No they cannot, Rowland\u2019s pass is straight out of play. Australia\u2019s line-out is loose again, Bern gathers and they are on the hunt here.     1.02am    26 min: Packer takes it quickly and Ward knocks on, after all that build up England have not got points to back it up. Australia\u2019s scrum is good and they are able to kick to clear. Aldcroft rejoins the game.     1.00am    24 min: England thought they were over but the referee brings it back for a penalty as Australia ping at the maul. The official has had a word with Parry, anymore penalties here and there will be a card. Harrison is back to the corner.     1.59am    24 min: Aldcroft may not be in the scrum but England continue to dominate. The side have the penalty as McKenzie is offside and Harrison kicks to the corner. Could we see the driving maul? We will and they are on the charge.     1.57am    22 min: It is short and the referee says she blew her whistle too soon and so we have an England scrum five metres out.      1.57am    22 min: England win the scrum penalty and decide to run it, potentially running down Aldcroft\u2019s yellow. After a few phases Harrison kicks to the corner with pressure on Australia\u2019s line-out. It is clean but Australia knock on and England are on the attack \u2013 they are just metres away. Sarah Bern thinks she is over but the referee is checking this.     1.55am    20 min: Cramer doesn\u2019t have enough on it and England are able to clear their lines. People will debate whether it was the right decision rather than go for the corner but with these conditions you never know what could happen! McKenzie has a great take in the air but she knocks on the floor, England scrum     1.53am    18 min: Is anyone else nervous? Knock-out rugby just hits different! This time Australia\u2019s line-out is good, they look like they have knocked on but England are offside first. They point to the sticks with Cramer kicking, they need to make England pay for these errors while they can.     1.51am    17 min: England fans will breathe a sigh of relief that wasn\u2019t a red, there was some head contact but there were mitigating factors. Australia kick to the corner, they could strike back here. But England disrupt their line-out once more, a real weakness for Australia so far. As England look to attack they are pulled back for obstruction.     1.49am   YELLOW CARD! England 7-0 Australia (Aldcroft, 16')  It\u2019s a clear out from Zoe Aldcroft, she comes in late with some head contact.     1.48am    15 min: We are checking for foul play here, time is off. We\u2019re looking at a clear out from an England player.     1.47am    15 min: There\u2019s another sloppy Australian line-out and Packer collects to put England on the attack once more. Some great defence from Australia though with Hamilton putting in a good hit on Infante to get the breakdown penalty. And you have guessed it \u2013 another scrum.     1.45am    13 min: Harrison gives away with penalty at the breakdown with great work from Parry, they kick to the corner. Talakai\u2019s throw isn\u2019t straight at the line-out though and England have the scrum. England come away with it and kick to clear but they don\u2019t find touch and Parry collects. But Australia knock on shortly after, another scrum to come. I feel there will be a lot of scrums in this match.     1.42am    10 min: When I say the weather is bad, I live in England and I haven\u2019t seen rain like this is a while! England are in possession again but they are deep in their own half. They kick away and McKenzie does well in tricky conditions to gather the ball.     1.40am   TRY! England 7-0 Australia (Hunter, 8')  The ball is forward from Packer but we come back for the advantage, England opt for the scrum. Before the set piece Shannon Parry receives some attention but she will remain on the pitch. The scrum is clean from England and they attack again. Hunter directs the ball over \u2013 a fairytale start for the record breaker. Scarratt adds the extras.  Updated at 1.40am BST    1.37am    6 min: England kick away through Emily Scarratt and Australia knock on shortly after. England scrum just a few metres out but before we get to the set piece Cokayne receives some attention but she is okay to continue. England win the scrum penalty and we go again. Hunter is controlling the ball at the back and they win the advantage. England come forward still.     1.35am    4 min: It\u2019s a great shove from England who come away with it and are quick to run it wide. Lydia Thompson does well to keep it in play as the team build from deep. England knock on but we come back for an earlier advantage for a high tackle. Zoe Harrison clears and Amy Cokayne\u2019s resulting line-out is clean. The driving maul, deadly as it is, is dealt with well by Australia! England still coming.     1.33am    2 min: The pitch is a puddle, the water kicking up everywhere. Abby Dow knocks on and we have the first scrum of the morning/evening. Australia come away with it and they look to hit England early doors. There\u2019s a loose pass and England manage to regather. Another scrum, this time it is England\u2019s put in.     1.31am   Kick-off! England 0-0 Australia  Here we go! Will favourites England seal their spot or can Australia get an upset? All to come \u2026     1.27am    Sarah Hunter\u2019s class is shown once again as she puts her player Sarah Bern up front to lead the team out on her 50th cap. Hunter is all smiles, what a moment for a legend of the game.     1.25am    The players are out on the pitch and the anthems will soon be in full flow! Are you ready for this one? The awful weather could play its part but England will remain favourites in this one.     1.19am    Have a read of Sarah Hunter\u2019s rugby journey here ahead of her 138th cap:      1.14am    Our man on the ground Rob Kitson has the weather report:      1.09am    England player Abbie Ward has said there is more to come from the side, saying: \u201cWe\u2019re in third gear - you\u2019ve seen glimpses but you\u2019ve seen moments where we weren\u2019t quite accurate enough. The group stages is not where we want to peak.\u201d      1.02am    Scott Fava, Australia\u2019s assistant coach, says his side are in the better position in the fixture: \u201cOur mindset is the same as it was for the opening game (against New Zealand) \u2013 there is no pressure on us, the pressure is on England to perform.\u201d     12.52am    England head coach Simon Middleton has said about Australia: \u201cThey\u2019ve started off really well. They play a very expansive brand of rugby, and had the hosts New Zealand down 17-0 in no time in the opening game [Black Ferns eventually winning 41-17] so we know it\u2019s going to be really tough. They\u2019ve got some really good ball carriers, lots of skill, a good Sevens influence you can see in the expansion in their play, so it\u2019s going to be a great challenge.\u201d     12.45am    Of course one semi-final line-up has already been decided with two quarter-finals taking place on Saturday. New Zealand will face France after the hosts defeated Wales and the French overcame Italy. That semi will be the later of the two on November 5. The winner of England v Australia will be competing against the victor of the later QF this morning between Canada and the USA.     12.38am    I am delaying my first cup of coffee until just before kick-off, I need to time it well so there\u2019s no caffeine crash!      12.30am    Now while we kick-off at 1.30am, the second half will also start at near enough the same time in the United Kingdom as the clocks change at 2am. How has everyone planned their watching out? Did you take a nap beforehand or have you powered through? I attempted the nap but couldn\u2019t fall asleep so I am ploughing through! Let me know via Twitter and email.     12.21am    The team news is in and Australia have made just two changes from their victory over Wales. Layne Morgan comes in at scrum-half and Pauline Piliae-Rasabale starts at full-back. Australia starting XV: Pauline Piliae-Rasabale; Bienne Terita, Georgina Friedrichs, Sharni Williams, Lori Cramer; Arabella McKenzie, Layne Morgan; Liz Patu, Adiana Talakai, Bridie O\u2019Gorman, Michaela Leonard, Grace Kemp, Emily Chancellor, Shannon Parry (captain), Grace Hamilton. Replacements: Tania Naden, Emily Robinson, Eva Karpani, Sera Naiqama, Piper Duck, Iliseva Batibasaga, Cecilia Smith, Mahalia Murphy.  England, meanwhile, have made 11 changes to their win over South Africa. Only Tatyana Heard, Zoe Harrison, Abby Dow and Marlie Packer keep their spots. As previously mentioned, Sarah Hunter wins her 138th cap and Sarah Bern comes back into the side to win her 50th. England starting XV: Helena Rowland; Lydia Thompson, Emily Scarratt, Tatyana Heard, Abby Dow; Zoe Harrison, Leanne Infante; Vickii Cornborough, Amy Cokayne, Sarah Bern, Zoe Aldcroft, Abbie Ward, Alex Matthews, Marlie Packer, Sarah Hunter (captain). Replacements: Lark Davies, Hannah Botterman, Maud Muir, Rosie Galligan, Poppy Cleall, Lucy Packer, Holly Aitchison, Ellie Kildunne.      12.15am   Preamble  Welcome back to our coverage of the Rugby World Cup with England\u2019s quarter-final against Australia! The Red Roses have so far lived up to their favourites tag, including that tight win over France, and they will once again have to prove their mettle against the Wallaroos. The two sides have not played on another since 2017 where England were the victors. So far in the tournament the Red Roses have had the better results, continuing their unbeaten run, but Australia have only fallen to one defeat - against New Zealand. And while this is knock-out rugby with all the thrills and excitement that comes with it, there is another story surrounding this match which will make it a special one. England captain Sarah Hunter will win her 138th cap which will make her the country\u2019s all time leading cap holder, eclipsing Hunter\u2019s former teammate Rocky Clark. Hunter comes back into the side to reach the milestone after not being in the matchday 23 for their final pool match against South Africa. All the team news has been released and stay tuned for all the updates ahead of kick-off at 1.30am BST.  "

                    "body": "A compelling force clearly still drives Bismarck du Plessis. He is 38 now and there is plenty else to occupy him on the family farm near Bethlehem, 165 miles due south of Johannesburg. He and his wife, Anja, already have three boys, including six-year-old identical twins, with twin girls due in March. After 79 caps for South Africa, a 2007 World Cup winner\u2019s medal and multiple other honours, the battle-scarred hooker could be excused for seeking a quieter life. And yet here he is, dragging his aching body halfway around the world to hit more rucks in Exeter on a freezing Saturday in the shadow of Christmas. The bleak midwinter challenge at Sandy Park in the Champions Cup on Saturday appears, if anything, to be an extra incentive. \u201cMy kids\u2019 godparents live not far away and they\u2019ve been sending me pictures of the snow. I\u2019ve sent them to the young boys in our squad and told them there\u2019s a rude awakening waiting for us.\u201d  The old Bull, still raging against the dying of the light. And if Du Plessis could have one final rugby wish it would be to encourage everyone to recognise and relish all that rugby can offer. His father, Francois, who taught Bismarck and his brother Jannie to love the game and motivated both of them to become indomitable Springboks, contracted Parkinson\u2019s disease when the pair were 17 and 19 and died in 2017. Ask Bismarck about the importance of preserving rugby\u2019s culture of respect and fellowship and there is a short pause. \u201cI get goosebumps when you say that,\u201d he says, softly. Playing in both hemispheres has also helped him realise the sport\u2019s best qualities are universal. When playing in France with Montpellier, he used to ask his local rugby friends why they were not pursuing football or handball instead. It turned out that, just like him, they adored the camaraderie. \u201cAt this time of the year in Europe I can\u2019t imagine it\u2019s very pleasant to go out and play rugby. It\u2019s snowing, it\u2019s freezing and the pitches are horrible. \u201cBut 99% of them told me: \u2018You will see after the game why we play rugby.\u2019 That\u2019s also what I believe rugby is about. You can absolutely annihilate each other on the field but afterwards you respect each other and enjoy spending time together. In France we\u2019d have a two-hour post-match function. By the end of my time in France it had become the best time of the week. I\u2019m fortunate enough to have made friends wherever I\u2019ve played in the world.\u201d If some of his new mates now hope Bismarck will turn the other cheek when they next collide, however, they underestimate the innate competitive edge of a champion Springbok. \u201cI will never go softer against a friend of mine. I actually go harder against my friends because then you can have quite a few laughs afterwards.\u201d Few modern players have been as unrelenting, almost to the point of obsession. At one stage, when battling a serious neck injury, he drove to training with a pillow wedged under his left arm to ease the intense pain. Needless to say, he still kept on playing. Du Plessis also tells a good story about the day the Bulls\u2019 coach, Jake White, whom he has known since he was a teenager, coaxed him out of retirement. \u201cWhen I stopped at Montpellier last year I didn\u2019t want to play again. I was back on the farm, on the harvester, when I suddenly got a phone call from Jake. He said: \u2018I\u2019m on your farm.\u2019 To which I replied: \u2018No, you\u2019re not, I am.\u2019 At which point he sent me a picture of himself standing there.\u201d The rest is history. White told him he wanted him to assist the Bulls\u2019 younger players and show them age is but a number. Giving something tangible back to South Africa\u2019s next generation was another spur. \u201cI was very fortunate when I was a youngster and staying in Durban in a small flat with Ruan Pienaar. Our next door neighbour was [the former Gloucester coach] Johan Ackermann. The way he treated me and the impact he had on my rugby career was immense. If I can give that back, even to half a player, that\u2019s enough for me.  In terms of character-defining life experiences Du Plessis and Jannie, a qualified doctor, have had more than their fair share. Tragedy, too. Last year Jannie\u2019s 10-month-old son drowned in a swimming pool accident and Bismarck is now even more conscious of the strictly relative nature of rugby-related aches and pains. \u201cThere are people with cancer \u2013 and look what happened to my brother last year. I\u2019m very fortunate.\u201d His time spent working, at various times, with Rassie Erasmus, Eddie Jones and Fabien Galthi\u00e9 \u2013 \u201cI know all of them personally and they all absolutely hate losing\u201d\u2013 has also persuaded him he might be able to help the Bulls coaching-wise when he finally calls it a day. Either way he reckons the game\u2019s administrators must re-examine the year-round calendar now confronting South Africa\u2019s increasingly busy players \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to play every week for 10 months of the year at the highest level\u201d \u2013 and the punishing travel itinerary which saw the Bulls wedged into economy and diverted via Doha to the UK this week. \u201cSuddenly it\u2019s a 24-hour journey when it should take about 10 hours. We\u2019re big people and you can\u2019t perform at your best when you\u2019re sitting in an airport and eating junk food.\u201d Flying to England at least revives vivid childhood memories. Growing up he used to enjoy watching the 1995 England side and South Africans also rated Clive Woodward\u2019s team of 2003. \u201cI looked up to those guys because they were a team who could perform under pressure. In South Africa we respected them for that. The English guy I respected the most was probably Jonny Wilkinson. For me he epitomises what I stand for in rugby: he might not have been the most talented but he was always working.\u201d On other days, though, it was England who felt the full force gale of Bismarck and friends, with the 36-0 pool annihilation at the 2007 World Cup \u2013 \u201cThat was one of my best games\u201d \u2013 and winning 42-6 at Twickenham in 2008 particularly memorable. So if this weekend is to be his last dance in England, what will he be thinking as he heads back to Bethlehem for Christmas? \u201cEvery time I can put my boots on I consider myself fortunate. Even if I have to finish in two weeks\u2019 time \u2013 or tomorrow \u2013 playing over 400 first-class games is something I never expected in my wildest dreams. Rugby has given me so much.\u201d The rest of us should appreciate the great ageing Bull while we still can."

                    "body": "England somersaulted and cartwheeled their way to a stunning and historic thrashing of India in Adelaide to rocket into the T20 World Cup final, as Alex Hales and Jos Buttler took on the world\u2019s best-supported and most lavishly resourced side and toyed with them like a cat might a ball of wool, making them look approximately as threatening. Pakistan await in Melbourne on Sunday, and will not have enjoyed what they saw of their opponents here. England reached 170 with all 10 wickets and four overs to spare, Hales (who scored 86 off 47) and Buttler (80 off 49) producing not just the largest but in any sense you like the greatest opening partnership in England\u2019s Twenty20 history. By the end India were a rabble, their performance summed up by England completing an all-run four, vanishingly rare in this format, after Mohammed Shami fielded and tried to toss the ball to a teammate but missed, and by Suryakumar Yadav racing back from mid-off and not only failing to catch Buttler but managing instead to shovel the ball a further 10 yards to the rope.  Poor Phil Salt, scheduled to come in at No 3 but not required. Having watched every game so far from the sidelines he was chosen to replace Dawid Malan, but still had to watch most of the game from the sidelines. It is impossible now to dispute England\u2019s decision to favour Hales as opener, and since they reached a position of having to win every remaining match he has scored 52, 47 and now 86 at an average strike rate of 158. This was a remarkably controlled innings, in which he scored at great pace but appeared in no hurry, and his best shots were not only stylish in their execution but impeccable in their timing. India for example would have hoped to use their spinners to control England\u2019s run rate but twice, against Axar Patel and Ravichandran Ashwin, Hales disabused them of that idea by sending a slog-sweep into the crowd. Buttler meanwhile had promised to show no fear of Bhuvneshwar Kumar, against whom he previously had a notably poor record. He scored 13 runs off the seven balls he faced from the 32-year-old, cracking three fours off the bowler\u2019s first over, and after his second ended with Hales dancing down the wicket to hit over long-off for six Kumar was sent to field on the boundary, never to return. Once the finish line hoved into view Buttler sprinted for it; after scoring 45 off his first 34 deliveries, he added 35 off his last 15, including the six that ended it. The ground that witnessed England\u2019s worst moment in white-ball cricket, against Bangladesh in 2015, thus witnessed what stands perhaps just the 2019 World Cup final away from their finest. This was a night when a side that had not really reached top gear at any stage in this tournament suddenly went supersonic. Though Virat Kohli scored another half-century it was Hardik Pandya, with a 33-ball 63, who was most responsible for hauling India to what appeared a reasonable total with a string of boundaries towards the end of their innings \u2013 and there would have been one more had he not stepped into the stumps while powering the last ball towards the rope. But rather than striking terror into England, his innings inspired only hope \u2013 Buttler said afterwards that Pandya had just \u201cshowed what a good wicket it was\u201d.  Pandya\u2019s innings at least turned an outright humiliation into a mere emphatic thrashing. For much of their 20 overs India were simply pedestrian, becalmed both by some excellent bowling \u2013 Adil Rashid was outstanding, going at five an over and taking the key wicket of Yadav, and Chris Jordan replaced the injured Mark Wood and took three wickets in his first game of the tournament \u2013 and some puzzling lack of ambition with the bat. England\u2019s three previous run chases in the competition, against Afghanistan, Ireland and Sri Lanka, were all uncomfortable but this was a team transformed. They took a quite different approach to their innings to India, in that they tried to score quite quickly at the beginning of it. They still had 10 balls of the powerplay remaining when they matched six-over India\u2019s total; they reached 50 off their 29th ball, when it had taken India 43. Halfway through their innings India had scored 62 off 60 balls; England were on 98. It was a spectacular vindication of Buttler\u2019s decision at the toss to chase, which while his instinct most of the time was not in keeping with the fresh consensus that has settled over this tournament. It seemed to be this consensus that informed India\u2019s innings \u2013 only one team here, and none at all in the Super 12s, had successfully chased more than 160, therefore 168 would be an excellent score. England on the other hand had been positively salivating over the state of the wicket for three days and thought there might be more runs in it. Turned out they were right."

                    "body": "Harry Kane admits that he can dwell on the misses only not for long. The problem for him after the big one against the USA in England\u2019s second group game at the World Cup was that it happened in the third minute of added time. \u201cSo you come off the pitch straight away and you know you won\u2019t get another opportunity,\u201d the captain says.\nWhen Kane crashed a free header off target from Luke Shaw\u2019s free-kick, it meant the game finished 0-0. \u201cWhen you go away and dissect it, for sure I\u2019m my own biggest critic and I know when I can do better,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cEven the first chance I had in the USA game when the guy [Walker Zimmerman] blocked it, as soon as it happened I thought I should have gone near post instead of across [goal]. When I watched it back it was probably the better option.\u201d\nIt has been a curious World Cup for Kane, the two chances against the USA his only clear ones. Before Sunday night\u2019s last-16 showdown with Senegal, he has had four attempts on goal \u2013 none of which have been on target.\nHis game has evolved, his passing increasingly to the fore; that ability to drop into pockets of space and play in a runner. The Tottenham centre-forward finished the group stage with three assists as England advanced with seven points. But Kane is Kane because of his goals and he knows, fairly or otherwise, he will be judged on how many he gets. The pressure is intense.\n\n\u201cWorld Cups and major tournaments in general are such a unique situation,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we were three games at Spurs, I\u2019d had three assists and we had won two and drawn one, everyone would probably be saying: \u2018Look at the form I\u2019m in.\u2019 Whereas when you get to a major tournament, it almost becomes the opposite. You don\u2019t score for a couple games and there\u2019s a real spotlight.\u201d\nKane does not feel the burn \u2013 mainly because of his on-pitch ability to compartmentalise. It has been said before but it is worth saying again. Unusually for a goalscorer, Kane is not a confidence player. The misses do not affect him. He always backs himself to take the next opportunity.\n\u201cIf I miss a chance or a couple of chances I think about it,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I feel like my strength of mind is when I\u2019m in the game and in the moment I am able to switch off and think about the next one that is coming my way \u2013 be ready for the next opportunity.\n\n\u201cWhen the game\u2019s over and I\u2019m back and watching the clips, for sure I look at where I could have done better with my chances. It is just about consistently doing the right things and being in the right places; not thinking too much about being somewhere, just letting it happen. Throughout my career that has made me really consistent.\u201d\nKane\u2019s mindset has been shaped by his previous tournament experiences and it is impossible not to make the comparison with the European Championship of last year. Then, as now, Kane went through the group phase without scoring, although there is a difference. Whereas he laboured sorely in those ties, his all-round play has been good in Qatar.\n\nKane cut loose in the knockout rounds at the Euros, scoring four times as England finished as the runners-up \u2013 and as he felt he would. Before the last-16 game against Germany, Kane had sat down with a group of newspaper writers and calmly explained how his previous toils meant nothing. It was all about the next chance and he would take it, which he did \u2013 igniting his tournament with the second goal in the 2-0 win.\n\u201cAt the 2018 World Cup, I scored a lot of goals in the group stage,\u201d he says, reflecting on the six that would be enough for him to win the Golden Boot. \u201cThen I felt not just my goals but my performances maybe ran out of steam at the back end of the tournament. So at the Euros, it was something I was really conscious of \u2013 trying to taper that so I was physically in a better place and hopefully score goals later in the tournament. This is similar.\n\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong. I would have loved to have scored three or four goals by now, any striker would. But I also feel I am in a good place. In the knockout games, it is where being more clinical and ruthless in taking the one chance you get becomes more important. At the Euros, it worked well for me and if I can do similar here, it will put the team in a good place.\u201d\n\nKane goes back to the start of his England journey \u2013 to Euro 2016, his first tournament, when he was put on corner-taking duty and did not score in his four appearances, culminating in the last-16 disaster against Iceland.\n\u201cI learned a lot from Euro 2016 because that was a thing I had to deal with,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt a real difference from where I was at club level to being at major tournament level. I feel like I\u2019ve learned from every tournament that has come along.\u201d\nAll of what Kane has lived now goes into the Senegal game. He has endured fitness scares, with the Spurs manager, Antonio Conte, saying just before the Premier League season paused that Kane was exhausted. Then came the knock to the top of his foot in England\u2019s opening group tie against Iran. Kane says \u201cthe foot feels good, it\u2019s got better each game\u201d and, also, that \u201cthis is the best physically I\u2019ll ever be in terms of a major tournament.\u201d (He always says that.)\nWhile passing the time at the team hotel, Kane is not gorging on the other matches. \u201cWe have them on all the time and I\u2019ll flick in and out of them,\u201d he says. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m religiously watching them. The World Cup takes a lot out of you and maybe saving a bit of energy by not watching the games is a good idea.\u201d\nKane has eyes only for the next opportunity. He is ready."

                    "body": "\u201cBy failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail,\u201d Benjamin Franklin once said. The sentiment may be squarely in the minds of the Jillaroos when they take to the field at York Community Stadium on Wednesday (Thursday morning AEDT) to kick off their Women\u2019s Rugby League World Cup campaign. Australia go into this tournament somewhat surprisingly with no warm-up games under their belt, and without having played a Test match in three years because of Covid-19. This is a green and gold squad full of inexperience, with 12 debutants and just five players remaining from their victorious 2017 World Cup-winning side.  Tournament opponents Papua New Guinea, Canada, Brazil, France and the Cook Islands have all prepared with practice matches on UK soil in the past week, with the Moana defeating England Knights 26-14 in Leeds, while the Jillaroos have been bunkered down in a brutal fitness camp in the Gold Coast. Described as \u201cas one of the hardest sessions any of us have done\u201d by forward Kennedy Cherrington, the Australians have focused inward as the rest of the world guns for them. Winners of the last two World Cups, with New Zealand taking out the three before that, the sixth staging of the tournament is being billed as the tightest yet. Expanded from six countries to eight, the Jillaroos and the Kiwi Ferns are still expected to again battle it out at the top. Australia will be confident of their chances, on the back of the growth and expansion of the NRLW competition and their enviable depth of talent. While Test matches might have been sparse since 2019, increasing standards in the NRLW and the rise of the women\u2019s State of Origin series has placed Australia in good stead. Powerful second-rower Kezie Apps, classy fullback Sammy Bremmer and veteran playmaker Ali Brigginshaw remain from the team that knocked New Zealand off in the World Cup final in Brisbane five years ago. That trio have been named co-captains for the 2022 tournament and are joined by centre Isabelle Kelly and Simaima Taufa from the 2017 side. It is a 24-player squad dominated by the Brisbane Broncos, St George Illawarra Dragons and Sydney Roosters, with the Broncos and Dragons contributing six players each and the Chooks five. The Newcastle Knights, who won this year\u2019s NRLW grand final, have just two players in the squad in forwards Yasmin Clydsdale and Caitlan Johnston, the same as their grand final opponents\u2019 Parramatta, after prop Millie Boyle and fullback Tamika Upton both pulled out. The likes of Ruan Sims, Renae Kunst and Nakia Davis-Welsh may be long gone from the international scene but the Jillaroos still have plenty of star power to rely on. There is speed out wide in Julia Robinson and Jessica Sergis, and size up front in Shannon Mato and Shaylee Bent. Considering the increased professionalism and financial rewards Australia can draw on, compared to the other countries, complacency is perhaps their biggest issue heading into the World Cup. No other nation is blessed with the same advantages or funding resources, with the Jillaroos to receive a payment of $30,000 for this tournament compared to the $3,000 they were paid in 2017. It is something coach Brad Donald, who was appointed in 2016 and has yet to lose a game since he took over, is well aware of. \u201cComplacency is going to be a great threat to the team and we\u2019ve spoken a lot about that over the last week and a half,\u201d he said. \u201cThis World Cup, compared to the last World Cup, will be miles ahead in terms of competition. There\u2019s a number of emerging young players across all of the nations which is exciting.\u201d Donald has tried to counter that through his intense warm-up camp and with a rotation policy for the group stages. With Australia playing five games in just 17 days if they qualify for the final, and with World Cup matches to be 80 minutes long instead of the 70 minutes in the NRL, it will be a hard slog. \u201cWe need all 24 players to play for the team to be successful with such a short turnaround,\u201d Donald said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see all of our players play in the first two games so I\u2019ve tried to pick two reasonably similar squads. We have a saying that pressure equals diamonds, and all of our players are competing for a spot in the third game against New Zealand, which I\u2019d suggest is the hardest game in our pool rounds and will hopefully set us up for a semi-final.\u201d The Jillaroos start with Cook Islands, then meet France on 6 November and arch rivals New Zealand on 10 November. Depending on if they top Group B or not, they are likely to face either hosts England or Papua New Guinea in the semi-finals. A date in the final on 19 November at Old Trafford may await them. But for Donald\u2019s charges, the time has come to embrace being high-profile targets in their pursuit of more silverware."

                    "body": "The buildup, hype and buzz England\u2019s women have experienced as they prepare for their tilt at the Rugby League World Cup could not be in greater contrast to the experiences of Jackie Sheldon and her squad of trailblazers 22 years ago. It may be a little over two decades but the journey women\u2019s rugby league has been on during that time feels much longer, a point that will be emphasised when Emily Rudge and her teammates kick off against Brazil on Tuesday at Headingley in front of a northern hemisphere record crowd for a women\u2019s rugby league match. It will be markedly different to what the players experienced on a series of low-key, easily overlooked nights in November 2000.  Few will look on with as much pride as Sheldon, not least because without her endeavours to stage that inaugural women\u2019s World Cup we may not have even reached this moment. \u201cWomen\u2019s rugby league had never had an international competition of any note before 2000,\u201d says Sheldon, who coached Great Britain in the tournament. She had been part of the coaching staff when the Great Britain Lionesses toured Australia for the first time in 1996. She then led them on a tour to New Zealand two years later. \u201cThere was really only three nations playing at that time, so when I was asked to help set up a women\u2019s World Cup, it was only ever going to be three teams.\u201d Australia and New Zealand accepted the invitations from Sheldon but the hard work was only just beginning. Devoid of any significant funding, Sheldon \u2013 who also assumed the role of tournament organiser \u2013 began to beg, steal and borrow. \u201cIn the towns where we wanted to host games, I had to go to the local authorities and plead with them to sponsor the matches and in return, I\u2019d give the local girls in the town some coaching sessions,\u201d she says, before laughing. \u201cI suppose it was a bit like horse trading. That was just to get the money to put the tournament on.\u201d Contrast that with the millions of pounds of investment that has gone into this year\u2019s tournament and near-professional camps the eight teams will experience. In 2000, there were games scheduled in Castleford and Dewsbury, and expectations that crowds would not get beyond a few hundred, given the lack of any serious women\u2019s domestic league in England, came to fruition. For this sixth World Cup, games are being held at major rugby league grounds with the final at Old Trafford as part of a double-header with the men.  Sheldon had something else to juggle: getting her squad not only match-ready to face Australia and New Zealand, but available to play. \u201cWe ran a camp, but it cost money,\u201d she says. \u201cWe did everything \u2013 bucket collections, sponsorship for the kits, but we also asked any girl who was called up to bring \u00a31,000 to help pay for it all. They all took unpaid leave from their jobs, so the sacrifices were immense.\u201d Even with all that fundraising, Sheldon needed more money, so she hatched an incredible plan. \u201cI had a call from Cilla Black\u2019s people,\u201d she says, smiling. \u201cShe was hosting a gameshow around that time called The Moment of Truth and they asked if we\u2019d be interested in doing a team challenge to win \u00a35,000. \u201cThey wanted to know what we\u2019d use the money for and I thought that would be perfect for the team suits. So we set the girls to work: not training for the tournament, but training to be on Cilla Black\u2019s gameshow.  \u201cFive of them had to juggle a diabolo from one end of a stick to another, pass it on to the next one and reach the end of the line. They didn\u2019t manage to do it in rehearsals once. But before they went on stage, live in front of the nation, I told them to forget about the suits and just enjoy the experience. They went out and did it for the first and only time, winning the \u00a35,000. \u201cWithout that money, I don\u2019t know how we\u2019d have coped. It was aired on TV the night before our first game. We all watched it in camp and it brought us together.\u201d Sheldon gave a group of students at Dewsbury College the task to design the tournament\u2019s logo. The winner received \u00a3500. When the tournament kicked off, just 750 watched Great Britain run New Zealand close in Orrell, losing 22-12. \u201cOn the 1998 tour, the average points difference between us was 33 points but in that first game, we got within 10,\u201d Sheldon says. \u201cWe\u2019d really tried to make sure we improved in time for the World Cup and we couldn\u2019t have done it without a whole array of support staff. We drafted so many volunteers in. The coaching staff, the doctors, everyone did it for free. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have big crowds, but we had some great games and the people who did come would agree.\u201d Great Britain made the final at Warrington\u2019s Wilderspool, but they were beaten 26-4 by New Zealand \u2013 1,262 people were there. On Tuesday afternoon, more than 10 times that many will watch England begin their quest for World Cup glory against debutants Brazil. It is a long way from the empty stadiums and the under-the-radar nature of what happened in 2000. \u201cI\u2019m very proud I played my part in making that happen, and lay the platform for what we\u2019ll see this year,\u201d Sheldon says. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t have done it without so many people working for free. I\u2019m honoured. And I hope the girls this year can inspire a new nation of women to pick up a rugby league ball.\u201d"

After sticking too rigidly to pre-match plans in their first two matches, the last two games forced upon them a more freewheeling and successful approach \u2013 and now they may need to rip up their tactics again. \u201cThey got off like a train but good teams respond well, and I think we responded well,\u201d Mark Wood said of his side\u2019s four-wicket win on Saturday. \u201cThe tale of the game was that spin was always going to be hard, and could the pace either get wickets or restrict? That was different to the last game, and if the Adelaide pitch is different we\u2019ll have to adapt there as well. You\u2019ve got to be fluid in your team, in selection, in orders and bowling lineups. You don\u2019t want to be a one-trick pony.\u201d  England will probably need to tweak their team for Thursday\u2019s semi-final, having picked the same XI in every game so far. They will discover the severity of Dawid Malan\u2019s groin injury on Monday, but the discomfort had not subsided and four days out he seems unlikely to play. The question is whether to pick a direct replacement in Phil Salt, an aggressive top-order batter who Wood reported to be \u201cchomping at the bit\u201d, or bring in Chris Jordan, a brilliant fielder whose bowling will add to the team\u2019s death-over flexibility and can contribute with the bat lower down the order. Maybe two places should be up for grabs given the form of Harry Brook, averaging 8.16 at fractionally more than a run a ball across six innings since arriving in Australia. Of course form can change swiftly \u2013 Ben Stokes was averaging 9.80 at precisely a run a ball before he scored 42 to guide the side to victory on Saturday \u2013 but then England\u2019s Test captain is a special case. \u201cI know people have questioned him but when you need him he stands up,\u201d Wood said of Stokes. \u201cThat\u2019s another moment in his career that you can say when the team needed him, he was the man to be counted on.\u201d If England, beaten semi-finalists last year, are to improve on that this time there will surely be more of those moments to come."

                    "body": "If a picture truly does paint a thousand words, then the sight of Shaun Wane fighting back tears as he tried to analyse where it had gone wrong for England at the World Cup was the latest chapter in a book no English rugby league supporter will be keen to read any time soon. The circumstances were heartbreakingly familiar, with Stephen Crichton\u2019s extra-time drop goal for Samoa denying the hosts a place in the final. But this one is tougher to take than England\u2019s other near-misses of the past, not least because the four weeks that preceded Saturday\u2019s semi-final defeat had offered so much promise and optimism.  Four commanding victories, including an opener against the Samoa side who ultimately knocked them out, quickly became an afterthought on Saturday. To miss out on a World Cup final is nothing new for England but performing so well and being placed on the opposite side of the draw to Australia and New Zealand make this a rather more painful post-tournament inquest. Wane\u2019s emotional reaction underlines how much of a missed opportunity this was. His side reserved their worst performance for the game that mattered most. So what now? Naturally the focus will move towards the next World Cup in France in three years. But as is the norm for international rugby league, what happens between now and then is clouded in uncertainty. England have a grand total of zero games pencilled in for 2023, though the expectation is there will be one against France in April. The Rugby Football League is also hopeful of convincing a southern hemisphere nation, potentially New Zealand, to tour England next autumn. But those games will be the start of a new cycle towards the next World Cup and there are decisions to be made about both the squad and the head coach. Eight of the 17 who lost to Samoa are 30 or above and while the 30-year-old Tom Burgess, among others, will still be involved in 2025, the future is far less certain for some. \u201cI\u2019m 34 now so I think that question and that decision will probably be taken out of my hands,\u201d admits the Wigan prop Mike Cooper. \u201cI think we deserved a lot more as everyone has worked so hard, but that\u2019s team sport for you. We weren\u2019t a million miles away.\u201d The captain, Sam Tomkins, will be 36 when France 2025 begins, likewise Elliott Whitehead; Chris Hill will turn 38 during the tournament. Saturday may well have been their final World Cup appearance.  There is a decision to be made by the RFL on the head coach, too. Wane revealed after the victory against Papua New Guinea in the quarter-finals that he was contracted for 2023, but you would hope that, for the sake of continuity and efficient preparation for the next World Cup, a decision is made soon on whether to extend his contract to 2025 or instead prepare the succession process for a new head coach to lead England into that tournament. Wane, you suspect, would want to carry on, and he remains a popular figure among the group. This is not a case of wholesale revolution for the Test side. While Tomkins, Whitehead and others may have moved on by the next World Cup, Wane or whoever succeeds him has a hugely talented group of young players at his disposal. Take the NRL duo Victor Radley and Herbie Farnworth, who will be firm fixtures for the national side for potentially the next decade.  \u201cTest matches are where I want to be,\u201d Farnworth said on Saturday. \u201cI want to play as much as I can for England in these next few years. It\u2019s an absolute honour to play for this great country, as I\u2019ve said before. It always means so much but the other side of the coin is it hurts so much when you don\u2019t get there.\u201d Radley, who starred for England after opting to represent the country of his father\u2019s birth as opposed to Australia, will also be central to any rebuild.  Jack Welsby, George Williams and Dom Young also have a long future ahead of them still. But when the dust settles on this tournament, they and the rest of the sport will be waiting to see what, if any, plans are locked in by the international authorities between now and 2025. This group of players needs to play games: not just to shrug off the disappointment of this event, but to continue their development. All is not lost with English World Cup hopes this year. Craig Richards\u2019 women\u2019s side will aim to reach next Saturday\u2019s final courtesy of victory against New Zealand in York on Monday evening. For the men, though, this defeat will take some time to get over. When the pain does fade, English rugby league has the foundations to go again. The powers that be need to ensure that this group of young stars, and the veterans who decide to carry on, have the opportunity to play as regularly as possible between now and the next World Cup. Otherwise, the sport risks being in the same position all over again."

It was reportedly for sale for \u00a3185m in 2020.\n\nAnother royal, Turki bin Salman Al Saud, is the ninth son of the king and brother to the country\u2019s de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman. Turki Al Saud owns a BVI-based company called Moncrieff Holdings, which owns 18 properties in London, including flats in the Pinto Tower in Nine Elms.\nQatari royals have also used offshore jurisdictions to spend vast sums on UK property. Sheikh Thani bin Abdullah al-Thani, a member of the dynasty that has ruled over Qatar since the 19th century, owns 12 companies on the register of overseas entities, all of them based in the British Virgin Islands.\nThose companies own 16 properties, including 160 Great Portland Street in London, a seven-floor office block purchased for \u00a3127m in 2018, according to Land Registry records.\nThe sheikh\u2019s property empire also includes a \u00a348m office building on London\u2019s Southwark Street, three addresses worth a combined \u00a331m in Soho and the headquarters of the technology company Sony on Great Marlborough Street.\n\nAnother member of the clan, Mohamed Khalifa al-Thani, bought 1 Queen Anne\u2019s Gate, a 27-apartment block on the edge of St James\u2019s Park near Buckingham Palace, for \u00a3139m in 2019. The development was designed by David Linley, the son of the late Princess Margaret.\nPrevious Guardian analysis has shown that the Qataris own approximately \u00a310bn of UK property, including prestige assets such as the Shard and Harrods. But the register of overseas entities reveals for the first time how the al-Thanis and other Gulf royals have used offshore jurisdictions to expand their UK property holdings.\n\nIn total, members of the ruling families of Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Jordan and Bahrain own nearly 200 properties worth at least \u00a31bn via offshore companies in the BVIs, Jersey, Guernsey and Panama.\n\nThe Guardian is shining a light on owners named on the register in view of the public interest in improving transparency around the ownership of British property. Holding properties through offshore companies is legal and some individuals may have genuine and legitimate privacy or security concerns or business reasons for using them.\nThe register of overseas entities opened last year and individuals have until 31 January to declare they are the beneficial owners of offshore companies that own UK property."

Laporte has signalled his intention to appeal against his two\u2011year suspended prison sentence and remains president of the French Rugby Federation. The scandal \u2013 in which Mohed Altrad, the Montpellier owner, also received a suspended 18\u2011month sentence and fine \u2013 has already prompted Laporte to step aside from his World Rugby role just nine months before the 2023 World Cup which France is hosting.  Many in France, however, now regard Laporte\u2019s position within the FFR as untenable after he was found guilty of an illegal conflict of interests, influence peddling and four instances of passive corruption. Under French law the appeal process could conceivably extend into 2024 or beyond, raising the possibility of Laporte continuing as an influential power-broker. New Zealand Rugby is already said to be seeking urgent answers from the French construction company Altrad, which signed a six-year shirt sponsorship deal with the All Blacks and Black Ferns in August. World Rugby has asked Neil Hallett, its newly appointed independent ethics officer, to look into the circumstances surrounding the French court\u2019s decision. Hallett, a former detective inspector in the New Zealand police, is expected to publish his findings and recommendations by the end of January. The World Rugby chairman, Sir Bill Beaumont, will take on Laporte\u2019s committee duties in the interim. Any prospect of Laporte performing any kind of prominent public-facing role at the Rugby World Cup next year is already understood to be remote. His role in helping France to secure the 2023 hosting rights ahead of the official preferred bidder South Africa, however, did not form any part of the corruption probe that reached its climax on Tuesday. Wayne Barnes, meanwhile, says he has considered walking away from refereeing after online abuse was directed at his wife and children following South Africa\u2019s 30-26 defeat against France in Marseille last month. The outcome prompted South Africa\u2019s director of rugby, Rassie Erasmus, to post video clips on Twitter which appeared to question some of Barnes\u2019s decisions. Erasmus was suspended for two Tests but Barnes, who was overseeing his 101st Test, subsequently reported two perpetrators to the police. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve done 100 games, you think you can prepare for most things,\u201d Barnes said in an interview with The Good, The Bad and The Rugby podcast. \u201cYou can\u2019t prepare for that. It affects you and it affects your family. Of course I have questioned my refereeing future, that\u2019s a constant conversation you have with your family.\u201d"

                    "body": "  8.09pm    Let\u2019s wrap things up with Rob Kitson\u2019s report from Twickenham. Thanks for joining us throughout the autumn. See you soon.      7.53pm    Owen Farrell is on Amazon, with a face like a bad ham \u201cIt\u2019s not worked out for us today, but we\u2019ve put some good work in over the past five weeks and we have to hold on to that. Lack of a bit of accuracy and bite at times, and we have to look to be better when the game is slowed down; there are plenty of things didn\u2019t go well today. We\u2019re hurting at the minute, but we\u2019ll come back strong.\u201d     7.49pm    Manu Tuilagi is offering his thoughts \u201cIt was a tough game, we wanted to come out and attack the game which we did at the start, but South Africa put so much pressure on us and credit to them. The plan was clear for us, but SA are such a quality side and we weren\u2019t good enough today. We\u2019re building nicely [for the world cup], I know it\u2019s hard to see, but we are.\u201d     7.47pm    Siya Kolisi looks happy. \u201cBig relief for us to play this way. We\u2019ve been working really hard for results to go our way, this was for the people back home who always support us. England were tough at the beginning, but we stuck to our guns and took our opportunities. We are grateful for Arendse, but that is what our team is about, we have different strengths and skills and plus all have determination and hard work. We feel there\u2019s still a lot more we can do, we have learnt so much as we go towards the world cup.\u201d     7.35pm    It\u2019s hard to describe how utterly dominated England were here. Powdered up-front, stupid penalties given away, lineouts stolen, attacking pattern (such as it was) swarmed all over, and that is not an exhaustive list.     7.32pm   FULL TIME! England 13 - 27 South Africa  PEEEEP! England are put out of their misery.     7.31pm    81 mins. England\u2019s last attempt at an attack is clamped way behind the gainline by the still energetic Bok defence. Jonny Hill is then pinged for lifting legs in the ruck and Manie Libbok decides to go to the corner to turn the screw.  Then boots it touch in-goal.      7.29pm    79 mins. Bok scrum is won on a penalty advantage, and they move it right to Willemse who runs miles but can\u2019t get an offload away.  The South Africa subs are all embracing as the warm feeling of total victory settles in.     7.27pm    78 mins. A clean lineout win for England on the 10m line is spun to Slade at first receiver, but in a moment that sums up England\u2019s day he simply drops it. England have been out-thought, out-dogged and frankly outclassed for the whole evening.      7.24pm    76 mins. Hendrikse runs blind from the scrum and feeds Willemse who tries to grubber past Steward. He doesn\u2019t manage it, but the England fullback knocks on while blocking. Will Stuart is injured, so Sinckler is back on the field.     7.20pm    74 mins. Manu Tuilagi, who has done nothing today, tries to shovel a ball on in his own 22 to Steward, but it\u2019s forward. An attacking Bok scrum in the England 22 awaits.     7.18pm    72 mins. Break in play for a water break while Faf De Klerk receives some treatment and leaves the field to be replaced by Jaden Hendrikse. While this is going on Siya Kolisi is off for a HIA, replaced by Evan Roos   Updated at 7.27pm GMT    7.14pm   TRY! England 13 - 27 South Africa (Henry Slade)  71 mins. Faf De Klerk makes a mess of gathering a lineout tap down and England snaffle the fumble and go right to Nowell who is up into the SA half. A few phases later Ben Youngs taps a quick penalty, races up to the posts and the ball is fed to Slade to score. They can\u2019t do it again, can they?   Updated at 7.18pm GMT    7.11pm    69 mins. They might be a man up, but England are still giving away penalties to the Bok scrum, the latest being Will Stuart dropping his bind as the huge pressure shove comes on.  Updated at 7.11pm GMT    7.08pm    67 mins. England can\u2019t capitalise as their latest 5m lineout is stolen by the Boks and when the home side have a promising counter-attack from the clearing kick, Malcolm Marx clamps on to win a trademark breakdown penalty. Nothing is working for England at all, really.     7.06pm    65 mins. Yes, SA are disadvantaged as they are pinged for holding on when attempting to run out from the base of the scrum in a position they probably wouldn\u2019t have been in but for the spidercam. The ball goes left on the England attack but a brilliant defensive read by De Klerk prevents Steward from capitalising on an overlap.     7.04pm    62 mins. Willemse goes for a clearing kick from his own in-goal after Moster nicks an attacking England lineout.  In a strange twist, the ball hits the overhead spider cam on the way into touch. The law states that on such rare occasions there\u2019s a scrum from where the kick was taken, but as this was in-goal SA will have to play out from a 5m scrum.  So, because the ball hit a floating camera, the boks are significanty disadvantaged it would seem. Odd     7.01pm    Willie Le Roux is off for Canan Moodie Henry Slade has replaced Marcus Smith     7.00pm   RED CARD! Thomas du Toit (South Africa)  The inevitable sending off happens.   Updated at 7.07pm GMT    6.59pm    60 mins. A huge counter-ruck by Nowell wins the ball for England on the Bok 10m line, but as they attempt to use it Farrell is powdered by two tacklers and the attack breaks down. The TMO wants the ref to look at Thomas du Toit\u2019s actions in a previous tackle. He runs in, shoulder first onto Cowan-Dickie\u2019s head. This will be the end of his match.     6.56pm   PENALTY! England 6 - 27 South Africa (Faf De Klerk)  57 mins. SA penalty in front of the posts but nearly 50 metres out. De Klerk decides to kick it and any snarky thoughts are dismissed as he absolutely tonks it straight through the middle. A brilliant kick. This makes no sense.     6.53pm    55 mins. The South African pack give it the full press on the England put in and the pressure forces the home pack back and allows De Klerk to snipe all over Billy Vunipola at the base.  Billy loses both the ball and his place on the field as he\u2019s immediately replaced by Sam Simmonds.     6.50pm    52 mins. Willemse can\u2019t hold a simple pass in midfield.  Marco Van Staden has replace Evan Roos for SA     6.48pm   TRY! England 6 - 24 South Africa (Eben Etzebeth)  49 mins. From the latest drive at the line, Etzebeth gets his hands on it to force over from a few feet out. Simply worked with power by the Boks, but that was all fruit of the same stupid tree planted by Hill and Curry two minutes ago. That could have sealed the game for SA.   Updated at 6.58pm GMT    6.45pm   YELLOW CARD! Tom Curry (England)  48 mins. Jonny Hill does a big time stupid by pushing De Klerk over which reverses a penalty England had just been given. From that SA have a lineout drive that Tom Curry is offside at after the ref reminded them they were still on a warning.   Updated at 6.49pm GMT    6.43pm    South Africa have freshened up their front row, Malcolm Marx, Steven Kitshoff and Thomas du Toit on for Frans Malherbe, Mbongeni Mbonambi and Ox Nche. Dave Ribbans has replaced Alex Coles for England     6.42pm   PENALTY! England 6 - 17 South Africa (Owen Farrell)  44 mins. England have the ball and they are in the South Africa half after a great aerial take from Steward. Faf De Klerk is offside and nothing happens with the advantage after Smith tries to work it towards the right touchline.  Farrell slots this one no problem     6.39pm    \u201cHi Lee\u201d, says Andy Flintoff (not that one) \u201cHaving caught the second two-thirds of the excellent Wales-Australia match earlier, I can tell you that this game is almost the direct opposite of that. England aren\u2019t doing very well, but SA aren\u2019t having to play that much better to be ahead - their one moment of incisive attacking led to a try.\u201d Yep, it\u2019s pretty low-proficiency mini-thumping so far.     6.38pm   DROP GOAL! England 3 - 17 South Africa (Damian Willemse)  41 mins. The first sniff of territory with ball in hand for the Boks has Willemse again calling for the ball and hammering another drop goal over. As the ball sails through, both sets of forwards and having a do with each other. There\u2019s nothing in it and the ref tells them to calm down.   Updated at 6.41pm GMT    6.35pm    Eddie Jones had rung the changes at half time. Luke Cowan-Dickie, Ellis Genge and Will Stuart have replaced Kyle Sinckler, Jamie George and Mako Vunipola. Jack Nowell is on for Freeman     6.34pm   Second Half!  40 mins. We return to action as Engkand gather a deep restart kick.      6.23pm    A horrible half of rugby, lit up by a moment of vision and magic by Willemse, Le Roux and Arendse for the try, that towards the end began to tell the story of what could well become the rest of the match: England being bullied a bit. England are slowly losing the tight set pieces and being penalised in defence when scrambling close to the line. Expect more of that unless Eddie Jones can change something fundamental.     6.18pm   HALF TIME! England 3 - 14 South Africa  40 mins. PEEEP! That\u2019ll do for this half.     6.17pm   PENALTY! England 3 - 14 South Africa (Faf De Klerk)  39 mins. Slowly, inevitably, the Bok front 5 are getting the upper hand in the scrum and another penalty is sent to the corner by Le Roux. It\u2019s an unsurprising catch and drive and England are again infringing all over the shop, leading to Ref Gardiner issuing a warning to Farrell. De Klerk, undeterred by previous failures, calls for the tee and does a good job.  Updated at 6.31pm GMT    6.13pm    36 mins. South Africa spring from deep again, Willemse feeding Arendse once more who this time pops up in midfield. He runs over halfway and tries to slide a grubber past Steward who does a brilliant goalkeeper save on it.     6.11pm   TRY! England 3 - 11 South Africa (Kurt-Lee Arendse)  33 mins. Deep kick to nothing from England is fielded by Willemse who moves up the right and finds Le Roux with an inside pop. The fullback draws a defender and finds Arendse out wide who does a full-pace in-to-out step to leave Smith with no chance of a cover tackle. That\u2019s livened things up a bit. De Klerk\u2019s conversion attempt is utter dreck.   Updated at 6.31pm GMT    6.08pm   DROP GOAL! England 3 - 6 South Africa (Damian Willemse)  31 mins. South Africa are on the attack on the England 22 and Willemse, no doubt analysing the game and assuming anything either side attempts with the ball will end in some maladroit mess, decides it\u2019s a \u201cdrop goal after half an hour\u201d type of match and boffs one over.  Updated at 6.32pm GMT    6.04pm    29 mins. Mapimpi hacks a loose ball on into the England 22, but Smith is there to cover. A few phases of short carries later, Van Poortvliet clears with the boot.     6.03pm    27 mins. This game is a challenging watch so far. Very little continuity and kicking like people have toblerone feet.     6.01pm    26 mins. Latest lineout for the Boks is as short as the last one was long. Etzebeth pops it back to Mbonambi who finds Kolisi to drive to the line, but it\u2019s held up above the desperate England defence.     5.59pm    24 mins. More inelegant scrum woes gives a penalty to SA, and from the lineout then go very long and set up the maul before attempting to move the ball on the short side before it\u2019s spilled.  There were multiple infringements by England to the Bok maul.     5.56pm   MISSED PENALTY! England 3 - 3 South Africa (Owen Farrell)  2o mins. England\u2019s fast ruck speed continues, assisted by SA not really putting anyone in, something Nienaber will surely do something about soon. In the meantime the pace of the attack is good and it\u2019s forcing the Bok blitz offside in defence.  The latest penalty is just on the right post, 3o metres out, and Farrell pulls it left with and audible \u201cF**K OFF!\u201d as he watch the flight of the ball.     5.52pm   PENALTY! England 3 - 3 South Africa (Faf De Klerk)  17 mins. Alex Coles is penalised for gripping Evan Roos in a headlock in the tackle. De Klerk, undeterred by his last kick, calls for the tee once more and slots this one from closer in.     5.49pm    15 mins. Much more zip to England\u2019s back play this week, Van Poortvliet working at about twice he speed he did vs NZ. The latest attack comes left and there\u2019s a sniff of space out wide, but the tip-on pass from Farrell goes a mile forward.  No blame to the captain there, he was under pressure and it was worth going for.     5.46pm   PENALTY! England 3 - 0 South Africa (Owen Farrell)  12 mins. England have a scum just in the SA half, which takes the best part of an eon to complete, hence not too many updates for a bit. It ends in a England pen, against Malherbe for overextending; even thought it looked like Mako Vunipola was folded. Either way Farrell calls on the tee and gets this one a lot straighter.     5.42pm     It\u2019s looking a little better in phased play so far, Guy.     5.40pm   MISSED PENALTY! England 0 - 0 South Africa (Owen Farrell)  8 mins. A few phases from England look enterprising in the Bok half, and Nche drifts offside trying to repel one of them.  Farrell calls the tee on and misses an absolute sitter from just right of the post. Beautiful contact, though. Not that that matters.     5.38pm   MISSED PENALTY! England 0 - 0 South Africa (Faf De Klerk)  5 mins. Oof! De Klerk goes through a lovely prep routine then shanks it miles left. The latest in the \u201cwill he do\u201d strategy to place kicking from the Boks looks not to be a decent call. At All.     5.36pm    3 mins. Both sides have some energetic phases before Steward can\u2019t field a kick cleanly and the Boks have a scrum around the England 10m line. It ends with a penalty to South Africa which Faf De Klerk is going to kick for posts   Updated at 5.37pm GMT    5.31pm   Kick Off!  1 min. Farrell chips the ball deep and Marvin Orie gathers with 0% fuss.      5.30pm    Incredibly sad news as we wait for the kick off, as Scotland RU announce the death of Doddie Weir; a literally towering presence in the sport in Scotland and throughout the world.  Humility, humour, humanity, Doddie had it all and we are all worse off for him not being here, but better for having him.  Updated at 5.33pm GMT    4.54pm    Pre-match reading. Eddie Jones wants England to forget getting hammered in 2019 \u2013 which you would think beating the Boks in 2021 may have helped them with already, but what to I know? Read more here\u2026      4.54pm    Do you have any answers to the stuttering nature of both of these sides in recent weeks? You can email me or tweet @bloodandmud and I\u2019ll pass the best ones on to the coaches.     4.30pm   Teams  Despite a difficult outing last week for Jack Van Poortvliet, Eddie Jones keeps faith with the young scrum-half and the hopeful promise of this partnership with Marcus Smith. There are changes elsewhere, though, as Tommy Freeman comes in on the wing, Alex Coles replaces Sam Simmonds in the back row and Mako Vunipola give Ellis Genge a breather at loose-head. The Boks have promising Number 8 Evan Roos in the starting XV, while Makazole Mapimpi replaces the unavailable Cheslin Kolbe. England: 15 Freddie Steward, 14 Tommy Freeman, 13 Manu Tuilagi, 12 Owen Farrell (captain), 11 Jonny May, 10 Marcus Smith, 9 Jack van Poortvliet, 8 Billy Vunipola, 7 Tom Curry, 6 Alex Coles, 5 Jonny Hill, 4 Maro Itoje, 3 Kyle Sinckler, 2 Jamie George, 1 Mako Vunipola.Replacements: 16 Luke Cowan-Dickie, 17 Ellis Genge, 18 Will Stuart, 19 David Ribbans, 20 Sam Simmonds, 21 Ben Youngs, 22 Henry Slade, 23 Jack Nowell. South Africa: 15 Willie le Roux, 14 Kurt-Lee Arendse, 13 Jesse Kriel, 12 Damian de Allende, 11 Makazole Mapimpi, 10 Damian Willemse, 9 Faf de Klerk, 8 Evan Roos, 7 Franco Mostert, 6 Siya Kolisi (captain), 5 Marvin Orie, 4 Eben Etzebeth, 3 Frans Malherbe, 2 Mbongeni Mbonambi, 1 Ox Nche.Replacements: 16 Malcolm Marx, 17 Steven Kitshoff, 18 Thomas du Toit, 19 Marco van Staden, 20 Albertus Smith, 21 Jaden Hendrikse, 22 Manie Libbok, 23 Canan Moodie.     4.30pm   Preamble  Welcome to the Twickenham for the twilight of not only the day, but this season\u2019s Autumn International series, as we prepare for the final match between England and South Africa. The previous seven minutes of international rugby played by England saw them score 19 points, which is good. However, the 73 prior to that saw them score 6 and not look like being able to find a clue about how clock up any more until the side went double or quits on attack with the game vs NZ already gone to force an unlikely draw. The question still hangs for Eddie Jones about what his team are about, what the approach is and how they can consistently perform to a pattern that wins matches like last week, and today vs the Boks. South Africa arrive after predictably thumping Italy last week, but this was on the back of losing their bigger matches vs Ireland and France. In many ways, Jacques Nienaber\u2019s world champions have similar queries about their ability to create to win as England. Although Director Of Rugby, Rassie Erasmus, seems to put their problems down to a New World Rugby Order with the sole intent of destroying his team, or something. An approach that has him banned for this match, which in his mind probably proves his point. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll prepare a video informing us, either way. The last decade of meetings has seen an even mix of wins for both sides and, 2019 World Cup final thumping aside, they are close results. Hard to see anything different this evening.  "

                    "body": "Bryce Campbell is not keen to linger on the defeat by Chile which sent the US Eagles to the Rugby World Cup Final Qualification Tournament which starts in Dubai on Sunday. Naturally, the Indianapolis-born centre would rather focus on Kenya, Hong Kong and Portugal, who the US must beat if they are not to miss a World Cup for the first time since 1995.  No American really wants to think too much about the loss to Chile in July, other than as a very harsh lesson indeed. \u201cThe wheels fell off,\u201d Campbell says from the Emirates, fresh from a meeting with the Eagles coaches. \u201cWe weren\u2019t able to win momentum back after we had a yellow card 10 minutes before half-time.\u201d The Eagles won the first leg against Los C\u00f3ndores, by one point on a Santiago quagmire. In the second leg, under a scorching Colorado sun, they scored three tries early and seemed set fair for France. Then came that yellow card, to the lock Nick Civetta at a ruck, and a parade of errors ruthlessly exploited by Chile. \u201cWe were just scatterbrained,\u201d Campbell says. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that had to do with our preparation or it was just one of those days. But now the past is the past and we\u2019ve got to go out and win three games here in Dubai. That\u2019s what matters.\u201d True. Civetta, once of Newcastle, is one heavyweight now missing thanks to injury. Joe Taufete\u2019e, the Leicester hooker, is another. But Campbell played two years for London Irish and there is further European experience in the squad. Among others, the fly-half AJ MacGinty plays for Bristol, the hooker Kapeli Pifeleti and scrum-half Ruben de Haas for Saracens and the giant centre Paul Lasike was once of Harlequins and before that the Chicago Bears. But the squad still holds eight uncapped players. \u201cThey\u2019re doing great,\u201d Campbell says. \u201cThat\u2019s why we had games\u201d \u2013 educational defeats \u2013 \u201cagainst the Pumas and Cheetahs in South Africa, and a scrimmage with Western Province. We spent some time together at camp and then we were able to get proper games in and those opportunities showed these guys are ready. When they put the jersey on, people will see they\u2019re the real deal.\u201d From Jack Iscaro of the DC front row to Mitch Wilson of the New England back three, the head coach, Gary Gold, has picked a team to face Kenya first up that is fully representative of Major League Rugby. And yet in the American game there is always another sock-full of billiard balls to dodge \u2013 or to take flush in the face. MLR is heading for its sixth season but last month, after a long stand-off with the Australian owner of Los Angeles and Austin, the league announced that the two teams will not compete next year.  The league has announced a dispersal draft and a new team in Chicago. But the players association has protested the process and Campbell, who played for Austin, is not the only Eagle wondering where he\u2019ll next call home. \u201cGuys are definitely talking about it,\u201d he says, before insisting the MLR situation is \u201cirrelevant at the moment. We\u2019ve got a job to do in Dubai. We\u2019ll take care of that and the rest of the guys will be looked after. So is it easy? No. But at least we\u2019ve got something to focus on.\u201d \u2018It\u2019s up to us to perform\u2019 World Rugby is focused on the US, which will host the 2031 men\u2019s World Cup and the women in 2033. After the Chile game the governing body\u2019s chief executive paid proper tribute to the victors, then considered the Eagles. \u201cI don\u2019t think the game needs the US in France next year,\u201d Alan Gilpin said. \u201c[But] I think the US plan will benefit significantly from the US being in France.\u201d As much as anywhere in the oval world, American rugby is a very political place. But after the Eagles women made the last eight last month in New Zealand, there is a belief the men must now qualify for France. By rankings alone they should do it. The Americans are 19th, Kenya 33rd, Hong Kong 22nd, Portugal 20th.  Furthermore, Gold has acquired some heavyweight assistants. Mario Ledesma, a great Argentina hooker who oversaw the Pumas\u2019 first win over the All Blacks, is with the Eagles in Dubai. So are John Plumtree, a former All Blacks coach, and Steve Brett, once a Crusaders fly-half in New Zealand, now coach of the MLR team in Atlanta. \u201cWe\u2019ve definitely got all the pieces,\u201d Campbell says. \u201cWe\u2019re really lucky to have a group of coaches that are so experienced and now it\u2019s up to us to perform.\u201d Portugal also have an experienced coach, Patrice Lagisquet, once of Biarritz and France, in his international playing days known as the Bayonne Express. They also have the Rugby Europe Super Cup, where Lusitanos XV, who compete against teams from Georgia, Spain, Israel, the Netherlands, Belgium and Romania, are essentially the national side in disguise. This year, Os Lobos \u2013 the Wolves \u2013 have asked questions of Argentina, Italy and Georgia.  Not to dismiss Kenya and Hong Kong, but USA v Portugal on 18 November does seem likely to decide that precious place in France, in Pool C with the Georgians, Wales, Fiji and Australia. Campbell still won\u2019t be drawn. \u201cWe\u2019ve been focusing on ourselves for the past six weeks: 80-90% of the game will come down to that. We\u2019ve shifted our focus to Kenya but we\u2019ll take it one week at a time. We\u2019ll tweak a couple of things here and there, based on the opposition.\u201d Fair enough. Campbell does agree that for American rugby, the next three weeks are incomparably important. \u201cIt\u2019s about the whole trajectory of our game. This sport in the States. There is a lot riding on this. We\u2019re accepting that responsibility, to take care of business.\u201d  USA v Kenya will show in the US at 7am ET on Sunday, on therugbynetwork.com "

                    "body": "France have perfected the art of pragmatism. They absorb pressure, defend in numbers, lure their prey in, then strike in the blink of an eye. Sometimes, as England found out, they only need a couple of dominant spells. Such is life when you have Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 waiting to streak away on the counterattack, Antoine Griezmann finding little pockets of space and Olivier Giroud \u2013 still underrated, still going strong \u2013 waiting for an opportunity to fall his way in the penalty area.\nIt has been a winning formula for Didier Deschamps, whose team are two victories away from becoming the first country since Brazil in 1962 to retain the World Cup. France\u2019s head coach does not worry about having more possession than the other team. Deschamps does not talk about having a philosophy. He thinks about the best way to win.\nOn Wednesday night, though, France face a conundrum: how to breach opponents who will give them the ball and trust in the tournament\u2019s best defence to hold firm. Morocco, the first African side to reach the semi-finals, stand in their way and are likely to take some budging. The underdogs will be roared on by thousands of supporters at Al Bayt Stadium, where a hostile atmosphere is bound to test the courage of the France players, and they are surely not going to open up now. Entertaining neutrals is not Morocco\u2019s priority. They have played eight and a half hours of football, faced three penalties in their shootout win over Spain and still the only goal they have conceded came when Nayef Aguerd put the ball into his own net against Canada.\n\nPatience, as the France goalkeeper Hugo Lloris acknowledged, is going to be key. Part of the problem for the world champions is that Morocco, supremely drilled by Walid Regragui, are effective. They will look to their brilliant right-back Achraf Hakimi to set aside his friendship with his Paris Saint-Germain clubmate Mbapp\u00e9. There will be responsibility on the tireless Sofyan Amrabat to pin down Griezmann, who was so impressive against England, and Bono to perform more wonders in goal. They will be praying that Aguerd, Romain Sa\u00efss and Noussair Mazraoui are fit to play in defence, and that they are not too weary after beating Portugal 1-0 in the quarter-finals.\nBut Morocco, who topped a group containing Belgium and Croatia, will also look to lure France into a trap before springing forward on the break. As Lloris pointed out, they have a strong midfield and creative threats from Hakim Ziyech and Sofiane Boufal. Youssef En-Nesyri, who scored the winner against Portugal, is a dangerous runner up front. \u201cThey\u2019re not just good in defence,\u201d Deschamps warned. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t have reached the semis if they were just a defensive team.\u201d\n\nThe onus will be on France to assert themselves, to control possession and stretch the play, for Theo Hernandez and Jules Kound\u00e9 to push up from the full-back positions. Griezmann, playing as a No 10 these days, will have to succeed where Kevin De Bruyne, Bruno Fernandes and Bernardo Silva failed. Mbapp\u00e9 will have to win his duel with Hakimi.\nYet an upset is not out of the question. Memories of France\u2019s colonial past in Morocco will lend the occasion an extra edge in the stands. Regragui, who grew up in a suburb just outside Paris, is ready. \u201cWe want Africa to be on top of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not the favourites. You may say I am crazy, but a bit of craziness is good.\n\u201cWe are not here to kid around and we are not tired. We want to rewrite the history books for our brothers in north Africa, for Egyptians, Libyans \u2013 all those who dreamed of seeing an African team in a semi-final. I don\u2019t want to wait another 40 years to give another African team a chance. I am a bit crazy; a bit of a dreamer.\u201d\n\nRegragui was in a lively mood. He was not ready to hear any accusations that his team\u2019s style is boring. \u201cThis idea of possession, it is amazing you journalists love these figures of 50-60%,\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter if you have one shot. Expected goals don\u2019t mean anything.\n\u201cIf they allow us possession we will keep the ball but I don\u2019t think they will allow us to do that. We are here to win. If you give points to teams with most possession, it would change the game. Guardiola was my hero for a long time, I wanted to play possession football. When you have De Bruyne, Bernardo Silva, that is possible.\n\u201cA lot of European journalists have criticised our style. They don\u2019t like to see an African team play cleverly. They think African teams used to be fun but get knocked out. Those days are over now. There isn\u2019t one way of winning. We had 0.01% chance of winning the World Cup at the outset. Now we have 0.03. But we are going to try and destroy statistics.\u201d\nTry arguing with that. For Morocco, it is about being effective. The dilemma, though, is that France also have little time for romance. When Deschamps was asked about number-crunching in football, he wasn\u2019t particularly enthused. Sometimes, he said, you have to ignore the stats and trust your eyes. Essentially Deschamps was saying that he does not give two hoots if people criticise his side\u2019s refusal to play fantasy football. France will simply believe they can find a way to win."

                    "body": "Hannibal Mejbri has been doing it on cold, wet and windy nights in Stoke this season, so shining in the warm afternoons and evenings of Qatar should come easily. The Tunisian teenager is one of the rising stars of English football and will relish any physical challenge Australia may bring when the two meet in Al-Wakrah in their second game of the 2022 World Cup. \nWith Denmark and France also in Group D, both Tunisia and the Socceroos know that beating each other offers the best chance of progression. It should be quite a battle and with a Tunisian called Hannibal on the pitch, there is always going to be a chance for something special.\n\nIt has already been quite a journey for the Paris-born midfielder. After making a reputation for himself and appearing for France Under-16s, Mejbri went to Monaco and then, in the summer of 2019, had the pick of plenty of big European clubs before opting to join Manchester United. The all-action 19-year-old first made a name for himself in the Premier League, coming on for United late in a 4-0 loss to Liverpool in April. \nOn what was a dismal night for the Red Devils, Mejbri made an impact off the bench, earning praise from an otherwise despondent Gary Neville. \u201cTo be fair at least the kid\u2019s showing something,\u201d said Neville. \u201cHonestly, it takes a young kid to come on and show the rest of them how to sprint to the ball and put a challenge in. I\u2019m actually proud of him. Maybe he doesn\u2019t like the idea of Liverpool passing around him, I wish the others were the same.\u201d\n\nBut there is more to Mejbri than running around and kicking opposition players, and he is developing into a fine all-round central midfielder. He made the first of 18 appearances for Tunisia in 2021 and in the summer moved on loan from United to Birmingham City, doing so with the blessing of national team coach Jalel Kadri. \n\u201cHe is not going to get much playing time at Manchester United this season and a move is a good idea. He needs to play,\u201d said the Tunisia boss, who is now, according to reports in the local media, delighted with how it is all turning out. \nHe is not the only coach to be happy. Birmingham have been in a funk in recent years, finishing just clear of the drop zone in the past six seasons and this time around they started poorly once more with just five points from the first six games by the time Mejbri arrived. Helped by their new loanee, who has made 15 appearances this season so far, City have climbed the table and are sitting in the fairly unfamiliar territory of mid-table.\n\nBlues boss John Eustace is a fan of his new star, and said in October: \u201cThe way he has played in the last couple of games has been phenomenal. He has broken records for total distance, all that kind of stuff.\u201d\nAt the end of the month, other coaches were talking about him too. Headlines were made in October with an impressive win over the in-form Queen\u2019s Park Rangers when Mejbri caught the eye and raised the ire of QPR boss Michael Beale who felt he should have been sent off for a second bookable offence \u2013 and wasn\u2019t surprised when Eustace immediately brought the Tunisian off. \u201cI like that boy,\u201d Beale said. \u201cHe has got loads of personality and I have seen him play, he is a good player, he gets a little bit excited and I think John had his heart in his mouth and obviously he made the right call to get him off.\u201d\nMejbri will relish any kind of physical battle that the Socceroos will bring on 26 November in Al-Wakrah but coach Graham Arnold will know that while the player has been turning heads, he does sail close to the wind.\n\nEustace has been trying to polish his rough diamond a little. \u201cIt\u2019s something we have got to watch but he plays on the edge, that\u2019s why he\u2019s so good, a top player. I am certainly not going to stop him from doing what he does but he has to realise the importance of managing the games at times. He is a 19-year-old footballer, he is learning his trade and we are going to speak to him about it for sure.\u201d\nIt seemed to do the job in that recent win at Stoke. Amid the driving wind and rain, Mejbri won 100% of his tackles, four out of five ground duels and completed all of his dribbles. Throw in a couple of interceptions and an assist and you have a performance to remember. Conditions in Qatar could not be more different but the competitive spirit is unmistakable and while Mejbri is not a midfield general just yet, he is rapidly rising through the ranks."

City had addressed neither of these matters publicly since the match. \n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t hear the chant,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cIf it\u2019s happened I\u2019m so sorry \u2013 it doesn\u2019t represent what we are as a team and a club. But don\u2019t worry, we can behave perfectly [from] our mistakes. Not a problem.\u201d\nObjects were thrown at the City bus at Anfield, resulting in a damaged windscreen. Liverpool were fined \u20ac20,000 by Uefa in 2018 for a similar incident before a Champions League quarter-final. Also this week there were accusations \u2013 made anonymously \u2013 that J\u00fcrgen Klopp had stoked the fires with pre-match comments that were alleged to be xenophobic. Liverpool\u2019s manager rejected those claims.\nGuardiola, asked whether the relationship between the two clubs had become toxic, responded: \u201cI don\u2019t think so. From our side, I\u2019m pretty sure it hasn\u2019t.\u201d\nLiverpool remain seven points behind City but Guardiola thought before last weekend\u2019s meeting that Klopp\u2019s side would rival them for the title, despite the German saying they were out of the race after a poor start. \u201cIt looks like with my statement I believe more in the Liverpool team than their manager,\u201d Guardiola said.\nAfter City\u2019s midweek trip to the league leaders Arsenal was postponed, they return to action against Brighton on Saturday lunchtime looking to close the gap to one point. It is the first of seven games City play before the World Cup. England\u2019s Kyle Walker is a doubt for the tournament with an injury, and John Stones and Kalvin Phillips are returning to full fitness. Guardiola will not pick anyone he fears is protecting himself before Qatar 2022 starts in a month.\n\u201cHe will not play if I smell this,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cI\u2019m really good at smelling this. Tactics not, but smelling I\u2019m really good. And what is going to happen is that they are not going to play because they will get injured when they are not ready. When you are focused, you don\u2019t get injured. When you are distracted is when you get injured.\u201d"

                    "body": "The changing nature of international rugby league might have centred on the rise of the Pacific nations but, while a French renaissance has not garnered the same levels of newsprint, the game in France is also very much on an upward trajectory.  France will host the 2025 World Cup and this Chanticleers outfit shapes as one of the strongest French sides of the last 50 years.   The man charged with leading that revival is astute Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson, who has taken on the important director of rugby position. Luc Lacoste and the French Rugby League could not have tapped a more qualified person than the three-time NRL premiership winner, who has not only a history with the French game but a deep affection for the country.  \u201cFrance changed the course of my life,\u201d Robinson says. \u201cI went there and played and then had a bold president who gave me a [head coaching] job at 28 at Toulouse. Then Bernard Guasch gave me a Super League job at 33. It changed the course of my life as far as football goes but I also met my partner there and my kids are half French.\u201d There is a great deal of excitement about the French squad for this World Cup; it is a young team that has been building since Robinson came on board. The focus has been about creating a platform that can sustain an identity and a style from the national team down.  \u201cSetting up a professional environment has been really important,\u201d Robinson says. \u201cEven a year ago, Catalans and Toulouse were more professional than the French team. Changing the attitudes has been important, ensuring that when you come into the national team you realise this is the pinnacle of French rugby league.  \u201cIt\u2019s about putting systems in place that are going to last for the duration. That\u2019s the goal of what we are trying to do. We want to play a certain style and a style that can be continued game on game. \u201cThese guys are incredibly professional. They are as good a group as I\u2019ve been involved with in terms of their application to training, their life around training and how they prepare. Now it\u2019s about getting those top-end decisions in big games nailed.\u201d The talent in the French team may not have a lot of name-appeal to southern hemisphere audiences but that may soon change according to Robinson, who says French players are not far away from playing at NRL level.  \u201cThe first progression is being a top decision-maker in your club team in Super League,\u201d Robinson says. \u201cThen we can see them starting to push for NRL spots.\u201d  Young halves pairing Arthur Mourgue and C\u00e9sar Roug\u00e9 are expected to be the centrepieces of Les Chanticleers for years to come.  \u201cMourgue is going well and is developing nicely as a decision-maker while C\u00e9sar Roug\u00e9 has just turned 20,\u201d Robinson says. \u201cThose two halves are really key and it is important we spend time with them.\u201d  Robinson is taking a big picture view of his role and what he hopes to achieve between now and the next World Cup to ensure France are at their strongest when given a platform to shine on home turf. That includes empowering younger players and building a program that has them playing more Tests.  \u201cIt\u2019s more a medium-to-long term role rather than the short-term role of the coach,\u201d Robinson says. \u201cWhen Laurent [Frayssinous] got the job as the head coach, they were looking for a director of rugby to assist him in getting it set up. This included working towards the [World Cup] bid and what will be the World Cup in 2025.\u201d The importance of the tournament returning to France cannot be understated, particularly given the challenges overcome \u2013 from the outlawing of the game and the seizing of the its assets during the second world war to the code not being allowed to use the word rugby until 1991 and the violence that has consistently undermined any efforts to grow. \u201cThis is of huge significance to the game in France,\u201d Robinson says. \u201cIt\u2019s a platform for recognition and understanding of our sport in the wider community. It needs to be used as a platform for improvement in television coverage, in sponsorship, in growing the game.  \u201cWe\u2019ve talked about the [Fifa] World Cup in America and what that did for the teams and the elevation of clubs. It is about the French team, it is about the World Cup but it\u2019s also about developing the game in France and accelerating its growth.\u201d Finding a wider audience is also critical for growth, as the absence of TV coverage has impacted the game at all levels in France.  \u201cThe big thing is that rugby league is recognised but because it doesn\u2019t have a television platform it is known, but not followed,\u201d Robinson says. \u201cSo you end up swimming in the same pool where it gets passed down from generation to generation but it doesn\u2019t get expanded through new players or big large new groups of followers because we don\u2019t have that platform.

There\u2019s a single word for this, and it has just become Collins Dictionary\u2019s word of the year: permacrisis. The word is defined as \u201can extended period of instability and insecurity\u201d, which some may argue is an accurate summary of the past few years. Collins said it chose the word as it \u201csums up quite succinctly how truly awful 2022 has been for so many people\u201d. Permacrisis tops a list of 10 words, six of them new entries in the dictionary, which represent 2022, Collins said. \u201cPartygate\u201d refers to the scandal of social gatherings in Downing Street during the pandemic, contravening public health rules and contrasting markedly with most people\u2019s sense of isolation and loss. \u201cKyiv\u201d made the list after the name of the Ukrainian capital came to symbolise the country\u2019s stand against Russian aggression. \u201cWarm bank\u201d describes a building such as a public library or place of worship that is opening its doors over the winter months to provide a welcoming space for people struggling to heat their homes due to spiralling energy costs. The growing practice of \u201cquiet quitting\u201d \u2013 doing basic duties at work but no more, in rejection of competitive careerism and out-of-hours emails \u2013 made the cut, as did \u201cvibe shift\u201d, meaning a \u201csignificant change in the prevailing atmosphere or culture\u201d. \u201cCarolean\u201d refers to the new monarchical era after the end of the second Elizabethan age this year and the accession of King Charles. \u201cLawfare\u201d is the strategic use of legal proceedings to intimidate or hinder an opponent. Humankind\u2019s four-legged friends contributed the term \u201csplooting\u201d \u2013 the act of lying flat on the stomach on a cool surface with legs stretched out as a way of countering unusually high temperatures. Cats, dogs, cows, polar bears and squirrels have been spotted splooting on social media throughout 2022. The final word is \u201csportswashing\u201d, a term for organisations and countries that use sports activities to enhance their reputations or distract from unacceptable policies. Qatar, the host of the 2022 football World Cup starting this month, has been accused of sportswashing after concerns over the mistreatment of migrant labour, homophobia and freedom of expression. The list reflected \u201cthe state of the world right now\u201d, said Alex Beecroft, the managing director of Collins Learning. \u201cLanguage can be a mirror to what is going on in society and the wider world and this year has thrown up challenge after challenge. \u201cIt is understandable that people may feel, after living through upheaval caused by Brexit, the pandemic, severe weather, the war in Ukraine, political instability, the energy squeeze and the cost-of-living crisis, that we are living in an ongoing state of uncertainty and worry.\u201d Collins Dictionary monitors its 18bn-word database and a range of media sources, including social media, to create an annual list of new and notable words."

                    "body": "This article is part of the Guardian\u2019s World Cup 2022 Experts\u2019 Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 32 countries who qualified. theguardian.com is running previews from two countries each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 20 November.\nThe plan\nThe situation heading into a tournament has never been this clear. Nine of the 11 starting places feel cemented; the remaining two are anybody\u2019s guess \u2013 but not because there are no good options, quite the contrary. Zlatko Dalic has three or four players competing for each of those (right-wing and centre-forward) and will decide who gets the nod on a game-to-game basis, depending on the opponent and player form. What is particularly pleasing, given that in the past the manager had been known to engage in plenty of unnecessary experiments, is that he is now fully settled on an approach and has made that very clear.\n\u201cI won\u2019t change the way we play,\u201d he said ahead of the deciding Nations League matches that ultimately ended with Croatia winning a group consisting of France, Denmark and Austria. \u201cWhen you have a midfield like ours, you have to strive to move the ball and create your chances through possession. We must play out of the back and when midfielders don\u2019t have to drop deep to get the ball we are more dangerous. We\u2019ll press when possible, and when not, we\u2019ll defend in a block.\u201d\n\nThe 4-3-3 formation is definitely Dalic\u2019s primary choice, with 4-2-3-1 as a backup. And although the midfield trio have more than 300 caps between them, there have been changes elsewhere \u2013 particularly in defence, with starting centre-backs aged 22 and 20 who are much more mobile and confident on the ball than their veteran predecessors. Most of the 2018 silver-medal winning squad has been replaced and there are important additions even since last year\u2019s Euros, such as Josip Sutalo and Borna Sosa.\n\nThe coach\nSomehow it all fell into place for Zlatko Dalic. He\u2019s been through some depressing times and embarrassing defeats since the last World Cup, as signs of complacency and a rift within the squad took hold. However, he managed to reunite and reshape the team with fresh additions, emerging with renewed confidence and public approval \u2013 although not quite like the 2018 mass worship. His priest-like public persona and persistent talk of humility may have worn a little thin but he is certainly not meek: just ask Milan\u2019s Ante Rebic, who has not been a part of the team since Euro 2020.\nStar player\nLuka Modric. Cliches on ageing like wine aside, the 37-year-old captain is still fully deserving of his undoubted status as the team\u2019s leader, its biggest star and MVP. You will see him work just as hard and run at least as much as any of his younger teammates. And if time has slowed him down at all, it has not taken its toll on the speed of his thinking or on his creativity, which are as incredible as they ever were.\n\nUnsung hero\nMarcelo Brozovic used to be unreliable, inconsistent and without a fully defined position or role in the team; now he\u2019s pretty much the opposite in all those aspects. With time, Brozovic has settled in the holding midfielder position and Croatia have benefited because they have lacked that type of player in the past (certainly before the 2018 World Cup, which is when he made it his domain). It is where Brozovic\u2019s seemingly endless stamina works best with both his physical and technical capacities. Virtually irreplaceable.\nProbable lineup\n\nQatar stance\nThe dark side of the World Cup has been documented in various sections of the media, albeit usually without suggesting the players should concern themselves with such things, which they don\u2019t. None of them have spoken up \u2013 and neither have the fans, really. As for the people in charge, they not only sent the team to Doha for a friendly tournament in March but in September assembled an impromptu under-23 selection of players who did not make the senior or under-21 squad for a friendly against Qatar\u2019s senior team. Croatia won 3-0.\nNational anthem\nOriginally a mid-19th-century poem by diplomat turned poet Antun Mihanovic, and composed by Josip Runjanin, at the time a young military cadet who also dabbled in music. It gained wider popularity in the 20th century and four of the original 14 verses were adapted into the national anthem titled Lijepa Nasa Domovino (Our Beautiful Homeland). The lyrics contain no war cries and nor does the anthem they address God; it can be summarised as \u201cOur land is so nice and we love it.\u201d Since 1991 some politicians and all athletes have been singing it with their right hand on their hearts.\nAll-time cult hero\nIvica Olic. \u201cWhat does a defender do when he sees Ivica Olic doing stepovers?\u201d the joke went at the height of the forward\u2019s career. \u201cHe politely waits until Olic finishes, then takes the ball.\u201d Maybe Olic would have struggled to go past a piece of garden furniture with his dribbling skills but he could outrun anyone \u2013 or at least he would try to, over and over again. Fans loved him for it, because he was old school and a true fighter. Since 2017, when he made an almost instant transition after his playing career came to an end, Olic has been the assistant manager on Dalic\u2019s staff \u2013 interrupted only by a brief stint as CSKA Moscow head coach last year.\nAleksandar Holiga writes for Telesport.

Brad Donald\u2019s side surpassed the 88-point margin set in the last World Cup in 2017 against Canada, running in 17 tries to set up a final group game clash with New Zealand on Thursday (Friday AEDT).  The undefeated Kiwis Ferns brushed the Cook Islands aside earlier on Sunday (Monday AEDT) to claim a 34-4 win with both teams now set to square off for the chance to top Group B.  \u201cIt was really clinical,\u201d Donald said. \u201cThe zero [was most pleasing]. We\u2019d happily win this tournament 2-0 and we showed up for each other. We haven\u2019t got a best side, you could pick anyone from the 24 and they\u2019d perform similarly. There\u2019s a lot of post-contact metres in those Kiwi forwards so we have to make sure we are on our game defensively.\u201d  In Group A, both England and Papua New Guinea are assured of a place in the semi-finals. Winger Shenae Ciesiolka scored after two just minutes, kickstarting the Jillaroos\u2019 dominant first half to finish 58-0 at the break. Jessica Sergis scored four tries, her fellow centre Jaime Chapman grabbed a hat-trick on debut and winger Julia Robinson also crossed three times. Fullback Emma Tonegato, Tallisha Harden, Olivia Kernick and Tarryn Aiken also touched down with Evania Pelite contributing a try-scoring double. It was another harsh reminder of the disparity between Australia and the rest of the world. Australia have yet to concede in this campaign and the chasm between players exposed to the NRLW and those who haven\u2019t, has been laid bare at this tournament.  \u201cWe\u2019ve got an open door policy on what we\u2019ve done and we\u2019d love to share that with any nation,\u201d Donald said. \u201cThey all work but they have transitioned from amateurs into professionals, like Olympians. We would be more than happy to share our programs on what these girls have done to raise the bar.\u201d"

Members of the Public and Commercial Services union (PCS) working at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) will strike for five days after talks to resolve a pay dispute stalled. Caterers employed by the food services company Aramark, who run the canteen for Department for Business staff and provide food for trade delegations, as well as cleaners, security guards and reception workers, will take action at BEIS in Westminster on 16, 23 and 30 November, and 7 and 14 December. The Aramark employees voted 100% \u201cyes\u201d for strike action on a 75% turnout. They will be joined on strike by post and porterage staff employed by the outsourcer ISS following disagreements on health and safety protocols that arose during the Covid pandemic. PCS is urging BEIS, which holds the contract, to allow wages to increase. Its general secretary, Mark Serwotka, said: \u201cA recent survey showed a third of our members were skipping meals because they couldn\u2019t afford to buy food, so it would be no surprise if these hard-working caterers would struggle to afford the food they serve to others. \u201cWe demand they receive an above-inflation pay rise to help them through the cost-of-living crisis and beyond.\u201d The strike is the latest in a long series of industrial actions this year, as workers seek better pay and conditions amid soaring inflation and bills and a labour shortage. On Friday, hundreds of workers at Heathrow airport announced a three-day strike in the run-up to the World Cup finals in Qatar. Rail workers from the RMT union planning three days of 24-hour strikes on Saturday, Monday and Wednesday called them off on Friday to return to negotiations. However, a London Underground strike by the union\u2019s members affecting the tube on Thursday 10 November will still go ahead. An Aramark spokesperson said: \u201cWe have had several meetings with PCS union leaders and the bargaining committee in an effort to reach a new agreement. We believe we\u2019ve made a fair and comprehensive offer. We regret that the union and employees have rejected our offer and are moving to strike, but the company intends to keep working toward a settlement that works for everyone. During any strike action, we have contingency plans in place to ensure no major disruption to services.\u201d BEIS and ISS have been approached for comment."

                    "body": "Bairstow goes wild at Trent Bridge When Rob Key announced the appointment of Brendon McCullum as England\u2019s Test coach in May, he advised fans to \u201cbuckle up and get ready for the ride\u201d. There will surely be some disappointments at some point but so far the Kiwi and his captain, Ben Stokes, have taken them on a dizzying, thrilling tour of the game\u2019s giddy heights. Already there has been a string of highlights but it would be hard to beat the final day at a packed Trent Bridge, the festive atmosphere supercharged by the fact that everyone had got their ticket for free. England chased 299 to win and at tea stood at 139 for four off 34 overs, with Jonny Bairstow on 43 off 48 balls. He scored 45 off the next 20 deliveries he faced, repeatedly nailing pull shots high over midwicket. \u201cBen said: \u2018Don\u2019t even think about hitting it down, just plant it in the stands,\u2019\u201d said Bairstow. \u201cI was just trying to do what the captain said.\u201d Their challenge was to score 299 in 72 overs; they did it with 22 to spare. \u201cI can\u2019t quite wrap my head around it,\u201d said Stokes. \u201cThat\u2019s never going to happen again.\u201d India and Pakistan create chaos at climax For all that their team went and won the thing, England fans didn\u2019t see the best of the T20 World Cup. While they were toiling through the group stage, their momentum repeatedly derailed by bad weather, the drama was happening elsewhere. The two big-name sides in the opening group stage, Sri Lanka and West Indies, lost their opening games to Namibia and Scotland respectively \u2013 despite their win the Scots still didn\u2019t qualify, and despite their defeat Sri Lanka did. In the Super 12s Pakistan, needing to score three runs off the last three balls to beat Zimbabwe, found a way to lose, while South Africa fell apart against the Netherlands and were knocked out. England\u2019s outstanding performance came against India in the semi-final but it was India\u2019s first match rather than their last that stands as the tournament\u2019s most extraordinary occasion, played in front of 90,293 colourful, noisy and joyful supporters, and decided by a Virat Kohli innings described by Rohit Sharma as \u201cnot just his best, one of India\u2019s best\u201d. The moment of peak chaos came in a final over full of ludicrously improbable plot twists, when Pakistan\u2019s Mohammad Nawaz bowled Kohli \u2013 but it was a free hit, the ball skittered away to third man and India ran three to take themselves to the verge of victory. Dean\u2019s Mankad It was a hell of a way to decide a match and end a series. Charlie Dean\u2019s remarkable, near-match-saving innings of 47 ended just as England started to think of victory after she was controversially run out at the non-striker\u2019s end \u2013 Mankadded, if you will \u2013 by Deepti Sharma to become the final English wicket to fall. She left the pitch in tears but though the incident was hugely controversial (becoming sufficiently well known that when Mitchell Starc threatened Jos Buttler with a similar fate a few weeks later and 10,500 miles away in Canberra, stump microphones recorded him warning: \u201cI\u2019m not Deepti, but I can do it\u201d), a comprehensive analysis of Dean\u2019s innings showed that she had left the crease early on about 85% of all the deliveries when she was at the non-striker\u2019s end. That makes it hard to complain about the eventual outcome. The debate about this type of dismissal seems to have progressed as a result of the furore, with the view expressed by Michael Atherton on Sky \u2013 \u201cThe message is clear really: if you\u2019re a non-striker at the non-striker\u2019s end, you stay in your ground until you see the ball released, and this thing can never happen\u201d \u2013 increasingly widespread. The following day Dean was back at Lord\u2019s for the Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy, where at the start of her first over with the ball she stopped her run-up in her final stride as if to execute a run-out of her own, to cheers and laughter from the crowd. She left the wicket alone.  Ellis wins T20 Blast for Hampshire (twice) One ball of the T20 Blast final left and Nathan Ellis stands at the end of his run-up with Lancashire needing four to win. If he can stop Richard Gleeson hitting it to the boundary, the trophy is Hampshire\u2019s. He runs in and produces an impeccable slow yorker that bemuses the batter and hammers into off-stump, and he sprints away in celebration as fireworks explode around Edgbaston. Behind him, teammates rip the remaining stumps out of the ground before joining the joyful huddle. And then they see the umpire, Graham Lloyd, arm at 90 degrees, beckoning them back. Ellis had overstepped, and Gleeson would get another go with the outfield now clouded in firework smoke and only two required. Ellis has to do it all again and that\u2019s precisely what he does \u2013 another slower ball, another swing and a miss from Gleeson, and a bye is not enough (though they actually ran two, providing fuel for a bit of post-match controversy about precisely when the ball became dead). Fabulously good drama. Boult opts out of NZ central contract Last December South Africa\u2019s Quinton de Kock unexpectedly announced his retirement from Test cricket. In July England\u2019s Ben Stokes retired from one-day internationals (though he may yet reconsider). Shimron Hetmyer seems to have pretty much opted out of international cricket altogether, albeit unofficially \u2013 he played eight of West Indies\u2019 52 matches of 2022, his absence variously blamed on poor fitness, injury, missed flights and recent parenthood. Yet he had no problems turning out for 15 of the 17 Rajasthan Royals games in the Indian Premier League and all 11 Guyana Amazon Warriors matches in the Caribbean Premier League, as well as finding space in his crowded calendar for the Abu Dhabi T10. In November the rising English star Will Smeed, at the age of only 21 and without a first-class appearance to his name, decided to give up on red-ball cricket. But it was when Trent Boult asked to be released from his central contract in August that the cricket world teetered on its axis. The bowler\u2019s decision, albeit at the age of 33, to \u201cmove into the next phase\u201d \u2013 less international cricket, concentrating on family and franchises \u2013 felt like a significant domino falling."

                    "body": "England hope to use the shock of defeat to Ireland to their advantage in Friday\u2019s crucial match against Australia in the T20 World Cup. Their coach, Matthew Mott, has called on his side to \u201cshow a response\u201d.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t often win World Cups at the start and you often lose a game early,\u201d he said. \u201cFor some teams that\u2019s actually quite liberating and frees them up with more of an aggressive mindset. It can be a bit of sting that you need. We don\u2019t want to lose any games but it is probably going to galvanise the group in terms of our approach.\n\n\u201cIf we play a good game and Australia are better than us that\u2019s OK with me. We need to show a response. We need to come out with a really attacking mindset and maybe throw caution to the wind and see how we go. A lot of people, after one result, have written us off. I don\u2019t think it makes much difference. We can still progress to the semis and from there it\u2019s anyone\u2019s game.\u201d\nWith less than 48 hours between the end of the Ireland game and the scheduled start of the Australia match, England have had no time to dwell on defeat. \u201cThat\u2019s game\u2019s done now, put that to bed,\u201d Liam Livingstone said. \u201cWe know where we need to get better and we\u2019ve got a massive challenge on Friday. I\u2019m sure everyone will be looking forward to that.\u201d\nHaving been thrashed by New Zealand in their opening game, Australia also feel they cannot afford to lose. But neither side has let their precarious position provoke doubts about their players: Aaron Finch would admit no concerns about his own form or that of Pat Cummins, who, after two games, is unexpectedly the most expensive bowler in the tournament (of those who have bowled at least five overs). Nor would Mott about the batting of Ben Stokes, Dawid Malan or Harry Brook. \u201cDefinitely no sweeping changes,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re always talking about what to do differently but I still think we\u2019ve got the right balance.\u201d\nAfter the Ireland game Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes spoke to the group about how their approach must change. \u201cIt was a sombre dressing room,\u201d Mott said. \u201cI thought Ben spoke really well.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a different mindset now. We don\u2019t have the luxury of losing another game, we\u2019re playing against the hosts and defending champions and there\u2019s no need for us as coaches to motivate the group.\u201d\n\nThe dressing room was sombre in more ways than one. There are four at the MCG and for double-headers the primary pair are reserved for the teams involved in the late game. Ireland and England were thus accommodated on the opposite side of the ground, in spacious but gloomy subterranean rooms. England carried that atmosphere on to the pitch (not a problem Ireland seemed to suffer). They will be back in relative comfort of the main changing rooms on Friday.\nThis is just as well because they may well have to spend a long time there. Rain is forecast in Melbourne every day for the next week, including for much of Friday, and with another double-header scheduled \u2013 Afghanistan play Ireland in the afternoon \u2013 more abbreviated or abandoned matches seem likely. While clearly suboptimal, a rain-enforced draw would at least postpone the moment the guillotine falls on either side.\nThis has been a freak year for rainfall in Australia. Sydney has already passed its record for October and Melbourne is expected to do so before the month is out. But the timing of the tournament always put it at risk of disruption. Finch said on Thursday: \u201cIt\u2019s been a miserable couple of days, but playing a World Cup this time of year, weather\u2019s inevitable.\u201d\nIn the week from 20 October Brisbane had 97.4mm of rain, Melbourne 50.4mm and Sydney 31.6mm, all of them more than any region in England. The tournament\u2019s slogan is \u201cThis is the Big Time\u201d, but perhaps they should have considered \u201cThis is the Wrong Time\u201d."

                    "body": "Behind the counter of his grocery store in the Goutte d\u2019Or neighbourhood in northern Paris, Abdel was on a video call to his cousin in a village in the Atlas mountains. Morocco\u2019s historic World Cup semi-final match against France on Wednesday was all they could talk about, and the mood could be summed up in one word, he said, shaking his shoulders: \u201cDancing!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s incredible to be the first ever African team in the semi-final. It\u2019s only sport, but it\u2019s bringing people together, from the grandparents to little kids,\u201d he said. Abdel, 48, was born in Paris to Moroccan parents who arrived in the early 1950s, when Morocco was still a French protectorate. They set up this grocery store in what remains one of northern Paris\u2019s most diverse neighbourhoods. Like many people in France with joint French and Moroccan nationality, he saw the match as a win-win. \u201cIf Morocco wins, history will be made, with Africa in the final. If France wins, the reigning champions could keep their title. Either way, I have reason to celebrate.\u201d After Morocco\u2019s national airline added flights from Casablanca to Doha for Moroccan supporters, he felt that the large diaspora in Europe could also be itching to get to Morocco. \u201cIf Morocco get into the final, I\u2019ll fly back to the village to watch it there, to take in the atmosphere \u2013 this feels like in a once in a lifetime event.\u201d The unexpected semi-final clash between the world champions, France, and the outsider success story, Morocco, is being seen as deeply symbolic in France, which has for decades grappled with the notion of national identity and its colonial past. At a moment when the far-right is the biggest single opposition party in the French parliament and its anti-immigration ideas are being echoed by other parties, Morocco\u2019s team has been hailed as a symbol of immigration and the Moroccan diaspora \u2013 a large number of Morocco\u2019s squad were born or grew up outside Morocco, including its coach, Walid Regragui, who was born and raised near Paris.  Dual French-Moroccan citizens in France say the match should not be reduced to a revenge story of a country that was under French rule from 1912 to 1956. Instead, they see it as a celebration of the many people who have diverse heritage in France. Still, when crowds celebrating Morocco\u2019s quarter-final win against Portugal gathered on Paris\u2019s Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es for a largely festive evening after the quarter-finals, the far-right TV pundit \u00c9ric Zemmour seized on the dozens of arrests made across France that night, and limited clashes in Paris, warning of \u201criots\u201d. Policing will be stepped up on the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es on Wednesday night.  The match comes at a delicate moment in the diplomatic relationship between France and Morocco. Relations grew frosty last year after the Pegasus project revelations that the phone number of the president, Emmanuel Macron, as well as those of several French ministers, appeared in leaked data, raising fears their phones may have been of interest to Morocco. The issue of the western Sahara and France\u2019s visa allocations to Moroccan nationals have also caused tension. The French media has written of \u201cMaghreb United\u201d as many Algerians and Tunisians in France join Moroccan supporters. \u201cHow could you not love this Moroccan team that came out of nowhere?\u201d said Momo, a baker in the Goutte d\u2019Or, who left Tunisia 14 years ago to work in Paris, but who would also simultaneously support France. \u201cSplit in two, like many.\u201d Marie, who owned a local haberdashery store and arrived in France from Cameroon to study business when she was 18, said: \u201cIt\u2019s significant for people from many countries that it\u2019s the first African team to get this far.\u201d \u201cThe Moroccan team has had an incredible journey to this point, which we may never see again in our lifetime,\u201d said Rachid Zerrouki, a Marseille school teacher who writes on education. \u201cWhether France or Morocco wins, I\u2019ll be happy \u2013 that\u2019s what dual nationality is all about.\u201d Zerrouki, 30, spent his first 15 years in Morocco and has since lived in Marseille. He said of Zemmour\u2019s attempt to stir division through football: \u201cBest to ignore it and focus on the joy. They try to make themselves heard saying: \u2018Look at all at those Moroccans outside, it\u2019s the \u201cgreat replacement\u201d, we\u2019re no longer in France\u2019. But that very much represents a minority, because around me all I see is people who are happy at Morocco\u2019s success.\u201d Dr Brahim Oumansour, director of the Observatory on the Maghreb at the French institute for international and strategic affairs, said the match was a kind of local derby given the large number of Moroccans in France \u2013 including many students \u2013 as well as the many French in Morocco, including pensioners who retired there. He said that in terms of colonisation, Morocco\u2019s relationship to France had been different to that of Algeria. Whereas Algeria faced what he called \u201ctotal colonisation\u201d with a massive presence of colonisers, land taken and \u201ca war of independence which was one of the most violent wars in the 20th century\u201d, Morocco, as a protectorate, achieved independence \u201cmuch more through negotiation\u201d, which allowed its later relationship to France to be closer. He said it would be \u201creductionist\u201d to frame the match as post-colonial revenge. \u201cIt\u2019s more a story about a team\u2019s success. People who emigrated from such countries were often marked by the frustrations of not succeeding, or their states not developing. \u201cAnd when you see a team succeed, you have a tendency to sympathise with that and project on to that collective success, it\u2019s about how the Maghreb\u2019s diaspora can play an important role not just in sport, but in all sorts of sectors.\u201d"

                    "body": "How can you sell something you never actually paid for? How is it possible to make profit without risk or jeopardy, or indeed any sign of expertise along the way? What is this miracle commodity, this blend of metal, plastic, turf and other people\u2019s monetised joy? Welcome to football capitalism 101 and the metaphysical puzzle of the Glazer ownership of Manchester United. No wonder they call leveraged buy-outs the beautiful game. It is, in the end, one you just can\u2019t lose. More to the point, what does it mean when not one but two members of English football\u2019s US billionaires\u2019 club announce they have decided to cut and run, the Glazers midway through a Gulf\u2011powered World Cup that has, just because it can, cut a hole in the decadent old European club season?  For now, most United supporters will have only one response to the news that the club is, probably, possibly up for sale. That response is unfettered celebration, and rightly so. It will be tempting at this point to say things like: be careful what you wish for, beware what lies beneath, there are no clean hands here, and all the rest. This is undoubtedly true. Newcastle supporters, for example, are currently required to wrestle with the contradictions of being \u201cgiven back their club\u201d by generous and competent owners; who wish, simultaneously, to use that precious entity as an amplifier for a repressive regime, something that sounds like giving back, but also like taking away. Just wait until Bahrain gets wind of this, or the Mongol empire (Manchester thanks you, Genghis) or General Zod of the Krypton military command. For now such contortions can wait. In the meantime, why not kick back and enjoy the moment. Because whatever lies in store, at least it won\u2019t be this. How to summarise the Glazer era? Firstly, it\u2019s not an era. Eras contain events, structure and achievements. This has been something else, a kind of staged congealment, with the sense of an object being expertly hollowed out from the inside. The Glazers have been terrible football club owners. At the same time they have been very good at being terrible owners. Expertly parasitical, beautifully slick at turning Manchester United into an Avanti trains kind of club: something fundamentally shabby and grudging, all cut corners, blocked toilets, skeleton staff, the natural monopoly on their fans\u2019 footballing loyalties stretched thin for a quick buck.  There have been three broad stages to this. The first was the late-Ferguson plateau, when momentum and managerial will allowed the ship to keep drifting forward. This was followed by the post-Ferguson chaos, during which the club spent (other people\u2019s) money incoherently, appointed pliant placemen to key roles, and still rinsed the brand for all it\u2019s worth with genuine skill and care. The last year has seen a third stage, a panicked attempt to rescue a little gloss, with money spent in a rush and the disastrous celebrity-influencer partnership with Cristiano Ronaldo. Through this, the dominant note of Glazer-ism has been that branded emptiness, part haunted medieval hall, in thrall to its own ghosts, part celebrity waxwork museum, a grand old club reduced to something resembling a market stall sale of remaindered Gary Pallister dolls (may have been damaged in transit). It is entirely natural United would want to move on from that version of itself. Whatever comes next will be different. Sometimes you just want to feel something again.  Although what happens next will, as ever, be dictated by larger tides. Because something does seem to be happening here, and it\u2019s not just a Manchester story. The usual suspects will enter the takeover chat. An ambitious nation-state. A consortium headed by a showy US billionaire. Jim Ratcliffe, who sounds acceptable because he\u2019s called Jim and is a genuine home-loving Englishman from Monaco. The wider note in this story, a little overlooked to now, is the fact Liverpool are also up for sale. Is this starting to seem strange yet? Are the rabbits rustling in the treeline? The two most valuable privately owned properties in English football are put up for sale within a month of one another. The key US billionaires, boarding group one, are cashing out simultaneously. This is significant enough as a standalone event. But there are no coincidences. And as ever, always follow the money. It is hard not to conclude that this is related to the failure of the Super League. The prospect of fresh growth under that model was clearly a major part of the strategy. Many people think it will still happen in some form, but perhaps not in that same blunt and brutal way the Glazers and Fenway Sports Group had aggressively championed. It does also feel oddly poignant that this should emerge during the Qatar World Cup. The split in European club football\u2019s power-players has on one side loosely aligned, the nation-state clubs (Paris Saint-Germain, Manchester City, Chelsea for two decades, Newcastle United for the next two) driven by political and soft power aims; and on the other clubs owned by private bodies interested in making a profit, along with others under some more bespoke form of ownership, chiefly Bayern Munich and the Spanish cl\u00e1sico clubs.  The real driver behind the ESL was the prospect of capping the power of nation-state clubs, of finding a way to compete with an entity that has no commercial jeopardy, where simply keeping up \u2013 and most football clubs are horribly reckless \u2013 means killing yourself. Its collapse, and the likely departures of FSG and the Glazers, are all signs that the nation-state clubs are winning this. The cartel is, frankly, in disarray. Barcelona have sold their future in return for a wonky version of the present. Juventus Ronaldo\u2019d themselves in search of an illusory next level. What does it leave? The arrival of Todd Boehly at Chelsea is evidence US investors and their partners still see major potential for growth here, that football\u2019s value will simply continue to rise. And yet, somehow, watching Boehly it is hard to shake a slight sense of doubt. Are we through the good billionaires? Is Boehly the Liz Truss of the Premier League ownership party, the sediment at the bottom of the barrel, the comedy endgame? Does this really feel like a convincing version of the future, fit to push Abu Dhabi and Qatar? It is still a rising tide out there, a product that is relentlessly in demand. And with the old guard on their way out this leaves seven Premier League clubs with US owners or investors. Perhaps the future is a more dynamic form of entrepreneurial growth, the kind of stuff Boehly has been sketching out: tuning the details, introducing new gimmickry, even another great pivot. The identity of the new owners at Old Trafford and Anfield will tell us a great deal about Premier League ownership 3.0. But it is already hard to avoid two conclusions. First that this is still all within the blast radius of the Super League, collateral to that failed coup. And second, that what the Glazers will leave behind is something desiccated and emptied out, another host body for football\u2019s own vampiric late capitalism. With no rules around countries and their investment funds owning clubs, or on how private investors can pillage these assets, the hunt for \u2018good owners\u2019 will continue. For now the market will decide. For United fans there is perhaps consolation in the simple fact that, at the very least, it won\u2019t be this."

                    "body": "While Lionel Messi was busy completing his career odyssey in the most dramatic fashion, David Beckham watched from the stands, hopeful his Inter Miami team could land its very own unicorn. The Major League Soccer franchise is reportedly \u201cconfident\u201d of signing Messi following the 2022-23 European season, and \u201cclose\u201d to a deal making him the highest-paid player in MLS history.  Messi to Miami would be earth-shattering: the most significant move in American soccer since Beckham rocked up at LA Galaxy to revolutionize the domestic game 15 years ago. It would elevate Inter Miami from a middling expansion franchise with a famous owner to the league\u2019s biggest draw. The team has been open in the courtship for years, and Messi calls playing in the MLS a \u201cdream\u201d. Beckham has always promised Miami \u201ca star\u201d and there are none bigger. \u201cObviously there\u2019s lots of excitement from the fanbase. When you see Messi and Inter Miami, how could you not be excited?\u201d says Franco Panizo, founder of the Miami Total Football podcast. \u201cHe\u2019s an icon, an idol, and one of the greats of the game. You can argue he\u2019s the greatest of all time. What would this mean for the Latin American community in south Florida? How would they embrace the Messi extravaganza? How would that elevate the game in the area?\u201d The potential impact for the club and MLS\u2019s global profile is monumental \u2013 the game\u2019s biggest name, fresh from a career-capping World Cup win where he was crowned Player of The Tournament \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t automatically make it the best move for Inter Miami on the field. Messi turns 36 next summer and would join MLS mid-season, after playing every minute of Argentina\u2019s grueling World Cup triumph and a full campaign with Qatar-owned Paris Saint-Germain, who may now make a renewed effort to retain the player and further bask in that World Cup glory.  Much like the US men\u2019s national team, MLS has transitioned to an athletic, youth-focused league, shedding the \u201cretirement home\u201d sneers. Older big-name imports have mixed records \u2013 for every Beckham and Zlatan, there\u2019s been a flop like Steven Gerrard or Frank Lampard \u2013 and Inter itself risks becoming a mere sideshow. Yet it\u2019s an opportunity the club must seize, according to former USMNT striker Alan Gordon. He played 15 MLS seasons with and against franchise signings like Beckham and Thierry Henry. He says Messi\u2019s impact would be the league\u2019s next great catalyst. \u201cMessi is the biggest name in the sport and one of the best to ever step foot on a soccer pitch. He\u2019s going to fill stands,\u201d he tells the Guardian. \u201cBefore Beckham came, we travelled \u2018Group C\u2019 on Southwest Airlines with LA Galaxy. We\u2019d walk through the airport and either nobody knew us, or nobody cared. When he arrived, we went from playing in front of 10,000, to 60-70,000 people in [American] football stadiums. That\u2019s what it\u2019s going to be like. And guess what? I\u2019d be the first to grab a ticket and take my kids to see Messi.\u201d The changing face of MLS The national team\u2019s positive showing at the World Cup may bring new fans to MLS in 2023, with or without an attraction like Messi. Yet fans at domestic games won\u2019t see new Gen-Z stars like US captain Tyler Adams. He and Brenden Aaronson play for Leeds. Christian Pulisic is at Chelsea, Yunus Musah is at Valencia, Weston McKennie plays for Juventus. Rather than crown Leo Messi its highest-paid player ever, could MLS clubs do more to lure back homegrown talent \u2013 like Pulisic, who remains a peripheral figure at Chelsea \u2013 ahead of the 2026 World Cup in North America?  \u201cFor the league, 100% it would be in its best interest to have these players,\u201d says Alan Gordon, who won the MLS Cup with LA Galaxy in 2005 and 2014. \u201cBut as a country you want those guys developing and playing in the top leagues and American players gaining notoriety. Our kids are playing in world-class Champions League teams.\u201d The USMNT had the second youngest squad at the World Cup, averaging 25.2 years. Fifteen were 24 or younger. Eighteen had ties to MLS as former, current or academy players. MLS, at 25.9 years, now has a younger average age than Liga MX (27.5) the Premier League (27.1) and La Liga (27.7), per Transfermarkt. Compared to the five top European Leagues, MLS says it ranked third in both percentage of minutes played and goals scored by players 21 and under. While Messi may transcend such metrics, Miami are striving to get younger. From third-oldest (27.9) in 2021, they fell to 26.2 in 2022, in line with the MLS average. Beckham is also keen to emulate the Manchester United academy he and coach Phil Neville attended and to promote local youth.  \u201cMLS is a young person\u2019s league. Some of the best young players are coming through the academies. We\u2019re a club that wants to produce our own players,\u201d Neville told the Guardian in 2021. A total of 151 different homegrown players played an MLS game in 2022, more than doubling since the 2018 season, while minutes played are up by 90%. Sixty-two homegrown players scored goals, the most in league history and up 50% since 2018. Homegrown players also provided 200 assists for the first time. With the U22 Initiative rule introduced in 2021, MLS teams can sign three young players to league max contracts with a minimal salary cap hit, until they turn 25. It has helped teams to sign talented youth to competitive deals. The mechanics are in place and the league is younger and more populated with homegrown players than ever. Given Messi would have played a near calendar year of football how much could Miami wring from a mid-2023 season arrival? \u201cRealistically? Bits and pieces. If he signs, I imagine he\u2019d have a break in June, not arrive until July, and maybe not play for a few weeks until he gets in shape,\u201d says Panizo, who has covered MLS for over a decade. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of big-name star power arrive and they often struggle during the first season. There are so many different challenges, with the travel schedule and different weather. One weekend you\u2019re playing at altitude in Colorado and the next in the Houston heat.\u201d Miami may build a roster for 2023, hopeful that Messi will join. Prior to Sunday\u2019s final, Messi had walked 31km of the 52km he covered (58%) on the field \u2013 the most of any player at the tournament. It\u2019s no argument against signing Messi, but it does mean Miami would need hard-running midfielders akin to Rodrigo De Paul or Alexis Mac Allister to pick up that workload. \u201cMiami would need to put the right pieces around him with a lot of workers,\u201d says Gordon. From Beckham to Bale As Miami chases Messi, there\u2019s a lesson to heed learned from MLS history \u2013 signing superstars doesn\u2019t often translate to trophies. Thierry Henry racked up a legacy-securing 52 goals and 49 assists in 133 MLS games for New York Red Bulls. In those five years the team reached the conference finals once. Gerrard\u2019s LA Galaxy years didn\u2019t stretch beyond the conference semis. Even Zlatan Ibrahimovic\u2019s 53 goals in 56 regular season LA Galaxy games weren\u2019t enough. The team missed the 2018 playoffs and reached the conference semi in 2019.  A splashy signing from the European leagues has been MLS MVP just twice: Robbie Keane in 2014 and David Villa for NYCFC in 2016. Beckham himself endured rough years in LA before ending his career with back-to-back MLS Cups. \u201cThe first three years were awful,\u201d says Gordon, 41, now a mortgage sales manager in Colorado. \u201cThere was so much expectation, but there are 10 other players on the field and you had to build a good overall roster, which was tough back then. \u201cBut he had this tremendous, fairytale ending. He stayed in the league and was committed, even though he saw failure and people were very critical of him. He persevered and ended up having one of the best teams in MLS history with Robbie Keane and Landon Donovan.\u201d Amid the cautionary tales, an exception (of sorts) is Gareth Bale. A bit-part player since arriving from Real Madrid, Bale\u2019s 128th-minute header for 10-man LAFC equalled the scores against Philadelphia in the MLS Cup final. LA won the shootout and a first MLS title.  \u201cI\u2019m not sure I loved the move!\u201d Gordon says. \u201cBut it was exciting. Because it was Bale it meant more, and those moments are key for this league. He\u2019s on the world level and those are worldwide headlines. Anything that Messi does here is going to be front and centre.\u201d For Inter Miami, acquiring global stars was a founding tenet. Thus far, Gonzalo Higua\u00edn and French World Cup winner Blaise Matuidi have been the best known, but neither approach Messi status. Panizo adds: \u201cThey\u2019re looking for a big household name. David Beckham has sold this narrative he\u2019s going to bring in the stars to go with the glitz and sexiness of Miami. \u201cEven if it\u2019s a catastrophic failure on the field, long-term it would be a success having him as part of the history of the club. One hundred years from now, you\u2019d be able to look back at clips of Messi playing in the pink and black.\u201d"

                    "body": "Like a lot of Welsh fans, I groaned when Wales were drawn in the same World Cup group as England. The World Cup is supposed to be about new experiences and global adventures. A game against our nearest neighbour would not only be familiar, it would also mean hype, distraction and politics. That\u2019s turned out to be true. There have been controversies around the Prince of Wales wishing England good luck. On social media, English fans have been sneering about how nine of the Welsh squad were born in England. Some seem uncomfortable with, or even threatened by, the assertive patriotism in Welsh football. One journalist suggested to me that it was a mask for hating England and asked where it would all end. Such perspectives were perhaps rooted in a blindness to the similar patriotism that exists in English sport. Or perhaps they expect little Wales to keep quiet and just be grateful to be there.  There was a time when playing England would have been a highlight for Wales. Most fans love a derby but for followers of smaller teams they are especially important. Those fans have little hope of a cup final or promotion so playing the neighbours enlivens otherwise drab seasons. With little to celebrate, songs about hating a local rival become key parts of the terrace repertoire. This was once true of Welsh fan culture. But in recent years derogatory songs about England have disappeared from Welsh matches, although one about the British union jack remains popular. Since Euro 2016 showed that Wales can compete at the highest level, Welsh fans no longer feel any need to measure themselves against English football. The same is not yet true of wider Welsh society. From the very beginnings of Wales, its people have defined themselves against England. The experience of conquest and the linguistic differences with England helped create a sense of unity among the different kingdoms of Wales. Even the name Wales was given to the Cymry, as they called themselves, by their English neighbour.  For centuries, Wales was politically marginalised and looked down upon as a rural backwoods where people spoke an uncivilised language. Some responded to this by abandoning their heritage and becoming anglicised. Others hung on to their culture and language but became defensive about it in the face of the contempt of social investigators, tourists, landlords or employers. In 1862, the travel writer George Borrow wrote: \u201cThe English have forgot that they ever conquered the Welsh, but some ages will elapse before the Welsh forget that the English have conquered them.\u201d At the end of the 19th century, this mattered less as the Welsh industrial economy boomed. But since the 1920s, the economy has struggled and Westminster often made little effort to change its course. Wales was out of sight and out of mind. It was little wonder that some in Wales grew angry and held governance from England responsible for all Wales\u2019s ills. Sometimes, there has been an unhealthy obsession with this history in Wales. This can be to the detriment of a sense of agency. If we just see ourselves as victims, trapped in an unhealthy relationship with our neighbour, then we forget that our future is in our own hands. Rather than feeling angry about its history, Wales should look to it for stories of inspiration. Welsh history is not just a story of national injustice but also one of resilience, solidarity and cooperation. It is full of individuals who made a difference.  Football is part of that story but it has given Wales more than just heroes to be inspired by. In the face of internal linguistic and political divisions and the absence of self-government, the existence of national sports teams is one of the most important reasons why Welsh identity survived. As other national cultural symbols, as nonconformism and language fell into decline, sport filled a void. It gave Welsh nationality a popular outlet. It reminded the Welsh, and the wider world, that Wales was a nation. It told everyone that Wales was not part of England. But sport could also never escape the wider political and cultural history. The difficult relationship with England was why many fans were desperate to beat England. Equality on the pitch was compensation for inequality off it. In 1999, even BBC Wales ran a rugby trailer that declared: \u201cAs long as we beat the English, we don\u2019t care.\u201d  The London media have been partly responsible for such attitudes. In covering both sport and current affairs, newspapers, radio and television have all had a tendency to speak to their British audiences as if they were all English. Resentment of the repeated conflation of the UK and England is one of the underpinning factors behind the growth in Welsh and Scottish nationalism. Those movements are not based on any hostility to people in England but to the dynamics of how the United Kingdom actually works. Welsh fans aren\u2019t desperate to beat England out of hatred or because of history. Many have family there. Others live, work or were born there. Instead, we just want to beat England to get through to the next round. But if we do win, then the difficult history between the two nations will make it a little sweeter than just qualification. \u2022 Prof Martin Johnes is a historian of Wales, sport, politics and popular culture at Swansea University.

                    "body": "Unai Sim\u00f3n unzips the washbag he carries everywhere and carefully takes out a piece of paper. It is tiny, but its significance to him is huge. Unfolding it gently, he shows the code in black letters, symbols and numbers which were his instructions from the Euro 2020 quarter-final shootout. In the previous round, his mistake, allowing a 44m back pass to slip under his foot into the net, could have led to Spain being eliminated; four days later, his penalty saves against Switzerland took them to the semi. \u201cA liberation,\u201d he calls it.\nThose nights in Copenhagen and St Petersburg changed everything, and not just for Sim\u00f3n: la selecci\u00f3n were to be taken seriously again and he truly felt he was No 1. As Sim\u00f3n explains his approach to the game, the preparation and thinking behind it, the goalkeeper\u2019s role emerges as the embodiment of their commitment to an identity; an indication of how the whole team is set up.\n\nOh, and he says penalties are not a lottery. It\u2019s there in black and white. \u201cI\u2019ll show you,\u201d he says, referring to his precious slip of paper. There\u2019s a reason it travels with him like a lucky charm. Spain had gone from being crowned champions at three major tournaments in a row to not winning a knockout game in the next three. Reaching the semi-final and taking eventual winners Italy to a shootout at Wembley meant their status as contenders was restored. In London, they came within a fingertip of the final. In Qatar, where they are due to arrive on Friday, they aspire to go further.\nSim\u00f3n literally had. He had been acutely aware of what his error against Croatia at Euro 2020 might have meant. And yet, unshakeable, he did not play like it in the rest of that match and accepts his mistake \u2013 an own goal credited to Pedri \u2013 is a byproduct of the way Spain play. Every game it seems there\u2019s at least one moment when the crowd suffers a collective coronary with the ball at his feet and one of these days, he says, his grandparents, Juanito and Carmina, will have a panic attack. But he tells them he\u2019s not doing it for the thrill and nor can he let the fear in.\n\n\u201cI watch it back sometimes and I think: \u2018Shit, that was mad what I did.\u2019 Or: \u2018How difficult was that pass?\u2019 But that\u2019s how the manager wants us to play. I understand very clearly what I have to do. I\u2019m used to the other team being right on top of us, pressing us. We make a mistake every now and then but get it right far more. My mum has an awful time watching me. She doesn\u2019t go to games. My dad does, and when that Croatia goal went in it was hard, but he can take it.\u201d\nSo can Sim\u00f3n. There\u2019s a seriousness about him as he speaks that reflects how he plays, analytical and inalterable. Errors are inevitable \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ve made a lot of terrible mistakes since I was a kid, crazy goals\u201d \u2013 but Spain\u2019s style means doing it again, welcoming risks, so long as they\u2019re the right risks. \u201cThe best thing that can happen is you get the same ball again, control it and play. If it\u2019s a technical error, of execution, not a conceptual one, all you can think is: ok, next pass. A conceptual error is different: that means we haven\u2019t understood what the manager wants. If it\u2019s a pass played too short to the full-back, say, and it\u2019s been intercepted, that doesn\u2019t mean the next one goes to the centre-back instead: it\u2019s the same ball. You can\u2019t stop playing that pass.\u201d\nIt\u2019s about understanding which is not automatic, although it sounds it listening to Sim\u00f3n run through the options, describing how he waits for avenues to open, drawing players and pressure on to himself to release the \u201cthird man\u201d. It\u2019s hard to keep up with him. \u201cInternational football is quick, you take decisions fast. Your job is to open the pitch, create space, passing lines; the job of the goalkeeper is to orient the play towards the free man. It\u2019s not completely mechanised; you interpret. There are concepts I had no idea about two years ago. Now, I have the confidence to play. If you can\u2019t adapt, football moves on and you don\u2019t.\u201d\nFor Luis Enrique, the keeper-as-player is non-negotiable \u2013 a key reason why David de Gea is not in the squad with Robert S\u00e1nchez and David Raya chosen ahead of him \u2013 but Sim\u00f3n says that does not eclipse more traditional duties. \u201cSometimes I think we\u2019re getting a bit crazy in how we look at keepers,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat is his primary job still? Stop the ball going past him. A modern keeper, like [Marc-Andr\u00e9] ter Stegen, has both.\u201d\n\nSim\u00f3n proved he can do both in the remainder of that pulsating last-16 extra-time victory over Croatia. But he is aware that redemption requires results and is indebted to his teammates for the way they rallied after his mistake to claim a memorable 5-3 win. \u201cI had wanted to prove that I could be the selecci\u00f3n\u2019s goalkeeper. If we\u2019d lost 1-0, even if I\u2019d gone on to play as well, it wouldn\u2019t be recognised. Luckily that happened in the 20th minute, not the 95th. People remember how I overcame the mistake, but I needed the team to play brilliantly and end up winning.\u201d\nAll of which put him back on the spot. \u201cAgainst Switzerland and Italy we had penalties from all the players: even [goalkeeper Yann] Sommer. If [Giorgio] Chiellini, say, isn\u2019t usually a penalty taker, maybe there\u2019s one from a shootout at the end of some friendly years ago. I have all the information on the paper, by my towel: a type, a direction, the player\u2019s number.\n\u201cThat\u2019s important because I\u2019m not great at picking out faces. I\u2019m leaning on the post and until I see the number on the shorts I don\u2019t know who\u2019s walking up. I look at my paper. Just doing that sometimes makes the taker nervous: it could be blank! I\u2019ve spoken to forwards who say: \u2018Bloody hell, when I see the keeper looking at his chuleta, his cheat-sheet, I think: Shit, he knows where I\u2019m going\u2019.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not just where. \u201cThere are two different things. First, the key is: how do they approach the ball? Some look at the keeper, others only look at the ball because they know which way they\u2019re going. Then there\u2019s direction. Before I studied takers, I doubted when to commit, when to dive, so I would go too late. When you know a player doesn\u2019t look at you, so won\u2019t change, you can go sooner. You might choose wrong, it\u2019s not an exact science, but if you guess right you have more chance of getting there.\u201d\n\nWhich is why it hurt when Andrea Belotti scored. It\u2019s not diving the wrong way that upsets Sim\u00f3n; it\u2019s going the right way too slowly. At the end of the semi-final, Sim\u00f3n saved Italy\u2019s first penalty, taken by Manuel Locatelli, but it wasn\u2019t enough. \u201cWith Belotti, I had: \u2018Low, right, hard\u2019 which was correct, but I didn\u2019t stop it. I knew he went that side. I dived early and still didn\u2019t get there. I thought: \u2018Bloody hell, knowing that, knowing he only looks at the ball, I could have gone sooner.\u2019 That penalty made me so angry.\u201dBut when it is suggested that in a shootout, a goalkeeper can\u2019t really lose the response is swift. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s the perception. But if I don\u2019t save a penalty, or just one, I\u2019m annoyed. I\u2019ll think I didn\u2019t study them as I should have, or I didn\u2019t dive with the conviction needed. I\u2019m going home very upset with myself. Very upset.\u201d\nBelotti\u2019s penalty lingers still but Spain\u2019s performance at Euro 2020 meant they were back, with Sim\u00f3n and everything he represents at the heart of their revival, error included. Everything had changed but Sim\u00f3n does not have a problem keeping his feet firmly on the ground. \u201cMy mates aren\u2019t fazed by it at all, they don\u2019t care, and that helps me leave it all behind. I remember returning after the Euros and the Olympics, back to my village, happy as anything, and they said to me \u2026\u201d Sim\u00f3n stops and starts laughing. \u201c: \u2018So, how was your summer?\u2019\u201d"

                    "body": "The thing that made the goal was the touch; one of those touches where Lionel Messi doesn\u2019t so much trap the ball or kill it but lets it come and nestle, falling asleep on his toe like a fond old cat.\nThere were still six more touches to go before the ball would be left spinning, with a kind of purr, in the back of Mat Ryan\u2019s net. But it was the touch that set the clock running, as the ball was looped back out to Messi on the touchline from his own free-kick.\nYou could see straight away that Messi had felt that familiar surge of static, seen the numbers whirring, the spaces start to yawn. Footballers are often said to carry a picture in their head. Messi has a great whirring bank of air traffic controller\u2019s screens up there, alternate visions of the future to scroll through and finesse.\n\nThe touch spun the ball out in front of him, enough to draw the closest Australian shirt into his arc. This was a mistake. Don\u2019t run towards Messi. His dribbling is a kind of judo-throw effect these days, using his opponent\u2019s movement to trampoline into space.\nMessi sniped away. He had time now. Messi gets a kind of pre-screening of these things, sees the shapes before anyone else, like a pavement artist conjuring Notre-Dame out of four chalk lines. He laid the ball back to Alexis Mac Allister, then sped in a straight line towards the thing he knew would happen next.\nMac Allister laid the ball in to Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi. His touch was clumsy, but Otamendi had felt things thing starting to happen too. He performed a lovely little backwards sway, like a man leaping clear of the spray from a passing lorry.\nMessi took the ball and had time to take another step, to open his hips slightly as he ran, the movement hidden in his stride, but enough to ease the ball to Ryan\u2019s right, into the far corner and out of his reach. The Ahmad bin Ali Stadium erupted into a barrelling wave of noise on three sides, that distinctly Argentinian football noise, a shout of recognition as well as joy.\n\nTwenty minutes into the second half, with Argentina 2-0 up after Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez\u2019s delightful steal swivel and finish, Messi did something for fun, a kind of roll through the greatest hits. Taking the ball in the centre circle he just decided to keep running, conjuring the ghosts of the Camp Nou, that surging, mulletted miracle of snap and spring. He ran out of space, smiled, jogged back, as the Bin Ali took the chance to sing his name.\nAnd this is the thing with Messi. Every game is now a kind of Russian roulette. Click the hammer. Is this it? That sense of jeopardy, the fear that this might be the last of Messi on this stage will now move on to the quarter-finals of Qatar 2022.\nHow far can Argentina take him in this thing? Here they held on at times, almost ran away at others. Australia were dogged, dragged the score back to 2-1 and will feel they showed the best of themselves. Argentina have their weaknesses. But they also have a sense of heat about them. They kept to the 4-3-3 from the Poland game here, which may just come to stand as a step change for this team.\n\nAt the last World Cup Argentina were subservient to Messi, a team constructed to serve their sun king, litter-bearers for the princeling in their midst. Messi became almost inert, the still centre of this imperial bureaucracy.\nAs a false 9 in this team he is simply a free agent, with three expert midfield rats behind, runners up front, and in the middle of this the orb, the seer, the floating brain.\nThe Ahmad bin Ali Stadium is a lightweight, fun, fizzy thing dumped down in the overflow carpark of the Mall of Qatar. It looks like a giant wedding cake decoration, or the world\u2019s most imperious pop-up ice rink.\n\nMixing with the Argentinian fans here has been a fascinating contrast. In the middle of all these gleaming surfaces, here is something disorderly and ragged. Argentinian football isn\u2019t just passionate or patriotic. It is devotional. And here the ground was packed with blue and white shirts, laced with those familiar songs, the warm wave of noise.\nAs the game kicked off Messi could be seen swinging his arms, loosening up, as though it had just occurred to him he was about to do some exercise. He walked for a bit. He took up a position miles in front of the rest of his team, the small, slouching, baggy shirted chimney sweep at the top of the tree.\n\nGraham Arnold likes to make the occasion small, to reduce it to simple human possibilities, will, desire, taking the moment. He talks about the \u201cAussie DNA\u201d, a scrap-happy, fight-in-the-dog kind of schtick. Australia did fight here, but Argentina had enough to resist. And they now roll on, three games from the summit.\nAnother striking aspect was the love at the end as Messi led the celebrations, the feeling of the moment being cherished and locked in. It hasn\u2019t always been this way. No other footballer has been so exposed to the glare, so relentlessly seen, analysed, venerated, bathed in light. Another one down. But there may just be a few more spins of the chamber before this thing is done."

                    "body": "John Herdman was leaving the stage when it was announced the player of the match would be next up to face the media. The recipient of Fifa\u2019s award left the Canada head coach stunned. \u201cKevin De Bruyne is player of the match? Wow,\u201d he said. If there was an insult, it was only to Canada.\nThe Belgium playmaker was embarrassed to be singled out for praise after Canada brought everything to their first World Cup appearance for 36 years except a clinical touch. His honesty, and Michy Batshuayi\u2019s ruthless finish, were the only highlights of a worrying night for Roberto Mart\u00ednez\u2019s team. \u201cI don\u2019t think I had a great game. I don\u2019t know why I have the award, maybe it\u2019s the name,\u201d admitted De Bruyne. \u201cWe didn\u2019t play a good game, me included, but the good thing was we found a way to win.\u201d\nMart\u00ednez claimed Belgium deserved victory \u2013 he was in a company of one \u2013 despite conceding a journalist had a point when they asked whether this was his team\u2019s worst performance in a tournament fixture. \u201cIt depends what you mean by worst game,\u201d replied Belgium\u2019s head coach. \u201cTechnically, yes. But worst performance? No. We won, and you don\u2019t win by accident.\u201d Belgium won thanks to Canada\u2019s profligacy, chiefly, and Thibaut Courtois\u2019 commanding goalkeeping.\nCanada had 21 attempts on goal to Belgium\u2019s nine, but only three on target. One of those was an Alphonso Davies penalty and that didn\u2019t find its way past Courtois either. Canada have now gone a record four games without scoring at the World Cup. Their achilles heel stood between a memorable night and an undeserved defeat. \u201cWe showed that we belong here,\u201d said the English-born Herdman. \u201cI\u2019m sure our fans walked away proud that we are a football nation.\u201d\n\nBelgium began the World Cup in a trance. They looked dazed and pedestrian in comparison to an opponent that was a blur of energy and incisive movement in its all-white kit.\nCanada had qualified for a first World Cup since 1986, and only the second in its history, with a fearless approach built on pace and a high press. They made no concessions in style against a team ranked second in the world. Their boldness should have brought tangible reward long before Batshuayi opened the scoring completely against the run of play.\nBut for greater conviction from the penalty spot, and more composure with the final ball or shot, Canada would have established a comfortable lead. They were awarded an early penalty when Tajon Buchanan\u2019s shot struck the outstretched arm of Yannick Carrasco and VAR advised referee Janny Sikazwe to consult the monitor having initially ignored Canada\u2019s appeals.\nSikazwe, the Zambian official who hit the headlines earlier this year when blowing for full time early in an Africa Cup of Nations match between Tunisia and Mali, corrected his decision. The Bayern Munich player\u2019s attempt was weak and comfortably in range for Courtois, who parried low to his right. Davies and Jonathan David made a hash of the rebound too. Herdman said: \u201cIt was a big moment. He was carrying the weight of a nation after 36 years, longer as it would have been our first goal, and that takes a special character.\u201d\n\nDavies, who has pledged to donate all his World Cup earnings to charity, was visibly deflated. Canada were not. They drove forward in numbers and exploited gaps in a creaking Belgium defence where Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen showed their combined age of 68.\nA claim for a second Canadian penalty was missed by the erratic match officials when Eden Hazard played a careless backpass to Buchanan, who was caught by Vertonghen. Buchanan was flagged offside. VAR did look at another penalty appeal when Richie Laryea beat Axel Witsel for pace and was caught on the calf by the chasing midfielder. This time it sided with Sikazwe\u2019s initial decision to award a goal kick.\nCanada captain Atiba Hutchinson, the second oldest outfield player in World Cup history at 39, behind Roger Milla aged 42, sliced wide after an excellent run by Davies. Alistair Johnston forced Courtois into a fine save and David selfishly opted to shoot when Laryea was totally unmarked inside the area. His effort was deflected into the arms of the Real Madrid goalkeeper.\nBelgium hardly threatened until a minute before the break when Canada were undone by a searching ball out of defence from Alderweireld. The pass sent Batshuayi sprinting through a gap between the otherwise impressive Kamal Miller and Laryea and he swept a first time finish beyond Milan Borjan.\nWith Romelu Lukaku expected to miss two games as he recovers from a hamstring injury, Belgium need the former Chelsea forward on clinical form. They also need a vastly improved collective display, although there was an upturn following Amadou Onana\u2019s introduction for the second half. De Bruyne and Alderweireld were seen arguing at one point. \u201cWe were playing too long when we needed to play short-short-short,\u201d said De Bruyne. \u201cWe were not brave enough. But there are no hard feelings with Toby.\u201d\nBuchanan missed a glorious chance to equalise from Laryrea\u2019s cross in first-half stoppage time. Canada pushed for parity throughout the second half but with David heading wide after Stephen Eustaquio had nutmegged De Bruyne and floated over an inviting delivery, and Courtois producing a flying save to deny substitute Cyle Larin, they were punished severely for lacking the ruthlessness of Batshuayi. But Canada have something to build on."

                    "body": "Very few Germans seemed to take much pleasure from their 2-1 defeat against Japan in the opening game of the World Cup. One notable example, however, appeared to be the country\u2019s far-right AFD party, for whom the surprise result \u2013 coupled with the decision to make a protest in support of LGBTQ+ rights before the game \u2013 offered irrefutable proof of the team\u2019s confused priorities.\n\u201cIf you care more about woke armbands than about football, you lose 1:2 against Japan,\u201d tweeted Martin Reichardt, the party\u2019s family policy spokesperson. \u201cDefeat is symbolic of the decline of Germany, where ideology takes precedence over everything!\u201d\nThe party\u2019s deputy leader, Beatrix von Storch, agreed, writing: \u201cI believe that if our team proudly wears the German colours and stops politicising the sport with woken crap, they will win again.\u201d\n\nThe subtext here \u2013 and not a subtle one, all told \u2013 was clear enough. Loyalty to country trumps loyalty to universal values, even over something as unobjectionable as LGBTQ+ rights. Peer a little closer and you can even taste the familiar acrid notes of the globalist betrayal myth gaining ground in many western democracies: a deep-rooted sense of decline, an angst over one\u2019s place in the world, the idea that the qualities that once made you great are being eroded from all directions.\nThese are not new conversations, or even really sporting conversations. But right now football \u2013 and in particular, the German football team \u2013 feels like the conduit through which these debates are being enacted. And so the question of whether Hansi Flick\u2019s side can beat Costa Rica and avoid elimination in the World Cup group phase for the second time in a row is, in many ways, one that goes deeper than football.\nRather it strikes at the very heart of German society itself: a society in the grip of sweeping demographic change and political turbulence, where the old certainties no longer feel as certain, where the old assurance no longer feels as assuring. Who are we? What makes us us? What does the future hold? On a smaller scale, but under the harshest spotlight, and in full view of the world, these are some of the very same questions that Flick is currently trying to address.\n\nTake the lack of a natural striker, an ongoing source of introspection in Germany and one brought into sharper focus in recent years. From Gerd M\u00fcller to Karl-Heinz Rummenigge to J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann to Miroslav Klose; the dominant, masculine No 9 is a central part of the mythology of German football. And so for many, the absence of world-class centre-forwards \u2013 generally believed to be a product of a youth development system that prioritises versatility and technical excellence over specialism \u2013 is emblematic of something deeper; a dilution of German identity, a divergence from tradition.\nBy the same token, the rise of the veteran Niclas F\u00fcllkrug \u2013 the stalwart Werder Bremen striker who was playing second-division football until this season \u2013 has been interpreted as a return to core values. \u201cThe German virtues, which we had been missing a bit lately, are back,\u201d wrote Lothar Matth\u00e4us after F\u00fcllkrug\u2019s emphatic equaliser against Spain on Sunday night.\nPerhaps this feeds into a wider debate about whether, in an age of porous borders and the increasing fluidity of ideas, there remains such a thing as a national footballing identity. And if so, what is Germany\u2019s? \u201cI do believe there are identities,\u201d Flick said on Wednesday. \u201cPerhaps the nuances have changed in recent years. We want to have high intensity, be active and have possession. We want to force the opponent to make mistakes, which means we sometimes press hard. We want to stand for attractive and modern attacking football.\u201d\n\nAll of which sounds great, but perhaps you will note that there is very little new or unique in any of this. None of the above marks Germany out as German. Flick could just as easily have been describing any of the top-16 teams in this tournament. And so: who are we? What makes us, us? For German teams of recent vintage, it came down to mentality. Yet three consecutive soft tournament exits have shattered the image of Turniermannschaft; the well-drilled squad that would win the key battles by simple virtue of being German.\nThis too is bound up in notions of decline, the sense that a new generation lacks the character and hardness of their predecessors. \u201cWith the exception of Manuel Neuer, Thomas M\u00fcller, Leon Goretzka and Joshua Kimmich, they are not as strong in their heads as other footballers used to be,\u201d the respected former coach Winnie Sch\u00e4fer said in a recent interview.\nNor is it simply wizened ex-pros and right-wing politicians questioning the fibre of German football. A widespread disillusionment over the moral dimension of the World Cup \u2013 human rights, commercialisation, climate change \u2013 has engendered an ambivalence to the tournament back home. \u201cThe strength of football used to be that there was a common thread from children\u2019s and youth football to the national team with which one could identify wonderfully,\u201d said the academic Harald Lange in an interview with Tagesspiegel at the weekend. \u201cThis is becoming increasingly difficult for many young people and adults alike.\u201d\nMeanwhile, the unpopularity of the DFB, the national federation, seems to cut across lines of politics and age. Fan groups report that the national team is struggling to engage young supporters, very few of whom have travelled to Qatar. Players like F\u00fcllkrug and Kai Havertz have talked openly here about a perceived lack of support.\nAnd so for Flick there are stark realities to be faced and hard decisions to be made. Does he persist with the team that earned the creditable late draw against Spain? Does he give a first tournament start to F\u00fcllkrug, Germany\u2019s new cult hero? Will he bolster a defence that has looked fragile in their first two games? Does he stick with the midfield triangle of Ilkay G\u00fcndogan, Goretzka and Kimmich? These are, on the face of things, bald footballing questions. And yet on another level there is a sense that Germany is fighting on a far broader front."

                    "body": "And so the two favourites were crowned champions again. It wasn\u2019t the result the partisan local crowd wanted, nor one prominent Hollywood star, but it was the expected result. Sport doesn\u2019t always trade in fairytales, nor cinematic moments, despite the common belief. Most often the best teams with the best players, who are used to winning, win. And that was the tale at the home of Manchester United.  The Kangaroos claimed a hat-trick of consecutive World Cup wins and their 12th Paul Barriere trophy. The Jillaroos notched their own hat-trick with their third world title. In both male and female rugby league, Australia remain the kings, and queens, of the globe. How that changes in the future might be like finding the Holy Grail. The hope is that the emergence of Samoa and Tonga, and the rise of Polynesian talent in the NRL, would bridge the gap between Australia and the rest of the world. While there are now certainly more competitive matches at the top end of international rugby league, and more genuine contenders in the Pacific, Australia still has a stranglehold over ultimate glory in the 13-man code. Under the fading autumn sun it was the women who kicked off proceedings, a repeat of the 2017 World Cup final. In just the fourth minute Jessica Sergis crashed over to score. It was all too easy for the Jillaroos, and was an omen of what was to come. Eleven minutes later Isabelle Kelly touched, before Julia Robinson pounced. At 14-0 ahead with more than 50 minutes left, the match was as good as decided already. Australia tightened the screws and 10 minutes later Kelly powered through for her second of the afternoon, as the score ticked over to 20-0 at half-time.  In the second half the green and gold continued their onslaught, Emma Tonegato stepping her way to the line and then Sergis grabbing her second try, before Tarryn Aiken finished off a sweeping move on the left edge. It was a massacre in Greater Manchester. New Zealand finally managed to break through with 16 minutes left, thanks to Madison Bartlett, but it was too little too late. There was still time for Kennedy Cherrington to get on the scoresheet twice in just three minutes, and for Evania Pelite to cross to emphatically finish their neighbours off. Then it was time for the men to shine, and an eerily similar script unfolded. Samoa started strongly and showed early they would not die wondering. However, with the crowd booing them at every turn though, it was the green and gold who unsurprisingly struck first. Latrell Mitchell\u2019s Mal Meninga impersonation saw him steamroll his way past two defenders. It was remarkably easy and four minutes later they were in again. Josh Addo-Carr exploited a lazy defensive line and went straight through the middle, finding James Tedesco in support for the try. At 10-0 ahead after just 18 minutes and you could smell, to borrow a Dwayne Johnson line, what was cooking. There was no lack of work-rate or effort from Toa Samoa, but they were being taught a lesson in rugby league perfection. Desperate defence then stopped Addo-Carr from scoring, while Mitchell was prevented from a second with a double movement. In the 27th minute Australia had to do some defending of their own, holding up Chanel Harris-Tavita over the line. The green and gold then marched them down the field and Liam Martin barged over on the right wing. It remained only 14-0 at half-time, thanks to Nathan Cleary\u2019s poor goal-kicking, giving the Pacific nation some hope. In the second half a further chance was offered when Angus Crichton was sin-binned in the 46th minute, for an elbow to the head of Harris-Tevita.  Samoa had 10 minutes to make Australia pay. But gritty tackling and poor execution hampered them. When it mattered most, the brave Samoans felt short. To add insult to injury, with just 12 men on the field the Kangaroos scored again, this time through Cam Murray. Samoa wouldn\u2019t give up the fight though, and with 20 minutes left they had their reward when Brian To\u2019o dived over in the corner. But the Aussies, with glory within their grasp, weren\u2019t going to let this slip. In the 67th minute Cam Munster spun the ball inside and Tedesco had his brace. With the clock winding down Stephen Crichton intercepted a pass to score, and the crowd erupted, though it was a mere consolation, with Mitchell\u2019s second try the icing on the Antipodean cake. Australia might have slipped at cricket. The Wallabies might have suffered an embarrassing loss to Italy, and the Socceroos might be headed for a tough time in Qatar. But once again the Kangaroos and Jillaroos have salvaged the nation\u2019s pride and brought home the bacon."

                    "body": "The flashpoints had been well signposted. When Serbia and Switzerland met in Kaliningrad at Russia 2018 it was clear from the outset that nobody would be fading out quietly. Xherdan Shaqiri\u2019s decision to recognise the land of his birth with a Kosovo flag stitched into the heel of his right boot had warmed a tinderbox that was already well stocked and, when Granit Xhaka celebrated his thudding equaliser by forming an Albanian eagle with his hands, tensions ignited.\nBoth players repeated the gesture when Shaqiri scored a dramatic late winner that ultimately ensured their side were the ones who reached the last 16; the recriminations were long, loud and ended with Fifa issuing several fines.\nGiven the teams meet again on Friday with the stakes even higher, it is tempting to wonder just how busy the disciplinary chiefs may find themselves over the weekend. Last time out there remained one group stage game for fates to be confirmed: at Stadium 974 there will be no such leeway and whoever masters the occasion will take it all. Serbia must win and hope Brazil do not down tools against Cameroon; a point will suffice for Switzerland unless Rigobert Song\u2019s players contrive a shock.\n\nFour years ago, hostilities had been publicly stoked, Aleksandar Mitrovic among those to question Shaqiri\u2019s choice of footwear. Serbia refuses to recognise Kosovo as an independent state and encounters with Shaqiri and Xhaka, who both signed a petition to Fifa 10 years ago pledging support for what became the official Kosovan national team, are imbued with added significance on both sides.\nYet much of the buildup to their latest showdown has resembled a convention of the saints. It was clear on Tuesday, when Sergej Milinkovic-Savic and Dusan Tadic took questions at Serbia\u2019s Al Arabi training base, that nobody was of a mind to dangle bait.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt it was big pressure four years ago but we need to focus on football and show we can play better than them,\u201d Tadic said when asked how Serbia would handle the occasion this time. His teammate matched the answer virtually word for word. Neither player expected emotions to run high: the priority was simply to look at themselves.\n\nMitrovic struck a similar note, saying: \u201cIt was a different game, we\u2019re not thinking about what happened before.\u201d\nThe problem is that the wider context tends to lurk beneath the surface and undermine any well-scripted words. Serbia are under Fifa investigation for displaying a flag showing Kosovo as part of their country, along with the words \u201cWe do not surrender\u201d, in their dressing room before their opening game against Brazil.\nThat did not go unnoticed in Kosovo, whose minister of culture, youth and sport, Hajrulla Ceku, described the image as \u201chateful, xenophobic and genocidal\u201d. Kosovo\u2019s football association called it an \u201caggressive action\u201d. Scars from the horrifying war between local forces and modern-day Serbia, fought in the 1990s, will never fully heal.\n\nPerhaps that is why Serbia, whose rap sheet with the governing bodies is lengthy, have been so intent on message discipline this week. After the match in 2018 their FA was fined \u00a341,000 on account of discriminatory banners and messages from their fans. Their coach at the time, Mladen Krstajic, and then-FA head Slavisa Kokeza also took hits to the wallet for their conduct\nXhaka and Shaqiri received \u00a37,600 fines for their celebrations; the Albanian prime minister, Edi Rama, lent his backing to a \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid of the eagle\u201d crowdfunding initiative that raised enough money to pay them off almost immediately. Two months later, Xhaka, the son of emigrants from Kosovo, promised such a flashpoint \u201cwill never happen again\u201d. In some quarters of Switzerland he and Shaqiri were looked upon dimly for focusing their attentions on Kosovo after scoring.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing in the history behind these two games,\u201d Xhaka said this week, echoing his counterparts\u2019 tone. \u201cWe are Switzerland, they are Serbia and that\u2019s it. We\u2019re here to play football, as are they.\u201d\nAs long as that remains a priority, the rewards could be lavish. Switzerland have performed modestly but have grown as an attacking proposition since the last World Cup. Serbia are among the most creative, bewitching sides in the competition. There is pressure on the coach, Dragan Stojkovic, to give Dusan Vlahovic his first start of Qatar 2022 and form a potentially lethal pairing with Mitrovic.\n\u201cWe\u2019re happy to focus on football tomorrow and respect each other,\u201d said the Switzerland manager, Murat Yakin, adding his voice to the entente. It remains to be seen whether any simmering enmity takes on a life of its own once again."

For those who fell just short in the 2017 tournament the wait has not always been easy. \u201cThe World Cup is something I\u2019ve craved for so long now,\u201d says Zoe Aldcroft, the England lock who was named World Rugby\u2019s player of the year 12 months ago. \u201cEverything I\u2019ve done has been working towards this competition.\u201d\nHence the coiled spring vibe around the England camp before their semi-final against Canada on Saturday. Having to stay in the same city centre hotel as their opponents this week has, if anything, intensified their focus. When there is every chance of bumping into your opposite number in the lift it makes it harder still to switch off and think about something other than rugby.\n\nEngland, though, have long since shrugged aside the agonies of self-doubt. As they set out in search of their 30th successive victory, even that impressive winning streak has ceased to matter much to them. All that counts is completing a job that has become an obsession since they were beaten 41-32 by New Zealand in Belfast five years ago.\nAldcroft is among a dozen English survivors from that squad and the no-nonsense attitude of England\u2019s pack has summed up the Red Roses\u2019 collective mindset. Not that the 25-year-old is ever one to sidestep the hard yards. \u201cShe\u2019d run through a brick wall for the team,\u201d says Louis Deacon, the forwards coach. \u201cShe\u2019s quiet but incredibly committed to anything she does.

As Galligan puts it: \u201cWhen she gets on the pitch she goes from being a smiley, really lovely person to a bit of a demon.\u201d\n\nEven Aldcroft freely acknowledges she can sometimes struggle to control her competitive instincts. \u201cI think it is a red mist,\u201d she says. \u201cIt comes over me all of a sudden. I\u2019m like \u2018Oh my God, I need to rein this in.\u2019 I just hate losing. As soon as it\u2019s a competition I\u2019m like \u2018Right, I\u2019ve got to win.\u2019 I am pretty competitive.\u201d\nMuch of it stems from a childhood determination to keep up with her brother Jonny \u2013 \u201cHe was always that little bit better and I wanted to be better than him\u201d \u2013 having taken up rugby as a nine-year-old at Scarborough. Aged 12, however, she was no longer able to continue training with the boys and at 16 she headed south to attend Hartpury College near Gloucester. Subsequently, she graduated from the University of Northumbria with a degree in sports and exercise science and earned her first senior cap in 2016.\nThis will be her 37th Test appearance but, remarkably, she has ended up on the losing side once. That sole blemish, against New Zealand in 2019, was also the last time England lost although Canada, the only amateur side left in the last four, will not be a complete pushover.\n\nTheir forward-based, 7-1 bench split is a clear sign of their intentions and in some ways the Red Roses will be gazing at their own mirror image. \u201cWe can see the resemblance,\u201d says Aldcroft. \u201cThey have a dominant set-piece and their lineout and scrum are a very big strength of theirs. It\u2019s just about us being on top of our game.\u201d\nEven without Dua Lipa performing in Auckland this week, it is going to get physical. The other semi-final will involve more of a contrast in styles, with France\u2019s stout defence up against New Zealand\u2019s tasty attack, but England\u2019s head coach, Simon Middleton, reckons the Black Ferns overwhelming preference for expansive rugby over rolling mauls could yet prove an achilles heel. \u201cNew Zealand have got a bigger problem because they can only score with their backs but nobody is making a fuss about that,\u201d he says.\nIn their heart of hearts, nevertheless, the Red Roses would relish a high-profile final against the tournament hosts. \u201cTo play the Black Ferns at Eden Park in a World Cup final when they\u2019re the holders \u2026 if you can tick that box you\u2019ve pretty much ticked everything as a player and a member of the management staff,\u201d says Middleton.\n\u201cIf that happens we\u2019ll get an opportunity to realise our ultimate potential. [But] we\u2019ve got to get there and Canada are formidable opponents.\u201d\n\nAldcroft is reciting from a very similar script \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019re definitely keeping our feet on the ground, we know it\u2019s going to be a really hard game\u201d \u2013 as she prepares to go again alongside fellow lineout specialist Abbie Ward in England\u2019s second row. While she still has a softer side \u2013 a knitted Jonny Wilkinson doll still has its regular place in her matchday kitbag while her desert island luxury would be her sponge bag \u2013 there is no masking her steely determination to advance. \u201cIt\u2019s important we keep to our gameplan, play our structure and don\u2019t get too ahead of ourselves.\n\u201cWe can feel all the teams really coming after us in the first parts of games. I definitely think we have a bit of a target on us but it\u2019s something we have expected.\u201d\nStill burning away inside is that pent-up motivation still fuelling all those involved in 2017. Aldcroft has not come all the way out to New Zealand to watch history repeat itself. \u201cThe last World Cup didn\u2019t go to plan. It\u2019s just made me more hungry and made me want this one even more.\u201d"

                    "body": "Three months ago Split hosted a different kind of World Cup. The game was football \u2013 well, sort of \u2013 but the matches were played on a bit of concrete squeezed between the seafront and the Zvoncac swimming pool that is home to Jadran, the 1992 and 1993 European water polo champions.\nThe ball was oddly small, the goals completely disproportionate, as if put on their side with tall posts and a short crossbar. And in the middle of the pitch, there was a full-width step, about four inches high. Hence the name of the tournament: Prvenstvo svita u balunu na skalini \u2013 the Football On a Step World Cup. The ground itself is called Skalina \u2013 the Step.\nIn the summer heat, three-a-side teams run, dribble, pass and shoot, cheered by a crowd of spectators mainly in their swimming gear, while at the same time having to watch out for the step. \u201cThis is our ground, our rules,\u201d laughs one participant, claiming the \u201cworld\u201d title is justified. \u201cLet anyone come here and play if they think they can challenge us.\u201d\n\nSome have tried and regretted it with the dreaded step claiming many casualties over the years. But the locals wouldn\u2019t want it any other way. In fact, once the step was flattened and the pitch made even but the locals complained so much it was reinstated. \u201cThe players staggered around and stumbled around, looking back in confusion to where it used to be,\u201d says Boris Dezulovic, who wrote about it in his book, Bili libar. The step was back to stay.\nIn this surreal setting Marko Livaja\u2019s football career was born. And then reborn. Dezulovic describes him as being a \u201chairbrained hooligan\u201d when he started to make a name for himself as an impossibly talented but hot-headed youngster. At 16, he was the top scorer of the Cetiri kafica (Four Caf\u00e9s) indoor tournament, which is a big a deal in Split; his team lost the final, played in front of 10,000 people, but he outshone stars such as Ivan Perisic and Ivan Rakitic as well as some big-name veterans. \u201cMy boyhood dream came true,\u201d the young Livaja said. \u201cI played alongside legends like Davor Suker, whom I had only seen on television before.\u201d\n\nLater that season, he was poached by Inter and left Hajduk, his childhood club, without making a senior appearance, starting an odyssey that saw him play in Switzerland, Italy, Russia, Spain and Greece. Things did not go according to plan and he fell out with coaches and teammates, behaved erratically and acquired a reputation of being a troublemaker.\nIn the summers he would return to Split and play three-a-side games at Skalina or five- and six-a-side games on other pitches. His employers did not know. He never settled anywhere, not even at AEK Athens, where he won the league in 2018 and the Player of the Season award two years later. It wasn\u2019t for him as he refused to sign a contract extension and, after being deemed surplus to requirements, was released in February 2021.\nRumours of a possible Hajduk return had started the previous summer when one of the Skalina players had said Livaja was considering it. And as soon as he was out of contract he was announced as a new Hajduk signing. The expectations were high, and understandably so, but no one could have foreseen the impact it would have on Hajduk as a club and its community.\nLivaja initially signed a short-term deal and started slowly but towards the end of the 2020-21 season he was scoring a goal a game. That summer the fans launched a huge campaign trying to persuade him to stay: firemen, shipbuilders, schoolchildren, bus drivers all took part as well as fans from around the world. In the end there was no doubt: Hajduk released a video showing campaign photos and a simple message, written on a piece of paper in permanent marker: Livaja stays.\n\nThe following campaign he netted 32 goals in 40 games for Hajduk in all competitions and the fans, who already loved him, could not believe their luck. \u201cNo offer can take me away,\u201d he said after winning the Croatian cup last season, as tens of thousands of fans invaded the pitch. \u201cI never went for money and being here, at home, is what\u2019s important to me. I enjoy it every day.\u201d\nHe even has his own song now, written by Disconnect, a local rap group, with the lyrics: \u201cGetting the goals, Marko Livaja / Killer balls, Marko Livaja / Three points here, Marko Livaja / I\u2019m strong in the head, like Marko Livaja / Got under everyone\u2019s skin / Let anyone come, I\u2019m never bad / The stands implore me, they call me God.\u201d\nAll in all he has 50 goals in 78 appearances since rejoining as well as registering 23 assists. Hajduk have not won the league for 17 years but the momentum is with them. They are improving and growing as a club: they have 90,000 paying club members and Livaja, now 29, is their superhero. At times the striker has seemingly carried the team by himself with a whole range of moves and tricks that are normally only seen in playgrounds. And that is no coincidence, of course.\n\nHajduk knew of Livaja\u2019s passion and let him carry on with it. He can still be seen playing football at various pitches around Split, even during the season. He simply loves football and was once seen making a quick exit having featured for only 20 minutes in a pre-season friendly. \u201cThat was a nice warm-up,\u201d he told a journalist as he made his way to a kickabout with friends.\nThis season he even played for Hajduk despite receiving a phone call to say that that his father had died in a traffic accident. The club arranged for someone to take him home but he demanded to play. He always wants to play; he needs to play.\nFor Croatia he seemed a certain starter for their World Cup opener against Morocco on Wednesday until he picked up a knock in the last league game before the tournament. He may now start on the bench but should come on at some stage, he is the most complete forward in the squad.\nBack home at the Skalina, where a large painting of Livaja now adorns the wall next to the pitch, they will be cheering his every move and counting the days until he is back with them again."

                    "body": "Welcome to the World Cup, Mason Mount. No, not the field of play but the post-match mixed zone, where the players have to file past representatives of the global media \u2013 a sometimes confusing realm where it is wise to expect the unexpected.\nThe Chelsea midfielder\u2019s introduction came shortly after he had played his part in England\u2019s stirring 6-2 win over Iran. \u201cI\u2019m from Portugal,\u201d his questioner began. \u201cI\u2019d like to ask you what you think about the rumours regarding Chelsea and Cristiano Ronaldo?\u201d\nMount\u2019s face was a picture. Incredulity barely covered it. For the first time all day the 23-year-old did not know what to do, although it was not too long before he recovered his composure.\n\n\u201cListen, I\u2019m away with England so that\u2019s all I\u2019m focusing on,\u201d Mount said. \u201cI\u2019ve just played my first World Cup game. And the experience I\u2019ve just had is something that I dreamed of as a kid.\u201d\nIt was a day when almost everything was picture perfect for Mount, one he will always remember, and it was impossible not to feel his exuberance, the sense of wonder. This is a player who has won the Champions League but from the way he talked it was plain that he saw the World Cup as the pinnacle.\n\nThe way Mount played was as an enabler for Gareth Southgate\u2019s system; leading the counter-press without the ball, sniffing out spaces between the lines when England had it. Southgate\u2019s team were 4-2-3-1 out of possession, Mount pushing up in the No 10 role, and 4-3-3 with it. That was when Mount became the left-sided No 8, Jude Bellingham in the corresponding role on the right and Declan Rice as the defensive midfielder.\n\nThe successful bonus about Southgate\u2019s approach was the presence of an additional midfield runner in Bellingham. The 19-year-old was outstanding, bringing energy and incision. Mount also carried the ball to good effect, taking players on, drawing Iranian tackles and, quite often, fouls. His passing was sharp.\nIt was Mount\u2019s awareness that made the difference. With Bellingham wanting to bomb forward and Harry Kane to drop back from his No 9 position to pick those passes and crosses, Mount had to find the pockets around them, to knit things together.\n\u201cOff the ball I was a bit higher to press and to have four up there to press,\u201d Mount said. \u201cThen on the ball \u2026 drifting to the left a bit more and Jude was a bit higher on the right with Dec [Rice] in the middle.\n\n\u201cIt was just trying to find that space behind their midfield because we knew they would jump and try to press our back four. We dealt with that really well. The rotations with our wingers and the full-backs, with \u2018H\u2019 [Kane] up top when he drops in and everyone is in behind creating chances \u2026 it was such an enjoyable game. I loved every minute of it.\u201d\nEngland\u2019s superiority was rooted in their dominance of the ball \u2013 72% possession; 809 passes to Iran\u2019s 224, 730 of which were completed. Southgate felt that the centre-halves, Harry Maguire and John Stones, provided the platform for England to get on the front foot and make runs in behind. They set the starting positions and their distribution was sound.\nStones had a 99% pass completion rate and Maguire stepped up with the ball at his feet to good effect, at times. It was Maguire\u2019s pass through the lines that led to the opening goal, headed in by Bellingham after Luke Shaw\u2019s cross from the left.\nMaguire\u2019s blot came when the Iran substitute Ali Gholizadeh slipped a pass in behind him for Mehdi Taremi to make it 4-1, and Stones gave away the late penalty for 6-2 after tugging at Taremi\u2019s shirt for a split-second. The concessions visibly incensed the goalkeeper, Jordan Pickford, and led to a lecture from Southgate about focus.\nMount said: \u201cThe way we started the game on that high press and the way we played with the ball really set the tone. How we moved with the ball and the combinations that we played with is something we worked on during the previous five days we were here.\n\u201cBut you see things about us needing to be more attacking \u2026 in the major tournaments you cannot afford to concede goals. That is when, going further, you start losing games. So you have to focus on that. That is what we have been doing as well. How defensively solid we can be.\u201d\n\nMount did not want to talk about making any kind of statement to the rest of the tournament with the win; rather to turn the focus inwards. On a personal level, his season at Chelsea began slowly before his form spiked and then ebbed again. England, meanwhile, had laboured under the cloud of their dismal Nations League campaign. They are back on the up.\n\u201cThe previous six games [in the Nations League] \u2026 we didn\u2019t have a win and so going into the Iran game, you can have that thought in your head that we need to get an early goal or else it could be a difficult one and a sticky one,\u201d Mount said. \u201cBut the way that we trained and the desire to go out there and perform was top-class from all the boys.\u201d"
