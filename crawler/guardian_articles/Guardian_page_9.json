                    "body": "For Lionel Messi\u2019s Argentina this is the eve of a World Cup final that has been a long time coming. As the bumpy yet steadily improved road to glory unfolds, the inevitable comparisons with the late Diego Maradona get ever stronger. Like some phantom standard that Messi is supposed to reach, the pinnacle of triumphalism on lifting the trophy, the shadow cast by Maradona looms ever larger.\nOn Argentinian radio, as in south-east Asian reports, European media and the USA, the comparison between the two players is being underscored, feeding the idea that somehow Messi has to become \u201cmore Maradona\u201d if the feat of winning this tournament is to be finally achieved.\n\u201cCould we say that what is in fact happening, socio-cosmically speaking, is that we\u2019re moving from the comparison between the two to the fusion/incarnation of one with the other?\u201d Sergio Chodos, an avid Argentinian observer of both men, wonders.\n\nThe consensus, after the bitter quarter-final battle against the Netherlands, was that Messi was indeed becoming \u201cMaradonised\u201d \u2013 comments such as \u201che\u2019s found his inner Diego\u201d or \u201che\u2019s been possessed by Maradona\u201d were commonplace in the Argentinian and international press alike. This perception was triggered by a series of seemingly out-of-character reactions by Messi during and after that match. He lashed out at the referee, lost his cool and insulted the Dutch striker Wout Weghorst during his post-match interview: \u201cWhat you looking at silly? Go away.\u201d\nMy view is that Messi is very much not becoming Maradona; what we are seeing is Messi becoming himself. More and more comfortable in his own skin, more assertive in his own unique personality, more comfortable in his own style of leadership.\nI first met him in 2009, a one-to-one interview for a Unicef book about players and their childhoods. Messi was polite, reserved, and only livened up after a number of questions. Noticeably, when talking about what a sore loser he is \u2013 he hates losing at everything, card games, dice. Anything. Back then he told me that for a long time when he was a young boy he didn\u2019t realise how good he was at football, because he secretly suspected his older brothers and their mates purposely let him win \u2013 to avoid his tantrums if he lost.\n\nThis opinion is reinforced by testimony from his current teammates aired in an inside the Copa Am\u00e9rica Netflix documentary, an intimate series with unique access, in which the Argentina players reveal, among other gems, a certain fear they all share of making Messi angry.\nSo his displays of anger and frustration are not new. His \u201coutburst\u201d against the Netherlands, the players and manager, is not only not Maradona-like in character but also very much in keeping with the real Messi.\nEven his choice of insult is endearingly childish: \u201cGo away, silly.\u201d Who says that? The Spanish word he used, bobo, is almost out of use. The kind of expression that might be used by a character in a novel by the 20th-century Argentinian absurdist Roberto Arlt, or by a granny out in the farm: \u201cYou\u2019ve spilt your soup, bobo.\u201d It\u2019s such a uniquely weird outburst that it has been immediately lapped up as a Messi trademark. Tattoos, T-shirts, even a wine, and mixes to dub and cumbia music have gone viral.\nMaradona would have been more brutal \u2013 perhaps inventing a new insult specifically for Weghorst; certainly utilising expletives and profanities with more bite. Messi retains a childlike innocence in his use of language, which is always simple and basic, and quite a contrast from Maradona\u2019s inventiveness.\n\nAfter worldwide speculation that Messi and his teammates\u2019 antics at the end of the Netherlands match were reminiscent of more stereotypical views of Argentina from past behaviours at international encounters, the Scaloneta \u2013 that is the national manager Lionel Scaloni and his advisers Walter Samuel and Pablo Aimar\u2013 as well as Messi himself, were quick to rein in any suggestion of accusatory or angry speech that went too far.\n\nArgentina\u2019s next match, the semi-final against Croatia, was a stark contrast, both on the pitch and in the reactions afterwards. A comfortable win, followed by a marked playing down of the inflammatory reactions from the quarter-final. \u201cAt times like these everything gets magnified,\u201d Scaloni said when asked about the incidents after the Netherlands game. \u201cWe feel it\u2019s important to write nothing, say nothing, and make sure nothing gets amplified.\u201d\nMessi echoed his manager\u2019s sentiment with mature remarks about \u201cthe heat of the moment\u201d and let it be understood there were no grudges. A very constrained response to reporters eager to build up a story of confrontation. Maradona used to thrive on confrontation. Argentina\u2019s sporting icon needed to be fighting a solo battle against adversity: it was forever him against the world. On the field, his teammates would look to get the ball to Maradona and let him resolve the match single-handed.\nMessi is very different. He needs a system that works, a well-oiled machine in which he can know where everyone around him is going to be and in what direction they will be moving. In this way, he can manage the ball, and can sense where the others are in order to be able to execute his ideas to perfection.\nA great example of the Messianic essence of Messi seen in his creative playmaking and astonishing ability to execute a plan was his pass to Nahuel Molina in the quarter-final. A perfect illustration of Messi\u2019s talent at his best. Can he see where Molina is going to be before Molina gets there? Or can he actually see Molina? If so, how? His head is down, his eyes on the ball and on the Dutch players immediately surrounding him. The precise moment when he decides what\u2019s going to happen, and the pass to its exact place, can be watched over and over on an endless stream of clips. For this to have been performed so perfectly, he needs to operate in conjunction with the rest of the team. He cannot do it alone.\nAnd this is the main difference between Messi and Maradona. Maradona, good team player though he was, carried the weight for everyone. The plan was get the ball to him and Maradona would sort it out.\nMessi cannot carry the weight for others \u2013 he needs to be part of a bigger unit. He needs Molina to \u201ctransmit\u201d to him where he will be \u2013 so, not necessary to actually \u201csee\u201d Molina, but rather to \u201cknow\u201d what his teammate is going to do.\nAgainst Croatia, Messi delighted us yet again with this apparently sensory ability to preempt where Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez would be ready to receive his pass for Argentina\u2019s third. The added gambeta \u2013 dribbling, skilful feigns and dummies during which he played contentedly with the ball despite Croatia\u2019s pointless efforts to dissuade him \u2013 are the signature not just of Messi himself but of the style and tradition of the aspects of Argentinian football that fans have grown to love.\nMatch by match at this World Cup, we have seen Messi growing into himself. He is finding comfort in being who he is among a group who understand him, and unlike the more taciturn Messi of the past, who maybe felt the need to constrain his true essence (maybe because it is difficult to understand, because it diverges enough from what we expect people to be like), he is now more assertive in showing his true self.\n\nThe temptation to think he is becoming more like Maradona must be resisted. The weight and burden of filling those shoes has been more of a hindrance than an inspiration for Messi. This character that he is presenting now is freer; it is like the liberation of Messi. The national anthem (which he was criticised for not singing for many years) opens with the words: \u201cListen, mortals, it\u2019s the sound of breaking chains.\u201d\nMessi is like a son who grows healthily and he is now marking the limits and boundaries, imposing a separation from Maradona. With calm maturity he always nods in the direction of the Great Diego, but distancing himself at the same time. By saying: \u201cDiego is watching over us,\u201d or: \u201cLet\u2019s do this for Diego,\u201d he defers to Argentina\u2019s football deity while at the same time naming him as an other, and so remaining very much his own man. Naming Maradona is a way of distancing himself from him.\n\nThe reaction to perceived injustice may be different but both Messi and Maradona do it. In this sense they are leaders and captains and arguably it is less important that they react in different ways, and more telling that when facing such a situation \u201cthey react publicly\u201d \u2013 each in their own way, but both react. That\u2019s the identity.\nReacting is a tradition that links him to Diego; a fair measure of belonging and identity links Messi to Maradona. The relationship of belonging is a thread that unites them very closely. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for a patriarch to find himself and be comfortable in a pantheon, but when it happens it\u2019s luminary,\u201d says Chodos. \u201cMessi is now comfortable in the Olympus next to, but different from, Diego.\u201d\nArgentina\u2019s road to the final has been turbulent, but each match has shown incremental improvements on the previous game\u2019s weakest link. The weakest link in the quarter-final was behavioural. The semi-final was close to perfection. Add to this a frenzy of praise that can see no wrong in the squad, among the press, the crowds back home, and the inordinate number of Argentina fans the world over that have become more visible than ever during this World Cup, and the biggest danger the finalists face now is not having an easily identifiable weak spot to correct.\nEmerging from the tunnel feeling unbeatable is the mistake Argentina made against Saudi Arabia in their first match in Qatar. It is also a mistake Maradona would have been prone to: thinking he is the absolute best in the world, roaring to take on anyone willing to suggest otherwise.\nArgentina\u2019s hope must be that this newfound confidence Lionel Messi has in presenting his true self doesn\u2019t get blurred into some national fantasy about divine football qualities; that his earthly, calm, emotionally mature true self can focus on his artistic beauty, and that the team are able to transmit to him which direction their movements will take them.\nAs Victor Hugo Morales\u2019s commentary of the setup for \u00c1lvarez\u2019s second goal against Croatia so aptly described: \u201cServant of the art of football. With a single gesture able to display the entire beauty of the sport. Eternal Aladdin of football, infinite left. Extraordinary!\u201d\nJust one more moment of such magic and Messi can bow out of the global stage with all the laurels and dignity, take his place in football\u2019s Olympus, and delight us all. Not fused with Maradona, but his own true exponent of the beauty and power of the game."

                    "body": "\nMain event\nAfter the celebration of countries from the Asian, African and Concacaf regions making it to the knockout stages, Morocco offer the final hope of a country from outside Europe and South America reaching the quarter finals. USA, Australia, Senegal, Japan and South Korea have already had their exit visas stamped at airport security, leaving Walid Regragui\u2019s side as the last ones standing.\nThe talk of a global shift in the game has been replaced by discussions about how good Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 is and if football is coming home. Today could be the day we get a shock; Morocco and Switzerland will be eager to be the ones to carry them out. Currently the quarter-finals contain six of the best teams on the planet, and where is the fun in that?\n\nFew could have predicted Morocco finishing top of their group and Spain coming second to create such a last-16 tie. Inspired by Hakim Ziyech\u2019s return to the national team, Morocco came through the opening three matches unbeaten. Although the Chelsea winger is grabbing headlines with his performances, it should not go unnoticed that they conceded a solitary goal in fixtures against Croatia, Belgium and Canada.\nMorocco have not won a knockout stage game in their previous five World Cups and this is only the second time they have reached the final 16. On that occasion - after another unbeaten group stage in which they only conceded once - they faced West Germany and went down 1-0 in Mexico. On Tuesday they face another of the world\u2019s elite in Spain, and a slender defeat would look like an impressive result to outsiders but Morocco will be optimistic of winning. They have four players that ply their trade in La Liga, something that could aid the underdogs.\nOpponents Spain laid down a marker in their opening fixture of the tournament by thrashing Costa Rica 7-0, before limping through the next two groups games. A 1-1 draw with Germany did nothing for their reputation and the less said about losing to Japan, the better. At one stage during the final group match, Spain were heading out with Germany but they just scraped through in the end. The most recent two results should be a wake up call for Luis Enrique and his overly-relaxed charges. Unai Sim\u00f3n was culpable for Japan\u2019s opener and his place could be under threat for the match and bringing in Brighton\u2019s Robert S\u00e1nchez or Brentford\u2019s David Raya would be a bold call at this critical stage. \nPortugal and Switzerland progressed out of their groups with six points. The former, however, came top and will be favourites to advance to the quarters in the late kick-off thanks to their array of talent. The clubless Cristiano Ronaldo has underwhelmed thus far but felt the need to stomp off when substituted during the loss to South Korea. His former Manchester United teammate Bruno Fernandes is more integral to his country than the fading powers of a once great No 7 but the potential of one final crack at winning a World Cup might roll back the years for Ronaldo in the latter stages.\n\nThe Swiss finished behind Brazil in their group, giving the South Americans a tough time in their clash, which Tite\u2019s side won 2-0. They will be hoping to do better against another Lusophone nation. If they do defeat Portugal, it would be Switzerland\u2019s first quarter-final since 1954 when they lost an entertaining encounter 7-5 to Austria in a tournament they were hosting. In their past three last-16 ties they have lost 1-0 to Sweden, in extra-time against Argentina and on penalties to Ukraine. They know how to come close to being in the final eight but never get over the line.\nNeither Spain nor Portugal would like to see a shock today. For the neutral, however, it would be great for the tournament, but anything that is good for football is unlikely to happen in a competition organised by Fifa. Hopefully, this will be a great day for the fans, rather than the suits.\nTalking points\nExperience drags Croatia through to last eightCroatia\u2019s starting XI was the oldest in a World Cup knockout stage since 1998, coming in at an average age of 29 years and 330 days. Positives and negatives arise from having veteran status. It was obvious in the first half how tired their players were, unable to compete with the thrust of Japan on the break and looking unlikely to break down such a well-disciplined team. In the second half of the 90 minutes, however, the experience kicked in. Croatia has a collection of players who were in Russia four years ago when they won two penalty shootouts in the knockout stages, not to mention an extra-time victory over England. In addition to Luka Modric, Ivan Perisic and Mateo Kovacic on the pitch, the likes of Mario Mandzukic, Vedran Corluka and Ivica Olic are on the coaching staff. You cannot buy players in international football but there are few within this cohort that Croatia would be willing to sell. WU\n\nStrictly winning top of the agenda for BrazilTeams very rarely win trophies purely based on individual quality, and no one can deny how much Brazil possess. Instead, success is created by a mixture of talent, hard work and camaraderie. Brazil were scintillating against South Korea, summarised by Richarlison scoring the third, the best team goal of the tournament by a distance. Upon slotting home, the team celebrated as a group, including the substitutes and even coach Tite, who joined in with the rhythmical dancing on the touchline. For the second, Neymar sprinted to the injured Alex Telles in the stands. Everyone is involved in Brazil\u2019s progress thus far in the competition and that team ethic should help take them further. It is not a crime to enjoy doing your job and it is not surprising that the Brazilians in Qatar are loving their work at the moment. WU\nBeyond the football\nArs\u00e8ne Wenger is no stranger to criticism. In his last few dispiriting years as Arsenal manager he came in for plenty of flak from fans and pundits alike. He\u2019s back in the firing line again for using his role as chairman of the Fifa technical advisory board to claim that some teams failed in the World Cup group stages because they focused too much \u201con political demonstrations\u201d. He is ostensibly paid by Fifa to use his football expertise to pick apart the tactical and technical reasons for why teams have done well or not. By bringing politics into his critique of nations who spoke out in support of human rights it appears to be a clear attempt to please his employers as well as Qatar\u2019s Supreme Committee. It\u2019s also very depressing. While he continues to be paid by Fifa perhaps it is Ars\u00e8ne, and not the teams, who should stick to football. GB\nGlobal media-watch\nIn Portugal\u2019s media the CR7 show is never far away. In Jornal de Not\u00edcias there is still some debate whether Ronaldo\u2019s angry words as he left the field having been substituted on Friday \u2013 \u201cYou\u2019re in a big fucking hurry for me to leave\u201d \u2013 were directed at a South Korean player trying to jockey him off the field faster, or his own coach. \u201cI saw the interaction with the Korean player and I have no doubts about what happened,\u201d national boss Fernando Santos said. Well, given he\u2019s rather relying on Ronaldo turning up to play, he would, wouldn\u2019t he?\nIn P\u00fablico, they are lamenting that the brilliant scoring record of Ronaldo for the national team is yet to extend to the sharp end of World Cups, saying: \u201cWith 118 goals scored for Portugal, only eight were achieved in the greatest football competition in the world. None of them in the knockout stage.\u201d They contrast this with his contributions at the Euros, where he has scored vital goals in knockout games in three separate editions. O Jogo, meanwhile, is fretting over an omen in the appointment of Tuesday\u2019s referee for the clash with Switzerland. \u201cC\u00e9sar Ramos refereed a Portugal game that doesn\u2019t bring back good memories. At the 2018 World Cup in Russia, also in the round of 16, the Portuguese team was eliminated 2-1 by Uruguay, and the match was refereed by the Mexican.\u201d MB\nThe internet reacts\nYou can\u2019t make do with just a psychic octopus these days. Ahead of Japan\u2019s epic last 16 clash with Croatia the internet was going wild for a range of cute animals predicting a Japanese victory, which would have taken them to the World Cup quarter-finals for the first ever time. Lilo the otter at Marine World Uminonakamichi pulled a red frisbee indicating an impending Japanese win, and gave his trainers a little high five into the bargain.\n\nKurizo \u2013 half-dog, half-teddy bear \u2013 also predicted a win for the Samurai Blue.\n\nEven an unnamed Tanuki \u2013 a Japanese raccoon dog \u2013 on night vision camera managed to pick the Japan flag, despite not really appearing to know it was being tested.\n\nIt was all to no avail. And spare a thought for Japan\u2019s Ambassador to Croatia, Iso Masato, who found himself at Zagreb zoo for a publicity shoot on Monday morning to watch Kent the Gibbon correctly predict that Croatia were going to win.\n\nPerhaps the less said about the captive monkey simulation of the match, the better.\nToday\u2019s matches\nMorocco v Spain (Last 16, 3pm GMT, ITV1) \u201cA punch in the face\u201d is how the Spain manager, Luis Enrique, described defeat by Japan in their third group match. His hope is that the shock blow wakes his team up before a showdown with a dangerous Morocco side who topped Group F. Spain will almost certainly dominate possession but are vulnerable when they lose the ball \u2013 though the return of Aymeric Laporte to the starting XI will aid solidity. Walid Regragui, the Morocco manager, runs a defensively-assured team and his two outstanding players \u2013 winger Hakim Ziyech and attacking full-back Achraf Hakimi \u2013 are a threat on the break. Spain must be wary of the counterpunch.\nPortugal v Switzerland (Last 16, 7pm GMT, ITV1) Xherdan Shaqiri summoned Swiss underdog spirit ahead of this game by proclaiming: \u201cJust as Australia posed problems to Argentina, we can pose a lot of problems to Portugal.\u201d As Australia definitely lost, that might not be the best rallying cry for a Switzerland side that impressed in the fiery 3-2 win against Serbia, with Granit Xhaka controlling play. Xhaka will be kept busy by Portugal\u2019s talent-packed midfield, with Bruno Fernandes \u2013 rested in the last group game \u2013 in fine form with two goals and two assists. These two sides split a pair of Nations League games earlier this year and while Portugal are deserved favourites, a tight encounter likely awaits. AR\nPlayer to watch\nCristiano Ronaldo Well, obviously. However not for the reasons of old, when he was undisputedly his nation\u2019s main threat. Portugal\u2019s greatest ever player scored in a record fifth World Cup via a penalty but did not find the net in open play in three group games (despite desperately trying to get his hair on a Bruno Fernades cross). We may come to a point where the 37-year-old is stymieing Portugal\u2019s play, keeping exciting attackers such as Rafael Le\u00e3o \u2013 admittedly not a direct replacement \u2013 on the bench. Ronaldo has never scored in a World Cup knockout game and will be determined to match Lionel Messi in finally doing so. But if he does not look like scoring, will Santos have the boldness to substitute Ronaldo with the game against Switzerland in the balance? A fascinating subplot. AR\n\nAnd finally \u2026\nWhere do you go to for your World Cup predictions? In 2010 we had Paul the Octopus, in 2014 Brazilian macaws Sarge and Oscar were often spot on, and in 2018 Achilles the Cat had his paw prints all over forecasts for how the tournament in Russia would turn out. But 2022\u2019s go-to predictor isn\u2019t hairy, doesn\u2019t live in water and has only two legs. Step forward French president Emmanuel Macron who, in an interview with Le Parisien, successfully prophesied that France would beat Poland 3-1, with Olivier Giroud, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and Robert Lewandowski all scoring. If he predicts another France win, expect the England team \u2013 and not the World Cup \u2013 to be coming home. GB"

Updated at 7.04pm GMT    6.01pm    Elsewhere \u2026 Cristiano Ronaldo is benched for Portugal\u2019s clash with Switzerland:  And some reading on Brazil and dancing:   Updated at 6.02pm GMT    5.55pm    If that was Sergio Busquets\u2019 last contribution as a Spain player, the last of the 2010 team \u2013 Jordi Alba survives from 2012 \u2013 then that was rather sad.      5.54pm    The socials are in.        5.51pm    Ben Roberts again: \u201cTHE 1835 AL ATLAS TO MARRAKESH IS JUMPING!\u201d   Updated at 5.52pm GMT    5.50pm    Nice smile and sportsmanship from Luis Enrique in congratulating Morocco. He knows this one got away from his team. Morocco deserve their win, and with Hakimi\u2019s penalty, they reached the quarter-finals with true panache.      5.49pm    Morocco\u2019s defenders deserve all the glory, but so too their goalkeeper, brilliant in the shootout. Amazing scenes of celebration, and their coach receives the slaps to his balding head once more. Spain can only reflect on another day when they dominate possession and can find no end-product, and that includes the shootout.      5.47pm   Morocco are through! Morocco 3-0 Spain on penalties!  Hakimi, born in Madrid, Panenkas home, Simon dives the wrong way and Morocco have done it! An African team, an Arab team will be in the last eight at Qatar 2022   Updated at 6.00pm GMT    5.46pm   Saved! Morocco 2-0 Spain  Busquets dallies, and shallies along, and it\u2019s poor. Bono saves well. But he was given chance to do so  Updated at 5.59pm GMT    5.44pm   Saved! Morocco 2-0 Spain  Benoun, who came on so late as a sub, misses and Simon guesses right.   Updated at 5.59pm GMT    5.44pm   Saved! Morocco 2-0 Spain  Carlos Soler takes, and Bono saves down and low. It was the right height, and Bono reads it well.      5.43pm   Scores! Morocco 2-0 Spain  Ziyech smashes down the centre!      5.42pm   Missed! Morocco 1-0 Spain  Sarabia, on to take a penalty, drags his shot on to the post. Advantage Morocco   Updated at 5.46pm GMT    5.41pm   Penalties: Morocco 1-0 Spain  Sabiri sents Simon the wrong way with a coolly slotted kick   Updated at 5.43pm GMT    5.40pm    The toss done, and the goalies pal up, with Morocco to throw first, and towards fans clad in Moroccan red.      5.39pm    That chance for Pablo Sarabia was the one. Spain pushed and pushed for their chance, and it came, only for their sub to miss the target. Remember, Spain have taken a thousand penalties in practice, according to Luis Enrique.      5.36pm   Full-time in extra time: Morocco 0-0 Spain  That\u2019s it, here come the penalties. A test of frayed nerves and tired legs.   Updated at 5.37pm GMT    5.35pm    120+3 min: Hurried defending by Morocco, now playing nine at the back. Spain continue to pass the ball around to that shrill soundtrack. Sarabia gets another touch, and El Yamiq comes across to clear. It briefly looked as it might be going in. Morocco continue to hold on. Sarabia arrives at the back post, and hits the far post! Might he have come on before? He\u2019s been very dangerous\u2026and that\u2019s it. To the shootout we go.   Updated at 5.38pm GMT    5.32pm    120 min: The corner is taken by Sarabia, who does get a touch. The ball comes out, and Fati is tackled. Three minutes added on, and Busquets steps up. Spain continue to be so patient.      5.30pm    119 min: A sub for a sub: Sarabia on for Nico Williams. That\u2019s one of the penalty takers, then. Will he get a touch before the shootout? Spain get another corner.      5.30pm    118 min: Williams has at least added a dimension and gets the ball back from the byline. It\u2019s ruled out, though there are shades of what we saw in the Japan game. Was the curvature of the\u2026.etc etc.   Updated at 5.34pm GMT    5.28pm    117 min: Spain find space \u2013 at last \u2013 and it\u2019s Morata\u2019s turn to get caught in two minds. He spins his pass out wide to Fati and out. Oh Spain, we\u2019ve seen this before, mostly before 2008.      5.27pm    116 min: Williams is the latest Spain player to chase down a ball and find that he can\u2019t get through. Morocco have been outstanding in defence, truly.      5.26pm    114 min: Spain continue to paint the Forth Bridge in constructing the perfect attack, and then Cheddira sets off on one of his sorties, only to get crowded out by Rodri.      5.24pm    113 min: Balde and Fati try to link up but again it\u2019s Amrabat back to clear the danger.      5.23pm    111 min: Saiss feels his hamstring \u2013 or cramp \u2013 go, and he leaves the field. The captain goes off, and is patched up, given the spray. That\u2019s two centre-backs down. Amrabat steps back into defence.      5.21pm    109 min: The Moroccan fans barrack Spain as they hold possession. The sterile domination continues. When does patience become pig-headedness?      5.19pm    107 min: Hakimi shows off his muscle for holding off Fati\u2019s run down the left. He\u2019s been the man of the match for me. He\u2019ll expect to take a penalty, too. And that fate lingers for all on the field. Amrabat has been good, too.      5.18pm    106 min: Spain go on the attack immediately, and the ball is played to Fati by Soler and the control by the Barca youngster is poor. The final touch has been lacking all night.      5.15pm    105+1 min: Spain get a corner, and actually pump it in. The ball comes back to Llorente, after Bono makes a good fist of clearing the ball. Corners have all been dealt with superbly by Morocco. And that\u2019s the end of the first half of extra time.      5.12pm    104 min: Cheddira \u2013 again \u2013 has a big chance. He storms through and Simon, to be fair, makes a good save with his legs. That was a big chance and Cheddira is causing problems for Spain.   Updated at 5.14pm GMT    5.11pm    102 min: Fati again finding a glimmer as Bono and El Yamiq get in a tangle. Then Rodri, in a change in tack, steps forward and attempts a long ranger.      5.09pm    101 min: Spain looking for a goal, Morocco looking for a counterattack. The game is more ragged than before but that\u2019s the pattern of play.      5.08pm    99 min: Morata does well, gets to the byline, and his ball is aimed for Williams, only for the ball to be headed away by some more exemplary Moroccan defending.      5.07pm    97 min: For Spain, Ansu Fati is on, as Balde, with Dani Olmo one of those making way.      5.05pm    95 min: Morocco on the break. Cheddira finds space and seems shocked to have such time, and then wastes it. His shot should not register as a shot.   Updated at 5.08pm GMT    5.01pm    93 min: If Morocco are to find a way into the game, then Hakimi, tireless down the right flank, seems to be the best source of it. Ziyech has given something of a Chelsea performance.      5.00pm    91 min: Back we go again, that break felt very short. Spain have to find something, Morocco seem to fancy the penalties, and have made four subs already.      4.53pm   Full-time: Morocco 0-0 Spain  And that\u2019s the scoreline that\u2019s been coming from the first minutes, pretty much. Neither team is capable of creating anything of note. Spain dominate possession, Morocco dominant in attack defence. But will anyone blink? Penalties look almost certain at this point.    Updated at 5.16pm GMT    4.52pm    90+5 min: Olmo brought down again, and a last chance for a free-kick into that packed Morocco box. Olmo skids it in and Bono claws it away as Nico Williams runs in, then the corner is hacked away, and that\u2019s it. Full-time.      4.50pm    90+3 min: More Spain panic? Some Morocco panic, too, a fresh air shot from a couple of their attackers but the offside flags spares all blushes.      4.49pm    90+2 min: Simon almost gets caught in doing Unai Simon things. He\u2019s a danger. Then Morata tackles \u2013 and fouls \u2013 a screaming El Yamiq.   Updated at 4.55pm GMT    4.47pm    90 min: Olmo is booked, Saiss is booked, and Spain have a free-kick they will undoubtedly overelaborate on. No\u2026Soler whips in and Morata heads wide. Five minutes added on here.      4.46pm    88 min: Morocco finally starting to find space in Spain\u2019s half, and it\u2019s usually Hakimi at the centre. That opens space at the other end where Amrabat, outstanding, steams in to quell the danger from Morata and Williams. There was also a flag on the play.      4.43pm    86 min: A Morocco chance of sorts. Hakimi does Hakimi things, and his cross finds Cheddira, one of those three subs, but they can\u2019t get a decent connection. The Morocco fans launch into song, hoping to inspire their team.      4.41pm    84 min: Aguerd is down, just afer Morocco make three changes. A stretcher comes on, and West Ham fans will know he\u2019s prone to a knock. They\u2019ve seen very little of him but he\u2019s had a very good World Cup.  Elsewhere:       4.39pm    81 min: Spain try to push on. Morocco already looking to pens? Very probably. Morata finds space in the box but his shot is angled across the box and nobody is chasing in.      4.37pm    80 min: Williams escapes down the wing, and Aguerd, the lesser spotted Hammer, clears behind. Then Morata gets Llorente down the flank, an overlap and Saiss knocks behind.      4.36pm    78 min: Olmo swings and skews a ball wide. At least he is having a dig. Bono has had very few saves to make. Spain are being asked to pick up the momentum but are doing little to find it. Morocco have completed half their mission, now for the next, find an attack from somewhere.   Updated at 4.41pm GMT    4.34pm    76 min: Two changes for Spain: off goes Ferran Torres, on comes Nico Williams. Then Laporte picks up the first booking for launching into Hakimi. It\u2019s not been anything like the beef expected in pre-match.      4.31pm    74 min: Hakimi hacks clear, the ball goes to Ziyech but Amrabat can\u2019t keep it. Morocco have been as poor in possession as they have been excellent in attack. Spain keep patient, and Olmo is clattered. The Argentinian ref waves on play again. Let it flow are his watchwords.      4.29pm    72 min: The game continues in its pattern of Spain in possession and Morocco defending deep. But then Ziyech picks up the ball in space, playing it to Amallah but his colleague can\u2019t control the pass.   Updated at 4.31pm GMT    4.28pm    70 min: Gareth Bain: \u201cAre your sources sure? It doesn\u2019t sound a bit like the ululation I\u2019m used to from my fellow South African amaXhosa brethren?\u201d      4.27pm    69 min: More RHCP national anthem fun, this time from Chad Smith, from Ike Proud: \u201cThanks for the MBM, and thanks for introducing me to Flea\u2019s bass solo national anthem. Have you seen his Chilli Peppers bandmate Chad Smith playing the US national anthem? Not particularly remarkable, except for the fact that Chad Smith is their drummer\u2026\u201d      4.25pm    68 min: Spain win a corner, just their second of the game. They take it short, of course, and then keep the ball. They will not be getting it launched, oh no.      4.24pm    66 min: Off goes Boufal, and on comes Ezzalzouli, the 20-year-old. Morocco need some youthful energy. Correction from Christophe Silvey (from Timperley?): \u201cThat\u2019s not exactly whistling, that\u2019s ululation, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s only the women doing it, but it\u2019s a Berber thing, seen in Battle of Algiers and old Foreign Legion films\u2026\u201d      4.22pm    64 min: Boufal signals to the bench now, and he looks done. Alba is back on, and actually jogging. Perhaps it was an impact injury. He got plenty of the magic spray from the physios.      4.20pm    63 min: Bono scrambles under a spinning ball, leaping up to punch it clear, and as the ball breaks, it\u2019s apparent that Jordi Alba has a problem. It looks like a hammy. Spain make two changes: Morata and Soler come on, as Gavi and Asensio go off. Jordi Alba can\u2019t have long for this game. He\u2019s done that thing where they wipe their face with a shirt, usually the end of the affair.      4.18pm    61 min: Nick Parish is here all week: \u201cIn answer to your question asking about the comparison between Garang Kuol and Norman Whiteside, Whiteside was born in 1965 so he\u2019s the older (by a fair bit to be honest). \u201c     4.17pm    59 min: Hakimi is down after being smashed into by Gavi. Spain keep pushing on, and they must be hoping their opponents are tiring. It\u2019s been a manful Moroccan effort.      4.15pm    58 min: Outside the ground, there\u2019s been some regrettable scenes.        4.13pm    56 min: Big cheers as Amrabat, who has been outstanding as Morocco\u2019s holding player, breaks up play and sprays the ball forward. Only for an offside, and that\u2019s a waste of a rare Moroccan attack.      4.11pm    54 min: Spain get a free kick down the inside left, and they take short, Asensio takes to Olmo who blasts it from a narrow angle, and it\u2019s fisted away by Bono.   Updated at 4.19pm GMT    4.10pm    52 min: The loud whistles mean Spain have the ball. There\u2019s no need to look up to see. Eric Petersen gets in touch: \u201cI was within seconds of inadvertently starting an international incident because of anthems. In a prior era, as a sports announcer in Minnesota, I was often called upon to sing the Star-Spangled Banner in my broadcasting travels. A new league member in Thunder Bay, Ontario, meant when that team visited my hometown, I would first sing O Canada for the visitors, as is custom, and then proceed with the Banner. Upon my first visit to Thunder Bay, I found that my reputation had preceded me and I was asked to perform the anthems there. I was in the press box, all set to launch myself into the first notes of O Canada, when I overheard the public address announcer introducing me \u201cto sing the Star-Spangled Banner FOLLOWED by O Canada.\u201d Just in the nick of time.\u201d The bass solo national anthem is preferable.       4.07pm    50 min: Ben Roberts is a busy man: \u201cUnfortunately I only have 30 minutes in Casablanca before jumping on the slow train to Marrakesh! There are 3 African diplomats in my carriage having an intense geopolitical discussion. I hope they are going to Marrakesh too! Also I forgot to mention that I am very much backing Morocco today unlike my 5-yr-old, who was born in Madrid and 9s very much backing Spain! \u201c     4.06pm    49 min: Had a few complaints about the Argentinian referee being a bit lax on the Moroccans tactics. But I\u2019m not too sure. Morocco get a glimmer when Unai Simon gets i tangle as Ziyech chases him down. Wasn\u2019t he supposed to be good with the ball at his feet?   Updated at 4.10pm GMT    4.04pm    47 min: Ferran Torres is pulled back by Mazraoui, who is not booked for some reason. Spain take the free-kick quickly, whip the ball in and En-Nesyri, a forward, gets back and heads the ball out.      4.03pm    46 min: We are back underway, and the news is that Spain had just one shot on goal in the first half. That\u2019s testament to Morocco\u2019s defending and Spain\u2019s determination to walk the ball into the net\u2026Spain begin the half by passing the ball around as if shooting on goal is not their problem.     3.57pm    Message for Ben Roberts:      3.51pm    John Moloney gets in touch from Denmark: \u201cI enjoyed the profile of Azpilicueta by Sid Lowe this morning; Azpilicueta always seems like a really decent bloke as well as being really quite good at football. I had the good luck to be at Parken with my family to see the cracking match between Spain and Croatia in the Euros - great game and a terrific atmosphere.  \u201cWe were sitting by the Croatian supporters who were brilliant, but got a bit overexcited as things turned pear-shaped. Parken is a really tight ground and an element of the Croatia supporters started hurling beer and plastic beer glasses at the Spanish players. Azpilicueta came to take throw right in front of ua and duly got the treatment. His reaction was great - stayed cool (if annoyed) and turned to the crowd and asked them reasonably to show a little respect. Impressive restraint and although it did not stop the problem entirely it certainly took a lot of heat out of the situation. Azpilicueta is a grown up in a world where there are not so many. Talking of which, Gavi is going to end up on the naughty step if someone does not point out that he isgetting a bit overexcited.\u201d     3.48pm   Half-time: Morocco 0-0 Spain  As you might expect, Spain have dominated possession but less expectedly, the Moroccans have made the better chances. Sofiane Boufal\u2019s missed header was something of a sitter.   Updated at 3.50pm GMT    3.46pm    45 min: Just a minute added on, and it\u2019s been breathless stuff, if very tight. The half ends with a hurried Morocco clearance.      3.45pm    44 min: Asensio wins a corner, taken quickly and then Pedri zings in a ball that nobody attacks. That\u2019s where they needed Julio Salinas to nod the ball in.      3.44pm    43 min: A frantic Spain have to get it launched as Laporte has to head a Ziyech headed cross back out. Morocco look the more dangerous on the attack, actually capable of creating chances.      3.43pm    41 min: Jeremy Boyce gets in touch: \u201cMorocco clearly need to channel their inner Jose 2010 Champions League final, lest we forget, beating Bayern 2 - 0 despite \u201cenjoying\u201d only 30% possession. The goals were scored on 35 and 70 minutes, we\u2019re nearly there... \u201c We\u2019re past the witching hour, but Morocco go close. Rodri has to head the ball back out and it comes to Boufal, and that\u2019s a free header\u2026missed. That should have been gobbled right up.      3.41pm    40 min: All Spain, but still no penetration. Hakimi is a high-class defender, as well as a high-class overlapper and he makes sure Dani Olmo gets nowhere fast.      3.40pm    38 min: Correction from Ben Blatch-Hanlon: \u201cI think you\u2019ll find that Gavi is actually the youngest player to feature in a World Cup knockout game since Australia\u2019s (and soon to be Newcastle\u2019s) Garang Kuol against Argentina on Saturday just gone, who himself was the youngest since Pele. Gavi was born on 5 August 2004 while Kuol is a sprightly month and ten days younger.\u201d How does that compare to Norman Whiteside on 1 July 1982?   Updated at 3.48pm GMT    3.37pm    37 min: Morocco could not be said to be one of those teams who engage in the high press. It\u2019s more a low press. Spain are pressing high but have created very little. Olmo and Asensio are skating round the fringes but finding very few spaces.      3.36pm    35 min: Ferran Torres seeing plenty of the ball out wide, and the whistles continue but he is trying to having to beat three men at a time. Spain are putting very heavy pressure on, but Morocco are sat back in numbers.      3.34pm    33 min: First real shot in anger from Morocco, as Zaroury finds space to charge on and shoot. Simon, as per, doesn\u2019t look too comfortable but gets the job done.   Updated at 3.38pm GMT    3.31pm    31 min: Pedri goes on a dart down the left, but Morocco have withdrawn into a defensive shell. Paul Bellsham, one of our esteemed photo editors, cuts in: \u201cNot wishing to blow my own... a cornet is more compact than a trumpet, with more bends leading to a mellower parp.\u201d      3.29pm    29 min: David Sweet has an anthem tale, a good one: \u201cA number of years ago, Yugoslavia (yes, that long ago) were playing Luxembourg in the Grand Duchy. To the consternation of the hosts, the team marched off when the Yugoslav national anthem was played. It turned out that it was the pre-war anthem associated with a fascist government! The match could only start after a radio appeal brought an emigr\u00e9 taxi driver, who had the \u2018right\u2019 anthem on a tape in his cab, to the ground. Luckily, Luxembourg is not very big!\u201d By the way, Spain continue to dominate possession and the Moroccan fans in the stand are beginning to look very nervous.      3.28pm    28 min: Ben Roberts gets in touch: \u201cBy happenstance I am working in Morocco today and tomorrow. I boarded a train from Tangiers to Casablanca on the stroke of kick-off, leaving behind an increasingly excited local population to the quiet of the high speed train (300kmh!) that is currently zipping through the countryside. No live television on this train so it\u2019s MBM all the way. I\u2019m due to arrive in Casablanca just after full time!\u201d Of all the MBMs in all the world\u2026etc etc etc.      3.27pm    26 min: Asensio rattles the side-netting. Chances opening up for Spain? Morocco tiring already?     3.26pm    25 min: Spain should have scored. Well, if they were not offside. Bono comes out, doesn\u2019t find what he is looking for, and Gavi hits the bar. With or without the offside, that should have been buried.    Updated at 3.33pm GMT    3.25pm    23 min: Spain attempt to right themselves, but Morocco will not let them settle. Boufal goes down, having slipped after barging into Llorente. It looks like one of those incidents when a player goes down to protect himself from further action.      3.22pm    21 min: Morocco fancy this now, and former Southampton enigma Sofiane Boufal has just performed an amusement arcade shuffle that Denilson would be proud of.  Updated at 3.23pm GMT    3.21pm    19 min: Gavi throws himself headlong into a high foot in the style of 1980s Bryan Robson and the Phil Jones of the 2010s. Such bravery came at the cost of injuries to both, so here\u2019s hoping it doesn\u2019t for him. Today sees him become the youngest player to feature in a knockout game since Pele, though to continue the Manchester United theme (I know this happens a lot around here), Norman Whiteside would have been younger in 1982 but there was a second group stage in Spain.   Updated at 3.24pm GMT    3.17pm    17 min: Some tackles going in now. Morocco\u2019s plan is working, Spain are not being allowed to settle.      3.16pm    16 min: Joe Pearson gets in touch: \u201cUntil just now, I thought trumpet and cornet were the same thing. Apparently not.\u201d Definitely not. If similar.     3.15pm    15 min: Spain seem to be hoping Morocco can be drawn out of their shell. But that also means they will get some attacking. Boufal speeds on and a cross from Mazraoui tests Simon in the air. Luis Enrique is cackling away on the sidelines. He really is a most intense man.      3.13pm    13 min: Ferran Torres goes out left this time, indicating there is flexibility in Spain\u2019s forwards. Then, Bono, the Moroccan keeper, almost gets into a mess from a back-pass. He makes his escape.      3.11pm    11 min: Morocco free-kick, and in a dangerous position. Hakimi fancies it, from the slight inside-left positoon but he drifts over. It goes wide.   Updated at 3.17pm GMT    3.10pm    10 min: Charles Antaki: \u201cGood point about the anthems being played on some DVD up in the stadium announcer\u2019s box. A real shame. In the good old days, of course, there would be the Band of the Coldstream Guards (or local equivalent) churning out a nearly unrecognisable version of some unfortunate visiting team\u2019s anthem, to the amusement of the away fans. Innocent days.\u201d Yes, bring it back, Gianni. A close relative plays the trumpet and cornet and we\u2019d love to see him at the World Cup.      3.09pm    9 min: Morocco sat back in big numbers, a crowd scene. Torres gets the ball out wide, makes a dart into the box and then runs into traffic. He improvises a backheel and the ball rolls back towards Gavi who commits a foul.   Updated at 3.13pm GMT    3.07pm    7 min: Llorente is overlapping as a full-back, which is probably why he\u2019s in the team ahead of Carvajal. Morocco attack now, and Boufal gets crowded out. More Morocco than before, and that\u2019s a positive sign for them.      3.05pm    5 min: It is presumably the Morocco plan to keep it tight, but surely to have the ball at least some of the time. That\u2019s not happened at all just yet. All Spain, though not too penetrative as yet. Big roars as Ziyech finds space for the counter but then runs the ball out.      3.03pm    3 min: Any dancing? Roy will be watching. The ball remains in the Morocco half, the whistles sustain.       3.02pm    2 min: Spain\u2019s every touch being whistled. And as they will expect to dominate possession that\u2019s an awful lot of whistling. Big cheers when Amrabat wins the ball only for him to play in Hakimi, who then mis-controls.      3.00pm    1 min: Off we go at the Education City Stadium after both teams complete their huddle, and there\u2019s a whistling, howling noise to great the kick-off. This game, unlike so many others in the knockouts, looks like a sellout. And fans may be late in arriving, too.      2.56pm    The Moroccan national anthem is both played lustily by the band playing it (presumably on record) and the fans and players in the stadium. Spain\u2019s anthem gets a smattering of boos, rather regrettably. They don\u2019t sustain long.   Updated at 3.00pm GMT    2.54pm    Maurice Murphy also gets in touch: \u201cIs there an argument that this is the most Spanish team of all with their only natural non midfielders being want to be winger Alba and actually French Laporte. I\u2019m considering Simon as a midfielder because he\u2019s definitely not a goalkeeper.\u201d Yes, an eyebrow raised as Luis Enrique lavished such praise on Unai Simon.      2.53pm    K\u00e1ri Tulinius gets in touch: \u201cPeople who appreciate a good nickname are in for a feast. The Red Fury and the Atlas Lions are two of the best. Some of the very best have never featured at a World Cup, I\u2019m fond of Thailand being called the War Elephants, but if I think about it, my favorite is probably Djibouti\u2019s evocative Shoremen of the Red Sea.\u201d     2.52pm    Looks like things are getting fraught outside the stadium. Via the Daily Mail reporter\u2019s Kathryn Batte. Inside the stadium, the Moroccan fans are making all the noise.       2.47pm    Should you be interested in such things and the governing body is often wrong, then these teams are both lined up in a 4-3-3 formation, according to Fifa.  Llorente at right back in place of the injured Cezar Azpilicueta suggests some flexibility, as the only switch from Spain\u2019s 7-0 win over Costa Rica in their opening group match in Qatar. Azpilicueta has not recovered from a thigh injury suffered in Spain\u2019s last game against Japan, and Luis Enrique opted for Llorente ahead of Dani Carvajal, who struggled a bit with the Japanese.      2.18pm    Much then rests on the Real Madrid/Barca combination of Marco Asencio and Ferran Torres. Our profiles are still freely available.  Ferran Torres:  Raised in Valencia\u2019s academy from the age of six, Torres went on to represent Spain at every youth level before his 2020 senior debut. He left Spain for Manchester City in a \u00a320.8m move in August 2020, then Barcelona for an initial \u00a346.7m in December 2021 - with an eye-catching \u20ac1bn buy-out clause. Last year he helped found a Kick Out Plastic campaign, became an ambassador for a charity helping stray dogs around the world, and launched a sustainable, vegan deodorant, Ferran X Homme. \u201cI\u2019m just focused on doing whatever I can with my influence to better the world,\u201d he says.  Marco Asencio:   Last season he lost his starting place in the Real Madrid lineup with Carlo Ancelotti preferring Federico Valverde and Rodrygo, and this summer he sounded out the market to leave the club. However, despite Asensio enjoying even fewer minutes at Madrid this season, Luis Enrique has put his faith in him and has included him in the World Cup squad. With Spain, he seems to be more aggressive and more physically committed, which is fundamental for Luis Enrique. However both coaches understand that the player\u2019s extraordinary talent is not enough in today\u2019s football.       2.09pm    What do those teams mean? Selim Amallah for Abdelhamid Sabiri is in midfield Morocco\u2019s only change but Luis Enrique has made five changes from the team that lost to Japan on Thursday, the most significant being Alvaro Morata being benched for Marco Asensio. Pau Torres steps down, as Aymeric Laporte comes into defence. Marcos Llorente, Jordi Alba and Ferran Torres all come in, as Cesar Azpilicueta, Alejandro Balde and Nico Williams drop out.      1.58pm    A potential for problems here. Let\u2019s hope it all goes ahead safely.       1.54pm    Today\u2019s Football Daily hones in on the samba showboaters.       1.53pm   The teams  Morocco: Bounou, Hakimi, Aguerd, Saiss, Mazraoui, Ounahi, Amrabat, Amallah, Ziyech, En-Nesyri, Boufal. Subs: Hamdallah, Zaroury, Sabiri, Mohamedi, Chair, Aboukhlal, Ezzalzouli, El Yamiq, Dari, Cheddira, Tagnaouti, El Khannous, Benoun,Attiyat Allah, Jabrane. Spain: Simon, Llorente, Rodri, Laporte, Jordi Alba, Gavi, Busquets, Gonzalez, Ferran Torres, Asensio, Olmo. Subs: Sanchez, Azpilicueta, Garcia, Pau Torres, Morata, Koke, Williams, Raya, Balde, Guillamon, Pino, Carlos Soler, Carvajal, Sarabia, Fati. Referee: Fernando Rapallini (Argentina)     1.46pm    It\u2019s been quite the year for Spain and Chelsea\u2019s veteran defender.   When Azpilicueta played in Spain\u2019s 5-0 win against Slovakia at Euro 2020 in June 2021, it was his first game for the selecci\u00f3n since 2018. Now, he is at his third World Cup, even if it almost ended early. Withdrawn with a knock that will not prevent him facing Morocco, he watched Japan come back to win 2-1. For a few minutes in the second half, Spain were out \u2013 \u201cthere were a lot of nerves,\u201d Azpilicueta says \u2013 but Kai Havertz led Germany\u2019s response against Costa Rica, rescuing seeing Spain and sending them through to play Morocco. Time to say thanks, then?       1.45pm    This will be a huge game in Ceuta, the part of Spain that is pretty much in Morocco.      1.44pm    Perhaps Morocco\u2019s leading player, Achraf Hakimi, was born in Madrid, and was almost denied the chance to play for Morocco.   I think Fifa was only checking rare names from immigrants more than where the boy was born, which is what happened with him,\u201d said Rabie Takassa, who works as a scout in Spain for the Moroccan Football Federation, in an interview in 2017. \u201cThey saw a Moroccan name and he was punished without deserving it. Real Madrid and his family gave all the papers required showing he was born in a hospital in Madrid, that he studied here, that he spent all his life growing up here. It was a complicated time for him because he didn\u2019t know when Fifa would give him the green light to play again.       1.41pm    Luis Enrique, the Spain coach, has been discussing penalties. His team exited Euro 2020 in 2021 at the semi-final stage via spot-kicks.  I imagine that they have done their homework. Over a year ago, in one of the Spain camps, I told them they had to get here with at least 1,000 penalties taken,\u201d Enrique said. If you wait until getting here to practise penalties... [it won\u2019t be enough]. It\u2019s a moment of maximum tension, a time to show your nerve and that you can shoot the penalty in the way you have decided, if you have trained it a thousand times. It says a lot about each player. It\u2019s trainable, manageable, how you manage the tension. It\u2019s increasingly less luck - the goalkeepers have more influence. We have a very good goalkeeper, any of the three can do very well in this situation. Every time we finish training, I see a lot of players taking penalties.      1.37pm    This match is a huge deal for Morocco\u2019s fans.  Per Reuters:  Morocco\u2019s matches have also been testing for organisers: there was pushing and shoving outside the stadium as ticketless fans gathered ahead of its Dec. 1 defeat of Canada, with some trying to climb the fence. Desperate to attend the match against 2010 champions Spain, more than 1,000 Moroccan fans gathered at the official ticketing office on Monday night. Reuters journalists saw at least two scuffles and riot police deploy as the crowd swelled. One fan said many had left empty-handed. Some said they had come after seeing social media posts saying the Moroccan embassy and football association would distribute free tickets. Reuters could not reach the Moroccan football federation for comment. The Moroccan embassy said on Twitter that it had handed out 500 tickets to Moroccans living in Qatar. The Moroccan football team\u2019s official Facebook page had said FIFA had made 5,000 extra tickets available for Morocco fans. \u201cAtlas Lions carry hopes of a whole continent,\u201d the Moroccan newspaper Maroc Le Jour declared in a front-page headline. Royal Air Maroc said on Friday it was laying on four extra flights with 270-340 fans on each. The Moroccan consulate has asked fans to \u201cshow sportsmanship regardless of the result\u201d and to avoid doing anything that could trigger incidents with Spanish fans.      1.35pm    Walid Regragui, the Morocco coach, spoke at a news conference on Monday. Morocco are in their first last-16 match since Mexico 86.   It\u2019s going to be a very difficult game against one of the best teams in the world, they\u2019re among the top favourites. We have, however, our own qualities, and we\u2019ve had an extra day of recuperation. If we can knock them out, it will be a big surprise. I told the players, before the World Cup, we\u2019re playing only finals here. We\u2019ve played three finals in the group phase and now it\u2019s our fourth final. I loved our second half against Canada, when we stuck to our plan and were extremely concentrated. Against Spain, we\u2019ll have to play the whole game like this.  We haven\u2019t been at that level for 36 years, so me and my staff will have to manage the players\u2019 emotions. It is the biggest game of our history but I hope the biggest will be the next one. Our elders cannot replay their game against West Germany while the Spain game is ahead of us. I will tell the players to enjoy themselves, as millions in Morocco will be watching. We have to accept that Spain will have possession. We have our strengths, we abandoned possession to Belgium and Croatia and it worked well. Our plan is that they don\u2019t know what to do with the ball.      1.30pm   Preamble  This may be an intercontinental match, but it is still something of a local affair. As anyone who has been to southern Spain knows, Morocco is just across the water, not much of a ferry ride across the Med from Algeciras or the like, just past the Rock of Gibraltar. And yet the teams have rarely met, just three previous times. They met in a qualifying double-header for the 1962 World Cup and then four years ago in Russia in the group stage. Morocco are carrying Africa\u2019s pride at this tournament, as the last left from their continent, and also the Arab world. Should Spain prevail, then the last eight will have rather familiar, predictable look to it. It falls to Morocco, one of the best supported teams in Qatar, to add an element of the unfamiliar to the quarter-finals. Are they capable of it? Yes, they could be well be. They are one of the very few unbeaten teams left, and dealt very well with Croatia, beat the Belgians comfortably and then did a decent number on Canada, too. With two high-class full-backs, Achraf Hakimi, born in Madrid, and Noussair Mazraoui as well as Hakim Ziyech, showing why Chelsea have not got the best of them, they have talent, and determination. Spain, after winning 7-0, have done what Spain used to do before 2008-2010-2012 and look flaky after being brilliant. Their loss to Japan saw them pay for the lack of a cutting edge, and their reward was facing the Moroccans, against whom they have been drawn in one of the most interesting ties of the second round. Kick-off is 3pm UK time/ 6pm Qatar-Mecca time. Join me.   "

                    "body": "In the end, it really should have surprised no one that Graham Arnold constructed his own reality in the build-up to the Socceroos 1-0 loss to Saudi Arabia. \u201cI\u2019ve been around the national team now for 40 years and I\u2019ve never known a game to be a dead rubber,\u201d he declared. \u201cIt\u2019s more about going out against this team that\u2019s qualified for a World Cup and showing our worth, and giving an opportunity for these players to step up and for them to push for a position in the playoff squad.\u201d  Yet despite any contortions in logic to argue otherwise, a dead rubber is exactly what this match was. A 2-0 defeat against Japan the previous week meant that, no matter the result in Jeddah, the Socceroos knew the fate of their qualification campaign now lay in the playoff path. Meanwhile, the Green Falcons were safe in the knowledge that their ticket to Qatar 2022 \u2013 as symbolised by the large jumbo jet tifo erected in the stands \u2013 was already punched. And while the Socceroos had their moments \u2013 able to play as the reactive team to fashion threatening chances in transition, including an incredibly tight offside call that disallowed a Martin Boyle goal \u2013 Salem Al-Dawsari\u2019s 65th-minute penalty ensured that it would be the hosts who took a comfortable win and first place in Group B. Australia has now won just one of their last seven World Cup qualifiers; a tailspin in form that both probably should have been seen coming and will now force them to secure a fifth-straight World Cup apparence the hard way. Ostensibly, dead rubbers such as Wednesday remove the risks associated with what would otherwise be a competitive fixture. They are an opportunity, as Arnold said, to blood younger or more inexperienced talent against a higher quality opposition, experiment with new tactics and strategies, or, perhaps, salvage some kind of pride for when a collective campaign is consigned to the annals of history. And Arnold, good as his word, demonstrated the first quality in both his starting XI on Wednesday and the in-game substitutions that were made. 22-year-old Hearts defender Nathaniel Atkinson was handed an international debut at right back, 23-year-old Gianni Stensness started his second international cap at centre back after previously starting as a six against Japan, 22-year-old Denis Genreau, after mystifyingly failing to see a single minute in the third-phase of AFC World Cup qualification, lined up in the Australian midfield. 24-year-old striker Nicholas D\u2019Agostino and 20-year-old attacker Marco Tilio were also introduced as second-half substitutes.  With the likes of Tom Rogic, Aaron Mooy, Jackson Irvine, and more all likely to be available, if this youth brigade will see any kind of scope in a coming playoff against the United Arab Emirates and, if the Australia triumphs in that, a do-or-die clash with either Peru, Chile, or Colombia is unknown, but they likely will, or should, represent part of the core of the national team as it begins to prepare for the 2026 World Cup cycle (as low stakes as that now will be with the tournament extended to 48 teams). Of course, in the high-stakes world of international football, the future is never guaranteed. If one was to put much stock in speculative reports and innuendo back in Australia, Wednesday\u2019s game was not only a dead rubber in a qualification capacity, but also for Arnold\u2019s own tenure as Socceroos boss; the axe supposedly set to fall on the 58-year-old\u2019s second tenure as national team boss regardless of the result in the Gulf. In the fine tradition of coaches under the cosh, Arnold had played down the speculation in the lead into the game and, with the post-game press conferences only open to those at the ground, was spared questioning by a local press pack that has grabbed its brushes and begun to place the writing on the wall of his tenure. Nonetheless, in the wake of the defeat, the eyes of Australian football will now inevitably turn to Football Australia in coming days, speculating on the moment if/when black smoke will emerge from the federation\u2019s metaphorical chimney at its Barangaroo office."

                    "body": "The situation for England became clear at around 10.15pm on Friday night in Sydney, as 800 miles to the west in Adelaide Afghanistan scored their runs that guaranteed Australia\u2019s net run rate could not become an extra hurdle. So England can throw away their calculators and focus on the clearest possible equation: beat Sri Lanka by any margin on Saturday and they will be in the semi-finals.\nThe players have all been issued with USB sticks which allow them to watch Sky\u2019s coverage of the tournament in their hotel rooms, and many of them have been in frequent use. Chris Woakes said there were \u201cplenty of fist pumps\u201d during Lorcan Tucker\u2019s brilliant innings for Ireland against the Australians in Brisbane on Halloween, and there would have been so many during Rashid Khan\u2019s 23-ball 48 \u2013 a contribution that meant Australia\u2019s winning margin in the end was only four \u2013 that he must have been in danger of sustaining another shoulder injury.\n\nFive more runs and Afghanistan would not only have provided another stunning upset in a tournament that has been lavishly decorated with them, they would have opened the door for Sri Lanka to qualify for the semi-finals themselves. Instead the Lions now have nothing to play for on Saturday but pride. \u201cWe are [playing] to justify our presence over here in Australia,\u201d Bhanuka Rajapaksa, who has batted at No 5 for Sri Lanka in this tournament, said. \u201cWe just want to play good cricket. At the end of the day the result doesn\u2019t really matter, as long as we play some good cricket.\u201d\nSo Jonathan Trott, former England batter and current Afghanistan coach, added his name to Tucker\u2019s on the growing list of people who will be owed a thank you card if England manage to make the final four. Now Jos Buttler\u2019s side must concentrate on overcoming another familiar figure in Chris Silverwood, their coach until February and now in charge of Sri Lanka, in order to make that happen. \u201cOf course Chris has spoken to us,\u201d Rajapaksa said. \u201cWe have plans for each individual.\u201d\nEarlier in the day Alex Hales had been so enthusiastic about the prospect of a hefty Australian victory forcing England to be ultra-ambitious that he alone might have wished Rashid had been a little less successful. \u201cI think it all comes naturally for us,\u201d Hales said. \u201cIt certainly plays to my strengths. I think it plays to almost every batter\u2019s strength in the side, which is to go out and play their shots and be aggressive.\u201d\n\nIt would not be a bad mindset for Hales to preserve, particularly against Sri Lanka\u2019s seamers early in the innings. Despite extraordinarily bad luck with injuries \u2013 they have had to replace four members of their original squad, three of them seamers \u2013 Silverwood\u2019s side will present plenty of dangers on a potentially tricky surface.\nWith the Sydney Cricket Ground preserving a pristine pitch for Wednesday\u2019s semi-final, England will be playing on the same wicket used by New Zealand and Sri Lanka last Saturday, and by Pakistan and South Africa on Thursday. They will not mind this \u2013 after all the surface at the Gabba, where they beat New Zealand on Tuesday, was in a similar state \u2013 but neither will their opponents, particularly as it looks very dry and likely to offer plenty of encouragement to spinners.\n\nHelped by the fact that they have not been involved in any matches that have been affected by rain, Sri Lanka have bowled 37.1 overs of spin in the Super 12s, considerably more than any other side \u2013 New Zealand are second on the list with 31.2 overs, England some way down the rankings with 19. Maheesh Theekshana and, most of all, Wanindu Hasaranga, in form and on a familiar surface, could make England\u2019s evening extremely uncomfortable.\nBatters meanwhile will be eyeing up the short boundary on one side of the wicket, towards the Clive Churchill Stand. This will have to be a key factor in every decision the captains make on the field, in the knowledge that instructing the wrong bowler to face the wrong batter at the wrong end could turn the match in an instant.\n\nMost importantly, England must maintain the energy they brought to their victory over New Zealand. It may be that the pressure of absolutely having to perform, the complete lack of fall-backs and second chances, is what makes this excellent team great.\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t feel any more intense in the warm-ups or before the game, it was just purely in the game,\u201d Wood said of that match. \u201cIt definitely did feel different. I think because we knew we had to win it just had a different buzz about it. I thought it was a very passionate performance and very desperate \u2013 not desperate like we were reckless, but desperate in terms of we were desperate to win.\u201d\nThey will have to summon that same spirit again. Afghanistan\u2019s performance on Friday means England\u2019s situation is not desperate, but despite it their performance must be."

                    "body": "Garang Kuol is officially off to Newcastle United. Having rode a wave of momentum from A-League youth football to the biggest league in the world in less than a year, the world is at the feet of Australian football\u2019s next big thing. Now, with an entire nation watching on, he stares down the barrel of taking daunting, treacherous steps into the unknown.  Just a week on from becoming the youngest player to debut for Australia since 17-year-old Harry Kewell, Kuol was formally unveiled as the latest member of the Toon on Friday after flying to the UK following the Socceroos\u2019 2-0 win in Auckland to seal the deal. Signing a contract that, according to reports, will make the 18-year-old one of Australia\u2019s highest-paid footballers, the attacker will complete his move to the English Premier League when the transfer window opens in January. Central Coast, who moved to sign him to a two-year deal in June, are expected to receive a transfer fee of close to half a million dollars for the talented youngster, as well as the promise of lucrative sell-on fees. \u201cIt\u2019s unreal,\u201d Kuol said in a statement. \u201cAs a young boy in Australia, the Premier League is the main thing that everyone watches, but nobody actually thinks they\u2019ll reach those heights. To be one of those people, to be in the position I am, it\u2019s amazing. \u201cNow that I\u2019ve signed for Newcastle, I want to train hard, play hard, hopefully go to the World Cup and come back here.\u201d The announcement caps off a whirlwind six-month rise for Kuol, during which he has progressed from a fringe youth prospect at the Mariners seeking to follow in the footsteps of his older brother Alou, to the darling of the A-Leagues and a potential World Cup bolter. To date, he has four goals and an assist in seven appearances off the bench. He has not started a single game of senior professional football. Even taking into account the limited sample size, Kuol represents one of the most exciting and naturally talented prospects produced by Australian football in years. Playing with a sense of freedom he also has an innate sense of timing and positioning not often seen emerging from the country\u2019s developmental framework. At 17, he was among the A-League Men\u2019s leaders in dribbles and entrances into the opposition penalty area when adjusted for his limited minutes.  In short, he makes stuff happen, a quality which will have him in the frame for Graham Arnold\u2019s Qatar 2022 squad \u2013 should he be given and the opportunity to shine in the opening six weeks of the domestic season. Nonetheless, the hype train may need some tempering. Australian football is littered with cautionary tales that, for a variety of reasons, were never able to deliver on the fanfare. In Newcastle, he is not the golden child or the next big thing, rather just one of numerous young and talented prospects from all over the world pushing for a chance which might never come. Fortunately, he has at least avoided being christened with the cursed title of \u2018the next Mark Viduka\u2019. Kuol will not qualify for a work permit when he arrives in England and will thus need to be immediately loaned to a club on the continent, with Portugal mooted as the most likely landing spot. At some point, he will need a first start at senior level and work to develop both his game and fitness to the point where his devastating skill set will continue to impact defenders for the full 90 minutes. This development will likely take place under the stewardship of a club which stands to gain very little beyond the short-term on-field contributions he can make during his time on loan, giving them little incentive to prioritise his development over others on their books. This makes his landing spot key: regular football and an environment in which both his strengths and weaknesses are addressed, along with a patience critical to his progression.  Many of the calls for caution have been framed around Daniel Arzani, who returned to the A-Leagues this season after four ill-fated years abroad. At a base level, comparing the two as players is not altogether helpful, given their vastly different roles before their departure. But Arzani\u2019s experience can speak to the role that fortune can also play in all this. The then 19-year-old tore his ACL barely 20 minutes into his first senior appearance while on loan at Celtic. The injury derailed his progression, and subsequent loan moves into unhappy environments compounded the issue. Of course, the harder one works the luckier one tends to get, and Kuol has the innate tools of a star. Australian football will watch him every step of the way."

Joseph Kosinski actually shot the belated follow-up to the testosterone-fuelled 1986 classic in 2018, but its release was delayed until this year because of that \u201cstrange, two-year gap\u201d known as the coronavirus pandemic. Cinemagoers exited the dark days of Covid looking for an escape, and Maverick delivered. \u201cIt is a little bit of a fantasy world,\u201d Kosinski said. \u201cMaverick can ride around without a helmet and the sun\u2019s always setting.\u201d\nSign off\nThis is the final Afternoon Update for 2022.

                    "body": "There cannot be many, if any, leagues that have been affected by the pandemic as much as the Chinese Super League. It was the first to deal with Covid-19 and, with China keeping stringent restrictions on daily life longer than elsewhere, the last to operate in tightly controlled conditions. With Beijing\u2019s so-called zero-Covid policy recently abandoned, the country of 1.4bn people is finally opening up and this can only be good news for its beleaguered football industry.\n2019 seems like a lifetime ago. Back then the league may have been losing a little of the lustre that made it one of the most-talked about in the world and some of the financial clout that had previously had coaches such as Antonio Conte, then of Chelsea, warning of the danger from the east, but the average attendance was still higher than anywhere else in Asia, at 24,000. There were still international stars such as Ezequiel Lavezzi, Graziano Pell\u00e8, Yannick Carrasco, Alex Teixeira, Javier Mascherano, Renato Augusto and Paulinho, and plenty of quality and excitement.\n\nOn the final day of that season, Guangzhou Evergrande pipped Beijing Guoan to the title and the celebrations in the city formerly known as Canton were surely heard in nearby Hong Kong. As they got their hands on the trophy, however, neither Paulinho nor the coach Fabio Cannavaro could have known that it would be eight months before the next season started and that everything would change in between.\nFrom then, the Chinese Super League went from being one of the world\u2019s highest-profile competitions to one where, for three years, most games took place in empty stadiums and centralised venues. Players were either stuck in hotels for months or, like Paulinho and Anderson Talisca in 2021, could not get back into the country from overseas and ended up being released from their contracts.\nWith no fans, games delayed for weeks and months and big players leaving, it is no wonder many lost interest. The Chinese Football Association paused what schedule there was for months so the national team could prepare for World Cup qualifiers (which had to be played overseas because opponents could not enter China), turning more people off.\nIt didn\u2019t work anyway as Team Dragon did not get close to Qatar, ending qualification eight points behind Oman and a massive 17 behind the group winners, Saudi Arabia, home of a league that had replaced China as the go-to one in Asia for foreign stars even before the arrival of Cristiano Ronaldo. The Chinese Super League was not only never an option for the new Al Nassr player, but was never even mentioned as the remotest of possibilities or the wildest of rumours.\n\nIf another international failure was not a shock, neither were growing financial issues. With no fans buying tickets, sponsorship revenue falling and broadcasters losing interest because of the erratic scheduling, many clubs were soon struggling. In February 2021 the defending champions, Jiangsu FC, owned by the retail giant Suning, which is currently looking to sell Internazionale, folded. The financial struggles of property developers, hit by an overheated market, posed a bigger problem. Real estate companies owned, at least in part, more than half the top-tier clubs and, over time, more and more clubs could not pay salaries or utility bills.\nAt the end of the 2021 season Chongqing\u2019s coach Chang Woe-ryong spoke for many when he broke down in tears and said: \u201cI would like to say thank you to the players who overcame many difficulties this year. The reason I shed tears is because I felt so sorry for them and their families.\u201d\nThere were plenty of other examples, such as Hebei FC, owned by China Fortune Land Development. \u201cSince 2020, Hebei FC has run into unprecedented difficulties,\u201d the club, who had not long said goodbye to Manuel Pellegrini, Mascherano and Lavezzi, said in 2021. \u201cIt is true that the club cannot pay water and electricity bills and travel expenses.\u201d\nHebei\u2019s financial issues resulted in a points deduction in November (two other clubs in the top tier and five in the second were hit with the same punishment), though relegation was already nailed on. There was a bigger name that dropped, however. Evergrande bought Guangzhou in 2010 and started the spending spree that spread around the country, buying stars who came to play for coaches such as Marcello Lippi and Luiz Felipe Scolari in front of average attendances of more than 40,000. The Reds were dominant over the next decade, with eight Chinese Super League and two Asian Champions League titles. In 2021 however, the property giant was $300bn in debt. The football team had become a distraction and was increasingly made up of rookie domestic players. Relegation was confirmed in December. The first of the big spenders going down really did mark the end of an era, though with other clubs who stayed up potentially going out of business, Guangzhou may get a reprieve.\n\nThe hope is that no more clubs fold. With zero-Covid abandoned, the country and economy opening up, there should soon be more ticket sales, sponsorship and broadcasting revenue. The signs are brighter in the property market too and about \u00a3400bn of credit was made available to cash-strapped real estate companies in December.\nWhether that will feed through to clubs remains to be seen. There has not been much debate as to whether going back to the way things were is desirable \u2013 but that can wait. For now, fans can finally watch their teams play home and away for the first time since 2019. It looks as if something approaching normality \u2013 a relative term though that may be \u2013 is about to return to Chinese football."

                    "body": "As trepidation grows over the thought of Harry Maguire and John Stones trying to stop Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 when England face France on Saturday night, Gareth Southgate can take comfort from the knowledge his right-hand man dealt with this kind of situation when Chelsea won the Champions League in 2012.\nSteve Holland\u2019s experience is a reminder that any player, even the most devastating forward at the World Cup, can be contained if the tactical approach is good enough. Southgate\u2019s assistant was on the backroom staff at Chelsea when they became European champions 10 years ago and he remains proud of how Roberto Di Matteo\u2019s unfancied side stopped a peak Lionel Messi from scoring when they reached the final of the Champions League at the expense of Pep Guardiola\u2019s Barcelona.\n\u201cThere are a handful of players you need to consider special attention to,\u201d Holland says. \u201cMessi has been one and probably still is. You\u2019d have to put Mbapp\u00e9 in that kind of category. We need to look at trying to avoid leaving ourselves in situations where he is as devastating as we\u2019ve all seen.\u201d\n\nHolland believes the tie with France is a 50-50 game. He knows the world champions have forwards who can score a goal in the blink of an eye. He will remember, too, that there was an element of luck involved when Chelsea beat Bar\u00e7a given that Messi, who was just as terrifying as Mbapp\u00e9 is now, missed a penalty in the second leg.\nEngland need to strike the right balance. Holland, who has worked for Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and Antonio Conte at club level, is fascinating on the tactical challenges posed by Mbapp\u00e9. Do England have to be cautious? Or are they bold enough to try to force him back?\n\u201cI remember having a conversation with Mourinho when he was with Real Madrid,\u201d Holland says. \u201c[Dani] Alves would be the right-back for Barcelona and flying forwards in attack. He would play a soldier against him to try to stop him, but then you don\u2019t get any threat from your team from the soldier. You\u2019re just stopping somebody. You\u2019re not actually hurting them. Then he would try to play [Cristiano] Ronaldo one against one because Alves was fantastic going forwards but maybe not quite as good defensively as a consequence.\n\n\u201cThere is a plus and a minus to every one. It\u2019s that cat and mouse of: \u2018Yes, we have got to try to deal with him, but we also have to try to exploit the weakness that his super-strength delivers.\u2019 Trying to adapt your team to cover for that while still trying to create your own problems is the challenge.\n\u201cI would like to think we won\u2019t just be looking to stop a player. We would be looking to try to do everything possible to limit his super-strength while still trying to focus on our own strengths because we have good players; players just as likely to cause France trouble as Mbapp\u00e9 would be to us. We have to find that balance.\u201d\nThe obvious question, then, is whether England keep faith with their 4-3-3 and back Kyle Walker to stop Mbapp\u00e9 flying down the left. Or is this the moment to switch to a back five, protect Stones and Maguire by moving Walker to right centre-back and start Kieran Trippier at right wing-back?\n\n\u201cThe perception has been that the five is more negative than the four, which I don\u2019t completely agree with,\u201d says Holland, who explains why England used a five against Germany and Italy at Euro 2020. \u201cGermany played 3-4-3 and we felt that if we matched them up we could be superior individually.\u201d\nBut was it necessary when England met Italy in the final? \u201cYou could go either way. They had and still have a similar way of playing where they create five players high in attack. If you\u2019ve got four at the back, you get overloaded at times and that can cause a tactical problem, so that was part of the rationale in that game.\n\u201cWe have a group 18 months further on than the Euros. One or two of our younger forwards, there has definitely been an evolution. To win tournaments you need to be the best team in both penalty areas.\u201d\nHolland thinks about England\u2019s win over Iran in their opening game in Qatar. \u201cSix goals is a good start but two goals a game against is not going to win us the World Cup. We\u2019ve now had three clean sheets, which is clear progress.\n\n\u201cWe have goals from different players. We have three, four, five attacking players where there is very little between them. There isn\u2019t a right or wrong team. It\u2019s not just a case of a back three or a back four, it\u2019s trying to utilise what we\u2019ve got to give ourselves the best chance of scoring as many goals as possible and conceding as few.\u201d\nInevitably, the conversation turns to Jude Bellingham, England\u2019s sensational 19-year-old midfielder. \u201cHe\u2019s unique,\u201d Holland says. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked about Messi and those special techniques. What makes the top, top ones is the mentality, the ambition every day to push and be competitive. There were a few at Chelsea I felt were always there in training.\u201d\nAshley Cole, Frank Lampard, Didier Drogba and John Terry come to mind. \u201cThere were others,\u201d Holland says. \u201cPlayers that weren\u2019t super-gifted physically or super-gifted technically, but the mental aspect of it took them to a different level of performance. Jude has those mental attributes. There has been an evolution physically in the last 12 months. It has taken him to another level.\u201d\n\nHolland considers Bellingham\u2019s experience at Borussia Dortmund. \u201cThe Bundesliga is a good league to develop in. It\u2019s probably not quite as challenging every week as the Premier League. He gets a fair share of games where he is comfortable and enjoying playing on the ball and not always on the limit, which for a young player is a good way to develop. His impact in this tournament, for a player of his age, is already hugely unusual.\n\u201cI\u2019m always balanced, as Gareth is, with the amount of praise because we have seen so many where so much goes wrong because they believe in their publicity. I don\u2019t think that will happen with Jude.\u201d\nHolland is happy Bellingham is adding goals to his game. It is something for France to think about as England put the finishing touches to their plan. \u201cThere\u2019s only three things that you can do in football,\u201d Holland says. \u201cStop goals, make goals, score goals. That\u2019s how you contribute.\u201d"

                    "body": "\u201cIf there was a brick wall there and the ball was on the other side, then Uwe Seeler would go right through it,\u201d said the Northern Ireland international Jimmy McIroy. Such was the reputation of the squat little centre-forward whose very name became a war cry \u2013 \u201cUwe, Uwe, Uwe!\u201d \u2013 for fans of West Germany in the 1950s and 60s. Seeler, who has died aged 85, played for his country in four World Cups, even though, between the 1962 and 1966 competitions, he had to be fitted with an artificial achilles tendon. Before the more elegant and technical era of Franz Beckenbauer, and even some distance into it, he represented the traditional strengths of German football: power, high morale, commitment and an indomitable will to win. Although he was unable to pick up a World Cup winners\u2019 medal, he played in the 1966 final against England at Wembley, where he was captain, and led the side again in 1970 as West Germany took third place in Mexico. In domestic football he spent his entire career with Hamburg and was German footballer of the year three times, in 1960, 1964 and 1970. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest footballers the country has produced. Born in Hamburg, Seeler was the son of Erwin, a harbour worker and former Hamburg player, and his wife, Anny. He was still only 17 when he made his first appearance for West Germany, as a substitute outside-left against France in Hanover in 1954. He played in his first World Cup finals in Sweden in 1958, scoring in the opening game, a 3-1 win against Argentina, after an exchange of passes with Hans Sch\u00e4fer. In the semi-final in Gothenburg, against Sweden, he reciprocated by crossing for Sch\u00e4fer to score with a ferocious 25-yard volley, but West Germany lost 3-1. Seeler also played in the third place match in Gothenburg, a 6-3 defeat against France, for whom Just Fontaine racked up four goals.  In the next World Cup finals in Chile in 1962, when West Germany went out in the quarter-finals to Yugoslavia, Seeler was as boldly effective as ever, scoring a notable goal against the hosts in Santiago with a brave, plunging header. He was indeed astonishingly good with his head for so short a man (he was 5ft 7in), jumping far higher than might ever have been expected.  Seeler\u2019s achilles tendon operation would subsequently put him out for a year, but in September 1965 he was back in the West Germany side in a crucial World Cup qualifying match against Sweden in Stockholm. He scored, and the Germans won 2-1, going on to the finals in England. There Seeler was as talismanic as ever, appearing in every West Germany game. He scored the winning goal against Spain in a 2-1 victory in the eliminating group, and another at Sheffield in a torrid quarter-final against Uruguay. Horacio Troche, the Uruguay captain, had been sent off for a retaliatory kick in the stomach to Lothar Emmerich. As he came off the field Troche slapped Seeler in the face, but the German did not retaliate. \u201cThe silly fellow was trying to provoke me,\u201d he said. In the Wembley final, against England, Seeler played his usual robust game, but this time he couldn\u2019t score and England took the spoils, 4-2 after extra time. Comfortably established as a representative for the Adidas sports goods firm, it looked, during the years between the 1966 and 1970 World Cups, as if Seeler\u2019s international career was done. Of the 11 internationals played by West Germany in 1969 he figured only in one. Bayern Munich, the pioneers of total football, were the new reality, and their stocky opportunist, the prolific Gerd M\u00fcller, was the international centre-forward. It seemed unlikely that he and Seeler could ever co-exist, but in the World Cup of 1970 in Mexico they triumphantly did so; both on and off the field. Uwe was quite content to drop back behind M\u00fcller and support him from midfield. In the team\u2019s hotel they shared a bedroom. Seeler would play in all six games for the Germans, and would score in four of them; most significantly in Leon, against England in the quarter-finals, when he rose to a ball put in by Karl-Heinz Schnellinger and back-headed it over a stunned Peter Bonetti, the England goalkeeper. A fluke? Many have said so, but the leap was still formidable.  Previously he had scored two goals against Peru, and others versus Morocco and Bulgaria. But the Germans, with Beckenbauer\u2019s arm strapped to his side, went out 4-3 to Italy in the semi-final at the Azteca stadium, a match often referred to as \u201cthe game of the century\u201d. Seeler\u2019s far-post header made M\u00fcller a goal in that encounter. There was still another international game to come for Seeler, in Nuremberg in September 1970, giving him his 72nd cap, which was then a national record. It has been easily surpassed since, but there were fewer games in those days and Seeler would clearly have won many more caps had it not been for his achilles tendon injury. He scored 43 goals during his international career, nine of them in World Cup finals matches. He remained loyal to Hamburg throughout his playing career and was five times top scorer in the West German league, scoring no fewer than 36 goals in season 1959/60. Two of those came in a 3-2 win against Cologne, which gave Hamburg the national title, and he also scored a hat-trick in the West German cup final of 1963, which Hamburg won 3-0 against Borussia Dortmund. In 1968 he was captain of the Hamburg team that reached the final of the European Cup Winners\u2019 Cup, scoring eight goals along the way, although Milan won the final. In all Seeler scored 404 goals from 476 league games, in many of which he appeared with his older brother, Dieter, who also played for Hamburg. After retirement in 1972 Seeler continued his advisory work with Adidas, set up his own sportswear company, and had a number of other business interests, including ownership of a petrol station. In addition he became a leading executive at Hamburg, and was president of the club for just over two years from 1995. Since 2005 Hamburg\u2019s stadium has been home to a giant sculpture of his right foot. He married Ilka, a handball player, in 1959. They had three daughters and seven grandchildren. \u2022 Uwe Seeler, footballer, born 5 November 1936; died 21 July 2022"

                    "body": "For Morocco\u2019s squad and most of the estimated 45,000 fans following them in Qatar, 1986 is not even a distant memory. Even the coach, Walid Regragui, was only 10 when Mohamed Timoumi, Abdelkrim Merry and the goalkeeper-captain Badou Zaki inspired the Atlas Lions to become the first African side to reach the knockout stages of a World Cup courtesy of a 3-1 win against Portugal. \u201cNo one expected us to beat them,\u201d the defender Noureddine Bouyahyaoui said recently.\nThe success of 36 years ago could be about to repeat itself, with Morocco needing a point against Canada on Thursday to guarantee a place in the last 16 after their win against Belgium. They have not conceded a goal in six matches since Regragui took over in August, in echoes of the 1986 team.\nThat side qualified for Mexico after letting in one goal in eight matches and began with another two clean sheets against England and Poland. Then came their best performance in the final group-stage match.\n\nFacing a Portugal side who had reached the semi-finals of the European Championship two year earlier, goals from Abderrazak Khairi put them 2-0 up at the break before Merry made sure that they topped the group. \u201cLots of people expected us to lose and lots of people lost on the lottery,\u201d said their Brazilian coach, Jos\u00e9 Faria. \u201cWe could go home now. It\u2019s as if we\u2019ve won the world championship already.\u201d\nA Lothar Matth\u00e4us goal for West Germany from a free-kick in the 87th minute of a gruelling second-round match ended Morocco\u2019s participation in Mexico and they could be on course to meet at this tournament should the stars align.\n\n\u201cThe 1986 team remains the best in the history of Morocco,\u201d says the Moroccan pundit Jalal Bounouar. \u201cAny achievement like this will make the fans remember the names of the players because it is not that easy for African teams to compete with European and Latin American teams. \n\u201cThere is this comparison with Mexico because there is a general feeling that we can qualify. We can see that the players and the coach are playing high-level tactical football. There is also a winning spirit \u2013 it is rare to see this in the national team.\u201d\nRegragui \u2013 a former defender who won 45 caps \u2013 succeeded the veteran Vahid Halilhodzic after excelling in club management and has galvanised his squad into a formidable defensive unit that is difficult to beat. But it has been the return of three players \u2013 Noussair Mazraoui, Abderrazak Hamdallah and the playmaker Hakim Ziyech \u2013 from the international wilderness that has helped lift Morocco to the next level.\n\nRegragui said of Chelsea\u2019s Ziyech on Wednesday: \u201cA lot of people talk about him, about he is a crazy guy, he is a difficult guy to manage, he can\u2019t help the team. For me, what I say, when you give him the love, the confidence, he can die for you. And it\u2019s what I give him \u2026 he is a big player, playing on a big team in Europe and you see he is a different player with the national team. All of the coaches give him the confidence, the same with the staff.\u201d\nAccording to Abdellah Aarab, who owns the Moroccan football website almarssadpro.com, Ziyech is not the only player to have benefited from Regragui\u2019s approach. \u201cThe biggest thing the coach has done is motivate the whole squad,\u201d he said. Bounouar adds: \u201cHis ability to communicate and the positive atmosphere he creates within the team have given him the respect of fans and players themselves, including the superstars.\u201d\n\nBefore a game at the Al Thumama stadium that is expected to be dominated by Morocco fans as they anticipate another historic moment, Regragui condemned riots that broke out in Belgium and the Netherlands after Morocco\u2019s win over Belgium.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to see that. You need to respect the country where you are born and live,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s not Moroccan people. Moroccan people have more respect and in our culture you have to respect everybody. You can be happy, do your party but you have to respect everybody and I don\u2019t like what has happened. \n\u201cI hope after Canada the Moroccan people enjoy but only to dance and to cry about what happens on the pitch and be respectful.\u201d\nShould Morocco book a place in the last 16, there will be plenty of reasons to celebrate. \u201cIf we do it, I think they will be remembered as heroes just as we do with the 1986 team,\u201d says Aarab. \u201cThat will be a great achievement.\u201d"

Dick was able to drill into the gaps in his reader\u2019s shared ideas about reality and wrench open a gap. In football terms, he\u2019s like one of those managers who hit upon some way to exploit the rules of the game or the prevailing manner of playing, which unnerves and annoys the more conventionally minded. Philip K. Dick is the literary equivalent of Graham Taylor.\u201d\nHa! And with that, I bid you all goodnight. Peace out. \n\n\n\n 10.22pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 10.21pm  \n\nHere\u2019s Scott Murray\u2019s Man City 2-0 Chelsea MBM.\n\n\n\n\n 10.20pm  \n\nIn their history, Liverpool have been involved in 27 penalty shootouts; they\u2019ve won 20 of them, and have arguably only lost one that really mattered, in the final of the 2016 League Cup to Man City. If it was actually a lottery, you\u2019d say it\u2019s rigged. \n\n\n\n 10.16pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 10.16pm  \n\nIf I was Southgate, which I\u2019m not, I\u2019d be taking a variety of strikers to bring on in specific situations, and as many other gamebreakers as I could find. But it looks like he\u2019ll go defence-heavy, which I guess makes some sense, as he\u2019s so reticent to sub Kane or sterling that it barely matters who\u2019s on the bench unless one of them gets injured. I\u2019d also take Sancho because, though he\u2019s unreliable, he has the skill, vision and composure to turn a game, but I can see why Southgate\u2019s mistrustful of him. \n\n\n\n\n 10.13pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 10.11pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 10.09pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 10.07pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 10.07pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 10.07pm  \n\nLet\u2019s do some reports\u2026\n\n\n\n 10.07pm  \n\nPhew! That was a night! \n\n\n\n 10.06pm  \nFull-time: Liverpool 0-0 Derby County (Liverpool win 3-2 on penalties)\n\nWildsmith goes to his right, Elliott sweeps to his left, and Liverpool have won on penalties yet again! Kelleher is the hero yet again!\n\n\nUpdated at 10.32pm GMT\n\n\n 10.05pm  \n\nOn-loan from Everton, here comes Lewis Dobbin \u2026 and Kelleher makes a terrific save, clawing away from above him! it wasn\u2019t in the corner, but generally the power and height takes that in. 2-2 still, and can Harvey Elliott win it for Liverpol?\n\n\nUpdated at 10.14pm GMT\n\n\n 10.04pm  \n\nNunez does a lot of dancing around, then slips to the keeper\u2019s left; the keeper goes the right way, but the pen has just enough on it to creep home. \n\n\n\n 10.03pm  \n\nSibley flips across Kelleher to give Derby 2-1!\n\n\n\n 10.02pm  \n\nFirmino, very casually, takes a big step to commit the keeper, then lofts his kick over the bar! 1-1 after three apiece! \n\n\n\n 10.02pm  \n\nAt Anfield, each side has missed once; it\u2019s 1-1 after two each. Stefan Bajcetic misses for Liverpool, but the Kelleher saves \u2026 and then saves another! Firmino will now take for 2-1!\n\n\n\n 9.59pm  \n\nGutted we were denied the keepers. By way of compensation, here\u2019s Kevin Pressman.\n\n\n\n\n 9.58pm  \nFull-time: West Ham 2-2 Blackburn (Blackburn win 10-9 on penalties)\n\n\nOgbonna, West Ham\u2019s captain on the night, slams his kick against the bar and down the wrong side of the line! Blackburn are through, despite being behind after 87 minutes of normal time, and West Ham are gawn!\n\nUpdated at 10.02pm GMT\n\n\n 9.57pm  \n\nSky\u2019s reporter just accidentally slipped in an \u201cus\u201d talking about West Ham as Garrett made it 10-9 to Blackburn. \n\n\n\n 9.56pm  \n\nBack at West Ham, it\u2019s 9-8 to Blackburn. Up steps Aguerd \u2026 and he scores! Nines!\n\n\n\n 9.55pm  \nFull-time: Liverpool 0-0 Derby County\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this film before. \n\n\n\n 9.55pm  \nFull-time: Southampton 1-1 Sheffield Wednesday (Southampton win 6-5 on penalties)\n\nAnd Nathan Jones was in the stands, prior to taking over as manager.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.03pm GMT\n\n\n 9.54pm  \nFull-time: Man City 2-0 Chelsea\n\nChelsea had their chances, but City were easily the better team. \n\n\n\n 9.53pm  \n\nRankin-Costello scores for Blackburn, Cresswell scores for West Ham. \n\n\n\n 9.52pm  \n\nEdun scores for Blackburn, Johnson scores for West Ham. I swear players are getting better at penalties, and it\u2019s 6-6! \n\n\n\n 9.51pm  \n\nLanzini slots home cooly as the keeper dives out of the road. Sudden death it is! \n\n\n\n 9.50pm  \n\nSomeone scores for Blackburn, and here comes Lanzini; he must score\u2026\n\n\n\n 9.50pm  \n\nWest Ham and Blackburn are at 4-4 with one penalty left each\u2026\n\n\n\n 9.50pm  \nFull-time: Newcastle 0-0 Crystal Palace (Newcastle win 3-2 on penalties)\n\nPope saves from Ebiowei! When it\u2019s going for you it\u2019s going for you, and Newcastle are through!\n\n\nUpdated at 9.59pm GMT\n\n\n 9.48pm  \n\nOh! Johnstone saves from Botman \u2026 but Pope saves from Mateta! If Guimaraes scores Newcastle are through \u2026 he skips and dances to the ball \u2026 then smashes over the bar! \n\n\n\n 9.45pm  \n\nNewcastle now lead Palace 3-1 \u2013 Hughes scored for Palace, Trippier and Joelinton for Newcastle. Oh and Ward has tucked his go away, so it\u2019s 3-2. \n\n\n\n 9.44pm  \n\nMcGoldrick, the centre-forward who hates scoring goals, has just headed into the ground but at his feet, thereby allowing Kelleher to collect \u2013 when he might well have scored. \n\n\n\n 9.43pm  \nFull-time: Arsenal 1-3 Brighton\n\nArteta sent on the big guns at the end, but Brighton hung on well. \n\n\n\n 9.43pm  \n\nChris Wood has scored Newcastle\u2019s first penalty, and Pope has saved from Palace\u2019s Milivojevic diving to his left. That\u2019s a really good save.\n\nUpdated at 9.47pm GMT\n\n\n 9.41pm  \nFull-time: West Ham 2-2 Blackburn\n\nAnd yet more! \n\n\n\n 9.41pm  \nFull-time: Southampton 1-1 Sheffield Wednesday\n\nMore penalties!\n\n\n\n 9.39pm  \nFull-time: Nottingham Forest 2-0 Spurs\n\nDisaster for Spurs, while Forest, who were well worth their win, make round four for only the second time in 18 years!\n\n\n\n 9.39pm  \nFull-time: Wolves 1-0 Leeds\n\nThat\u2019s a massive win for Wolves, who were desperate for some good vibes. \n\n\n\n 9.38pm  \nFull-time: Newcastle 0-0 Crystal Palace\n\nPenalties it is! \n\n\n\n 9.38pm  \n\n\u201cSpeaking of players whose names are always referred to in full,\u201d says Phil Russell, \u201cI don\u2019t recall anyone ever shortening Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink despite it being quite the mouthful, and unlikely to be confused with anyone else.\u201d\nI guess it\u2019s the pleasure of getting to say such thing. \n\n\n\n 9.37pm  \n\nIt looks like we\u2019re getting penalties in West Ham 2-2 Blackburn, Newcastle 0-0 Palace and Southampton 1-1 Sheffield Wednesday. \n\n\n\n 9.35pm  \nWHAT A GOAL! West Ham 2-2 Blackburn (Brereton Diaz 88)\n\nBrereton Diaz gets the ball on the left of the box, steps across the first challenge, then absolutely devastates a rising finish into the far top corner! He is for real!\n\n\n\nUpdated at 9.43pm GMT\n\n\n 9.34pm  \n\nLiverpool have sent on Firmino, Nunez and Elliott in a bid to avoid a shoot-out against Derby, as though they don\u2019t always win those. \n\n\n\n 9.33pm  \n\nOrtega has just made a really good save from Pulisic, who turned a cross inside the near post while, at Forest, Djed Spence has apparently come on and done well. \n\n\n\n 9.31pm  \n\nSouthampton have a free-kick and Ward-Prowse clips back to the edge instead of crossing, whereupon Armstrong power-sweeps against the bar! That was a serious hit. \n\n\n\n 9.31pm  \nGOAL! Wolves 1-0 Leeds (Boubacar Trore 85)\n\nThis is another lovely finish, Traore teed-up to sweep into the far side-netting from 20- yards. Man, Wolves need this win.\n\n\nUpdated at 9.48pm GMT\n\n\n 9.29pm  \n\n\u201cElsewhere in your esteemed rag,\u201d emails Nicholas Brown, \u201cthe great John Crace, Spuds fan [otherwise nice guy] says he\u2019s not gonna bother showing up for first halves. He figures if the team doesn\u2019t, why should he?\u201d\nConcourse-slaking sounds a decent option.\n\nUpdated at 9.30pm GMT\n\n\n 9.28pm  \n\n\u201cAnd another thing that\u2019s actually crap\u2026\u201d dares Matt Dony. \u201cIconoclasm, is it? (In lieu of any goals in the Liverpool v Derby match.) Blade Runner. Magnificent film, in my top 5. But the original book, like almost everything by Philip K Dick, is almost unreadable. He was an ideas machine, but a phenomenally bad writer, which no one ever seems to talk about. Barely any dialogue that isn\u2019t hilariously expositional. Laboured metaphors. Pace all over the shop. He\u2019s a legend of sci-fi, but couldn\u2019t actually write for toffee.\u201d\nI\u2019ve not read, but I must confess to trying twice with the film and not getting it. I didn\u2019t like Quantum Leap either. \n\n\n\n 9.26pm  \n\nGrealish weaves into the box, round two challenges, and just as a goal seems inevitable, Cucurella flings himself into a block. Good de-fence. \n\n\n\n 9.25pm  \nGOAL! West Ham 2-1 Blackburn 1 (Antonio 78)\n\nIt\u2019s a good one this, a diag seeking Bowen sent back towards him, 15 yards out, right of centre, and he drills a proper centre-forward\u2019s finish low into the far corner.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 9.36pm GMT\n\n\n 9.21pm  \n\nBenrahma, following up as Antonio is blocked off, has just leathered over the bar with plenty of goal at which to aim. West Ham and Blackburn are still 1-1. \n\n\n\n 9.20pm  \nRED CARD! Orel Mangala of Forest is sent-off for two bookable offences!\n\nThe second one is for a possible ball-winning but definitely scissoring challenge on Richarlison as he tried to counter. Can Forest hang on? \n\n\n\n 9.19pm  \nGOAL! Arsenal 1-3 Brighton (Lamptey 71)\n\nAnd it looks like Brighton are through too! The exceedingly likeable Tariq Lamptey has, we\u2019re told, defended really well tonight, and now he advances from right-back, no one unloads him, and he buries a finish under Hein and towards the far corner.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 10.15pm GMT\n\n\n 9.18pm  \nGOAL! Man City 2-0 Chelsea (Alvarez 58)\n\nYou could see Julian Alvarez was settling \u2013 it was so obvious even I wrote it \u2013 and he\u2019s finished this tie. He spreads a terrific pass out to Mahrez, from left to right, then follows it in. So when Mendy shoves out his mate\u2019s shot, he\u2019s on-hand to bury the rebound. Game over. \n\n\n\n 9.15pm  \n\n\u201cLove a player only ever referred to by both names,\u201d tweets Robert Wilson-Fry. \u201cRuel Fox is the OG.\u201d\nAnd an absolute lock for my Headless Chicken XI.\n\nUpdated at 9.15pm GMT\n\n\n 9.13pm  \nGOAL! Man City 1-0 Chelsea (Mahrez 53)\n\nOh, it\u2019s Mahrez it\u2019s Mahrez! He curls inside the near post though, on the far edge of the wall, Koulibaly is its only member who doesn\u2019t jump, and the ball passes over his shoulder. He\u2019ll be hearing about that behaviour, I shouldn\u2019t wonder. \n\n\n\n 9.12pm  \n\nChalobah has just scythed through Mahrez and City have another free-kick just outside the box. Will it be Mahrez, will be be Grealish, we\u2019ll have to wait and see. \n\n\n\n\n 9.11pm  \n\nAt Anfield, Derby are knocking at the door while, at the Etihad, Mendy has had to make a couple more saves. He\u2019s playing well. \n\n\n\n 9.09pm  \n\nCity send on Phillips and Bernardo for Gundogan and Rodri. \n\n\n\n 9.09pm  \n\nOK, I\u2019ve not seen the Brighton goal and it\u2019s a nice one, one and two-touch passing that takes the ball from the right touchline to the left of the box, whereupon Mitoma opens his body and pastes a finish into the far corner. Great stuff. \n\n\n\n 9.06pm  \nGOAL! Arsenal 1-2 Brighton (Mitoma 58)\n\nI\u2019ve not seen this one yet as SSN are on a break, but it\u2019s been scored.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 9.45pm GMT\n\n\n 9.04pm  \n\nWe\u2019re back under way in our two 8pm games\u2026\n\n\n\n 9.03pm  \n\nConte makes three changes, bringing on Kulusevski \u2013 it\u2019s good to see him back \u2013 Gil and Richarlison. Kane \u2013 though his team need goals \u2013 goes off, along with Perisic and Skipp. \n\n\n\n 9.01pm  \nGOAL! Nottingham Forest 2-0 Tottenham Hotspur (Lingard 57)\n\nI didn\u2019t get to print Yash Gupta\u2019s email about Serge Aurier having the game of his life, but his team counter, Aurier crosses to the back post, the ball\u2019s headed back and Lingard heads in for his first Forest goal. Oh, Antonio!\n\n\nUpdated at 9.27pm GMT\n\n\n 9.00pm  \n\nAt Newcastle, Saint-Maximin has just stuck a cross on Burn\u2019s head, but a weak effort into the ground was easily saved. That should\u2019ve been 1-0. \n\n\n\n 8.59pm  \n\n\u201cForest have played better tonight than I have seen them play all season,\u201d says K\u00e1ri Tulinius, \u201cand deserve the lead. The defence had already started to gel, but now the attackers are getting the ball in dangerous areas, with space to create. Considering where they were like in the early weeks of the season, Steve Cooper has worked a miracle.\u201d\nI guess we\u2019ll have to see how it goes over the next bit, but yup, I\u2019d not write off their survival prospects. \n\n\n\n 8.57pm  \n\nAt Forest, Sam Surridge has just had a shot blocked while, at Arsenal, Nketiah has just hit the post. These games seem to have both been pretty good. \n\n\n\n 8.56pm  \n\n\u201cI absolutely agree with you about Crouching Tiger, Hero, and Kill Bill.\u201d says William Preston, another who knows how to get his email printed. \u201cShallower than New Brighton\u2019s beach when the tide is in. And even shallower than that? Shawshank Redemption. Hours of saccharine, two dimensional, cliche-ridden rubbish that seemingly is rewatched and adored by fans in their droves. I\u2019d rather go back in time and rewatch my student housemate\u2019s video of Middlesbrough\u2019s 1996-1997 season, which they described as \u2018their greatest\u2019 every Christmas day for the next twenty years than sit through it again. Wednesday are doing OK, tonight, which is nice.\u201d\nI only recently saw Shawshank. It was a funny one, a cinematic failure but massive video-store hit, and I didn\u2019t hate it, but I was surprised it wasn\u2019t better given how much people loved it. Other hand, if people loved it, it did plenty right. \n\n\n\n 8.54pm  \nLOVELY GOAL! Nottingham Forest 1-0 Tottenham Hotspur (Lodi 50)\n\nConte sent on Bentancur for Hojbjerg at half-time but Forest are still by far the better team and Lodi breaks forward, steps inside onto his right foot, and unfurls a beautifully geometric curler into the far side-netting!\n\n\nUpdated at 9.05pm GMT\n\n\n 8.51pm  \n\nWe\u2019re back underway in our 7.45pm games, and on course for penalties in all six of them \u2013 likewise our two later ones. \n\n\n\n 8.49pm  \nHalf-times in our 8pm kick-offs\n\nLiverpool 0-0 Derby County\nMan City 0-0 Chelsea\n\n\n\n 8.46pm  \n\nAaaarggggh! Lewis Hall finds himself on the left of the box, does beautifully to send Lewis out for a barmcake and actually picks a clever finish, sliding inside the near post \u2026 but Mendy stretches out a leg, and blocks. Had he lifted it, it was a goal. \n\n\n\n 8.43pm  \n\n\u201cTo some Spurs fans who\u2019re wondering what this team is all about,\u201d says Yash Gupta. \u201cWell here\u2019s what I do \u2013 I totally ignore whatever happens in the first half. It is as if that half has been deleted from existence because that for the past month brings out worst football memories of Poch, Jose and Nuno. That certainly helps and I then watch second half with full emotions. So yeah act like a zombie in first half, human in second.\u201d\n\n\n\n 8.39pm  \n\nI should say, if any matches are level at full-time, we go to penalties. I\u2019d say we\u2019ve a decent chance of at least one set. \n\n\n\n 8.36pm  \n\nSo we\u2019ve just got our two 8pm kick-offs now, City 0-0 Chelsea and Liverpool 0-0 Derby. \n\n\n\n 8.36pm  \nMore half-times\n\nWolves 0-0 Leeds\nSouthampton 1-1 Sheffield Wednesday\nWest Ham 1-1 Blackburn\nArsenal 1-1 Brighton\nNewcastle 0-0 Crystal Palace\n\nUpdated at 8.40pm GMT\n\n\n 8.34pm  \nGOAL! Southampton 1-1 Sheffield Wednesday (Ward-Prowse pen 45+2)\n\nI didn\u2019t see what this was given for, but I did see Ward-Prowse drill confidently down the middle as the keeper dived out of the way.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.54pm GMT\n\n\n 8.34pm  \nHalf-time: Nottingham Forest 0-0 Tottenham Hotspur\n\nSpurs have, by all accounts, been useless, and when I wasn\u2019t watching, Jesse Lingard hit the post for Forest. \n\n\n\n 8.32pm  \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re quite right, I think, about Eddie Nketiah,\u201d returns Charles Antaki, who himself has a good sense of how to get his emails published. \u201cPerhaps the fact that he runs about so much works against him; he can look more willing than efficient. And his demeanour doesn\u2019t help either: close-ups sometimes do him no favours in making him look eager and a bit bewildered. But a useful comparison is with the unlamented Alexis Sanchez \u2013 with him the running about was largely for show (especially when on defensive duty), and if he looked mean and single-minded, it was all in the service of, well, Alexis Sanchez.\u201d\nHeh, that\u2019s quite a drive-by. I\u2019d never have though to compare those two. \n\n\n\n 8.31pm  \n\nAlvarez has just passed past the post when handily placed \u2013 he should\u2019ve scored there \u2013 while, at St Mary\u2019s, Barry Bannon is apparently dominating the game. He\u2019s one of those players I really liked the look of when he came through, a proper old-skool schemer, but I guess not quite a good enough one for the top level. However, he\u2019s still got plenty of ability. \n\n\n\n 8.27pm  \n\nChelsea are threatening on the counter, and Ortega has just saved from Pulisic. You\u2019re never going to dominate against City, but Chelsea do need to find a way of getting on the ball more. \n\n\n\n 8.27pm  \nGOAL! West Ham 1-1 Blackburn (Fornals 38)\n\nThat came about because of the best of Michail Antonio. First, he barged a defender off the ball, then a twinkletoed flick behind his own leg allowed him to pull back. He didn\u2019t actually picks out a teammate, but a different defender helpfully knocked it to Fornals, who slammed home.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.37pm GMT\n\n\n 8.23pm  \n\nA City goal looks a matter of time. They\u2019re finding so much space, er, \u201cin and around\u201d the Chelsea defence, and I\u2019m not surprised. 3-4-3 against them is asking for trouble, because you\u2019ll be outnumbered in the middle and out wide, so how are you getting on the ball? \n\n\n\n 8.20pm  \n\nGrealish wins a free-kick on the edge, left edge of the D, and Koulibaly is booked; Gundogan doesn\u2019t get quite enough dip on his effort, flighting just over the top. \n\n\n\n 8.19pm  \n\n\u201cIn the absence of any way to actually watch the Arsenal v Brighton game, \u201c emails Charles Antaki, \u201ccan we give thanks to your photo editor for the image currently at the top of the screen? It shows the Arsenal players practising their Crouching Tiger stance while somebody from Brighton has a go at heading the ball into the net. The keeper seems a bit more alert to the situation, though, and is on a different page from his defenders, taking up the Kangaroo Boxing position, if at some distance from the actual ball. Apparently the ball went out of play, fortunately.\u201d\nI did not get on with that film at all, nor Hero \u2013 nor Kill Bill. There\u2019s only so much of that stuff I can be mithered with without wondering where the plot and gags are at.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.32pm GMT\n\n\n 8.16pm  \n\nChelsea have a chance at the Etihad, but a key touch from Rico Lewis \u2013 who I reckon will become one of those Delealli players who\u2019s always referred to by his first and surname \u2013 means Pulisic\u2019s shot dribbles wide. \n\n\n\n 8.14pm  \nGOAL! Arsenal 1-1 Brighton (Welbeck pen 27)\n\nHein dives to his right and Welbeck passes to his left.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.24pm GMT\n\n\n 8.14pm  \nPENALTY TO BRIGHTON!\n\nPoor old Hein. March puts him through and Welbeck\u2019s touch isn\u2019t the best, so Hein comes, Welbeck shifts it, and Hein takes him out. \n\n\n\n 8.13pm  \nGOAL! Southampton 0-1 Sheffield Wednesday (Windass 24)\n\nThis is a really good finish. Windass is stuck in and, alone on the right of the box, he rams an instafinish inside the near post. Wednesday deserve it too, apparently.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.25pm GMT\n\n\n 8.11pm  \n\nAt the Etihad, City have Chelsea under pressure \u2013 two sots have been blocked, and now Grealish has walloped one just wide of the near post from 20 yards. \n\n\n\n 8.10pm  \n\nI\u2019ve seen Nketiah enduring the wrath of the internet recently, but I don\u2019t get it. He\u2019s not good enough to start, no, but he\u2019s a goalscorer, and such things are hard to find. If\u2019 he\u2019s prepared to sit on the bench and contribute to a team on the up, that\u2019s a result for Arsenal. \n\n\n\n 8.09pm  \nGOAL! Arsenal 1-0 Brighton (Nketiah 20)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gone to Arsenal, to be fair,\u201d insights Clinton Morrison, and it\u2019s a beauty. Reiss Nelson breaks forward unmolested from inside his own half, knocks it wide to Nketiah, and he opens his body to flight a gorgeous finish from not off the corner of the box, inside the far side-netting.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.28pm GMT\n\n\n 8.07pm  \n\nI\u2019m semi-watching the Forest v Spurs game, as it goes, and there\u2019s not been loads going on. Both sides have a few set-pieces, but there\u2019s been very little else. \n\n\n\n 8.05pm  \n\n\u201cAs a life long Spurs supporter,\u201d tweets Alasdair Phillips, \u201cI\u2019ve been struggling with Spurs this season. Watching this game I suddenly had a horrible flashback to Hodgson\u2019s England team. Quite fancy Forest to be Iceland tonight.\u201d\nYes, I keep saying this, but it\u2019s hard to see what Conte\u2019s plan is because I just don\u2019t think he\u2019s bought players good enough to lift them up a level, and wonder if the game has passed him by. Reactive football can still succeed \u2013 Mourinho\u2019s Chelsea would have a shot at the title \u2013 but they had better players and a genius manager at the peak of his powers. Spurs have Kane, Son, and a decent but not exceptional support cast. In particular, the midfield is sorely lacking. \n\n\n\n 8.03pm  \n\nWe\u2019re under way at Anfield and at the Etihad. \n\n\n\n 8.02pm  \n\nAlso on the Wales squad, here\u2019s Matt Dony: \u201cGutted for Rhys Norrington-Davies, but I\u2019m pretty happy with that Wales squad. I\u2019d personally make a few changes, but Rob Page probably has a better handle on football players than I do. (Bet I\u2019m better with Excel, though!) Solid, with a sprinkling of stardust. Very much the modus operandi these days. More than the sum of their parts. It\u2019s going to be interesting.\u201d\nYes, I agree \u2013 gobbing off about the failings of football managers is part of my job, so I\u2019m forever reminding myself that I\u2019d not be taking notes from them so I should endeavour to show some humility when giving them mine. I think Wales have a shot at escaping the group \u2013 USA haven\u2019t been great lately \u2013 but they don\u2019t look to have enough, and the opposition is strong enough, such that I don\u2019t hold out much hope of them shocking any of us. \n\n\n\n 7.59pm  \n\nOh gosh, at Forest, Sessegnon has just extended an arm and knocked the ball behind on the slide. I can see why it\u2019s not been given and actually I don\u2019t mind that penalties aren\u2019t given for that, but in the league, with VAR, I think he\u2019s struggling. \n\n\n\n 7.56pm  \n\n\u201cThat Wales squad,\u201d says Phil Grey. \u201cIf you take away the three newly promoted sides you\u2019re left with Ward (Leicester) and Davies (Spurs) currently playing in the Premier League. Wow.\u201d\nYes, it\u2019s a far cry from the Wales team with which I grew up, that had, variously, Hughes, Rush, Saunders, Giggs, Ratcliffe and Southall \u2026 that qualified for nowt. I guess it\u2019s got easier since then, but it\u2019s also worth noting that \u2013 without hyperbole \u2013 Gareth Bale is up there with the greatest international players of all time. \n\n\n\n 7.54pm  \nGOAL! West Ham 0-1 Blackburn (Vale 6)\n\nBlackburn have, apparently, started really well and I owe an apology \u2013 we see it! I only caught the finish because I wasn\u2019t expecting it, but it was a very nice slot from a one-on-one.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.06pm GMT\n\n\n 7.52pm  \n\n\u201cRegarding your comment about Newcastle fielding a mainly second choice XI,\u201d begins Ben Blatch-Hanlon. \u201cAs well as Saint-Maximin starting there\u2019s also Pope, Burn, Longstaff and Joelinton to make five players who have been first-choice this season, plus Targett who was first-choice left-back in the second half of last season (but who\u2019s been kept out of the team by Burn) and Shelvey who likely would be first choice if he hadn\u2019t been injured until the last couple of weeks. That\u2019s 7seven of the starting lineup, of course it could be stronger but it\u2019s hardly like Eddie Howe has rotated the entire squad or played all kids! We\u2019ve got a big game at home to Chelsea up next this weekend after the long trip down to Southampton the previous one, so not surprising in the grand scheme of things, and seemingly less rotation than most other Premier League teams.\u201d\nYes, fair enough and, I guess, perhaps Howe thought Palace would rotate too.\n\nUpdated at 7.52pm GMT\n\n\n 7.46pm  \n\nWe\u2019re away in our 7.45 kick-offs. How I wish we had a goals show, as we get from BT in the Champions League. But we don\u2019t, so I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll get mainly musings and updates from me watching people watch games. \n\n\n\n 7.43pm  \nSouthampton agree a deal for Luton's Nathan Jones to become their next manager\n\nSo report Sky. \n\n\n\n 7.40pm  \n\nAlso on City, is it too late for Kalvin Phillips to make the World cup squad? My guess is not, because Gareth Southgate likes who he likes and isn\u2019t replete with alternatives. I hope England\u2019s midfield is Declan Rice \u2013 well we know he\u2019ll be in it \u2013 Jude Bellingham and an attacker, but Southgate is conservative, so my guess is he\u2019d prefer Phillips in preference to one of the latter two. \n\n\n\n 7.38pm  \n\nI guess it\u2019s barely news now, which is why I didn\u2019t mention it to begin with, but Cole Palmer also starts for City. He\u2019s looked a talent every time I\u2019ve seen him play, and might be one of the reasons Guardiola was happy to sell Raheem Sterling, who returns to the Etihad for the first time since signing for Chelsea. \n\n\n\n 7.34pm  \n\nFinally, it\u2019s nine changes for Southampton and seven for Sheffield Wednesday; Saints, without a manager, need a win desperately. \n\n\n\n 7.33pm  \n\nSteve Cooper makes nine changes \u2013 a bold move, because even I could\u2019ve told Steve Cooper that Antonio Conte would go strong. All he cares about is winning, and he\u2019ll want to win tonight and this trophy, as well as back himself to make it happen. \n\n\n\n 7.31pm  \n\nMikel Arteta makes 10 changes to the side that beat Chelsea; only William Saliba remains. But there\u2019s a debut for Karl Hein in net, who\u2019d better hope that he never makes a heinous error. \nBrighton do similar \u2013 it\u2019s eight changes for them, but Moises Caicedo and Solly March might give them an edge in midfield. Danny Welbeck plays too, up front against his former club. \n\n\n\n 7.28pm  \n\nGreat news from Newcastle, who welcome back Alain Saint-Maximin. Otherwise, it\u2019s mainly a second XI sent out by Eddie Howe \u2013 I guess he thinks top four is attainable, and in the long term that\u2019s what his club needs and perhaps demands. But I don\u2019t get why, with a break imminent and most of his players not going to the World Cup, he\u2019s not doing all he can to try and win a trophy. \nPalace, meanwhile, don\u2019t even bring Eberechi Eze and Wilfried Zaha \u2013 I don\u2019t know why not, because they\u2019re not going to get the top four and probably not Europe either, nor are they going down, so why not go all out for this? Still, the beautiful Michael Olise starts, so for that we can all be thankful. \n\n\n\n 7.25pm  \n\nSteve Davis, Wolves manager for another five days, gives a debut start to Joe Hodge, while Leeds make 10 changes, with Jack Harrison the sole survivor from their uplifting comeback win at Boyrnemouth. \n\n\n\n 7.22pm  \n\nAs for Chelsea, Danis Zakaria, who scored last week, is in again, while Lewis Hall, who\u2019s just 18, makes his first start \u2013 so I\u2019m excited to see what he\u2019s got. \n\n\n\n 7.21pm  \n\nPep Guardiola, though, goes pretty strong. He includes seven senior players \u2013 and Rico Lewis, who scored such a beautiful goal on debut against Sevilla last week. City also have loads on the bench, Haaland, and De Bruyne among them \u2013 and, I\u2019m delighted to report, Kalvin Phillips, who\u2019s coming back from injury. \n\n\n\n 7.19pm  \n\nWest Ham and Blackburn both change everyone; I guess it makes sense, given Blackburn want promotion, while West Ham have Europe and plenty on the bench if things aren\u2019t going their way. \n\n\n\n 7.18pm  \n\nI note from Twitter that Ben Doak is on the Liverpool bench. He\u2019s only 16, and I\u2019ve seen bits and pieces of him playing for the youth team \u2013 he looks very serious. \n\n\n\n 7.17pm  \n\nJ\u00fcrgen Klopp wins the changes prize \u2013 he makes 111 of them. It\u2019s great to see Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain on from the start, and I\u2019ve been really impressed with Fabio Carvalho. Derby, meanwhile, make just the one alteration, Conor Hourihane for Lewis Dobbin. \n\n\n\n 7.14pm  \nWales announce their World Cup squad!\n\nGoalkeepers:Wayne Hennessey (Nottingham Forest), Danny Ward (Leicester City), Adam Davies (Stoke City).\nDefenders: Neco Williams (Nottingham Forest), Ben Davies (Tottenham Hotspur), Ben Cabango (Swansea City), Joe Rodon (Rennes, on loan from Tottenham Hotspur), Chris Mepham (Bournemouth), Ethan Ampadu (Spezia, on loan from Chelsea), Chris Gunter (AFC Wimbledon), Connor Roberts (Burnley), Tom Lockyer (Luton Town).\nMidfielders: Aaron Ramsey (Nice), Joe Allen (Swansea City), Harry Wilson (Fulham), Joe Morrell (Portsmouth), Dylan Levitt (Dundee United), Rubin Colwill (Cardiff City), Jonny Williams (Swindon Town), Matthew Smith (Milton Keynes Dons), Sorba Thomas (Huddersfield Town).\nForwards: Gareth Bale (Los Angeles FC), Dan James (Fulham, on loan from Leeds United), Kieffer Moore (Bournemouth), Mark Harris (Cardiff City), Brennan Johnson (Nottingham Forest).\n\n\n\n 7.12pm  \n\nThere\u2019s a lot to digest as regards these teams, so let\u2019s see how we get on. But in the meantime, you can follow Scott\u2019s Man City v Chelsea blog here: \n\n\n\n\n 7.03pm  \nArsenal v Brighton &amp; Hove Albion teams\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 7.02pm  \nManchester City v Chelsea teams\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 7.01pm  \nLiverpool v Derby County teams\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 6.56pm  \n\nFor some reason we don\u2019t yet have the Arsenal side but bear with me and them \u2013 it\u2019s en route. \n\n\n\n 6.55pm  \nWest Ham United v Blackburn Rovers teams\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 6.53pm  \nSouthampton v Sheffield Wednesday teams\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 6.52pm  \nWolverhampton Wanderers v Leeds United teams\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 6.50pm  \nNottingham Forest v Tottenham Hotspur teams\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 6.48pm  \nNewcastle United v Crystal Palace teams\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 6.45pm  \nPreamble\n\nEvening all, and welcome to your Carabao Cup round three clockwatch \u2013 there\u2019s fair bit going on tonight, so let\u2019s get to it.\nThe most resonant game, Manchester City v Chelsea, you can follow next door with Scott Murray, but Chelsea \u2013 and Graham Potter in particular \u2013 will be desperate for a performance having lost at home to Arsenal on Sunday. City, though, won this trophy in each of the four seasons prior to this one, so won\u2019t be letting the tie go to pursue other goals.\nElsewhere, we\u2019ve got got four all-Premier League encounters: Wolves v Leeds, Arsenal v Brighton, Forest v Spurs and Newcastle v Palace, though we won\u2019t have much idea of how they\u2019ll go prior to seeing who\u2019s resting whom. But the last of those, in particular looks tasty, clubs in good nick and decent form who should really be trying to win the thing.\nAns otherwise, the holders Liverpool are at home to Derby; Sheffield Wednesday, riding high in League One, will fancy themselves away to managerless Southampton; and Blackburn, second in the Championship, have a chance of shocking West Ham, another side who should be targeting the trophy \u2013 especially if David Moyes rotates.\nAll of which is a longwinded way of saying you\u2019d best stick with me, because this has all the makings of an extremely fun night of association football.\nKick-offs:\nWolverhampton Wanderers v Leeds United, Arsenal v Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, Nottingham Forest v Spurs, Newcastle United v Crystal Palace, Southampton v Sheffield Wednesday, West Ham United v Blackburn Rovers \u2013 7.45pm GMT\nManchester City v Chelsea, Liverpool v Derby County \u2013 8pm GMT\n\n"

                    "body": "Stephen Colbert The Late Show host began by expressing delight over the US team\u2019s win over Iran at the World Cup: \u201cIt was win or go home, and we won, baby!\u201d Colbert called it a \u201ctense and thrilling match\u201d and felt comfortable about the team\u2019s next game opposite the Netherlands. \u201cOh, we can take the Dutch. I assume they play in clogs,\u201d he said.  Colbert joked that it was \u201cgreat news for US soccer fans. They get to stay in Qatar and enjoy all the magic.\u201d He then said he was \u201cmoving on to less important contests \u2026 the midterms\u201d before detailing how Republican officials missed a deadline for filing results in an Arizona county after complaining about missing votes. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you love the second amendment so much, because you keep shooting yourself in the foot,\u201d he said. Former president Donald Trump wrote that \u201cKari Lake should be installed as governor of Arizona\u201d despite losing. \u201cShe\u2019s not an HVAC system,\u201d Colbert replied. He then moved on to Trump\u2019s widely criticised dinner with Kanye West and the white supremacist Nick Fuentes, calling them both \u201ccreeps\u201d and saying that \u201cit\u2019s his most upsetting meal since every other meal.\u201d Colbert quickly spoke about China\u2019s zero Covid policy, which has continued with extreme lockdowns. He called it \u201ca stark contrast to America\u2019s policy: everyone gets Covid\u201d. Finally he spoke about Prince William and Kate heading to Boston, their first time in the US in eight years, which has been referred to as \u201ctheir Super Bowl\u201d by royal staffers. Colbert joked that they would be met by the city\u2019s own royal couple: \u201cMark Wahlberg in The Departed and Mark Wahlberg in Ted.\u201d Trevor Noah  On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah also spoke about Trump\u2019s dinner with Fuentes, \u201ca prominent white supremacist\u201d, and said that \u201cwe don\u2019t know exactly what happened at that dinner except that nobody ordered latkes.\u201d He then played footage of various Republicans criticising Trump for hosting two neo-Nazis. \u201cIt\u2019s so funny to watch Republicans try to chastise Trump for hanging out with someone who has the exact same views as him without chastising Trump for having those views,\u201d he said. Noah said he was \u201cwilling to believe\u201d that Trump didn\u2019t know how extreme Fuentes is but \u201cit says a lot about him that he enjoyed this man\u2019s company and everything that he had to say\u201d. He added that while it is \u201cnice to see Republican officials speak out against Trump for a change\u201d, there tends to be a predictable formula. He said they \u201cget mad for a little while\u201d but \u201cget back together with him in the end\u201d, adding that \u201cTrump scandals are basically like Hallmark movies \u2026 except Trump never actually changes and becomes a better person.\u201d Jimmy Kimmel  On Jimmy Kimmel Live!, the host spoke about Herschel Walker running neck and neck with the incumbent Democrat Raphael Warnock in the Georgia Senate runoff. Kimmel said that Republicans have been \u201cpulling out all the stops\u201d and that \u201cTed Cruz and Lindsey Graham have spent more time with him than he spent with all of his children combined.\u201d He moved on to Mike Lindell, the MyPillow chief who has thrown \u201chis tin foil hat into the ring\u201d to become the new head of the RNC but who has the \u201ctendency to make big announcements that never pan out\u201d. Kimmel said that \u201cyou do have to admire his crack-headed optimism\u201d, but he is being sued for $1.3bn by Dominion and is \u201calmost certainly gonna lose\u201d so \u201cneeds to think of higher-paying jobs like being an art thief or being Beyonce\u0301\u201d. Kimmel did express concern for what will happen to Lindell\u2019s main gig: pillows. \u201cDonald Trump will have nothing to scream into at night,\u201d he joked. Trump is \u201cbigly upset\u201d about the investigation into classified documents he took and his part in the January 6 insurrection and is blaming special counsel Jack Smith in a recent online rant. In the same rant, though, he also admitted to taking the documents \u201copenly and transparently\u201d. Kimmel said that it wasn\u2019t \u201ca defence, it\u2019s a confession\u201d and \u201cmaybe we don\u2019t need a special counsel \u2013 he just closed the case himself.\u201d He added: \u201cTrump is so scared of Jack Smith, you\u2019d think he was a windmill.\u201d"

                    "body": "\u201cI feel like a kid in a new school, meeting all my new friends for the first time,\u201d Michael Cheika says, smiling. The former Wallabies coach is in Manchester where his Lebanon team are preparing for the Rugby League World Cup, and the 55-year-old Australian is beginning his month-long flirtation with the 13-man code. Some individuals switch codes for money. Others do it to further their careers. Cheika, one of the most recognisable rugby coaches on the planet, isn\u2019t interested in either. His brief transition into the world of rugby league is much more personal and far more emotional.  Cheika was born and raised in Sydney, where there is an enormous Lebanese community. He played rugby league as a junior growing up with Sydney Roosters, and the game was his first love before going on to forge a successful career as a player and coach in union. He has considered switching back to league on numerous occasions, but the timing and the opportunity has never been right. Until now. Cheika\u2019s parents are Lebanese immigrants and when Lebanon\u2019s rugby federation approached him about coaching the Cedars at the World Cup, originally set for last year before the 12-month postponement, he could not resist, even though he is currently employed as the head coach of Argentina\u2019s union team, the Pumas. \u201cIt was too good to say no to,\u201d he says. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d be able to represent my family\u2019s heritage in this way. I\u2019m incredibly proud of my Lebanese roots, as are my entire family. My old man isn\u2019t here anymore, he passed away, but my mum will be glued to the games I\u2019m sure, and really proud that our family is doing something to try and put a smile on the faces of the people of Lebanon.\u201d Lebanon are in a group with New Zealand, Ireland and tournament debutants Jamaica. It is a pool many expect them to qualify from given the NRL talent Cheika has been able to call on. But there is a much more important priority for the new Cedars coach than winning games. \u201cIt\u2019s not even about that first and foremost, it\u2019s about the fact Lebanon is there, on the world stage,\u201d he says. \u201cGiving the people of Lebanon the chance to have an hour or two free of the worries that they face on a daily basis. They\u2019ll see their colours, the cedar tree, their players trying to make Lebanon proud. We\u2019re a proud nation and Lebanese sport doesn\u2019t really get many moments in the spotlight like this. To take their worries away, even for just a few hours, and give them something to smile about means a lot to me.\u201d  Cheika insists that there are sufficient similarities between the two codes which makes a short-term switch feasible. He will, however, be relying on the experience of Australian rugby league stalwarts Matt King and Robbie Farah in his coaching staff before Lebanon\u2019s first game of the tournament against the 2008 champions, New Zealand, in Warrington on Sunday. How far can Lebanon go? Cheika is relaxed about that. \u201cOne thing I\u2019ve learned from being involved in Rugby World Cups with Australia is that you don\u2019t look too far ahead,\u201d he admits. \u201cLook too far ahead and you\u2019re missing enjoying the moment of what is happening right now. We, Lebanon, are playing against the world ranked No 1 side on Sunday. It\u2019s a once in a lifetime opportunity for lots of us.\u201d It is clear that family, and his feelings towards the Lebanese people, are at the heart of this move for Cheika. \u201cThey have always supported me throughout my life, and I think my mum will be Lebanon\u2019s biggest fan for the next few weeks,\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s really taken all of this to heart, as have the Lebanese communities in Australia. \u201cIf you\u2019d seen the send-off the team got when they left for England, it was like they were leaving home forever. But they\u2019re heroes to the Lebanese people. Lebanon is a huge part of my life; I class myself as Australian-Lebanese and to be part of such an amazing tournament with the nation is incredible. It\u2019s really something I never thought I\u2019d get to do given my commitments elsewhere.\u201d There is one problem for Cheika to consider, though. Should Lebanon get out of Group C, their quarter-final will take place on the same weekend his Argentina side face England at Twickenham. Could he realistically coach two nations, in two different sports, just days apart? \u201cI tell you something \u2026 that would be a fun week,\u201d he says, smiling again. \u201cWe\u2019ll find a way. The talks have been held already about that so there\u2019s no problem there. If it happens, then it\u2019s a good problem to have but all parties know the situation. It\u2019ll be a busy few days, but an enjoyable few days.\u201d"

Her total of six goals makes her joint top scorer with Beth Mead and has taken her to a career total of 59 goals in 119 international games. All that at a time when the men\u2019s team have struggled to find a goalscorer.\n\nOn Friday she sat down before the media and pulled off her Covid mask to reveal a moustache underneath. \u201cHello,\u201d she said in an exaggeratedly deep voice before falling about laughing. \u201cI\u2019m Alexander,\u201d she said. Alongside her, teammate Kathy Hendrich cracked up, saying: \u201cIt suits you.\u201d\n\u201cThe German Football Association has good physios with kinesio tape: I quickly cut my moustache from it,\u201d Popp said, looking a little like Homer Simpson playing Guy Incognito. \u201cI think this [joke] fits with the mood in the team,\u201d she added. \u201cThe final on Sunday will be intense mentally and physically,\u201d Popp said, having by now taken off her moustache, but there was no sign of nerves.\n\n\u201cI think the pressure is more on the English side, precisely because it takes place in their own country,\u201d Popp said, recalling their experience of hosting the World Cup, when they were knocked out in the quarter-finals. \u201cWe know that from 2011: suddenly everyone expects something from you. We have nothing left to lose and we have an attitude with which we can go into the game completely free.\u201d\nInspiration for the joke had come with comments on social media and elsewhere, with the satirical website Der Postillon among many to compare her favourably with the men\u2019s team, publishing a spoof article headlined: \u201cHansi Flick chooses newcomer Alexander Papp for the Nationalmannschaft.\u201d\n\nThe article ran a photo of Popp with a moustache added, asking: \u201cis this young man the missing piece in the jigsaw for Qatar?\u201d It began: \u201cNational coach Hansi Flick surprisingly called up previously unknown striker Alexander Papp. \u2018Everyone knows that we have had big problems in the striker position in the past,\u2019 Flick said. \u2018We want to start a new chapter with Alexandra, er, Alexander. She, er, he, has excellent positional play, a fantastic nose for goals and is ice cold when finishing. She just has one thing to do in England first.\u2019\u201d\nThere was one problem, Popp said on Friday: when the men\u2019s World Cup comes round in November, she will still be competing in the Champions League with her club, Wolfsburg."

                    "body": "Good morning. The Ukrainian city of Kherson has been under Russian occupation since the start of the war in February. That was the case until earlier this week when Russia\u2019s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, ordered his troops to withdraw from the west bank of the Dnipro river, an area that includes Kherson city, as they were at risk of encirclement. Ukrainian troops have been capturing villages on the way to Kherson for weeks, so the retreat is a significant win for Kyiv in the battle for the south of the country. However, Ukrainian officials have cautioned against celebrating too soon, and remain sceptical as to whether Russian forces have actually left the area. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said: \u201cThe enemy does not give us gifts, does not make goodwill gestures, we win it all.\u201d Regardless of how tentative the situation is, Russia\u2019s purported withdrawal is one of the biggest moments in the war since Ukraine\u2019s offensive in Kharkiv in September. It\u2019s both a symbolic and tactical defeat. I spoke to Peter Beaumont, a senior foreign correspondent at the Guardian, about what this retreat means for the future of the war. That\u2019s right after the headlines. Five big stories  Politics | Kwasi Kwarteng has said that he told Liz Truss to \u201cslow down\u201d her economic plans. The ex-chancellor has also criticised Truss for dismissing him six weeks into the job for not implementing her tax cutting agenda. Strikes | The UK is set to face a new wave of strikes as civil servants and train drivers vote for industrial action. Nearly 100,000 civil servants from multiple government departments have voted to strike because of disputes over pay, pensions and job security. Democracy | Officials have warned government ministers that if they do not delay their plans to roll out mandatory voter ID checks in May 2023\u2019s local elections, thousands of people could become disfranchised, inevitably swaying some results. Education | Teachers have said that children who are not eligible for free school meals are coming to school with mouldy bread, empty wraps and sometimes with nothing at all. These accounts come as analysis by the Liberal Democrats found that 100,000 children in England may be missing out on free school meals. Germany | The fast food chain KFC has apologised after sending a message to German customers that encouraged them to commemorate Kristallnacht, the 1938 anti-Jewish pogrom, with fried chicken and melted cheese.  In depth: \u2018This is a moment for optimism\u2019  Russian billboards in Kherson that read \u201cRussia is here forever\u201d are an embarrassing reminder of the Kremlin\u2019s hubris at the start of the war. The announcement that Russia\u2019s troops will be pulled out of the city is a decisive moment in Ukraine\u2019s counter-offensive which started at the end of August. But how did Russia get to this point \u2013 and what\u2019s next? *** What has happened so far Things have not been going well for Russia for a while. In September, Ukraine launched a stunning military offensive that liberated the north-eastern region of Kharkiv. Since then, Russia has suffered a series of losses as Ukrainian forces advance in the south of the country. The total number of Russian military casualties in this war has exceeded the number of deaths during the country\u2019s war in Afghanistan. For context, Afghanistan was a 10-year war; Russia has been in Ukraine for less than a year. Russia\u2019s conscripts have had to buy their own armour and clothing, and the army has been losing 10 tanks a day on average since early September. Ukrainian troops have also been gaining ground, liberating villages in the region and moving towards the west bank of the Dnipro, leaving Russian forces vulnerable and exposed. This is all while political discontent grows on the home front in Russia. *** Why is Kherson important? A port city bordering Crimea, it gave Russia access to the Black Sea peninsula and provided a crucial land corridor to the annexed region. Before the war, the lack of land access to Crimea spurred Putin to spend $4bn building the Crimean Bridge across the Kerch Strait (the bridge was damaged in an explosion in early October). In the early phases of the invasion, troops based in Crimea flooded to south Ukraine through Kherson. The city was Moscow\u2019s only major foothold in that region of the country; without it Russian troops could be surrounded. There is also a canal in the city that was blocked by Ukraine in 2014 from providing fresh water to Crimea, which cost the Kremlin hundreds of millions of dollars. Upon seizing the city earlier this year, Russia unblocked the canal. No doubt it will be blocked again soon. But despite this strategic importance, Russia has had to retreat because Ukraine\u2019s offensives in the other parts of the country have meant that its military capacity has been stretched: \u201cThe nature of the position of Kherson and the continuing ability of the Ukrainians to disrupt important Russian logistics meant that they were genuinely in danger of having a lot of troops stuck on the wrong side of the Dnipro river, which is why it makes military sense for them to reorganise and withdraw,\u201d Peter says. \u201cBut politically this is humiliating. This was the only major regional capital that the Russians held, and now they are preparing to give it up.\u201d *** The next phase Despite Russia\u2019s announcement, Ukrainian officials are wary of rushing into what could feasibly be a trap. Instead, they have continued with their offensive operation of closing in from all corners. Just yesterday Ukrainian troops captured a key town north-west of Kherson and are reportedly nearing the outskirts of the city. Peter explains that this withdrawal \u201chas not happened, it is happening\u201d, so it may take a while for Russian forces to clear out. Ukraine\u2019s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said it would take at least a week for Russia to completely pull out of Kherson, adding that Moscow still has 40,000 troops in the region. Either way, Ukrainian officials have said that they are potentially days away from entering the city. If (or when depending on who you speak to) they do capture Kherson, Putin will probably retaliate in a brutal way by escalating his bombardment on energy and water infrastructure which would have devastating effects as Ukraine heads into winter. \u201cUkraine is an extremely cold country, and leaving people without heat and light will have deadly consequences,\u201d Peter says. This defeat will also likely further erode Putin\u2019s popularity in Russia, which has been declining since the introduction of the controversial partial mobilisation. However humiliating this moment may be for Russia, there is no indication that the war will end any time soon. This is likely a tactic to regroup and train up more soldiers to put Russia\u2019s army in a better position by the end of the winter. \u201cThis is a moment for optimism but my thought is that the war is going to last a while yet,\u201d Peter says.

                    "body": "Aldi has revealed a steep drop in UK profits but said that customers were switching to the discount supermarket chain \u201cin their droves\u201d from higher-cost rivals as the cost of living crisis bites and shoppers look for lower prices. The German-owned retailer said that 1.5 million extra customers had visited its UK stores over the past 12 weeks, even as it revealed annual pre-tax profits for 2021 slumped to \u00a336m, compared with \u00a3265m in 2020 \u2013 an 86% decline. Supermarket profits held up during the coronavirus pandemic, with essential retailers allowed to remain open throughout even if lockdowns caused them to bear extra costs. In 2021, however, Aldi said profits were hit by a bigger wage bill and its efforts to keep prices lower, as well as continued pandemic-related costs. Giles Hurley, Aldi\u2019s chief executive, said the company was not \u201cimmune from the challenges\u201d 2021 had presented. Yet the company sees an opportunity to grow its market share during the cost of living crisis. \u201cShoppers are shifting in their droves and coming to Aldi,\u201d Hurley said. He said lower prices were the key factor, while customers were increasingly looking for cheaper own-label versions of product rather than more expensive brands. Hurley said it was an \u201cunprecedented move\u201d. Aldi, which does not stock many external brands, said there had been a 20% increase in sales of its own-label baby brand, and steep increases in sales of its beauty, meat and poultry products as well. Earlier this month Aldi overtook Morrisons to become the UK\u2019s fourth largest supermarket for the first time, behind only Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda in terms of market share, according to data from the market research company Kantar. Hurley said, however, that the \u201cbig four\u201d was \u201ca club we\u2019ll never be part of\u201d, with \u201cbig shop floors, big brands and big prices, frankly\u201d. When asked if the company would consider running at a loss to stay cheaper than competitors, he said: \u201cWe\u2019ll do whatever it takes. Price is the cornerstone of our business. It\u2019s unbreakable.\u201d Analysts are this year looking warily ahead to the Christmas period, traditionally the \u201cgolden quarter\u201d for retail sales. The Bank of England said last week the UK was already in recession, and consumers are expected to have less to spend because of inflation \u2013 which could be worsened by a record low for the pound against the dollar on Monday \u2013 and rising interest rates. Hurley said it was difficult to predict how Christmas would pan out in part because of the unusual timing of football\u2019s World Cup, due to take place in winter for the first time because of the climate in the host country, Qatar. \u201cIf one of the home nations performs it could make for a really interesting celebration,\u201d Hurley said. \u201cI\u2019m actually very confident that the public will celebrate this Christmas.\u201d"

Matthijs was a lovely surprise for Bareman and her husband but, now that she is juggling both him and Fifa\u2019s teams for the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup, her respect for footballers returning to the field after giving birth has reached the realms of the almost unthinkable.  She is talking about those like Katrina Gorry, who had her daughter last year and has played her way back into the Matildas\u2019 starting XI. Ditto some of the women who contested July\u2019s Oceania World Cup qualifiers. Papua New Guinea, for instance, had seven mums help their country to the upcoming intercontinental playoffs. \u201cThere were three or four mums in the Samoan team,\u201d she says. \u201cI can\u2019t even get out of bed some days, and these mums are playing for the national team.

It also fell in line with the International Labour Organisation\u2019s minimum 14 weeks of paid maternity leave, with at least eight weeks after birth, at two-thirds of their contracted salary. The news was positive, but also met with concern that these minimum standards have been set too low. Bareman, as Fifa\u2019s first chief women\u2019s football officer, realises they are the \u201cbasics, a first step\u201d. She is also aware, from her decade of working in a male-dominated industry so often averse to progressive change, that to make it happen requires tact and patience. \u201cThere\u2019s a very broad range of things that need to be done across women\u2019s sport to grow it en masse,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd sometimes the quick-fix solutions are not always there. For me, you get far more back, in the end, from a strategic, long-term approach, than a lot of quick fixes.\u201d The World Cup, Bareman says, underlines the incongruity of the global women\u2019s football landscape. Between a larger-than-ever tournament (quite literally \u2013 it has expanded from 24 to 32 teams) featuring top nations booming off a flood of investment and the raging success of France 2019 and this year\u2019s Euros, and the rest still floundering at the other end of a yawning economic chasm. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the biggest challenges in Fifa and in women\u2019s football,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause when we have these incredible moments like the Woman\u2019s World Cup, when everybody\u2019s watching and we\u2019re on the front page of all the major newspapers, that comes with big expectations. \u201cBut I\u2019m in this position in Fifa where I also see what the reality is for the vast majority of the rest of our member countries and, unfortunately for them, it\u2019s not near that level yet. \u201cExpectation is in the nature of our stakeholders, the fans, the players and the people involved in the game. I think that\u2019s good. It pushes us, our member associations and the clubs to deliver more. But there\u2019s not always, shall we say, the appetite or patience for the longer-term fix.\u201d The message is that the World Cup is not just about the high-profile games played at big stadiums, but also a means of expediting development. An example is Morocco. The country failed to qualify for the 2019 tournament, but the president of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation was one of 60,000 in attendance at the final in Lyon, and was moved to upscale the country\u2019s development structures. That November, the first domestic women\u2019s league was launched and this year, under the tutelage for former Olympique Lyonnais manager, Reynald Pedros, they hosted and made the final of the Women\u2019s Africa Cup of Nations, and have now qualified for their first World Cup. For 2023 co-hosts, Australia and New Zealand, there are different challenges. The popularity of football in both countries is high in terms of grassroots participation but, barring widespread support the national teams, top domestic leagues struggle to breach the public consciousness of fans amid the cross-code crowd of men\u2019s and women\u2019s rugby, league and AFL. There is also a lesson to be heeded from the men\u2019s 2015 Asian Cup, which Ange Postecoglou\u2019s Australia won on home soil in a headline-making moment administrators failed to sufficiently seize. \u201cThat is exactly why next year\u2019s World Cup has got to be leveraged by all the stakeholders in the game,\u201d Bareman says. \u201cMy message to everyone involved in the game at every level is that they should be looking at it as an opportunity to boost it. This is an unbeatable moment to leverage.\u201d We have to talk about ticket sales, because that is why we are here. Organisers say that, in the first day of presale, they sold more than France did in the entire first week of sales. For them it is a big indicator one week out from next Saturday\u2019s draw in Auckland. We also have to talk about women\u2019s rights in Qatar, an issue which \u2013 alongside LGBT rights \u2013 is receiving less international attention amid concerns over the exploitation of migrant workers by the 2022 men\u2019s World Cup host nation. On this she will not be drawn, but does have some things to say about the independent report released this month which found sexual misconduct and emotional abuse is \u201csystemic\u201d in the US National Women\u2019s Soccer League? \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t normally say a lot before those sort of things come out,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I have to say as a person, but also as a representative of Fifa, that type of abuse, harassment and discrimination absolutely has no place in football, full stop. And in the women\u2019s game it\u2019s something becoming more and more prevalent. We have a zero-tolerance policy around this type of stuff. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame when you see the game on the trajectory it\u2019s on \u2013 the incredible momentum we have \u2013 and then stories come out like what we\u2019ve seen in the States. For me it\u2019s quite heartbreaking. If it takes these high-profile cases like what we see happening in the NWSL to empower other women in those situations to speak up, then let it happen. Let it come out because that\u2019s the only way we\u2019ll be able to get rid of it.\u201d *** Bareman grew up on rugby as a New Zealander with a Dutch father and Samoan mother, and it wasn\u2019t until she sought a connection with her mother\u2019s homeland that she jumped from playing club football in Auckland to representing the national team in Samoa. As a banking and finance expert, she was hired as Football Federation Samoa\u2019s finance manager and then its chief executive between 2011 and 2014, rehabilitating the association after its suspension by Fifa for the previous administration\u2019s misuse of funds. \u201cIt was the first position where I really experienced a level of discrimination because of my gender,\u201d she says. \u201cSamoa is an incredible place. I love it. It\u2019s my home. I plan to retire there one day. But the football environment there is also very male-dominated, society in general is quite, what\u2019s the right word? Patriarchal. \u201cThat was more than 10 years ago. Now there\u2019s a female prime minister there, so things are definitely changing. But also culturally, although I have Samoan blood I couldn\u2019t speak the language when I arrived, so a lot of people wrote me off before they even knew me and before I\u2019d even done any work. You\u2019re an outsider, and there were moments where I had to close my office door and take a breath, and maybe sometimes shed a few tears, to overcome certain things.\u201d In 2014, when she returned to Auckland to take up a new role as deputy secretary general of the Oceania Football Confederation, she stepped straight into the fallout of corruption allegations that rocked world football. \u201cBack in 2015 there was some very high-profile arrests and things in Zurich,\u201d she says, in reference to the infamous police raid on a string of Fifa officials on corruption charges over the awarding of the men\u2019s 2018 and 2022 World Cups. \u201cThe organisation went through a really dark time. What\u2019s unique with me is that I was actually part of the reform journey.\u201d Bareman was appointed as the only woman on the Fifa reforms committee, \u201cwhich would become an ongoing theme\u201d. She advocated for more women in decision-making roles within the governing body. \u201cI remember specifically saying, \u2018if there were more women in high positions within Fifa I don\u2019t think we would be in the position where we are today, sitting here having to make a reform package\u2019.\u201d By early 2016 she was one of those women in a high position, sitting behind a desk and overseeing 211 member associations \u2013 albeit at the aforementioned gradual pace. And when she recounts the trying experiences it took to get there, she speaks with a fresh authenticity which feels very un-Fifa-like. \u201cMaybe some of the men wrote me off before they even knew me,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I made 100% sure that, in every single meeting I went into on every single project I rolled out, that I had my research and I knew everything from A to Z. So maybe you think [because] I\u2019m a woman I don\u2019t belong here, but this speaks for itself.\u201d"

                    "body": "\u201cI was always very fond of the ball and I was definitely a No 10,\u201d Lise Klaveness says as she describes the kind of football she played while winning 73 caps for Norway. \u201cI had played as a No 6 but I didn\u2019t like it. I wanted to play with risk. So the coaches ended up playing me as an offensive midfielder because I had a high appetite for risk.\u201d The 41-year-old Klaveness is also a lawyer and a judge who, as the president of Norway\u2019s FA, made a blistering speech at Fifa\u2019s congress in Doha last March when she demanded that football leaders support migrant workers in Qatar, protect LGBTQ+ fans at the World Cup and make the game open to all. As a gay woman, happily married to former Norway international Ingrid Fosse S\u00e6thre, Klaveness could have been jailed under Qatari law but, as she points out, she was at little risk personally.  Klaveness is now trying to win a seat on the Uefa executive committee at a time when, as the recent independent report into last year\u2019s near-catastrophic Champions League final showed, the European governing body is in crisis and lacking moral leadership. But she has taken the riskier option by deciding not to contest the quota seat for women. Instead, in the April election, Klaveness will stand against male administrators in a bid to win one of seven open places. Florence Hardouin, of France, occupies the quota position but Klaveness says: \u201cI would find it demotivating to block another woman. I got a lot of advice that I should go for the female seat, that it\u2019s a lower threshold [and easier to win], but it is crucial for me to walk the walk.\u201d Klaveness accepts that her chances of a successful election have been drastically reduced by her ethical decision. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult but I will still try. People tell me it\u2019s too difficult, and that I am impatient, but to me it\u2019s a responsibility because I can help a lot of countries with development of girls\u2019 and women\u2019s football and the building of stronger grassroots clubs.\u201d Her considerable experience includes being world football\u2019s only female technical director in charge of both national men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams. As Norway\u2019s technical director from 2018 to 2022, Klaveness worked with Erling Haaland, Martin \u00d8degaard and Ada Hegerberg \u2013 three of Europe\u2019s leading footballers. \u201cI come from the technical side. Even when I was asked to be a TV pundit on the women\u2019s side I said immediately: \u2018I also have to work with men\u2019s football.\u2019 So I did the Premier League, the men\u2019s World Cup and women\u2019s football. \u201cTo me it\u2019s always been very important that the men\u2019s and women\u2019s games are not working against each other. And when I had the privilege to lead the men\u2019s and women\u2019s national teams I got great operational experience. This is one of the big reasons why I run for exco. The game for men and women is very split and it\u2019s useful to have, as you say in English, a foot in both camps.\u201d  Klaveness is also strong in advocating the sustainability of grassroots football and helping those on the margins of a moneyed game. \u201cWhen you\u2019re so big,\u201d she says of Europe\u2019s elite powerbrokers, \u201cyou have power to exclude as well. So we need leaders who want to make football inclusive for all. We will lose all moral authority if we don\u2019t do this in these very geopolitical, distressing times.\u201d Her intelligence, proficiency and moral conscience are obvious. And so it is disappointing when Klaveness is reluctant to discuss last week\u2019s devastating report into the chaos of the 2022 Champions League final which put thousands of lives at risk at the Stade de France. I have to pressure her to comment on a report which Uefa itself commissioned. Of course it is politically expedient not to heap further condemnation on the governing body in the midst of her election campaign, but Klaveness agrees in a second interview that we need to address the findings which concluded that Uefa bears \u201cprimary responsibility\u201d for the glaring organisational and safety failings that so nearly caused disaster. Klaveness was outside the stadium that night. \u201cIt was almost like we were in this trap,\u201d she remembers. \u201cWe had to carry older people over a fence. It was traumatic and we saw the space where supporters were pressed in that area. It was a bit out of control and everyone was relieved that lives were not lost. So I was not surprised that Uefa and the host made errors. You saw it with your own eyes. But from the conversations I\u2019ve had with [Uefa] it seems like they are acknowledging those mistakes and trying to analyse what happened.\u201d What does Klaveness make of the report\u2019s damning central allegation that Uefa has \u201cmarginalised\u201d its own safety and security unit, which has been headed since 2021 by Zeljko Pavlica, a close friend of the organisation\u2019s president, Aleksander Ceferin? The report found that the unit played no effective part in the planning or operation of the final. \u201cThe whole report is of course disturbing,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019m not in a position to pass judgment on that personally. It\u2019s very important that Uefa analyse the report and answer these points. I will wait for that.\u201d When we spoke for the first time, before reading the report, I asked Klaveness if Ceferin\u2019s choice of Pavlica suggested that Uefa was rife with cronyism. She switched to a different subject. \u201cThe way I look at it is that Ceferin was very strong in the Super League discussion. It was crucial for the smaller countries and for the whole model of European football.\u201d Surely plans for a Super League were crushed by fans across Europe rather than by Ceferin? \u201cIt was definitely a grassroots riot which shows you that all power is not where the money is,\u201d Klaveness concedes. \u201cBut Uefa and Ceferin acted very decisively.\u201d Yet an absence of any leadership challenge to Ceferin in the April elections is scandalous \u2013 especially when he is ultimately responsible for Uefa and its showpiece event of the Champions League final. The report describes the way in which Uefa\u2019s leaders tried to avoid accountability as \u201creprehensible\u201d. \u201cOne of the most important things in the report was how [Liverpool] supporters were [wrongly] blamed,\u201d Klaveness agrees. \u201cThat was horrible and the first mistake was to blame supporters. Uefa apologised to supporters and that\u2019s good.\u201d  Pressed on the need to acknowledge Ceferin\u2019s accountability, Klaveness is careful: \u201cI\u2019m not saying nobody should be held accountable but I come from the position of being a lawyer and a judge. There is media interest that we throw out names now because in the end people will be accountable. But it\u2019s very important you have due diligence and we talk about how we change the system. That\u2019s why I am very interested in the report\u2019s recommendations.\u201d So far the governing body has released a laughably evasive statement: \u201cUefa is currently analysing the findings of the review and assessing them against its own analysis of the organisation of the event and facts that occurred around it.\u201d Klaveness stresses that: \u201cI will await Uefa\u2019s [full] response to this report which is not a courtroom decision. It\u2019s not a verdict \u2013 even though the report is very thorough. We now await Uefa\u2019s response which should be very clear.\u201d For a worrying moment it sounds as if Klaveness is suggesting that Uefa\u2019s response will offer the definitive verdict. \u201cNo, no,\u201d she insists, \u201cbut they have to answer it now because there are 21 recommendations in the report. It\u2019s very important they take the responsibility and believe those 21 recommendations after this horrific incident.\u201d Even if electioneering curbs her usual ability to speak freely, especially in a campaign stacked against her, Klaveness can help cleanse Uefa of some of the ills that infect the organisation. \u201cMy aim is not to be confronting and escalating conflict but to be bridge-building,\u201d she says. \u201cI was a judge and I worked in mediation, with people who committed severe crimes. I found a way to talk to them through football \u2013 which has the biggest force to be anti-discrimination and to include everyone. So for me to go in and point fingers would be ridiculous. I\u2019m very aware of the challenges in football. They are very big and it\u2019s not going to be easier moving ahead. \u201cI am running for this election with nothing to lose because football is a big passion in my life. It\u2019s a bit personal so it\u2019s worth trying. If I don\u2019t make it, someone else can take the next run. Or I will try again.\u201d"

                    "body": "\u201cThe UK PM had a very short stint and there was the possibility of the predecessor going straight back in again,\u201d tweets Derek Brosnan. \u201cHas this ever happened for football managers?\u201d It should surprise absolutely nobody that the first answer to this question is somebody who worked for the former Atl\u00e9tico Madrid president and P45 addict, Jes\u00fas Gil. \u201cDuring Gil\u2019s chaotic reign, Radomir Antic, went straight back to the job that he was fired from \u2013 not once, but twice over a two-year period,\u201d writes Chai in Atlanta. \u201cAfter managing the side for three years \u2013 including a league and cup double in 1996 \u2013 he was replaced by Arrigo Sacchi in June 1998. Sacchi lasted just over six months, and Antic returned in March 1999 to take over from the caretaker, Carlos S\u00e1nchez Aguiar. Despite leading the team to the final of the 1999 Copa del Rey, he was fired in June and replaced by Claudio Ranieri. After Ranieri was fired in March 2000, Antic returned for his third stint. Despite reaching another Copa del Rey final, he was promptly fired again.\u201dChai also suggests Francesco Guidolin, who had four spells at Palermo \u2013 including three in the space of a year. \u201cAfter starting his second spell at the club in June 2006, he was fired the following April,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe sacking was revoked and he was back at the helm within a month. However, after just two matches, he was dismissed again, this time to be replaced by Stefano Colantuono. In November 2007, Guidolin replaced Colantuono for his fourth stint at the club. This reunion was unsurprisingly short-lived, and he was fired on 24 March 2008.\u201d  A few of you suggested Leonardo Jardim, who was Monaco\u2019s head coach either side of Thierry Henry\u2019s ill-fated spell in 2018-19. Harry Redknapp returned to Portsmouth in 2005, a year after infamously leaving to join Southampton, although Pompey had two different managers, Velimir Zajec and Alain Perrin, between Redknapp\u2019s stints so technically he doesn\u2019t qualify.  Like Guidolin, Safet Hadzic was in charge at Olimpija Ljubljana on four occasions between 2010-20, though there were at least two managers between each stint. And then there\u2019s Nenad Lalatovic. \u201cHe\u2019s had a pair of multiple spells, but it\u2019s worth a focus on Radnicki Nis,\u201d writes Richard Wilson. \u201cLalatovic managed them for a season in 2018-19 \u2013 an incredibly successful one at that \u2013 before ditching them to join Vojvodina. On his return to Nis, he ended up with a touchline ban after getting involved in an argument with the fans. This September, he took back over again at Radnicki Nis after a short spell at Borac Banja Luka, where he initially resigned after two games, came back and then resigned again after seven more.\u201d Finally, Yaad Ilani has an even better story of a manager succeeding himself.  Golden Boots with fewest games \u201cWho has played the fewest games to win the Golden Boot in their domestic league, eg 25 goals in 18 games?\u201d tweets @SwarleyGraham. For entirely arbitrary reasons, we\u2019ve excluded any season in which the maximum number of games was fewer than 30 (eg La Liga in 1932-33, when Manuel Olivares won the Pichichi after scoring 16 in 14 for Real Madrid). We\u2019re contractually obliged to start with the Premier League, so let\u2019s get that out of the way.  Diego Maradona scored 15 goals in 28 games for Napoli in 1987-88, enough to win the Capocannoniere at a time when Serie A defences held sway. That was a 16-team league - as was La Liga in 1959-60 when the great Ferenc Puskas scored 26 in 24 games for Real Madrid.  Christian Vieri also needed only 24 games (out of a potential 38) to score 24 goals for Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in 1997-98, five more than the next best, Rivaldo. Atletico still only finished in seventh place, which invites a different Knowledge question. In the Bundesliga in 1993-94, future Leeds legend Tony Yeboah shared the Golden Boot with Stefan Kuntz after scoring 18 goals in 22 matches for Eintracht Frankfurt. But the best we can find is 20 games. Kylian Mbappe hit 18 goals for PSG in 2019-20, sharing the Golden Boot with Monaco\u2019s Wissam Ben Yedder. Thirty years earlier, natural-born genius Romario scored 23 in 20 for PSV Eindhoven. Can anyone beat winning the Golden Boot in 20 games? If so, mail us or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU Prolific uncapped players (2) In last week\u2019s Knowledge we looked at prolific goalscorers who never played for their country. And \u2013 would you believe it \u2013 we missed out a few serial net-botherers \u2026 \u201cCan\u2019t believe no one mentioned Dave Halliday,\u201d writes John Briggs (and others). \u201cHe scored 211 top-flight goals in England but was never capped for Scotland. Among his many feats are: fastest player to 100 English top-flight goals (101 games); only player to score at least 30 top-division goals in England in four consecutive seasons (1925\u201329 at Sunderland). Look his record up.\u201d    Ups and downs \u201cAs it stands in the Championship table Blackburn, second from top, have lost more games than West Brom, third from bottom. Has a team ever been promoted while losing more than one who was relegated?\u201d asks Alan Davis. \u201cNo\u201d is the short answer, at least not in the Football League. \u201cUnsurprisingly, there has never been a promoted team in the English leagues with more defeats than, or even the same number as, a relegated team in the same division,\u201d writes Mike Slattery. \u201cThe closest was in the old Second Division in 1990-91. Owing to league realignment, only two teams were relegated that season, and coincidentally it was West Brom (18 defeats in 46 games, goal difference -9) who finished second bottom. By contrast, Brighton (18 defeats in 46 games, goal difference -6) finished sixth and got to the playoff final, where they lost to Notts County.\u201d Here\u2019s the full table.  Knowledge archive \u201cWhich match holds the record for the most red cards? asked Matthew Kay in 2002, and yes we did dig the question out because of the high jinks in Argentina at the weekend. \u201cAm I right in thinking it was a game involving Sheffield United and Italian opposition in the early 1990s? We failed to track down Matt\u2019s Anglo-Italian game, but we do know that the British league record for red cards is five, which happened twice in 1997. As Dave Ede pointed out, five players were sent off in the Second Division match between Chesterfield and Plymouth on 22 February 1997. \u201cA Plymouth player was sent off for a two-footed challenge, and then four players \u2013 including Kevin Davies for Chesterfield \u2013 were sent off following a mass brawl in the final minute, instigated by Bruce Grobbelaar pretending to have been injured by the shy and retiring Darren Carr,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAt least that\u2019s how I saw it.\u201d And on 2 December that year, five players were also sent off in the Bristol Rovers v Wigan Athletic \u2013 four just before half-time.  Meanwhile, Ian Battersby noted that the most red cards dished out in one game \u2013 according to the Guinness Book of Records \u2013 was an astonishing 20. \u201cThe incident occurred in league match between Sportivo Ameliano and General Caballero in Paraguay,\u201d he mailed. \u201cWhen two Sportivo players were sent off, a 10-minute fight ensued and the referee dismissed a further 18 players. The match, not surprisingly, was abandoned.\u201d Update: the record is now \u2013 and you\u2019ll like this \u2013 36 red cards in a match. And it\u2019s happened more than once.  Can you help? \u201cThe opening game of the World Cup between Qatar and Ecuador will have a combined Fifa ranking of 94: Qatar ranked 50th and Ecuador 44th. Has there ever been an opening match between lower-ranked teams?\u201d asks Emily Jules.    \u201cWhat is the highest cumulative transfer fee paid for a player who has not appeared in the top flight in England?\u201d wonders Alex Cocks.  \u201cWhile watching the MLS Western Conference final, in which a forward scored an own goal, I was reminded of how rare that is. Or at least, how rare that seems to be. Who has the unfortunate record of scoring the most own goals as a forward?\u201d Mail us your questions or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU."

                    "body": "There\u2019s a pleasant sense of relief this week, as we head into an Australia-England cricket contest without an accompanying circus of hype. Nobody is crowing about a limited-overs series constituting the Twenty20 Ashes, as the marketing departments might once have attempted. Instead the three matches between Sunday and Friday will be rightly seen as warm-ups for the T20 World Cup, even if they\u2019re not part of the official warm-up program that will see Australia play once against India, and England once against Pakistan, before the tournament proper.  This should be a series of relative restraint, with sides looking to find a groove against quality opposition and answer a couple of final selection questions. That fits with the feeling that even the tournament proper is not exactly stirring swells of anticipation. The previous T20 trophy was won less than 11 months ago. The 2024 edition in the Caribbean and United States will be the third in less than three years. The schedule trivialises the concept of a World Cup. These are exhibition tournaments for a funding sugar-hit, not meaningful paths to defining the team of an era. The 50-over format may be declining bilaterally, but the ODI World Cup retains its cachet, while not coincidentally retaining its quadrennial structure alongside its football equivalent and the Olympic Games. So it is. People will still watch what they don\u2019t retain, and as the modern seer Taylor Swift has observed, the players will continue to play. With their short careers and the vagaries of the format, most cricketers don\u2019t mind a couple of extra attempts at winning a prize to pad out their commentary CVs. Australia\u2019s win in the 2021 edition, on pay television from the Arabian Gulf in the middle of the night, got a muted reaction compared to the likely response of winning at home. England, meanwhile, have been underachievers in the shortest format while leading a white-ball revolution from 2015. They lost the 2016 final to the free-swinging West Indies and got politely mugged by New Zealand in the 2021 semi. The most destructive batting side in the world through that era has one 50-over World Cup to show for it. In many ways that era is over, though principles of aggression and some personnel remain. Eoin Morgan called it quits, Jason Roy ran out of runs, Jonny Bairstow impossibly blew his leg off playing golf, Jofra Archer was the bowler of 2019 and has been head of the injury list since, Joe Root was deemed too slow, Liam Plunkett got pensioned off, Mark Wood is always one mile per hour from injury, Ben Stokes has been drafted back in despite never doing much in the format. The consistent presences from the start of Morgan\u2019s era to now are new captain Jos Buttler, Moeen Ali, Chris Jordan, Chris Woakes and Adil Rashid.  Alex Hales and David Willey got booted sufficiently long ago that they have had time to cycle away from the team and work back. Newer blood like Harry Brook, Phil Salt, Liam Livingstone, and the left-arm thunderbolt merchant Reece Topley will need to run hot for England to maintain their old level. Australian selectors, meanwhile, have to make decisions about whether they will make any decisions. Their squad could produce the exact same XI that won the World Cup in Dubai last year. That won\u2019t be the case in the series opener against England, with the main four bowlers and six-hitter Glenn Maxwell being spared the long trip to Perth in favour of resting. Fringe players will get a gallop on the park and a last chance to impress, supplemented by players from outside the squad. But the second and third matches in Canberra will give a better sense of the tournament plan. Australian selection style has been conservative since Bradman\u2019s day, so it was amusing to see a Test pace attack picked for a T20 World Cup \u2013 and then win the thing. They will get another chance as long as Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc stay fit alongside spinner Adam Zampa. The same caution will see selectors stick with Aaron Finch despite his traditional run-drought before a big tournament, and Marcus Stoinis as the incumbent all-rounder despite recent claims in his absence of Cameron Green from outside the squad. David Warner at the top of the order is still the most productive bat, while keeper Matthew Wade has been irreproachable as a number seven finisher. Mitchell Marsh will bat at three as he did in his trophy-clinching performance last year, and might bowl medium pace. Maxwell will float around the middle order and bowl off-spin. The only real question is whether to bow to reputation and keep Steve Smith in the side, or use the power of new boy Tim David. Smith is innovative but often doesn\u2019t maintain a high enough run rate, while David is the kind of player who can take 30 from 10 balls at the end of an innings to change a match. Even Australian selectors can sometimes take a punt on a good thing."

                    "body": "A quick quiz question: can you name each of the six players who played in midfield for England at the 2018 World Cup? Dele Alli and Jesse Lingard, with their goals, perhaps spring most immediately to mind. Then there was the penalty that Eric Dier converted in the shootout against Colombia and the one that Jordan Henderson did not. That\u2019s the easy(ish) four, but a special bonus prize to anybody who recalled Fabian Delph\u2019s two starts against Belgium or the fact that when Alli was injured against Tunisia he was replaced by Ruben Loftus-Cheek, who retained his place for the group games against Panama and Belgium and then started the third-place play-off as well.  It has been Loftus-Cheek\u2019s fate to exist on the periphery of English football\u2019s consciousness. His talent was obvious, a brooding grace encapsulated in a muscular 6ft3in frame but denied pitch-time by the superclubs\u2019 habit of stockpiling players. It\u2019s not insignificant that when he made his England debut, only eight months before the last World Cup, it was having impressed during a loan spell at Crystal Palace. And then came the injuries; repeated back problems, an achilles ruptured in a charity game against New England Revolution, a vague, entirely non-medical, sense that he might be too big for his talents, that there was some irreconcilable disconnect between his technical ability and his size and athleticism. His shorthand tag switched from young-talent-deserves-more-of-a-chance to great-potential-sadly-undermined-by-injury. It comes as something of a surprise to realise he is still only 26. Loftus-Cheek hasn\u2019t played for England since a friendly against the USA in November 2018. Three of his seven England starts came at the last World Cup but, as another World Cup approaches, the sense after Saturday\u2019s 1-1 draw between Chelsea and Manchester United is that he might have another World Cup role to play. It was not an easy game in which to thrive. As Fred prepared to come on for Jadon Sancho six minutes into the second half of the draw at Stamford Bridge, the Brazilian received lengthy instruction from Erik ten Hag, who explained his role using a magnetic tactics board. Peering over Ten Hag\u2019s shoulder from the Stamford Bridge press box, the most striking aspect was how many counters there were, how small the pitch appeared. Which, in fairness, was pretty much how the game felt for long stretches. There did seem to be a lot of players; there were periods in both halves when the thought occurred that maybe pitches need to be bigger, that expecting anybody to find space in such a congested environment was absurd.  Was this something else to be added to the litany of things about the game that should be changed? That, even in this era of perfect playing surfaces and automatic first touches, the human frame has changed to such an extent that the dimensions the Victorians laid out for the game themselves need changing? But then another thought occurred, which is that we\u2019ve been a little spoiled by the relentless passing of Manchester City and the remorseless pressing of Liverpool, and that is how matches between the league\u2019s elite are supposed to look. They\u2019re not meant to be stretched; there isn\u2019t supposed to be space. Rather, they\u2019re supposed to be tight and tense, decided by a yard generated by a glimmer of attacking brilliance or a momentary lapse of defensive concentration.  This was a game fundamentally about the midfields. At first, United, with an extra man in the centre, dominated \u2013 Casemiro, Christian Eriksen and Bruno Fernandes able to pick their way around Jorginho and Loftus-Cheek. Graham Potter redressed that nine minutes before half-time, withdrawing Marc Cucurella for Mateo Kovacic and switching to a diamond midfield. Suddenly it was Chelsea who had the man advantage in the middle and the theatre of action moved 20 yards towards the United goal. So Ten Hag had to take action, which he did by taking off Sancho for Fred and moving Fernandes to the left. The midfields were then evenly matched and the game essentially became a battle of set-plays. Casemiro excelled, but so too did Loftus-Cheek. Hyping in-form players in the run-up to the World Cup, as though plans drawn up over the course of years should be ripped up for the flavour of the month, is one of the more unfortunate aspects of football journalism, but the centre of midfield is an area where England have a problem. With Kalvin Phillips injured and Henderson\u2019s form uncertain, who will partner Declan Rice? Jude Bellingham is the man in possession, and he played well in the games against Italy and Germany and scored twice in Borussia Dortmund\u2019s 5-0 demolition of Stuttgart on Saturday, but may be a slightly more front-footed player than Gareth Southgate would ideally deploy in the role. There is a vacancy there, even if only as back-up. Amid the hubbub, Loftus-Cheek had the highest pass accuracy of any Chelsea midfielder on Saturday. No Chelsea player had more shots or made more interceptions than him and nobody on the pitch was fouled more than him. He wins the ball back, is very hard to dispossess and offers an attacking threat both in open play and from set-pieces. Southgate knows him and clearly once rated him. Perhaps, four years on, after all the pain and all the frustration, Loftus-Cheek\u2019s time is about to come again."

                    "body": "Last week two Watford supporters\u2019 groups successfully campaigned to have their side\u2019s friendly with Qatar called off. Women of Watford and the LGBTQ+ supporters\u2019 group Proud Hornets tweeted their disdain after the fixture was announced. They discussed their concerns and Watford pulled out. \u201cThe game was never finalised and it became abundantly clear this was a game not to play; as such, the schedule was revised,\u201d a club spokesperson said. Qatar\u2019s Football Association said it had received a number of offers to play friendly matches. \u201cWe selected some friendly matches with various European teams and Watford was not among these matches that the team will play.\u201d  The cancellation of a meaningless game at a training camp in Austria between a Championship team trying to build some fitness and the World Cup hosts may not appear to be the biggest story. But the fact that a gay supporters\u2019 group played a key role in affecting the decisions of a professional football club feels like quite a seminal moment. Would this have happened a decade ago? It is to Watford\u2019s credit that they listened to their fans. And it is heartwarming that Women of Watford and Proud Hornets empowered enough to speak openly about how they feltable to speak out. On Thursday the Shrewsbury Town group Proud Salopians achieved the same outcome, with their club\u2019s game against Qatar cancelled. This week on the Guardian Football Weekly as part of Pride month we recorded a special on the experiences of the LGBTQ+ community in the game. There are reasons to be positive: the mobilisation of fan groups, the increased visibility through things such as the Rainbow Laces campaign, current players such as Josh Cavallo and Jake Daniels coming out to almost universal support and love. But from accounts we received it\u2019s obvious that endemic homophobia in the game has had a huge impact on gay football fans. Tony was just one example: \u201cAs a closeted gay man fighting with my sexuality in the early 2000s, the patterns of behaviour in football matches and from family and friends around me definitely contributed to me taking longer to come to terms with my sexuality \u2013 and the issues that followed (PTSD of burying true feelings in for so long etc). Being closeted and young at football matches is a strange experience, as you are denying your true self and getting it validated by the language and actions you see around you. \u201cThe pressures to act straight and blend in were constant stress, but only something I realised on self-reflection \u2013 once I stopped going to football matches and came to terms with my sexuality. The macho culture of football means you hear discrimination in nearly all forms in most matches you go to. This could be just small comments, a \u2018harmless\u2019 joke, or something bigger and more threatening to any vulnerable groups (not just LGBTQIA).  \u201cThe people I went to the matches with are some of the most lovely down-to-earth, selfless people you could meet \u2013 but their lack of experience with more diverse groups tends to ensure that anything beyond their own social group and perspective is hard to understand.\u201d It\u2019s obvious when you think about it that being exposed frequently to homophobic environments is going to make it harder to come out \u2013 and like Tony you may stop going altogether. So long as some people don\u2019t feel comfortable enough even to turn up then football really isn\u2019t for everyone. It is hard to quantify exactly how much better or worse it is, as more people get comfortable reporting incidents and the authorities take it more seriously. Last year the CPS correctly made the \u201crent boy\u201d chant a hate crime. In 2020, according to an ICM poll for the Rainbow Laces campaign, 20% of sport fans thought anti-LGBTQ+ language was harmless if meant as banter. You wonder whether more than 20% felt that but knew how you\u2019re meant to answer. When I was in the playground 30 years ago, we all used the word gay as a pejorative term. I don\u2019t recall singing homophobic songs on the terraces a few years later, but I heard so much of it and never called it out \u2013 likewise on Sunday league pitches. On the pod we received countless accounts from amateur footballers about the levels of homophobia they still encounter. Tom gave us his experience:  \u201cWhile I was released from Luton Town simply for not being good enough, I felt I was forced to quit playing football altogether a number of years later as I suffered homophobic abuse in a Sunday league game. I would class it as \u2018psychological abuse\u2019. Opposition players, who knew I was gay, would take it in turns to whisper crude and offensive things in my ear, out of earshot of everyone else (\u2018Would you sleep with any of your teammates then? I bet that\u2019s well horrible!\u2019) and other similar things. It was a dreadful feeling, and I decided after that I wouldn\u2019t put myself through it again for the sake of Sunday morning football.\u201d It\u2019s depressing reading, but it highlights the need to continue these conversations, and more importantly to be a real ally. It perhaps isn\u2019t enough now to like the idea of diversity and inclusion and do nothing about it. Rishi Madlani is from Foxes Pride and Pride in Football: \u201cIf you follow a club or a national side join their LGBT fan group as an ally. We\u2019ve got 50+ now and hopefully we\u2019ll get to 92. If your club doesn\u2019t have one support that when it launches.\u201d And as Nicky Bandini, who came out as transgender in 2019, said on the pod: \u201cBe vocal. Be supportive in a vocal way when you hear something that isn\u2019t right. It\u2019s not easier to challenge things just because we are LGBTQ+; in fact it\u2019s often harder.\u201d This year there will be a World Cup in a country where homosexuality is illegal. When Qatar kick off against Ecuador in the third game of the opening day not many people will be thinking about that game they didn\u2019t play against Watford in July, but it means something that campaigners stopped it going ahead."

                    "body": "Does it matter what music is played around the stadium when a goal is scored? To answer that question let me revisit a particularly grim time during the pandemic when Liverpool FC were playing in empty stadiums and their goals were followed not by the famed Anfield roar but a blast of Song 2 by Blur. It was loud, it was raucous, and it had nothing to do with the club whatsoever, serving only to highlight the detached, sterile surroundings life was suddenly taking place in.  To some of us traditionalists, goal music should be banned. If you want to turn this into ice hockey, at least let the players have mass brawls on the pitch. But Fifa know better, of course, and they\u2019re clearly not satisfied with the mere sound of a crowd going wild. Instead, they\u2019ve asked each of the 32 competing nations to provide a song to be pumped around the arena any time they score. Some teams, including England and Wales, have picked two, a bit like having an away kit in case their opposing team have chosen the same song. But which is the best tune? More importantly, which provides the necessary adrenaline rush while also inflicting further psychological pain upon the conceders? As some teams haven\u2019t even played yet, let alone scored, the only way to work this out is to rank them in the most scientific way possible: me listening to them once while imagining that I have just scored a goal for said country at the World Cup final. 40. When We Stand Together \u2013 Nickelback (Germany) It\u2019s hard to imagine the office somewhere in Germany where someone uttered the words: \u201cI know what we need for our 2022 World Cup goal celebrations: a 10-year-old song by that Canadian rock band everyone hates.\u201d But apparently it happened. 39. 30,000 Feet - NorthSideBenji &amp; DJ Charlie B (Canada) Canada had an astonishing 22 shots against Belgium in their opening game yet failed to score with any of them. Could the lack of dynamism conjured up here by the Toronto rapper and his compatriot DJ be to blame? (No, but play along with me here.) 38. On My Mind - Powderfinger (Australia) I\u2019m not sure why Australia have bothered picking a reserve song as surely no other team are going to go with Men at Work\u2019s Down Under? Anyway, the thought of this horrendous rock nonsense being inflicted on 60,000 people would sorely tempt me to sky the ball several feet over the bar. 37. Vamos Com Tudo - David Carreira (Portugal) The man I\u2019m dubbing the Portuguese Peter Andre actually used to be a junior football player until a knee injury set him back. I\u2019m telling you this boring fact because it is still more interesting than this song.  36. A Minha Casinha - Xutos &amp; Pontap\u00e9s (Portugal) A decades-old rock cover version of a song from a 1943 Portuguese comedy film \u2026 I mean, I know this is a tough gig but is this really the best the Portuguese Football Federation could come up with? 35. Re-Sepp-Ten - VM Holdet (Denmark) Slap bass and Pet Shop Boys synths \u2026 this was written in 1986 for the Danish team\u2019s Mexico World Cup sojourn, and you can tell. Pleasant as a World Cup anthem, perhaps, but pretty underwhelming when I play it in my fantasy of getting on the end of a Christian Eriksen cross. 34. U\u017ei\u010dko Kolo - Svetozar Gongo (Serbia) The Serbian trumpeter\u2019s effort has the swift pace of a tricky winger \u2026 but also a slight tinge of the Benny Hill theme. I can\u2019t help thinking it will render any goals scored somewhat farcical. 33. Mi Gran Noche - Raphael (Spain) A slice of Latin pop from 1967, this was presumably blasted out seven times during Spain\u2019s opening demolition of Costa Rica \u2013 which is quite amusing as it sounds like utterly unsuitable goal music.  32. Down Under \u2013 Men at Work (Australia) One of several instances of literalism on this list, which betrays a lack of deep tactical thinking. Call me a purist but no player should ever be made to celebrate to the sound of a flute riff. 31. El Otro Gol - Gandhi (Costa Rica) It\u2019s hard to work out which segment of this shapeshifting song Costa Rica intend to play. The a cappella intro? The mid-paced reggae-rock song? The guitar solo over crowd noises? Given they got pasted 7-0 in their opening game against Spain, we may never find out. 30. The Shouts of Reds - TransFixion (South Korea) Again I must ask: which bit is supposed to be the goal bit? The bombastic choir singing over stadium metal drums? The bit where it suddenly turns into Green Day? Or the bit after that, where it sounds like nursery school kids covering Rage Against the Machine? Whichever way, it\u2019s a hard pass from me. 29. Song 2 \u2013 Blur (France) Even less appropriate than it was for Liverpool, the world champions will be banging them in to the least Gallic music imaginable. Despite the undeniable energy it brings, Blur\u2019s indie thrasher has an air of forced jollity to it. 28. Ecuador, Si Se Puede - Damiano (Ecuador) It seems strange to me that there is a ready-made 90s dancefloor banger out there called, literally, Ecuador \u2013 and the country have instead gone for some old geezer on a classical guitar crooning melodically. 27. Cumbia Pa` la Selecci\u00f3n \u2013 De La Planta (Uruguay) Too many of these songs suffer from a sluggish pace. You\u2019re soundtracking a World Cup goal, lads, not the semi final of The X Factor!  26. Sidi Mansour \u2013 Saber Rebai (Tunisia) The Tunisian singer popularised this folk classic 20 years ago and helped it reach the giddy heights it now enjoys today: not getting played at all during a 0-0 against Denmark 25. Srce Vatreno - Marko Lasi\u0107-Nered (Croatia) Marko seems to think he\u2019s entered Eurovision with this lighters-in-the-air piano ballad effort, though he gains extra marks for making it sound like it\u2019s performed by a bunch of drunken squaddies. The rap bit in the middle is best not discussed.  24. Svijet Voli Pobjednike - Colonia (Croatia) Thumping synthy dance music \u2013 a bit like if Fat Les\u2019s Vindaloo went to the worst club it could find on an 18-30s holiday. Tries to go melodic for the chorus, which somehow makes things worse. 23. Luz Delito - Wos (Argentina) Argentinian rock-rap with shades of Sabotage by the Beastie Boys. Slightly weakened by the fact that after they must have played this song after scoring against Saudi Arabia, then proceeded to concede two in one of the biggest World Cup upsets of all time. 22. DevilTime - MC Devil (Belgium) Essentially MC Hammer\u2019s U Can\u2019t Touch This repurposed as a Eurodance banger. The mysterious MC Devil only seems to have written one song in his/her lifetime: it\u2019s an absolutely terrible one to boot, but I can\u2019t deny it might provide quite a rush to hear it after nodding in a last-minute winner. 21. Kernkraft 400 - Zombie Nation (Wales) A song whose suitability relies entirely on whether Gareth Bale is prepared to attempt the Peter Crouch robot dance. 20. Feel So Good - Mase (USA) This track feels like it needs a bit of swagger from the player involved for it to really work, maybe even a little dance routine, which will of course render the whole thing even more ridiculous when said goal gets ruled out by VAR. 19. Ol\u00e9 Ol\u00e9 \u2013 Los Ajenos (Costa Rica) Galloping Latin ska with horns that build to an impressive party climax. Replacing their other goal song with this option is surely all it will take to turn around Costa Rica\u2019s dire fortunes. 18. Iran1400 - HM (Iran) I\u2019m concocting a theory that we only let in a couple of goals against Iran so the world could be introduced to Persian hip-hop.  17. Rasta \u2013 Preko Sveta (Serbia) Balkan reggaeton, you say? Well my Spotify algorithm will certainly be interesting after today\u2019s listening. As for whether I\u2019d want to hear this after finding the top corner from just outside the box? I\u2019ll level with you, I\u2019ve absolutely no idea. 16. This Is Wales \u2013 The Barry Horns (Wales) A brass band made up of Welsh football fans \u2013 they should really use this one instead of Zombie Nation, given that there\u2019s not much other use for a horn-powered dance number that mentions Aberystwyth. 15. Muhammed - Adnan Do\u011fru (Tunisia) You know, I can imagine a team building on this stirring, drum-laden devotional song, even if the only version I can find online seems to reference Algeria, the Tunisian team\u2019s fiercest football rivals. 14. Samba de Janeiro - Bellini (Netherlands) An unstoppable if somewhat overplayed choice here. Ticks the \u201csporty\u201d and \u201ceuphoric\u201d boxes but loses points for the fact there are few places that feel less samba than the Netherlands. 13. Esquentando O Couro - Escola de Samba (Brazil) Essentially just a barrage of carnival drums. Extremely Brazilian and, fair play, would absolutely do the opponent\u2019s nut in. 12. Syori No Emi Wo Kimi To \u2013 Ukasuka (Japan) Bombastic indie from J-pop\u2019s answer to the Killers, this builds to a climax so relentlessly silly that, by the six minute mark, you are somehow won over.  11. Mbandjoh - Les Rythmeurs ABC (Cameroon) This riotous song in homage to the African nation could work, providing they go with the uplifting bit at the end where someone whips out what sounds like an accordion. 10. Idol - BTS (South Korea) The chorus is reminiscent of every 90s club hit rolled into one, and for that reason means the supermassive boyband have a reliable goal anthem.  9. Freed From Desire \u2013 Gala (England, Poland, Switzerland) A whopping three countries all picked this for their goal tune, which is strange given that it\u2019s clearly the soundtrack to being sick on the waltzers after downing a litre bottle of White Lightning in the park. 8. Allez Allez Maroc - Hamid Bouchnak (Morocco) Football-themed lyrics, laser-guided synths and raucous crowd noise effects transform this traditional Moroccan folk song into something that is A) completely abysmal and B) probably quite perfect when you\u2019ve just scored in injury time. 7. La Negra - La Hija Del Mariachi (Mexico) Who can resist the sound of mariachi, the music of 18th-century Mexican countryside that always, surely, had one eye on being performed at the Qatar 2022 World Cup. Against all odds, this makes a sort of sense if you imagine it being sung in the same determined manner of El Cant del Bar\u00e7a. 6. Love Tonight \u2013 Shouse (Netherlands) This moody dance number is a TikTok banger and, while the choir provides the uplift, the minor key element will remind any potential scorers to stay focused on the task in hand (a theory I have, admittedly, just made up on the spot).  5. Ba\u0142kanica - Piersi (Poland) Look, by the time I played this I\u2019d already heard 40-odd World Cup goal songs and my brain was scrambled. Still, it sounds completely bonkers to me. I had it down as the booziest sounding tune of the lot and that was before the dubstep breakdown. 4. Going Bad - Meek Mill ft Drake (Canada) The spooky piano line creates an intimidating atmosphere that could put the wind up the opponent \u2013 even more impressive when you consider that Meek Mill and Drake probably didn\u2019t write it to accompany Reading\u2019s Junior Hoilett arriving late at the far post.  3. Al Saudia - Rashed Al Majed (Saudi Arabia) With Qatar\u2019s own song apparently not announced, this Saudi singer brings the required Middle Eastern flavour to the World Cup. Released in 1998, it features a droning instrument (I\u2019m guessing a habb\u0101n) that would get under any opponent\u2019s skin. 2. Oofeets\u0254 - Sarkodie (Ghana) The Ghanian rapper brings the party here. A suitably funky, full-team synchronised dance is de rigueur to go with this one. 1. One Kiss \u2013 Dua Lipa (England) Slinky, stylish, almost as if written specifically for Jack Grealish to flick England\u2019s fourth into the net during a demolition of Brazil while continuing his run and performing a backflip to the beat. Maybe we should save this reserve tune for the final, eh lads?"

Alan Yentob meets the author on a trip back to Glasgow, where he is lucid and insightful about the trauma that informs his writing. It\u2019s a story about the interplay between continuity and change. He visits the remains of Sighthill, the tough housing scheme in which he grew up as the gay son of an alcoholic mother, but he is also faced with a very different city that still carries traces of its old spirit. Phil Harrison The Pact 9pm, BBC One Having taken three episodes to get to the violent death and the titular pact, the thriller now delivers the necessary aftermath episode full of nervous arguments and overwhelming guilt. It\u2019s ponderous, too, but Rakie Ayola and Steven Mackintosh (as the imprisoned patriarch) lend it some class. Jack Seale The White Lotus 9pm, Sky Atlantic Harper (the series-stealing Aubrey Plaza) and Daphne escape to a villa for the night, leaving Cameron and Ethan to relive their college days back at the hotel (yes, it\u2019s disgusting). Meanwhile, Tanya has been ditched by groggy Greg, but is she about to make a new friend?

Despite the peaceful start, protests became violent, with people storming government buildings. Former governor of Hong Kong Chris Patten is one of the witnesses who analyse events. Hannah Verdier 1966: Who Stole the World Cup? 10pm, Channel 4  Any football fan can name the collie (Pickles) who found the stolen World Cup trophy before the 1966 tournament, but the mystery of who was responsible for the theft was never solved. This cheerful documentary reveals new evidence that might make identifying the culprits possible half a century later. PH Summer House 10pm, E4 The latest US reality series import takes us to the Hamptons, where nine New York friends/potential enemies can be found holidaying in their shared summer house. Kyle, Lindsay, Carl and Amanda are some of the names you don\u2019t need to remember. HR Film choice  Monkey Business (Howard Hawks, 1952), 2.25am, Talking Pictures TVA comedy revolving around animal experimentation may be frowned on today, but with Cary Grant and Ginger Rogers starring and Howard Hawks directing, this film surely gets a pass. It\u2019s gloriously silly, as the search by Grant\u2019s scientist for an elixir of youth goes pear-shaped when one of his chimps doses the lab\u2019s water cooler. Given the chance to play increasingly youthful versions of themselves, Grant and Rogers are brilliant \u2013 Rogers even sends up her own dancing skills \u2013 and it all zips along with screwball vim.

                    "body": "Perhaps they should call it the Eden Project. The best team in the world, hoping to affirm their exalted status in front of a passionate audience at Auckland\u2019s Eden Park on 12 November. And, in the process, helping to raise the profile of women\u2019s rugby to fresh heights. The next six weeks, in all sorts of ways, could redefine how millions perceive rugby and those who play it.\nNo biggie, then. Just a World Cup that, given a fair North Island breeze, could conceivably reach parts that other tournaments have failed to reach. Anyone who witnessed the spiralling profile of England\u2019s Lionesses as they advanced towards their Euros success in July knows these are unprecedented times for female sport. Starting this weekend it is rugby\u2019s turn to join the overdue party.\n\nAdmittedly there are one or two possible obstacles. Only the real diehards are going to be leaping out of bed at 4.45am in the UK to watch the favourites England kick off against Fiji this Saturday. And will anyone be good enough to rein in the all-conquering Red Roses, a team so good they have won their past 25 Tests on the trot? One-sided processions in the middle of the night are not an obvious recipe for a European box office smash.\nBut then listen up to Sally Horrox, World Rugby\u2019s director of women\u2019s rugby, hailing this as the \u201cstart of the next stage of the growth and transformation of the game\u201d. Or start seeing it through the excited eyes of the many players who, following last year\u2019s Covid-related postponement, have had to wait an extra year for this potentially life-enhancing opportunity. \u201cWhere women\u2019s rugby is now is just crazy compared to the first World Cup I played in,\u201d says Sarah Hunter, England\u2019s captain, as she prepares to feature in her fourth global adventure.\nShe is right in most respects. Few could have guaranteed even five years ago that leading women\u2019s players would now be benefitting from full-time contracts, albeit without life-changing sums of money being involved. Over 35,000 spectators are expected at Eden Park for the opening day triple header and it is hoped a total of some 127,000 fans will attend the games, a far cry from the one woman and her sheepdog who showed an interest back in the day.\nThe key, though, will be how competitive the tournament turns out to be. The Rugby Football Union already has lofty ambitions as hosts of the 2025 tournament, with the stated aim of selling out Twickenham for the final. It takes two to tango, though, and the women\u2019s game needs someone to challenge England if the current sense of anticipation is not to ebb away on a tide of predictability.\nThe host nation will be fervently hoping that team is the Black Ferns, now guided by the former All Black coach Wayne Smith and an impressive array of assistant coaches. New Zealand won the 2017 tournament, defeating England 41-32 in the final in Belfast to claim their fifth world title, but endured a chastening tour of the UK last year and now have plenty to prove, not least to themselves.\nOr could it be France, possessors of a committed scrum and by no means a pushover? Much will depend on the eventual knockout draw, with England and France sharing the same pool initially, but it is far from impossible the French could reach the final. At which point, who knows?\n\nCanada, Italy, Wales and Scotland will also be dreaming of a striking win or two but everyone accepts England are the team to beat. It could almost be 2003, when England\u2019s men also headed south as the undisputed World Cup favourites with the tournament widely perceived as theirs to lose. Yes, they duly hoisted the Webb Ellis Cup but not without a few unscheduled alarms along the way.\nListen to the outstanding Emily Scarratt, either way, and it becomes clear that much of the weight of expectation on England is internally driven. \u201cWhether we\u2019ve been favourites or not we\u2019ve always looked at ourselves \u2026 if we get large parts of our game right then it should fall into place. We know there are external pressures associated with how everyone is tagging us. But actually we put a huge amount of pressure on ourselves: not to win the World Cup but to be better after every training session and every game we play.\u201d\nThe head coach, Simon Middleton, has also had his squad together since July and the experience within his team also clearly helps. \u201cOne of the things that keeps it real for us is that, whoever we\u2019re playing, we always prepare exactly the same.\u201d So does he think England can really be beaten? \u201cWe acknowledge that if we have a bad day and France, New Zealand or possibly Canada have a good one we could be in trouble. If we play against France or New Zealand in the knockout stages we\u2019re going to have to be at our very best. Any team coached by Wayne Smith and Mike Cron is going to be quite good, I reckon.\u201d\nAs Hunter makes crystal clear, though, the significance of the backdrop ensures England will take nothing for granted. \u201cEvery World Cup has been special but I genuinely feel this World Cup will be the biggest and most competitive there has ever been. And I genuinely don\u2019t think we\u2019ve realised the potential of this England team yet. The blend of youth and experience across the board, the versatility of the players \u2013 the talent in this side is incredible. It\u2019s a really exciting time for English rugby.\u201d\nThe acid test, though, has almost arrived. The world of sport is littered with red-hot favourites who, when the moment came, could not quite measure up. \u201cThe potential of this squad is huge but you\u2019ve got to deliver,\u201d says Scarratt. \u201cYou can have as much potential as you like but it\u2019s irrelevant if you can\u2019t put it on the park. I guess that\u2019s the bit we\u2019re really focusing on.\u201d Get the Eden Project right and it could just be the start.\nThis is an extract from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

                    "body": "Pep Guardiola believes that dropping Kalvin Phillips for being \u201coverweight\u201d has taught the Manchester City midfielder a valuable lesson \u2013 that he has to be \u201cperfect\u201d all year. Phillips returned from the World Cup in a condition unacceptable to the manager and was left out of City\u2019s 3-2 Carabao Cup win over Liverpool on 22 December. Phillips, a \u00a342m summer signing, was back in the squad for the 3-1 Premier League victory at Leeds six days later.  Guardiola said the 27-year-old had acted in a positive way to being excluded. \u201cHe wants to change,\u201d the City manager said. \u201cIt will maybe be a good lesson for him in the future. A footballer has to be perfect over 12 months. Perfect. \u201cEven in the holidays, he has to be perfect. You have to be ready because this level is so demanding. You have to [be able to] play three games [a week], you have to be fit. If you are not fit, then nothing. But I said last week, he [has] improved his level.\u201d Phillips was an 87th-minute substitute in Thursday\u2019s 1-0 league victory at Chelsea. During the game he was taunted by the home support about his weight. \u201cHe has a sense of humour,\u201d Guardiola added. \u201cIt was funny for the Chelsea fans.\u201d City face Chelsea again in Sunday\u2019s FA Cup third-round tie before travelling to Southampton three days later for a Carabao Cup quarter-final. Guardiola would not be drawn on whether Phillips would be give a first start since arriving at City. \u201cI don\u2019t know but for sure, the Carabao Cup, [if] he is going to play,\u201d he said. \u201cOn Sunday, we will see. I had a feeling last week, he is back. I had a good feeling.\u201d After signing from Leeds, Phillips made substitute appearances in August and September before a recurrence of a shoulder problem suffered at his former club forced surgery. He was ruled out for two months, playing only as a 50th-minute substitute in November\u2019s 2-0 Carabao Cup win over Chelsea before Thursday. \u201cKalvin was injured for a long part of [last] season,\u201d said Guardiola. \u201cThis is the truth. He came and after could not train, struggled, had the operation with the shoulder. We need Kalvin like we need all the players.\u201d Guardiola is pleased with the form of John Stones, who has started the last six matches in the Premier League. \u201cHe was maybe my first or second signing when I arrived seven years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cI know him quite well. I know when he is stable at home, here, happy. What a player. He has had some ups and downs in the past, he has had some injuries but I would say this is part of the process to realise what he needs. He is still young [28].\u201d"

The manager said he agreed \u201c100,000%\u201d and claimed: \u201cUefa are not the saints of football, they never were.\u201d Liverpool and Real Madrid have been allocated 19,618 tickets each for the final in Paris, priced at \u00a350.32, \u00a3125.79, \u00a3410.91 and \u00a3578.63. The two cheapest category tickets \u2013 amounting to about 15,500 seats per club \u2013 were discounted at the request of the semi-finalists, after Uefa had proposed offering 5,000 free tickets to each finalist. There is no reduction for over-65s, young adults (17-21) or juniors.  The finalists\u2019 allocation amounts to 52.3% of the Stade de France capacity on 28 May, which has been reduced to 75,000. Another 12,000 tickets will be allocated via a public ballot and the remaining 23,764 given to the Uefa \u201cfamily\u201d and corporate sponsors. With tickets selling on resale sites for between \u00a33,275 for one ballot ticket to \u00a315,499 for a hospitality seat in a private suite, Spirit of Shankly has condemned Uefa, accusing it of fleecing fans and indulging sponsors. In an open letter to European football\u2019s governing body, SOS wrote: \u201cSince 2018 when LFC last played Real Madrid in the final, Uefa\u2019s ticket revenue has gone from \u20ac3.06m to \u20ac4.22m, which equates to a 38% increase in four years. \u201cIn standing up to the failed Super League, Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin said: \u2018I can\u2019t understand how you can see your fans protesting and you don\u2019t care. You are full of money anyway, you\u2019re not poor, but you want more and more and more.\u2019 Well Mr Ceferin, Liverpool fans are protesting and you don\u2019t seem to care. Uefa are not poor, but you seem to want more. And more. \u201cSimilarly, Uefa\u2019s proposed changes to their club competitions in the future ignore the interests of the fans. Football supporters are tired of being ripped off. Tired of watching their team reach a final, but unable to find a ticket to attend. And tired of exorbitant prices. It\u2019s time Uefa recognised the power of fans and the importance of fans above sponsorships.\u201d Klopp believes the ticket prices and allocation demonstrate a greed that pervades the football industry, from Fifa\u2019s decision to award a World Cup to Qatar to the proposed changes and expansion of the Champions League. The Liverpool manager said: \u201cWe will talk in a few months that we have a World Cup in Qatar. How that could have happened? Nobody who made that decision at that time is still in charge but the World Cup is still there. It\u2019s about money. Uefa are not the saints of football, they never were. What they have in the Champions League is a fantastic, fantastic product. If you would have asked me we never had to change that. But they lost a little bit of money here and there and the easy way to get it back is to increase the ticket prices. \u201cI understand 100,000% where Spirit of Shankly is coming from. It is absolutely not right but it happens everywhere. It doesn\u2019t make it better, just in this specific case you are not only paying more than last time for a ticket but you only get 50% of the tickets and the rest goes to people who pay thousands and thousands for the tickets. That\u2019s how all the money is made. The atmosphere, 20,000 reds are responsible for that. Do I like it? No. Will I change it? To talk about is right but you have to write about it too because most of us think the same.\u201d Uefa was approached for comment."

It says here that the hope at Stamford Bridge is that by dangling Conor Gallagher, Armando Broja and \u00a325m in front of Goodison Park suits, Frank Lampard might be convinced to finally let go of Gordon\u2019s feet. The Mill\u2019s not brilliant at maths but this kind of deal would appear to make the attacking midfielder, who is yet to get into double figures for goals at Everton, worth around \u00a375m to \u00a380m. Far out, man. Across Stanley Park, Liverpool have midfield problems of their own to sort out. Despite emphatically ending talk of a crisis with their nine-goal evisceration of Bournemouth, J\u00fcrgen Klopp is still keen to add a middle man who can last more than one game without getting injured to his ranks. With Frenkie de Jong looking likely to stay at Barcelona, a deal for long-time Borussia Dortmund target Jude Bellingham might be brought forward to January, but Wolves\u2019s R\u00faben Neves, RB Leipzig\u2019s Konrad Laimer and Sheffield United\u2019s Sander Berge are more immediate options. The boos that are still ringing in Steven Gerrard\u2019s ears have prompted him to intensify efforts to strengthen his Aston Villa defence by bringing in Jan Bednarek from Southampton on loan. Ajax will move for Hakim Ziyech to replace Manchester United-bound Antony, who will do well at Old Trafford if his prolific mentions in this gossip column are anything to go by.  Brendan Rodgers wants to inject a bit of life into his stale Leicester squad by snaffling Matheus Pereira away from Saudi Arabia\u2019s Al Hilal. The flying winger last made headlines in England by becoming embroiled in a row with former West Brom manager Val\u00e9rien Isma\u00ebl over his commitment to the club. Could be interesting. Harry Winks is this close to joining Sampdoria from Tottenham and Chelsea\u2019s Callum Hudson-Odoi is just a medical away from a season-long loan move to Bayer Leverkusen. Ethan Ampadu is on his way out of Stamford Bridge, too. The Wales utility man is set for a loan move to Spezia, who have the option to buy at a cool \u00a312.5m. Reports here say that Cristiano Ronaldo is knocking at the Stamford Bridge door hoping to play Champions League football. Won\u2019t somebody just let him in? And the word is that Manchester City will hand \u00a3100m to Pep Guardiola and tell him to \u201cgo and buy yourself something nice\u201d if anyone catches his eye at the Qatar World Cup."

                    "body": "Two weeks ago, Australia\u2019s Lauren Jackson \u2013 perhaps the greatest female basketball player of all time \u2013 told me she did not believe in fairytales. No matter. On Saturday, Jackson farewelled her remarkable career in true fairytale fashion. It would be hard to script a more appropriate ending. On home soil, the Opals beat Canada to win the bronze medal \u2013 or \u201crose gold,\u201d as Australian fans like to say \u2013 at the Fiba Women\u2019s World Cup. Jackson reprised her form of old, leading the scoring with 30 points, to add a fourth World Cup medal to her tally (alongside four Olympic medals).  It was a comeback no one anticipated. Jackson, 41, who made her national team debut a quarter of a century ago, had retired from basketball in 2016 due to injury. A farewell at the Rio Olympics was dashed as her efforts at rehabilitation floundered. The giant forward was never given the opportunity to go out on a high. Until now. Jackson retired to her hometown of Albury. She had two children and took up a managerial role with Basketball Australia. With the help of medical marijuana, she was eventually able to return to the court \u2013 for social, mixed basketball. But international basketball remained a world away. But then, one thing led to another. A comeback in the domestic league. A return to the Opals training camp. A call-up to the squad for the World Cup. And, on Saturday, one last medal for Australia. Ever since Jackson burst onto the scene in the mid-1990s, she has been destined for greatness. An exhaustive list of career highlights would fill this entire column. A five-time WNBL champion in Australia. A two-time WNBA champion in the United States. An all-star, an MVP. Name the plaudit and Jackson has earned it. She has taken women\u2019s basketball, in Australia and around the world, to new heights. And she has consistently performed her best in national team colours. Of the five World Cups and four Olympics in which Jackson has played, she has won a medal in all but one (including, most memorably, the Opals\u2019 lone world championships crown, in 2006).  But without the events of the past two weeks, Jackson\u2019s legendary career would have always been marked by an asterisk. Hers would have been remembered as a remarkable career, but also a career cruelly cut short by injury. No longer. Having been denied the fairytale ending in 2016, Jackson has finally bowed out in circumstances befitting her elite status within the game. A truly appropriate ending to a career the likes of which Australian basketball may never see again. It may read like a Hollywood movie, a story foretold. But there was nothing inevitable about the Opals, with Jackson back, returning to the medal rounds in Sydney this week. The Australians were in disarray in Tokyo, having lost star player Liz Cambage. The team barely scraped through the group stage and were beaten convincingly by the United States in the quarter-finals. The scars of Cambage\u2019s exit from the team in controversial circumstances lingered within the playing group (and fair enough \u2013 the Opals were built around her, and had to switch tactically at the last moment).  A year on, the team has shown impressive growth and evolution. Accepting that Cambage appears unlikely to return to the national-team fold, the Opals have restructured on the court and focused on rebuilding team spirit off the court. Jackson has said how impressed she was with the atmosphere within the camp upon returning.  The team remains one in transition. New stars like Ezi Magbegor are shining through, and there is a core, experienced group. But equally, the Jackson generation is largely retired and veteran Marianna Tolo is reaching the end of her glittering career. Australia\u2019s loss to France, the Tokyo 2020 bronze medallists, in their opening match of the World Cup underscored lingering defensive frailties and missing offensive spark. Yet the Australians bounced back, going undefeated through the rest of the group stage and building momentum into the knock-out round. The team looked assured in a quarter-finals win over Belgium. Even a heartbreaking semi-final loss to China, by two points, was a remarkable show of improvement on the turmoil of recent years. And to recover and go on to comfortably defeat Canada, to win the Opals\u2019 sixth-ever World Cup medal, showed maturity and depth. Time stops for no one \u2013 even if Jackson has turned back the clock over the past two weeks. The Opals must now turn their minds to qualifying for the Paris Olympics, in two years\u2019 time, and begin preparing for yet another tilt at the gold medal which has always eluded them. Jackson will return to her role leading women\u2019s basketball for Basketball Australia (she cut down her work hours during the tournament, but was still firing away emails during downtime). By all accounts, Saturday\u2019s performance will be her last in the green and gold. But what a way to go out. One last dance for one of the best there has been. One last medal for Lauren Jackson."

                    "body": "There has been a long tradition of cricketing cross-pollination between England and Australia, which Michael Hussey neatly epitomises. He gave plenty to English cricket during his 60 County Championship games for Durham, Gloucestershire and Northamptonshire in the early noughties, plus another 118 appearances in short-ball competitions. In return \u2013 and this has not been an entirely equal relationship \u2013 England gave him the nickname Mr Cricket, earned in the Northants dressing room and widely adopted back home. Now Hussey is giving once again. When England, who face Ireland in the early hours of Wednesday in their second fixture, take on Australia in the T20 World Cup on Friday Hussey will be contributing to a distinct Aussie twang in their dressing room. Matthew Mott was tempted away from the Australian women\u2019s team to join England\u2019s white-ball side as head coach in May, and for this tournament has been joined by David Saker as bowling consultant, and by Hussey as batting specialist.  Hussey played England 48 times, winning on 27 of those occasions, seeing the rivalry between the nations from both sides \u2013 and his conclusion is that it\u2019s not a big deal. \u201cIt seems to be a big issue for everyone on the outside,\u201d he says. \u201cFor me, there\u2019s a much bigger picture than just that rivalry. I think it\u2019s a great opportunity to be involved with a new environment, a new team, a new country, to see how they go about it. \u201cIt\u2019s great for me to be able to learn, but also hopefully I can impart some of my knowledge and help a few of the players. It doesn\u2019t matter whether they\u2019re Indian, Australia, New Zealand or English, it doesn\u2019t bother me whatsoever.\u201d It is no longer unusual for a team to have foreign coaches \u2013 indeed, England\u2019s first two games in this tournament have been against Afghanistan, who have an English head coach, and Ireland, whose coach is South African. \u201cIt\u2019s the bigger picture really \u2013 why not bring different thoughts and ideas?\u201d Hussey adds. \u201cBut also for coaches around the world, being able to get experience in different environments is fantastic for our development, so it\u2019s a win-win.\u201d Friday\u2019s fixture is however one in which only one side can prevail, and in which English success would be disastrous for his own nation \u2013 though the possibility of Australia\u2019s elimination is another issue which he thinks is being overplayed. \u201cAll that stuff about knocking Australia out of the tournament or keeping them in, they\u2019re external distractions for the team,\u201d Hussey says. \u201cWe can\u2019t focus on that, that\u2019s not even motivation for this team. Our motivation is looking after our backyard, playing how we want to play, and then hopefully that\u2019s enough to win the game. Then hopefully all those other teams will take care of themselves.\u201d  Hussey started working with England when they arrived in Australia three weeks ago, and will leave at the end of the World Cup. He is a genial presence at training, with a natural and disarming warmth, and has worked with some of England\u2019s players before \u2013 most notably with Moeen Ali at Chennai Super Kings \u2013 but rapidly building trust with the whole squad has been a challenge. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to make a big impact over a short period of time,\u201d he says. \u201cIt takes sometimes years to develop good, strong, trusting relationships where you can break down the barriers a bit further. Most of the guys know their own game pretty well, so it\u2019s about working with them and helping them to get into that mindset where they can just go out there and play their best cricket. I don\u2019t want to stuff things up, really.\u201d Though Hussey did not instantly accept England\u2019s invitation \u2013 \u201cI didn\u2019t have to think for too long but it did catch me by surprise,\u201d he said \u2013 he would have \u201cno issues whatsoever\u201d with helping their Test side beat Australia in next summer\u2019s Ashes if invited, and that his character might be a useful contrast to that of England\u2019s red-ball coach, Brendon McCullum. He certainly does not mind being contrary, notably disagreeing with the general preference in T20s for batting second. \u201cI don\u2019t think it matters so much,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you\u2019re batting first sometimes you\u2019re not sure what a good score is, but I feel as though with the conditions the way they are in Australia, especially early season, if you can get a decent score on the board you can build up enormous pressure on the opposition. The way I was brought up was always to get runs on the board, but obviously the game\u2019s changed so much.\u201d"

                    "body": "Everton fans planned to demonstrate against the \u201cincompetent management\u201d of owner Farhad Moshiri and the club\u2019s board at Goodison Park next month. The protests were brought forward by an incompetent display from Frank Lampard\u2019s team that invited a confident, stylish Brighton to record their highest scoring away win of the Premier League era. Chants of \u201cSack the board\u201d echoed around the stadium after Brighton\u2019s third and fourth goals and the final whistle as Goodison vented its fury with years of waste and woeful decision making under Moshiri and chairman Bill Kenwright.  Roberto De Zerbi\u2019s buoyant side struck three times in six second-half minutes as Everton produced the kind of error-strewn meltdown that leaves a manager fearing for his job. Brighton, everything Everton are not in terms of their excellent recruitment, clear strategy, sound financial planning and intelligent style of play, capitalised with ease to condemn Lampard\u2019s team to a third successive home defeat and an eighth loss in 11 matches in all competitions. Kaoru Mitoma, Evan Ferguson, the 18-year-old Ireland striker who was hugely impressive on his full Premier League debut, Solly March and Pascal Gross were all on the scoresheet. There was no consolation for Lampard in the fact it could have been more. Many more. Brighton boast the best away record outside the current top four and it was not hard to see why. Their defensive cohesion and quality on the counterattack was evident all night, although the demanding De Zerbi wanted more. \u201cI didn\u2019t like the quality of our play in the build-up or in defensive spaces in the first half,\u201d the Brighton manager said. \u201cWe had to ask more from ourselves and the second half was amazing.\u201d Everton made a vibrant start, with Alex Iwobi forcing Robert S\u00e1nchez into the first save of the game. After that fifth-minute effort, however, the hosts\u2019 lack of ideas became painfully apparent. Dominic Calvert-Lewin was fit to start only his sixth league game of the season and was cruelly booed off when substituted late on, having been starved of service all night. Brighton had World Cup winner Alexis Mac Allister on the bench after his return from well-earned celebrations in Argentina and another of their Qatar contingent, Moises Caicedo, back in midfield after suspension. It was Caicedo\u2019s curling, crossfield pass towards Mitoma that created the breakthrough. Nathan Patterson badly misread the flight of the ball and his failure to intercept gave the Brighton winger a clear run at Jordan Pickford\u2019s goal. Conor Coady over-committed as he attempted to block Mitoma\u2019s path, leaving him with a simple finish beyond Pickford and James Tarkowski\u2019s desperate lunge. Ferguson made a fine impression on his first Premier League start and almost doubled Brighton\u2019s advantage from another incisive move down the left. Pervis Estupi\u00f1\u00e1n led a break before Mitoma centred for Ferguson, who hooked an awkward shot beyond Pickford only to strike the base of a post. The teenager went close again with a 25-yard drive that sailed inches over the Everton goalkeeper\u2019s crossbar. The home crowd were growing restless before the break at Everton\u2019s pedestrian display. Restlessness turned into revolt and revulsion when their team conspired to concede three goals in six truly shambolic minutes. Each one was a defensive calamity, but testament to the belief and talent running through the Brighton ranks.  Ferguson grabbed the goal he deserved when Everton were prised open by another Caicedo crossfield ball. Estupi\u00f1\u00e1n pierced the home rearguard with a fine pass into the impressive Jeremy Sarmiento, a ball that Gana Gueye failed to intercept, and the Ecuador international rolled Patterson with ease before pulling a cross back for the unmarked striker to convert at close range. \u201cHe has all the qualities to become a great striker,\u201d said De Zerbi. Everton were three down within two minutes. Coady lost out to Sarmiento in an aerial challenge and Ferguson spread play to March in space on the right. The winger cut inside non-existent challenges from Vitalii Mykolenko and the tumbling Tarkowski and simply rolled a shot past a static Pickford into the bottom corner. Three minutes later it was four. And the worst of the lot. It began badly enough with an Everton free-kick deep in Brighton territory that Demarai Gray blazed over a crowded penalty area. Gana Gueye retrieved possession near the half way line and turned the laziest of a back passes in-field to Gross, who sprinted half the length of the pitch before chipping a polished finish over Pickford. Brighton created enough good situations thereafter to have won by six or seven. But they had already won at a canter. It fell to Gray to complete the scoring with a stoppage-time penalty given when Iwobi was upended by Sanchez. It counted for nothing."

That explains why the Monaco forward refrained from celebrating one of the simplest, yet potentially most significant, goals he will ever score.\nIn an awkward group also featuring Brazil and Serbia, this was a game Switzerland needed to win and, in the 48th minute, Embolo ensured it would prove mission accomplished.\nIt was not Embolo\u2019s fault his six-yard finish drove a stake through Cameroonian hearts as the chances of their team progressing beyond the group stage for the first time since Italia 90 receded appreciably. \n\n\u201cFootball writes these stories,\u201d Murat Yakin, the Swiss coach, said. \u201cI told Breel: \u2018Cameroon are your friends but they are your opponents too.\u2019 I\u2019m happy with his performance.\u201d\nThe opening week of Qatar 2022 has showcased plenty of intricate passing, intelligent movement and sometimes kaleidoscopic positional interchanging but Cameroon introduced a retro theme, reminding everyone that crashing balls into the corners has not necessarily had its day.\nThe gameplan was centred heavily on getting the ball long and early to Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting. The Bayern Munich striker remains familiar to his former public at Stoke, and so does Switzerland\u2019s Xherdan Shaqiri. Now with Chicago Fire, Shaqiri, who also retains a certain fanclub at Liverpool, is Switzerland\u2019s creative catalyst but took time to get going.\nShaqiri\u2019s every first-half manoeuvre was heavily shadowed by Cameroon\u2019s left-back, Nouhou Tolo. When Shaqiri switched wings he experienced similar treatment from Collins Fai.\nSuch early struggles dictated that although the Indomitable Lions did not always get their own way in a central midfield staffed for Switzerland by Arsenal\u2019s Granit Xhaka and Nottingham Forest\u2019s Remo Freuler, they were frequently free to concentrate on feeding Choupo-Moting.\n\nYakin had left Newcastle\u2019s Fabian Sch\u00e4r on the bench and instead paired Nico Elvedi and Manchester City\u2019s Manuel Akanji in central defence. Choupo-Moting, before fading, revelled in subjecting that pair to a thorough workout, on one occasion flicking the ball beyond Akanji only to shoot tepidly at Yann Sommer.\nAn even better chance arrived when Brentford\u2019s Bryan Mbeumo \u2013 whose right-sided advances sporadically menaced \u2013 unleashed a shot that Sommer parried into the path of the well-placed Karl Toko Ekambi, whose effort veered wildly off target. Otherwise, Toko Ekambi found himself efficiently, and intelligently, marked by Silvan Widmer.\nRigobert\u2019s Song\u2019s tactics may have been straight out of the Sam Allardyce playbook but as the impressive Sommer saved again, this time from Martin Hongla, Switzerland looked rattled. By half-time they had barely threatened, failing to muster an effort on target. Moreover, Cameroon\u2019s key midfielder, Napoli\u2019s Andr\u00e9-Frank Zambo Anguissa, had finished the first 45 minutes strongly and looked capable of disrupting the Freuler-Xhaka axis.\nYet for all Cameroon\u2019s high-pressing, full-back-propelled counterattacking, their defence looked a bundle of nerves on those, admittedly strictly rationed, occasions Switzerland delivered the ball into their penalty area. \nFrom one such incursion in the 45th minute they should have scored but Akanji botched an inviting headed opening after meeting Freuler\u2019s corner.\nMaybe that miss galvanised Switzerland, who emerged for the second half in altogether slicker, sharper passing mode and were swiftly rewarded when Embolo struck.\nWith the defence having lost concentration Shaqiri was permitted to capitalise on smart approach work from Xhaka and Freuler and sent a low cross curving towards the similarly unattended scorer. All that remained was for Embolo, who has established a charity foundation helping refugees in Switzerland and disadvantaged children in Cameroon, to stroke the ball home from six yards before that impassive reaction.\nIt was Switzerland\u2019s first shot on target and, briefly, the African drums and vuvuzelas \u2013 which had been making quite a noise on the Doha metro early on Thursday \u2013 fell silent. \nThe soundtrack had resumed by the time Zambo Anguissa\u2019s superb interception prevented Embolo from registering another goal and Andr\u00e9 Onana\u2019s fabulous diving save denied Ruben Vargas.\nAfter that Switzerland retreated deep, packing their defence. With Choupo-Moting a shadow of his first-half self, Cameroon could find no way through.\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to lose a game we dominated in the first half,\u201d Song said. \u201cI feel disappointed but we have only three players with previous World Cup experience \u2013 and there are two more games.\u201d"

                    "body": "After Ireland qualified for Group 1 of the Super 12s there was some excitement among England\u2019s players about the prospect of coming up against them. \u201cAny time Ireland plays England at any sport they want to beat England, so that\u2019ll be a big game,\u201d said Mark Wood. Chris Woakes said it was \u201ca huge game for both teams\u201d. But when the Ireland bowler Mark Adair is asked to describe his level of anticipation for Wednesday\u2019s game he appears less enthusiastic than he is puzzled.  \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he says. I stammer something about history and rivalry and tradition but Adair is having none of it. \u201cAny time you play one of the top teams it\u2019s a big occasion but I\u2019m not sure you can say playing England would be any bigger than playing against Pakistan or India.\u201d Over the past 12 months Ireland played T20s against half of the sides who qualified directly into the Super 12s \u2013 India, New Zealand, Afghanistan and South Africa. These games are not novelties for them any more. \u201cI think we\u2019re ready,\u201d Adair says. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make those steps so that these wins, and World Cups, are no longer shocks; they\u2019re no longer upsets. They\u2019re just a good cricket team putting in a good performance.\u201d For all that, having lost their opening game of the T20 World Cup to Zimbabwe there was little expectation they would end the opening group stage by beating West Indies, the result they needed to qualify for this round \u2013 particularly having lost their final match of last year\u2019s opening group, again with qualification on the line, to Namibia. This time, however, they won emphatically. \u201cYou never learn any lessons from winning,\u201d Adair says. \u201cYou always learn your lessons from losing and the Namibia game was something that we looked at as a group. But our last four games against the West Indies, we\u2019ve won three of them. That\u2019s across the formats. \u201cWe\u2019ve played against some good opposition this year and results haven\u2019t gone our way, so we know that as a team we have strong performances in us. It was just nice to be on the right end of the result this time.\u201d The aim is to get a few more. While England opened the Super 12s with a five-wicket win over Afghanistan Ireland started on Sunday with a nine-wicket defeat by their fellow qualifiers, Sri Lanka. They are the longest of long shots to reach the semi-finals but capable of pulling off a shock or two before the tournament is out. Again, though, Adair is approaching it a little differently.  \u201cThe more time we spend focusing on our performance and the less time we focus on the results, the results will look after themselves,\u201d he says. \u201cWe set out for the first qualifying stage with the intent to qualify and we have done. Now we want to see where we can go.\u201d This will be Adair\u2019s fourth game against England. After coming through the academy at Warwickshire he was released in 2017 after a couple of injury-blighted seasons as a professional. Then 21, he continued to rise through the game in Ireland and made his international debut against England in May 2019, and was involved in Ireland\u2019s brilliant ODI win at the Ageas Bowl in 2020. In between he played in the 2019 Test at Lord\u2019s, where England were bowled out for 85 in their first innings before recovering to win. Adair took three wickets on that first day, including Joe Root\u2019s. \u201cIf you look through that England lineup I\u2019m not sure there are any names on that list you wouldn\u2019t want, and you\u2019re certainly not giving any of them back,\u201d he says. \u201cHe was the skipper at the time and one of the best batters in the world, potentially England\u2019s best ever, so that\u2019s a great personal achievement, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really anything to get caught up on. You\u2019re not so much trying to get individual guys out for yourself \u2013 you\u2019ll not be staying in cricket for too long if that\u2019s the way you look at things.\u201d Surely there must be moments, even in team sports, when an individual allows themselves to enjoy their achievements? \u201cAbsolutely, but the best way to do that is with your teammates and in a team environment,\u201d Adair says. \u201cOther people celebrating your achievements is a lot more special than you celebrating your own.\u201d And so to Wednesday, just another game for a team on the up, and the dream of more collective celebrations. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing better than celebrating a win with your teammates,\u201d Adair says. \u201cYou almost start to crave those moments again, and that\u2019s why you continue to play. That\u2019s why you continue trying to perform. When I\u2019m a bit older and I\u2019m chatting with my kids about it in years to come I think, hopefully, they\u2019ll find it pretty impressive.\u201d"

                    "body": "The architects of the Paris agreement have urged world leaders to reach an ambitious sister deal for nature at the Cop15 biodiversity conference this December while warning that limiting global heating to 1.5C is impossible without protecting and restoring ecosystems. On biodiversity day at the Cop27 climate conference in Egypt, Christiana Figueres, Laurence Tubiana, Laurent Fabius and Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, who helped design the Paris agreement, said that Cop15 would be an \u201cunprecedented\u201d opportunity to turn the tide on nature loss. It follows scientific warnings that humans are driving the sixth mass extinction of life on Earth, with 1m species in danger of extinction. The biodiversity summit takes place in Montreal, Canada just two weeks after Cop27 in Egypt, where governments will negotiate this decade\u2019s targets on preventing biodiversity loss. Despite the ominous scientific warnings about the health of the planet and the consequences for human civilisation, no world leaders are scheduled to attend the meeting, which clashes with the football World Cup in Qatar. In a separate announcement, a group of nearly 350 scientists, Indigenous peoples, businesses and NGOs have urged presidents and prime ministers to prioritise the nature summit. \u201cLeaders must secure a global agreement for biodiversity which is as ambitious, science-based and comprehensive as the Paris agreement is for climate change. Like the Paris agreement, it must encourage countries to pledge and also ratchet up their action commensurate with the size of the challenge,\u201d said the joint statement by the designers of the Paris climate agreement. \u201cThere is no pathway to limiting global warming to 1.5C without action on protecting and restoring nature. Only by taking urgent action to halt and reverse the loss of nature this decade, while continuing to step up efforts to rapidly decarbonise our economies, can we hope to achieve the promise of the Paris agreement,\u201d it reads. \u201cIt must be inclusive, rights-based and work for all. And it must deliver, through the whole of society, immediate action on the ground \u2013 our future depends on it,\u201d it continues. Figueres, Tubiana, Fabius and Pulgar-Vidal said that humanity\u2019s \u201caccelerating destruction of nature is undermining its abilities to provide crucial services, including climate change mitigation and adaptation. As with climate change, it is the most vulnerable communities who bear the greatest impacts of biodiversity loss, from loss of food security and livelihoods to decreased climate resilience. The climate and nature agendas are entwined.\u201d On Tuesday, ministers from about 30 countries met in Sharm el-Sheikh at a side event co-hosted by Canada and China to discuss the draft nature agreement, formally known as the post-2020 biodiversity framework. Sticking points in negotiations were discussed by governments, including financial backing for the agreement. At Cop15, China is overseeing a major UN agreement for the first time and holds the presidency, although its leaders have played a modest role so far, prompting fears that the biodiversity summit could be nature\u2019s \u201cCopenhagen moment\u201d, a reference to the conference where climate talks fell apart in 2009. Cop15 was moved from China to Canada after several pandemic-related delays and no world leaders have been invited by Beijing amid fears they are trying to downplay the event so as not to embarrass Xi Jinping, who is not expected to attend. Helena Gualinga, a Kichwa indigenous youth climate leader from Sarayaku, Ecuador, said Cop15 was a \u201conce-in-a-decade opportunity to agree a global deal for nature\u201d and leaders needed to attend and produce an ambitious final agreement. \u201cNature and the future of the climate is at stake, and we will not be safe until leaders are held accountable. For generations, my community has coexisted with nature, while witnessing extraction and deforestation of our territories devastate wildlife, nature and people. Our existence is our resistance, when we uphold our Indigenous rights we safeguard key ecosystems for the planet. We only have this decade to turn things around, yet governments are failing their responsibilities. Cop15 in Montreal is a once-in-a-decade opportunity to agree a global deal for nature, and we need leaders to show up and deliver,\u201d she said. Scientist Johan Rockstr\u00f6m, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research said nature was crucial to keeping global heating within 1.5C of pre-industrial levels. \u201cTo have a 50% chance of achieving 1.5C and thus limiting tipping point risks, global greenhouse gas emissions must be cut by half by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050,\u201d he said. \u201cCritically, these pathways rely on the continuing capacity of nature to operate as a carbon sink and to buffer against the worst impacts of climate change \u2013 1.5C is not a goal, it is a biophysical limit. Nature is one of the best climate solutions for remaining within that limit. An ambitious global framework for biodiversity at Cop15 that addresses root causes of decline of the global commons is urgent and necessary.\u201d Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow the Guardian\u2019s biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"

                    "body": "Midway up the stands inside Wembley, the signage flashes with \u201cEuropean v world champions\u201d. The buildup to England\u2019s showdown with the USA has been overshadowed, rightly, by the weight of the findings of the Sally Yates report into abuses in women\u2019s football in the States and the burden of it on the US players, but the narrative of the match itself is hugely exciting.\nThe USA have been the world leaders in women\u2019s football for a long time. The gap to the rest has been vast, but it is closing. Megan Rapinoe went as far as to say on Thursday that she feels \u201cthere isn\u2019t really a huge gap any more and there hasn\u2019t been for a long time\u201d.\n\nWhy, though, has a gap existed for so long despite continued and increasing investment in England?\nThere are a number of reasons why the US have led the way. Most significant was the introduction of Title IX, part of the education amendments to the Civil Rights Act in 1972. Title IX decreed that government-funded institutions could not discriminate on the basis of sex. It meant educational institutions had to rebalance their funding of sports programmes: to continue large backing for key men\u2019s sports such as American football and basketball meant putting the same amount into women\u2019s sports. \nThat has created a player pool that is the envy of the world, with scholarships allowing players from the US, and across the globe, to receive a high-quality education and play incredibly competitive football. With that has come a culture of competitiveness and expectation \u2013 which contrasts greatly with the gratitude culture that has existed in England. In the US, women have a right to play football and for it to be properly funded, and they expect it to be.\nThe US women\u2019s national team, and the various professional leagues that have been formed over the years, have been built on top of this base of talent and support \u2013 although as recent investigations show, the system is very far from perfect.\nWomen\u2019s football in the US also benefits from not being hidden in the shadows of the men\u2019s game. Football is not the number one sport for men, and that has given the women\u2019s game space to flourish.\nSeven players in this England camp and the manager, Sarina Wiegman, have played in the US and experienced what makes it so different.\n\u201cI was there for one year, a long time ago, as I\u2019m really old,\u201d said Wiegman, with a characteristically wry smile. \u201cIt was life-changing. We had a really top sports environment with lots of great facilities. I really enjoyed it. That winning mentality really came across. I was 19 at the time. I thought: when I go back to the Netherlands I hope there comes a time that we have the same facilities and environment there, as I really loved it. It influenced me in my development as a person.\u201d\nLucy Bronze, who, like Wiegman, played under the renowned University of North Carolina coach Anson Dorrance, said: \u201cI think it had probably one of the biggest influences at an important time in my career. When I was younger, in Europe, in general, women\u2019s football wasn\u2019t really a huge spectacle. Whereas in America, everything was amazing. Going out there and playing at college for a year was a dream come true and made me realise that\u2019s really what I wanted to do.\n\n\u201cPlaying with the players there who went on to be so successful at such a young age, at 17, it had a huge influence on me as a player and a person. Their mentality \u2013 learning that at 17 years old \u2013 I think that\u2019s what has helped me grow my mentality in an England environment.\u201d\nThere, Bronze came up against a young Tobin Heath. \u201cTobin had broken into the US team and was the first player that I really played with who was that world-class standard and I got to go head-to-head, literally head-to-head, with her in training sessions,\u201d Bronze said. \u201cI realised that I need to work a lot harder and push myself if I want to compete against those kinds of players.\u201d\nWomen\u2019s teams in Europe and across the world, domestic and international, have had to try to find a way to build a base that rivals the US system that allows players to flourish and creates such a huge pool that the best can be skimmed off the top.\nThe Football Association\u2019s Gameplan for Growth in 2017 started to look at the game in England in this way, with ambitions to build the base as much as it built and invested in the top of the sport. The investment has come and work has been done in growing all areas, from grassroots and school football to the England pathway and the fanbase.\nThe Lionesses\u2019 success at the Euros in the summer sits on the shoulders of this work. Now, England have depth to rival the US in a way that had not been there before and players are able to play in professional environments from an early age.\nThe gap isn\u2019t closed. Until the US are toppled by England at a World Cup it cannot be said to have closed. Even then, establishing a player pool as deep as the college system provides in the US is still a long way off."

                    "body": "A home win in regulation this might have been. But this comfortable victory over Bournemouth was as welcome as it was necessary for Graham Potter. First-half goals from World Cup returnees Kai Havertz and Mason Mount made what could have been an awkward evening one of relief and, largely, satisfaction. The statistical gurus stroked their keyboards in anticipation, ready to pounce on any Chelsea mishap, which, given this fixture\u2019s recent history, was a genuine concern. Chelsea will feel they ought to have added more gloss and the one blemish of the evening was a real kicker \u2013 early in the second half Reece James suffered what appeared to be a recurrence of the right-knee injury that caused him to miss Qatar.  Up to that point, James\u2019s every touch was cheered. And there were plenty of them, his combination with Raheem Sterling, who hugged the right touchline, was electric. Many present ought to have uttered the words \u201cif only\u201d. But with eyes elsewhere, James played a routine pass and then signalled immediately to the bench. A hush descended as James sat down, covering his face with his hands. Everyone knew what it meant. \u201cReece James, he\u2019s one of our own,\u201d echoed down the Kings Road. The full-back at least headed down the tunnel unaided, but his expression was desolate. \u201cTo see him go off affects the stadium, affects the team, it affects everything,\u201d said Potter by way of mitigation for a performance that dipped slightly after James\u2019s departure. \u201cIt\u2019s not an excuse. But we are human beings as well, he is someone we care about.\u201d This is not a result for Potter to get carried away with. He is not likely to anyway, but it does at least end a five-match winless streak in the league. And there can be genuine cause for excitement at Raheem Sterling\u2019s showing, while Havertz will take confidence from both his strike and performance. If Chelsea were weakened by absent faces \u2013 among them Hakim Ziyech and Mateo Kovacic \u2013 it did not show. They settled confidently into their work, neat triangles of passing on display everywhere. Denis Zakaria, on his league debut, added central energy lacking previously, and Christian Pulisic showed plenty of spark.  It was the American who believed he had earned an early penalty when bursting into the area with Adam Smith clinging, albeit lightly, to his shirt. Pulisic stayed up to get his shot away, and was joined on his feet by Chelsea\u2019s entire bench. VAR said no. One of those \u201canywhere else it\u2019s a foul\u201d moments, and given Smith was not attempting to play the ball, it might have had serious consequences. It soon became a moot point. Mount found Sterling, whose inch-perfect first-time cross had Havertz sliding to poke past Mark Travers. Potter\u2019s hands shot from his pockets and pummelled the air with gusto. Eight minutes later, Chelsea doubled their lead. Havertz turned provider, recycling a loose ball to tee up Mount, who marked his 150th Chelsea start with a superb low curler that nestled in the net. The entirety of Stamford Bridge believed Chelsea had a third but Potter\u2019s celebration of Pulisic\u2019s finish quickly turned to remonstration; referee Simon Hooper penalised Havertz for a foul in the buildup. That all came before the break, and while, initially at least, Chelsea\u2019s performance level barely dropped after the match restarted, sadly their hearts did with James\u2019s departure. Even without his right-flank partner though, Sterling continued to dazzle. Direct, poised and sassy, a mazy run of his deserved better than the finish an open-bodied Havertz offered. Bournemouth had their moments in the second half. To call them plucky is a tad harsh; they improved as the game grew, and these are not the nights on which their season will turn. But they started way too sluggishly, barely landing a punch until the closing stages. \u201cWe struggled to get to grips with how they started,\u201d Gary O\u2019Neil admitted. \u201cThe start killed us. It\u2019s really difficult from that point to wrestle your way back into it.\u201d The fruits of Bournemouth\u2019s sorry opening half were a Philip Billing free-kick that Kepa Arrizabalaga dealt with comfortably. Had Arrizabalaga not blocked the substitute Ryan Christie\u2019s shot much later, there may have been a grandstand finish. Instead, O\u2019Neil\u2019s first match as permanent manager ended in defeat. While the Premier League slept, Bournemouth were active, O\u2019Neil earning an 18-month contract on the back of his success as interim manager. He was never supposed to be anything more than a stop-gap, but has been quietly impressive. Much like he was as a player, really. And he now ultimately reports to Bill Foley after the American\u2019s consortium completed its takeover. Funds will be made available in January and O\u2019Neil must spend them wisely. For Potter, it was simply job done and on to the next one."

                    "body": "Dani Carvajal was standing beneath the stand at Al Bayt Stadium, talking to journalists in the mixed zone when his Real Madrid clubmate Antonio R\u00fcdiger appeared, sidled up to him and whispered something in his ear, laughing as he left. There was a smile and then the words were revealed, exactly as everyone imagined. \u201cYes, yes,\u201d the Spain full-back said. \u201cHe told me to beat Japan.\u201d\nSpain and Germany had just drawn, leaving everything open for the final round of games. The selecci\u00f3n had played well for an hour but then lost control after taking the lead, saw Niclas F\u00fcllkrug score an equaliser, and in the end might even have been beaten, Luis Enrique admitted. Ultimately, though, the manager insisted that Spain were in a good position: \u201cTop of the group of death, the only group that got \u2018oohs\u2019 when the draw was made.\u201d\nAll four teams could still progress. Spain still need a point to go through, while a win would guarantee top spot. Although they are bottom, Germany could go through if they beat Costa Rica, but here\u2019s the thing: they would need Japan to lose to Spain. If the other game ends in a draw, Germany would need to win by at least two goals against Costa Rica or by a single-goal margin so long as they score more than Japan do against Spain.\n\nIf that sounds complicated, strip it all away and it\u2019s simple: as R\u00fcdiger said, Germany could really, really do with Spain beating Japan. He was not the only one either. Dani Olmo was laughing too, revealing that his RB Leipzig teammate David Raum had made the same request.\nA couple of days before their second group game, when they knew a win would qualify them with a game to spare, the Spain midfielder Carlos Soler said it was not just about getting through, although that was what mattered most; it was also an opportunity to knock Germany out. He had nothing against them. There was no dislike, not even a rivalry, just a reality. It would, in truth, be better not to have to face them again.\nThat opportunity was not taken, but it presents itself again now. Well, sort of. It is different now. Last time it came as a consequence of winning; this time it would come as a consequence of not winning. Nor is it clearcut, the combinations too complex for that, both from Spain\u2019s point of view and Japan\u2019s. But it has not gone unnoticed that a draw between Spain and Japan could mean both going through at Germany\u2019s expense.\n\nThose combinations, the possibility of in effect having a mutually beneficial pact to put someone else out, is the reason the final group-stage games are played simultaneously. That change was prompted by what has become known as the Disgrace of Gij\u00f3n, when West Germany and Austria conspired to play out a 1-0 win for the former to send both sides through and knock Algeria out of the 1982 World Cup. Gij\u00f3n is Luis Enrique\u2019s home city, and he was 12 at the time. He didn\u2019t go, but he did try to get in.\nA biscotto, they call it: a biscuit. Sometimes that\u2019s the way the cookie crumbles. But not this time. Luis Enrique said tiredness was becoming a factor and it was notable that he mentioned Sergio Busquets having a yellow card that puts him a booking away from suspension. There is another element, too: finishing second rather than first might even be beneficial, if you consider potentially avoiding Brazil in a quarter-final to be a good thing. But the coach insisted Spain would play to win, no matter what. And indeed, amid all the speculation it has been forgotten that they could still go out. As for Japan, a draw offers no guarantees. A win for them and Spain would be in trouble.\n\u201c[R\u00fcdiger] told me to beat Japan; there are no doubts that we will go out to win,\u201d Carvajal said. \u201cWe want to be top, we want to win every game and we will do everything we can to achieve that.\u201d\n\nOlmo agreed: \u201cWe always want to win. If we win we will be in the last 16, and that\u2019s what we want. Today was a pity but we will keep trying. The feeling is bittersweet. We lost control after the goal, and lost balls that we don\u2019t usually lose. We have to be calmer and keep longer spells of possession, play the way we always try to do.\u201d\nFor Germany, there was a reprieve. Costa Rica\u2019s surprise win over Japan and their equaliser against Spain gives them an opportunity, even if they may need help from clubmates. \u201cIf you look at the 90 minutes, a draw is OK and of course we take it: now everything is about the last game,\u201d Ilkay G\u00fcndogan said. \u201cThe disappointment was huge after that first game, even [for] me personally to be honest. The day after, even the second day after, it felt like it was unnecessary. Getting a good result was crucial for us today.\u201d\nThe Manchester City midfielder also explained why Germany had not repeated their protest from the first match, when they had posed for the team picture with their hands over their mouths, after Manuel Neuer as captain was banned from wearing the OneLove armband. \u201cWe had a few players who are mad with Fifa because there were things planned from the team and then [with] this getting disallowed just before the game, a few players were disappointed and frustrated and wanted to show something. We had a discussion in the team and it got decided that we will do the gesture against Fifa,\u201d he said.\n\u201cHonestly, my point of view is that now the politics is finished. Qatar is very proud, the country is proud to host the World Cup, it\u2019s the first Muslim country \u2013 I come from a Muslim family \u2013 so the Muslim community is proud. So I think it is now about football, enjoying it.\u201d"

                    "body": "Cometh the hour, cometh the absolute bedlam. It all came down to the final over, a few wild minutes in which everything that could happen did, and quite a few things that couldn\u2019t also did.\nAt the start of that over India needed 16 off six to steal victory. At the end of it Mohammad Nawaz had bowled nine, Virat Kohli had been bowled off a free hit (and run three byes), there had been a six, a no-ball, two wides, a catch and a stumping, and Kohli was running around with his arms in the air. \u201cI honestly have no words,\u201d he said a few moments later. \u201cI have no idea how that happened.\u201d\n\nKohli produced an innings for the ages to drag his side off the floor, scoring 82 off 53 balls, adding 113 for the fifth wicket with Hardik Pandya, and India won by four wickets, but these are just numbers.\nThis was an extraordinary game and an extraordinary night, an occasion as much about the noise that swirled around this enormous bowl, the contributions of all 90,293 actors present in a supporting role, as the 22 on the field. When Rohit Sharma was asked for his reaction at the end, he said: \u201cI have no voice left.\u201d And he will not have been alone in that.\nThere is no fixture like this in world cricket. All the nonsense that surrounds International Cricket Council tournaments, all the sponsorship snafus and organisational issues, are worth it just to force these sides together. Even two hours before the start the atmosphere around the MCG, among the streams of fans heading towards the ground from Melbourne\u2019s city centre and the honking cars driving past them with more fans spilling out of the windows, was intoxicatingly raucous and joyful.\n\nThe noise from the stands varied throughout from extreme to absurd, with occasional very brief periods where one team\u2019s supporters or the other\u2019s briefly quietened. Both will have endured moments when they felt the game was lost.\nPakistan\u2019s came quickly, after they had been put in to bat and within four terrific overs were 15 for two with their openers, Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan, who so regularly and greedily gobble up most of their innings and score most of their runs, both out. Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Arshdeep Singh were both sensational in these early overs, even if it was the latter, and later Pandya, who hoovered up most of the wickets.\nShan Masood came in at three and for a while, as he offered and survived two run-out chances, his judgment appeared to have been completely cooked in the cauldron, but having survived them he and Iftikhar Ahmed resuscitated his side\u2019s chances with a partnership of 76. There was only a short period when Iftikhar truly reached top gear \u2013 amounting to little more than one mercilessly pulverised Axar Patel over \u2013 in which time he went from 25 off 24 balls to a half-century off 32, and for a few delicious moments Pakistan could ponder how far beyond 160 they might be able to go.\nHe was out two balls later and in the end they reached 159, thanks in part to a couple of entirely out\u2011of\u2011character shots from Shaheen Shah Afridi, who in the space of two balls doubled his career tally of both sixes and fours in this format.\n\nThen it was India\u2019s turn and, however awkwardly Pakistan started their innings, Shaheen, Naseem Shah and Haris Rauf ensured their opponents got it just as bad. At the end of their powerplay they were 31 for three, one run and one wicket worse off than Pakistan had been at the same stage, and a ball later Axar Patel was controversially given run out after a TV review, even though the ball was not in Rizwan\u2019s gloves when he broke the bails.\nThis brought Kohli and Pandya together, and eventually they heaved India out of the doldrums. Perhaps they were not always in control of the chase, but at least they looked like they believed they were. There was no sense of panic as the overs disappeared and the required run rate climbed and finally, with three overs to go and 48 needed, they shifted gear.\n\n\u201cWe were always wanting to make sure we stayed in the game as long as possible,\u201d Rohit said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking constantly about it. No matter what the situation, you\u2019ve got to believe you can pull through.\u201d\nThat belief will never have been stronger. Shaheen\u2019s final over went for 17 with three fours, Rauf\u2019s last for 15 with two wonderful Kohli sixes, and that left 16 to find off the last. Time, at last, for the real drama to start.\n\u201cFrom the situation we were in, to come out with victory it has to be not just his best knock, but one of India\u2019s best knocks,\u201d Rohit said.\nNone can have been more memorable.\n\u2022 This article was amended on 24 October 2022 to remove an image due to potential misidentification."

                    "body": "The goal just never came. Fulham were full of speed and invention but lacked the finishing touch to get past a busy but commanding Jordan Pickford. Everton, with Conor Coady organising, often handing out NFL-style congratulations to colleagues after clearances and blocks, doggedly held their line. They are such sterner opposition under Frank Lampard, their goals against record belonging in the top echelon. Scoring is more problematic; Dominic Calvert-Lewin was ever more in isolation as his 90 minutes dragged on.  Marco Silva spent 18 forgettable months at Everton, and despite reasonable grounds to consider himself a victim of a club in permanent flux, was forced to rebuild his reputation at Fulham. His Everton were rarely so enterprising. A similar reinvention process goes for Lampard at Everton. He has bought into being an Evertonian in a manner his Portuguese predecessor never managed. At full time the away contingent appeared happy enough with the latest demonstration of \u201cdogs of war\u201d values as Lampard hailed a \u201cwork, resilience and mindset we really didn\u2019t have last year\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to believe,\u201d said Silva, after his first game against his former employers. \u201cWe did almost everything well. Everton played a direct game, we knew that, and they created some moments but we are always on the front foot. Jordan Pickford and their defenders deserve credit, they block everything but we did everything to win.\u201d The England goalkeeper, who was man of the match, was far happier. \u201cI graft really hard and I like putting on performances,\u201d said Pickford. \u201cThe World Cup is around the corner so I\u2019ll keep my head focused.\u201d  Lampard said: \u201cKeepers can make or break you. When he plays like that he wins you points.\u201d Pickford had lifted Everton to mid-table respectability, though they are still just four points above the bottom three. Fulham\u2019s unlikely push for European football next season had meanwhile stalled. Calvert-Lewin probably needed a goal to boost an outside chance of joining Pickford in Qatar, particularly with Gareth Southgate watching Callum Wilson scoring twice for Newcastle. Everton\u2019s No 9, starting two games in a row for the first time since May, probably relies on others to fall by the wayside. After a bright start, he betrayed some rustiness, caught offside in a rare second-half Everton attack. At least his injury curse did not return. Chasing down Demarai Gray\u2019s low cross, he smashed his shoulder into the post but pronounced himself fine to continue.  In the first half, Everton played their full part in some end-to-end thrills amid unseasonably warm autumnal temperatures. Things occasionally got heated. The opposing No 9, Aleksandar Mitrovic, was lucky to escape with no more than a booking for a stamp on Idrissa Gueye, a decision that had Lampard baying for a video review. \u201cI think he knew,\u201d said Everton\u2019s manager. \u201cI was really surprised we didn\u2019t get given it.\u201d The Serb had earlier vaulted Coady and crumpled heavily. Here was some form of retribution, and a yellow did not stop Mitrovic continuing his running battle with the ever game Coady. Tim Ream heading wide before James Tarkowski headed straight at Bernd Leno from a corner was the last flicker of a fine first 45. The second began with a penalty claim, waved away by John Brooks, the referee. Willian was falling to the floor before Gueye rapped his ankle. As Fulham hunted a winner, Mitrovic had multiple chances, none of them quite falling right. A blazing over of Andreas Pereira\u2019s cross caused an anguished howl towards the football gods, as did a final-seconds chance, blasted over on the turn. \u201cMitro will score next time,\u201d reassured his manager but two points had been surrendered to Pickford, Coady et al."

                    "body": "Fikayo Tomori is unlikely to be emotional when he returns to Stamford Bridge. Calm and collected is the best way of describing the Milan centre-back. The impression is of a young man who does not like to get carried away, who knows his development as a footballer is far from over, and with that mentality there is every chance Tomori will approach the challenge of facing Chelsea with the same gracefulness that has typified his performances for Milan. At the same time Tomori will undoubtedly have a point to prove when he plays against his former club. From a wider perspective, it is a chance for Milan to lessen Chelsea\u2019s hopes of making it out of their Champions League group. On a personal note it is an opportunity for Tomori on two fronts: to push his case for inclusion in England\u2019s World Cup squad and to make Chelsea regret not fighting harder to keep him.  It did not have to be this way. In different circumstances Tomori easily could have been putting on a blue shirt and preparing to mark Olivier Giroud on Wednesday night. The irony is that the 24-year-old, who joined Milan on loan in January 2020, signed for them six months later and won Serie A last season, could have become a regular starter for Chelsea. A lack of foresight has ended up costing Chelsea a lot of money. After Tomori was relegated to fifth-choice centre-back at the start of the 2020-21 season, forcing him to look for a fresh opportunity, the pathway soon looked clearer. Kurt Zouma was sold to West Ham in the summer of 2021 and Chelsea, having seemingly been in a position of strength, found themselves scrambling to sign centre-backs after losing Andreas Christensen and Antonio R\u00fcdiger on free transfers this summer. Yet Tomori, who rose through Chelsea\u2019s academy and was brought into the first team by Frank Lampard in 2019, had gone. He did not fall out with Lampard, but the opportunities dried up. Milan made their move. They were long-time admirers of Tomori and his loan was sealed three days before Thomas Tuchel replaced Lampard. Tomori was heading down a new path. He did not panic when he made his Milan debut as an early substitute during a Coppa Italia tie against Internazionale. Thrown in at the deep end after an injury to Simon Kj\u00e6r, he took on Romelu Lukaku at San Siro, his performance drawing praise despite 10-man Milan losing in the last minute. There would be no looking back. Tomori has embraced the experience of living abroad, learning Italian and becoming a firm favourite with Milan\u2019s supporters. He quickly made himself integral to Stefano Pioli\u2019s plans, clicking with Kj\u00e6r, and made the loan permanent after helping Milan qualify for the Champions League for the first time in seven years. It was a reward for Tomori stepping out of his comfort zone. His problem was never a lack of talent. The quality was clear while he was rising up the Chelsea ranks. He often played at right-back but always looked destined to move into the middle. Lower-league loans helped. Spells with Hull and Brighton were followed by Lampard taking him and Mason Mount to Derby County in 2018. Derby narrowly missed out on promotion, but Tomori was named player of the year by supporters. At that stage it seemed Tomori\u2019s next move would be to a Premier League side. Everton were interested, only for an opening to appear when Chelsea sold David Luiz to Arsenal just before the start of the 2019-20 season. Lampard had left Derby for Chelsea, who were under a transfer embargo, and he decided to use Tomori because of his performances in training.  The gamble paid off. Comfortable in possession, Tomori caught the eye with a stunning goal during a 5-2 win over Wolves. He used his speed to handle Mohamed Salah during a defeat by Liverpool. Under pressure during an away game against Ajax, he played his way out of trouble by leaving Hakim Ziyech on the floor with a clever turn. But perhaps Tomori\u2019s inexperience caught up with him. There were flaws in his game; occasional lapses in concentration. Tomori drifted to the margins. Milan, the club of Paolo Maldini and Franco Baresi, have made him a more mature defender. His tactical awareness has improved \u2013 playing alongside the experienced Kj\u00e6r has helped, though there is also promise in Tomori\u2019s partnership with the 22-year-old Frenchman Pierre Kalulu \u2013 and he has become stronger. Equally Tomori, who signed a new five-year deal in August, has made Pioli\u2019s dynamic young side better. His pace allows them to play a high line and he was key to Milan winning their first Scudetto since 2011 last season. Leaving Chelsea has paid off. The only recent disappointment for Tomori was failing to play in England\u2019s Nations League ties against Italy and Germany, raising doubts over his place in Gareth Southgate\u2019s plans. One theory is that Tomori is paying the price for not playing in the Premier League. It makes his reunion with Chelsea, who visit San Siro next week, feel even more vital. Southgate will surely be looking at how Tomori handles Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Milan top their Champions League group with four points from two games, but they travel without a host of key players. The onus on Tomori is to step up and lead his team. He will need to hold his nerve."

This season\u2019s Premier League Handbook runs to 666 pages, and for new inductees to the faith its every word may as well be gospel. For example, there are 15 separate rules on floodlights (which must provide an average illuminance of at least 1000 lux, measured from 96 precise locations on the field). The press box must seat at least 50 journalists (up from 40 in the Championship). Television commentary positions must be at least three metres wide and one metre deep. Kit suppliers must be informed in writing about the Premier League\u2019s ban on minimum pricing. And on and on it goes, a bureaucratic epic that if nothing else demonstrates the extent to which this product is curated, delimited, plotted out to the tiniest degree.  Order out of chaos: this is the very essence of the Premier League, in many ways the very essence of football. You plan and you scheme and you train in the distant hope that after nine months, a little truth finally emerges from the melee. But it never quite turns out that way. There is always some eventuality or circumstance that has not been anticipated in advance, some untameable force that only becomes apparent in retrospect. Given a long enough timeline, chaos always wins. Everyone knew this season was coming for seven years. The decision to move the Qatar World Cup was announced by Fifa in 2015, but for most of the intervening period the colossal upheaval has simply been a vague blur on the horizon. Besides, of all the atrocities of Qatar 2022, fixture disruption was always some way down the list. Now the consequences can no longer be swerved. For the first time in the history of English football, a domestic campaign will be bisected by a men\u2019s World Cup.After we have accustomed ourselves to the weirdness of it all \u2013 a slightly easier task in the post-Covid world \u2013 comes the basic question of how it might play out. One school of thought goes that the biggest clubs, with a galaxy of top international stars slugging it out for a month in the desert heat, will suffer most. Manchester City lose their entire defence. Nottingham Forest, with the probable exception of Neco Williams, Brennan Johnson and Wayne Hennessey, get a lovely winter break. Alternatively, you could argue that the deepest squads will be able to cope best, abetted by the new rule allowing teams to use five substitutes.  This is a roundabout way of admitting that we really have no idea what\u2019s coming next. Has there ever been a season with a greater volume of unknowns, of new and moving parts, teams in flux and teams in transition? Even the relegation battle feels wildly open, with Forest spending heavily, Bournemouth barely spending at all and Fulham both unrecognisable from the squad that was relegated in 2021 and still curiously made of entirely the same substance. Forest look the likeliest of the three to keep their heads above water, with a smart coach in Steve Cooper and a playing style full of energy and purpose, quick switches and lightning counter-attacks. Leeds have invested strongly after the loss of Raphinha and Kalvin Phillips but remain a brittle little thing: tight-knit and well-drilled but still prone to wild mood swings. Everton, despite a shambolic pre-season, can\u2019t possibly be as bad as they were last year. But they will at some point require a functional midfield.  Usually at least one established club gets dragged towards the basement. Southampton have been defying gravity for years now, an atrophying squad held together only by the vigour of Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl and a miscellany of offcuts from big club academies. Brentford are still enjoying the view but will need everything to go their way this season. Brighton, Wolves and Crystal Palace should be well safe. West Ham will be a quietly thrilling prospect if they can add Filip Kostic at left wing-back to the signing of Gianluca Scamacca to thud home his crosses, although Kostic has so far been reluctant to join. Leicester have had rotten luck with injuries in the last couple of seasons and could again challenge the top six if they can keep their core squad fit. Aston Villa look appealing, with competition in all positions and a clutch of academy prospects on the cusp of maturity. Newcastle are perhaps the biggest unknown of all. A quiet summer on the transfer front suggests they are content with a season of mid-table consolidation, even if fans gorged on Saudi takeover money may expect much more. And so to the top six, where the sense of chaos is more acute than ever. How will Liverpool and Manchester City handle the transition to a more conventional setup based around a single target man? Is Erling Haaland a machine or a man? Can Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez possibly be worth \u00a385m? Are Tottenham an actual thing? Is Gabriel Jesus really going to get Arsenal 25 goals a season? Is it wise to try and play Ajax-ball with Cristiano Ronaldo up front? And what exactly are Chelsea these days?  The post-Roman Abramovich era brings only discombobulation and discontent to SW6. New owner Todd Boehly has made the requisite A-list signings \u2013 Raheem Sterling and Kalidou Koulibaly are serious players \u2013 but still you wonder where the goals are coming from. Manchester United have looked impressive in pre-season under Erik ten Hag. Ronaldo has been absent. These two facts may not be related. And yet a decade of accumulated dysfunction will take far more than one summer to roll back. For the 14th season in a row, meanwhile, Arsenal remain all potential. For the defending champions, the signing of Haaland is an unmitigated positive: City will still play in much the same way, only the chances that once fell to Sterling or Gabriel Jesus will now fall to Haaland, who will score them. Even a 90% City will win the Premier League this season. There are only really two notes of caution to be sounded.  Firstly, Pep Guardiola\u2019s side will lose around 16 players to the World Cup: pretty much their entire starting XI minus Haaland and Riyad Mahrez. Liverpool, by contrast, may escape with only nine or 10, with Mo Salah, Luis D\u00edaz, Naby Ke\u00efta and Andy Robertson all getting a rest. In a tight season where mental as well as physical stamina will be a vital point of difference, that may just be enough to bridge the gap. The other unknown is Tottenham. As fanciful as it sounds describing Matt Doherty as a potential Premier League champion, Antonio Conte has made plenty of stranger things happen in his coaching career. Spurs have strengthened in all areas, from defence to attack to fitness. A midfield of Rodrigo Bentancur and Yves Bissouma feels genuinely exciting. Obviously it\u2019s hard to see them actually winning the thing, because \u2026 Tottenham. But of the teams straining to break the duopoly, they currently look best placed. Feel free to come back in May and chuckle heartily at all of this, by the way. The point is that a league scarred by greed and inequality, by the same ruthless capitalistic impulses that have laid so much of our society to waste, should feel staid and predictable. That it does not is perhaps a testament to the Premier League\u2019s enduring instinct for self-preservation, a league that for all its bloated grotesqueness will somehow find a way never to be boring. The floodlights are primed. The gantries have been measured out. The kit suppliers have been notified. Let chaos reign."

                    "body": "Harry Kane was the first England player to congratulate Wayne Rooney. It was September 2015, Rooney had just scored his 50th international goal to break Sir Bobby Charlton\u2019s record for the country \u2013 from the penalty spot against Switzerland at Wembley \u2013 and Kane was straight over to him, whispering something in his ear before embracing him. Back then, Kane was at the start. Aged 22, he had come on as a 58th- minute substitute for his fourth cap and he would open the scoring shortly afterwards with his third goal at this level. Rooney\u2019s late penalty would close out a 2-0 European Championship qualifying victory.  What Kane remembers is how the emotion gripped Rooney. \u201cI saw how much it meant to him and his family,\u201d he says. And it is also probably fair to say that the half-century must have felt like a dot on the horizon for Kane, even if he has always set ambitious personal targets. It is now upon him and Rooney\u2019s record of 53 is not much further away, too. Kane goes into Saturday\u2019s Nations League opener against Hungary in Budapest on 49 goals and the opportunity is tantalising, especially with three more ties in the competition to follow over the next week-and-a-half \u2013 against Germany in Munich and Italy and Hungary in Wolverhampton. Rooney has said that it would be better if Kane were to break the record before the World Cup in Qatar, which kicks off on 21 November, to remove a potential distraction. England have two more games before it \u2013 the return Nations League fixtures against Italy and Germany on 23 and 26 September. Kane, in his own words, would \u201clike to break it as soon as possible,\u201d although he is \u201csomeone who doesn\u2019t let that stuff affect me when I\u2019m on the pitch,\u201d when it is all about helping the team to win. But the broader impression that Kane gave on Friday was of the time going so fast, from Rooney\u2019s record-breaking goal to his own shot at it. \u201cIt all goes so quickly,\u201d Kane says. \u201cThe major tournaments come around so quickly, the games come quickly and, year-by-year, you edge up that leaderboard \u2026 it\u2019s great to be close to 50.\u201d  The World Cup will be here before we know it and, for Kane and the England manager, Gareth Southgate, it is about wringing every last drop out of the time they have together, which is not much or, at least, nowhere near as much as they would like. The Nations League group phase, consequently, assumes far greater significance than it might ordinarily do. It is not so much a tune-up for Qatar. It is the only tune-up. \u201cWe don\u2019t have many days on the training pitch between now and our first match in the finals so everything we do has to be focused,\u201d Southgate says. \u201cThese Nations League matches are great preparation in that they are high-level games. They are different sorts of tests and we need to see some different players, as well. We need to learn about one or two things. But we need to keep winning football matches because it\u2019s an important habit to have. We also want to make the last four of this competition if we can.\u201d England have recent history with Hungary and it has been acrimonious. The 4-0 World Cup qualifying win in Budapest last September was marred by some home fans directing monkey chants at the England players, Raheem Sterling and Jude Bellingham, while the 1-1 draw at Wembley in the same competition the following month saw crowd trouble in the visiting enclosure. It was sparked when Metropolitan police officers entered the stand to arrest a supporter for a \u201cracially aggravated public order offence following comments made towards a steward\u201d.  In football terms, Southgate notes how the Budapest game was \u201cvery different to anything I\u2019ve seen from Hungary in the last two or three years\u201d because they were so open. The tighter organisation at Wembley was more characteristic and England have to expect something similar on Saturday. That was the night when Southgate started with two attack-minded No 8s in a 4-3-3 system. It did not work. Kane enters in a good place. This time last year, he wanted to leave Tottenham but it does not feel as though we are in the same transfer saga territory with him. Kane finished the domestic season in excellent form, earning a PFA player of the year nomination; Spurs have qualified for the Champions League and the manager, Antonio Conte, is planning his future with the club. \u201cWhenever you finish strongly, there is always a freer mind going onto the international stage,\u201d Kane says. \u201cI feel confident, I feel free.\u201d Southgate adds: \u201cHarry seems very happy, his football is good. Spurs have qualified for the Champions League so, when you\u2019re a player, you want to be involved in the biggest possible matches. Whenever a player is settled and happy, it makes a huge difference to the way they play.\u201d  Kane mentioned how the England rugby star, Marcus Smith, had watched the squad train at St George\u2019s Park and spent time with them. Kane is obsessed by taking tips from athletes in different fields and it is no secret that he has picked the brains of Tom Brady, the American football icon, among others. Kane loves Brady\u2019s sport and has said that he would one day like to become an NFL kicker while his passion for golf is also well-documented. \u201cI guess my ideal career would be [to win] a World Cup, a Super Bowl and maybe a Masters green jacket,\u201d Kane says, with a smile. It is the first item on the bucket list that consumes him. The upcoming four matches stand to be instructive."

                    "body": "Dani Alves has lived many different moments. As he prepares to play in a third World Cup, the full-back is disappointed with world events and social problems. The hope for a better society in the face of Covid-19 has become frustrating, with an increase of attitudes he considers unacceptable. \u201cPeople have lost the fear of the death and the respect also,\u201d he says. \u201cNothing has changed, unfortunately \u2026 I wish it had changed a lot of things, but it didn\u2019t. We are coming out of the pandemic and everyone thought things were going to change, but what happened was a war.  \u201cPeople have not changed, they continue to fight for power and the disrespect has increased. Whoever did stupidity in life and on the internet does even more because it gives audience.\u201d   Alves has also noticed a rise in racist crimes. During his career, he has been a victim. The most famous case happened in 2014, when he was at Barcelona. In a game against Villarreal, a banana was thrown on the pitch. Unceremoniously, Alves picked up the fruit and ate it. Racism was never a taboo topic for him. Indeed, it was the 39-year-old who introduced it in this interview. He did so in reaction to Nelson Piquet\u2019s racist slur of Lewis Hamilton. \u201cIt bothered me,\u201d he says \u201cBut not just for the fact itself. I won\u2019t delve too deeply into this because pushing [a] drunk downhill is easy. It\u2019s not just because of [Piquet\u2019s] statement. It\u2019s for everything that\u2019s happening. What happened is the extreme. If the biggest winner in Formula One is attacked, despised, excluded, imagine who is down there in the society? \u201cI pray and ask forgiveness for these people. My concern is with them because they are always being prevented from being someone, from having opportunities. Opportunity is not for everyone.\u201d Alves sent support to Hamilton after he spoke out against Piquet. \u201cIt was a message for him to keep going with his goal, which is very big,\u201d Alves says. \u201cHe\u2019s a guy who can transform lives and needs to keep fighting. We have a mission and no one will shake us.\u201d Returning to matters on the pitch, Alves finds himself as a free agent after a brief, second spell at Barcelona. It was a happy if ultimately frustrating time and Alves\u2019s desire is to find a new club so he is ready and able to feature for his country in Qatar. \u201cI didn\u2019t leave sad,\u201d Alves says of his six months at the Camp Nou, which followed a turbulent stint at S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cI left happy to have returned to Barcelona. I dreamed for five years wanting to live this second moment. The only thing I didn\u2019t like was how my departure was handled.  \u201cSince I arrived, I made it very clear that I wasn\u2019t any more a 20-year-old guy and that I wanted things to be done head-on, without hiding things. But this club has sinned in recent years. Barcelona don\u2019t care about the people who made history for the club. As a cul\u00ea [Barcelona supporter], I would like Barcelona to do things differently. I\u2019m not talking about myself because my situation was another scenario. I am eternally grateful to Xavi and the president for bringing me back. \u201cI found a club full of young people with incredible ideas on the pitch,\u201d says Alves, who played 17 times for Barcelona in his second spell having featured 247 times during a trophy-laden eight-year first spell. \u201cBut it needs to improve the work outside the field. The mindset is totally opposite to what we built a few years ago. Everything that happens on the field is a reflection of what happens outside.   \u201cI\u2019m supporting for Barcelona to come back to the top, but it\u2019s super-complicated. Football is more balanced, it\u2019s a collective game. And that has been left out at the club.\u201d Since Alves left Barcelona last month, he has been linked with a number of clubs, including Real Valladolid, who are majority-owned by fellow Brazil legend Ronaldo. A deadline for finding a new club has not been set, but the criteria is clear. \u201cI like challenges and I adapt to any situation,\u201d Alves says. \u201cToday I am unemployed, but interesting things have come up. I\u2019m doing my study about places to go which have a good level of competitiveness.  \u201cThat\u2019s football. You have to get together with people who want the same goal, who want to compete, to win. I like to win. I want to go somewhere I can win.\u201d  Another club interested in signing Alves are Athletico Paranaense, coached by Luiz Felipe Scolari, whom the defender played under at the 2014 World Cup. If he does decide to go there, he will be returning to a country where violence against footballers is on the rise. Since the beginning of the year, players from Bahia, Fortaleza, Gr\u00eamio and Paran\u00e1 have been beaten by fans. During a game in January, a man with a knife entered the pitch to threaten someone in an Under-20s match. \u201cWe need to improve Brazilian football, we need to fight against the violence in stadiums. It\u2019s shameful what has happened in the games,\u201d Alves says. \u201cPeople have children, they want to see something they can admire. If not, it becomes frustration, trauma.  \u201cWe can\u2019t sit on top of the story because then no chapter is written. That\u2019s what I tried to do, but I was crucified [in S\u00e3o Paulo]. I don\u2019t rule out any situation, but if I go back to Brazil, it will be to Athletico Paranaense.\u201d  Having turned 39 in May it is perhaps inevitable Alves\u2019s age is mentioned whenever the prospect of him extending his career is discussed. He acknowledges it is an issue but believes he remains capable of performing at the highest level. \u201cI know that everyone is talking about my age, that I am old, that 20 years ago everyone wanted me and today not. But I completely disagree because I have an experience today that I didn\u2019t have 20 years ago. When there\u2019s a big game, 20 year olds get nervous and worried, but I don\u2019t. \u201cAge has its pros and cons. There are many things you do when you\u2019re 20, but you don\u2019t do it when you\u2019re older. Maturity comes from just living. I also have the experience of having lived almost everything in the sport\u201d. Alves is one of the leaders in Brazil\u2019s squad and was present throughout their World Cup cycle. Even so, he knows that he needs to perform at a high level to secure a call-up for the World Cup squad by Tite. Their longstanding and trusting relationship is a guarantee of nothing.  \u201cNobody plays because he is a friend of the coach. In the end, it\u2019s his job that\u2019s at risk,\u201d says Alves. \u201cHe will not expose himself. He\u2019s not stupid. He needs players who will match what he needs. Tite and I have many years of work together. It is a relationship that one trusts and requires high performance from the other. He is very picky. \u201cHow does someone leave the farm to become the biggest winner in football history? It\u2019s work. I don\u2019t have the natural gift of [Lionel] Messi, Neymar, Ronaldinho, Ronaldo, Romario. I know I have to work a lot to get what I want. I have my talent, but I also work hard and I have discipline.\u201d Having featured for Brazil on 125 occasions including at the 2010 and 2014 World Cups, Alves is well played to judge their prospects in Qatar. He is adamant they have a strong chance of winning the World Cup for the first time in 20 years and goes so far as to say the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o are \u201cundoubtedly favourites. But a favourite with respect to opponents because we have lived many different moments in these competitions   \u201cWe\u2019ve already been tested a lot. We had a great learning experience. Now is the time to reap good fruits. We are on the right path and we have to assert the right to be favourites.\u201d If Alves does feature at the World Cup, will that be the moment he picks to retire? \u201cThe last dance is when you\u2019re going to retire, but I think I\u2019ll keep dancing. A dance is always welcome, regardless of the place and which dance. I do not think like that. And the last dance has already been done. It\u2019s better to create a new chapter, a new series. It\u2019s another chapter of my life.\u201d"

                    "body": "A smile plays upon the edges of Josh Hazlewood\u2019s mouth. This, to be clear, is not a fleeting reaction to some momentary amusement, but a more or less permanent feature. Over the course of a couple of conversations, one in Canberra and the other a few days later in Brisbane, it is almost always there \u2013 the smile of a man who seems to have cracked the T20 code. Hazlewood\u2019s rise in this format has been very recent and bewilderingly rapid. For most of the 31-year-old\u2019s career he was assumed to be terrible at it, and having made his T20 international debut in 2013 he played nine games for his country over the next eight years. \u201cI just didn\u2019t play it, to be honest,\u201d he says. Before the first game of Australia\u2019s T20 World Cup defence, against New Zealand on Saturday, the total number of T20s he has played for his country and various franchise teams stands at 89 \u2013 fewer than Harry Brook, the 23-year-old who has only recently broken into the England side, and less than half the total of Afghanistan\u2019s Mujeeb Ur Rahman, 10 years his junior.  Everything changed in June 2021, when a number of players including the seamers Pat Cummins, Daniel Sams and Jhye Richardson, tired of life inside biosecure bubbles, chose not to take part in Australia\u2019s white-ball tour of West Indies, and Hazlewood stepped in. At that stage he had played 10 T20 matches in the previous five years. Five months later he had won the game\u2019s two biggest prizes, the IPL and the T20 World Cup, and a year later he was officially named the world\u2019s No 1 T20i bowler. His ascent is more remarkable because in a world of rapidly changing time signatures, Hazlewood is a metronome, known most of all for repeatedly landing the ball on an ideal line and length. \u201cI\u2019ve got some changes but not big ones, I don\u2019t think,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m always working on trying to get better ones. You often find guys with strange actions or very fast arms have good changes of pace because they can deceive you, but for a rhythmical bowler like myself changes of pace are going to be hard. It\u2019s just subtle changes here and there.\u201d Throughout those years when the game seemed to have left him behind he never lost faith that he could flourish in the format, but neither did he devote much time to trying to make it happen. \u201cI always thought that if I got a good run at it I could learn on the go and be effective,\u201d he says. \u201cI think if I played a lot of games in a row and wasn\u2019t effective then that\u2019s probably when you\u2019d [think] maybe the format\u2019s gone.\u201d One thing that makes his explosive return to T20s all the more remarkable is that during his time in the wilderness he not only did not train specifically for it, he did not even watch the shorter-form games. \u201cI don\u2019t watch much cricket in general, to be honest,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we\u2019re coming up against Sri Lanka down the track I might watch a little bit of their games but usually there\u2019s enough footage to watch in bowling meetings. So yeah, I hardly watch any cricket.\u201d  Would he say, then, that he genuinely likes cricket? \u201cI like playing it,\u201d he says. \u201cIf there\u2019s a huge game I might switch it on, or if I know someone well who\u2019s playing I might give it a watch, but otherwise I\u2019ll more watch footy, rugby league. I like watching golf. I\u2019ll watch a bit of that.\u201d Once he retires, he says he is likely to leave the sport entirely unless a \u201cvery part-time\u201d opportunity takes his fancy. In many ways Australia\u2019s journey at the last T20 World Cup was similar to Hazlewood\u2019s, only his took the best part of a decade and his team\u2019s was condensed into a few weeks: initially much fancied, then completely written off, and then, unexpectedly, all-conquering. \u201cI guess you can say that,\u201d he says. \u201cYou probably get caught up in the team environment, and the team\u2019s doing all these things and you forget that your role\u2019s actually growing and getting better. The same at Chennai [where he won the IPL] \u2013 I felt like I just jumped in halfway through the tournament, jumped on the back of what they were doing, and just played my part. You just get caught up in the team aspect.\u201d Covid perhaps helped with that: being trapped together in bubbles might be boring, but it also helps to forge strong bonds. \u201cThat added to our team last year, the success and dynamic, and it\u2019s not going to be the same atmosphere here,\u201d Hazlewood says. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to recreate that bubble where we can\u2019t go anywhere, we can\u2019t do anything, we\u2019ve got no families. It was very much a team thing last year \u2013 we played a lot of golf, we had a good time and we were always together. We\u2019re still trying to recreate that same atmosphere \u2013 it\u2019s still very much fresh in the minds of everyone, and it\u2019s still the nucleus of that team.\u201d Much of this nucleus is also involved in the Test side, and once the World Cup is over they will start to turn their attention to next summer\u2019s Ashes series. Hazlewood says he is \u201creally keen\u201d, having missed most of Australia\u2019s thrashing of England last time out after picking up a side strain in the opening game \u2013 \u201cI didn\u2019t see the rest of the series, I just switched off and spent some time with the family\u201d \u2013 and is intrigued to see how England\u2019s have changed under Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum. \u201cOh, I\u2019ve heard about it,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t seen any of it, really.\u201d"

                    "body": "In sacking Eddie Jones as head coach nine months out from the World Cup, English rugby may have gift-wrapped an early Christmas present for the woebegone Wallabies in 2023. The fiercely Australian Jones is suddenly a free agent with an axe to grind and a World Cup plan. That makes him a very dangerous adversary to his old masters, and a huge \u2013 if slightly volatile \u2013 weapon of mass destruction should the men in gold snap him up as a gun-for-hire.\nRugby Australia has backed its coach, Dave Rennie, through to the 2023 World Cup in France. It has committed to his vision, acknowledged his popularity among the players and backed him to deliver when it matters most. To do so when Rennie has a 37% win record (lowest of any Australian coach in the professional era) and when the team has had its worst season of his three in charge, speaks of RA\u2019s admirable loyalty, bold vision or foolhardiness.\n\nYet few would dispute that after finishing the international season with only five victories (none of them back-to-back) from 14 Tests, Australian rugby needs more if it is truly to challenge for the William Webb Ellis trophy in September. Is \u201cFast Eddie\u201d \u2013 the mastermind who has defeated Australia in 10 of his last 11 outings \u2013 the turbo boost the Wallabies crave?\nThose who remember Jones\u2019s combustive reign as Australia\u2019s coach two decades back would warn against letting the fox back in the henhouse. Appointed in 2001, Jones won the Tri Nations that year then upset the All Blacks in the semi-final before losing to England after Jonny Wilkinson\u2019s field goal in the World Cup final two years later. Although contracted until 2007, seven straight losses in 2005 spelled his end. From 57 Tests Jones won 33 \u2013 a 58% win-record.\nBut there\u2019s the rub. That record rises to 82% at the four World Cups Jones has contested. After the heartbreaker in 2003, Jones was South Africa\u2019s key technical adviser for their 2007 title. In 2015, as Japan\u2019s coach, he delivered the tournament\u2019s biggest upset, when the Brave Blossoms shocked the Springboks. And in 2019, Jones took England to the final again.\nWeirdly, this single-minded focus on World Cup success is why England have axed him. A restless English rugby public booed him from the field last week, tired of uninspiring recent performances shrugged off by Jones as minor setbacks as he experimented with 112 players and more than 80 coaching staff over a seven-year reign in the quest for world domination in 2023.\n\nAdmittedly, despite a 73% record (the greatest of all England\u2019s coaches) and his equalling of New Zealand\u2019s all-time record of 18 consecutive wins in 2017, Jones\u2019s former lustre was lacking this season, when he won five Tests (two of them over Australia in July) and lost six. So the triggermen at Twickenham did what former Wallaby Matt Giteau said was \u201cthe silliest thing they could do to the English rugby team. [Jones] plans and plans and plans in advance for\u2026 the one competition he has got consistently right time and time again. Big mistake.\u201d\n\nAnd big opportunity for Australia? In July, the rugby rumour mill ran hot and heavy with tales of Jones being lined up to return home in 2024 in a director of rugby role. If true, the plan can now be expedited to leave Rennie with the reins as promised, but with Jones\u2019s strategic brain and insider-savvy part of the Wallabies camp in the lead-up to Paris 2023.\nIf it works there, it sets up Australian rugby for a blockbuster tour by the British and Irish Lions in 2025 before Jones and a new coach \u2013 possibly the Brumbies\u2019 Stephen Larkham or the Force\u2019s Simon Cron \u2013 reboot Wallabies culture so Australia\u2019s current crop of young guns win the 2027 World Cup in Australia.\nThe stars are aligning. But if Australia want Jones a year early, they would need to act quickly. There is movement \u2013 some might say panic \u2013 as rugby\u2019s four-year cycle nears its climax. A day before Jones was jettisoned, Wales harpooned Wayne Pivac and installed Warren Gatland who left New Zealand urging Scott Robertson to replace Ian Foster in 2024.\nBut Jones is a maverick. At 62, he may chase a left-field bucket-list item: rugby league. Jones segued from his triumphant tour of Australia this year straight into an NRL camp with the Melbourne Storm, and he mentored new Sea Eagles coach Anthony Seibold at England. After all, Michael Cheika recently proved it is possible to coach Lebanon at the Rugby League World Cup then lead Argentina to victory over the All Blacks in the same weekend.\nEven that love of league elevates his value to rugby. In 2001, Jones was at a Sea Eagles trial when he recruited George Smith and turned him into the Wallabies greatest flanker. Forgiven for past ills and feted for his growth since, then given a role as overseer not coach \u2013 Jones\u2019s intensity as a leader is said to border on megalomania \u2013 he might make a difference. The Wallabies need a wildcard to win big in 2023. Jones might just be their joker in the pack."

                    "body": "\u2018The sun will come up tomorrow,\u201d Lionel Scaloni says. The Argentina manager is talking about the \u201cterrible burden of responsibility\u201d he carried as a player, the weight he tries to free his footballers from now, when a moment comes to his mind. It happened in 2006, and you may remember it. He certainly does, the regret remaining even though it might have been the best mistake he ever made. Not destiny exactly and he couldn\u2019t have known it then, but one of those events that somehow shape things, the ball as butterfly effect.\nSeconds remained in the FA Cup final with West Ham on the verge of winning their first trophy in 26 years, only the fourth in their history, when it fell to Steven Gerrard and, Scaloni says, \u201cthe world came crashing down on me\u201d. Liverpool\u2019s captain hit an absurd shot and everything shifted. \u201cI lost an FA Cup, it was partly my fault because I didn\u2019t clear well, and life changed,\u201d he recalls. \u201cWest Ham don\u2019t want to sign me, I return to Spain. I wouldn\u2019t have met my wife or had my kids.\u201d\nThere might have been none of this, either: Argentina\u2019s first title in 29 years, Lionel Messi finally lifting an international trophy, a 36-game unbeaten run, the longest in their history and one off a world record, and the hope of something greater. If that\u2019s unexpected, and Scaloni admits \u201csomething strange happened with us\u201d, all of it is. Including him: an unlikely hero and an unpretentious one. The man who took charge after failure and skilfully forged a group now among the World Cup favourites, a process he outlines with a clarity and normality which helps explain how he succeeded.\n\nHe might not have carried on at all. \u201cThat night, after the FA Cup final, it was like I didn\u2019t want to play football any more,\u201d Scaloni says. Struggling physically and thus mentally too, he says \u201cat 29, 30, it was half-over\u201d. Those were \u201creally screwed-up\u201d years but he went on: Racing Santander, Lazio, Mallorca, Atalanta. \u201cAs a player I felt more blame than as coach, which is mad because the coach is the one paying for defeat,\u201d he says.\nHe played the 2006 World Cup \u201cpractically on one leg\u201d, describes the suffering in his one appearance against Mexico, his last cap, remembers his thigh muscle completely detaching, admiringly recalls the surgeon who could only use one arm, and winces at the injury recurring two years later, getting on a train from Rome to Bergamo having signed for Atalanta. \u201cIncredible, all in the head. That burden again, that weight on your conscience. \u2018What do I tell these people?\u2019 We play Palermo four days later. At 2-0 up I say: \u2018Mister, I have a yellow: take me off\u2019. I didn\u2019t say: \u2018I\u2019m broken.\u2019 I couldn\u2019t.\u201d\nAll that accelerated a process that was already there, a transition towards who he always was, Scaloni believes. Somewhere he has the notes scribbled down over the years. \u201cI fed on football,\u201d he says. \u201cI could watch football 24 hours. I was always close to the coach, discussing what worked. That \u2018bug\u2019 always bit me. Even as a kid, the best in my age group, I was never an egotist, always pulled the group together. But injury quickened that. I can\u2019t play every game and think: \u2018I have to do something.\u2019\n\n\u201cSomething clicked in Italy. I went at 30 thinking I knew everything and found so much to learn. I did my first badge in 2011 despite not retiring until 2015. I would train at Formello, Lazio\u2019s place, then cross to Trigoria, Roma\u2019s place, for the coaching course.\u201d\nScaloni was an analyst for Jorge Sampaoli at Sevilla then Argentina but had no head coach experience, only seven caps, and his appointment after Russia 2018 surprised. Diego Maradona even asked whether they were \u201cmad\u201d. Initially it was temporary yet as it turned out, of the past 12 coaching spells only one lasted as long and none achieved anything like this, doubts blown away \u2013 even if Scaloni insists he never felt imposter syndrome or any need to prove himself.\n\u201cWe came for six games \u2013 actually two initially, Guatemala and Colombia. We were with the Under-20s when they called, in the hotel gym in Valencia with Pablo Aimar. I said: \u2018I\u2019m diving straight in; you with me?\u2019 He didn\u2019t hesitate. Some would think: \u2018Madness of youth.\u2019 Others: \u2018You were brave.\u2019 I didn\u2019t think at all. We were walking along the beach drawing up the senior squad, taking the Under-20s the next day. All very mad. But the emotion, the excitement was enormous.\n\u201cWhen we played Uruguay, Maestro [\u00d3scar] Tab\u00e1rez pulled me aside: \u2018Tell those who say you have no experience you had a lifetime of them in 20 years playing.\u2019 I said thanks but didn\u2019t really stop to think about that until later. Playing doesn\u2019t give you the right to coach but it does help you manage certain moments, understand.\u201d\nScaloni built an illustrious staff. Aimar \u2013 \u201cworth his weight in gold; he\u2019s calm while maybe I\u2019m a bit impulsive\u201d; boyhood friend Walter Samuel, whose parents used to pick him up en route to training; and Roberto Ayala, who \u201calways has the right words.\u201d\nTogether, they built a team Scaloni positions on both sides of Argentina\u2019s football divide: C\u00e9sar Menotti\u2019s love of the ball, Carlos Bilardo\u2019s fight. Scaloni talks gratefully of the \u201c70, 80, maybe 90\u201d players used as it all unfolded and outlines an evolution in style from something more direct to a team of \u201cgood feet\u201d, explaining how Rodrigo De Paul and Leandro Paredes adapted. \u201cIf you insist on dying with your original idea, it won\u2019t end well,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cBut the most important thing is the head. They\u2019re all good players so if they\u2019re in a good place mentally, if you can remove any fears; that\u2019s important. We came from two Copa Am\u00e9rica finals lost, a World Cup final lost. The feeling was, \u2018We\u2019re never going to win anything\u2019, \u2018We won\u2019t win, won\u2019t win, won\u2019t win\u2019. We told them that win or lose, the sun rises.\u201d\nHe knew; that FA Cup still hurt. \u201cSorry, psychologists, but we do it ourselves. We talk to players about our experiences. We listen to them too. I read an Ancelotti interview about his players suggesting something different. He won it all and could have said: \u2018No, we do what I say.\u2019 But he listens. Playing an uncomfortable player is worse than him telling you he\u2019s uncomfortable. You need players with you. You decide but it\u2019s good to listen. I believe in that, always have. Fundamental. A footballer turns his back and \u2026 That was always true but now more than ever they\u2019re the key to everything.\u201d\nThat comes naturally to Scaloni, a product perhaps of his upbringing in Pujato, where his parents still live. Chacarero, they call it; a farmer\u2019s lifestyle. \u201cIt\u2019s a typical Argentinian small town: people work the land, look after animals, a very monotonous life,\u201d he says. \u201cWake at 6am, go round the fields, check the cows are OK, there\u2019s no bugs on the crops, in the sunflower, the wheat, go home, eat, siesta, go back, do it again. Maybe that\u2019s there in how you relate to people: simple, nothing odd, telling it how it is. A right-back is a right-back not a withdrawn four.\u201d\nScaloni\u2019s team were relatable, a \u201cnational team belonging to everyone\u201d, he says. \u201cWe did two games, then Germany, then Ecuador, then two with Mexico. Things went well. It\u2019s also true that there wasn\u2019t time for them to find a replacement \u2013 that\u2019s a reality. So we continued until December: \u2018OK, keep going.\u2019 Results were good but it was more the air we breathed, something fresh, people coming together.\u201d\nAnd then came Lionel Messi. \u201cHe joined after six games. We did a video call with him and Aimar when we took over , explaining our plans, telling him the doors were open. We said: \u2018We know maybe it\u2019s better for you not to come yet.\u2019 He was happy, especially because of Pablo, who\u2019s his idol. He said: \u2018When you want me, I\u2019ll be there.\u2019 We needed the group to be strong first. It\u2019s not the same for a young lad to come and suddenly be sent to train with Leo. It\u2019s difficult to explain what he generates in a group, just being there.\u201d\nHave you seen that before? \u201cNo, not even close,\u201d Scaloni says. \u201cI\u2019ve played against the best, but like that, no. What he generates in teammates and opponents is beyond the normal. After six, seven, eight games, the group\u2019s forming. Otamendi, Di Mar\u00eda, who he already knew. De Paul joins, Lo Celso, Papu [G\u00f3mez], people who manage a group. When Leo joined, it was natural. And kids are more open now. At 18, I got called up. There was Crespo and all those and I was like \u2026\u201d\nScaloni feigns a terrified face. \u201cAnd I liked to talk, eh! You kept a distance. Those were imposing guys. But now kids approach more easily. Leo approaches them too. There\u2019s a legacy: his words stay with them. It was natural. Form the group, then he came. It worked. He\u2019s the most down to earth of all.\u201d\nIn what way? \u201cIn everything. If I walk down the road, I might get asked for an autograph: one, two, five \u2026 by the fifth, I\u2019m not saying no, but.\u201d Scaloni grimaces. \u201cThat\u2019s once in a while. He\u2019s every single day, every single holy day. It\u2019s not fair that he can\u2019t have a life like all of us. He goes into a dining room, everyone\u2019s watching: cook, kit man, everyone. And that\u2019s people who know him; imagine people who don\u2019t \u2013 365 days, 24 hours. He understands that. How many times did he raise his voice publicly in 20 years? I admire him, love him loads, it\u2019s incredible how he handles that.\n\u201cBy the time he came for the Venezuela game, we knew what we wanted. And when we signed permanently, we entered another phase. We didn\u2019t win the 2019 Copa Am\u00e9rica but played well. In Argentina respecting a process is hard and we started as interims, without unconditional support, but something strange happened: we started to get that trust, through results, how we worked. People breathe football 24 hours and this team reached them; they identified with how we are. We found that chemistry between fans, directivos, players. That was key to continuing four years.\n\u201cIn Brazil we lost [the 2019 Copa Am\u00e9rica semi-final]. Messi spoke out because he had to. People think Leo doesn\u2019t speak but he\u2019s a true Argentinian, it\u2019s in his blood, the most pissed-off at losing. That day there were many reasons to be angry. People identified, appreciated we played well. At a different stage they could\u2019ve said, \u2018They lost, get rid of them all\u2019, \u2018The coach has to go\u2019, but there was a connection.\u201d\nArgentina have not lost since. Defeat is never permanent, Scaloni says \u2013 nor, he adds, is victory \u2013 and two years later Argentina returned to win the Copa Am\u00e9rica at the Maracan\u00e3. At full time, the players dashed to Messi, slipping to his knees, sobbing. \u201cHalf the world would have run to hug him,\u201d Scaloni says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s spontaneous. The country needed that happiness \u2013 it had been a long time. Seeing Leo win pleased everyone, as much even as the selecci\u00f3n. When Messi represents what he does for people, for teammates, knowing he had been denied for so long, that\u2019s natural. That generation reached three finals, as if that was easy! People appreciate that now. But the Copa Am\u00e9rica removed a thorn from his side.\u201d\nThe celebrations, the release was wild. \u201cThere was a fervour beyond the normal, too much,\u201d Scaloni admits. \u201cIf you think you\u2019re more than you are, you\u2019re dead. Someone said: \u2018You\u2019re bigger than the president now.\u2019 I said: \u2018Nah, you\u2019re wrong.\u2019 Maybe this helps people but I\u2019m just a football coach. If we win the Copa Am\u00e9rica and I say, \u2018Now we\u2019ll win the World Cup\u2019, no. We walk the same line, win or lose. Maybe people aren\u2019t used to this, maybe they say: \u2018This guy\u2019s mad.\u2019 I\u2019m normal; look at the people with me: we\u2019re all like that.\u201d\n\u201cWe tell them they\u2019re footballers, that\u2019s all. Our word\u2019s no more worthy than anyone\u2019s. Winning doesn\u2019t mean do whatever you want. It\u2019s dangerous in Argentina to believe you\u2019re bigger than you are. That\u2019s not me trying to burst the bubble; it\u2019s telling it how it is. We\u2019re not invincible. Records are there to be broken. We\u2019re playing well, won the Copa Am\u00e9rica but we can have a good tournament or a bad one.\n\u201cThe World Cup is treacherous, the best team often doesn\u2019t win. What matters is knowing what you want: that\u2019s the path we\u2019ve travelled these four years. After the final game before Qatar, which closed this cycle, the coaching staff talked. We compared that last game to our first and the feeling is the same.\u201d\nHe stops, pulls a face. \u201cWhen you play for Argentina, that grrr, those nerves, that adrenaline, is always there,\u201d he says. \u201cThat never changes, whether it\u2019s Guatemala or the World Cup.\u201d"

                    "body": "Gareth Southgate has warned his players and their families not to get involved in fly-on-the-wall documentaries around the World Cup after several of the squad\u2019s partners were approached by a production company.\nThe proposed series would follow the England footballers\u2019 loved ones before and during the tournament in Qatar and is intended to be screened on Netflix. Southgate made it clear he would regard any such commitment as a distraction and that he does not want to disrupt the family ecosystem developed during his tenure.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my cup of tea really,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d be surprised if the group of players we\u2019ve got would have an interest in that, because they\u2019ve wanted to focus on football. The focus in Russia and last summer was all about the players and everything they do. We\u2019ve never had any issues.\u201d\n\nEngland\u2019s campaign at Germany 2006 under Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson was famously contested amid intense focus on the players\u2019 entourages, which contributed to a much stricter stance from Fabio Capello regarding their presence around the camp four years later. Southgate has struck a balance he and the squad are happy with and elaborated on it when the prospect of a documentary was put to him. He also expressed his distaste for a term that has accompanied much coverage of the players\u2019 spouses and partners over the past decade and a half.\n\u201cWe like to involve the families,\u201d he said. \u201cI actually think the term \u2018Wags\u2019 is quite disrespectful, it\u2019s their partners and family; I don\u2019t like the term. We want them to feel welcome and we invited them into the hotel when we could in Russia: mums, dads and kids.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great feeling when you\u2019ve the kids in, especially. It changes the dynamic of the hotel. We couldn\u2019t do that last year [at Euro 2020] because of Covid. It\u2019s one big family and I think everyone recognises that part of what we do has been very good over the last couple of years.\u201d\nThere has been no indication regarding the series\u2019 chances of getting off the ground and Southgate\u2019s intervention may in effect nip it in the bud. His captain, Harry Kane, took the same view.\n\u201cI think Gareth hit the nail on the head,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve created this really good environment where friends and family, girlfriends and wives have been part of the team and the group, especially when we\u2019ve been away.\n\u201cLast summer was a bit different obviously, but I\u2019ve not been contacted about my wife [being involved] and she hasn\u2019t, so I\u2019m not too sure whose has. We want to focus on the World Cup and we don\u2019t want any distraction from that.\u201d"

                    "body": "A Helena Rowland hat-trick helped England to a 73-7 win over Wales at Ashton Gate, which means the Red Roses will head to the World Cup on a winning run of 25 consecutive matches. They are the first international rugby team to win 25 in a row \u2013 the perfect springboard from which to launch their campaign on 8 October against Fiji. A key moment in the match came around the 70-minute mark when the Red Roses went down to 14 players. Player of the match Rowland was taken off in what was described as a precautionary measure and she could not be replaced as England had already emptied their bench. \u201cShe started to cramp,\u201d said the England head coach, Simon Middleton. \u201cThe last thing we want is for the cramp to turn into a tear. Medical were concerned.  \u201cYes it gives you a chance to look at a 14-player scenario and get Holly [Aitchison] some time. We wanted to look at Holly at 13 and what we didn\u2019t want to do was disrespect Wales in any way. We would never do that. I would rather have that finger pointed at me than leave my 12 on the field and the cramp turns into a tear. We were never going to take a chance on that.\u201d  After a minute\u2019s silence for Queen Elizabeth II the match got under way. England had good early possession but the lineout was sloppy five metres out, which gave Wales a foothold. The visitors won another penalty and fly-half Elinor Snowsill showed their intent with a kick to the corner. However, the tides quickly turned with England gathering the ball from the Wales lineout and running it upfield. In the 22 Rowland ran a beautiful line to bypass two defenders and crash over. That had the 11,961 crowd on their feet. Rowland had a try ruled out due to obstruction a few minutes later after a TMO check. Wales were the next to strike with a driving maul allowing Gwen Crabb reap the rewards, Snowsill added the extras to level the game after 15 minutes. England hit back quickly with Lydia Thompson working a play straight off the training pitch to rip open the defence, eventually winning a penalty.  The ball was whipped out from the maul to Emily Scarratt, who leaped to England\u2019s second try. The hosts\u2019 driving maul came into play next but Alex Callender brought it down illegally and was sent to the sin bin. The hosts took full advantage of being a player up with Marlie Packer crashing over off the back of a maul. England\u2019s fourth came through a penalty try. There was a worry for the team shortly before as Lark Davies was replaced by Amy Cokayne and Middleton did not have a conclusive answer on Davies\u2019s injury. Ellie Kildunne wrapped up the first half with the Red Roses\u2019 fifth as England outnumbered Wales on the wing. The Red Roses continued their scoring ways immediately after the break with Cokayne going over from a driving maul and the replacement hooker was instrumental in their next try, running a great line to feed Rowland, who sprinted over. Scarratt lodged her complaints after her conversion was charged down by Callender but the referee, Aur\u00e9lie Groizeleau, was happy. England kept hammering the Welsh line and found another score through Scarratt. A slick team try followed with replacements Claudia MacDonald, Aitchison and Hannah Botterman putting it through the hands to put Rowland through for her hat-trick.  Botterman and Zoe Aldcroft finished off an impressive display with their fire firmly lit to win back the trophy they have not had their hands on since 2014. Wales, too, will be on a plane to New Zealand for the World Cup and their captain, Hannah Jones, said: \u201cWe have a bit of time now to hurt, to reflect. We have got to pick ourselves up, there is a quick turnaround.\u201d"

                    "body": "Some lessons, it seems, are never learned. Gareth Southgate was characteristically measured in his response to Friday\u2019s World Cup draw but most seemed to follow Kyle Walker\u2019s line that \u201cyou\u2019ve got to be happy with the teams we\u2019ve drawn\u201d.\nThe triumphalism was not quite as strident as before the 2010 World Cup, but if other teams really are inspired by the misunderstood ironies of Three Lions, England\u2019s group-stage opponents are going to be raging at some of Saturday morning\u2019s headlines.\nQuite apart from the dangers of jingoistic complacency, this is not an easy draw. \u201cSome of the ties are potentially trickier than just the rankings,\u201d said Southgate, but the rankings are tricky enough. By the Fifa rankings, this is the toughest group.\n\nIn part that is a consequence of the uncertainty over the final European team because of the postponements caused by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. That unknown side was classed as a Pot 4 team in the draw, but of the three sides involved only Scotland would be a Pot 4 team; Wales and Ukraine would have been in Pot 3.\nBut here we are \u2013 already \u2013 talking about the minutiae of football. This is what sportswashing does and why it is so insidious, infecting a thing we love so we end up ignoring the tawdry horror of the spectacle.\nEngland\u2019s first Group B game will be played in the Khalifa stadium, where the British construction worker Zac Cox fell to his death in 2017. His was one of three work-related deaths on World Cup-related construction sites acknowledged by the Qatari authorities, although Amnesty International doubts those figures.\n\nThere have been at least 6,500 deaths of migrant workers on infrastructure projects in Qatar. It turns out they have paid more than \u00a31bn for the privilege. When Malcolm Bidali, a Kenyan worker, highlighted concerns about working conditions, he was held in solitary confinement for a month before being allowed to leave Qatar two months later having paid a fine for spreading \u201cfalse news\u201d. Abdullah Ibhais is still in jail after defending migrant workers.\nThere was an emphasis around the draw on Qatar\u2019s culture of hospitality. Wealthy Europeans certainly seem to enjoy it. But LGBTQ+ pressure groups are still awaiting basic assurances. This week major general Abdulaziz Abdullah Al Ansari, chairman of the national counter-terrorism committee of Qatar, said rainbow flags may be confiscated to \u201cprotect\u201d the person carrying them.\nThat hardly raises confidence and seems in direct contravention of regulations 15 and 23 of Fifa\u2019s statutes, which stipulate the responsibility of members and confederations \u201cto prohibit all forms of discrimination\u201d. Regulation 4 makes clear that includes \u201cgender\u201d and \u201csexual orientation\u201d.\nIt has been striking how aggressive the Qatari tone has been over the past few days, with the secretary general of the supreme committee for delivery and legacy, Hassan al-Thawadi, telling the president of the Norwegian Football Federation, Lise Klaveness, to \u201ceducate\u201d herself after she suggested that \u201cthe migrant workers injured, the families of those that died, must be cared for\u201d.\n\nThat process of education may be easier if journalists \u2013 such as the Norwegian film crew arrested last November \u2013 were not subject to intimidation when they tried to report on such issues. If that is the approach when there has been time to prepare a PR strategy, you wonder what will happen come the chaos of the event.\nA Honduran delegate insisted this was not the time or the place for such discussions. But if not now, when? It is not those who point to the outrages who are tainting the World Cup. And if that means some awkward gear changes, that is the nature of this tournament.\nAnd so back to the group. As Southgate pointed out, that third game against the winners of Uefa Path A will be difficult whoever qualifies. It could be Ukraine who, carrying all the emotions of the war and fired by the sense of fighting for a cause, will be very different from the team England beat 4-0 at Euro 2020.\n\nOr it could be a British side. Even at Wembley last June, a derby against Scotland brought England\u2019s poorest performance on their run to the final.\nHistory offers no great reason for optimism against the USA either, with England failing to win their two previous meetings at World Cups. There was Rob Green\u2019s howler and the 1-1 draw in Rustenburg in 2010, the beginning of what, at least for four years, seemed a uniquely bleak campaign. Sixty years before that was the 1-0 defeat in Belo Horizonte. The USA then were a ragtag bunch of largely amateur players, few of whom would qualify under modern regulations on nationality. Now they have probably the most promising squad in their history, with players who are regulars at Chelsea, Juventus, Borussia Dortmund and Barcelona.\nEngland begin against Iran, a country they have never played. The UK imposed sanctions on Iran in 2007 and although the release of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori last month removes an immediate flashpoint, there will be inevitable political tension.\nIran are probably not the 21st best side in the world, even if that is what the Fifa rankings say. They have won two games at the World Cup, but one of them was against the USA in 1998. They are solid and well-organised, conceding four goals in 10 games in the third round of Asian qualifying.\nGroup of death? Well, in this World Cup they all are, and the metaphor should probably be retired on grounds of taste. Group of baffling complex politics? Well, in the modern age, obviously. The likelihood is that England will go through, that it will be a grind and there will be great outpourings of frustration on the way, talk of the need to unleash this great generation of attacking talent, based in part in the underestimation of England\u2019s opponents.\n\nNone of it will matter because World Cups are not won in the group stage, but in knockout games against the elite and none of it will matter because football should not be a propaganda tool and its great tournaments should not be made possible by exploited labour."

I always said that after Barcelona there will be no other club, and that is the way it is going to be.\u201d\n\nPiqu\u00e9 has played 615 games for Barcelona, scoring 52 goals.

He returned to Barcelona in 2008 under Pep Guardiola and immediately blossomed as a skilled defender thanks to his smarts, passing skills and leadership.\nHe quickly became one of the finest centre-backs in the world as part of a great Barcelona team, led by Lionel Messi,.\nPiqu\u00e9 stood out from other players for his interest in business ventures off the field. He successfully overhauled tennis\u2019s Davis Cup competition, while also getting into controversial deals with the Spanish federation involving its holding of the Spanish Super Cup competition in Saudi Arabia."

                    "body": "It\u2019s not what you\u2019d expect to see housed within the neoclassical architecture of Liverpool\u2019s Walker Art Gallery. Ascend its curving staircase, the walls of which are adorned with gold-framed works of art from across the centuries, and at the summit you will see \u2026 erm, a zip-up Fila tracksuit top paired with some Lee jeans circa 1983. This blue trackie sits alongside other prize pieces: Aquascutum scarves, Stone Island jackets, the odd hooded mannequin that looks like it might steal your dinner money. These treasures occupy the opening room of Art of the Terraces which, as you may have guessed, is not the Walker\u2019s usual fare. Timed for the World Cup, it\u2019s an exhibition that aims to tell the story of football casuals \u2013 the name given to a generation of fans who, inspired by the rival followers they encountered on European away days, ditched their flared cords and parkas and began dressing in the latest foreign labels.  Their influence on fashion helped turn athleisure wear into a gigantic global industry: before Liverpool and Manchester United fans started wearing Adidas Forest Hills trainers to games, trainers were only really seen on the track. But this is not simply an exhibition of retro sportswear. The casuals had a huge impact on arts and culture too, from former casuals-turned-artists such as Mark Leckey (whose 1999 video piece Fiorucci Made Me Hardcore mixes footage of Northern Soul dancers, football fans and ravers) to those who\u2019ve been inspired indirectly (Ross Muir\u2019s reimagining of Vincent van Gogh in Adidas three stripe). \u201cIt\u2019s not a story that\u2019s been told in galleries before,\u201d says Pauline Rushton, who led the project. \u201cThese people don\u2019t see themselves reflected in galleries and might find one like ours intimidating. We\u2019re hoping that it might attract them to visit us, and that they\u2019ll stick around and see what else we do.\u201d Art of the Terraces kicks off with a series of paintings that recall the highs of following the game \u2013 and the lows, as Glen Williams\u2019s Eight Bloody Nil attests. We see supporters in the rain, supporters cold and bored, and supporters throwing their hats in the air. What we don\u2019t see, hardly ever, are footballers \u2013 and in many ways this is what makes the show work so well. It\u2019s not a story of superstar signings but the grassroots support that really powers the game.  Peter O\u2019Toole and Adam Gill, directors of Huddersfield\u2019s Grammar Studio and two of the driving forces behind the exhibition, tell me that focusing solely on the fans was so important that they ended up turning down artworks from the likes of Keith Haring. \u201cJust casually tossing out Picassos,\u201d laughs O\u2019Toole, who seems especially wide-eyed that their idea to tell the casuals story using art has somehow snowballed into a prestigious show at the Walker. The show doesn\u2019t shy away from the uncomfortable elements of casuals culture. In one corner, a jet black predator-like figure looms. This is Penalty!, a 2006 sculpture made by Jamaican British artist Satch Hoyt from the leather tongues of Puma boots \u2013 so chosen because Puma was the brand worn by the African American athlete Tommie Smith. Alongside John Carlos, Smith gave the black power salute from the podium at the 1968 Mexico Olympics. Fifteen years after it was made, three of England\u2019s black players suffered a torrent of abuse after missing penalties during the European Championship final against Italy. In the exhibition\u2019s final room is a magnificent tapestry of the terraces called Who Are Ya\u2019? \u201cIt\u2019s not the usual thing you\u2019d expect to find in a gallery \u2013 a football hooligan tapestry,\u201d grins its Lancastrian maker, Jamie Holman. The piece aims to show the link between the 19th-century story of the Lancashire mills and the great-grandchildren of those weavers who helped form the Football League. It asks questions about working-class identity and so-called \u201cleft behind\u201d areas such as Blackburn where he works. \u201cThere are kids in Rome wearing Adidas Blackburn trainers,\u201d he points out. \u201cYou hear all this stuff about left behind places. Well, football is now a diverse, multicultural, global affair, but the roots start in these unexpected places where nothing is meant to be happening.\u201d  Holman acknowledges that football isn\u2019t always an easy fit in a gallery. \u201cDespite the changes to the game and global acceptance, football remains defiantly working-class, in the sense that it\u2019s difficult to unpick those real dark histories from the game. Using materials from the same spaces where it started allows me to talk about the male aggression and violence without over-fetishising those elements. Quite literally, it softens the image.\u201d Despite this, football and art are far from the unlikely bedfellows they seem. The game\u2019s presence in art can be traced back to at least the 16th century, when Pieter Bruegel the Elder let pig bladders be kicked around in his painting Children\u2019s Games. Since then artists have attempted to capture the unique atmosphere of match days (as in LS Lowry\u2019s Going to the Match, recently bought by Salford\u2019s Lowry arts centre for \u00a37.8m), honour its heroes (Andy Warhol\u2019s portrait of Pel\u00e9) and even alter our way of seeing (Ren\u00e9 Magritte\u2019s La Repr\u00e9sentation). Artists around the world have long been using it to talk about race and sexual identity. Kehinde Wiley painted several African icons of the sport, such as Cameroon\u2019s Samuel Eto\u2019o, while Eddie Peake\u2019s 2012 performance piece Touch, in which a game of five-aside is performed with naked men, challenged how we view the close contact of intertwining bodies. QPR fan Caroline Coon has spent over three decades using the game as a canvas on which she can explore gender. \u201cIn my Arena series paintings,\u201d she says, \u201cI try to rectify our unequal world by putting women and men in sport as equals, sharing in the primitive glamour of competition and play. I allude to gender fluidity that is a human truth.\u201d This work seems especially relevant during Qatar. As she puts it: \u201cHaving a World Cup in a place where there is limited mixing of the sexes in public, where women are lawfully subjugated by men, was bound to cause trouble!\u201d  In 2017 Hank Willis Thomas staged ideas-packed show The Beautiful Game in which, among other things, he recreated famous artworks by Matisse and Stuart Davis using football strips in order to critique the way capitalism had crept into every area of the game. \u201cOn one level,\u201d he told me back then, \u201csport is about local competition. But it\u2019s also about international competition and corporate competition. There\u2019s a lot of stuff clashing.\u201d Eddy Frankel, Time Out London\u2019s art and culture editor, is a man who knows all about the intersection of art and football. Seven years ago, he was reporting on an art auction while sneakily watching his team Spurs play Liverpool on his phone. After a while, he realised that a dozen or so other art lovers were hovering nearby, hoping to catch the action. \u201cWe all had a love for art,\u201d he says, \u201cand also a secret love for football that we were not allowed to tell anyone about. So I started researching.\u201d Alongside Jennie and Justin Hammond they set up Oof, the world\u2019s first art space dedicated exclusively to the beautiful game. A visit there is quite an experience. Not only is it situated in a Grade II-listed Georgian townhouse, but it can only be entered by the public through the gift shop at Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s new stadium. According to surveys, 98% of their visitors have never been to a contemporary art show before. Introducing football fans in a deprived part of London to some fairly far-out modern artwork is what gets Frankel excited: \u201cFootball is supposed to be for everyone, so we like the idea that art can be as well.\u201d  Showing during the World Cup are a series of mirrored works by Mark Titchner featuring football-inspired phrases (\u201cEnvy the success of others\u201d). As you view them the room is filled with the noise of a crowd during a goal kick that has been stretched out over five minutes. It\u2019s engaging but weird and slightly unsettling too. Frankel admits it can be tricky to engage some visitors who have limited experience of visiting contemporary art shows. He noticed things that seemed second nature to him \u2013 picking up handouts and reading wall texts \u2013 were being ignored by the majority of visitors, and so finding new ways to make the artworks accessible has been an interesting challenge. Sometimes things don\u2019t work out. Frankel laughs recalling the time he secured an exhibition of George Shaw paintings (\u201cbeautiful, we were so proud to have them\u201d) only for a kid to walk in then straight out, saying to his mum \u201cit\u2019s just paintings\u201d. But he says there are moments each day that reassure him that Oof is serving its purpose. \u201cPeople take pictures of every work of art, or come up to us with a million questions,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have people who come back every match day to show their mates what they\u2019ve seen. You\u2019ll have parents desperate to get to their seats for kick off, but their full-kit 11-year-old insists on going from room to room and trying to find out as much as they can about every work.\u201d Balance is key. Often Oof will have a more accessible show running alongside a challenging one. Offsetting the Titchner works is a room of artist-designed football scarves. There are scarves by David Shrigley and Guerilla Girls, scarves of dogs peeing on police cars, scarves featuring real life incidents of streaking. Natasha Eves immortalises the (lack of) footballing skills of Matt Hancock for her contribution, whereas Jonathan Kelham realised that St Annes in Bristol didn\u2019t actually have a football team so he invented one for his Super Duper St Annes FC scarf.  \u201cVery little of this is actually about football,\u201d notes Frankel, who has also filled an impressive 10 issues of Oof magazine with football-related art content. \u201cIt\u2019s about female representation, religion, politics \u2026 and that\u2019s when using football gets interesting. Football is a microcosm of society. Belief, passion, joy, ecstasy, bigotry, hatred, violence \u2026 all of that happens in this tiny bowl of 70,000 people or in the pub or at home. And artists can exploit that.\u201d Perhaps the most exciting artwork I see during my week-long odyssey into the world of art and football is not yet on display. Tucked away inside Oof is a tiny studio where an artist in residence is invited in to make work free of charge. Frankel lets me have a peek at what their current resident JJ Guest is getting up to: work that explores the game\u2019s strange mix of homophobia and homoeroticism. There are giant aluminium panels featuring images from the pitch, but with the balls removed and turned into glory holes. Ceramic balls have been shaped to hang in pairs in a net. Best of all are some square bathroom tiles that, when sprayed with liquid, reveal a scene of footballers taking a communal bath together. As the picture emerges it feels oddly voyeuristic, like you\u2019re viewing it from behind a misty shower screen, but Guest reportedly has grander plans for the tiles: to install them in a working urinal so that streams of urine will reveal this naked gathering of men. Could they end up in the Spurs stadium toilets? It might sound far fetched, but the week I visited Oof, the gallery was preparing to beam one of Mark Titchner\u2019s word art pieces \u2013 We Believe in Us - around the stadium hoardings at half time. \u201cI just hope we\u2019re not losing,\u201d said Justin Hammond. Well they were losing: 2-1 to Leeds at the break. But by the final whistle it was 4-3 to Spurs \u2013 suggesting that art and football isn\u2019t just a viable combination, but remarkably effective too. "

The match on Friday against Australia, also in Melbourne and with a similar weather forecast, thus becomes a virtual eliminator, with neither side able to afford defeat.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t play well you can get punished,\u201d Wood said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be the No 1 team in the world, it can be any team. We knew the intensity had to be there and the first 10 overs that intensity wasn\u2019t there. That is what\u2019s most important. We set high standards and want to be consistent. To win competitions you\u2019ve got to maintain those standards and we weren\u2019t at that level.\u201d\nThough Ireland have defeated England before, including at the 50\u2011over World Cup in 2011, their captain, Andrew Balbirnie, said this stood as the greatest victory. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had a result like this,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe came into this round knowing that any win we got would be a huge achievement. You look through their XI. I looked through it this morning and at the match-ups and part of me was struggling to understand if they show up how we compete with them.\u201d\n\nJos Buttler, the England captain, was out for a duck two balls into his side\u2019s innings, and said the defeat would sting his players. \u201cWe should let it hurt,\u201d he said. \u201cDays like today are really, really disappointing and you\u2019ve got to feel that. There\u2019s no point in saying let\u2019s sweep it under the carpet and move on. \n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t we were a little bit off.

Seventeen US stadiums in 16 areas remain in the bidding for the first 48-team World Cup, with the Los Angeles area submitting both SoFi Stadium in Inglewood and the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, site of the 1994 World Cup final. Three stadiums each in Canada and Mexico are expected to be used. The bid plan envisioned 16 total sites for the tournament. Fifa targeted mid-May for announcing site selections, and then pushed that back a month. The 2026 World Cup will be the first with three co-hosts. Fifa selected the bid as joint host in June 2018. Sixty games are to be played in the US, including all from the quarterfinals on. Canada and Mexico are to host 10 games each. Chicago, Minneapolis and Arizona dropped out in March 2018 because of what city officials said were burdensome financial demands by Fifa. At the time, Charlotte, North Carolina; Las Vegas; Salt Lake City; and Tampa, Florida, were cut. FedEx Field in Landover, Maryland, withdrew in April. Montreal dropped out last August after the Quebec provincial government withdrew its support. It was replaced in April by Vancouver, British Columbia, which made an initial bid in 2017, then said in March 2018 it had been rejected because it refused to comply with Fifa\u2019s requirements that include tax waivers and putting agreements under Swiss law.

                    "body": "The England head coach, Shaun Wane, has laughed off suggestions that this year\u2019s World Cup has been geared in favour of the hosts. England take on Samoa at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday for a place in the following weekend\u2019s final while in the other semi-final the two sides who between them have won the past nine World Cups, Australia and New Zealand, square off. There has been frustration from some nations about the logistical operations they have had to endure at the tournament. Samoa have relocated twice after being left disappointed by their base \u2013 they moved from Doncaster to Bolton and then on to Manchester. Australia have also switched from their initial training base at the Etihad Campus to Salford\u2019s AJ Bell Stadium.  That, coupled with the fact Australia and New Zealand are in a different half of the draw to the hosts, has left some opposition sides questioning whether England have had an easier ride. Wane emphatically does not feel that is the case and said whoever wins Saturday\u2019s semi between his side and Samoa has a tougher turnaround for the final. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard that before, and I never thought I would hear that,\u201d he laughed. \u201cI just don\u2019t see where that comes from. The Aussies are playing Friday and we\u2019re on Saturday, 24 hours later. So they\u2019ll have an extra day in a steam room, nice and relaxed. They\u2019ve got another 24 hours on us. I think the World Cup have done a great job. We\u2019re changing hotels this weekend, travelling to London and we look at that as exciting.\u201d England are separated from the other two heavyweights in the draw because of the world rankings. New Zealand, who are ranked first, are playing Australia on Friday because the Kangaroos are ranked fourth in the world, largely due to their lack of desire to play any international rugby league in recent years. England are ranked third and were set to face second-placed Tonga before the latter were beaten by the Samoans last Sunday. Saturday\u2019s semi-final is a rematch of the tournament\u2019s opening game a month ago, when England triumphed 60-6 in Newcastle. Wane will make one change for the game, with Luke Thompson replacing the St Helens forward Matty Lees in his 17-man squad, but he denied complacency will be an issue despite England being heavy favourites. \u201cWe\u2019re very positive and respectful to Samoa,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not that sort of group. We never mentioned the first game. We know it\u2019s a different team. They\u2019re talented with a lot of really good players from NRL. They\u2019ll challenge us. It\u2019s the makings of a really good hit out.\u201d Meanwhile, the England coach Craig Richards praised his side\u2019s fighting spirit after they surged back from an early shock to sink Papua New Guinea 42-4 and seal their place at the top of Group A in the women\u2019s Rugby League World Cup. An early try from Martha Molowia promised to give Richards\u2019s side the test they craved but they stormed back with eight tries including a hat-trick for winger Leah Burke and a brace for Amy Hardcastle. It was just the test required by Richards as he builds his squad towards a likely semi-final clash with New Zealand, who conclude Group B on Thursday night against red-hot favourites Australia. \u201cWe needed a few questions to be answered and while you never want to be scored against as a coach, we found out the answer about what we do when we go behind,\u201d said Richards. \u201cI don\u2019t think we could have gone into the semis against either Australia or New Zealand without something tough, a physical battle and some adversity, and that\u2019s we got tonight. \u201cTonight was about grit. We knew it wouldn\u2019t be fancy at times and it wasn\u2019t, and that\u2019s what pleased me the most - the girls sticking together, staying connected and winning the game in a different way to how we won the first two.\u201d"

They\u2019ve had to step forward, and they\u2019ve had to as a group come close together, and it\u2019s going to benefit us in the long run, no doubt. The team have to be together. Tonight a couple of errors have cost us the goals, but I focused on the fact they played with tremendous spirit and showed a belief that we haven\u2019t showed in the last few games. I think the crowd could see that, and they rose to it.\u201d     10.06pm    Gareth Southgate will be speaking to Channel 4 soon \u2026 so don\u2019t go away for good \u2026 but David Hytner\u2019s report has landed. Here it is!      9.52pm    Harry Kane talks to Channel 4. \u201cThat was a lot better. Thought we played really well. We were unfortunate to go 2-0 behind. A mistake and a great goal from the edge of the box. We did really well to stay into the game and get the lead, then unfortunately another error. But the fight in the team, the mentality we showed \u2026 we didn\u2019t get the win but we can be proud of what we have done, and it puts us into a good place going into the World Cup. A shame we couldn\u2019t get the win, but we keep going. A busy six weeks or so, then we get ready for the World Cup! This will put us in a positive mindset going forward. We\u2019re going to have to be ready. We know we still have to improve.\u201d     9.48pm    That late equaliser will deflate England a little. Of course it will. For now. But when it all comes down, their mood should be pretty buoyant. What a comeback they launched! They looked utterly shot, bereft of ideas and hope, very much second best to a Germany side hardly hitting top gear themselves. Two months of miserable introspection stretched out ahead. Intolerable pressure on Gareth Southgate. Somehow, they hauled themselves off the canvas and got themselves going again. Three goals in 12 minutes have utterly changed the mood music surrounding Southgate and England, just in time. It\u2019s not perfect, but they\u2019d have taken this result when Kai Havertz whistled Germany\u2019s second into the top left!   Updated at 9.50pm BST    9.43pm   FULL TIME: England 3-3 Germany  The whistle goes. Gareth Southgate and Hansi Flick embrace each other, all friendly smiles. Similarly Harry Kane and Thomas Muller. What a sensational half of football!     9.42pm    90 min +6: Saka yet again makes a nuisance of himself down the inside right. The ball nearly pinballs through to Mount on the penalty spot, but Ter Stegen claims.     9.40pm    90 min +4: All a bit scrappy. It\u2019d be churlish to moan.     9.39pm    90 min +3: Schlotterbeck tries to release Werner into the England box down the inside-left channel, but larrups his pass out for a goal kick.     9.38pm    90 min +2: Both teams take it down a notch, perhaps preparing for one last hurrah.     9.37pm    90 min +1: Nothing comes of the corner, Shaw floating it too close to Ter Stegen. Meanwhile both teams make a change: Bella-Kotchap comes on for Havertz, while Bellingham makes way for Henderson. There will be six added minutes.     9.36pm    90 min: There\u2019s some hubbub in the England box but the hosts clear. Kane whips a pass up the right for Saka, who is clear! He dribbles all the way into the England box and aims for the bottom-left corner. It\u2019s heading in, but Ter Stegen fingertips around the post for a corner. This is breathless!     9.35pm    89 min: Suddenly it\u2019s Germany with their tails up. Gosens loops into the England box from the left. Maguire heads clear. Wembley bubbles with tension, and it\u2019s the German fans making all the noise now.     9.34pm   GOAL! England 3-3 Germany (Havertz 87)  Gnabry strides in from the left. He shoots low and hard, towards the bottom right. Pope blocks, and should claim, but doesn\u2019t keep hold of the ball. It squirts out to Havertz, who clips into the bottom left from close range! The air sucked out of Wembley all of a sudden. What a second half!   Updated at 9.36pm BST    9.32pm    86 min: Kane makes good down the left but can\u2019t find anyone with his cross. Germany go up the other end, and \u2026     9.30pm    84 min: Kehrer is booked for too much yap during the protests over the penalty decision.     9.30pm   GOAL! England 3-2 Germany (Kane 83 pen)  Kane lashes into the top-left corner. Vicious! Unstoppable! Ter Stegen guessed correctly, but had no chance of stopping that! Wembley is bouncing. Germany are stunned.    Updated at 11.02pm BST    9.28pm   Penalty for England!  82 min: Yep, it\u2019s a penalty all right. Schlotterbeck was clumsy rather than malicious, but he could have hurt Bellingham badly there. Happily the England midfielder is fine to continue. The German defender is booked, and Kane prepares to take the spot kick.   Updated at 9.43pm BST    9.27pm    81 min: Saka has been superb since coming on, and he again causes all manner of bother down the inside-right channel. He slips infield for Kane, who turns and whistles a shot towards the top right. It\u2019s deflected out for a corner, but VAR has spotted Schlotterbeck catching Bellingham on the shin with his studs while stretching in the penalty box. I think this is going to be a spot kick for England!     9.25pm    79 min: \u2026 but Musiala can\u2019t continue. He makes way for Muller. Germany could do with a wise old head right now.     9.24pm    78 min: \u2026 so in order to draw a little of the sting from the game, Musiala goes down with cramp. Kane is signally unimpressed, standing over the stricken player and frowning suspiciously.  Updated at 9.25pm BST    9.23pm    77 min: England had been so flat until that double whammy. Nobody saw that coming. But now look! There\u2019s an extra spring in every English step.      9.22pm    76 min: Those London buses, huh?     9.21pm   GOAL! England 2-2 Germany (Mount 75)  You wait nine hours and 26 minutes for a goal from open play, then two come along in three minutes and five seconds! Saka dribbles hard down the inside-right channel and passes infield for Mount, who fires a rising first-time shot into the top right from 25 yards! Wembley erupts!    Updated at 9.44pm BST    9.20pm    74 min: That\u2019s England\u2019s long wait for a goal from open play over. The clock stopped at nine hours and 26 minutes.  Updated at 9.32pm BST    9.19pm   GOAL! England 1-2 Germany (Shaw 72)  Bellingham bursts from a deep position and sends a pass down the right for James, who one-twos with Saka before crossing deep. Shaw chests down at the left-hand corner of the six-yard box, and forces a shot under Ter Stegen and into the bottom left. Hope for England!   Updated at 9.22pm BST    9.17pm    71 min: The counter for the second started when Sule stripped Maguire of possession deep in the Germany half. It\u2019s not been a banner evening for the England defender.     9.15pm    69 min: Bellingham has a little bit of time and space 30 yards out. Germany seem happy enough to let him have it. He lines one up and fires it straight down Ter Stegen\u2019s throat.     9.14pm    68 min: That was such a sweet strike. Made in Chelsea. Sort of. Germany could really put the hurt on England, too, because on come Gnabry and Gosens in place of Raum and Sane.     9.13pm   GOAL! England 0-2 Germany (Havertz 67)  Werner breaks down the left. He cuts inside, lines up his options, then rolls across for Havertz, just to the right of the D. Havertz opens up his body and powers a curler into the top-left corner. Pope no chance!   Updated at 9.16pm BST    9.12pm    66 min: Sterling and Foden make way for Mount and Saka.     9.12pm    65 min: James wins a corner that Dier harmlessly heads over. The one-on-one Sterling save apart, Ter Stegen has had very little to do.     9.11pm    64 min: England suddenly look quite unsure of themselves again. They can\u2019t get anything going. Meanwhile vindication for your MBM hack comes in the shape of Tom Chivers. \u201cYour monochrome correspondent is wrong,\u201d he writes, quoting some dictionary entry or other which describes \u201ca photograph or picture developed or executed in black and white.\u201d So now you I know.     9.08pm    62 min: Musiala grooves his way down the middle of the park before releasing Werner into space down the left channel. Werner enters the box, draws Pope, and bundles a low shot across the keeper but also wide of the goalframe. Germany are seriously threatening a second.     9.07pm    60 min: Germany are knocking. Sule one-twos down the inside-right channel and drags a low shot inches wide of the bottom-left corner. Pope had it covered.      9.05pm    59 min: Werner dribbles into the England box from the right. Dier slips. Werner tries to tee up Havertz instead of shooting himself, and that allows Walker to clean up the mess. For a split second there, England were in all sorts of bother.     9.04pm    58 min: Germany only half clear the corner, and Bellingham meets it on the right-hand edge of the D. He slips as he shoots and the ball flies harmlessly wide. This is a decent response to falling behind by England.     9.03pm    57 min: Rice barges his way down the left and is sent crashing by Kehrer. A free kick near the touchline, 20 yards out. James curls it in. Ter Stegen punches confidently clear. England come again, though, James winning a corner off Raum down the right. Foden to take.     9.01pm    56 min: James shimmies down the right and cuts back for Bellingham, who flays a wild shot high and wide from the edge of the box. Bellingham was England\u2019s best player in Italy, but he\u2019s been a lot quieter tonight.     9.00pm    54 min: England try to respond immediately. Shaw crosses from the left. The ball hits Raum, off the chest of Bellingham. Sule batters clear. England claim a penalty, but Raum taps his head \u2026 and he\u2019s right. It was a clear header. A desperate shout by England.     8.58pm   GOAL! England 0-1 Germany (Gundogan 52 pen)  Gundogan, who scored from the spot here for Borussia Dortmund in the 2013 Champions League final, slots confidently into the bottom right. Pope was never getting to it. What a clinical finish!    Updated at 9.14pm BST    8.57pm   Penalty for Germany!  51 min: Masiala dribbles into the England box from the right. He looks to zip past Maguire on the left. Maguire sticks out a leg and brings his man down. The referee waves play on \u2026 but VAR orders the referee to have a second look. He only needs one more. It\u2019s an obvious penalty. A clumsy challenge. The referee mimes a TV screen, then points to the spot.   Updated at 9.06pm BST    8.56pm    50 min: England are nearly undone by the simplest of moves. Kimmich wedges down the middle. The ball drops over Werner\u2019s shoulder. Werner loops over the out-rushing Pope but also well over the bar. The flag goes up for offside, but had Werner found the net, VAR would surely have allowed the goal, Shaw well out of position on the right.     8.54pm    49 min: A little bit of space for Sterling out on the left. He drops a shoulder to shuffle inside and curls one towards the top right. But there\u2019s no real whip in the delivery, and it\u2019s easy pickings for Ter Stegen.     8.53pm    47 min: A slow start to the half. Sterling and Musiala both have a dribble to little effect.     8.52pm    England get the second half underway. Germany have made a change, sending on Timo Werner in place of Hofmann. \u201cMonochrome Ajax?\u201d splutters Steve Bassett. \u201cSurely monochrome refers to one colour only? I\u2019m pretty sure there are two on that Germany shirt.\u201d Bah! My black-and-white blues. Your poor MBM hack is under fire from all angles tonight. How about Grayscale Godenzonen? Is that any better? It\u2019s not going to be, is it.     8.40pm    Half-time advertisement. Sign up now! Sign up now! Sign up now? Sign up now!      8.37pm   HALF TIME: England 0-0 Germany  Neither team are making much of a statement ahead of the World Cup. Actually, scrub that: they are, but it\u2019s not the one they\u2019d want.     8.35pm    45 min +2: Kimmich is afforded too much time, 25 yards out, and sends a fierce daisycutter inches wide of the left-hand post. Pope might have had it covered \u2026 but you wouldn\u2019t bet the house on it.     8.33pm    45 min: There will be two added minutes.     8.32pm    44 min: Sterling has been England\u2019s liveliest player, and he\u2019s sent into the Germany box down the left by Kane. Foden is free in the middle, but Schlotterbeck gets in the road, so Sterling has to have a crack from a tight angle instead. Ter Stegen is behind it all the way.     8.31pm    43 min: Hofmann, who has been pretty lively, swings one in from the right. Walker chests down under not much pressure from Havertz, and Pope claims.     8.30pm    42 min: See 40 min. This half is petering out.     8.28pm    40 min: Germany hog the ball but don\u2019t do a great deal with it.     8.26pm    38 min: Shaw mooches into the German box from the left and wins a corner. Foden swings it in, and Maguire heads harmlessly over.     8.25pm    37 min: Stones limps off shaking his head sadly. Bad news for Stones, for England, and for Manchester City. Kyle Walker comes on in his place.     8.24pm    36 min: Stones pulls up while in full flight, grabs the back of his right leg, and drops to the floor. Pretty sure he\u2019ll not be continuing. On this unfortunate subject, and to follow up the salvo from Kimberley Thonger, here\u2019s Brendan Large: \u201cJust to warn you that I for one will be blaming you when Kane breaks a metatarsal one week before the World Cup, after you so idiotically described the armband he \u2018will\u2019 be wearing in Qatar. Will you journos never learn?\u201d I hear you and will endeavour to etc., and so on.   Updated at 8.33pm BST    8.22pm    34 min: Germany probe this way and that, before Kimmich tries to find Musiala in the England box with a shovel down the inside-left channel. There\u2019s too much juice on the pass and it\u2019s a goal kick. Meanwhile here\u2019s Kimberley Thonger: \u201cScott, could I respectfully point out that phrases like \u2018Germany are suddenly looking a little bit ragged\u2019 or \u2018English tails are up after that fine move and near miss\u2019 are traditionally followed by the words \u2018and Germany open the scoring\u2019?\u201d I hear you and will endeavour to do better.     8.20pm    32 min: Hofmann and Kehrer combine again down the right. The former\u2019s cross is clanked clear by Sterling. Meanwhile replays of the penalty claim show Sterling taking a good old fistful of Kehrer\u2019s shirt \u2026 but letting go well before the German full back went to ground. It would have been pretty soft, though Sterling was taking an unnecessary chance.     8.18pm    30 min: Hofmann slides a pass down the right for Kehrer, who goes down in the penalty box. Germany want a penalty for a tug on Kehrer\u2019s shirt by Sterling, but the referee isn\u2019t interested.     8.17pm    28 min: Germany are suddenly looking a little bit ragged. Kane powers down the inside-right channel and rolls infield for Sterling, who is level with the last man \u2026 but, in trying to return the ball to Kane, free to his side, Sterling hoicks clumsily out for a goal kick.     8.15pm    27 min: \u2026 Kane sees a header blocked, then loops a diagonal shot wide left. England have finally awoken from their slumber. Much better from the hosts, and Wembley responds in kind!     8.14pm    26 min: English tails are up after that fine move and near miss, and Foden worms his way down the right before reaching the byline and looking to find Kane with a cutback. Kehrer reads the danger marvellously and clacks out for a corner. One corner leads to another, and \u2026     8.13pm    25 min: Shaw tears down the inside-left channel and curls a low diagonal pass infield for Sterling. He drops a shoulder to see off Schlotterback and find himself one on one with Ter Stegen! He aims for the bottom left, but the keeper parries well.   Updated at 8.21pm BST    8.11pm    23 min: Hofmann curls deep from the right wing. Havertz and Musiala can\u2019t quite combine at the far post, both failing to tee each other up. Maguire clears. \u201c\u2018Monochrome Ajax\u2019 is a keen description of the Germany kit,\u201d writes Peter Oh. \u201cExtreme close-up Juve might also work.\u201d It sure does. Distressed Notts County?     8.09pm    21 min: Stones plays a no-look backpass to Pope from the edge of his own six-yard box! Hofmann very nearly closes the keeper down. A few seconds before, Stones over-elaborated and was nearly stripped of possession by Musiala. He shimmied out of trouble nicely, but it was bother of his own making. A shaky 60 seconds for the England centre-back.     8.07pm    19 min: Germany are beginning to see more of the ball. England second to most things at the minute. Their confidence can\u2019t be high; they\u2019re certainly not flowing. Two-pass moves at a premium for England right now.   Updated at 8.18pm BST    8.05pm    17 min: Gundogan looks for Raum, racing down the inside-left channel. James slyly nudges Raum off balance, and while play goes on elsewhere for a bit, the assistant referee\u2019s flag goes up. It\u2019s a free kick just to the left of the D. A dangerous position, this, but Sane blooters it straight at the England wall, and the hosts clear.     8.03pm    15 min: The German press is causing England one or two small issues. Musiala closes down Maguire and it\u2019s another corner for Germany. The set piece leads to some fairly uninspiring head tennis, and England eventually clear their lines.     8.01pm    13 min: Sterling has a probe down the left and one-twos with Rice. It\u2019s neat football in a tight space, but the flag goes up for a marginal offside.     7.59pm    11 min: Pope takes a heavy touch, allowing Musiala to close him down. His kick upfield is blocked, and ends up at the feet of Gundogan, who whistles a shot harmlessly over the bar from the edge of the D. Pope gets away with a big mistake there, and offers the hand of apology to his team-mates.     7.58pm    10 min: \u2026 and Sterling is this close to releasing Foden down the middle with a sliderule pass. But the Germans slam the door shut just in time.     7.57pm    9 min: Kehrer is afforded far too much time out on the right. He curls in a cross, hoping to find Havertz on the penalty spot. Dier comes across to concede the first corner of the game. Raum\u2019s delivery is no good, and England are away on the counter \u2026     7.56pm    8 min: Foden drives down the middle and finds Kane in acres on the right. Kane tries to return the ball to Foden, racing into the box, but the cross is too long. Goal kick. Both teams are beginning to warm up.     7.55pm    7 min: A lot of space now for Musiala, who takes advantage by powering down the middle. He\u2019s got options either side, but loses concentration momentarily, slows down, and allows Rice to get back and put a stop to his gallop. The move\u2019s momentum broken, Schlotterbeck sends a simple pass out of play.     7.53pm    5 min: A lot of space for Shaw to run into down the left. All Kane needs to do is find him and England are away. The captain flays a pass carelessly out for a throw.     7.52pm    4 min: All a bit scrappy, so the band strike up a tune. When there\u2019s something to report, you\u2019ll be the first to know.     7.50pm    2 min: Maguire sprays a pass down the right for Kane, who exchanges passes with James and nearly wins the first corner of the game. Otherwise, a fairly slow start, and Wembley is no longer at full voice. Fairly subdued at the minute.     7.49pm    23 sec: Kane sticks his arm under Schlotterbeck\u2019s throat, and looks offended when the whistle goes for a free kick. You\u2019ve seen bookings for less, but 23 seconds in is 23 seconds in.     7.48pm    Germany get the ball rolling. Wembley finds its voice again.      7.47pm    One of those minutes is held in silence in memory of Queen Elizabeth II. Sir Geoff Hurst and a representative of the German FA lay wreathes. Then Wembley\u2019s lights dip. The moment impeccably observed.   Updated at 8.56pm BST    7.43pm    The teams are out! Plenty of the old noise as England and Germany take to the pitch. Then the national anthems. The Song of Germany, followed by God Save the King. We\u2019ll be off in a couple of minutes.     7.37pm    Gareth Southgate takes positivity to a new level when interviewed by Channel 4. \u201cWe felt tonight was a good opportunity to start Luke Shaw. He\u2019s a super player. We thought Eric Dier coming back into the side played really well. We\u2019ve got lots of good players on the bench. We\u2019ve got a big squad and four right-backs of super quality. At the moment Kieran Trippier is playing exceptionally well, and Reece James has been one of the outstanding players in the league at the start of the season. But we know Trent is a very, very good footballer and that\u2019s why we picked him in the squad. It\u2019s been a testing week, but these are necessary steps for a team to go through sometimes. The players have been exceptional in the way they\u2019ve stepped up. We\u2019re going to be playing under pressure when we go to the World Cup, so it doesn\u2019t do us any harm to be in that situation already.\u201d     7.13pm    Harry Kane (74 caps, 50 goals) speaks to Channel 4 (P5, W0, D2, L3): \u201cWe need to be more clinical. We got into good areas the other night, but didn\u2019t have the final pass or the final run. In these big games it\u2019s the fine margins, so hopefully we can put that right tonight. We\u2019ve worked hard in the two days we\u2019ve had and hopefully it\u2019ll be our night tonight. We know it\u2019s going to be a tough game. We need to play our own game.\u201d     7.08pm    Another memory of 1966 and all that. England will be wearing red shirts tonight. Captain Harry Kane will also wear the anti-discrimination armband he\u2019ll sport in Qatar. Germany step out in their new monochrome Ajax number.      6.56pm    This is England\u2019s first international at home since the passing of Queen Elizabeth II. She\u2019s commemorated on the cover of tonight\u2019s match programme by the iconic image of her handing over the Jules Rimet Trophy to Bobby Moore at Wembley in 1966.   There will also be black corner flags, while fans will form a mosaic of the flag of St George while belting out God Save the King for the first time at an England game for over 70 years.     6.47pm    Gareth Southgate makes two changes to his starting XI in the wake of the defeat in Italy. John Stones and Luke Shaw are back, with Kyle Walker and Bukayo Saka dropping to the bench. Ivan Toney is also named as a sub, hoping to come on for his debut. Fikayo Tomori and Trent Alexander-Arnold were the two big names omitted from the squad. Stones, back from suspension, will make up a back three with Harry Maguire and Eric Dier. Hansi Flick makes four changes to his starting XI after the loss to Hungary. Kai Havertz of Chelsea, West Ham\u2019s Thilo Kehrer, former England youth and current Bayern Munich star Jamal Musiala, and Borussia Dortmund\u2019s Nico Schlotterbeck are in. They replace Thomas Muller, Timo Werner and Serge Gnabry, who drop to the bench, and the suspended Antonio Rudiger.     6.36pm   The teams  England: Pope, James, Stones, Dier, Maguire, Shaw, Rice, Bellingham, Foden, Sterling, Kane.Subs: Trippier, Ramsdale, Henderson, Walker, Coady, Guehi, Saka, Mount, Toney, Chilwell, Henderson, Abraham. Germany: ter Stegen, Kehrer, Sule, Schlotterbeck, Raum, Kimmich, Gundogan, Hofmann, Musiala, Sane, Havertz.Subs: Baumann, Ginter, Arnold, Werner, Gnabry, Trapp, Muller, Henrichs, Bella-Kotchap, Gosens. Referee: Danny Makkelie (Netherlands).     6.30pm   Preamble  Of course, on the one hand, this means absolutely nothing. Germany can\u2019t win the group and make it to the finals; England are already relegated from the top tier. But that\u2019s just the price. What about the value? Germany could do with a result in their last serious test before the World Cup in November, especially after losing at home to Hungary on Friday evening. But England are even more desperate, after two draws and three defeats in their last five games, one of those losses their biggest setback at home since the 1920s. They haven\u2019t scored a goal from open play in over seven hours of football; with Gareth Southgate booed off after the last two games, it would seem all the goodwill earned by appearances in the 2018 World Cup semis and the Euro 2020 final has, fairly or unfairly, pretty much drained away. A win tonight against one of the old enemies, in England\u2019s last match before Qatar, would cut Southgate some precious slack. Anything else will ratchet up the pressure and sour the national mood for the entirety of the two-month run-up to the World Cup. No biggie, then. Kick off at Wembley is at 7.45pm BST. It\u2019s on!

                    "body": "It happened in the 58th minute, and Ren\u00e9 Meulensteen heard it first. The Socceroos assistant coach was in the dugout at Al Janoub Stadium when word filtered through that Tunisia had scored. Over at the Education City Stadium, Wahbi Khazri had made a mazy run through a second-string France team and taken a 1-0 lead. It meant Australia, who were still 0-0 with Denmark, now had to win to advance as runners-up of Group D.  France were supposed to account for Tunisia with ease, a scenario that would have only required Graham Arnold\u2019s side to draw with the Danes. But Didier Deschamps, in the knowledge his title holders had already qualified, had rested almost his entire first-choice starting XI. That decision rather complicated matters in the concurrent final group match across the city. Arnold was on his feet in Australia\u2019s technical area when Meulensteen was informed about Khazri\u2019s goal. He might have had to break the news to Arnold at some point, except that he didn\u2019t have time. \u201cIt was just a quiet word from Tony Vidmar in my ear \u2013 no more information, no reason to jump at it and panic,\u201d Meulensteen said afterwards. \u201cThe great thing was it happened, and then a minute later, we scored.\u201d Two minutes later, to be exact, when Mitchell Duke started a devastating counter-attack, finding Riley McGree who, in turn, anticipated Leckie\u2019s run from halfway. The latter then raced off on his own, twisting Joakim M\u00e6hle to his will before veering left and sending his finish across the front of Kasper Schmeichel\u2019s goal and inside the far post. \u201cThat is when I told Arnie \u2018listen, Tunisia is winning 1-0\u2019,\u201d Muelensteen said. \u201cAnd I grabbed Milo\u0161 Degenek to say \u2018get in a huddle and tell the players to make sure they know where we are [and] we have to win, we have to keep a clean sheet\u2019.\u201d Degenek did his duty and conveyed the message \u2013 except that nobody believed him. \u201cI said if we don\u2019t win the Tunisians will sneak through to the round of 16 on goal difference,\u201d Degenek said. \u201cThe boys thought it was me psyching them up so we won\u2019t lose, but it was actually me being serious.\u201d The 28-year-old has both a dry wit and a self-described \u201clion mentality\u201d which drives him to win at all costs, and Jackson Irvine admitted he thought his teammate was relaying fake news to keep them motivated. \u201cIn the back of my mind I was actually like, \u2018well done, Milo\u0161, that\u2019s a good idea,\u201d Irvine said. \u201cTell the boys that we need a win, absolutely\u2019. And then you find out later on [he was telling the truth].\u201d In his post-match press conference, Arnold said he did not know Tunisia had beaten France 1-0 until after the final whistle. \u201cI would have been absolutely devastated if we had got a draw and it didn\u2019t pan out the way it did,\u201d he said."

                    "body": "  6.15pm   Match report: Netherlands 1-1 Ecuador  Group A: \u201cEcuador can be far happier with this draw because after conceding early, Gustova Alfaro\u2019s team played played front-foot football that went close to administering a fatal blow to the Netherlands.\u201d Jamie Jackson reports from Doha.   Updated at 6.16pm GMT    6.02pm    A quick recap: Cody Gakpo put the Dutch a goal up in the sixth minute, a goal that was cancelled out by Enner Valencia a few minutes after half-time. But while the scores finished level, the performances were anything but and Ecuador are likely to feel aggrieved at not taking all three points. They had their European opponents under extreme pressure for long periods, particularly throughout the second half and came close to scoring a second goal on several occasions.      5.58pm   Full time: Netherlands 1-1 Ecuador  Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeeeeeep! It\u2019s all over and the points are shared, which means the host nation Qatar cannot now qualify for the knockout stages, however well they perform in their final group game against the Netherlands.   Updated at 6.02pm GMT    5.55pm    90+5 min: Sarmiento sends the ball into the Dutch penalty area from the corner flag. His outswinger comes off the head of Virgil Van Dijk.      5.54pm    90+4 min: Preciado and Sarmiento combine down by the corner flag as Ecuador try to get a cross into the Netherlands penalty area. They win a corner.      5.53pm    90+1 min: Into six minutes of added time we go. On for only his second international appearance, Rodriguez almost scores. Noppert tries to kick the ball upfield and sees his life flash before his eyes as the ball hits the Ecuadorian substitute\u2019s back and ricochets wide of the goal.      5.50pm    89 min: Enner Valencia leaves the field on a stretcher in a state of affairs that does not bode well for his future participation in this tournament. Ecuador double-substitution: Rodriguez and Ibarra on for Valencia and Plata.      5.49pm    89 min: There\u2019s a break in play as Valencia receives treatment.      5.48pm    87 min: Denzel Dumfries sends a cross into the Ecuador penalty area but the ball ends up in the hands of Hernan Galindez. Ecuador\u2019s playersa are unhappy as the Dutch played on with Enner Valencia on the ground apparently nursing the knee he injured on Monday.   Updated at 6.01pm GMT    5.46pm    85 min: Nathan Ake is hacked down by Caicedo as he tries to gallop up the inside-left. The Ecuadorian is lucky to escape a booking but the Netherlands have a free-kick in a decent position to get the ball into the box. It\u2019s not good enough, however \u2013 Steven Berghuis\u2019s delivery is atrocious and fails to clear the first man.      5.45pm    83 min: Ecuador throw-in, halfway inside the Dutch half. The Netherlands win possession back and the ball finds it\u2019s way to Noppert, who wellies it high upfield.      5.43pm    82 min: Into the final 10 minutes (and the rest) we go, with Ecuador very much in the ascendency in this second half. Whatever the outcome of Groups A and B one suspects England would fancy them over the Dutch in the Round of 16, but on the evidence of this second half Gareth Southgate\u2019s side would be foolish to take them even remotely lightly.      5.41pm    79 min: Netherlands double-substitution: Wout Weghorst and Marten de Roon replace Cody Gakpo and Teun Koopmeiners.      5.39pm    78 min: Gakpo is penalised again, this time for a foul on Jhegson Mendez near the halfway line.      5.37pm    76 min: Timber tries to rob Sarmiento of possession near the halfway line but is penalised for fouling him.      5.36pm    74 min: Ecuador substitution: Jeremy Sarmiento joins his Brighton and Ecuador teammates Moises Caicedo and Pervis Estupinan on the pitch. Michael Estrada makes way.      5.35pm    73 min: Cody Gakpo runs on to a through ball, lifts it over the onrushing goalkeeper and watches as it bounces agonisingly wide of the far post. It wouldn\u2019t have counted as he was offside.      5.31pm    71 min: Cody Gakpo is penalised for a cynical shove on Estupinan, grounding the Ecuador man and conceding a free-kick far from his goal. Nothing comes of it.      5.30pm    70 min: Nathan Ake tries to run the ball out of the Dutch defence, is pressed by Enner Valencia, turns and plays the ball backwards.      5.29pm    69 min: Netherlands substitution: Steven Berghuis on for Davy Klaassen.      5.28pm    67 min: The Dutch enjoy a period of sustained possession and get the opportunity to take a breath, their first in a while. Not for the first time in this game, they\u2019ve spent several minutes on the ropes.   Updated at 5.35pm GMT    5.26pm    64 min: Nathan Ake sticks out a leg to prevent Estrada striking with any kind of conviction as the ball came his way from Estupinan, who is absolutely terrorising the Netherlands down the left wing. The shot is feeble and Noppert collects.      5.25pm    63 min: Van Dijk does well to control a bouncing ball and hoof it clear under pressure from Estrada as Ecuado attack on the counter. The Netherlands are shredding the nerves of their supporters here with some serious backs-to-the-wall defending against an Ecuador side whose tails are up.      5.23pm    62 min: Estupinan sends a cross into the Dutch penalty area which Daley Blind tries to hook clear while facing in his own goal with Moises Caicedo breathing down his neck. His clearance is unconvincing but will do.      5.21pm    61 min: The Dutch got away with a couple there, Van Dijk and then the woodwork coming to their recue in very quick succession.      5.20pm    59 min: Nothing comes of the Dutch free-kick and Ecuador work their way upfield again. The ball\u2019s pulled across the Dutch penalty area for Valencia, whose shot is blocked by Virgil van Dijk. The ball breaks to Gonzalo Plata, who curls a shot on to the upright!   Updated at 5.25pm GMT    5.18pm    57 min: Fouled by Piero Hincapie, Cody Gakpo wins a free-kick for the Netherlands. Jhegson Mendez is retrospectively booked for a foul on Depay in the build-up, the referee having played advantage. He\u2019ll miss Ecuador\u2019s next game as it\u2019s his second booking of the tournament.      5.16pm    54 min: Ecuador win a throw-in deep in Dutch territory. Preciado takes it, receives the return pass and links up with Valencia. The right wing-back is unable to keep the ball in play and it rolls out for a Dutch goal kick.      5.13pm    51 min: The Dutch players appealed for offside in the wake of that goal but to no avail. Nathan Ake was playing Valencia on as he followed up to equalise. It\u2019s difficult to blame Noppert for parrying the ball into his path as his one-handed save from Estupinan\u2019s low drive was quite sensational.      5.10pm   GOAL! Netherlands 1-1 Ecuador (Valencia 49)  Ecuador draw level! Estupinan\u2019s shot is saved brilliantly by a strong Noppert left hand but the goalkeeper can only parry the ball into the path of Enner Valencia, who smashes home from close range.   Updated at 5.13pm GMT    5.08pm    46 min: Ecuador win a free-kick just inside the Dutch half. Estupinan sends the ball to the edge of the Dutch penalty area, where his own team-mate Estrada heads clear for the opposition.      5.06pm   Second half: Netherlands 1-0 Ecuador  46 min: The second half kicks off and the Netherlands have made a change. Memphis Depay replaces Steven Bergwijn.  Updated at 5.06pm GMT    4.57pm    That disallowed goal. Ecuador took a corner. The ball was played to the near post, where Moises Caicedo played it away from goal , teeing up Angelo Preciado for a shot on goal. He fired from long range and his effort was diverted past Dutch goalkeeper Andries Noppert by Estupinan from the edge of the six yard box. Unfortunately for Ecuador, their defender Jackson Porozo was standing in an offside position directly in front of Noppert, blocking the goalkeeper\u2019s view of proceedings.      4.52pm   Half-time: Netherlands 1-0 Ecuador  Peep! Mustapha Ghorbal blows for half-time and walks off listening to a chorus of protests from several Ecuadorians. The Dutch lead courtesy of Cody Gakpo\u2019s fine strike in the sixth minute but certainly haven\u2019t had it all their own way. Ecuador have given them plenty to think about and thought they\u2019d equalised on the stroke of half-time, only to have Pervis Estupinan\u2019s shot ruled out for offside.    Updated at 4.53pm GMT    4.50pm   Ecuador have a goal disallowed ...  Oh my! From the corner Estupinan gets the ball into the Dutch goal and wheels away in celebration but his \u201cgoal\u201d is ruled out for offside. One of his team-mates was standing in front of the goalkeeper blocking his line of sight but we\u2019ll have time to get to the bottom of exactly what happened in a few moments.   Updated at 4.57pm GMT    4.48pm    45+ 2 min: Timbner fouls Estrada to give Ecuador a free-kick a long way out, wide on the left. Estupinan sends the ball into the penalty area and his delivery is excellent but Enner Valencia can only head wide under pressure. His effort goes out off a Dutch head and it\u2019s a corner for Ecuador.      4.46pm    45 min: Denzel Dumfries canters up the left flank and tries to play a one-two with Steven Bergwijn. Upon receiving the return pass he gets the ball caught under his feet and a promising move breaks down. We\u2019ll have three minutes of added time.      4.44pm    42 min: Frenkie De Jong advances upfield with the ball at his feet but is dispossessed by the diligently backtracking Gonzalo Plata before he can offload it.      4.42pm    40 min: Enner Valencia and Denzel Dumfries are having a running battle off the ball and get a jovial ticking-off from Algerian referee Mustapha Ghorbal, who let\u2019s them know he\u2019s keeping tabs on their shenanigans.      4.39pm    38 min: A long diagonal from Nathan Ake towards Steven Bergwijn causes Ecuador all sorts of problems at the back. Piero Hincapie ploughs through the Dutchman and puts the ball out for a throw-in but somehow doesn\u2019t concede a free-kick in a dangerous area.      4.37pm    36 min: \u201cWhat is with De Ligt not playing?\u201d asks Dechlan Brennan. \u201cInjury? Or has he simply not maintained his unbeatable status from a few years ago.\u201d  Well, he might be carrying a knock but I\u2019m guessing he was dropped because he played conspicuously badly against Senegal in his side\u2019s opening game.      4.35pm    33 min: Nothing comes of the set-piece and the Netherlands continue to lead courtesy of Cody Gakpo\u2019s beauty in the sixth minute. With each performance the PSV winger is adding to his value in what promises to be an interesting extremely tedious January bidding war for his signature.      4.33pm    32 min: Oof! Enner Valencia cuts in from the left and unleashes a rasping drive that Andries Noppert does well to keep out. The Dutch goalkeeper dives to his right and puts the ball out for a corner.      4.31pm    30 min: The ball\u2019s swung in from the corner flag, half-cleared by a defender and hoofed upfield for Enner Valencia to chase. Frenkie De Jong has a 20-yard head start on the Ecuador skipper and rolls the ball back to his goalkeeper Andries Noppert.      4.30pm    29 min: The Dutch seem to have weathered that five-minute Ecuadorian storm but have been left in no doubt that they are in a contest. They win themselves a corner.   Updated at 4.46pm GMT    4.29pm    26 min: It\u2019s taken a while but Ecuador have finally got a firm foothold in this game. They\u2019re attacking the Dutch relentlessly at the moment and a c ross from Valencia is helped across the penalty area courtesy of an Estrada back-heel. His no-look delivery is a little behind Angelo Preciado, who is unable to steer the ball goalwards.   Updated at 4.34pm GMT    4.26pm    24 min: Much, much better from Ecuador. They get forward again, with Estupinan\u2019s cross from the left forcing Virgil van Dijk to head the ball clear while facing his own goal under pressure from Michael Estrada.      4.24pm    23 min: Ecuador attack down the right and then the left. Moses Caicedo gets to the byline and pulls the ball back into the Dutch penalty area trying to pick out Enner Valencia. The Netherlands hack clear.      4.21pm    20 min: Dumfries wins possession in midfield and drives forward with the ball at his feet. With Pervis Estupinan hanging out of his shirt, he runs into the immovable object that is Ecuador central defender Felix Torres and crumples to the ground.      4.19pm    19 min: Denzel Dumfries takes a throw-in deep in Ecuador territory from which the Dutch win another. His second delivery is headed clear.      4.18pm    17 min: Nathan Ake runs the ball out of defence for the Netherlands, playing the ball to Davy Klaassen in midfield. He tries to keep it moving but Ecuador intercept.   Updated at 4.23pm GMT    4.16pm    14 min: Showing no ill effects from the knee injury he suffered on Monday, Enner Valencia advances down the left touchline at speed for Ecuador, holding off a defender. He ends up running the ball out of play for a goal kick.      4.13pm    13 min: The Netherlands players are all hustle and bustle, not giving their South American counterparts a moment to settle on the ball as they attempt to get out of their own half and get forward.      4.12pm    11 min: Ecuador free-kick, a long way out. The ball\u2019s played wide to Preciado, who sends it into the Dutch penalty area. It\u2019s headed across the face of the penalty area, half-cleared and breaks for Enner Valencia. His shot on the volley comes off the head of Virgil van Dijk.      4.10pm    8 min: A slightly shell-shocked Ecuador attempt to regain their composure after that early Dutch hammerblow, passing the ball around at the back. They venture out of their own half down by the halfway line only for Denzel Dumfries to nip in and put the ball out of play for a throw-in.      4.07pm    6 min: That\u2019s a terrific finish from the highly sought after Cody Gakpo, who curls a fizzing left-footed shot past Hernan Galindez into the top corner from outside the Ecuador penalty area after being teed up by Davy Klaassen. Ecuador\u2019s long run of over 11 hours without conceding comes to a very abrupt end.   Updated at 4.16pm GMT    4.05pm   GOAL! Netherlands 1-0 Ecuador (Gakpo 6)  Cody Gakpo fires the Netherlands ahead!   Updated at 4.40pm GMT    4.05pm    4 min: There\u2019s an early break in play as the referee takes pity on Angelo Preciado, the Ecuadorian right wing-back who is sitting on the ground after shipping a blow to his crown jewels and looking in serious pain.      4.03pm    3 min: The Netherlands dominate possession in these early stages, aiming to beat a team that has not conceded a goal in any of its past seven matches.      4.02pm    2 min: There\u2019s an excellent early interception from Piero Hincapie, who slides in to prevent Dutch defender Jurrien Timber from playing the ball down the inside right and in behind the Ecuador defence for Steven Bergwijn to chase.      4.01pm   Netherlands v Ecuador is go ...  1 min: Ecuador get the ball rolling, their players wearing navy shirts, white shorts and white socks. The players of the Netherlands wear all orange kit.      3.54pm    Not long now: Enner Valencia and Virgil van Dijk lead their teams out, following referee Mustapha Ghorbal and his team of match officials. They line up either side of the officials and it\u2019s time for the national anthems.   Updated at 4.15pm GMT    3.51pm         3.50pm    Group A Match report: Qatar 1-3 Senegal. Paul MacInnes was at Al Thumama Stadium to see Senegal leave the host nation\u2019s chances of advancing to the knockout stages hanging by an extremely frayed thread. Qatar now need Ecuador to beat the Netherlands or they will be reduced to playing against Louis van Gaal\u2019s side for nothing more than pride in their final group game.       3.25pm    Those teams: For the second match in a row, Memphis Depay starts on the Netherlands bench, his recovery from a hamstring injury apparently not fully complete. Louis van Gaal makes two changes, with Jurrien Timber and Teun Koopmeiners coming in for Mattihjs de Ligt and Steven Berghuis. Ecuador manager Gustavo Alfaro appears to be switching to a back five. He makes one change to the side that beat Qatar. Jackson Porozo comes in at centre-back while midfielder Romario Ibarra makes way.   Updated at 3.55pm GMT    3.08pm   Netherlands v Ecuador line-ups  Holland: Noppert, Timber, van Dijk, Ake, Dumfries, Koopmeiners, Frenkie de Jong, Blind, Klaassen, Gakpo, Bergwijn. Subs: Pasveer, de Ligt, de Vrij, Luuk de Jong, Depay, Berghuis, Lang, Bijlow, de Roon, Malacia, Janssen, Weghorst, Taylor, Simons, Frimpong. Ecuador: Galindez, Angelo Preciado, Porozo, Torres, Hincapie, Estupinan, Plata, Mendez, Caicedo, Estrada, Valencia. Subs: Arboleda, Cifuentes, Pacho, Gruezo, Ayrton Preciado, Ibarra, Ramirez, Arreaga, Mena, Sarmiento, Palacios, Franco, Dominguez, Reasco, Rodriguez.     3.01pm    Qatar 1-3 Senegal: It\u2019s all over in today\u2019s other group game and the African champions have won. Qatar will be eliminated if the Dutch avoid defeat in their game against Ecuador. Should the Dutch win by three goals or more, Senegal will need just one point from their final fixture against Ecuador to advance to the knockout stages.      2.48pm    Qatar v Senegal: Bamba Dieng puts Senegal 3-1 up against Qatar with just six minutes left on the clock. The jig looks up well and truly up for the hosts despite a much improved second half performance.  Updated at 2.48pm GMT    2.45pm   Key event  Qatar v Senegal: Mohammed Muntari has just come off the bench to score with a bullet header for Qatar against Senegal, reducing the host country\u2019s deficit in the game to one goal. They trail 2-1 with 10 minutes (and the rest) to go and need another goal or they will need several snookers to qualify for the knockout stages. Boulaye Dia and Famara Di\u00e9dhiou had put Senegal 2-0 up.   Updated at 3.02pm GMT    2.35pm    Gustavo Alfaro speaks: \u201cWe have everything to win and nothing to lose,\u201d said Ecuador\u2019s manager ahead of today\u2019s game. \u201cI\u2019m happy with my team. But Holland is a big rival. We have to be strong on all fronts, emotional and physical, and run them hard until they exit the pitch. What we did against Qatar will be insufficient against Holland or Senegal, we have to improve.\u201d      2.35pm    Louis van Gaal speaks: \u201cEcuador is a stable team,\u201d said the Netherlands manager in his pre-match press conference. \u201cThey\u2019re physically strong with very clever players, shrewd players, which is why I believe that they are tougher than Senegal.\u201d Asked about the OneLove armband campaign and if his team have any protests planned for today, Van Gaal had this to say. \u201c\u201cNo. We put a full stop after all the political issues past Thursday. We have this purpose and we\u2019re not going to have that tarnished by the actions of FIFA or whichever other organisation. But I\u2019ve already responded ... I think that\u2019s enough.\u201d      2.32pm    Today\u2019s match officials  Referee: Mustapha Ghorbal Assistant referees: Mokrane Gourari and Abdelhak Etchial Fourth Official: Said Martinez Video Assistant Referee: Shaun Evans       2.32pm   Early team news  Not deemed fit enough to start for the Netherlands against Senegal, Memphis Depay got 30 minutes off the bench and could start in place of Vincent Janssen today. Louis van Gaal is expected to field an otherwise unchanged starting line-up.  Forced off with a knee injury 15 minutes to go in his side\u2019s win over Qatar, two-goal hero Enner Valencia is expected to be fit to start for Ecuador. \u201cEnner will play against the Netherlands, there\u2019s no doubt about that,\u201d said his manager Gustavo Alfaro.       2.30pm   Group A: Netherlands v Ecuador  The Khalifa International Stadium is the venue for the second of today\u2019s Group A matches, where the Netherlands will take on Ecuador. Both sides won their opening games, with Ecuador recording a routine win against hosts Qatar in the tournament curtain-raiser, while the Netherlands left it late to see off Senegal a day later. Both sides will obviously fancy their chances of advancing to the knockout stages, particularly the Netherlands, who will face Qatar in their final group game. The host nation, who look the weakest team in the group by far, are currently losing against Senegal elsewhere in Doha and will have practically no chance of qualifying for the last 16 unless they can take something from the game. Kick-off at the Khalifa is at 4pm but stay tuned in the meantime for team news and build-up.  Updated at 3.02pm GMT "

                    "body": "STOP FOOTBALL? Queen Elizabeth II was not a huge football fan. That July 1966 afternoon, when Bobby Moore wiped himself down before shaking her gloved hand as she passed him the Jules Rimet trophy, was actually the last international football match she attended before the Euro 96 final. After 1966, it was left to the likes of the Duchess of Kent to hand out the trophies at Wembley until, latterly, Prince William, an unlikely but committed Aston Villa fan, became the royal family\u2019s football face, and eventually president of the FA. The family\u2019s association with football may have strengthened in recent years, but given much of the national mood, it still seemed a surprising move for the Premier League to lead the decision to stop football this weekend. \u201cTo honour her extraordinary life and contribution to the nation, and as a mark of respect, this Premier League match round will be postponed, including Monday evening\u2019s game,\u201d confirmed a statement. The Football League concurred, saying it was \u201caligned with the approach that the Premier League and the FA will take with their competitions this weekend\u201d. The WSL and Scottish football followed suit.  For many supporters the inconvenience will prove costly, with non-refundable flights, hotels and trains having to be written off. Casual workers \u2013 stadium staff, security, car-park stewards, swag sellers, burger flippers, even humble hacks \u2013 will lose out, too. It remains to be seen how the football authorities respond to the inevitable complaints, though breath ought not to be held. The FA\u2019s decision that all grassroots football would be cancelled also leaves kids, parents, and park/pub players kicking their heels this weekend. That Premiership Rugby goes ahead, the Oval Test resumes and the Great North Run starts only adds to the dismay, but beyond that righteous indignation, perhaps a moment of reflection, even from The Fiver. Among the late Queen\u2019s first year of engagements was her attending and presenting the trophy at the 1953 FA Cup final, the [Stanley] Matthews Final \u2013 Blackpool 4-3 Bolton \u2013 perhaps the greatest of all. Even if the Queen was no football fanatic, the span of her 70 years in which football has become almost unrecognisable from a time of 2-3-5, nailed-on studs and heavy, flannelette shirts reinforces her place in the game\u2019s history. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cWe believe football is at its finest when bringing people together at times of huge national significance \u2013 be those moments of joy or moments of mourning. Our view, which we shared with the football authorities, is that most supporters would have liked to go to games this weekend and pay their respect to the Queen alongside their fellow fans. Not everyone will agree, so there was no perfect decision for the football authorities, but many supporters will feel this was an opportunity missed for football to pay its own special tributes\u201d \u2013 the Football Supporters\u2019 Association argues that the British game has squandered an opportunity to pay tribute to the Queen. NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Shamrock Rovers have condemned their fans who engaged in \u201chighly insensitive and callous\u201d chants about the Queen\u2019s death, at the Europa Conference League game against Djurg\u00e5rden.  TalkSport have sidelined former player Trevor Sinclair from appearing on air for a tweet he posted in relation to the Queen\u2019s passing. Arsenal opened their Europa League campaign with a 2-1 win at FC Z\u00fcrich, with both teams observing a minute\u2019s silence for the Queen before the second half kicked off. Manchester United lost 1-0 at home to Real Sociedad in a sombre Europa League game at Old Trafford, while West Ham fought back to beat FCSB 3-1 amid a similar atmosphere in the Conference League match at the London Stadium. PSG are contemplating legal action after some of their supporters may have \u201cdamaged their reputation\u201d by getting involved in violent crowd trouble before the Conference League match between Nice and Cologne, in which 32 people were injured. Wales will host Bosnia-Herzegovina on 6 October in their Women\u2019s World Cup playoff semi-final, while Scotland are at home to Austria on the same date. Amnesty International has warned that staging the men\u2019s World Cup in Saudi Arabia would be \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d if Fifa applies its human rights criteria to any bid it makes, amid reports the country wants to host the men\u2019s 2030 tournament.

                    "body": "The most successful head coach in world sport right now lives in Pontefract and is not afraid to be different. \u201cI do a lot of things that a lot of other coaches don\u2019t do,\u201d says Simon Middleton, freely admitting he is not the type to pore over self-improvement manuals. \u201cI was sitting with some of the younger players at breakfast the other day talking about the last book we\u2019d read. I said: \u2018I think mine was Winnie the Pooh.\u2019 Maybe that helps explain why his team, England\u2019s all-conquering Red Roses, have racked up a record-breaking 25 consecutive Test victories. Simplicity alone does not win World Cups but overcomplication can be fatal. Middleton gives an embarrassed chuckle when asked if he has any tips for J\u00fcrgen Klopp or Pep Guardiola but any coach would love to bottle what he is currently brewing.  The checklist of positives is impressive with the Women\u2019s Rugby World Cup about to kick off in New Zealand next Saturday. A world-class squad full of inspiring leaders? Tick. A nice blend of youth, experience, power and pace? Tick. Pretty much the only thing Middleton\u2019s tournament favourites don\u2019t yet have is the actual World Cup, last hoisted by England in 2014. So what is his \u2013 and their \u2013 secret? Cynics will point to the Rugby Football Union\u2019s decision to offer full-time professional contracts in advance of any of their rivals. Even New Zealand were steamrollered on tour in the UK last year. Any coach, they argue, would look good with that kind of armchair ride. But hang on. No side wins 25 Tests in a row with muppets in charge. While Middleton\u2019s CV does include the disappointing 2017 World Cup final loss to the Black Ferns, he was named World Rugby\u2019s coach of the year in 2021. Unassuming and approachable, he is quick to delegate and his fingerprints are all over the shrewd backroom appointments that have underpinned the Red Roses\u2019 improvement. \u201cOne of the things I would say is a strength \u2013 and I\u2019ve got plenty of weaknesses \u2013 is that I think I\u2019m a pretty good judge of character,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople ask about my coaching philosophy. My coaching philosophy is: \u2018Get the right people around you. People who know how to do the job. And then get them aligned.\u2019 I know a lot of coaches who very much want to be in control of everything. I\u2019m not like that.\u201d A man coaching a women\u2019s team, however, does create some logistical issues. For obvious reasons he and his assistants, Louis Deacon and Scott Bemand, cannot loiter in an all-female dressing room before and after most games. \u201cThe changing room belongs to the players,\u201d Middleton says. \u201cOnce we get to the stadium we might go in to check the layout and feel the atmosphere, because it\u2019s match day for us as well. But then that\u2019s it. We\u2019ll go in at half-time but we don\u2019t go in at the end. Unless it\u2019s the end of a tournament, when we\u2019ll have a beer together.\u201d  For some that raises an obvious question: would it not be easier if the Red Roses\u2019 coach were female? Sarina Wiegman did a fabulous job in charge of the Lionesses at Euro 2022 and Middleton is among those who would like to see her \u2013 \u201cHow good would that be?\u201d \u2013 as a Premier League manager. So do his own players want a woman to succeed him? \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019d like to see a female coach and what Sarina has done clearly demonstrates that having the right person in the job \u2013 whether that\u2019s male or female \u2013 can get results. It\u2019s the best person for the job, that\u2019s what the players want.\u201d Ultimately it is probably less about sex and much more about empathy. Middleton, 56, may not be an avid reader but he knows what makes his players tick. \u201cPlayers don\u2019t respond to having a finger pointed at them and people shouting any more. I\u2019ve been that coach,\u201d he admits. \u201cWhen I first came into the England sevens programme I was very demanding. But society\u2019s changed. People want and deserve to be treated in a very different way to how they were even 10 years ago.\u201d Middleton has also had to be adaptable in life. Growing up in Knottingley, Wakefield, he started his working life in the local bottle factory. \u201cI literally finished my school exams in the morning and went straight there in the afternoon,\u201d he says. \u201cI mended the pallets they stuck the bottles on. My dad worked there, my mum worked there, one of my brothers worked there. It was just what you did.\u201d Slowly but surely, though, he worked his way up, gaining engineering qualifications and becoming a designer and project manager. Along the way the skinny, ginger-haired kid also became a late-blooming rugby league winger, swift enough to score 83 tries in 170 games for Castleford and share in a famous Regal Trophy final win over Wigan \u2013 Shaun Edwards, Andy Farrell, Jason Robinson et al \u2013 in 1994. \u201cI was playing opposite Jason Robinson and he scored a try just before half-time. They gave it offside but it wasn\u2019t. That changed the complexion of the game. We were just on it, everything came off.\u201d One of his best mates at Cas was Mike Ford and Middleton also learned plenty from the Australian coach Darryl van de Velde. Those years also taught him what ultimately wins rugby matches. \u201cMost of the people who play rugby league don\u2019t have a lot else to fall back on. The desperation those players play with is born out of that.\u201d When he was first invited into the England women\u2019s setup as a part-time defence coach by his friend Gary Street in 2010, he encountered a more laissez-faire vibe: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a bad attitude but it was a bit: \u2018Let\u2019s see how it goes.\u2019 That\u2019s not me. If you can play really well and win that\u2019s fantastic, but winning is the key bit. That\u2019s the be-all and end-all of international rugby.\u201d His outlook was also shaped by the day he was unexpectedly overlooked for a promotion to the head coach\u2019s seat at Leeds Tykes in 2011. \u201cThat was a pretty devastating moment,\u201d he says. \u201cSuddenly, having had two jobs most of my life, I didn\u2019t have one. You think: \u2018Right, you\u2019ve got two kids and a mortgage, you\u2019ve got to get your finger out of your arse and find a job.\u2019\u201d Luckily, fate intervened in the form of Jeanette Dawson, the principal of Bishop Burton College, whose director of rugby had just left when Middleton\u2019s CV landed on her desk. Having not previously worked in education, he was able to develop the people skills that have since proved invaluable. \u201cI\u2019m not superstitious but I do believe things happen for a reason,\u201d Middleton says. \u201cIf you keep an open mind and stay positive you\u2019ll make something happen. Those real hardship moments give you unbelievable confidence going through later life. Whatever happens, you can cope.\u201d  When the pressure cranks up in New Zealand, he genuinely believes England can soar to a rarefied peak. \u201cWe have lots of things that motivate us,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I would love for us to be referred to as the best team in the world, across any sport. I want people to talk about us like that \u2013 but we\u2019ll only get that if we win the World Cup.\u201d A huge opportunity also exists for the wider women\u2019s game as the Red Roses seek to emulate the England men of 2003 by winning a World Cup in the southern hemisphere. Clive Woodward was subsequently knighted, so how about Sir Simon Middleton? \u201cBelieve me, I\u2019d 100% settle for a World Cup.\u201d OK, but there must be an accolade he covets? \u201cWe\u2019ve got a castle in Pontefract. They might let me live in there.\u201d To borrow from Pooh\u2019s friend Piglet: \u201cThe things that make me different are the things that make me me.\u201d"

                    "body": "Gareth Southgate has been here before \u2013 in his nightmares at Molineux. Back in June, at the end of the 4-0 humiliation against Hungary, the England manager had ventured on to the pitch to applaud the home crowd. The boos that greeted him dripped with venom.\nAnd so to full time here. After Hungary at home; goodness, after the loss to Hungary away \u2013 plus the draws in between against Germany and Italy which had got this Nations League campaign off to such a bad start \u2013 it was a night when Southgate desperately needed a mood-changer, something to restore belief. Yet there would only be more frustration, more dead-ends, an absence of creative inspiration.\n\nAgain, Southgate went on to the playing surface when it was all over, he looked up at the travelling support and he applauded them. They poured forth abuse. They had seen little to give them encouragement and Southgate is the person to blame.\nItaly were deserved winners, condemning England to relegation to the second tier of the Nations League, the decisive moment coming towards the end when the fast rising star, Giacomo Raspadori, killed a high ball and felt Kyle Walker give him too much room.\nThe Napoli striker took a couple of touches to set himself, drifting further away from Walker before wrapping his right boot around a delicious curler that flew into the far corner. Raspadori only made his Italy debut in June. Already, he has four goals.\n\nWith the World Cup on the horizon in late November, England\u2019s slump has come at the worst time. The Nations League demotion stands to affect their Euro 2024 qualification draw. It will also see them play inferior opposition in the Nations League moving forward, reducing the chance to fine-tune against the best. But those issues feel incidental.\nThe big question concerns how Southgate and his players will recover before the opening World Cup tie against Iran, whether they can blot out the noise, the stifling narratives that are quickly building. Before that, there is Monday\u2019s final Nations League tie against Germany at Wembley, which has the look of an even more intimidating assignment. That is it.\nNever mind no wins in five \u2013 the worst such run since 2014 under Roy Hodgson \u2013 it is only one goal for England during the sequence and that was a Harry Kane penalty against Germany. There is one other team in the Nations League that have failed to score a goal in open play. It is San Marino.\n\nEngland had not beaten Italy away since 1961; Southgate brought it up in his press briefing on Thursday night. It was a challenge and his team thrived on overcoming them, he said. It also felt like a call for perspective. Italy might not have qualified again for the World Cup but, lads, it\u2019s Italy.\nThis Italy is a work in progress; not a team to terrify, despite it boasting the pedigree of Gianluigi Donnarumma, Leonardo Bonucci and Jorginho \u2013 plus flashes of emerging talent. The swathes of empty seats inside San Siro highlighted local indifference and, also, the on-going nightmare that is the nation\u2019s absence from Qatar.\nEngland struggled throughout the first half. They were jittery, their passing loose, plenty of their touches heavy. The distribution from the goalkeeper, Nick Pope, did not inspire confidence and it felt like a risky business going back to him but he was hardly alone in treating the ball like a hot coal. Phil Foden, playing off the right, was a rare comfort in possession.\n\nItaly snapped into tackles at the outset, pressuring England high up and getting some dangerous balls up the channels or across from the flanks. When Federico Dimarco dropped one to the far post, Gianluca Scamacca\u2019s header from a tight angle was clawed away by Pope. England would also enjoy a let-off later in the first-half when Raspadori fluffed his touch after a cut-back from the right. The home team tried to target the space behind Bukayo Saka at left wing-back.\nSouthgate had wanted to be progressive, despite the reversion to a back three. Hence the selections of Reece James at right wing-back and Saka, plus Jude Bellingham in midfield. Yet the attacking plan was woolly. Southgate would lament poor final decisions or executions. It sounded as though he was clutching at straws.\nEngland did not stretch Italy at all before the interval; they could not get behind them. Bonucci &amp; Co looked at ease. And it was not wildly different in the second half, despite a late push.\n\nJames lifted a well-placed free-kick wastefully over while Kane had an opportunity from a tight angle. He banged it at Donnarumma, who beat it back to him. Should Kane have squared? On the rebound, Kane blasted at Donnarumma again. Bellingham tried to drive forward and he would have a headed chance in stoppage time but it was thin gruel.\nItaly had threatened after half-time, Scamacca almost playing in Nicolo Barella only for an offside flag to go up. A Giovanni Di Lorenzo backheel nearly opened up England\u2019s defence and then Raspadori mined gold, his strike a beauty.\nSouthgate introduced Luke Shaw and Jack Grealish for Walker and Saka, switching to 4-2-3-1, Raheem Sterling as the No 10. It was not the formation that was the problem and Italy might have had a second. Pope denied the substitute, Manolo Gabbiadini, in a one-on-one while Dimarco\u2019s cross-cum-shot came back off the far post."

                    "body": "Gareth Southgate has dropped a strong hint that Kyle Walker will be fundamental to England\u2019s World Cup campaign, praising the Manchester City defender\u2019s leadership qualities and emphasising his influence. Walker has 67 caps and, at 32, is perhaps nearing the winter of his international career. He can operate on the right of a defensive three but faces competition from Reece James, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Kieran Trippier at right-back if Southgate goes with his preference of a back four in Qatar. The manager was asked about leaders within his squad and, unprompted, spoke of Walker in terms that suggested he will be hard to dislodge from any starting XI.  \u201cYou notice players maturing,\u201d he said. \u201cFor example Kyle Walker, who isn\u2019t captain of his club but is such a man within the group, on the pitch, off the pitch and I think he\u2019s matured a lot over the last two or three years. He\u2019s won the league four times so he\u2019s got confidence from what he\u2019s done as a player. He\u2019s been in a World Cup semi-final with us and a European final, so he\u2019s got a lot of big-match experience.\u201d Although his competitors are up to a decade younger, Walker\u2019s speed and athleticism have not waned. He was England\u2019s most impressive starter in last week\u2019s draw against Germany, playing at right-back, and Southgate pinpointed a moment from that night as an example of his qualities. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to be really vocal but [it\u2019s] his manner, his determination in the way he works,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a chance Germany had where Trippier got up at the far post and defended it really well but if you look at Walker, his desire to stop the cross, it means the guy\u2019s got to loft it rather than just be able to whip it in. \u201cThey are little things that the majority of the stadium probably don\u2019t give a second thought, but when you are looking at what wins football matches they are the things that win football matches. That hunger, that drive, he brings that; and he brings that on the training pitch.\u201d  Walker is likely to return to the lineup for Tuesday night\u2019s rematch with Hungary, who beat England in Budapest this month, at Molineux. Given England are winless from their past three games and without a goal from open play there would appear an added element of pressure, even before their position at the bottom of National League group A3 is accounted for. Relegation from the competition\u2019s top tier would mean they risk a tougher qualifying group for Euro 2024 but Southgate emphasised the short-term issue of managing his players\u2019 health had to be the priority in a gruelling schedule. \u201cThat [relegation] is another consideration within everything but it\u2019s not primary to me,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t want to do is put a team out, and we end up with a serious injury, and we\u2019ve lost a player for the World Cup because I\u2019ve put them in at the wrong time.\u201d Southgate feels that, while England have spluttered in the past 10 days, most of their rivals for the World Cup are in the same boat. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone around Europe is in that position where they will be really happy and thinking they are the standout favourites,\u201d he said.   Harry Kane will spearhead England after appearing from the bench against Hungary. Phil Foden has missed the past three matches due to Covid-19 and, although he is training, his return remains in doubt."

                    "body": "It\u2019s been another fine week for the people\u2019s game. The Super League Three \u2013 two of whom will probably be eliminated from the Champions League at the group stage despite the enormous advantages they enjoy both financially and via the coefficient system \u2013 continue to agitate for a competition that would make them even more money. Fans chant disgracefully about tragedy and find their club not merely not condemning them, but blaming the manager of the other side for having made an entirely reasonable observation about the financial advantages enjoyed by state-run clubs. That manager, on the very weekend local referees had gone on strike to highlight the abuse suffered by officials, is sent off for abusing an assistant referee. Team buses are attacked, social media becomes a battleground of the basest insults, managers who are the de facto agents of authoritarian states lecture others about touchline behaviour.  Preparations continue for a World Cup in a country whose human rights record remains highly questionable and which has imposed extraordinary restrictions on media covering the tournament. The schedule remains ludicrous. Before the World Cup in four weeks\u2019 time, there are still three rounds of the league, two of the Champions League and one of the EFL Cup to come. Injuries are already mounting and any further knocks in the next three weeks could rule a player out of the tournament. Fatigue and a lack of preparation time will almost certainly have a negative impact on the quality of football played in Qatar. One of the game\u2019s great stars storms off the bench in a huff, while another denies having threatened to leave because he wasn\u2019t being played in exactly the right way. Further details emerge of the chaos at the Champions League final. Uefa appears an increasingly shambolic body, beholden to the wealthiest clubs, unable to challenge the financial might of the elite clubs, unable even to stage football matches safely. The Swiss system the Champions League takes on from 2024 will be a mundane slog largely devoid of even the slight jeopardy still delivered by the present format.  Catastrophic inequality means most European leagues are effective monopolies. Florentino P\u00e9rez, the Real Madrid president, supposedly has evidence that young people are drifting away from the game (although he has never released it) but his proposed solution to that problem is to increase the inequality. Football hasn\u2019t quite gone the way of English cricket, disdaining its traditional audience in the lust for growth, but with three-quarters of Premier League clubs owned overseas, nothing is certain. Arrests at Premier League games are up 68.5% on pre-Covid times. Costs are becoming prohibitive. And the collapsing West Coast mainline means that, in England at least, it\u2019s almost impossible even to get to certain games, the grim mantra falling softly over the waste land: Avanti, Avanti, Avanti. So what then to do, if the status quo is unappealing and the future apparently worse? Bernd Reichart, the new CEO of the company backing the Super League is clearly on a mission to charm after the disastrous attempt to launch the competition in April 2021. \u201cWe want to reach out to stakeholders in the European football community and broaden this vision,\u201d he says. \u201cEven fans will have a lot of sympathy for the idea. It is a blank slate. Format will never be an obstacle.\u201d That \u201ceven\u201d before \u201cfans\u201d raises immediate concerns \u2013 what, you\u2019re actually going to consult the people who watch your product? My, how you indulge us \u2013 but let\u2019s take him at his word. If there were a fresh start, how would we build football? It\u2019s easy to complain, far harder to lay out a blueprint. What are the first principles? What should football at its most basic level be?  And that, perhaps is not such a difficult question to answer. A competition, ideally, as the word suggests, would be competitive. Does anybody doubt that? Does anybody really derive satisfaction from watching some superclub stroll up and smash half a dozen past some patsies every week? Teams should be rewarded for success, but not to such an extent that their domination becomes permanent. Every game should be a challenge; every team should be able to dream that, one day, with a fair wind, they could at least challenge somewhere near the top. That means one of two things: either a closed system and a franchise model, which cuts against the sense of a club as an organic part of its environment, the democratic spirit of English football that meant a Huddersfield, a Burnley or an Ipswich could take on the big city clubs; or some proper form of redistribution \u2013 as existed until 1981. But that would require elite clubs to consider the game as a whole, and it\u2019s a long time since anybody in football thought about anything beyond their own interests. Measures to restrict spending \u2013 salary caps and financial fair play regulations \u2013 have proved essentially unworkable, not least because they are effectively unenforceable when clubs have such wealth they can stymie investigations with endless legal challenges. You would almost certainly want some fan representation on the board, with a golden share to prevent the takeover of clubs by those whose primary concern is not the health of the game \u2013 although given the way fans race to prostrate themselves before the nearest passing billionaire, desperate to sign over their birthright for new signings, suggests that is no guarantee of anything. Because the problem is that nobody sees football as a sport any more. It is a business, it is an entertainment product, it is content. Some clubs plot Entourage-style dramas around their daily affairs, while others seem to value social media engagements above matches or trophies won. Everything is about money and greed and growth, the game itself, or the club\u2019s place in its community, an afterthought. But football isn\u2019t, at heart, either a business or an entertainment. It certainly shouldn\u2019t be a tool of state propaganda. It is a sport and, until that is remembered and prioritised, it\u2019s hard to have any hope for the future. Or, indeed, the present."

                    "body": "Brentford did to Manchester City precisely what the champions did to Fulham here last week with a breathtaking smash-and-grab win in added time, Ivan Toney\u2019s 98th-minute strike ending City\u2019s sequence of 16 consecutive home victories. For Toney this was sweet: two days after being omitted from Gareth Southgate\u2019s World Cup squad the centre-forward raced into City\u2019s area to roll home his second goal of the game from Josh Dasilva\u2019s cross and seal the champions\u2019 defeat. The result means Arsenal will be top at Christmas.  Despite Pep Guardiola sending out an XI containing 10 players who will touch down in Qatar, Brentford proved unbending opponents. Their main ploys were to hit City on the break or in the air and the latter was how Thomas Frank\u2019s men scored first, Toney heading home after Aymeric Laporte inadvertently touched the ball on to him. Toney\u2019s opener was cancelled out by a Phil Foden rocket just before the break and City had a slew of penalty claims \u2013 mainly for handball \u2013 which were all turned down by the VAR. Yet, though the champions dominated, they were never at their finely tuned best, the failure to create enough for Erling Haaland \u2013 who did managed a single shot on target \u2013 or anyone else leaving them unable to secure the desired result.  Guardiola\u2019s decision to introduce only Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez to shake the contest up from the bench was odd given Riyad Mahrez is a game-changer and Jack Grealish in flying form. The entertainment began instantly when Rico Henry played in Frank Onyeka, his pace too much for John Stones, who watched as Ederson, rushing out, made a low save. Henry then burst down the left and put in a cross that Ederson tipped on to Bryan Mbeumo who squared to Toney. The striker smashed it close to City\u2019s No 1, who dived to save his team. Duly provoked, Guardiola\u2019s men asserted themselves. Kevin De Bruyne scooped the ball to David Raya\u2019s back post where Haaland, making a first start in three weeks after an ankle injury, leapt and turned the ball back in. Brentford cleared for a corner which, taken by Foden on the left, eventually had Raya saving from Haaland. Raya then played a vital role in the opener. The keeper\u2019s long free-kick from his half was flicked on by Ben Mee \u2013 Manuel Akanji might have challenged him more strongly \u2013 and Toney, jumping against Laporte, headed past Ederson. Game was squarely on between the home winning machine and the division\u2019s draw specialists. It brought Guardiola to the technical area from where he saw Foden and Rodri have shots blocked and a dazzling sequence that had Jo\u00e3o Cancelo, De Bruyne, Foden and Haaland exchanging possession with balletic poise. What happened next was helter-skelter. Bernardo Silva\u2019s chip was handballed by Henry and a cry went up for a penalty. VAR said no: the left-back\u2019s feet were out of the area, the offending arm difficult to judge. The free-kick given by Peter Bankes stood, which De Bruyne took and, when Haaland clashed with Mee, the No 9 went down \u2013 another penalty claim - before the ball ricocheted off Rodri to De Bruyne who hit the turf with Henry again in attendance. VAR check was not interested \u2013 the Belgian did appear theatrical \u2013 but Brentford were hanging on. Yet another handball shout \u2013 this time after Ilkay G\u00fcndogan\u2019s effort \u2013 was then rejected at Stockley Park. For all this a Foden laser repelled by Raya was City\u2019s first attempt on target, 41 minutes in. It reflected how Guardiola\u2019s men were hitting discordant notes, not least when City broke and Haaland galloped 70 yards to Brentford\u2019s area, only for Foden to send his cross too high. But, as the interval neared, the youngster levelled: a De Bruyne corner dropped to him and Foden\u2019s left-foot volley was a picture of perfection. Finally 74% possession had yielded a City goal. After the break came a lengthy pause to treat a Laporte head injury: the added time was taken advantage of perfectly by Toney at the end."

                    "body": "The first thing to do in conversation with Alan Gilpin, chief executive of World Rugby, the day after an extraordinary World Cup play-off is to celebrate Chile, qualifiers for the first time after beating the USA 31-29 in Colorado, 52-51 on aggregate.  \u201cCongratulations to them,\u201d Gilpin says. \u201cThey\u2019ve pulled together an incredibly committed, passionate team who believe in each other and were able to really hang in at times against a very good Eagles side. \u201cI think that\u2019s a tribute to the work that the South American unions have done in their SLAR [S\u00faperliga Americana de Rugby] competition that\u2019s provided them in the last two years the platform to do what we\u2019ve seen across this qualification campaign.\u201d Los C\u00f3ndores put Canada out then sent the Eagles, first beaten by Uruguay, to the brink of missing France next year. Gilpin says: \u201cTo have Uruguay and Chile qualify is is a huge step forward for South American rugby and a huge step forward for rugby in Chile and they have an opportunity to inspire a lot more kids to play, which is fantastic.\u201d Chile will face continental rivals Argentina in Pool D \u2013 as well as England, Japan and Samoa. The next order of business is to consider the impact of Chile\u2019s victory on US rugby. The Eagles won the first qualifier 22-21, in a deluge on a Santiago mud-heap. Most thought they would seal qualification. Gilpin arrived in the Denver suburbs with plenty to do regarding the decision, announced in May, to play the 2031 men\u2019s World Cup and 2033 women\u2019s event on American soil. Gary Gold\u2019s Eagles were shattered by their last-gasp defeat. So were their followers across America. The US men have only missed one World Cup, South Africa 1995. Thanks to Francois Pienaar and Nelson Mandela that was one for the history books and Hollywood. World Rugby wants to have the sort of effect the 1994 World Cup had on American soccer. No US team in France next year? Tricky. Does World Rugby \u2013 and the world of rugby \u2013 need the US to make it through the final qualification tournament for a World Cup place? \u201cI don\u2019t think the game needs the US in France next year. I think the US plan will benefit significantly from the US being in France. \u201cBut when we look more broadly, the US are about to have to two very credible teams playing the Sevens World Cup in Cape Town \u2026 we\u2019ve got the LA Sevens just prior to that. You\u2019ve got a US women\u2019s team going to New Zealand to play in the Women\u2019s World Cup. \u201cThe men\u2019s 15s challenge is a much bigger high-performance challenge.\u201d  Gold\u2019s Eagles do not have regular time together. Some play in Europe, many play in Major League Rugby. The US league has just finished its fifth season but domestic talent is relatively thin. Voices within MLR say that as a private business looking to survive and expand, its first duty is to its own health, not to the production of American players. In Saturday\u2019s World Cup playoff in Colorado a team built from 13 MLR franchises and overseas pros went down to a team almost entirely from one pro outfit, Selknam, which competes in SLAR.  Is the production of American talent a problem World Rugby wants fixed? \u201cIt is. We spent a lot of time working with USA Rugby on \u2018What does a future growth plan look like\u2019 and awarding Rugby World Cups men\u2019s and women\u2019s to the US for 2031 and \u201933 was always going to be part of a much broader plan, a 10-year plan to grow the sport in the US and that\u2019s incredibly multifaceted, as you can imagine. \u201cThat\u2019s looking at everything from the relationships the game has at youth and high-school level through to what\u2019s the college rugby opportunity and what does that mean for the sport. And beyond that the club infrastructure and into professional domestic rugby and at the moment that\u2019s Major League Rugby and \u2026 that\u2019s not providing a pathway that is being successful for US-qualified players. \u201cThe Major League Rugby ownership group are well aware of that and there\u2019s been some good discussions about how USA Rugby, Rugby Canada and MLR can be better aligned in those regards. But you know that that\u2019s a balance between the North American professional franchise league model, it\u2019s a business, and what we all want to see, high-performance pathways for the international teams.\u201d Gilpin says the Americas Rugby Championship, in which the US beat Chile between 2016 and 2019, is not due to return but plans are \u201cquite advanced\u201d for an \u201cAsia Pacific Americas competition that will see USA, Canada, Chile, Uruguay, Argentina etc playing regularly\u201d. Lower-tier nations are also due to get more meaningful games as part of the long-gestating reorganisation of the Test year. Gilpin says the women\u2019s game may provide another model, as \u201cthe women\u2019s US team are benefiting from the fact that the core of that team are playing together regularly, albeit in a semi-professional competition overseas\u201d, in England, where Alev Kelter plays for Saracens, Kate Zackary for Exeter and so on. Other approaches have seen South American teams play in the Currie Cup and the Fijian Drua play in Australian domestic rugby before entering Super Rugby this year. \u201cWe can really see the benefit\u201d of such work, Gilpin says. \u201cSo that\u2019s maybe a guide to what we need to do with some of the best of US talent, that young talent coming through, is concentrate them in a few places where they can really become a team. And I think that\u2019s what we saw with Chile.\u201d Only one member of Chile\u2019s starting XV in Colorado \u2013 and two on the eight-man bench \u2013 did not play for Selknam in SLAR. As Gilpin says: \u201cThese guys have played together a lot and when they were 19 points down early on, they didn\u2019t panic. They believed in each other.\u201d To reach France, the US must win the final qualification tournament in Dubai in November, against Portugal, Kenya and in all probability Hong Kong, who face a tough play-off with Tonga this weekend.  The US have the highest world ranking and should expect to win the round-robin. But Gilpin offers a warning. \u201cPortugal are a good side. And they have echoes of what Chile have just done. Portugal have the Lusitanos in Super Cup, which we also funded and it\u2019s interesting: that performance model is really working.\u201d  The Rugby Europe Super Cup, below the main European club competitions, features teams from Georgia (two), Romania, Israel, Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands and Belgium. Lusitanos made this year\u2019s final, losing to Black Lion of Georgia. The Lusitanos squad is entirely Portuguese, boosting the national team. \u201cSo they have a lot of time together. They\u2019ll play a very, very similar game to Chile.\u201d The Eagles stand advised. \u201cIt will be a great achievement for the US to qualify for France next year,\u201d Gilpin says. \u201cI think that\u2019ll be a big boost. But I don\u2019t think it changes what we need to do in the next five, six, seven, eight or nine years\u201d before the World Cup comes to town. "

In Shakespeare\u2019s Henry V, the King tells Fluellen that he is wearing a leek \u201cfor I am Welsh, you know, good countryman\u201d. But it probably goes back way further. To Saint David himself? That\u2019s right. One legend has the patron saint of Wales, who died in AD589, ordering his soldiers to wear leeks in their helmets, in a battle against pagan Saxon invaders. But the relationship probably predates even that, to a time when druids worshipped nature and plants and \u2026 \u2026 and tall white and green vegetables of the onion family. OK, got it, Wales and leeks have a thing. But what about daffodils? Also daffodils. Never mind them, though, this is about leeks! What\u2019s new? They can now be officially Welsh. Meaning? Welsh leeks are the latest addition to the UK geographical indication (GI) scheme, which protects the name, authenticity and characteristics of regional products. So you\u2019ll know you\u2019re getting \u201cthe real thing\u201d. I thought that was Coca-Cola, from the US? Be quiet. Also, you\u2019re showing your age. What else is on the GI scheme? Ninety-two products in total, including Welsh lamb, Cornish clotted cream, Melton Mowbray pork pies, stilton cheese, Jersey Royal potatoes, Arbroath smokies \u2026 Scottish deep-fried Mars bars? Stop it. How will I know the leeks I\u2019m buying are from Wales? There will be a logo on the label. But will I be able to tell the difference between a leek from Wales and one from \u2026 I don\u2019t know, the town of Leek, in Staffordshire, perhaps? There is no specific variety in Wales, but Welsh leeks, which are grown on stony soil, including in coastal areas, are known for their long dark green leaves, and their distinctive pepperiness. I\u2019d love to know what Aled Jones said. \u201cWe\u2019re walking in the air\u201d?  No, not that one. Also, you\u2019re showing your age now. Sorry, you mean Aled Jones, the president of National Farmers Union Cymru. He said: \u201cWe are thrilled that Welsh leeks have been granted the GI status. The leek has long been synonymous with Wales and it is fitting that its distinctive look, taste and flavour have now been recognised and protected.\u201d Hurrah! And we\u2019ve done well to avoid any lame and predictable leek/leak puns. Hold my Kentish strong ale. Do say: \u201cMmm, this cawl is yummy. So deliciously and distinctively peppery.

                    "body": "Moeen Ali has dismissed concerns about Ben Stokes\u2019s batting form as the T20 World Cup approaches. Moeen believes England\u2019s red-ball captain, who has yet to make it to double figures or to score at more than a run a ball during the warm-up series against Australia, contributes so much in the field that he deserves his place in the side anyway. Stokes retired from ODI cricket in July, citing the workload of playing all three formats and was named in the World Cup squad despite not playing a T20 international for more than 18 months. He has bowled two overs in each of England\u2019s first two games against Australia \u2013 the last time he bowled his full allocation of four was against South Africa in February 2020 \u2013 but in the team\u2019s most recent match, in Canberra on Wednesday, opened the bowling for the first time in his career. He also produced a jaw-dropping moment of fielding brilliance to turn a Mitchell Marsh shot from a six into a two.  \u201cI think when the big games come he\u2019ll score runs and that\u2019s what you want from your gun players,\u201d Moeen said. \u201cBen offers so much even if he\u2019s not scoring runs \u2013 he opened the bowling, bowled really well and was brilliant in the field. That effort [to save four runs] was amazing. \u201cI don\u2019t care if Ben doesn\u2019t score any runs in the next couple of games because once the World Cup comes I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be fine. Even if he doesn\u2019t score runs he\u2019s a great player to have in your team.\u201d Moeen, who captained the side during their recent 4-3 series win in Pakistan while Jos Buttler was recovering from injury, said the decision to open the bowling with Stokes demonstrated Buttler\u2019s tactical flexibility. \u201cThat\u2019s the good thing about Jos. Under Morgs [Eoin Morgan] everything was a lot more structured,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s a great captain, but Jos is finding out what he can do with the side and [how to] make it a better team than it was. \u201cIn the last two games since Jos has been back he\u2019s captained exceptionally well in tough games. To defend in Australia twice already is great for him and the team. He\u2019s very open-minded as a captain, he\u2019s always thinking outside the box and that\u2019s the great thing. It might not always come off but to become a better team we need that, and he\u2019s got a fantastic cricket brain.\u201d  Moeen scored 44 off 27 in Wednesday\u2019s game and put together a crucial 92-run partnership with Dawid Malan, who top-scored with 82 off 49. This has been a difficult week for Malan, who lost his full central contract on Tuesday, but he produced a timely reminder of his quality. \u201cPeople don\u2019t give him the credit because we have such explosive players, but the guy\u2019s special,\u201d Moeen said. \u201cHe\u2019s been the world No 1 player and I feel people are on his back at times for no reason. He always scores runs and he scores them quickly. He\u2019s a great player and he\u2019s underestimated massively. I know people give him stick for starting slow but his strike rate has always been excellent.\u201d England go into the final game of the series on Friday having won six of their past seven T20s against Australia, with their latest success all the sweeter for coming against a full-strength side, after five key players missed Sunday\u2019s opening encounter in Perth. \u201cIt gives us a lot of confidence because they\u2019ve played their strongest bowling attack,\u201d Moeen said, \u201cand to score 178 after being 54 for four is really good for the confidence.\u201d The 35-year-old said there was no feeling of having an edge over the World Cup hosts and on Thursday the Australian bowler Josh Hazlewood said he was confident his side will raise their game when the teams meet again in a fortnight during the tournament. \u201cOnce you get to a World Cup, where every game is so significant, we\u2019re quite comfortable with where we\u2019re at and producing a big game on the night,\u201d Hazlewood said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got the wood over us in the last few series. They\u2019re a quality outfit and I still think they\u2019re pretty close to the benchmark.\u201d"

                    "body": "Britain\u2019s chances of an improbable run on home soil at the Billie Jean King Cup Finals took a significant blow on Tuesday night as they were outmatched by a strong Kazakhstan team, falling 2-1 in their first tie at the Emirates Arena in Glasgow. In the opening encounter, Yulia Putintseva recovered from a set down before beating Katie Boulter and easing through 4-6, 6-3, 6-2. Elena Rybakina then put the tie to bed with ease, overpowering Harriet Dart 6-1, 6-4 and marking her return to Britain for the first time since winning Wimbledon with a victory. In their first BJK Cup appearance, Alicia Barnett and Olivia Nicholls registered a win for GB in the doubles dead rubber, beating Rybakina and Anna Danilina 7-5, 6-3.  \u201cIt ended, I guess, better than I would have hoped for,\u201d said Anne Keothavong, the GB captain. \u201cAfter the singles matches, obviously there is the natural disappointment, because we have lost the overall tie against Kazakhstan.\u201d Of the two singles rubbers, the first match between the two second-ranked players always presented the bigger chance for Britain. Putintseva began as the clear favourite, but Boulter has built a reputation for rising to the bigger occasions at home. She arrived in Glasgow with a 9-1 win-loss record in the BJK Cup, a tight three-set loss to Putintseva her only defeat. Boulter started confidently, restricting Putintseva with her greater weight of shot. But Putintseva slowly began to dig in and impose herself. She tested Boulter\u2019s rally tolerance with the long exchanges that followed and she exposed her movement, peppering Boulter with drop shots and prodding her from side to side. From the middle of the second set, Putintseva took control of the match and comfortably moved to victory. Since breaking through to win her first grand slam title at Wimbledon, Rybakina\u2019s progress has not been entirely smooth but she played an excellent match on Tuesday night. From the beginning, she served well and hammered the ball from inside the baseline. Despite fighting hard to stay in touch throughout the second set, Dart simply did not have sufficient weight of shot to keep up. Glasgow marks the second year of the Billie Jean King Cup under its new \u201cfinals\u201d knockout format, with 12 nations convening in one city rather than the traditional home and away ties. The opening day was an underwhelming spectacle, with the home team attracting a sparse, tepid crowd at the Emirates Arena. The defeat leaves Britain in a difficult position. They will face a Spanish team headed by the world No 13 Paula Badosa on Thursday, needing a win to give themselves a chance of advancing to the semi-final from Group C. However, Kazakhstan and Spain play each other on Wednesday and a second win for Kazakhstan would knock Britain out before they return to the court. Keothavong added: \u201cRegardless, what will be will be tomorrow, and we will prepare in the right way for Spain. Look, you see, just even today, we lost the match against Kazakhstan after the first two singles match, but that didn\u2019t stop anyone\u2019s energy levels to rise to the challenge of taking out the doubles team.\u201d"

                    "body": "  9.57am    Thank you so much for joining me for this quarter-final! Wales put up a great fight but the might of New Zealand is too much and the hosts and defending champions march on. Portia Woodman shone but the entire Black Ferns squad displayed they are more than up for the challenge of retaining their title. New Zealand will face France in the semi-final next weekend but to catch up with all the action from this one, read the report below! I will catch you early morning tomorrow, the coverage here starting at 12.30am BST, for England\u2019s quarter-final against Australia! Until then, have a great Saturday.      9.49am    New Zealand\u2019s Ruby Tui told ITV: \u201cIt is more fun than it looks. The team has been through so much and we want to show New Zealand and the world that women\u2019s rugby is [a great product]. \u201cThere was hype but we had too many TikToks I swear. We had breakfast this morning and I said if I could pick any wingers to play with I would pick them. It was pretty bloody special tonight. On the semi: \u201cNot hard? Did you not see those tackle I was taking? What we are learning from the coaches, I have never looked at the game like this before. England and France have been leading the way and I wouldn\u2019t want to be facing anyone else. An absolute honour.\u201d     9.45am    New Zealand are competing at their seventh World Cup and have just secured their sixth semi-final, it\u2019s their stage.     9.40am    The scheduling clash has stolen the headlines in the build-up to this quarter-final and it was the Black Ferns who had the more thrilling match. They crushed Wales and the All Blacks only just beat Japan.      9.36am    Wales head coach Ioan Cunningham told ITV: \u201cIt is still fairly big, the scoreboard doesn\u2019t lie. The intensity they can play at for 80 minutes is [impressive]. \u201cI am really proud of the effort though. We came here to try and get out of the pool and we achieved that. We probably let the Australia game go but so chuffed to get the quarter-final. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely special\u2026 we are changing the lives of some of these people.\u201d     9.35am    Portia Woodman made 122 metres in the quarter-final as well as two tries which took her to the most tries scored in Rugby World Cup history, what a player New Zealand have in their locker!      9.30am    New Zealand player Kennedy Simon said: \u201cIt\u2019s an extreme privilege [to reach the semi-finals]. We have a legacy to uphold and advance.  And on the motivation for the performances she added: \u201cFirst and foremost it\u2019s the black jersey. To come out here to see our supporters and families in the crowd it is [what matters].\u201d     9.28am    Wales captain Hannah Jones told ITV: \u201cThe side they brought out tonight is outstanding. I couldn\u2019t have asked more from the girls, we showed our best. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been professional for long, we are building for the future.\u201d     9.27am    The score would and could have been a lot higher for New Zealand but Wales did do well in defence despite the scoreboard. They can hold their heads high, their performance has improved so much since becoming professional earlier this year.     9.23am   Full-time: New Zealand 55-3 Wales  The favourites have crushed Wales with not only fantastic and versatile attack but clinical defence. Wales unable to throw an attacking punch and they are out of the World Cup. It will be a New Zealand v France semi-final, what a match that will be!     9.22am    80 min: New Zealand do well to win it back and they want more here as they attack. Wales turn it over though! What can they do here, they aren\u2019t wanting this one to end as they attempt to attack. Woodman picks it up though and they steam to the line.     9.19am    78 min: The referee has a word with both captains as both teams are having afters off the ball and this time it is H Jones and Connor who push and shove. Wales have a scrum and despite a huge New Zealand shove the visitors come away with it.     9.18am    77 min: Wales go short at the line-out and Joyce hesitates as New Zealand\u2019s defence fronts up. Tui gives away a penalty and Wales kicks to the stands once again. They win the line-out and go forwards. Woodman knocks on after Wales kick away.     9.15am    75 min: Wales have the scrum and they come away with it. ITV had said Wales were targeting four tries in this match, cannot confirm if that is true, but they are yet to score. Wales do win the breakdown pen and they kick into the stands.     9.13am    74 min: Wales\u2019 defence is still fighting tooth and nail and it comes off for them as Tubic\u2019s pass is forward. There\u2019s a break in play as Jones receives treatment.     9.12am    73 min: There\u2019s a rare mistake from this New Zealand back three with a forward pass and Wales have the scrum. A huge shove from New Zealand sees them win the scrum penalty and the Black Ferns are off once more.      9.10am    71 min: Williams-Morris is back on for Wales after her sinbinning. Neumann collects a cross field kick and wins the penalty at the breakdown. Lewis punts the ball into the stands, they will want a try from this one. But they aren\u2019t straight at the line-out and they knock on.     9.07am   TRY! New Zealand 55-3 Wales (Demant, 68')  That is clinical but with Wales down by so many it isn\u2019t surprising. Demant makes a great line to slice through. Holmes misses the conversion.  Updated at 9.08am BST    9.06am    68 min: Tuipulotu is on for Rose as Wales make another change. Here come New Zealand again.     9.06am   YELLOW CARD! New Zealand 50-3 Wales (George 67')  George' deliberately knocks on and Wales are down another player     9.03am   TRY! New Zealand 50 -3 Wales (Connor, 65')  Connor pounces again after the back three propels the Black Ferns once more. Holmes is now the kicker but she misses.  Updated at 9.04am BST    9.02am    64 min: Webb is coming off for Wales and with no more players on the bench Wales are a player down. Fluhler is off for Tubic \u2013 a tactical change \u2013 and Mikaele-Tu\u2019u remains on. Tui has a great break and they are just metres away.     8.59am    63 min: George kicks away and New Zealand decide to run it rather than clear their lines with a kick. The Black Ferns knock on through Roos and it is her last action as she is replaced with Rule also coming off. New Zealand turn it over after the scrum and they aren\u2019t done scoring in this one. A break in play as Webb is down again and Mikaele-Tu\u2019u also receives treatment. The attendance has also been confirmed as 16,834.     8.56am    61 min: Demant kicks to clear their lines after that yellow card. Webb has stayed on after receiving treatment by the way. Wales win the ball though and they have a shot to attack. They are running through the phases here, this is the best attacking spell they have had.     8.53am   YELLOW CARD! New Zealand 45-3 Wales (Williams-Morris,59')  Williams-Morris has tackled Tui off the ball but the referee is happy with the timing. But it\u2019s the lift and where Tui lands, the full-back seems to land on her shoulder/head. It is the landing which sees her in the bin for 10.  Updated at 9.12am BST    8.51am    59 min: Cocksedge is off with Bayler on. And Wales have made changes with Snowsill and Norkett off. There\u2019s a break in play as a Wales player is down injured, it\u2019s Megan Webb who just came on. We are also heading to the TMO for a tackle on Tui.      8.47am   TRY! New Zealand 45-3 Wales (Bremner, 56')  New Zealand employ the whole team to run the ball through the hands with Bremner catching a long range pass. Demant misses the conversion.   Updated at 9.13am BST    8.47am    55 min: Wales are in attack and they will be desperate to get a try on the board, they do deserve more on the scoreboard for their performance. A loose Wales pass though is stolen by Fluhler on the floor. Here we go again \u2026     8.45am    53 min: Stacey Fluhler makes a great break and puts in a cracking long range pass but Woodman can\u2019t pick it up, so close to another score there. New Zealand make another change as Leti-I\u2019iga is off, I didn\u2019t catch who replaced her but as soon as I know I shall let you know.     8.43am    52 min: The scoreline may not tell the story but Wales have had a good performance in this match and as I type that they turn over the ball! New Zealand manage to wrestle it back and kick with Leti-I\u2019iga chasing but Joyce comes away with it. Wales kick away, Tui collects and her pass is out of play. New Zealand make another change as Hirini is off for Kennedy Simon.     8.39am   TRY! New Zealand 40-3 Wales (Connor, 49')  New Zealand take it quickly and the replacement has the try! Demant kicks the extras, the fly-half has only missed one kick this match.   Updated at 9.12am BST    8.38am    48 min: New Zealand make their first changes as Georgia Ponsonby is off for Luka Connor. The hosts come away with the ball at the line-out but Wales do really well to turn it over to prevent another score. Wales scrum but it is torn to shreds by New Zealand, what a shove from the hosts!     8.36am    46 min: Here they come again, it is relentless for Wales defence right now. New Zealand win the penalty and they kick to the corner.     8.33am   TRY! New Zealand 33-3 Wales (Woodman, 43')  New Zealand manage to turn it over at the break down and the hosts come forward once more. And who else converts but Woodman? She is now the all-time leading try scorer in women\u2019s Rugby World Cup history.  Updated at 9.10am BST    8.32am    42 min: Joyce does well to pick up a tricky pass as they start this second 40 in attack. Wales spill the ball but Tui\u2019s kick sees the visitors pick it up again. It would be great to see Wales score a try in this one.     8.30am   Back underway! New Zealand 26-3 Wales  The second half has begun! Will New Zealand running away with this? Or can Wales get back into this.     8.25am    Let\u2019s revisit the haka which was emotional ahead of kick-off:      8.20am    Just look at this skill from Woodman. She has been everywhere for New Zealand so far, including scoring a try. The score saw her equal this tournament\u2019s top scorer table but also hit the same amount of tries in women\u2019s Rugby World Cup history! Woodman has only played eight RWC matches yet has 19 tries, a crazy stat.      8.15am   Half-time: New Zealand 26-3 Wales  Well it was impressive early defence from Wales but New Zealand have four tries. Portia Woodman, Ruby Tui, Sarah Hirini and Amy Rule crashing over to put the hosts in firm control.     8.14am    40 min: I think it is fair to call New Zealand ruthless, particularly through Woodman and Tui right now. It is hard to see Wales coming back from this scoreline.     8.13am   TRY! New Zealand 26-3 Wales (Rule, 39')  New Zealand win the line-out but only just and Woodman makes a phenomenal break. That is sensational from the winger, they run through the phases and Amy Rule is over. Demant has the extras.  Updated at 9.10am BST    8.10am    37 min: Demant should have offloaded there with so many teammates out on the wing but she takes it into contact and Wales turn it over. Snowsill clears their lines and there is a break in play as Cara Hope receives some treatment.     8.09am    36 min: Snowsill doesn\u2019t find touch with her kick from that penalty but Wales mop up the mistake with a turn over. But no! Wales knock it on after their great work to win it back. New Zealand have the scrum and come away with it.      8.07am    34 min: After a reset New Zealand come away with it. Woodman comes away with it and she offloads to Ayesha Leti-I\u2019iga but the winger spills a metre from the line! Wales have the scrum right by their try line but they win the penalty and clear their lines.     8.04am    31 min: Tui runs, runs and just keeps running in a magnificent break but Joyce eventually gets her down. The hosts run through the phases but they have the advantage as Jones is offside. We come back for it and the Black Ferns opt for a scrum.     8.02am    29 min: And for all the Welsh work and good early defence they now have a mountain to climb in this quarter. New Zealand with the ball again here.     8.01am   TRY! New Zealand 19-3 Wales (Hirini, 27')  Wow what a break form Fitzpatrick! New Zealand just keep going, Tui offloads to Hirini close to the line and she outstretches to dot down. Demant gets the extras  Updated at 8.02am BST    7.59am    26 min: Wales win the line-out and they have their first real attacking opportunity. They knock on though and New Zealand have the scrum. A reset later and the hosts win the scrum penalty and will run it from their own 22.     7.56am    23 min: Sarah Hirini takes a clean catch from the restart and though New Zealand look as though they\u2019ve knocked on the referee says it went backwards. Cocksedge makes some great metres but it is Wales who get the penalty! Snowsill kicks to the corner.     7.53am   TRY! New Zealand 12-3 Wales (Tui, 20')  A cross field kick comes in and Woodman collects, she offloads to Tui and she motors to the line! Sensational score. Demant misses the conversion.   Updated at 8.25am BST    7.51am    18 min: Jones does well to keep the ball in play with an offload to Jasmine Joyce and Wales then opt to get the kicking game in play. Joyce decides to run it but Wales are building from their own 22. Bevan pops in a box kick but it doesn\u2019t go far at all and New Zealand have a great position.     7.49am   PENALTY! New Zealand 7-3 Wales (Bevan, 16')  Wales swap their kicker and the points are secured!     7.48am    15 min: Wales win a breakdown penalty and Jones opts to point for the sticks.      7.46am   TRY! New Zealand 7-0 Wales (Woodman, 13')  That is slick rugby from New Zealand and Portia Woodman equals the record for most tries in women\u2019s Rugby World Cup history, Woodman\u2019s 19th which equals ex-England player Sue Day. The ball was ran through the hands and Wales found themselves outnumbered on the wing. Ruahei Demant adds the extras.   Updated at 8.40am BST    7.44am    11 min: New Zealand win the line-out and they are on the attacking march once more. But Wales turn it over! There is great defence from the visitors so far. We are looking at the TMO now for an exchange between Hannah Jones and Ruby Tui. Jones tackled Tui off the ball and New Zealand kick to the corner.     7.42am    10 min: Chelsea Bremner knocks on at the line-out and Wales have a scrum just five metres out from the Black Ferns try line, a lot of pressure for a clean set piece here. And Wales win the scrum penalty and Snowsill can clear her lines.     7.40am    8 min: New Zealand have the scrum this time after a Welsh knock on. The hosts come away with it and they run through the phases. Portia Woodman\u2019s offload doesn\u2019t come off and the winger is shoved into touch anyway, good defence from Wales there.     7.38am    6 min: That is disappointing from Wales, Elinor Snowsill misses a close range kick \u2013 a big opportunity missed. New Zealand knock on once more though and Wales have a line-out, they come away with it but the hosts manage to turn it over at the break down. Possession exchanges hands and it is quite frantic right now!     7.36am    4 min: Good news for Wales as Phillips remains on the pitch and is involved in the scrum as the teams go again. The set piece is wobbly from both sides as we reset once more, it is a star part of Wales\u2019 game so they will be hoping to win this and set the tone early doors. Wales come away with it and unleash their attack. Donna Rose makes a good few metres and Wales win the penalty at the breakdown \u2013 they point to the sticks.     7.34am    2 min: It is the hosts who had early possession but they knock on, Wales celebrating as they win the first scrum of the match. Ahead of a reset Carys Phillips needs some medical attention so there is a slight break in play.     7.31am   Kick-off! New Zealand 0-0 Wales  Here we go! Can New Zealand fulfil the favourites tag or will Wales supply an upset?     7.29am    Spine-tingling anthems and an equally emotional haka sets the tone ahead of this one! Wales walked towards the haka as it was happening and it only spurred the Black Ferns to be louder. Kick-off to come shortly.     7.22am    The players are out on the pitch and the anthems will be in full flow shortly! We\u2019re just minutes from kick-off, any predictions? Let me know via Twitter or email.     7.18am    Wales captain Hannah Jones says her side will dig deep to get the result this morning. \u201cWe know Saturday is going to be a really intense, physical game but we also know we can take our minds and our bodies to a dark place,\u201d she said. \u201cA massive amount will come down to mindset: work rate and how much we really want this.\u201d Read the full piece:      7.11am    New Zealand coach Wayne Smith has warned his side about under-estimating their opposition today. He said: \u201cComplacency is your enemy. Attitude is your friend.\u201d     7.04am    Wales head coach Ioan Cunningham says the quarter will be an opportunity for his team to grow, saying: \u201cWe have a tough task on Saturday facing the Black Ferns on their home patch. They are in good form, scoring a lot of points and playing well. However, we have nothing to lose, we intend to go out and leave everything on the field. We will be playing in front of a huge home crowd and we will need to feed off the atmosphere. To play New Zealand twice in a World Cup is 100% the experience you want to grow as a team \u2013 it\u2019s only going to raise our standards short term but also longer term too.\u201d      6.57am    New Zealand Rugby have had a lot of criticism aimed at them this week after an All Blacks Test against Japan was scheduled around the same time as the Black Ferns quarter-final. The organisation said they \u201cdid not take into account\u201d the quarter-final, that is being hosted in New Zealand by the defending champions. It\u2019s fair to say they have had further criticism after they responded, read the full story:      6.50am    It is early but what a treat we have in store! Where are we all watching from? Are any pubs showing it early doors? Or are you watching with a bowl of cereal? I am huddled under a blanket with a nice latte. Let me know via Twitter, @rendellx, or email.     6.44am    There has already been a quarter-final played this morning between France and Italy. It was a game a lot of people were finding hard to predict, France being the favourites on paper but Italy coming alive in this tournament. France lived up to expectations though and were 39-3 winners and they will play the winner of New Zealand v Wales in the semis.      6.36am    As I say the team news is in and New Zealand have called upon their big guns for the quarter-final. Stacey Fluhler, Ruby Tui and Portia Woodman are three of six changes to the starting squad with Ruahei Demant, Kendra Cocksedge and Chelsea Bremner all coming into the side. New Zealand starting XV: Ruby Tui; Portia Woodman, Stacey Fluhler, Theresa Fitzpatrick, Ayesha Leti-I\u2019iga; Ruahei Demant (captain), Kendra Cocksedge; Phillipa Love, Georgia Ponsonby, Amy Rule, Maiakawanakaulani Roos, Chelsea Bremner, Alana Bremner, Sarah Hirini, Liana Mikaele-Tu\u2019u. Replacements: Luka Connor, Krystal Murray, Santo Taumata, Joanah Ngan-Woo, Kennedy Simon, Ariana Bayler, Hazel Tubic, Renee Holmes.  Wales, meanwhile, make four changes for the match. Keira Bevan and Lowri Norkett will make their first starts of the tournament with Carys Phillips and Donna Rose also coming into the side. A positional change also comes with Jasmine Joyce shifting to full-back. Wales starting XV: Jasmine Joyce; Lowri Norkett, Carys Williams-Morris, Hannah Jones (captain), Lisa Neumann; Elinor Snowsill, Keira Bevan; Cara Hope, Carys Phillips, Donna Rose, Natalia John, Gwen Crabb, Bethan Lewis, Alex Callender, Sioned Harries. Replacements: Kelsey Jones, Gwenllian Pyrs, Sisilia Tuipulotu, Georgia Evans, Siwan Lillicrap, Ffion Lewis, Lleucu George, Megan Webb.      6.30am   Preamble  Welcome back to our Rugby World Cup coverage with hosts New Zealand\u2019s quarter-final against Wales.  The Black Ferns are the heavy favourites in this one, especially as these teams have already faced one another in the tournament. In the pool stage New Zealand claimed a 56-12 win over Ioan Cunningham\u2019s side and it would be huge upset if Wales manage to knock out the hosts this morning.  It is set to be a cracking match though with Portia Woodman targeting a record. If the back can score against Wales she will equal former England player Sue Day\u2019s record of the most tries scored in women\u2019s Rugby World Cup history. Day has 19 to her name with Woodman on 18 so she has the potential to even eclipse the record in the game. Woodman is starting for New Zealand in a star studded back line and the team news dropped a few days ago. Stay tuned for the team news in full ahead of kick-off at 7.30am.  "

                    "body": "Described as the Highland Hunger Games, new BBC One psychological reality show The Traitors is proving a hit with audiences but is also creating an appetite for the Scottish castle and region where it was filmed. This week the dark Claudia Winkleman-fronted series was trending second only to the World Cup and the Meghan and Harry documentary on Twitter. It has encouraged more young viewers to sign up to BBC iPlayer than any show other than the Qatar tournament and got a greater audience share than EastEnders. Meanwhile staff at Ardross Castle, the 19th-century Baronial-style castle where the UK and the US version of the show is made, has reported that \u201cit\u2019s a lot busier with a lot of people getting in touch\u201d with the wedding and corporate events venue. The castle, which is set in 100 acres of parkland on the River Alness north of Inverness, is not open to the public and can be hired for weddings and corporate events such as team building. It was originally built as a hunting lodge in the late 1700s by George Granville Leveson-Gower, later the 1st Duke of Sutherland, but remodelled by Alexander Ross for Sir Alexander Matheson with towers and turrets. It is now owned by the McTaggart family. Ardross Castle is used as the base for show in which 22 strangers arrive in the hope of winning a share of \u00a3120,000. Among them are three \u201ctraitors\u201d, chosen by Winkleman, who try to avoid detection while choosing one of the rest of the group (AKA \u201cthe faithful\u201d) to murder every night. The faithful have to work out who the traitors are before they are killed. The power of \u201ctelevision tourism\u201d, where viewers want to visit the location of shows such as Downton Abbey and Peaky Blinders, has boosted interest in visiting Highclere Castle and Birmingham. VisitScotland\u2019s film and creative industries manager, Jenni Steele, said: \u201cResearch shows that one in five visitors are inspired to travel after seeing destinations on film or TV.\u201d Filmed in the Scottish Highlands area, The Traitors showcases the region to audiences and potential visitors from around the UK and now the US. The Traitors has gripped audiences, with the first episode on 29 November winning 4 million viewers and attracting comparisons with \u201cNasty Nick\u201d Bateman\u2019s game playing in the first series of Big Brother.  Stephen Lambert, whose company Studio Lambert makes the UK and US versions as well as hits Gogglebox, The Circle and Race Across the World, told the Guardian his team spotted the potential of the original Dutch version (created by TV producer Marc Pos, who worked on the original Dutch Big Brother and Eurovision) and got the rights to make both shows, which they did sequentially at Ardross six months ago. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a reality show quite like this in terms of the setting and the presentation,\u201d said Lambert. \u201cThe fact it talks about people being murdered \u2026 [the traitors] are wearing cloaks and there are lots of burning fires makes it different. Most reality shows tend to be in a contemporary setting whereas this is clearly evoking the past in some way.\u201d He added: \u201cthe format ramps up the tension\u201d which is \u201cbrutal\u201d and \u201cbecause we know who the Traitors are it\u2019s much more interesting. Obviously the paranoia builds up, they take it all quite seriously because it\u2019s quite intense and a big prize.\u201d His colleagues Mike Cotton and Tim Harcourt chose Ardross Castle because the Dutch version had one and the BBC wanted to shoot in Scotland, plus Ardoss had \u201ca great hall for the round table\u201d \u2013 which is the \u201cheart of the show\u201d and is where the contestants banish the person they think is a traitor. The show will continue airing three nights a week on BBC One until the final on 22 December and BBC head of unscripted, Kate Phillips, said it appealed to audiences who wanted \u201csomething new and gripping\u201d and it echoed a \u201csummer of fraught politics\u201d. \u201cPeople want something escapist to talk about; we\u2019re living through tough times at the moment [and] sometimes when you\u2019ve got grim news you want something escapist and glorious and fully immersive.\u201d Phillips said the show\u2019s \u201ctotal unpredictability and twists\u201d, plus its distinctive \u201cmelodrama\u201d feel with flaming torches, atmospheric music, which is already on Spotify, and Winkleman \u2013 whom she asked to host having known about her interest in human behaviour \u2013 were part of its appeal. Winkleman describes her outfits \u2013 which include Celtic brands such as Brora \u2013 as \u201ca mix of Princess Anne, Ronnie Corbett and Madonna when she met Guy Ritchie\u201d, and they have inspired some viewers to request they have their own social media account. The Traitors\u2019 success is part of a trend for high-concept reality shows. Next year reality veterans Big Brother and Survivor are being rebooted in the UK for modern audiences but Studio Lambert is making a new reality series called Rise and Fall, which focuses on the imbalance of power in society. Lambert said: \u201cI think something like Rise &amp; Fall \u2026 is a way of doing an entertainment show but \u2026 looking at power and inequality. If we pull it off in the way we hope will speak to something of our times.\u201d"

                    "body": "There may be a sparkly new kid on the block in the shape of the Women\u2019s Premier League, but for the next four weeks at least international women\u2019s cricket is the focus. Beginning on Friday, at three venues in South Africa \u2013 Cape Town, Paarl and Gqeberha \u2013 10 teams will be fighting it out in a 20-over World Cup. Nine of them will be desperately, but probably futilely, hoping to steal the title Australia have held since 2018. England find themselves in Group B, alongside India, Pakistan, West Indies and Ireland. Progression to the semi-finals will be the minimum expectation, while topping their group will be key if they are to avoid the bear-trap of Australia before the final, scheduled for 26 February in Cape Town. Three years ago, Heather Knight\u2019s side were left swimming in frustration, when a washout in Sydney denied them the chance to progress to the final. Fortunately, the ICC has learned from that mistake: this time, both semi-finals (on 23 and 24 February) have reserve days scheduled.  The rest is up to the coach, Jon Lewis, who seems intent on pursuing a strategy akin to Women\u2019s Bazball. In Alice Capsey, playing in her first World Cup complete with a metal plate and seven screws in her shoulder (she broke her collarbone in December), he may just have found the player to pull it off. In a frenzied warmup against South Africa in Stellenbosch on Monday, England hammered 246 runs in 20 overs. Sophia Dunkley hit 59 off 19 balls, while Capsey top-scored with 61. Dunkley, who is relishing her new role at the top of the order, described England\u2019s new approach: \u201cTake the positive option always, take on the bowlers, and not be scared of getting out.\u201d Compare that with the last World Cup, when the highest total was 195, and you get some idea of the way England are approaching the tournament. On the other side of the draw, Group A consists of the reigning champions, Australia, the hosts, South Africa, plus New Zealand, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. Australia suffered a shock three-wicket defeat to Ireland in their own warmup game on Wednesday, but Alyssa Healy \u2013 who retired out after hitting 62 from 40 balls \u2013 said her team did not set too much store by the result. \u201cWe had some different options, trying some different things throughout the innings. Once we get our full-strength XI on the park in their specific roles, I\u2019ve got no doubt we\u2019ll nail that.\u201d   South Africa have not hosted a women\u2019s World Cup since 2005 and should be heading into this tournament full of anticipation: they made the semi-finals in 2020 and in last year\u2019s 50-over World Cup. Their preparations have been overshadowed by accusations of an inflexible fitness regime. This is thought to have forced big-hitter Lizelle Lee into premature retirement last summer and led to the captain, Dane van Niekerk, being dropped from their squad after failing a 2km time-trial by 18 seconds. Before this news broke, South Africa\u2019s group match against Australia in Gqeberha (capacity 19,000) was announced as a sell-out. But, given everything, will the locals still respond to the tournament hashtag #TurnItUp by actually #TurningUp? The wildcard that could throw a grenade into every dressing room is the first Women\u2019s Premier League auction on Monday. That happens to be the same day as South Africa v New Zealand and England v Ireland. (Handily, the BCCI has avoided a clash with any of India\u2019s fixtures. Funny, that.) Suddenly, Knight\u2019s Masters dissertation, which assessed the impact of franchise cricket on the international game, is no longer a theoretical exercise. Four of England\u2019s squad \u2013 Sophie Ecclestone, Danni Wyatt and Nat and Katherine Sciver-Brunt \u2013 have selected the maximum reserve price of 50 lakh (roughly \u00a350,000) while 10 others, Knight included, have also put themselves forward. Keeping her team focused on the cricket while 5,000 miles away a group of Indian businessmen are deciding whether she or any of her teammates are worth a life-changing sum of money, could be the biggest challenge of the England captain\u2019s career."

                    "body": "For a while, in those endless, scrolling micro-moments of gape, shock, acceptance and slowly gathering grief, the ball didn\u2019t look like it was actually going to come down. There was always something weird about its angle, something anti-gravitational.\nThe night was suddenly quiet, the ball a lovely white thing out there all alone in all that space. Maybe it could just stay there. Maybe this thing could just stretch out and not actually happen, or not happen enough to matter.\n\nBut the ball really did go a very long way over the bar. As it began to fade into the colours behind the goal, as it became clear Harry Kane had not just hooked his penalty kick, although he did that too, but had lifted it horribly, massively, over the crossbar, it became clear we had another one. Like a process reverting to the mean, like a dog finding its way home by the stars, England had found a way in Al Khor to go out of the World Cup on penalties.\nAnd Kane\u2019s penalty will now stay up there, lost in the thin desert air. It will merge and mingle with the other penalties that never fell back to earth. Chris Waddle in Turin, the ball that simply vanished, which remains a mystery to this day, a case file in a cellar somewhere on Dartmoor. Or Gareth\u2019s own prim, tender, upright sidefoot, so game and guileless.\nIt is, sad to say, a moment that may come to haunt Kane. Let\u2019s not dress it up. It will come to haunt Kane because he loves this stuff, knows his strengths, his role, and because he feels it so deeply with England.\n\nIt was cruel because that penalty kick was a shot \u2013 at 2-1 down with five minutes to play \u2013 to drive this game into extra time. It was a goal to take Kane past the all-time England record. And it was cruel because Kane was really smart and effective here, leading England when they looked brittle and uncertain in the first half.\nIt was cruel for other reasons too, because this was not the same old story. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger had called this match the final before final in an interview with L\u2019\u00c9quipe this week. Wenger says a lot of stuff. But he was perhaps close on this. Certainly, there is no disgrace, no necessary inquest, no requirement for shrieks of rage and betrayal after this narrow tournament exit to the best team in the world.\nAnd yet we will of course have all of these, because the lines have narrowed on this thing, positions been taken. Sometimes looking at Southgate\u2019s England is a bit like considering the ghostly Qatar 2022 mascot La\u2019eeb, a being from the ether that comes from a realm that can, according to Fifa\u2019s slightly desperate blurb, \u201cmean whatever you want it to mean\u201d. Such is the age of Southgate-ism. Look at the scores. Read the scrolls. Consider the history books. Note the uptick. It matters not. Nobody around here is changing their mind.\n\nWhich is a shame, because England were good in defeat, which is also a thing you can be. Southgate went with the team that is obviously the best team. It felt strong, a selection that said: this is what we have. No hiding. Now. Is it good enough? Early on the signs were, frankly, no.\nWith half an hour gone England had the dominant share of the ball but were already one down and looked like a team reaching up, less certain than France, wary on the ball, a callow imitation.\nAnd the reality is France were winning this game before they even started winning it. They just looked stronger, more comfortable, smoother, able to make up the play. There is a rare balance of power and skill and basic football processing capacity in every one of these French players. It is a tribute to a system. And this is, after all, what World Cups are for, to test the merits, the purity of your doctrines.\nFrance have been the best at this for 20 years now. This is a wonderful, generational team. England will keep striving to produce something like it.\nFrance\u2019s opening goal wasn\u2019t anyone\u2019s fault, and kind of was everyone\u2019s fault. Jude Bellingham should have probably got closer to Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni. But England did have their own flicker of light early in the second half.\n\nAnd this was different too. England are supposed to fade, to become overrun in midfield. It didn\u2019t happen here. They got stronger instead and found the way back.\nBukayo Saka, who was excellent in the second half, drew a leg and a trip and a first England penalty, awarded by the absurdly random, but always theatrically convinced Brazilian referee.\nKane waited, re-spotted the ball, then smashed it into the back of the net, loving that feel, the contact, a brilliantly angry piece of precision. Oh, Harry.\nOliver Giroud\u2019s header from a masterpiece of a cross from Antoine Griezmann made it 2-1. Then came that late missed penalty. And for England it always felt too far.\nThere will be noise and upset and blame, but the fact remains it is hard to know what the manager could reasonably have done differently, beyond perhaps striding out in his suit trousers and slam dunking the ball into the net (why didn\u2019t he? Does he believe enough?).\nEngland were good here, as good as they could be. They will leave with a sense of having left a mark against the best, and of another chance lost to the skies.\n"

MEPs on the European parliament\u2019s legal affairs committee voted unanimously with no abstentions on Tuesday to strip immunity from Belgium\u2019s Marc Tarabella and Italy\u2019s Andrea Cozzolino. The European parliament is widely expected to endorse the committee\u2019s view when it votes on Thursday, formally triggering the end of immunity from prosecution for both MEPs. The immunity waiver request came from Belgian authorities, who have charged four people with bribery, money laundering and membership of a criminal organisation in relation to alleged payments from Qatar. The four \u2013 the former Italian MEP Pier Antonio Panzeri, the serving Greek MEP Eva Kaili, her Italian MEP assistant, Francesco Giorgi, and the head of a Brussels NGO, Niccol\u00f2 Fig\u00e0-Talamanca \u2013 have been detained in pre-trial detention. Like Tarabella and Cozzolino, Panzeri and Kaili were members of the European parliament\u2019s Socialists and Democrats group. The three serving MEPs have been expelled from the bloc. Kaili lost her immunity automatically, because prosecutors believed they had caught her red-handed. Under Belgian law, MEPs do not have immunity from prosecution if they are allegedly caught in the act of a crime. Police seized arbout \u20ac150,000 (\u00a3130,000) from the Brussels flat she shared with her fellow suspect Giorgi. On the same day, Kaili\u2019s father was stopped trying to leave a Brussels hotel with \u20ac750,000 stashed in luggage, although later released without charge.  Earlier this month Panzeri signed a plea bargain deal with prosecutors agreeing to provide evidence in exchange for a reduced prison sentence. According to leaks from the investigation to the Belgian press, Panzeri said he had given \u20ac120,000 to Tarabella. Kaili, Tarabella and Cozzolino have denied all charges of wrongdoing. Giorgi\u2019s lawyer has declined to comment, while Fig\u00e0-Talamanca\u2019s family have strongly denied all charges of wrongdoing on his behalf. Police searched Tarabella\u2019s Brussels home last month, but he has never been charged. In a leaked letter to the committee, Tarabella said he welcomed the lifting of his immunity \u201cbeing fully aware of the possible consequences\u201d so he could defend his name. Declaring that he had never received money or gifts in exchange for his political opinions, he wrote: \u201cI am judged by public opinion or by some of my colleagues on the basis of press articles or the self-interested confessions of imprisoned people, who have apparently changed over time, contrary to my position.\u201d  Through his lawyer, Cozzolino has declared his \u201ctotal innocence\u201d, describing the request to lift his immunity as based on \u201ca hypothesis of the investigation\u201d. Cozzolino appeared before the legal affairs committee earlier this month to defend himself, but Tarabella waived his right to do so. Manon Aubry, the French radical left MEP who was in charge of preparing the formal proposals to lift their immunity, told Belgium\u2019s Francophone public broadcaster RTBF that she hoped lifting immunity would throw light on the scandal \u201cbecause to date we only have the tip of the iceberg\u201d. She said: \u201cThere are missing pieces of the puzzle and I hope that this lifting of immunity will help provide the other pieces of the puzzle.\u201d Qatar has also denied all allegations of wrongdoing."

With the Roman Abramovich era well and truly over following the imposition of sanctions on the Russian oligarch, the consortium led by USA! USA!! USA!!! investor Todd Boehly have taken a new broom to the corridors of power at Chelsea and begun sweeping like Trigger from Only Fools and Horses after an overdose of amphetamines. Following the news that Bruce Buck would be stepping down from his role as chairman but remaining in situ as an advisor to the new owners, it has now been confirmed that Chelsea director Marina Granovskaia will be following Buck through the door marked \u201cDo One\u201d. The one-time personal assistant to Abramovich during his days as an up-and-coming oil-igarch at Sibneft, Granovskaia is believed to have known even less than The Fiver about football when she took up her role at Chelsea. However, the University of Moscow graduate quickly built a reputation as a sort of anti-Ed Woodward \u2013 a fiercely private and seriously shrewd boardroom cookie, who Chelsea\u2019s new owners may find tremendously difficult to replace.  Luckily for them, Granovskaia has agreed to \u201cremain available\u201d to provide advice for the duration of the current transfer window, just in case Boehly and his associates decide they want to spaff \u00a397.5m on a world class centre-forward with a view to loaning him back to whatever club they bought him from within a year. Luckily for them, the purchase of Romelu Lukaku from Inter last season is one of very few conspicuous blots on Granovskaia\u2019s Chelsea CV. \u201cAs custodians of Chelsea FC, we now begin executing our long-term vision and plan for the club, creating an outstanding experience for its passionate, loyal fans and continuing to challenge for top honours in line with Chelsea FC\u2019s decorated history,\u201d tooted Boehly, who has ambitiously declared himself interim \u201csporting director\u201d and also announced a number of incoming suits who would be pulling up chairs to the boardroom table. \u201cWorking together, side-by-side, we are firmly committed to winning, both on and off the pitch. For us, that effort has begun.\u201d Of course, like most football fans, Chelsea season ticket holders won\u2019t be particularly fussed about who\u2019s running their club as long as the players continue to hoist shiny pots towards the heavens and keep competing in Big Cup on an annual basis. Their ability to do so may well hinge on whoever is selected to fill Granovskaia\u2019s metaphorically massive stilettos. For now, in the wake of her departure, Thomas Tuchel looks likely to have a much bigger say in who Chelsea target and sign in the current window and, with openings for at least two centre-backs following the departures of Antonio R\u00fcdiger and Andreas Christensen, Juve\u2019s Matthijs de Ligt is top of his shopping list. Yes, it\u2019s another potential mega-money Chelsea summer signing from a top-end Serie A club \u2013 here\u2019s hoping it works out better for them this time around. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cAfter every one of my games in Munich I will come to the dressing room and I will watch Liverpool, for sure, because I am going to be Liverpool\u2019s No 1 fan forever\u201d \u2013 Annie Wilkes Sadio Man\u00e9 signs off from Anfield, with a \u00a335m move to Bayern.

I think it\u2019s hard to beat Newcastle fans\u2019 welcome back to the much-loved \u2018Sir\u2019 Les Ferdinand. He received a standing ovation when he came on as a Spurs sub, then his every subsequent touch was resoundingly booed. He seemed to appreciate it all\u201d \u2013 Bill Nevin. \u201cOne of my favourite moments as a Manchester United fan (and let\u2019s face it, reminiscing about times gone by is pretty much all we have left) is proper club legend, David Beckham\u2019s return to Old Trafford with Milan. He received a rapturous reception, particularly on his introduction as sub, with a rousing chorus of \u2018there\u2019s only one David Beckham\u2019, followed by his first touch being met by a wall of booing. Great stuff. He properly milked it at full-time, and left the pitch wearing a green-and-gold scarf, if I remember correctly. That feels like a very long time ago\u201d \u2013 Matt Jago. \u201cTo continue the discussion about Jaap Stam (Fiver letters passim), I\u2019m sure his comments have less to do with Manchester United\u2019s transfer policy than Stam wanting to beat someone else with his own MLS wooden spoon\u201d \u2013 Harriet Osborn. \u201cI see Bayern have given Man\u00e9 the fabled 2025 shirt.

                    "body": "Arsenal\nThe loss of Gabriel Jesus for up to three months has intensified Arsenal\u2019s search for reinforcements, with Shakhtar Donetsk\u2019s Mykhaylo Mudryk at the top of Mikel Arteta\u2019s January shopping list. But having failed with their initial bid of \u00a355m, Arsenal know they will have to pay much more to secure the 21-year-old and could turn to Atletico Madrid\u2019s Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix as an alternative. Ed Aarons\nAston Villa\nUnai Emery wants to supplement his attacking options. Ollie Watkins has impressed in patches but Villa want more competition up front. A reunion with wingers Arnaut Danjuma and Nicolas Jackson, both of whom Emery worked with at Villarreal, has been mooted, while F\u00e9lix has been offered to numerous Premier League clubs on loan. Villa would be open to offloading Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Guilbert, Morgan Sanson and Marvelous Nakamba, all of whom appear surplus to requirements. Ben Fisher\n\nBournemouth\nBournemouth mean business. Bill Foley, their new 78-year-old American billionaire owner, plans to back Gary O\u2019Neil with at least four new faces in their fight for survival. Foley has acknowledged his aggressive approach might upset others. \u201cI\u2019m not here to make friends,\u201d he said. Bournemouth have dipped into the Championship in the past to pluck talents, including now captain Lloyd Kelly (from Bristol City) and winger Marcus Tavernier (from Middlesbrough), arguably their best performer this season. BF\nBrentford\nThe uncertainty over Ivan Toney\u2019s short-term future, with 262 alleged betting breaches hanging over him, could see Brentford enter the market for a striker out of fear their top scorer will be banned. Brentford are loath to spend heavily in January; in the last winter window they signed Christian Eriksen on a free and Jonas L\u00f6ssl on loan. They were willing to break their transfer record in the summer to sign Mudryk for \u00a330m but he seems out of reach now. Will Unwin\nBrighton\nRoberto De Zerbi\u2019s first transfer window on the south coast may not be as busy as the Italian might hope but Brighton will be eager to show their support after he took over from Graham Potter in September. The Ukraine defender Mykola Matviyenko from De Zerbi\u2019s former club Shakhtar is among those to have been linked, while he will also be desperate to hang on to Alexis Mac Allister \u2013 who signed a new contract until 2025 with an option to extend it by a year before the World Cup \u2013 after his performances for Argentina in Qatar. EA\n\nChelsea\nAfter splashing out a record \u00a3272m in the summer, Chelsea\u2019s spending spree under their new owners looks set to continue into January. The Ivory Coast forward David Datro Fofana is already on his way from Molde with Beno\u00eet Badiashile likely to join him from Monaco, although the expected arrival of Josko Gvardiol may not be so straightforward after Real Madrid entered the race for the Croatian. Chelsea are also reported to have opened talks with Benfica over a move for the Argentina midfielder Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez, who has a \u00a3105m release clause. EA\nCrystal Palace\nCo-chairman Steve Parish\u2019s admission that Palace are targeting \u201cprobably more loans than buys\u201d will not be music to the ears of Patrick Vieira or supporters. The manager\u2019s concerns over a lack of depth in midfield \u2013 not to mention Wilfried Zaha entering the last six months of his contract \u2013 could lead to a frenzied final few days at the end of the month at a club that has signed a new striker in every January transfer window since 2018. EA\nEverton\nAnother relegation battle looms at Goodison Park and the outcome may rest on the club\u2019s success, or otherwise, in landing the forward options Frank Lampard desperately needs. His job could depend on it too. Mohammed Kudus has been a target since the summer but Ajax would not sell then and his stock has since risen. Quality and quantity is vital, with summer recruits Neal Maupay and Dwight McNeil never likely to fill the Richarlison void. Andy Hunter\nFulham\nThanks to a fine start to the season, there is no need to panic at Craven Cottage. Sitting comfortably in mid-table, they can plot some longer term signings to strengthen Marco Silva\u2019s squad. Right-back is one area of concern which the club would like to address, while another central midfielder is on the wishlist and they will be optimistic they can bring in suitable candidates. WU\nLeeds United\nMoney is believed to be tight at Elland Road and, in any case, Victor Orta, the director of football, never seems keen on trading in January. Jesse Marsch does though have a pressing need for a left-back where Pascal Struijk has been filling in out of position while Junior Firpo has struggled for form and fitness. Philadelphia Union\u2019s 25-year-old German full-back Kai Wagner has been under serious consideration for some time and could be a decent acquisition. Salzburg\u2019s Austria international Maximilian W\u00f6ber, recently converted to the left from centre-half, is another possibility. With Patrick Bamford struggling to return to optimal fitness another central striker would also be useful. Southampton\u2019s Scotland forward Che Adams ranks among the potential options. Louise Taylor\n\nLeicester City\nBrendan Rodgers has not made a permanent signing in January since taking charge of Leicester in 2019 but the Northern Irishman is confident that is about to change. Leicester\u2019s owners are willing to fund the arrival of a winger, left-back and centre-back in the window. Rodgers is targeting more stature and physicality, with power and speed at the forefront of his thinking. They could revive a move for the former Chelsea winger J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Boga and the former Leicester loanee Michael Keane has also been linked. BF\nLiverpool\nJ\u00fcrgen Klopp has already revealed his hand with the signing of Netherlands\u2019 World Cup star Cody Gakpo for an initial \u00a335m from PSV Eindhoven. Liverpool had eyed a move for the forward next summer but with rivals circling, plus Luis D\u00edaz and Diogo Jota out until March, plans were brought forward. There remains time to add a midfield reinforcement although top target Jude Bellingham is unlikely to be available until the summer. AH\nManchester United\nErik ten Hag desperately requires a prolific goalscorer but severely limited funds meant he missed out on Gakpo. Instead a cut-price loan deal is the most likely so with a close-to-no-chance of a revival of the summer interest in Bologna\u2019s Marko Arnautovic, might a move be made, say, for Bayern Munich\u2019s Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting who is out of contract in the summer? Jamie Jackson\nManchester City\nPep Guardiola has all but ruled out any business but he did the same regarding signing a new contract during the World Cup (when this writer asked him) so never say never, especially after Manuel Akanji was a surprise buy in the summer window. The manager is reportedly a fan of Josko Gvardiol yet purchasing the \u20ac90m-valued Leipzig defender would seem more likely in the close season. JJ\nNewcastle United\nEddie Howe says it would take \u201cserious money\u201d to improve the quality of his first XI and that financial fair play restrictions dictate such funds may not be available this January. Assuming Newcastle have a little more room for manoeuvre than the manager claims, his top targets are a wide forward with Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach\u2019s Marcus Thuram high on a wishlist also including Leeds\u2019s Jack Harrison. In an ideal world Howe would also augment his midfield with Leicester\u2019s James Maddison but, for assorted reasons, that deal may need to wait for the summer. He also covets Benfica\u2019s Argentina midfielder Fern\u00e1ndez but fears the transfer fee would be of skyscraper proportions. Perhaps more realistically, West Ham\u2019s Harrison Ashby could be signed as cover for Kieran Trippier at right-back. LT\n\nNottingham Forest\nThings will be a lot calmer at the City Ground in January compared to their summer of signing 23 players. Key positions are earmarked for reinforcements down the spine of the team: central defence, central midfield and a forward. As previously proven, the Forest owners are not afraid of paying up for players, so additions are a guarantee. WU\nSouthampton\nIt is less than six months but it feels like a lifetime since Southampton were trying for Gakpo and Gon\u00e7alo Ramos. Those ships have of course sailed. Southampton\u2019s failure to sign a striker in the summer has left them at risk of relegationbut the Saints need to improve at both ends. Previously they have been happy to nurture strikers brought up from the Championship, including Che Adams and Adam Armstrong, but regardless Nathan Jones\u2019s team are short of firepower. BF\nTottenham\nAntonio Conte is never one to rest on his laurels and Tottenham\u2019s shaky form means the Italian is on the hunt for new faces once again. Having enjoyed success in the form of last year\u2019s mid-season arrivals Dejan Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur, Conte is reported to have set his sights on Sporting Lisbon defender Pedro Porro, France midfielder Adrien Rabiot and Morocco\u2019s midfield destroyer Sofyan Amrabat. EA\nWest Ham\nThere was heavy investment in the summer so David Moyes could accept those signings need time to settle and could peak in the second half of the campaign. Twenty-year-old defender Luiz\u00e3o has already been acquired from S\u00e3o Paulo but he will start life in the club\u2019s under-21 team. A senior centre-back would be a target if Craig Dawson leaves. WU\nWolves\nWolves recognise this window can help them play catchup and Julen Lopetegui has been promised funds to revamp a flailing squad that has spent almost the entire season in the relegation zone. The Brazilian forward Matheus Cunha is expected to be the first of at least four new faces through the door. Wolves are also targeting a right-back, centre-back and possibly another striker in addition to Cunha. It remains to be seen if the club renews its interest in the West Ham defender Craig Dawson. BF"

                    "body": "France (4-2-1-3)\nHugo Lloris (GK) The France captain had little to do after the opening handshake. Powerless to stop Australia\u2019s opening goal. 6\nBenjamin Pavard (RB) Solid if unspectacular night with France looking to overload down the left. 6\n\nIbrahima Konat\u00e9 (CB) He might not be in favour at Anfield but the 23-year-old shone for his country, regularly stepping out of defence to snuff out danger and set up transitional attacks. 8\nDayot Upamecano (CB) Confident and composed in the centre of a defence lacking a stack of usual suspects. 7\nLucas Hernandez/Theo Hernandez (LB) Lucas Hernandez\u2019s World Cup may have only lasted 13 minutes after he landed awkwardly in the build-up to Australia\u2019s goal. Brother Theo seized his opportunity as a substitute, raiding time and again from fullback down the left flank and sending over plenty of teasing crosses and smart cutbacks. 8\n\nAur\u00e9lien Tchouameni (DM) Not the type of game for a player of his qualities to shine and he contributed to France\u2019s nervy start in midfield but thereafter he did his job. 6\nAdrien Rabiot (CM) Guilty of being caught in possession early, Rabiot took the game by the scruff of the neck and by half-time he had a goal and an assist. An excellent link between defence and attack, especially in broken play, but Deschamps will want more control against stronger opposition. 8\nAntoine Griezmann (AM) Ability to drift into space between the lines made him a menace all night. France\u2019s Plan A was to attack down the flanks but they looked more penetrating when Griezmann got on the ball in central areas, dictating sharp triangles with his other forwards. 8\nOusmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 (RW) Blistering pace a constant threat down the right hand side. Skinning Aziz Behich early set the tone. 7\n\nKylian Mbapp\u00e9 (LW) Scored one, should have filled his boots, but from go to whoa he tormented Australia down the left hand side. He came into this tournament full of expectation and on this form he looks set to deliver. 8\nOlivier Giroud (CF) No Benzema, no worries. France\u2019s big man did what he does, bagging a brace with the minimum of fuss, equalling Thierry Henry as his country\u2019s record goalscorer in the process. 8\nOther subs: Youssouf Fofana and Kingsley Coman (77 mins), Jules Kound\u00e9 and Marcus Thuram (89 mins) n/a\nAustralia (4-3-2-1)\nMat Ryan (GK) Difficult night for the Australian skipper. Couldn\u2019t do a lot with any of the finishes and made some decent saves to keep the score down. Played his part for France\u2019s second though with the decision to play out from the back via Nathaniel Atkinson. 6\nNathaniel Atkinson (RB) A chastening night for the first Tasmanian to feature at a World Cup. Roasted to a crisp by Mbapp\u00e9 and then feasted on by the overlapping Hernandez. 3\nHarry Souttar (CB) Set up the opening goal with a majestic crossfield pass and tried his best to stem the waves of French attacks. Disappointingly unthreatening from set-pieces. 6\nKye Rowles (CB) Like Souttar, Rowles was put through his paces on World Cup debut but he put in a solid shift and executed a memorable last-ditch challenge to deny Mbapp\u00e9. 5\nAziz Behich (LB) Most of the play was down the other side but Behich had his fair share of work dealing with Demb\u00e9l\u00e9. The honours went to the Frenchman but Behich landed a couple of blows of his own, looked to get forward when he could in the early phases and made a superb goal-line clearance in the second half. 6\nAaron Mooy (CM) Australia\u2019s metronome kept the game ticking over in the opening 20 minutes but thereafter he lost his timing and was caught in possession repeatedly. In his defence he had nothing to aim for when he raised his head. 6\nJackson Irvine (CM) Graham Arnold promised plenty of bite from his side but it only materialised in the form of Irvine. He could have been booked a handful of times before he was eventually cautioned but he lived up to the demand for \u201cAussie DNA\u201d. Skimmed the post with a first-half header. 7\n\nRiley McGree (CM) Anonymous. 4\nMathew Leckie (RW) Set up the opening goal with a brilliant piece of control on the right touchline before delivering a perfect cross. Faded thereafter. 5\nCraig Goodwin (LW) Australia\u2019s likeliest source of danger raided down the left early on and scored the game\u2019s opening goal with an excellent finish high into Lloris\u2019s net.

                    "body": "UNITED NATIONS Given the state of the place and the clowns brazenly running it into the ground, The Fiver gives the United Kingdom another decade tops before it splits into four independent countries, or maybe territories so small they\u2019d make several of the states on the Balkan peninsula look like Canada. Two or three years if the disaster capitalists take it up another notch and the unravelling really starts to accelerate with extreme prejudice. But we\u2019re pretty sure the union will hold firm until at least the end of next week, yes, fairly sure, so for now we\u2019re on reasonably safe ground with the concept of the Home Nations, right? Right! Nations League preview for England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales it is, then. England don\u2019t play until Friday, so let\u2019s set them aside for the minute. The Fiver has to vamp for the next seven days straight, and we can\u2019t blow what little subject matter there is all at once. Suffice to say Gareth Southgate\u2019s rabble, savagely worked over back in June by Hungary in a manner that if nothing else restored the reputation of Gil Merrick, are not the only ones in serious trouble of relegation. Wales, for starters, will fall out of the A tier should they lose in Belgium on Thursday and the Poles avoid defeat at home to the Dutch. That looks more likely to happen than not, but then The Fiver has a record of being wrong about everything that now stretches into a third decade, and with a first appearance at the World Cup for 64 years looming, we\u2019re not entirely sure whether the Welsh will care anyway. Oh, integrity of the Nations League! We hardly knew ye. Northern Ireland are also battling to escape the drop. They have to at least match Cyprus\u2019s two results this coming week, else it\u2019s Andorra, Liechtenstein and San Marino ahoy, and yes, a nautical reference is wholly inappropriate but you get the gist. On the face of it, besting Cyprus shouldn\u2019t be beyond the ken of Ian Baraclough\u2019s side, but then Northern Ireland\u2019s all-time record in the Nations League is about as successful as a cruise line operating out of Vaduz \u2013 zero wins in 14 attempts \u2013 so probably best to keep expectations in check. All of which leaves us with Scotland, who will be promoted to the top tier next week if they manage to beat Ukraine (twice) and the Republic O\u2019Ireland. So the Home Nations are pinning their collective hopes on Scotland, then. That it\u2019s come to this. Oh dear. Never mind, we\u2019ll all be shot of each other soon enough.

NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Uefa\u2019s statement apparently blaming Liverpool supporters for causing the delay to the start of the Big Cup final in Paris was pre-prepared a considerable time before the day of the match.  Newly-released audio has revealed that David Ibbotson, the pilot of the plane on which he and Emiliano Sala died, told a friend the aircraft was \u201cdodgy\u201d after a flight from Cardiff to Nantes. Ukraine captain Andriy Yarmolenko has called for Russia to be \u201ctotally isolated\u201d from all professional sport as news emerged that the country will be excluded from Euro 2024. \u201cThis is a country of terrorists, a country that kills Ukrainians, that kills Ukrainian children,\u201d he said.

England\u2019s Harry Kane and the captains of the seven other Human Rights World Cup qualifiers \u2013 Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Wales \u2013 will wear the OneLove armband in Qatar, where same-sex relationships and the promotion of same-sex relationships are criminalised.

                    "body": "\u2018THIS IS THE WORLD NOW\u2019 The football festival of peace, love, understanding and tolerance that is the Human Rights World Cup starts in 37 days, which might seem a fair old while but is just two fewer than Kwasi Kwarteng spent arrogantly tanking the UK economy in his blink-of-an-eye blur as UK chancellor before being chucked under a big red Brexit bus. Yes, The Fiver\u2019s long been renowned for its ability to see off all comers, and with cutting edge topical humour like that crowbarred into what is supposed to be a wry, sideways look at Liverpool v Manchester City this weekend, it\u2019s small wonder we\u2019ve seen off Dara \u00d3 Briain and his wiseacre cynics on Mock The Week despite their commendable 17-season run.  Before the good and the great of global football converge on Qatar \u2013 and Erling Haaland checks himself into Cyberdyne Systems HQ for a month-long recharge and tune-up from the Skynet conscious group mind and artificial general super-intelligence system \u2013 there is plenty of business to attend to on the domestic front. And following his uncharacteristically poor showing against Liverpool in July\u2019s Community Shield, The Fiver can\u2019t help but feel Haaland might have some of the unfinished kind on his mind. Nicely rested and goal hungry after a midweek break that entailed nothing more strenuous than a few sideline stretches in Copenhagen, the Norwegian should be in prime condition to strike terror into the hearts of Liverpool\u2019s defenders on Sunday. \u201cHe can\u2019t be bargained with,\u201d said J\u00fcrgen Klopp when asked about the threat of Haaland in his pre-match presser, although The Fiver may be paraphrasing in order to continue our laboured Terminator riff. \u201cHe can\u2019t be reasoned with. He doesn\u2019t feel pity or remorse or fear and he absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead.\u201d However, for all his qualities as a striker, Haaland is going into Sunday\u2019s game on a poor run of form by his own lofty standards, what with having hit the post, missed a tap-in and scored just one goal against Southampton last weekend. Liverpool, by contrast, enjoyed a much-needed midweek confidence-booster, spanking seven past Rangers in Big Cup, even if they did, as has become customary, allow their hosts to score first. \u201cI know the quality they have,\u201d said Guardiola, talking Liverpool up in that slightly condescending manner he normally reserves for Bournemouth and other City whipping boys. \u201cIt has always been a tough game and I don\u2019t expect anything else. I know the quality they have, the character.\u201d And while results thus far suggest it might not be the tough game Guardiola claims and Liverpool are in for a shoeing, Klopp can at least console himself with the fact that until Sunday\u2019s final whistle, the future has not been written and there is no fate but what they make for themselves.

FIVER LETTERS \u201cCan I say, as an AFCB supporter living in Bournemouth with my Rangers-supporting Glaswegian wife, I take Liverpool\u2019s entire season as a personal insult. To be entirely rubbish for whole time, apart from inflicting two record defeats against our clubs, can only be seen as deliberate from where I am standing. While I try to understand what I have done to upset Mr Klopp, the only crumb of comfort I can take is that unless they gain an unlikely win against Manchester City at the weekend, they will still be below us in the table\u201d \u2013 Simon Dunsby. \u201cI\u2019m gutted that I didn\u2019t keep hold of the assistant referee\u2019s flag that I incorrectly raised for offside during my son\u2019s U13 match a few years ago. My son\u2019s team was trailing 2-1 when an opposition player raced through on goal. I lifted my flag, completely missing the fact that our right back (in fairness, a full pitch width away from me and my poor eyesight) was keeping everyone onside. I apologised to the opposition manager, who politely shrugged his shoulders. However, he was far from happy when the match finished 2-2. If I\u2019d kept hold of that flag after the match, like Ali Bin Nasser did with the 1986 Hand of God ball, I\u2019d be hoping to net a cool \u00a32.5 million out of my incompetence\u201d \u2013 Steven Pye. \u201cCan I be the first of 1,057 people aware of 1970s American sitcoms to note the name and strength of Xavi\u2019s tipple of choice (Thursday\u2019s Fiver) and say that at 64.2%, Good Times sounds like it would be \u2018dy-no-mite\u2019\u201d \u2013 Ed Taylor. \u201cWithout wishing to detract from Thursday\u2019s winner of the prizeless letter o\u2019 the day, careful research reveals that milk trains picked up milk from local dairies, not dropped it off\u201d \u2013 Keith Whitmee (and no others).

It\u2019s 1958 \u2013 and that\u2019s it. Having said that, they did get to the quarter-finals that year, and may well have won the whole thing had John Charles not been kicked out of the competition. Also, in the process, they scored the greatest goal in the entire history of the whole goddamn thing. Ivor Allchurch, boneddigion a boneddigesau, knocking Diego Maradona, Carlos Alberto, Maxi Rodr\u00edguez, Dennis Bergkamp, Esteban Cambiasso, Archie Gemmill, Saeed Al-Owairan, Michael Owen and Marco Tardelli into a jauntily-cocked hat.  Since then, the bread has always somehow landed toasted-cheese-with-a-healthy-spread-of-mustard-and-a-splash-of-Worcestershire-sauce side down for the Welsh, Joe Jordan, Paul Bodin, all that. However, 64 years of hurt could soon come to an end, with Wales just two games away from making it to the Ethics World Cup in Popularity\u2019s Qatar this November. Austria provide the first hurdle to be cleared, tonight in Cardiff, and while the erstwhile wunderteam boast some fine talent in David Alaba, Marcel Sabitzer and Marko Arnautovic, there are reasons to be optimistic. Aaron Ramsey is playing regular football again, sort of, at Ibrox, while Gareth Bale has got his handicap down to 3.1 and is really dialling in his short irons at the moment. Even if Ramsey and Bale manage to add to their combined total of 56 international goals this evening and make it through, it\u2019s not clear where or when or against whom they\u2019ll play any final eliminator. Tonight\u2019s victors are slated to face the winner of the tie between Scotland and Ukraine, which, well, y\u2019know. But that\u2019s a problem for another day/few months, so Wales are understandably concentrating on the task in front of them right now. \u201cWe can draw on past experiences that have hurt us,\u201d says Bale, referencing the aforementioned Jordan and Bodin fiascos, plus the time he was two up with three holes to play against Harry Redknapp but couldn\u2019t close it out. Here\u2019s to Gareth getting the job done tonight, despite having played only six minutes of football in the last nine years. But if it doesn\u2019t go to plan for Wales, at least, thanks to Ivor, they\u2019ll always have Stockholm.

                    "body": "Football\u2019s women, a correspondent wrote in The Age in the 1970s, \u201care mere appendages to the game, extras in an all-male saga, tolerated but not taken seriously\u201d. For so long, that\u2019s how it was in football. Women washed our socks. They drove us to training. Leigh Matthews did psychological profiles of his Brisbane players\u2019 wives and girlfriends \u201cto assist their playing partners to be better footballers\u201d. When a young Darebin Falcons player was taken as the No 1 pick in the inaugural national women\u2019s draft, things were changing. It was six months after Julia Gillard\u2019s misogyny speech. In the next few years, a woman would pilot a Melbourne Cup winner at 100-1, and nearly 25,000 people would cram into Princes Park for the first AFLW game.  Daisy Pearce hates being called a pioneer. To her, the real heroes of women\u2019s football are the people who paved the way for her generation to play professionally. They\u2019re women like Debbie Lee \u2013 women who weren\u2019t on TV, women who endured the worst of the ignorance, the exclusion and the sexism. When Pearce was 16 and playing her first game of women\u2019s football, Lee whacked her. When Lee was the first woman inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame nearly 20 years later, Pearce paid tribute to her footballing idol. \u201cDebbie made the game accessible for half the population,\u201d she said. As a footballer, Pearce has been an All-Australian captain and won 10 premierships at the VFLW level. She has excelled on parched grounds in the middle of summer and on tempestuous days out at Casey Fields. She\u2019s a smart, consistent footballer who plays a lot taller than her 170cm. These days, she essentially plays as a second coach. It\u2019s tempting to lament that we never saw the best of her. But she insists that she is playing as well as ever, and that the tide has simply risen around her. Despite what such luminaries as Steve Price would have you believe, women\u2019s football has never had more depth, and never been more competitive.  An introvert, Pearce would prefer to let her football to the talking. But when needed, she has stood up against the dickheads and the dinosaurs. As a midwife, she saw women at their most vulnerable and their most powerful. She says her leadership skills, her ability to handle pressure and to have tough conversations were all honed in maternity wards. She is also one of the most respected commentators, columnists and voices in football. I learnt more about the modern game in one of her columns in The Age than I did from 10 years of Wayne Carey\u2019s observations. As a TV commentator, she has what Bunk Moreland from The Wire called \u201csoft eyes\u201d. She looks for things others don\u2019t. She sees patterns others miss, or don\u2019t understand, or jabber over. On radio, she gets to the nub of football\u2019s more complex and divisive issues. Her comments regarding Taylor Walker\u2019s slur, the Hawthorn racism review and Rex Hunt\u2019s belch about female commentators were especially nuanced and welcome. Last week Pearce spoke at length to The Age\u2019s Marnie Vinall. She spoke about midwifery, about trolls, about twins and about premierships. She has never won an AFLW flag. \u201cI want one!\u201d she said. She deserves one. But her legacy in the sport is already secure without one. She lives at the foot of Mt Buffalo, a four-hour drive from Melbourne, and a world away from Ipswich, where Sunday\u2019s grand final will be played. It will be oppressively hot, conditions she hates playing in. They may as well be playing in Qatar. But whether she wins or loses on Sunday, whether she retires or goes on for another year, she\u2019ll be remembered as the face of this generation of women\u2019s football, a generation that bridged the amateur and the professional eras. Nearly three quarters of a million girls and women now play Australian rules football. Daisy Pearce, one suspects, would be a key figure for nearly all of them. Perhaps more than anyone, she has shown that women are no longer considered mere appendages, that they\u2019re no longer viewed as extras, that they can kick, commentate, comment and coach. She has reminded men that this game they were brought up to assume was theirs is now open to the other 50.2% of the population, and that it\u2019s all the richer for it."

                    "body": "Jake Maizen scored the first hat\u2011trick of the Rugby League World Cup as Italy, playing a first international game for three years, produced a magnificent team display to keepalive their hopes of qualifying for the knockout stages with a 28-4 win over Scotland. Italy\u2019s last fixture was a qualifier for this very tournament in November 2019, with the Covid-19 pandemic affecting the ability of Leo Epifania\u2019s side to play regularly. On this display, though, the Azzurri will be hopeful of becoming a regular presence in European rugby league.  Their World Cup squad comprises predominantly players of Italian heritage from the lower leagues of the English and Australian game, with a sprinkling of call-ups from the local Italian scene. But while Maizen crossed for three superb tries, their one real star was Nathan Brown, their captain. Brown, who featured for Parramatta in the National Rugby League Grand Final this month, qualifies for Italy courtesy of his mother. He has spoken effusively about his pride at representing the Azzurri and produced an imperious captain\u2019s display here as Italy proved to be far too strong for Scotland. The result means that, with both sides now facing games against Australia and Fiji, Scotland\u2019s hopes of qualifying from Group B are all but over. Italy, meanwhile, will eye their meeting with Fiji on Saturday as the game which could decide who finishes second behind the Kangaroos.  Italy deservedly led 12-0 at half-time. They broke the deadlock with Luke Polselli\u2019s try, before a burst from dummy-half by Dean Parata doubled their lead. It then took them just four minutes after the restart to extend that advantage further, as Maizen claimed his first of the afternoon. Maizen added his second five minutes later after a fine piece of vision from Parata to send the winger over in the corner, before the Sunshine Coast Falcons man completed his hat-trick in the final moments with a length-of-the-field break as Scotland pushed for points. Nathan Graham\u2019s side did avoid the ignominy of being nilled when Halifax\u2019s Lachlan Walmsley crossed, but it was mere consolation for the Bravehearts, who now have to win their last two group games to qualify. The game was the second of the opening weekend to be played in Newcastle, with this contest at Kingston Park 24 hours after the opener between England and Samoa at St James\u2019 Park, where the opening ceremony was marred by disruption after a power outage cut short the pre\u2011match entertainment. The Guardian understands the issue was caused by the equipment brought in by an events company commissioned by the tournament organisers, rather than the public address system inside St James\u2019 Park, which remained in full working order. In Pool C, New Zealand got their campaign off to a winning start with a 34-12 victory over 12-man Lebanon in Warrington. Michael Cheika\u2019s underdogs shocked the world\u2019s top-ranked team by taking the lead through Josh Mansour\u2019s try, but New Zealand hit back with scores from Kenny Bromwich, Nelson Asofa-Solomona and Peta Hiku.  Lebanon reduced the deficit to six points when Abbas Miski dotted down early in the second half, before Joseph Manu produced two moments of magic, a try assist to Dylan Brown and a score himself. Cedars half-back Adam Doueihi was sent off for dissent just after the hour mark before Jordan Rapana wrapped up the win. Cheika hinted he would appeal Doueihi\u2019s sending off after what the Lebanon coach described as \u201can accumulation of frustration\u201d with the referee, Grant Atkins. \u201cThe World Cup hasn\u2019t given us any footage, we have asked for it,\u201d Cheika claimed. \u201cWe\u2019re all a bit in the dark.\u201d In Sunday\u2019s other game, Luke Keary proved a class apart as Ireland cruised to a comfortable 48-2 win over debutants Jamaica at Headingley. The Sydney Roosters half-back was integral to an impressive display from his side, who ran in 10 tries with six more points from the boot of Joe Keyes adding to an early Ed Chamberlain conversion. Ireland\u2019s next match will be against Lebanon, next Sunday in Leigh."

                    "body": "Shortly after the final whistle at Bramall Lane on Tuesday night, Mary Earps received a congratulatory message from David de Gea. England had just crushed Sweden 4-0 to reach the final of Euro 2022 but that scoreline could have been very different had Sarina Wiegman\u2019s goalkeeper not contributed some superlative-defying early saves. Although Earps and her men\u2019s counterpart at Manchester United do not train together they are mutually supportive and remain in regular touch. \u201cDavid\u2019s just messaged me saying congratulations,\u201d she reported, beaming at suggestions that her first save, made with an outstretched left leg to deny Sofia Jakobsson inside the opening 30 seconds, seemed straight out of the De Gea playbook.  \u201cI\u2019ll take that comparison, no problem at all,\u201d said the 29-year-old, who is unafraid to pick the Spain goalkeeper\u2019s brains. \u201cMe and David speak a little bit. We message back and forth about results and clean sheets and stuff. At Manchester United he\u2019s really supportive of the women\u2019s game; it\u2019s always nice to have his backing.\u201d Earps has come an awful long way in the 10 years since she was juggling low-paid, part-time jobs in order to make the petrol money needed to drive to training at Doncaster Belles. A decade ago, the Nottingham-born keeper never believed she would earn a full-time living from football and, envisaging a career in commerce, completed an information management and business studies degree at Loughborough University. Although football remains very much her first love, business fascinates her and during lockdown she persuaded United to allow her to embark on a special course in entrepreneurship. She also brushed up on German, having acquired some when she was reserve goalkeeper at Wolfsburg during the 2018-2019 season. \u201cI eat, sleep, dream and breathe football,\u201d she has said. \u201cBut I\u2019m also fascinated by business.\u201d During the first lockdown, Earps particularly \u2013 and typically \u2013 enjoyed reading Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki. However, at that stage she seemed to have resigned herself to never progressing beyond understudy status in the international goalkeeping hierarchy.  After making her international debut under Mark Sampson in 2017, she travelled to the 2019 World Cup in France as Phil Neville\u2019s third-choice goalkeeper and arguably rose up the rankings under Wiegman only because of the serious injury that forced Manchester City\u2019s Ellie Roebuck to miss the first half of last season. Once Roebuck recovered, Wiegman went through a spell of rotating her, Aston Villa\u2019s Hannah Hampton and Earps in goal. When the United keeper was confirmed as the first choice for Euro 2022, some critics questioned the England\u2019s manager\u2019s judgment. Earps has confounded them by keeping four clean sheets in five tournament games. Her general excellence was epitomised by the moment in the semi-final when Stina Blackstenius\u2019s shot appeared on an unstoppable trajectory towards the far top corner only for Earps to perform acrobatic wonders and tip it over. At that point it became abundantly clear how far Earps has come since France 2019, when her predominant contribution to England\u2019s squad was a penchant for indulging in morale-boosting practical jokes.  At the time she didn\u2019t feel \u201centitled to anything\u201d and, when Neville subsequently dropped her entirely, had no public complaints. \u201cI was very much of the thinking that: \u2018Yeah, this is probably the end of the international road for me\u2019,\u201d Earps said. \u201cI never expected anything more.\u201d Wiegman, however, recognised the quality and steady improvement of a goalkeeper who, despite spending that season at Wolfsburg largely on the bench, learned a lot from playing against strikers of the calibre of the Denmark forward Pernille Harder in training. It has also helped that after years of frequent transfers \u2013 with spells at Birmingham, Bristol City and Reading following her time at Doncaster \u2013 United offered her the stability of a longer-term contract. Even so, on Tuesday it was as if a player, who takes her job so seriously she has a special monitor to gauge her sleep quality, could not quite believe the scale of her recent metamorphosis. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely loving playing at this level,\u201d she said.  \u201cIt\u2019s such a fantastic feeling. I\u2019m just so proud I can be a part of this England team. \u201cMy teammates have said some really nice things \u2013 some amazing things \u2013 about me and that just means the world. I want to be the best I can be for them.\u201d  Not that she has ever been one to skip her homework. The woman who, during that stint at Doncaster Belles, used to work part-time in a cinema now spends countless hours studying the small screen in her sitting room. \u201cI watch as much televised football as I can,\u201d said Earps. \u201cI watch a lot of Premier League games but I also study goalkeepers from all over the world. It\u2019s really important as a keeper that you develop your own style though because not everything works. You might see something on TV but it may not work for you; everyone\u2019s built differently, we all have different strengths.\u201d It is England\u2019s good fortune that Wiegman has identified an outstanding goalkeeping talent other managers had failed to fully detect."

As we rejoin the Windsors, it\u2019s the 1990s and Elizabeth II (who has rematerialised in the form of Imelda Staunton) is feeling her age. Awkwardly, polling has shown that half of Brits want her to stand aside in favour of Charles (Dominic West). With that in mind, Charles and Diana (Elizabeth Debicki) are keeping up appearances with a \u201csecond honeymoon\u201d. But it\u2019s not going well \u2013 as Charles reflects: \u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary how two people\u2019s understanding of fun could be so wholly different.\u201d A decade of turmoil awaits. Netflix, from Wednesday 9 November *** Mammals  It is hardly the optimum moment for James Corden to be starring in a comedy-drama as a high-end chef. But there are no disappointing omelettes here; instead, Cordon\u2019s Jamie Buckingham is a study in wounded masculinity as a family tragedy unspools into revelations about the unfaithfulness of his wife Amandine (Melia Kreiling). Cordon plays this chippy but traumatised part pretty well \u2013 and it\u2019s not surprising given that Jamie\u2019s mixture of neediness and extroversion feels appropriate to its star. A thoughtful, nuanced script courtesy of Jerusalem playwright Jez Butterworth helps, too. Prime Video, from Friday 11 November *** Dangerous Liaisons  Based on Pierre Choderlos de Laclos\u2019s novel, this tale of decadent French nobility is a glossy, soapy affair. The original books were written as an attack on the corruption of the French ancien r\u00e9gime, which the writer saw as a precursor to inevitable revolution. This adaptation feels less subversive, rather erring on the side of bonnets-and-ballrooms romance, but it\u2019s a passable slice of escapism all the same, with a cast including Alice Englert, Paloma Faith, Carice van Houten and the always excellent Lesley Manville.Lionsgate+, from Sunday 6 November *** Save Our Squad With David Beckham  A timely dose of reputation-management for David Beckham, who is often seen as the bland face of football gentrification but here goes back to his roots for some spit-and-sawdust redemption. Based in east London, Westward Boys have a proud history but a bleak present \u2013 when Beckham rocks up, they\u2019re staring relegation in the face. Can Beckham shake and coax this squad of underachieving youngsters into life? You wouldn\u2019t bet against it. These constructed rags-to-riches narratives always lack a little in credibility, but it\u2019s still impossible to take against the kids. Disney+, from Wednesday 9 November *** Fifa Uncovered  For a variety of reasons, it\u2019s difficult to feel too much enthusiasm about the forthcoming football World Cup in Qatar. This documentary series is a good reminder of why. \u201cBeing in Fifa is like being in a secret garden,\u201d says one interviewee. \u201cThere\u2019s an unspoken code. You can do whatever you want.\u201d Just in time for kick-off, this series tracks the pursuit and eventual prosecution of the crooks and fraudsters who somehow wormed their way to the heart of \u201cthe beautiful game\u201d. As the sportswashing begins, this is grim but vital viewing. Netflix, from Wednesday 9 November *** Capturing the Killer Nurse  This week\u2019s Netflix-powered journey into real-life horror comes in the shape of a documentary telling the true story dramatised in the recent film starring Eddie Redmayne, The Good Nurse. It explores that most disturbing phenomenon: the medical professional with murder in mind. The medic in question is Charles Cullen, a nurse who murdered at least 40 people over the course of a 16-year career in New Jersey. Among others, the film hears from a colleague who caught Cullen in the act. Netflix, from Friday 11 November *** Mythic Quest  While many of us now mainly think of him as the co-owner of Wrexham AFC, Rob McElhenney does have a sideline as an actor. This hilarious game-development comedy-drama returns for a third season, with McElhenney\u2019s creative director Ian launching a new venture in partnership with Poppy (Charlotte Nicdao). Meanwhile, Brad (Danny Pudi) is out of prison and presenting himself as a changed man \u2013 though how long that will last is anyone\u2019s guess. Comparisons to Silicon Valley are inevitable but unfair \u2013 this kind of workplace is increasingly familiar to us all. Apple TV+, from Friday 11 November"

                    "body": "In the summer of 2016 Diego Maradona and Pel\u00e9 were sitting in the Palais-Royal in Paris as part of a promotional event organised by a Swiss watch company. Afterwards the pair held a press conference and before long the topic of conversation turned to Lionel Messi. \u201cHe is a great person,\u201d Maradona said, \u201cbut he has no personality. He doesn\u2019t have the personality to be a leader.\u201d Pel\u00e9 agreed. \u201cHe\u2019s not like we were back in the days,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the 1970s we had really good players like Rivellino, G\u00e9rson, Tost\u00e3o. Not like Argentina now, which depends only on Messi. Messi is a good player, there\u2019s no doubt about it. But he has no personality.\u201d  As ever the internet lapped up this content for a few hours before moving on to the next thing. And yet in a glib sort of way Pel\u00e9 and Maradona were simply giving voice to a common view at that point. The key term is \u201cpersonality\u201d, the idea that somehow the greatest footballers do not simply lead by exemple. Sometimes \u2013 if only for reasons of theatre or self-justification \u2013 leadership needs to be imposed, to be made visible and tangible. And over the years this is perhaps the one area of the game in which many have accused Messi of being deficient. Often these criticisms are even expressed in the guise of praise. \u201c[Javier] Mascherano\u2019s impact as a leader is more important inside the squad, and Messi\u2019s leadership is more important on the pitch,\u201d the former Argentina manager Tata Martino said. \u201cHe is a silent leader,\u201d said Jorge Sampaoli. \u201cHe has a lot of personality when playing,\u201d insisted Sergio Batista. \u201cMaybe he is missing a little bit in the group. But when he talks in the changing rooms, they listen.\u201d All three of these men, along with Maradona, have managed Messi at international level and presumably had some idea of what they were talking about. And yet none of them was in the Argentina dressing room at the Maracan\u00e3 before the Copa Am\u00e9rica final against Brazil in July 2021, when Messi gathered his Argentina teammates in a circle and gave a speech. \u201cForty-five days we were locked up in hotels,\u201d Messi said. \u201cForty-five days without seeing our families, guys. All for what? For this moment. So we\u2019re going to go out there and lift the trophy; we\u2019re going to take it home to Argentina. And I want to finish with this: coincidences don\u2019t exist. This cup was going to be played in Argentina, but God wanted it to be played in Brazil, so that we could win here in the Maracan\u00e3 and make it more beautiful for all of us.\u201d For a public that has spent 16 years watching Messi from a distance \u2013 expressive and yet mostly mute, a silent blur of limbs and colour \u2013 there is something strangely stirring about this oration, filmed as part of a forthcoming Netflix documentary. Argentina would win the final 1-0 and, while hindsight can tell any story you want, Messi\u2019s teammates were quick to attribute their victory in part to his inspirational leadership. \u201cMessi spoke before each game,\u201d \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda would later testify. \u201cBut this last speech was different. He lost his mind.\u201d This is Messi\u2019s fifth World Cup. And of course there has been a lot of the usual talk about whether he \u201cneeds\u201d to win it for his legacy, a lot of the usual hot air and spume about his duel with Cristiano Ronaldo, football discourse reduced to the level of a pub debate. Within Argentina, however, something seems to have changed. After more than a decade of treating Messi as a vessel for their expectations Argentina are finally beginning to ask not what Messi can do for them but what they can do for Messi. Perhaps the turning point in this respect was the 2019 Copa Am\u00e9rica campaign, in which Messi was an uncharacteristically vocal presence. He complained about the poor quality of the pitches, described the refereeing as \u201ccorrupt\u201d and insisted that the \u201cwhole thing is set up for Brazil\u201d. Having been criticised early in his career for his meek rendition of the national anthem, here Messi sang it loudly and passionately. Nobody ever doubted how much Messi cared. But here, perhaps, was a recognition by him that it needed to be shown, not simply known. Now, under Lionel Scaloni, Messi\u2019s final shot at World Cup glory may just be his best, too. The retirements of senior players such as Gonzalo Higua\u00edn and Sergio Ag\u00fcero have allowed Scaloni to build a more balanced side, in which the midfield is set up to give their captain the ball closer to goal. After a rotten 2021-22 Messi himself is showing some of his best form for Paris Saint-Germain this season. And for an Argentina team who have not lost in three years, star-laden bombast has been replaced by a quiet resolve, a determination not simply to treasure the result but to relish the journey. And really, perhaps this was the way it always had to happen. The godlike Messi of the 2010s always felt a slightly uneasy fit with the bespoke demands of international football, where teams need to be built rather than bolted together. Meanwhile, for a player who essentially emerged fully formed as a child, perhaps Messi needed to go on his own voyage of emotional development, to learn the stickier parts of a game that had always come so naturally to him, a process that from the outside seems to have turned him into a humbler and wiser man. And so, a first World Cup, at the age of 35, completing one of the most fantastical story arcs football has known? As Messi put it in the Maracan\u00e3 locker room, there are no coincidences."

                    "body": "This was a reminder that Denmark, highly favoured in many quarters, must walk steadily before they attempt to run. They deserved no more than a draw against a clever, highly motivated and rattlingly intense Tunisia who were on top for much of the first hour. Even though Andreas Cornelius subsequently missed a sitter and a last-gasp penalty shout was dismissed by VAR, it would be hard to construct an argument that Christian Eriksen\u2019s return to the highest stage should have been celebrated with three points.\nAt least they could focus on playing a game of football. Denmark have been at the forefront of the controversy over the OneLove armband, also seeing Fifa ban them from wearing a training shirt proclaiming support for human rights, and while their performance should be separated from that it is clear the farrago has taken a toll. In an extraordinary post-match press conference their manager, Kasper Hjulmand, laid bare his struggle dealing with the cloud that has dogged this tournament\u2019s every step.\nHjulmand made clear that the weight was not so heavy as to affect his work with the players. But he admitted the backdrop had been a costly diversion and, speaking calmly but with obvious emotion, outlined the daily wrestle with his conscience that has come with navigating his responsibilities in Qatar.\n\n\u201cI spend too much time every day right now figuring out how to handle this,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are so many things I really want to say and many things I want to do. It\u2019s an old saying: find the calmness to see what you want to change, the courage to do what you can, and the wisdom to tell the difference. And I\u2019m fighting with this, I have to say. I have never been thinking of other things when I\u2019m with the players, but I can tell you I have difficulties finding myself here.\n\u201cIn Denmark we have this slogan called \u2018part of something bigger\u2019, and right now I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m part of something that I like.\u201d\nDenmark had been criticised at home for, along with seven other countries, backing down on wearing the armband but Hjulmand repeated his pre-match assertion that his players must be insulated from any consequences. He lamented that a lifelong dream of working at a World Cup had been sullied and continued: \u201cI\u2019m talking for myself as a human being when I say I find the situation difficult right now.\u201d Despite some murmurings before kick-off that the Denmark captain, Simon Kj\u00e6r, might break ranks there were no new reasons to fixate on his sleeve.\nIf Fifa had been Denmark\u2019s most awkward opponent in the tournament\u2019s buildup it quickly became clear Hjulmand\u2019s team were up against an extra man in the form of the crowd. More than 30,000 Tunisians had travelled, in stark contrast to the pocket of 700 or so Denmark fans, and they made a racket that gave the lie to any notion that this winter will be bereft of fanatical football environments.\n\nWithin two minutes they were roaring as A\u00efssa La\u00efdouni, a gladiatorial midfielder, hurled himself into a challenge on Eriksen and thumped his chest in response. That set the tone and, amid a deafening atmosphere, Tunisia were the better side before half-time. Theirs was a shrewd display, clearly motivated by their faithful but not wound up to distraction by it; they defended when they had to, pressed when they could and almost scored when Mohamed Dr\u00e4ger\u2019s shot deflected agonisingly wide off Andreas Christensen.\n\nKasper Schmeichel thwarted their clearest opening with a brilliant save from Issam Jebali, who plays his club football in Denmark and looked certain to score. The second half began frantically before Hjulmand, who had earlier lost the influential midfielder Thomas Delaney to the effects of a heavy fall, freshened things up and almost profited. Cornelius, a substitute, stooped to convert Christensen\u2019s header across goal but made only faint contact and somehow struck the far post from two yards.\nEriksen and Jesper Lindstr\u00f8m forced saves from Aymen Dahmen before the referee, spotting a foul on Taha Khenissi, ruled VAR\u2019s call to look at Yassine Mariah\u2019s added-time handball irrelevant.\n\u201cWe played against a powerhouse of a team and performed very well,\u201d said the Tunisia manager, Jalel Kadri. It was true, but his opposite number had spelled out the unease that lurks behind every win, defeat or draw."

All employees in uniform can wear mascara, false eyelashes and earrings from Monday, as well as carry accessories including handbags, an internal memo told staff. Staff are urged to use \u201csubtle shades\u201d of makeup and aim for a \u201cnatural look\u201d, according to the updated rules. Nail polish is permitted for all, although black and neon nails are still off-limits. \u201cMan buns\u201d will also be permitted under updated hair grooming rules. It follows similar moves by rivals, notably Virgin Atlantic, to update its policies to reflect the diversity of modern society. The national carrier is also believed to be trying to update its image to reflect its branding campaign \u201ca British original\u201d, which it says is a celebration of the airline\u2019s people, customers and the nation; it is also hoping to boost staff morale after the layoffs and pay cuts imposed during the pandemic. BA said: \u201cWe are proud of all of our colleagues at British Airways and we are committed to an inclusive working environment. \u201cWe have worked with our people to create updated guidelines for grooming, beauty and accessories, allowing our colleagues to bring the best, most authentic version of themselves to work every day.\u201d The carrier still insists on a greater level of restraint than rivals Virgin Atlantic, which recently said its staff could choose whichever uniform they prefer to wear, regardless of gender. BA\u2019s insistence on retaining gender-specific uniforms for staff has not changed. Virgin earlier this year also changed its guidelines to allow cabin crew to have visible tattoos. It first relaxed rules forcing female crew to wear makeup in 2019. BA\u2019s latest memo though tells staff to \u201cbe bold, be proud, be yourself\u201d, adding that it hopes the guidelines will be \u201cembraced by everyone regardless of gender, gender identity, ethnicity, background, culture, sexual identity, or otherwise\u201d. While BA has moved to keep in step with its UK rival, not all carriers worldwide are known to be as relaxed about gender fluidity and appearance. Qatar Airways, the major shareholder in British Airways, has long imposed strict working conditions and uniform rules on its flight attendants \u2013 \u201cterminating\u201d crew employment in the past and effectively forcing deportations for non-visible tattoos and other violations. Qatar and BA last year have also established a large global joint route network, with increasing numbers of codeshare flights, and allowing frequent flyers to earn airmiles or points on each other\u2019s flights. Asked whether male pilots and crew wearing makeup and accessories would be welcomed on flights operating in and out of Doha, BA declined to comment further. Qatar Airways was contacted for comment."

                    "body": "These might be tense times for Mark Wood, the fastest bowler at the T20 World Cup and a man whose 90mph-plus zingers are expected to have extra potency on Australia\u2019s pace-friendly pitches. He approaches the tournament with memories fresh of his personal struggles at last year\u2019s event, and of a summer completely ruined by an elbow injury. Wood can be a hard man to read, a person whose natural positivity and humour always make him appear carefree. And yet, as he speaks on the eve of England\u2019s opening game, that appears to be his genuine state.\n\u201cI\u2019m proper excited,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause I hadn\u2019t played in ages and I feel like I\u2019m coming off some good performances. I had a really poor World Cup last year. I was having injections in my ankle before the games, and I didn\u2019t take a wicket and in the Twenty20 format that\u2019s my job \u2013 my role is to try and take wickets and get the big people out and change games. So I\u2019m hungry to prove, I guess, that was a blip.\u201d\n\nEngland\u2019s white-ball side had one of those in the summer, when they laboured to series defeats at home to India and South Africa, but more recent success against Pakistan and Australia means they enter the competition in buoyant mood. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got a good dressing room where everybody enjoys each other\u2019s success and enjoys being part of it and enjoys playing with each other,\u201d Wood says. \u201cThat\u2019s a given within the group, and it\u2019s a value that the group have naturally \u2013 it\u2019s not forced or anything like that. And I think this year, the same as last year, everybody feels that we could, you know, we could do something good.\u201d\nEngland are among the favourites for the title, and after their run to the semi-finals in the UAE last year this is a final opportunity for them to double up and add this trophy to the 50-over version they have held since 2019. \u201cI know it\u2019s a bit cheesy but in terms of the legacy of this group, we want to be remembered as one of the greatest white-ball teams in the world,\u201d Wood says.\n\n\u201cI know probably Australia and India are favourites but we\u2019re a dangerous team, I think. It\u2019s a real positive atmosphere in the group and there\u2019s clarity, there\u2019s a good feeling, that calmness. I feel like we\u2019re confident in each other\u2019s abilities and we trust each other, that\u2019s how it feels so far. Leading into a tournament we\u2019re in a great place.\u201d\nWhile many members of last year\u2019s squad have returned, the team has also been transformed by the retirement of Eoin Morgan, his replacement as captain by Jos Buttler, and the arrival of a new coach in Matthew Mott.\n\n\u201cI think we need to get away from comparing everything to Morgy and his team. This is now Jos\u2019s team, this is his ship,\u201d Wood says. \u201cThis is a fresh start for a new team. And if we can start well, look dangerous, put the fear of God into other teams then, you know, we\u2019ll be remembered as a great team. And if I could get a few wickets and we do well then it might just push my book sales a little.\u201d\nWood\u2019s book, The Wood Life, was published last month, the day after its author left England, initially for Pakistan, to prepare for the World Cup. It is an unusual proposition, an autobiography-cum-tongue-in-cheek-self-help-book filled not just with anecdotes from his playing career but tips for a variety of life events, interjections from friends and teammates, and the kind of humour that has made him such a cherished member of England\u2019s dressing room.\n\n\u201cI thought my autobiography would have been pretty boring: I got injured, I played cricket, I got injured. So I was wanting to do something a little bit different,\u201d he says. \u201cI was excited to just, you know, let it out. I felt like I had plenty of things to say. There\u2019s a certain amount in the back of your mind where you feel a bit unsure of how it will be perceived, but I was assured that there might be some demand from cricket fans.\u201d\nHis publishers must have been concerned as an elbow injury sustained in the West Indies in March ended up requiring two operations and six months to recover from, but his return has been impeccably timed. \u201cIt was rubbish. It was crap, just really frustrating,\u201d he says of his summer off. \u201cI did some commentary at Durham for England\u2019s game against South Africa and when you\u2019re not in the group it feels so strange to come back in. It feels like you\u2019re on the outside straight away. That\u2019s not the way the lads make you feel, it\u2019s just how you feel internally.\u201d\n\nWood\u2019s first operation failed to deal with the underlying issue and led to months of painful recuperation. \u201cThere were times I was bowling full tick in the nets, but my arm was heavily strapped and I\u2019d have to have two or three days off [afterwards] because I couldn\u2019t straighten my arm again,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was literally an hour and a half physio, strap my arm, then warm it up, then go in the gym, then bowl. So a two and-a-half-hour job, just to bowl four overs in the nets.\u201d\nA second operation followed in July, which identified a ligament issue. He finally returned to action in Pakistan, where on his first appearance his bowling peaked at 97mph. \u201cIt felt great, it felt fresh,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was nice to charge in and just let it fly.\u201d\n\nEngland have suffered from a string of injuries to bowlers across all formats in recent months, and this squad contains four \u2013 Wood, Chris Woakes, Chris Jordan and Tymal Mills \u2013 who reached full fitness just days before the tournament. This week they have had to deal with another, after Reece Topley was ruled out of the World Cup after tripping over the boundary padding in Brisbane on Monday.\n\u201cThe bowling group, we\u2019ve all been through injuries, so we all know how hard it is,\u201d Wood says. \u201cThis World Cup I was sure he was going to shine because he was in great form. So we\u2019re all just disappointed for him. Obviously it gives someone else an opportunity and we feel like we\u2019ve got good cover, it\u2019s just more that everyone\u2019s disappointed for Toppers.\u201d\nThis tournament was Wood\u2019s goal throughout his recuperation, a target since the last one ended in disappointment, and his focus since he left home more than five weeks ago. Against Afghanistan in Perth on Saturday it finally begins. \u201cI think the whole group, we\u2019re just ready for the match now. At the minute, it feels really good because everybody\u2019s just ready,\u201d he says \u201cWe\u2019re ready to go.\u201d"

                    "body": "Over a long career, David Warner has presented many versions of himself. The short-form bludgeoner of his T20 debut in 2009 gave way to the studious opener of his first Test century on a Hobart greentop in 2011. The raucous presence known as The Bull who was suspended from the 2013 Ashes gave way to the contemplative Reverend by 2015, schooling teammates on the power of positive thinking, before returning to his most confrontational mode before the Ashes in 2017. The instigator of the sandpaper ball-tampering plot in 2018 served a year\u2019s playing ban, ran the well-worn path of public redemption via on-field success, and has since presented himself as an elder statesman with an accordingly impeccable disciplinary record.  The way he is perceived has also shifted, in cricket media at least, but no shifts have been bigger than the past few weeks as his campaign to have his leadership ban overturned ran into a brick wall. Where his co-accused Steve Smith was banned from captaincy for two years, and Cameron Bancroft not at all, Warner was for life. And while he was in the gun in 2018, here is now broadly a consensus that his punishment was excessive and the review process unfair. On that final point, Cricket Australia had to regulate on the run given a lack of precedent. In 2018, Warner was offered his penalty with the option to accept it or dispute the charge at a hearing. By accepting, the matter was finalised. But CA\u2019s structure did not anticipate dealing with career-long sanctions, because there were no likely offences to attract them without being escalated elsewhere. Corruption falls to the International Cricket Council, violence to criminal court. CA was there for lesser offences, meaning shorter terms of punishment that accordingly would never need revisiting. To change Warner\u2019s penalty after nearly five years, CA needed a new process. Assembling an independent panel to hear the case made sense, given that a board decision overturning a board penalty would be rightly seen as ethically compromised. The panel could not have been more impressive: Alan Sullivan, Leon Zwier, Jane Seawright, Robert Heath and Adrian Anderson are all top-level lawyers, while Sullivan is a part of the Australian Rugby League Commission, Seawright is a director at Netball Australia, and Anderson was a top Australian Football League executive for almost a decade.  What neither Warner nor CA anticipated was that the panel would want to revisit the original offence, taking new evidence and doing so publicly. He has grounds for complaint: by accepting the sanction Warner had already admitted guilt. There was no need to establish it again in a review supposed to be based on his conduct since that time. He withdrew his appeal with CA\u2019s support, saying that such a hearing would only stir up trouble for his family and his teammates. The elephant in the room is that such a hearing would only cause problems because truth was never established in the first place. CA took two days to conduct a self-serving investigation concluding that no Australia player had breached the rules before the day they were caught on camera, despite suspicion having been aroused otherwise. Warner signed off on this version of events and has been a beneficiary ever since, given there was no further investigation into him. At the same time, his private dissatisfaction has become common knowledge. The view from the Warner camp has always been that he was CA\u2019s fall guy: encouraged to stoke conflict on the field, given disciplinary warnings for doing so, given a harsher punishment than Smith and Bancroft because of those warnings, while being blamed for tampering that was done on behalf of the team. Teammates have openly disputed the latter claim. Before last week\u2019s Adelaide Test, Warner\u2019s manager added a claim that CA executives approved tampering as early as November 2016. Puzzlingly, what that comment invites is speculation Australia\u2019s ball-tampering began in 2016. So Warner wants a review of his penalty on the basis that he admitted guilt, even as his manager\u2019s comments attempt to downplay and mitigate that guilt, while simultaneously underlining the possibility that broader wrongdoing happened at earlier times. In taking umbrage at the prospect of further investigation, Warner has only illustrated why established practitioners of the law would deem it necessary. Even taking things at face value, the central argument is whether Warner has been hard done by. It is apparently necessary to repeat that he was never banned for ball-tampering in Cape Town, but for bringing the game into disrepute. This was more to do with the cover-up, having Smith and Bancroft lie to a press conference about Warner\u2019s involvement while he denied it to investigators. It was also to do with what happened after being accused of tampering in the previous Test at Port Elizabeth, when scrutiny made him turn to the newest member of the team.  Bancroft had been a Test player for less than four months. In the first innings at Cape Town he had just played his best hand for Australia, top-scoring with a hard-fought 77. Then Warner asked him to take sandpaper on to the field. It\u2019s no surprise he obeyed. Whether Bancroft would have been a long-term success we will never know, but we do know his career has never recovered. Warner and Smith have enjoyed uninterrupted and fruitful years since. Warner was the vice-captain and putting a junior player in that position was abjectly the opposite of leadership. It is entirely deserving of being counted out as captain for good. Warner would not have anticipated leading Australia again. The whole process was more about symbolically removing a black mark next to his name. The impulse is understandable. But perhaps becoming a better person is about making up for black marks, not erasing them altogether. Warner did what he did. He came back from it, won an Allan Border medal, a T20 World Cup, another Ashes series, and is still a selection lock in all three formats. He has made millions more dollars from Australian cricket and is about to play his 100th Test match, with a record that sits comfortably in the pantheon, and can leave on his own terms to a thousand opportunities of what to do next. On the scale of hard done by, there\u2019s barely a flicker."

Phillips has been a mainstay for Gareth Southgate, winning England\u2019s player of the year award last season, but has been forced to pull out of the latest squad, for Friday\u2019s game in Milan and the Germans\u2019 visit a week on Monday.  Surgery is thought to be a strong consideration for the City midfielder, who was absent for his team\u2019s 3-0 victory at Wolves on Saturday. The 26-year-old has had a stop-start beginning to his time at the Etihad Stadium following a \u00a342m move from Leeds. Phillips has made three appearances for City this season, the last of which was a late cameo off the bench in the victory against Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday. He is yet to start a game under Pep Guardiola. Phillips previously missed about a month at Leeds because of a shoulder complaint. It is unclear if Southgate will call up a replacement after being left with four orthodox midfielders in his squad: Declan Rice, Mason Mount, Jude Bellingham and James Ward-Prowse. Brentford\u2019s Ivan Toney received his first call up and Tottenham\u2019s Eric Dier was recalled. "

                    "body": "Guardian writers\u2019 predicted position 12th (NB: this is not necessarily Ed Aarons\u2019s prediction but the average of our writers\u2019 tips)\nLast season\u2019s position 9th\nOdds to win the league (via Oddschecker) 250-1\nProspects\nThe mood on the south coast is understandably positive after last season\u2019s record-breaking campaign under the shrewd Graham Potter, even if there could be some tinkering required at the Amex. Brighton achieved their highest ever top-flight finish (ninth), picked up 10 more points (51) than their previous highest tally, scored more goals (42) than ever before in the Premier League and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 finished above Crystal Palace for the first time since being promoted in 2017.\n\nYet while the 4-0 drubbing of Manchester United at the start of May came in the middle of a purple patch to round off the season, it was Brighton\u2019s first home victory of 2022 as any hopes of securing European qualification slipped away in February and March. This time, Potter will know that finding a striker capable of scoring more than the nine goals top scorer Neal Maupay managed will be key to their chances of finishing higher.\nThe loss of Yves Bissouma from the midfield engine room after he joined Tottenham and potential departure of Marc Cucurella \u2013 the Spain left-back who won Players\u2019 Player and Player of the Season awards in his debut season \u2013 to Manchester City could be major blows, however. Mois\u00e9s Caicedo could be a ready-made replacement for Bissouma and Potter is likely to have to find other solutions from within his existing squad given that the only new additions at the time of writing are winger Simon Adingra and 18-year-old Paraguay forward Julio Enciso.\n\nThe manager\nThere must be quite a few clubs who rank Potter highly in their shortlists for potential future managers after watching his side\u2019s steady progression since he joined from Swansea in May 2019. But that is nothing compared to his popularity among Brighton fans, who were treated to a rare display of excitement from the usually mild-mannered 47-year-old from Solihull after their win over United back in May. Surrounded by supporters as he made his way to the car park and asked to sing a song, Potter surprised them by asking for quiet and shouting: \u201cSeeeaguuuullllssss\u201d at the top of his voice. \u201cI think I have shown emotion over the last three years and sometimes not in a good way,\u201d he later reflected. \u201cBut sometimes it\u2019s nice to walk through them and act like a bit of an idiot.\u201d\n\nTransfer coup\nBrighton\u2019s knack for scouting the best young talent in South America has already borne fruit with the signings of promising Ecuador midfielder Caicedo and Argentina international Alexis Mac Allister and there are high hopes that Enciso will be the next success story. The 18-year-old who operates mainly as a wide forward on the right flank and scored 11 goals for Club Libertad in the Paraguayan top flight last season could be sent out on loan initially but expect him to compete for a first team spot in the near future.\nWorld Cup impact\nTariq Lamptey\u2019s decision to play for Ghana took the potential number of players who will be at the World Cup to around half of Graham Potter\u2019s squad, although several face a fight for their places before November. Japan winger Kaoru Mitoma could become a regular after spending last season on loan in Belgium, while prolific German striker Deniz Undav may fancy his chances too following his goalscoring exploits at Union Saint-Gilloise \u2013 whose majority shareholder is Brighton owner Tony Bloom.\n\nAlternative attractions during World Cup\nThe beach is a definite no-no in November but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t enjoy the delights of Brighton\u2019s famous Palace Pier. In 2017, it was the most visited tourist attraction outside London with more than four million taking in the views and sea air.\nLeading the shirt sales\nLeandro Trossard enjoyed his most productive season since his arrival on the south coast in 2019, scoring eight goals in the Premier League and capping that off with two more for Belgium in their 6-1 thrashing of Poland in June. The 27-year-old is entering the final year of his contract, although Brighton retain an option to extend that by another 12 months. Should he continue his excellent form all the way to the World Cup in Qatar, Brighton can expect much more interest in the man from Maasmechelen.\nSocial climber\nAlireza Jahanbakhsh\u2019s departure to Feyenoord last summer with the Iran forward\u2019s 1.8m followers left a vacancy at the top of Brighton\u2019s Instagram rankings. The stylish Cucurella (240,000) \u2013 check out the patterns on his blue shirt and shorts combo from last month during his holidays in Mykonos \u2013 is a frequent poster and seems to have appeared in many of his teammates\u2019 posts as well during the pre-season trip to Portugal. But then he too may leave this summer \u2026\n\nIf Brighton were a Netflix doc \u2026\nTony Bloom\u2019s role in transforming his hometown club into Premier League mainstays since taking over in 2009 is worthy of a Hollywood script already. But imagine if the man who earned his nickname of \u201cThe Lizard\u201d as a member of the winning British team in the Poker Nations Cup could take Brighton all the way into Europe under the unassuming Potter?"

                    "body": "Mould-breaking rugby players, male or female, are pretty rare. By almost any measure, though, England\u2019s Sarah Bern is different. As a teenager she once aspired to be a downhill skier and sporting orthodoxy has never grabbed her. The result is a one-of-a-kind athlete with the ability, when the Women\u2019s Rugby World Cup kicks off next month, to illuminate the gloomiest of autumns. England\u2019s 32-player squad for the tournament will be unveiled on Tuesday and if there is anyone on the list guaranteed to give it everything it is the 25-year-old Bern. Powerful tighthead props are not supposed to score long-range tries from halfway or sidestep like sevens players but, in her mind, if feels entirely normal. \u201cIt probably excites me more because people are always going: \u2018Oh, you\u2019re a prop.\u2019 They probably don\u2019t look at bigger players and think: \u2018They\u2019re going to enjoy running in open field.\u2019 I always have done.\u201d  It is asking a lot for the Red Roses to nudge the saintly Lionesses off their new perch as the nation\u2019s sporting darlings. But having now gone a world-record 25 Tests unbeaten, the dynamic Bern and her teammates clearly have a great chance to shift the dial in terms of how their sport is perceived. The 73-7 hammering of Wales in Wednesday\u2019s final warm-up game was merely the latest sign of their gathering momentum. Nor is the world-class Bern the type to ease up with a job half done. \u201cI\u2019ve always been very driven. I\u2019ll never do anything half-hearted, I\u2019m not a person who really has a middle ground. For me, it\u2019s all or nothing.\u2019 Hence her brief flirtation with skiing. \u201cI really wanted to become a downhill skier. I absolutely loved zooming down the piste and I wanted to see if I could combine it with rugby.\u201d By her early teens her Scottish father, Graeme, was growing tired of finishing second in their informal races. \u201cHe said: \u2018Right, we can\u2019t race any more because you keep winning.\u2019\u201d These days, though, Bern would recommend rugby to anyone, regardless of size, shape or background. For any youngsters looking to overcome body confidence issues, she is also an instinctive ally. \u201cMy two sisters, who are 10 years older than me, are both tiny little size 8s and around 5ft 2in tall. They were very much into ballet, fashion and art. I\u2019m into all of those as well but dance was too delicate for me.\u201d Instead Bern is living proof that a love of musical theatre \u2013 \u201cI just saw Moulin Rouge, I absolutely love Dreamgirls\u2019 \u2013 and a professional sporting lifestyle can happily co-exist. Having learned the game at London Irish and Esher, the 91kg (14st 3lb)-Bern switched from the back-row to prop and can often be found in the gym dead-lifting up to 165kg. \u201cIf you\u2019re involved in sport, you do sometimes think: \u2018I look absolutely huge.\u2019 When you go into town you do feel a little bit bigger. But here, playing rugby, you feel absolutely normal. You\u2019re used to bigger people.\u201d  The more blinkered corners of the internet, sadly, do not always appreciate ultra fit, muscular sportswomen capable of shifting plenty of tin. While Bern, who first represented England aged 18, has had a few sexist comments lobbed at her on social media, she refuses to give ground to the haters. \u201cYou\u2019re always going to have people who have their opinion online. That\u2019s society and, unfortunately, women are always being pushed into having to look and behave a certain way. \u201cI still think those kind of archaic views are there but I think it is definitely changing. If we can inspire people to be healthy, fit and strong, then great. What\u2019s important is being happy and being able to do what you love doing. All the guys don\u2019t look the same and they\u2019re still seen as top-class athletes.\u201d With 46 caps to her name, there is no doubting Bern\u2019s pedigree, nor her driven nature. Her father played volleyball for Scotland but at school in Esher she preferred athletics, basketball and netball. \u2018My mum and dad never really pushed me. It was more a case of \u2018I want to try this\u2019 and then \u2018I want to be really good at it.\u2019 \u201cI struggled when I was younger with reading and writing. Because I never wanted to do badly in any test I\u2019d have to put a lot of extra effort in away from school. I think that\u2019s where that drive comes from. You\u2019ve got to keep working, you can\u2019t just put your feet up. It\u2019s just carried through in my life.\u201d Bern also enjoys feeling more settled in Bristol nowadays, having moved frequently in her youth. \u201cWe\u2019d live in run-down, small houses and Dad would do them up while we lived in them. We moved loads. I\u2019d come home and find an oven on the floor and no walls in the kitchen. I\u2019d be like: \u2018So are we going to eat in the pub tonight?\u2019 Now I love organisation. I can\u2019t live in building sites.\u201d Her resilience was also recently tested by almost a year out recuperating from a serious shoulder injury, to the point where she wondered if she would ever fully recover. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do a press-up for ages. It was the last bit I needed to tick off and it caused me so much pain. For me as a tighthead it\u2019s vitally important to use that shoulder, to rotate in and use it for the bind. You get to the point when you think: \u2018What is the point? I\u2019m never going to be able to do that again.\u2019\u201d Which is why no one is more alert to the significant opportunity now awaiting both her and England. Expectations are sky high but the players sound ready. \u201cIf something\u2019s not good enough it won\u2019t necessarily be the coaches who say so. It\u2019ll probably be a player first. We never sit in a meeting patting ourselves on the back. We\u2019re always looking at how we can can be better.\u201d And, if the need arises, even the free-spirited, sevens-loving Bern will be quite happy to grind opposing scrums into the Kiwi grass if required. \u201cIt\u2019s such a chess game and it\u2019s such hard work. As much as I love running in space there is no better feeling.\u201d Aside, perhaps, from hoisting the World Cup skywards on 12 November."

                    "body": "Good morning.\nChinese health officials have announced a drive to accelerate vaccinations of older people against Covid, as police patrolled several cities to stamp out the protests against the country\u2019s strict zero-Covid policy.\nLow vaccination rates among older people are one of the hurdles to easing the zero-Covid policy, which has eroded economic growth, disrupted the lives of millions, and sparked three days of unprecedented protests.\nThe display of civil disobedience has triggered a firm response from police, who have begun inquiries into some of the people who gathered at the weekend.\n\nWhy is China still having severe lockdowns? In what could be read as a rare criticism of the country\u2019s health system, a recent comment article published in China\u2019s state-run People\u2019s Daily quoted a pharmaceuticals analyst as saying that a full reopening might \u201cthreaten a health system that currently has far fewer ICU beds than those of other developed countries\u201d.\n\n\nBiden asks US Congress to block railroad strike that could \u2018devastate economy\u2019\n\nFour rail unions that represent more than half of the 115,000 workers in the industry have rejected the deals that Biden helped broker before the original strike deadline in September and are back at the table trying to work out new agreements.\nEight other unions have approved their five-year deals with the railroads and are in the process of getting back pay for their workers for the 24% raises that are retroactive to 2020.\nCongress has the power to impose contract terms on the workers, but it\u2019s not clear what lawmakers might include if they do. They could also force the negotiations to continue into the new year.\n\nHow a potential US rail strike could affect the economy. Consumers and nearly every industry in the US will be affected if freight trains grind to a halt next month amid rail union concerns about demanding schedules and the lack of paid sick time.\n\nArizona secretary of state sues after Republican officials refuse to certify county election results\n\nRepublican officials in a rural Arizona county have refused to certify the results of the 2022 midterm election, despite no evidence of anything wrong with the count from earlier this month.\nSome officials who have embraced voter fraud theories held out, defying a state deadline and setting the stage for a legal battle.\nThe move came amid pressure from prominent Republicans to reject results showing Democrats winning top races, and the county was holding out in the afternoon of a nail-biting day that was the deadline for several counties to confirm results.\nIn a lawsuit yesterday, the secretary of state, Katie Hobbs, a Democrat who narrowly won the race for governor, asked a judge to order county officials to canvass the election, which she said was an obligation under Arizona law.\n\nWhat\u2019s next? The two Republican county supervisors delayed the canvass vote until hearing once more about concerns over the certification of ballot tabulators, though election officials have repeatedly said the equipment is properly approved.\n\nGiving Tuesday: help us raise $1m to cover crucial issues in 2023\nFrom reporting on abortion rights and the climate crisis to publishing agenda-setting investigations, we already know what our new year\u2019s resolutions are \u2013 but we need your help.\nIn a letter to readers today, the new Guardian US editor Betsy Reed lays out some of our key priorities for 2023, and why your donations are so important.\n\u201cAt this moment of jeopardy for democratic values, we don\u2019t settle for milquetoast, down-the-middle journalism that engages in false equivalence in the name of neutrality,\u201d she writes.\n\u201cWe know there is a right and a wrong side in the fight against racism and climate destruction and for democracy and reproductive justice.\u201cRather than relying on billionaire owners or pursuing profits to appease shareholders, we depend on support from readers.\nYour donations are the reason we are able to carry on with our work.\u201cIf you can, please consider a gift to fund our reporting in 2023.

Rather predictably, much of the talk has been about the political background to the game rather than the playing abilities of two fairly unspectacular teams.\nOn Monday, Iran manager Carlos Queiroz brought up school shootings in the US following criticisms of human rights in Iran. Later in the day, a slightly puzzled US coach Gregg Berhalter, who thought he was going to talk about his team\u2019s lack of a natural goalscorer, was questioned by Iranian journalists on everything from his country\u2019s inflation rates to its immigration policy. \u201cI\u2019m not well versed on international politics. I\u2019m a football coach,\u201d pleaded Berhalter.\nThe game itself kicks off at 2pm ET (you can follow it with our liveblog here) and most experts believe the US have a 50-50 chance of progressing. In the day\u2019s other games, England only need to avoid a heavy loss to Wales (also at 2pm ET) to go through, while the Netherlands, Ecuador and Senegal will qualify for the next round if they win (the latter three kick off at 10am ET). Two of the tournament\u2019s heavyweights, Brazil and Portugal, qualified after their victories on Monday.\nElsewhere at the World Cup:\n\nAfter dominating the first weekend of the World Cup with a monologue as lengthy as it was bizarre, Fifa president Gianni Infantino has kept a low-profile. As the Guardian\u2019s chief sports writer, Barney Ronay, puts it: \u201cNobody puts Gianni in the corner. Except, it would seem, Hassan Abdullah al-Thawadi, chief executive of Qatar 2022, who some say is having a significant final pass on key details that affect supporters, federations [and] world football generally.\u201d\nA protester ran on to the field during Portugal\u2019s match with Uruguay on Monday. The man held a rainbow flag and a shirt saying saying \u201cRespect For Iranian Women\u201d.\nIf you\u2019re wondering why World Cup players are wearing strange face masks on the pitch, then wonder no more.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this: inside the palace coup that brought Saudi Arabia\u2019s MBS to power\n\nAfter King Salman commenced his reign, his nephew Prince Mohammed bin Nayef had been made crown prince at the age of 55, putting him next in line to the throne. But simmering behind the scenes was a vicious rivalry between Nayef and his upstart cousin, the king\u2019s son, Mohammed bin Salman, or MBS as he is known, who rose from obscurity to become deputy crown prince, writes Anuj Chopra.\nNayef was allegedly confined to a room for hours, pressured to sign a resignation letter and pledge allegiance to MBS. At first, he refused. According to one source close to the prince, he was told that if he did not give up his claim to the throne, his female family members would be raped. Nayef\u2019s medication for hypertension and diabetes was withheld.\nClimate check: top-flight recovery: the inspiring comeback of the California condor\n\nDespite being the largest flying bird in North America, with a wingspan of up to three metres, you would have been hard pushed to see a California condor in the wild in the 1980s, writes Patrick Greenfield. In a last-ditch effort to save the birds, after decades of persecution and population collapse, the few remaining were captured in 1987 for a multimillion-dollar intensive conservation programme.\nToday, there are more than 200 in the wild, and local people are already starting to notice. In May 2021, about 10% of the entire population of the birds in the Golden State decided to roost on a woman\u2019s home in Tehachapi, southern California, damaging her decking with \u201cconcrete-like\u201d excrement, an incident that went viral on Twitter when her daughter posted photos.\nLast Thing: are Tesla owners paying the price for Musk hate?\n\nTesla lost at least one customer this weekend, after Alyssa Milano tweeted that she had returned her model for a Volkswagen electric vehicle, prompting jokes from Elon Musk and conservative commentators about the German manufacturer\u2019s Nazi origin story. Milano said she had ditched Tesla due to Musk\u2019s ownership of Twitter, writes Alaina Demopolous.\nAlthough there\u2019s no official data to prove that Tesla drivers get more hate, an Axios report from August found that Iowa\u2019s \u201cTesla drivers are routinely heckled, cut off in traffic, and blocked from charging stations.\u201d Many put the blame on the company\u2019s CEO, Musk, and the never-ending news cycle devoted to his frenzied Twitter takeover.\nSign up\n\nFirst Thing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.

                    "body": "It is many mornings after the night before and the eve of what Graham Arnold hopes will be their greatest night of all \u2013 although Buenos Aires 1993 might take some beating. \u201cI was talking about that in the car on the way here,\u201d Australia\u2019s head coach says. \u201cIt\u2019s one of my great memories.\u201d Back then, as a striker sporting a magnificent mullet and a moustache, he faced Diego Maradona for a place at the World Cup; 29 years on, the team he leads face Lionel Messi for a place in the quarter-finals for the first time in the country\u2019s history.\n\u201cWhen I think back to my playing career, that\u2019s one of the highlights of my life: to be able to play the qualifiers against Argentina in Australia and Buenos Aires but I\u2019ve had a few highlights with Argentina,\u201d Arnold says. \u201cWe beat them in the 1988 Gold Cup and with the Olympic team only last year. I just think they bring the best out of us and we go into tomorrow with a lot of belief and a lot of energy: it\u2019s a big one. The name resonates around the world, as a footballing nation. It\u2019s inspiring for Australia to play them.\u201d\n\nPerhaps no night resonates quite like 93, for now at least, and Arnold is not the only link between that match and this one. The parallels between Messi and Maradona are irresistible too. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy how similar they are to each other,\u201d Arnold says.\n\nBack then, they met in Sydney at the end of October and in Buenos Aires in mid-November. Arnold played up front for Australia, Gabriel Batistuta in attack for Argentina. Maradona was just behind. He was also playing his first competitive international since the final in 1990, called out of retirement to rescue a team in crisis.\n\u201cI clearly remember that we weren\u2019t expecting to play Argentina,\u201d Arnold says. \u201cThey had been beaten 5-1 at home by Colombia. Maradona had retired and put on a lot of weight and in the last five, 10 minutes the fans were singing for him to come back. He lost a lot of weight in six weeks and came back. He set up the goal in the first game. I\u2019m not sure that he had that much influence but you couldn\u2019t even get near him to kick him, he was that smart. Such a great footballer, and to be able to say that I played against him is great.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just Maradona. At left-back was a tough, ginger-haired defender from Boca Juniors called Carlos Javier \u201cColorado\u201d Mac Allister, called into the team after that catastrophic defeat to Colombia. You may recognise the name. Invited to the Casa Rosada to meet Argentina\u2019s president N\u00e9stor Kirchner in 2005, Colorado [meaning ginger, reddish, as in the Colorado mountains] Mac Allister, who was born in the Pampas but has Irish and Scottish ancestors, would become involved with the centre right PRO party and eventually go on to serve as sports secretary in the Argentinian government. Three days ago he was at Stadium 974 in Doha with his sons Kevin and Francis, who are footballers, to watch his other son, Alexis, score his first goal for Argentina. Alexis too got the \u2018Colo\u2019 nickname \u2013 until Messi told teammates that he didn\u2019t like it and to stop calling him that.\nThe first game in 1993 finished 1-1, the second 1-0 to Argentina, sending them to the World Cup. It was the last international Mac Allister played. Afterwards, he had appeared on television naked \u2013 local TV even got fined for it \u2013 but that was not the reason that his international career was limited to those two meetings with Australia and a friendly against Germany wedged between them. Instead, he believes it was because of a Boca-River cl\u00e1sico in which Ariel Ortega said \u201che tried to kill me\u201d. Ortega went to the US that summer; Mac Allister didn\u2019t. There, of course, the secret of Maradona\u2019s slim-fast plan was revealed.\n\nMaradona had been impressed by the reception in Australia \u2013 so much so that he had promised to ensure their national anthem would not be booed when they got to Buenos Aires, and he was as good as his word. Despite defeat, he had also been impressed by how they had played, and made aware of how little they earned. Earlier that evening Paul Wade and Ra\u00fal Blanco were invited on to Argentinian TV. During the show, the phone in the studio rang, Argentina\u2019s captain calling in to congratulate them on how they had played. \u201cYour tears of sadness will be tears of joy someday soon,\u201d he said.\nVery soon, as it turned out. That night, the Australian players were called down to the hotel lobby. A fleet of taxis were waiting to take them for a night out they would never forget, courtesy of Maradona. So just how good was it? Arnold laughs. \u201cI haven\u2019t got all day,\u201d he says. After all, there\u2019s another game to prepare, another story to write. Argentina again, the country that bring out the best in them."

                    "body": "Good morning. The basketball player Brittney Griner has returned to the US after she was freed from a Russian prison in a dramatic high-level prisoner exchange for the notorious arms dealer Viktor Bout, the so-called Merchant of Death, who had been held in an American prison for 12 years. Joe Biden, who had made Griner\u2019s release a top priority after she spent almost 10 months in jail on drug charges, said in an address from the White House that he found her \u201cin good spirits\u201d when speaking after the swap in Abu Dhabi. \u201cShe\u2019s safe, she\u2019s on a plane, she\u2019s on her way home after months of being unjustly detained in Russia, held under intolerable circumstances,\u201d the president said yesterday. \u201cBrittney will soon be back in the arms of her loved ones, and she should have been there all along.\u201d But Biden expressed regret the deal did not include Paul Whelan, a Michigan corporate security executive jailed since December 2018 on espionage charges that his family and the US government deny.  Where is Griner now? She has touched down at a Texas airbase. Footage emerged of the exchange of Griner for Bout on the grounds of Abu Dhabi\u2019s airport; the Financial Times reported it was shot by Russia\u2019s FSB security service. What did Biden say about Whelan? The president said: \u201cSadly, for totally illegitimate reasons, Russia is treating Paul\u2019s case differently than Brittney\u2019s. And while we have not yet succeeded in securing Paul\u2019s release, we are not giving up. We will never give up.\u201d  Women sue Twitter, claiming Musk layoffs unfairly targeted female staff  Elon Musk is facing yet more legal trouble. Two women who lost their jobs at Twitter during mass layoffs after the billionaire took over the company are suing, claiming that the company disproportionately targeted female employees for cuts. The discrimination lawsuit is the latest in a series of legal challenges to hit the company after Musk, the world\u2019s richest person, bought the company for $44bn and set about making swift, drastic changes including laying off around half its workforce, or roughly 3,700 employees. Hundreds more subsequently resigned. The new suit, filed on Wednesday in San Francisco federal court, said that Twitter had laid off 57% of its female workers compared with 47% of men. The gender disparity was more stark for engineering roles, where 63% of women lost their jobs compared with 48% of men, according to the lawsuit. Shannon Liss-Riordan, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said women \u201chad targets on their backs\u201d once Musk acquired the company, regardless of their talent and contributions.  What other legal troubles does Musk face? Other cases include allegations Twitter laid off employees and contractors without the advance notice required by law and failed to pay promised severance, and that Musk forced out workers with disabilities by refusing to allow remote work and calling on employees to be more \u201chardcore\u201d. Twitter is also under investigation by city officials in San Francisco after a complaint about beds being set up in the office.  Georgia girl, 12, killed by father after family court grants him custody  A Tennessee grandmother who fought for custody of her late daughter\u2019s child but lost out to the girl\u2019s father was left grieving and angry after the man murdered her granddaughter. Monica Dunning is holding up the shooting death of her 12-year-old granddaughter, Angel Ahearn, as devastating evidence that the US family court system is broken, the Tennessee news outlet WBIR reported. Angel\u2019s mother died in a car crash in Monroe county, Tennessee, in 2016. Dunning subsequently pushed to be named her granddaughter\u2019s guardian. But the girl spent time in several foster homes before her father, Leonard Ahearn, gained custody of her. According to Dunning, her daughter was divorced from Ahearn at the time of her death, and there had been allegations of abuse, which led to a court order that prevented him from seeing Angel.  What happened when Angel died? On 17 October, authorities say, Ahearn was arguing with a 34-year-old woman when he grabbed a pistol and shot her, his daughter and himself. First responders arrived to find Angel dead and the two adults badly wounded. Ahearn died after he and the woman were taken to hospital.  In other news \u2026   In New Zealand, a baby who was placed in his doctors\u2019 care because his parents refused to consent to a transfusion of \u201cvaccinated blood\u201d for the operation has had life-saving surgery, the parents\u2019 lawyer has said. The six-month-old is doing well after the court lets doctors perform heart surgery against the wishes of the parents. Global shares and the price of some key commodities have risen on hopes that the easing of China\u2019s strict zero-Covid measures would help to bring down inflation, even as some experts warned that the country was not prepared to live with the disease. The US justice department is seeking a top federal judge to hold Donald Trump\u2019s political office in contempt of court for not fully complying with a grand jury subpoena issued in May demanding the return of all classified documents in its possession, according to a source familiar with the matter. Maxwell Frost, the Florida Democrat who made history last month as the first Gen Z congressman-elect, made waves on social media yesterday after tweeting that he was struggling to find somewhere to live in Washington. Frost says he incurred debt from his campaign and had poor credit. A Conservative MP has said he is planning to bring forward UK legislation in an attempt to strip the Duke and Duchess of Sussex of their royal titles. Bob Seely told the PA news agency he could propose the short private member\u2019s bill early next year in an attempt to amend the 1917 Titles Deprivation Act.  US readers: would you like to talk to someone with a different political view?  Where do you stand on healthcare, policing or stricter gun control? Have you ever wanted to try to persuade someone with a different view? Dining across the divide is a regular Guardian column, where we send two people who have opposing political views out for dinner. The aim is to find out whether meeting in person over a meal can bridge divides. So far we have organised dinner dates only within the UK but now we are putting together a special American edition of the series. We are interested in hearing from adults from every part of the US who are open to meeting and discussing opposing views with another reader. Find out how to apply here. World Cup 2022: And then there were eight  The World Cup quarter-finals start today. First up, at 10am ET, is Croatia v Brazil. The Brazilians were dazzling in their 4-1 dismantling of South Korea in the previous round, while Croatia squeaked past Japan after a penalty shootout. At 2pm ET is Argentina v Netherlands, a rivalry that goes back nearly 50 years. In the teams\u2019 last World Cup meeting, the 2014 semi-final, Argentina won on penalties. \u201cWe have a score to settle,\u201d said the Netherlands coach, Louis van Gaal, who was in charge in 2014 and still does not like to think about the match. In Saturday\u2019s matches Morocco, the last African team left in the tournament, will take on Portugal (10am ET), with a marquee match-up between England and France at 2pm ET. The Guardian will have live coverage, analysis and match reports from every game. Elsewhere at the World Cup  The chief executive of the Qatar World Cup has been condemned by human rights groups for saying \u201cdeath is a natural part of life \u2013 whether it\u2019s at work, whether it\u2019s in your sleep\u201d, when asked about a migrant worker\u2019s death at the tournament. Rumors of discontent in the Portugal camp continue to grow. The Portuguese Football Federation has denied that Cristiano Ronaldo, the greatest player in the team\u2019s history, threatened to walk out of the tournament. The 37-year-old was benched for this week\u2019s win over Switzerland after reacting badly to a substitution in Portugal\u2019s previous match. Ronaldo may find it hard to argue with the decision: his replacement, Gon\u00e7alo Ramos, scored a hat-trick against the Swiss.  Stat of the day: Group shaping US nutrition receives millions from big food industry  Newly released documents show an influential group that helps shape US food policy and steers consumers toward nutritional products has financial ties to the world\u2019s largest processed food companies. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics accepted at least $15m from corporate and organizational contributors from 2011-17, and more than $4.5m in additional funding went to the academy\u2019s foundation. Among the highest contributions came from companies including Nestl\u00e9, PepsiCo, Hershey, Kellogg\u2019s, General Mills, Conagra, the National Dairy Council and the baby formula producer Abbott Nutrition. Don\u2019t miss this: The inherent misogyny of AI portraits \u2013 Amelia Earhart rendered naked on a bed  Officially, the Lensa AI app creates \u201cmagic avatars\u201d that turn a user\u2019s selfies into lushly stylized works of art, writes Alaina Demopoulos. It\u2019s been touted by celebrities such as Chance the Rapper, Tommy Dorfman, Jennifer Love Hewitt and Britney Spears\u2019 husband, Sam Asghari. But for many women the app does more than just spit out a pretty picture: the final results are highly sexualized, padding women\u2019s breasts and turning their bodies into hourglass physiques. To test the software, the Guardian uploaded images of three different famous feminists: Betty Friedan, Shirley Chisholm and Amelia Earhart, who was rendered naked, leaning on to what appeared to be a bed. Climate check: Rising temperatures causing distress to foetuses, study reveals  Rising temperatures driven by climate breakdown are causing distress to the fetuses of pregnant farmers, who are among the worst affected by global heating. A study revealed that the fetuses of women working in fields in the Gambia showed concerning rises in heart rates and reductions in the blood flow to the placenta as conditions became hotter. The women, who do much of the agricultural labour and work throughout pregnancy, told the scientists that temperatures had noticeably increased in the past decade. There is already strong evidence that extreme heat leads to increases in stillbirths, premature births and low birth weights. Last thing: California girl given first-ever unicorn license  A girl named Madeline, with a vivid imagination and remarkable awareness of how bureaucracy can dash dreams, got her wish when she asked Los Angeles animal control authorities for a license to own a unicorn \u2013 if she\u2019s able to find one. The first-of-its-kind permit came with strings attached, however: the mythical creature must be provided ample exposure to sunlight, moonbeams and rainbows, be fed watermelon at least once a week and have its horn polished at least once a month with a soft cloth, and any sparkles or glitter sprinkled on the animal must be nontoxic and biodegradable.

                    "body": "In Doha, the World Cup is Lionel Messi. Or, Lionel Messi is the World Cup. It\u2019s hard to tell which at this point \u2013 the city is saturated with him. Messi is the face of billboards and the blue and white of flags. He is rip-off merch and dodgy Photoshop jobs, and every second No 10 shirt in the streets (hi, Diego).\nLast Tuesday he was the \u201cWhere\u2019s Messi\u201d chants of Saudi Arabia fans at the Metro, and on Saturday the honks of car horns when he scored against Mexico. On Wednesday \u2013 even after missing a penalty against Poland \u2013 he was cheered from the stands made of 974 shipping containers.\n\nMessi is not even short in this country \u2013 he is as tall as the skyscrapers digitally enhanced with his super-sized goal celebration. He is, after all, Qatar\u2019s luxury brand: Paris Saint-Germain. He is Indian and Nepalese and Sri Lankan, too, and especially Bangladeshi. He is also, counterintuitively, Saudi Arabian.\nDoha is so Messi right now it is almost satirical. And maybe it sort of is \u2013 he has won the Ballon d\u2019Or seven times, but not a single World Cup. That is why this tournament is all about him. Why Argentina must go all the way for their 35-year-old GOAT who now has everything except the most glorious of sendoffs.\nIt is also why an Australian defender is sharing his devilish plot to foil the grand plan, but also being a bit nice about it too, because it\u2019s Messi. \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d says Milo\u0161 Degenek, \u201cI am a big fan of his. But I\u2019d love to win the World Cup probably more than [I\u2019d love] him to win the World Cup.\u201d\nDegenek would have been right behind Argentina to go all the way for their captain and talisman, except that Australia now have to face them in the round of 16. \u201cThey\u2019re obviously driven by the motivation that it could be Messi\u2019s last World Cup, and he wants to win it and end on a high,\u201d Degenek says. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s to stop that.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always loved Messi. I think he\u2019s the greatest to ever play the game. [But] it\u2019s not an honour to play against him, because he\u2019s just a human, as we all are. It\u2019s an honour to be in the round of 16 of a World Cup. Whether we played Argentina or Poland, it still would\u2019ve been an honour to represent Australia in the round of 16 of a World Cup.\u201d\n\nThe fact the Socceroos are here at all is something of sporting folklore in Australia. Wednesday\u2019s upset of Denmark did the unthinkable, and now all bets are off \u2013 even against the world\u2019s third-ranked nation and its irresistible playmaker who has betrayed no signs he will bow out quietly.\nArgentina have their eyes fixed on a quarter-final date with either the Netherlands or United States. That is how this story goes \u2013 everyone is saying it. Except, that is, for the 38th-ranked Australians, who love a good dose of external doubt to see them through.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a difficult game,\u201d says Degenek. \u201cObviously we\u2019ll be playing against probably the best footballer ever to grace the game. Apart from that, it\u2019s 11 against 11. There\u2019s not 11 Messis, there\u2019s one. We know their squad is full of stars \u2013 [Paulo] Dybala is on the bench and [Lautaro] Mart\u00ednez comes off the bench, so it\u2019s a squad that\u2019s immaculate.\u201d\n\nThe numbers around the market value of each of these squads have been crunched elsewhere, but suffice to say there is something of a disparity. Australia\u2019s main well of strength in this most unexpected of campaigns has been the collective. A star team not a team of stars, as they say. How that stacks up to a team of stars who, until last week, were unbeaten in 36 games, will not become clear until Saturday night (Sunday morning AEDT) at Ahmad bin Ali Stadium.\nBut surely there is a plan for Messi? \u201cWe\u2019ll get him in the tunnel,\u201d says head coach Graham Arnold. \u201cNo, sorry, that was a joke. But the thing is, if you focus too much on Messi you forget about the other players. I think [Poland] focused too much on Messi. Nearest player, pick him up. It can\u2019t be just one, and it\u2019s not just about stopping Messi \u2013 they\u2019ve also got some very good players as well.\u201d\n\nThe Socceroos \u2013 before their history-making back-to-back wins and clean sheets against Tunisia and Denmark \u2013 endured a chastening tournament-opener against France, who have their own PSG super-brand in Kylian Mbapp\u00e9. Arnold chalked that 4-1 loss off as a \u201cfriendly\u201d, a learning experience.\n\u201cObviously this one can\u2019t be classified as a friendly,\u201d Degenek says. \u201cFrance [are] probably the favourites at the World Cup at the moment with the players they have. But I think Argentina, after their first loss, have just turned up another level, decided to play to the best of their abilities, and come into every game with a determination to win.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve learned a lot from the France game. We showed them a bit of respect in that first game, and I think [Argentina] will be a completely different game. But it\u2019s two completely different styles of football \u2013 France play one way, Argentina will play a different way.\u201d"

                    "body": "Good morning. Autumn is such a special season: crunchy leaves on the ground, pumpkin spice lattes, and devastating fiscal events. Today Jeremy Hunt will mark the latter in the House of Commons, standing up to deliver a delayed corrective to the brief reign of Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng that the government hopes will put the public finances on an even keel and set the Conservatives on a better path to the next election. With \u00a355bn in cuts and tax rises expected, that looks a very tall order \u2013 and critics of the government argue that this kind of tightening is exactly the wrong way out of the current crisis. Later this morning, Hunt will set out the specifics of a new era of austerity by telling parliament: \u201cWe will face into the storm.\u201d Today\u2019s newsletter is your essential guide to some miserable November weather. Five big stories  US politics | Republicans have won back control of the House of Representatives, scraping victory from a midterms election that many had expected to be a red wave of wins but which instead turned into more of a trickle. Myanmar | Almost 6,000 people will be released from prison in Myanmar, with Britain\u2019s former ambassador Vicky Bowman among those to be freed, junta-controlled media has said. Thousands more remain political prisoners in the country, where the military seized back control in a coup last year. Politics | Dominic Raab has formally requested an investigation into his conduct after two complaints were made alleging he had bullied staff. The justice secretary denies the allegations, saying \u201cI am confident that I have behaved professionally throughout\u201d. Ukraine | Ukraine\u2019s air defence was probably responsible for a blast that killed two people in south-eastern Poland, the Polish president has said. As fears eased of a military escalation, Nato said Russia was ultimately to blame as Moscow had started the war. Crime | The actor Kevin Spacey is to be charged with seven more sexual offences against one man between 2001 and 2004. Spacey appeared at the Old Bailey in July to deny five other allegations relating to three men.  In depth: Tax rises, spending cuts and more \u2013 what you need to know before Hunt speaks  *** The backdrop: inflation up, recession expected, growth down Jeremy Hunt won\u2019t have been pleased by Wednesday\u2019s inflation figures, but they do at least reinforce the story he and Rishi Sunak are telling about the autumn statement as necessary economic medicine. At 11.1%, the annual inflation rate is now at a 41-year high. Meanwhile, the legacy of Liz Truss\u2019s disastrous tenure is a forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility that the UK\u2019s annual borrowing will be about \u00a3100bn by 2026-27 \u2013 \u00a370bn higher than previously expected. The OBR is expected to slash its growth forecast today, too. The total impact of the measures Hunt will announce to plug the \u201cfiscal black hole\u201d, described by Labour as \u201cAusterity 2.0\u201d, is expected to amount to about \u00a355bn a year. (That notorious black hole is a heavily contested metaphor: more on why below.) As well as seeing national debt falling, Larry Elliott writes that Hunt wants the impact of his autumn statement to be measured by what happens to inflation because \u201che knows it is going to fall anyway\u201d. (Inflation measures the change year-on-year, so by spring, the price rises caused by the war in Ukraine will no longer be captured in the annual figures.) For a fuller explanation of the economic headwinds, see Richard Partington\u2019s useful guide in five charts. And for a sense of the human cost, see Jessica Murray\u2019s piece on a mothers\u2019 support network in Stoke-on-Trent. \u201cWe used to get about 10 new families a week; last Saturday we had 22 referrals in one day, and then it went up to 32 the following day,\u201d says the group\u2019s founder, Laura Carter. *** Spending cuts: public sector pay, schools, high-speed rail under threat Deep breath. Hunt will begin to seek a \u00a325bn to \u00a330bn reduction in public spending by denying departments new money to cover the impact of inflation. That may mean real-term public sector pay cuts. He will also ask them to make efficiency savings to protect frontline services, though there is not much fat left to trim: an October report from the Institute for Government and the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accounting (CIPFA) said that the \u201cvery few easy and genuine efficiencies\u201d were picked off in the 2010s. Further ahead, planned spending rises may be cut from 3.7% to 0.5% in 2025 \u2013 after the next election \u2013 and there could be cuts to unprotected areas like schools and the police. The chancellor is also expected to postpone for at least two years the introduction of a cap on the amount people in England will pay for social care in their old age, a measure promised by Boris Johnson in 2021. The government has said that all spending on big infrastructure projects is under review. Northern Powerhouse Rail, incorporating a new high-speed line from Manchester to Leeds, appears to be most under threat. The other big change is to the energy support scheme. Hunt is expected to announce that the price cap will rise so that the amount paid by an average household goes from \u00a32,500 to over \u00a33,000 a year from April. To soften that blow and bring bills down in the long term, he will also set out details of a major energy efficiency programme. *** Tax rises: frozen thresholds, council tax increases, new windfall taxes  Hunt has ruled out headline increases in income tax, national insurance, and VAT. But that doesn\u2019t mean that there won\u2019t be painful real-terms changes. The Treasury has been considering freezing tax thresholds in many areas so that wage inflation will cause more people to pay the higher rates, with income tax bands expected to be frozen until 2028. The amount at which inheritance tax starts to be paid will also be frozen until 2028. Meanwhile, the threshold at which people start paying the top 45p tax rate may be reduced to \u00a3125,000. We are also likely to see increases in the limit on council tax, with the amount local authorities are allowed to put tax up without a referendum expected to go from 2% to as much as 5%. And it has been reported that electric cars could be taxed for the first time. There\u2019s more. Alex Lawson reported this week that electricity generation companies could face a new 40% windfall tax, which could sit alongside an increase in the existing windfall tax on North Sea gas and oil from 25% to 35%, extended to 2028. Dividend tax relief, capital gains tax thresholds, and tax relief on pensions for higher rate earners could also be targeted. All in all, tax increases could amount to around \u00a325bn a year. *** Protection: minimum wage, triple lock, benefits While the overall thrust of the budget will inevitably be felt most severely by the worst-off, Hunt and Sunak are keen to show that they are doing what they can to fulfil Sunak\u2019s promise of a \u201cfair and compassionate\u201d approach. So there will reportedly be an increase in the minimum wage for over-23s from \u00a39.50 to \u00a310.40 to offset inflation, and 8m households will receive cost of living payments of \u00a3650 that could rise to \u00a31,100 for older people with disabilities. While there have been hints that the pension \u201ctriple lock\u201d is under threat, Sunak strongly hinted on Monday that it would be kept in place. And benefits are also likely to rise in line with inflation next year. *** Criticisms: is there really a \u2018black hole\u2019? All of the measures Hunt will set out are predicated on the theory of a \u201cblack hole\u201d in the public finances \u2013 an image which creates a powerful sense that if it is not plugged, the UK economy will be dragged in and destroyed. But many left-of-centre economists disagree strongly with that view. In an opinion piece this morning, James Meadway argues that the black hole, defined as the amount the government needs to save to get public debt falling as a share of GDP within five years, is not a \u201chard economic fact\u201d but an \u201cinsubstantial statistical artefact\u201d, and that filling it will make stagflation \u2013 the dangerous combination of high inflation and recession \u2013 more likely. Heather Stewart and Larry Elliott\u2019s piece from Tuesday explains a range of alternatives to renewed austerity involving temporary spending increases.

                    "body": "Lucy Bronze has credited her 2019 World Cup semi-final heartbreak with teaching her that \u201ceven when you\u2019re at your best things can always go wrong\u201d. Reflecting on England\u2019s 2-1 defeat by the USA in France before England\u2019s fourth major semi-final in a row, Bronze said: \u201c[That year] was one of my best years. Not only in an England shirt but just in general.  \u201cEvery time I was on the pitch I felt like I couldn\u2019t do much wrong. To be on that high and to be at the top of my game, to be one of the best players in the world and have that dream of winning the World Cup ... then, I was playing in France, which was the country that I was living in at the time, in the stadium that I lived right next door to, it was kind of what dreams are made of.\u201d Bronze sat on the grass of Lyon\u2019s Groupama Stadium, her face stained with tears, after the final whistle. \u201cIt probably hit me a lot harder than others because I guess when you\u2019re in the best form of your life, that\u2019s when you just feel like this is your time,\u201d she said.  \u201cBut I think that World Cup probably taught me more than anything else that even when you\u2019re at your best things can always go wrong. And that\u2019s probably why I\u2019m a lot more cool, calm and collected now, because I\u2019ve been at those very high heights and still being knocked down. It\u2019s a feeling that I don\u2019t particularly enjoy being reminded about. It\u2019s something that I learned a lot from. It\u2019s a huge experience and I try and share it with the girls and with the players I\u2019m playing with.\u201d So far the journey to the semi\u2011finals of the Euros has been fairly straightforward, bar a tough quarter-final fightback against Spain. England, who face Sweden at Bramall Lane on Tuesday night, have come through the tournament relatively unscathed and that, Bronze believes, is the difference between this semi-final and the others that the Lionesses have played in. \u201cIn previous semi-finals we\u2019ve had other things to deal with,\u201d said the full-back. \u201cWhether that was players missing games through injuries or suspensions or what have you, it shook the team a little bit. I know that in all three semi-finals I\u2019ve played in we\u2019ve had to make changes going in that I don\u2019t think managers would have wanted to make. \u201cTouch wood, at the minute everything is going the way it should. Everybody finished the game fine, I know Keira [Walsh] came off with cramp, we\u2019ve finished with one yellow card for a small bit of time-wasting \u2013 those kinds of things seem to be going our way at this tournament, which is probably a little bit different.\u201d  Winning a major trophy with England is the big empty box on Bronze\u2019s career checklist, with the defender having already won all domestic honours in England and France as well as three Champions League titles with Lyon. \u201cA lot of people ask what my motivation is when I\u2019m playing, because I\u2019ve won a lot of trophies both in a team and individually,\u201d she said. \u201cEngland\u2019s always been my biggest focus and my entire career I\u2019ve wanted to lift a trophy for England and there\u2019s lifting a European Championship in your home country \u2013lifting the World Cup is probably the only thing that\u2019s equal to that. [This Euros is] a huge opportunity, I know, to tick that box off.\u201d"

The step back up to seven furlongs should not be an issue and she can give Piechulek his first winner in Britain.\nAscot 2.10 King Of Stars has an obvious chance on his run over course and distance last month and Takeshi Yokoyama will not need to worry unduly about tactics on this confirmed front-runner.\nHaydock 2.25 Having missed the 2021 season entirely, Electrical Storm has started making up for lost time this summer and his third in a strong race at Sandown in early July gives him every chance of a second win of the campaign here.\n\nAscot 2.45 Super Superjack is edging up the weights but his close second at Glorious Goodwood last month suggests another success is not beyond him at a track where he has winning form.\nHaydock 3.00 Grocer Jack bolted up on his debut for William Haggas last month and anything close to that form will make him very tough to beat.\nAscot 3.20 After four straight wins, The Whipmaster was only second to a fast-improving rival last time but the third horse home was 14 lengths away and he still has scope from his new mark.\nNewmarket 3.40 Lakota Sioux\u2019s habit of flashing her tail while racing is a little off-putting but it does not seem to affect her performance and her two-and-a-half length third in the Chesham Stakes last time is the strongest form in this Group Three contest.\nAscot 3.55 Dettori has a big chance on front-running Isla Kai, who goes well at this track and finished sixth in the Hunt Cup in June.\n\nThe Curragh 4.15 An excellent renewal of the Phoenix Stakes with Bradsell, the Coventry Stakes winner, fancied to extend his unbeaten record and give Hollie Doyle her third Group One of the summer.\nAscot 4.30 Hamaki has a steadily progressive profile and looks ready for this step up to 12 furlongs.\nAscot 5.05 The first and fourth horses home in the valuable three-year-old sprint handicap at Newmarket\u2019s July meeting went in next time out and Admiral D, the runner-up there, can follow suit."

I\u2019ll bid you farewell for now but Paul Williams has a match report on the way which will expand on the state of play between now and the World Cup. Fifty-six days to go.  Updated at 6.05am BST    6.02am    Mitch Duke, who is currently playing in Japan for Fagiano Okayama, says \u201cGraham Arnold has some hard decisions now\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m 31 now and this is my only opportunity to be on the plane to a World Cup and play a part,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was my motivation. I feel like I did OK to win more opportunities and hopefully I get the final selection.\u201d     6.01am    Wonder what Arnold will take from those two matches. From two entirely different line-ups, he must decide which 26 players he takes to Qatar 2022. Captain Mat Leckie is speaking with Network 10. \u201cOverall the playing group is a very inexperienced team in terms of caps,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you see how much energy these young boys have, and we need them to perform at this level because they\u2019re the type of players that are going to be the future for us. \u201cI\u2019m sure he [Arnold] has got a lot of thinking to do over the next couple of months. I think this camp\u2019s been great. A lot of new boys. And they\u2019ve been very professional and showed that they want to be here.\u201d     5.55am   Full-time! New Zealand 0-2 Australia  90+3 mins Duke attempts one final assault but the referee blows his whistle and that is that for the two-match international series. Duke and Cummings had the goals at Eden Park and, despite that flat opening half, what we saw in the second was genuinely pleasing.     5.52am    90+2 mins Just as I\u2019ve written that Ben Old is in Australia\u2019s danger zone and circling, looking to finish with a flourish, steal a consolation as stoppage-time ticks down. Deng makes the clearance.     5.51am    91 mins Bell floats a free-kick from halfway towards an Australian third with numbers behind the ball. It\u2019s the Kiwis now who can\u2019t seem to fashion an opening. Redmayne is again trying to quieten his team. He releases the ball up field, Kuol finds Cummings in space and he dribbles down the left for another cutback and another decent chance.     5.49am    88 mins Kuol makes another raid, down the left and with sublime ease. The substitutions have disrupted the All Whites, shaken up the rhythm of the match. Kuol is at the top of the box and shifts the ball wide for King who makes a cutback his teammates can\u2019t finish. And now Kuol creates another chance out of nothing and has a shot in the goalmouth but at an acute angle. He takes a little too long to pull the trigger and Michael Boxall has it covered.     5.46am    84 mins Tuiloma takes a free-kick at the halfway line and Australia wallop the ball down into the corner near the Kiwi goal. Leckie is on the run and his first touch is excellent but the ball is back and forth on the right flank and neither team can keep possession.     5.44am   Goal! New Zealand 0-2 Australia  80 mins Can he score on debut? Yes he can. It\u2019s emphatic, too, slightly to the right as Sail dives to the left. That was some passage of play, some goal-mouth scramble. This second half is so much more fun.     5.41am    79 mins Everyone is everywhere in the midfield at the moment. Cummings makes his way into promising areas but NZ dart off on the counter courtesy of Grieve. And now Kuol is off. He\u2019s on his own and with a fantastic turn of pace, without a hint of effort evades Storm Roux and taps the ball back in play before unleashing a delightful ball in that McGree gets to but it takes a deflection. Cummings has another crack and it smacks into Cacace\u2019s hand before McGree has another go that rattles the inside of the crossbar and bobbles out. But the Socceroos have a penalty and Cummings will do the honours.  Updated at 5.43am BST    5.37am    75 mins Applause as Reid takes his leave, in his final international appearance after a fruitful career. A tifo offers thanks. For some reason my enduring memory of him is of a visit to Wembley for West Ham\u2019s 2012 Championship play-off final against Blackpool, which they won at the death.     5.34am    73 mins Some decent chat from the Kiwi crowd behind Australia\u2019s goal just as none other than Kuol. He is 18. He has not started an A-League match for Central Coast but scored four times off from nine substitute appearances. His eye-catching display against Barcelona has fuelled intense speculation about a move to Newcastle United, among other clubs, and this could be his chance to make himself a World Cup bolter.     5.31am    70 mins Chance! NZ almost equalise as Delbridge, in possession, smacks the ball into Waine. It rebounds to Grieve, who shoots and almost scores. Tilio goes into the book for a crunching challenge on Waine, and it\u2019s fair enough. And here he is, the man you\u2019ve all been waiting for. Jason Cummings. The Scotland-born forward known to himself as \u2018Cumdog\u2019.      5.27am    67 mins Strain goes straight in for Cacace and eventually blown for a foul, just before a loooong ball is dealt with by Redmayne. Redders is copping words from Alex Greive, who has just been subbed on for Just.     5.24am    64 mins Genreau\u2019s pass is picked off by Garbett and Deng has to track back to intervene. But the Socceroos maintain their high line and it\u2019s keeping the All Whites at bay. The subs are coming! Ryan Strain, Cam Devlin and Jason Cummings are ready and waiting for their triple international debut. Genreau, Atkinson and Duke take their leave.     5.20am    60 mins The Socceroos have their tails up now. Tilio is making himself readily available, suddenly more akin to the real Tilio. He engages in a one-two with Duke before McGree swishes wide to Leckie.     5.18am    57 mins Tilio finds Metcalfe behind him and they gradually shift the ball back to the defensive line, ready for the next attack. King wants a part of this one and races off on the overlap for a half-chance.     5.16am   Goal! New Zealand 0-1 Australia  54 mins This is much better from Australia. More intent. Wonder what Arnold said at the break. Joel King has the ball on the left flank and Connor Metcalfe is quick to it. A pinpoint cross is beautifully met by Duke\u2019s head. It is Duke\u2019s eighth international goal and it gives his side the advantage they need.     5.13am    52 mins Genreau is scampering forward again, this way and that, evading Bell who mixes up his feet. Just picks up a pass but the Socceroos regain possession. McGree pushes the ball to Tilio with his left foot and the latter, at the top of the box, barrels it towards goal in a much more convincing fashion than that first-half shot.     5.10am   Second half, let's go!  48 mins New Zealand get started straight away on the first attack of the second 45. When will the first substitutions be made? Who will they be? Genreau has a free-kick and he takes it with his replaced boots. It floats in and is spat back out and Australia recycle until Sail gathers the ball.     5.02am    That was \u2026 interesting. A couple of bright spots for Australia but errors abound and profligacy like what we just witnessed will do the team no favours against World Cup group-stage opponents like France and Denmark. Moments must be capitalised upon, chances taken. If this friendly is a training-ground run for younger players then let\u2019s see Garang Kuol get a chance off the bench in not too long.     4.51am   Half-time! New Zealand 0-0 Australia  45+1 mins That was an inexplicable miss. Tilio is a talented player and he won\u2019t be happy with that as both teams head to the sheds as square at the break.     4.49am    45 mins Metcalfe does a bright bit of work in the middle with an intercept before heading the ball down towards Duke, who races to the right of the area. He could shoot himself but instead tees up Tilio closer to the penalty spot. He has to bury this from here. But he fluffs his line and oh that\u2019s difficult to watch. There will be one minute of added time.     4.48am    43 mins Wayne has been up and about, and a through ball nearly falls neatly for him in the area only to be cleared in the nick of time. But Just is the man who could decide this match. And he has a chance on a plate here as the ball falls to him in front of goal. He takes a shot and sends it well over the crossbar. Redmayne is giving his teammates the signal to calm down.     4.44am    39 mins As it stands, says Andy Harper on commentary, the All Whites are better prepared for the World Cup than the Socceroos, and they are not the ones who have qualified. The midfield have struggled to make their mark and they\u2019re defending to get to half-time without conceding.     4.38am    35 mins Wood has made an early exit with an injury sustained in an earlier tackle, in a blow to the Newcastle United forward. Ben Wayne takes his place, and slips during a challenge in chase of a lofted All Whites ball in the Socceroos\u2019 half.  Updated at 4.38am BST    4.35am    33 mins This is a challenge for Australia. Aside from Leckie\u2019s early half-chance the traffic has mostly been one-way. The visitors are finding themselves forced to retreat in order to move forward but space is at a minimum. Genreau, Duke, Leckie, are all stopped in their tracks just as Genreau takes a seat to assess hit boot, which appears to have been torn in half (or thereabouts).     4.32am    29 mins They shift the ball around for a wee before a whopping long ball across field has Matthew Garbett in chase. Deng times his tackle perfectly. It\u2019s a big one, though, and Garbett hits the turf with some force.     4.29am    26 mins Atkinson is back on the field, which is relieving for the Hearts defender not too far from the start of the Scottish Premiership season. Denis Genreau and Connor Metcalfe are covering some metres in the midfield trying to cut off NZ\u2019s supply. Australia have a throw-in but Marco Tilio is promptly shut down by Reid and Marko Stamenic has possession.     4.26am    23 mins After that little be may already be looking at a bit of stoppage-time in this first half. The All Whites are having fun on the break thus far, and this foray ends with the ball at the feet of Just, who whips a speculative cross into the box. There are numbers in there to turn this into a goal but Redmayne is on it like I was on the Mars Bars yesterday and he\u2019s smothered the ball with his body before Wood can get a touch.     4.22am    19 mins Atkinson has hit the deck after a challenge on Elijah Just, one of the standouts in Thursday\u2019s first friendly. Trainers are on the pitch checking out his knee and help him to the sideline, where he runs off from a jog. It is less than 24 hours since the All Blacks humiliated the Wallabies on this very same pitch and, although it appears in pretty decent nick considering, the Network 10 coverage is pointing out a few potentially problematic divets.     4.19am    15 mins Riley McGree is injected himself into the contest with ease. He is on the move through a very busy midfield and looks as if he\u2019s about to take a stab at goal. He is the scorpion king, after all. He can hit them from distance. He winds back the right leg as his teammates stream forward but his shot is straight into the gloves of Oliver Sail.      4.17am    12 mins We\u2019re getting a reminder of the delicate skill of Liberato Cacace, who tees up Chris Wood at the left byline. That time it is dealt with easily but the Italy-based former Wellington Phoenix star steers the ball back himself, teasing Atkinson before attempting a cross not met by any other men in white.     4.14am    10 mins Atkinson finds Leckie, who attempts with varying degrees of success to evade his marker. NZ have different ideas though. Payne is doing well early to keep the ball in play when needed but Australia utilising the right side.     4.09am    6 mins The All Whites outmuscled Australia on Thursday, a night marking the Socceroos\u2019 centenary. They will attempt to do so again here, but nice early signs from the green and gold (and a turquoise Redmayne). Leckie is dispossessed but retrieves the ball and dribbles it into the box, passing back for McGree who shifts it further back to the midfield. A reset.     4.06am   Peep! First half is under way  3 mins I did say we were close to kick-off, did I not? I just mentioned Redmayne, and he has made a swashbuckling run off his line to collect the ball and start a new phase of attack. Delbridge is on the move. A lot of change in possession in the opening exchanges.     4.02am    For context on the youth of this Socceroos XI, eight of them were at the Tokyo Olympics \u2013 an under-23 tournament. This guy, though, has been around a while \u2026  Andrew Redmayne is the starting goalkeeper.     3.58am    I just mentioned the senior Australian players who have already departed. Here they are in full: Aziz Behich, Ajdin Hrustic, Jackson Irvine, Fran Karacic, Awer Mabil, Jamie Maclaren, Aaron Mooy, Mathew Ryan, Trent Sainsbury, Adam Taggart. This could be a disaster or a lovely surprise. Regardless, a few younger chaps will be playing for a ticket to Qatar come November.     3.56am    The All Whites, meanwhile, have made only a couple of changes in their first home match in nearly five (5) years. The big inclusion is of the retiring Winston Reid, who will captain the team for his send-off, the former West Ham defender leading the All Whites out against the very same team he made his debut. Albeit, this is not quite the World Cup send-off he might have imagined but Costa Rica put paid to that. Bill Tuiloma, who plays for Portland Timbers in the MLS, also gets the nod.      3.54am    Your humble blogger has been diverted with other work matters today and kick-off is already creeping up. But let\u2019s take a brief look at the line-ups because there have been CHANGES. Particularly to Australia\u2019s starting line-up. Eleven, to be exact, with most of the senior players returning to their clubs. Let\u2019s treat this as a test of depth, then. Coach Graham Arnold has given Harrison Delbridge a debut alongside Thomas Deng in central defence, flanked by Nathaniel Atkinson and Joel King. Mat Leckie will captain from the win while Mitch Duke leads the line.      3.45am   Preamble  Good afternoon and welcome to live coverage of this, the Socceroos\u2019 final match (so far as we know) before the World Cup. Three days ago in Brisbane, Awer Mabil scored the only goal against the All Whites in an otherwise unconvincing performance. What can they show supporters in the rematch across the ditch in Auckland?  "

                    "body": "It was a Christmas Ben Chilwell will certainly never forget. Sidelined with a partial rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee during Chelsea\u2019s Champions League victory against Juventus a month earlier, the left-back was close to making his return to action when disaster struck. \u201cThe plan was for me to watch the boys on Boxing Day and train with the group that didn\u2019t play on the 27th,\u201d Chilwell remembers at Chelsea\u2019s Cobham training ground. \u201cBut Christmas Day I was doing a session on that pitch [he points over his shoulder] and just felt it go again. I planted my foot in a rehab session on the grass and my knee buckled again. It wasn\u2019t as painful but it was the same feeling I had against Juventus and I knew: \u2018I can\u2019t go through my career going through this every month.\u2019\u201d  Despite the setback, the 25\u2011year\u2011old defender\u2019s swift recovery from surgery meant he was able to return as a substitute in the victory against Watford on the final day of last season. He is targeting a starting spot in England\u2019s World Cup team in Qatar. \u201cIn my head I was 100% ready to get back into it in January but I was always quite good with adversity,\u201d he says. \u201cIn my head the surgery was done, just crack on with the rehab, get stronger, fitter; it will improve me mental-strength wise and just come back for pre-season, flying, ready to go. Obviously this season with Chelsea and the World Cup as well were big motivations to really do everything, those little one per cents that maybe I wouldn\u2019t have done, to push myself and make sure that when I come back I was even better than before.\u201d It was at Leicester, whom he joined as a 12-year-old after playing for the youth team at Rushden &amp; Diamonds, where he believes he learned such resilience.  \u201cI was the last person at Leicester to get a scholarship and had to work a lot harder than everyone else to get it,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was when I was doing runs around the park with my dad. The next season I was youth-team captain within six months and training with the first team. That was adversity but it showed me that if you do work hard that you can get there.\u201d Chilwell is relishing meeting up with the rest of the squad again as they embark on their tour to the US but there is no doubt things have changed markedly at Chelsea in the six months since his injury. Todd Boehly has led a purchase of the club from Roman Abramovich, and the departure of the defensive linchpin Antonio R\u00fcdiger and a lack of signings mean there is still an air of uncertainty as the new era begins.  \u201cI think everyone from the outside presumes it\u2019s going to be difficult for us as the players and staff,\u201d says Chilwell. \u201cBut we literally know as much as you guys. We just focus on what we\u2019re doing which, last season, could have been a very good end to the season with the cup finals and stuff. It doesn\u2019t really get spoken about.\u201d Of R\u00fcdiger, he says: \u201cOf course he\u2019s going to be difficult to replace. Toni was one of the most influential players in the team last year, not just for his performances on the pitch, which were amazing week in, week out. Around the training ground, then the dressing room before games making sure that everyone keeps their standards \u2013 I\u2019ve only got good things to say about Toni. I think Chelsea will always have a place in his heart. But it was probably a dream for him to move to Madrid so good luck to him.\u201d Chilwell was in regular conversation with Thomas Tuchel as he completed his rehabilitation, and Gareth Southgate was in touch to keep an eye on his progress with the World Cup on the horizon. Chilwell was forced to self-isolate at Euro 2020 after he was deemed to have been in close contact with Billy Gilmour in the period before the Scotland midfielder tested positive for Covid and he did not make an appearance in England\u2019s run to the final. He is determined to make up for lost time and make the left-back slot his own.  \u201cThat\u2019s 100% my aim, of course,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve dreamt of playing in a World Cup since I can remember and to know it\u2019s just around the corner is more motivation than you can know to try and seal that spot down. Not just for myself but for my family \u2013 especially after the Euros in what was a difficult time for me. \u201cIf I could go to the World Cup as the number-one left-back, have a good tournament as a team and we do really well and go all the way, that would be amazing. It would be the highlight not just of my career but for my life, so over the next three or four months I\u2019m just going to do everything that I can to try and make sure that is my spot.\u201d"

Experts say chilling videos posted by the couple at the centre of the deadly Queensland shooting have sparked conspiracy theories about the tragedy being a \u201ccover-up\u201d or \u201cfalse flag\u201d event. Conspiracists have spent countless hours on encrypted apps and online forums for more than a week, attempting to present an alternative reality of the shooting that left two officers and a neighbour dead. It is a technique often used following a violent event to shy \u201caway from the uncomfortable truth\u201d, experts say.\nTwo Melbourne Victory fans have been banned for life after the weekend pitch invasion, and we also look back on Australia\u2019s year of living forgetfully, the sporting highlights and how to celebrate Gravy Day.\nAustralia\n\n\nBanks \u2018disgraceful\u2019 | The promoter of Azealia Banks\u2019s chaotic tour has called her behaviour \u201cdisgraceful\u201d, alleging she was always late and showed a \u201clack of care\u201d towards fans.

                    "body": "Iran\u2019s footballers could face reprisals if they fail to sing the national anthem in their remaining World Cup group games, after a politician said the country \u201cwill never allow anyone to insult our anthem\u201d.\nThe football team stayed silent while the anthem was played before their 6-2 defeat to England on Monday, in a symbolic show of support for the protest movement that has roiled Iran since the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody in September.\nTeam Melli, as the national team is known, had previously drawn criticism from protesters for even competing in Qatar, and footage of them bowing in front of President Ebrahim Raisi at a send-off meeting drew more anger.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mehdi Chamran, the chairman of Tehran city council, said: \u201cWe will never allow anyone to insult our anthem and flag. Iranian civilisation has a history of several thousand years, this civilisation is as old as the total of European and American civilisations.\u201d\nA conservative MP in Kurdistan, meanwhile, called for the national team to be replaced by faithful and revolutionary youth willing to sing their national anthem.\nIran\u2019s heavily censored media made very little mention of the team not singing the national anthem.\nKayhan, probably the newspaper closest to supreme leader Ali Khamenei, vented its fury at the way in which protesters had cheered an English victory, saying \u201cfor weeks foreign media had conducted ruthless and unprecedented psychological-media war against this team\u201d.\n\u201cThis campaign did not spare any effort to create a gap between the people of Iran and the members of the Iranian national football team, as well as producing false dichotomies,\u201d it said, adding that \u201cthis political-media movement, mainly Londoners, with the support and coordination of local patriots, from movie and sports celebrities to chain media and Telegram channels, and even reformist political figures, have joined hands to attack the players\u201d.\nIt said the Portuguese-born head coach, Carlos Queiroz, had accused critics at the post-match press conference of trying to destroy the team\u2019s morale. \u201cI have to tell those who do not want to support the national team that it is better to stay at home, no one needs them,\u201d it reported him as saying.\nThe revolt against the national team was demonstrated with videos showing crowds on the streets hailing the England victory and chanting \u201cDeath to the dictator\u201d during the match. A restaurant in Tehran that had backed England on its Instagram page was shut and sealed by the authorities on Tuesday.\nIn an interview with the reformist newspaper Etemaad, Ali Latifi, a former Iranian national team striker, said the team had fallen between two stools, neither saying they only wanted to discuss football nor wholeheartedly supporting the protests, and as a result had satisfied no one. \u201cWhen some spectators boo, the team suffers,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though it was not broadcast on the radio, the players hear it and it affects their mood.\u201d He also blamed negative coaching tactics that he said had instilled fear in the players.\nIn late September, the team opted to wear black jackets to cover the country\u2019s colours in their friendly against Senegal.\nInside Iran, the cycle of protests, repression, funerals, internet shutdowns and strikes have continued. The most intense protests are currently in Iranian Kurdistan, where the human rights group Hengaw reported that seven people had been killed since Sunday in Javanroud alone and that the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps had started using heavy military armoury and live ammunition to quell the protests.\nThousands of Kurds on Tuesday attended the funeral of a 16-year-old-boy, Karwan Shukri, killed the previous night in Piranshahr.\n\nHeavy censorship of the Iranian media was illustrated this week by the authorities closing Jahan Sanat newspaper after it published an interview in which a famous former university professor questioned the official line that 10-year-old Kian Pirfalak, shot in the chest while in a car in Izeh in the east of the oil-rich Khuzestan province, was killed last week by \u201cterrorists\u201d, and not by the security forces. \nThe newspaper\u2019s manager and the journalist responsible for the piece were summoned by the Tehran prosecutor\u2019s office. They are among a wide group of people including actors and reformist politicians who have been summoned to explain recent remarks suggesting the government had not been telling the truth.\nKian\u2019s mother initially blamed the security forces for his death, but later retracted the comments in what appeared to have been a forced TV appearance. The boy\u2019s father remains in hospital with serious gunshot wounds."

                    "body": "Eddie Jones has apologised and taken \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for a dismal defeat by South Africa, which made it England\u2019s worst calendar year since 2008, with the World Cup looming into view. In echoes of the 2019 World Cup final, Jones\u2019s side were outgunned by the Springboks, who dominated the scrum and the aerial battle and cantered to a 27-13 victory despite losing Thomas du Toit to a second-half red card.  As a result, England end their autumn campaign with one win from four matches \u2013 against Japan \u2013 and with only five victories in their 12 matches in 2022, their worst return in 14 years. Rather than turn on his players, however, Jones sought to shoulder the blame for the toothless performance at Twickenham and claimed the defeat could prove a \u201cwatershed\u201d moment for his side, with just nine Tests remaining before the World Cup begins in France next year. \u201cWe didn\u2019t play well today and I apologise for that. It is entirely my fault and I take full responsibility,\u201d said Jones. \u201cWe are judged by results but I feel there is growth in the team which wasn\u2019t evident today. We don\u2019t want to get beaten by a big score by South Africa and don\u2019t want to have the worst record since 2008, so I accept full responsibility for that. \u201cI think it is a bit of a watershed game for us and we came into the game with high expectations on how we wanted to play on the back of Japan and New Zealand. In this game South Africa were a bit too tough in the scrum and the air and I know where we have to improve. \u201cAre we moving in the right direction towards the World Cup? Yes we are. I don\u2019t care what other people think. Obviously, we are disappointed with our performance but there are 11 months to the World Cup and I have no doubt we will rise to the occasion. We just didn\u2019t fire a shot as we wanted today. You have to win contests against the Springboks and we didn\u2019t win the air or the set piece. We lost two of the key contests and we have to improve in those areas.\u201d  Victory ends a mixed campaign for South Africa, after defeats by Ireland and France, but rounds off a trying month in which their director of rugby, Rassie Erasmus, was again banned for his outbursts on social media. Earlier in the day SA Rugby finally made an official statement on Erasmus, revealing he had met the World Rugby chief executive, Alan Gilpin, and that they had held \u201cpositive discussions\u201d regarding communication with match officials. Despite his absence, South Africa were dominant, with the head coach, Jacques Nienaber, proclaiming a \u201cspecial\u201d win \u2013 the Springboks\u2019 first over England at Twickenham for eight years. \u201cThere were a couple of special wins this year but we haven\u2019t got a result here since 2014, it\u2019s a tough place to get a result, it was very special,\u201d he said. \u201cThe forwards were outstanding and the backs used the opportunities when they got the platform. They laid a nice foundation for the backs to have a go.\u201d"

                    "body": "It has been an extraordinary year, so extraordinary, in fact, it required a new word to sum it up: \u201cpermacrisis\u201d. This entered the Guardian\u2019s lexicon for the first time in March, an apt word for the annus horribilis that was 2022. \u201cPermacrisis\u201d went on to become Collins Dictionary\u2019s word of the year and was one of several that broke through, while others gained fresh significance. A trawl of words used by this newspaper for the first time and examples of the uncommonly common \u2013 lesser-used words and terms frequently repeated due to a running story \u2013 also tells the tale of 2022 and points to the news cycles that informed our reporting. The year began with the terms \u201cPartygate\u201d, \u201clockdown-busting\u201d, \u201crule-breaking\u201d and \u201c(Sue) Gray\u201d dominating the most commonly used uncommon words in January, marking the fallout from Downing Street parties held during lockdown. In February, the word \u201cscurrilous\u201d came to the fore after Boris Johnson\u2019s longstanding policy chief Munira Mirza used it to describe the then prime minister\u2019s behaviour when he falsely linked Keir Starmer to the failure to bring the paedophile Jimmy Savile to justice. After the Russian invasion of Ukraine at the end of February, March was notable for the start of the horror for Ukrainians, with several placenames \u2013 Kharkiv, Bucha, Odesa, Mariupol, Kyiv, Kherson and others \u2013 appearing with distressing frequency. The invasion also led to #IStandWithUkraine appearing on the website. The #IStandWith hashtag later joined \u201cgoblin mode\u201d and \u201cmetaverse\u201d as Oxford\u2019s top three words of the year. Given the events that preceded it, the first use of the term \u201cpermacrisis\u201d in the Guardian was particularly apt, in a headline on an article advising parents on how to talk to children about troubling world events. Politics was never far from the news. Rishi Sunak\u2019s wife, Akshata Murthy, had previously been the subject of Guardian reports connected to her \u201cnon-dom\u201d status, and she was in the headlines again in April after a leak led to her confirming her use of the tax loophole. In May, every headline writer\u2019s dream term rocketed in popularity again when the \u201cWagatha Christie\u201d trial opened in London\u2019s high court, with Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy taking the stand.  When news broke in June that a Google AI researcher had been suspended after claiming that the company\u2019s flagship text generation chatbot had become sentient, it pushed \u201csentient\u201d into the top 10 common uncommon words used on the Guardian website that month. It also introduced the acronym \u201cLaMDA\u201d to Guardian readers, with the unusual mix of capitals and lower-case letters distinguishing the bot\u2019s name from the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (Lamda, as per the Guardian stylebook). In July, it was not words but numbers that came to the fore, marking a month of heatwaves and record temperatures after the UK registered a maximum temperature over 40C, surpassing the previous record of 38.7C. August was a month of firsts, with two entirely new concepts appearing on the Guardian\u2019s pages. \u201cQuiet quitting\u201d is really just a term for doing the job you were hired to do, no more, no less, leaving on time and not taking out-of-hours emails and calls. The Observer explained it for the first time in August, as the term was going global, but it also merited an entire vignette in the Guardian\u2019s First Dog on the Moon. Another term that made its Guardian debut in August was \u201csplooting\u201d, when squirrels, dogs, cats, marmots and other mammals lie on their bellies \u2013 where there is less fur \u2013 on hot days to help them cool down.  September\u2019s lexicon was marked by the death of Queen Elizabeth II and the national mourning period of 10 days. The Queen\u2019s coffin was seen by millions around the world resting in Westminster Hall on a raised platform called a \u201ccatafalque\u201d \u2013 one of several words connected to the funeral and the monarchy that were used with far more frequency that month.  Later that month, the politics pages documented the rise and stupendous fall of Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng with mentions of the pair\u2019s disastrous \u201cmini-budget\u201d, a term that will surely haunt both individuals for years to come. Another scandal broke in November, when it was revealed that Manston, the asylum centre in Kent, was dangerously overcrowded. The centre opened in January 2022 and in November it was discovered to be housing 2.5 times more people than designed for. As football fans geared up for the World Cup in Qatar, a term more readily associated with fashion made an appearance on the Guardian\u2019s sports pages. The \u201cbucket hat\u201d went from the subject of a cheery feature on Welsh fans to a news story when rainbow versions of the hats were confiscated from fans entering Qatari stadiums amid the LGBTQ+ protests that marked the early stages of the tournament.  And finally, in December, viva magenta, described as an \u201caudacious\u201d shade of carmine red, made its debut as the colour that captured the zeitgeist of 2022. \u201cIt depicts optimism and joy,\u201d Leatrice Eiseman, the executive director of the Pantone Color Institute, said of the selection. \u201cAnd we know we are all greatly in need of that.\u201d Jonnie Robinson, the British Library\u2019s lead curator for spoken English, who compiles an annual blog with his favourite sports word of the year, said tracking word frequencies in this way clearly showed the \u201clexical innovation\u201d that marks the constant evolution of language. \u201cIt also reveals typical processes used when forming new words, like blending (eg perma[nent]+ crisis) and affixation (Party + the \u2018pseudo\u2019 suffix -gate), and captures the playful appeal of innovative forms like splooting required to describe new phenomena. \u201cHow well any of these forms endure remains to be seen, but their presence in the Guardian confirms and, no doubt, reinforced their prominence in popular discourse during 2022.\u201d  The words identified in this article were found by searching the Guardian API programatically for \u201csignificant terms\u201d and manual searches to find new words which appeared on Guardian\u2019s pages for the first time in 2022. \u201cSignificant terms\u201d were gathered by first creating a background to count the frequency of terms across all content available in the Guardian API, some of which date back as far as 1899, to present. A foreground query, which counts the frequency of terms in each subset (a given month, in a given section), was also carried out. Those terms that were a lot more frequent in the foreground set were considered \u201csignificant\u201d. "

                    "body": "It began in Basel, an era ago, with a Lionel Messi goal. Only Luka Modric will know whether it wound down, in this monstrous and dystopian supplement to Doha, with exactly the same thing. At the end there was a hug from an old clubmate, \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda; then a more meaningful conference, arm around the younger man\u2019s shoulder, with his dear friend Mateo Kovacic. Neither of them had been able to do quite enough this time and that is an achingly rare lament.\nModric and Croatia have long exceeded whatever should naturally be expected and, when the dust settles, they will know the same was true in Qatar. If his 81st\u2011minute departure turns out to have been a final action at this rarefied level, it was still some way to go.\nModric was not under the same pressure to win this tournament as Messi. \n\nCroatia are not Argentina, a point that was eventually pressed home here, and nor is there any demand on him to settle questions about all-time greatness. Falling short will sting but the past three weeks have served only to enhance an already unimpeachable legacy. The World Cup has seen few midfielders such as Modric; it has seen few small nations quite like Croatia; it has never seen a player harness the collective spirit and footballing knowhow of such a country and lead it to the top twice over.\nRunners-up in 2018, fourth place at worst here: finishes achieved in the winter of Modric\u2019s career with two sides that are different yet exactly the same. Both have played to his rhythm, been underpinned by the glances, sidesteps and half-movements that buy him room to call the tune. He and Messi are not so different these days, at least in their manipulation of space, and while this semi-final spiralled into a non-contest there was still something sublime in witnessing them stitching a game\u2019s fabric between them one last time.\nThey both had cause to remember the first, in March 2006, when a 20-year-old Modric made his Croatia debut and Messi, who was 18 and nearing the end of his breakthrough campaign with Barcelona, got off the mark for Argentina. Modric came out on the victorious side but, 16 and a half years later, he could not repeat the feat in Messi\u2019s cathedral. Even if this was not quite the swirling, vibrant cauldron of Argentina\u2019s previous visits to Lusail, the influx of more casual punters had, in many cases, draped themselves in light blue.\n\nThe occasion was everything this tournament has now become: primed for Messi to win. There was always the sense Croatia would, for all their best efforts, ultimately be the supporting act. \nThe frustration for Modric will be that, for just over half an hour, his celebrated midfield troupe had Argentina locked down. They were the better of two sides high on structure but deficient in attacking spark, Croatia\u2019s limitations made clear when Kovacic broke the lines three times only for nobody to go with him. \nModric had begun to play the hits: three whip-smart, angled passes in the opening 10 minutes; an easy, caressed ball round the corner to Kovacic as any surprise caused by Argentina\u2019s midfield diamond dissipated; a burst past Alexis Mac Allister, befitting a player in his sharpest years, that earned a corner.\nAt that point it was tactile, light but deadly serious football. During one of Croatia\u2019s warm-up drills he and Kovacic would pass back and forth before the chosen player sent a long diagonal out wide. For Modric, that inevitably meant deploying the kind of luscious outside\u2011of\u2011the\u2011boot switch he has made his own; his radar was on point from the beginning and, when a nutmeg was followed by another turn of pace that opened up Argentina\u2019s half, there was a sense he had the run of things.\n\nBut sport is savage. At this stage in its most gripping competition, it should never be anything else. That move ended with an Ivan Perisic chip that Croatia believed had been deflected for a corner, but Argentina were granted the restart and within moments a loose Modric touch had let Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez release Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez. A penalty; Messi; confirmation of the night\u2019s narrative; a slippery slope that soon became yet more treacherous. \nA minor error indirectly brought significant consequences but the bigger factor was that, in \u00c1lvarez, Argentina had the player capable of running in behind that Croatia sorely lacked.\nThere were to be no more miracles for Modric but he has already conjured plenty, by footballing deed and through the quiet authority that keeps this squad running at a disciplined, contented hum. Perhaps his late replacement by Lovro Majer was a changing of the guard; maybe it simply banks up a few more minutes for use when, shortly before he turns 39, the European Championship kicks off in Germany.\nAfter Croatia returned from Moscow four and a half years ago, Modric bought their players and support staff a Rolex watch each. There were around 50 in total and it was no attempt to be flashy: he was simply showing his appreciation for the setup, many of whose personnel had guided him through the previous decade and more, that had written a place in history. A glance at those timepieces this winter might have told a tale. Modric cannot hold back time forever but here, in a phenomenal last act on a world stage that became his own, he managed to make it stand still."

                    "body": "England\u2019s plans for next week\u2019s final Test against South Africa and for the Twenty20 World Cup that starts next month were thrown into disarray on Friday after Jonny Bairstow slipped while walking to a tee during a round of golf near his Yorkshire home and sustained a serious leg injury that is likely to rule him out of all cricket for the remainder of the year.\nThe precise nature of the injury, which occurred as Bairstow played at Pannal golf club just outside Harrogate, will become clear in the coming days, but the England camp fears that full scans will confirm a fracture when they are conducted early next week. \n\nNottinghamshire\u2019s Ben Duckett was immediately called up for the third Test against South Africa at the Oval, which starts next Thursday, while a replacement in the World Cup squad that had been announced only a matter of minutes before the injury occurred has not yet been decided. The deadline to submit a final squad for the tournament is 16 September.\nBairstow has been England\u2019s player of the summer, and was due to open the batting in Australia alongside Jos Buttler after selectors decided to jettison the out-of-form Jason Roy. Though his absence is a significant blow the squad announced on Friday includes several alternative openers including Dawid Malan, who has top-scored in this year\u2019s Hundred from the top of the order but had been pencilled in to bat at No 3 for the international side, and Phil Salt, who has opened with Buttler for Manchester Originals.\nOther options include Surrey\u2019s Will Jacks, who is in the squad travelling to Pakistan for seven T20s this month, while there will be renewed calls for Alex Hales to return to the international fold after an absence of more than three years. The 33-year-old, who opens with Malan for Trent Rockets, has had notable success in Australia in the past: he was the second-top scorer in the Big Bash League in 2019-20, and the top scorer in 2020-21.\nThe news could even lead to the quickest of recalls for Roy, whose miserable summer for club and country had ended with him being left out of England\u2019s squads both for Pakistan and for the World Cup. Having established himself as one of the world\u2019s most feared white-ball openers over an eight-year international career, Roy\u2019s claims to a place collapsed in the space of two months this summer as he averaged 12.66 in six T20s for England, and 8.5 in six appearances in the Hundred.\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate timing for Jason Roy as much as anything else. He\u2019s hit a bad patch of form at the worst time,\u201d said Rob Key, the managing director of England men\u2019s cricket, who revealed that Roy had sought assurances that his international career is not over. \u201cI certainly don\u2019t think the age that he is that this is the end of Jason Roy. I would argue that the 50-over format is his strongest suit and we still see him as very much part of this setup.\u201d\nChris Woakes and Mark Wood, who because of injuries have not played a T20 game of any kind since last year\u2019s World Cup semi-final defeat to New Zealand \u2013 or made a first-team appearance in any format since March \u2013 are included in both squads having recovered from knee and elbow complaints respectively. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to somehow make sure if they are our best options they are in rhythm and in form,\u201d Key said. \u201cIt\u2019s no good having them back if they\u2019re not able to perform to the best of their ability.\u201d\nKey revealed that Hales, who had featured prominently in discussions about Buttler\u2019s ideal opening partner, had contacted him to demand an explanation for his continued absence from England\u2019s squads. \u201cI much prefer when these people pick up the phone, as opposed to people who go behind the scenes moaning,\u201d Key said. \u201cIt\u2019s just an unfortunate time when there\u2019s a hell of a lot of very good players.\u201d\nOf the 15-man World Cup squad only Salt, Harry Brook and Ben Stokes were not also involved in last year\u2019s competition in the United Arab Emirates. It will be Buttler\u2019s first tournament as captain following Eoin Morgan\u2019s retirement from international cricket in June, and Key confirmed that he intends to keep wicket, having experimented at Manchester Originals this summer with captaining from the outfield.\n\nA 19-man group has been named for the historic visit to Pakistan, England\u2019s first for 17 years. Preparations have been complicated by the floods that have ravaged the country in recent weeks, but Key insisted that it was \u201ca trip we\u2019re desperate to go on and it\u2019s going to take a lot for us not to get out there\u201d.\nDespite being named in the World Cup squad Chris Jordan, Liam Livingstone and the travelling reserve Tymal Mills will remain in England to continue rehabilitation work on injuries, while Stokes will rest after the end of England\u2019s Test summer. Buttler\u2019s calf injury will keep him out of the early matches in Pakistan \u2013 when Moeen Ali will captain the side \u2013 but will not stop him travelling.\nFive players travel to Pakistan having not yet played a T20 for England, with the Kent batter Jordan Cox the youngest in the group at 21. The Warwickshire pace bowler Olly Stone, having already represented his country in Tests and ODIs, returns to the England set-up after a nightmare run of injuries during which he considered retiring from internationals at 28."

He is one of six uncapped players, including the NRL trio of Young, Herbie Farnworth and Victor Radley, all of whom impressed in last Friday\u2019s non-Test win over Fiji, in Shaun Wane\u2019s 19-man squad for the first match of the tournament.\nThe squad against a Samoan side rated as favourites by the bookies contains a mixture of youth and experience. It will also keep many guessing about certain aspects of the lineup at St James\u2019 Park. \nSt Helens\u2019 Jack Welsby is also in line to make his first Test appearance, with the Salford half-back Marc Sneyd and the Wigan forward Kai Pearce-Paul also included.\n\nOne clear selection dilemma for Wane has been resolved, with Young selected instead of Ryan Hall, who has scored 35 tries in 38 appearances for England. Young scored against Fiji and produced an eye-catching display.\nWane said earlier in the week he had settled on his half-back pairing for the opening game, but with Sneyd, Welsby and George Williams all in his squad, it is clear he intends on keeping Samoa guessing. Michael McIlorum is the sole hooker with Salford\u2019s Andy Ackers, another who caught the eye against Fiji, missing out.\nSam Tomkins will captain the side in his first World Cup appearance since 2013, having being left out for the 2017 tournament in Australia and New Zealand. He is one of five players with more than 20 Test caps, the others being the South Sydney forward Tom Burgess, Huddersfield\u2019s Chris Hill, Canberra\u2019s Elliott Whitehead and Salford\u2019s Kallum Watkins.\nEngland will be without another experienced forward as Wigan\u2019s John Bateman is serving the final game of a three-match suspension.\n\nA crowd approaching 45,000 is expected and organisers are confident an opening-day attendance record will be set with the reigning champions, Australia, playing Fiji Saturday evening in Leeds."

                    "body": "It\u2019s been three years since Olympique Lyonnais acquired a majority stake in Seattle-based NWSL club Reign FC, forging an international sisterhood between women\u2019s clubs unlike any model in professional sports. The partnership has brought some of the world\u2019s best known players into the same organizational stable, including Lyon\u2019s Ada Hegerberg (who won the Ballon d\u2019Or in 2018) and OL Reign\u2019s Megan Rapinoe (who claimed the trophy in 2019). Ahead of their clubs\u2019 joint US tour, Rapinoe and Hegerberg sat down for an exclusive conversation with the Guardian to discuss their teams\u2019 unique sorority, their impressions of England\u2019s epochal Euro 2022 triumph and their hopes for next year\u2019s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. What were your thoughts on Euro 2022 and how it seemed to penetrate English culture, not unlike the 1999 World Cup in the United States? Rapinoe My overarching feeling was like, everyone\u2019s late to the party. This is not surprising to me at all. I feel like I\u2019ve known that the level of play was going to be that [high]. I knew that the European teams, especially in the last five years with the rise of the club game, have been sensational. Of course this was going to be how it was going to go. We literally grow gardens out of cement every single time. Tell me one women\u2019s tournament in the last 15 years that hasn\u2019t exceeded expectations. Part of it is like: \u201cWelcome, everybody, to the party. You\u2019re extremely fucking late, but fine.\u201d And I feel proud about that. Ada should feel the same and all the women\u2019s players should feel the same because we did this. We did this. We put this into motion through literally sheer will, while also being the best players in the world. The way that the English players held themselves in this tournament, they just embraced the moment fully and didn\u2019t fall into the narrative or didn\u2019t allow themselves to be stressed out about it. You could just tell they stepped into themselves. And it\u2019s yet another data point, justification, reason, a clear picture of why investing in women\u2019s football is good business, first and foremost. It\u2019s a proper money-making opportunity. So I feel so many different emotions. Just being as old as I am, it\u2019s hard not to be jaded by some of this stuff, but progress moves at the speed that it does and I think being able to build on this is huge. And I\u2019m just hoping that all of the main stakeholders can really take a look in the mirror and understand that it\u2019s been them that\u2019s been holding the game back, it\u2019s not been us. I feel incredibly proud. I think all of the supporters should feel incredibly proud. I think this is a total watershed moment, this whole year, going from Champions League to what Barcelona did [setting multiple world attendance records]. While the US women\u2019s national team routinely draws large crowds, the NWSL has failed to capture the same audience. What is the next step for growing the club game in the United States to what we\u2019ve been seeing lately in Europe? Rapinoe It has to come from a place of investment. It can\u2019t just be a charity thing. That\u2019s sort of willfully naive at this point. I think we\u2019ve proven time and time again \u2013 whether it\u2019s in the club game, in the international game, in friendlies and Euros and Champions League, whatever \u2013 it\u2019s good business to invest in women\u2019s football. And it\u2019s also the right thing to do, but I think before it\u2019s the right thing to do, it\u2019s good business. We shouldn\u2019t be trying to copy every single thing that men\u2019s sports has, and I think that\u2019s obviously a really easy trap to fall into. But I think when you actually invest in women\u2019s sports: the energy is there, the culture around it is there, the fandom is there, but if I can\u2019t figure out how to find the [video] stream \u2026 nobody is going to watch the game. So it\u2019s investing around the streaming services, investing around the front offices, investing around the facilities for the players, the stadiums for the players, ticketing, marketing, all of that. That\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s missing. The players and the product on the field have never been missing. It\u2019s just that we\u2019ve been neglected and under-financed and under-invested in forever. Lyon\u2019s a perfect example. Champions of Europe a million times, champions of France a million times. You have that success and now coupling that with maybe a sea change in the culture, especially after the World Cup in France, you\u2019re seeing obviously massive returns. The Euros were just sensational, Champions League this year was absolutely sensational and you\u2019re seeing bigger attendances around the world. There is this unmistakable sense of momentum coming out of the Euros straight into a World Cup year. Aside from lifting the trophy, what would you most like to see out of next year\u2019s tournament? Hegerberg I keep on scratching my head after every big tournament. You have the World Cup, you have the Euros and then we get back to club and then it\u2019s like the whole momentum just fades away. And I think that\u2019s a huge problem. Like I\u2019m a player in Europe, obviously, and I\u2019ve seen what\u2019s been happening here and \u2013 it\u2019s like Megan mentioned earlier \u2013 every tournament has been a success in terms of interest from your home country, on a world basis, the coverage. You have this insane momentum and then you have all these best players going back to their clubs and it\u2019s like you kind of lose this momentum. And I think it\u2019s a shame.  Dazn did an incredible job with the Champions League this year. You had some pretty powerful coverage. People actually got a good platform to see all of the best games. But the problem is our home leagues, basically. I feel like England, they\u2019re very good at selling their league. They\u2019re very good at marketing their league, but the other leagues, we\u2019ve got to step up. The federations are in control of these leagues and they have a huge job to do in order to lift the whole product, with the clubs obviously, and kind of shake it up a little bit and start selling the leagues, start selling good football matches where you actually have the best players playing every weekend. And that\u2019s the next step, especially in Europe. You have to get the momentum up the whole year round. Rapinoe The only thing I would say about the World Cup next year, I would love to see the ball not be dropped. It\u2019s absurd if it\u2019s dropped again. That\u2019s from the major stakeholders. That\u2019s Uefa, that\u2019s the federations, that\u2019s Fifa, that\u2019s Gianni [Infantino], specifically. It\u2019s the Australian federation, everything. We know now that if you invest in this World Cup, it\u2019s going to work. It\u2019s just not even a fucking question. I would love to see people stop saying: Wow, I think we have something here! This is insane if you don\u2019t invest in it. Whether that\u2019s people are producing content or streaming services or sponsors or whatever it is.  It\u2019s like a literal gold mine and I just don\u2019t understand. I mean, I do understand: it\u2019s sexism and patriarchy. The major stakeholders, most all of them are men and white men. Them being able to stand up and say: \u201cYou know what, like we got it wrong. We\u2019ve been getting it wrong. We\u2019ve been sexist.\u201d Because that\u2019s really what it is. We haven\u2019t invested despite all of the key metrics pointing that this would be an incredible [return on investment]. You need to invest in the infrastructure around women\u2019s sports, whether that\u2019s streaming, branding, marketing, journalism, all of the things that help prop it up. I mean the men\u2019s game, everybody talks about it all the time. I don\u2019t want to know as much about LeBron James as I do, but I can\u2019t not, because it\u2019s in my face all the time. I\u2019m sure in European football, with Canal+ and BBC Sport and all that, you probably don\u2019t want to know as much about Jack Grealish as you do, but you\u2019re going to anyway, because you can\u2019t get him out of your mind. Stuff like that is really important. Hegerberg This kind of coverage will help change the mentalities, will help raise a completely different generation into training different, training smarter, to put the same demands to six-year-old girls that you do with six-year-old boys, for example. I wish that we were taken as seriously as boys when we started playing. And I think that has a huge impact on the level and long term as well, because I think that the game only can get better. The way the girls read the game, technically, we\u2019ve seen that it\u2019s been a huge change in the tempo and physically. Changing mentalities with having better coverage and investment, it will also have a huge impact on the next generation and how they play in 15 years, and I think that\u2019s very important because we\u2019re here to also raise the level year in and year out. You mention the quality of European sides, Megan. How is the US women\u2019s system planning on keeping up with Europe when they\u2019re so clearly on America\u2019s heels? Rapinoe The game is growing exponentially every year. It\u2019s a huge challenge for us. I think the football being played at the Euros was the best football in the world that we\u2019ve seen ever. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s even a question. It\u2019s a huge challenge for us. We do know how to win. We do have a winning culture here. We know what we\u2019re up against. So I think, for me, honestly, it\u2019s exciting. It\u2019s exciting that so many teams are so much better. It\u2019s exciting that the level of competition is what it is. I think that brings out the best in everyone. But yeah, we\u2019ve got a tall order to keep not only obviously our No 1 standing but to keep ourselves world champions. I\u2019m excited for it. I think if you\u2019re not pushed and you\u2019re not challenged and you\u2019re not shitting yourself a little bit, like what\u2019s the point?

                    "body": "TO DOHA! When Russia played Saudi Arabia in the opening match of the last World Cup, Gianni Infantino wasn\u2019t the only dignitary in the crowd. As Russia opened the scoring, the cameras cut to the corporate seats, where the Fifa president could be seen sharing a funny joke with the matchday buddies sitting either side of him, Vladimir Putin and Sheikh Mohammed bin Salman. Of course, this was back in the days before the Saudi crown prince was discovered to have ordered his hit squad to play fast and loose with a bonesaw, or the Russian president had declared outright war on Ukraine. On that particular summer\u2019s evening in Moscow, they were just a pair of common-or-garden tyrants kicking back and enjoying the craic, brought together by their good pal Gianni. But despite subsequently accepting a medal of friendship from Putin, Infantino has now been forced to concede that, despite his high hopes, staging the World Cup in Russia had not invoked the warm fuzziness he\u2019d hoped in the Russian president. Speaking at the 72nd Fifa congress, staged in Qatar before Friday\u2019s Human Rights World Cup draw, Infantino insisted that while Russia 2018 had been \u201ca great success\u201d, sadly \u201cit did not solve the problems of the world\u201d. Not only that, \u201cit did not create a lasting peace\u201d, he parped. \u201cTherefore my plea, to all of those who have some power in this world, to all of those who are in important political positions in the world \u2013 please, please stop conflicts and wars. Please, for our children, for our future.\u201d But while football may have come up short when it came to stopping conflict, Infantino remains confident it can still play an important role. Asked about the legacy of Russia 2018, he sidestepped the question with a rambling answer that invoked the legacy of two fabled leaders. \u201cIf you look at the last century, who are the people who made the most impact?\u201d he enquired rhetorically. \u201cMandela and Gandhi. They had many reasons to be violent. They went another route. I think football can be like that \u2026 create understanding.\u201d This year, football will be attempting to create understanding in Qatar, where human rights abuses remain rife and more than 6,500 migrant workers are reported to have died since the country started whipping itself into shape for the big kickabout.  On that theme, Norwegian FA president Lise Klaveness delivered a stinging address. \u201cFootball can inspire dreams and break down barriers but as leaders we must do it right, to the highest standards,\u201d she said. \u201cIn 2010, World Cups were awarded by Fifa in unacceptable ways with unacceptable consequences. Human rights, equality, democracy: the core interests of football were not in the starting XI until many years later. Fifa has addressed these issues but there\u2019s still a long way to go. The migrant workers injured, the families of those that died in the buildup to the World Cup must be cared for.\u201d Having been more or less told to sit down and shut up by a more Fifa-approved Honduran delegate, Klaveness was later criticised by Hassan al-Thawadi, Qatar 2022 secretary general, who described her views as \u201coutdated\u201d. Again, that\u2019s the hosts, a country so modern that homosexuality is illegal and women remain obliged by law to obey their husbands. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE!

                    "body": "Connor Beasley is unlikely to end up with any Classics or Group One races on his CV but he earned at least a footnote in racing\u2019s history books on Saturday as he steered Commanche Falls, a 25-1 chance, to a second successive victory in the Stewards\u2019 Cup.\nCommanche Falls was a much-fancied 10-1 chance for this ultra-competitive sprint handicap last season and was just 2lb higher in the weights for this year\u2019s renewal. The punters, though, preferred to look elsewhere, with some of them perhaps deterred by the fact that no horse had won back-to-back runnings of the Stewards\u2019 Cup since Sky Diver 54 years ago.\n\nInver Park, in particular, attracted sustained support to set off as the 9-2 favourite but the closing stages were a near-facsimile of last year\u2019s race as Beasley brought Commanche Falls through to lead well inside the final furlong and edge out Tabdeed, a 12-1 shot, by a short-head.\nMichael Dods, who trains Commanche Falls in County Durham, has a masterful touch with sprint handicappers and Tinto (33-1), his other runner, finished close up in fifth. For the second year running, though, he was not at Goodwood to enjoy his success, preferring to stay closer to home at Thirsk.\n\u201cI was watching thinking Tinto was travelling nicely just to the right of him,\u201d Dods told Racing TV at the Yorkshire track. \u201cThen I saw Connor pushing him and coming through and I thought, \u2018he has a good chance here\u2019. I think the other one came and headed him and he fought back on the line.\n\u201cI\u2019m delighted for everybody involved, especially Connor. To go down there, probably with only one ride today, he has shown how good a jockey he is again.\u201d\nCommanche Falls is the sixth horse to win a second Stewards\u2019 Cup since the race was first staged in 1840, and while no horse has won the race three times, his affection for this sharp six-furlongs will mean he has plenty of supporters if he returns next year.\n\n\u201cHe seems to come alight when he comes down here,\u201d Beasley said. \u201cIt\u2019s a long way from home but he seems to like the stable yard and the track.\u201d\nEarlier on the card, Sea La Rosa edged home in a close finish to the Group Two Lillie Langtry Stakes under a finely judged ride by Tom Marquand, after Jason Hart briefly appeared to have stolen the spoils with an enterprising ride on Urban Artist, the 18-1 outsider of the field.\nGoodwood\u2019s long downhill run from the home turn means it is tailor-made for front-running tactics, and Hart kicked Hughie Morrison\u2019s mare into a clear lead from the start. She was still around 15 lengths clear turning in and her rider was able to ease down a notch to prepare her for the drive for the line.\nSea La Rosa\u2019s more nervous backers may have been feeling slightly queasy at this stage, but Marquand, who was sitting in third, was clearly confident that he would bridge the gap. William Haggas\u2019s filly quickened well when asked and got to Urban Artist with a few strides to spare, but the outsider deservedly finished a length away in second with Emily Dickinson, the 13-8 favourite, only third.\n\n\u201cIt was always a case of trying to run down the leader at the right time,\u201d Marquand said, \u201cand not giving the second wave a chance to come and get us.\nSome horses give you more confidence than others going around and she\u2019s a filly that you can almost feel her gritting her teeth, to try and go and run one down.\u201d"

                    "body": "Jim Smith, salsa music and a very bad night\u2019s sleep formed the backdrop to the day that would change Paulo Wanchope\u2019s life. Signed by Derby, the unknown Costa Rican was on his way to Old Trafford in April 1997 to make his Premier League debut against Manchester United. The striker, not long out of his teens, was nervous. \u201cI was very anxious before the game,\u201d says the 45-year-old. \u201cThe previous night I woke up every hour and a half. I didn\u2019t sleep well. [Smith] understood that I wanted to be relaxed at that time. He understood that music might help me. He asked me on the team bus what sort of music I liked. So I put on some salsa.\u201d It certainly settled the nerves. Wanchope\u2019s brilliant goal helped Derby to a famous 3-2 victory and was later voted the best goal in the club\u2019s history. Along with the volleys of Mario Stanic and Danny Rose, it is one of the great Premier League debut strikes. As well as embarrassing Phil Neville, Gary Neville, Gary Pallister and Peter Schmeichel that day 25 years ago, it made a mockery of Wanchope\u2019s lack of sleep and confidence. The goal would typify Wanchope\u2019s style throughout his career \u2013 a mesmeric blend of limbs, simultaneously graceful and chaotic; choreographed elbows and knees that danced and flailed their way towards goal.  Talking to Wanchope on Zoom from his home in Costa Rica, with his easy demeanor and still-youthful face that has a smattering of grey hairs, it is odd to think Wanchope has ever been anxious. But life was full of uncertainty before his \u00a3600,000 move to Derby from Herediano. In fact, Wanchope very nearly didn\u2019t play football. \u201cI used to play many sports in the street,\u201d he says. \u201cMy mum used to be an athlete. My uncle played baseball. I had the chance to play basketball and played on a high-school scholarship in the US. I had a chance to play in college but decided to come back to Costa Rica and start my studies here instead. \u201cI had to choose between football and basketball but my passion was always football. I got called up for the 1995 Under-20 World Cup in Qatar and that helped me make my decision. Almost every night we would chat with the Spanish players and I managed to get a shin pad from Ra\u00fal. We knew he was going to be amazing, as he had already made his debut for Real Madrid at 17 years old. I still have the shin pad somewhere.\u201d  A trial with QPR was arranged. \u201cI played three games and scored six goals, but nothing happened. Then I came back to Costa Rica but went back one month later to Derby. People were saying to me: \u2018Why are you going back? If you didn\u2019t manage to get into a second-tier club [QPR], why do you think you are going to make it in the Premier League?\u2019 But I told them: \u2018I want this.\u2019\u201d Wanchope played two games on trial at Derby and didn\u2019t score, with Smith noting in his autobiography that Wanchope \u201cmissed a couple of open goals but we thought he was worth a chance\u201d. \u201cI was a bit worried but they made the decision to sign me,\u201d says Wanchope. \u201cDerby was a great way to start my career in England. Smith was a very strong character and his assistant, Steve McClaren, was more quiet and helped me not just in football but all round in my life. It was a great combination. The food, the rain and cold was very different but that was my dream. To play abroad, with and against the best.\u201d Wanchope would spend two years at Derby, scoring 23 league goals, before joining West Ham in 1999 for \u00a33.5m and moved to Manchester City for a similar fee a year later. \u201cWest Ham had a lot of good young players, like Rio Ferdinand, Frank Lampard, Joe Cole, Michael Carrick. As a striker, it was easy to play with Paolo Di Canio, Trevor Sinclair. I cannot say the things that I saw with John Moncur.  \u201cAt Manchester City I had the experience at Maine Road and the new stadium. Maine Road was a great atmosphere, the pitch was very close to the stands. But it was the fans that made the experience special. We had some doubts when we moved to [the Etihad]. But the support there was something I had never experienced before.\u201d Wanchope would leave England in 2004 and have successful spells in Spain, Qatar, Argentina, MLS, Japan and back home in Costa Rica, and his exploits for the national team earned them a place at the 2002 and 2006 World Cups. Wanchope finished as his country\u2019s second-highest scorer before joining Jorge Luis Pinto\u2019s coaching staff at the 2014 World Cup, where Costa Rica reached the quarter-finals for the first time, losing to the Netherlands on penalties.  \u201cIt was a great experience: being in the Group of Death and being able to survive, with England, Italy and Uruguay,\u201d says a smiling Wanchope. \u201cWe did a great job over there, but had talented players: Keylor Navas, Bryan Ruiz, Joel Campbell.\u201d The road after that tournament was a little more bumpy. Pinto resigned, citing \u201cdifferences with the staff\u201d and explained how he had been \u201csleeping with the enemy for one and a half years\u201d. Wanchope was later promoted to head coach but resigned in 2015 after his involvement in a fight while watching an Under-23 match. \u201cThere was an incident,\u201d says Wanchope of Pinto\u2019s resignation. \u201cHe made a declaration that I was a problem and the federation didn\u2019t want him to keep going with the job. He went crazy. I don\u2019t have an explanation. I never talked to him about that.\u201d This month, with the Women\u2019s Under-20 World Cup due to take place in Costa Rica in August, Wanchope was enlisted by Fifa to do the draw, with the hosts facing Australia, Spain and Brazil in a tricky Group A. \u201cThe last 15-20 years there has been a big improvement in women\u2019s football over here. To have the privilege of having the World Cup, it will be a great platform for our youngsters, for our girls.\u201d Wanchope is balancing ambassadorial duties with coaching ambitions, and a move back to England remains very much a possibility. \u201cI have dual citizenship and as a family we are discussing moving back \u2013 my daughter is studying there, so we are thinking about joining her. Football-wise, the place to be is in England.\u201d"

                    "body": "Danny Care believes England can use their current turmoil to their advantage and spring a surprise at next year\u2019s World Cup, insisting that Steve Borthwick would be \u201cvery successful\u201d as Eddie Jones\u2019s replacement. With just five competitive matches before England begin their World Cup campaign, Borthwick would be up against it to turn a side who won five of their 12 matches in 2022 into contenders. Care, who was left out by Jones this autumn after earning a recall over the summer, said Ireland and France are among the nations out in front.  Care, however, has cited the example of Harlequins, who dispensed with Paul Gustard\u2019s services in January 2021 and went on to clinch the Premiership title five months later, as proof that there is enough time to bring about a change of fortunes. The Rugby Football Union has targeted Borthwick as Jones\u2019s successor and remains in talks with Leicester over a compensation package for the 43-year-old. No official unveiling is expected before next week. \u201cOn a much smaller scale we showed in a change of coach at the club, when you give us five, six months, and we lifted the trophy when no one thought we could do it,\u201d said Care. \u201cI\u2019d say England\u2019s a similar thing at the moment, no one would think that England would be stood there with the World Cup trophy in October. \u201cSo as an Englishman, you go \u2018why not?\u2019. No one thinks we can do it so you can use that as an extra little bit of motivation. But I truly believe in that squad, I do think there\u2019s some brilliant players. If they can be unlocked and unleashed in the right way, and have the right guys leading it, then why not. \u201cI think if you look at where Leicester were when Steve took over, to where they are now, obviously lifting the [Premiership] trophy last season, he knows how to turn a team around quickly, how to get a team in shape. So if it is to be Steve, I have no doubts that he would be very, very successful.\u201d Care also urged the new management team to press the reset button when it comes to selection, having been ignored by Jones for nearly four years before his summer recall. \u201cThere are a lot of talented players who haven\u2019t had many opportunities over the last few years who are going \u2018Ok, this is my shot now\u2019,\u201d he added. \u201cHopefully it\u2019s a completely fresh piece of paper for the coaches to have a look at everyone \u2013 old and young \u2013 and see if they can help out this England side.\u201d Meanwhile, Courtney Lawes is set for a return for Northampton after 11 weeks on the sidelines with a head injury. The 33-year-old, who captained England to the summer series win over Australia, was sorely missed by the national team this autumn. Jones said at the time that he was worried about Lawes\u2019s health after he was also sidelined for six weeks earlier this year due to a problem with his vestibular system. Lawes, however, is expected to take his place on the Northampton bench against La Rochelle on Saturday."

                    "body": "Most people who look at Match of the Day host Gary Lineker would have no difficulty recognising that the man is white \u2013 and so it\u2019s little surprise that he was mocked after revealing in a podcast interview that he suffered \u201cracist abuse\u201d due to his \u201cdarkish skin\u201d throughout childhood and at moments in his professional footballing career. While he immediately qualified his comments with the assertion that he was \u201cas English as they come\u201d (by which he presumably meant white), many social media users, and some pundits, ridiculed him for supposedly \u201cidentifying as black\u201d. But the mockery is misguided. Lineker\u2019s comments were important and insightful \u2013 giving us a glimpse of how race and racism can work.  At play in the backlash is a fundamental misunderstanding about how racialisation \u2013 the social process by which people are organised into different categories, based on real or imagined bodily and cultural characteristics \u2013 operates. And it\u2019s a confusion that seems to be shared by rightwing baiters and, disappointingly, some socially conscious supporters of racial justice. They hold on to a view of \u201crace\u201d as static and constant throughout time and place, despite the fact that we know racial categories are constantly invented and reinvented: think of, say, the codification of \u201ccoloured\u201d as an identity in apartheid South Africa.  First, it\u2019s worth saying that if you look at photographs of Lineker as a young football player, with his dark hair, olive skin, and a wide nose, you can see why he may have been read as something other than \u201cwhite\u201d and received racial abuse as such, especially as a footballer in the 1980s. For whiteness to survive, its boundaries must constantly be policed. In other words, many white people will have the experience of being scrutinised for \u201clooking a bit ethnic\u201d, whether that\u2019s because of curly hair, darker skin or prominent features. Even a holiday tan can throw a white person\u2019s race into question, so fragile are its borders. It has also been strange to see people from all corners immediately rushing to declare that Lineker must see himself as black \u2013 which is not a term that he used when talking about this \u2013 as if racial discrimination in England is only experienced by those with the darkest skin. Many groups have been let in and out of the club of whiteness: southern Europeans, eastern Europeans, Traveller groups, Irish people.  What\u2019s obscured by the mockery of Lineker\u2019s comments is that discrimination does not need to hit its intended target to function. Straight men have reported aggressive homophobic abuse due to perceived feminine interests or behaviour. Gender policing of womanhood from transmisogynists has had a ripple effect for cisgender women, especially butch lesbian women, who have found themselves challenged in public toilets. Whether or not you actually belong to the identity group you are being perceived to belong to is irrelevant: racists don\u2019t ask for ancestry tests results before determining whether you should taste the ground or not. Observing that there is collateral damage in racism, homophobia and transmisogyny does not take away or distract from the reality of this discrimination that reaches the \u201ccorrect\u201d target. Ultimately, Lineker\u2019s experience reveals how racism is based on a lie \u2013 despite the best efforts of white supremacists, it remains stubbornly true that identity is a porous, socially determined thing. Ghoulish rightwingers rushing to dismiss his words and tweet, \u201cBlack Linekers Matter\u201d are unremarkable and expected, but it\u2019s worth being graceful to the more sensitive reaction from racial minorities who feel insulted or patronised by this story. Certainly the case of Rachel Dolezal appropriating black identity and claiming to be \u201ctransracial\u201d, or the allegations of blackfishing against Jesy Nelson, provide evidence of why many have simply had enough of what can seem to be an epidemic of white people appropriating racial struggle. But sometimes not all is black and white. In the case of, for instance, theatre director Anthony Ekundayo Lennon, who has a complex personal story of racial abuse and confusion over his heritage, due to obvious \u201cnon-white\u201d features presenting since infanthood, the misrepresentation of his story and false equivalence made to Dolezal felt like a missed opportunity for a deeper discussion about race in Britain. But in the arena of social media reaction and reduction, we keep missing these opportunities again and again.  Jason Okundaye is a London-based writer and researcher "

                    "body": "The crowd went crazy, a yelling, jumping, flag-waving, fist-pumping swirl of red-white-and-blue delight. And why not? Kansas City had just won the 2026 World Cup. The host city selection process for the tournament in the US, Mexico and Canada unfurled much like a World Cup itself: a few no-hopers, some underdogs who went deeper than expected, a couple of surprising flops and predictable triumphs for the favorites.  Fans at the KC Live! watch party for Thursday\u2019s announcement of the winners celebrated what had until recently seemed an improbable victory. When Fifa evaluated the Kansas City bid in 2018 it scored some of the lowest marks for accommodation and transport among the contenders. But the airport\u2019s being rebuilt, there\u2019s a vibrant soccer culture, the Hunt family is among the most influential dynasties in US sports, and Missouri passed a bill exempting World Cup tickets from sales taxes - unlike Colorado. In any case, it would have been remiss not to pick any midwestern cities, though the venue map still looks strange. There was a glaring omission even before the united North American bid defeated Morocco in 2018, since the then-mayor of Chicago \u2013 the sports-crazed third-largest city in the US and the base of the US Soccer Federation \u2013 took a peek at the potential financial liabilities and balked. As did Montreal, which quit the race last summer when the Quebec government declined to contribute a reported $75m. Edmonton was spurned by Fifa, meaning that Canada only has two cities to Mexico\u2019s three and the US\u2019s 11. And KC beat DC. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine a World Cup coming to the US and the capital city not taking a major role as well,\u201d Colin Smith, Fifa\u2019s chief tournaments and events officer, told reporters on Thursday. But that is what\u2019s happening. Even joining forces with nearby Baltimore and its solid downtown stadium after Fifa inspectors panned dreary and distant FedEx Field could not sway the governing body, which preferred Boston - another place with a problematic venue, but an influential backer in the billionaire team owner Robert Kraft. A US senator did describe Fifa as a \u201cmafia-style crime syndicate\u201d in a 2015 congressional hearing in Washington, so perhaps world soccer\u2019s power brokers won\u2019t be overly distraught to skip the city. This World Cup will bear scant resemblance to USA \u201994, even if Diana Ross makes another appearance at the opening ceremony. (Don\u2019t bet against it.) As that 24-team tournament dawned the USMNT had only featured in one World Cup since 1950 and MLS was unborn.  It\u2019ll also be vastly different from Qatar 2022, as the World Cup skids from a compressed 32-team, 64-match winter contest in a country smaller than Connecticut to a bloated transcontinental 48-nation, 80-fixture summer extravaganza. At USA \u201994 there were nine host cities. The Boston, Bay Area, Los Angeles, New York and Dallas regions will repeat but none of the 1994 stadiums will be used in 2026. The antique Rose Bowl, where Brazil won their fourth title, was passed over in favor of plush new SoFi Stadium. Fifa didn\u2019t reveal where the showpiece matches will take place. New York is the front-runner for the final, but how much does it matter? Homogenisation is a goal of any efficient major international business, whether you\u2019re Starbucks or a Swiss not-for profit organization that runs global football. \u201cThe exoticism is diluted now. People talk about hosting the World Cup,\u201d the journalist and author Jonathan Wilson wrote in 2014, \u201cbut really every World Cup now is held in Fifaland, a tax-free generic bubble in which the name of the venue is written on an advertising hoarding by the halfway line because otherwise there\u2019s no way you\u2019d be able to work out where you were.\u201d Fifa president Gianni Infantino was on hand in Manhattan for the live reveal, though given the tournament\u2019s economic elitism perhaps Davos would have been a more suitable location. The income growth is staggering. Fifa said that it made a near-$100m surplus at the 1994 tournament from revenue of $235m. When it pitched for 2026 the North American bid projected $14bn in revenue and a $11bn surplus for Fifa. The governing body is literally a law unto itself, insisting that governments agree to provide \u201cexemptions from labour law and other legislation\u201d, streamlined border and work permit processes and tax exemptions. They sound like a set of outrageous impositions, an assertion of Fifa\u2019s sovereignty over democratic governments. Then again: local and state authorities lavishing public funds and tax breaks on professional sports and citing pie-in-the-sky economic benefits. Multibillion-dollar businesses paying a lower tax rate than the average individual. What could be more American? NFL stadiums with problematic fields such as the venues in LA and Dallas will need to be modified, and grass laid over artificial turf, but one clear advantage over recent World Cups that will make 2026 more profitable and less wasteful is that no stadiums need to be constructed or significantly rebuilt for the tournament, avoiding legacy scandals such as the $550m stadium in Brazil that became a bus parking lot. And not everything about the planet\u2019s greatest sporting event can be quantified and monetized. \u201cThis part of the world doesn\u2019t realize what will happen here in 2026. These three countries will be upside-down and then flipped again,\u201d Infantino told reporters. \u201cThe world will be invading Canada, Mexico and the United States. And they will be invaded by a big wave of joy and of happiness.\u201d The party started Thursday, in Kansas City, Vancouver, Atlanta, Monterrey, and a dozen more cities across the continent."

                    "body": "The US Women\u2019s National Team is now halfway through a revitalisation project begun in the embers of disappointment in Japan. The US performance at the Tokyo Olympics was seen as woefully lacklustre, though they did grasp bronze medals. The veteran-heavy roster did not perform to expectation, and the manager, Vlatko Andonovski, has overseen an ambitious transition scheme in the year since. With less than a year to the World Cup we take a look at where he and the team have got to.  Integrating new talent Following a drawn-out \u201cvictory tour\u201d featuring the emotional retirement of Carli Lloyd, Andonovski\u2019s roster revolution began in earnest last November (in the precise location where its final iteration will be ultimately tested: Australia). Announcing the new roster, Andonovski told media: \u201cWe\u2019ve turned a page toward World Cup qualifying\u201d. He made clear the aims of the programme in Sydney, in Newcastle and in the months cascading from those friendlies would be integrating new talent and testing them. Of the 22 players invited to the Australia camp only 10 had been in Tokyo and only six were present for the World Cup victory in France 2019. All over the field, Andonovski introduced (or reintroduced) names whose consistent club performances had earned them a look. So began the mantra of the Andonovski era: if you\u2019re killing it with consistency in NWSL, you\u2019ll get a look. Veterans and stars will need to perform there too. The forward line saw the greatest shift of any, as veteran stars Megan Rapinoe, Alex Morgan, Tobin Heath and Christen Press were all left out. Players with only a handful of caps were brought in. The pattern continued in the next two camps, as Andonovski called in fresh rotations of players balanced by a few veterans. Asked where all the big names had gone, he told media that \u201cwe\u2019re not calling Mia Hamm or Julie Foudy into camp\u201d either. NWSL was the level playing field where players made their case for a tryout. And their tryouts were USWNT camps from last summer until this June. As Rose Lavelle told me over the phone in February, discussing competition for spots: \u201cNational team training is as intense as any game.\u201d Eventually, as the US prepared for World Cup and Olympic qualifying in Mexico, Andonovski phased a few veterans back in. Rapinoe was reintroduced in the role of player-coach. And Morgan \u2013 who responded to her seven-month absence from the national team by having the season of her life, sitting atop the pack in the race for golden boot \u2013 made her return. Having won the Concacaf Women\u2019s Championship in Mexico, the US have qualified for the 2023 World Cup and 2024 Olympics. They took care of business, and Andondovski has shaped a new core to this team along the way.  Moving on to the next phase Eleven months is plenty of time before the World Cup. Fringe players can still (and perhaps should) make their way towards the squad. Notably, there\u2019s a stockpile of injured players and new mothers whose re-emergence could change the team\u2019s shape. But, after a successful summer and long year in transition, Andonovski has etched the outline of the team he will take to the World Cup. There\u2019s a lot of talent in the team, but it\u2019s imperfect. A few positions need more depth. Inconsistency plagues certain areas of the pitch. Andonovski and the veteran captain, Becky Sauerbrunn, were sober in their estimation: this is not a team currently ready to win a World Cup. Emphasis on yet, because they could be in a year. And what they plan to do is get more experience together as a team, experiment and refine. Nine days ago US Soccer announced its 23-player roster for two September friendlies against Nigeria. Presumably, this is the current core to the squad, and the one they\u2019ll take to Wembley to face England on 7 October. Below, I break down the state of that squad position by position, with notes on their present state and players on the horizon who may break in. Goalkeepers The US has a lot of depth in this position. Alyssa Naeher is the No 1 but Andonovski has made an effort to get competitive matches to some exciting understudies. I expect that to continue, and hope to see some alternates get minutes this month. In the squad Naeher, Casey Murphy and Aubrey Kingsbury. Potential call-ups Phallon Tullis-Joyce. We\u2019ll likely see OL Reign\u2019s 25-year-old keeper on a USWNT roster at some point. Andonovski indicated he was also monitoring Adrianna Franch, Bella Bixby, and Katie Lund.  *** Defenders Sauerbrunn directs the backline when fit. Her centre-back pairing is an interesting debate, though, and Andonovski has done a fair amount of experimenting. Abby Dahlkemper and Tierna Davidson are injured, and Alana Cook and Naomi Girma have knocked them down the pecking order in the meantime. Cook has played her way into the top choice but I am excited to see more of Girma this September. Centre-backs in the squad Sauerbrunn, Cook, Girma. Potential centre-back call-ups Davidson and Dahlkemper. Crystal Dunn gave birth in May, and announced last week she would return to train with the team this September. That should bolster the hopes of USWNT fans and dismay opponents. While Dunn has been utilised as a full-back since the era of Jill Ellis, she\u2019s a natural midfielder. If Andonovski is willing to reconsider his formation and get creative, I\u2019d love to see what Dunn can do further up the pitch. Full-backs in the squad Emily Fox, Sofia Huerta and Hailie Mace Potential full-back call-ups Kelley O\u2019Hara (injured), Emily Sonnett (injured), Carson Pickett and Dunn.  *** Midfielders There is exciting, creative talent coming through but their recent form has been inconsistent as a unit. The talent and creativity are not yet manifesting on the pitch. I\u2019d love to see Andonovski experiment with players and formation, giving more time to players such as Ashley Sanchez. In the squad Andi Sullivan, Rose Lavelle, Lindsey Horan, Kristie Mewis, Sanchez, Sam Coffey, Taylor Kornieck and Savannah DeMelo. Potential call-ups Jaelin Howell, Sam Mewis (injured), Julie Ertz (pregnant).  *** Forwards The US has a lot of depth here. Andonovski\u2019s preferred wingers are Mallory Pugh and Sophia Smith, and both have been outstanding. I\u2019m excited to see more of Trinity Rodman but she dropped out of this camp because of a family commitment. Morgan has been the starting striker but Cat Macario will test her for that role once fit. Rapinoe remains available on the wing \u2013 and is still capable of her former magic. In the squad Pugh, Smith, Rapinoe, Morgan, Midge Purce, Ashley Hatch. Potential call-ups Macario (a certain selection once fit) and Rodman  Talking points Spain\u2019s bright future Spain\u2019s Under-20s defeated Japan 3-1 in Costa Rica on Sunday, clinching the 2022 Under-20 Women\u2019s World Cup title. The future stays bright for a nation whose development of the women\u2019s game has skyrocketed over the past decade. Putellas recognised Staying with Spain, Barcelona\u2019s captain, Alexia Putellas, was named Uefa Women\u2019s Player of the Year for the second year running. England back together England\u2019s Lionesses are back in training for the first time since claiming the European Championship trophy. They aim to secure World Cup qualification against Austria on Saturday or Luxembourg on Tuesday. The group stage of World Cup qualification wraps up on Tuesday, with first-placed teams securing their ticket and second-placed teams heading to the playoffs. Quote of the week \u201cKris Ward has been relieved of his duties as head coach.\u201d The Washington Spirit Twitter account ended with striking lack of explanation and hilarious informality the reign of Ward, who took over from Richie Burke mid-season last year and guided the team to a championship. The details surrounding the situation remain unclear but it follows a seriously lacklustre season for the Spirit. Recommended viewing Rapinoe is in incredible form with OL Reign. Building on a string of goals, she scored this stoppage-time winner against Orlando Pride last Friday night (and then got a yellow card for ripping off her shirt).  \u2022 This is an extract from our free weekly women\u2019s football newsletter, Moving The Goalposts.

                    "body": "Welcome to The Spin, the Guardian\u2019s weekly (and free) cricket newsletter. Here\u2019s an extract from this week\u2019s edition. To receive the full version every Wednesday, just pop your email in below:\n\nEoin Morgan is a unique figure in cricket history, an Irish revolutionary who became one of England\u2019s all-time greats. That status was sealed when he lifted the World Cup in 2019. It was a thrilling achievement but it did only happen by the barest of margins \u2013 or, as he called it, \u201cthe rub of the green\u201d. There is a better reason to put Morgan in the pantheon. He was simply the best of England\u2019s one-day captains, the Brearley of the blitzkrieg.\nThere was nothing rum about captain Morgan. He was a man with a plan. If this sounds basic, it was beyond some of his predecessors \u2013 including even Mike Brearley, who blew a World Cup final by batting too slowly. Morgan\u2019s plan was dead simple: to score faster than the opposition. The batters were there to hand out batterings, the bowlers to take wickets.\nIn the seven and a half years of his regime, England became the most successful ODI team in the world, winning 82 matches and losing 37 (including those he was absent for). In the previous seven and a half years, they had been eighth in the world (among nations playing regularly) with 79 wins and 78 losses. So Morgan made them twice as good. In T20 his impact was less dramatic, but England still went from seventh among the big fish to third behind India and Pakistan. And they only missed out on a World Cup because of some almighty hitting from Carlos Brathwaite.\n\nA man with a plan has to hold his nerve. Morgan\u2019s was tested in 2015, his first home summer as captain, against New Zealand at Southampton just after breaking the 400 barrier. Bowled out for 302 from 45.2 of their 50 overs, they lost, even though NZ proceeded more sedately. The received wisdom said it was a crime not to use your quota; Morgan begged to differ. \u201cI\u2019m proud of the way the guys played with a positive mindset,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did a lot of things right with the bat today.\u201d He stuck to his guns, and the guns kept on blazing. England lifted the world record to 444 in 2016, 481 in 2018 (against Australia) and 498 the other day. Under the previous captain, Alastair Cook, they never passed 325.\nMorgan ended up as an unofficial player-manager. On his watch, it hardly mattered who was the England coach. When the cagey Chris Silverwood succeeded the easygoing Trevor Bayliss in autumn 2019, Joe Root\u2019s Test team went into their shell while Morgan\u2019s blasters just carried on shelling their opponents.\nHe wasn\u2019t totally gung-ho: he relied heavily on Root\u2019s classicism, deploying him as the designated driver. In the field he was capable of defending, sometimes posting three slips, more often none. His attack was varied: swing from Chris Woakes, wheels from Mark Wood and Jofra Archer, googlies from Adil Rashid, off-breaks from Moeen Ali. Latterly Morgan fell in love with left-arm seamers, taking five of them to the Netherlands. The good old right-arm seamer, an England staple since time immemorial, became almost obsolete. Stuart Broad played only 13 ODIs under Morgan, averaging 59 with the ball rather than his usual 28.\n\nFaced with issues that bedevilled the Test squad, Morgan dispatched them like a bad ball. Broad and Jimmy Anderson were put out to pasture years ago (which also enhanced the Test team). Root automatically batted at No 3. Jonny Bairstow was licensed to thrill 10 years before a Test captain had the same idea. Jos Buttler, a keeper in every sense of the word, grew into a superstar. Rashid was a mainstay, so the team was always multicultural. Amid the World Cup euphoria, Morgan stayed cool enough to say, cannily, \u201cwe had Allah with us\u201d.\nGood captains bring faith, hope and clarity. So far, Ben Stokes has been big on all three. Morgan majored on the faith \u2013 staying loyal to his stars, especially the hot-and-cold Jason Roy \u2013 and the clarity. His imprint shone out even when he wasn\u2019t there. A year ago, before an ODI series against Pakistan, he and his whole squad were ruled out by Covid protocols. Stokes grabbed the reins and got a cast of understudies to mimic the men they replaced. They won 3-0, foreshadowing this month\u2019s Test whitewash of New Zealand. Morgan had done so well that he had made himself redundant.\nWe cricket writers go on about the need for consistency while seldom applying it to captains. It\u2019s a big ask for a batter (just look at Morgan, more susceptible than most to a bad patch), but a bare minimum from a boss in any walk of life. Rule by whim is just waving your ego around. Ruling by consistency, giving a reason for your answer, means everyone knows what they\u2019re doing.\nThere are still some cricket lovers, unbelievably, who dismiss the one-day game as hit-and-giggle. Morgan was certainly a hitter \u2013 his 202 sixes in ODIs are a runaway England record, more than Stokes (88) and Andrew Flintoff (92) put together \u2013 but far from a giggler. When the camera zoomed in he was usually poker faced, sometimes stern, always in control. He could be hard on his men: Liam Plunkett was pensioned off the minute his bang-it-in bowling had helped to win the World Cup, Alex Hales was ostracised for being an idiot and ignored for three years (so far). He might have got less from a stuffy Lord\u2019s tribunal.\nBut any blots on the copybook are faint ones. Morgan didn\u2019t just captain a team, or two: he created a culture. The squad he inherited from Cook was boring and bad, whereas the one he hands on is entertaining and excellent. We could not have asked for more."

                    "body": "The $850bn (\u00a3720bn) global advertising market is facing the prospect of a \u201ccar crash\u201d next year as the cost of living crisis forcing households to drastically cut back on spending triggers companies to consider slashing their marketing budgets. The advertising industry remains bullish about its prospects \u2013 the football World Cup is forecast to keep growth at a gloom-defying 8.4% this year, while 6.4% remains pencilled in for 2023 \u2013 despite mounting concerns that the economy it feeds off is heading for recession. \u201cConventional wisdom would suggest that next year will be a car crash,\u201d said one senior media industry executive. \u201cConsumers are being squeezed harder than at any time since the 1970s. Many things will become secondary to essential spending, all of which creates a nasty cocktail for the ad industry.\u201d During the last advertising recession in 2009 the industry doyen Sir Martin Sorrell encouraged brands to maintain marketing spend, citing evidence that those that did would come out the other side trumping rivals for market share. In practice, advertising budgets make for a quick cost-cutting strategy to boost, or at least salvage, a company\u2019s balance sheet as demand dries up.  \u201cWith recession looming the \u2018R-word\u2019 makes marketers look at whether they should be cutting spend,\u201d says Richard Broughton, director at Ampere Analysis. \u201cMarketing is an easy cost to cut and it tends to have an instant and immediate impact.\u201d Earlier this month, WPP, the company Sorrell built into the world\u2019s largest marketing service empire before an acrimonious departure four years ago, saw \u00a3700m wiped off its market value as investors reacted to concerns over client ad spending next year as the global economy weakens. \u201cWe are, like everyone else, aware of the economic environment,\u201d says Mark Read, chief executive of WPP. \u201cThere is scepticism over the outlook for the sector. But we are not yet seeing signs of clients cutting back spend while consumer demand remains strong across the world.\u201d While some analysts saw the investor response as an overreaction \u2013 WPP and its big publicly-listed French and US rivals continue to report strong financial results albeit with slowing outlooks \u2013 there are signs of trouble ahead. Last month, ITV reported that advertising growth of 12% in the first quarter, compared with the same period in pre-pandemic 2019, slumped to just 2% in the second quarter. And earlier this month, the online delivery service Deliveroo hit its downgraded targets in part by cutting its marketing budget through a more \u201ccareful targeting of spend given the more challenging environment for consumers\u201d \u2013 an inauspicious augury of a shift in the ad market. \u201cThe mood music has changed within the industry recently,\u201d says James McDonald, director of data, intelligence and forecasting at the industry research body Warc. \u201cForecasts are not looking as positive as they were. I\u2019m not saying an advertising recession is imminent but the likelihood has increased.\u201d TV has been a pandemic winner \u2013 last year marked ITV\u2019s best ad haul in its 67-year history \u2013 with ad-cost inflation, the advertising gold of the football World Cup and a rise in post-Covid spending keeping the market buoyant. However, globally the cost of buying TV ads has soared by almost a third since before the pandemic, the steepest rise in more than two decades, according to Warc. With increased scrutiny of how marketing budgets are spent TV is looking expensive, an issue ITV has attempted to address by offering a fifth off prices for ad slots during what it has dubbed the Christmas World Cup later this year.  \u201cA slowdown is already happening,\u201d says Sarah Simon, an analyst at Berenberg. \u201c[And] brand advertising seems an obvious cost category where temporary cuts can be made.\u201d Pressure on TV budgets in particular is will mount further with the launch of new ad-supported packages from Netflix and Disney+, as well as the rise of Amazon, Apple and TikTok in the battle for ad budgets. \u201cTV does still deliver,\u201d says McDonald. \u201cIt is not just a case for brands of questioning whether it is getting too expensive, but can they afford to live without the considerable [audience] reach it gives us for our budget? However, right now any advertiser \u2013 all advertisers \u2013 are going to be reconsidering their budgets.\u201d Even spend on digital media \u2013 which has for years hoovered marketing budgets away from traditional outlets such as TV, newspapers, magazines and radio \u2013 is not immune to a shift in ad spend priorities. The once unstoppable $115bn advertising behemoth that is Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, stunned markets by reporting its first ever drop in revenue, and forecast another decline for the third quarter. \u201cPrice pressure is also being felt across the online media landscape,\u201d says McDonald. \u201cFacebook\u2019s first loss, Twitter and Snap underperforming, it could be the canary in the coalmine for a shift of budgets away from branding ads towards performance marketing. Contrast that with Google\u2019s search arm making $41bn in the last quarter, its second highest quarter in record, and Amazon\u2019s ad business continuing to grow rapidly.\u201d Some markets \u2013 notably the US, the world\u2019s biggest ad market by some distance \u2013 are showing fewer economic warning signs. \u201cKeep in mind the global economy is unlikely to go into a recession, even if some individual markets will,\u201d says Brian Wieser, global president, business intelligence at WPP\u2019s Group M, the world\u2019s largest buyer of ad space for clients. But in the UK, with the cost of living crisis showing no sign of ameliorating \u2013 energy bills continue to soar and inflation is forecast to hit 13% \u2013 the view on the prospects for the ad market is becoming increasingly bearish. \u201cAdvertising has historically been strongly correlated to consumer confidence and spending,\u201d says Berenberg\u2019s Simon. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that the outlook for the consumer is set to deteriorate further and as we head into 2023 the economic outlook at the moment looks very difficult.\u201d"

                    "body": "Welcome to the reckoning up. Global sport has spent much of the past two years in a state of jet lag, frazzled by bubbles and firebreaks, by dates that aren\u2019t really dates, events that seem to be taking place in the wrong timeline. Well, here comes the centrepiece: Qatar 2022, the one non-negotiable, the fixed point around which this state of flux has revolved. Check the watch in your pocket, still set to Standard Tournament Time, and it\u2019s actually April. The World Cup is \u2013 cabin crew, seats for landing \u2013 less than two months away. And the lead-in kicks off this week with a round of Nations League fixtures, first steps towards a final in Doha on 18 December. At the end of which, red-eyed and jittery, the season is free to stumble back through arrivals and straight into the Christmas fixture list.  For England that run starts on Friday against Italy in Milan, followed by the visit of Germany to Wembley three days later. It is a delicious-looking double header and an unusually urgent prospect on two fronts. First, as the last chance to settle questions of personnel and tactics before a World Cup that many people, or at least many English people, seem to think Gareth Southgate\u2019s team should be among the favourites to win. And second this is the start of a wider reckoning-up for the age of Gareth. It has been six years now, stretched out around two tournaments, one of those a plastic, plague-ridden thing that began with a fudge and ended in a toxic hangover. In that time the England team has been reimagined, over-lionised and elevated to unprecedented peaks of (non-trophy) achievement; but also dogged by a strange sense of rage and dissatisfaction. The next 12 weeks may just decide which way this thing is going to go. Southgate has said he will not outstay his welcome. And it is always just a little later than you think. At which point, it is time to dust down some reassuringly familiar questions. Mainly, are England any good? What should we reasonably \u2013 that word is key \u2013 expect of this team? And just how distracting is the noise (because there is always noise) around it?  As ever the answers are related. On Tuesday morning, one national radio station was asking whether anything short of winning the World Cup should be considered a failure for England, who have won one tournament in 72 years of trying. Hmm. Good question. Let\u2019s break that one down, shall we. England are capable of reaching a quarter-final, with anything more than that a bonus. But two things will need to happen. First, they need to kill the ambient noise. And this is at least familiar territory. In many ways Southgate\u2019s time has been defined by the unceasing battle with English delusion, English exceptionalism, the self-sabotage of unrealistic English expectation.  He has won this battle once using his neatest trick, the ability to turn weaknesses into strengths. This is true on a tactical level. The England he inherited couldn\u2019t keep the ball and were weak in central defence. Solution: play seven defensive players, keep the ball deep in that rump, become impenetrable. The same thing has been achieved, more significantly, in the realm of feelings, vibes, energy. The England he inherited were also arrogant and brittle. By the time Russia 2018 came around he had a team defined by its galvanising, performative humility. We are the humblest. Gaze upon our humility and tremble, for we are England, truly exceptional in our lack of exceptionalism. It worked. The players felt no pressure. The country triumphantly embraced its lack of triumphalism. English delusion caught up with this too. The thinking seems to be: because we are now quite good we must as a matter of course be the best. The success of others is an aberration, a departure from some Arthurian state of grace. So the fact England have good players has been translated into \u201can unstoppable hand of golden talent\u201d. The rare success of reaching the Euro 2020 final has become the inexcusable failure of failing to win the final of Euro 2020. As ever this comes back to questions of scale. England are capable of beating Italy and Germany. But they are also bottom of their Nations League Group without a goal from open play. At the same time the idea of a crop of generational talent, the envy of all Europe, just doesn\u2019t stand up. Harry Kane is England\u2019s best player, top five in the world in his position, but with a gap to the Mbapp\u00e9-Lewandowski elite. Raheem Sterling, Southgate\u2019s second-most effective attacking weapon, left Manchester City to get more starts. None of England\u2019s goalkeepers play in the Champions League. Phil Foden and Bukayo Saka are good young players, but unlikely to inspire feelings of outright terror in countries who have their own broad hand of talented attackers. Which other elite international teams would be considering Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw for a starting place? Plus, in a stunning blow to the national psyche, other nations do exist. The struggle to process this is in many ways the defining battleground of English football and indeed of English culture generally. There are teams that just look a level above. Brazil have lost once since the start of 2020. France and Germany are strong. Would England expect, as of right, to beat Belgium or Portugal or Spain or Argentina? There is an ad hominem element to this loss of scale, a personal animus behind the urge to talk down Southgate\u2019s solid achievements as England manager. Many simply don\u2019t like his politics, his manner, his tactical caution. But Southgate has his flaws. There has been a lack of development, a sense other teams have learned how to combat England\u2019s simple gameplan.  Each major defeat in his six years \u2013 Croatia, the Netherlands, Italy (on penalties) \u2013 has come as a result of being outmanoeuvred and outpassed late on in tight knockout games when, as a rule, the best midfield wins.  The one real point of evolution has been the willingness to start the more progressive Jude Bellingham. But Bellingham is also 19 years old. And a progressive whizzy 4-3-3 lost 4-0 to Hungary last time out. It seems almost certain Southgate will retreat into his comfort zone, into the football of control and fine details. England need to win in the next week, or at least avoid defeat, because winning has been hard. Mainly, they need to create energy, to feel good, to find that pitch of missionary zeal. Trust the process. At this distance, it\u2019s the only one we\u2019re going to get. And it is worth saying again. England have reached five semi-finals in 72 years, two of those (two out of two) under Southgate. However the current jet-lagged journey ends, those achievements will stand."

                    "body": "Gareth Southgate has cautioned against heaping pressure on Phil Foden and warned it would be a risk to pin England\u2019s hopes of winning the World Cup on one player.\nSouthgate, who does not want to rest Harry Kane against Wales on Tuesday night, was accused of wasting Foden\u2019s talent after not using him in England\u2019s 0-0 draw with the USA. He has fired back at his critics by insisting he loves the Manchester City player. At the same time the head coach is wary of overhyping the 22-year-old, even though he is considering starting him when his side look to win Group B by beating Wales.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a great option for us in two or three different positions and he will have a big impact in games,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cBut also we have to be careful because we are putting a lot of pressure on him now. We\u2019re a team and we need all of the players and they can all play a part but not any one of them is the reason we will win or lose.\n\u201cWe need to make sure we are not building Phil into a situation where, if he steps on the pitch, this is becoming really difficult for him because the level of expectation is beyond a young guy who is still establishing himself internationally in a different environment from his club where you\u2019re comfortable with all the players you play with. We love him to bits. We also have got to look after him a bit as well.\u201d\nFoden is expected to play in a wide role if he starts \u2013 possibly in place of Bukayo Saka on the right. There is a possibility Southgate switches to a back three if Kyle Walker is included . Foden, who is pushing to get the nod over Jack Grealish for a starting spot, does not play through the middle for City.\n\u201cSometimes the discussion around just plopping him in as a 10 in every game isn\u2019t realistic because in a game like the other night you have to have the ball and there are defensive responsibilities that he doesn\u2019t have to do at his club,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cFrom the wide area it\u2019s different. He\u2019s got defensive responsibility but the role is different. In the 10 you have to cover a lot more ground and be a lot more aware of the spaces without the ball. \u201cIf that bit of pressure isn\u2019t right, then they are through you and into your backline. That is why we didn\u2019t put him in as a 10 the other night. There are games where there isn\u2019t that same tactical challenge in midfield. That might be the slot he can go and express himself. But his club don\u2019t do that, so there must be a reason for that.\u201d\n\nEngland will be at risk of going out if they lose by four goals to Wales, who are on the brink of elimination. Southgate does not want to rotate too heavily after naming an unchanged lineup against Iran and the USA. He is set to freshen up his midfield by starting Jordan Henderson instead of Jude Bellingham, and Marcus Rashford hopes to replace Raheem Sterling on the left. But he does not want to omit Kane, even though he said the captain felt some discomfort in his right foot against the USA.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t qualified yet,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cThere has to be a balance of freshness \u2013 the two games have taken a lot out of the players \u2013 but also stability. If you make lots of changes you can lose a bit of rhythm as well.\u201d\nSouthgate must decide whether to give minutes to Kyle Walker and Kalvin Phillips after the City duo\u2019s return from injury. He is confident they would not be short of sharpness in any knockout games.\n\u201cThey are in with the group in training,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cThey are able to adapt more and more to be ready for a game. Each couple of days that passes is better for them because they\u2019re getting more football.\u201d\n\nSouthgate was asked whether he thought about using Trent Alexander-Arnold as an attacking substitute against the USA. The Liverpool right-back is yet to feature in Qatar, with Kieran Trippier preferred while Walker builds his fitness after groin surgery. An option against Wales would be to rest Luke Shaw, move Trippier to the left and start Walker.\nSouthgate said of Alexander-Arnold: \u201cHe definitely could do it against a team that sits back. But that\u2019s not how I saw the game against the States. I don\u2019t think they sat back at all. I think they were aggressive and athletic in their pressure. But he has some great quality with the ball and can do that, but Tripps has great quality as well.\u201d\nEngland trained in hot conditions at their base in Al Wakrah. Only Ben White was absent through illness. James Maddison will be in the matchday squad for the first time after a knee injury."

                    "body": "Well, it is a pretty weird World Cup anyway. Can we asterisk this thing? Just a thought, but is it actually too late to boycott? Norway did the T-shirts. Good optics.\nFor Gareth Southgate and England this was another cowed and pallid step towards Qatar 2022. What is the perfect prep for these four-yearly moments of destiny anyway? How about not scoring a goal from open play for almost 500 minutes? How about three defeats in five games, topped by a 1-0 here against a so-so Italy? How about getting relegated?\n\nIt would at least be hard to accuse Southgate\u2019s team of peaking too early, of risking a loss of momentum, of doing the robot prematurely in front of Prince William. Six years into the age of Gareth, it has to be said this is the most feeble, the most incoherent this team has ever looked.\nAt the end Southgate went to applaud the England fans high in the gods. In return he was booed, a booing that seemed to swell and wax as he walked along clapping back, all alone in his patch of green. You who turn the wheel and look to windward. Remember Southgate, who was once The One.\nGermany on Monday, it has to be said, could get ugly.\nAnd is this thing really done? The players are still good, the manager has so much credit. The only real positive was the way the players kept running. At the final whistle Jude Bellingham sunk to the turf and just stayed there looking crumpled. Bellingham had barely stopped for 90 minutes, out there oddly exposed in a midfield that always seemed to be whirling about in too much space.\nEngland found a system here that made an elegant, technical, imposing midfielder look like a man being chased around a car park by a swarm of bees. But still, nobody gave up or sulked or looked ok with this. That\u2019s the thing that says there is still life.\nWhat about the rest of it? England were terribly poor in patches. And poor in a confusing way. On paper this was a progressive team, the team Southgate is meant to pick, the tossing away the cardigan team. Eric Dier in the central quarterback role! Bellingham and Declan Rice as a zippy midfield pivot. Kane-Foden-Sterling, the frontline Pep \u2013 racked, no doubt, with Gareth-envy \u2013 could have had. Even the wing-backs looked excitingly fluid, at least, as a concept, a hypothetical.\n\nSan Siro itself was an otherworldly spectacle at kick off, a vast Brutalist spaceship, with its huge clanky robot legs, the enormous expanse of damp September air under its flying slab roof. A stage fit for, well, what exactly?\nThis wasn\u2019t just a bad game for England. It was a weird game, with something mummified and vague, football played through a smeared piece of glass. From kick off England were jittery, a team playing with petrol station ball, always bouncing too high, always skewing away off the toe, buffering in the wind.\nSomehow the players always seemed to be facing the wrong way: for Rice and Bellingham much of the opening ten minutes was spent trying really hard to turn around. Italy aren\u2019t great. But in those opening exchanges the ball just looked softer and happier in their hands, curving in a more elegant parabola between the blue shirts.\nThey looked in those moments like England 1.0, Olde England, England for whom the ball is a ticking parcel to be hurled away as quickly as possible. Raheem Sterling had one of those nights where he seems to be playing on the jagged volcanic crust of the planet Mars. With 36 minutes gone he picked up the ball 45 yards from goal and just ran forward, head waggling, eyes on the swivel, like an impala bolting for the water hole, before deciding to spank the ball really hard at Kane\u2019s neck. Which was definitely an option.\n\nOnly Phil Foden seemed to have escaped in the first half, sniping into space, looking as though he actually felt ok about being in close contact with an inflated leather sphere. Teams are odd things. It is rare to see an entire one infected with shared ennui in this way. With an hour gone England had taken 14 shots. They had 56 per cent possession and made 88 per cent of their passes. It felt like a glitch, like lost data.\nThey went behind on 67 minutes, a moment of game-saving grace made by the toe of Giacomo Raspadori\u2019s right foot. Leonardo Bonucci spotted Raspadori\u2019s run. He caught the pass mid-stride, saw space and angles and time to shift his weight, then bent a low, hard shot past Nick Pope\u2019s left hand.\nEngland pressed harder after that. They did the switch, the only switch, Gareth\u2019s gambit, moving to a back four. And the thought occurred: really, still? Is that what you\u2019ve got? Are we not going to look for another variation? Southgate has never been a fine point tactical guy. He wants control, but not throttling control. More room temperature control, control that wears you down. The tinkering between three and four is very broad brush. And it has been six years now.\nIs this thing done? Southgate is a vibes man, a culture man, a manager who seeks to create a clean clear space around his team. The World Cup is now one game and two months away. Change can happen quickly in football. It was just hard, watching this, to see where that life will come from."

                    "body": "At one point in this collection of her Guardian columns, Marina Hyde devises a little allegorical tableau in which Chris Grayling pummels \u201cthe pulped corpse of Satire\u201d with a hammer. It was Grayling who as a minister bestowed a \u00a313.8m ferry contract on a firm that had no ferries, then wangled \u00a3100,000 a year for himself as an occasional adviser to a ports company. True, the career of such a nincompoop defies parody, but have our incompetent rulers really become immune to ridicule? No, indeed they have not, for in the sulphur-tongued, sabre-toothed person of Hyde, satire bites back. She is, quite simply, lethally funny. Over the six years covered in the book, she repeatedly annihilates Boris Johnson with epithets and aphorisms as her weapons, then kicks his cadaver back to life for further torment. She begins by pursuing him through a mythical underworld, reciting spells that cast him as a hapless figure from Narnia, Star Wars and Game of Thrones: by turns he is a \u201cwildly miscast Aslan\u201d, a \u201cgelatinous Sith\u201d and a \u201cblobby Cersei Lannister\u201d. She suspects him of trying to evade detection by metamorphosing into his dog, Dilyn, which starts to perform frottage on the lower legs of random passersby. Next, she slices Johnson down the middle and has him \u201cplay Henry V to his own Falstaff\u201d, a patriotic leader who is a seedy libertine under the skin. Elsewhere, she sets him on a squishy plinth as \u201cthird prize in a competition to build Winston Churchill out of marshmallows\u201d. At last she simply junks him, sneering that the affected disarray of his dress makes him look like \u201ca fly-tipped sofa\u201d.  Despite that dismissal, Johnson has electromagnetically tugged the entire country into his needy ego: Hyde, in one of her wildest conceits, defines him as a \u201cblond black hole\u201d. As \u201cBritain\u2019s id\u201d, he is also the sump into which our worst instincts have drained. But this dank bog is the source of Hyde\u2019s metaphors, which bubble up with effervescent bravura. Liz Truss, I fear, will prove less poetically fecund. Hyde\u2019s riffs crackle with the adrenaline rush of a live gig. They are also electrified, like a hot-wired car, by the sudden ignition that happens in her brain as apparently disparate ideas bump together and strike sparks. One column deals with the \u201cinvoluntary celibacy\u201d of unattractive men who turn to violence as a way of venting their frustration; citing Adam Smith and John Maynard Keynes, Hyde improvises a hilarious but entirely plausible theory about a market economy where sexual assault is a matter of supply and demand. In a commentary on Brexit, another head-on collision generates a gloriously smutty joke. Why did James Dyson, synonymous with hand-dryers and vacuum cleaners, support leave? Hyde\u2019s answer to the riddle is succinct: it\u2019s because Dyson \u201cbasically does things that blow or suck\u201d. A supremely artful and literally incisive writer, Hyde is aware of the damage words can do. Johnson is rebuked for instructing us to obey rules about social distancing \u201csedulously\u201d: no one knew what the showy Latinate adverb meant, which licensed him to ignore his own advice. Hyde unearths indecent subtexts in official pronouncements. When Johnson scoffed that sending Trident to sea without nuclear missiles would mean that \u201cthe whole country\u2019s firing blanks\u201d, was he bragging that the virile UK was capable of impregnating the world?  In a different mood, she writes anguished elegies for Jo Cox and Sarah Everard, and indignantly commiserates with the Post Office employees who were prosecuted because of faults in a computer system imposed by their bosses. Despite its uproarious humour, this book is an inquest on a period when the country voluntarily diminished and degraded itself. Hyde makes no predictions about the future, but remains astonished by the speed of the recent decline. Her title asks a question and then, by adding an exclamation mark, refuses to give an answer. All she knows, she says at the end, is that things may get even worse. In response to that, I can only quote her column about the sleaze-tainted decision to hold this year\u2019s World Cup in Qatar: there, in a wordless typographic outcry, Hyde transcribes a laugh that advances from sarcastic mockery to cynical despair \u2013 \u201cHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.\u201d \u2022 What Just Happened?!: Dispatches from Turbulent Times by Marina Hyde is published by Guardian Faber (\u00a320).

                    "body": "It\u2019ll be OK in the end. Won\u2019t it? With three rounds of Concacaf matches remaining, squeezed into only seven days, there is the potential for things to go wrong in a hurry as the US conclude their qualifying campaign for this year\u2019s World Cup. Of course, they might go right! And they probably will. But there is some negativity bias seared into the American psyche after the shock of 2017, when the US failed to qualify for the 2018 tournament. Bruce Arena\u2019s side needed only a point from their final match against Trinidad and Tobago yet contrived to lose 2-1 as other results went against them. The most unlikely scenario was the one that transpired. Phrases such as \u201cthe odds are very much in the Americans\u2019 favor\u201d no longer contain much comfort value now that, post Trinidad, they can always be answered with: \u201cYeah, but\u2026\u201d  The way to cauterize that wound is to qualify for Qatar. Victory in the Azteca Stadium on Thursday could achieve that, depending on results elsewhere, but the Americans have only won once in the thin air of Mexico City, in a friendly in 2012. \u201cOur record here is horrendous,\u201d US head coach Gregg Berhalter conceded in a press conference on Wednesday. The Americans\u2019 position in the standings reflects the team\u2019s overall performances: decent rather than dominant. It has not been an imperious march towards Qatar, a decisive shift from the previous campaign\u2019s convulsions. That was an unrealistic hope given the rebuilding required under new management and the emergence of Canada as a force. All but qualified, Canada lead by four points ahead of the US and Mexico, with Panama four points below them and fifth-placed Costa Rica another point back. The top trio qualify automatically while the fourth-placed nation earns a single-match playoff in Qatar in June against a team from Oceania, expected to be New Zealand. There is none of the complacency from the past cycle. \u201cOf course we use [missing out] as motivation. We were extremely upset and now we want to qualify,\u201d forward Christian Pulisic told reporters. \u201cWe definitely don\u2019t want to go through that again.\u201d Still, the schedule invites a dramatic climax. With Panama likely to win at home to hapless Honduras on Thursday, it\u2019s plausible that the US lose to Mexico and drop to third, only a point ahead of Panama. The two meet in Orlando on Sunday and Panama beat the US last October. Should Mexico defeat the US and Panama win while Costa Rica surprise Canada and move two points behind Berhalter\u2019s men, the calamitous scenario of a fifth-place finish would loom larger. As it happens, the US conclude their campaign on 30 March with a visit to Costa Rica, another place where they have never won a World Cup qualifier. The fixtures crunch gives Berhalter a selection dilemma. Avoiding defeat in Mexico would be a boost ahead of the clash with Panama. The US beat an unexceptional Mexico squad three times in 2021, so getting a draw, even a win, is not a quixotic notion. However, the importance of Sunday\u2019s game means that Berhalter may decide to save the legs of key players, while five are on a yellow card and facing a one-match suspension if they collect another. He said that he had discussed fielding a \u201cB team\u201d with his coaching staff: \u201cWe came out with our answer, and you\u2019ll see\u201d.  Injuries give the young roster a shallow aspect in some positions. Gio Reyna returns but the US are without Weston McKennie, Sergi\u00f1o Dest, Matt Turner and the only American ever-present in qualifying, Brenden Aaronson. McKennie, a tone-setting fireball in midfield, is an especially significant loss. \u201cIt\u2019s how you respond when you don\u2019t have your guys that\u2019s important,\u201d Berhalter said. \u201cEveryone we have on this roster, all 26 of them, can compete, and that\u2019s what it\u2019s going to take.\u201d Last autumn\u2019s apparent solution at striker is now more of a question than an answer: Ricardo Pepi is without a goal in five months for club and country. Tim Weah is a brisk winger but the onus is on Pulisic to carry the team\u2019s attack \u2013 much like the last campaign. \u201cI\u2019m feeling very good and I\u2019m feeling in a good rhythm at the moment,\u201d the Chelsea forward said. \u201cThis is a really hungry team who is going to give absolutely everything to make sure we have a spot in the World Cup.\u201d Meanwhile, while Berhalter has rotated and ruminated, carefree Canada, undefeated and guided lucidly by John Herdman, have emerged as probably the best \u2013 and definitely the most fun \u2013 team in Concacaf. A detailed dissection of the region\u2019s northwards power shift can wait for a few more days, though. Berhalter gathered his staff ahead of the trip to the Azteca and told them: \u201cThis is probably the biggest week of our lives as professional coaches.\u201d It is unlikely to be serene. But in the end, it will probably also be the best."

                    "body": "A winter of strike action over pay and conditions looms across sectors and services ranging from the NHS to transport. Ballots are taking place in a range of sectors while talks in some areas have come too late to avoid disruption. In other cases, agreement over new deals appears to have more conclusively brought industrial action to an end. NHS workers The Royal College of Nursing, which represents close to half a million nurses, has announced the first UK-wide strike action in its 106-year history will start before Christmas. Other health service workers could well follow suit. About 350,000 NHS employees from more than 250 health trusts and boards across England, Wales and Northern Ireland are being asked to vote for strike action over pay this winter, according to Unison. 40,000 members of the union in Scotland were balloted. Ambulance workers in Scotland and Northern Ireland have voted to go on strike, while balloting is taking place elsewhere. Junior doctors are to ballot for industrial action in January after the government failed to meet a demand for pay restoration to 2008-9 levels by the end of September. The British Medical Association (BMA), which represents doctors across the UK, said on Wednesday that it would be providing guidance shortly on how it can support nursing staff and other NHS colleagues in dispute. Royal Mail workers Two 48-hour strikes by Royal Mail workers will take place on Saturday and Monday in a row over pay, jobs and conditions. Members of the Communication Workers Union (CWU) have staged a series of strikes, with the latest due to take place on two of the busiest online shopping days of the year, Black Friday and Cyber Monday. The union and Royal Mail have agreed to enter a period of \u201cintense negotiations\u201d in an attempt to resolve a long-running dispute. University lecturers At least 70,000 university staff are to go on strike later this month. The University and College Union has announced its national strike will be held on 24, 25 and 30 November, with staff at 150 universities taking industrial action over pay, working conditions and pensions. Rail More than 1,000 Unite members at Transport for London (TfL) and London Underground (LU) take action on Thursday as part of a dispute about pensions, pay and jobs. Other strike action on the rail network this week has been cancelled, but there has been disruption to services, while future developments will be dependent on talks between rail companies and unions. The RMT union has said it will now enter \u201ca period of intensive negotiations\u201d with Network Rail and train operators but warned it could take action during the next six months to secure a deal. Environmental workers Trade unions are balloting Environment Agency (EA) officials on taking industrial action after a pay offer below inflation was rejected. A strike ballot of several thousand EA employees across England \u2013 including river inspectors, flood forecasting officers, coastal risk management officers, sewage plant attendants and staff maintaining the Thames Barrier \u2013 closes this week. Prospect, a union representing professionals such as scientists and engineers, will be balloting EA members from next Wednesday for one month. The start of three weeks of strike action by refuse workers in the borough of Waverley, Surrey, was announced last week by the GMB union. The workers, who are employed by the council\u2019s waste contractor, rejected a pay deal. Airport workers Hundreds of Heathrow workers will go on strike for three days this month, potentially disrupting travel plans for football fans wanting to fly to the World Cup in Qatar. The Unite union said 700 workers involved in ground handling, airside transport and cargo at Europe\u2019s busiest airport were to go on strike from the early hours of 18 November to the early hours of 21 November over pay demands. Dock workers A planned strike by dock workers at the Port of Liverpool, one of the UK\u2019s biggest, has been called off after a pay deal was reached. Nearly 600 members of the Unite union at the port, which is owned by Peel Ports, had taken part in industrial action and were due to strike on 14 November. Other disputes Members of Unite at Arrow XL, which undertakes deliveries for retailers including Amazon, are on strike each Monday until Christmas Eve. The union represents 350 workers at Arrow, which describes itself as the UK\u2019s leading two-person delivery company. HGV drivers and shunters at a M\u00fcller factory in Gloucestershire, which provides milk and other dairy products to Marks &amp; Spencer as well as Waitrose, are on strike in a dispute over rota changes. In London, security guards at New Covent Garden have been on strike for a week over pay."

Before Jones\u2019s seven-year tenure as England head coach ended on Tuesday it is believed he was being lined up by the Barbarians to take charge of the invitational side next May. It is understood there is no clause in Jones\u2019s severance package that would prevent him from taking a new job immediately but while the 62-year-old has already been touted for a move back to Australia \u2013 who had a mixed autumn \u2013 well-placed sources consider that a more likely proposition in 2024, after next year\u2019s World Cup.  Still, Jones is unlikely to be short of offers amid links to the USA as well as offers in Japan, while taking charge of the Barbarians could provide an early opportunity to show his former employers what they are missing in the buildup to next year\u2019s World Cup, right under their noses. Jones\u2019s only previous spell in charge of the Barbarians came shortly after the 2019 World Cup and, though his side lost, he spoke of the healing qualities that came with the role so soon after England\u2019s defeat in the final by South Africa. Taking the reins of the Barbarians \u2013 in a fixture expected to be against a World XV \u2013 could prove cathartic again after he was denied another shot at a World Cup title, nine months before France 2023 begins. The fixture is scheduled to take place the day after the Premiership final and, though no members of England\u2019s World Cup squad are expected to be involved, Jones could, ironically enough, be overseeing a number of future internationals from within the Premiership. Meanwhile, it is understood Jones\u2019s compensation package is significantly less than the \u00a3700,000 he would have earned if he had seen out his contract, which was due to expire in November next year. Jones was the top earner in international rugby but the RFU chief executive, Bill Sweeney, earlier this year dismissed suggestions that it would be prohibitively expensive to sack him. Sweeney said: \u201cBecause he\u2019s been here for the length of time he\u2019s been here he\u2019s subject to UK employment law. He\u2019s the same as me or you. He has a notice period and that would be exercised under UK employment law. There\u2019s nothing financially that would have an impact on a decision.\u201d"

This is not what our nation deserves.\u201d\nEzatolahi, distraught at the result, had been seen after the final whistle being comforted both by his teammates and the US players.\nMany Iranians had refused to support the national team, and after the match on Tuesday night, footage on social media showed crowds cheering and setting off fireworks.\nThe New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI) also reported that Samak had been killed by the security forces while celebrating. CHRI published a video from Samak\u2019s funeral in Tehran on Wednesday at which mourners could be heard shouting \u201cdeath to the dictator\u201d. The chant, aimed at Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is one of the main slogans of the protests. \nLate on Tuesday, the exiled Iranian journalist Masih Alinejad posted videos of celebrations on Twitter, writing: \u201cIran is a country where people are very passionate about football. Now they are out in the streets in the city of Sanandaj and celebrate the loss of their football team against the US.\u201d She also posted a video of fireworks being let off in Saqqez, Mahsa Amini\u2019s home town.\n\nIranians also celebrated in Marivan, which was among the cities in western Iran\u2019s Kurdish-populated regions where, on 21 November, security forces intensified a crackdown that killed a dozen people over 24 hours, directly shooting at protesters and using heavy weapons, rights groups said.\n\nThere were also celebrations in Tehran and Sanandaj, Kurdistan\u2019s capital.\nThe celebrations came after fans outside the stadium in Doha sought to highlight the protests and the Iranian government\u2019s crackdown. \u201cEverybody should know about this. We don\u2019t have a voice in Iran,\u201d an Iranian living in the US, who gave his name only as Sam, told Reuters.\nSpeaking by phone from Tehran shortly before kick-off, Elham, 21, said she wanted the US to win because victory for the national squad, known as Team Melli, would be a gift for Iranian authorities. \u201cThis is not my national team. It is not the melli team, it is the mullahs\u2019 team,\u201d she said.\n\nExtra security personnel, some mounted on horseback, patrolled outside the Al Thumama stadium before the match, while guards at the perimeter made Iranians unfurl their flags before entering. Police were stationed throughout the stadium alongside regular security guards. Some carried batons.\nEarly in the second half, a group of fans briefly held up letters spelling Mahsa Amini\u2019s name to applause from the Iranian supporters around them. Security personnel took their signs but allowed them to remain in their seats.\nUnder pressure to publicly support protesters at home, the Iranian team declined to sing the national anthem in their first game against England, which they lost 6-2. But they sang it before the second game, a 2-0 victory over Wales, and again on Tuesday. When Iran lost to England, there were celebrations in Tehran too.\nOutside the stadium after the match, Reuters journalists saw security chase two people in a series of scuffles on the ground\u2019s perimeter. Three guards pinned one man to the ground who was wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the words \u201cwoman, life, freedom\u201d, the central slogan of the Iranian protest movement.\n"

                    "body": "\u201cNo one wanted to take charge of the national team,\u201d Nicol\u00e1s Tagliafico admits. It was summer 2018 and Argentina had just been eliminated early from the World Cup. They had fallen against eventual champions France, true, but they knew it was coming. \u201cWe had only just qualified, we had only just got out of the group, the rope was round our necks and although you always have faith as anything can happen, at some point we were going to get beaten,\u201d the full-back says. \u201cIt was the end of an era.\u201d\n\u201cSo many things are wrong with Argentina that we don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong,\u201d Jorge Valdano wrote back then, citing a \u201ccrisis of talent\u201d, a \u201clack of leadership\u201d, \u201clost patience\u201d: \u201cnot even a genius [Messi] can make up for so many failings,\u201d problems of \u201csuch magnitude\u201d. When Lionel Scaloni was appointed as interim manager, it was his first job as a head coach and an unenviable one. \u201cHe had guts,\u201d Tagliafico says. Yet four years on, Argentina begin another World Cup among the favourites, Copa Am\u00e9rica winners and unbeaten in 36 games.\n\nThat\u2019s 34 more than Scaloni was supposed to get. \u201cIt was like we were starting over from scratch and it wasn\u2019t easy for any coach,\u201d says Tagliafico, one of seven players remaining from 2018. \u201cWe knew Scaloni as [the] assistant. He was recently retired and closer to the players, in a kind of intermediate, neutral zone, a territory somewhere between players and coach. He had the guts to help. And that\u2019s the key word: help.\n\u201cHe knew he wasn\u2019t going to be [permanent] coach. He would even say that to us. \u2018I\u2019m here to help identify people with the team again, help you grow.\u2019 Expectation had fallen and we could start building without having to win, win, win, win. Things started to happen, to look nicer. A few more games, a few more, and he started to realise \u2013 we did too \u2013 that you didn\u2019t need so much experience to be coach; what you needed was someone to help everyone pull together. So it started.\u201d\n\nThere was, Tagliafico says, \u201ca big trip-up\u201d at the 2019 Copa Am\u00e9rica, Argentina beaten 2-0 by Brazil in the semi-final. But looking back on this four-year transformation that\u2019s the moment he considers most important. It was also the last time they lost. \u201cThere was a new generation and an older one. We lost but learned, got to know each other, ourselves. We were growing. That\u2019s where the federaci\u00f3n stuck with the manager. Between 2019 and the next Copa Am\u00e9rica there were ups and downs but we felt something building. Fortunately, we also got the results that ensured nothing broke.\n\u201cYou get to the next Copa Am\u00e9rica convinced. Everything\u2019s in place. But if you lose, that could be that. Something could break. A relationship. Or maybe Leo decides to stop. Winning took a weight off. We hadn\u2019t won anything in a long time. That released the pressure \u2013 although it also generates expectation. For players like Leo, [\u00c1ngel] Di Mar\u00eda, who had reached finals and not won, it was something totally different. Emotionally it was the best thing that could have happened. When we returned with the cup, it was Covid times but the streets were packed, like the world was ending.\u201d\nAsked to explain why Argentina reacts as it does to football, he pauses. \u201cFootball changes our lives,\u201d he says at the start of a long explanation, a social analysis. Then, at the end, he stops, laughs, and says: \u201cWell, that and the fact that we\u2019re all mad, obviously.\u201d\n\nSuccess brings pressure, Tagliafico admits, but he agrees that this is a team that has been liberated. \u201cThe Copa Am\u00e9rica, going so long without losing, means there is expectation,\u201d he says, \u201cbut you know that\u2019s for a reason.\u201d\nThat reason is Messi? \u201cNot just him,\u201d the Lyon defender, 30, says. \u201cOf course he\u2019s the most important player, the plus, but we\u2019ve built a very, very strong group. If you look, we\u2019re not big names but we\u2019re strong as a team, good off the pitch as well as on it \u2013 and sometimes that\u2019s as important.\u201d\nFor Messi, too, seemingly more at ease in the national team than ever, just as the nation seems to feel more at ease with him, embracing him like never before. \u201cI feel that from the inside too, that he\u2019s enjoying it more,\u201d Tagliafico says. \u201cWinning the Copa Am\u00e9rica liberated him but I felt it even before that. I could see he was comfortable, and that\u2019s what we wanted: for him to have total freedom. Because when he\u2019s free, enjoys it, we see the things he does.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain why. I think he started to realise the selecci\u00f3n is not for ever, and that he has to enjoy it. Maybe being a father changes you, maybe he saw he had to play for his kids, not the people. I felt Leo always had that weight on his shoulders: \u2018I have to win for Argentina.\u2019 Fortunately, the Copa Am\u00e9rica gave him what he desired so much; he\u2019s even calmer knowing he has that and luckily he still has this World Cup left \u2013 maybe more.\n\u201cLeo\u2019s the best. Maybe we still don\u2019t fully realise because we\u2019re playing with him; maybe in 20 years I will. God willing, he can win the World Cup and end that myth that says he has to win it to be like Diego. What surprises you is the calmness, the humility: at times he can even seen shy, but he\u2019s a normal person you can talk to about anything. Sometimes I think maybe he doesn\u2019t know how big he is, what he generates in the world.\n\u201cIt\u2019s mad to think now there were people who criticised Leo. And why? Because he didn\u2019t win a cup. They overlook him reaching four finals, which isn\u2019t easy. He made it easy. But having not won, he got criticised. Now, that\u2019s changed. Maybe we learned. We learned through taking the hits, the bad moments, how things really are, how hard it was. And the people who criticised him ended up regretting that. It was unthinkable, but we learn.\n\n\u201cWe obviously won\u2019t say we\u2019re favourites,. There are teams that are very, very strong. Sometimes you lose, and it can be for some stupid reason. We don\u2019t need to build that expectation: we need to focus on what we can do. We know Saudi Arabia have been training together for a long time, it\u2019s the first day and we\u2019re thinking about this game only. The best start to a World Cup is winning. And something I learned at the last World Cup is: don\u2019t look ahead, following the path through. If you assume, it doesn\u2019t happen.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in good shape, and we\u2019ll be there with the big nations, but favourites? No. Feet on the ground. What has happened, happened: those unbeaten games, the Copa Am\u00e9rica. We arrive feeling strong, competitive. We have the desire, the confidence, and we know where we\u2019ve come from.\u201d"

                    "body": "As the dust settled on an extraordinary press conference by Keith Pelley, the European Tour Group\u2019s chief executive, at Wentworth, Rory McIlroy admitted friendships had been ruined by defections to LIV Golf. An emboldened McIlroy took withering swipes at Sergio Garc\u00eda, Lee Westwood, Ian Poulter and any LIV rebel who may contend at this weekend\u2019s PGA Championship. Pelley had earlier castigated \u201cthe LIV propaganda machine\u201d. Golf\u2019s civil war shows no sign of abating. McIlroy has been staunch in his defence of the PGA and DP World Tours against the Saudi-backed series, which now includes three of his Ryder Cup teammates. When asked whether his relationship with Garc\u00eda, Poulter and Westwood can survive, McIlroy replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I have no idea. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019ve got much of a relationship with them at the minute. But if you\u2019re just talking about Ryder Cup, that\u2019s not the future of the Ryder Cup team.  \u201cThey have played in probably a combined 25 or 30 Ryder Cups. These 10 cards going to the US [qualification for the PGA Tour from the DP World Tour every year] and preparing guys to play at the top level of professional golf; that\u2019s the future of the Ryder Cup, the [Rasmus] H\u00f8jgaards, Bobby Mac [Robert MacIntyre], whoever else is coming up. They are the future of the Ryder Cup team. That\u2019s what we should be thinking about and talking about. \u201cI haven\u2019t done anything different. They are the ones that have made that decision. I can sit here and keep my head held high and say I haven\u2019t done anything differently.\u201d McIlroy was deadpan when asked if there could be a route back to traditional tours for LIV converts. \u201cThey can always go through Q-School, yeah,\u201d said the Northern Irishman. McIlroy reflected on the \u201cnovelty\u201d of 15 LIV golfers appearing for a potential 72 holes at Wentworth given the three-day nature of their new domain. He was questioned over whether there would be more incentive to win here should he find himself in final round battle with a LIV player. \u201cI\u2019ll be trying to win a golf tournament regardless,\u201d said the 33-year-old. \u201cThey are going to be pretty tired on Sunday; it will be the fourth day.\u201d  Pelley has largely kept his own counsel on LIV matters. How that changed on Wednesday. Having hit out at \u201cirrational and ludicrous comments on social media\u201d an impassioned Pelley said: \u201cAs I said to our partners and sponsors on a Zoom call last week, it is easy to get dragged down by the LIV propaganda machine, churning out negative news stories and misinformation about the poor state of the traditional golfing world, including our tour. It\u2019s just not right. And let me make this perfectly clear; nothing could be further from the truth. We are in excellent shape and set to get even stronger.\u201d There have been suggestions Pelley walked away from a $1bn deal to partner with the Saudis. \u201cThere\u2019s only one word to describe that claim and that is \u2018fictitious\u2019,\u201d added the chief executive. \u201cYou can ask any member of our board of directors, and they will unanimously confirm that it was not an offer, it was not a deal, it was merely a marketing presentation put together on behalf of Golf Saudi.\u201d Pelley also took aim at Garc\u00eda after the Spaniard had said the DP World Tour \u201cis going to become the fifth best in the world\u201d. Pelley clearly does not accept that. \u201cOne of our members who is playing here this week actually said that,\u201d he remarked. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable. \u201cLet\u2019s look at the facts. If the metrics determining the top tours in the world is just money, then the No 1 tour is the PGA Tour. Always has been. You could argue that the LIV Invitational Series is No 2. But the Asian Tour, $22.5m Korn Ferry, $20m, Japan, $28m, Australia, $5.8m, Sunshine Tour, $7.4m. Totalling all their prize funds together comes to just half of our tour. So even if the only metric is money, how possibly could we ever become No 5?\u201d Pelley, having brought playing opportunities, broadcast partners and national reach into the same debate. \u201cYet one of our players said we are on the way to being No 5. Wow.\u201d A number of LIV golfers believe they should be allowed to compete in that series as well as the DP World or PGA Tours. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s OK to break the rules and regulations without consequences,\u201d Pelley argued. He has a key ally in McIlroy."

                    "body": "This might just be his World Cup after all. Lionel Messi must battle football opponents and the sands of time in equal measure but he dismissed both with a flourish that, whatever becomes of him and Argentina from here, made a mockery of fears he would leave this stage quietly. His side were a slip away from oblivion on an intense, pressured and niggly night where the possible consequences manifestly stifled everyone in view. Messi was among that number until breaching a limited Mexico, whose involvement now hangs by a thread, in thrilling style. It guarantees him at least one more dance atop the pinnacle of a sport he has bent to his will.\nMessi\u2019s left-foot finish was outdone aesthetically by a sumptuous late curler from Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez but only one of the goals has a chance of resounding through the ages. It silenced the sighs, minutes previously, when he sent a wayward pass over the left touchline. Argentina had barely created an opening with the second half nearing its midway point but, after \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda had clipped a deliberate ball across from the opposite side, the tenor shifted emphatically.\n\nDi Mar\u00eda had located a rare sliver of space 22 yards out but Messi\u2019s first touch, cushioning the ball to set up the shot, was simple yet masterful poetry. It meant he could take aim before a diving H\u00e9ctor Herrera was able to block, raking a precise low drive to Guillermo Ochoa\u2019s left and bringing pandemonium. Argentina would have been sent home had they lost: there was no chance of that now and the latter stages brought reminders of how compelling this team may look when cutting loose. The memory of Messi\u2019s desolation upon bowing out to France in Kazan four years ago remains poignant; as he pirouetted near halfway and set another counterattack in train with the task almost done, there was an altogether different sense of sheer enjoyment.\nWhat an occasion the first genuinely big-ticket event of Qatar 2022 turned out to be. It is difficult to suspend one\u2019s profound unease around the foundations on which this competition was built but, taking it on its own merits, the atmosphere inside this gaping arena was nothing short of electric. The host nation could not have asked for a more vibrant audiovisual display to show its audience: the hymns from galleries flowing with light blue echoed under the roof and were almost matched in volume by the cacophony emitted by large pockets of Mexicans, outnumbered but insistently present, clad in green.\n\nEvery one of them knew the stakes. So did those on the field and there was evident appetite to show it. Within seven minutes Alexis Vega, the Mexico forward, had left Gonzalo Montiel writhing with a flung arm and dumped Rodrigo De Paul on his backside. Soon De Paul found himself the centre of attention again, thudded into Andr\u00e9s Guardado, and if Mexico lacked edge in their attacking forays they were happy to compensate through snap and snarl.\nN\u00e9stor Araujo proved the point next, leaving Marcos Acu\u00f1a in a heap with a challenge that took ball and a sizeable chunk of man. De Paul, surely feeling victimised by now, was crunched from behind by Vega and Argentina howled when H\u00e9ctor Moreno appeared to check Messi off the ball.\n\nThat is a distillation of the opening period\u2019s rap sheet, and more or less its action, although Argentina were far from angels themselves. The right-back Montiel, one of five newcomers to Lionel Scaloni\u2019s starting lineup, showed as much before half-time when sending Erick Guti\u00e9rrez, who had recently replaced the injured Guardado, flying into the air. But their greater preoccupation was to find a semblance of rhythm and, by the break, it had eluded them.\nHad Scaloni changed too much? They showed little cohesion despite a steadily improved share of territory, the decision to drop Leandro Paredes from the midfield looking particularly suspect. Messi sought oxygen but found one of Mexico\u2019s three centre-backs, usually Moreno, stepping out to smother. He managed to nod ambitiously over and forced Ochoa to punch away an angled set piece; Lautaro Mart\u00ednez was wayward with a header but the most eyecatching moment came when Emiliano Mart\u00ednez, perhaps keen to offer the cameramen a spectacle away from the surrounding collage, dived to catch Vega\u2019s free-kick.\nThe quality had to be better. Or maybe it did not, because the tension and aversion to defeat was plainly inhibiting all concerned. Four minutes after the restart Argentina threatened their slickest move yet when Alexis Mac Allister sent Messi towards the box only for Guti\u00e9rrez to dive in illegally. Messi drifted the free-kick high to audible groans. The concern grew louder when Messi and Lautaro Mart\u00ednez failed to read each other, the former finding only the advertising hoardings.\nYe of little faith. Messi quickly rolled back the years and passed to Fern\u00e1ndez for the cherry on top. This troubled jamboree retains its most essential source of life."

                    "body": "In 2019, Andrew Redmayne made me a coffee. I was at the training base of his team, Sydney FC, waiting to conduct some pre-season interviews when the goalkeeper caught me attempting to use the club\u2019s machine and intervened. He had completed a barista course about three years prior, he said, because he\u2019d been fed up with football and ready to retire at 27 to work at a friend\u2019s cafe.\nBack then he was playing for crosstown rivals the Western Sydney Wanderers and was on a wretched run of form. He was certainly not wiggling, and the very thought of being selected for the national team was borderline absurd \u2013 never mind saving a penalty to send his country to a World Cup. Dropped to the bench and maligned by many fans for no reason in particular, the daily grind had taken its toll.\n\nRedmayne\u2019s original career plan had been to finish his degree while playing and then become a primary school teacher. But when he started dreading the very thought of football, he quietly spoke with his wife and his financial advisor.\n\u201cIt was set in motion,\u201d he said that day at the coffee machine. \u201cIt was financially viable just to work in one of my mate\u2019s cafes and do uni during the day and probably just NPL at night. I was happy to see out my time at Wanderers, then move back to Melbourne.\n\u201cSelf-belief came into it \u2013 I just didn\u2019t think I was good enough, to be honest. It was a pretty rough stage of my life.\u201d\nRedmayne always had the talent. As a teenager he trialled at Arsenal and was initially offered a youth contract before the club withdrew it and signed a young Wojciech Szcz\u0119sny instead. So he stayed in Australia and hopped from club to club, most of it tortured by self-doubt and cruel social media commentary \u2013 something of an irony given the abundance of complimentary memes now circulating the internet.\nAt the very moment he was ready to throw in the towel, something happened. In January 2017 he was sent to Graham Arnold\u2019s Sydney FC on a swap deal. The move reunited him with his first goalkeeping coach, John Crawley, the man who also developed the Socceroos\u2019 No 1 Mat Ryan.\n\nBy his own retrospective reckoning, Redmayne was \u201crubbish\u201d then. But Crawley helped rebuild him from scratch. And when the club\u2019s first-choice keeper, Danny Vukovic, moved to Belgium, he took his spot.\nThen some more things happened. He started to wear a hot pink strip. He started to save quite a few penalties. And, most divertingly, he started to dance. It was not a cool-kid dance, either. More daggy dad \u2013 a loosey-goosey limb flail which lightly entertained viewers and bewildered opposing players. He was thus ordained \u201cThe Pink Wiggle\u201d.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a sitting duck anyway so you may as well try and fly, I guess,\u201d Redmayne said in early 2019, three months before his penalty-shootout heroics helped Sydney win the A-League Men grand final. \u201cI\u2019ve just caught a bug \u2026 I haven\u2019t saved [a penalty] my whole career and now I\u2019ve saved four this year. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.\u201d\nRedmayne had turned a corner. He was high on confidence, trusting his instincts and quoting Dolly Parton (\u201cFind out who you are and do it on purpose\u201d). He told no one at the club how close he had come to retiring. In May of 2019, after Arnold was appointed Socceroos boss and took Crawley with him, a 30-year-old Redmayne earned his first international call-up.\nBefore Tuesday\u2019s World Cup qualifying playoff against Peru, the now 33-year-old had two caps. Until the dying moments of extra-time it looked as if it would stay that way \u2013 until Arnold enacted his massive gamble of a plan.\n\u201cThey [Peru] would have prepared all week thinking Maty [Ryan] was going to be in goals,\u201d Redmayne said post-match. \u201cTo put me on would have thrown them a little bit.\u201d It might also have thrown Ryan, who was unaware of the secret scheme until he was taken off just before the shootout.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any of the players knew about it,\u201d Redmayne said. \u201cA few clocked on at half-time because I went through a few drills to keep the eye in. Maty was full of support coming off and then just before penalties as well, he was pumping me up and getting me ready \u2026 when we were in a huddle he said \u2018you\u2019ve got this mate, this is all you\u2019.\u201d\n\nAnd it was. This time Redmayne was wearing grey, not pink. But his routine was no less dazzling. He waved his arms and swung his legs, thrashing the air into a perplexing puzzle for Peru\u2019s penalty takers to solve. Luis Advincula hit the post to bring the Socceroos back level. A few spot-kicks later, he dived to palm away Alex Valera\u2019s decisive attempt.\nThen Redmayne went viral. Partly it was the save and partly the celebration \u2013 not so much a grin but a wide-eyed, open-mouthed \u2018here I am\u2019. In truth, the only reason he stood still instead of running straight off towards his teammates was because the referee had told him to, predicting that his unconventional movement would probably require a VAR check to ensure he had not come off his line.\nIt was all still stupidly beautiful. Five years ago Redmayne was about to quit football to become a barista. Five minutes ago he had only played a single match of this entire World Cup qualifying campaign \u2013 against 168th-ranked Nepal. Now he is an Australian icon. A meme of international repute. The hero in grey who helped the Socceroos to a fifth straight World Cup."

                    "body": "When 2022\u2019s trend generator Julia Fox attended the Council of Fashion Designers of America awards earlier this month, for once it wasn\u2019t the barely-there dress that hit the headlines. Instead, it was her hair, which was dyed an unmistakable shade of oyster grey. Fox commented on the look at the event. \u201cThis is a love letter to getting older,\u201d she said. The actor and model is 32. Fox is not the only younger woman embracing this hair colour. Ariana Grande experimented with the shade in 2018, when she was 27, while Zosia Mamet (34), Jade Thirlwall (29) and Winnie Harlow (28) have also been seen sporting the grey look. Men have been getting involved, too, with USA defender Sergi\u00f1o Dest sporting oyster grey hair in Qatar during this year\u2019s World Cup. \u201cI think the term \u2018grey hair\u2019 still connotes ageing,\u201d says Jacqueline Kilikita, the deputy beauty director at Refinery29. \u201cBut words like \u2018oyster\u2019, \u2018pearlescent blond\u2019 etc are taking what is essentially grey hair and giving it a buzzy new name. Perhaps these names are making grey hair cooler or more accepted.\u201d It\u2019s a trend that is taking off beyond celebrities \u2013 specifically, as Kilikita says, in this oyster grey (sometimes also called silver grey) shade. The hashtag #silvergreyhair has 1.9m views on TikTok \u2013 with much of the content skewed to younger creators. Salons including Rush, Blue Tit and Bleach also report an increase in requests for the colour. Why are younger generations taking to a hair colour so associated with age? The contrast between a youthful face and grey hair could be seen as a visual stunt or a bit of a humblebrag \u2013 or it could be that they are aiming to \u201caccelerate\u201d the ageing process so it\u2019s less noticeable further down the line. Or \u2013 perhaps \u2013 we might actually be at the start of a change in societal norms around the symbolism of grey hair. \u201cAs winter quickly approaches, the trend will become even more popular,\u201d predicts Seung Ki Baek, an artistic team member at Rush. \u201cWe started to notice this trend in the summer season but, as the weather gets colder, many of us look to cool down our hair colour.\u201d  As Ki Baek implies, grey hair for this younger demographic is an aesthetic choice \u2013 rather than an inevitability to be either embraced or covered up \u2013 and a move away from previous conversations surrounding grey tresses. When actors including Helen Mirren (77) and Andie McDowell (64) appeared on the red carpet with grey hair earlier this year, it was viewed as something empowering for older women, who are rejecting the idea that to be beautiful you also have to be young. McDowell called the look \u201cbadass\u201d, echoing the sentiment of social media\u2019s #greyhairdontcare hashtag. To an extent, the movement of older women embracing grey hair has also pushed back against Fox\u2019s comments and a TikTok where she complained about anti-ageing labels on beauty products, proclaiming: \u201cGetting old is fucking hot. It is sexy.\u201d Carol McGiffin, a host on Loose Women, said: \u201cShe started off well because she said it was about the product, and then she just said: \u2018Ageing is great, ageing is hot.\u2019 She\u2019s 30 years old! Tell me that when you\u2019re 62, love.\u201d  The actor and model Ocean Navarro sees the colour as an aesthetic choice. The 26-year-old prefers an oyster grey shade and first dyed her hair this colour in 2018. \u201cI just love how it brings out my features, and it\u2019s such a sleek colour that matches my skin tone well,\u201d she says. Navarro says she grew up wanting grey or silver hair. In fact, she says: \u201cI am genuinely excited for the day I am just like my dad, who is all white and grey.\u201d Oyster grey, done right, has a different, almost otherworldly quality that feels far away from common-or-garden grey. \u201cIt features glimmers of shimmering silver tones \u2013 like that of an oyster shell \u2013 and is truly mesmerising,\u201d says Ki Baek. Older people embracing grey are encouraged to use treatments and masks to ensure their hair looks its best. But achieving this colour with dye is an even more time-consuming and high-maintenance process \u2013 especially for those with naturally dark locks, who will sometimes have to have their hair lightened several times before the grey colour is applied.  Ki Baek says balayage grey styles \u2013 where oyster grey colour is painted on sections of hair and blends with the natural colour \u2013 is also popular with those who are just beginning to turn grey. \u201cIt\u2019s the perfect colour that allows you to blend or embrace your natural greying hairs,\u201d agrees Kilikita. Ki Baek believes the combination of younger generations experimenting with oyster grey and older people embracing natural hues can only be a good thing for an age-diverse idea of beauty. \u201cGrey hair is now seen as trendy and cool,\u201d she says. \u201cOlder men and women who sport this hair colour are no longer seen as \u2018old\u2019. Instead, they are seen as stylish.\u201d "

                    "body": "Alexander-Arnold is the name on the back of both Romijn and Benjamin Lijnders\u2019s Liverpool shirts. \u201cThat is daddy pushing, I pushed for them to do that,\u201d their father, Pepijn Lijnders, admits. The Liverpool assistant manager\u2019s pride in Trent Alexander-Arnold is unmistakable and understandable, having seen his former under-16s captain win every major club trophy available by the age of 23, but his belief that the right-back should be England\u2019s first choice at the World Cup is not founded in bias. It is shaped by Lijnders\u2019s outlook on how the game should be played. \u201cIt is only my opinion but, if you see the game in an attacking way, he gave that position such a creative boost over the last few years. Like Cafu did in the past,\u201d says J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s right-hand man. \u201cFor me there are no limits for Trent and if you see the game in a certain way then for sure [he should start in Qatar]. But you can see the game in many different ways.\u201d  As Klopp writes in the foreword to Lijnders\u2019s new book Intensity, his assistant \u201cdoesn\u2019t make distinctions. He\u2019s never a snob or judgemental, like some within the professional game can be.\u201d The book was launched this week, with Lijnders\u2019s two young sons, wife and parents in attendance, and provides an illuminating insight into Liverpool\u2019s pursuit of the quadruple last season. It is a diary and coaching manual in one, written with Klopp\u2019s full support, in which the development of young talent like Alexander-Arnold clearly underpins Lijnders\u2019s unbridled passion for the job. Gareth Southgate\u2019s use of a player with 14 starts for England has long been a bewilderment to the Liverpool management team but Lijnders is convinced the defender will only improve this season. \u201cThere is no limit to him,\u201d he adds. \u201cIf you saw pre-season then the games he played he reached a new level. The way he dominated the right side offensively but also defensively was remarkable and when I see this boy it just makes me really proud. He trains in the same way he was when he was 15 \u2013 the smile, the fire. \u201cOur relationship is very strong and you don\u2019t have many captains in your life as a coach hopefully, otherwise that would mean you work in many different clubs and that is not a good sign. The bond between the manager and the captain will never pass. I see a boy who grew, who is still growing and I really believe that life doesn\u2019t have limits. You have to stay creative, stay unpredictable. Trent sees things that the stadium doesn\u2019t see. He sees things that I don\u2019t see. It is for us to put him in the right position to excel.\u201d  Lijnders says last season felt like a marathon with Liverpool competing in all 63 matches it was possible to play. With a World Cup in the middle of this one, when Liverpool will take their remaining players to a mid-season training camp in Dubai, he likens it to \u201ca sprint, a break and then a sprint again\u201d. He adds: \u201cSo it is important to start fast and Dubai has to create [a base] that we start fast again after the World Cup. You cannot waste time in this season. The season being interrupted is something new that we all have to deal with. The team that deals well with that and understands that will have a bigger chance.\u201d How Liverpool adapt to the loss of Sadio Man\u00e9 and arrival of Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez will, of course, also influence their chances of stopping Manchester City winning a hat-trick of Premier League titles. Lijnders admits that, if he could change one thing about his diary of last season, it would be \u201cbeating City in the direct confrontations\u201d. He is convinced the Uruguay international, signed for a potential club record \u00a385m, will enable Klopp\u2019s team to continue challenging on all fronts. \u201cTop players never ruin things,\u201d Liverpool\u2019s assistant manager says. \u201cThere were not many strikers last year who caused a lot of issues for our centre-halves but he was definitely one of them. We are really happy with him. When we want to sign someone, we sign them for the first 11. That doesn\u2019t mean we only have 11 players. It means you want players who you feel can make a difference in the big games.  \u201cThe question always lies in: are you fighting to become a champion or fighting for the top four? That is a big difference and people underestimate it. The team needs the consistency that we have created over the last year and the signings that you make have to have this immediate impact. That is not easy, that means there is a lot of work. \u201cThat is why we are so happy with our scouting department and our sporting director. We really tried to sign the players who can make the difference. We feel that with our squad, and especially our front players, we are ready to compete.\u201d"

On Wednesday night all eyes at Stadium 974 will be drawn, inexorably, to football\u2019s version of a beauty contest: can Lionel Messi\u2019s rich attacking gifts guide Argentina into the knockout phase or might Robert Lewandowski\u2019s uncanny efficiency in front of goal enable Poland to eclipse the Group C favourites?\n\u201cWe rely on these great strikers but an individual cannot win alone,\u201d Czeslaw Michniewicz, Poland\u2019s head coach, said on Tuesday. \u201cBut it\u2019s not only a battle between Lewandowski and Messi \u2013 it\u2019s not tennis, it\u2019s not one-on-one, they are not serving! Robert needs his teammates, the same as Leo.\u201d\nNonetheless Michniewicz, whose side top Group C, one point ahead of Argentina, likens the South American team\u2019s talisman to the famous 80s and 90s Italian alpine ski champion Alberto Tomba. \u201cAt our team briefing we talked about Alberto Tomba on the slope; he was able to avoid everyone,\u201d the 52-year-old said. \u201cSo I need to put my players in positions to make a difference because, if not, Messi will score easily. You need more than one person to halt him.\u201d\n\nThe similarities between Tomba\u2019s technical slalom excellence and the PSG forward\u2019s elusive attacking manoeuvring have led to Poland\u2019s players debating how to stop \u201cMessi dancing between the poles\u201d as they ponder the best way to prevent him leading Argentina\u2019s dressing room in a celebratory post-match jig of joy.\nSo how, precisely, can they rein in a player who has scored 93 goals in 167 international appearances? Michniewicz turned realistic and rhetorical. \u201cPlaying Argentina you have to prepare for when you concede and to avoid panic when that happens,\u201d he said. \u201cHow to stop Messi is a great question. The world has been thinking about it for several years and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll find an answer. At 35 he says this is his last World Cup so I expect he\u2019ll be very ambitious.\u201d\nAt 34 Lewandowski accepts it could be his swansong, too, and Argentina\u2019s head coach, Lionel Scaloni, is certainly not underestimating the threat posed by a centre-forward who believes a habit of eating desserts before main courses and protecting his slightly stronger right foot by sleeping on his left side have helped to make him Poland\u2019s record scorer with 77 goals in 136 games.\n\n\u201cLewandowski\u2019s a top player,\u201d Scaloni said, emphatically. He may disagree with the notion that dessert first aids fat burning but he also appreciates the jeopardy \u201cLewangoalski\u201d could pose his team on a night when they may require victory to guarantee progress. \u201cAs a football fan it\u2019s a pleasure and a privilege to see Robert up close. You have to enjoy such a great player \u2026 but we\u2019ll be prepared for him.\u201d\nLewandowski\u2019s goal in the 2-0 win against Saudi Arabia last Saturday \u2013 incredibly the Barcelona striker\u2019s first at a World Cup \u2013 left Poland requiring a point at most to reach the knockout phase. Argentina, meanwhile, remain in slight shock after their opening 2-1 defeat against Saudi Arabia.\nScaloni could certainly do with Messi adding to the penalty he scored against the Saudis and the goal he registered in the rather more reassuring 2-0 win against Mexico.\n\u201cI know all of Argentina counts on Messi,\u201d Michniewicz said. \u201cWe\u2019ll respect him but we will still believe we can win.\u201d\n\nGiven that Argentina had gone 36 games undefeated before slipping up against Saudi Arabia that may be a tall order but Lisandro Mart\u00ednez, Scaloni\u2019s Manchester United defender, did not sound overly confident. \u201cPoland\u2019s a very tough opponent and Lewandowski\u2019s a top player,\u201d he said. \u201cLewandowski moves so well, he\u2019s so dynamic. We know we have to remain focused throughout the 90 minutes.\n\u201cBut we have to trust ourselves and our football. We were very anxious before the Mexico match because we knew it was all or nothing. We know what we\u2019re capable of but we also know we haven\u2019t reached our best level yet. But we\u2019re trying. We have to remain calm, give it our all and show the style we are known for.\u201d\nThe Messi/Lewandowski subplot is amplified by the pair\u2019s careers having often run along parallel lines. Although a very different sort of forward, Poland\u2019s captain effectively replaced Messi at the Camp Nou after the latter\u2019s departure for PSG and, despite the pair having not always seemed exactly best friends when competing for individual awards, there is talk that these two attacking gladiators could yet be united for one last hurrah at Barcelona.\n\u201cWhen Messi was there I went to Bar\u00e7a so many times to see him,\u201d said Michniewicz. \u201cWe should all be excited to play against him in a match where the stakes are high. This is a wonderful time \u2013 but I want to leave happy.\u201d"

                    "body": "It had to be. Surely? Fifty-six years and a day after being at Wembley to see Alf Ramsey\u2019s England beat West Germany to win the men\u2019s World Cup, I walked with my son towards the stadium in a state of nervous anticipation before last Sunday\u2019s Women\u2019s Euro final. As much as I cherish the memory of that historic day in 1966, standing behind the goal into which Geoff Hurst smashed his \u201cthey think it\u2019s all over\u201d victory clincher and then roaring like three lions at the final whistle, I felt even more involved and invested this time round as the Lionesses prepared to meet Germany.  Having reported on the national women\u2019s team for almost two decades until retiring four years ago, I was now a fan (wearing the autographed England shirt presented to me by the players on bowing out) with more intense pre-match nerves than I\u2019ve ever suffered before games involving my club Wolves. England had been the best team in the tournament; but we were facing our nemesis, against whom we had taken 21 matches over 31 years to record our first victory in 2015. Before that meeting, the World Cup bronze medal match in Edmonton, Canada, we had suffered some severe beatings by Germany, most notably the 6-2 hammering we took in the Euro 2009 final in Helsinki. By that time I had become accustomed to such defeats. The first against Germany I witnessed, a 3-0 reversal, had come in the group stage of the 2001 Euro finals. As someone relatively new to the women\u2019s game at the time that tournament was not just a great experience, it also blew away any reluctance I had previously felt about reporting on it. I admit to having not been particularly happy at being despatched to my first England Women\u2019s fixture, against France at Yeovil in September 1999. I knew nothing about women\u2019s football and had no great desire to learn. But I quickly found myself enjoying it and, with much greater access to the team and management than is the case today, work became a pleasure and friendships were formed that are still standing today \u2013 it was a delight to have a beer with former captain Gill Coultard after last week\u2019s final.  The sellout crowd at Wembley illustrated the recent surge in the popularity of women\u2019s football, this after years of stuttering progress. It seemed that the game was on the march when, at the 2005 Euro finals held in England (though only in stadiums in the north-west of the country), a crowd of 29,092 watched the Lionesses\u2019 opening group match against Finland at the City of Manchester (now Etihad) Stadium. The team\u2019s first home match following that tournament, however, attracted a meagre attendance of 9,616 against Iceland at Carrow Road. It was far worse after reaching the 2009 Euro final \u2013 for the next home game just 3,681 turned up at Bloomfield Road for a World Cup qualifier against Malta. But the Football Association and in particular England\u2019s then-manager Hope Powell \u2013 perhaps the most influential person in English women\u2019s football in the last quarter of a century \u2013 continued to push for the game\u2019s wider attention and recognition.  A handful of journalists, myself included, were doing likewise although persuading sports editors to take stories was more often than not a difficult ask and the press boxes for those games could be lonely places. I covered 180 England matches in 32 different countries and rarely, outside major tournaments, saw anything like a full quota in attendance. The emptiest was at a Euro 2013 qualifier against Serbia in Belgrade: I was the only reporter there. How times have changed. A huge media pack provided massive coverage of England\u2019s Wembley triumph and of the hoped-for legacy it could inspire. While my former colleagues were reporting on the game I was watching it just as intently but also reminiscing, especially when Chloe Kelly produced her shirt-twirling celebration after stabbing in the winning goal. It didn\u2019t remind me so much of Brandi Chastain\u2019s similar celebration after her winning penalty in the 1999 Women\u2019s World Cup final, and definitely not Hurst\u2019s exhausted trot across the six-yard line after his hat-trick goal had won the 1966 World Cup final. Instead, I thought back to Kelly Smith taking off and kissing her boot after scoring against Japan at the 2007 Women\u2019s World Cup finals in China. Not as outrageous as Chloe\u2019s dash to fame, but a fondly remembered cheeky moment from England\u2019s finest ever player and another old pal. Smith\u2019s hand is on that trophy, just like Powell\u2019s and so many others who have given their all towards this great moment for English football.  A couple of days after the final my friend, Suzanne Wrack, wrote in the Guardian that it was impossible trying to fathom the feelings of myself and two other long-established women\u2019s football writers, Jen O\u2019Neill and Cath Etoe, at the moment captain Leah Williamson lifted the European Championship trophy. Well Suzy, there were no lion roars from me this time. I just stood there with a catch in my throat, gazing through tear-filled eyes around the stadium, taking in the on-field celebrations but also staring in wonderment at the crowd: 87,192 \u2013 for an England women\u2019s match! I never thought I\u2019d see the day. But it had to be."

                    "body": "While Ukraine lives in fear of the next mass bombing of its energy infrastructure by Russian missiles and Iranian drones, and constantly monitors the actions of troops located in Belarus, there are still small forms of normalcy, small forms of resistance. A blitz chess championship was recently held in Zhytomyr, a city 140km west of Kyiv and a regular target of missile attacks. Blitz chess \u2013 because slow chess is impossible in today\u2019s Ukraine, where everything has to be done quickly or very quickly. The games were played according to the Swiss system, and with nine rounds in which players have only three minutes a move. If in peacetime a person appreciates every hour of tranquility, during a war we appreciate every minute. Forty-four amateur chess players took part in the tournament. The youngest was four years old, the oldest 72. The tournament was organised by the regional chess federation and took place at Zhytomyr\u2019s Ivan Franko University. It was dedicated to the birthday of the local chess federation\u2019s previous president, Artem Sachuk, who is now fighting at the front. During the championship, money was collected for the Ukrainian army, and all funds raised were sent to Sachuk\u2019s military unit. Across town, Zhytomyr School No 7 hosted the regional junior female basketball championship. The competition lasted two days and ended with victory for the team from the Dynamovets Children\u2019s sports school. At the same time, in the city of Cherkasy, 300km to the south-west, Ukraine\u2019s Greco-Roman wrestling championship took place. The Afro-Ukrainian MP from Zelensky\u2019s Servant of the People party, Zhan Beleniuk, became the champion of Ukraine in the 87kg category. Beleniuk\u2019s father was a Rwandan citizen, a Hutu who died during the civil war. Zhan Beleniuk grew up in Kyiv and in 2020 he brought Ukraine its only gold medal from the Tokyo Olympics. The Servant of the People party invited him to become a member of parliament because of his determination and his popularity among sports fans.  Beleniuk, Ukraine\u2019s first black MP, was also a member of the country\u2019s National Olympic Committee, which held elections in November. The results of the ballot shocked Ukraine. Many of the newly elected members of the NOC turned out to be former representatives of pro-Russian parties or oligarchs, or officials close to oligarchs. In protest, Beleniuk resigned from the National Olympic Committee and called on all other patriotic newly elected members to do the same. The international football player Andriy Shevchenko heeded that call. He had just been elected to the position of vice-president of the committee. Shevchenko said: \u201cAt the most difficult time in the history of my country, I am proud to stand by Ukraine and help in any way I can for our victory. I consider it an honour to serve on the National Olympic Committee, I understand the importance of its development. At the same time, I cannot be part of such a lineup. We are paying an infinitely high price for our freedom with the lives of the best of Ukrainians. We must be worthy of them.\u201d While Ukrainians are outraged by the new composition of the committee, thousands of Ukrainian athletes are fighting and often dying at the front. Near Donetsk three months ago, a friend and colleague of Beleniuk, the wrestler Igor Pastukh, was killed \u2013 one of the more than 100 athletes to have died in the war so far. They have become known as \u201cSports Angels\u201d and a website has been launched in Ukraine in their memory. The number of angels in the sky over Ukraine is growing. In 2014, after the executions of protesters on the Maidan and nearby streets of Kyiv, those who died became known as the \u201cHeavenly Hundred\u201d. To those angel throngs we can add the hundreds of Ukrainian children killed by Russian army shelling and the tens of thousands of adults, including soldiers. The willingness of Ukrainians to support local sporting events is a form of resistance, but there is little interest in this year\u2019s World Cup in Qatar. Only the news about a fan running on to the pitch in a T-shirt with a Superman logo and the inscription \u201cSave Ukraine\u201d attracted the country\u2019s attention. They are focused on their own battles and on staying strong. As the Christmas and New Year season approaches, there are new tensions around how to celebrate. In Kyiv, after lengthy disputes, the city\u2019s mayor \u2013 the multiple-time world boxing champion Vitali Klitschko \u2013 has decided to put up the country\u2019s main Christmas tree on Sophia Square, as usual. There were protests from representatives of the presidential administration and other activists who said that decorating for a holiday during the war is neither ethical nor moral. But the mayor\u2019s office insisted that the war should not deprive Ukrainian children of their holiday. On the contrary, the Russian aggressors should not be allowed to rob children of seasonal good cheer, as it has robbed them of electricity, heating and running water.  I agree with Klitschko. War does not cancel Christmas and the new year. The war only increases the significance of these holidays for Ukrainians. Every festive event that goes ahead, every sports competition, contributes to the future of Ukraine. I hope that very soon competitions in classical chess will be held in Ukraine. These competitions will require prolonged silence, prolonged electric lighting, and the opportunity for chess players to think of nothing else but their next step and victory.

Hungary\u2019s resounding win at Molineux meant they did the double over Southgate\u2019s side, who also drew with Germany and Italy. None of those games brought a goal from open play and losing so convincingly against a side hardly ranked among the world\u2019s elite raises uncomfortable questions before the World Cup kicks off in November.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a chastening night,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cWe\u2019ve not lost many matches and when you lose so heavily with England it\u2019s going to be very, very painful.\n\u201cI feel for [the players] because, in the two Hungary games in particular, I picked teams where I tried to balance the squad, give young players opportunities, and I didn\u2019t get the balance right for them to perform at the level they needed to win those matches.\u201d\nSouthgate made nine changes from the Italy game but Harry Kane, Kyle Walker, John Stones, Kalvin Phillips and Bukayo Saka were among the regulars who started. \u201cThe players have been fantastic,\u201d the manager said. \u201cThe responsibility lies with me. It was very difficult to put the strongest team out in every game so we used it to prepare for Qatar. But of course a night like tonight is very difficult and it\u2019s important to take that off their shoulders because it\u2019s totally down to me.\u201d\nThe crowd made no secret of their displeasure as Hungary turned the screw in the second half, with widespread chants of \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing\u201d and audible catcalls from the stands. It was a far cry from the adulation heaped on Southgate for much of his tenure and he admitted the criticism was \u201cnot pleasant\u201d, while accepting it comes with the territory.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to accept that the next period will be unpleasant and uncomfortable, but you\u2019re never going to have six years like we\u2019ve had and not have difficult nights,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI knew the role before I took it. I would say [the change in tone] has happened over 10 days, not 11 months, but I saw all my predecessors go through that and I know great people like Sir Bobby Robson, what he had to go through and how he was viewed in the end on getting the team to a World Cup semi-final.\n\n\u201cFootball is emotional, people pay to come and watch, will give an opinion. The team weren\u2019t able to deliver tonight, that\u2019s my responsibility so if the flak comes my way I have to deal with that.\u201d\nIt gives Southgate plenty to concern him five months out from their opening World Cup fixture but his confidence in England\u2019s prospects has not taken a hit. \u201cWe\u2019ve always said we\u2019re one of the group of teams that can be pushing in the winter,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s different. Other big teams have had difficult periods in this competition, it\u2019s been a really unique set of circumstances for every country to deal with. I\u2019m looking at the balance across Europe and there are a lot of countries in a similar situation.\u201d\nThe Hungary manager, Marco Rossi, sees his team sit atop Nations League group A3 and said he would celebrate a famous win by watching the Red Hot Chili Peppers on Wednesday night. \u201cWhen I will die, I hope as late as possible, I hope that in the stadiums in Hungary there\u2019ll be one minute of silence, and this will be a great achievement for me,\u201d he said of the victory\u2019s significance."

Key stakeholders, including representatives from the Six Nations and Sanzaar, have been locked in discussions in Dublin this week in an effort to resolve the remaining stumbling blocks. A well-placed source has said that all parties have \u201cbroadly agreed\u201d the format of the competition but concerns linger over how revenues will be shared, the effects of promotion and relegation and the need to agree new player release deals with clubs \u2013 although the Guardian understands there is more collaboration than three years ago, when a similar proposal failed.  While the aim of bringing more meaning to the July and November Tests windows has been generally well-received, the main criticism of the proposal is that it would devalue the World Cup, which remains World Rugby\u2019s jewel in the crown. The Nations Championship would not take place in World Cup or British &amp; Irish Lions years, however, and World Rugby\u2019s chief executive Alan Gilpin said: \u201cWe have to be confident, firstly, that we can deliver outstanding World Cups and that the World Cups are the biggest moments in the sport \u2013 and they are. [The players] have been engaged through this whole process of the global competition discussions. \u201cConstantly you hear from the players that the World Cup is the biggest moment. For World Cups to be more competitive, which is what all the players and fans want, we need this shift in the calendar and the competition models, so they\u2019re just inextricably linked. We\u2019ll try and persuade people who are listening that world champions isn\u2019t the right name.\u201d Gilpin also revealed that regardless of whether the proposal comes to pass for the Six Nations, the Sanzaar countries, Fiji and Japan, World Rugby is determined to press ahead with plans for a second tier competition to launch in 2024 for nations such as Georgia, Samoa and Tonga, which in an ideal world, would see promotion to the top tier if it materialises. He added: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to wait until 2026 to create some of the emerging nations competitions that sit around that, because we can put those pieces in place now. And in all honesty, putting those pieces in place helps to drive the wider discussion.\u201d"

                    "body": "Guardian writers\u2019 predicted position 4th (NB: this is not necessarily Jacob Steinberg\u2019s prediction but the average of our writers\u2019 tips)\nLast season\u2019s position 3rd\nOdds to win the league (via Oddschecker) 16-1\nProspects\nIt has been a whirlwind summer at Stamford Bridge. Roman Abramovich is gone, as are the Russian\u2019s closest allies, and Chelsea\u2019s new owners have not had much time to get up to speed with the intricacies of English football since completing their \u00a34.25bn takeover of the club.\nYet the situation is far from disastrous. Chelsea have not gone away. The recruitment overseen by Todd Boehly, the club\u2019s new co-owner and interim sporting director, has been encouraging and there has been no sign of Chelsea curbing their spending. Raheem Sterling, who should make Thomas Tuchel\u2019s attack far more incisive, is a solid buy and Kalidou Koulibably is an important signing in defence following the departures of Antonio R\u00fcdiger and Andreas Christensen.\n\nIn that context the picture does not look too bad. Tuchel still has a talented squad and the return of Ben Chilwell from long-term injury is a major boost. A left side of Sterling and Chilwell? It does look pretty tasty.\nHowever it is doubtful whether the squad is strong enough to close the gap on Liverpool and City. Tuchel has issues in central midfield \u2013 N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 cannot stay fit and Jorginho lacks mobility \u2013 and Chelsea could be short of reliable goalscorers. Kai Havertz, expected to continue as the false nine, needs to become reliable. There cannot be too much of a goalscoring burden on Mason Mount and Sterling. If there is then Champions League qualification and runs in the cups may have to suffice.\n\nThe manager\nBoehly and his fellow board members are determined to back Tuchel. They know they are unlikely to be able to find a better manager than the intelligent, charming, tactically astute German. Indeed, in a notable change from how Chelsea were run under the previous regime, the aim is to empower Tuchel and hand him the kind of influence J\u00fcrgen Klopp has at Liverpool. That was certainly evident in the way Boehly backed Tuchel when it came to sending Romelu Lukaku back to Internazionale, not to mention when the American passed up the chance to sign Cristiano Ronaldo, cementing the notion that the former Paris Saint-Germain manager is in charge. If there is a concern, though, it is in how Tuchel sets up his attack. Chelsea lacked incisiveness last season and drew too many games. They need more creativity and ruthlessness.\n\nTransfer coup\nRaheem Sterling won four Premier League titles, five League Cups and one FA Cup during his seven years at Manchester City. He scored 131 goals for Pep Guardiola\u2019s side, is one of England\u2019s most important players and is approaching the prime years of his career. What\u2019s not to like? Nothing at all as far as Tuchel is concerned. Chelsea\u2019s head coach was determined to bring in Sterling after getting rid of Lukaku. Tuchel needed a proven goalscorer and he is convinced that the 27-year-old winger, who has joined in a deal worth up to \u00a350m, will make his attack far more reliable.\nWorld Cup impact\nMount, Sterling and Reece James are key players for England and they could come up against a few teammates at the World Cup. England\u2019s second group game is against the USA, whose key attacker is Chelsea\u2019s Christian Pulisic, and they could face France (N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9) and Senegal (\u00c9douard Mendy and Kalidou Koulibaly) in the knockout stages. Elsewhere Havertz and Timo Werner will be involved for Germany \u2013 but spare a thought for Jorginho following Italy\u2019s failure to make it.\n\nAlternative attractions during World Cup\nGood news for Jorginho: Handmade Chelsea, The Contemporary Craft and Design Fair, takes place on the opening weekend of Qatar 2022. Organisers say the event celebrates the very best of British craftsmanship. A bit like England\u2019s midfield.\nLeading the shirt sales\nIt is hard to find a more popular player than Mason Mount. The 23-year-old midfielder came through the academy, behaves like the model professional and has been a consistent performer since breaking into the side three years ago. Ignore the nonsensical debates about Mount\u2019s worth on social media. Some people think he\u2019s nothing more than a teacher\u2019s pet and say he brings little to the side, but they\u2019re wrong. Managers love Mount, who looks every inch the future Chelsea captain, and so do the fans who follow the team up and down the country.\nSocial climber\nThe oldest player in the squad appears to have no problem reaching the youth of today. Nobody can come close to Thiago Silva\u2019s 19.5m followers on Instagram. The 37-year-old Brazilian defender doesn\u2019t need anyone to show him how to make an impact on social media. Check in for training snaps, post-match motivational messages written in Portuguese and English, and wholesome family content \u2013 and while you\u2019re at it you should probably follow Silva\u2019s wife, Belle. She\u2019s become a cult hero for Chelsea fans because of her passionate support of the team.\n\nIf Chelsea were a Netflix doc \u2026\nA poor start to the season has Tuchel losing patience with the new regime and quitting on the spot. But when Bruce Arena turns down the job, Chelsea decide only one man can save them. Enter captain, leader, legend and tech extraordinaire John Terry, who spends his entire time in charge trying to sell NFTs to his new players."

                    "body": "The Formula One chief executive, Stefano Domenicali, has warned that races in Europe will have no guarantee of their place on the sport\u2019s calendar in future. The demand to host F1 is higher than ever and, with state\u2011backed circuits willing to pay exorbitant sums of money, Domenicali rejected calls for what are considered classic meetings to be ring-fenced as integral to the history and appeal of the sport.  Domenicali was speaking before this weekend\u2019s Belgian Grand Prix which has featured in 66 years of the F1 world championship since it began in 1950 and is adored by drivers and fans but remains in discussions to be a host beyond this year. This week Christian Horner, the Red Bull team principal, called for some classic European races \u2013 including Silverstone, Spa and Monza \u2013 to be ring-fenced as part of the sport\u2019s \u201cDNA\u201d. Domenicali insisted he believed the calendar should not rise above 24 meetings \u2013 the number that next season is expected to reach and the sport\u2019s current cap as agreed with the teams. However with F1 enjoying huge popularity this is far outstripped by demand for races. The Italian, who was formerly a team principal at Ferrari, said the European market remained a vital part of F1 plans but the circuits had to prove their place, especially given they do not pay as much as recent additions such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar. \u201cYou can be assured these places will always be part of the discussions for the future,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this is something that also on their side cannot be taken for granted, that if you don\u2019t do anything you will always be there. Because that is not right. \u201cMonza will be a celebration this year of the 100th anniversary of the Italian Grand Prix but as an Italian I always say to them: \u2018History is not enough. We need to invest for a great future.\u2019 Monza need to do their job, they need to update the structure, to update a place that is iconic but there is a need to look ahead.\u201d This year there are 22 races but F1 is in discussion now to hold a race in South Africa next year alongside additional new meetings in Las Vegas and Qatar and a return for China, if Covid regulations allow. The French GP is believed to be already off the schedule but Spa and Monaco remain without contracts for 2023. The pressure is immense with other circuits having concluded long\u2011term deals: Saudi Arabia\u2019s is worth a reported \u00a350m per meeting for more than a decade; Qatar will begin its 10-year deal next season, having paid similar money; while at the end of last year Abu Dhabi renewed its contract until the end of the decade. Domenicali insisted that financial imperatives would not dictate the sport\u2019s decisions. \u201cWe are a business where investments and financial contributions are very important. But we have always said that the traditional races, where we know they cannot bring the money the others are bringing, have full respect from us.\u201d"

Messi, who owns a condo in Miami Beach, has long been linked with a late-career move to the three-year-old Major League Soccer club.

                    "body": "They came to see their king and he did not disappoint. Three weeks before his 35th birthday but still as influential as ever, Lionel Messi inspired Argentina to victory over Italy in a \u201cFinalissima\u201d at Wembley that certainly lived up to all the hype. Billed as a showdown between the champions of Europe and South American and being played for the first time since 1993, there only ever looked like being one winner on Giorgio Chiellini\u2019s final international appearance as Lionel Scaloni\u2019s side stretched their unbeaten run to 32 matches. A former defender, Scaloni spent half a season on loan at West Ham in 2006 under the management of Alan Pardew and, with Messi pulling the strings from a deeper position, he has clearly assembled a side that should be considered genuine contenders for the World Cup later this year.  It has been nearly 30 years since Argentina beat Denmark on penalties to lift what was then known as the Artemio Franchi Cup after a former Uefa president. France won the first edition in 1985, with the match having been revived as \u201cpart of the expansion of the cooperation between Uefa and Conmebol\u201d signed in February 2020 between the two governing bodies as a direct challenge to Fifa\u2019s growing hegemony. Yet while South American teams are also expected to feature in a revamped Nations League after 2024, this was an opportunity for Italy to at least partially make up for their disappointing failure to qualify for the World Cup after losing to North Macedonia in a playoff. There were no such issues for Argentina, who sailed through qualification for Qatar unbeaten after ending a 28-year wait to be crowned South American champions. Messi was given a thunderous reception when he emerged for the pre-match warm-up and pretty much every time he went near the ball after that. Tickets for this game sold out in less than a week and there was a carnival atmosphere as the 37-year-old Chiellini belted out the Italian national anthem with his usual gusto for the last time before kick-off.  Back at the site of his side\u2019s triumph against England last summer, Roberto Mancini was immaculately dressed as ever in a sharp grey suit as he watched \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda try his luck from inside his own half after just 45 seconds, much to Messi\u2019s annoyance. The Italy coach has vowed to rebuild the Azzurri after missing out on their second successive World Cup but there were several familiar faces in his starting lineup here, not least Chiellini and his erstwhile defensive partner Leonardo Bonucci. Having seemed to negotiate a rapid start from their opponents, Italy began to create opportunities but were undone by a piece of Messi magic at the other end. A sumptuous turn left the despairing Giovanni Di Lorenzo trailing in his wake before a simple ball across the face of goal was tapped in by Lautaro Mart\u00ednez at the far post. Gianluigi Donnarumma could do nothing about Argentina\u2019s second on the stroke of half-time either as Di Mar\u00eda finished off a quick breakaway with Mart\u00ednez to leave Italy with a mountain to climb. Chiellini\u2019s race was over at the break as Mancini made three substitutions in an effort to stem the tide. Donnarumma did his best to almost gift Argentina a third goal when he took his eye off a back pass on the hour mark but just managed to recover in time. With his side becoming increasingly overrun, the Italy goalkeeper kept the score down with excellent saves from Di Mar\u00eda and Messi on more than one occasion, while Giovani Lo Celso should have made the result even more emphatic from a tight angle. The substitute Paulo Dybala finally did in injury-time after yet another lung-bursting run from you know who."

But the streaming buffet doesn\u2019t just extend to that quintet; there\u2019s a host of other, more niche streamers each offering up their own sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord of diverting shows and films. Let\u2019s run through the best of them \u2013 grab a plate! *** Lionsgate+  Price: \u00a35.99 a month Formerly known as Starzplay, this platform has long been seen as a bit of a hidden streaming gem for its collection of dynamite US acquisitions \u2013 it\u2019s where you can see Ramy (above), The Great and P Valley before anyone else \u2013 and bargain price. Alas, it\u2019s a bit less of a bargain these days, having recently gone up from \u00a31.99 for the first six months to \u00a35.99 after a 30-day trial. Still, with other platforms also raising their subscription fees, it remains well priced. The best thing on there right now: The (somehow uplifting) pandemic drama Station Eleven (pictured top), which is very much in the running for show of the year. *** BritBox  Price: \u00a35.99 a month Written off as a doomed exercise before it even launched, this BBC-ITV streaming collaboration is still standing three years on. It found its niche early \u2013 essentially it\u2019s where your mum goes to watch old episodes of Cadfael \u2013 but its hefty library of classic British series is backed up by some credible original shows (notably The Beast Must Die) and a surprisingly strong film selection at a competitive price. The best thing on there right now: Ratcatcher, Lynne Ramsay\u2019s bruising, Glasgow-set coming-of-age drama, doesn\u2019t exactly chime with BritBox\u2019s cosy teatime drama vibe, but it\u2019s a stunner nonetheless. *** Mubi/TankTV  Price: Mubi, from \u00a310.99 a month; TankTV from \u00a33 a month The cineaste\u2019s choice, Mubi has been delivering impeccably curated film picks for more than a decade. Leaning heavily towards the arthouse, it offers cinema that other streamers are unable or unwilling to platform. At \u00a310.99 it doesn\u2019t come cheap, but the \u00a316.99 option, with a \u201chand-picked\u201d cinema ticket included every week, may well entice regular cinemagoers. Boasting a similar format, though significantly cheaper, is TankTV, with themed seasons featuring Tarkovsky, Varda and Von Trier. The best thing on there right now: For Mubi, it\u2019s surely the sumptuous Portrait of a Lady on Fire; while TankTV is showing Terence Davies\u2019s recently restored masterpiece Distant Voices, Still Lives. *** Paramount+  Price: \u00a36.99 a month The newest combatant in our streaming wars arrives armed with a pretty robust catalogue of shows and films old and new. It\u2019s where you can watch South Park (still gleefully offensive, 25 series in), Kevin Costner-starring US ratings monster Yellowstone and an extremely pricey \u2013 if strangely not-talked-about \u2013 adaptation of video game Halo. A major player. The best thing on there right now: The frequently bonkers legal drama The Good Fight, which manages to knit everything from the January 6 riots to Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s death into its storylines. *** Shudder  Price: From \u00a33.99 a month A streaming service devoted entirely to horror? Your mileage \u2013 and tolerance for severed heads flying across the screen \u2013 may vary. But if horror is your thing, Shudder is a sound investment, boasting a truly impressive library, great curation (with collections on everything from Giallo to folk horror) and some inventive original shockers. The best thing on there right now: Saloum, a stylish and entertaining gangster/horror hybrid largely set in Senegal. *** Discovery+  Price: \u00a33.99 a month Once synonymous with hush-voiced wildlife programmes, Discovery now seems to churn out an endless array of reality telly and stomach-churning true crime.

                    "body": "\u201cFollowing Ally McCoist\u2019s tongue-in-cheek claim that Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 scored \u2018the first World Cup final hat-trick where all three crossed the line\u2019, are there any other examples of footballing firsts or records whose holder is disputed or shrouded in controversy?\u201d tweets Steve Hyde. A footnote in England\u2019s World Cup defeat to France was that Harry Kane\u2019s second penalty would have been his 54th goal for England, putting him one ahead of Wayne Rooney on the all-time list. But there is an argument that he should already be out on his own as England\u2019s leading goalscorer. \u201cSurely Coleen Rooney should be putting her considerable sleuthing skills to good use and examine whether her husband\u2019s international scoring record should stand at 52 goals instead of 53?\u201d writes Dylan Kenny. \u201cHis second goal v Switzerland in Euro 2004 is definitely an own goal.\u201d Rooney\u2019s second goal in that game came from a drive that hit the post before rebounding off the goalkeeper J\u00f6rg Stiel and into the net. A clear own-goal in 2023 but, as the dearly-missed Kevin McCarra wrote at the time, in 2004 there was a different attitude to such goals.  What makes things even more interesting \u2013 to us, anyway \u2013 is that Kane was involved in a very similar goal against Lithuania in 2015. But by then the convention around such goals had changed, so it went down as an own-goal by the goalkeeper Giedrius Arlauskis. Had both Rooney\u2019s and Kane\u2019s been judged the same way, whether as goals or own-goals, Kane would be one ahead.  And while we\u2019re on the subject of generously awarded goals, Gary Lineker should probably have 47 for England rather than 48 \u2013 his second against the USA in 1985 should have been an own-goal by Dan Canter \u2013 and Marco van Basten probably didn\u2019t score a hat-trick against England at Euro 1988. Slow down this video to 0.25x and you\u2019ll see his first was almost certainly an own-goal by Gary Stevens of Everton. No, we\u2019re not proud of ourselves. Pairs of world champions \u201cAs Lisandro Mart\u00ednez won the World Cup with Argentina, four years after Rapha\u00ebl Varane did so with France, when was the last time a team had a World Cup-winning centre-back partnership?\u201d asks VP Pranav. You don\u2019t have to go back too far for this one: from 2018-21, Varane and Sergio Ramos, who was champion of the world with Spain in 2010, were Real Madrid\u2019s centre-back partnership (when fit). In fact, it\u2019s not an uncommon occurrence. The Barcelona pair of Gerard Piqu\u00e9 and Carles Puyol also won the tournament with Spain in 2010 (though Ramos played at right-back), and Pique later spent some time playing alongside Samuel Umtiti, who was Varane\u2019s partner in Russia in 2018.  J\u00e9r\u00f4me Boateng and Mats Hummels (Bayern Munich/Germany 2014) also qualify, as do Frank Leboeuf and Marcel Desailly (Chelsea/France 1998) and Lucio and Marco Materazzi (Internazionale/Brazil 2002/Italy 2006). There are plenty more, but it\u2019s probably in nobody\u2019s best interest that we list them all, so we\u2019ll end with a slightly more offbeat example. Andrea Barzagli and Cristian Zaccardo both played in the Italy team that won the World Cup in 2006, and spent the next couple of years bolting the back door for Palermo.  Injured in their own testimonial \u201cI recently played my testimonial for my local team before I moved abroad. During the match I had the horrible misfortune of breaking my leg. This got me wondering: has there ever been a case of a professional footballer getting a serious injury during their testimonial?\u201d writes Andrew Wilson. Ouch. Testimonials are usually one rung down from friendlies on the ladder of intensity, so injuries are rare. But that wasn\u2019t the case in a pre-season testimonial at Old Trafford in 2000. \u201cDenis Irwin\u2019s in August 2000 was a pugnacious affair as Manchester United took on their then-plucky rivals Manchester City,\u201d recalls Colm McAuliffe. \u201cWhile Phil Neville was taken off with a head wound, Irwin himself lasted just 37 minutes having soldiered on after a ferocious tackle by the current president of Liberia, George Weah \u2026 which occurred in the fourth minute. Irwin was out of action for a month.\u201d  There are a couple of other games worth mentioning. Paul McGrath injured his right ankle during his testimonial in 1998, when he tripped over the ball and allowed Dean Saunders to score the winning goal. McGrath was able to play on for the last few minutes. Twenty years earlier, Johan Cruyff suffered severely wounded pride during his farewell match at Ajax, when Bayern Munich left their goodwill at the airport and decided to run riot. They won 8-0. All change, please Bernard Carthy tweets: \u201cThis year could see three teams (Manchester United, Newcastle and Arsenal) finish in the top four, who didn\u2019t finish there last season. Would this be the biggest change in top-four history?\u201d Andy Brook has kindly done the work on this one, and writes: \u201cThe last time it happened was between 1992 (Leeds, Manchester United, Sheffield Wednesday, Arsenal) and 1993 (Manchester United, Aston Villa, Norwich, Blackburn). The last time the entire four changed seems to be way back in 1912-13: Blackburn, Everton, Newcastle, Bolton; then Sunderland, Villa, Wednesday, Manchester United.\u201d Knowledge archive \u201cTottenham have currently played 30 consecutive Premier League games without drawing one,\u201d noted Wouter van Dael in 2019. \u201cWhat is the longest ever such league run?\u201d First, a bit of housekeeping. Spurs\u2019 run eventually ended at 32 games \u2013 four at the back end of 2017-18, 28 at the start of 2018-19. A few of you asked the same question this week, as Blackburn are on a run of 31 Championship games without a draw: five last season, 26 in 2022-23. But they are still well short of the record, as we discovered in 2019 \u2026The short answer is that Spurs are Premier League record-breakers, Wouter \u2026 but only just. \u201cBolton previously held this title with a run of 28 games between March and December 2011,\u201d wrote James Clarke. \u201cBut in the wider context of English league history, Spurs have a long way to go yet. Twenty-nine clubs have had longer streaks without a draw at some point \u2013 and seven have gone more than 40 consecutive league games without a stalemate: Birmingham (43 games), Walsall (44), Leicester (44), Bradford Park Avenue (44), Stoke (46), Sunderland (46) and Aston Villa (51). Although it is probably worth noting that Sunderland\u2019s is the most recent of these, coming comparatively recently in 1908-09. The slightly interesting quirk here is that five of these seven draw-less clubs are Midlands teams.  \u201cAston Villa\u2019s epic 51-game run spanned three seasons, and is rather nice since it started on New Year\u2019s Day in 1891, with a 5-0 win over Everton. Villa then went the whole of 1891 without a league draw, and almost made it through 1892 as well \u2013 until Bolton ended the streak with a 1-1 draw on Christmas Eve.\u201d  Can you help? \u201cWho was the first American to play for a major European team?\u201d asks Kurt Perleberg.  \u201cHas the Premier League goal of the month competition been made up entirely of goals from the same day or, to use modern parlance, gameweek?\u201d wonders Tom Ayres.  \u201cNow that Pel\u00e9 has passed away, is M\u00e1rio Zagallo the only living person to have seen both the 1958 and 1962 finals live?\u201d muses K\u00e1ri Tulinius. \u201cAs 1966 was the first World Cup broadcast globally, not many people saw the previous two finals live, either as a broadcast or in person.\u201d  \u201cWith two red cards and five substitutions, Crystal Palace finished their game against Fulham with only three out of 10 outfield players that started the game still on the pitch. Has any team ever finished a league or Champions League game with fewer?\u201d asks Nessan O\u2019Hanrahan.  \u201cIn Celtic\u2019s recent 4-1 win over St Johnstone, Reo Hatate and Kyogo Furuhashi scored all their goals. What\u2019s the most goals scored by a team in one match where there were multiple goalscorers and all shared the same nationality, but were not from the country they were playing in? What\u2019s the most for all the scorers in a match? What\u2019s the highest number of individual scorers?\u201d asks Tim H. Mail us your questions or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU."

When we made the booking my passport was in my maiden name and we were under the impression that passport details had to be input at the same time. However, my passport expires in August and Seychelles requires one that is valid for at least six months so I applied for a new one in my married name. In April, we contacted Opodo about this and I was advised to email a copy of my new passport and marriage certificate. However, a month later I received an email telling us that the airlines \u2013 British Airways (BA) and Qatar Airways \u2013 did not allow this type of change. We contacted BA directly and were advised to email copies of my old and new passport as well as the marriage certificate. But when I followed it up I was told to contact Opodo.  BA said our flights were being operated by Qatar Airways so we should try that airline. But Qatar Airways told us that, because we booked through Opodo, rather than directly with the airline, it couldn\u2019t do anything. We went back to Opodo and it suggested cancelling the flights and requesting a refund of \u00a31,698. However, the cancellation fee would be \u00a31,212. We are now at an absolute loss at what to do. We cannot afford to buy a new ticket. LP, Bristol You have been passed from pillar to post on this and it took another fortnight of chasing from me to sort this out, but in the end Opodo came through. It says amending names on flight tickets requires a specific process which needs to be authorised by the carrier that owns the ticket. An Opodo spokesperson says: \u201cThe name change in this instance was a multifaceted request as the booking includes codeshare flights, which means that some British Airways marketed flights in the itinerary are actually operated by its partner Qatar Airways.\u201d It adds: \u201cWe are pleased that after our intervention, British Airways has finally allowed a new ticket to be issued with the customer\u2019s updated name. While the airline requires the payment of a fee [\u00a3100] for this change, we will cover this cost as a goodwill gesture.\u201d We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

                    "body": "The veteran Portugal defender Pepe has questioned the appointment of an Argentinian referee to their shock quarter-final defeat by Morocco and claimed Fifa officials \u201ccan now give the title to Argentina\u201d.\nPepe suggested Lionel Messi\u2019s vocal criticism of the Spanish referee Antonio Mateu Lahoz after Argentina\u2019s penalty shootout victory over the Netherlands on Friday should have prevented an Argentinian, Facundo Tello, from taking charge of Portugal\u2019s 1-0 defeat to Morocco. Messi and the Argentina goalkeeper Emiliano Mart\u00ednez said Mateu Lahoz should be dropped for the remainder of the tournament.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable for an Argentine referee to referee our game,\u201d Pepe said. \u201cAfter what happened yesterday, with Messi talking, all of Argentina was talking and the referee comes here to blow the whistle. I\u2019m not saying that he comes here conditioned ... but what did we play the second half? We weren\u2019t allowed to play the second half.\u201d\nPepe questioned the decision to play only eight minutes of stoppage time and said: \u201cI can bet that Argentina will be champions.\u201d\n\nThe 39-year-old, who squandered a chance to cancel out Youssef En-Nesyri\u2019s winner deep into second-half stoppage time, was not the only Portugal player left furious. Manchester United\u2019s Bruno Fernandes is reported to have said: \u201cIt\u2019s very weird that a ref officiates us from a country still left in the competition \u2026 Ours referee the Champions League, so they have the quality and level to be here. They don\u2019t referee the Champions League, they are not used to this type of games, they don\u2019t have the pace for this. They have clearly tilted the field against us. In the first half there is a clear penalty on me.\u201d\n\nThe Portugal manager, Fernando Santos, refused to add to the criticism of the referee and said he would soon hold talks with Fernando Gomes, the Portuguese football federation president, about his future. Santos, who took charge of Portugal in 2014, is under contract until the end of Euro 2024. \u201cWe thought we could reach the final and win the final as well,\u201d the 68-year-old said. \u201cI will have a discussion with the president and when we go back to Portugal we will deal with the issue of the contract.\u201d\nSantos said he had \u201cno regrets\u201d over not starting Cristiano Ronaldo, who entered as a substitute after 51 minutes. The future of Ronaldo, who turns 38 in February and is a free agent after departing United, remains unclear. Ronaldo was in tears as he headed down the tunnel at full-time. \u201cI think if we [were to] take two people that were the most upset about the game perhaps it was Cristiano and myself,\u201d Santos said."

                    "body": "Out-muscled by England last month and out-coached by Argentina a fortnight ago, the Wallabies restored pride in the old gold jersey at the weekend, rebounding from their recent 48-17 shellacking in San Juan to whip the world champion Springboks 25-17 in Adelaide. With Los Pumas upsetting the All Blacks 25-18 in Christchurch, Australia\u2019s window to the Rugby Championship and a first Bledisloe Cup in two decades remains tantalisingly ajar. Hope can be a dangerous thing for Wallabies fans. But Saturday\u2019s performance instilled it. After losing the first 25 minutes of their last five starts, Australia began well for a change, racing to a lead on the back of fast hands and fierce running. An old head in Nic White found youthful legs in Fraser McReight after 62 seconds to draw first blood and signal the intent. Noah Lolesio iced the try then slotted a penalty to make it a robust 10-0 buffer.  Better yet was the smarts and heart the Wallabies showed when the momentum inevitably swung back to the Springboks. Against a massive \u2018bomb squad\u2019 of elite forwards, the Australians held fast, repelling the Springbok marauders with courage and discipline. Again and again they diffused each raid with rush defence, clever pilfering at the ruck or relief kicking which their back three chased hard to keep their visitors on the back foot. Chasing hardest was Marika Koroibete. The big winger played like two men all day (except for the 10 minutes when wing partner Tom Wright was sent off, when he played like three men) and was again the best afield. His defining moment was a try-saving tackle late in the first half. Springbok speedster Makazole Mapimpi had found space on the far left and pinned his ears back for a moment of glory like his match-winning try in the 2019 World Cup final. By then the Koroibete Express had already left the station. From the opposite corner the big No 11 had seen what no one else had and began to scythe a fast-lane parallel to the tryline. Shielded by the Australian cover defenders, the South African winger heard rolling thunder but only in the last gasp did he see the lightning bolt hitting him. Centimetres from the line, in a tackle heard around the world, Mapimpi was T-boned mid-air by Koroibete and sent flying. Apart from the fact that it foiled a certain score and kept the Springboks tryless at half-time, it was as definitive a statement of belief as has ever been committed to the Wallabies playbook. Yet the big fella was still asked to explain it. \u201cThe tackle had to be made,\u201d Koroibete said in his sometimes-you-gotta-do-what-you-gotta-do way. \u201cWe had one man down, we had to cover the short side and the other side as well. I just put my body on the line for the boys.\u201d Simple words. Singular actions. Covering for a mate. Empires have been built on less. The Wallabies will settle for another victory this week at the new Sydney Football Stadium. After all, winning two Tests in a row is a feat they haven\u2019t achieved for 12 months. The last time they did it, on 18 September, 2021, it was a repeat victory over South Africa and the start of what became a five-game winning streak. If they are to repeat that run they must first dispose of the Springboks on Saturday then inflict consecutive defeats on New Zealand.  When the Wallabies play like they did in Adelaide it seems possible. Particularly now, with the All Blacks in crisis after three successive losses at home for the first time in 119 years. Although much of the Kiwi rugby fraternity begged for breakdancing Crusaders coach Scott Robertson to be installed, New Zealand Rugby retained Ian Foster as coach until 2023 on the strength of the All Blacks\u2019 35-23 win over South Africa in Johannesburg two weeks ago. Now, having been outfoxed by Michael Cheika\u2019s Los Pumas, the falsity of that dawn throws harsh light on an unthinkable apocalypse \u2013 losing the Bledisloe Cup after a 19-year reign. Each time Koroibete\u2019s tackle is played on YouTube a fresh shiver will chill All Blacks spines. For too long Australia have been an unwilling accomplice in their own demise in Bledisloe Tests. But if they get it together as they did on Saturday, if they show the same belief as Koroibete, if young firebrands like Fraser McReight continue to fire, if faith is shown in fresh-faced schemers Noah Lolesio, and if million-dollar man Taniela Tupou earns his money, watch out. Right now it\u2019s a one-Test streak. And too often Wallabies fans have seen that light at the end of the tunnel turn into a train that snuffs hope and smashes golden dreams to smithereens. But beat the world champs again this week in Sydney and Dave Rennie\u2019s men are on a roll with only an out-of-sorts All Blacks outfit between them and a first Bledisloe Cup since 2003. And after that, who knows? There are 13 Tests between now and the 2023 World Cup. Maybe after a season of terrible injuries and dud luck, the Wallabies finally have a hope."

Tributes have flowed from across the music industry, with sometimes fellow band member and Crowded House frontman, Neil Finn, calling McVie a \u201csupremely gifted songwriter and a warm and wonderful friend\u201d.\nConcussion in sport | An inquiry proposed by the Greens with Labor and Coalition support will examine concussion and repeated head trauma in contact sports at all levels, for all genders and age groups. It comes amid growing concern about chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a disease which former AFL concussion doctor Paul McCrory has been accused of downplaying the risks of.\nMedibank hacker\u2019s data dump | The cyber-criminals behind the Medibank hack have declared \u201ccase closed\u201d after posting a file on the dark web that looks to be the remainder of the customer data they acquired. The health insurer said it was in the process of analysing the data but that it \u201cappears to be the data we believed the criminal stole\u201d.\n\n\n\nTikTok tanning ban | The social media company will ban videos that encourage tanning and add educational content to its platform in its place, after concerns raised by Australian medical experts. In September, Melanoma Institute Australia co-medical directors, Prof Georgina Long and Prof Richard Scolyer, took issue with the app for its popular #sunburnchallenge hashtag.\nEmissions target falling short | Australia is on track for a 40% reduction in emissions by 2030, short of the 43% target set by the Albanese government. The climate change minister, Chris Bowen, said the projection is still an improvement on the Morrison government, when projections \u201cwere at only 30%\u201d. \u201cThat is, we\u2019ve lifted the outlook by a third in just our first six months,\u201d Bowen said.\nUS railroad strike | The House of Representatives voted to approve a bill to block a railroad strike, after president Joe Biden called on Congress to intervene, warning the strike would \u201cdevastate our economy\u201d. The sticking point is a demand for sick pay, which is not provided to workers. Progressive pushback in support of worker demands resulted in a second House vote to mandate sick pay, but it\u2019s unclear whether that will pass the Senate.\n\n\n\nChina economy worries | As well as prompting social unrest, there are signs China\u2019s zero-Covid strategy is throttling the world\u2019s second largest economy. China\u2019s GDP is forecast to grow by 3.2% this year, well below the official target of 5.5%. This would make 2022 the slowest year for GDP growth in more than 40 years, excluding the Covid-affected rate in 2020. The IMF said this forecast could be cut even further.\nIranian shot dead | Mehran Samak, 27, was shot dead by security forces after honking his car horn in celebration of Iran\u2019s exit from the World Cup. Samak \u201cwas targeted directly and shot in the head by security forces \u2026 following the defeat of the national team against America\u201d, the Oslo-based group Iran Human Rights said.\n\n\n\nCollingwood Do Better | It\u2019s been two years since an expert review found systemic racism at the AFL club.

                    "body": "Gareth Bale said reaching the World Cup with Wales represents the \u201cfinal piece of the jigsaw\u201d after they edged out Ukraine to qualify for the competition finals for the first time since 1958.\nThe Wales manager, Robert Page, who reserved special praise for the \u201cworld-class\u201d performance of his goalkeeper, Wayne Hennessey, said he is looking forward to a mouthwatering Group B match-up against England in Qatar and dedicated victory to the late Gary Speed. Page said the jubilant scenes in the dressing room after the game were incredible and he praised the spirit of his squad.\n\n\u201cGary Speed started this, 12 or 13 years ago,\u201d Page said. \u201cI want to dedicate that to Gary as well. He started the culture. There was a difference, there was a change in the environment. I\u2019ve inherited that. Chris Coleman took it on to another level. We\u2019re just confident going into games now. We don\u2019t hope to qualify for the Euros or a World Cup now, we believe we can do it, so there has been a massive change in the mentality.\u201d\nOf Hennessey, Page said: \u201cI thought he was magnificent, world class, absolutely. I pulled Wardy [Danny Ward] in and showed him that respect to tell him I was starting Wayne. It was purely down to the fact that he played in the semi-final, didn\u2019t let us down and it would have been harsh to drop him. There was no way I was going to leave him out. He delivered like we know he can do. I thought he went to another level. I thought his performance was outstanding.\u201d\nPage joked that the younger players in his squad have been \u201cspoilt rotten\u201d compared with experienced members such as Bale and Aaron Ramsey after qualifying for successive major tournaments. \u201cI said a few words, how proud I was for them,\u201d Page said. \u201cI said that the young players have been spoilt rotten by qualifying for a Euros and a World Cup consecutively. The senior guys have had to wait a long time for that. It shows the path we are on.\u201d\n\nRamsey said it was incredible that \u201clittle old Wales\u201d would play at a World Cup finals tournament. Bale, whose first-half free-kick was diverted past the Ukraine goalkeeper Georgiy Bushchan by the Ukraine captain, Andriy Yarmolenko, basked in victory. \n\u201cIt\u2019s what we\u2019ve been working all our careers for and to do this for the fans, the nation, ourselves and our families is an incredible achievement, and it will be something that we will be forever proud of,\u201d Bale said. \n\u201cIt means everything. It is the last piece of the jigsaw that we all wanted and we\u2019re going to celebrate well tonight.\u201d\n\nOleksandr Zinchenko said he and his teammates must continue to fight on behalf of their country. In their dressing room Ukraine displayed a flag given to them by soldiers defending attacks from Russia. \u201cEveryone needs to continue to fight, as footballers we need to represent our country as best we can,\u201d the Manchester City midfielder said. \n\u201cEveryone needs to live in peace and we need to stop the war altogether. Today it\u2019s Ukraine, but who knows tomorrow, we need to stay together. I feel sorry for our fans, but I wish Wales all the best for the World Cup.\u201d\nUkraine\u2019s crestfallen head coach, Oleksandr Petrakov, picked his words carefully and was applauded before leaving the press conference room. Asked what would be his message to ensure Ukraine is not forgotten, he replied: \u201cWe have war raging all over the country, we have children and women dying on a daily basis and our infrastructure [is] being ruined by Russian barbarians. The Russians want to hurt us and the Ukrainians are resisting and defending their land. \n\u201cWe just want your support. We just want you to understand what is happening back at home.\u201d\n\nPetrakov said he could not criticise any of his players and hopes Ukrainians remember the efforts of his team, which will be completely different for their Nations League match against the Republic of Ireland in Dublin on Wednesday. \n\u201cI think we did everything we could but I really want the people in Ukraine to remember our team, our efforts,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to say sorry that we didn\u2019t score but this is sport and this is how it happens. I do not know what to say.\u201d"

                    "body": "  4.04pm   Closing post  Time to wrap up, after a busy day in which the UK economy showed a little more strength than expected. A shame we can\u2019t have the World Cup every month. Here are today\u2019s stories, first on the November GDP report:           Goodnight, and have a lovely weekend. Back next week, when it\u2019s the World Economic Forum in Davos\u2026 GW     4.01pm    It\u2019s been a busy week for retail news, with a flurry of updates from major shopping chains and supermarket giants.  Several did better than expected, despite the squeeze on incomes, while online specialists suffered from postal strikes and shortages of van drivers My colleague Sarah Butler has looked at the things we\u2019ve learned, here.      3.51pm   JP Morgan investment bankers suffer 30% bonus cut as takeover deals slump  As well as predicting a \u2018mild recession\u2019, JP Morgan has also slashed bonuses for investment bankers by 30% after a slump in takeover deals. Wall Street\u2019s largest lender reported a 22% drop in full-year profits to $38bn (\u00a331bn) on Friday, having suffered the ripple effects of the economic slowdown linked to the war in Ukraine, my colleague Kalyeena Makortoff writes. Some of its largest losses for 2022 were recorded in its investment bank, with a 58% drop in fees from dealmaking in the fourth quarter alone, contributing to a 29% decline in the division\u2019s annual profits to $15bn. JP Morgan\u2019s chair and chief executive, Jamie Dimon, said investment banking fees were \u201cdown significantly in a challenging environment\u201d. More here.      3.19pm    The UK recession is delayed, not cancelled, fears Paul Dales of Capital Economics. Following the better-than-expected 0.1% growth in November, Dales says:  It\u2019s starting to feel like a recession will never happen, but it will. Admittedly, the government may be absorbing more of the hit to national income from the surge in the cost of energy imports than we expected. The total reduction in national income may be smaller than we previously thought too. But we know that the surge in inflation and rise in interest rates will eventually hurt households and businesses. As such, we still think there will be a recession. It\u2019s just starting later than we thought and may be a bit smaller.   Updated at 3.44pm GMT    2.37pm   Wall Street opens lower, after FTSE 100 touched four-year high  In the markets, the UK FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares touched its highest level since May 2018 this morning. The FTSE 100 traded as high as 7847, nearing the record high of 7,903 set on 22nd May 2018, led by healthcare, financials, industrials and basic materials stocks. Hopes that the global inflation shock has peaked have lifted global markets this week. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says:  \u201cA decent showing on Wall Street following news that US consumer prices dropped in December helped to lift investor sentiment in Asia and Europe on Friday. Investors are desperate for inflation to ease back so that central banks no longer have a reason to keep putting up interest rates   Smashing through the alltime high would give overseas investors another reason to start looking more seriously at UK stocks, Mould explains:  \u201cAfter the Brexit vote, UK stocks were off the menu for many international investors and valuations plummeted. This remained the case for some time until some canny players realised the opportunities to be had, leading to a wave of takeovers \u2013 decent businesses picked up on the cheap.  Wall Street isn\u2019t making such a decent showing today, alas, after JP Morgan said it now expects a mild recession. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has just fallen by 250 points, or 0.7%, at the open to 33939 points, with the broader S&amp;P 500 share index down 0.77%.      1.22pm   JP Morgan says mild recession is now \u2018central case\u2019  Wall Street bank JP Morgan has revealed that a \u2018mild recession\u2019 is now the central case in its macroeconomic outlook. Announcing its latest financial results, JP Morgan says it has set aside another $1.4bn to cover credit losses. It says:  The net reserve build in the current quarter included $1.0 billion in Consumer and $343 million in Wholesale, driven by a modest deterioration in the Firm\u2019s macroeconomic outlook, now reflecting a mild recession in the central case.   CEO Jamie Dimon said the US economy currently remains strong with consumers still spending excess cash and businesses healthy.  But he warned that the economy faces headwinds, including from inflation and the Ukraine war:  However, we still do not know the ultimate effect of the headwinds coming from geopolitical tensions including the war in Ukraine, the vulnerable state of energy and food supplies, persistent inflation that is eroding purchasing power and has pushed interest rates higher, and the unprecedented quantitative tightening. We remain vigilant and are prepared for whatever happens, so we can serve our customers, clients and communities around the world across a broad range of economic environments      12.53pm    The UK economy is still under \u201cimmense strain\u201d, despite the pick-up in growth in November, says Craig Erlam, senior market analyst for UK &amp; EMEA at trading firm OANDA. He fears the recession is only \u2018delayed\u2019 by the pick-up in activity in November.  The optimists may put to some of the recent data as an indication of some resilience in the economy but I\u2019m not convinced. Take the UK, for example. It may not be in a technical recession afterall, with spending around the World Cup enabling a better performance in November, delivering growth of 0.1% after a 0.5% gain in October. Aside from the fact that December could be worse as a result, or some of those gains could be revised out, those numbers don\u2019t change the reality of the cost-of-living crisis and if accurate, it more likely reflects shifted spending patterns as opposed to a more willing consumer. A recession may be delayed but the economy is still under immense strain.      12.11pm    The Apple chief executive, Tim Cook, is expected to have his pay cut by almost 50% this year to about $49m (\u00a340m) after the billionaire boss asked the company to \u201cadjust his compensation\u201d in the light of feedback from shareholders disappointed at the fall in the company\u2019s share price. Cook, 62, who became CEO after the death of the co-founder Steve Jobs in 2011, was paid $99.4m in 2022 and $98.8m in 2021. But the company said in a regulatory filing late on Thursday night that it had set a \u201ctarget compensation\u201d of $49m for 2023. \u201cThe compensation committee balanced shareholder feedback, Apple\u2019s exceptional performance, and a recommendation from Mr Cook to adjust his compensation in light of the feedback received,\u201d Apple said in the filing. Cook\u2019s annual base salary and bonus will remain unchanged at $3m and $6m respectively. But the \u201ctargeted\u201d amount he will be given in share-based bonuses will fall from $75m last year to $40m this coming year. The amount given in share bonuses will also be more dependent on Apple\u2019s share price performance than it was last year. Now 75% of the share bonus is dependent on Apple\u2019s stock market performance, up from 50% last year. Apple\u2019s shares have fallen by 23% over the past 12 months to $133.41 at the close on Thursday, raising concerns among some shareholders. More here.      11.37am    In another encouraging economic sign this morning, Eurozone industrial production rose more than expected in November. Industrial production jumped by 1.0% in the euro area, statistics body Eurostat reports, which is twice as fast as economists predicted.  With Germany possibly avoiding a recession this winter (see earlier post), this could indicate Europe\u2019s economy ended 2022 a little stronger than feared. Separate data this morning shows that the eurozone\u2019s trade deficit in goods narrowed month-on-month in November, as energy prices fell.  Ken Wattret, head of European analysis and insights at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, says it\u2019s now a close call whether the eurozone can avoid recession.   Activity data, surveys and nowcasts all suggest it\u2019s a close call. However, whether GDP is slightly up or slightly down is not so important.  The key point, thankfully, is that the risk of a severe recession, and its numerous knock-on effects, has markedly diminished.      10.51am    Today\u2019s UK GDP figures once again underline the importance of hospitality in driving economic growth and recovery, says UKHospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls. Nicholls adds:  \u201cThe World Cup provided a significant boost in November, with pubs and bars reporting sales up 30-40% on matchdays. This once again shows the power of big sporting events, even in the winter, and the important role our venues play in bringing communities together.  \u201cHowever, the figures also highlight the impact strike action had on the sector and the cost of lost sales is likely to be set out more starkly in next month\u2019s figures.       10.39am   ING: Warnings over Britain\u2019s \u2018long\u2019 and \u2018deep\u2019 recession are exaggerated  The UK outlook \u201cundoubtedly looks bad\u201d, but ING\u2019s developed markets economist James Smith cautions against \u201coverdoing the pessimism\u201d. Smith predicts that the economy may be flat in the last quarter of 2022 \u2013 avoiding a technical recession. But, he forecasts a decline in growth in the first quarter of 2023, with a \u2018mild recession\u2019 likely. Smith writes:  Growth of 0.1% in November means that overall fourth-quarter GDP will most likely come in flat, though this says more about distortions and extra Bank Holidays than economic outperformance. First-quarter data is likely to show a more meaningful decline in output. \u201cPredicting the depth of any recession is difficult \u2013 not least because so-called \u2018non-linearities\u2019 tend to kick in when past excesses are exposed or job cuts begin to spread across industries. But for now, we agree with those looking for a mild recession by historical standards.  \u201cWe\u2019re looking for a peak-to-trough fall in GDP of a little more than 1.5%, which would match closest with the early 1990s recession in terms of scale, if not the surrounding circumstances. And despite the UK\u2019s many woes, particularly in the jobs market, we aren\u2019t convinced Britain will be a serious outlier from the rest of Europe on the hit to GDP this year, even if it probably does sit in the bottom half of the pack. \u201cOur forecasts show the UK is likely to be towards the bottom of the pack this year when it comes to growth, for many of the reasons discussed here. But we\u2019d emphasise that it doesn\u2019t look like an extreme outlier either. Our growth projections for later in 2023 \u2013 measured by 3Q23/3Q22 year-on-year growth \u2013 show Britain (-1.4%) underperforming the eurozone as a whole (-0.7%) but with a lower hit than Germany (-1.8%).\u201d       10.07am   Analysis: The UK may avoid a recession for now but it won\u2019t feel like it for many  Jeremy Hunt\u2019s response (see here) to this morning\u2019s GDP data suggests the chancellor is not getting carried away by the performance of the economy in November, and wisely so, our economics editor Larry Elliott writes:  As the Treasury pointed out, the International Monetary Fund is predicting that a third of the world economy will be in recession this year and the UK could clearly be one of the countries affected. Even if the economy has so far avoided recession \u2013 and that remains touch and go \u2013 it doesn\u2019t mean it will necessarily continue to do so in the face of rising interest rates and higher taxes over the coming months. There is also the little matter of the brutal squeeze on living standards caused by wages rising less quickly than prices. The Resolution Foundation thinktank says typical household disposable incomes are on course to drop by 7% \u2013 or \u00a32,100 \u2013 this year. So even if the economy is not actually in recession, for many people it will still feel like it.  Here\u2019s Larry\u2019s analysis:   Updated at 10.14am GMT    10.02am   UK's top economic adviser, Clare Lombardelli, to join OECD  The UK government\u2019s most senior economic adviser has been hired by the OECD as its chief economist, in the first time a British person has held the role for 30 years.  Clare Lombardelli, the chief economic adviser to the Treasury, will take the position at the Paris-based club of wealthy nations after the Spring budget. Representing 38 of the world\u2019s leading economies, the OECD acts as a powerful forum for developing economic policy and setting international standards, including efforts to combat tax evasion and agreeing a global minimum corporation tax.  Lombardelli will lead the OECD\u2019s economic work, replacing France\u2019s Laurence Boone, who left the organisation last summer to join Emmanuel Macron\u2019s government as Europe minister after four years in the role. Her appointment comes as many of the world\u2019s leading economies slump into recession amid sky-high inflation fuelled by Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and the fallout from the Covid pandemic, including in Britain. Taking the role will come with delicate subjects for the outgoing top civil servant to handle, with the OECD among leading international bodies to highlight the self-inflicted economic damage of Brexit and Britain\u2019s lacklustre growth performance on the world stage in recent months.  She also departs the Treasury after a period of intense political pressure, as a focal point for criticism of under Liz Truss\u2019 brief premiership, before the disaster of the mini budget.   The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said Lombardelli was an \u201cexceptional civil servant\u201d who provided clear and level-headed advice.  Hunt said:  \u201cI congratulate Clare on her well-deserved appointment. It\u2019s great to have a Brit in the role and look forward to working with her in the future.\u201d  A former Bank of England economist, Lombardelli has worked in government since 2005, including as principal private secretary to the chancellor, to the prime minister, and budget director. She has also worked as a technical adviser to the International Monetary Fund.       9.48am    Strike action will have hit UK GDP in December, points out Sam Miley, senior economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research.  Miley also flags that manufacturing contracted (by 0.5%) in November, while construction stalled.  \u201cThe UK economy unexpectedly grew in November, driven by an expansion in the services sector. Beneath the headline growth, there remains evidence of various headwinds impacting the economy, with a sharp monthly decline in manufacturing output being accompanied by a flatlining construction sector. Despite monthly growth in both October and November, a quarterly contraction in Q4 is still a possibility. In addition to continuing consumer and business pressures, the wave of industrial action witnessed at the end of 2022 will also have a downward effect on December\u2019s GDP figures.\u201d        9.44am    NIESR, the economic thinktank, predict the UK economy shrank slightly in December, but not by enough to pull the economy into a recession.         9.18am    We also have new economic data from Germany, showing that Europe\u2019s largest economy probably stalled in the last quarter of 2022. The German economy likely stagnated in the final quarter of last year and grew by 1.9% over the full-year 2022, the Federal Statistics Office said on Friday.  That suggest Europe\u2019s largest economy may just escape a recession over the winter, despite the economic pain from higher energy prices.  The 1.9% rise in Germany\u2019s GDP in 2022 is slightly above forecasts \u2013 a Reuters poll of economists predicted 1.8% growth last year.      9.11am   FTSE 100 highest since May 2018 with record high in sight  In the City, the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 share index has hit its highest level since May 2018. The blue-chip share index has hit 7847 points, up 0.7% this morning, approaching the alltime intraday record high of 7903 set on 22 May 2018. Industrial technology firm Rolls-Royce are the top riser, up 2.4%. Banks and mining companies are also in the top risers, European equities are also rallying, after data yesterday showed that US inflation had cooled last month. US CPI fell to 6.5% in the year to December, down from 7.1% in November, bolstering hopes that the Federal Reserve will slow the pace of interest-rate hikes. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says markets are beneiftting from China\u2019s relaxation of Covid-19 restrictions, which may spur demand for energy and commodities.  A fresh all-time high for the index in this kind of macro environment probably reflects a bit of defensiveness among global investors, a hunt for yield, relative cheapness and a weaker pound (in dollar terms we are a long way off the all-time high), a belief the Fed is almost done with rate hikes as inflation peaks, and hopes that China\u2019s reopening will drive the commodity and energy sectors.  Investors have also trimmed their forecasts for how high UK interest rates will rise this year. They are now seen peaking below 4.5%, up from 3.5% at present. A lower peak would support economic growth. So far this year, the FTSE 100 has already gained over 5%. In 2022 it gained almost 1%, while global markets tumbled around 20%.      8.44am   UK \"likely to have avoided a 2022 recession\"  The UK is likely to have avoided a 2022 recession thanks to the \u201csurprise economic growth\u201d of 0.1% in November, says the Resolution Foundation. But they also warn that \u201cthe risk of recession still looms large\u201d as the Bank of England and the Office for Budget Responsibility both forecast the economy will shrink in the first half of 2023.  Resolution also points out that family incomes are still shrinking, with typical household disposable incomes on track to fall by 7% \u2013 equivalent to \u00a32,100 per household \u2013 over this financial year and the next one. James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation, explains:  \u201cSurprise economic growth in November \u2013 driven by the UK\u2019s dominant services sector \u2013 means Britain has likely avoided a rapid return to recession in 2022. \u201cBut while GDP may not have been shrinking, household incomes certainly were \u2013 and are \u2013 as families experience a deep living standards downturn.\u201d       Updated at 8.44am GMT    8.34am   Full story: UK economy grew by only 0.1% in November  The UK economy grew by 0.1% in November as consumers headed to the shops in the run-up to Christmas and pubs and bars enjoyed a boost from the World Cup. It was a slowdown compared with 0.5% growth in October, when the economy rebounded from a weak September, when many businesses closed for the Queen\u2019s funeral. It was, however, better than forecasts, with City economists predicting the economy would shrink by 0.2 % in November. The onset of a recession in the manufacturing sector limited the strength of the economy and meant that over the three months to November the economy contracted by 0.3%, according to the Office for National Statistics. The ONS said mining and construction also offset the effect of the decline in manufacturing. The Bank of England has warned that the UK is probably set for a long recession, as defined by two consecutive quarters of contraction. The economy shrank by 0.3% in the third quarter between July and September, and figures for the October to December period will be published next month, confirming whether or not the economy entered recession at that point.      8.32am    Thomas Pugh, economist at audit, tax and consulting firm RSM UK, says the UK\u2019s recession has been delayed, not cancelled. And he points out that a 0.1% rise in GDP doesn\u2019t feel much different than a fall of 0.1%:  \u2018The surprise 0.1% m/m rise in GDP in November (consensus -0.3% m/m) means there is now a chance that overall growth in Q4 might be positive if GDP falls by less than 0.4% m/m in December. That would mean the official definition of a recession of two consecutive quarters of negative growth might not be met until Q2 of this year. \u2018Of course, that doesn\u2019t change much on the ground. For businesses operating in the real economy a rise in GDP of 0.1% doesn\u2019t feel much different to a drop in GDP of 0.1%. But a milder recession would mean that unemployment rises more slowly, wage growth stays strong and domestically generated inflation falls more slowly than expected. This could result in the Bank of England (BoE) raising rates by more than expected.       8.14am    Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is concerned that growth was \u2018on the floor\u2019 in the three months to November, with GDP falling by 0.3% during the period.  That contraction was partly caused by the bank holiday in September for Queen Elizabeth\u2019s state funeral. GDP fell by 0.8% in September.  Updated at 8.26am GMT    8.03am    Kitty Ussher, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, thinks the Bank of England could be spurred to raise interest rates again next month by the surprise growth in November. Ussher says:  \u201cThis is stronger activity than was expected for November and so will further contribute to the improvement in market sentiment we have seen in the last few weeks. Given we know the economy also grew in October \u2013 albeit driven by a rebound from the period of state mourning \u2013 it is no longer certain that the economy will meet the technical definition of a recession when the final data for 2022 is in. \u201cToday\u2019s better-than-expected data will be encouraging for businesses, but may also cause a cautious Bank of England to continue raising rates unnecessarily when they meet in early February. The risk now is that rates will rise too far if inflation is already on a downward path due to changes in global energy prices.\u201d   Updated at 8.03am GMT    7.59am    A drop in Covid-19 vaccinations weighed on UK economic growth in November. The ONS reports that NHS Test and Trace and COVID-19 vaccination programme activity fell by 63% in November 2022, following increases in September and October. This was driven by a fall in vaccine activity as the autumn booster programme slowed down. It began in early September. Overall, NHS Test and Trace and the COVID-19 vaccination programme contributed an estimated negative 0.2 percentage points to monthly GDP growth, the ONS explains.     7.51am    Economist Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at financial services giant Allianz, tweets there are three key messages from the UK GDP report. Namely, growth was higher than expected; the services sector is driving it; and the jobs market looks relatively tight:      7.45am    The surprising rise in GDP in November suggests that the economy is proving more resilient than many had feared, says Suren Thiru, economics director at ICAEW (the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales): But, Thiru fears November\u2019s growth will only delay the recession, saying:  A strong boost to consumer activity from the World Cup helped lift overall activity. The positive November outturn delays rather than diminishes the prospect of recession with soaring inflation, higher unemployment, rising interest rates and taxes likely to suffocate activity for much of this year.\u201d      7.38am   Capital Economics: GDP resilient, but still set for contraction in Q1 2023  Capital Economics\u2019 senior UK economist, Ruth Gregory, says the UK may avoid a recession in 2022, thanks to the \u201cundeniably encouraging\u201d news that the economy grew slightly in November. The small 0.1% month-on-month gain in real GDP in November suggests the economy \u201cwas not as weak in Q4 as we had previously thought\u201d, Gregory says. But 2023 will still be tough, she adds:  But even if the economy does a bit better than expected in Q4, it is at best stagnating. And it is too soon to conclude the economy will be able to get through this period of high interest rates and high inflation largely unscathed. We still think a recession is on its way in the first half of 2023.   Updated at 7.43am GMT    7.34am    Does the unexpected growth in November mean the UK could have avoided falling into recession at the end of last year? It all depends on how the economy fared in December. ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan has told Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that if GDP falls by 0.6% or more in December, that would mean the economy contracted in the fourth quarter of 2022. That would be the second quarterly contraction in a row \u2013 a technical recession. Morgan says:  If all else is equal, so no revisions to earlier months, for quarter four to be negative the economy has to fall by at least 0.6% [in December].  The ONS will release GDP data for December, and for the fourth-quarter of 2022, on February 10th, Morgan adds.     7.22am   ONS: The economy grew a little in November, but strikes hit economy  Growth at telecommunications and computer programming companies helped the UK economy to expand, just 0.1%, in November, says ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan. Pubs and bars also did well as people went out to watch World Cup games, he explains, with England and Wales both playing in Qatar. But this was \u201cpartially offset\u201d by further falls in some manufacturing industries, including the pharmaceutical industry (where output can be erratic). Strikes also hit the transport and postal sectors, Morgan says, adding:  \u201cOver the last three months, however, the economy still shrank \u2013 mainly due to the impact of the extra bank holiday for the funeral of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth in September.\u201d         7.15am   Hunt: Bringing down inflation will get economy growing  Jeremy Hunt, Chancellor of the Exchequer, says:  \u201cWe have a clear plan to halve inflation this year - an insidious hidden tax which has led to hikes in interest rates and mortgage costs, holding back growth here and around the world. \u201cTo support families through this tough patch, we will provide an average of \u00a33,500 support for every household over this year and next - but the most important help we can give is to stick to the plan to halve inflation this year so we get the economy growing again.\u201d      7.13am         7.09am   UK GDP: the details  The UK\u2019s services sector grew by 0.2% during November, with the men\u2019s World Cup in Qatar providing a boost to pubs and bars, as supporters gathered to watch games. But manufacturing continued to struggle, with its output falling by 0.5%. The construction sector stagnated.  Here\u2019s the details of how the UK economy performed in November, from the Office for National Statistics:  The services sector grew by 0.2% in November 2022, after growth of 0.7% (revised up from a growth 0.6% in our previous publication) in October 2022; the largest contributions came from administrative and support service activities and information and communication. Output in consumer-facing services grew by 0.4% in November 2022, following growth of 1.5% (revised up from a growth of 1.2% in our previous publication) in October 2022; the largest contribution to growth came from food and beverage service activities in a month where the FIFA World Cup started. Production output decreased by 0.2% in November 2022, after a fall of 0.1% (revised down from flat in our previous publication) in October 2022; manufacturing was the main driver of negative production growth in November 2022, partially offset by a positive contribution from mining and quarrying. The construction sector was flat in November 2022 after growth of 0.4% (revised down from growth of 0.8% in our previous publication) in October 2022.   Updated at 7.11am GMT    7.05am    Monthly GDP is now estimated to be 0.3% below its pre-Covid-19 levels in February 2020, the ONS says.     7.02am   GDP: UK economy grew by 0.1% in November  Breaking: the UK economy grew slightly in November, better than City economists expected [they had forecast a 0.2% contraction]. The Office for National Statistics reports that UK GDP rose by 0.1% in November, a slowdown on the 0.5% growth recorded in October. But \u201clooking at the broader picture\u201d, the ONS adds, GDP fell by 0.3% in the three months to November 2022.  Updated at 7.29am GMT    6.49am    Here\u2019s Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, on the UK GDP data due in around 10 minutes\u2026  This morning we get the latest November GDP numbers for the UK economy, which are expected to point to the UK economy already being in a modest recession. With the economy contracting in Q3, it is quite likely we might see a further contraction in Q4. Monthly GDP in October rose by 0.5%, although on a rolling 3-month basis the economy contracted by -0.3%. This rolling 3-month figure isn\u2019t expected to change in this morning\u2019s November numbers with another figure of -0.3%, while the monthly number is expected to decline by -0.2%. All sectors of the economy are forecast to show a contraction in November, manufacturing and industrial production are expected to slow by -0.2%, construction output by -0.3% and index of services of -0.1%. This is perhaps why the pound has underperformed in recent days, in that markets feel the Bank of England doesn\u2019t have as much scope to raise rates given how fragile the UK economy appears to be, with both the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank considered to have more headroom.   Updated at 6.50am GMT    6.39am   Introduction: UK's November GDP report coming up  Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. We\u2019re about to learn how well, or badly, the UK economy fared in November, as the recession looms. The Office for National Statistics is due to release its GDP monthly estimate for November at 7am. Economists predict the UK economy shrank by around 0.2% in November, after better-than-expected growth of 0.5% in October.  A fall in GDP in November wouldn\u2019t officially put the UK into a technical recession \u2013 defined as shrinking for two consecutive quarters \u2013 but it could signal that one is close. UK GDP did fall in the third quarter of 2022, by 0.3%, so a contraction in the October-December quarter would mean a recession (we\u2019ll get Q4 data in a month\u2019s time). Soaring energy prices have hit the economy, weakening consumer spending as the cost of living crisis left consumers with less to spend. Alvin Tan of RBC Capital Markets told clients:  We expect that GDP contracted again in November. Retail sales have provided a good guide to the pattern of activity of late, and they fell by 0.4% m/m in November.   Analysts at investment bank Nomura also predicted a month-on-month contraction in November, saying:  \u201cWe think that GDP is due a fall bearing in mind the weaker surveys and higher inflation, and as such forecast a 0.3 per cent m-o-m drop in November.\u201d  UK housebuilders have warned this week that demand slowed last autumn, as the turmoil following the mini-budget.

                    "body": "Evangelical Christianity is quietly flourishing among migrant groups in the Gulf as churches provide low-paid workers facing horrific abuse with aid in times of crisis, according to pastors and parishioners across the region. About 30 million migrant workers live in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states \u2013 Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates \u2013 the muscle transforming oil-based economies into glittering 21st-century metropolises. In some Gulf states, migrants make up most of the population, and about 80% are employed in construction, hospitality and domestic jobs. The Guardian has interviewed pastors and parishioners of churches in all six Gulf countries and found that migrants, including those from Hindu and Catholic communities, are converting to Pentecostalism, one of the fastest-growing religions on Earth with more than 600 million followers. To cope materially and spiritually, many attend Pentecostal churches because they focus on people\u2019s needs in the here and now \u2013 namely health and wealth \u2013 as well as the ever after. Pastor John, who like everyone spoken to for this article asked to use a pseudonym as Gulf governments are suspicious of Christian movements and proselytising is often illegal, said his church was helping migrants who faced exploitation, financial hardship, domestic servitude and sexual abuse. \u201cRape is a very, very common problem across the entire domestic help industry,\u201d the pastor said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just females \u2013 males come to us because they get raped as well.\u201d Pentecostal churches tend to bring in people from ethnic and national groups whose governments are reluctant to take up cases of human rights violations with wealthy Gulf states for fear they will damage generous aid and trade packages. Instead, spirit-led churches like this have become de facto unions for migrant workers, often acting as their first point of call in a crisis. \u201cIf you go to the embassy, they will talk to your employer and get the local police involved,\u201d the pastor said. \u201cThat\u2019s a very intimidating situation for your normal person. In my experience, most of the brethren that face those challenges are labourers and they are very, very vulnerable to abuse.\u201d In cases of rape, the pastor said, the person would contact the church first, which would then coordinate with the embassy to arrange a way to escape. \u201cThey have this special rescue team that communicates to get out of the building at a certain time and the car would be waiting for her,\u201d the pastor said. \u201cObviously, in order for her to be able to trust this process, it needs to be arranged through someone who she actually knows \u2013 usually, that\u2019s a church.\u201d Due to secrecy around conversion in the Gulf, the exact number of Christians in the region is not possible to ascertain, but church leaders and researchers agree there are significant numbers of migrant workers converting in Gulf countries. While they are expressly forbidden from proselytising to Muslims, it is understood that some Islamic workers choose to be \u201cborn again\u201d. In Qatar, home to 2.1 million migrant workers who make up about 75% of the population, Google Maps lists scores of Pentecostal churches. Yet, as with other Gulf nations, many churches choose to remain as underground \u201chouse\u201d churches for fear that conditions may change. At one such house church, which tells only trusted people its location via a WhatsApp dropped pin and a compound door left slightly ajar, the sisterhood is working overtime. On a hot Friday morning, a women\u2019s apostle network explained how they had tried to look after rape victims. \u201cIf an unmarried woman shows up [pregnant] in hospital, they will look for her marriage contract. If she can\u2019t show anything, she is reported to the police and put in jail \u2013 and they\u2019ll take her children,\u201d said one of the group\u2019s leaders, who asked to be called Sister Mary. \u201cLet\u2019s just say that some churches have helped to hide the kids from the police. The pastor\u2019s wife will look after them and she will try to get out while her tummy is still small. But you can\u2019t hide kids for long.\u201d  For some, converting to this fundamentalist form of Christianity marks their arrival as a global citizen and causes them to turn on their past. Pastor Luke, who has been working in one of the less strict Gulf states since 1991, is focused on converting people from Hinduism. \u201cIn our church, we\u2019re seeing several people taking water baptisms each month and definitely more people are coming here than ever,\u201d he said. Referring to adherents of his former faith as \u201cidol worshippers\u201d, he said people who converted tended to get their lives together \u2013 they settled down and got married, had children, and got promotions at work. \u201cPeople come from India and Pakistan to increase the status of their family, but they arrive at the labour camps and they\u2019re so crowded, and there\u2019s so much drinking and smoking,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one tells them that when they get here they often find more problems than they left behind.\u201d"

Thanks for all your company and emails, not just tonight but throughout the last however many days of non-stop football it\u2019s been. Enjoy the time off; see you on Friday for Croatia v Brazil. Goodnight!      9.12pm   The quarter-final line-up  Friday  Croatia v Brazil (3pm GMT) Netherlands v Argentina (7pm)  Saturday  Morocco v Portugal (3pm) England v France (7pm)      9.12pm    When you consider the context, I think Ramos\u2019s hat-trick is the best \u2013 or at least the most notable \u2013 at a World Cup since Paolo Rossi\u2019s against Brazil in 1982. That might be recency bias, but I\u2019m not sure any of the subsequent hat-tricks \u2013 not even Gary Lineker in 1986 \u2013 match it for sheer goshdarn narrative. One thing is undeniable: it\u2019s the first in a World Cup knockout game since Tomas Skuhravy\u2019s hat-trick of headers against Costa Rica in 1990.     9.08pm    \u201cTwo days without World Cup football?\u201d weeps K\u00e1ri Tulinius. \u201cHow will we cope?\u201d Well, if you\u2019re in the UK, ITVX has about 30 World Cup classics, in full, with the original frigging commentary.      9.02pm    At 21, Goncalo Ramos is the youngest player to score a World Cup hat-trick since Florian Albert in 1962.     8.56pm   Full time: Portugal 6-1 Switzerland  No CR7, but six goals for a stylish, swaggering Portugal. They played some exhilarating football, maybe the best we\u2019ve seen in this tournament, and Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s replacement Goncalo Ramos scored a fairytale hat-trick in his first full game for his country. The other goals, all crackers in their own way, came from Pepe, Raphael Guerreiro and Rafael Leao. Switzerland are a decent side, but they were taken apart. Portugal will now play Morocco, with France or England waiting in the semi-final if they get through. On that form, they could win the whole thing.   Updated at 9.02pm GMT    8.52pm    The substitute Rafael Leao scores a beauty. He played a neat one-two with Guerreiro, cut inside on the left edge of the box and whipped a curling shot around the flat-footed Sommer. Lovely goal.     8.51pm   GOAL! Portugal 6-1 Switzerland (Leao 90+2)  Goodnight.   Updated at 8.56pm GMT    8.50pm    90+1 min There will be four added minutes.     8.49pm    89 min Ardon Jashari replaces Breel Embolo, who has probably been Switzerland\u2019s best player at this World Cup.  Updated at 8.49pm GMT    8.48pm    89 min \u201cIt\u2019s silly to belittle Ronaldo\u2019s career as he clearly is one of the all time greats,\u201d says Espen Bommen, \u201cbut it\u2019s interesting that Portugal\u2019s biggest success, the Euro win, and their best game, because I think today qualifies as that, has come without him on the pitch.\u201d I\u2019d say that\u2019s just coincidence, as he got them to the final of Euro 2016. This is different though \u2013 the team just looks better without him. He could still have an impact on this tournament from the bench, though, a 124th-minute winner against England in the semi-finals maybe.  Updated at 8.49pm GMT    8.47pm    87 min Rafael Leao replaces Bruno Fernandes.     8.45pm    85 min \u201cActually I would not mind if Portugal met Argentina in the final,\u201d says Jo\u00e3o Melo, \u201cand Messi and Ronaldo got involved in a fight during the game and were both red carded simultaneously for it.\u201d And then walked down the tunnel, arm in arm, off into the new Saudi Arabian tourism advert sunset.      8.44pm    84 min: Ronaldo has a goal disallowed! To be fair, he knew he was offside. He took it well, rattling a left-footed shot past Sommer, but he was about four yards offside when the ball was played through.   Updated at 8.53pm GMT    8.42pm    83 min \u201cWhy keep slagging on CR?\u201d says John Steppling. \u201cGreat story with Ramos, but Ronaldo has been a superb player for a decade. Of course people cheer and they should. Doesn\u2019t make them idiots. Makes you an idiot.\u201d I was talking about the circus generally \u2013 to which I\u2019ve also contributed \u2013 not Ronaldo. But I appreciate the pep talk and self-esteem boost.     8.40pm    81 min: Portugal substitution Bernardo Silva, quietly classy throughout, is replaced by Ruben Neves.     8.40pm    81 min Embolo\u2019s extravagant scissor kick from the edge of the area goes a few yards wide. It hit Dalot\u2019s noggin en route, though I don\u2019t think it was on target. Shaqiri\u2019s corner is headed over at the near post by Xhaka. That was a chance.     8.39pm    79 min It\u2019s petering out now. The main point of interest, rightly or wrongly, is whether Cristiano Ronaldo can join Lionel Messi in scoring his first goal in a World Cup knockout tie.     8.36pm    76 min And pings the free-kick straight into the wall. He caught it sweetly, and there was a dull thud as it hit some poor sod in the wall.     8.35pm    76 min Bernardo Silva is fouled 25 yards from goal. Ronaldo marks out his run\u2026     8.35pm    75 min There are loud cheers every time Ronaldo gets within five yards of the ball. It\u2019s actually a bit weird, like a Bros concert in 1988.     8.33pm    74 min: Triple change for Portugal Cristiano Ronaldo, Vitinha and Ricardo Horta replace Joao Felix, Goncalo Ramos, Otavio. There are wild cheers as he runs onto the field, much wilder than at any stage of the actual game, DURING WHICH A YOUNG MAN SCORED ONE OF THE GREAT WORLD CUP HAT-TRICKS YOU EEJITS.   Updated at 8.44pm GMT    8.32pm    73 min \u201cSiri: show me how a really storied career can end really badly,\u201d says Paul Cockburn. It\u2019s not over yet. Wait till he scores the winner against Argentina in the final and then suplexes Messi.  Updated at 8.32pm GMT    8.31pm    72 min That\u2019s the first hat-trick of this World Cup. There were only two in 2018, actually: Harry Kane against Panama and, yep, Cristiano Ronaldo against Spain.     8.29pm    70 min Guerreiro\u2019s volleyed cross just evades the flying Fernandes at the far post. Portugal have played sheer, delightful football tonight.     8.29pm    68 min It\u2019s worth repeating: Goncalo Ramos is 21 years old, in place of Cristiano Ronaldo, starting his first game in international football, in place of Cristiano Ronaldo, in a World Cup knockout game, in place of Cristiano Ronaldo, for a team who haven\u2019t won a World Cup knockout game in 16 years.     8.28pm    This really is incredible. Joao Felix slipped him in with a simple pass, and Ramos dinked the ball gently over the outrushing Sommer. Who writes his scripts?     8.27pm   GOAL! Portugal 5-1 Switzerland (Ramos 67)  Goncalo Ramos completes a hat-trick that is going straight into World Cup folklore!   Updated at 8.31pm GMT    8.26pm    66 min: Switzerland substitution Noah Okafor replaces Vargas.     8.25pm    66 min Switzerland are still buzzing around in attack, hoping to give Portugal something to think about. Shaqiri shoots miles over from the right edge of the box and then looks at the pitch in disgust.     8.24pm    65 min The hypnotic chanting of \u2018Ronaldo\u2019/\u2018Baldy\u2019 continues. No sign yet that\u2019s coming on. It\u2019s slightly sad, on both sides, that Portugal are 4-1 up in a knockout game, having played some sensational stuff, and all we\u2019re talking about is a once great forward who is now past it.     8.23pm    64 min This is the full quarter-final line-up. Friday  Croatia v Brazil (3pm GMT) Netherlands v Argentina (7pm)  Saturday  Morocco v Portugal (3pm) England v France (7pm)       8.22pm    63 min \u201cPortugal playing like a box of Quality Street without the toffee,\u201d says Jim Brown. \u201cSo much better.\u201d      8.21pm    61 min I think the crowd are calling for Ronaldo. Either that or Gianni Infantino has appeared again and they\u2019re singing \u201cBaldy!\u201d  (I say this as a member of that particular community.)     8.19pm    60 min \u201cDear Rob,\u201d says Michael Meagher. You wrote \u201811 min Neither team is playing at full pelt. It\u2019s as if they know this is going to penalties and want to conserve a bit of energy.\u2019 That entry has aged well. What? Oh.\u201d We can\u2019t get it right all the time, or indeed some of it. I thought this was certain to at least go to extra-time.      8.19pm    59 min The substitute Comert is booked for an arm to the face of Bruno Fernandes.     8.18pm    Shaqiri\u2019s nasty inswinging corner flicked off the head of Ramos \u2013 another assist for him \u2013 and Akanji volleyed into an empty net at the far post.     8.17pm   GOAL! Portugal 4-1 Switzerland (Akanji 58)  Manuel Akanji scores Switzerland\u2019s first goal in a World Cup knockout game since 1954.   Updated at 8.26pm GMT    8.17pm    57 min Goncalo Ramos will get the headlines tomorrow \u2013 you\u2019re darn tootin \u2013 but Joao Felix has been delightful.      8.16pm    Never mind CR7; Portugal could score seven here. That was a beauty. Joao Felix played a give-and-go with Otavio on the halfway line, shuffled elegantly past a defender and zipped the ball into Ramos. He turned and played in the left-back Guerreiro, who rammed the ball into the roof of the net.  Updated at 8.16pm GMT    8.15pm   GOAL! Portugal 4-0 Switzerland (Guerreiro 55)  What a glorious team goal!    Updated at 8.24pm GMT    8.14pm    54 min: Double substitution for Switzerland Denis Zakaria and Haris Seferovic replace Djibril Sow and Remo Freuler.     8.13pm    54 min Fernandes\u2019s corner is headed down by Pepe and blocked by Rodriguez. I don\u2019t think it was on target.     8.13pm    53 min Joao Felix\u2019s shot takes a deflection off Akanji and goes behind for a corner. So much for this being a long night; Portugal are rampant.     8.12pm    53 min So, Portugal will play Morocco in the third quarter-final (Saturday, 3pm GMT). And the winners of that game will play France or England in the semi-final.     8.12pm    Goncalo Ramos has got his second goal, and right now he wouldn\u2019t be able to stop smiling if he tried. He\u2019s not trying. The goal was made by Dalot, who gave Vargas a taste of his own by zipping down the right and driving a cross to the near post. Ramos got in front of Comert (I think) and flicked an instinctive finish that went through Sommer and into the net.     8.10pm   GOAL! Portugal 3-0 Switzerland (Ramos 50)  This is turning into one of the great World Cup stories!    Updated at 8.15pm GMT    8.09pm    49 min An early corner down the left for Portugal. Bernardo Silva\u2019s outswinger is headed across goal and booted clear by Rodriguez. There was a huge cheer around the ground just before the corner was taken. Either Ronaldo is warming up or Gianni Infantino has appeared on the big screen.     8.08pm    48 min \u201cPerhaps Ronaldo\u2019s decline started with the loss of his son (and hospitalisation of his daughter),\u201d says Ellen Bohan, \u201cwhich he didn\u2019t have a lot of time to recover from - not that you ever fully recover from that.\u201d Good point. There have signs of physical decline too but goodness knows what that does to even somebody as mentally tough as Ronaldo. It\u2019s one of the main reasons why I\u2019m a bit uneasy with all the schadenfreude.     8.06pm    47 min Switzerland have reverted to 4-2-3-1.     8.05pm    47 min The last time Portugal won a World Cup knockout game, Jamie Carragher was a specialist penalty-taker.   Updated at 8.06pm GMT    8.05pm    46 min Peep peep!     8.05pm    Switzerland have made a half-time substitution Fabian Schar, who was unwell in the build-up to the game, is replaced by Eray Comert.     7.58pm    Fabian Schar is a really good defender. Alas, he did not defend really well for either goal.   Updated at 8.06pm GMT    7.55pm    \u201cSwitzerland must be gutted with Ronaldo\u2019s behaviour,\u201d says Brendan Large. \u201cIf he\u2019d only behaved like a grown up after being subbed in the last game, they would surely be doing better in this game.\u201d I still can\u2019t quite believe how much he has declined in the last few months.      7.52pm    Half-time reading      7.51pm    Ramos and Pepe, eh      7.50pm   Half time: Portugal 2-0 Switzerland  Whether it was a tactical move or a disciplinary measure, Fernando Santos\u2019s decision to drop Cristiano Ronaldo was entirely vindicated by a dominant, dynamic first-half performance from Portugal. Goncalo Ramos, the youngster who replaced Ronaldo, scored a thrilling first goal before Pepe, almost twice his age, made it two with an emphatic header. Switzerland, who switched to a back three, were surprisingly compliant. They\u2019ve recovered from worse positions, but they need a goal quicksmart at the start of the second half.  Updated at 7.52pm GMT    7.47pm    45+1 min There will be four minutes of added time.     7.46pm    45 min Joao Felix, who has had a marvellous first half, dribbles joyously past three players and then lends the ball to Fernandes. He tries a scooped return pass but doesn\u2019t enough on it.     7.45pm    45 min \u201cHaving spent over ten years living in Portugal, I\u2019d caution against imagining that Ronaldo is entirely adored there,\u201d says Geoff Wignall. \u201cFor sure he has plenty of fans but it\u2019s by no means universal (not that you\u2019d know it from the Portuguese media). It is after all a country and populace often characterized by a quiet modesty.  \u201cEven at the time of the Euros victory in 2016, there were many who saw his injury and substitution in the final as timely and significant for the outcome. That wasn\u2019t just hindsight either: I was watching in a local bar where the immediate reaction from some was very much along \u2018now we can be a team\u2019 lines. Just saying.\u201d      7.44pm    43 min: Chance for Portugal! Sommer makes a terrific save from Ramos! Portugal broke at speed, with the referee playing an excellent advantage when Joao Felix was taken out by Schar. Eventually Fernandes angled a classy through ball to Ramos, whose first-time shot back across goal was pushed round by Sommer. That\u2019s a fine save. Schar is booked for the foul on Joao Felix.  Updated at 7.57pm GMT    7.42pm    41 min Fernandes shoots over from 25 yards.     7.42pm    40 min A few of you have mentioned the red-on-red graphics on the liveblog page. I think it\u2019s done independently so I doubt it\u2019s something that can be changed at a stroke, but I\u2019ll mention it for future games. Sorry for the inconvenience/awfulness, especially to those of you who are colour-blind.  Updated at 7.43pm GMT    7.39pm    38 min: Good save by Costa! Switzerland almost pull one back. Fernandes hammers a cross that is pushed away unconvincingly by Costa, but he recovers well to partially block Freuler\u2019s follow-up header. Dalot completes the job by booting the loose ball clear.   Updated at 7.52pm GMT    7.37pm    36 min Switzerland are a tough, resourceful bunch \u2013 they came from 3-1 down to put France out at the last European Championship \u2013 but at the moment they are struggling. It was close until Ramos\u2019s goal; since then Portugal have been well on top.     7.36pm    35 min Cristiano Ronaldo certianly enjoyed that goal, charging down the touchline to join the huddle. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m talking about this, but, you know.     7.35pm    34 min Pepe is the second oldest goalscorer at the World Cup, behind only Albert Roger Miller.     7.34pm    Pepe, who is 40 in February, has doubled Portugal\u2019s lead. Fernandes curled a pacy, outswinging corner from the right towards the six-yard line, where Pepe got between Akanji and Schar to slam a header past Sommer.  Updated at 7.35pm GMT    7.34pm   GOAL! Portugal 2-0 Switzerland (Pepe 33)  The old man makes it two with a storming header!    Updated at 7.38pm GMT    7.33pm    32 min: Just wide from Schar! Just wide of his own goal, that is. Joao Felix curls a wicked inswinging cross towards Ramos that is headed past the far post by Schar. He had to go for it with Ramos waiting behind him to score a second.     7.31pm    30 min The resulting free-kick is over 30 yards from goal, too far out for a shot. Or not. Shaqiri whips a fantastic free-kick over the wall that is pushed round the post by the diving Diogo Costa. I don\u2019t think it was going in \u2013 it would have hit the post \u2013 but Costa was right to take no chances.  Updated at 7.32pm GMT    7.30pm    29 min Embolo rolls Ruben Dias superbly on the halfway line. Dias tries to pull him back him about four times, until eventually Embolo just stops playing and the referee gives a free-kick.     7.28pm    27 min Vargas turns Dalot really neatly on the left, but Dalot recovers excellently to win the ball. That\u2019s a decent contest.     7.25pm    25 min Fabian Schar is receiving treatment, possibly for shellshock after that goal from Ramos.     7.24pm         7.23pm    22 min Joao Felix floats a beautiful pass towards Ramos in the inside-left channel. He stumbles inside Schar and droves a low shot from 20 yards that is too close to Sommer.     7.23pm    22 min Portugal have a swagger on now. The underlapping Guerreiro plays a one-two with Bernardo Silva and crosses towards Ramos. The ball is cleared as far as Otavio, who cracks a decent shot from 25 yards that bounces straight through to Sommer.     7.21pm    20 min \u201cWhat a comedown from the Morocco kits ...\u201d says Robyn Schelenz. \u201cThis Portugal strip looks bizarre.\u201d      7.20pm    19 min The camera cuts to Ronaldo on the bench. He\u2019s impassive, hand on his chin, or should be it chin on his hand. Either way, I\u2019d pay top dollar for that internal monologue.     7.19pm    This is some story. Goncalo Ramos is 21, making his first international start, ahead of the greatest player in Portugal\u2019s history, and now he has put them in front with a belter. Nothing much looked on when Joao Felix fed the ball into him, 12 yards out with his back to goal and Schar behind him. He shifted the ball onto his left foot, which made the angle even tighter, then suddenly roasted a rising drive that beat Sommer for pace at the near post.  Updated at 7.25pm GMT    7.18pm   GOAL! Portugal 1-0 Switzerland (Ramos 17)  Goncalo Ramos blasts Portugal into the lead!    Updated at 7.27pm GMT    7.16pm    15 min Vargas tries to run Dalot, who times his lunging tackle perfectly. You\u2019d have got long odds, six months ago, that he\u2019d be keeping Joao Cancelo out of the Portugal team.     7.14pm    13 min Turns out you can\u2019t trust Switzerland. The ITV commentator Clive Tyldseley has pointed out that Ricardo Rodriguez is playing in a back three, with Edimilson Fernandes and Ruben Vargas (I think) as wing-backs. I\u2019m done with tactics, I\u2019m sick of being lied to.     7.11pm    11 min Neither team is playing at full pelt. It\u2019s as if they know this is going to penalties and want to conserve a bit of energy.     7.10pm    8 min \u201cPerhaps Ronaldo will throw his toys out of the pram,\u201d says John Peeler, \u201cand begin his dissent into irrelebance...\u201d Erm, I think you mis-spelt a couple of words there John.     7.08pm    7 min A pretty cagey start. I\u2019m still trying to work out Portugal\u2019s formation, which I\u2019ve now decided is 4-2-3-1 with Bernardo Silva as the No10. Switzerland\u2019s is definitely 4-2-3-1. You can trust those lads.  Updated at 7.09pm GMT    7.07pm    6 min \u201cGianni Infantino,\u201d begins Tony Rutt, \u201calways looks as though he would rather be watching horse jumping.\u201d   Updated at 7.15pm GMT    7.06pm    5 min Embolo collects a routine header forward on the edge of the Portugal area and makes space for a shot that hits Pepe and goes behind.     7.05pm    4 min Embolo goes down after wearing an elbow from Ruben Dias. He\u2019s not happy at all, and I can understand why \u2013 Dias was trying to shepherd the ball out but did so in a slightly overzealous manner. He might have been booked for that.   Updated at 7.10pm GMT    7.04pm    3 min Joao Felix plays a sharp pass into the area towards Bruno Fernandes, who surprisingly miscontrols it. The Portugal formation looks more like a midfield diamond, maybe even a bloody pentagon if you include Joao Felix dropping off.     7.02pm    2 min And now it\u2019s time for the obligatory cut to Gianni Infantino.     7.02pm    2 min \u201cRob, this is crazy,\u201d says Mary Waltz. \u201cItaly doesn\u2019t make it to WC, Germany, Belgium eliminated in Group. Spain drops first knockout game. The world turned upside down. And Portugal\u2019s manager has giant cojones. It\u2019s the correct decision but for a Portugal manager to sit down Portugal\u2019s patron saint is bravery personified.\u201d      7.01pm    1 min Peep peep! Switzerland kick off from left to right as I/we watch.     6.57pm    The players line up for the anthems. Inevitably the camera homes in on Ronaldo, who belts it out with plenty of gusto. I\u2019d pay a lot of money to hear his internal monologue over the next few hours.   Updated at 7.01pm GMT    6.55pm    \u201cSmart bit of management from Santos I say - it being Ronnie\u2019s last shot at World Cup glory, the manager has wagered that he can drop the player/show everyone who\u2019s boss, knowing CR has nothing to gain and everything to lose from showing any kind of descent,\u201d says Jim Crane. \u201cAlso, no bad thing to have a fired-up striker to send on with 20 to go.\u201d That\u2019s my favourite typo of the tournament so far.      6.49pm    Dead rubbers aside, the last time Cristiano Ronaldo was left out of the Portugal side at a major tournament was when they beat Russia in the group stage of Euro 2004 \u2013 that\u2019s 6,747 days ago.       6.43pm    And I think you\u2019ve got a point, Jamie      6.36pm    Here\u2019s Sid Lowe\u2019s report on Morocco\u2019s famous victory      6.32pm    \u201cRonaldo on the bench?\u201d sniffs Matt Dony. \u201cMan, Football Twitter is going to be pretty much \u201cunusable for the next few hours\u2026\u201d You mis-spelt \u2018millennia\u2019.   Updated at 6.47pm GMT    6.01pm    \u201cMore than Rashford, it is Dalot\u2019s emergence that reflects well on Erik ten Hag\u2019s coaching,\u201d says Digvijay Yadav. \u201cAs far as Ronaldo is concerned, you are right, but strangely enough this gives him a better chance to win this World Cup. He could easily come off the bench to finish off ties or score from set pieces (head not feet). Not that he\u2019d see it that way.\u201d Yeah, I\u2019ve thought this for a while. He\u2019s addicted to glory, and there\u2019s a helluva lot of that on offer to substitutes these days. Tim de Lisle articulated it very well here. It wouldn\u2019t be remotely surprising if he scored the winner tonight.  Updated at 7.57pm GMT    5.53pm    Morocco\u2019s winning penalty was one for the books. Achraf Hakimi, born in Spain, kissed the most nonchalant Panenka past the diving Unai Simon. Whatever happens for the rest of the tournament, Qatar 2022 will forever be associated with Morocco. Poor Spain have gone out of the last three tournaments on penalties.   Updated at 6.10pm GMT    5.50pm   The teams  Benfica\u2019s Goncalo Ramos replaces Ronaldo up front for Portugal, one of eight changes from the defeat to South Korea on Friday. The survivors are Diogo Costa, Diogo Dalot (who is preferred to Joao Cancelo) and Pepe. Switzerland make two changes from the win over Serbia. Edimilison Fernandes replaces Silvan Widmer at right-back, and the fit-again Yann Sommer returns in goal. Portugal (4-2-3-1ish) Costa; Dalot, Pepe, Dias, Guerreiro; Carvalho, Otavio; Fernandes, B Silva, Felix; Ramos.Substitutes: Patricio, Palhinha, Ronaldo, Andre Silva, Sa, Leao, Vitinha, Mario, Neves, Cancelo, Horta, Nunes, Antonio Silva. Switzerland (4-2-3-1) Sommer; Fernandes, Schar, Akanji, Rodriguez; Freuler, Xhaka; Shaqiri, Sow, Vargas; Embolo.Substitutes: Elvedi, Zakaria, Seferovic, Steffen, Omlin, Aebischer, Fassnacht, Comert, Okafor, Frei, Kobel, Kohn, Rieder, Jashari. Referee Cesar Arturo Ramos Palazuelos (Mexico)   Updated at 7.08pm GMT    5.49pm   MOROCCO ARE IN THE QUARTER-FINALS!  Full time: Morocco 0-0 Spain (3-0 pens) Glorious scenes at the Education City Stadium, where Morocco have made history by reaching the last eight of the World Cup for the first time. Spain suffered the usual problems in front of goal. They couldn\u2019t score in normal time \u2013 or even in the penalty shootout, when they missed three out of three. Morocco will now play Portugal or Switzerland for a place in the semi-bloody-finals.   Updated at 6.08pm GMT    5.38pm    Why Cristiano Ronaldo has been dropped (possibly)      5.36pm   Team news: Ronaldo on the bench  Fernando Santos wasn\u2019t joking: he\u2019s dropped Cristiano Ronaldo, apparently in response to Ronaldo effing and jeffing when he was taken off against South Korea. Either that or he has used Ronaldo\u2019s outburst as an excuse to drop a player who is sadly past it. We\u2019ll have the full line-ups shortly.    Updated at 6.23pm GMT    5.31pm    Tonight\u2019s winner will play Morocco or Spain in the quarter-finals. That match is about to go penalties, and John Brewin politely requests your company.      5.30pm    The story so far Portugal turned it on the second half to beat Ghana 3-2 and Uruguay 2-0 and qualify with a game to spare. A much-changed side lost 2-1 to South Korea, but they still won the group. Switzerland did the necessary against Cameroon, with Breel Embolo scoring the only goal against the country of his birth. Then they lost a tight game to Brazil, which set up a winner-takes-all clash with Serbia. Switzerland had the draw, too, but they didn\u2019t need it: they came from behind to win a thrilling, spiky game 3-2.      5.30pm   Preamble  Let\u2019s get one thing clear from the start: this could be a long night. With the possible exception of Japan v Croatia \u2013 and look how that turned out \u2013 Portugal v Switzerland always felt like the closest match in the last 16. I\u2019m not saying we should jump straight to the penalty shootout right now, but I\u2019m not holding out much hope of watching The White Lotus at 9pm. Whether it\u2019s via penalties or not, one of these sides will achieve something pretty rare in the next few hours. Switzerland haven\u2019t won a World Cup knockout game \u2013 or even scored a goal in one \u2013 since 1954, and Portugal, surprisingly for such a celebrated football nation, have only reached the last eight on two occasions. The first was in 1966, Eusebio and all that, and the second in 2006. There\u2019s one survivor from that tournament in the current squad; you know his name. Kick off 7pm in Lisbon and London, 8pm in Bern, 10pm in Lusail.  Updated at 6.31pm GMT "

Already difficult to mine, there are only a few sources in the world that produce the gas. Currently, the United States is one of the world\u2019s largest helium producers, along with Qatar and Algeria. However, due to supply chain disruptions, including production plant closures and the 2017 embargo on Qatar, the global supply of helium has been severely affected. In addition to the shortage affecting various instruments and machines that require the gas to function safely, various companies have been struck with negative balloon sales. In a quarterly earnings call on Thursday, Dollar Tree executives said that they are \u201conce again\u201d experiencing a helium shortage which could impact its sales. \u201cCurrently, helium demand is greater than supply, so our stores are finding themselves temporarily out of helium from time to time as they wait for new deliveries,\u201d Dollar Tree said in a statement on its website. \u201cWe know this can be tricky when getting ready for a party, and we are very sorry for the inconvenience,\u201d it added. Party City CEO Brad Weston said that major helium supplies have placed allocations on the gas. The shortage has also been impacting the National Weather Service, which uses the odorless gas to fill weather balloons. Weather balloons are released twice daily across the country and provide various weather forecasting information. However, because of the shortage, numerous balloon sites have had to cut back on launches. Other groups that have been affected by the helium shortage include the Nebraska Cornhuskers. On Monday, the football team announced that it has had to suspend its traditional touchdown celebration of red balloons. \u201cWe\u2019ve been asked by the university that the helium we are getting as a university we need to use for medical purposes at UNMC in Omaha,\u201d said Nebraska athletic director Trev Alberts, adding, \u201cAnd so we are this year not going to be providing the red balloons for the first time at Memorial stadium.\u201d"

                    "body": "After an extraordinary 2022, Nottingham Forest must focus on what lies ahead rather than behind. After a dramatic promotion came a plethora of signings and a stuttering start to life in the Premier League to leave them in a relegation battle. January could define Forest\u2019s 2023, starting with the visit of Chelsea on New Year\u2019s Day. Steve Cooper\u2019s side will then face their relegation rivals Southampton, Leicester and Bournemouth, with a couple of cup ties to break up the league fixtures. In between they will be working to bring in further signings to bolster their squad. The past 10 days has been a reminder of where Forest have come from: they ended the World Cup break with a thrashing of the Championship side Blackburn in the Carabao Cup but followed it by being eased aside at Manchester United, who made the most of mistakes committed by meek opponents.  The season began with the same 5-2-3 formation that served Cooper so well in the second tier but it was clear that it left them too open, especially while incorporating all the new signings. Since the 4-0 humbling by Leicester at the start of October that almost resulted in Cooper being dispensed with Forest have looked more organised and compact, making them harder to beat while collecting nine points from seven games. January will see the arrival of a small number of signings but that will mean some being moved out because Forest already have 25 registered players for the Premier League. The Brazilian attacking midfielder Gustavo Scarpa will join on a free from Palmeiras and has already appeared in friendlies during the World Cup break. A defender and central midfielder are the priorities for Cooper and the new sporting director, Filippo Giraldi. The headline summer signings of Jesse Lingard and Morgan Gibbs-White are still forging a relationship in attack, which may explain Forest having one away league goal this season. Both are doubts for Chelsea\u2019s visit to the City Ground with muscle issues. Gibbs-White picked up his injury in a friendly against Valencia, while Lingard\u2019s Old Trafford return ended prematurely because of \u201cfatigue in his hamstring\u201d, according to Cooper. Lingard\u2019s right thigh was heavily strapped and his availability may be in doubt. \u201cJesse walked off the other night and we\u2019re still waiting for that to settle down, in terms of the exact damage, if any at all,\u201d Cooper said. Scoring goals has been a problem and one that is unlikely to be helped by the potential absence of Lingard and Gibbs-White. Taiwo Awoniyi has four goals at an impressive one every 183 minutes played. Despite his strike rate, he operated from the left wing against Manchester United, while Lingard was in the central role.  Cooper will have to decide soon whether to back Awoniyi as a No 9 and give him a chance to flourish in the role he was used to playing for Union Berlin, or come up with an alternative. In the cup win at Blackburn Awoniyi and Brennan Johnson thrived; there was a thought during the summer to play the two as a partnership up front, which could be an option worth revisiting. A forward could arrive to bolster options in the final third. In the summer Leeds\u2019 Cyrensio Summerville and Sheffield United\u2019s Iliman Ndiaye were both suggested as signings by the recruitment team but Lingard was acquired by the hierarchy. Summerville and Ndiaye have impressed since but are now out of reach.  As Forest found out, organisational levels need to be matched by concentration to keep out the best teams in the Premier League. Like United, Chelsea have an array of attackers that open up teams and plenty of plans to make opponents look foolish. They looked confident in their victory over Bournemouth, with Kai Havertz, Mason Mount and Raheem Sterling causing problems for the Cherries at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday. Forest\u2019s defence will be wary of their threat, albeit Chelsea are likely to be without the injured Mount. Joe Worrall looks more composed in defence after a rocky start to the season but the return to fitness of Moussa Niakhat\u00e9 would be a great help to Cooper. The centre-back impressed in his first two games but has not featured since mid-August, while Serge Aurier and Renan Lodi have continued to improve. There is already a squad capable of staying in the Premier League at the City Ground and a couple of further additions should further boost Forest\u2019s survival hopes. Upsetting Chelsea in front of a raucous home crowd would underscore their value to the club. The Chelsea result will not define Forest\u2019s month but it could change the course of it, on and off the pitch."

But the fitness of key attacker Ajdin Hrustic remains in question for Saturday\u2019s match at Al Janoub Stadium. Karacic, who plays Italian Serie B side Brescia Calcio, has been given the nod ahead of other options Thomas Deng and Milo\u0161 Degenek.  The 26-year-old, who was selected in Bert van Marwijk\u2019s extended squad for Russia 2018 but missed the final cut, is more defensively minded than Atkinson, who endured a difficult World Cup debut against Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 in Tuesday night\u2019s 4-1 humbling. \u201cNathaniel got a bit of a knock on the ankle again, that\u2019s why we took him off [against France],\u201d Arnold said in his pre-match press conference. \u201cFran Karacic will come in and we\u2019ll get him ready for the game.\u201d The previous day Arnold acknowledged Atkinson\u2019s baptism of fire. \u201cI just said him, \u2018you\u2019re going to remember this for the rest of your life, mate\u2019,\u201d Arnold said. \u201c\u2018You\u2019re going to sit there in 20 years\u2019 time when you retire, with a beer in your hand, telling everyone how you played against one of the best players in the world, and you\u2019re going to show them two mistakes, but 10 things you did great\u2019.\u201d  The Socceroos trained under the sun for the first time since arriving in Doha on Friday, in preparation for a 1pm local time kick-off, with temperatures hovering in the early 30s despite it being winter and the air conditioning in stadiums not completely compensating for the oppressive heat. Arnold offered little on Hrustic, who has been recovering from an ankle injury and played no part in Australia\u2019s opener, saying on that \u201che\u2019s getting there\u201d. \u201cHe trained well tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cHe recovered well, he\u2019s mentally and physically in good shape. Tomorrow will be a physical game, we\u2019ve got to match the physical aspect of it.\u201d He was also vague on other personnel changes, including which striker he would start. Mitchell Duke was in the XI against France for his physicality and ability to hold up the ball, but Jamie Maclaren\u2019s intelligence and off-the-shoulder runs could be a good fit in the bid to break down Tunisia. \u201cJamie\u2019s a great goal-scorer,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cMitchell Duke works hard ... at some stage you\u2019ll see both of them on the field.\u201d Duke is one of three players carrying yellow cards, along with Jackson Irvine and Aaron Mooy. Arnold, however, indicated he was willing to risk them all playing despite the possibility of a second yellow and automatic suspension for the third and final game against Denmark. Meanwhile, the Tunisia coach, Jalel Kadri, said he was \u201cnot surprised by the score\u201d of Australia\u2019s 4-1 humbling at the hands of defending champions France. He noted several times Australia\u2019s \u201cstamina and fitness\u201d, but had little else to say about the team\u2019s strengths. \u201cThe Australian team is capable of playing a high level of matches,\u201d Kadri said. \u201cThey have players who are able to run very rapidly, who can take opportunities. Nevertheless, they have some weaknesses that we will be able to [exploit].\u201d"

We were just p!ssing boy when we realised we\u2019d gone almost 30 seconds without enjoying a \u201cfrom the England camp\u201d update. By way of penance, we have drenched ourselves in stale beer, eaten a packet of Lambert &amp; Butler and \u2013 most painfully of all \u2013 pretended to like football, in order to recreate that special Boxpark atmosphere in the comfort of our own boxroom. That\u2019ll show those French, what with their good food, fine wine, suave behaviour, easy adult calisthenics, and refusal to remain supine when persecuted by a cruel and corrupt government.\nExcuse us, we jest. Because while the aforementioned \u201cFrench\u201d still have plenty to learn when it comes to puddings \u2013 fight us! \u2013 this latest encounter feels different to the usual \u2019Allo! \u2019Allo! vacuity because this England team feels different. The devastating, disquieting competence with which they dismissed a Senegal team helpfully shorn of its best players is one thing. The real thing, though, is a spirit the Daily has never before seen in the national side, no longer split along club lines nor defined by exhibition toxic masculinity, but a lesson in what Justin Langer, the hilarious Australian comic, termed \u201celite mateship\u201d.\n\nThe Daily is old, so must confess to missing the experience of Real Football Men banging on about what they were going to do, prior to their inevitable collapse \u2013 under pressure and into paroxysms of tears \u2013 live on television. But also, the Daily is moved to the point of sweaty eyeballs by a young, multicultural and cohesive bunch of mates loving each other\u2019s company and celebrating each other\u2019s success while absolutely having it \u2013 in the process, teaching a jaded, divided, ailing country the simple values of kindness, honesty and integrity (if only it had the collective capacity for learning).\nSo England roll on to meet the aforementioned \u201cFrench\u201d, who are bidding to become the first country to retain the World Cup since Brazil in 1958 and 1962. Inspired by Didier Deschamps\u2019 insouciant, incomparable, prophetic genius in being born in the same country as Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, they have been perhaps the most impressive side in the competition, with Olivier Giroud also to the fore. We\u2019re not one to namedrop, principally because we never go anywhere or meet anyone, but we did once come across France\u2019s all-time leading scorer in a trendy nightspot convenience. \u201cHey, you\u2019re \u2026 you\u2019re \u2026\u201d ventured the attendant attendant; \u201cOlivier Giroud?\u201d wondered Olivier Giroud. \u201cYou can tell it\u2019s him,\u201d we advised as the attendant pondered, \u201cbecause he\u2019s admiring himself in the mirror \u2026 in fairness, with good reason.\u201d Oh how they laughed \u2013 we think.\nWhich leaves us with just six days of hype to endure before the sides meet on Saturday evening in what promises to be an altercation for the ages. Which is to say this tournament is poised to do what the organisers hoped it would do: narcotise us to its dark side with the incomparable magic of football. Which is why this England squad is so special: they ensure we can\u2019t forget that the beauty of the beautiful game extends way beyond the game.\nLIVE ON BIG WEBSITE!\nJoin Daniel Harris from 3pm GMT for MBM coverage of Japan 1-2 Croatia, before Scott Murray is on hand for Brazil 2-0 South Korea at 7pm.\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\n\u201cPropagating the Fifa line that athletes shouldn\u2019t stand up for human rights and that a desire for social justice inhibits athletic performance.

                    "body": "Eddie Jones is poised to learn his fate as the England head coach in the next fortnight with the Rugby Football Union conducting a review into the \u201creally disappointing\u201d autumn campaign, stating that results have not been good enough. Bill Sweeney, the RFU chief executive, will lead the review, holding a series of meetings with board and executive members as well as former players and coaches, whose participation is on the condition of anonymity, over the next two weeks and deciding whether to back Jones through to the 2023 World Cup or replace him with barely 10 months to go. In a short statement on Sunday, the union expressed its dismay at an autumn campaign with just one win from four matches, and opted against giving its public backing to Jones.  Removing Jones at this stage is a nuclear option but while he was given the RFU\u2019s full support after another torrid Six Nations campaign this year, the statement on Sunday was more circumspect with well\u2011placed sources pointing to a reluctance to pre\u2011empt the review. Sweeney is also under pressure to be proactive after he was accused of being \u201casleep on the job\u201d, at parliamentary inquiry last week over the plights of Worcester and Wasps, with the World Cup\u2011winning coach Sir Clive Woodward expressing his dismay at the union\u2019s leadership. The wretched defeat against South Africa on Saturday ensured England finish 2022 with just five wins from 12 matches, bookending their worst run of results across a calendar year since 2008, with Jones braced for an \u201cuncomfortable\u201d review. He is likely to be grilled on his players\u2019 discipline, the quality of his coaching staff and his leadership group, having emphasised the importance of those aspects during a presentation he gave to the RFU council shortly before the autumn campaign. Players may also give feedback amid reports of discontent in some quarters. It is understood that at the beginning of the season the RFU\u2019s target for the 2022-23 campaign was for Jones\u2019s side to be ranked in the top two or three in the world. That in itself was a tempering of expectations \u2013 the previous year the goal was to be ranked first or second \u2013 but Jones\u2019s side sit fifth and the gulf between England and the leading contenders for the World Cup has been laid bare throughout 2022.  At full-time on Saturday a chorus of boos rang out at Twickenham and, though Jones said he did not hear it, Sweeney made pointed reference to the views of supporters. \u201cWe would like to thank England fans for their patience and support, it matters to us how they feel,\u201d Sweeney said. \u201cLike them we are really disappointed with the results of the Autumn Nations Series. Despite strong individual performances and some great new talent coming into the team, the overall results are not where we expect them to be.\u201d Jones acknowledged the review will be painful but he remains convinced he has a plan in place for England to win the World Cup. \u201c[Reviews] are always uncomfortable when you\u2019re not winning,\u201d Jones said.  \u201cI haven\u2019t found the review comfortable when you\u2019re not winning. [Bill will] have his opinion, based on what you guys write, and I\u2019ll have my opinion. And we\u2019ll share it. We\u2019ve always got a plan. I\u2019ve got a plan for how England can win the World Cup, but it doesn\u2019t go in a perfect line.\u201d  Jones was due to hold meetings with all of his squad on Sunday and said he intends to largely stick by his current crop of players as well as a handful of those out injured such as Courtney Lawes. \u201cThis will be the base of [the squad],\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there\u2019ll be other players to come back in when they\u2019re fit and ready. We\u2019ve picked everyone who we think are the best players, fit and ready, for this campaign, and we\u2019ll do the same thing for the Six Nations, then we\u2019ll do the same for the World Cup.\u201d After England\u2019s two defeats this autumn, Jones has blamed individual errors, specific areas of the game or circumstances such as how his side begin campaigns slowly because, coming from so many different clubs, they lack the cohesion of their rivals. After South Africa\u2019s victory Jones expressed his disapproval at how Angus Gardner refereed the scrum. \u201cI have grave concerns about how the scrum was refereed,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s part of the deal isn\u2019t it? You\u2019ve got to live with that. One of the things I have learned about coaching is you have to find the major problem, and the major problem was the scrum.\u201d"

                    "body": "Good morning. There were two awkward misfires arising from the UK\u2019s pioneering space launch on Monday, and this newsletter isn\u2019t about Grant Shapps\u2019s dodgy Photoshop job. After a Virgin Orbit Boeing 747 took off from Cornwall at 10pm, carrying what would have been the first satellites to get into space from anywhere in western Europe, spectators at the launch site outside Newquay did a conga. The rocket carrying the satellites was released at 35,000 feet an hour later \u2013 and briefly made it into space. But then came \u201can anomaly that has prevented us from reaching orbit\u201d, and mission failure. Now UK air accident investigators are trying to work out what went wrong. Melissa Thorpe, the head of Spaceport Cornwall, called the news \u201cabsolutely devastating\u201d. But Virgin Orbit will try again \u2013 and all over the UK, a burgeoning space industry is watching with interest. Today\u2019s newsletter, with the intrepid operations director of a spaceport in \u2013 get this \u2013 SHETLAND, is about what it would mean to get there. Here are the headlines. PS One other intergalactic innovation: from today, we\u2019re adding the Guardian\u2019s new Wordiply game to the puzzle links at the end of the email. I scored 100% yesterday with DOWNHEARTEDLY, and will be dining out on it all week. Five big stories  Strikes | The government\u2019s standoff with public sector workers has escalated with plans for a coordinated \u201cday of action\u201d by unions, who have reacted furiously to proposed legislation they say could let ministers in effect ban strikes in some areas. Environment | Twelve European countries broke monthly temperature records last year, as the continent had its hottest summer on record, new analysis of EU data by the Guardian has found. Ukraine | The head of Russia\u2019s Wagner mercenary group has claimed his forces have completed the takeover of the Ukrainian town of Soledar in the country\u2019s east. If confirmed it would mark Moscow\u2019s first major battlefield success since last summer. Prince Harry | Prince Harry\u2019s autobiography has become the UK\u2019s fastest-selling nonfiction book ever, recording figures of 400,000 on its first day on sale. His publisher said the only books to have sold more copies were \u201cthose starring the other Harry [Potter]\u201d. Golden Globes | Steven Spielberg\u2019s The Fabelmans, Martin McDonagh\u2019s The Banshees of Inisherin and TV shows House of the Dragon and the White Lotus were among the winners at the Golden Globes. The ceremony was an awkward return for the awards after the 2022 TV broadcast was cancelled over a lack of diversity in the judging panel.  In depth: \u2018Space is hard. But failure is part of the business\u2019  The Shetland Islands boast 150,000 sheep, close to 25,000 people, and one half-finished spaceport. When a retired RAF flight lieutenant proposed repurposing a former airbase as a satellite launch site on the island of Unst in 2017, the community council thought it was an April fool\u2019s joke; six years later, it has a completed launch pad and hopes to send rockets into orbit this year. \u201cThe pace of change in this business is incredible,\u201d said Scott Hammond, deputy CEO and operations director of SaxaVord Spaceport UK. He was speaking from an office a few kilometres from the Unst launch site. \u201cTen years ago, it was a dream. But as we move towards it being a reality, the excitement builds.\u201d Shetland and Cornwall are not the only sites in the UK, although along with one in Sutherland, they are the most advanced: further spaceports are under construction in Argyll, Prestwick, Snowdonia and the Outer Hebrides. The UK Space Agency estimates that the wider industry generated \u00a316.5bn in income in 2019/20 and employs about 47,000 people. So how did space get so massive \u2013 and how much of a setback is Monday\u2019s failure? *** What went wrong with the Cornwall launch? That is still under investigation \u2013 but Virgin Orbit said the problems occurred \u201cduring the firing of the rocket\u2019s second stage engine\u201d. The company said that it had failed to reach the 17,000 mph it needed to gain the correct altitude and said that one possibility is that it was slowed down because the rocket\u2019s casing did not fall away as it should have. This isn\u2019t a total shock: documents submitted (PDF) to the Civil Aviation Authority before the launch estimated the chance of failure at 27%. Matt Archer, the director of commercial space flight at the UK Space Agency, said that there had been tears when the news came through, but added: \u201cWe achieved a launch. A lot of positives have been achieved. Space is hard.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s easy to feel down about it,\u201d Hammond said. \u201cBut failure is part of the business. However much computer testing you do, until you light the blue touchpaper, you never really know. And you often learn more from failure than success. They didn\u2019t get satellites into orbit, but I think they\u2019ve achieved 90% of their tick list.\u201d The markets took a less philosophical view: Virgin Orbit\u2019s shares finished 14% down on the Nasdaq stock exchange. *** Why does it matter?  Way back in 2021 before Grant Shapps erased him from a publicity photo, Boris Johnson declared his aim of creating a \u201cGalactic Britain\u201d. You may view this as empty cheerleading \u2013 and going to space might seem a fairly marginal concern in a time of deepening earthbound crises. But Hammond insists that there is vast commercial potential. \u201cThe global appetite for space data is incredible,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the UK is very well placed to capitalise on it.\u201d This isn\u2019t about Apollo-style tilts at the moon, but more modest low-orbit commercial launches of small satellites, which have applications from high-speed broadband to climate monitoring. The UK already has significant expertise in their manufacture \u2013 which accounts for the size of the industry already. Once they are built, though, they are shipped abroad \u2013 and there is not a single working launch site anywhere in Europe. \u201cWe have clients from Germany, France, Turkey \u2013 this isn\u2019t just about British satellites,\u201d Hammond said. \u201cThe UK is in an ideal position to get that business.\u201d *** Why the UK? Other European countries are also trying to get into the game: Hammond mentions Norway as a particular competitor, and Sweden is also close to a launch. But because of its long coastline and island location, the UK has many potential sites without the risks that come with doing so near built-up areas. Hammond points to another advantage at a northerly site like his: \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to get to the moon, you want to be as near to the equator as possible, to take advantage of the Earth\u2019s spin. If you want to get into polar orbit [that is, travelling past the Earth from north to south] you want the opposite.\u201d That means less fuel, and more payload \u2013 and with customers paying a ballpark $10,000 per kg aboard a rocket, that is enormously valuable over time. *** Why did I see a jumbo jet instead of a rocket take off in Cornwall?  There are two fairly self-explanatory launch types: horizontal and vertical. Horizontal launches like the one in Cornwall see a jet take a rocket off the ground before releasing it in the upper atmosphere. Vertical launches just go straight up without the assistance of an aeroplane. (See the mock-up of a launch at the Shetland site above.) The Cornwall site is in the minority \u2013 about 90% of launches are vertical \u2013 but it has advantages: each launch uses less fuel, and it\u2019s easier to set up a site at an existing airport. \u201cThey also say weather has less impact,\u201d said Hammond. \u201cBut the big thing with vertical launches is that they\u2019re much better understood, you know what satellites need to be able to withstand.\u201d Of course, as he also cheerfully notes, he\u2019s biased. *** What happens next? If you\u2019re hoping that the answer to this is your own shot at space tourism, you may be disappointed: while there are occasional noises about sub-orbital trips for paying customers in the UK, it\u2019s likely to remain the preserve of the not-totally-relatable likes of Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson and Elon Musk for a while yet. Hammond is sufficiently excited about the satellite business to make up for it. \u201cThere\u2019s so much potential,\u201d he says. \u201cTwo thousand people went to see a 747 get airborne in Cornwall \u2013 but it\u2019s not quite as sexy as a rocket going up, is it?\u201d The Shetlands are quite a remote spot for casual observers, I say, but he is undeterred. \u201cWhen people go to Florida they go to Cape Canaveral \u2013 we fully expect to have people coming here.\u201d \u201cI would love it to get to the point where the 9.30 launch from Shetland is just as normal as the 9.30 flight from Heathrow to New York,\u201d he added. \u201c100 years ago, it would have been unbelievable - now it\u2019s just mundane. That\u2019s where we want to get to.\u201d What else we\u2019ve been reading   Simon Hattenstone has a touching interview with Vernon Vanriel (above), a boxer from the Windrush generation who was stopped from returning to the UK because of the government\u2019s hostile environment policy. Hattenstone unravels a story of extraordinary human resilience, as Vanriel talks about everything from his 1970s athletic career to more than a decade spent homeless in Jamaica. Nimo Are white women being banned from buying black hair brands? Of course they\u2019re not, writes Kemi Alemoru, but an increase in demand for hair products which are already hard to get hold of \u2013 coupled with the potential dangers of others, such as chemical relaxers \u2013 makes this an emotionally charged topic for many. Hannah J Davies, deputy editor, newsletters Sped-up versions of old pop hits seem innocuous. But, like much of the music industry, there is more to this warped-sound trend, writes Alaina Demopoulos. \u201cIt\u2019s a murky business that leaves industry-watchers sceptical of potential deals between labels and streaming services.\u201d Nimo Not a reading but a listening pick: if, like me, you\u2019re glued to Happy Valley, the BBC\u2019s Obsessed With\u2026 companion pod should keep you going until that big betrayal is explained on Sunday night. Hannah Even if it is out of the grasp of a huge proportion of people my age, we are still told that home ownership is what we should be aiming for. Not necessarily, argues Arwa Mahdawi who, after buying a home in Philadelphia, has spent the last year slowly realising that the grass might not be greener after all. Nimo  Sport  Football | Two late goals from Marcus Rashford (above) were the final nails in the coffin for Charlton Athletic\u2019s Carabao Cup hopes. Manchester United go forward to the semi-final with a comfortable 3-0 win. Elsewhere, Newcastle progressed to their first major cup semi-final in 18 years thanks to a 2-0 win against Leicester in the Carabao quarter-finals. Football | Qatar Sports Investment, the owners of super-rich PSG, are considering taking a minority stake in Spurs. Under European club rules they cannot own more than one club in Uefa competitions, but there\u2019s nothing to stop them owning a smaller share of the club, with Qatar said to be determined to capitalise on the success of the World Cup by broadening their portfolio to the Premier League. Cricket | Test cricket isn\u2019t often associated with revolution. But after England\u2019s embrace of \u201cBazball\u201d \u2013 an approach to the long-form game that stresses positivity and freedom for players \u2013 led the national team to a nine victories in 10 matches last year, and is now being introduced to the county game by captain Ben Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum.

                    "body": "\u201cEnglish people can drink!\u201d exclaimed Sarina Wiegman the morning after the night before. \u201cA little bit too much alcohol, I think. But that\u2019s OK, we enjoyed it. When you have these accomplishments it\u2019s really good to have a party.\u201d It was a passage that summed up England\u2019s manager rather well. Wiegman may come across as an austere, stern figure on the touchline and her businesslike manner has quickly imprinted itself on the new European champions since her arrival last September. But there is a much lighter side, too, and it has been evident in the way her team play: industry setting the path for invention and the kinds of flourish that sent England off into an evening that was worth the sunglasses and sore heads.  She has achieved the unprecedented feat of back-to-back continental titles with different countries and nobody does that purely by playing bad cop. It is true that unsentimental decisions helped to shape her wins in both 2017 and 2022; few will need reminding of the way she dropped her captain, Mandy van den Berg, two games into the Netherlands\u2019 campaign five years ago and the omission of Steph Houghton raised plenty of eyebrows this time. But Wiegman has created the happiest, closest-knit England camp in recent memory and it has helped them to eke out huge results when, as against Spain and in the final on Sunday, matches have been at risk of getting away from them. \u201cShe\u2019s the missing ingredient England were looking for,\u201d the captain, Leah Williamson, told a huge Trafalgar Square crowd after the squad had taken the stage. \u201cShe has brought us all together. She is a special person and puts us first as human beings.\u201d It has been a common refrain. Wiegman has transformed the way England\u2019s players relate to each other, Beth Mead pointing out that honesty and mutual respect have grown in tandem since her arrival. \u201cWe trust now that what we say to each other is for the best and that it won\u2019t go outside the group \u2013 it\u2019s become easy to speak to each other,\u201d Mead said before the final. That is priceless when difficult words need to be offered; it also adds another dimension to the level of enjoyment players can take in winning through a monumentalcollective effort. Dutch dressing rooms have a reputation for being forthright and, with her national team and her adopted country, Wiegman has transferred the better elements of that. \u201cShe wants everybody on the same page,\u201d said Baroness Sue Campbell, the Football Association\u2019s director of women\u2019s football. \u201cWhen we interviewed her we knew we were getting the best tactical and technical coach in the world. What we didn\u2019t know was that we were getting this exceptional human being.\u201d Campbell admitted she felt winning Euro 2022 could be a tall order for Wiegman in light of her appointment\u2019s timing; perhaps the idea they had employed an alchemist felt too good to be true.  Given the arduousness of England\u2019s 50-year journey to this point, though, there is something surreal about the fact Wiegman has helped them to clear their biggest step in a mere 11 months. The raw materials had been present under Hope Powell, Mark Sampson and Phil Neville; all of those coaches produced at least some results that confirmed the Lionesses\u2019 regular presence as contenders but none, for different reasons, could haul them over the line. Wiegman has tied up the loose ends to form a sleek, formidable unit and the question now is how far England can progress with her at the helm. In 2019 Wiegman\u2019s Netherlands side fell agonisingly short of backing up their Euro 2017 title with a stunning World Cup win. They were deservedly beaten by USA but it was hardly a letdown: a young squad had not been expected to win their home tournament two years previously, in which they routed a desperately disappointing England at the semi-final stage, and remained a longish shot to go the distance in France. This summer\u2019s last-eight finish under Mark Parsons felt more akin to their natural resting place; nobody could realistically have taken them further but this England generation still feel they have a distance to travel. It can do no harm that the next World Cup is less than a year away. England will enter it with momentum, a rock-solid team spirit and a team of proven operators in perhaps the planet\u2019s strongest league. They can keep themselves honest with a tough-looking away fixture against Austria in September, knowing a draw would guarantee they top qualifying Group D, and then move to the task at hand in Australia and New Zealand. The buildup to that tournament should hit fever pitch on these shores now: Wiegman will have enjoyed a honeymoon extending to almost two years but there is little chance she or England will bask for too long in the glow.  \u201cThe way she talks is quite interesting,\u201d the FA\u2019s chief executive, Mark Bullingham, said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not just about success on the pitch, it\u2019s about that legacy. She\u2019s just a really transparent person with really strong values.\u201d The famously humble Wiegman will spend her summer camper van holiday eschewing the glitz and the glare. Talk of an honorary damehood may be realised in time but whether it hits home is another matter. \u201cI think she would probably turn it down because she is just not that person,\u201d said Lucy Bronze. \u201cI think she would be so embarrassed if we try and push for it. We want it to be about the team and it starts with Sarina. It\u2019s going to be hard for her to fight off the attention now.\u201d There is still some more partying to be done but the sense is that, under Wiegman, England have only just got to work."

                    "body": "Not so long ago, Riqui Puig was seen as the face of Barcelona\u2019s future. At a time when the identity of the Catalan club was in question, the young midfielder was the embodiment of what Barca aspired to be again. He ticked all the boxes: diminutive, homegrown and extremely talented. Puig was the next La Masia graduate primed to make it big at Camp Nou, so it\u2019s somewhat surprising to now see the 22-year-old in Major League Soccer. The LA Galaxy announced the signing of Puig on a three-year deal on Thursday with Barcelona so keen to cut their bloated wage bill that they allowed the midfielder to leave for free. \u201cRiqui is a very technical and well-educated player with incredible experiences for his age,\u201d said Galaxy head coach Greg Vanney. \u201cHe will fit seamlessly into our group and style of play.\u201d  In any other summer, this would be the standout, headline-grabbing transfer involving an MLS club, and it might still be the most noteworthy of this summer\u2019s activity due to Puig\u2019s age and reputation. This, however, hasn\u2019t been an ordinary summer in MLS. There have been numerous landmark deals struck across the league. In fact, this has been the biggest summer in MLS history. Puig\u2019s move to the LA Galaxy comes just one month after Los Angeles FC completed the signing of Gareth Bale and just three weeks since Toronto FC landed Federico Bernardeschi. None of these players are typical MLS \u2018retirement league\u2019 signings. They are far from washed up. They are not in MLS for one final pay check. They had other options closer to home in traditionally stronger leagues, but chose to sign for an MLS club instead. That says something. Of course, bigger names have made the move to MLS in the past. David Beckham, Thierry Henry, Didier Drogba, Steven Gerrard, Kaka, Frank Lampard and David Villa all played in MLS, but they all did so in the latter stages of their careers. These signings made MLS a destination in the transfer market, but only for those looking for a final destination.  This is where a dramatic shift has occurred this summer. It\u2019s not just the ageing superstars considering MLS as an option, it\u2019s elite performers in their peak too. Puig had offers from Lyon, Monaco and Wolves, according to reports. He also rejected loan offers to leave Barcelona in the January transfer window, but it was the LA Galaxy that turned his head. If the Galaxy can get one or two productive signings of Puig before sending him back to Europe at a profit, that will be considered a great success. This might be the plan for all parties and could form the core of a transfer policy that attracts more peak-age players from Europe in the years to come. Bale was linked with clubs in the Premier League and had the option to play for his hometown team Cardiff City, but he decided MLS would be the best place for him to prepare for the 2022 World Cup. Bernardeschi is similarly an important figure for his national team alongside Italy teammate Lorenzo Insigne, who also joined Toronto FC from Serie A this summer. Neither believe the move to MLS will necessarily impact their international careers.  Cucho Hernandez doesn\u2019t have the name-recognition of the aforementioned players, but at 23 years old he is still at an early stage of his career. Fresh from a season that saw him score five times in 25 Premier League appearances for Watford, it\u2019s notable that he too has ended up in MLS this summer, signing for the Columbus Crew in a club-record deal. It\u2019s not just in the transfers MLS clubs have done that a shift has been witnessed this summer, but in some of the transfers that weren\u2019t done. Jesse Lingard, for example, was reportedly on DC United\u2019s radar not long after Wayne Rooney\u2019s appointment as head coach. Ultimately, Lingard stayed in the Premier League and signed for Nottingham Forest on a contract believed to be worth \u00a3180,000-a-week, but the links to DC United carried credibility. It was a possibility. MLS finds itself at a critical juncture in its development. The league openly aspires to be one of the best in the world and with every signing like that of Puig, Bale and Bernardeschi the needle moves that bit closer to this becoming a reality. The record $2.5bn broadcast deal recently struck with Apple TV was another sign of progress while the 2026 World Cup will be an opportunity to reach more fans. But MLS might have to liberate its 28 (soon-to-be 29) member clubs in order to accelerate its growth. Philadelphia Union sporting director Ernst Tanner publicly questioned how LAFC managed to squeeze Bale and Giorgio Chiellini under the salary cap with the pair signed on TAM (Targeted Allocation Money) deals. While Tanner was fined by MLS for his remarks, and there is no suggestion of any rule-breaking by LAFC, there is a sense that front office figures across the league are having to think creatively to sign the players they want. MLS could make their life easier by raising the salary cap and authorising clubs to spend more. One could argue MLS is now holding itself back. It can be tedious viewing everything that happens in MLS through the prism of the league\u2019s continued growth and its place in the global soccer landscape, but this summer has made such discourse unavoidable. Would Puig have signed for the LA Galaxy even 12 months ago? Would Bale have used MLS to prepare for the last World Cup in 2018? Possibly not, but more and more players aren\u2019t looking at what the league was in the past, or even what it could be in the future, but what it is right now.  This article was amended on 5 August 2022. The original version wrongly stated that Italy qualified for the 2022 World Cup finals in Qatar when they did not. "

                    "body": "Wout Faes is in full flow, his appetite for the Premier League clear as he reflects on his first few weeks at Leicester City. \u201cFor me to be here now is a dream,\u201d he says. \u201cEverything that I thought the Premier League would be, it is. The most-viewed, everything around it \u2026 also on the pitch, the intensity is something I quite like. They [officials] let the game play a little longer than I was used to. I like it because you can go 100% in every duel. You have to, actually, because otherwise you lose it. Every time I step on the pitch, I\u2019m like: \u2018OK, yeah, this is the real proper football.\u2019\u201d Faes has quickly become a popular character in the dressing room since arriving from Reims on deadline day in September and, with an unmistakable mop of hair, something of a cult hero among supporters. Brendan Rodgers stressed that his only outfield signing this summer could not be expected to invigorate an entire squad but his initiation song, John Denver\u2019s Take Me Home, Country Roads at the team hotel before Leicester played Brighton certainly proved a crowd-pleaser. \u201cEverybody knows Country Roads so they were singing along a little bit,\u201d Faes says, tapping the table.  Faes is warm company at Leicester\u2019s vast Seagrave training complex, as he discusses facing Paris Saint-Germain in Ligue 1, playing alongside an 18-year-old Martin \u00d8degaard on loan at Heerenveen, pike fishing with his uncle in Belgium, and growing up in Mol, the town in which the cyclist Tom Boonen was born. \u201cHe is a legend,\u201d Faes says. \u201cIt is a very small place. When I was young and signed for Anderlecht [at the age of 14] people were like \u2018wow\u2019 but I was still young. Now I am playing at the highest level you notice people are proud and that\u2019s nice.\u201d Then there are those comparisons to David Luiz, another defender with a mane of natural curly hair. Faes could have followed in the Brazilian\u2019s footsteps but turned down an offer from Chelsea in his mid-teens after being spotted playing for Belgium Under-17s at a tournament in Scotland. When Faes turned 16, Chelsea sent him a signed shirt from David Luiz. \u201cWe have similar hair so maybe that is why \u2026 since then, people who I don\u2019t really know always ask the same questions. I can understand it because he was a very big player and he\u2019s played for almost all of the big teams in England but for me it\u2019s important to make my own name.\u201d  The 24-year-old insists staying in Belgium was the right call. \u201cThey [Chelsea] called me and they wanted to have me but I never really thought to go, because I knew at Anderlecht I was [in a] very, very good [place]. Maybe if I had gone there, maybe I would have got more money but that was not important. I wanted to have the best education and I knew at Anderlecht they were really counting on me and saw me as a future talent. It was more important to stay there and progress there. I never thought: \u2018I should have gone to Chelsea.\u2019 I have no regrets to not have signed there.\u201d When Faes is not on the pitch or spending time with his wife, Linde, there is a good chance he will have his head buried in a book. At the moment he is reading about Warren Buffett, how the highly successful American investor managed his money \u2013 \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street? I\u2019m not going to be that! I don\u2019t think so, but it\u2019s interesting\u201d \u2013 and has read all seven Harry Potter books. Twice. \u201cI\u2019m a big fan,\u201d he says. \u201cI love the stories so much. My favourite one was the Half-Blood Prince. I saw that Harry Potter World is near London and that is on our list to visit very soon.\u201d If Faes and Leicester, who have won once in nine attempts this season, are feeling the pressure before hosting Crystal Palace on Saturday, you would never know it. The defender is not fretting about Leicester\u2019s ominous position at the bottom but acknowledges the importance of creating a winning habit. \u201cIt\u2019s more the mental aspect that is going to make the difference. It\u2019s about staying together, all noses in the same direction. As a sportsman, you live from winning. We are doing intense sessions in training where we play one v one to get that pride of not being passed, or the pride of scoring a goal if you\u2019re a striker, to really get this [feeling] in our blood. We have to take that into the game.\u201d  For Faes, it is a case of friends reunited at Leicester, with the centre-back among four Belgium internationals on the books with hopes of making Roberto Mart\u00ednez\u2019s World Cup squad. Faes attended the same school as Youri Tielemans in Anderlecht, Institute Saint Nicolas, and played alongside him after joining the Brussels club. \u201cIt is quite funny to be in the same club now a few years later. Sometimes Youri went to a higher age group but as he did, I did the same, so we didn\u2019t play a lot of games together. We trained a lot and in daily life we saw each other almost every day.\u201d Faes is still unpacking after his \u00a315m move but he and his wife have settled in the east Midlands, where he is enjoying exploring the picture-postcard countryside. \u201cWe\u2019ve been to Oakham, which is quite nice. We live in Rutland \u2013 I think it\u2019s the smallest county in England \u2013 and it\u2019s cosy. When we wake up we see the fields and the sun come up; it\u2019s like the picture of England that you have when you read books in Belgium. We are very happy to be here.\u201d Faes\u2019s focus is on hoisting Leicester up the league and potentially playing for his country in Qatar. \u201cIt is the dream of every player to be there,\u201d Faes says of the World Cup. \u201cI\u2019ve been in the squad the last four or five times and that gives you the taste for more. Now being in the Premier League, it\u2019s going to help because I\u2019m now at the highest level. The most important thing is to perform here. If they see me play I hope they will give me more chances.\u201d"

                    "body": "Kansas City was hardly a sure bet to be named that day as one of the host cities for the 2026 World Cup, but Kathy Nelson was confident enough to arrange for one of those big-screen watch parties in the trendy Power &amp; Light District downtown when Fifa confirmed the choices on 16 June. Nelson, the president of the Kansas City Sports Commission, felt that the city, even though it is the 31st-largest metropolitan area in the US, had made a strong bid. But Fifa had leaked nothing. When Kansas City was picked, the crowd roared. She cried, a little. \u201cSeven years of work went into 10 seconds of elation,\u201d Nelson told the Guardian recently at her office. Although Nelson says this was more of a bid from the Midwest US, Kansas City will be the smallest of 11 American metro areas to host the World Cup. Kansas City beat out Phoenix, Denver, Orlando, Cincinnati and Nashville among others \u2013 making this a sports upset, of sorts. \u201cThere is a natural chip on our shoulders for the fans and sports teams in general,\u201d Jake Reid, the president of Sporting Kansas City, the city\u2019s Major League Soccer franchise, told the Guardian. \u201cThey\u2019re passionate, but there\u2019s a bit of a David v Goliath feeling here.\u201d Even though, as the story goes, the late Kansas City Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt was responsible for renaming the NFL\u2019s championship the Super Bowl after seeing his kids play with a bouncy toy called a Super Ball, Kansas City has never played host to the big game itself.  The Chiefs won the Super Bowl two years ago, but it was their first NFL title in 50 years. Kansas City has had an NBA team, the Kings, and an NHL team, the Scouts, but neither was good enough to play for a championship before moving elsewhere in the 1970s. The city\u2019s big-league baseball team, the Royals, won the World Series in 1985 and 2015, but the club, which has won only one division title in the last 36 years, appears destined for its seventh straight losing season and yet another August fire sale of its best players. What Kansas City did have, though, was location, smack-dab in the middle of the continental US, the so-called Heartland, no more than a four-hour flight to any other 2026 World Cup site. As Nelson said with a smile, \u201cWhen you look at the map, oh, we stand out.\u201d But there was apparently much more. Kansas City really does love both kinds of football, American and association. The bid was a big deal here, joined by hundreds and co-chaired by Sporting Kansas City owner Cliff Illig and Clark Hunt, Lamar\u2019s son and the current Chiefs owner. Lamar Hunt, the soft-spoken Texas oilman who died in 2006, was passionate about soccer. When Major League Soccer was formed in 1996, Hunt brought a team to Kansas City called the Wizards. The club was renamed Sporting Kansas City in 2011 and plays its home games before large crowds at a state-of-the-art 18,000-seat stadium. When Hunt died, he owned MLS teams in Columbus and Dallas. The US Open Cup, the country\u2019s largest domestic tournament, was named after Hunt in 1999. When Hunt brought the Dallas Texans to Kansas City in 1963 and renamed them the Chiefs, he was influential in establishing the Kansas City area as a youth soccer hotbed. The Heartland Soccer Association, with 30,000 players, is the largest such association in the US. FC Kansas City were among eight original members of the National Women\u2019s Soccer League, winning two championships before folding in 2017. But the NWSL added an expansion team in 2021, now called the Current, who opened their own practice facility last year and will have the league\u2019s first women\u2019s soccer specific stadium, an 11,500-seat venue along the Missouri River. \u201cThe beauty of football is that it\u2019s not about your size, it\u2019s about the size of your heart,\u201d Victor Montagliani, a member of the Fifa council, said at a news conference after a tour of Kansas City last year. \u201cThe reality is, Kansas City obviously has a stadium and is in a city that is crazy about the game.\u201d The actual infrastructure itself is being shored up. A new terminal at Kansas City International Airport is to open next year, and highway and public-transportation projects underway in the city should make it easier for thousands of international guests to get around. In the meantime, Kansas City and the Chiefs are to play host to the 2023 NFL draft. Kansas City has long been a college basketball capital: The Jayhawks, the NCAA champion, play in Lawrence, Kansas, 45 miles west of Kansas City, and the Big 12 Tournament is played at the 15-year-old T-Mobile Center in downtown Kansas City. The announcement was not so much of a culmination as it was a green light to keep preparing. At least four World Cup matches \u2013 and perhaps five to seven \u2013 are to be played at Arrowhead Stadium, the city\u2019s 76,000-seat NFL facility. But many other details remain. A schedule, not to mention the full field and group pairings of the 48 participating countries, won\u2019t be released until closer to 2026. So Nelson and Katherine Holland, who led the team that put together Kansas City\u2019s bid, are not finished. Almost immediately after the host cities were announced, attention swung, naturally, toward the economic benefit for each metropolitan region. Such a boon is difficult to measure, but it is safe to say that the World Cup will bring in millions of dollars to each host city. \u201cIt will change Kansas City for the next four years, and beyond,\u201d Holland told the Guardian. \u201cYou can never pay for that type of marketing exposure.\u201d Fifa will call most of the shots from here \u2013 establishing ticket prices and availability, for example. Many logistics of the most complicated tournament in sports, \u201cthe nuts and bolts,\u201d as Holland called them, will need to be worked out after the 2022 World Cup is held in Qatar. Seven of the top 10 metro areas in the US will be World Cup hosts \u2013 New York, Los Angeles, Dallas, Houston, Philadelphia, Atlanta and Miami \u2013 but Kansas City belongs, too. As Reid said, \u201cWe knew we had to differentiate ourselves.\u201d And Kansas City did. \u201cI do not worry about filling Arrowhead,\u201d Holland said. When the bid committee had to find two local celebrities to provide a video message of congratulations for the selection show, Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and Modern Family star Eric Stonestreet stepped up. (Jason Sudeikis, the Ted Lasso star, was tied up.) \u201cKansas City, we got the World Cup!\u201d Mahomes said in his message. \u201cThe city is gonna show out in 2026. We can\u2019t wait to welcome fans from across the globe to the heart of America and to the world\u2019s loudest stadium. Let\u2019s go!\u201d Nelson and Holland laughed when they told the story of hosting Fifa officials for a tour of the city and some of its facilities last October. The tour, of course, included lunch \u2013 and lunch, as it often does in Kansas City, included its world-famous barbecue, this time from Joe\u2019s. Barbecued meat is best enjoyed outside on a paper plate with beans, coleslaw and cold beer, but at this luncheon, the barbecue was served to the international visitors on china, with wine. Reflected was Kansas City\u2019s past, and its near future. \u201cIt was beautiful,\u201d Nelson said."

                    "body": "Barry Glendenning and I were on TalkSport last Sunday discussing the fact a number of Nottingham Forest fans had sung \u201cAlways the victims\u201d to Liverpool fans the day before. It doesn\u2019t feel controversial to suggest singing songs about tragedy and death is grim. But before we\u2019d broken for the ads, a number of Forest fans got in touch. Paul: \u201cIn 33 years we have gone from people being able to say any nonsense about Liverpool fans to people not being able to criticise them at all.\u201d Michael: \u201cThis won\u2019t be read but you\u2019re lying, we didn\u2019t sing anything about Hillsborough.\u201d As David Squires illustrated so beautifully this week, it really could have been them.  Another fan texted: \u201cBut what about Liverpool fans singing about Munich?\u201d Well, obviously. But whataboutery aside, is this determination to defend your team at all costs a new thing? Or are those incapable of judging their club objectively the ones who shout the loudest, now weaponised by social media? This obsession with agendas is so tiring and just another reason to question your faith in the game. What are we watching now? Clubs owned by countries where there is significant discrimination against women and homosexuality is illegal, pouring virtually infinite resources into an increasingly uneven league. A player bailed on suspicion of rape continues to play, while fans in the ground sing in unison about the tragedies where opposition fans lost their lives and those online racially abuse any non-white player who makes the slightest mistake. Unfit improper businessmen pass fit and proper persons tests to buy lower-league clubs and strip their assets. All before we focus our attention on Qatar, where thousands of migrant workers have died since Fifa awarded the country the World Cup in 2010. It\u2019s hard not to get disheartened. But even if football is destined to be run by people who don\u2019t have its best interests at heart, can we find enough kernels of hope in the gloom? This week I asked on Twitter for examples of people in the game \u2013 clubs, players, fans, whoever \u2013 doing good, however small. Thanks to those who replied about people picking up litter all the way to caring for footballers seeking political asylum. It\u2019s not exhaustive and it won\u2019t win a Pulitzer. You may find it a bit twee but here\u2019s a list in no particular order that may restore your faith for five minutes: So many people got in touch to talk about the tireless work done by the fans supporting food banks: Newcastle, Everton, Burnley to name a few. Lewes are the first gender-equal club in the world. Their midfielder Bradley Pritchard runs a community garden. Melbourne Victory have been hosting and paying for Afghanistan\u2019s women\u2019s team since the Taliban came back and they fled the country.  Witham run weekly Soccability sessions for people with additional needs to play football and socialise at no cost to them or their parents. The Bracknell chairman is buying 50 tickets from the allocation for the FA Cup game against Ipswich to give to struggling families. Norwich cancelled a betting sponsorship because of letters and complaints from fans. The Leicester owner, Khun Top, donated \u00a31m to Leicester hospitals charity neonatal unit in May. Bristol City make donations to a food bank or homeless shelter on every away trip. Sunderland have partnered with Spacehive, a local mental health charity, helping tackle some of the highest male suicide rates in the country. You may have seen Danny Ings wearing headphones walking out at Villa Park last week. He joined Riley Regan from the club\u2019s disability programme who wore ear defenders to protect him from the noise of the crowd. At the same game, Ollie Watkins went to find a young disabled Brentford fan called Woody after full time and had a penalty shootout on the pitch with him.  There were so many responses praising the work of Yasir Sufi, the integration and development manager at Blackburn, who does so much to integrate supporters from all backgrounds to the club, including hosting prayers on the pitch during Ramadan for Muslim supporters. Arsenal, Newcastle, Brentford and many other clubs give free sanitary products for women. A group of young Wigan fans helped the Canal &amp; River Trust on a litter pick on the stadium\u2019s section of the canal this week. Plymouth work with Project35 to support children living in poverty in the local community and aim to reduce that figure. Hearts\u2019 two most recent front-of-strip brandings have been with Save the Children, and now MND Scotland. The Wolves fan Manny Singh has done amazing charity work for Dementia UK over a long period: walking treks, selling family-made samosas and sponsoring local players. A Cambridge fan has created an app called Picturepath that can be used by people with autism and special needs to help them with matchdays. It\u2019s been used by several EFL clubs. Allan Saint-Maximin bought all the toys at a toy shop for kids in Newcastle. The Brighton medical team have saved seven fans\u2019 lives at the Amex. Last Tuesday, they rescued Bob, a Nottingham Forest fan, who had a heart attack just before the match. Kings Langley have partnered with Druglink and are providing volunteering opportunities for service users, education around drug use to young players and are helping to reduce the stigma attached to those in recovery. Finally, Rob Mason wrote to me. \u201cWhat Manchester City did for my son in May following the death of his 14-year-old sister in March was uplifting during the darkest of times.\u201d His son Ben has raised more than \u00a3100,000 for mental health charities since his sister took her own life. He was invited to hand the medals and trophy to the players after the game with Villa last season.  There is so much good going on all the time, so many volunteers from grassroots to the top of the game \u2013 most completely unrecognised. It made me feel better about the sport I work in for just a little bit. Max Rushden has donated the fee for this column to Shelter From the Storm, the homeless shelter he has worked at for the past decade, although he doesn\u2019t like to talk about it and finds the commute trickier these days."

                    "body": "An unprecedented demand for tickets to watch England play USA at Wembley in October led to the Football Association\u2019s website crashing on Tuesday and fans being held in queues online of more than 45,000 people. By Wednesday lunchtime, all available general admission tickets were sold out, with just hospitality options still on sale. The FA announced at 2pm that England, the newly crowned European champions, were in line to host the USA, the World Cup holders, on 7 October. It prompted a surge to buy tickets and supporters able to access the website were given an estimated wait time of more than an hour. The crashes appeared to occur only early in the rush but the long waits continued for hours.   It is the latest signal that England\u2019s win against Germany in front of more than 87,000 fans at Wembley in the Euro 2022 final on Sunday \u2013 watched by a peak TV audience of 17.4 million on the BBC \u2013 has generated greater interest than ever in the team. England and USA last met in the SheBelieves Cup in 2020 in Orlando with goals from Christen Press and Carli Lloyd earning the home team a 2-0 victory. Before that they met in the semi-final of the 2019 World Cup in France, with USA winning 2-1 and going on to lift the trophy. The Wembley friendly is subject to England qualifying next month for the 2023 World Cup which is being held in Australia and New Zealand. They are five points clear of Austria in Group D and need a point away to Austria on 3 September or a win against Luxembourg at Stoke three days later. The FA has sold more than 20,000 tickets for that first game on home soil since the win against Germany on Sunday, with more tickets to be released. Sarina Wiegman, the England manager, said: \u201cIt is really exciting to have the chance to play the US at Wembley if we can make sure of qualification for the World Cup. It would be the perfect game for our squad to meet another strong team after so many tough games in the Euros. \u201cIt is good we enjoy the moment we are in after this wonderful summer but we know we still have work to do to take the next step forward \u2026 it will be great to welcome as many fans as possible so that we can say thanks again for their incredible support.\u201d  The USA head coach, Vlatko Andonovski, said: \u201cThis is exactly the kind of match we need at exactly the right time in our World Cup preparations so we can test ourselves against a very talented England team. I saw England play live at the Euros and I\u2019m looking forward to an amazing atmosphere at Wembley and another big event for women\u2019s soccer.\u201d USA last played at Wembley in the gold medal match of the London 2012 Olympic Games, when they defeated Japan 2-1. With Euro 2022 fever not calmed down, the FA\u2019s chief executive, Mark Bullingham, quelled hopes of a bid to host a women\u2019s World Cup in the near future, with the bid for the men\u2019s European Championship in 2028 the focus. \u201cWe\u2019d love to have it in the long term,\u201d Bullingham said. \u201cBut if you think that we just had a number of games for the men\u2019s Euros, we just had the women\u2019s Euros, we\u2019re bidding for the 2028 men\u2019s Euros \u2013 that\u2019s where we\u2019re at.\u201d  Bullingham said the success of the Women\u2019s European Championhip had strengthened FA\u2019s relationship with Uefa. \u201cAll the feedback we\u2019ve had has been fantastic. The tournament\u2019s been run really well, we\u2019ve got a phenomenal tournament, they\u2019ve done everything brilliantly and we\u2019ve smashed every target. So you would hope that would put us in good stead for hosting anything else. We have a lot of goodwill in the bank anyway. But the reality is the whole tournament has gone brilliantly so it just drives that relationship even closer.\u201d The impact elsewhere in the UK is apparent with Wales experiencing a surge of interest for their women\u2019s World Cup qualifier at home against Slovenia on 6 September. Ticket sales have surpassed the record 5,455 crowd set against Estonia last October and the Football Association of Wales is targeting a 10,000 attendance."

                    "body": "For Lionel Messi the crowning glory beckons. As Argentina\u2019s gaze zeroed in on a third World Cup triumph, it was impossible to ignore their leader. It should not only be about him. There were other stars in blue and white stripes, most notably Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez. But when Messi plays like this and with the power of the narrative around him, it can surely feel that way.\nMessi was irresistible, overwhelming. He got Argentina up and running with a coolly converted penalty \u2013 his fifth goal of the tournament, taking him level with France\u2019s Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 in the race for the Golden Boot \u2013 and he was involved at the beginning of the killer second for \u00c1lvarez.\nBut Messi made sure that he provided the abiding memory, saving his jaw-dropping moment for midway through the second half to end any notion of a Croatia comeback; an assist that came from a higher plane.\n\nHe picked up the ball flush on the right flank and surged in front of Josko Gvardiol, the acceleration belying his 35 years. He slowed and went again but Gvardiol, one of the tournament\u2019s best defenders, would recover. So Messi checked, back to his opponent. He needed to find another way.\nAnd so he dropped his right shoulder and spun left, touching the ball around Gvardiol with his left boot, showing it to him, almost teasing him, but never allowing him to get close enough to it. Messi pattered to the byline and along it before pulling back for \u00c1lvarez, who did the rest. Gvardiol was powerless.\nA few numbers are relevant because they seem to track Messi\u2019s every breath. It was a record-equalling 25th World Cup appearance for him and his 11th goal in the competition was an Argentina record. His assist gave him eight in World Cups \u2013 the same as Diego Maradona. But it is what Maradona did at the 1986 tournament that Messi wants to emulate.\n\nMessi has pretty much done it all. Eleven league titles. Four Champions Leagues. The Copa Am\u00e9rica. Seven Ballons d\u2019Or. He has now scored 791 career goals, 96 of them for Argentina. A World Cup, though, is the CV gap that burns. Could it finally be his time?\nCroatia have lived on the brink, close to the exit at the group stage; fighting back to beat Japan and Brazil on penalties in the knockout rounds. The 2018 finalists have routinely gone to extra time and beyond; they never know when they are beaten. This country of 3.9 million people has defied the odds time and again . . . but not here.\nIt was Argentina\u2019s sixth World Cup semi-final and they have yet to lose one. Once \u00c1lvarez had scored his first, it came to look like an awfully big ask for Croatia and a symbol of their broken resistance came on 81 minutes when Zlatko Dalic substituted the talismanic Luka Modric. It was not his night.\n\nLionel Scaloni could conduct the delirious hoards of Argentina fans behind one of the goals after full time and the manager was able to reflect on getting his tactics right. He went with a narrow but flexible 4-4-2, in which the full-backs were encouraged to push high and wide. It provided the platform for Messi to roam, his teammates filling the gaps around him, and also to get runners in behind, particularly \u00c1lvarez. Croatia came to be stifled, their full-backs pinned back.\nIt was an uncharacteristic loose touch from Modric that Argentina seized on to blow the contest open, Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez sending \u00c1lvarez galloping away from Dejan Lovren. It was startling to see how much space \u00c1lvarez had and, although he could not finish, Lovren getting back to clear his chip, he was blocked off by the goalkeeper, Dominik Livakovic, who made no attempt to play the ball. Messi was never going to miss from the spot.\n\nCroatia had wanted a corner from their previous move when Ivan Perisic\u2019s shot seemed to deflect off an Argentina limb. They were incensed when the penalty was awarded. Mario Mandzukic, the assistant coach, was shown a red card.\nA 1-0 deficit has tended not to be a problem for Croatia. In each of their previous knockout games at this World Cup and the last they had conceded first. They would win on each occasion \u2013 apart from in the final against France. But 2-0 was more problematic.\nWhat a dreadful goal it was for Croatia to concede, caught on another quick transition after Argentina had cleared a corner. Messi got there before Marcelo Brozovic and, when \u00c1lvarez picked up possession just before halfway, he simply bulldozed through.\n\nThe decoy runs from Rodrigo De Paul and Nahuel Molina helped and, when \u00c1lvarez dropped his shoulder on the edge of the area, he got a break off Josip Juranovic. Borna Sosa could not adjust his feet, missing the attempted clearance and \u00c1lvarez relished the close-range conversion.\n\nMessi radiated menace, ever alive to the killer pass. At 2-0 he really started to enjoy himself, wowing with the adhesiveness of his touch, the savage sharpness of his turns. Argentina almost scored again before the interval, Alexis Mac Allister extending Livakovic with a free header on a corner. The rebound almost went in off Juranovic. Mac Allister would go close to a fourth for Argentina late on.\nDalic went for broke at the start of the second-half, introducing Mislav Orsic on the left and Bruno Petkovic as a second striker, switching to 4-4-2. But Croatia would create little of clear-cut note and they were vulnerable to the break. Messi almost got in when he swapped passes with Fern\u00e1ndez. The scene was set for his final sprinkling of magic."

                    "body": "Cameroon\u2019s highlight of the evening appeared to arrive before the actual game when high spirits had them sashaying down the corridor to the dressing room in vocal form. From here their night nosedived until the 92nd minute when a beauty of a header from Vincent Aboubakar made history as the Indomitable Lions claimed a first win over Brazil.\nIt was followed by the captain ripping off his shirt in jubilation and being sent off for a second yellow card for the offence and, with Switzerland taking three points in their showdown with Serbia, Rigobert Song\u2019s side were knocked out.\nA regretful coach said: \u201cMy players should be congratulated. They have shown that they should have done better in the two games before this. We gradually improved and it\u2019s a real shame that we are going home now. I trust in my players and they delivered.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the tournament Song had the distraction of a fallout with Andr\u00e9 Onana which presaged him sending his No 1 goalkeeper home. \u201cThere were some problems at the start which were resolved very quickly. The team always takes priority over the individual. We play elite football we need discipline and that is where we have let ourselves down in the past,\u201d he said.\nBrazil, then, end as Group G victors \u2013 on goal difference only - and face South Korea next but this was a first ever reverse to any nation from the same continent as Cameroon. Tite said: \u201cIt will be before me \u2013 we lost \u2013 the first Brazilian coach to lose to an African team, we will have to suffer 24 hours and then we have to start preparing. We feel the loss, and we must feel the loss when we lose. We have to feel it \u2013 it is part of the context.\n\u201cWho lost? All of us. Our preparation is joint, our wins are joint, our losses are joint. This competition gives us something to think about \u2013 it\u2019s food for thought. There\u2019s short time to recover between matches.\u201d\nAfter Brazil posted a video of Neymar training, he offered an injury update. \u201cRegarding Neymar and Alex Sandro\u2013 we have time on our behalf, we have possibilities and let\u2019s wait to see. They\u2019re not yet training with a ball, so we need to observe them there and see how they do.\n\u201cDanilo has been evolving positively \u2013 he did intense work with the ball and has adapted functionally positively and he should be able to train normally with the players.\nWhile only Fred and \u00c9der Milit\u00e3o were retained from victory over Switzerland, the headline fresh name was Dani Alves, who at 39 added winning cap No 125 (drawing level with Roberto Carlos as Brazil\u2019s second highest appearance maker) and becoming his nation\u2019s oldest World Cup captain to the CV of one of the great careers.\n\nA booking for Pierre Kunde for clipping Rodrygo, whose after-burners zipped along a diagonal, was Cameroon\u2019s issue in a nutshell: hurtling at them were pace, trickery, invention, and directness. And so it was that a wheezing Collins Fai was the next to see Ismail Elfath\u2019s yellow card waved at him, the referee chuckling mildly at the right-back\u2019s protestations. The foul, once more, was on Rodrygo, Alves\u2019s free-kick poor, but Brazil\u2019s one-way traffic was veering into roadblock territory as Cameroon were trapped at every turn.\nMissing from all this ball-hogging act was a Brazil goal. Possession was at 68.4% for them but Tite\u2019s close-to-second string lacked, thus far, cool execution near the posts. Cameroon would love to have this problem. As the interval beckoned an Aboubakar dink into the area that Ederson cleaned up was being written up as one of the very few moments they were allowed close to the Brazil No 1. But, then, in virtually the last play of the half they gave Brazil a fright.\n\nThe ball was chipped in from the left from Moumi Ngamaleu and Bryan Mbeumo\u2019s header went into the turf first and skidded up enough for Ederson to have to fly right to prevent the goal.\nBefore, Gabriel Martinelli had skipped along the Cameroon area from the left and blazed at Devis Epassy\u2019s goal, the keeper, impressively, saving at a high angle but when the sides reassembled after the break Cameroon still had the chance of the win required to have any chance of last-16 football.\nThe claiming of a corner by Mbuemo off Bremer was the best way to commence what they hoped would not be their last 45 minutes of Qatar 2022. No dividend was yielded from the kick, though.\nBrazil had become complacent, Fred\u2019s mis-control in the centre circle indicative and yet on view was one team fine-tuning their reserves for the battles ahead and the other hoping to dodge oblivion via the miracle of a win and Switzerland giving up their lead. The latter did not happen but the former did. It was not enough for Cameroon but they now have a victory to rank alongside their victory over Argentina at the 1990 edition of the championships.\nSong offered an optimistic note. \u201cThis is only the beginning,\u201d he said."

                    "body": "Good morning. It\u2019s a simple enough proposition: ask people to show photo ID if they want to vote. The government says that a new law coming into effect next year will ensure the integrity of elections, and reinforce public trust in British democracy. But others say the reality is a lot more complicated than that. The strongest critics of the Elections Act argue that, far from being an attempt to secure the voting system, it is a \u201cshameless voter-suppression bill\u201d \u2013 and, given there was only one conviction for voter impersonation at the 2017 election, totally unnecessary in any case. But even those who take a more neutral view see plenty to worry about. A new report from the Constitution Society sketches out a troubling picture of chaos at local councils as they attempt to adjust to the new rules \u2013 and, its author Dr John Ault says, there are \u201cdeep concerns over the deliverability of the new policy\u201d as a result. For today\u2019s newsletter, I spoke to Ault about why this purported solution to concerns about voter fraud looks as if it may create a whole set of new problems instead.  That\u2019s after the headlines \u2013 and scroll down to the World Cup section for everything you need on England v Wales to bask in the glory/nurse your sorrows as appropriate. Five big stories  Health | Researchers have hailed a new era of Alzheimer\u2019s therapies after a clinical trial confirmed that a drug slows cognitive decline in patients with early stages of the disease. Read Ian Sample\u2019s recent feature on why lecanemab could lead to drugs that offer better and better control of Alzheimer\u2019s. Census | Census results revealing that England is no longer a majority-Christian country have sparked calls for an end to the church\u2019s role in parliament and schools, while Leicester and Birmingham became the first UK cities with \u201cminority majorities\u201d. Local government | A Tory-led council has admitted a series of disastrous investments caused it to run up an unprecedented deficit of nearly \u00a3500m and brought it to the brink of bankruptcy. Thurrock has appealed to the government for an emergency bailout and warned that it will have to push through a drastic programme of cuts. Channel crossings | A man has been arrested in the UK in connection with the deaths of at least 27 people who drowned while trying to cross the Channel in a dinghy a year ago. Harem Ahmed Abwbaker, 32, is accused of being a member of an organised crime gang behind the disastrous crossing in November 2021. China | China has sent university students home as part of an attempt to disperse protesters angry at zero-Covid policies, as the country\u2019s top security body called for a crackdown on \u201chostile forces\u201d. Authorities also announced plans to step up vaccination of older people.  In depth: \u2018We will be seeing voters turned away\u2019  Starting next year, British voters will be asked to bring photographic identification to the polls. Next May\u2019s local elections will be the first large-scale test of how the changes will work \u2013 and Dr John Ault thinks there may be trouble ahead. When Ault warns about potential problems with your electoral system, you should probably listen: the executive director of the non-partisan NGO Democracy Volunteers and a consultant on electoral reform, he has observed elections from Kazakhstan to Finland. \u201cI speak to election officials all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m conscious there\u2019s a gap in the discussion about the changes that are coming in the UK.\u201d With that in mind, he asked councils across the UK about how they were preparing for the new regime, and got responses from 70 of them. The title of his report suggests the message he heard: \u201cAn accident waiting to happen?\u201d *** Why councils might struggle with the new regime Leave aside, for now, fears about disproportionate impacts on younger, poorer voters. Ault\u2019s worry is more straightforward: are councils ready for the task ahead? The issues, according to his report: \u201cHow will polling stations change? \u2026 Will extra training be needed for staff to ensure they have knowledge of the required ID and how to identify voters based on their ID? Will extra staff be needed to deal with the introduction of voter ID?\u201d His survey of councils did not produce reassuring results. Forty-five percent of councils were not confident they could train staff on the new requirements in the time available, while 86% were not confident they would be ready to run the elections in general. Every single respondent said their jobs would be more difficult as a result. No information has been provided about additional funding, and over the last five years election funding has risen 40% below inflation. \u201cNobody has thought about the impact on election teams in local councils,\u201d Ault said. \u201cSome of them are as small as two or three people. They\u2019ve got to go from an arrangement that has bedded in over 150 years to one where they have to check ID for every voter.\u201d They also have to collect the information needed for \u201cvoter cards\u201d \u2013 not actually a card, but a securely printed piece of paper sent to the voter \u2013 for those who lack ID, a process which research by Plymouth council estimates will take eight minutes each time. That might not sound like much, but when multiplied up by hundreds or thousands in an area with very limited staffing, it is a serious new workload. \u201cIgnoring whether it\u2019s a good, bad or indifferent plan, it is undeniably a massive administrative test,\u201d Ault said. How many voters will actually ask for the \u201cvoter cards\u201d? Nobody knows. While only 2% may actually require one, Ault says: \u201cI suspect a lot of people will hear about the voter card vaguely and the applications will be much bigger than that. It\u2019s a big ask. Local administrators see this wave coming towards them, and they\u2019re the ones who have to deal with it. They only have so many hours in a day to do so.\u201d *** What that will mean for who votes and how \u201cIt\u2019ll probably create an awful lot of outputs we haven\u2019t really considered,\u201d Ault said. \u201cLet\u2019s say a canvasser knocks on a door, and the person says, \u2018I don\u2019t have ID\u2019 \u2013 they might advise them to get a postal vote instead. Well, that drives people into a much less managed form of voting \u2013 at home, who knows who can affect your decision?\u201d Nor will the issue be a one-off: it seems unlikely that most people will keep a printed sheet of paper from one election to the next, meaning that many will simply reapply each time. \u201cThere could be millions applying for these for a general election,\u201d Ault said. Not all of the country will vote in next May\u2019s elections, with Scotland, Wales and London among areas not involved. While it is plainly preferable to test the new system with a smaller number of voters, it also means that there will be no practice run in many areas before a general election. And even next year, the consequences may not just be bother for overworked officials: \u201cThe greatest concern is that voters who have every right to vote may, through no fault of their own, be excluded from voting,\u201d Auld writes in the report. \u201cWe\u2019ll be going to polling stations to identify challenges this is creating,\u201d he said. \u201cI suspect we will be seeing people turned away.\u201d *** Other concerns about the new law Auld\u2019s report does not address the government\u2019s underlying motives for the changes \u2013 but others are sceptical that they are being carried out in good faith. The Electoral Reform Society warns that younger people are less likely to hold the forms of ID listed as acceptable and points out the curious fact that 60+ London Oyster photocards are allowed, but the 18+ Student Oyster card is not. It estimates that around 2.1 million people lack the necessary ID to vote under the new law were a general election to be held now \u2013 and in all likelihood the requirements will be in place before MPs next face the public on anything more rigorous than an ITV reality show. The House of Lords passed an amendment that would have allowed student IDs, library cards and other widely available forms of ID to be accepted \u2013 only for the change to be struck out by the government\u2019s majority in the House of Commons. Opposition parties argue that the changes will suppress turnout among disadvantaged groups, and Cabinet Office research suggests that 42% of those without photo ID would be unlikely to apply. Naomi Smith, chief executive of campaign group Best for Britain, says that the plan is \u201ca naked attempt by the Government to use a nonexistent problem to suppress voters more likely to vote against them\u201d. The government dismisses these claims, and says that \u201cwe cannot be complacent when it comes to ensuring our democracy remains secure\u201d. But while Auld does not give a view on the underlying motives, he does say: \u201cMy instinct is that they haven\u2019t quite squared the circle about what happens if somebody is less engaged with society and less likely to vote. There may be unintended consequences.\u201d What else we\u2019ve been reading   Tech companies such as Google have long profited from monetising the data of users. Storing this personal information has had wide-ranging repercussions, particularly when it comes to law enforcement.

For more than five decades, Best dedicated her life to improving the lives and civil rights of Black people in Britain.

Best was instrumental in overturning Britain\u2019s infamous \u201cSus laws\u201d, which gave police the power to disproportionately and often arbitrarily target young Black people. Over the next three decades Best started many initiatives to help with education and housing as well as pushing other grassroots organisations that campaigned against police brutality.

                    "body": "Edinson Cavani is miles away. He has played in five countries, at some of the biggest clubs in the biggest leagues, alongside the biggest stars; he is about to represent Uruguay at his 10th international tournament; and he has racked up 785 games, scored 434 goals and won 26 trophies, but he cannot help being drawn to somewhere else entirely. Back to where it began, far from the training centre where he sits now, a necessary escape. \u201cName all those places, and I say: \u2018No, leave me in Salto,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBeneath a tree, in the shade, where the breeze blows, without the sound of cars.\u201d\nCavani talks about the game as a \u201cpassion\u201d inherited from his father, a forward who played against Luis Su\u00e1rez\u2019s dad in Salto where the two Uruguay strikers were born three weeks apart. He discusses dedication, the competitiveness running through him, and the striker\u2019s art, dissected in detail and distilled in a line: \u201cFootball is time and space.\u201d There is a wonder at some of the things he did but still cannot explain and he describes a month at the World Cup as a joy \u201cwhere you feel totally connected to football, where you live it, every second\u201d.\n\nYet there is something unusual about him; something that, it soon becomes clear as he chats in a gentle, pensive voice, does not entirely fit in football \u2013 not the way he believes the game has become. At times there is something almost philosophical, vaguely mystical about him, a lingering feeling that the world he inhabits is not really for him, much he would gladly leave behind.\n\u201cThere are things I see and feel in football that \u2013 how can I say this? \u2013 I totally reject.\u201d And asked whether he feels different, he pauses to think, which he does often, and replies softly: \u201cAtypical, maybe.\nThese days, success tends to be linked to fame, high life, luxury. And honestly, I do have my good life too, opportunities football gives me. But my way of life is very simple. Why do I like nature so much? I may never find the answer, but there\u2019s something inside that takes me there, away from this world, this routine, this dynamic that\u2019s so overwhelming. The only thing football doesn\u2019t allow me is to be where I like more often, out in the countryside.\u201d\nCavani fondly recalls matches, goals he has scored \u2013 the description of his first in Europe, paper and pad in hand, takes 10 minutes alone \u2013 but also visits to Monet\u2019s house north\u2011west of Paris, pheasants in the countryside there, pine trees outside Naples, the lake by his Knutsford home, the daily drive to Carrington past green fields, a moment of calm savoured each morning. \u201cI like all that is wild. Just walk, drink mate, see the green, the water. That produces pleasure in me. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a need, but it\u2019s a way of life, good for you.\u201d\n\nA kind of therapy, perhaps \u2013 and that goes deeper. \u201cThere have been moments when I\u2019ve needed professional help,\u201d the 35\u2011year\u2011old says. \u201cI have friends who are professionals, and we go down a route that\u2019s more spiritual than psychological. Just talking sustains you. I talk to the psychologist about things that aren\u2019t football. We all hang on football and have little time to focus outside. Often a trauma begins with football but the psychologist helps you see it doesn\u2019t come from football alone; it can be your upbringing, parents, environment, the way you think you are because from very young you thought this was the only way to live, trying to be a footballer, a superhero.\n\u201cThere\u2019s much you learn over time in football. It\u2019s 20 years since I left home, trying to overcome. You reflect, reach conclusions. Which doesn\u2019t mean what I say is the truth and I don\u2019t share it assuming it\u2019s right. But it\u2019s my way of confronting life. If there was a little book \u2018this is happiness\u2019, we\u2019d all go out, buy it and live that way, the same way.\u201d\n\nFor Cavani, happiness is raising cattle, working the land, fishing, walking, getting lost. It\u2019s not that he might have been a vet had he not been a footballer; it is that he plans to be one when he is no longer playing, studying for the day he goes back. The contrast to the industry he has been in, especially at clubs such as Paris Saint\u2011Germain, alongside players such as Neymar or Cristiano Ronaldo, entire industries whose status goes well beyond the game, could hardly be greater. Which may be part of the reason he is ready to return.\nWhich may also be, he suggests, one of the reasons why Uruguay overachieve, how a country of 3.5 million arrives in Qatar \u2013 \u201cnot much green there,\u201d Cavani says with a smile \u2013 believing the objective is to win.\n\u201cWhy are we so competitive? Because they teach us to be,\u201d Cavani says. \u201cBecause pitches exist, everywhere. In every neighbourhood, every place, however deprived. Wherever there\u2019s space to kick a ball, there\u2019s a game. That competitiveness demanded as a professional is already there: you\u2019ve been doing it all your life, every day, in the rain, any surface, playing barefoot, breaking a toe, wrapping it up and carrying on. I always say that in football it\u2019s not the same to play as to compete.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve kept that essence. Look at modern football, which is losing that essence. Maybe I come from that old school. Maybe I don\u2019t fully fit with modern football, in terms of attitudes, what it means to players. That doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t say how you feel, does it? I see it constantly: modernism, social media, how the world is, how technology has advanced, got into football. That changes mentalities. Before, everyone in a team had the same objective. These days, in certain teams for various reasons \u2013 fame, what people and press make players feel \u2013 that\u2019s not always the case.\u201d\nThere is something in Cavani\u2019s tone that expresses loss, a sense of disappointment, hurt. \u201cMaybe so, yeah. True. Because I come from a school where the loveliest thing that can happen is to win as a team. For me there\u2019s no player who makes you win a World Cup on his own. He doesn\u2019t exist and never will. Someone can do something magical but you need teammates running, putting their life on the line. That\u2019s too often forgotten. Instead, it\u2019s all on the goalscorer, the famous name, the Ballon d\u2019Or. That takes focus from what really matters, so that what a team wants to achieve becomes deformed, distorted. You feel that, you experience it. I\u2019ve lived it.\u201d\nLearned from it, too. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve never had any desire for fame nor to be the best but my best, I\u2019ve analysed teammates and, look,\u201d he says, pausing. \u201cBecause the most famous players get highlighted more and sometimes feel the need to demonstrate that \u2026\u201d There is another pause. \u201cWhen I\u2019ve analysed, I\u2019ve seen negative things that helped me learn and positive things I\u2019ve followed. Everyone has their own personality, you respect that, but there are things I don\u2019t want to ever have in my life, that I reject completely. That\u2019s my reflection.\u201d\nThe way he tells it Uruguay, like the countryside, is a refuge; a way of reconnecting with what was left behind. \u201cA lot is about humility. Here, the player knows you have to be humble, step down from certain pedestals. These days, everything takes us to a place where the player is egotistical, because he\u2019s thinking about the awards, about \u2026\u201d Cavani pauses. \u201cHe leaves aside things that are nicer. If one day I got an individual award I\u2019d be happy, sure, because it underlines your work, but it wouldn\u2019t change my life because the greatest happiness is a photo of my team at home.\u201d\nHow then do Uruguay avoid that trap, the arrogance, the selfishness? How does that not shift with the emergence of a new generation? \u201cYou know what it is?\u201d Cavani replies. \u201cIt\u2019s that in our national team, like in our country, people like that are not looked upon kindly. It could be a cultural thing. That idea, that identity, is so clear from youth level that it\u2019s already inculcated in Uruguayan players and hopefully will never be lost. That culture of work, sacrifice, unity which has seen us beat great national teams. It\u2019s not Su\u00e1rez or Cavani or this guy or that, no. It\u2019s Uruguay. The objective is to win. And we\u2019re conscious that none of us will ever win anything on our own.\n\n\u201cAll of us play at a high level but when you\u2019re in the national team you realise that the essence of football is still there,\u201d Cavani says, something almost wistful in his voice. \u201cIt\u2019s well-known names, stars at big clubs, yet you feel that solidarity, what football really is. I like to sweat my team\u2019s shirt. Sometimes you lose but I want to know my team gave itself entirely. When you win that way, you enjoy it twice as much. That\u2019s my philosophy of life and football. Earn it. Anything that comes easy never has the same feeling; he who simply receives never appreciates it the way he would when it costs, when there\u2019s sacrifice.\n\u201cOne of the things I\u2019ve learned about myself through football is there\u2019s always a reason. When you work towards an objective, incredible things can happen. Coldly, sometimes, you can\u2019t understand it, can\u2019t grasp it, but if you pursued it, it can happen.\n\u201cThe peace I need to approach football, what you see as pressure, is the knowledge that I respected my teammates, held nothing back. Fear grabs you sometimes but if you know you\u2019re giving everything \u2013 really giving it, not just lip\u2011service \u2013 that lifts the pressure from you. You have nerves before a game, before a World Cup, but that shows you\u2019re alive, ready. The day I don\u2019t have that, I\u2019ll leave. People confuse that, they get it wrong: a little fear is good. And then, once you step out there, it\u2019s gone.\u201d"

                    "body": "Jordan Henderson cannot help it. Put simply, it is a part of what makes him who he is. The Liverpool and England midfielder feels the setbacks way more keenly than the triumphs; he holds on to them so tightly that they never truly leave him.\n\u201cThe defeats always stay,\u201d Henderson says. \u201cI can remember them more than the wins. They hurt the most. That\u2019s the part where you want to change things and put them right but you never get rid of that feeling.\u201d\nHenderson is acknowledging two specific losses \u2013 the first with Liverpool in the 2018 Champions League final to Real Madrid; the other with England in the Euro 2020 final to Italy on penalties. But there are others. Liverpool narrowly missing out on the Premier League title to Manchester City in 2018-19, despite finishing with 97 points. The second Champions League final defeat to Real last season.\n\nIn his recently released autobiography, Henderson rakes over another grave \u2013 his penalty shootout miss against Colombia at the 2018 World Cup. He describes the moment in vivid detail, how he felt his world collapse, his mind overrun by negativity.\n\u201cAll I was thinking was: \u2018I\u2019ll never go back to England \u2013 that\u2019s it,\u2019\u201d Henderson writes. \u201cMy England career? Over. Life as it exists? Over. How could I go back? I\u2019d let the whole nation down.\u201d\nFortunately for Henderson, England would come back to win the last-16 shootout but what he did next was revealing. After a recovery session the following day, he stayed out alone to practise penalties, obsessively, to the point where the assistant manager, Steve Holland, had to yell at him to get inside.\nThere was almost a horrible sting. When Henderson woke the next day, he felt a tightness in his groin. He had injured himself taking penalties. Fortunately, the damage was not serious enough to rule him out of the quarter-final or semi-final.\nThe story shines a light on Henderson\u2019s mentality. Fall short, dig deeper, be better prepared. It feels as if the 32-year-old has always been questioned. The other day, his Liverpool and England teammate Trent Alexander-Arnold called him \u201ccriminally underrated\u201d. How does Henderson feel about that? \u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d he replies. \u201cI\u2019ve been asked this throughout my career.\u201d\n\nWhat Henderson does is he overcomes. After the first Champions League final defeat, he returned to the showpiece the following season and led his team to victory over Tottenham. After the near miss in the title race in 2018-19, he and Liverpool won the thing the next season. And now here he is, at a third World Cup and sixth major tournament for England seeking to go one better than at the last European Championship.\n\u201cI suppose you could see similarities [to Liverpool] in terms of getting so close and just failing at the last bit until we ended up winning,\u201d Henderson says. \u201cI don\u2019t like to make comparisons with other teams, and especially club football, but I do feel like when you go through experiences together, especially good ones, but at the end you don\u2019t get what you want, that can make you really stronger as a team.\n\n\u201cI keep my runners-up medals. Not many players get to cup finals so I\u2019ll always respect the process of getting there. But when you just miss out on your dream then it can hurt a lot and that is what drives you to get better.\u201d\nFirst things first: Senegal. There is definitely a view in England that the team will beat the reigning African champions on Sunday and play a quarter-final against France, particularly as Henderson\u2019s former Liverpool teammate Sadio Man\u00e9 is out injured for Senegal.\nIt is absolutely not the view within the England camp. Henderson was a part of the squad at Euro 2016 when Iceland were supposed to be brushed aside in the last 16 en route to a quarter-final meeting with France. Everybody knows how that worked out. But the Iceland debacle is not why Henderson dismisses the threat of complacency. It is because of his laser-like focus, his battle-hardened realism.\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be a danger for us as a team,\u201d Henderson says. \u201cWe can say they are missing Sadio Man\u00e9 but they got into the knockout stages without him and they will be feeling confident. They are used to winning. We have just got to keep focused on what needs doing, not get too carried away, not look too far ahead.\u201d\n\nHenderson says that a sixth tournament appearance makes him feel \u201ca little bit old\u201d. Only three England players have previously done six on the spin \u2013 Sol Campbell, Wayne Rooney and Steven Gerrard. But Henderson\u2019s energy, as much as anything else, was the standout feature of his performance against Wales in the final group tie when he won his 72nd cap.\nWill he start against Senegal? Or will it be Mason Mount? Gareth Southgate\u2019s decision will shape the dynamics of the midfield and the manager knows what he can expect from Henderson. Selflessness, experience and relentless hard work.\n\u201cI try to cover a lot of ground,\u201d Henderson says. \u201cHigh-intensity runs to put pressure on the ball and runs off the ball when we\u2019re trying to get in behind or get on the ball. I try to inject a bit of intensity.\u201d\nOne final thought. Would Henderson volunteer if it went to penalties? He does not miss a beat. \u201cAlways,\u201d he replies."

                    "body": "All sports are furiously plotting how to exploit the success of the Lionesses\u2019 Euro 2022 triumph but when you drill down to the details, perhaps there is none better placed to ride the wave \u2013 with the exception of football, naturally \u2013 than rugby league. After all, this is a sport that has made its own remarkable strides in recent years when it comes to the growth of its women\u2019s game. The foundation of the Women\u2019s Super League in 2017 enabled rugby league\u2019s best female players to move into the spotlight via affiliations with clubs such as Leeds and St Helens. Crowds are on the up, double-headers alongside men\u2019s Super League matches are frequently televised, and there is boundless optimism about the future of the domestic game.  But the real key for women\u2019s rugby league comes in the shape of this year\u2019s World Cup, which like the women\u2019s Euros is being staged in England: a chance to replicate what the Lionesses have achieved by winning a major tournament on home soil. \u201cWe want to emulate exactly what they\u2019ve done, win a tournament and do it in the style they did, entertaining people,\u201d says the Leeds and England half-back Courtney Winfield-Hill. \u201cWomen\u2019s rugby league has an enormous opportunity to build on the Lionesses.\u201d The Australian-born Winfield-Hill has been at the coalface of a surge in women\u2019s sport before. She was part of the inaugural women\u2019s Big Bash cricket competition before switching to rugby league, moving to England and joining Leeds when the WSL was launched. Success in a World Cup shown on terrestrial television could catapult Winfield-Hill, Emily Rudge and Jodie Cunningham into the mainstream. \u201cWhen the girls that came before me were playing in fields with nobody watching, this was probably the furthest thing from their minds,\u201d Winfield-Hill says. \u201cBut it\u2019s up to us to take advantage of what\u2019s happened with the Lionesses. They\u2019ve made people stand up and talk about women\u2019s sport. It\u2019s probably helped put other sports like ours into the conversation. I\u2019m not a football fan really but even I was taking notice. It made everyone think about women\u2019s sport.\u201d  World Cup organisers are waiting to see if there is a surge in ticket sales this autumn but the early signs are good. England\u2019s group opener against Brazil on 1 November is on course to break the UK record for a standalone game of women\u2019s rugby in either code, while several Super League clubs have reported increased interest from supporters in the remainder of the WSL season. The Rugby Football League is privately plotting how to build on the Lionesses\u2019 success, too. It has launched the InspiredBy programme, partly aimed at getting more girls and women involved in rugby league and building on the success of the Lionesses and the Commonwealth Games. Post-World Cup, the game has planned a series of initiatives to capitalise on any success, too. That includes the England players delivering sessions in local communities to allow young girls who have hopefully been inspired by the World Cup to meet their role models and generate extra buzz around the sport. But the real goal for the women\u2019s game is being in a position to allow its players to go full time, a dream that could take a step closer to becoming a reality with World Cup success on home soil.  \u201cI do think we\u2019re still a long way away from that,\u201d Winfield-Hill says. \u201cThere\u2019s some brilliant work going in on the ground at domestic level, and internationally we\u2019re very strong and capable of competing with anyone. But the consistency across the board in the WSL isn\u2019t quite there between the best-resourced and least-resourced club. More central funding from our sporting bodies is what we need, really. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it work successfully with cricket in Australia. The more bodies and authorities you get investing in a game, the closer you\u2019ll get to full-time players. We do need more of that in rugby league, but hopefully the Lionesses have shown the world women\u2019s sport is worth investing in. It\u2019s now up to us as players to follow that in the World Cup. Winning it would be a huge silver bullet for our growth.\u201d The Lionesses have clearly shown how women\u2019s sport can reach heights nobody felt possible as recently as a few years ago. Rugby league has significantly more obstacles to clear when it comes to funding and mainstream attention, but it is clear now that success on home soil for an England team changes the landscape for a sport like nothing else. The platform has been laid: it is now up to the women\u2019s game to deliver."

                    "body": "The two ends of Herbie Farnworth\u2019s story to this point could not be more different. Before earning an England call-up on Friday for the World Cup he made his name in Australia with the NRL\u2019s Brisbane Broncos having left home at 17 to pursue his dream. That home? The small Lancashire parish of Blacko, where about 700 people live and, in Farnworth\u2019s words, \u201ceveryone knows everyone\u201d. The modest, roughly cut fields there are where the 22-year-old not only learned to play the game but trained with his uncle as recently as this week in preparation for his England debut. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long journey,\u201d says Farnworth of his unconventional path.  That journey seems even more unorthodox when you learn that Farnworth was in the youth setup at Manchester United and Burnley and was even given a guided tour by Manchester City. \u201cThey gave me a couple pairs of really cool Nike boots,\u201d he says, laughing. But Farnworth\u2019s mind had already been made up: he wanted to play rugby league, not football, and after excelling for Wigan St Patricks was courted by Wigan Warriors. However, Farnworth and his uncle, the former Wigan scout Brian Foley, had a different plan. At the age of 14, they flew to Australia for six weeks to test Farnworth against the world\u2019s best juniors. The talent scouts who spotted him were stunned to learn he was English. \u201cI knew from a young age I had to get out there if I wanted to be the best, I had to train with the best,\u201d he says. Brisbane eventually secured Farnworth\u2019s signature and at the age of 17 he left Blacko and his family behind for Queensland. \u201cThe move there was horrible,\u201d he says. \u201cI remember my last day over here. I went for a curry with my mates. I walked to the bus stop after and started crying. I\u2019d just turned 17 and it sunk in: I was leaving all my family and my close friends. It didn\u2019t feel like the right thing to do. \u201cThe first six months there was a killer, but I knew I couldn\u2019t quit. We were staying in a little shoebox with not much money. But I couldn\u2019t live with myself if I quit or if I rung my parents asking for \u00a32,000 for a flight home. I stuck at it. After that, I was all sweet.\u201d  After progressing through the junior ranks at Brisbane, Farnworth made his NRL debut in 2019. The centre has become a mainstay of the Broncos side and it has felt for some time that an England debut was an inevitability. An injury that ruled him out of the second half of this season threw some doubt on whether that moment would arrive at the World Cup. But Farnworth has been declared fit and it is clear that he has not forgotten his roots. \u201cI\u2019ve been training on the local fields in Blacko since I got back actually with my uncle Brian,\u201d he says, smiling. \u201cWhen it was too cold for my junior teams to train we\u2019d run up and down under the bridges in Blacko because there was no snow there. And now I\u2019m back training there ahead of an England debut. \u201cBut I love it there, it\u2019s a little quiet village where everyone knows everyone. I think the average age of the residents is something like 60 and I guess Blacko and Brisbane couldn\u2019t be more different.\u201d The wine bar, which is owned by Farnworth\u2019s brother, in the neighbouring village of Barrowford, will be one of several venues in the area watching on with pride if the 22-year-old \u2013 one of six debutants in Shaun Wane\u2019s England squad \u2013 is picked for the World Cup opener against Samoa on 15 October at St James\u2019 Park. Before that the host nation face Fij in a warm-up fixture at the AJ Bell Stadium on Friday. For some of Farnworth\u2019s family, it will be their first chance to see him play live. \u201cIt was so cool to be able to tell my family I was in the squad,\u201d he says. \u201cShaun rang me and told me I was in and to be able to inform everyone was so special. \u201cEveryone still lives in the family home where I grew up. Not too much has changed since I last came over or even from when I left. I absolutely love going back and I like that nothing changes because if it does, you feel like you miss out. \u201cI\u2019ve not seen some of my family for two years, so it\u2019s cool to see them and get the chance to play in front of them. \u201cIt\u2019s always been a dream of mine to play for England. I just can\u2019t wait to get out there on the pitch. I never really took the whole football thing seriously. Once I started playing rugby league, I knew I loved it and I wanted to play all the time. \u201cIt\u2019s snowballed from there really quickly. It gives me goosebumps thinking about what it\u2019ll be like playing in that first game.\u201d"

                    "body": "After one minute of Manchester United\u2019s game against Liverpool in August, you knew: Lisandro Mart\u00ednez is for real. Because that was when he clattered, then barged through Mohamed Salah for no apparent reason and no obvious gain. English football\u2019s frequently toxic and forever self-mythologising rhetoric tells us this is just how big men behave. But reality is different: save, perhaps, an airport, there\u2019s nowhere safer to start a row than on a Premier League pitch, because the chances of reprisals are almost zero. Consider, for example, Martin Keown and Ruud van Nistelrooy: jumping on someone from behind works well in football\u2019s posturing pantomime, but in a square go the sensible money would be on the martial artist able to exercise self-control because he knows there\u2019s no serious threat.  So, while Mart\u00ednez getting involved with an amused, bemused Salah taught us nothing of his physical prowess, it said plenty about his mental impregnability. He had endured a disastrous start to his career in England, playing poorly as United lost to Brighton in August before being subbed at half-time against Brentford with his team 4-0 down. After that game, Jamie Carragher, a respected judge and with good reason, left no room for doubt: Mart\u00ednez was too small to cope with the physical aspect of \u2013 depending on your sensibility \u2013 \u201cthis league\u201d or \u201cour league\u201d. In such context, for Mart\u00ednez to do what he did to a player as brilliant as Salah speaks volumes, because the potential for swift, humiliating revenge was significant. Which is to say his aggression is neither performative nor contingent, just as his confidence isn\u2019t frail or manufactured; rather, he does whatever he deems necessary regardless of any external factors that may sway others.  Something similar then happened last month, when United met Villa in a league and Carabao Cup double-header. After the first game, Leon Bailey was so perturbed by Mart\u00ednez\u2019s combative style that he used Twitter to voice his displeasure, despite having scored a fine goal in a fine win for his side. \u201cVery disappointed in the referees today. I couldn\u2019t breathe for a second after getting elbowed twice in my rib,\u201d he said. \u201cThe linesman went on to say I shouldn\u2019t be saying anything because I was doing just the same thing to Mart\u00ednez. Sometimes I don\u2019t understand why we got VAR. SMH.\u201d Four days later, United met Villa again and Bailey, still smarting, found time to go at Mart\u00ednez \u2013 who did not come on until the 87th minute \u2013 at the first available opportunity, hanging in a tackle for the afters. Then, after losing a grapple that left him on the floor, he lost the run of himself, pushing and kicking out. But there was no retaliation, Mart\u00ednez looking down at him with a dead-eyed mixture of ambivalence and contempt because though a battle with him is demanding and fierce, it is controlled not emotional, practical not personal, and solely about the game, which was in effect over. Indisputably, Mart\u00ednez\u2019s bellicosity works well for him: since that Liverpool game, he has been almost uniformly sensational. It is rare enough to see a centre-back who teams hostility, agility, composure, intelligence and technique, but to see one do it at the age of 24, while also being fun to watch, is especially unusual. Against Liverpool, United\u2019s first goal came about because Mart\u00ednez, receiving the ball 35 yards from goal, opted to punch an immediate and authoritative pass \u2013 what we might call a Roy Keane pass \u2013 into feet, when others would have taken a touch then gone backwards or sideways. His ability on the ball also gives opponents problems when they press him high, because they must simultaneously cover the straight pass and the big switch out wide, without selling themselves, so that he can stroll past them and create an overload in midfield.  As with the physical stuff, none of the skilful stuff means anything without the mentality to underpin it. Its lack has defined the Post-Fergie Wilderness Years just as much as a lack of quality. What marks out the players signed by Erik ten Hag is their willingness to assume responsibility, showing the nous to assess situations wisely, the imagination to try things and the moxie to act decisively. Like many Argentinian defenders, Mart\u00ednez was, it seems, born with an internal GPS system telling him the precise whereabouts of the line at all times, from which he never strays far. Generally eschewing the kind of attention-seeking violence that can hurt people, his desire to get close to an opponent allows him to tangle bodies and legs, creating reasonable doubt in the minds of officials that red cards are yellow cards, that yellow cards are free-kicks and free-kicks are comings together. Nor has his height yet been an impediment. Most teams don\u2019t play two big men up front \u2013 many don\u2019t play even one \u2013 nor do they hit long, aerial balls. But even so, those who doubted Mart\u00ednez\u2019s ability to handle the fearsome might of Chris Wood, Ch\u00e9 Adams and their ilk would have done well to listen to Ten Hag, who did not say much but said enough: \u201cHe has good timing.\u201d Nevertheless, there is more to it than that. Timing means little without intensity and Mart\u00ednez contests aerial challenges like a piranha on a trampoline whether winning the ball, making a block or doing just enough.  This spirit is contagious. Alongside Mart\u00ednez, Victor Lindel\u00f6f and Rapha\u00ebl Varane are more aggressive; behind him, David de Gea now comes for crosses and passes the ball out. But perhaps the biggest change has been in the man to his left. Growing up, Luke Shaw stood out at every level, his talent so immense that his easygoing attitude didn\u2019t really hinder him until he reached elite level. He did, under Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, finally establish himself as an automatic choice just when his time at Old Trafford looked up, only to drop off again post-Euros. As such, it was less surprising he lost his place to Tyrell Malacia than it was when he regained it and retained it, then volunteered to fill in for Mart\u00ednez at centre-back. Mart\u00ednez looks to be a big part of this changed demeanour. At the end of a hard-won home win over West Ham in October \u2013 in which he again displayed the fearlessness that defines him \u2013 he led celebrations with teammates and crowd. But after that he sought out Shaw, not to congratulate but to cajole, displaying the kind of confrontational leadership that links many of the club\u2019s most important and revered players; players who could be relied upon to deliver consistently and in the clutch, inspiring those around them never to let themselves off; players who stood for something. You don\u2019t have to be tall to be a giant.  None of this is to say that Mart\u00ednez is perfect. In the season\u2019s first Manchester derby in October \u2013 though he was afforded little midfield ballast, and without him his team would have been even further behind at half-time \u2013 he stood off Erling Haaland at various points and must come up with something different on Saturday. Similarly, when United conceded twice in the first 11 minutes in the league game at Villa \u2013 though he was again compromised by the midfield, this time absent anyone able to run fast \u2013 he was unusually lax. But these games are outliers and we saw in Qatar that Mart\u00ednez is focused enough to contribute even when not playing regularly. He was left out of Argentina\u2019s first game, that they lost; included for their crucial second, which they won against Mexico with a clean sheet; then came off the bench against Australia in the last 16, preserving his team\u2019s narrow lead with a superb tackle before celebrating as if he had scored. Never before, though, have players assimilating the unrivalled elation of winning a World Cup been subsequently hurled into the depths of an English winter and the unremitting grind of a truncated season. So Mart\u00ednez must find a new kind of mental strength and the portents are good. When Scott McTominay messaged him after the final to offer congratulations, he responded by advising that \u201cwe go for the next one\u201d and though words are easily delivered, Mart\u00ednez is not one for idle chatter \u2013 just ask Mohamed Salah."

Van Gaal, 70, speaking to the RTL TV show Humberto on Sunday, revealed he has been receiving treatment while continuing to train the Dutch team but had not informed his players of his condition. He said he plans to carry on in his role in leading the Dutch team in the World Cup this year.  \u201cI think you don\u2019t tell people you work with like that because it might influence their choices, their decisiveness, so I thought they shouldn\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t die from prostate cancer, at least not in 90% of the cases. \u201cIt is usually other underlying diseases that kill you. But I had a pretty aggressive form, got irradiated 25 times. Then you have a lot of management to do in order to get through life.\u201d Van Gaal is in his third stint in charge of the national team, having led the team to a third-placed finish at the World Cup in 2014 before joining Manchester United. The Dutch were drawn in Group A for this year\u2019s World Cup alongside the tournament hosts, Qatar, Ecuador and Senegal, who they will play in the tournament\u2019s first match in Doha on 21 November.  \u201cI did have preferential treatment in the hospital,\u201d Van Gaal said. \u201cI was allowed in through the back door when I went to an appointment and was immediately pushed into another room. I have been treated wonderfully. \u201cYou will of course tell your friends and relatives about it,\u201d he said, when asked about keeping his illness secret. \u201cThe fact that nothing has come out yet also says something about my environment. That\u2019s great.\u201d Marcus Rashford was one of many in the world of football to send Van Gaal his best wishes on Twitter. \u201cEarned my debut from LVG. Will forever be indebted,\u201d Rashford wrote. \u201cYou can fight this. We are all behind you.\u201d  Manchester United\u2019s official account later tweeted: \u201cEverybody at Manchester United is fully behind our former manager, Louis van Gaal, in his battle against cancer. Sending you strength and courage, Louis.\u201d Gary Lineker wrote: \u201cSending best wishes and hopes for a full recovery.\u201d His coaching career spanning almost four decades, Van Gaal has won league titles with Barcelona, Ajax, Bayern Munich and AZ Alkmaar, winning the Champions League with Ajax in 1995. He spent two seasons at United, leading the club to the FA Cup in 2016 before being sacked days later."

                    "body": "Nothing this precious ever came easy. Two parts ecstasy to one part agony, Argentina qualified for the quarter-finals of the World Cup. They secured a two-goal lead through Lionel Messi and Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez, played some of their most unfettered and spellbinding football of the tournament and peppered the Australian goal with shots during a gripping second half.\nAnd yet, did you expect Australia to sit down and accept their fate? This Australia, with its SPFL stalwarts, its honest journeymen, its plethora of guys with surnames as first names? Australia took the hard road to Qatar and they took the hard road out of it, outgunned but never outrun, even burgling a late consolation goal and threatening a staggering shock.\n\nThey may not be stuffed with household names. They may have been given the runaround by the world\u2019s greatest player for an hour. But they left every piece of themselves on that pitch, and somehow you sense the game Down Under will never be quite the same.\nThe wild exuberance of Argentina\u2019s celebrations at full time gave the game away. For all the chances they missed, they knew too that they had been in a war. For all Messi\u2019s influence, his goal in the first half and mesmeric skill in the second, they were equally indebted to Lisandro and Emi Mart\u00ednez for the miraculous block and the heroic save that denied Australia a stunning equaliser. The Argentina of old might well have buckled. This group has hard edges, hard will, a steel in its soul.\nNot that any of this was particularly in evidence for half an hour. Long before the lawlessness of the second half came the holding pattern of the first, in which a sleepy-looking Argentina politely tried to break Australia down, and Australia politely refused. They may have been outnumbered in the stands, where the armies of the Albiceleste wrapped a tight tourniquet of noise around the pitch and were still squeezing an hour after full time. But on the pitch it was the gold shirts who looked busier, buzzier, more numerous. They covered more ground, won most of the second balls, counterattacked with decent numbers.\n\nAt which point Aziz Behich, of Dundee United, did something that he will probably end up regretting. It was 10 minutes before half-time and Messi was tussling for a ball near the right touchline. Behich barged him off it, grabbed a piece of his shirt and gave Messi a sharp Melburnian sledge the contents of which will sadly be lost to history. Messi\u2019s angry reaction was the first real human moment we had seen from him all night.\nMaybe it meant something. Maybe it meant nothing. All we know is that a few seconds later, Messi collected the ball on the right wing, knocked the ball to Alexis Mac Allister 30 yards out and charged into the penalty area.\nWith a speed and conviction not always seen from him in this tournament, he picked up the return pass via the touch of Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi and slid the ball into the bottom corner the way he has done several hundred times before, but never through the legs of Harry Souttar, of Stoke City. It was his first kick in the penalty area all game.\n\nLionel Scaloni switched to a back three in the second half, and as the game began to stretch Argentina now had a width and verticality that suited them. They were playing with more energy now, more brio and swagger, more spite in the press. Messi made a couple of brisk runs that evoked his electrifying peak. And as Maty Ryan, of FC Copenhagen, received a routine back pass, Rodrigo De Paul sprinted towards him, murderously closing down his angles.\nRyan tried to dribble his way out of trouble. It was a moment of pure impulse, the sort of act where you can already hear the whoops of acclaim from the crowd, perhaps even glimpse your fleeting moment of viral fame.\nUnfortunately, in ducking clear of De Paul, he forgot that \u00c1lvarez was lurking behind him. \u00c1lvarez nicked the ball. \u00c1lvarez finished beautifully. Ryan blinked blankly. He could hear the whoops of acclaim. He could glimpse the viral fame. But this wasn\u2019t the way he had planned it.\nBut things didn\u2019t go the way Argentina planned them, either. With 13 minutes remaining and Scaloni beginning to rest players for the quarter-final against the Netherlands, Craig Goodwin, of Adelaide United, took a wild shot from 30 yards. Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez got a deflection on it. And somehow a second later the ball was looping into the top corner, with Emi Mart\u00ednez totally flummoxed.\nFor a few minutes Australia\u2019s players shook with belief, their fans with disbelief. In the dying minutes Behich was denied by Lisandro Mart\u00ednez after an exhilarating dribble. Next Garang Kuol found himself alone with Emi Mart\u00ednez, who saved his shot with a flying left hand. Argentina breathed again, and now they dream again.\nWhat do they have left to give? From the very start this has been a campaign fuelled by tears and drama, pure faith and pure want.\nIs it healthy to expend this much emotional energy this soon? If you\u2019re emptying the tank against Australia, where do you go next? How long can an imperfect team keep riding the wave of desire? Mercifully, thrillingly, we are about to find out all the answers."

                    "body": "This proved a game too far for Iran. As their players took in the significance of the final whistle, many of them falling to the floor, it was impossible not to wonder what was running through their minds. Rarely has a team contested a World Cup facing such an extraordinary set of external pressures and the devastation at falling agonisingly short of a debut in the knockout stage was etched on every face. When the dust has settled they should take huge pride in remaining so competitive but the physical and emotional exertions of recent weeks will have taken a considerable toll.\nThe mood would have been vastly different had they converted one of several good second-half chances, the last of them falling to Mehdi Taremi deep into added time. He could not squeeze the ball far enough beyond Matt Turner, claiming to have been pulled back by Cameron Carter-Vickers and taking animated issue with the match officials after proceedings had concluded. In reality he was clutching at straws: any contact had been inconsequential and the truth was that, over the piece, Iran were beaten by the better side.\n\nIt was a triumph for the USA, who deserved the winner Christian Pulisic mustered seven minutes before half\u2011time. There may be a cost: in scoring from close range Pulisic collided with the Iran goalkeeper, Alireza Beiranvand, and did not appear for the second half, undergoing precautionary scans in hospital for an abdominal injury. The prognosis remains to be seen but, for now, Gregg Berhalter and his players will savour the prospect of facing the Netherlands on Saturday.\nThey mastered an occasion for which the buildup contained enough storylines, strands and sledges to fill a tome. Iran\u2019s football association had unsuccessfully requested Fifa ban the USA from the tournament for using an altered version of their flag on social media in solidarity with oppressed women in the country; Carlos Queiroz had stirred the pot by shining a light on social problems across the Atlantic and all this is before anyone factors in the longer-term history between the two.\n\nSinging their national anthem with varying degrees of enthusiasm, the Iran players could not fail to hear the whistles raining down from sections of their support. Those were aimed at the regime, not the men caught in the middle; when play began the fans\u2019 energy was channelled into deafening support of their team, only falling chillingly silent when Pulisic finished off a superb move.\n\u201cThe dream is over,\u201d Queiroz said before paying tribute to the remarkable application of his squad. \u201cThroughout my career I have never seen players who gave so much and received so little in return. I am extraordinarily proud of their dedication and the effort that they made, wearing their jerseys for their country.\u201d\n\nA point would have seen them qualify but, after starting like a team that fancied all three, they spent most of the opening period overrun by a fit, fast USA team that Queiroz described as \u201cFerraris\u201d. The goal had been coming even if clear chances had not preceded it; Tyler Adams, Yunus Musah and Weston McKennie had assumed control of midfield while Sergi\u00f1o Dest and Timothy Weah wreaked chaos down the right.\nTheir pressure told in slick fashion with execution straight from the training ground. Everything had to be perfect and it was: from McKennie\u2019s 45-yard diagonal ball towards Dest, to the right-back\u2019s run and deliberate header across the six-yard box, to Pulisic\u2019s sharply timed dart and adept finish from close in. The blow he took in the process will have been worth it.\n\n\u201cThey deserved to score,\u201d Queiroz admitted. But his assessment of the second half was that Iran did, too, and he concluded a draw would have been \u201cthe right result\u201d. They did not mount enough sustained pressure to be entirely convincing, even as the USA went into their shell, but the substitute Saman Ghoddos was wayward from two presentable openings and Ramin Rezaeian headed a whisker wide as the minutes ticked down.\nThe suspension of Alireza Jahanbakhsh and evident fitness issues surrounding Sardar Azmoun, who was withdrawn at the interval, limited their attacking options and they looked leggy for extended periods. Taremi fluffed a golden chance to tee up a sitter for Azmoun before the USA took control but Iran never quite seemed sharp enough.\n\nIt all made for an occasion that passed mercifully quietly, even if there was no pre-match repeat of the joint photograph taken when the countries met at France 98. Berhalter noted that this year\u2019s team had summoned the intensity that their predecessors, who were beaten 2-1 back then, could not. That made a sizable difference but surely the environment within which Iran have been forced to operate did, too.\n\u201cThanks to their work, the conversations, the players little by little started smiling again,\u201d Queiroz said. \u201cThey understand to whom they are playing, they understand their mission when they are playing for Iran.\u201d In helping shine a light on the appalling conditions faced by so many there, perhaps they have fulfilled part of it in Qatar. Whether generated on or off the pitch, the hurt and sadness will not pass quickly."

                    "body": "The best way to sum up how bad things were for Jesse Lingard was that he had become everything he is not. The fun-loving, extrovert Nottingham Forest midfielder did not want to leave the house. The boy who has always embraced the ball and the game with everything he has did not want to be on the pitch. He was even drinking. Anything to escape the bleakness of his reality. \u201cI was on autopilot,\u201d Lingard says. \u201cI was having conversations with people and I was just like: \u2018Yeah. OK. Yeah.\u2019 Nothing would register. It would go in one ear and out the other. I was numb and I wanted to be in that numb state where I didn\u2019t have to feel anything.\u201d  This is what depression looks like, the insidious condition that has tormented Lingard\u2019s mum, Kirsty, for longer than either of them want to dwell on. Lingard says she has been \u201cdepressed from when I was born\u201d, often medicated and in bed; exhausted, overwhelmed, the curtains pulled shut. And it is what took hold of him in 2019 when he was a Manchester United player, gripping with increasing ferocity in the months leading up to the first coronavirus lockdown in March 2020. Lingard says that rock bottom came in an FA Cup tie at Derby at the beginning of that month. He had played the 90 minutes and United won 3-0, but he was not really there. He had not been for some time. As he boarded the team bus afterwards, a couple of United fans hurled sustained and deeply unpleasant abuse at him. They did not know what was going on in Lingard\u2019s life. When his mum was admitted to a facility in London in 2019 for treatment, Lingard\u2019s younger brother, Jasper, and younger sister, Daisy, came to live with him. He had them there for \u201clonger than six months\u201d, looking after them, making sure that they got to school and all the rest. As he worried about his mum and felt his siblings missing her, his well-being crashed. It is unlikely that the abusive supporters would have cared. To them Lingard was a highly paid footballer, living the dream at his boyhood club, and so he had to perform. Full stop. But Lingard wants to open up on his turmoil, perhaps to explain what was a lost period for him at United and, more importantly, to raise awareness and understanding of the issues around poor mental health. It is why he has collaborated on a documentary with Channel 4 \u2013 Untold: The Jesse Lingard Story, which airs on Tuesday. \u201cI just felt so much scrutiny, especially after the Derby game and I was getting abuse as I got on the bus,\u201d Lingard says. \u201cI can normally take it but sometimes it gets to a point where it\u2019s like: \u2018Ahh, I can\u2019t even be arsed doing this any more.\u2019 \u201cNobody really knew about my struggles off the pitch so they think: \u2018You\u2019re a footballer, you live in a nice house, you\u2019ve got money, you can deal with anything.\u2019 But when it\u2019s someone\u2019s health and well being \u2013 it\u2019s a different situation. We\u2019re all human. \u201cIt was difficult around that moment in time. It was probably [for] months. I didn\u2019t want to play in case I did badly and there was more scrutiny. Football is my happy place but at that time, I couldn\u2019t really put myself in that situation. I was playing and I felt like I was nonexistent. The games were just passing me by. When it\u2019s not working out on the pitch, you try to work that bit harder to do well in the next match but my mind wasn\u2019t there to do that. I wanted to stop completely and have a break and just be at home. I didn\u2019t want to be on the pitch and have all that scrutiny. You lose a ball and it\u2019s more pressure.\u201d  Lingard paints a vivid picture of the loneliness he felt on the field, one man in front of thousands, the collective stare laser-like and utterly unforgiving. He holds his hands out and brings them slowly towards his head. \u201cYou feel like everything is closing in on you,\u201d he says. \u201cAll the weight is on your shoulders. You feel closed up. You don\u2019t want the ball, you are hiding away from the ball. That\u2019s never been me.\u201d There is a scene in the documentary where Lingard is videoed by his elder brother, Louie, lying on the sofa, completely still, eyes blank. He was like that for a few minutes, apparently, and it did not sound like an isolated moment. \u201cJust autopilot,\u201d Lingard says. \u201cComing home, lying on the sofa and staring. When I look at that now, I don\u2019t know what was in my mind but it must have been racing. Literally, I just wanted to sit at home and drink a little bit \u2013 try and take the pain away. I don\u2019t do that, normally. I\u2019m not really a big drinker. Of course, here and there on nights out, whatever. But sitting at home and drinking before bed \u2026 that\u2019s when I knew I was in a bad situation. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t drinking to excess. It was just little bits through the week and stuff like that. I look back and think: \u2018What was I doing?\u2019 It was probably just to be in a mind frame where I\u2019ve got no pain, no cares. Because I didn\u2019t have anyone to bounce off or feed off, I resorted to that.\u201d Lingard did confide in the United doctor and also Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, the team\u2019s manager at the time. They were sympathetic and it helped. But what he really needed was to get away from the game. He makes the point that he never wanted to quit for good, just have a break for a month, two months or \u201cwhatever it would have been\u201d. So lockdown, perversely, had an upside for him. Lingard took delivery from Louie of a stack of old videos of him doing well for United at youth level and England at the 2018 World Cup, when he was a fixture in Gareth Southgate\u2019s starting XI on the run to the semi-final \u2013 probably the highlight of his career. They reminded him of why he had got to the top in the first place and he was able to reset.  \u201cIf lockdown didn\u2019t happen, I don\u2019t know what situation I\u2019d be in because I needed that rest to really look at myself again, to reignite that fire in my belly and work out what was wrong with me,\u201d Lingard says. \u201cIt was a turning point. I watched those videos and thought: \u2018I should never doubt myself.\u2019 I started training every day, going for runs and making sure that I was one of the fittest going back to United after lockdown.\u201d The knocks continued to come but now he was able to deal with them. Lingard barely played for United in the first half of the following season but when he got a loan to West Ham in January 2021, he caught fire, scoring nine Premier League goals for them, although it was not enough to earn a place in the England squad for the European Championship. He was also able to stay strong last season when he started only three games for United and the club blocked a January loan to Newcastle.  If Lingard describes his Euro omission as a \u201cdown moment; I expected to go with the form I was in\u201d, he knew in his heart of hearts that he would not get the call for the World Cup in Qatar. He has simply not started well enough at Forest after his free transfer from United in July, only scoring his first goal and registering his first assist in last Wednesday\u2019s Carabao Cup win over Tottenham. Lingard, though, is back to being himself and he can also be proud of the courage that his mum showed to talk so candidly in the documentary. \u201cI guarantee that many, many people will be going through depression, especially in football, which is such a mentally draining sport,\u201d Lingard says. \u201cFor me, it was about opening up and speaking about it. You\u2019re never going to be judged because you\u2019re a man and you\u2019re talking about mental health and your feelings. You\u2019re not soft for it.\u201d Untold: The Jesse Lingard Story airs Tuesday 15 November on All 4  In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

                    "body": "RHYFEDDODAU CYMRU Dust off that old Feeder LP and crack open a bottle of Brains, folks, because Wales are going to the Human Rights World Cup! Ending a 64-year wait to take part in Fifa\u2019s lucrative jamboree was never going to be easy against an extraordinary Ukraine team and the seething mass of fans in red were grateful to not one, but two 32-year-old talismanic captains for taking them to Qatar. Poor Andriy Yarmolenko. He deserved better than the ignominy of giving Gareth Bale\u2019s dipping free-kick a Sandy Brown-style finish. Still, that he and his teammates were playing at all was an incredible achievement in itself \u2013 and to be the slicker side for large parts of the match was testament to the kind of talent and resolve The Fiver could only ever dream of possessing. It was a heady afternoon at the Cardiff City Stadium that began with folk legend Dafydd Iwan leading a raucous rendition of Yma o Hyd and ended with Wales players standing en masse to applaud the fans of Ukraine who still don\u2019t know if their country will play another game of football, while Russia continues its barbaric assault on their homeland. The headlines centred on Bale after the match, but had it not been for Wayne Hennessey and Ben Davies taking turns playing Pong with every Ukraine strike on goal, the Wales captain would already be 18 holes into his retirement.  A giddy Bale, who roared that the victory was \u201cthe greatest result in the history of Welsh football\u201d [Mickey Thomas may disagree \u2013 Fiver Ed], will now have to choose which club\u2019s physios get the chance to keep him fit enough to play at the HRWC in November and December. \u201cI\u2019ve got loads [of offers],\u201d beamed Bale, who stomped around for 83 minutes despite being hampered by back spasm-knack. According to red-hot piffle in the tabloids, Cardiff City are among those lining up for the free agent\u2019s signature. We\u2019re not sure how much use Bale would be to the Bluebirds in a relegation six-pointer against Rotherham but, hey, the shirt sales would be off the scale. Isn\u2019t that right, Vincent? Wales join England, Iran and USA! USA!! USA!!! in Qatar. It\u2019s not the most daunting of groups for them, is it? They outperformed England in the 1958 World Cup. A goal by Pel\u00e9 in the quarter-finals secured a 1-0 win for eventual champions Brazil against a side spearheaded by the great John Charles. A similar performance in Qatar is not beyond a side that is chock full of spirit. Perhaps they could give Iwan a job as official Vibes Man. But the last word should be reserved for Ukraine. Had they qualified, it would have guaranteed media attention was drawn back to the war at a time when it is slipping down the agenda at many news organisations. \u201cWe just want your support,\u201d pleaded head coach Oleksandr Petrakov. \u201cWe just want you to understand what is happening back at home.\u201d QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cThe trespassers\u2019 ability to efficiently break down newly-installed fencing with specific tools, before accessing the grounds team\u2019s garage and recently-installed roof lighting control system, suggests that the intruders had a solid operational knowledge of Home Park, and the club will be lending its full support to the police in an attempt to see these individuals identified and punished accordingly\u201d \u2013 Plymouth Argyle reveal significant damage was caused to their pitch after a tractor was driven across it following a break-in.

                    "body": "Good morning. After days of escalating protests across China unprecedented since Xi Jinping came to power a decade ago, the state hit back on Monday night. \u201cThere was a massive police presence [at the expected protest sites] in Shanghai and Beijing questioning passers-by,\u201d the Guardian\u2019s Helen Davidson, covering the story from Taipei, told me this morning. \u201cThey scared people off, which was obviously the intention.\u201d And yet the unrest that has grown over recent days and weeks remains a sign of an extraordinary rupture in China\u2019s political system. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to lead to a revolution,\u201d Helen said. \u201cBut I do think it is a point of no return in the relationship between the general population and the CCP [Chinese Communist party], at least as far as Covid goes. There are frequent protests in China. But people who have been living in China for decades say they haven\u2019t seen anything like this since Tiananmen Square in 1989.\u201d So what do the protesters want \u2013 and how have they expressed their anger at Xi and the government he leads? \u201cPeople are saying a lot of different things,\u201d said Helen. \u201cThe frustration is overwhelmingly about the zero-Covid policy \u2013 but there has been an element of extending into talking about democracy.\u201d Today\u2019s newsletter tells the story of how that movement has built and built over the last six weeks \u2013 in the protesters\u2019 own words. Here are the headlines. Five big stories  Foreign policy | Rishi Sunak has signalled the end of the \u201cgolden era\u201d of relations between Britain and China, using his first major foreign policy speech to warn of the creeping authoritarianism of Xi Jinping\u2019s regime. Sunak called China a \u201csystemic challenge to our values and interests\u201d. Internet safety | Social media platforms that breach pledges to block sexist and racist content could face substantial fines under new changes to the online safety bill. Ofcom will have the power to fine companies up to 10% of global turnover for breaches. Ukraine | Fighting around the key eastern Ukraine town of Bakhmut has descended into a bloody morass with hundreds of dead and injured reported daily, as neither Russian or Ukrainian forces were able to make a significant breakthrough after months of fighting. Environment | A report by Unesco and IUCN has concluded that the Great Barrier Reef, the world\u2019s biggest coral reef system, should be placed on a list of world heritage sites that are in danger. Media | More than 70 media figures, including the editors of the Guardian and the Daily Mail, are calling on the government to back a proposed law to tackle \u201cabusive legal tactics to shut down investigations\u201d. A letter calls for urgent action against the global super-rich\u2019s use of \u2018\u201cstrategic lawsuits against public participation\u201d (Slapps).  In depth: \u2018The spark that lit a prairie fire\u2019  *** 13 October Sitong Bridge, Beijing With 36 Chinese cities across 31 provinces under lockdown or other coronavirus controls \u2013 a total of about 197 million people \u2013 two large banners are unfurled on a flyover in Beijing (above), a rare gesture of public protest that draws widespread attention on social media. One of the banners reads: \u201cWe want food, not PCR tests. We want freedom, not lockdowns. We want respect, not lies. We want reform, not a cultural revolution. We want a vote, not a leader. We want to be citizens, not slaves.\u201d While posts connected to the incident are swiftly scrubbed from social media platforms, many users discuss the gesture, sometimes under the hashtag \u201cI saw it\u201d, Helen Davidson reports. Many commenters use a revolutionary saying made famous by Mao Zedong: \u201cA single spark can set the prairie ablaze.\u201d The banners are swiftly removed, and police deny anything unusual has happened. *** 1 November Zhengzhou, Henan province With restrictions in place for almost a month despite Covid numbers across Henan of around 20-30 daily \u2013 and after workers flee from Apple supplier Foxconn\u2019s local plant, where they have been forced to live as well as work to maintain lockdown protocols \u2013 residents express their anger at \u201cperformative lockdown lifting\u201d for visiting state media. One addressed local authorities: \u201cYou end the lockdown when the CCTV supervision team comes, does it mean you will lock us down again as soon as they leave?\u201d *** 3 November Lanzhou, Gansu province The father of a three-year-old boy who died from carbon monoxide poisoning gives an interview to Reuters saying that strict Covid policies played a part in his son\u2019s death because he was not allowed out of his community compound to take him to hospital. \u201cThere was the Covid situation at the checkpoint. The staff did not act, and then ignored and avoided the problem, and then we were blocked by another checkpoint,\u201d Tuo Shilei said. \u201cNo help was provided. This series of events caused the death of my child.\u201d Residents take to the streets in response to the news and are met with riot police. \u201cAsk your leader to come here and tell us what happened today,\u201d one woman reportedly shouts at officials. The story of the boy, named Wenxuan, is shared on social media, under the hashtag \u201cThree years of Covid was his entire life\u201d, after a video of him receiving CPR goes viral. \u201cThe kid\u2019s memory will sadly be of masks and nothing else,\u201d one Weibo user writes. Tuo is unable to attend Wenxuan\u2019s funeral in his hometown because of fears he would be quarantined on arrival. *** 15 November Guangzhou, Guangdong province With 5,000 cases a day in the city of 19 million, speculation is rife that local restrictions could widen. Crowds take to the streets and tear down barricades designed to enforce lockdown rules. In one video, CNN reports, as the crowd chants \u201cUnseal!\u201d, a man asks government coronavirus workers: \u201cIf your parents have gone sick, how would you feel? If your children are suffering from fever and prevented from leaving [for the hospital], how would you feel? Nobody came to explain and the community\u2019s office line is always busy. And our landlord doesn\u2019t care if we live or die. What should we do?\u201d *** 25 November Urumqi, Xinjiang province  After a fire kills 10 people in a high-rise building, many locals suspect that coronavirus control measures hampered the victims\u2019 ability to escape. The claim is denied by the authorities, but Reuters reports crowds taking to the streets the following day, chanting \u201cEnd the lockdown!\u201d Videos show a crowd singing the Chinese national anthem, including the line: \u201cRise up, those who refuse to be slaves!\u201d In Beijing, residents successfully persuade a local leader to cancel a lockdown, referring to the Urumqi fire in their argument: \u201cThat tragedy could have happened to any one of us,\u201d one of the protesters says. *** 26 November Shanghai; Nanjing, Jiangsu province; Beijing Anger sparked by the deaths in Urumqi spreads across the country, with calls to ease lockdown restrictions gaining momentum. In Shanghai, where protesters chant for Xi Jinping to step down, local resident James Yu adapts the Mao Zedong phrase, telling the New York Times: \u201cThe demonstrations across the country have been like the spark that lit a prairie fire \u2026 It feels powerful.\u201d In a video taken at the Communication University of China in Nanjing, crowds hold their phones aloft, torches on, as a young man who says he is from Xinjiang tells them: \u201cBefore I felt I was a coward, but now at this moment I feel I can stand up. I speak for my home region, speak for those friends who lost relatives and kin in the fire disaster. And for the deceased.\u201d  Also in Shanghai, the Washington Post reports on a candlelit vigil on a road named after Urumqi, where protesters hold up blank sheets of paper to symbolise their opposition to state censorship. (Helen Sullivan has more about the symbols of the protests here.) A man who photographed the incident says the pages were passed around: \u201cEveryone was holding it. No one said anything, but we all knew what it meant. Delete all you want. You can\u2019t censor what is unsaid.\u201d A protester \u2013 nicknamed \u201cShanghai flower boy\u201d online for the bouquet in his hand as his speaks \u2013 asks: \u201cThose victims, how they died, we are all clear about that. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d Video shows him quickly being taken away by police. At Tsinghua University in Beijing, a young woman tells the crowd through a loudspeaker: \u201cIf because we are afraid of being arrested, we don\u2019t speak, I believe our people will be disappointed in us. As a Tsinghua student, I will regret this my whole life.\u201d *** 27 November Shanghai, Beijing Protests in Shanghai continue, Reuters reports, with hundreds clashing with police in the city. \u201cI\u2019m here because I love my country, but I don\u2019t love my government,\u201d says a protester named Shaun Xiao. \u201cI want to be able to go out freely, but I can\u2019t. Our Covid-19 policy is a game and is not based on science or reality.\u201d In Beijing, AFP reports, as people yelled \u201cWe will not forget!\u201d, one woman, named as Tian, says: \u201cYou have to fight for your own future. I\u2019m not scared because we\u2019re not doing anything wrong. We\u2019re not breaking any laws. Everyone\u2019s working hard for a better tomorrow.\u201d  *** 28 November Shanghai, Beijing, Chengdu, Wuhan, Guangzhou At the end of a weekend of intensifying protest across China, protesters in Beijing shout: \u201cThis is not normal life, we\u2019ve had enough. Our lives were not like this before!\u201d Students at Tsinghua University hold up signs showing a maths equation named after the physicist Alexander Friedmann, apparently in order to denote the homonym \u201cfree man\u201d. Later, around 1,000 people gather in two groups late Sunday night and early Monday morning. One man holding up a blank piece of paper says: \u201cWe\u2019ll always support the Communist party, but we want democracy and freedom.\u201d In Chengdu, people chant: \u201cGive me liberty or give me death!\u201d And in Shanghai, a crowd applauds as a woman echoes that banner on the bridge six weeks ago: \u201cWe want respect, not lies. We want reform, not a cultural revolution. We want a vote, not a leader. We want to be citizens, not slaves.\u201d What else we\u2019ve been reading  From common viruses to pneumonia, cold homes are known to have adverse impacts on physical health. David Robson unpacks how the energy crisis could impact people\u2019s social connections and exacerbate loneliness. Nimo The Homes for Ukraine scheme was slated to last for six months \u2013 and for its 144,000 beneficiaries, time is up. Amelia Gentleman has a superb piece on how it\u2019s gone, and the complicated question of what happens next. Archie Following Matt Hancock\u2019s surprisingly good showing on I\u2019m a Celebrity, Zoe Williams looks at why so many are quick to forgive politicians who use TV to launder their terrible reputations. Nimo I heard about something called the Millennial Pause yesterday, which turns out to be a source of some hilarity to certain Gen Zers: the split-second gap people of my age leave in online recordings before they speak to check its working. This August piece by Kate Lindsay in the Atlantic filled me in on all the mortifying details. Still, at least I learned about it via a WhatsApp group. Suck on that, boomers! Archie Wilfred Chan visited one of the few areas where the GOP made unexpected gains in the US midterm elections: immigrant enclaves in Brooklyn. Chan spoke to residents, councillors and political volunteers about the rising conservatism there and why some immigrant groups feel left behind by the Democratic party. Nimo  World Cup  Monday\u2019s fixtures started with a thrilling and chaotic draw between Cameroon and Serbia, which ended 3-3 after Cameroon took the lead and then fell 3-1 behind. The highlight was an audacious lob from Vincent Aboubakar. Then South Korea and Ghana played out a similarly dramatic match, with Ghana prevailing 3-2 after South Korea had come back from 2-0 down. A stunning late goal from Casemiro took Brazil to a 1-0 victory over Switzerland and secured a place in the last 16, while Portugal also qualified for the next round after a double from Bruno Fernandes (above) ensured a 2-0 victory over Uruguay. That match featured a pitch invader holding a rainbow flag and wearing a shirt saying \u201cRespect for Iranian women\u201d. Meanwhile, ahead of tonight\u2019s Group B fixture between England and Wales, Gareth Southgate promised that his side would \u201cmatch the spirit [of Wales] and display the quality with the ball that allows us to be ruthless\u201d, while Gareth Bale promised Wales would \u201cgive everything we can to try to qualify\u201d and added: \u201cthe dragon on my shirt; that\u2019s all I need\u201d. Barney Ronay writes that the most notable aspect of Gianni Infantino\u2019s World Cup since his remarkable outburst at the start of the tournament is that he has gone into \u201cstealth mode\u201d, and adds: \u201cInfantino sits on top of this bonfire of greed, vanity and despotic power like a boggle-eyed Guy Fawkes mannequin\u201d.

Through the use of cutting-edge technology to reveal the 3D surface of the manuscript, the academics were able to uncover a 1,300-year-old secret. Not only is this discovery a testament to the human urge to want to leave a mark on the world that stands the tests of time, it is also evidence of the presence of women who could have created, owned or used these medieval manuscripts.

As Italy laboured to break down North Macedonia in Thursday night\u2019s World Cup playoff, rushing their choices as the pressure rose inexorably, Southgate was taken back to Euro 2016 in France and the horror show that was the last-16 exit against Iceland \u2013 a defeat that would lead, in the end, to his appointment as the England manager.\nOn this occasion, Italy suffered the knockout blow late on, conceding the decisive goal in stoppage time, but it added up to the same thing \u2013 a tournament dream in ruins. The European champions will not be going to Qatar at the end of the year and the sense of shock remains profound.\n\n\u201cI think a part of it ended up being anxiety, the longer it went, as well \u2026 making the right decisions under pressure,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cThat\u2019s something we\u2019ve spoken about a lot from when we took over because we had a game like that in France six years ago. Thursday night\u2019s game reminded me a little bit of that. As it reminded me of Italy\u2019s playoff with Sweden before the last World Cup [which they also lost] when you suddenly got the feel that, yeah, it was getting more and more tense.\u201d\nDelivering when the heat is on is the name of the game and Southgate had a message for his players after they met to prepare for the Wembley friendlies against Switzerland and Ivory Coast on Saturday and on Tuesday respectively.\n\u201cIn terms of pressure, we will never \u2026 I said this to the players the other day \u2026 they\u2019ll never experience pressure like they felt last summer,\u201d Southgate said with a nod towards Euro 2020, which ended with the penalty shootout loss to Italy in the final. \u201cTo be in a European Championship where the majority of the games were at Wembley and having not been to a final for 55 years \u2026 They\u2019ve lived through enormous pressure so that should give them tremendous confidence in what they\u2019re capable of.\u201d\nWhat Southgate really wanted to stress in the wake of Italy\u2019s demise and as the countdown to Qatar becomes louder \u2013 it is the draw next Friday \u2013 was how it shone a favourable light on the mentality that he has instilled in his squad.\n\nHave Italy struggled to refocus after the glorious high of last summer? Nobody in England can say. Yet it is clear that Southgate\u2019s players have been able to move on from the crushing low.\n\u201cWhat our team have done really well is recover from the disappointment of the summer and manage to sustain performance,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cWe wanted to sustain performance after the World Cup in Russia [in 2018]. We knew that if we didn\u2019t, we would be accused of having had an easy draw [to the semi-finals], being a flash in the pan, and the players responded to that in the Nations League that followed.\n\u201cThey then responded to that in the European Championship and they responded to that again to make sure we got the World Cup qualification nailed, in particular in Budapest [in the 4-0 win over Hungary last September].\u201d\nAs Southgate and the midfielder Jordan Henderson pointed out, qualification should not be taken for granted, even if it normally is. \u201cThat [Italy\u2019s exit] shows if you\u2019re not 100% at it, you can be punished,\u201d Henderson said.\n\nEngland cannot allow their levels to drop, even if Switzerland and Ivory Coast are friendlies, because the preparation windows are almost worryingly short before the World Cup kicks off on 21 November. Southgate has only two more international breaks after this one \u2013 in June and September, when England will play four and two Nations League ties respectively \u2013 and the curiosities of a November tournament feel numerous and daunting.\nSouthgate described it as \u201cmore complicated\u201d, arguing he and the players had disproved the notion that those at the end of a season were too physically demanding. This time, the concern is over the volume of matches before the leagues pause \u2013 the Premier League will do so after the games on 13 November.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really condensed programme of regular midweeks as well as the Saturdays so we\u2019re not sure what kind of impact that will have injury-wise,\u201d Southgate said.\n\nSurely the biggest worry is the tightness of the turnaround between the temporary halt to the club programme and the beginning of the World Cup, which will not allow Southgate to schedule a warm-up fixture. England face Germany at Wembley on 26 September. Their next game will be the first of their World Cup group.\n\u201cThe fact that there\u2019s seven to 10 days between the last league game and the first game of the tournament is quite an extreme situation,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cBecause we\u2019ve got to factor in flying, getting over the time difference, some climate change within that and trying not to disrupt the training pattern too much across those days.\n\u201cMedically, there will also be some big calls. The scenario we had with Kalvin Phillips last summer where he popped his shoulder in the 92nd minute of the last game [for Leeds] \u2026 that\u2019s going to take a really quick call this time. There is going to need to be a lot of collaboration with clubs. I think we\u2019ve identified all of the issues. Now it\u2019s just having the plans to deal with them.\u201d\n\nSouthgate has, as ever, been forced to contend with a glut of injury withdrawals and the loss of Bukayo Saka after a positive Covid test is a headache in keeping with these disorientating times. \u201cI think you can carry on now in normal life [after testing positive] but the football rules are a bit different,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cI am in a maze of confusion, frankly.\u201d\nSwitzerland, quarter-finalists at the Euros and unbeaten and thriving in seven games under their new manager, Murat Yakin, will provide a stern test at a sold-out Wembley. Just ask Italy. It was the Swiss who finished on top of their World Cup qualifying group, having drawn with them at home and away, to set up the heartbreak against North Macedonia."

But the failure of election-denying Trump enablers does not mean the tempest has passed; around the globe, populists are harnessing divisive technologies to turn people against the very institutions that were designed to give them a voice. As the end-of-year summit circuit kicks off, a perfect storm of wicked challenges threatens the very foundations of the global order we have known since the the world last contemplated oblivion in the ashes of Auschwitz and Hiroshima. It starts, but in no way ends, with the world\u2019s stuttering efforts to deal with the growing evidence that global warming is untethering weather systems to wreak havoc across the globe.  This week\u2019s Cop27 talks in Egypt will attempt to nudge the world closer to binding commitments against the backdrop of the Ukraine war, rising energy prices and calls to compensate emerging nations being asked to forfeit fossil-fuelled development. Despite the evidence of previous conferences, Australians are positive about the talks, grateful that at least our government is no longer running active interference for vested energy interests. Younger voters, in particular, seem to have a bit riding on the outcome.  The politics of climate transition butt up against geopolitical fissures as China and India assert the fruits of their rapid development, while Europe and the US attempt to cling on to the influence of empires past. At the G20 leaders\u2019 summit in Bali, democracy is no longer the faction of choice. At the conference will be the designate of a president for life, a crown prince who literally decapitates dissent and a new leader who invokes Mussolini. Australians look at the global powers and see them all heading in the wrong direction: the Chinese surveillance statesman, the Russian warmonger, the American bin-fire and the self-destructive pantomime that has decoupled any notion of Great from Britain.  It is through this chaos that populists are emerging across what was once the democratic world, invoking the masses to hate their governments, allowing the lawless to thrive off this disillusionment. This is a backlash against government that actively encourages global corporations to trade \u201cfreely\u201d, wilfully removes local regulation and shrugs their shoulders when capital goes to the cheapest labour source. The inevitable consequence is rising inequality: the unequal distribution of the benefits of economic growth; the widening gap between wages and dividends; the destruction of secure, well-paid jobs that people could build a life around. Into this void sweet-talking hucksters with a command of media and the enthusiastic backing of the self-same vested interests they purport to challenge offer a compelling alternative to business as usual. When establishment politicians warn that \u201cdemocracy is at risk\u201d, the call to action sounds close to a defence of a status quo that has stopped working for ordinary people. If you want to understand the impending collapse of social democracy, look no further than the destruction of workplace democracy through the last decades of the 20th century. From the 1980s a combination of calculated union-busting, coordinated government attacks on industry strongholds (such as the recently departed Peter Reith\u2019s war on the waterfront) and the atomisation of labour saw union membership collapse around the world. It is as a direct consequence of these attacks that we now find a swathe of the population stuck in insecure work with wages falling in real-terms and no real say in how their lives will unfold. The Labor party\u2019s promise to lift wages was a core commitment before the last election. Yes, it was an explicit commitment to support increases to minimum wages, but it was more structural than just a submission to the Fair Work Commission.  Sign up for our free morning and afternoon email newsletters from Guardian Australia for your daily news roundup  Labor\u2019s mandate is to turn back the incessant tide of labour market deregulation that has left workers hanging on by their fingernails in this constant cycle of undercutting and work intensification at the altar of \u201cproductivity\u201d. In another key finding of this week\u2019s Essential Report voters say this mandate is real and it is ongoing. Most striking in these figures is the way support for reform crosses partisan divides: a majority of Coalition, minor party and independent voters all endorse the key objectives of Labor\u2019s laws \u2013 including industry-wide bargaining. While there is no red in teal, the new wave of independent representatives, for whom integrity and the status of women are key pillars, would do well to reflect on the broader implications of their IR vote. Far from driving industry anarchy, laws that allow unions back into workplaces to coordinate activity will actively contribute to the ballast of the economy and, through it, the broader society. That is why of all the global gatherings occurring over the coming weeks, perhaps the most consequential may well be the one being held right here in Melbourne, the International Trade Union Confederation\u2019s (ITUC) world congress, which opens on Thursday. It will be the final hurrah for former Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) president Sharan Burrow, who has spent the past 12 years doing what she does best, organising workers across the globe.   From successfully campaigning to end forced labour in Qatar before this year\u2019s World Cup, to inserting just transitions into climate agreements and putting a New Social Contract on to the UN agenda, Burrow\u2019s tenure as ITUC president has driven a renaissance in global collective action. Unions have been under the hammer for more than four decades but the logic of a collective voice for workers has never been more compelling. The ITUC agenda is focused on building wage justice around the globe, responding to the converging crises of climate, technology and public health and, yes, defending democracy. Without democratic work structures, the distance between the state and the public becomes a chasm, a free for all where differences are amplified and frustrations are nurtured and weaponised. Without unions, inequality grows, trust is broken, capital becomes untethered to reality. In the chaos the centre cannot hold. Restoring workers\u2019 rights is not just about sandbagging against despots; it is also about rebuilding the rotting foundations of democracy.

                    "body": "Theoretically this was the week when rugby entered a brave new world. It has certainly been a momentous-sounding few days courtesy of World Rugby\u2019s historic decision to hold \u2013 for men and women respectively \u2013 the 2031 and 2033 World Cups in the USA, the tantalising possibility of a sold-out Twickenham for a women\u2019s final in 2025 and renewed optimism about a Nations League tournament finally becoming reality. At the very least the tectonic plates of the old sport are shifting. Which sport would not relish a primetime World Cup final framed against the Manhattan skyline or access to a land of opportunity for both sexes? It is a universe away from the pie and pint amateur days when a Barbarians Easter tour to Penarth was pretty much the height of cross-border sophistication.  Progress in rugby, though, remains a subjective concept. The sport has been professional for more than a quarter of a century but paying the bills continues to be an issue for almost every union out there. World Cups in Australia in 2027 and 2029 will be spectacular events but the Australian Rugby Union would have gone bust by now without financial assistance from World Rugby. It has been a similar story in the States, where the union filed for bankruptcy as recently as 2020. Now, we are being told, the sport is on the brink of a gum-shielded gold rush. Twenty five cities from New Orleans to Washington DC have applied to host matches with organisers projecting that 4.1 million spectators could attend one or both of the tournaments. What if the American dream really can be made flesh and mass US audiences persuaded that gridiron without helmets is a game they might enjoy? A still-distant fantasy, maybe, but remember all the scepticism when the States hosted the men\u2019s football World Cup in 1994? These days it is the country\u2019s third most-played sport and their women\u2019s team are ranked top of the world. Rugby also now has nine years to get its stars and stripes-draped party absolutely right. World Rugby has received justifiable stick over the years but glimpses of clearer, more strategic thinking are emerging.  And, for better or worse, it has now fired the starting pistol on a pivotal decade set to define rugby as a major international sport. By packaging up the next few World Cups together the game has essentially challenged itself, commercially and popularity-wise, to sink or swim. Bidding for the 2027 World Cup was no vanity project, conceded Rugby Australia\u2019s chairman Hamish McLennan, but an absolute necessity down under. \u201cIn truth,\u201d McLennan told the Sydney Morning Herald, \u201cit was the only option we had to save the game.\u201d The question now is whether the prospect of all these new dollars, both American and Aussie, will be enough to loosen the binding ties of self-interest that have choked rugby\u2019s development as stubbornly as Japanese knotweed? Or, more specifically, to assist those who, hitherto, have struggled in the shadows of the established nations.  Which is why the most intense discussions in Dublin this week have not involved future World Cup hosting arrangements but a mooted Nations Championship, involving 24 teams in two divisions, taking place every two years (in even-numbered years) in the existing July and November Test windows. The idea is to have a grand final and promotion/relegation playoffs, with the second-tier competition potentially starting in 2024 followed by the top tournament in 2026. It all sounds lovely in principle, assuming you take the view that effectively crowning three world champions every four years does not dilute the primacy of the World Cup. Or that criss-crossing the globe even more frequently is good for rugby\u2019s carbon footprint. Or that it enhances player wellbeing. Either way, it will stand or fall on one key aspect which, crucially, remains unconfirmed. No one, as yet, knows the precise financial uplift the reorganisation will generate and how that revenue will be split. At present the host union keeps the gate receipts, handily ensuring the richer nations with the biggest stadiums receive the most. Will the plumpest turkeys vote for Christmas and agree to a central pot? If they genuinely ever want the game to broaden out and ensure 24 competitive sides at the 2031 Rugby World Cup, they surely cannot argue otherwise.  Even in Wales they have struggled to fill the Principality Stadium during the Six Nations. Domestic crowds in South Africa and Japan have been falling and dreams of rugby taking off commercially in Asia off the back of the 2019 World Cup have stalled, with Covid far from the only reason. The better news is that Fiji now have an island-based team competing in Super Rugby and interest in the women\u2019s game is steadily rising before this year\u2019s World Cup in New Zealand. South Africa\u2019s top provinces are poised to enter next season\u2019s European Cup, the latest move in rugby\u2019s financial drive to survive. Experts in global rugby economics, however, are holding fire on predictions of a \u201cgolden decade\u201d which will smooth away all the game\u2019s cares. Mark Evans, the former Harlequins chief executive who has also worked in rugby league in Australia, is among those yet to be convinced a Nations Championship on its own will transform rugby\u2019s finances. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019ll be life changing,\u201d said Evans. \u201cIt all depends whether the cake has got bigger in totality. The argument is that by giving the autumn and summer Tests a clearer narrative and more meaning that will generate more revenue. In some countries that may well be true \u2013 and it will need to be.\u201d Should the promotion and relegation playoff element end up being delayed or shelved it will also massively dilute the overall proposition. As Dan Leo, chief executive of the Pacific Rugby players\u2019 association, observed this week: \u201cIt can\u2019t be a financial model that\u2019s good for the All Blacks, Australia and South Africa \u2013 there needs to be a way every rugby nation benefits from this.\u201d Which, along with long-term concussion concerns and player welfare, is rugby\u2019s perennial problem. Evans, though, believes the latest proposal is about as good as it is going to get. \u201cIt\u2019s not what you would do if you were starting from scratch but you\u2019re not. Given all the different stakeholders and all the conflicting issues it\u2019s probably as good as they could come up with.\u201d Everything now rests on rugby\u2019s ability to make it happen and, even more crucially, to make it pay."

                    "body": "You have to hand it to England, really. Few other nations can score nine goals and qualify top of their group and still provoke a debate about whether they are fit for purpose. In a way, there is a kind of genius to the perpetual dissatisfaction of the English: not so much a tyranny of expectations as a police state of expectations, a fascism of expectations.\nBut just for argument\u2019s sake, let\u2019s start with the caveats. After all, how much did we actually learn here? For all their vivid noise, Wales have essentially been gristle at this tournament: the ghosts at the edge of the photograph. There was a certain sadness in seeing the great Gareth Bale shuffled away at half\u2011time in what will almost certainly be his last World Cup, having tiptoed through this game the way he has tiptoed through most of this tournament, like a man going to the bathroom at 4am.\nLikewise, to say Declan Rice and Jordan Henderson won the battle in the centre is to damn them with faint praise. A set of dining chairs could have won the midfield battle against Wales. England could simply work the ball around them, safe in the knowledge that Joe Allen and Aaron Ramsey would back off at the first sign of trouble. Good luck trying that against Nampalys Mendy and Pape Gueye in the last 16.\n\nAnd yet in this languid slow burn of a performance there were still certain conclusions that could be drawn with clarity. Jude Bellingham is the real thing. The defence still looks pretty confident. Indeed it was Harry Maguire who provided perhaps the warmest moment of a tepid first half: storming out of defence like a guy who\u2019s just heard the first few notes of Hips Don\u2019t Lie on the dancefloor, and shanking a fierce left-foot shot into the desert.\nThat first half was, let\u2019s be honest, pretty thin. It wasn\u2019t simply slow and laboured, although it was obviously also both those things. At times it was almost comically inept: players making the same run, players running into each other. Everything England tried seemed to congeal in a little fetid no\u2011man\u2019s land about 45 yards from goal, from where the only options were to play it backwards or try a hopeless dinky cross. Perhaps this was Southgate\u2019s personal homage to Alf Ramsey\u2019s wingless wonders of 1966, only this time with wingers simply running into each other.\n\nThe problem here was that everyone seemed to want to play in the same space. Rashford on the left wanted to cut inside on to his stronger foot. Foden on the right wanted to cut inside on to his stronger foot. Henderson likes to drift into the channels. Bellingham also likes to drift into the channels. Harry Kane likes to drop deep to receive. The effect was a kind of footballing Hanger Lane gyratory: a cortege of extremely talented footballers essentially converging on the same spot and rotating very slowly around each other.\nTypical Gareth. Boring Gareth. Stubborn Gareth. As the teams disappeared down the tunnel at half-time you could almost feel the heat from the steam of a million middle-aged Englishmen collectively boiling their piss. A bright start had disintegrated into a staid passing circle, which as everyone knows is the wokest of all the shapes. But One Trick Gareth had a second trick up his sleeve. And it didn\u2019t even involve a substitution.\n\nSo it was a few minutes into the second half that Foden, now restored to his favoured left flank, slalomed past three Wales players, winning a free-kick that Rashford slotted beautifully into the top corner. Less than two minutes later Rashford, now given the freedom of the right wing, won the ball from Ben Davies, allowing Kane to play Foden in for his first tournament goal.\nAll of a sudden England were attacking from new angles, different angles, stretching the pitch and so stretching Wales. It\u2019s not a tactic that will work against every opponent in every situation. But in a way, this is the point.\nFor Southgate now has a quiet dilemma on his hands. Bukayo Saka has had a good tournament; Raheem Sterling is his talisman; Mason Mount his rock. But you try dropping Foden and Rashford after a second half like that. And so whither Bellingham in that clever, chaotic No 10 role? Against stronger opposition England will almost certainly revert to a back three, the wing-backs pushing up, the wide forwards inverted. But Southgate\u2019s timely switch has shown that there are other plans to hand, other ways of winning.\n\nAnd if England are going to go deep in this tournament, this is probably how they are going to have to do it. They have not enjoyed the luxury of extensive preparation time. They do not have a generational talent such as Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 or Lionel Messi. And so you simply have to keep switching the masks as you go, leave opponents guessing, move the points of attack. A cynic might offer that three games into the tournament Southgate still has no idea of his best team. An optimist might counter that on the contrary, he has several.\n"

In 30 years of journalism, I\u2019ve never interviewed a City player. Don\u2019t meet your heroes, they say. The whole thing is discombobulating. De Bruyne \u2013 one of the world\u2019s great players \u2013 has agreed to a rare interview. But there\u2019s a caveat. If you talk to me, he says, you also talk to my wife, my kids, you do it at our home and you get to know us all. Usually, it\u2019s the opposite \u2013 you don\u2019t talk to my family, you don\u2019t come to my home, it\u2019s all about the work rather than the private life. Strange. We meet a few weeks before the start of the World Cup. He\u2019s beginning to think about it. But in typical De Bruyne fashion he dispenses with diplomacy and tells it as it is. No, he\u2019s not happy about it being in Qatar. Yes, it is a distraction from the Premier League. No, he doesn\u2019t think Belgium have much chance of winning. Now he\u2019s out there hoping to prove himself wrong. At his best on the pitch, virtually everything is channelled through him. Often he will start a move by winning the ball and running with it in the same movement. Though he plays in the centre, he sets up goals by overlapping on the wing to put in crosses of such pace, swerve and accuracy that they are impossible to defend. And while goal-scoring isn\u2019t his main thing (he prefers to assist), last season, when he scored four goals against Wolves, commentator Alistair Mann quivered: \u201cKevin, stop it! I\u2019m running out of superlatives for you!\u201d In 2020, De Bruyne became the first City men\u2019s player to win the prestigious PFA Player of the Year, and won it again the following season. In September, he was named the world\u2019s best passer in the video game Fifa 23. Earlier this month, the game Football Manager 2023 ranked him the greatest player in the world. De Bruyne doesn\u2019t run with the football pack. We never see him out getting into trouble. In fact, we pretty much never see him. Which makes today even stranger. But it also makes a kind of sense. \u201cAway from football, it\u2019s all about family,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is my life.\u201d * * * Mich\u00e8le Lacroix, AKA Mrs De Bruyne, greets me at the door. She apologises for still being in her bathrobe, shows me in and makes coffee. The house is everything you\u2019d expect: huge driveway, extension the size of a small hotel, artworks galore, carpets like quicksand. Coco, the white-grey cat, is so perfectly coordinated, you wonder whether she came with the furnishings. Yet it\u2019s also homely. Toys spill out of the playroom and De Bruyne\u2019s office obviously doubled up as the home-schoolroom in the pandemic (one wall is plastered with spelling tests). De Bruyne is nowhere to be seen, so Lacroix introduces me to Coco, the three children and her mother. We chat and drink, and it\u2019s only after a while that I realise De Bruyne is also now in the kitchen. He is wearing a brown tracksuit, has a wispy gingerish beard and bears more than a passing resemblance to his cartoon compatriot Tintin. He glides through his house like a ghost: if he hadn\u2019t shaken my hand and introduced himself, I probably wouldn\u2019t have registered his presence. He floats off to the fridge, takes out slices of white Hovis, makes himself a mustard sandwich, heats up green soup and starts eating. All without a murmur. De Bruyne is a paradox. He is both famously shy and famously outspoken. A number of stories shape the mythology around him. The first is that at eight he turns to his father and says he wants to leave his club, KVV Drongen, because the training sessions at Ghent, another local club, are better. Second, now playing for Ghent, he gets so enraged when told off for not helping to clear up the pitch that he grabs one of the posts and refuses to let go. Three adults try to pull him away but fail, and his coach, Frank De Leyn, has to stay with him because De Bruyne tells him he is planning to hold on all night.  Fast forward a few years for another classic tale: De Bruyne is on the verge of the first team at rival Belgian club Genk, living there with a foster family during the week, when they decide, two years in, that they don\u2019t want him to live with them any more because he doesn\u2019t fit in; he\u2019s too quiet. Finally, there is the time, aged just 20, when he gives a half-time interview ripping into his Genk teammates for shirking: \u201cI\u2019m ashamed of them. I suggest that those who don\u2019t have a desire to play just leave,\u201d he says at the time. His management team are also here today and he\u2019s talking to them in a quiet, flat voice. It\u2019s so understated you almost tune out. Then you hear what he\u2019s saying. Asked if Belgium can win the World Cup, he says, \u201cNo chance, we\u2019re too old.\u201d It\u2019s only seven months ago that Belgium were ranked No 1 in the world. De Bruyne says that because the tournament is being played in Qatar in mid-season, it doesn\u2019t feel like a real World Cup. One of his reps says it must be a dream playing with Erling Haaland, the extraordinarily prolific striker at City. \u201cAch, it\u2019s like any forward.\u201d Even he thinks his response is underwhelming. \u201cHe is so quick, though,\u201d he adds.  He finishes his soup, cuts up some blackberries and grapes for baby Suri, who is sitting in her highchair having her hair primped for the photoshoot. He says his childhood was so different from that of his children. His father worked in a factory painting trains, his mother was a housewife, and he describes his background as \u201clower-middle class\u201d. What was he like at school? \u201cI was OK. Smart enough to know how much I needed to do and to finish it. I left at 18 with a diploma.\u201d I ask why so many European footballers seem better educated than their British counterparts. Perhaps the difference is languages, he says. \u201cThere are a lot of people from different countries who speak two or three languages, where English players usually only speak English. I come from a country where by 13 you are studying Dutch, French and English.\u201d With languages, perhaps comes wisdom and humility \u2013 an ability to put yourself in the shoes of others, a knowledge that your way is not the only way. He smiles. The Belgian way was never going to be the only way, he says. \u201cEverybody in Belgium always watches English TV anyway!\u201d I tell him I recently watched footage of him playing as a young boy and his style has hardly changed. Even if you blocked out his face, it could only be De Bruyne. \u201cI know!\u201d He takes out his phone and compares two photographs. \u201cThis is from a couple of months ago when I scored against Bournemouth. Look at the way I kick the ball. And this is a picture of me shooting when I was a kid. Identical! Same technique!\u201d  Are Mason, six, and Rome, almost four, promising footballers? \u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t play.\u201d Are they not interested? \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he says, as if he\u2019s never considered it. \u201cThey like to go to the football. My oldest plays piano a bit and likes to run. He\u2019s a good runner.\u201d I ask about the famous stories. Did you really cling to the goalpost and refuse to budge? \u201cI think the stories are a bit made up.\u201d So it\u2019s not true? \u201cI don\u2019t remember it. It could be true!\u201d Does it sound like him ? He grins. \u201cI was a little bit stubborn, yeah. I let most things go, but when I do say something I am outspoken. I know now when you speak as a teenager or a kid to an adult with an opinion, people don\u2019t like it \u2026 even if it\u2019s true.\u201d Was that the case when you suggested your Genk teammates were not trying? De Bruyne pinkens. He often flushes like this \u2013 when he\u2019s embarrassed, when he\u2019s upset on the pitch and when he\u2019s made one of his superhuman runs. \u201cYes! The problem is the fans like that and other people like that, but the team doesn\u2019t.\u201d * * * A hairdresser is here to give everyone a trim before the photoshoot. While it\u2019s De Bruyne\u2019s turn, I chat to Lacroix. She\u2019s a model, a social influencer (with more than 350,000 Instagram followers) and she recently started a Flemish podcast called Secret Society with a few Belgian girlfriends. Her parents are physiotherapists and she wanted to be a doctor when she was at school. \u201cI never thought my life would look like this. Getting a degree was my main goal then.\u201d When she was 17 and De Bruyne was 21, they started dating. Apart from it being her husband\u2019s career, she has no interest in football and certainly had no ambition to be a footballer\u2019s wife. Can she see what makes him a special player? \u201cI don\u2019t know a lot about football, but I think he sees things before the others maybe. He\u2019s always one step ahead?\u201d She\u2019s encouraging Suri to finish her fruit. \u201cEveryone thinks she\u2019s called Surrey,\u201d she says. \u201c\u2018Ello, Surrey!\u2019\u201d She does a good impression of a cockney. Rome is building a racetrack on his mini computer. He shows me how to do it, but I can\u2019t keep up. Mason asks for a go of my tape recorder. \u201cI\u2019m going to interview you. What\u2019s it like working for media? What\u2019s your favourite colour?\u201d De Bruyne emerges from his haircut looking pleased with himself. \u201cI\u2019m like 24 now! I could be a model!\u201d We head back into his office and he and Lacroix sit together on the sofa. I ask her how life has changed since they got together. For starters, she says, they weren\u2019t living anywhere like here. Back then he was just making a name for himself and they could pretty much do what they wanted socially. \u201cFootball-wise, it\u2019s got better and better. But then we could do more normal stuff. On a city trip, say, maybe two or three people would come up to us. Now we\u2019re more isolated. So you do more things at home with friends. Kevin has grown more open because we\u2019re in such an intimate circle, always with the same group. He\u2019s more comfortable with who he is.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m more open-minded to life,\u201d De Bruyne says. \u201cWhen I was younger, it was just football. Now I have a family, life is different.\u201d In fact, he says, it\u2019s remarkably similar to many other working people \u2013 he drops the kids off on his way to work, trains, comes home, family meal with the kids, helps with the homework, watches telly.   He admits there is one way their life is noticeably different from the rest of ours \u2013 they spend more money on stuff. This is partly because they can and partly because they pay extra to buy their privacy. \u201cWe have to live our life in a more secluded way. Often, if we go on a tour it will be a private tour, and most of the time this stuff is more expensive and more individual.\u201d Lacroix says this is not a choice. When she and the kids go out without De Bruyne, they can do whatever they want. But with him it\u2019s a different story. \u201cYesterday we thought we\u2019d try going to the fair and Kevin made at least 100 pictures. Maybe 150. And the kids had to wait all the time, and it wasn\u2019t enjoyable for them. At one point security came up and we thought they\u2019d help, then they said, \u2018Can we have a picture?\u2019\u201d She laughs.  She\u2019s not asking for sympathy, she says. In so many ways it\u2019s a wonderful, privileged life. But it isn\u2019t without problems. \u201cWhen I\u2019ve been driving to the club lately,\u201d De Bruyne says, \u201cthere have been people driving next to me and filming. People have followed me.\u201d After games, Lacroix adds, \u201cPeople just jump in front of the car so you can\u2019t drive. Then the one next to them goes for a picture so you can\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d Top footballers get paid ludicrous salaries and are idolised by their supporters. De Bruyne is City\u2019s best-paid player, earning an estimated \u00a3385,000 a week \u2013 \u00a320m a year. In 2020, he cut ties with his long-term agent, Patrick De Koster, after he was arrested on suspicion of fraud. The investigation was reportedly triggered by complaints from De Bruyne himself. Last year, he negotiated his own contract extension using data analysts to prove his worth to the club. All the money and worship must change you, I say. \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily think it\u2019s the money, it\u2019s the attention. If you go from no attention to wherever you go people give you attention, then that changes you. You either take everything in or block everything out. Some people like all the attention, but after a while it becomes so much you get eaten up by it. Then if you push it out you seem arrogant. It\u2019s a thin line you have to walk.\u201d In terms of attention, he says, it\u2019s harder for the top English players: \u201cBecause I\u2019m a foreigner living here, I\u2019m still OK. When you\u2019re an English player, the attention flows from everywhere. It would be too much for me.\u201d   Does he think he gets paid too much? \u201cNo. I compare it to a singer at a concert and 60,000 people come. I look at it logically. There are millions of people watching the football on TV, there\u2019s 60,000 watching the games, the income of a club is \u00a3500-\u00a3600m. Yeah, it\u2019s a lot of money, but is it too much? If the club can afford it, it\u2019s not too much. It\u2019s not a popular answer, but that\u2019s how I see it.\u201d How hard is it for them to relate to people struggling with the cost of living crisis? \u201cWe are really close to our family and friends, and most of them have normal jobs, so we know the struggles,\u201d Lacroix says.  She looks at De Bruyne and asks him to translate an expression. \u201cWe stay with our feet on the ground,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s easier for us to understand, but it will be harder for the kids because they\u2019re used to a certain lifestyle. They go to a private school and there are people from similar backgrounds. They understand when we go to see our families it\u2019s different types of houses and another lifestyle.\u201d It worries him: \u201cWe\u2019ll try, but it cannot be the same as when we grew up. It\u2019s not possible.\u201d When he was a child, he says, his parents didn\u2019t have much, but it was plenty: \u201cWe had what we needed; a nice garden.\u201d Does he have siblings? \u201cOne sister. She did trampoline and was pretty good at it. But she didn\u2019t have the character to go on like I did.\u201d * * * So many promising footballers fall by the wayside. Fewer than 0.5% of the kids in English academies at the age of nine make it as professionals at any level. So what is character? \u201cIt\u2019s will. It\u2019s saying no to fun stuff. At 17, 18, a new social life is beginning, people are going out, having fun with friends, and you have to say no.\u201d That must be hard? \u201cIt is, and that\u2019s why many people fall down at that stage. You have to become an adult quickly in football. When you start playing with the first team, you\u2019re living with 30-, 35-year-olds; people with kids. It\u2019s not easy and you need to learn that quickly, because if you don\u2019t, you fall out. Elite sport is brutal.\u201d Did he find it tough as a teen? \u201cYes. I also missed part of my life because I went away from 14. We\u2019d play on a Saturday, then I would go home to see my parents and on Sunday evening I\u2019d travel back. So I missed the whole social part of my life.\u201d Was he jealous of his friends? \u201cNot at that time. Maybe afterwards. Later, when you experience things, you think perhaps it would have been fun to be doing this when everybody else was.\u201d It was his decision to leave home at 14: he was desperate to play football, and his parents were supportive.  I ask if the story about being dumped by his foster family is true. \u201cYes,\u201d he says. \u201cThere were three of us and the other two were more sociable. At summer break I said bye to the family and went home. Then my parents told me, you\u2019re not going back, they don\u2019t want you any more.\u201d He says the foster family never said anything directly, but told his parents they didn\u2019t want him because he was too quiet, too difficult, a teenager who didn\u2019t fit in. To add insult to injury, Genk told him he had to go to boarding school instead. In Belgium, boarding schools are more for problematic than privileged students. \u201cI really didn\u2019t want to do it.\u201d Did that rejection make him question his character? \u201cNo. I thought I\u2019m going to push more and show them. I said to my parents, I will do good, you\u2019ll see. I\u2019ll be in the first team quickly, then everything will change.\u201d There is a YouTube film about De Bruyne that depicts his life as a triumph over tragedy. \u201cRight from the beginning he was abandoned by his foster family,\u201d it says. \u201cAnd still life didn\u2019t stop hitting him with tragedy after tragedy.\u201d It goes on to document how the 20-year-old signed for Chelsea in a \u00a37m deal and played only three Premier League games before being sold as a flop.  Has he seen the film? \u201cNo.\u201d In the film, it mentions a match in which he came on as a half-time substitute and scored five goals. Every goal, it says, was a way of answering the foster family: \u201cOne goal, they don\u2019t want you any more. Two goals, too quiet. Three goals, too difficult. Four goals, they don\u2019t want you any more. Five goals, because of who you are.\u201d When I describe this, he turns a pinker shade of pink. \u201cThat\u2019s not true. I don\u2019t know who said that, but it\u2019s not true. I find that a little bit embarrassing, to be fair.\u201d Now he\u2019s laughing. \u201cMy life wasn\u2019t that bad, to be honest!\u201d  De Bruyne says too much was made of his time at Chelsea when he left, and too much was made when he returned to the Premier League a couple of years later with Manchester City. \u201cWhen I came here people said, \u2018Chelsea reject.\u2019 No, I was just a young boy who didn\u2019t play and was there for six months. I was really young.\u201d Leaving Chelsea was the making of him. He signed for Bundesliga club Wolfsburg in 2014 for \u00a318m, ended the 2014-15 season with 16 goals and 27 assists in all competitions and was named Germany\u2019s footballer of the year. In August 2015, Manchester City signed him for \u00a355m. Those who remembered his unhappy time at Chelsea couldn\u2019t believe how much City paid for him. Former Liverpool player Phil Thompson said: \u201cThe world is going mad. The amount of money they\u2019re paying for this boy is just absolutely bonkers.\u201d But it turned out to be a bargain. In four of his seven seasons, he has been voted player of the season, and City have won the Premier League four of the past five seasons. In 2017-18 they became the first (and still only) club to get 100 points in a season and the following season won an unprecedented clean sweep of domestic trophies. Eight months after De Bruyne arrived at City, Pep Guardiola became manager. It was the catalyst for the club\u2019s greatest run in its history. For most of my life as a City fan, I was used to nothing but failure; between 1976 and 2011 the club didn\u2019t win a trophy. Thanks to huge investment from its UAE owners, the signing of great players and arguably the best manager in the world, City have dominated the Premier League for the past decade.  As supporters, I say, we love everything our owners have done for the club, but some/many of us do worry about the UAE\u2019s human rights record. Does it bother him? \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know too much about that. All I can say is when we speak to people from the Emirates, they\u2019re all really good and polite. I can only speak highly of them, especially Khaldoon [chairman Khaldoon al-Mubarak]. You speak to him and he\u2019s a normal person.\u201d I ask Lacroix if De Bruyne finds it easy to turn off from football. \u201cYes. He comes home and it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh my God, I need a break\u2019, so he\u2019ll watch NBA or Formula One. If he\u2019s injured and City plays, me and the kids just leave him alone in front of the television, because when something goes wrong he shouts. I\u2019m like, nothing is going to change, then he shouts at us, and I\u2019m like, OK, let him just watch the game, and after he\u2019s like, sorry!\u201d De Bruyne has never been sent off for City. But there is a famous clip of him losing it with his teammates at the end of a Champions League match against Napoli in 2017 when he wants to confront the referee. De Bruyne, at his pinkest, shouts \u201cLet me talk\u201d five times. Every time his voice gets louder and more high-pitched. In the end, he sees sense and walks away. I ask Lacroix to do an impression of him getting angry. \u201cOne time when he was injured he threw a bottle of water on the floor with full strength. He couldn\u2019t walk but still managed to get up to the television to shout at it.\u201d \u201cI just want my team to win,\u201d De Bruyne says meekly. * * * Suddenly the door bursts open and Spider-Man flies into the room. He removes his head gear, and it\u2019s Mason. \u201cAre you going to answer questions?\u201d Lacroix asks. \u201cNo,\u201d Mason says. Is it true you\u2019re more interested in playing piano than football, I ask. \u201cYes,\u201d he says. Despite City\u2019s domestic success, they have yet to win the Champions League, the most prestigious club tournament in Europe. How important does De Bruyne think it is? \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s that important. It would be nice, but I think it\u2019s more from the outside. It\u2019s a stick people can beat City with. \u2018Oh, you\u2019ve done this but you haven\u2019t done this.\u2019 OK, but we\u2019ve still done really good.\u201d Who are his best friends at City? \u201cI would say probably Kyle Walker and Nathan Ak\u00e9.\u201d That\u2019s surprising, I say. Walker seems quite different from you. (Walker was splashed across the front pages of the tabloids after hosting a party with sex workers during lockdown.) \u201cNot really,\u201d De Bruyne says. Is that the media? \u201cI don\u2019t know about media. Obviously there have been issues in the past for him. But from day one I have been close to Kyle and he has three kids and they play with my kids.\u201d   I ask about Belgium\u2019s chances in Qatar, wondering if he\u2019ll be more diplomatic this time. But he\u2019s not. \u201cI think our chance was 2018. We have a good team, but it is ageing. We lost some key players. We have some good new players coming, but they are not at the level other players were in 2018. I see us more as outsiders.\u201d De Bruyne, at 31, is at his peak. It\u2019s hard to imagine him playing with such pace for much longer. Does he feel it\u2019s getting tougher? \u201cI am fully able to do what I need to do, but I feel the difference compared with eight years ago. I need more treatment, more rest.\u201d \u201cWhen he was younger, the day after a game he\u2019d be like, \u2018We can go and play tennis,\u2019\u201d Lacroix says. \u201cNow the day after he\u2019s like, \u2018I need to rest. My body hurts.\u2019\u201d Lacroix says football has brought her the lifestyle she dreamed of. The only difference is she had always imagined she would make her own money. What\u2019s the worst thing about being a footballer\u2019s wife? Often she feels like a single parent, she says. \u201cFor example, Kevin has never been to one school nativity. I\u2019m always the parent on their own. It\u2019s rare he can go to something for them. Two of the kids are at school, so we only have weekends to do things with them, but Kevin is playing then. It makes it harder to do stuff together as a family. Kevin always says now we need to be disciplined for football and later we can enjoy everything together.\u201d Does she think when he retires that will be her time to pursue her dreams? \u201cThat\u2019s what everyone keeps saying. But I don\u2019t think so now. I\u2019m devoted to being with the kids, and I\u2019ve just started the podcast.\u201d   \u201cShe\u2019s the glue,\u201d he says out of nowhere. Then he looks embarrassed. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say that because tonight she\u2019ll say, \u2018My God, look what you\u2019ve said.\u2019\u201d Lacroix: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t do that. I do not.\u201d \u201cYes, you would,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I said you were the glue to the family, you\u2019d say, \u2018Remember you said that.\u2019\u201d Do you mean Mich\u00e8le would use it against you? Lacroix: \u201cNoooooooo.\u201d De Bruyne: \u201cOf course!\u201d Lacroix: \u201cHe\u2019s making it up!\u201d They seem to have a lovely relationship.  I ask if he is planning for life after playing? She looks at him, curious to hear the answer: \u201cHe gets annoyed when I ask about it. \u2018I\u2019m still playing!\u2019\u201d De Bruyne: \u201cNot really.\u201d Lacroix: \u201cYou do a bit.\u201d De Bruyne: \u201cWell, I do things to advance the future. I\u2019ve got my Uefa A and B coaching qualification already.\u201d Does he think he\u2019ll stay in football? De Bruyne: \u201cProbably, yes.\u201d Lacroix: \u201c100%. Kevin loves football way too much to not be in it. He should because it\u2019s in his heart as well.\u201d But he could simply retire, live a life of luxury, make up for lost time on the self-indulgence and dossing front. \u201cIt would never happen,\u201d Lacroix says. \u201cGive him one month, then he would be annoyed. When Covid started he was running around the sofa. I couldn\u2019t cope with him at home.\u201d * * * They go to have their photos taken. I stay in the office staring at his platoon of man of the match awards. I pop in to see how the shoot is going. De Bruyne is trying to juggle all three children in his arms and I\u2019m worried he may get injured. I\u2019m not sure Pep would be happy. On the way out, I tell him that at away matches my daughter Maya and I get into the ground early when it\u2019s almost empty and shout for waves from the players when they come out to warm up. Nearly all have given us waves, but never De Bruyne. You\u2019re so intensely focused? \u201cI think so, yes. I\u2019m very different on the pitch to when I\u2019m here. Once I\u2019m playing football it\u2019s a different zone. Then when I\u2019ve finished, the game is done.\u201d For many years, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo were the undisputed two best players in the world. But things are changing. In August, De Bruyne was runner-up in the Uefa Men\u2019s Player of the Year award, won by another oldie, Karim Benzema. How important is it to be regarded as one of the best in the world? The quiet, diffident De Bruyne looks at me with magnificent imperiousness. \u201cIt\u2019s not important to be regarded as one of the best,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to be the best.\u201d The next few weeks with Belgium at the World Cup will provide the perfect stage for him to prove that he is.  \u2022 This article was amended on 26 November 2022. Kevin De Bruyne\u2019s club at the age of eight was KVV Drongen, not \u201cDrogen\u201d as an earlier version said; and his wife Mich\u00e8le\u2019s surname is Lacroix rather than LaCroix."

                    "body": "Will it be a merry Christmas? It will certainly be one of the most uncertain ever for businesses. Inflation, the war in Ukraine and an erratic new cabinet are only adding to the jitters around Covid. And who knows whether England and Wales will bring joy or pain to football fans during the World Cup in Qatar. Retailers were already feeling nervous before Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng launched their mini-budget for growth \u2013 and sent the pound into freefall and mortgage rates soaring. The industry may have bought its stock for the peak trading season, so the fall in the value of the pound will not affect prices or profits until next year. The main short-term concern before Christmas, when most consumer industries make the majority of their profits, will be consumer sentiment and spending power. A pause in house sales, as uncertainty about interest rates puts the freeze on deals and clips buyers\u2019 wings, is likely to mean a further slowdown for related businesses, from estate agents and builders to furnishing stores and DIY retailers, who are already suffering after the boom in home improvement during the lockdowns. Those in rented accommodation may also fear rising costs as landlords increase their demands to cover more expensive borrowing. Talk of potential benefits cuts, and the impact of the cuts already implemented, mean even more pressure for those on a tight budget. They will be watching every penny, fuelling a further switch to discounters such as Aldi and Lidl and putting more pressure on traditional supermarkets to keep prices down, so hastening the decline of ailing chains Morrisons and Waitrose. Over the summer, consumers have chosen to prioritise nights out and dressing for the occasion and trimmed spending on other non-essentials such as subscriptions and homewares. Spending on expensive items such as furniture, which saw huge growth during the lockdowns, is also down. Shoppers are meanwhile making their weekly food budget stretch by skipping the little extras and trading down to supermarket own labels or the discount chains. Those first signs of changing behaviour come as the spare cash left after paying for essentials plummeted 10% in August for the average family, with the decline deepening to 16.5% among the least affluent, according to consultancy Retail Economics. Outstanding net credit card debt has risen on average by 0.9% per month since the start of the year \u2013 well above the 0.1% growth in the decade leading up to the pandemic. Purse strings are only likely to tighten further over the autumn as the heating is switched on and long-feared energy bills hit doormats. Consumers will be forced to make even tougher choices. Clothing, homewares, nights out and trips away must all be on the list of budget cuts for many households. Supermarkets may start to benefit as meals out are swapped for \u201cfakeaways\u201d such as the family dine-in offer from Marks &amp; Spencer, which feeds four people for \u00a315. Non-essential retailers may have had a decent summer and a shift to lower rent deals during the pandemic, but their reserves have been hit by lockdowns, while the government has yet to deal with the problem of high and out-of-step business rates. The Truss-Kwarteng plan was supposed to boost household spending power by offering help with energy bills and cutting taxes. Their efforts were intended to increase disposable cash because of the energy price cap support, and some retailers have expressed hope that consumers will be reassured. As Simon Wolfson, the boss of Next, pointed out last week, households have more savings than they did pre-pandemic and the rate of unemployment is low and almost matched by vacancies. However, soaring mortgage rates, the collapse in the value of the pound and volatility in the stock market are likely to spread a general feeling of economic malaise and fear about the future, which could lead to caution over festive spending. Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, sums it up: \u201cThe cost of living crisis and shock to housing affordability will make life extremely difficult to swathes of households as we head into 2023. Peak trading will be incredibly tough and is likely to push many in the industry to breaking point.\u201d"

Steve Clarke\u2019s team got right up in Ukraine\u2019s grille on Wednesday like the genetically spliced progeny of Valeriy Lobanovskyi and Irvine Welsh, and now the whole world wants to hitch its wagon to the runaway train that is Scottish football. One example of this craze \u2013 admittedly the only example, but trends have to start somewhere \u2013 is that of spanking new (est.2022) Sheffield &amp; Hallamshire County Senior Football League Division Two side Doncaster City, who have made an application to the SFA to play in next season\u2019s Scottish Cup and yes this is a slow news day even by the standards of your average international break.\nCity, who are backed by Mr 15% Willie McKay and sponsored by large-mug-and-other-tat vendors Sports Direct, have ambitious plans to build a \u201chub of football for the north of England\u201d incorporating training pitches, accommodation, entertainment and a canteen. The hope is that big teams from the south, abroad, That London, etc, will fly into Doncaster Sheffield airport when playing up north and pitch camp with them. A sound business idea, we\u2019re sure you and at least two other Dragons will agree, but they\u2019re not going to stop there. City are also planning to do some football of their own, and to this end, ineligible for the FA Cup as a tier-13 side \u2013 only level nine gets into the velvet bag \u2013 they\u2019re trying to wheedle their way into the SFA\u2019s equally luxurious sack, arguing Donny is in fact part of Scotland.\nThis is indeed as stupid as it sounds, but nevertheless has a vague connection to reality. Back in 1136, King Stephen of England and King David I of Scotland stopped hoying clods of earth at each other\u2019s head and signed a peace treaty. David was given Carlisle, Cumberland, Lancashire, that nice service station that has a farmers\u2019 shop just off the M6 and Doncaster, and though nearly all of it was later taken back, Donny was never formally returned to English possession. So you can see where City are going with this. A smart plan, albeit one that appears doomed to failure, given their membership of the English FA means they don\u2019t meet the entry requirements of the Scottish Cup. They could of course still do a Berwick Rangers, throwing their lot in with the authorities across the border, citing Steve and Dave\u2019s 1136 treaty, and take things from there \u2026 but The Fiver advises them to keep their counsel for a couple more days at least. See how the Republic O\u2019Ireland fare at Hampden on Saturday, for a start. Maybe the clamour to grab a piece of that hot Scottish action will have suddenly died down.\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\n\u201cThey love to talk about the old days, the man are old like \u2018Annie, are you OK?\u2019, I prefer not to speak like I\u2019m Jos\u00e9\u201d \u2013 Roma boss Jos\u00e9 Mourinho makes a natural progression into UK rap, bringing dad vibes to Stormzy\u2019s video for new track \u2018Mel Made Me Do It\u2019.\n\nFIVER LETTERS\n\u201cSo, a few weeks on a Harvard business course qualifies Mark Noble as a new sporting director of West Ham (yesterday\u2019s Quote of the Day). It now appears the Hammers finally have a long-range plan in place. Very long range, in fact\u201d \u2013 John Weldon.\n\u201cAs an Everton fan, I can only rejoice in the news of Hair Transplant Clinic sponsorship (yesterday\u2019s Commercial Deal of the Day). Forget winning the league. But at long last it\u2019s going to be possible to see the whole team, manager and coaches all sporting home-grown double Mohicans, perhaps reintroducing a mullet at the rear, and maybe knee-length beards, assuming the magic hair ointment works on chins. All tastefully dyed blue and white, obviously. It\u2019s what we\u2019ve all been waiting for. Although I do wonder if they will be ditching the club crest for a before-and-after bald eagle? Surely Crystal Palace would have something to say about that\u201d \u2013 Steve Malone.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t give Noble Francis one of the jobs you advertised recently, can you at least give him a prize? The poor lad\u2019s been writing in every day and must be gutted when the letter o\u2019 the day goes to someone else.

The Spanish Federation is being as masculine as you\u2019d expect in its response, huffing that the players would not play again until they \u201cadmit their error and apologise\u201d.\nGareth Southgate is sticking with Harry Maguire, whether you like it or not. \u201cIt\u2019s important to back our best players. Whatever reputation I have, I\u2019m putting it on [the line] there,\u201d honked the England boss, perhaps overplaying the importance of Nations League matches.\n\nMansfield have changed the Saturday kick-off time for next month\u2019s match against Walsall from 3pm to 1pm due to the ongoing energy crisis. \u201c[This] will enable the club to discern whether significant savings can be made on floodlight usage,\u201d said a suit.\nManchester United\u2019s wage bill has hit a record high of \u00a3384.2m, with the club\u2019s \u00a3200m summer splurge on shiny new players not helping.\nAnd despite being harshly sent off in the win over Wales, Roberto Mart\u00ednez is still focusing on how to spread those upbeat Bobby M vibes through the Belgium camp. \u201cIt may have been yellow, but never red,\u201d he yelped. \u201c[Eden Hazard] told me that, in Belgium, you have to pay for a dinner party with a red card. I will do that.\u201d\nMURALS CORNER\nA picture of Pep Guardiola painted on a house near the Etihad Stadium has been defaced with \u201cMUFC\u201d graffiti, a day after it was completed. Meanwhile, J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s massive face has been etched on to the gable end of possibly the last remaining terraced house in Anfield that had yet to receive the scouse fresco treatment. \u201cKlopp\u2019s the next best thing,\u201d honked the owner, who said she\u2019d have rather had Kevin Keegan on the side of her gaff.\n\nSTILL WANT MORE?\nForm, formation and Phil Foden.

                    "body": "Steve Clarke set his sights on the 2026 World Cup as soon as it was apparent Scotland would not feature in Qatar this year. The manager is aware staying in his position until that time is most likely dependent on qualifying for the European Championship which falls in between. Ukraine\u2019s 3-1 success at Hampden Park in midweek ended Scotland\u2019s latest World Cup dream; their wait to appear on international football\u2019s grandest stage will stretch to at least 28 years. \u201cI need them,\u201d said Clarke of his players. \u201cI want them to help me because I want to go to a World Cup with my country and I told them that after the game.  \u201cI said to them: \u2018I can\u2019t do that unless you get me to Euro 2024.\u2019 So they can help me. That is serious. I would love to do it. It was a big ambition to go this year, it hasn\u2019t worked. I would love to go in 2026 but results and circumstances will dictate what happens. But this group of players, whether they are led by me or someone else, definitely can go to 2024 and 2026. \u201cThere are actually enough in the group that are young enough to even think beyond that. I am too old to think beyond that. I will just think to 2026.\u201d If Clarke had ambitions of being a club manager once more, they have been pushed to one side. Scotland\u2019s players were given some time off this weekend, with Clarke hoping to oversee a reset before Armenia visit Glasgow in the Nations League on Wednesday. Analysis of where it all went wrong against Ukraine can wait. \u201cWe had shown a resilience before,\u201d added Clarke.  \u201cI keep telling you, this is a good group of players who want to be successful for their country. When you have got that, you are looking to bounce back in the next game, you are looking to do well and you are looking to start the next unbeaten run.\u201d Scotland were eight matches without defeat before Ukraine\u2019s success. External attention \u2013 and none of it positive \u2013 surrounded Clarke\u2019s decision to partner Ch\u00e9 Adams with Lyndon Dykes in attack. The move failed to pay off, with Dykes replaced by Ryan Christie at half-time. \u201cI have some ideas of where it went wrong on the night,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cPeople will throw different things around. Tactical, mental, preparation-wise \u2013 all those things are out there. But it\u2019s probably a combination of things. We certainly didn\u2019t play as well as we could. \u201cOn the tactical side, people will say: \u2018Why did you play two up front?\u2019 Twelve games ago you were all asking me why I didn\u2019t play two up front. That\u2019s the reality. You can mix and match. No one questioned the two up front against Austria away and England at Wembley. It was more about we just didn\u2019t play to our capacity on Wednesday night. And that might be hard for people to accept but that is the fact of the matter. We did not play as well as we could play.\u201d  To his credit, Clarke refused to speculate on whether Scotland would have been in a stronger position to contest a playoff semi-final in March, the original timing of the Ukraine tie. \u201cThe best way to answer that is not to answer that, if that makes sense, and say: \u2018Look, we lost to Ukraine in June,\u2019\u201d Clarke said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to suffer that. We have to take that massive disappointment. Nobody is hiding away from that. We didn\u2019t perform on the night and we have to live with that, but move on.\u201d Injuries mean Clarke is likely to field a much-changed starting XI for the Armenia clash. The teams meet again on Tuesday week, after Scotland face the Republic of Ireland in Dublin."

                    "body": "Did a pair of painfully pale performances against Iran signal the beginning of the end for Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey? It was the elephant in the room after Wales\u2019s defeat on Friday but Rob Page quickly swallowed the question and, such was the manager\u2019s disappointment after a jarring loss that left his team staring at elimination, insisted now was not the time. Page did, however, concede Wales were punished because too many key players allowed the occasion to pass them by.\nBale, Wales\u2019s all-time men\u2019s leading goalscorer and now their most-capped male player, is almost unanimously cherished as the team\u2019s greatest export. For a few years, regardless of the minutes he has totted up at club level, he has been able to pull on a Wales shirt, find a way to manipulate games and, frankly, make lots of people look silly. Perhaps he will do so again against England on Tuesday, but on recent evidence this tournament has been a strain. Ramsey should also have been sacrificed long before Wayne Hennessey was sent off against Iran with four minutes of normal time to play.\n\nIt is impossible to dress up how underwhelming Wales, and especially their protagonists, have been at their first World Cup for 64 years. Bale has offered next to nothing, except winning and then executing a penalty against USA. For the first 13 minutes against Iran, his only touch and sole contribution was taking kick-off. Ramsey went blond on the eve of the tournament, providing a promising parallel to when he dyed his hair for Euro 2016 in France, but against Iran he gave the ball away more than any other player on the pitch. Hennessey, among three centurions in the Wales squad, also endured a nightmare afternoon. Bale and Ramsey, though, have appeared stalked by the storied and uncharted success of yesteryear.\n\nThe manner in which Bale, 33, and Ramsey, almost 32, struggled to get around the pitch, labouring towards the ball in one breath and their opponent the next, should not have come as a surprise given the paucity of minutes they have played this year. Ramsey has started 10 league games in 2022; Bale just three \u2013 two games in five days looked a shock to the system. Bale, used to the luxury of a week to recover between matches at Los Angeles FC, admitted it took him a good while to feel his legs after going the distance against the USA, completing 104 minutes, and four days later he \u2013 just about \u2013 managed another 102 minutes. Before Monday, Bale had played 36 minutes since September.\n\nAt some point it was inevitable the music would stop. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem we always have, asking players who are not playing for their clubs to come and give performance after performance,\u201d Page said. \u201cWe are going to have to look at it and, if necessary, we\u2019ll have to make the changes to freshen it up.\u201d\nThe warning signs were there. Joe Allen, a tidy and reliable midfield anchorman, was painted as something of a messiah in some quarters upon news of his comeback from a hamstring injury. It is saying something when, with respect to Allen, Wales\u2019s hopes of turning the game on its head hinged on a 32-year-old who has spent the past five seasons in the Championship, his best days undeniably behind him. Allen replaced Ethan Ampadu on Friday in what, surprisingly, was a like-for-like substitution. Suddenly, after more than two months on the sidelines, it was Allen\u2019s time to operate as the lone firefighter on an uncontrollable blaze. No wonder he also struggled, squandering possession in the buildup to both Iran\u2019s stoppage-time goals.\nPage\u2019s post-match demeanour was of a manager let down by senior players, but he will also surely ponder whether he made the right calls. Ampadu was valiant but swamped at the base of midfield. Joe Morrell, a regular under Page until Qatar, has been limited to playing 10 minutes of stoppage time against the USA but would surely have helped balance the midfield, and Page\u2019s determination to play Harry Wilson, Ramsey and Bale left his defence exposed. Joe Rodon was repeatedly having to fend off Iran forwards in one-on-one scenarios.\nIt is hard not to think Wales would have been better served with Bale drifting in from the right, with Kieffer Moore as a focal point down the middle and Daniel James, a dependable and tenacious winger, on the opposite flank. James arrived from the bench on Friday alongside Brennan Johnson, who has often provided Wales with a welcome zest as a substitute, even if too little too late. Johnson, who played for England Under-17s, surely has to start on Tuesday.\nEngland\u2019s draw with the USA gives Wales a sliver of hope of progressing, but the permutations required feel far-fetched. Wales must beat England \u2013 a feat they have not achieved since 1984 \u2013 and hope Iran and the USA play out a draw, otherwise they need to beat England by four goals.\nBefore England\u2019s stalemate on Friday, Page seemed resigned to his side\u2019s fate, unable to shake the gnawing sense that the end is nigh. \u201cWe want to finish the competition on a high,\u201d he said."

                    "body": "Well. 2022 wasn\u2019t exactly what we needed after nearly two years of intermittent lockdowns and continuing health anxieties during the Covid pandemic. What we could have done with was something soothing. Something calming, to give us all time to ease back into our normal lives. Last December I wrote my predictions for the coming year. I suggested that Boris Johnson would be kicked out of No 10 by the early summer and that Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss would emerge as the two frontrunners to become prime minister. I even said that Truss would go on to win as the Tory party were hellbent on proving they had a sense of humour. Satire rewriting itself as history. Only I was far too cautious. I never dreamed that Truss would only last a few weeks and that the man the party didn\u2019t want would become the MPs\u2019 new champion. Or that the economy would be the second worst performing in the G20. Or that British politics would reveal itself to be terminally dysfunctional. So this year I am going to skip the predictions. Safe in the knowledge that 2023 will almost certainly be far, far worse than anything you can imagine. Instead, let\u2019s reflect back on the past 12 months. U-turn of the year Where to start? You could take your pick from almost any member of the cabinet. At one point during the Tory leadership campaign, Nadhim Zahawi seemed to have given his unequivocal backing to at least three candidates simultaneously. But credit where credit is due and first place goes to Rishi Sunak for a series of rolling U-turns. Does Sunak think onshore windfarms are a good idea or not? Does he approve of building new homes on the green belt or not? Does he support an energy price cap or not? I could go on. At some point during the year Sunak has believed all these things; and their opposites. He is Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s prime minister. There and not there. So much so that he has had to qualify his absence of certainty. Everything he believed during the first leadership campaign he no longer necessarily still believes. Those beliefs were time specific. Besides, he lost that leadership bid so he\u2019s no longer still obliged to believe what he said he believed. Or something like that. Now he is free to reinvent himself. The whole point of Rishi is to believe nothing. Other than what is necessary for him to survive as prime minister for another week. Resignation of the year Again, so many to choose from. Boris Johnson\u2019s graceless departure from No 10. He still doesn\u2019t see that breaking the laws he made and lying to parliament disqualifies him, not just from the top job, but from any job in government. Then there was Liz Truss\u2019s emotional departure. Not to mention the 60 or so ministerial resignations that preceded Johnson\u2019s exit. But pride of place must go to Michelle Donelan who accepted the job of education secretary on 5 July after Johnson promoted Zahawi to chancellor. Only for her to resign less than two days later. Quite what happened in those few hours to change her mind is anyone\u2019s guess. Unless she was the only person in Westminster who thought Boris was a winner on the Tuesday and a loser on the Thursday. People would kill for political antennae as sharp as that. Death of the year Amid all the political upheavals, it\u2019s easy to forget that the queen died in September. Even though she was 96 years old, it still came as a profound shock. Almost as if we had allowed ourselves to believe she might somehow never die. That for her to die was unthinkable. The 10 days of mourning, culminating in the state funeral, brought out the best in the country. Bound people just that bit tighter. Her coffin descending into the crypt in Windsor was one of the defining images of the year. Her death reminded us all of other losses. Deaths not fully grieved. If any death can be said to be fully grieved. For most of us it is a never-ending process. My sister celebrates her 50th wedding anniversary this coming April. I asked her if she was having a party. \u201cNo,\u201d she replied. There would be too many empty spaces. I know how she feels. Woman of the year I was tempted to give the award to Liz Truss. No woman made a greater impact on the country. And when she looks back on her career, she won\u2019t ever die wondering. Just a shame she got just about everything wrong. But the honour goes to Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe for the resilience and dignity with which she endured being held prisoner in Iran. And for not bowing to the government\u2019s narrative when she was released. Zaghari-Ratcliffe clung tight to her own truth. That she had been badly let down by Johnson, who during a select committee hearing had carelessly accused her of teaching journalists. The government tried to claim her release as their victory; Nazanin wasn\u2019t having any of it. Man of the year A clear winner. Since 2019, the UK has voted \u2013 or rather in the case of Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, the Tory party and Tory MPs have voted \u2013 for a prime minister, and has found itself with a comedian. Ukraine did it the other way. They voted for a comic actor and ended up with a leader. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has been an inspiration, not just to Ukraine but to the rest of the world. He has held his country tight during the invasion and has defied most military analysts who had assumed that a Russian victory was inevitable. More than that, he has become the moral compass for the west. A leader we can all look up to when our own are found wanting. The Goat The Qatar World Cup left everyone feeling a little grubby \u2013 especially those, like myself, who had promised we would do our best to ignore it and then got hooked in by the football. Even when England\u2019s journey ended predictably enough in the quarter-finals \u2013 did people really imagine we would get any further? Yet it did resolve one issue to most people\u2019s satisfaction. The Greatest Of All Time. At least in the 21st century. Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo? There will be some who still think Ronaldo is the special one, the 37-year-old around whom any Premier League team ought to be building a squad of players. But Messi\u2019s performance in guiding Argentina to World Cup glory \u2013 even when, for long periods, he appeared to be doing it at a walking pace \u2013 will have sealed the deal for most people. He has now won every competition for club and country along with countless personal awards. And he seems like a decent bloke. Now to put him head to head with Pel\u00e9. Prophet of the year It\u2019s very tempting to give it to myself for last year\u2019s column. If only I had dared to be a bit wilder. Still, Matt Hancock is a more than worthy winner. Because it turns out that there is nothing he has ever got wrong. In his non-bestselling Pandemic Diaries \u2013 available for under \u00a31 at all good charity shops \u2013 Matt got all the big calls right. He spotted the Covid threat long before the Chinese and battled heroically to get Johnson and Dominic Cummings to take the virus more seriously. He also personally made billions of items of PPE in his spare time. It also may help that Matt has a rather unusual approach to keeping a diary. Rather than writing contemporaneously, he makes notes retrospectively by chatting some years later to a ghostwriter. His predictions for 2022, in which he foretold the exact day Russia would invade Ukraine and that he would come third on I\u2019m a Celebrity, have just been published. Banned word of the year No contest. It\u2019s now official. We are no longer allowed to use the word Brexit. The Conservatives have banned it because their government department devoted to exploring Brexit benefits has had to be wound up because no one had been able to find any. And it\u2019s also on Labour\u2019s proscribed list as the party thinks we should should not mention it before the next election as it may trigger \u201cred wall\u201d voters. So the fact that the country has taken a major hit to GDP and many leavers are having doubts are now thought crimes. Businesses going under have just failed to take advantage of the new opportunities of a shortage of labour and an increase in red tape. To mention Brexit is to talk the UK down. The morally bankrupt of the year Johnson will be gutted. The first time he hasn\u2019t won this award in nearly a decade. Though he did try. Delivering four second-rate speeches at \u00a3250,000 a pop in November while still having his accommodation bankrolled by the ever-generous Bamfords shows a complete disregard for how most of the country lives. Yet even Boris can\u2019t keep up with Michelle Mone, who has apparently trousered a share of \u00a329m from the profits of a firm that supplied unusable PPE. Keeping the aspidistra flying. The natural world Seeing a red squirrel in the wild has been a lifetime ambition. And this year, while spending a weekend on the Isle of Wight, I achieved it. Better still, I also saw a black squirrel. Heaven. 2022 wasn\u2019t all unbridled chaos."

                    "body": "Last week, after the Netherlands snatched victory in the 94th minute in Cardiff, Gareth Bale conceded that Wales must master the dark arts and add a streetwise streakif they are to prosper at their first World Cup in 64 years. After Memphis Depay rattled in a stoppage\u2011time winner here, seconds after Bale equalised from the penalty spot, it was an agonising case of deja vu. But even if another game against the same opposition ended in maddening fashion, succumbing to defeat at the last for the second time in six days, Wales may be the only of the home nations to come out of the past fortnight of never-ending matches with any discernible credit.  Twenty minutes before kick\u2011off the stadium announcer made a point of congratulating Wales on reaching Qatar 2022 and while they appear generally in rude health, this was another galling denouement. Bale, who entered from the bench with 20 minutes to play, levelled two minutes into added time but Depay, also a substitute, feasted on some sloppy defending to render Wales\u2019s comeback worthless. Brennan Johnson\u2019s second nerveless finish in four days had pulled a goal back after the Netherlands raced into a two-goal lead courtesy of Noa Lang and Cody Gakpo. Afterwards, Bale could be forgiven for thinking he was repeating himself. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to take but I\u2019d rather this happen now and we address it than it happen at the World Cup,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to use these Nations League games to improve and get better. I was saying in the changing room, we\u2019re in league A playing against big teams, and of course we are disappointed we conceded late, but we\u2019re competing with these big teams in every game now and it\u2019s just the finer details we need to iron out. If we can do that it will put us in a good place for the World Cup.\u201d Louis van Gaal has never been one to mince his words and so his criticism of De Kuip on the eve of this game was in keeping with his character. The Netherlands \u2013 and former Ajax \u2013 manager described Feyenoord\u2019s stadium as \u201ca load of old crap\u201d, a pristine pitch its only redeeming feature, and complained about having to do his half-time team talk against Poland last Saturday with his back to a dozen of his players owing to space constraints. However, his side certainly seem to enjoy playing here and it is now 30 matches without defeat in Rotterdam.  In the buildup to the first goal the Ipswich wing-back Wes Burns, who was replaced by Connor Roberts at the break, was guilty of overcomplicating things, allowing Jordan Teze to turn over possession. Vincent Janssen located Lang and he swivelled clear of Chris Mepham and Joe Rodon before leathering in. Six minutes later Gakpo curled in after his initial shot pinballed off Rodon and then Mepham and kindly into his path. But Wales, all in yellow, responded when Daniel James pickpocketed Teze high up the pitch. Harry Wilson slipped in Johnson, who took the pass in his stride before nonchalantly stroking a first\u2011time finish through the legs of Matthijs de Ligt, across the goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen and into the far pocket of the Netherlands net.  In the absence of Bale and Aaron Ramsey, who arrived with 63 minutes on the clock, Johnson was Wales\u2019s go-to player and caused mischief throughout. But Bale slotted in from 12 yards when Tyrell Malacia upended Roberts in the box, only for Depay to have the final say after Wales showed a softness in defence as the game ticked into the third minute of stoppage time. \u201cWe didn\u2019t win the first header, we didn\u2019t win the second contact and you give teams like that and players like him [Depay] half a chance, it\u2019s in the back of the net,\u201d the Wales manager, Robert Page, said. \u201cThat\u2019s the learning curve for us. We have to be ruthless and see games out, so it is a lesson learnt. But in the camp overall, there\u2019s too many positives to be down about it.\u201d"

                    "body": "Argentina\u2019s last home game before the World Cup turned into an unexpected love-in at La Bombonera on Friday. The penultimate qualifier for the already qualified nation (they play Ecuador away in their last fixture) became the emotional send-off that is usually organised with that specific purpose but which the new calendar means will be impossible at a later point in the year. Asked after the game about his future with the national team post-Qatar, Lionel Messi replied with a \u201cwho knows\u201d, so potentially this was his last appearance on Argentinian soil wearing the oversized Argentinian strip, which ironically feels too small for him, at least in official competition.  It\u2019s been a long road and before featuring at his fifth World Cup, it was fitting Messi was embraced by the man who gave him his first call-up to the national team \u2013 Jos\u00e9 Pekerman, now manager of Venezuela. The pair hugged as they emerged from the tunnel and it was almost father-son in nature. Venezuela, already eliminated, put up some fight, especially during the first 20 minutes, during which Messi\u2019s deployment as a false No 9 had some nerves on edge. But the team soon adjusted and the Paris Saint-Germain player flourished in a more creative role. The Boca stadium, known as La Bombonera or the Chocolate Box because of its steep terraces, has a pretty unique atmosphere, and that was the case again on Friday. Filled to capacity, the crowd chanting in crescendo, a considerable number of women and children included among the maskless grinning faces, it exuded warmth and joy. The first goal was an explosion of ecstatic hugs, on the pitch as well as in the stands. By the time the third goal arrived, the entire ground was one single, delirious, sparkling feast, phone lights like stars peppering the night sky. It was also emotional. One father who had taken his sons to an Argentina game for the first time afterwards reflected that there is a younger generation who have always had an intense connection with this particular squad. \u201cThey have no pending issues, they love them,\u201d he said. Older followers who do have unresolved baggage emerged blissfully nostalgic, perhaps recognising those cherished sensations proffered by simultaneously experiencing hope and the satisfaction of enjoying the moment. It was at once a loving send-off and the beginning of the World Cup dream.  Boca fans familiar with the stadium wore their goose-pimples with pride, rival fans gracefully acknowledged the magic of the blue and yellow concrete surrounds, and those who weren\u2019t there shared the moment with poetic gratitude. \u201cThis Argentina side is the new Unicorn,\u201d tweeted the writer Roberto Mart\u00ednez. \u201cIt grows, enjoys, desires, are ambitious and everything they try, works\u201d. Some French journalists contrasted Messi\u2019s demeanour with his attitude at PSG \u2013 remarkable, really, when one looks back to a time when playing in front of the Argentina crowd seemed to be an unbearable burden, when he got booed playing at home and it seemed he could only muster his magic when featuring for Barcelona. Now the shift is visible to anyone paying attention: he is clearly relishing being the veteran orchestrator of the national side. The World Cup may or may not be a trophy Messi finally gets to lift later this year but the joy of playing for Argentina has undeniably returned for him. Against Venezuela, his range of skills and supernatural capacity to shift rhythm was there for all to see for the entire 90 minutes. He was explosive, fast, skilful, and detailed in his precision. He left opponents spinning, turned, flicked and then burst into speed again. Slouched shoulders and baggy long shorts, he stood clocking the entire field one minute and then executed what he had thought up at the speed of light the next. He initiated Nico Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s opening goal and then topped the night by scoring the third goal himself which was almost a misstep, seemingly laughing at himself while doing so.  The road to Qatar has been bumpy at times, but a generation of Pekerman boys are now the men in charge and have delivered Argentina\u2019s longest undefeated run in decades. The manager, Lionel Scaloni, assistants Pablo Aimar and Walter Samuel, the youth team manager, Javier Mascherano, all at the helm and all, like Messi, exchanged warm greetings with their former manager on Friday. It was a collective show of respect and dignity, the symbolic passing of the torch from master to pupils and a literal display of how the game lives and moves on, tradition forging in real time. Life in Argentina is tough, economically and socially. As is the case elsewhere, Covid has taken its toll. And so football has once again become the thing the nation turns to for joy, for a release. And nothing encapsulates that better than the sight of Messi in national team colours with a ball at feet and, once again, a smile on his face."

                    "body": "England\u2019s Euros winner Beth Mead has called for fresh research into why so many elite women footballers are suffering serious knee injuries, saying it would be taken more seriously if Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo were affected. The 27-year-old striker ruptured her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) last month and her partner, fellow Arsenal player Vivianne Miedema, did the same in a match last week. Five of the top 20 women\u2019s Ballon d\u2019Or players are currently sidelined with ACL injuries, including Mead, Miedema and the world\u2019s best player, Spain\u2019s Alexia Putellas. Mead said \u201cthere doesn\u2019t seem to be a lot going on\u201d to understand why women appear to be four to six times more likely to suffer an ACL injury than male footballers. She added: \u201cI think if that happened with a Messi, a Ronaldo, a Griezmann there\u2019s probably going to be a lot more done when those things happen.\u201d  Mead had an operation on her knee two weeks ago and said she had not given up on playing in next summer\u2019s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. At least 10 Women\u2019s Super League players are out of action with ACL injuries sustained since the summer, including Aston Villa\u2019s Simone Magill and Chantelle Boye-Hlorkah, Tottenham\u2019s Kyah Simon and Ellie Brazil, and West Ham\u2019s Jessica Ziu. Mead, 27, said she believed new research was needed and that she and Miedema were keen to be involved: \u201cUnfortunately this has happened to us but hopefully it can kick somebody up the arse to go on and start doing something.\u201d Mead, who fired England to their history-making Euros win in summer, spoke after winning the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award at a ceremony at MediaCity in Salford on Wednesday night, where she appeared on crutches and limped heavily when collecting her prize. Sarina Wiegman, the Lionesses manager who won coach of the year at the BBC awards, said Fifa, Uefa and federations across the world \u201chave to do something\u201d about the ACL issue because the \u201cdemands of the game on the top players are getting higher and higher\u201d. She added: \u201cWe also have commercial things so I don\u2019t think it is so easy to change schedules but we have to find a way because now we get too many injuries. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been that much research about women\u2019s football. Women are built differently to men, the hips and the knees are different, the angles are different. There\u2019s lots of research in the men\u2019s game not the women\u2019s game.\u201d The Football Association said its research had concluded that ACL issues accounted for 1.3% of all injuries in the top two tiers of women\u2019s football in the past four seasons \u2013 comparable, it said, to the rate in men\u2019s football. It is understood the FA plans to release the study early in the new year."
