The Socceroos had just pulled one back to give themselves renewed hope when the left-back channelled his inner-Messi and went on a marauding, weaving run that carried him past one defender, in between another two, all the way into the opposition box, and then back inside a fourth man in blue and white stripes to get a clear sight of the Argentinian goal.  Behich\u2019s right foot swung at the ball; glory and a place in the annals of Australia sporting history awaited. Sadly, Lisandro Mart\u00ednez had other ideas. His brilliant last-ditch tackle blocked the effort, and Australia ultimately went home.  Garang Kuol\u2019s nearly moment Included in Graham Arnold\u2019s squad for his potential as an \u201cimpact player\u201d off the bench, the 18-year-old came within a whisker of living up to his billing on the biggest of stages. Having made his World Cup debut as a substitute in the opener against France (becoming the youngest Socceroo since Harry Kewell in 1996) Kuol was then brought on against Argentina in the last-16 game (becoming the youngest player to feature in the knockout stage of a World Cup since Pel\u00e9 in 1958). His moment arrived deep in stoppage time after a deft first touch to control Craig Goodwin\u2019s cross allowed him to roll Nicol\u00e1s Tagliafico and tee up a shooting opportunity. Score and Australia would send the match to extra-time. But, like Behich 15 minutes earlier, he was denied by an outstretched Argentine limb, this time the arm of Emiliano Mart\u00ednez. Nevertheless, it was a brilliant piece of skill and a truly memorable moment, one which alerted the world to Kuol\u2019s talents and signals a bright future. Arnold has suggested the advent of a new golden generation, and Kuol is likely at the heart of it.  Federation Square lights up Football in Australia, we are told, is a minority sport. No one cares about football any more. The domestic leagues are on a downward spiral. There\u2019s no way football can \u2013 or will \u2013 ever compete with other codes. The game, at the professional level at least, is dying a slow and painful death. And yet. And yet the Socceroos\u2019 run in Qatar captivated a nation for the past two weeks, hauled football back on to the front pages and breakfast TV, prompted Socceroos scarves to be proudly displayed in parliament, and even had the prime minister tweeting about it. Of course much of this novel interest is from once-every-four-year blow-ins, but the scenes in Melbourne for the 2am kick-off against Tunisia \u2013 with thousands in attendance in the dead of night \u2013 gave a reminder that football\u2019s heart is still beating in Australia. The question now for the game is how to harness that passion and dedication to bring a sleeping giant into the mainstream.  Four Australian goals to enjoy It took just nine minutes for the Socceroos to open their account in Qatar. Craig Goodwin\u2019s well-taken goal stunned defending world champions France and while the euphoria of leading the defending champions in a World Cup match lasted just 18 minutes, it would not be the last time Australia found the back of the net. Mitch Duke\u2019s perfectly executed header did for Tunisia before Mat Leckie\u2019s wonderful jinking solo effort secured passage from Group D by the same 1-0 scoreline. Craig Goodwin did the heavy lifting for Australia\u2019s final goal of the tournament against Argentina, although his deflected strike went down as an Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez own-goal. It was the first time Australia have scored in every game of a World Cup finals campaign, and only once have they scored more \u2013 in 2006 Tim Cahill (two), John Aloisi, Craig Moore and Harry Kewell made it five in total \u2013 and each goal in Qatar was savoured with just as much gusto as in Germany.  Graham Arnold gets his dues The coach was nearly out of a job not so long ago, having overseen a slump in form that extended the long and winding road to qualification for Qatar via the tortuous playoff route.  He might still be out of a job, despite everything achieved at the finals, given his contract is up and Football Australia has yet to confirm if he\u2019ll be offered a new deal. But what Arnold has ensured with his team\u2019s run to the last 16 is that he has proved the doubters wrong.  No one can argue with the bare fact that he guided a Socceroos side to the last 16 of a World Cup for just the second time. And he did so by getting the best out of a group of players far less feted than their predecessors in 2006. Time will tell if this latest crop will prove to be the country\u2019s next \u201cgolden generation\u201d but for now, Arnold \u2013 who gloriously said after the win over Denmark, \u201cNo celebrations, no emotion. Sleep, no social media\u201d \u2013 may now allow himself a moment to reflect on a hugely satisfying campaign."

                    "body": "A little-discussed dilemma of the LGBTQ experience is foreign travel. For many opposite-sex couples, exploring the world together is one of their great bonding experiences, teeming with adventure and generating a lifetime of soppy memories. For LGBTQ couples, this experience is rather more fraught. There are, after all, 69 countries where homosexuality is prohibited altogether, 11 of which can enforce the death penalty for same-sex attraction. In many other countries \u2013 take your pick: Indonesia, Russia, Madagascar \u2013 being gay may be legal, but that doesn\u2019t preclude widespread discrimination and stigma. Booking a shared hotel room for you and your partner, or worries about public behaviour outing you as a romantic item, may deter you from most countries\u2019 borders. As for traveling solo to somewhere like Egypt \u2013 now hosting COP27 \u2013 you\u2019d do so likely knowing that authorities there have used dating apps to entrap and persecute LGBTQ people. Qatar is one of those 69 countries where same-sex relations are forbidden. And yet this did not deter Fifa from awarding the Middle Eastern monarchy this year\u2019s men\u2019s World Cup back in 2010. Despite the regime\u2019s claims that LGBTQ fans are welcome, some hotels will refuse to accommodate LGBTQ couples, and the country\u2019s ruling emir made it clear that officials \u201cexpect and want people to respect our culture\u201d. This monarch has found an ally in the British government, as the foreign secretary, James Cleverly, demanded that LGBTQ fans be \u201crespectful of the host nation\u201d. Whether this meant avoiding public displays of affection, or excessively flamboyant twerking to Kylie in a tight white vest, was unclear.  That Qatar was granted this honour with no consideration for the rights of LGBTQ people speaks for itself. It\u2019s not as if it\u2019s a great footballing nation \u2013 it clearly isn\u2019t \u2013 and its successful bid was mired in accusations of corruption. Despite its protestations, in a choice between LGBTQ rights and profit, Fifa is clearly more committed to the latter. Regimes that brutalise their own people are enthusiastic about hosting great sporting events in large part because they believe it will shore up their reputations. If this was Qatar\u2019s intention, it has failed: rarely has the run-up to a World Cup been so sapped of enthusiasm, and there has been unprecedented attention on the monarchy\u2019s human rights abuses. This week, a traumatising story about a gay man who claims he was entrapped on an app and subsequently raped by Qatar police officers was widely reported. Perhaps it would be educational for David Beckham \u2013 reportedly to be paid \u00a310m over the next decade to be an ambassador to Qatar so he can tell the world how \u201cwarm and welcoming\u201d it is \u2013 to meet this victim. But while the potential unease suffered by LGBTQ western tourists is important, the fact that thousands of migrant workers \u2013 some of whom will be LGBTQ, statistically speaking \u2013 have died in Qatar since it was awarded the World Cup deserves far more attention and fury. And while any attention being drawn to the plight of LGBTQ people in Qatar is welcome, should it really require a one-off global sports tournament for this to be the case? Qatar has been repressive while being a western ally for years. And nearby Saudi Arabia beheads people for being gay \u2013 as well as brutalising women, murdering dissidents, and slaughtering children in Yemen. Yet Britain and other western states back it to the hilt with arms and diplomatic support. Is the hosting of a sports tournament really the prerequisite for outrage? Perhaps more controversial, too, is how the global north uses \u201cpinkwashing\u201d \u2013 that is, trumpeting their own records on LGBTQ rights in contrast to other countries \u2013 to establish an ill-deserved moral superiority. The most striking example, of course, is Israel: the existence of LGBTQ rights is used to portray the state as a beacon of human rights, helping to deflect attention from, or even justify, its brutal occupation of the Palestinian people, the victims of which are straight and queer alike. And the fact that many states have poor records on LGBTQ rights because of the legacy of the British empire in particular \u2013 many African states enforce colonial-era laws \u2013 is airbrushed from the discussion altogether.  Focusing solely on the presence or absence of LGBTQ rights can deflect our attention from the wider picture. Given that the United States is jointly hosting the men\u2019s World Cup in 2026, what if we expressed our outrage at the country\u2019s use of mass incarceration, which leaves Black Americans nearly five times as likely to be behind bars as their white counterparts? Western states are also more likely to export their human rights abuses abroad, but does that make them less deserving of condemnation? When fans across the globe cheer on their teams in Boston\u2019s Gillette Stadium or Seattle\u2019s Lumen Field in four years\u2019 time, what if we remembered the hundreds of thousands slaughtered in the Iraq war, or the mass human rights abuses committed in the failed two-decade occupation of Afghanistan? It seems far easier to express revulsion at the brutal injustices committed in foreign lands than our own homes. This itself is part of the rationale of western hegemony. If we see our own nations as paragons of decency, and the rest of the world as brutal backwaters, we are less likely to scrutinise how western power affects the world. So yes, we should be clear: Fifa\u2019s actions appear to show it doesn\u2019t care about LGBTQ people and their rights \u2013 or at the very least, that it considers them secondary to other cynical calculations. But this is no different from the west at large, whose authorities were only forced to grant queer people their rights because of struggle and sacrifice from below, and which happily ally themselves to murderous anti-LGBTQ regimes abroad. Qatar\u2019s hosting of the World Cup 2022 deserves the derision it is receiving \u2013 but not at the expense of banishing consistency into exile.

                    "body": "One video shows an Egyptian football fan smiling serenely as an Israeli broadcaster introduces him live on air. Then he leans into the microphone with a message: \u201cViva Palestine.\u201d Another clip from the streets of Doha this week shows a group of Lebanese men walking away from a live interview with a reporter they have just learned is Israeli. One shouts over his shoulder: \u201cThere is no Israel. It\u2019s Palestine.\u201d As hundreds of thousands of people from around the world have poured into Qatar this week for the World Cup, these are among the awkward encounters between Arab football fans and Israeli journalists that have gone viral on Middle Eastern social media, one of many sources of political friction at a tournament that has not yet shaken off its myriad controversies. For the host country, staging the World Cup has involved delicate negotiations over the presence of LGBTQ+ fans, public displays of affection and the availability of beer and wine. Less prominent in the west, but no less fraught, has been the emirate\u2019s accommodation of Israeli football fans and media, a concession to Fifa\u2019s rules for hosting the multibillion-dollar tournament. Qatar does not have official ties with Israel but has given special permission for direct flights from Tel Aviv and allowed Israeli diplomats to be stationed at a travel agency in the country to give their nationals consular support. Conscious of domestic opinion, however, it has insisted the measures are strictly temporary and not steps towards a normalisation agreement of the kind signed by several other Arab states in recent years. Though neither Israel nor Palestine are playing in the tournament, the latter has featured prominently at the Middle East\u2019s first World Cup. Before Sunday\u2019s opening match, a phalanx of Qatari men marched into the Al Bayt Stadium chanting, \u201cEveryone is welcome,\u201d carrying with them a large Palestinian flag. \u201cWe are taking care of people in Palestine, and all Muslim people and Arab countries are holding up Palestinian flags because we\u2019re for them,\u201d the flag bearer told the Guardian.  Fans from Tunisia, Saudi Arabia and Algeria have also carried Palestinian flags prominently at matches and worn them as capes around their necks. On Thursday, Randa Ahmer, a young Palestinian woman, stood in Doha\u2019s bustling Souq Waqif holding a Palestinian flag above the international crowd. \u201cIt\u2019s our country, we\u2019re going to carry our flag everywhere,\u201d she said, as passersby shouted messages of support. Fifa trumpeted its agreement with Qatar to allow Israelis to fly to Doha by claiming the deal also allowed Palestinians to make the journey from Tel Aviv, but nearly a week into the tournament, it was unclear how many had been able to surmount the extensive Israeli security checks required to make the journey. Some of those who had made it to Qatar had come via Jordan or Egypt. As of the beginning of the tournament, nearly 4,000 Israeli and 8,000 Palestinian fans had received entry visas to Qatar, though Israel\u2019s foreign minister said it was expected as many as 20,000 Israelis could ultimately end up going. A kosher kitchen has been set up near Doha\u2019s airport to provide Israeli fans with a place to gather and food that conforms with religious requirements. Preparing to arrive in Doha over the weekend, Duby Nevo, an Israeli national, said he was watching the reports of Palestinian activism at the tournament with some concern. \u201cI hope that Qataris are welcoming and everything will be fine,\u201d he said. \u201cI really hope to meet people from all over the world and especially from Arabic countries \u2013 if they want to make friends. I just want to enjoy [the football], no conflicts whatsoever.\u201d Another Israeli man, who gave only his first name Bahaa, said the organisation of the tournament and atmosphere in the country were excellent, but there was one drawback: \u201cThe majority of the masses here do not accept the presence of Israelis.\u201d Others said they were finding a welcoming environment, but taking precautions. \u201cWe\u2019re not afraid to be here in Qatar as Israelis, they are very kind and we don\u2019t feel the politics between the countries,\u201d said Omer Laufer. \u201cSometimes we say that we are from Cyprus \u2013 but just to people from Arab countries.\u201d  As the viral videos have shown, it is Israeli media outlets that have borne the brunt of the lingering antipathy with which their country is regarded by Arab populations, even if many of their governments have now signed agreements acknowledging Israeli sovereignty, started building trade ties and brought their security cooperation out into the open. Israel\u2019s Channel 13 sports reporter Tal Shorrer told Associated Press that while his interactions with Qatari officials had been pleasant, he had been shoved and insulted by Palestinians and other Arab fans during his live broadcasts from the city. When a mobile phone seller noticed his friend\u2019s settings in Hebrew, Shorrer said the man exploded with anger, screaming at the Israeli to get out of the country. \u201cI was so excited to come in with an Israeli passport, thinking it was going to be something positive,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s sad, it\u2019s unpleasant. People were cursing and threatening us.\u201d On Friday, a reporter from Israel\u2019s public broadcaster Kan had a more enjoyable brush with fans, mobbed by jubilant Iranian supporters celebrating their 2-0 victory over Wales, who dressed him a jester\u2019s hat in the national colours while anchors back in the studio watched on, laughing.  Aware of the sensitivities of a tournament that will attract thousands of arrivals from hostile countries such as Iran, and where unlike in previous tournaments, all of the estimated 1.2 million foreign fans will be living cheek-by-jowl in one city, Israeli diplomats have produced videos asking their nationals to keep a low profile. \u201cDownplay your Israeli presence and Israeli identity for the sake of your personal security,\u201d said Lior Haiat, an Israeli diplomat, addressing fans."

Many Iranians fans in Iranian colours but not waving the flag of the Islamic Republic booed the anthem, as did some Welsh fans. Some Iranians carrying a flag with the words \u2018Women, Life, Freedom\u2019 \u2013 a slogan of the protests that began after the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody in September \u2013 were confronted in the stadium by security officials.\n\nSome fans wore shirts with Amini\u2019s name on the back.\nA spokesperson for the organising supreme committee said Fifa rules prohibited items with \u201cpolitical, offensive, or discriminatory messages\u201d.\nThe Iranian team has been under severe conflicting pressure with warnings at home from conservative politicians that the players may face consequences on their return to Iran if they did not sing the anthem. But backers of the protests have been seeking more unequivocal support for them by the players.\n\nIran\u2019s state security forces moved quickly to capitalise on the patriotic mood following the victory over a 10-man Wales in extra time, with state news agencies running pictures of smiling security forces waving Iranian flags. The country\u2019s president, Ebrahim Raisi, thanked the team for what he described as showing the sweetness of victory to the people. The Iranian foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, praised the team for what he called a glorious victory and for having made the people happy\nBut at the same time campaigners were battling to prevent the imminent execution of Majidrezah Rahnavard, a protester from Mashhad in north-east Iran who is accused of killing two members of the security forces. His supporters say he has not had a fair trial and he has clearly been beaten in jail.\nInside Iran, crowds also gathered at Friday prayers to protest against the regime, including in Zahedan, where dozens of protesters were killed in September by pro-government forces. More than 18,000 people, of whom 555 were students, have been arrested in different cities.\nCarlos Queiroz, the team\u2019s Portuguese manager, had before the match called on Iranian fans to stay away if they were not willing to support the team inside the stadium. At a press conference, Queiroz said of his players: \u201cTo make it seem that they are the only people who should be responsible for all the human problems of the world, I think you will agree that it is not fair.\u201d\n\nQueiroz was singled out for booing by the Iranian fans, as was the striker Mehdi Taremi, who used a press conference to say the team had lost against England for non-football reasons and now wanted to focus on football alone.\nIn a sign of the pressure being placed on sportsmen and women in Iran, authorities on Thursday arrested a former Iranian team captain, Varia Ghafouri, who was accused of insulting and damaging the Iranian national team and propaganda against the regime.\nGhafouri, a Kurd and a member of the Khuzestan steel club, has been a strong supporter of the protests and outspoken in his defence of Iranian Kurds, telling the government on social media to stop killing Kurdish people.\nThe Iranian government has said it will ignore a UN human rights council vote initiated by Germany and Iceland to set up an independent inquiry into the state of human rights inside Iran. The UN will conduct the investigation without Iran\u2019s cooperation."

These are their choices, it\u2019s not for the government to tell them what to do. \u201cAnd I think when you\u2019re playing in a country like Qatar, which does have different standards in the way it treats, for example, the LGBTQ community, it\u2019s perfectly legitimate for the England or the Welsh team to make that stand.\u201d During the Euro 2020 football competition, which took place last year, Boris Johnson, the then prime minister, refused to condemn fans who booed England players for taking the knee. Priti Patel, Johnson\u2019s home secretary at the time, said England fans had the right to boo players for what she called \u201cgesture politics\u201d, while Lee Anderson, the Tory MP for Ashfield in Nottinghamshire, said he would not watch any England games while the team was supporting a \u201cpolitical movement\u201d and risked alienating \u201ctraditional supporters\u201d. Discussions over equality at the World Cup are all the more pointed given laws in Qatar that discriminate against LGBT people. Fifa, football\u2019s world governing body, has requested that team captains wear armbands with messages such as \u201cFootball unites the world\u201d, \u201cShare the meal\u201d and \u201cBring the moves\u201d. England and Wales, and some other teams, had planned to defy Fifa and send out their captains wearing the rainbow armband. However, England and Wales and some other World Cup nations have said they now will not. In a joint statement with Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland, the English and Welsh football associations said that while they would be prepared to pay fines, they could not risk \u201csporting sanctions\u201d for players. The statement said: \u201cWe are very frustrated by the Fifa decision which we believe is unprecedented\u201d and that players and coaches were \u201cdisappointed\u201d. "

                    "body": "Gay Qataris have been promised safety from physical torture in exchange for helping the authorities to track down other LGBTQ+ people in the country, a prominent Qatari doctor and gay rights campaigner has told the Guardian.\nDr Nasser Mohamed, who lives in the US but retains contact with hundreds of gay Qataris, said that some secret networks had been compromised after arrests by Qatar\u2019s preventive security department.\n\n\u201cA lot [of gay Qataris] don\u2019t know about each other,\u201d Mohamed said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s safer that way because when the law enforcement finds one person, they actively try to find their entire network. But some of the people who were captured and physically abused were then recruited as agents.\n\u201cNow there are agents in the gay community that were promised safety from physical torture in exchange for working for the preventive security department and helping them find groups of LGBTQ+ people.\u201d\nMohamed told the Guardian that foreign gay fans in Qatar would not be persecuted while at the World Cup finals tournament. However, he warned that local LGBTQ+ supporters faced a very different reality. \u201cWhat is it like to be an LGBT Qatari? You live in fear, you live in the shadows, you\u2019re actively persecuted. You\u2019re subjected to state-sponsored physical and mental abuse. It\u2019s dangerous to be an LGBT person in Qatar.\u201d\nLast month Human Rights Watch reported that Qatar\u2019s preventive security department forces had arbitrarily arrested lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people and subjected them to ill\u2011treatment in detention. HRW also documented six cases of severe and repeated beatings and five cases of sexual harassment in police custody between 2019 and 2022.\nRasha Younes, a senior researcher with HRW, told the Guardian that some cases were more striking than most. \u201cThere was one story of a transgender woman who was detained in solitary confinement for two months underground, lost her job as a result of being detained and was not able to give notice to her employer that she was gone,\u201d she said. \u201cThey shaved her 17-inch long hair in detention, severely beat her until she bled, and denied her medical care.\u201d\n\nHRW is calling for the Qatari authorities to repeal article 285 and all other laws that criminalise consensual sexual relations outside of marriage and introduce legislation that protects against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, online and offline. It also wants freedom of expression and nondiscrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity to be guaranteed, permanently, for all residents of Qatar.\nYounes also criticised Fifa for failing to do more. \u201cWe\u2019ve been engaging with Fifa with other sports organisations and LGBT rights activists for years and they have not been paying attention,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have not been at all responsive or listen to the accounts that we have shared. Now that we have all this evidence, it\u2019s really time for Fifa to stop having its fingers in its ears and actually listen.\u201d\nFifa said it was committed to inclusivity and that it was \u201cconfident that all necessary measures will be in place for LGBTIQ+ fans and allies to enjoy the tournament in a welcoming and safe environment, just as for everyone else\u201d.\nIn a statement, Qatar\u2019s Supreme Committee for Delivery &amp; Legacy promised the World Cup would be free of any discrimination. \u201cThe SC is committed to delivering an inclusive and discrimination-free Fifa World Cup experience that is welcoming, safe and accessible to all participants, attendees and communities in Qatar and around the world,\u201d it said.\n\u201cEveryone is welcome in Qatar, but we are a conservative country and any public display of affection, regardless of orientation, is frowned upon. We simply ask for people to respect our culture.\n\u201cMore than 600 international and regional sporting events have been held in Qatar since we were awarded the rights to host the tournament, welcoming thousands of fans from every corner of the world. While the tournament is the biggest event yet, there has never been an issue and every event has been delivered safely.\u201d\nQatar\u2019s government has also been invited to comment on the claims made by Mohammed and HRW. A Qatari official has said previously that HRW\u2019s allegations \u201ccontain information that is categorically and unequivocally false\u201d, without specifying."

                    "body": "Gianni Infantino is to meet the head of the International Labour Organization in Davos to discuss the proposed \u201clabour excellence hub\u201d that remains Fifa\u2019s flagship commitment to a post-World Cup legacy in Qatar. The president of Fifa will visit Gilbert Houngbo after returning to his native Switzerland this week for the World Economic Forum, a gathering of the global elite at the grand alpine resort. He is expected to seek to put flesh on the bones of an idea that remains short on detail.  One month after a celebrated final in Lusail, World Cup organisers released a deluge of data on Wednesday testifying to the success of the Qatar tournament. The most goals in a World Cup, 3.4m spectators in the stands and 1.4 million foreign visitors. The final was said to be watched by 1.5 billion on TV, while the Fifa+ \u201csearch hub\u201d was a TikTok hit and Google had its biggest search traffic in 25 years; the list goes on. All are numbers lending credence to Infantino\u2019s claim that this was the \u201cbest World Cup \u201d, one that in the words of the secretary general of Qatar\u2019s Supreme Committee, Hassan al-Thawadi, \u201cwill set a benchmark for future mega event hosts\u201d. While the numbers are dazzling, questions still remain, with Fifa\u2019s commitment to some form of enduring human rights legacy in the country first and foremost. There will be no migrant workers\u2019 centre and no fund directed to remedying the injury and loss experienced, much to the disappointment of campaigners and European football nations. Instead, a legacy fund is to be spread around the world and directed at children\u2019s education, but again the precise mechanism is unconfirmed, as is the size of the fund. What precisely the \u201cexcellence hub\u201d will involve requires discussion with the ILO, although the union first want to agree a longer-term \u201cmemorandum of understanding\u201d with Fifa before discussing an idea they describe only as \u201cpossible\u201d. A broader ILO presence in Qatar, one that was instrumental in bringing about changes in labour laws in the country over recent years, comes to an end in December.  Infantino announced during the World Cup that it will be succeeded by a permanent office for the ILO in Doha, a place where trade union activity remains heavily controlled. While the ILO say Qatar has made a formal request to establish an office no details have yet been agreed. Other issues of legacy are less controversial but equally unresolved, such as the case of Stadium 974. One of the eight World Cup venues, Stadium 974 received global attention for its unconventional aesthetics (it is constructed from recycled shipping containers) and claims that it was uniquely sustainable as the structure could be disassembled and shipped elsewhere. One month after the final the stadium is still standing, however, with the precise timeline for its ultimate disassembly \u201cstill being finalised\u201d according to the Supreme Committee. As yet there are no confirmed requests to rebuild the stadium elsewhere and rumours suggest Stadium 974 may stay in Doha and be one of the venues for the Asia Cup, which takes place in Qatar in 12 months\u2019 time.  A similar doubt hangs over the numerous accommodation sites put up for fans, with some expected to be returned to their manufacturers while others await new homes. Again, a rumour suggests villages \u2013 some of which became the subject of online notoriety \u2013 could be bought by British companies and turn up in the UK. Like the innovative in-stadia air conditioning technology that took the edge off hot afternoons, the massive infrastructure build was a response to the unique challenges of Qatar\u2019s hosting of the World Cup. Only time will tell how much of the innovation and construction proves useful beyond the month-long tournament. But as the eyes of the world move away from the Gulf, the legacy of Qatar will remain in the mind of sports governing bodies who will have to consider a new paradigm when pondering possible hosts of \u201cfuture mega events\u201d."

But to gain a better insight into the dynamics of the situation, readers may not know that despite Qatar\u2019s ratification of the two core international human rights treaties, religious minorities such as Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00eds are discriminated against and increasingly expelled from the country without any proof of wrongdoing. For many years, even predating the declaration of Qatar as an independent state, members of the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed faith have lived there peacefully. They have considered Qatar their home for generations and have contributed to its social, cultural, and economic prosperity. But since the 1980s, there has been a shift: Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00eds are blacklisted, separated from their families and deported. Dr Ahmed Shaheed, the former UN special rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, recently noted that Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00eds in Qatar are in a \u201cprecarious situation\u201d. Residency permits and work papers are denied to Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00eds without explanation. So despite Qatar\u2019s efforts to promote diversity and interfaith dialogue, there are forces and strategies at play that mirror Iran\u2019s policy of uprooting the peaceful Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed community. The emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, said during his recent UN general assembly address that Qatar wanted to overcome obstacles and celebrate our common humanity, no matter how diverse our religions and nationalities may be. The World Cup is much more than a sporting event. It is an occasion to become enlightened by the spirit of the age, to celebrate diversity, and for Qatar to reflect on how discriminatory acts impede its social cohesion and development.

The Qatari Supreme Committee is expected to issue a statement in the next 24 hours.\n\nThe FAW released a statement expressing its disappointment. \u201cOn Monday, Cymru returned to the World Cup for the first time in 64 years, an historic moment for the squad, the valued fans \u2013 The Red Wall/Y Wal Goch \u2013 and the nation.\n\u201cHowever, the FAW were extremely disappointed by reports that members of Y Wal Goch, which included FAW staff members, were asked to remove and discard their Rainbow Wall bucket hats before entry to the Ahmad Bin Ali Stadium. These bucket hats were created in partnership with the FAW.\n\u201cThe FAW has collated information on these alleged incidents and will be addressing this matter directly with Fifa.\u201d\nThose confronted included the former Wales footballer Prof Laura McAllister, a trustee of the FAW Trust and a past Fifa council candidate, who said it was a \u201csmall moral victory\u201d that she managed to eventually get the hat into the stadium.\n\u201cI pointed out that Fifa had made lots of comments about supporting LGBT rights in this tournament and said to them that coming from a nation where we\u2019re very passionate about equality for all people, I wasn\u2019t going to take my hat off,\u201d said McAllister, a professor of public policy at Cardiff University. \u201cThey were insistent that unless I took the hat off we weren\u2019t actually allowed to come into the stadium.\u201d\nOthers had to surrender their hats. The Rainbow Wall, a Welsh LGBTQ+ fans\u2019 group, said on Twitter: \u201cNot the men, just women. @FIFAcom ARE YOU SERIOUS!!\u201d\nEarlier the US journalist Grant Wahl said he was detained by security staff after he wore a rainbow shirt to the match. One security guard told him they were protecting him from fans inside who might have attacked him for wearing it.\nIt was also reported that a US supporter was threatened on the metro travelling to the stadium for carrying a small rainbow flag \u2013 with the aggressor threatening to \u201ckill\u201d the man because \u201cthat flag is banned in this country\u201d.\nLast week Gerdine Lindhout, Fifa\u2019s head of experiential marketing and promotion, had promised that LGBTQ+ fans would be safe. Asked what her message would be to those wanting to bring rainbow flags into the fan festival, she smiled. \u201cGo for it,\u201d she said. \u201cThis event is all about celebration.\u201d\nMeanwhile, problems with Fifa\u2019s ticketing app, which led to hundreds of England fans missing the start of their 6-2 victory over Iran, are yet to be fixed.\nSome fans queued for paper tickets at a convention centre in Doha after realising that, having logged out of their app in the previous 24 hours, they could no longer gain access. It is understood these issues were still being worked on on Tuesday.\n"

                    "body": "Awer Mabil\u2019s extraordinary story begins in the Kakuma refugee camp, Kenya, but he doesn\u2019t want it to end there. He doesn\u2019t want your pity, either. Born to parents fleeing the Sudanese civil war, raised in a small hut, he went half way round the world then half way back again to become a professional footballer in Denmark, Portugal, Tukey and Spain. He is, he points out, one of only four Australians to score in the Champions League and now he\u2019s going to the World Cup. In fact, it was his penalty, at sudden death in the playoff, that ultimately took the country there.\nHe has become a hero and, he hopes, an inspiration, embarked upon a hell of a journey against the odds. After all, he says: \u201cWhen you come to Europe from Australia you\u2019re nobody, you don\u2019t have the respect, so you have to really work, fight.\u201d But he knows that is not the part people usually focus on; instead his origins in Kakuma eclipse all else. And that, he admits, \u201cstarts to piss me off a lot\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got that title now of \u2018oh, refugee kid\u2019. It\u2019s more for the headlines, for people to try to feel sorry for me, but they never try to understand who I am,\u201d Mabil explains. \u201cNot many would say: \u2018he came from Australia to now play in La Liga.\u2019 They\u2019ll say \u2018from refugee to \u2026\u2019 I lived in the refugee camp. I was born there, I was there until 10 when I moved to Australia. And I lived in Australia 10 years, so it\u2019s half-half. When you pick just one side for a headline or to make people feel bad, you\u2019re forgetting my other half. And I want to be there for everybody.\n\u201cWhen I arrived in Europe I had dreams to chase and a responsibility to encourage other kids: not to feel bad for my story but like \u2018let\u2019s understand how this guy faces a challenge\u2019. I want to tell that story too, inspire people from my country, my mother\u2019s country, around the world: that\u2019s more important than being labelled with one thing. Some might hear my refugee story and say \u2018that\u2019s inspiring\u2019, \u2018that\u2019s beautiful\u2019, but others might be like \u2018yeah, he\u2019s not really \u2026\u2019, you know? There are kids in Australia I want to inspire, to show them there\u2019s a path.\u201d\n\nIn mid-June, he showed them alright, there when Australia needed him. They had drawn 0-0 with Peru in the playoff and after five penalties each, the shootout had reached sudden death. Mabil stood on the spot, alone, \u201cin my own world\u201d, the weight of a country upon him. He had missed in training the day before; now he scored, then watched substitute goalkeeper Andrew Redmayne save from Alex Valera. Afterwards, Mabil called his penalty a thank you to the nation. His hotel room, he said, was bigger than the hut he had grown up in: Australia had given \u201cme and my family a chance of life\u201d.\nMabil says: \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking because on the journey my mum and her parents went through to reach the camp many people died. They were captured by the rebels trying to leave. The way they escaped, we could talk about it all night. It sounds like something from a movie but it\u2019s something they actually went through. The war, the journey, what they faced. For me, hearing it, it\u2019s like: \u2018Woah\u2019. What people do to keep their kids safe, what they sacrifice to give them a better life. They didn\u2019t know how long they would be in the refugee camp, they thought they would return home. But there\u2019s no returning home.\n\u201cI was 10 when we left Kakuma. I remember being loaded on the back of the motorbikes, my friends running after us. \u2018Hey!\u2019 \u2018Hey!\u2019 Growing up we used to say: \u2018going abroad is the best thing ever\u2019, \u2018everything\u2019s ok there, no worries\u2019. But leaving was hard and when I came abroad, to Adelaide, I was like: \u2018I want to go back.\u2019 Our culture was always being together. I came to Australia, you have a house and it\u2019s fenced off. You feel you can\u2019t go and engage with the people next door. I didn\u2019t speak the language. The first few months, I hated it.\u201d\n\nThere was one thing, a connection. In Kakuma, Mabil had played barefooted with balls of socks; in Adelaide, it was different but still football. \u201cAnd football,\u201d he says, \u201cis the world game, a language everybody speaks.\u201d It helps when you\u2019re good at it. Mabil laughs. \u201cEverybody wants to be on your team, yeah!\u201d he says. \u201cFootball has been my life\u2019s guide.\u201d\nMabil was very good at it. Inspired by Tim Cahill, only 17 on his professional debut, he set off to Europe: Midtjylland, Esbjerg, Pa\u00e7os de Ferreira, Kasimpasa, C\u00e1diz. Internationals followed, and now a World Cup. \u201cIn Kakuma, I didn\u2019t have access to watch games so when I came Australia and saw 2006 it was like: Wow! And this country is part of it? Wow. Staying up all night. I remember the final so clear with Zidane\u2019s headbutt. And then 2010: my mum, all my family staying up, even more special because it was Africa. Now to be part of it is such a big thing.\u201d\n\nHe made it so, for all of them. \u201cWhen I was going up to take the penalty, everything shut off,\u201d he recalls. \u201cJust me and that ball. There\u2019s a little thing I do before, see if the keeper buys it or not \u2013 a trade secret I\u2019ll keep to myself for a little bit; maybe after the World Cup I can say! Then I shoot. My normal routine. I\u2019m thinking: just do what you always do.\u201d\nWell, not always. \u201cAfter every session, every player took a penalty and the day before I actually missed,\u201d Mabil reveals. \u201cI said \u2018no, no, I\u2019m not happy with this.\u2019 I didn\u2019t feel right so I told the coach I want to take it again. I [re-]did it so that the next day I felt comfortable. You bring your luck: if I hadn\u2019t retaken that the day before I would have had a negative feeling. \u2018Shit, now it\u2019s 50-50\u2019.\u201d\nMabil\u2019s goal left Redmayne to clinch their World Cup place. Sent on for the shootout, he was playing the clown, leaping about his line. \u201cI don\u2019t even think the goalkeepers knew he was going to come on,\u201d Mabil admits. \u201cMatty [Ryan] is our captain, he played in the Premier League for years, he\u2019s our No 1, so I was shocked. I saw Matty, we had eye contact, it was the last minute. But how he handled showed why he\u2019s our captain. He set the ego aside. \u2018Ok, this is my role\u2019.\u201d\nRedmayne saved, his antics getting into Peruvian heads. \u201cThe whole game was very mental,\u201d Mabil says. \u201cThat few weeks was the most mental challenge I\u2019ve had as a player, given what was on the line. Some were against us, a lot of the media saying we\u2019re not going to make it. Peru thought: \u2018Australia, who\u2019s Australia?\u2019, that it was an easy game, which gave us an advantage. Afterwards that you think about what Andrew did and think \u2018shit, that was hilarious.\u2019 They made fun of it in Peru, there are memes of him as a bullfighter. But, hey, it worked!\u201d\n\u201cI probably didn\u2019t realise how big reaching the World Cup was until I went to Australia after the qualification: at the airport, in the city, everybody was like\u201d \u2018oh, thank you!\u2019,\u201d Mabil continues. \u201cThat motivates you to qualify directly next time because the stress [of the playoff] isn\u2019t fun: it ages you fast.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think people realise how hard it is, especially with Corona [coronavirus]: we played maybe 20 games and only three or four at home. Isolated, unable to get out. European teams travel two hours and go two days before. A lot of our players are overseas so it\u2019s a 24 hour journey: fly today, get there tomorrow, as soon as you\u2019re off the plane, train. Your body clock\u2019s messed up and other countries make it difficult, delaying you at the airport, giving you bad training pitches ...\u201d\n\nYou think that\u2019s deliberate? \u201cAh, yeah, 100% mate.\u201d\n\u201cThat makes you stronger. We broke the record \u2013 11 wins running. Us Australians are better the hard way, backs against the wall. This group is special, the circumstances made us stick together even more. Especially when everybody was saying \u2018they won\u2019t make it, they\u2019re one of the worst Australian sides we\u2019ve seen\u2019. That\u2019s just people talking, and it\u2019s not true \u2013 if anything, we\u2019re one of the best.\u201d\nThey\u2019ll have to be: the world champions await, alongside Denmark and Tunisia. But that, says Mabil, \u201cis how we like it.\u201d There\u2019s an edge to his analysis, a determination: that other journey again. It\u2019s about respect, he says.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have that yet. Come to Europe and South Americans are regarded as Gods because football\u2019s their sport. There are a lot of Australians who are better than South Americans or Europeans but just get judged differently. It\u2019s like me coming here: \u2018Australian?!\u2019 Get on the field and they\u2019re like: \u2018oh, you don\u2019t play like an Australian.\u2019 And I ask: \u2018how should an Australian play?\u2019 They think an Australian doesn\u2019t dribble, do skills, play football. When you start expressing your football, they\u2019re like \u2018oh shit\u2019. That image will change. It\u2019s only a matter of time.\u201d\n\u201cWe have high expectations,\u201d Mabil insists. \u201cAustralia reaching a World Cup is almost \u2018normal\u2019 now although it\u2019s been a while since we won a game there. But we\u2019re not satisfied just to be there; we want to produce great performances, reach the next round. That\u2019s our target. Our dream is last eight or last 16: a powerful statement for our next generation. Football is No 1 now in Australia for kids\u2019 [participation] and the further we go, the more it helps that grow, and when you engage in sport you automatically have a better society.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just winning games, it\u2019s the impact: I know the impact it had on me in Adelaide, watching 2006. It rolls on like a snowball. The targets aren\u2019t just for us. As footballers, you have such a short window representing your country and for me what matters is what it gives the next generation. All the work I do now is to inspire them.\u201d"

                    "body": "If there was a World Cup for the most-travelled of the 32 gathering teams over the past few years, Qatar would go far. The squad finally arrived home last weekend before the big kick-off, stepping off the plane at Doha airport knowing that more than a decade of waiting and working was about to end. Should Sunday\u2019s Group A opener against Ecuador not go well, however, the nightmare of following South Africa into the unwanted record books as a host that fell at the group stage will be very real. Senegal and the Netherlands come next.\n\nBafana Bafana\u2019s 2010 failure was lamented but for many watching around the world, the usual hope that the host nation does well will not apply for Qatar. It\u2019s also fairly certain that most are unaware of their prospects given Qatar have no history at the World Cup. But even those who have watched the team for years are curious to see how it all turns out, not least F\u00e9lix S\u00e1nchez.\nThe Spanish coach started work at Doha\u2019s Aspire Academy back in 2006 and, along with a number of players, moved up through the age ranks and was promoted to take charge of the senior side in 2017. Evidence that the former Barcelona academy coach has been successful is the simple fact that the 46-year-old is still in command. Many felt that two or so years out from 2022, the groundwork would have been laid for a big-name foreign coach such as Pep Guardiola, who played in the country and was an ambassador for the bid back in 2010. It has not been discussed in Doha.\n\nIn 2019, Qatar, who had never made a splash at the Asian Cup, won the tournament in emphatic fashion, cruising to the title in a hostile atmosphere in the neighbouring United Arab Emirates at a time of the Qatar blockade. Saudi Arabia, North Korea, Lebanon, Iraq, South Korea and hosts the UAE were all defeated before a 3-1 victory over Japan in the final. It was a dominant performance with 19 goals scored and one conceded. The two attacking stars were Almoez Ali, who scored a record-breaking nine goals, and Akram Afif who contributed 10 assists. Midfielders Hassan al-Haydos and Abdulaziz Hatem made the official team of the tournament as did the defenders Abdelkarim Hassan, Bassam al-Rawi and Boualem Khoukhi.\n\nSince then, Qatar \u2013 50th in Fifa\u2019s world rankings \u2013 have been on tour, playing in the 2019 Copa Am\u00e9rica where they earned a 2-2 draw with Paraguay and suffered narrow defeats against Colombia and Argentina. At the 2021 Concacaf Gold Cup, Qatar won their group and reached the semi-finals only to be knocked out by the USA 1-0. Ali ended up as top scorer in yet another continental championship. Many were impressed by a team that looked smooth as a 3-5-2 or 5-3-2 and liked to attack more than defend.\nAs well as all the travels that included 10 European friendlies, the national team \u2013 who all play at home \u2013 have been training together since June, mainly in Spain. \u201cWe have had a good preparation programme, taking into account that we are Qatar, a small country with little experience,\u201d said S\u00e1nchez.\n\nThe big question, of course, is will it be enough against Ecuador, a game that the country has waited for since 2010? Perhaps it would have been better to play the Netherlands in the opener, get all the razzmatazz out of the way and then focus on the next two matches which, on paper at least, are more winnable games.\n\u201cWe already know that there is that pressure, and we don\u2019t have to add to it,\u201d said S\u00e1nchez. \u201cWe try to isolate ourselves from the noise around us and focus on getting our best performance. It\u2019s difficult because then you go on to the pitch, you see 60,000 people. It\u2019s the first World Cup match and there\u2019s so much expectation that it\u2019s hard, but that experience will help them.\u201d\n\nThere is concern that Qatar have passed their peak. Performances this year have been mixed. This is a side that would have loved to have hosted the World Cup not just last summer but two or three winters ago. No fewer than 15 of the squad and most of the starting 11 were at the Asian Cup almost four years ago. Eighteen of S\u00e1nchez\u2019s players came through the Aspire Academy. He has introduced little new blood and the team are heavily reliant on the attacking pair of Ali and Afif.\nWhat may change is the tactical approach with Qatar sitting back on home soil. \u201cIt would be suicide to try to take the initiative if we want to be competitive,\u201d said S\u00e1nchez. \u201cWe try to be compact defensively, allow the minimum opportunities and be strong in transitions.\u201d\nFor Qatar, it is a case of whatever works after the longest pre-World Cup preparation period in history."

                    "body": "Seny Dieng is a good man to call in a crisis: he has scored two last-minute goals and replaced the world\u2019s best goalkeeper at late notice to help his country win their first Africa Cup of Nations. Now he is preparing to go to the World Cup with Senegal after helping QPR start the season impressively under Michael Beale, who turned down the Wolves job last month. The club sit sixth in the Championship going into their final match before the World Cup break, at Coventry on Saturday.  \u201cEver since I was young I\u2019ve wanted to play for Senegal,\u201d says Dieng, born in Switzerland to a Senegalese father and Swiss mother. \u201cI watched Senegal going through to the quarters at the World Cup in 2002 and I knew I wanted to be at that level. The first thing is to come out of the group at the World Cup and then I think there is no limit to where we can get.\u201d Being QPR\u2019s No 1 caught the eye of Senegal, who called him up last year and on Friday confirmed he \u2013 and the injured Sadio Man\u00e9 \u2013 would be going to Qatar. After one cap, Dieng was part of the squad for the 2022 Africa Cup of Nations, as understudy to Chelsea\u2019s \u00c9douard Mendy, who had recently been named as the world\u2019s leading goalkeeper in Fifa\u2019s Best awards. Mendy caught Covid, resulting in Dieng starting, alongside Kalidou Koulibaly and Man\u00e9, and keeping clean sheets in the opening two group games against Zimbabwe and Guinea. Dieng enjoyed the triumph in Cameroon. After beating Egypt on penalties, the goalkeeper took the trophy to bed. \u201cTo be the first team to bring home Afcon for Senegal is great. We wrote history. It gives us a great boost.\u201d  His route to Qatar has been a circuitous one. He spent time in Switzerland with Red Star and Grasshoppers before a short spell in Germany. Once his contract with Duisburg came to an end, he knew where he wanted to try his luck, and went on trials in England thanks to the former Bolton goalkeeper coach Fred Barber. There was time spent with Rochdale and Barnsley in the summer of 2016. They offered Dieng contracts but he felt he could do better and eventually QPR came calling to sign up the then 21-year-old. Although QPR could see the potential in Dieng, he had limited first-team experience, and none in England, so they sent him on loan to learn his trade. He got to learn about the realities of non-league football. First he joined Whitehawk in the National League South and later Hampton &amp; Richmond. \u201cI always wanted to play in England,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was an eye-opening experience in non-league with the conditions down there. I did not like to do it but you have to go through that phase at these clubs and play with this level of teams. It was definitely an experience.\u201d It took more than four years \u2013 and five loans \u2013 after joining QPR for him to make his league debut for the club in September 2020. Since then, he has become their undisputed first-choice goalkeeper. He is a laid-back character, unflustered by pressure. His 6ft 4in frame makes him a fine shot stopper and good under the high ball, not to mention dangerous in the opponent\u2019s box. He earned a dramatic point late on in one game early this season when he pounced at Sunderland in injury time but still had to make a crucial double save to make sure his deeds at the other end were not wasted. His other goal was for Whitehawk at Chippenham in 2017. \u201cI played out of net until I was 14; I still have a little bit of the instincts,\u201d jokes Dieng, who has 18 months on his contract.  He admits he did not think he would become QPR\u2019s No 1. \u201cTo be honest, no,\u201d he says. \u201cI never doubted that I could get to where I am but after my Doncaster loan I didn\u2019t expect to be playing for QPR. I thought I would be leaving the club but it turned out differently and I am very glad about that.\u201d He is happy too that Beale stayed loyal to QPR. \u201cHe is a very good manager, he\u2019s had a great impact, put us in the right direction and the position where we are now,\u201d Dieng says. \u201cThe important thing is we carry on with the way that they have brought in and it can be a very good season. There is much more to do. I\u2019ve made no secret that I want to play in the Premier League. Maybe it is with QPR \u2013 we will find out.\u201d"

Switzerland: A win ensures Switzerland go through. A defeat means they go out. If Switzerland draw, they will still progress unless Cameroon have beaten Brazil, in which case goal difference will come into play. Cameroon: Cameroon will progress only if they can beat Brazil, and Switzerland do not win. A draw between Serbia and Switzerland \u2013 or a Serbian victory \u2013 would leave second place being contested on goal difference between Cameroon and one of the European sides. Serbia: Serbia will progress only if they can beat Switzerland. However, if Cameroon also beat Brazil, then second place will be contested on goal difference between Serbia and Cameroon.  Group G and Group H are paired in the draw. The winners of Group G play the runners-up of Group H in the next round, and vice-versa.   Group H \u2013 Ghana, Portugal, South Korea, Uruguay Final matches Friday 2 December, 3pm GMT: South Korea v Portugal, Ghana v Uruguay Portugal have qualified. Ghana: A win against Uruguay will put Ghana through. A draw will be enough unless South Korea beat Portugal, in which case Ghana must hope South Korea pull off only a one goal victory, otherwise the Asian side will pip them on goal difference. South Korea: They must beat Portugal, and hope that Ghana do not win. If Ghana draw then their hopes depend on their goal difference compared to Ghana. If Ghana lose, then South Korean hopes depend on their goal difference compared to Uruguay. Uruguay: Uruguay must win, and hope that South Korea do not win against Portugal. If both Uruguay and South Korea win, then their relative goal differences will decide who qualifies. Uruguay start with a goal difference one worse than South Korea, so would have to beat Ghana by more than South Korea beat Portugal.   The second round matches start at 3pm GMT on Saturday 3 December, and conclude at with a 7pm GMT kick-off on Tuesday 6 December.  Group A \u2013 Netherlands winners, Senegal runners-up Louis van Gaal\u2019s side beat the hosts, Qatar, 2-0 to secure top spot in Group A while Senegal beat Ecuador 2-1 to claim second place ahead of their opponents. Group B \u2013 England winners, USA runners-up England\u2019s 3-0 win over Wales on Tuesday secured top spot and a last-16 meeting with Senegal on Sunday. The USA edged out Iran with a 1-0 win, and will face the Netherlands in Saturday\u2019s opening last-16 game. Group C \u2013 Argentina winners, Poland runners-up Argentina\u2019s 2-0 win over a lacklustre Poland saw them top the group, with the Poles also progressing as neither Saudi Arabia or Mexico could find the results they needed. Group D \u2013 France winners, Australia runners-up France stayed top of the pile despite a shock defeat to Tunisia, while Australia\u2019s second victory in Qatar propelled them into second place and the second round at Denmark\u2019s expense. Group E \u2013 Japan winners, Spain runners-up Japan\u2019s victories against both Germany and Spain turned this group of death on its head, with Spain qualifying ahead of Germany on goal difference, thanks in no small part to their opening 7-0 victory over Costa Rica.

First, the decision to host the tournament in Qatar, a desert country with scorching summer heat, \u201cwasn\u2019t just a surprising choice\u201d, said Oliver. \u201cIt was logically inexplicable. It would be like if the Westminster dog show awarded the best in show title to a tortoise. Nothing against that tortoise, but not only should it not have won, it should\u2019ve been automatically disqualified.\u201d After proposals that included an as-yet-uninvented remote-controlled cloud, Fifa ultimately moved the tournament to November. There have long been allegations that the organization was bribed to award Qatar the tournament in 2010; three of the officials who voted for Qatar allegedly did so in exchange for $1m each. \u201cI won\u2019t say that Qatar definitely got the World Cup through bribery, but I won\u2019t say that they didn\u2019t, and I will say that they did,\u201d said Oliver. Hosting the World Cup required not only building several new stadiums, but a new airport, roads, metro system and more than 100 hotels. The Qatari government has spent an estimated $300bn on new infrastructure for the World Cup, \u201cand look, they can afford that. They have a lot of money thanks to their huge oil and natural gas reserves,\u201d said Oliver. \u201cWhat they don\u2019t have a lot of, though, is Qataris.\u201d  The country has about 380,000 nationals, in a country of approximately 3 million people, mostly foreigners and migrant workers. \u201cAnd it\u2019s migrant workers who perform most of the manual labor there. And those laborers are the ones who\u2019ve had to build all the new infrastructure for this tournament.\u201d Those workers, mainly from India, Nepal and Bangladesh, were recruited through a stringent kafala system of forced labor \u2013 workers couldn\u2019t switch jobs or leave the country without the explicit permission of their employer, often had their passports seized and worked for hours in 125F heat. \u201cAll the new stadiums and infrastructure were built through modern-day slavery,\u201d said Oliver. \u201cSo we should probably introduce a new collective noun to refer to this group of stadiums \u2013 a gaggle of geese, a pod of whales, an atrocity of stadiums. \u201cThere\u2019s something pretty fucked up about arguing \u2018it\u2019s too hot for peak athletes to be outside for 90 minutes, but you know what? It\u2019s completely fine for people to build stadiums in that heat for hours a day and for months on end.\u2019\u201d Living conditions for workers were abysmal \u2013 sprawling, filthy labor camps packed with men, sometimes devoid of showers with broken sewage systems. And the working conditions were dangerous \u2013 a Guardian investigation from February 2021 found that 6,500 workers died in the 10 years after Qatar was awarded the World Cup. That figure includes all migrant worker deaths, not necessarily those occurring on World Cup projects; the Qatari government\u2019s preferred death count is 37 workers, only three of which were \u201cwork-related\u201d.  \u201cIf that number seems suspiciously low to you, it\u2019s because it very much is,\u201d said Oliver. The preferred count was limited to the small handful of work sites that were under the highest level of scrutiny, and excluded hundreds of other tournament-related projects. Both Qatar and Fifa have claimed credit for reforms to the kafala system in the run-up to the tournament, despite zero mentions of human rights or demand for labor reforms in Fifa\u2019s evaluation of Qatar\u2019s bid. \u201cThink of it like this,\u201d said Oliver: \u201cIf the country had made no changes to its kafala system in the past few years and instead had passed the \u2018Doubling Down on Slave Labor Act of 2019\u2019 you know what would have happened? The World Cup would\u2019ve still kicked off in Qatar today. \u201cWhen Fifa awarded Qatar the World Cup, there was only one way those stadiums were getting built, and there was only one group who were going to do it, and they gave them the tournament anyway.\u201d Oliver then turned to current crackdowns on human rights, particularly LGBTQ+ rights, in Qatar, which the tournament is likely to distract from. \u201cThe Qatari government is engaging in some truly horrendous behavior and we can\u2019t just gloss over that and uncritically put it in the spotlight,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an authoritarian regime, not Mel fucking Gibson. \u201cUltimately, it\u2019s not the players who are responsible for this mess, it\u2019s Fifa,\u201d he said. \u201cThey put the World Cup in Qatar and everything that\u2019s happened since then has been a complete disgrace.\u201d Oliver didn\u2019t encourage people to boycott the World Cup \u2013 he\u2019d be watching and cheering for England, he admitted \u2013 but urged viewers to \u201ctry and make sure a line is drawn here\u201d after the final whistle in December by remembering the cost of this tournament. \u201cThere is no reason to believe that Fifa will ever do the right thing,\u201d he concluded. \u201cBut I would love it if it could, for just once in its shitty history, find a way to hold itself to the lofty ideals that it has the gall to profess.\u201d"

                    "body": "If Lionel Messi lifts the World Cup trophy it will not only represent a victory for Argentina\u2019s diminutive captain but his unlikely new benefactor: Saudi Arabia. The team may have inflicted a shock, humiliating defeat upon Argentina in their opening game of the tournament, but Messi, paid to be an ambassador for Saudi under a reported \u00a325m contract, could deliver a long-term prize worth far more \u2013 a chance to emulate Qatar and host the 2030 World Cup. After the tiny gas-rich emirate won the right to host the World Cup in December 2010, in circumstances mired in controversy, Qatar wrote the playbook on using the soft power of the world\u2019s biggest sporting event to further its aims \u2013 from the big spending western brands which come with the tournament to the attempts to improve its image on human rights. For Saudi, landing the trophy tournament in 2030 could offer rehabilitation on the world stage for crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. He was initially lauded as a reformer who might lead the kingdom on a path to modernity, until the murder of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi left it a pariah. The country\u2019s role in the bombing in Yemen, restrictions on women\u2019s rights and its use of the death penalty have further damaged its international reputation. Recently, Saudi\u2019s decision to defy American pressure on oil production has frayed already uneasy relations.  Mohammed bin Salman wants the tournament to help convince the world \u2013 and his youthful population \u2013 that he has a plan to wean the second-biggest oil producing nation off its reliance on petro dollars, via his Vision 2030 modernisation plan. If Saudi is to repeat Qatar\u2019s feat, it will shine an even brighter light on its international relations \u2013 and extensive links with Britain.  The playbook Saudi\u2019s plan to \u201csportswash\u201d its image has seen it muscle in on sports from boxing to golf. It divided the golfing world with the launch of LIV Golf \u2013 the megabucks golf tour funded by the Public Investment Fund (PIF), the Saudi sovereign wealth fund, and launched in 2019. Anthony Joshua\u2019s heavyweight fight with Oleksandr Usyk in August at the Abdullah Sports City Arena in Jeddah was attended by Mohammed bin Salman alongside FIFA president Gianni Infantino. In 2019 Joshua drew criticism from human rights campaigners when he said Saudi was \u201ctrying to do a good job politically\u201d. His last Saudi-based fight was one of several meetings between Mohammed bin Salman and Infantino including the World Cup opening ceremony, they were pictured laughing together.  Aramco, the oil giant predominantly owned by the Saudi royal family and the engine room of the country\u2019s economy, has been busy increasing its profile in sport, with the sponsorship of this year\u2019s Twenty20 World Cup. The $2tn oil firm\u2019s global power was underlined by the scramble by stock exchanges around the world to land its listing \u2013 even seeing then prime minister Theresa May traveling to Riyadh on an ultimately failed charm offensive in 2017. The bid How Qatar snared the FIFA votes to land the tournament in 2010 has been the source of a decade of analysis and any successful Saudi bid would be subject to similar scrutiny. In August it was reported that officials were in talks with Greece and Egypt about a joint bid to host the 2030 tournament, a year after it is due to host the Asian Winter Games. Saudi is reportedly ready to put up $40bn to fund the bid, which would probably see matches held in the winter again given blistering summer temperatures. Tourism minister Ahmed Al Khateeb last month said the country was weighing the idea, before later stating that it does not have an \u201cofficial bid\u201d to host the competition. The country\u2019s tourist board has, at least, been alive to the possibilities of the 2022 tournament \u2013 with slick promotional packages, daily flights and multi-entry visas into Qatar. Less than a year after signing for Qatari-owned Paris Saint-German in August 2021, Messi was unveiled as a tourism ambassador, promoting staying in Saudi during the competition on his Instagram feed and in TV adverts. There are even signs that the football has thawed previously frosty relations between Qatar and its neighbours, which were typified by the three-year boycott of Qatar by four Middle Eastern countries led by Saudi Arabia which ended early last year. The infrastructure Winning World Cup bids are typically accompanied by vast and often controversial infrastructure spending, from upgrading roads and airports in South Africa to protests in Brazil. Qatar\u2019s has been the most expensive, with $229bn reportedly shelled out including building seven stadiums from scratch. More than 6,500 migrant workers have died in Qatar since the award of the tournament. Saudi has more stadiums than Qatar had, although just two have a capacity of more than 60,000 and most are about 20,000. A World Cup in eight years\u2019 time would complement \u201cVision 2030\u201d \u2013 Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s plan to build \u201ca vibrant society, a thriving economy and an ambitious nation\u201d. The aim is to diversify its economy as the world weans itself off oil, and includes NEOM, the north-east region which will host a sci-fi city that will carve through the desert near the Red Sea. At 170 kilometres (105 miles) long, and just 200 metres wide, The Line will be flanked by 500-metre high walls of building, mirrored on the outside.  The decarbonisation strategy also involves building the world\u2019s largest carbon capture and storage hub, aimed to trap carbon and allow oil production to continue. Operated by Aramco, in the kingdom\u2019s eastern region of Jubail, it has been called a \u201cfalse solution\u201d by green campaigners. The PIF last month secured a $17bn loan from a global syndicate to fund megaprojects. Defence and diplomacy Britain surrendered any qualms about doing business with Saudi long ago. Defence and diplomacy have bound the two countries together for more than a century. Britain\u2019s defence giant BAE Systems has a small army of about 6,700 workers embedded in the country and Saudi is by far the largest single destination for sales outside its core US and UK markets. Arms sales span more than half a century, from a contract to supply Lightning and Strikemaster aircraft in the 1960s, to the 1985 al-Yamamah guns-for-oil deal, which was embroiled in corruption allegations. Saudi became a crucial ally of Britain and the US in the post-9/11 \u201cwar on terror\u201d, and Tony Blair cited national security in 2007 after dropping a corruption inquiry into al-Yamamah. Yet despite Khashoggi\u2019s murder and criticism for supplying the Saudi military during the deadly bombing campaign in Yemen, in which its Lancashire-built Eurofighter Typhoons have been involved in a campaign that has killed thousands of civilians, BAE remains deeply entrenched. It sold \u00a32.5bn of arms to Saudi last year, 12% of BAE\u2019s global sales. Department for International Trade figures show Saudi exports to the UK \u2013 including refined oil and ships \u2013 rose 18% to \u00a310.4bn in the year to the end of June, while UK exports, including financial services, saw a post-pandemic bounce, up 57% to \u00a33.3bn. More is to come. Britain is reportedly closing in on the sale of between 48 and 72 more Typhoons to the Saudis, four years on from the signing of a memorandum of intent between the nations \u2013 work which would sustain its Lancashire factories for many years to come. The engines for Saudi\u2019s Typhoons are made by Rolls-Royce, with work centred at its Bristol factory. Separately, Saudi and Britain signed a \u201cmemorandum of cooperation\u201d on energy in October. British multinationals, including pharmaceuticals giant GlaxoSmithKline and petrochemicals group Ineos, have moved to build up their businesses in the country. Power and influence  Much as Qatar has worked to foster closer links with Britain over the last decade, so too has Saudi. The Observer revealed Qatar has spent more money on gifts and trips for British MPs in the past year than any other country \u2013 \u00a3251,208 in the 12 months to October 2022, including luxury hotel stays, business-class flights and tickets to horse-racing events. Last year, a group of MPs was criticised for attending the Qatar-sponsored Goodwood horse racing festival, hosted by Qatar Racing and Equestrian Club and its UK embassy at the event in West Sussex. Among them was Mark Menzies, who chairs the all party parliamentary group on Saudi Arabia. Menzies, the Conservative MP for Fylde, whose Lancashire constituency is home to BAE\u2019s Warton Typhoon factory, received hospitality worth almost \u00a320,000 from the Saudi state on trips to Riyadh and Jeddah between 2014 and 2017. During the visits, he met with HM King Salman Abdulaziz Ibn Saud, and the governor of the Saudi Arabia Monetary Authority.  He is among an intriguing cast of characters with links to Saudi. Lord (Colin) Moynihan, the British rowing Olympian and former minster for sport under Margaret Thatcher, is the APPG\u2019s vice-chair. Meanwhile, the Tory party\u2019s links to Saudi have been numerous: from former leader David Cameron and disgraced financier Lex Greensill\u2019s desert camping trip to woo Mohammed bin Salman in 2020, to ex-chancellor Lord (Philip) Hammond, whose private consultancy has generated almost \u00a31m in profits while working for controversial clients including the Saudi government. Saudi Arabia has been mentioned 175 times in the House of Commons so far in 2022, up from 135 times in 2021 and 75 in 2012.  In the City, the PIF has shown an increasing interest in FTSE stocks, backing the recent \u00a3575m rights issue by luxury carmaker Aston Martin \u2013 in a partnership lauded by Canadian billionaire Lawrence Stroll \u2013 and taking a $268m stake in asset manager M&amp;G. The strategy emulates the Qatari model, with state-owned investors receiving \u00a3500m from FTSE 100 firms this year and amassing a vast UK property empire. It has reportedly looked at buying a 25% stake in Heathrow airport \u2013 alongside existing shareholder Qatar. Thanks to its investment in Japan\u2019s Softbank, PIF has stakes in companies from Cambridge chip designer Arm Holdings to ride-hailing app Uber. Newcastle United But arguably PIF\u2019s most high-profile UK investment has been the takeover of Newcastle United, and its plan to build a rival to Abu Dhabi\u2019s Manchester City. The Guardian has revealed that in August 2020 Lord Gerry Grimstone, then minister for investment, asked the then Premier League chair, Gary Hoffman, to share the league\u2019s legal advice on \u201ca way forward\u201d for the stalled takeover. PIF\u2019s partners on the deal were RB Sports &amp; Media, an offshoot of the billionaire Reuben brothers\u2019 investment operation, and PCP Capital Partners, the vehicle of financier Amanda Staveley. The Yorkshire-born financier has built a reputation on her connections to Middle Eastern investors and is married to the club\u2019s co-owner Mehrdad Ghodoussi, who tweeted his delight at Saudi\u2019s unlikely slaying of Argentina. Yasir Othman Al-Rumayyan, the chair of Saudi Aramco, is on Newcastle\u2019s board, as well as LIV Golf, NEOM and Uber. The investment group was advised on the deal by Edelman, the PR outfit which has a five-year programme, worth a reported $800,000 a year, to promote Saudi across the world, specifically in the US, UK, France, Germany and the Middle East. The firm is led in Europe, the Middle East and Africa by Ed Williams, a former BBC and Reuters executive who in 2020 noted the \u201cswift implementation of lockdowns\u201d and \u201cefficient and effective access to healthcare\u201d in research showing trust in the Saudi government surged early in the pandemic. The kingdom is not stopping there. In March, a Saudi consortium led by the Chelsea fan Mohamed Alkhereiji failed to make the shortlist to takeover Chelsea amid concerns over proving the independence of any consortium from the Saudi state. Saudi sports minister prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al Faisal said last month his government would definitely support any private sector Saudi bids for Manchester United or Liverpool. Minky Worden, a director at Human Rights Watch, says: \u201cThe mistakes in awarding the most watched event in football to Qatar must not be repeated. Women, journalists, members of the LGBTQ community and all fans of the game should ask how it could possibly be held in a country where their rights are not respected. The players should not be expected to compete where human rights are so utterly compromised. \u201cIf Saudi Arabia ends up co-hosting the World Cup, it would harm FIFA\u2019s human rights policies and reward Saudi Arabia\u2019s escalating repression. This idea deserves a red card.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 16 December 2022. An error made during editing introduced a reference to \u201cQatar\u2019s Manchester City\u201d; that should have said \u201cAbu Dhabi\u2019s Manchester City\u201d."

                    "body": "So England didn\u2019t wear the OneLove armband in the end. The gesture was gesture-trumped by Fifa, which gestured towards the referee\u2019s pocket to indicate a yellow card would be forthcoming. Ahead of England\u2019s World Cup opener against Iran yesterday, the Football Association put out a joint statement with other no-longer-participating nations, explaining \u201cwe can\u2019t put our players in a position where they could face sporting sanctions including bookings\u201d. That \u201cincluding bookings\u201d really puts it into perspective. #ActivismIsHard. Without wishing to undermine this heroically short-lived civil rights moment even further, what really is OneLove, with its off-brand Pride rainbow? The whole thing feels as weirdly and carefully vague as the bar orders of soap-opera characters, who walk into pubs and ask simply for \u201ca pint\u201d. A pint of what? OneLove of what? So anodyne is the wider armband advocacy movement that it seems concerned above all else with not causing offence, to the point where it is impossible to imagine it sitting even very distantly on a continuum with sprinters Tommie Smith and John Carlos\u2019s epic podium protest at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics (and the solidarity of the silver medallist, Peter Norman), or Muhammad Ali\u2019s heroic career self-harm. Instead, #armbandgate feels perfectly contextualised in an era in which huge numbers of people became conveniently convinced that activism is something that happens in a web browser. After such a swift climbdown by the various nations, it would be nice to think the entire episode shows the absolute limits of this type of \u201cchange-making\u201d. Whenever I see people arguing hour after hour about their supposed causes on social media, I no longer even think of them as working in the service of those causes, but simply in the (perhaps unwitting) service of whichever Silicon Valley billionaire owns the digital space where they\u2019re doing it. As serious tech experts have long pointed out, people stay longer on these platforms when they\u2019re angry, so the best way to keep them there \u2013 where the techlords can monetise them \u2013 is for their algorithms to fan that anger. So that\u2019s what they do. Spent all day arguing about Jeremy Corbyn/Boris Johnson/whatever on Twitter? Hate to break it to you, but you don\u2019t work for your faction; you just work for Elon Musk. Try not to choke on it.  Speaking of overlords, we must conclude that Fifa president Gianni Infantino did not \u201cfeel gay\u201d yesterday. On Saturday, Infantino gave a speech in which he said he did feel gay, and disabled, and like a migrant worker, because \u2013 I think I have this right \u2013 people teased him about his red hair when he was a child. This put me in mind of the late football pundit Jimmy Hill\u2019s insistence that the N-word was \u201cfunny\u201d. \u201cWhy should that be any more of an offence,\u201d Hill wondered idiotically, \u201cthan someone calling me chinny?\u201d It was the year 2004 at the time \u2013 and, even more incredibly, not a whole lot seems to have changed in Zurich\u2019s corridors of power today. As for what I suppose we\u2019ll have to characterise as the FA\u2019s thinking on all this, there are really only two possibilities. The first is that they knew very well Fifa would prohibit it, because they always do, so always planned to fold at the first sign of threat (which they did). The second is that they literally didn\u2019t even realise this was how it would play out, in which case I do hope their football campaign for this tournament is better strategised, otherwise it\u2019s going to fall apart at the first sign of trouble. In a modern game in which they\u2019re everywhere, there is something very will-this-do about armbands in general. They feel like little more than a hashtag-heavy social media template. You retweet it, you undo the retweet. You make a big show of wearing it, then you discard it the minute you\u2019re threatened with a yellow. Easy come, easy go. It seems strange to have to state this, when historically it was axiomatic: but true activism typically involves rather higher stakes than this, and at the very least the potential for some kind of personal sacrifice. As we can see from the hugely perilous collectivist endeavours unfolding in Iran, it is rather harder work to refuse to wear the hijab than it is to be banned from wearing the armband. No one is remotely saying that England players need to take to the streets and risk their lives for a cause they say they truly believe in. But taking a yellow is arguably doable \u2013 and if it honestly isn\u2019t, then don\u2019t even bother trailing the gesture in the first place. It\u2019s an insult to those who do seriously put themselves out. Putting yourself out cuts different ways, of course, some of them also ridiculous. David Beckham\u2019s rumoured 150m pieces of silver to promote Qatar is unquestionably a piece of activism, and is \u2013 regrettably \u2013 worth more than countless armbands. You can even see it has involved David laying down some of his personal desires for the cause. Scowling down from the dignitaries\u2019 seats at the tournament, Beckham has been wearing the expression of a man who knows he\u2019s never going to get his knighthood now. I\u2019m sure the Qatari regime thanks him for his sacrifice. Sacrifices that don\u2019t benefit you are harder. Structural change requires structural action, and plastic gestures will generate plastic results. England and any other nations who genuinely wish to take a stand could still come up with a better form of protest at this World Cup. There is plenty of time for creative collective action \u2013 but is there truly the will?

                    "body": "Believe it or not, Andrew Redmayne is more than happy to blend into a crowd. Ideally a crowd which does not recognise him as the dancing goalkeeper, or the grey Wiggle, or the guy who denied Peru a place at the World Cup. \u201cI had a photo last night in a suit,\u201d he says in the Australian camp in Doha. \u201cA suit and a photo are my two worst enemies.\u201d This is the same man who, back in June, produced a humdinger of a penalty shootout performance and engaged in the kind of top-shelf shithousery that would absolutely get him recognised in quite a few places. Doha, thankfully is not one of them.  Australia have been effectively incognito since arriving in the country a week ago, training and staying at the Aspire Academy and barely setting foot outside its perimeters. When they do, there is no covert planning operation required. \u201cWe\u2019d be one of the few nations that could actually walk through a shopping centre on the eve of a World Cup and kind of just slip into the background,\u201d he says. Redmayne may not revel in the spotlight but these past six months have been a lesson in adapting. The 33-year-old\u2019s tactical substitution at the end of extra-time not only ensured Australia\u2019s famous qualifying playoff win but also made him an instant breakfast TV star. It made international headlines, too. Media in Qatar seem to know only one nugget of information about the Socceroos \u2013 that their bearded goalkeeper tossed away the shootout notes of his Peru counterpart and went on to seal a spot at a fifth consecutive World Cup. Half a year later he is, once more, stepping back into his role as the back-up for first choice Mat Ryan, who retains his spot in the national team despite untimely setbacks at his Danish club, FC Copenhagen. Maty\u2019s been phenomenal,\u201d Redmayne says. \u201cHe\u2019s a consummate professional. He\u2019s kind of been through spells with not so much game time, but he\u2019s always performed for Australia.\u201d \u201cMat\u2019s the national team captain, he\u2019s a consummate professional, and anything I can do to help him perform and prepare for matches, I\u2019m more than happy to do that,\u201d Redmayne said.  He won\u2019t have to help him prepare for Karim Benzema, who was ruled out over the weekend in news that has been felt among the team as a mix of disappointment, sympathy and relief. \u201cI think you always want to test yourself against the best, and currently he\u2019s the best thing in the world, so it\u2019s sad to see him miss out,\u201d Redmayne says. \u201cFrom a World Cup point of view as well, you want see the best players on the pitch. But whoever pulls on a blue shirt is going to be a world-class player.\u201d  France, on the other hand, know very little about the first opponents of their title defence, a factor that Redmayne isn\u2019t considering a positive or negative. \u201cIt all just falls back on us executing our game plan, and being strong and resolute in our own physical, technical and tactical side,\u201d he says. \u201cWhoever does step on the field for France is going to be a world class player and we need to take the game to them, be physical and really execute that game. \u201cThe intensity [in training] really turned up a notch for the UAE and Peru games and I think we\u2019ve even added to that in this camp.\u201d"

                    "body": "During Monday\u2019s World Cup matches, the upper arms of various team captains took on a new significance. In Monday\u2019s match against Iran, England\u2019s Harry Kane wore an armband reading \u201cno discrimination\u201d, in black and white \u2013 which, despite its stated message, meant more cold-shoulder treatment for lesbian, gay, bi and trans people at this World Cup. When it was announced back in September that eight competing nations would support the One Love campaign, with multicoloured hearts appearing on captains\u2019 sleeves, the power of the gesture lay in allyship. \u201cWearing the armband together on behalf of our teams will send a clear message when the world is watching,\u201d said Kane. The six colours being used for One Love aren\u2019t those of the Pride rainbow, but that made sense in the context of Qatar. After all, the criminalisation of same-sex love is not the only human rights issue in the host nation. But even then, One Love never did feel alright \u2013 and its weaknesses were ultimately exposed by Fifa\u2019s bullying tactics and England\u2019s risk-averse response. Cracks in the coalition started to appear when the France skipper, Hugo Lloris, said last week that \u201crespect\u201d for Qatar\u2019s rules and culture meant he was unlikely to wear the armband. He also suggested he was waiting for the final call from Fifa, which then stopped the remaining seven teams with the threat of sanctioning their skippers if they wore the campaign apparel.  Kane ended up wearing an armband approved by world football\u2019s governing body instead. Meanwhile, Virgil van Dijk, the Netherlands captain, sported a different design \u2013 but again, Fifa-approved and anodyne \u2013 when his team played Senegal on Monday afternoon.  I run a network called Sports Media LGBT+ for those working in sports media who are LGBTQ+ (we have more than 50 in our core group) and the ping of WhatsApp messages on Monday morning was testament to the way hearts were sinking. We are collectively exasperated at our community being seen as political. Fifa\u2019s own statutes include sexual orientation in its non-discrimination, equality and neutrality clause, but it appears visibility and a reference to love is still a stretch too far. It\u2019s why Sports Media LGBT+ is among the supporters of the No Pride Without All campaign launched by Three Lions Pride, the Rainbow Wall and Pride in Football. Members of these LGBTQ+ fan groups have not travelled to Qatar \u2013 they did not receive adequate reassurances of security for fans, while they also wanted to show solidarity with their queer Qatari siblings. They feel similarly deflated by the overruling of One Love. Their statement reads: \u201cFifa are guilty of crushing the basic human rights to freedom of speech and of expression that every single one of us should have without question.\u201d Kane could, of course, have worn the One Love armband anyway, and taken the booking or whatever punishment Fifa intended to dish out \u2013 but, amid so much uncertainty just hours before kickoff, the FA erred on the side of caution.  The players and staff of the national teams involved were put in a near impossible position. Ultimately, Fifa\u2019s failings during the whole affair \u2013 exemplified by the insensitive manner in which its president, Gianni Infantino, referenced diversity in his address to the media on the eve of the tournament \u2013 has undermined the very values it professes to share, and that are written into the non-discrimination clause of its statutes. Fifa seems to believe that by mandating usage of its own armbands, it is showing leadership. But with seven out of eight groups at this World Cup containing nations where homosexuality is still illegal, there simply isn\u2019t a shared commitment on LGBTQ+ inclusion. The visibility of One Love might have at least started a specific conversation, and perhaps we shall discover that Fifa\u2019s actions have made it even more of a talking point. The only person seen wearing the armband at England v Iran was, commendably, the BBC pundit Alex Scott, who has recently written in her autobiography about her previous relationship with her former teammate Kelly Smith. She was representing LGBTQ+ people from the sidelines. It\u2019s where our community will no doubt continue to find itself during this men\u2019s World Cup.

                    "body": "The Denmark manager, Kasper Hjulmand, has said he hopes the process through which Qatar was awarded the World Cup is never repeated and called for a more diverse, youthful demographic to influence the hosting of tournaments.\nDenmark, highly fancied for a strong run over the next month, have been one of the more vocal countries around the off-pitch issues that cast a heavy cloud over the hosts. They remain aggrieved Fifa refused them permission to train in shirts reading \u201cHuman rights for all\u201d, a ruling they will abide by for fear of a potentially heavy punishment. On Friday they trained in black shirts, described by the manufacturer, Hummel, as \u201cthe colour of mourning\u201d.\nSpeaking at the team\u2019s training camp in Al Sailiya, a suburb on Doha\u2019s fringes, Hjulmand expressed the wish this year\u2019s controversy leads to change among the decision-makers in bodies such as Fifa.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t like the process of being here and the way Qatar was awarded the hosting of this World Cup,\u201d he said. \u201cI have two dreams with this. One is that in the governing bodies of football and sports we have more progressive, young, diverse people in places where decisions are being made. I hope we see these reforms.\n\u201cThe second part is that in the world we have more empathy, listen and try to understand other people. It\u2019s the only way forward. Try to do our part and make changes through this.\u201d\nIt was put to Hjulmand that Denmark were being denied the chance to do that by Fifa\u2019s hardline stance relating to their shirts, but he insisted they did not feel muzzled. \u201cWe are not silenced, believe me,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s hard work behind the scenes that you can\u2019t see. There are a lot of ways to try to change things and hopefully we won\u2019t be put in this situation again \u2013 we\u2019ll see.\u201d\nThe defender Rasmus Kristensen was blunter on the subject of shirts. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s a shame; it\u2019s apparently Fifa rules,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can disagree, and I think we do.\u201d\nKristensen expressed the mixture of excitement and frustration felt by many of his peers. \u201cObviously the whole Qatar situation is a bit bizarre and I was hoping for another location \u2013 I think everybody would,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m proud, happy and grateful for the opportunity to play.\u201d\nThe Denmark FA chief executive, Jakob Jensen, said they were \u201cdisappointed\u201d at Fifa\u2019s decision to ban the shirt slogan, which was made with recourse to rules prohibiting political messages. \u201cWe don\u2019t consider \u2018Human Rights for All\u2019 a political statement because they are universal so yes, we were disappointed,\u201d he said.\nAsked whether, given the appalling optics of any punishment, Denmark could simply have pushed on with wearing the shirts, he said: \u201cYou\u2019d have to ask Fifa; it\u2019s a theoretical discussion. We don\u2019t know what the punishment would be. One option would be that we could lose points at the very end and we\u2019re here to play football, we want to win football matches on the pitch, not behind a desk.\u201d\nIn an early suggestion heat may interfere with teams\u2019 initial plans despite the tournament\u2019s winter hosting, Denmark moved their Friday and Saturday sessions from the morning to the cooler late afternoon. Temperatures had hit 34C earlier in the day and Hjulmand said his players could not train with the required intensity in such conditions."

                    "body": "Ben White did not watch much football during his childhood in Dorset. It was never on in the house, his parents were just not interested. Does he have any World Cup memories? \u201cNot that stick out,\u201d the Arsenal and England defender says. And you will not find him flicking on a match in the evenings nowadays, either.\n\u201cSitting down and watching a 90-minute game after I\u2019ve trained all day and had four or five meetings about football \u2026 the last thing I want to do is watch more football,\u201d he says.\n\nOn the day when Gianni Infantino sparked outrage and astonishment, when the issues around this World Cup pounded like a migraine and as the pressure in football terms mounted ahead of the big kick-off, White is the antidote.\nSitting under a tent at England\u2019s training base and speaking in almost hushed tones, he discussed his laid-back temperament and how it had helped him rise to the top, dealing with rejection and season-on-season upheaval. It was difficult not to link it to an upbringing devoid of football tribalism and obsession, although the genes of his father, Barry, are also plainly at work.\n\u201cMy old man is so laid-back it is ridiculous,\u201d White says. \u201cHe would just go to work, a normal bloke, a gardener, and he hasn\u2019t got any passion for any sport. When I got called up for the World Cup squad, he was like: \u2018Well done.\u2019 It was like he knew it was going to happen and it wasn\u2019t a surprise for him. My mum is the opposite so I think I have got the balance between them.\n\n\u201cMy temperament is one of the big reasons why I am where I am. I don\u2019t go too high or too low. I learned from getting released [by Southampton at 16]. It was a rubbish day but I didn\u2019t cry. It was on to the next thing and it is like that after a game if you didn\u2019t play so well. After my first one for Arsenal against Brentford [at the start of last season] I was hammered. Now they are all praising me.\u201d\nWhite remembers how he would ride his bike down to the beach in Bournemouth as a kid to watch World Cups on the big screen but he always preferred to play himself, kicking about in his garden; ever active, carefree. \u201cI don\u2019t really look too far ahead,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m a day-to day-person. I wake up, look after that day and try to have the best one ever. I\u2019m not someone that has anything planned for in normal life. If I want to go somewhere for dinner on the day, I\u2019ll be going.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think about the World Cup at all until it was close. If you\u2019re so concerned on something, it normally doesn\u2019t happen. Things will be what they will be and you deal with it when it comes.\u201d\nIt would be a mistake to think that White does not have rare inner steel, understated self-assurance, and it is suddenly visible when he discusses how settled he feels in his life, which has provided the springboard for his excellent Arsenal form.\nIn each of the past five seasons, he has played for a different club, with loan moves from Brighton to play in League Two for Newport in 2017-18, then in League One for Peterborough and, after that, for Leeds in the Championship, where he won promotion. He stayed at Brighton in the Premier League in 2020-21 before moving to Arsenal for \u00a350m.\n\u201cComing to League Two,\u201d White says. \u201cYou go to a club and they are like: \u2018Who is this guy?\u2019 Then I go and smash the season and get player of the season. Then I go to a League One club and the same happens. Then I go to Leeds; no one has a clue who I am and I play every single minute. I believe in myself. I don\u2019t think I have done it an easy way.\u201d\nWhite says he has felt the benefit of being \u201cback-to-back at a club\u201d for the first time in his senior career. Repurposed by Mikel Arteta, as a right-back, the adaptation has been seamless; the memory of the Brentford game and his initial difficulties in winning over the Arsenal support faded.\n\u201cLooking back at Brentford, I did not actually do that badly,\u201d White says. \u201cI won half the duels and people said I got bullied. It is an opinion and they change a lot. It is always like that and they [the pundits] are paid for an opinion. Sometimes it is rubbish.\u201d\n\nWhite is on the fringes of the England squad but he offers an option at right-back, centre-half and the right of a defensive three. \u201cAt Arsenal, we build up in a three so I\u2019m playing centre-back every week but just on some occasions I\u2019m flying forwards,\u201d he says.\nCould White emerge later in the tournament? He is on top of his game and ready, although he will keep it chilled in between training sessions. How is he dealing with the boredom of camp? \u201cSunbathing,\u201d he replies. \u201cI sunbathed this morning. There is not loads to do. You rest and there\u2019s recovery stuff to do. Early to bed and watch a movie. It is very nice around the pool. Very relaxing.\u201d"

                    "body": "Watching football without a drink was once unthinkable. Then again, there were all sorts of things I wouldn\u2019t have countenanced without the benefit of alcohol: going to a wedding, say; or any party; or any kind of date. The list was long. The length of your list is as good a way as any of gauging your dependence on alcohol. I never got to the stage of needing a drink to go to the shops, but I was most definitely at the stage when an evening with a dear friend wouldn\u2019t hold much appeal if there wasn\u2019t going to be drink involved.  I\u2019d go to all sorts of trouble to facilitate pre-match drinking. I\u2019d always try to take the train rather than drive to matches, a case of doing the right thing environmentally, but for the wrong reasons. Good for the carbon footprint, bad for my liver. It became incredibly important to speed-drink a couple of quarts of beer in some pub or other, a pre-match ritual that wasn\u2019t for tinkering around with. Ahead of Croatia\u2019s World Cup semi-final in 1998, I got an early Eurostar to Paris and ate and drank all day with Croatian friends. At the Stade de France, there was great joy for us when Croatia took the lead. I, however, missed the goal because, er, j\u2019\u00e9tais en train de pisser. There should be a special place in fools\u2019 hell for people who spend so much time and money getting to a football match, only to miss their team\u2019s only goal because their bladder is full. France won 2-1 \u2013 I saw both of their goals, by the way \u2013 and I went home miserable. Absurd, completely absurd. In another case of the right thing happening for the wrong reasons, the alcohol intake of England fans in Qatar isn\u2019t what they might want it to be. And if that curtails their enjoyment of it all, that gives me no pleasure. On the other hand, there is the delicious possibility of England winning this World Cup roared on by sober fans, whose delight will be diminished not a jot by the absence of alcohol. As they eventually file out of the stadium after the final, having watched Harry Kane lift the trophy, not one of them will say: \u201cThis is really great \u2013 one of the best days of my life \u2013 but it would have been so much better if I\u2019d been drinking all day.\u201d They may well lament what a crying shame it is that they can\u2019t then go out and get smashed, but that, too, will pass as the party of parties will go on long into the night, with next to no booze passing anyone\u2019s lips.  It could give the lie to the whole \u201cnecessity\u201d of drinking. Consider the Saudi Arabian fans this week, beside themselves with astonished joy as their team beat Argentina. Poor souls. If only they were allowed to drink alcohol, they\u2019d have been able to enjoy it properly, thought no one. Rebecca West, of all people, wrote something that gets to the heart of this. In her doorstopper of a travelogue about her journeys around Yugoslavia on the eve of the second world war, her Islamophobia is never far from the surface, so I hesitate to quote her on related matters. However, in what reads to me as an unintentional compliment, she says of \u201cthe Turks\u201d that their \u201creward for total abstinence from alcohol seems, illogically enough, to be the capacity for becoming intoxicated without it\u201d. The capacity to achieve intoxication without the benefit of alcohol is surely a life skill worth acquiring. I\u2019m getting there. Whether I can achieve intoxication without the benefit of football is another matter. \u2022 Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnist"

                    "body": "Manchester United have appointed lawyers to explore potential action against Cristiano Ronaldo for alleged breach of contract after claims made by the forward in a recent interview as the club seek to engineer his departure as quickly as possible.\nIt means Ronaldo will almost certainly never play for United again and it is understood the 37-year-old has been instructed not to return to the club\u2019s Carrington training base after his participation with Portugal in the World Cup in Qatar.\nWith Ronaldo wanting to leave and United intent on being rid of him, the question is how his exit will unfold. United\u2019s stance is that he should not receive a payoff and they would like the process completed as quickly as possible. Ronaldo\u2019s position is unclear, so the club are keeping all options on the table.\nUnited\u2019s strategy may be to hope that the threat of legal action will cause Ronaldo to offer to annul his contract. When speaking to Piers Morgan on Talk TV, Ronaldo made a series of allegations. These included that he is being forced out by the club, that senior executives lacked empathy after his newborn son died in April, that the owners, the Glazer family, do not care about the club, and that the manager, Erik ten Hag, does not respect him.\n\nOn Friday a club statement said: \u201cManchester United has this morning initiated appropriate steps in response to Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s recent media interview. We will not be making further comment until this process reaches its conclusion.\u201d\nRonaldo\u2019s contract is worth about \u00a3500,000 a week and expires in June. United had no prior knowledge of the interview given by Ronaldo, who wanted to leave in the summer. He is due to arrive in Doha on Friday at 11pm local time with the Portugal squad before the team\u2019s first training session on Saturday afternoon.\nRonaldo is in his second spell at United after a supremely successful six years that ended in 2009 with his having won three Premier Leagues, the FA Cup, two League Cups, the Champions League and the Ballon d\u2019Or. His individual contribution made him a hero for United fans and ranked him among the club\u2019s greatest players.\nRonaldo\u2019s return in summer 2021 was greeted ecstatically by supporters and hailed as a coup by Ten Hag\u2019s predecessor, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r. But in going public with his claims against United Ronaldo has seriously damaged this standing and status.\nThis followed his walking out before the end of the July friendly with Rayo Vallecano and October\u2019s 2-0 league win over Tottenham. Despite this, Ten Hag made Ronaldo captain for the league game at Aston Villa on 6 November, which United lost 3-1. It seems this will be his final appearance for the club."

                    "body": "Even for a player who remains the only man to have three World Cup winners\u2019 medals it was a bold prediction. \u201cAn African nation will win the World Cup before the year 2000,\u201d declared Pel\u00e9 \u2013 who had been persuaded to come out of retirement to play for New York Cosmos by Henry Kissinger three years earlier \u2013 on the eve of his final match in October 1977. Nearly five decades have passed since then and while there has undoubtedly been progress on the global stage, an African team has yet to smash through the ceiling of the quarter-finals. Morocco, led by the wily tactician Walid Regragui, will become the latest to attempt to go where Cameroon in 1990, Senegal in 2002 and \u2013 most heartbreakingly \u2013 Ghana in 2010 failed and reach the last four when they face Portugal on Saturday. The presence of all four of Africa\u2019s most successful nations at a World Cup may have been partly coincidental, although seasoned observers would point out that these countries have put in place a framework for sustained success on the international stage. Including Tunisia, seven wins from 15 matches during the group stages was the continent\u2019s best return. The Carthage Eagles recorded an historic win against France and Cameroon became the first African team to defeat Brazil, five times the winners, at the World Cup.  It is fitting the Atlas Lions will be the next to try their luck in reaching the semi-finals given Morocco became the first to pick up a point, at the 1970 World Cup. No African team had participated at a finals since Egypt 36 years earlier but Blagoje Vidinic\u2019s side took the lead against West Germany in their opening match in Mexico before losing 2-1 and went to secure a 1-1 draw against Bulgaria thanks to a goal from Maouhoub Ghazouani.  The midfielder was offered moves to Marseille and M\u00e1laga on the back of his exploits in Mexico but was not allowed to leave because he played for the military club AS FAR. While Zaire \u2013 sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s first representatives \u2013 were humbled 9-0 by Yugoslavia at the next World Cup, it looked as if Pel\u00e9 might have been on to something when Tunisia became the first African side to record a victory at the tournament in 1978 with a 3-1 win over Mexico.  Four years later, Algeria shocked the world by defeating West Germany in their opening match despite another bold prediction from one opposition player beforehand. \u201cWe will dedicate our seventh goal to our wives and the eighth to our dogs,\u201d he said. Algeria failed to progress from the group, however, after West Germany beat Austria 1-0, a result that meant that both countries went through, in a game that became known as the Disgrace of Gij\u00f3n. Cameroon \u2013 making the first of their record eight appearances at a finals and featuring a 30-year-old Roger Milla \u2013 also made an impact by returning home from Spain undefeated after three draws. Despite having what he has always argued was a legitimate goal disallowed for offside against Peru that would have sent them through, Milla would be back eight years later in Italy to score two goals in extra time against Colombia and take Cameroon into the quarter-finals to face England.  Morocco had been within three minutes of matching that at Mexico 86 after finishing top of their group, ahead of England \u2013 a historic milestone that heralded a new dawn for African football. \u201cAt the time I was living in the French suburbs and when Morocco beat Portugal it was the happiest I\u2019d ever been in my life,\u201d Regragui said. But after Gary Lineker broke Cameroon\u2019s hearts at Italia 90 and despite Nigeria claiming Africa\u2019s first gold medal in men\u2019s football at the 1996 Olympics, it would be another 12 years until an African side cracked the last eight again. Senegal\u2019s triumph thanks to Henri Camara\u2019s golden goal in extra time in the second round against Sweden \u2013 having already seen off the reigning champions, France \u2013 meant most people expected them to defeat Turkey in the quarter-finals. But substitute Ilhan Mansiz scored another golden goal in the fourth minute of extra time \u2013 the last before the rule was scrapped by Fifa \u2013 after a drab 90 minutes to deny them a place in the last four.  It was Ghana\u2019s turn eight years later at the first World Cup on African soil, as South Africa made unwanted history by becoming the first hosts to go out in the group stages, despite beating France in their final match. Ghana had the whole continent behind them then. Had it not been for Luis Su\u00e1rez\u2019s infamous handball to deny Dominic Adiyiah\u2019s goal-bound header and Asamoah Gyan\u2019s subsequent penalty miss at Soccer City in Johannesburg then the Black Stars would have played the Netherlands in the semi-finals.  And so to Qatar. Morocco\u2019s players will carry not only the hopes and dreams of Africa when they face Portugal but of the Arab world as well. Having seen his father\u2019s dream of his country becoming the first in Africa to host the World Cup ended after three failed bids, the king of Morocco, Mohammed VI \u2013 who congratulated Regragui on the phone after the victory against Spain \u2013 had a bid for the 2026 tournament rejected. But a huge investment in the country\u2019s football infrastructure, including the impressive Mohammed VI training complex in Ma\u00e2mora that cost $65m to build, is clearly yielding results. \u201cWe are trying to be a powerhouse in Africa,\u201d said Regragui. \u201cThe continent is moving forward, Morocco has made a lot of effort. I arrived in 2013 and since then I have seen the stadiums evolve, the federation has made enormous efforts, his majesty has invested a lot of resources. Now, we must not fall asleep, we must continue.\u201d"

The Chelsea forward also reiterated USA\u2019s support for the LGBTQ+ community, saying they want to \u201cbe the change\u201d, the team\u2019s motto.\n\nPulisic said USA, who face Wales in their opening game on Monday, are setting out to change the script.

                    "body": "England\u2019s defensive problems have deepened after Chelsea\u2019s Ben Chilwell was ruled out of the Qatar World Cup with a torn hamstring. Chilwell, who limped off during Chelsea\u2019s victory over Dinamo Zagreb on Wednesday, received the devastating news after undergoing a scan on Friday. The left-back was in with a good chance of being included in England\u2019s 26-man squad for Qatar but is now facing a lengthy time on the sidelines after tests revealed he has suffered a \u201csignificant\u201d hamstring tear.  The one positive for Chilwell, who had battled back to fitness after recovering from a serious knee injury, is that he does not require surgery. But the 25-year-old, who was hopeful of competing with Luke Shaw for a place as England\u2019s starting left wing-back, is unlikely to be available for Chelsea immediately after the World Cup finishes. He could be out for at least three months.  Chilwell, who returned to action in May having missed much of last season after sustaining anterior cruciate ligament damage, wrote on Twitter: \u201cFollowing my ACL injury I worked so hard to make sure I was ready for the World Cup. It has always been a dream of mine. Unfortunately this won\u2019t be possible following my scan results. I\u2019ll do all I can to get back playing for Chelsea ASAP. Thanks for the messages of support.\u201d It is a major blow for Gareth Southgate, who is sweating on the fitness of Reece James, Kalvin Phillips and Kyle Walker before naming his final squad this Thursday. It remains to be seen whether England\u2019s manager chooses to pick Leicester\u2019s James Justin, Tottenham\u2019s Ryan Sessegnon or Southampton\u2019s Kyle Walker-Peters, who is unlikely to play again before the World Cup because of a hamstring injury. The alternative would be to use the versatile Newcastle right-back Kieran Trippier as Shaw\u2019s deputy. The Arsenal winger Bukayo Saka played at left wing-back during England\u2019s recent defeat by Italy. An issue around using Trippier on the left is that England, who play their opening game against Iran on 21 November, are short of options on the right. James was set to start at right wing-back but is out with a knee injury. Walker is yet to return from groin surgery, though Pep Guardiola has said the Manchester City right-back will be fit. Guardiola has also made optimistic noises about Phillips but the midfielder is recovering from a shoulder injury and has not played since 14 September."

                    "body": "Whether the United States depart the Middle East having accomplished Gregg Berhalter\u2019s clearly articulated goal of changing the way the world perceives American soccer is an open question. The overall result following Saturday\u2019s defeat to the Netherlands, which laid bare just how far the Americans have to go before contending with the world\u2019s elite, doesn\u2019t offer a clear answer. After surpassing the tempered expectations of supporters back home by getting out of a tough group but falling short of their own lofty goals, the wholly reconstructed US team made it exactly as far as their previous two appearances at the tournament: to the last 16 and out. But for all the flaws exposed on Saturday, the United States\u2019 promising core of young players bodes well moving forward. At a time when more American prospects than ever before are spending their teenage years in Europe, more than half of Berhalter\u2019s 26-man squad was drawn from the world\u2019s top five leagues, including Christian Pulisic (Chelsea), Sergi\u00f1o Dest (Milan), Weston McKennie (Juventus) and Tyler Adams (Leeds United). Nineteen of them made their World Cup debuts in Qatar, a record total for a US team.  They started three of the youngest starting XIs in this tournament and four of the youngest five. Eight of Berhalter\u2019s choices for the Netherlands match were 25 or younger \u2013 Antonee Robinson (25); McKennie (24), Pulisic (24), Adams (23), Dest (22), Tim Weah (22), Jes\u00fas Ferreira (21), Yunus Musah (who turned 20 this week) \u2013 and each of them will be highly motivated by the acid memory of Saturday\u2019s heartbreak at the Khalifa International Stadium. \u201cI do feel like we made some progress,\u201d Berhalter said. \u201cWhen people look at our team, they see a clear identity. They see guys that go out and fight for each other. They see the talent on the field. We made progress, but on this particular night we came up short.\u201d What we do know for certain is the next time all those young US players come together for a World Cup match, it will take place on home soil, representing a golden opportunity for what\u2019s been touted as a golden generation of American players who will be in their presumptive primes. Far less clear is whether Berhalter is the correct person to lead them. It\u2019s a decision that will come to a head soon enough with Berhalter\u2019s $1.29m-per-year contract due to expire at the end of the month. \u201cFor the last month-and-a-half, I only focused on the World Cup, only focused on achieving things with this group,\u201d Berhalter said. \u201cOver the next couple of weeks, I\u2019ll clear my head, sit down, and think about what\u2019s next.\u201d The 47-year-old deserves credit for taking over a program still reeling from the Catastrophe at Couva, ending a string of seven straight World Cup finals appearances, and getting the US back to the sport\u2019s biggest stage. His 71.1% winning percentage is the highest of any USMNT coach in history, a fact that may surprise even the team\u2019s most dedicated followers. He was instrumental in winning the recruiting battles for Dest and Musah, a pair of dual-nationals who have established themselves as feature players on this journey. He won the inaugural Concacaf Nations League, then the Gold Cup and guided the team through a challenging qualifying campaign for the World Cup, where they got out of the only group in which all four teams ranked in the top 20 of Fifa\u2019s world rankings. But the brighter spotlight of the World Cup stage brought greater scrutiny of Berhalter\u2019s squad selection, substitutions and in-game adjustments, prompting criticism that he was tactically overwhelmed at this level. Whoever is chosen to take the United States forward will have plenty on their plate. For all the valid concerns over identifying a goalscoring center forward, squad depth will be a vital issue if reaching the quarter-finals or better is on the cards. A number of key players, including the midfield trio of Adams, McKennie and Musah, were clearly exhausted after leaving it all on the field during the group stage. Not only will the US require more players able to spell them at their standard, but a manager capable of pushing the right buttons. There\u2019s also a question of keeping the team\u2019s match-toughness sharp during the long four years ahead. The three-week Gold Cup starts at the end of June 2023, with most Europe-based players expected to be in the mix. But the United States\u2019 status as automatic qualifiers for the next World Cup will deprive them of many opportunities for competitive matches. US Soccer should look to play in Copa Am\u00e9rica as a guest nation and to schedule more friendlies against elite opponents to test themselves, preferably away from home and in hostile environments. The cycle will start again in January when the United States start running it back with a pair of friendlies against Serbia and Colombia. The Americans have plenty to take pride in after their return to the World Cup after an eight-year absence, but the real work has only just begun. \u201cWe didn\u2019t qualify for the last World Cup and here we are in the round of 16. We\u2019ve definitely come a long way,\u201d Pulisic said on Saturday. \u201cThere\u2019s moments that we can be proud of. But we don\u2019t want to feel like this again, and we want to put ourselves in a position to win tournaments like this.\u201d"

If it is any consolation, this history maker should be back. Messi will not. But now, 16 years after his first attempt, it had actually happened. Argentina had won the World Cup, their first since 1986. Messi had the one thing missing. One? It felt like Argentina had to win this three times, experiencing enough emotion for a lifetime, taken to heaven and to hell and back again.\nGonzalo Montiel had just rolled in the penalty that made them world champions, dashing off as teammates crumpled to the ground. That much you knew, but it was an effort to grasp what had gone before. What mattered was coming next. It was 9.31pm when Messi approached the cup and gently kissed it. He had been called to get the golden ball, made to wait a little longer to lift the actual cup, but he couldn\u2019t just walk past. He would be back to raise it to the sky.\n\nMuchachos, the soundtrack of this month, rang around: land of Messi and Maradona, we got our hope back, it runs. The hope, which is what kills you, had been snatched from them repeatedly but they pulled it back, as if some cosmic force was at play. Which in a way it was; more than one of them, in fact.\nTwice Argentina led, twice France equalised, and as it went to penalties it was easy to allow fatalism in, to believe it was happening again, football cruelly refusing to return what he had given so generously for two decades; 2014, 2015, 2016, and now 2022: four finals lost after extra time, three on penalties.\nNot this time. Copa Am\u00e9rica winners in 2021, this is a different Argentina. It is a different Messi too, a liberated version, the essence of everything he has been. So when the shootout came, it was not punishment so much as opportunity, Messi rolling in the first so easily Hugo Lloris almost had time to go down and get up again. For the third time in this wild, wild game he had the ball in the net.\nHe had scored the opener with a penalty and Argentina took a 2-0 lead that seemed secure, his old friend Di Mar\u00eda superb, but instead they managed to make an epic of this. An outrageous shot at 2-2, a cartoon moment, had almost won it in the last minute. Just as it felt like everything was slipping away, a far less aesthetic moment arrived. Messi scrambled home late in extra time to put them on the verge of the title again, the 793rd and worst goal of his career looking likely to be the very best. Instead, they were instead taken to penalties by an extraordinary Mbapp\u00e9 hat-trick.\n\nThere, Dibu Mart\u00ednez was the hero and Montiel ended it. This was about all of them, but it was about Messi. There was Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez, who begged him to stay after he retired six years ago now. Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez, the kid who waited for his autograph. Rodrigo De Paul and Leandro Paredes, who had invited him to a mate, this team in the making. The extraordinary Alexis Mac Allister, who argues with his dad that Messi is the best ever and seemed hellbent on proving it here. Even Sergio Ag\u00fcero, the friend called to the squad to share a room with him like old times.\nAnd of course Lionel Scaloni, there at the start and there now at the end. On Messi\u2019s first international appearance, he was the teammate defending the teenager sent off inside two minutes; now, 17 years, 172 games, 98 goals and one World Cup win later, he was there again, the manager who finally made it all work, justice done. Go get the cup, you\u2019ve earned it. We\u2019ve earned it for you.\n\nOn a stage shaped like infinity, they draped him in an emir\u2019s robe and handed him the trophy. He wasn\u2019t in a hurry to hand it on. He took it in his hands and gazed at every inch of it, turning it slowly. He held it like a child. His actual children soon joined. This was his cup; there has never been a story like this, a competition so centred around one man \u2013 although an immense challenger appeared here \u2013 everyone waiting for the finishing touch, the perfect farewell. S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung likened it to a crowd gathering to see Michelangelo apply the final brushstroke.\nHe had played here like destiny called, breaking records, as he has always has. Look at those scattergraphs and so often he\u2019s a lone dot, like some far away planet. This is the man who exhausted adjectives and invented a new category: \u201capart from Messi\u201d. At 35, his two goals here took him past Pel\u00e9. Only Mbapp\u00e9 scored more in Qatar than his seven goals plus two penalties in shootouts and no one provided more assists.\nIt wasn\u2019t just a storyline; it was him, every step. The release against Mexico and the flash of fire against Australia. His assists made Claudio Caniggia of Nahuel Molina and a complete wreck of Josko Gvardiol. No one had ever scored in the last 16, the quarter-finals, the semi\u2011finals and the final before. En route he saw off Robert Lewandowski and Luka Modric. Now, he had survived Mbapp\u00e9. Game over, Messi wins."

                    "body": "On a corner of my desk stands a giant stack of external hard drives. They hold the story, gigabyte after gigabyte, of almost a decade of reporting on the lives of Nepal\u2019s migrant workers in the World Cup host nation, Qatar. On one, I recently found a photo from July 2013 of Tilak Bishwakarma holding a picture of his son Ganesh. When he left his home for Qatar, Ganesh was a teenager hoping to earn some money to support his impoverished family. Two months later his body was brought home in a coffin. I opened another photo, showing a tattered piece of paper, listing the names of 22 other Nepali workers who died in Qatar that July. Beside each name is written the cause of death: electrocution, falls, road traffic accident. On 17 July came Ganesh\u2019s name. Cause of death: cardiac arrest. Ganesh\u2019s short life formed part of a major investigation into the treatment of Qatar\u2019s vast low-wage migrant workforce (almost 90% of the country\u2019s population comprises migrant workers). It revealed an appalling catalogue of abuses \u2013 overcrowded, filthy accommodation, passport confiscation and non-payment of wages \u2013 which in some cases may have amounted to forced labour, a modern form of slavery. When the Guardian published its exclusive story in September 2013 after I saw the coffins of Nepali workers returning home from the Gulf, it made headlines around the world. Football was literally coming down to a matter of life and death. There was something deeply offensive about the exploitation of some of the world\u2019s poorest people in the name of a festival of sport. Fifa immediately said it was \u201cvery concerned\u201d, though clearly not concerned enough to have done its own due diligence. The next day Qatar\u2019s World Cup organisers sent a letter to the game\u2019s governing body assuring it that they viewed the Guardian\u2019s findings with the \u201cutmost seriousness\u201d. Attached to the letter was a one-page \u201cWorkers\u2019 Charter\u201d setting out, in skeletal form, their commitment to workers\u2019 rights.  For the next nine years, that commitment would be relentlessly tested and challenged by the Guardian\u2019s reporting. (If you value our dogged pursuit of justice, safety and fairness, please consider supporting our journalism today.) We exposed how workers from North Korea were building a tower block \u2013 now a luxury hotel booked up by football fans \u2013 under conditions likely to constitute slave labour. We documented the poverty wages being paid to the men constructing the new stadiums. In 2014 one told us he was earning overtime pay the equivalent of 45 pence an hour. Four years later another said his basic wage worked out at 60 pence an hour \u2013 10,000 times less than the reported earnings of Lionel Messi. We revealed that thousands of south Asian workers had died in Qatar in the decade after it won the right to host the World Cup, many from sudden and unexplained causes. The Qatari authorities have done little to investigate these deaths and countless families of the deceased have not received compensation from their employers.  Last year we found workers employed at opulent Fifa-endorsed hotels trapped by recruitment debts and rogue employers, earning less in a month than the cost of a standard room for a night. And in September we revealed that some labourers at World Cup stadiums were living in squalid, windowless cabins on the edge of the desert. Low-wage migrant workers face a cruel choice: stay at home and suffer, or take the risk and go abroad. For some the gamble pays off \u2013 money is sent home, houses are rebuilt and children sent to school \u2013 but for too many it\u2019s a bet they lose. Reporting from Qatar is not easy, but the only way to really tell this story is to be on the ground, feel the searing heat, see the overcrowded labour camps and listen. And that\u2019s the hardest part. People are afraid to speak, because however tough their circumstances are, they need the work, so why put that at risk to talk to a journalist? Before each trip I agree protocols with my editor in the event that I\u2019m detained (as a number of journalists have been). Once in Qatar, I am constantly looking over my shoulder, metaphorically and literally. Interviews take place at night, or parked up on a quiet street or in the back of a nondescript restaurant. But by working independently and undercover we have been able to expose what they hoped to keep hidden.  So as the World Cup kicks off, if you value reading about the action in the stadiums, but also about the people who built them, please consider supporting a news organisation determined to expose the truth behind the slick PR of Big Football and the Gulf petrocrats. You can fund our work today, from just \u00a31. If you can, please consider giving a little more each month or year. It makes a difference. The cumulative pressure of our reporting, alongside the work of human rights groups and trade unions, forced the Qatari authorities to belatedly introduce a number of new laws that have the potential to create real change for low-wage workers. The abusive kafala system, under which workers cannot change jobs without their employer\u2019s permission, has \u2013 on paper \u2013 been abolished and a minimum wage has been introduced. The reforms have neither gone far enough nor been implemented rigorously. But that\u2019s why this work matters. When the Qatari authorities and Fifa make overblown claims about what they have achieved, we will challenge them. Our reporters know that it\u2019s about so much more than what happens on the pitch. Support vital, investigative Guardian journalism today."

                    "body": "Good morning. The US supreme court will allow a congressional committee to receive copies of Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns, ending a three-year battle by the Democratic-led body to see the documents the former president has refused to release since his first White House bid. The court did not accompany its decision with any public comment, but it rejected Trump\u2019s plea for an order that would have prevented the Treasury department from giving six years of tax returns for Trump and some of his businesses to the house ways and means committee. The influential committee will continue to be led by a Democratic party chair, in this case the Massachusetts congressman Richard Neal, until the new Congress is sworn in January with the Republicans in the majority and therefore filling committee chairs, following the midterm elections. It was Trump\u2019s second loss at the supreme court in as many months, and third this year.  What were the other losses? In October, the court refused to step into the legal fight surrounding the FBI search of Trump\u2019s Florida estate that turned up classified documents. In January, the court refused to stop the National Archives from turning over documents to the special house panel investigating the 6 January 2021 insurrection. How should the media cover Trump\u2019s 2024 run? We would like to hear from people in the US about how the media should cover Trump\u2019s candidacy. Share your views here.  Up to 10 people killed in shooting at Walmart in Chesapeake, Virginia  A shooting at a Walmart in Chesapeake, Virginia, has left up to 10 people dead and wounded, local authorities say. The shooter was among the dead, the City of Chesapeake tweeted on Tuesday. It said: \u201cChesapeake police confirm an active shooter incident with fatalities at the Walmart on Sam\u2019s Circle. The shooter is deceased.\u201d Leo Kosinski, a spokesperson with the police department, said in a brief news conference that police received reports of a shooting at 10pm and arrived to find multiple fatalities. The shooting is thought to have stopped when police arrived, said Kosinski, adding that he did not believe police had fired shots, but could not say whether the shooter died of a self-inflicted gunshot. It was unclear how many people had died, but Kosinski said \u201cno more\u201d than 10 people were killed.  How many people are injured? Mike Kafka, a spokesperson for Sentara healthcare, said five patients from the Walmart were being treated at Norfolk general hospital.   US corporations gave more than $8m to election deniers\u2019 midterm campaigns  Some of the best-known corporations in the US, including AT&amp;T, Boeing, Delta Air Lines and the Home Depot, collectively poured more than $8m into supporting election deniers running for US house and Senate seats in this month\u2019s midterm elections, writes Ed Pilkington. A study by the non-partisan government watchdog organization Accountable.US, based on the latest filings to the Federal Election Commission, reveals the extent to which big corporations were prepared to back Republican nominees despite their open peddling of false claims undermining confidence in democracy. Though many were ultimately unsuccessful in their election bids, the candidates included several prominent advocates of Trump\u2019s lie that the 2020 presidential election had been stolen from him. At the top of the list of 20 corporations backing election deniers through their political action committees (Pacs) is a familiar name in the world of rightwing agitating: Koch Industries. According to the Accountable.US review, the Koch energy conglomerate spent $771,000 through its Pac on Republican candidates with a track record of casting doubt on elections. Koch Industries is the second-largest privately owned company in the US. It has been notorious for using its largely oil-related profits to push conservative politics in an anti-government, anti-regulatory direction under its owners, the brothers Charles Koch and David Koch (David died in 2019).  How much did the other companies spend? The American Crystal Sugar Company Pac spent $630,000; the AT&amp;T Inc Employee Federal Pac contributed $579,000 and the Home Depot Inc Pac gave $578,000. Meanwhile, the Comcast Corporation and NBC Universal Pac contributed $365,000, and the Delta Air Lines Pac gave $278,000.  In other news \u2026   An overnight rocket attack struck a hospital maternity ward in southern Ukraine, killing a newborn baby, Ukrainian authorities have said. The child\u2019s mother and a doctor were pulled alive from the rubble. The region\u2019s governor said the rockets were Russian, AP reported. Large-scale protests broke out at Foxconn\u2019s vast iPhone factory in Zhengzhou, central China, images circulating on Weibo and Twitter appeared to show. Videos showed hundreds of workers marching on a road in daylight, with some being confronted by a row of riot police and people in hazmat suits. The Scottish parliament can not hold a second independence referendum without Westminster approval, the UK supreme court has ruled. The unanimous judgment is likely to anger Scottish nationalists who say the country\u2019s future is for Scottish voters to decide. The second woman to allege that she was pressured into having an abortion by Herschel Walker, the Republican nominee in Georgia\u2019s hotly contested US Senate race, on Tuesday presented previously unseen letters, audio recordings and pages of her personal diary that she said were evidence of their relationship, which he has denied.  Qatar World Cup: Saudi celebrates shock win as the row over rainbows continues  We had our first big shock of the tournament on Tuesday as Argentina, one of the favorites for the tournament, were beaten by Saudi Arabia, in one of the biggest upsets in World Cup history. Saudi Arabia declared a national holiday in celebration, while a reworked version of Argentina\u2019s triband flag \u2013 in which the yellow sun at the center weeps uncontrollably \u2013 went viral on social media in Brazil. The reigning champions, France, saw off Australia 4-1 after falling behind in the first half, with a commanding performance that suggests they have every intent on keeping their title. Fifa met Qatari officials after Wales fans had rainbow-themed hats confiscated before their team\u2019s match with the USA on Monday. Fifa reminded the hosts of their assurances before the tournament that everyone was welcome and rainbow flags would be allowed. Qatari authorities brought a new level of ridiculousness to their war on rainbows when security staff tried to confiscate the state flag of Brazil\u2019s Pernambuco, which features a rainbow. Elsewhere at the World Cup:  Three of the big guns play their opening matches on Wednesday. 2014 champions Germany play Japan (8am ET), 2010 champions Spain face Costa Rica (11am), and the supremely talented Belgium round out the action when they take on Canada (2pm ET). It is the Canadians\u2019 first appearance at a men\u2019s World Cup since 1986 (the women\u2019s team are the reigning Olympic champions). Matches are lasting longer at this World Cup. Fifa has asked officials to more accurately monitor when a game is stopped for goal celebrations, time wasting, video assistant referee decisions, substitutions, penalties and red cards \u2013 even if it means extending a match by many minutes. England\u2019s match on Monday against Iran lasted a record-breaking 117 minutes. Wondering where Argentina\u2019s loss to Saudi Arabia ranks in the history of World Cup upsets? We have a handy list for you \u2013 and a victory for the US back in 1950 heads the pack.  Stat of the day: California legislature is 10% LGBTQ+ in record-setting year nationwide  Amid a rise in anti-LGBTQ+ hate across the US, California reached a milestone in this year\u2019s midterm elections: at least 10% of its lawmakers identify publicly as LGBTQ+, a figure believed to be a first for any legislature in the country. With 12 current or soon-to-be members of the legislature identifying as LGBTQ+, the statehouse has roughly reached parity in sexual orientation and gender identity \u2013 9.1% of Californians are LGBT, according to the US census. The legislators, all Democrats, say that despite the wins, much work remains in California and the US, including the fallout from Florida\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t say gay\u201d law Don\u2019t miss this: Is it time to get rid of the Thanksgiving turkey?  The Thanksgiving turkey is a golden idol, sitting at the center of the dinner table, so Thanksgiving without it is inconceivable, right? This may be the year we test that theory. Thanksgiving dinner will cost an average of 20% more than last year, owing to price increases in ingredients such as butter, cooking oil and sweet potatoes. On top of that inflation, there\u2019s a turkey shortage because of an outbreak of avian flu which, as of late October, had killed 6 million turkeys across the US. So, here\u2019s a radical proposal: maybe in this Thanksgiving of the turkey shortage, it\u2019s time to do away with the big bird \u2013 and its sleep-inducing tryptophan \u2013 altogether. Last Thing: Oldest cooked leftovers ever found suggest Neanderthals were foodies  If you thought Neanderthals survived on a diet of foraged berries and uncooked animal flesh, think again. Charred remnants of what appear be the world\u2019s oldest cooked meal ever found have been unearthed in a cave complex in northern Iraq, prompting speculation that Neanderthals may have been foodies. \u201cOur findings are the first real indication of complex cooking \u2013 and thus of food culture \u2013 among Neanderthals,\u201d said Chris Hunt, the professor who coordinated the excavation. Hunt and his colleagues have even tried to recreate one of the recipes. \u201cIt made a sort of pancake-cum-flatbread which was really very palatable \u2013 a sort of nutty taste,\u201d Hunt said.

                    "body": "After all the hysteria and innuendo of a transfer deadline day had been poured into a few weeks of World Cup squad speculation, Socceroos coach Graham Arnold finally named his 26-player squad for football\u2019s global showcase on Tuesday. It is a group full of what Arnold called \u201cboxing Kangaroos\u201d. Fresh as this new slogan may be, the motif and messaging represents a continuation of the fighting spirit that has been a hallmark of Arnold\u2019s tenure \u2013 not least when qualification for the tournament in Qatar became less certain and backs were against the wall.  For much of that qualifying process, it was about expecting to win. After the wheels came off, it was about \u201cAussie DNA\u201d and nostalgia for a bygone and rose-tinted era where Australian teams ran all day, backed themselves in and fought like hell. Now, it\u2019s about Australia\u2019s signature marsupial clad in combat apparel for games against France, Tunisia and Denmark.  It was inevitable, really. Having reached this point employing a combative ethos over all else, was there ever any question the coach would stick with it for the tournament in Qatar?  But what of the squad itself? Garang Kuol, Jason Cummings, and Cameron Devlin are all in; Adam Taggart, Mitch Langerak, Tom Rogic, and Trent Sainsbury will watch from home. Reflective of the country that Australia tries to be, four who arrived in Australia as refugees will represent their home on the grandest stage in Kuol, Milo\u0161 Degenek, Thomas Deng, and Awer Mabil. Another four will represent the land of their parents in Scotland-born Cummings, Harry Souttar, and Martin Boyle and Croatia-born Fran Kara\u010di\u0107. Seventeen will be taking part in their first World Cup and, combined with a talented crop of players overlooked or still coming through the system, it is a squad that engenders enthusiasm not only for the coming weeks, but also for future Asian Cups and World Cups. This is something for which Arnold rightfully deserves credit. Kuol\u2019s selection alone is a story that will capture imaginations far beyond Australia\u2019s borders.  Broadly, though, despite a long-stated desire to reward players who have been getting regular game time with their clubs and then excelling, Arnold\u2019s squad contains an eclectic mix of some in-form players and others with strong reputations. Some of this is by necessity; simply too few of the available pool of talent are injury-free and playing regularly to justify using form as a sole metric for selection. Having principles is all well and good but if Fifa\u2019s showpiece event is good for one thing, it is as a demonstration that they also don\u2019t get you too far ahead in football. Ajdin Hrustic\u0301, for example, should have been included even if only on one leg.  An immediate flow-on from this, though, is that one of the biggest immediate questions facing the squad is fitness. Arnold has said he is a risk taker and will not change (selection and matters of approach are obviously different things) but six potential starters have spent various degrees of time on the shelf during the build-up to this World Cup. Then there are the players who haven\u2019t been injured, but have hardly seen minutes on the field. Joel King and Awer Mabil, for example, have largely been relegated to the periphery of their clubs but are still preferred over the likes of Jason Davidson, Marco Tilio or Daniel Arzani. Overlooked right-back Ryan Strain must be wondering what more he needs to do. Given that Mat Ryan has largely been a No 2 in recent years and has reportedly picked up a knock, the omission of Langerak is also perplexing. The 34-year-old has consistently been Australia\u2019s best-performing goalkeeper in clubland for years but has been overlooked for Andrew Redmayne and Danny Vukovic on the advice of goalkeeping coach John Crawley. Former Socceroo Tommy Oar labelled the decision \u201can absolute wind-up\u201d and even being charitable, it\u2019s hard to disagree with that assessment. Nonetheless, acknowledgement is needed that, further up the pitch, Arnold has focused on form. The inclusions of Keanu Baccus and Devlin over Denis Genreau and Connor Metcalfe come off the back of strong domestic seasons in Scotland, while that of Cummings is validation of his form for the Mariners. Rogic\u2019s absence can be justified by his inclusion likely causing either Riley McGree or Hrustic\u0301 to miss out. Mat Leckie, Craig Goodwin, and Jamie Maclaren have all been standouts in the opening weeks of ALM. At the back, Arnold\u2019s move to drop his own son-in-law Sainsbury takes gumption.   But regardless of intellectual consistency (why should Australian football start worrying about that now?) the squad is set. All that is left now is for the players selected to get through one last weekend of football before the roos lace up their gloves in Doha. "

                    "body": "The trade union leading attempts to improve conditions for migrant workers in Qatar has warned that a positive World Cup legacy is unlikely after proposals for a migrant workers\u2019 centre and wider reform were met with \u201cdeafening silence\u201d by government officials.\nThe Building and Wood Workers\u2019 International has been working with the Qatari government since 2016 and was part of a collective effort that led two years ago to the abolition of the kafala system, under which workers could not change jobs without their employer\u2019s permission. Union officials, however, now believe that attempts to cement change \u2013 including the creation of a migrant workers\u2019 centre \u2013 have been stonewalled and see \u201cno sign that sustainable change is coming\u201d.\nThe news will come as a blow to those within football and outside who had been clinging to the prospect of salvaging a positive outcome for a World Cup characterised by human rights concerns, chief among them the deaths of more than 6,500 migrant workers since the tournament was awarded to Qatar in 2010.\n\n\u201cAfter more than a decade of the Campaign for Decent Work around the Fifa World Cup Qatar 2022, two days ahead of the tournament, the Building and Wood Workers\u2019 International \u2026 calls on the Qatari authorities to join with BWI to build on and expand improvements made and to establish a migrant workers\u2019 centre that will enable workers to have a say in their destinies,\u201d the organisation said.\n\u201cThat is a legacy for Qatar and the world that will live on beyond the end of the World Cup tournament. However, to date, there is no sign that sustainable change is forthcoming.\u201d\nThe BWI made three requests to the Qatari labour ministry a year ago, asking for the establishment of a workers\u2019 centre, implementation of higher health and safety regulations in the construction sector, and more consistent enforcement of the changes already agreed.\nThe BWI said \u201cit was regrettable\u201d that it had \u201cstill not received a response on any of the positive initiatives. Instead, there has been a deafening silence. In football terms, migrant workers are playing the extra time and the result is still unknown.\u201d\nWhereas some groups have called for a boycott the BWI had chosen to engage with Qatar. The union believes progress has been made. \u201cOn several occasions, BWI has recognised advances made in Qatar in recent years on labour legislation,\u201d it said. Its disappointment is now tangible and has led to frustration with the Qatari government and the tournament organisers, Fifa, which the BWI accuses of failing to live up to its own standards on human rights.\n\u201cFifa adopted a human rights policy and BWI was represented on a small body to oversee progress\u201d the union said. \u201cThe policy spells out its commitment to respect all internationally recognised human rights and to promote the protection of these rights. This includes supporting, accompanying, and sustaining reforms and enabling further advances in the protection of the human rights of migrant workers in Qatar toward and beyond 2022.\n\u201cHowever, Fifa\u2019s human rights commitments no longer seem to receive the same priority that they did when the policies were developed and adopted. There is a fundamental conflict between a strong human rights policy and a \u2018business as usual\u2019 approach.\u201d\nA Qatari government official said: \u201cQatar remains in close dialogue with all its international partners, including the Building and Wood Workers\u2019 International and the International Labour Organization (ILO), about the future of our labour reform programme.\n\u201cQatar first entered its cooperation programme with the ILO in 2017, marking the opening of the first regional project office. We extended this fruitful partnership through 2023 in order to further support the implementation of reforms. Qatar is committed to its journey of progress. What we have achieved in a few short years took decades to achieve in other parts of the world, and in many countries, this process is still ongoing.\n\u201cTransforming our labour market and protecting the rights of all workers in Qatar is a priority for our government that will continue long after the end of the World Cup.\u201d\nFifa has been approached for comment."

England fans were given 7,000 official tickets but about 12-15,000 supporters are expected at Al Bayt stadium on Saturday night, with expats from the Gulf region flying in to swell the numbers. On Friday afternoon England fans without tickets were being offered category one seats for \u00a3850 and category two for \u00a3575 \u2013 broadly three times more than the cost price.  Despite the increased number of England fans in Qatar there has not been a single arrest, with police attributing that to a lack of alcohol and drugs. \u201cClearly the difficulty in accessing alcohol and cocaine has had a calming effect on some of our supporters,\u201d Ch Supt Steve Graham, the most senior British officer out in Doha, put it this week. \u201cBut they also deserve praise for the carnival atmosphere, with fans from different countries happily mixing and enjoying the World Cup.\u201d Meanwhile Qatari security forces will have enhanced measures in place for Morocco\u2019s quarter-final against Portugal after the disturbances outside the ground before the game against Spain. Sources close to the organisers said they expected Morocco fans without tickets to try to get into the 44,000-seat Al Thumama Stadium for the country\u2019s biggest game in its history. Morocco have more fans here than any other country and yet more have arrived since they dramatically won their last-16 shootout against Spain. As a result police will have a number of soft ticket checks outside the ground as well as a large security presence. It comes after multiple skirmishes between riot police and Morocco supporters amid chaotic scenes outside Al Rayyan\u2019s Education City Stadium on Tuesday.Security forces, who also deployed mounted officers and dogs, dragged away at least three people in the most serious trouble of the World Cup. One policeman fell off his horse in the disturbances.Organisers blamed the trouble on hundreds of ticketless fans, who they said had tried to force their way into the ground. However others who were caught in the melee insisted they had legitimate tickets \u2013 and feared they could have been seriously hurt. There were also issues with some Morocco fans before their match against Canada, with some trying to climb a fence, although most have behaved impeccably."

                    "body": "We need a new word for this thing. Psychologists have sometimes used the phrase \u201csemantic satiation\u201d to describe the process where saying the word \u201cwoodpecker\u201d 20 times in a row, or sitting in a circle reciting the phrase \u201cstraight-leg easy-fit chinos\u201d will eventually strip those sounds of any meaning, as though the entire concept of straight-leg easy-fit chinos has suddenly ceased to exist. Something like this has happened to the word \u201csportswashing\u201d. This was always a hopeful coinage, adopted on the hoof to describe governments or other entities that use elite sport as a propaganda tool. Years of heavy use, first by Azerbaijani human rights activists, then Amnesty International, then by the news and sports pages, have left it looking a little baggy.  By now sportswashing has been adopted among apologists as a kind of internet eyeroll, with a vague sense it belongs in the same company as \u201cwokery\u201d, or having feelings or taking offence at an emoji. Here they come. The bleeding hearts. The liberals. The dispossessed and the dead. How serious can something with \u201cwashing\u201d in its name really be? You have to hand it to Qatar 2022. The opening game is just over a month away and still every question, from what words to use, to Ruben Loftus-Cheek\u2019s confusing early-season squad-bolt as an ambling central pivot, leads you back to the same basic ground. Why is the World Cup happening in Qatar anyway? We still don\u2019t have a clear answer. The consequences and related causes have been examined in granular detail, from Fifa corruption, to human rights abuse to the vainglorious ambition of the hyper-rich. But there is still a blank at the heart of this vast, onerous enterprise; an absence of any real notion of why.  Maybe some numbers will help. This week the last of 200 Royal Air Force personnel were deployed to Qatar\u2019s Dukhan airbase, part of Project Thariyat, a joint World Cup-veiled security mission. Did anyone notice back in 2020 that the RAF had formed a joint air force squadron with Qatar, the only joint squadron with anyone since the second world war? But then Qatar also has 24 shiny new British Typhoon jets and Hawk Mk167s. And this is not a private party. Welcome to Qatar 2022, where the world comes together, and does so seriously tooled up. Expect Amazing. Expect to be part of a vast geopolitical security operation. Qatar has 3,250 Turkish security officers. Qatar has South Korean military specialists teaching \u201cclose combat skills\u201d. Qatar has Nato looking after chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats. Qatari airspace is policed by Kronos radar, Electronic Warfare Compact Airborne Threat Surveyor, the Transmission Data Link SkyDome and the famed DroneHunter attack system. Qatar has 36 US F-15QA fighter jets and 24 US Apache helicopter gunships. Qatar has 28 NH90 helicopters from Italy, and 36 Rafales and two A330 MRTT aerial refuelling planes from France. Qatar has the eyes of the world. Qatar has the Glastonbury spider. Qatar has David Beckham. And quite clearly in this company the World Cup is a weapon too. The Glastonbury spider is a weapon. David Beckham is a weapon. Perhaps you thought Beckham was simply a tool, or an instrument. But he is also a weapon, and a massive weapon judging by his price tag.  It feels like stating the obvious, but sometimes the obvious has to be stated. What this World Cup is really about is security. Not trying to be liked, or putting on a face for concerned liberals in economically challenged corners of western Europe. Qatar doesn\u2019t need to be liked, or to diversify into packaged golfing holidays. Qatar has 200 years of natural gas. Absurdly rich and absurdly small, Qatar wants to be visible on the map. This is not sportswashing. This is Hard Sports Power. And in the end we in the are simply bystanders, suppliers, accessories. It helps to get a little perspective. Qatar declared independence from Britain only in 1972. As a modern self-governing state it\u2019s younger than Gareth Southgate. The years either side of the World Cup bid have been dotted with talk of coups and the Gulf cold war that is the real reason Qatar has such a vast military presence.  The context here is a regional map that reads like the end of the world reinterpreted through a bloodstained Jane Austen drama. Qatar and Iran are friends. Saudi Arabia hates Iran. The United Arab Emirates hates Iran. Qatar and Saudi are pretending, for now, not to hate each other. Everyone hates Israel, apart from the US, which likes Israel while trying to maintain relations with everyone else who doesn\u2019t. Saudi is on-off with the US but kind of likes Russia and China. China can like anyone who seems useful. Russia laughs darkly at the notion of liking things, while seeking relations with those who can serve its historic destiny to become the new Rome. In the middle of this, tiny, rich, vulnerable Qatar is out there on its peninsula staging history\u2019s greatest show and taking daily calls from world leaders as war in Europe has created power and peril around its vast gas wealth. Little wonder the World Cup vibe is a little odd, that even the soft arm of this thing has seemed strangely brutal, from buying Neymar for twice the record fee, blowing up the European transfer market to wave a flag in a moment of border tension; to creating the current toxic inanity around French football\u2019s puppet emperor Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, spoiled golden child of gas deals, media buyouts and \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace lunches. Western colonial powers used football like this in the 19th century, as a lure, a tool, a way of marshalling the locals. Perhaps, in an unlikely historical irony, there is an element of this process in reverse now. Either way, as Qatar 2022 looms closer it seems pretty clear that sportswashing has run its course. Count the drones, the radar systems, the jets. This is Hard Sports Power."

                    "body": "World Cup pedigree Wales\u2019 sole other finals appearance came in 1958, when Manchester United caretaker manager Jimmy Murphy led them to the quarter-finals of a 16-nation tournament with only four non-European teams. Wales advanced from a group also containing hosts Sweden, Hungary and Mexico, but without the injured Juventus star John Charles they lost to Brazil. Pele scored the only goal. Singled out for rough treatment by Hungary in the previous game, Charles\u2019 absence is one of the most famous \u201cwhat ifs\u201d in Welsh football. Past meetings  Only two, both friendlies. The first was a 2-0 win for the US in San Jose in 2003, with Landon Donovan and Preston North End\u2019s Eddie Lewis scoring second-half goals. \u201cUS Has No Problem With Wales,\u201d read the headline in the LA Times, making it sound like the White House was denying reports of a diplomatic incident. The countries met again in Swansea in November, 2020. The uneventful (dull) behind-closed doors game was a goalless draw but notable as two 17-year-olds, Gio Reyna and Yunus Musah, made their US debuts. They\u2019ve since proved to be a bit useful. Strengths A battle-hardened band of overachievers who are effective on the counter-attack, Wales have shown their mettle this year in tense playoff victories over Austria and Ukraine. Their games tend to be tight: since being crushed 4-0 by Denmark at Euro 2020 only one out of 16 fixtures (a 5-1 win over Belarus) hasn\u2019t been a draw or settled by a single-goal margin. Weaknesses Perennial fitness concerns over Aaron Ramsey and Gareth Bale and a serious lack of squad depth: less than half the roster play in leading European leagues. Chris Gunter is Wales\u2019 most-capped player in history, but the 33-year-old AFC Wimbledon defender plays his club football in the English fourth tier \u2013 as does Swindon Town\u2019s Jonny Williams. Star player You really need to ask? With due respect to MK Dons midfield dynamo Matt Smith, it\u2019s Bale, of course. Oft-injured and 33 years old, he\u2019s no longer a rampaging speedster, but the five-time Champions League winner is his country\u2019s talisman and can still seize the moment, as shown by his 128th-minute equalizer for LAFC in the MLS Cup final earlier this month. What the US need to do to beat them A limited but direct and well-drilled opponent that can hurt you with pace on the break? Sounds worryingly like Canada, who took four points off the US in qualifying. Gregg Berhalter\u2019s men will need to guard against the speed of forwards Dan James and Brennan Johnson, track Kieffer Moore\u2019s aerial threat and avoid giving away free kicks in dangerous areas, given Bale\u2019s set-piece prowess. Expect the US to have most of the possession \u2013 so the result will hinge on how well they use it. Score prediction 1-1: A nervous US get off to a bad start but grow into the game; their pressure leads to an equalizer but they can\u2019t quite find a winner. Berhalter \u201ctakes the positives\u201d."

Buying a minority stake in United is not currently of interest, it is understood. Uefa rules do not allow clubs that can meet in the same competition, such as the Champions League, to have the same owner. Those driving the Qatar interest are conscious of this and a solution is being sought. The current one would be to demonstrate to Uefa that United would not be administered by the same structure and personnel as PSG. There is some confidence that this would be accepted, particularly as there is a precedent in Red Bull Salzburg and RB Leipzig, where the ultimate proprietor is Red Bull GmbH. In September 2018 the Austrian and German clubs faced each other in the Europa League. Nasser al-Khelaifi, the PSG president and chairman of their owner, Qatar Sports Investments, is a powerful figure within Uefa. The 49-year-old is chairman of the European Club Association, which is the collective of 220 clubs, and has considerable leverage in driving policy within the governing body. When the proposed European Super League became public in April 2021, Khelaifi stood with Uefa by refusing to take PSG into the proposed competition."

                    "body": "The head of Qatar\u2019s World Cup organising committee has accused teams who wanted to wear the OneLove armband at the World Cup of sending a \u201cvery divisive message\u201d to the Islamic and Arab world. Hassan al-Thawadi\u2019s comments came as the UK sports minister Stuart Andrew said he would wear the rainbow-coloured armband at the England v Wales match on Tuesday. The Conservative frontbencher, who is gay, said it was \u201creally unfair\u201d that Fifa had threatened sporting sanctions at the 11th hour against seven European teams who had planned to wear the anti-discrimination symbol in Qatar, forcing them to protest in other ways. \u201cI want to show support and I was delighted to see that the German minister who attended a recent match has worn it, I think it is important that I do so,\u201d he added. However, Thawadi \u2013 secretary general of the supreme World Cup committee for delivery and legacy \u2013 said he had an \u201cissue\u201d with the armband because he saw it as a protest against Islamic values and an Islamic country hosting such a major event. \u201cIf the teams decided to do it throughout the entire season, that is one thing,\u201d he said, when asked if he felt nervous about armbands. \u201cBut if you\u2019re coming to make a point, or a statement in Qatar, that is something I have an issue with. And it goes back to the simple fact that this is a part of the world that has its own set of values. \u201cThis is not Qatar I\u2019m talking about, it\u2019s the Arab world,\u201d he added. \u201cFor the teams to come and preach or make statements, that\u2019s fine. But what you\u2019re essentially saying is you\u2019re protesting an Islamic country hosting an event. Where does that end? Does that mean no Islamic country can never be able to participate in anything? \u201cThere\u2019s going to be different values and different views coming in. So, for me, if you\u2019re going to come specifically to make a statement here in Qatar \u2013 or specifically addressed to Qatar and by extension, the Islamic world \u2013 it leaves a very divisive message.\u201d Same-sex relationships are illegal in Qatar and while organisers and Fifa have repeated the message that \u201ceveryone is welcome\u201d during the World Cup, it is unclear whether laws that criminalise acts such as kissing in public have been suspended. Fans attending matches have also had rainbow items, including T-shirts and Wales bucket hats, confiscated by officials, before Fifa later said they should be allowed in stadiums. But Thawadi said organisers only wanted visitors to respect the culture and religion of the region. \u201cThese values are regional,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s for the Islamic world, it\u2019s for the Arab world, it\u2019s for the Middle East. There are certain things that we will not agree upon. But let us find a way of coexisting and moving forward, one way or the other. That is where mutual respect is fundamental.\u201d In his interview with the TalkSport UK radio station, Thawadi also defended the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, for his pre-tournament remarks in which he said he felt Qatari, Arabic, African, gay and disabled, before warning western countries that they were in no position to give morality lessons to Qatar given their past and current behaviour. \u201cFor a lot of people in Qatar and the Arab world what he said to a large extent reflected the frustration of 13 years being presented in a certain way in the media,\u201d said Thawadi. \u201cA lot of Arabs that I\u2019ve talked to have admired what he said. It addressed the fact that people did feel that the outside world is coming and passing judgment unequivocally on our part of the world \u2013 on us as people, on the Arab world and the Middle East.\u201d"

                    "body": "In a dusty car park, near to one of the largest labour camps in Qatar, Worker A gets into my car. I will call him Worker A, not because I do not want to reveal his name, but because I do not know his name.  He only agrees to talk to me after I show him my name on the articles I have written and match it to my passport. I hand over my phone to prove I am not recording anything. The reason he is reluctant to talk, he tells me, is that his employer had recently used a \u201cspy\u201d to root out troublemaking employees. \u201cEveryone is afraid to speak out but we\u2019re dying inside,\u201d he says. He claims they work 12-hour shifts for six days a week, but do not receive the legal rate for overtime pay. In all, he says, they earn the equivalent of about \u00a3335 a month. \u201cOur manager has a [nice car] but on my salary I couldn\u2019t even afford to buy its four tyres. I\u2019m earning peanuts,\u201d says Worker A. In their labour camp, he alleges, six workers share a room, which is also illegal, and the food is so bad that he says \u201cdogs wouldn\u2019t eat it\u201d. He tells me about a co-worker, a young man who recently collapsed and died at his workplace, after saying he was feeling unwell but being ordered to work regardless. Another source sent me a photo of the deceased worker. When I first met her, I asked if I could add her number to my phone so we could keep in touch. She told me to wait because her boss might be watching. A few minutes later, she discreetly slipped me a note with her number on it. On a recent reporting trip I met up with another worker I had kept in touch with for years. Someone saw us talking and a few days later he was summoned by the police and interrogated. This is how we report on the buildup to the world\u2019s greatest football tournament: through secret meetings in car parks and messages that can be set to disappear within five minutes. Every sentence I write is carefully constructed so that I do not reveal anything that would put someone at risk.  What are these workers afraid of? Being sent home. Because for all the problems they face, the brutal truth is that they need the work \u2013 and they need to pay off the debts they took on to get the work. When the pandemic began, one worker told me everyone was terrified, but not of Covid. \u201cMost of us borrowed money to come here. If we were sent home, how could we repay our debts? We\u2019re afraid to return empty-handed,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they see you are trying to fight for your rights, they find any little excuse to send you home,\u201d said another. That fear even extends beyond Qatar\u2019s borders. This week I was filming interviews with Nepali workers who had been sent home from Qatar recently, as companies wrap up construction projects on the eve of the World Cup. They had been promised two years of work, but had barely been in Qatar for six months and were struggling to repay their debts. They agreed to talk, but at the end of each interview they said they feared being barred from getting another job in Qatar if they spoke out.  Every time workers tell me of the problems they have faced in Qatar, I ask: will you go back? And the answer is almost always \u201cyes\u201d, because they have so few other options. A day of manual labour in Nepal can earn as little as 400 rupees (\u00a32.75), and so even Qatar\u2019s paltry minimum wage, equivalent to about \u00a38 a day, appears attractive. Under Qatari employment law, foreign workers have the right to change jobs if their contract is terminated and legal procedures are in place if an employee does not receive their wages or allowances at the end of their contract. The Qatari government also said a fund to support workers, including by reimbursing unpaid wages or benefits, had paid out \u00a3152.5m by last month. Qatar \u2013 and all the other Gulf states \u2013 could tell a compelling story about how it has created opportunities and alleviated poverty for millions. And to an extent is has. But it is hard to avoid the conclusion that Qatar has also exploited that poverty, and the desperation of so many, to build the infrastructure for their nation and the World Cup. \u201cI pay school fees for three boys [back home]. They are my life,\u201d Worker A tells me. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here. If I go home now, my kids will starve.\u201d And so, for many like him, the only thing worse than being in Qatar is not being in Qatar.

                    "body": "Australia\u2019s professional footballers union and LGBTQ+ advocates have criticised Fifa for accepting sponsorship from the Saudi Arabian tourism authority for the Women\u2019s World Cup later this year, with one group saying the event is now being sponsored by a country where many players and fans would be persecuted for being themselves. Fifa is expected to confirm that Visit Saudi will join international brands such as Adidas, Coca-Cola and Visa in attaching its name to the 32-team tournament that will kick off in front of an expected 50,000 supporters at Auckland\u2019s Eden Park on 20 July. The deal has been agreed under Fifa\u2019s new \u201ccommercial partnership structure\u201d dedicated to developing revenues specifically for the women\u2019s game, with funds generated from the World Cup going back into the sport.  The arrangement has been condemned by human rights groups, which have called the move a \u201ctextbook case of sportswashing\u201d, and in a statement the New Zealand sport minister, Grant Robertson, said football bodies that are part of Fifa, including NZ Football, have written to Fifa to express their concern. Consensual same-sex sexual conduct is strictly prohibited in Saudi Arabia, punishable by death or flogging. Sexual relations outside marriage are banned, and it is illegal for men \u201cto behave like women\u201d or to wear women\u2019s clothes and vice versa. The Professional Footballers Australia co-chief executive Kathryn Gill also condemned the move, saying players were the \u201cpublic face\u201d of Fifa\u2019s major tournaments, but their voice had been excluded from a decision-making process that would benefit from their involvement.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  \u201cFifa is obliged to respect all internationally recognised human rights and to exert its considerable leverage when they are not being respected or protected. However, they have consistently shown that they lack the willingness to uphold their stated human rights commitments. \u201cThe players\u2019 objective is to make the 2023 Fifa Women\u2019s World Cup a genuine force for good, and they will continue to hold Fifa to account when they undermine this.\u201d Organisers of the A-League\u2019s Pride Cup, which is due to be held on 16 February between Melbourne Victory and Adelaide United, said in a statement the decision disregarded the \u201chuman rights of players, fans and officials\u201d. \u201cThe FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup is now being sponsored by a country where many players and fans would be persecuted and arrested for being themselves.\u201d Dr Ryan Storr, a research associate at the Sport Innovation Research Group at Swinburne University of Technology, said the deal was \u201ca bit of a mess\u201d, adding that the Saudi Arabian tourism body was not a \u201cgood fit\u201d for the tournament. \u201cSaudi Arabia actually has one of the world\u2019s worst legal systems around LGBT qualities and around homosexuality in particular,\u201d he said. Women Onside, an NGO focused on advocating for women in football, said it was \u201cconcerned\u201d by the deal, adding it highlighted Fifa\u2019s \u201cindifference\u201d to human rights records. \u201cWhile there has been progress for women\u2019s rights in Saudi Arabia in recent years, including the establishment of a women\u2019s national football team, Saudi Arabia remains an authoritarian state where rights for women and minority groups are constrained, same-sex relationships are illegal, freedom of expression is limited and dissidents are jailed. \u201cVisit Saudi is not an appropriate sponsor for the Women\u2019s World Cup.\u201d A number of legal changes have been introduced in recent years in Saudi Arabia, including ending the ban on women driving and making amendments to the oppressive guardianship law that would allow, for the first time, women to apply for official documents such as a passport and to travel abroad independently. However, women still have to obtain male guardian permission to get married, leave prison, or obtain some forms of sexual and reproductive healthcare. Male guardians can also bring legal action against women for \u201cdisobedience\u201d and being absent from home. Fifa has not replied to a request for comment."

                    "body": "And \u2026 clear. Stage one completed. With the announcement of Gareth Southgate\u2019s 26-man England World Cup squad safely despatched the early signs are, it has to be said, pretty good. Potential hazards appear to have been glossed or co-opted. The situation is calm. When it comes to negotiating the fraught pre-tournament void, a cursed earth of brain-shouts and rage-swirls and curdled hope, this is probably about as good as it gets.\nIt is one of the many roles of any modern England coach to manage also the expected rage of these occasions, to come on like an embattled community support officer policing some lawlessly enraged Friday night city centre, a place where we are at any point just one misstep from \u201ca situation\u201d, a pile-on.\n\nSouthgate\u2019s job with his selection for Qatar is of course to pick his most balanced group. The enlarged 26-man squad, plus a helpful nudge from form and injuries, have pretty much done the job for him in that regard. These are his best players. The popular favourites are all included, the absence of Reece James defusing a potential Trent-bomb. The poor form of those who have been tried and found wanting \u2013 Jadon Sancho most noticeably \u2013 means James Maddison becomes an obvious feelgood pick, but also a sensible one.\nAnd in this Southgate has lucked out to some degree. Facing down the external noises, curating the vibe, is an increasingly significant part of this process. The happy-ship energy, and a reconnection with the wider support was a key tonal point in that surprise run to the semi-finals in 2018.\nHe may just have done it again here. This is not to say that England have an obvious champion squad. But it is the best squad Southgate could have picked, one that on the face of it offers no space to carp or rage at talent squandered, favouritism applied.\nThere will be plenty of opportunities from here to introduce further notes of jeopardy, and indeed some actual in-game coaching to be done. But by picking this group with a keen eye to form, accrued loyalty and also promise in the case of Conor Gallagher and others, Southgate has effectively negotiated ground zero.\nThere will still be some bold attempts made to find fault. In the immediate fallout from the announcement there was a vague thrumming up through the gears for a where-is-Ivan-Toney bandwagon. One popular sport radio station, clearly disarmed in its planning by the inclusion of Maddison, switched expertly to the line that Southgate had only included him to head off the backlash. Positions are generally set on England\u2019s manager, and unshakeably so. One anti-Gareth poster on the Guardian website recently referred to him, damningly, as \u201ca woke dinosaur\u201d, a masterful, all-things-to-all-men checkmate that, if it can be said to actually exist, basically leaves him with nowhere to go.\nIn reality there is only one question worth asking about this squad. Are they actually any good on the wider stage? At which point the wind chimes tinkle, the screen dissolves and it becomes necessary to take a dive back into the recent past, and the real jumping-off point for this group of England players.\nIt is almost exactly 12 years to the day since the Football Association launched The Future Game, its much-fanfared regeneration project. Given the key FA heavy hitters at the launch of this paradigm-shift were Fabio Capello, Sam Allardyce and Stuart Pearce \u2013 the future of football, right there \u2013 it has been easy to let the whole thing blur into all the other failed new dawns.\nBut it is a point in time that speaks to this Southgate squad. The other significant note from that era was Greg Dyke\u2019s statement that England would set a target of winning the 2022 Qatar World Cup with this current crop of Future Game princelings, a prediction taken so literally that the FA installed an actual doomsday clock at St George\u2019s Park counting down to that distant golden future, or as we call it now, next Sunday.\nBoth the clock and that target were quietly removed by the next Greg in the building, Greg Clarke. But what followed was a roll call of commissions and reports and hopeful suggestions, from pre-Brexit quotas on overseas players to glossy manuals and top-down coaching buzzwords.\nAnd so here we are, at that promised threshold. Are Gareth\u2019s unarguable 26 really more technical, more tactically aware, more Iberian, more obviously champs-in-waiting, as the Future Game review promised?\nThe answer is probably yes; although this has more to do with the uplift in coaching standards in the Premier League. Very good but not quite elite is probably the fairest verdict. Thirteen of the 26 are current Champions League players. Only 12 have won a major trophy. None are genuine world stars. But it is still the strongest squad England have had since 2006.\nAnd this is significant for Southgate. Until now the uplift in England\u2019s fortunes can be traced to his management. Without any great change in personnel England not only stopped being terrible, but became as good, in tournament terms, as they have ever been. This, though, is something else. Six years in, Southgate has his best tournament squad, albeit with key parts \u2013 the Kane-Sterling axis \u2013 starting to show some wear.\nIt offers up an intriguing set of possibilities. One of the few contentious picks, Kalvin Phillips, is there because Southgate trusts him, and because he speaks directly to the weakness in the defensive heart of the team that has driven most tournament selections to this point. And the fact is, Declan Rice, Phillips and Jude Bellingham form the first really convincing midfield England have had under Southgate, an upgrade on the exact area those fine margin tournament games have tended to be lost.\nPerhaps with that three England may even play a back four and liberate other parts of the team.\n\nThere will be permutations before then, and an urge towards caution. But a first XI of Jordan Pickford in goal, Kieran Tripper, John Stones, Harry Maguire (who will play, and who is also more suited to the sedentary rhythms of England football) and Luke Shaw in defence; the Rice-Phillips-Bellingham trio, plus Southgate\u2019s favoured front three of Kane-Sterling-Foden \u2026 this looks pretty good.\nFor all the talk there are very few injury absences, just the first-choice wing-backs plus some rustiness in Kyle Walker and the spectre of a pre-exhausted Kane. Stage one completed. Over to you now Gareth."

Liverpool have won four of their 11 Premier League games, leaving them eighth at the start of the weekend\u2019s fixtures. They face a crucial run of games before the season goes on hiatus in three weeks, starting with the visit of Leeds on Saturday evening.  Asked if players are trying to protect themselves to avoid injury and missing out on Qatar, Klopp said: \u201cIt is a logical thing, it happens every year when the World Cup is usually in the summer and the big finals are in the summer as well, so if you are involved in the finals of the Champions League, FA Cup, whatever, European league final, there is no player who thinks about the World Cup [that is] a little bit later, they want to win their final. If the last match day decides qualifying for the Champions League or staying in the league, there is no player I know, have ever met, who thinks \u2018be careful\u2019 because the players I know, for sure, are 1,000% committed with us here.\u201d One hindrance for Liverpool this season has been injuries. They are, however, boosted by the return of Thiago Alc\u00e2ntara after the Spanish midfielder\u2019s recovery from an ear infection. But Jordan Henderson is a doubt for a game against a team who have not won in eight matches. Last week saw Klopp\u2019s side lose 1-0 to Nottingham Forest who are also in the bottom three and the manager is wary of suffering another shock defeat. \u201cLeeds are really going for it, super lively, super aggressive,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have real machines. There is a lot to like about this team but they have no result in the last six, seven games. \u201cYesterday when I passed the screen, I heard Jesse Marsch say he was sick of losing. We saw his half-time talk at Salzburg, so he is obviously pretty lively in the dressing room. He will set them on fire.\u201d Klopp will be on the touchline having avoided a ban after receiving a red card in Liverpool\u2019s 1-0 victory against Manchester City this month. The German did, however, receive a \u00a330,000 fine for confronting the assistant referee late on in a fiery encounter. \u201cI think it\u2019s a lot of money but I heard it will be invested for something good, and that\u2019s fine,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cShould I have got a ban? I don\u2019t know.\u201d"

                    "body": "Haji Wright, Joe Scally and Sean Johnson were among the 26 players selected for the United States\u2019 World Cup squad bound for Qatar while Zack Steffen, Paul Arriola and Ricardo Pepi failed to make the cut. USA coach Gregg Berhalter revealed his final squad on Wednesday afternoon at a special televised event at Brooklyn Steel, less than two weeks before his side\u2019s opener against Wales on 21 November at Al Rayyan\u2019s Ahmad bin Ali Stadium. All but one of the players chosen for the 26-man squad will aim to play in their first World Cup with DeAndre Yedlin the lone holdover from when the United States last qualified in 2014. Only four players remain from the USA side whose catastrophic defeat to Trinidad &amp; Tobago cost them a place at Russia 2018: Yedlin, Kellyn Acosta, Christian Pulisic and Tim Ream. The biggest surprise was the omission of Steffen, the 27-year-old Manchester City goalkeeper who had vied with Arsenal\u2019s Matt Turner for the starting spot throughout most of World Cup qualifying before joining Middlesbrough on loan in July to get more first-team minutes. Instead, Berhalter went with Turner, Johnson and Ethan Horvath. \u201cIn some of the cases it\u2019s more about what we have than what we don\u2019t have,\u201d Berhalter said on Wednesday. \u201cWith the three goalkeepers listed on the roster, we feel great, we feel really good about it. We saw a lot of progress with Matt Turner in this last six months, we know Ethan Horvath has been competing at a good level at Luton in the Championship, and Sean Johnson has been a mainstay in this group since day one.\u201d The other major swerve was the inclusion of Wright, the second leading scorer in the Turkish first division, in the place of Pepi, America\u2019s top striker prospect who became a favorite of Berhalter with three goals early in World Cup qualifying. \u201cIn the case of Ricardo, that was a really difficult conversation that I had to have with him,\u201d Berhalter said. \u201cIt\u2019s always difficult when a guy helps you get to the World Cup, he scores three goals in World Cup qualifying, and isn\u2019t going to be a part of the program. Again, it\u2019s more about who we did add that we felt good about.\u201d Berhalter can make changes up until Monday, the Fifa deadline for submitting the official list. After then, injured players can be replaced on the roster until 24 hours before the USA\u2019s opening match. Nine players on the 26-man squad are from Major League Soccer. Eight are based with English clubs, two apiece play in Germany, Italy and Spain, and one each hail from France, Scotland and Turkey. Berhalter, who said the entire team will be together by 14 November before traveling to Qatar, will become the first man to represent the USA at the World Cup as both a player and a coach after playing in both the 2002 and 2006 tournaments. Playing in their 11th overall World Cup and the eighth of the last nine, the United States have been drawn into the strongest group in Qatar by Fifa ranking. Berhalter\u2019s side play their first Group B match against Wales on 21 November, face off with England four days later and meet Iran on 29 November. USA Goalkeepers Ethan Horvath (Luton Town), Sean Johnson (New York City FC), Matt Turner (Arsenal) Defenders Cameron Carter-Vickers (Celtic), Sergino Dest (AC Milan), Aaron Long (New York Red Bulls), Shaq Moore (Nashville SC), Tim Ream (Fulham), Antonee Robinson (Fulham), Joe Scally (Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach), DeAndre Yedlin (Inter Miami), Walker Zimmerman (Nashville SC) Midfielders Brenden Aaronson (Leeds United), Kellyn Acosta (Los Angeles FC), Tyler Adams (Leeds United), Luca de ka Torre (Celta de Vigo), Weston McKennie (Juventus), Yunus Musah (Valencia), Cristian Roldan (Seattle Sounders) Forwards Jesus Ferreira (FC Dallas), Jordan Morris (Seattle Sounders), Christian Pulisic (Chelsea), Gio Reyna (Borussia Dortmund), Josh Sargent (Norwich City), Tim Weah (Lille), Haji Wright (Antalyaspor)"

                    "body": "\u201cWhen I want a peerage,\u201d sniffed Alfred Harmsworth (later Lord Northcliffe), \u201cI shall buy one like an honest man.\u201d So yes: I want to begin with an apology for a ridiculous statement in my most recent column, which held that David Beckham\u2019s mega-lucrative Qatar promotional deal meant he has been \u201cwearing the face of a man who knows he is never going to get his knighthood now\u201d. This was obviously wrong. Having been paid a reported \u00a3150m for his work shilling for the Qatari regime, David is in fact even better placed to buy a knighthood than he was before, and could easily run to a peerage.\nBut could David also be involved in the purchase of something else? Namely, Manchester United football club, which you\u2019ll have noted is back on the market after the adored Glazer family have finally decided to cash out of the club they bought with some debt back in 2005. Can you cash out of something you never put cash into? Amazingly, yes. High finance is magic, and I\u2019ve got a huge amount of time for it.\nAccording to the Financial Times, Beckham is \u201copen to holding talks with potential bidders for Manchester United\u201d, aware his backing \u201ccould lend credibility\u201d.\n\nCould it? Certainly, his unappealing antics over the past few weeks have catapulted him closer in the public affections to the reviled sports-owner category, though of course his personal wealth is nothing like what you\u2019d need to be meaningfully financially involved in a bid, with current estimates of United\u2019s worth ricocheting cheerily between just under \u00a35bn to upwards of \u00a37bn.\nBut Beckham\u2019s sense that he would make a worthy figurehead or heritage fan appeaser for someone else\u2019s bid is intriguing. On one level it\u2019s hard to know how much appeasing would even be necessary. There is no more elegant pivot in world sport than spending years moaning about the World Cup being in Qatar to begging a Gulf state to come and buy your club, and I feel sure we\u2019ll be seeing some stunning examples of this executed as the sale hots up.\nAs for who Beckham would lend his image to, that\u2019s the big question. Though he is not formally a spokesmodel for Just For Men Beard and Moustache dye, Beckham\u2019s alarmingly coloured beard now looks so odd he could almost be the continuity Glazer candidate, at least on the weird facial-hair front. (You\u2019ll remember the particular beard sported by the late paterfamilias Malcolm Glazer. In my taxonomy of beard types, I always think of that one as \u201cthe pervert special\u201d, though of course there is absolutely no suggestion that Malcolm\u2019s kinks were anything other than financial. Tonsorially, Glazer owed much to the Amish. And financially, he owed much to a number of funds and institutions.)\n\nAnyway: runners and riders for a bid for the club. Openly keen is the Ineos tycoon Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who is a lifelong United fan and already involved in sports ownership. Jim is Britain\u2019s richest man \u2013 lives in Monaco, obviously \u2013 but something about the cut of his jib makes me feel he\u2019d be the long prelude to your first sighting of a \u201cGLAZERS IN\u201d banner.\nThe Daily Star seems to think Apple is interested (no), while the Times mentions Amazon and Meta. The latter would suggest Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s money-pit cravings are somehow insufficiently satisfied by the metaverse on which he has already dropped more than the US spent on the entire Manhattan project. Next up are the obligatory pair of Americans, in the form of Stephen Pagliuca and Larry Tanenbaum, disappointed shortlisters to buy Chelsea. Then there\u2019s Jim O\u2019Neill and his Red Knights, and the Zara magnate Amancio Ortega. Arguably the one to watch is Dubai International Capital, which would mean cuddly Sheikh Makhtoum could swap notes with Beckham on their iron-filings beards, like a pair of those magnetic Wooly Willy toys.\nBut, banter-wise, you do have to think a certain other little Gulf state could come in with a late surprise, as soon as Qatar realise there\u2019s one bit of the UK they haven\u2019t already bought. After all, even considering just luxury London hotels, Beckham\u2019s friends in the Qatar regime own some or all of the Ritz, Claridge\u2019s, the Connaught, the Berkeley and the InterContinental Park Lane. So they enjoy internal competition, and PSG could serve as a cute little feeder club or something.\nThat would certainly make for the sort of flashy launch event to which Beckham could be drawn. When the Qataris opened the Shard, the party featured Boris Johnson, the prime minister of Qatar and Prince Andrew. So that\u2019s Boris Johnson, the prime minister of Qatar and Prince Andrew at the top of an extremely tall glass building. I know what you\u2019re thinking \u2013 and believe me, so am I \u2013 but it\u2019s impossible to print those things without someone writing some pained letter to the readers\u2019 editor about you, and I haven\u2019t got the time this weekend.\nSo let\u2019s conclude this section by noting that Prince Andrew abseiled down part of the Shard for charity, scoffing that there was \u201ca lot of psychobabble about this sort of thing\u201d. Cool as a cucumber; no sweat. Having completed his descent, Andrew said: \u201cAll my family, who have been very supportive, probably want to know I have landed safely.\u201d (But did they? Hopefully series whatever of The Crown will portray this incident as a failed assassination attempt by Prince Philip. Can\u2019t win \u2019em all.)\n\nWhichever way you slice it, then, there is everything to play for with our Golden Balls-for-hire. Let\u2019s hope our manscaped figurehead finds a ship to lash himself to in very short order, allowing him to once again set sail on lucrative tides.\nMarina Hyde\u2019s World Cup Week will appear each Friday during the tournament"

Those of a Costa Rica persuasion were delighted to see not only the winner but their nation\u2019s first shot on target of Qatar 2022 after Luis Fernando Su\u00e1rez\u2019s side drew a blank in their 7-0 drubbing by Spain.\nIt means Group E is wide open because Germany go into Sunday night\u2019s game against Spain as the only country with zero points and yet this result is a definite fillip for them because they face Costa Rica last.\nFor the goal Hidemasa Morita was Japan\u2019s first culprit, gifting the ball to Yeltsin Tejeda, who found Fuller \u2013 though Gonda was the second Samurai Blue man to blame because he was flatfooted. In a late flurry Japan appealed for a penalty for a Bryan Oviedo handball after Daichi Kamada\u2019s shot but to no avail.\n\nA content Su\u00e1rez said: \u201cWe are alive, this is the main thing. No one can say we are out yet \u2013 we can still dream. This is not about tactics, it\u2019s about passion; the more pressure we have the more we can prove ourselves. We were dead yesterday \u2013 now we are alive.\u201d\nHajime Moriyasu\u2019s side have to regroup after their seismic victory over Germany and the coach was asked whether his team could shock the World Cup a second time by beating Spain. \u201cWe are going for the win,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve beaten Germany but it doesn\u2019t mean we can win against Spain. Those countries are World Cup title holders, so we have a lot of respect for them. But we won a match against Germany. Spain will be tough but there is a good chance for us to win. So we will prepare and with confidence go to the next match.\n\u201cSpain will be a very intense game. We just need to increase the odds for Japan. That\u2019s how I decided the tactics [for today]. The result didn\u2019t work out but we tried and I believe this is what Japan needed.\u201d\n\nHis strategy was the same as against Germany \u2013 wait to hit Costa Rica with quick breaks. The problem was this was Costa Rica\u2019s tactic too and thus a static affair materialised after the falsest of false dawns when Morita and Yuki Soma claimed an early corner between them. The latter swung this in, Ayase Ueda missed the header and a shaky Costa Rica escaped.\nMore encouraging for Costa Rica was a burst from the 120-cap Joel Campbell that earned a free-kick, though Celso Borges\u2019s delivery was plucked from the air by Gonda, Japan\u2019s man of the match against Germany.\nJapan handed Costa Rica another fright when Ritsu Doan, whose equaliser against Germany earned him a start, flashed the ball across Keylor Navas\u2019s goal but no teammate was present.\nFrom here quality flatlined in a stodgy midfield standoff, illustrated by the 0-0 shots-on-target count at the interval, with neither team able to seize the initiative. When Francisco Calvo and Campbell did take aim these were flaccid efforts, so it fell into the \u201csmall mercies\u201d department that there was only a minute of time added by the referee, Michael Oliver, to the opening 45.\n\nFor the second half Moriyasu decided Yuto Nagatomo and Ueda had contributed enough, removing them for Hiroki Ito and Takuma Asano, the latter the scorer of the memorable winner which downed Germany.\nTwenty-seven seconds in and an actual shot was saved by Navas: Morita was the player who finally found the target and the memory was revived of how good Japan were after half-time against the four-times world champions.\nThe manner of a Campbell dribble, in which he engineered a path straight out of touch with scant pressure on him, suggested his nation might not be any better, though. The former Arsenal forward\u2019s next entry into the contest ledger was to balloon a 40-yard diagonal free-kick out and, when Wataru Endo was fouled, Soma did the same from the edge of the Costa Rican area.\nMoments later, at a near-identical spot, Calvo yanked down Junya Ito, just on as a substitute, and this time Kamada was wasteful, hammering the set piece right into the wall.\nNext came Fuller\u2019s decisive intervention. This, really, was no match to remember but the standings mean that each of the last two games will be live, which may allow for an exciting end."

The Al Bayt Stadium is expected to be 30C on Sunday \u2013 a little cooler than in recent days \u2013 but still expect to see the odd sight of huge grey machines pumping cool air into the arena while the match is under way.  4) A close opening matchQatar have been given the most favourable Group A opener they could hope for. Ecuador are ranked only six places above the hosts but haven\u2019t scored in their past three matches (all 0-0 draws). We could get a match which lifts the spirit of the underdog hosts, rather than crushing it. 5) Interest for Brighton fansMoises Caicedo is Ecuador\u2019s star player while the rampaging left-back Pervis Estupi\u00f1\u00e1n was a driving force in their qualification campaign. Both have been in fine form for Brighton this year and their performances could swing the balance of the opening game. The midfielder Jeremy Sarmiento completes a trio of Seagulls representing La Tri at this World Cup. 6) An official matchball with AI-powered technologyThe Al Rihla features a time-precise motion sensor to track every touch of the game at a rate of \u201c500 times per second\u201d, which is supposed to speed up VAR calls. Here\u2019s hoping. We\u2019re imagining the shop-bought replica won\u2019t be so smart, though. 7) A stadium like no otherThere can\u2019t be many 60,000-capacity football stadiums that look like tents. The Al Bayt Stadium, 40km north of Doha, is certainly eyecatching and its design is a tribute to the hospitality of Qatar\u2019s forefathers, who would welcome weary travellers into their tents. But let\u2019s not forget how it was built.  8) Akram AfifQatar\u2019s star player is a product of Doha\u2019s Aspire Academy and a genuine livewire talent. The left winger loves nothing more than to take on defenders and was voted the 2019 Asian Footballer of the Year. If the hosts comes to life expect Afif to be the spark. 9) Support for LGBTQ+ Qataris \u2026 on social mediaIt is unlikely we will see support for the nation\u2019s LGBTQ+ community in the Al Bayt Stadium but campaigns are under way online to highlight the plight of the hidden population of gay Qataris when the hosts play. Among them the Proud Maroons, led by Nas Mohamed, who says he is the first openly gay Qatari, and wants LGBTQ+ Qatar fans on social media to join the \u201cLGBTQ+ National Football Supporters\u2019 Group that Qatar never wanted\u201d and be loud and proud when the Maroons are in action. 10) \u2018Now is All\u2019Expect to see the official World Cup slogan getting a good show. Its message appears to be a call for critics to just stick to football and forget how this World Cup came to be. Not likely. Talking points Age is but a (squad) numberThe Netherlands begin their campaign on Monday against Senegal and their manager, Louis van Gaal, was characteristically quirky when asked how he assigned his squad numbers. \u201cIn general I discuss that with the players . Not now. I gave the players a number that fits their age,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s no joke. I never tell jokes at a press conference.\u201d It seems a smart way to avoid bruising an ego though Matthijs de Ligt, 23, wearing the No 3 shirt alongside Virgil van Dijk, 31, wearing No 4 suggests Van Gaal was playing fast and loose with his own rule. Germany\u2019s teenage sensationAt the age of just 17, Youssoufa Moukoko is carrying great expectations after being included in Hansi Flick\u2019s Germany squad. Asked which former strikers he hoped to emulate, Moukoko \u2013 born in 2004 \u2013 said he could only recall watching Miroslav Klose. \u201cI have seen videos from him. The others I was not even there,\u201d said the Dortmund forward, who turns 18 on Sunday. \u201cI am here because the coach believes I can help the team,\u201d Moukoko added. \u201cI will give it all and enjoy it.\u201d Reuters  Messi\u2019s shirt could be Cash magnetThe Slough-born Aston Villa defender Matty Cash is expected to make his World Cup bow for Poland against Mexico on Tuesday, with their final Group C game against Argentina. Cash\u2019s Villa teammate, Emi Mart\u00ednez, is likely to start for the group heavyweights and Cash is hoping the keeper can save him a souvenir. \u201cI asked him for Messi\u2019s shirt, if that\u2019s possible,\u201d Cash revealed. The full-back could always ask Messi himself at full-time, although perhaps he doesn\u2019t fancy getting close enough. Reuters Beyond the football \u201cToday I feel Qatari. Today I feel Arabic. Today I feel African. Today I feel gay. Today I feel disabled. Today I feel [like] a migrant worker. Of course I am not Qatari, I am not an Arab, I am not African, I am not gay, I am not disabled. But I feel like it, because I know what it means to be discriminated [against], to be bullied, as a foreigner in a foreign country. As a child I was bullied \u2013 because I had red hair and freckles, plus I was Italian, so imagine.\u201d The start of Gianni Infantino\u2019s press conference on Saturday is essential if deeply uncomfortable viewing, and it didn\u2019t get much better from the Fifa president in a bizarre 57-minute attack on critics of the World Cup. Sean Ingle has more.  At one stage, Infantino pleaded with assembled reporters to \u201clet people enjoy the World Cup\u201d. Judging by these pictures of a fan village, taken by the BBC reporter Rhia Chohan, he may be asking the wrong people. Castillo\u2019s passport problem The Ecuador player who has made most headlines in the buildup will not be in Qatar at all. Byron Castillo has been the subject of a legal battle over his true nationality, with Chile among the rival nations to claim the right-back is actually from Colombia. The claim was dismissed by the court of arbitration for sport, but Ecuador were handed a three-point penalty for 2026 qualifying because the documents used to obtain an Ecuadorian passport for Castillo contained false information. To avoid further controversy, Ecuador\u2019s football federation decided not to include Castillo in the World Cup squad \u2013 a decision criticised by their coach. \u201cByron should have been with us,\u201d Gustavo Alfaro has said. As first-choice right-back, Castillo has played a key role in a defence that has not conceded a goal in six friendlies. \u201cWe are hurt because we know it\u2019s unfair,\u201d the head coach said. \u201cWe did everything straight.\u201d Reuters  And finally \u2026 Qatar v Ecuador is not a fixture likely to tantalise neutrals, or take the spotlight away from the tournament\u2019s many controversies. Tournament organisers (and Infantino) might hope for a repeat of the two sides\u2019 most recent meeting. Qatar won that Doha friendly 4-3 in 2018, with Almoez Ali on target twice for the World Cup hosts."

                    "body": "On Monday, 11 men defied their leaders in a show of solidarity with protests which have been led by women, but have drawn support from across society. What began as a rejection of the compulsory hijab in Iran has become a collective expression of fury with the repressive regime. Not one member of the Iranian football team sang the national anthem when it was played before their World Cup match against England. Earlier, Ehsan Hajsafi, the Iranian captain, said bereaved families should know \u201cthat we are with them, we support them and we sympathise with them\u201d and that \u201cthe conditions in our country are not right and our people are not happy\u201d. The players risked not fines, not a booking, but retribution from a vindictive state. In doing so, they joined other courageous athletes and stars, as well as hundreds of thousands of ordinary men and women who have taken to the streets in 155 cities. Celebrity offers limited protection: on Sunday, two prominent actors, Hengameh Ghaziani and Katayoun Riahi, were arrested for their \u201cprovocative\u201d posts after removing their hijabs on social media. More than two months after Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish woman, died in custody, detained by morality police for supposedly \u201cinappropriate hijab\u201d, a spokesperson for the UN human rights chief, Volker T\u00fcrk, warned that this is a \u201ccritical\u201d moment. He noted that more than 300 people have been killed already, across 25 of the country\u2019s 31 provinces. A rights group says that at least 58 victims were children. Thousands have been arrested, and at least six sentenced to death in connection with the protests. Even as Monday\u2019s match took place, security forces were firing on protesters in the mainly Kurdish cities of Piranshahr and Javanrud, with a rights group reporting that seven died in the latter alone. Tehran\u2019s vindictive reaction extends beyond its borders, with armed police deployed outside the Iran International television studios in London after the channel said two of its journalists had been threatened. Yet the ruthless reaction has not, so far, silenced calls for change, but inflamed them, with protesters demanding: \u201cDeath to the child-killing regime.\u201d Last week, they set fire to the ancestral home of the Islamic republic\u2019s founder, Ayatollah Khomeini. Tehran blames foreign enemies for orchestrating the unrest, but its people know the truth. As the weeks pass, the protests are expanding in scope as well as geographically, with students striking, pupils walking out of schools, and supporters boycotting firms tied to the Revolutionary Guards. Yet while some businesses have closed in support of protesters, and some workers have reportedly gone on strike, there is not, as yet, any sign of the kind of widespread industrial action which helped to bring down the Shah in 1979 \u2013 partly, perhaps, because the government has hiked some wages and benefits. Nor are there any signs of splits at the top, which might respond to growing pressure from the grassroots. Though its usual playbook is failing, the merciless logic of the regime, as well as the vested interests of the powerful, mean it is likely to continue escalating its response. But the fundamental contradiction between the priorities and beliefs of the hardliners in charge of the country, and the younger people under their suffocating, corrupt and incompetent rule, becomes more visible and more pronounced with every arrest, every beating and every death."

                    "body": "Josh Cavallo, the Australian footballer who came out as gay last year, has criticised Fifa\u2019s decision to penalise players at the World Cup who show support for the LGBTQ+ community, saying the move shows that football remains far from an inclusive space. Captains from seven European teams intended to wear the \u201cOneLove\u201d rainbow armband at the tournament in Qatar, but ditched the plan before the first round of group matches amid fears they would receive an immediate booking for the show of solidarity.  The England captain, Harry Kane, said the decision had been taken out of his hands and was instead forced to wear Fifa\u2019s \u201canti-discrimination\u201d armband in his team\u2019s opening win over Iran. In a scathing social media post addressing Fifa, Cavallo said the lack of support for the inclusivity push meant he had lost all respect for the game\u2019s world governing body. \u201cI love my identity,\u201d the Adelaide United player wrote. \u201cSeeing you have banned all teams to wear the One Love armband to actively support LGBTQ+ at the World Cup. You have lost my respect. \u201cAll the work my fellow allies and the LGBTQ+ community are doing to make football inclusive, you have shown that football isn\u2019t a place for everyone.\u201d Kane would have been joined by the Netherlands captain, Virgil van Dijk, and the Wales skipper, Gareth Bale, in wearing the OneLove armbands on Monday, with Belgium, Switzerland, Germany and Denmark expected to follow suit in their openers. But in a joint statement following Fifa\u2019s edict \u2013 which was described by the German federation president, Bernd Neuendorf, as an \u201coutrageous demonstration of power from Fifa\u201d \u2013 the seven national federations confirmed they would not wear the rainbow armbands. \u201cAs national federations we can\u2019t put our players in a position where they could face sporting sanctions, including bookings,\u201d the statement said. The Australian captain, Mat Ryan, who appeared in a video with Socceroos teammates before the tournament to raise concerns over human rights issues including the treatment of LGBTQ+ people in Qatar, said he had been told if he wore a rainbow armband, he would receive a yellow card.  Ryan said the joint statement released with his teammates a month ago had been an attempt to try to \u201cinfluence positive change in the world\u201d. Asked about Fifa\u2019s latest directions on armbands, Ryan said: \u201cI have got no comment. We made our statement with our players union. That\u2019s all we can control.\u201d Cavallo became the only known male top-flight professional footballer in the world to come out as gay in October last year, prompting an outpouring of support from across the globe. He has since been outspoken on gay rights issues and advocated for inclusivity in football. \u201cIt\u2019s not the first time we\u2019ve heard \u2018stick to football,\u2019\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe attacks on the LGBTQ+ community from World Cup leaders affects so many who live in silence because of your draconian ways. To be a great leader in sport, one must never give up trying to bring all people together.\u201d"

                    "body": "This article is part of the Guardian\u2019s World Cup 2022 Experts\u2019 Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 32 countries who qualified. theguardian.com is running previews from two countries each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 20 November.\nThe plan\nTwenty-six monoliths were installed across historic sites across Wales, from Cardiff Castle to Caerleon Roman Baths, to represent each player in the squad at last year\u2019s European Championship and depending on how things go at a first World Cup since 1958 the conversation could soon turn to statues. For Gareth Bale, a five-time Champions League winner, wearing the dragon on his chest and the captain\u2019s armband around his bicep at a World Cup marks the final box to tick on his footballing bucket list.\nAfter navigating nerve-shredding playoffs against Austria and Ukraine earlier this year, Wales could be forgiven for wanting to enjoy the experience. They have qualified for three of the past four major tournaments, single-handedly sparking the renaissance of the bucket hat now synonymous with the team in the process, and while expectations have undoubtedly increased they head to Qatar unfazed and unburdened. They gave Belgium and Netherlands a fright in recent Nations League encounters with their fearless approach and will quietly fancy their chances of getting out of Group B, which concludes with the small matter of a mouthwatering tie against neighbours England.\n\nWales are set to line up with a three-man defence, allowing rampant wing-backs Connor Roberts and Neco Williams to flood forward and Bale to operate from his favoured right flank. Bale insists he will arrive from stateside in peak fitness despite only playing more than 60 minutes twice since joining Los Angeles FC in the summer. Another major concern is the fitness of Joe Allen, who has been absent since September with a hamstring problem.\nThe vibrancy of this Wales squad, much of which stems from the Nottingham Forest pair Williams and Brennan Johnson, is a cause for optimism but their strength is in the collective, hence Rob Page\u2019s willingness to select players from the fourth tier such as Chris Gunter and Jonny Williams, both of whom were influential during the incredible run to the Euro 2016 semi-finals.\nRegardless of what happens this winter, Page has said his valuable core of 30-somethings \u2013 from Bale to Aaron Ramsey and Wayne Hennessey \u2013 have promised him they won\u2019t all step away from their country in one swoop. \u201cWe want Gareth to stay involved as long as he can,\u201d Page said. \u201cYou can\u2019t go from them having a big influence to a big chunk of them leaving.\u201d\n\nThe coach\nAnother World Cup \u2013 OK, a first in 64 years \u2013 and another coach that hails from the Rhondda valley. Rob Page is immensely proud of his roots in Tylorstown, a former mining village less than four miles from Pentre, the birthplace of Jimmy Murphy, who led Wales to the quarter-finals in 1958. \u201cWe were out playing kick-a-can, making games up on the street and then your mother would call you in at nine o\u2019clock for your supper,\u201d the former Watford captain recalled of his childhood. A former Port Vale and Northampton manager, Page worked with players such as Joe Rodon and Daniel James during his two years in charge of the under-21s before being promoted to Ryan Giggs\u2019s assistant in 2019. Led Wales at Euro 2020 following Giggs\u2019s arrest and signed a four-year contract after Giggs\u2019s resignation in June. Hugely respected by players and staff, Page has proved an inspirational leader.\nStar player\nWho else? As the Red Wall sings, Viva Gareth Bale. The country\u2019s all-time record goalscorer and captain is the darling of Welsh football and while they are not the one-man team often painted, Bale\u2019s influence runs deep. He was seemingly keeping his powder dry for a vintage display in victory over Austria in March, a majestic free-kick paving the way to victory, before making the difference against Ukraine in June. The big question is: could this be the last time Bale pulls on a Wales shirt? Qatar is considered the forward\u2019s footballing swansong, even if he has said he could play on until Euro 2024. \u201cI still have many years to come,\u201d the 33-year-old said after joining Los Angeles FC in July. His tendency to rise to the occasion was typified by him scoring a stoppage-time equaliser deep into extra time before LAFC beat Philadelphia Union on penalties to win the MLS Cup on 5 November. \u201cIt\u2019s always nice to score in finals, I seem to have a knack for doing that,\u201d Bale said. Was immortalised in a Cardiff mural after Wales qualified for Euro 2016.\n\nUnsung hero\nBen Davies\u2019s goal-line clearance to deny Marek Hamsik three minutes into Wales\u2019s opening game at Euro 2016 set the tone for a memorable ride to the last four of that competition but the Tottenham Hotspur defender seems to keep outdoing himself. Unafraid to put his head on the line for club or country, he delivered another heroic performance in Wales\u2019s crucial playoff final victory over Ukraine, making a box set of crucial blocks and interventions.\nProbable lineup\n\nQatar stance\nBale will be one of eight captains to wear a rainbow-coloured \u201cOneLove\u201d armband as part of an anti-discrimination initiative, though he may have to source a new one after the Football Association of Wales admitted to losing the armband in Belgium in September after Bale appeared without it against Poland four days later. Noel Mooney, the FAW\u2019s chief executive, has said they would happily take a fine on the chin for showing their support to the LGBTQ+ community if Fifa does not approve of the messaging. \u201cWe will live our values over there,\u201d Mooney said. Page held a meeting with his players on the eve of their last camp to address the importance of respecting the culture. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to unintentionally upset anyone,\u201d he said.\nNational anthem\nHearing Wales belt out Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau is one of the game\u2019s great sights and sounds. Players are versed on its meaning from a young age; in 2011 Gary Speed gave his squad both the Welsh and phonetic versions in pursuit of perfection. Written and composed by father and son Evan and James James in 1856, a statue in Ynysangharad Park in Pontypridd honours the pair. In 1977 the English FA refused to play the anthem at Wembley, leading the then Wales captain, Terry Yorath, and his teammates to link arms and sing it themselves as England\u2019s players readied for kick-off. Wales won the game 1-0.\nAll-time cult hero\nIt is difficult to look past Hal Robson-Kanu, the Acton-born former England youth forward who went to Euro 2016 a free agent and returned with a place in Welsh legend. His pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance will for ever be that giddying Cruyff turn and finish that stunned Belgium\u2019s Thomas Meunier and Marouane Fellaini in Lille to send Wales to the semi-finals. Described by Ryan Giggs as \u201can icon in Welsh football\u201d, these days Robson-Kanu, who at 33 is yet to officially retire, runs a nutrition company that sells shots of turmeric, a root from the ginger family, which he used after recovering from knee surgery as a teenager. Fans still sing his name to the tune of Salt-N-Pepa\u2019s Push It.\nBen Fishes writes for the Guardian. Follow him here on Twitter."

At the 2014 and 2018 World Cups they came up against some of the great football powerhouses but lost 1-0 to Argentina in Brazil and 1-0 to Spain in Russia, where they also drew 1-1 with Portugal. The performance against Lionel Messi\u2019s Argentina impressed Iranians back home so much there were celebrations in the streets after the narrow defeat.\nThe big downside of Queiroz\u2019s tactics was that Iran struggled to score goals against so-called weaker opposition. They were not able to dominate games and when they did throw players forward the defence was vulnerable; in Queiroz\u2019s last game of his first spell Iran conceded a sloppy goal against Japan in the semi-final of the 2019 Asian Cup and when they then pressed for an equaliser, they let in a further two goals.\n\nQueiroz, of course, has not changed completely. The onus is still on a solid defence but the two games in September \u2013 a 1-0 win against against Uruguay and 1-1 draw with Senegal \u2013 showed Iran are trying to play more from the back and press the opponent higher up the pitch.\nThey are likely to play in a 4-1-4-1 formation at the World Cup and the main question concerns who plays up front. Sardar Azmoun would be the favourite but he has been injured. If he is not fit, Mehdi Taremi is likely to step in. If Azmoun can play, Taremi is likely to start as a left winger.\n\nThe coach\nCarlos Queiroz. Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s former right-hand man is so popular among Iranian football fans that they did not have any issue with him replacing Dragan Skocic, who won 15 out of his 18 games in charge and got the country to the World Cup in record time before he was sacked earlier this year. Not even the farcical circumstances in which Queiroz returned dampened the mood. This is the third time Queiroz will lead Iran at a World Cup but this time it was Iran who got him there rather than the other way around. In fact he had failed to reach Qatar with Colombia and Egypt. If things go well he may well extend his short-term contract and stay on for next summer\u2019s Asian Cup, which is also in Qatar.\nStar player\n\u201cI regret that this boy did not go to European football much earlier. It\u2019s all my fault,\u201d Mehdi Taremi\u2019s father cried on a TV show a few months ago and his thoughts echoed those of pretty much everyone in Iran. After years of scoring in Iran and Qatar he finally made the move to Portugal in 2019, joining Rio Ave before a transfer to Porto a year later. He averages about a goal every other game in Europe, and for Iran. Taremi, 30, has come a long way since a last-minute miss for his country against Portugal at the 2018 World Cup. He appears to be getting better and takes comfort from the fact that all recent Ballon d\u2019Or winners have been 30 years or older.\n\nUnsung hero\nWhen Saeed Ezatolahi moved to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s B side as a 17-year-old in 2014 everyone expected him to have a brilliant club career ahead of him. It may not have turned out quite like that \u2013 he is now with Vejle in Denmark having spent a considerable amount of time in Russia \u2013 but it is a different story with Team Melli. He is a certain starter for Iran, his work rate appreciated by everyone. His absence was keenly felt in Iran\u2019s first game at Russia 2018 and Queiroz will hope he won\u2019t have the same headache this time.\nProbable lineup\n\nQatar stance\nIran has had tense relationships with several Arab countries in recent years but Qatar has been a rare ally and the impact they have had on the football world is serving as a role model for Iranians. There is nothing but praise for Qatar among Iranian football figures and there are many who think the migrant worker situation is not as bad as western media paints it. Iranian fans may well have banners protesting over something in Qatar, but it won\u2019t be about the workers.\nNational anthem\nIran\u2019s current national anthem, Sorude Melliye Jomhuriye Eslamiye Iran, is the second it has had after the Islamic revolution in 1979. The first was too long so in 1990 the government decided to replace it with a shorter one. The famous poet and songwriter Sayed Bagheri wrote the lyrics and Hassan Riahi composed the music, although some accused him of copying South Korea\u2019s national anthem (to be fair they have quite a bit in common). The lyrics refer to the Islamic revolution and in the final line express the hope that the Islamic republic of Iran will survive for ever. This is something fans may protest against and try to challenge in Qatar.\nAll-time cult hero\nWho else but the man who was the top scorer in the world at international level until Cristiano Ronaldo broke his 109-goal-record last year? Nearly two decades after his last appearance for Team Melli, Ali Daei (his nickname Shahriar means \u201cThe King\u201d in farsi) is still the poster boy of Iranian football. He was one of eight Fifa legends taking part in the draw for the Qatar World Cup but has been banned from coaching for three years after an outburst against a club president. Has been supportive of the recent protests in the country and had his passport seized by the authorities for a week.\nBehnam Jafarzadeh is the deputy editor of varzesh3.com.

                    "body": "It was a consecration, the spiritual overtones entirely appropriate. Lionel Messi not only emulated the deity of Argentinian football, Diego Maradona, by leading the nation to World Cup glory; he finally plugged the burning gap on his CV, winning the one title that has eluded him \u2013 at the fifth time of asking, surely the last time. In the process he gilded his claim to being recognised as the greatest player of them all.\nArgentina had to win this final three times, France refusing to accept it was Messi\u2019s destiny to get his hands on the iconic gold trophy, that it was somehow preordained. It will go down as surely the finest World Cup final of all time, the most pulsating, one of the greatest games in history because of how Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 hauled France up off the canvas towards the end of normal time.\nIt had been billed as Messi v Mbappe, the Argentinian hero opening the scoring from the penalty spot and having a hand in \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda\u2019s goal for 2-0. But then came Mbapp\u00e9, shattering the notion that Argentina would close out the win with the minimum of fuss. This Argentina team do not really operate like that. They love to trade in late drama. Think of their wins over Australia and the Netherlands in the knockout rounds.\n\nA part of the story was France\u2019s champion courage, the 2018 winners being revived by a clutch of Didier Deschamps substitutions. That and Mbapp\u00e9, who was unplayable from the 80th minute. He scored twice in 97 seconds to force extra-time; the first a penalty, the second a sublime side-on volley and there was a point towards the end of regulation time when he appeared hell-bent on making sure that the additional period would not be needed.\nBack came Argentina in extra-time, Messi scoring his second for 3-2. But back came France, Mbapp\u00e9 equalising with a second penalty on 118 minutes for his hat-trick and the Golden Boot. He finished the tournament with eight \u2013 one more than Messi. He joined Sir Geoff Hurst as a hat-trick scorer in the men\u2019s final.\n\nAt this point it is worth delving into the mayhem that gripped at the very end of extra-time.\nNeither team were ready to accept that a penalty shootout was inevitable. Not a bit of it. Randal Kolo Muani, on as a substitute for the game of his life, could not stretch to head home a cross byMbapp\u00e9 and will have nightmares about the one-on-one that he failed to convert, the Argentina goalkeeper, Emiliano Mart\u00ednez, coming out on top.\nAt the other end the Argentina substitute Lautaro Mart\u00ednez blew a gilt-edged header and then Mbapp\u00e9 beat two men on yet another explosive burst but not a third. Never has so much been crammed into an extra-time finale.\nSo to penalties and, after Mbapp\u00e9 and Messi had scored, it was over to Emiliano Mart\u00ednez and some of his dark arts to make the difference. After he had saved from the substitute Kingsley Coman, Mart\u00ednez threw the ball away before the next France kick, forcing the 22-year-old Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni to go and fetch it, further heightening his anxiety. Tchouam\u00e9ni dragged his kick past the post.\n\nMart\u00ednez had to be physically restrained by the referee, Szymon Marciniak, from confronting France\u2019s next taker, Kolo Muani. Mart\u00ednez was booked; Kolo Muani lashed home. But the scene was set for the substitute Gonzalo Montiel to win it \u2013 to crown Messi and Argentina.\nWhen Montiel scored, Messi sank to his knees in the centre circle, engulfed by teammates. Argentina\u2019s third World Cup will go down as Messi\u2019s World Cup, just as the second in 1986 had belonged to Maradona. Both men came to transcend their teams and the tournaments, with Messi collecting the Golden Ball here as the competition\u2019s star player. It has long felt as if he has had a celestial scriptwriter at work, guiding him to his destiny. The image of him and the trophy was what so many fans \u2013 and not just those from Argentina \u2013 had craved.\nThe start of the game came to feel like an awfully long time ago. It was when Messi located his passing rhythms straight away and Di Mar\u00eda dazzled. Di Mar\u00eda won the opening penalty, exploding away from Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 before being caught and Messi did the rest.\n\nThe first half was all Argentina, a scintillating period for them, Messi seemingly playing his own game. He fizzed or curled his passes, wowed with his changes of direction. He even threw himself into challenges.\nDi Mar\u00eda had lifted high early on and it said everything about France\u2019s struggles that Deschamps made a double substitution in the 41st minute. He moved Mbapp\u00e9 from the left into the centre and Olivier Giroud was the furious fall guy. Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 was also withdrawn. On came Kolo Muani and Marcus Thuram. By then it was 2-0. Messi fired a flowing move with a flick to Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez, who immediately got Alexis Mac Allister running. Di Mar\u00eda took off, too, on the other side and Mac Allister\u2019s low crossfield ball was made to measure. Di Mar\u00eda was overcome after his emphatic finish.\n\nFrance had been a grisly second best in the first half of normal time and, although they dug out footholds in the second half, they struggled to create. Argentina \u2013 with Di Mar\u00eda outstanding until his withdrawal \u2013 continued to look the more dangerous.\nThen everything changed. Deschamps\u2019 substitutions were acts of alchemy. He introduced Coman for the disappointing Antoine Griezmann and went to 4-4-2, Kolo Muani moving up alongside Mbappe.\nIt was Kolo Muani who won France\u2019s first penalty from Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi and suddenly Argentina were overtaken by nerves. The equaliser for 2-2 followed Coman robbing Messi and Mbapp\u00e9 finessing a give-and-go with Thuram before finishing spectacularly. The France substitutes streamed across the pitch towards Mbapp\u00e9 and France went close to a winner in regulation time, with Mbapp\u00e9 now rampant. At the other end, though, they needed Hugo Lloris to tip over a Messi blast to force extra-time.\n\nArgentina shook their heads clear in extra-time. Lautaro Mart\u00ednez made a difference. Twice he was denied by last-ditch Dayot Upamecano interventions and, when he unloaded for goal and Lloris could only parry, there was Messi to get the ball over the line.\nThere would be further twists, including Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s second penalty for a Montiel handball before Messi and Argentina could celebrate."

                    "body": "Residents of Qatar face the risk of persecution if they stand up for gay rights during the World Cup, Human Rights Watch (HRW) has warned.\nRaising the rainbow flag, engaging in chants or even liking pro-LGBTQ+ content on social media may leave a trail of evidence that could be used to persecute individuals once the World Cup has ended, according to Rasha Younes of HRW\u2019s LGBT rights program.\n\nShe said: \u201cAs Qatar advances its surveillance capabilities including inside football stadiums, the possibility of LGBT Qataris being persecuted for publicly supporting LGBT rights will remain long after the fans have gone. If an individual were even to retweet a post about affirmative LGBT rights this individual could be targeted long after the World Cup is over and in ways that we may not have access to.\u201d\nConcerns have long been raised over the safety of LGBTQ+ visitors to Qatar during the World Cup. This week the campaigner Peter Tatchell claimed he had been arrested in the country for protesting for LGBTQ+ freedoms.\nThere have also been mixed messages from the UK government over how fans should approach any visit to the country for the tournament, with the foreign secretary, James Cleverly, suggesting on Wednesday that they should modify their behaviour, with \u201ca little bit of flex and compromise\u201d. On Thursday, the Conservative party chair, Nadhim Zahawi, appeared to contradict Cleverly, saying: \u201cThe policies of the government of Qatar are not our policies, nor would we condone them.\u201d\n\nResidents have long faced discrimination from the state. Homosexuality is illegal in Qatar, with punishments of up to seven years in jail possible. This week HRW published a report which documented what it claimed was \u201carbitrary\u201d police action against LGBTQ+ residents, including six cases of severe and repeated beatings and five cases of sexual harassment in police custody between 2019 and 2022.\nA Qatari official said HRW\u2019s allegations \u201ccontain information that is categorically and unequivocally false\u201d, without specifying.\nYounes said that those within football should listen to concerns from LGBTQ+ supporter groups but that the risk faced by locals was greater. \u201cLGBT residents of Qatar are the people we are most concerned about,\u201d she said. \u201cThere needs to be an honouring of expression during the World Cup. But we also know that in any potential crackdown against individuals beyond the World Cup the people who are the most affected are going to be the LGBT residents of Qatar.\n\u201cThis needs to be factored into any policies, any concrete interventions that Fifa undertakes, or the Supreme Committee [the body in charge of organising the World Cup] or any coalitions, in terms of affording protections for the LGBT residents of Qatar who may face any grievances.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Committee said: \u201cThe Fifa World Cup will be a tournament for everyone \u2013 much like previous editions of the tournament.\n\u201cEveryone will be welcome to Qatar in 2022, regardless of their race, background, religion, gender, sexual orientation or nationality.\n\u201cWe are a relatively conservative society \u2013 for example, public displays of affection are not a part of our culture. We believe in mutual respect and so whilst everyone is welcome, what we expect in return is for everyone to respect our culture and traditions.\u201d"

                    "body": "In America, the French actor Isabelle Huppert once said, Europe disappears: \u201cThey have everything. They don\u2019t need anything. Deep down to them we are a sort of elegant Third World.\u201d The history of American sport reads as one iteration of this blazing autonomy: from the development of baseball as a derivative of regional English games like stoolball and tut-ball to the evolution of rugby union into American football and the creation of basketball from the manipulation of a soccer ball indoors, the US has specialized in fashioning its own kind of sporting modernity out of Europe\u2019s raw cultural materials, often consigning these older sports to the scrapheap of national memory. But globalization \u2013 the great success story of American free-market economics \u2013 and the unstoppable rise of football have, in recent decades, forced the US to confront a discomfiting reality: in the world\u2019s most popular sport, the global hegemon remains a middleweight at best. The country that has everything now finds that it doesn\u2019t: emerging (almost) every four years from a middling confederation into the glare of the World Cup, the spotlight deflected for once towards other countries, the America that wants for nothing \u2013 so confident, so culturally self-reliant \u2013 now finds itself in need. It needs to prove that it has footballing muscle equal to its muscle in every other domain. It needs to show that it belongs. And it needs, perhaps more than anything, to convince the world that it can produce a player in the men\u2019s game equal to Haaland, Neymar, Salah, or Mbapp\u00e9. For the past five years, American hopes of producing a world-class player have largely focused on one man: Christian Pulisic. To be sure, many fine footballers have emerged from these shores in recent times: Clint Dempsey is a folk hero at Fulham, Landon Donovan \u2013 though he struggled to build a club career in Europe \u2013 was never better than when appearing in national colors. And the stocks of the country\u2019s shot stoppers \u2013 including such fixtures of recent English Premier League history as Brad Friedel and Tim Howard, a player who was once as resolute in goal as he now is impenetrably wooden as a pundit on NBC \u2013 have historically been particularly rich.  But outside the women\u2019s game, where America is now an unfailing conveyor belt of top-class talent, the US has yet to produce a player with that insistent specialness \u2013 that fizzing mixture of skill, strength, personality, and will to win \u2013 capable of transcending national boundaries. Even players of a caliber one rung below the very top continue to elude the US, which is a genuine curiosity when you consider the country\u2019s size and financial means and the domestic popularity of football as a participation sport. Australia, a temperamentally similar country with a far smaller population and not one but three rival football codes to siphon talent away from soccer, has arguably produced three top-class players during the Premier League era: Tim Cahill, Mark Viduka, and Harry Kewell. America is yet to produce one. In this context, the expectations that have been placed on Pulisic are immense. A sense of all-American destiny has beckoned him seemingly from birth. Born in the town of Hershey, Pennsylvania \u2013 home of the famed Hershey Company, the biggest chocolate manufacturer in a country that runs on sugar \u2013 Pulisic grew up in a football-mad family (his parents both played college soccer and his father later became a professional indoor player) and made rapid early progress through the national ranks. One performance against Brazil in 2013 for the US under-17 team shows just how good he was as a teenager \u2013 pulling the strings from out wide, arrowing into space, timing his runs, burying his chances. All the speed, courage and control of his mature game were already there at the age of 15, with none of the self-doubt that has encroached in more recent years. The story from there is well known: the move to Borussia Dortmund, the first-team debut at 17, the string of impressive performances and the transfer rumors, the image of him slumped on the turf, head in hands, after the loss against Trinidad &amp; Tobago that denied the USMNT a place at the 2018 World Cup. The passion, the skill, and the commitment were all there, and soon afterwards the money on the table matched the scale of Pulisic\u2019s ambition, now nicknamed \u201cCaptain America\u201d (a moniker he reportedly detests) for his inspirational performances with the national team. At Chelsea, however, the narrative of Pulisic\u2019s career has begun to take a more complicated turn. Injuries and managerial changes have starved Pulisic of starting opportunities, and when he has been given a chance to strut his stuff he\u2019s often appeared hesitant and unsure of himself, qualities fatal to the game of a player who relies for so much of his efficiency on directness and courage. Pulisic is now in his fourth season in England and has never succeeded in nailing down a permanent place in Chelsea\u2019s starting XI; given the number of managers who have declined to place their unconditional faith in him it seems fair to wonder whether he\u2019ll ever make it to the very top of the sport as he has seemed destined to for so long. Among Chelsea fans his name is now a byword for missed chances and wasted potential, a bleak departure from the arc of his early career. On those rare and increasingly distant occasions when he has put it all together \u2013 such as during Project Restart, the peak of his Chelsea career to date \u2013 the results have been exhilarating. The hat-trick against Burnley in late 2019 \u2013 the first goal scored with his left foot, the second with his right, the third with his head \u2013 showed the very best of Pulisic: the casual two-footedness, the feathery first touch, the willingness to take his man on, that surgical turn of pace. In open space he\u2019s a dolphin breaking through the waves; cornered he\u2019s a spider scampering free. Above all he is one of the sport\u2019s great lateral movers, trampolining across the pitch with the refined hyperactivity of an orchestra timpanist commanding the kettles. The sheer versatility of Pulisic at his peak is something that only half-cooked metaphors can capture. The beauty of Pulisic\u2019s play on the pitch is all the more remarkable when you consider his blandness off it. Guarded, risk-averse, perhaps even slightly square: Pulisic has none of the braggadocio of Cristiano Ronaldo, none of the laddish immensity of Erling Haaland or slick eloquence of Kylian Mbapp\u00e9. In speech and manner he seems less like a footballer than a wealth management professional from a mid-sized regional city with some investment opportunities in municipal bonds and tech stocks he\u2019d like to discuss. And yet. Despite all of this \u2013 the weight of national expectation, his stop-start progress in the Premier League and Lampardesque lack of charisma \u2013 Pulisic is liberated when he steps onto the field for the USMNT. All the doubts that consume his game at club level melt away and he is reborn as America\u2019s star, the player through which all good things flow. Gregg Berhalter\u2019s system \u2013 built on an inexhaustible press, quick transitions, attack at all costs, and speed out wide \u2013 is designed to get the very best out of his No 10, and there\u2019s reason for American fans to feel real excitement at the prospect of seeing Pulisic, at his first World Cup, set free in a team where he\u2019s the unquestioned talisman. Given the relentlessness of European club football today \u2013 its booming popularity, the money it attracts, the sheer scale of its playing calendar \u2013 there\u2019s little doubt that in our era, truly great players need first to be great for their clubs. Though football is no stranger to late bloomers \u2013 look at the careers of Jamie Vardy, Olivier Giroud, or Didier Drogba \u2013 and playing careers are unquestionably growing longer, Pulisic has been hyped since adolescence, which carries its own kind of psychological burden, and at 24, time may be running out for him to give full expression to his talent at club level. But for the next few weeks, the question of whether Pulisic can vindicate his country\u2019s footballing potential and become truly \u201cworld class\u201d does not really matter. The boy from the chocolate town needs only to be very good, and America will remember Qatar sweetly."

The Uruguayan is one of 73 Premier League players no longer involved in the World Cup, leaving 61 in Qatar for their managers to worry about.\nMany clubs have enjoyed warm-weather training and have played or are to play friendlies to prepare for the Premier League\u2019s Boxing Day return.

With Liverpool to come in the Carabao Cup on 22 December, he would not mind a few more going out in the quarter-finals. Anyone who makes it to the last four is in effect in Qatar for the duration, with a third-place playoff a week on Saturday, 24 hours before the final.\n\nCity\u2019s rivals at Old Trafford are still getting plenty of postcards with skyscrapers and camels on. A mere four of their 14 callups have received a Qatari exit stamp on their passports and one of those is Facundo Pellistri, who is yet to feature under Erik ten Hag, and another is Hannibal Mejbri, who is on loan at Birmingham. The remainder of the squad was taken to southern Spain, minus Jadon Sancho. Anthony Martial, David de Gea and Scott McTominay were joined by a group of teenagers, coming together to lose 4-2 in a friendly against C\u00e1diz.\n\nBournemouth\u2019s two representatives were back after the group stage as Kieffer Moore and Chris Mepham could not help Wales to more than a draw against the USA. It was a similar story for Crystal Palace as Joachim Andersen and Jordan Ayew made swift returns.\nFor those still in Qatar, managers will be pleased that after an intense period where teams were playing every three days, there have been longer breaks to aid recovery. Players being overworked in Doha\u2019s heat before an intense period over Christmas will not be the desired outcome for clubs.\nThe Guardian columnist Karen Carney has written of how it would take her six months to recover from a major tournament because of the physical and mental exertion. It is unlikely she is alone in that. Managers do not have time to wait on their players to recover their equilibrium when they will be required to be fit and firing for the second half of the season. For Spain\u2019s players, who felt they had a chance of winning the tournament, a shock defeat at the hands of Morocco in a farcically subdued fashion may leave them needing to have their confidence rebuilt.\nSome of those have barely kicked a ball in anger for a month, spending most \u2013 if not all \u2013 their time in Qatar on the bench. The Spain goalkeepers Robert S\u00e1nchez and David Raya, of Brighton and Brentford respectively, have enjoyed a watching brief and are short of match action. The effects on an outfield player of enduring a period without action will be interesting because they may not be fully up to speed upon their return. Leicester\u2019s Wout Faes did not get on the pitch for Belgium and he could be called upon on 20 December for a Carabao Cup match.\nOnce players make it back to England, not only will they be required to reintegrate into their clubs, they will need to reacclimatise. It will be a big adjustment for body and mind to swap 30C for frosted windows and freezing temperatures for training.\nAs players return in dribs and drabs in varying degrees of physical and mental readiness, coaches face a very tough period of assessing their troops and planning for an unrelenting schedule. Those that do it best could be the ones achieving their goals come May."

I know that full well.\n\u201cBut for the moment we are not world champions. And if I have to believe the Dutch media, we will never become world champions.\u201d\nVan Gaal further acknowledged the rumblings that have linked him with the vacancy, saying: \u201cBelgium is a wonderful country with really friendly people \u2013 [Knokke-Heist] is a wonderful beach town \u2013 so yes I\u2019ve thought about it.\u201d\nPressed to expand on what it would take for him to take the job, Van Gaal said that Belgium\u2019s Football Association needed to persuade his wife, Truus, in order to close the deal.\n\n\u201cYou have to convince Truus,\u201d Van Gaal said. \u201cJoking aside, I am always at liberty to take decisions myself but there are certain countries that I won\u2019t move to, and my wife, Truus, will certainly not move to.\u201d\nThe speculation did not end with Belgium. Asked whether taking the reins of an African side would pass muster with his wife, Van Gaal again left the door open: \u201cI don\u2019t think so, but you\u2019ve got to keep your options open.\u201d\nThe 71-year-old Van Gaal, who recently had treatment for prostate cancer, is the oldest coach at the Qatar World Cup, having come out of retirement for a third stint at the helm of the Oranje after their defeat by the Czech Republic in the last 16 at last year\u2019s European Championship.\nThe team are 18 games unbeaten since then, having conceded only 14 times, making him an in-demand figure, with Ronald Koeman confirmed as his successor. But despite all the chatter on Friday over his future, Van Gaal insisted his eyes were fixed on the present.\n\u201cUSA has demonstrated that it has an excellent team, I would say even one of the best teams,\u201d Van Gaal said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a very tough match but it\u2019s nothing we can\u2019t overcome. We also have a good team.\u201d"

                    "body": "As the youngest United States men\u2019s national team in generations plotted their return to soccer\u2019s biggest stage after an eight-year absence, manager Gregg Berhalter relied on a captaincy-by-committee approach. More than a dozen different American players took on the role of captain over the past three and a half years as Berhalter rotated the armband across a leadership collective drawn from the team\u2019s senior players. But when the time finally arrived to select a World Cup captain, the question was put to a player vote. To no one\u2019s surprise, Tyler Adams got the call from his peers. As the United States prepare for Saturday\u2019s match with the Netherlands and an opportunity to reach the last eight of the World Cup for the first time in two decades, no single player has made a bigger impact than Adams, the Leeds United midfielder who has been the team\u2019s brightest star across three matches in Qatar, both on and off the pitch. The 23-year-old from Wappinger, New York, about 60 miles north of Manhattan, has thrived as the defensive bulwark of a midfield that will be the US team\u2019s biggest strength against the favored Dutch. Adams offers a controlled, efficient presence for the Americans from a deep position. He\u2019s also more than lived up to his role as the unflappable leader of a romper room that has fielded the youngest starting XI of any team at this World Cup. \u201cHis leadership has been vital to us from day one,\u201d Berhalter said early Wednesday morning after the US defeated Iran in a riveting group-stage finale to seal their progress to the knockout stage. \u201cIn this World Cup, he\u2019s extremely focused and his play has been outstanding over the course of these three games. He\u2019s been performing lights out.\u201d  Adams\u2019 age makes him an unorthodox choice as a World Cup skipper \u2013 the only other captain in the whole tournament under 30 is England\u2019s Harry Kane, who is 29 \u2013 but his maturity has made him a tailor-made fit for this precocious group. \u201cWhen you start talking about the captain types \u2026 Tyler fits a very specific role,\u201d said Berhalter. \u201cHe\u2019s the general, he\u2019s the strategist. He\u2019s the guy that goes out there and leads by example. When he talks, people listen.\u201d *** As much as Adams has stood out for the United States on the pitch, it\u2019s been his poise and composure off it that\u2019s captured attention back home. That was never clearer than earlier this week, when US Soccer\u2019s decision to scrub the emblem of the Islamic Republic from Iran\u2019s national flag on social media kicked off a political firestorm. At a tense news conference on Monday afternoon, a phalanx of Iranian press members peppered Berhalter and Adams with provocative questions that invoked US immigration policy, school shootings, runaway inflation rates and even America\u2019s military presence in the Gulf. Amid the barrage, Adams was sharply chastised by Iranian journalists for mispronouncing their country\u2019s name, then immediately pressed to answer for America\u2019s centuries-old legacy of inequality and racial discrimination. \u201cFirst of all, you say you support the Iranian people but you\u2019re pronouncing our country\u2019s name wrong: our country is named ee-ran, not eye-rahn,\u201d one reporter said. \u201cPlease once and for all, let\u2019s get this clear. Second of all, are you OK to be representing a country that has so [much] discrimination against Black people in its own borders?\u201d Adams, after apologizing for the mispronunciation, delivered a confident, assured response. \u201cThere\u2019s discrimination everywhere you go,\u201d Adams said. \u201cOne thing that I\u2019ve learned, especially from living abroad in the past few years and having to fit in and kind of assimilate into different cultures, is that in the US we\u2019re continuing to make progress every single day. \u201cGrowing up for me, I was in a white family with an African-American heritage and background, as well. So I had a little bit of different cultures and I was very easily able to assimilate in different cultures. Not everyone has that, that ease and the ability to do that, and obviously it takes longer for some to understand. Through education, I think it\u2019s super important. Like you just educated me now on the pronunciation of your country. It\u2019s a process. I think, as long as you see progress, that\u2019s the most important thing.\u201d  The exchange has since gone viral, spreading far beyond the typically parochial soccer discourse in the United States into the mainstream, making for think-piece fodder and winning the praise of commentators who typically focus exclusively on the country\u2019s more established sports. *** Adams, who has a white mother and a Black father but grew up in a white family, is the frontman of a diverse and multicultural US collective that reflects the nation they represent like never before. Although Latino players remain curiously underrepresented, nearly half of the 26-man squad is comprised of players of color \u2013 a long-overdue shift in a nation where the sport has far too long been the province of upper- and middle-class white kids. He joined the New York Red Bulls\u2019 academy in 2011, during childhood idol Thierry Henry\u2019s four-year stint in Major League Soccer. Adams signed a professional contract and made his senior-team debut four years later. Having forged a reputation as an industrious ball-winning defensive midfielder, Adams moved to NYRB\u2019s sister club RB Leipzig in 2019, making his biggest splash when he fired in the last-gasp winner that lifted the Bundesliga club into the Champions League semi-finals. After three promising seasons in Germany, he landed at Leeds in a $24.2m (\u00a320m) transfer this summer, where he has come into his own under the American manager Jesse Marsch and alongside US teammate Brenden Aaronson.  Cutting his teeth in two of the world\u2019s best leagues has done wonders for Adams\u2019 play and it\u2019s paid off handsomely in Qatar, where he\u2019s passed well and made countless important interceptions in the No 6 role, helping the Americans overrun the midfield for long stretches. But as Berhalter has noted, his readiness as a locker-room leader was apparent from the moment he made his international debut back in 2017. \u201cWe think he has great leadership capabilities and he leads by his actions and his words,\u201d Berhalter said. \u201cTyler\u2019s a guy that\u2019s just mature beyond his years, and you notice it from the minute you start talking to him. He\u2019s a guy that teammates know exactly what they\u2019re going to get from him. They know that he\u2019s going to go out on the field and compete.\u201d For Adams, who wants to pursue sports psychology once his playing days are done, it\u2019s a moment that he\u2019s prepared for since he first broke in with the national team. \u201cOne thing, at the end of the day, that I always want to do is I want to be a winner,\u201d Adams said last week. \u201cSo first off, I\u2019m very competitive. I want to hold the guys around me to the same standard. I don\u2019t want to lose and then have to point the finger and say \u2018You let me down today\u2019. I just want to make sure that everyone\u2019s on the same page. Intensity-wise, mentality-wise, that we all buy into the same thing. \u201cI think I\u2019ve been doing that since a young age and as much as I know my strengths, I know my weaknesses as well. And I want people to criticize me. I\u2019m open to feedback all the time and I want to get better and improve.\u201d"

An unusual plea to both football associations and players to put political and human rights concerns to one side for the duration of the tournament, Infantino\u2019s communication comes just two weeks before the start of competition and with a number of concerns on the part of both FAs and non-governmental organisations yet to be resolved.  In his letter, Infantino attempts to defuse concerns over the staging of the tournament in Qatar by arguing \u201cthere are many challenges and difficulties of a political nature all around the world\u201d, but football should not be expected to have an answer to every one. Regarding concerns over the safety of travelling fans in the country he reiterates a promise that \u201ceveryone is welcome regardless of origin, background, religion, gender, sexual orientation or nationality\u201d, a more detailed commitment than that currently made by the hosts. Infantino, who has been president of Fifa since 2016, did not preside over the decision to award this year\u2019s tournament to the Gulf state, and has overseen a series of initiatives that have helped contribute towards reforms \u2013 including the abolition of the kafala system of employment \u2013 to Qatar. But he has also been effusive in his praise for the event and its hosts, claiming frequently that the country will deliver the \u201cbest ever\u201d World Cup as well as arguing that the presence of the world\u2019s most popular sporting event will help bring about lasting change in the country. A number of competing nations, however, are still waiting for Fifa to respond to a variety of appeals related to the tournament including providing funds to remedy the harm experienced by migrant workers in constructing World Cup stadiums. A commitment from Fifa is yet to be forthcoming on such a scheme endorsed by the Welsh, English and Dutch FAs as well as the US Soccer Federation. Players of both England and Wales have agreed to wear rainbow armbands during matches in support of LGBTQ+ rights. This week, however, the Welsh FA said it was still waiting for the game\u2019s governing body to tell them whether the armbands might actually be banned."

                    "body": "Shares in ITV fell steeply after the broadcaster forecast a lukewarm revenue boost from airing the World Cup, heightening investor fears that the cost of living crisis will crash the UK advertising market. The UK\u2019s largest commercial broadcaster has forecast year-on-year increases of 3% for November and 5-10% in December \u2013 which, with the World Cup and the Christmas marketing blitz, would usually mean an advertising bonanza. \u201cRelative to the overall UK ad market, ITV has done OK,\u201d said Simon Davis, founder of the media agency Walk-In Media. \u201cThe problem is the rapid decline in total market revenue in the second half, which was not forecast. Overall, the fourth quarter is going to be flat for ITV, and that is with a World Cup. \u201cWhen the World Cup is in June it normally drives double-digit growth, and ITV\u2019s December forecast will only hold up if England progress to the quarter-finals and beyond. As recently as the summer, ITV will have hoped for much better.\u201d Historically, the tournament is a bonanza for ITV, with advertisers clamouring to pay up to \u00a3500,000 for a 30-second slot in a high-profile England game. However, multiple media agency sources say that this time the World Cup is saving ITV from a poor year overall, making up for a wider malaise that is increasingly affecting the UK ad market and therefore not providing the usual major boost to revenues. The event\u2019s timing also means that many advertisers who might launch special ad campaigns when the World Cup is held during the summer in the northern hemisphere are not earmarking extra budget this time because the tournament falls within their traditional Christmas spending plans. Some advertisers also have concerns about campaigns that associate their brands with the World Cup host Qatar\u2019s human rights record. Rattled investors sent ITV\u2019s share price down more than 6% in morning trading on Wednesday, making it one of the biggest fallers in the FTSE 250. ITV said that total ad revenues, including TV, digital and sponsorship, had fallen 2% in the nine months to the end of September. In its last financial report the broadcaster said it expected income to be \u201cbroadly flat\u201d for the period. The broadcaster\u2019s figures show a steady deterioration in the UK ad market since the middle of the year, with August down 21% and September falling 14%. Overall, third-quarter ad revenue will be down 14% year on year. Strong double-digit growth at ITV Studios, which makes shows including I\u2019m A Celebrity \u2026 Get Me Out of Here, Hell\u2019s Kitchen and A Spy Among Friends, failed to temper market sentiment. The 16% increase in revenues in the first nine months at ITV Studios, which makes shows for ITV and other broadcasters, offset the fall in ad revenue, pushing total ITV revenues up 6% to \u00a32.5bn. ITV is due to launch its new ad-supported streaming service, ITVX, which will replace ITV Hub and include a paid tier with access to content from its BritBox joint venture with the BBC, on 8 December. \u201cWhile we remain mindful of the macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, there\u2019s strong operational momentum,\u201d said Carolyn McCall, the chief executive of ITV. Advertisers are pulling back on overall marketing spend, with the industry body Warc forecasting 4.5% year-on-year growth for the final quarter, the smallest for a Christmas period in almost a decade, excluding 2020 when the nation was in the grip of pandemic lockdown restrictions."

Jewellery and watches were among the items stolen at the home of the Chelsea winger, who is understood to have been left \u201cshaken\u201d by the break-in and left fearing for the safety of his fiancee and children.\nAs it stands Gareth Southgate must prepare for the task of facing the world champions on the basis that Sterling is not available. England are not short of options in attack. Sterling has lost his place since the start of the tournament and Southgate said the former Manchester City was not due to be in the starting XI against Senegal.\n\nEngland had Bukayo Saka and Phil Foden on the flanks against Senegal. Southgate also has James Maddison, Marcus Rashford, Jack Grealish and Mason Mount competing for places in the wide positions.\nIt is likely Saka and Foden will keep their places on the wings against France. Sterling started the tournament by scoring when England beat Iran 6-2 in their opening game, but he was substituted after a disappointing performance in the goalless draw against the USA. He was then an unused substitute when England sealed their place in the knockout stages by beating Wales.\nSurrey police confirmed on Monday they are investigating a burglary at a property in Oxshott. The force said it had been contacted at 9pm on Saturday after Sterling\u2019s family returned home from an international trip to discover items missing. It is unclear when the burglary occurred. There had been no threat of violence involved and no one present at the property when the burglary took place.\nThe Football Association has reiterated to England\u2019s players that additional security measures can be put in place at their homes while they are away. English football\u2019s governing body spoke to the squad before the World Cup telling them they would have access to extra support before flying to Qatar. The FA liaises with local police forces when players request increased security at their residences."

                    "body": "A Qatar-led bid to take over Manchester United should not be entertained because of concerns about state influence and human rights abuses in the country, rights groups say. Fears about an offer to buy the club have been raised by Amnesty International\u2019s Manchester branch, which said it had been contacted by fans who were very worried by the news. LGBTQ+ fan club the Rainbow Devils said it had deep concern about the bid, while FairSquare, a human rights group, has written to Uefa urging it to block a Qatar-led takeover. The offer to buy the football club was revealed on Friday, with the bidder \u2013 Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad al-Thani, the chairman of one of Qatar\u2019s biggest banks and son of the former prime minister \u2013 saying he wanted to \u201creturn the club to its former glories\u201d. Manchester United is being sold by owners the Glazer family, who are thought to have received several offers of about $5bn (\u00a34.5bn). Other bidders include British billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe, owner of chemicals group Ineos, and Elliott, a US-based investment management company. Prospective buyers had a \u201csoft deadline\u201d of Friday to table their interest. Qatar, which hosted the World Cup last year, has faced widespread criticism over human rights, including its treatment of migrant workers and of LGBTQ+ rights. During preparations for the World Cup, reports of worker abuse were widespread. Homosexuality in Qatar is illegal. Cass Hyde of the Rainbow Devils said it wished to remain \u201cdiplomatic\u201d in order to have a relationship with the owners, whoever they were. But she said there was no denying that Qatar\u2019s record on LGBTQ+ rights was \u201cgenuinely dreadful\u201d, which she said was of \u201cmassive concern\u201d. The group is planning a survey of its members in the coming days and has not ruled out protests or other action if it considers it necessary. \u201cWhoever the club\u2019s new owners are must commit to making football a sport for everyone, including LGBTQ+ supporters, players and staff,\u201d she said. Amnesty International\u2019s Manchester offshoot said it had been contacted by several United supporters, who were \u201cvery worried and want to be involved in trying to make our voice heard\u201d. \u201cThe majority of United fans will probably be happy. Football is a joy for them; it\u2019s not a priority to think about human rights in a faraway country,\u201d said Kathryn Fletcher of the group. \u201cBut at what price are we prepared to have success at the club? We\u2019re not asking people not to support the team, but to think about the implications of being involved with a country that\u2019s got poor human rights.\u201d Concerns have also been raised about the potential for state influence. FairSquare has written to Uefa urging it to block a Qatar-led takeover of the club, saying it would be \u201cimpossible\u201d to ensure the buyers were free of state influence. James Lynch, a director of FairSquare, said owning Manchester United would give Qatar access to \u201call the brand power that football offers\u201d as well as \u201caccess to a devoted fanbase\u201d. He added: \u201cThese are not commercial investments. They are done as part of a state project to boost their image and it\u2019s partly that it allows an avenue to pursue political aims.\u201d If the Qatar-led bid is successful, it would see the club join a growing number of European teams owned by Gulf states. Manchester City have been majority owned by the UAE since 2008, and Newcastle United were bought in 2021 in a \u00a3305m Saudi Arabian-backed takeover.  Since 2011, Qatar\u2019s emir, Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, has owned the French team Paris Saint-Germain through Qatar Sports Investments. This weekend there was talk of plans for protests, including from fans who intended to bring a \u201cNo to Qatar\u201d banner to Sunday\u2019s game against Leicester City. Other fans who support the Qatari bid suggested online that they would bring Qatari flags. Niall Couper, chief executive of Fair Game, an organisation of professional football clubs campaigning to change the governance of the game in England and Wales, said the Qatar-led bid raised broader questions about ownership of football clubs. \u201cOwners are role models to their communities and the fans who follow their team. The question that has never been properly addressed is: who do we want to be owning our clubs? Who should be those role models?\u201d he said. \u201cWe need an independent regulator with real teeth which runs an owners and directors test that is finally fit and proper.\u201d"

Di Cunningham, the co-founder of the Three Lions Pride group, said she was disappointed in Beckham\u2019s decision to accept a deal \u2013 reported to be worth \u00a3150m \u2013 given that Qatari law criminalises same-sex relationships. Cunningham was one among those who travelled to Russia for the World Cup in 2018. However, she said that Three Lions Pride would not go to Qatar because there was \u201cno sign \u2013 as there was in Russia \u2013 of any appetite to relax or review the toxic environment there is for LGBTQ+ and other minority groups\u201d.  Speaking at a Sport &amp; Rights Alliance press briefing on Wednesday, Cunningham also praised those players who had spoken out in favour of LGBT+ rights in Qatar, before turning her focus on to Beckham, a former England captain. \u201cOne of the difficulties is having people taking the money in order to promote Qatar and the World Cup,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just so disappointed because we \u2013 the LGBTQ+ football family \u2013 have put David Beckham on a pedestal, as a great ally. \u201cAnd then it turns out that he\u2019s taking a lot of money to be an ambassador for this World Cup, and that\u2019s incredibly disappointing. So I really hope that the message has got through that people will be criticised for that.\u201d Meanwhile, Minky Worden from Human Rights Watch urged Fifa to never again go to a country that does not uphold basic human rights. \u201cAthletes are effectively hostages,\u201d she warned. \u201cThey are lashed to the ship of Fifa and they have to go wherever the World Cup or the Club World Cup goes. And I think for many fans, athletes and others, the last decade has been a very bitter lesson.\u201d Worden also called for a human rights framework to be put in place for future bids before adding: \u201cThere can never again be a World Cup that does not uphold basic human rights and puts athletes whose job is their place of work in the invidious position of having to fear for their identity. \u201cWe should never again have a World Cup that fails to respect basic human rights and has none of the expected assurances and protections.\u201d"

                    "body": "After Japan\u2019s stunning victory over Germany in their opening match of the Qatar World Cup, fans of the Samurai Blue are daring to dream their team could reach the quarter-finals for the first time. Their remarkable comeback last week has electrified Japan, where hardcore and casual fans alike stayed up until midnight to watch their victory over the four-time world champions. \u201cWe\u2019re just one game in, but Japan are already exceeding expectations,\u201d said Dan Orlowitz, a sports reporter with the Japan Times. \u201cI would have been more than happy with a draw against Germany, but to actually get the win is phenomenal.\u201d Japan\u2019s travelling fans have already endeared themselves to their hosts, not least for cleaning up after themselves following the Germany match \u2013 a ritual that stretches back decades. That goodwill extends to the team, who left stadium staff gifts of origami paper cranes in their spotless dressing room. Japan\u2019s players, who are up against Costa Rica on Sunday, say they are spearheading an Asian challenge to football royalty from Europe and South America \u2013 a mission whose accomplishments include Saudi Arabia\u2019s shock win over Argentina. \u201cIt certainly feels like this could turn out to be a great tournament for Asian countries,\u201d said Jeremy Walker, editor of Sporting Asia, the Olympic Council of Asia\u2019s official magazine. \u201cThe wins for Saudi Arabia and Japan were a huge step forward for Asian football, especially in the Middle East,\u201d said Walker, who has reported on Japan at three World Cups and is now based in Kuwait.  \u201cThe locals here were cheering for Japan, too, so there is a strong feeling of pride that Asian teams have beaten two superpowers in Argentina and Germany. Qatar and Iran were disappointing in their first matches, but Saudi Arabia and Japan have changed the atmosphere. But can an Asian team reach the semi-finals, like South Korea in 2002? That\u2019s going to be very tough.\u201d Orlowitz agrees the tide has turned for Asian teams after Qatar and Iran lost their opening matches. \u201cI think there was a lot of concern among Asian football watchers early on with Qatar and Iran, but since then Asia has had a very respectable showing. The challenge will be getting into the quarter-finals. It may be too early to start thinking about that, but there\u2019s room for hope.\u201d Japan\u2019s coach, Hajime Moriyasu, could cement his newfound status as national hero if he achieves his goal of taking Japan to the last eight for the first time since their World Cup debut at France 1998, and four years after they came agonisingly close in Russia. \u201cI believe it\u2019s a historic moment, a historic victory,\u201d he said after the Germany game. \u201cIf I think about the development of Japanese soccer, thinking of the players, for them this was a big surprise.\u201d While Moriyasu revelled in his players\u2019 heroics, fans back home were awaiting the next appearance by Taiyo, an eight-year-old river otter at an aquarium in Tokyo, which predicted Japan would beat Germany the day before the match.  If they repeat the feat against Costa Rica, they could make the knockout stages irrespective of the result of their final group match against Spain. But as the team\u2019s fans anticipated a second raucous night of celebration this weekend, the players were trying \u2013 with little success \u2013 to play down their prospects. \u201cWe haven\u2019t changed history yet, but I think it was a historic match, so I celebrated with my teammates,\u201d said Ritsu Doan, who scored Japan\u2019s first goal against Germany. \u201cBut from today, I\u2019ve changed my mindset and am preparing for the Costa Rica game. It\u2019s important not to get big-headed.\u201d"

He went to school there and played for England\u2019s youth teams before deciding to represent Germany at senior level. The Bayern Munich midfielder is conscious of how vital his formative years were.\n\u201cIn the England youth teams you learn different things than you do playing in Germany,\u201d Musiala said. \u201cI took home many messages. It was a different environment in the England youth setup. \n\n\u201cThey set great store by individual technique and one\u2011on\u2011one play. To play with freedom was the motto at the time. That is what inspired me and will stay with me for all of my footballing life.\u201d\nGermany have an impressive major\u2011tournament record which includes four World Cup triumphs, the most recent in 2014. But Musiala believes his nation can still learn from England. \n\u201cEngland have enormous qualities as far as individual players are concerned,\u201d he said. \n\u201cAll the England players go for one\u2011on-one duels so that is something we can learn about the courage not to avoid any dribbles.\u201d\n\nAs a youngster Musiala wanted England to win. \u201cI didn\u2019t go for the face paint when I was small but playing for the England youth teams I did of course support the Three Lions,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope they do well of course because for a while it was part of my life.

Fifa has asked that all captains wear a different armband on each match day, promoting social messages such as \u201cFootball unites the world\u201d, \u201cShare the meal\u201d and \u201cBring the moves\u201d. It could even send an official into dressing rooms before matches to remove any \u201cOneLove\u201d armbands.\n\nEngland and Wales had planned to defy Fifa\u2019s request by wearing the rainbow armband. The Football Association wrote to the game\u2019s governing body about its plans in September but received no response. The FA had indicated it would be prepared to receive a fine and has been seeking clarification over whether Kane could start the game on a booking if the England captain dons the armband against Iran, but without a response from the governing body.\nThe suggestion has been made to the FA that because there is no precedent Fifa could have a free hand in selecting the punishment for a breach of equipment regulations. The FA is hoping for a final decision from Fifa on Monday morning to give the players as much time as possible to concentrate on preparing for the match. Fifa has been approached for comment.\nKane stressed his desire to wear the armband before England face Iran in their opening game in Group B. \u201cWe\u2019ve made it clear as a team and a staff and organisation that we want to wear the armband,\u201d the striker said. \u201cI know the FA are talking to Fifa at the moment and I\u2019m sure by game time tomorrow they will have their decision. I think we\u2019ve made it clear that we want to wear it.\u201d\n\nGareth Southgate echoed those comments. \u201cI know there are conversations going on,\u201d the England head coach said. \u201cI think a number of European countries have spoken.

But the DFB is concerned that Neuer could be booked. Two cautions in different matches lead to a suspension from the next game, although single yellow cards are wiped after the quarter-finals.\nVirgil van Dijk is worried about the consequences of wearing the armband when the Netherlands face Senegal on Monday. \u201cI will wear the one love armband,\u201d the Netherlands captain said. \u201cNothing changed from our point of view. If I will get a yellow card for wearing it, then we would have to discuss it because I don\u2019t like to play while being on a yellow.\u201d\nVan Dijk is expected to wear two armbands, also taking the field with the official Fifa one. England\u2019s players will demonstrate their opposition to discrimination by taking the knee before kick-off. The squad discussed the issue before training on Sunday.\n\u201cWe feel we should,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cWe think it\u2019s a strong statement that will go around the world, especially for young people, that inclusivity is important.\u201d"

                    "body": "Wherever Fahad, a gay man in his 40s, walks in his home city of Doha, from the Qatari capital\u2019s coastal promenade, known as the Corniche, to the gleaming streets of the super-modern downtown Msheireb district, David Beckham smiles down from the billboards and the big flashing screens. The former England captain, husband to the former Spice Girl Victoria, father to Brooklyn, Romeo, Harper and Cruz, is not just a face of the World Cup kicking off this Sunday, he is the pre-eminent figure \u2013 a 2022 version of the 1966 mascot World Cup Willie some might be tempted to say, if not something cruder. Fahad tries to be understanding about the temptation posed by the \u00a3150m deal that Beckham is said to have been offered by Qatar, albeit the value of the contract is disputed. But the former footballer\u2019s decision to accept the fortune from the royal house of Thani and take up the ambassadorial role is, to Fahad\u2019s mind, a damnable pact worthy only of scorn. \u201cI see that his future will be ruined but at least he will have some millions,\u201d said Fahad, who as a younger man spent two and a half months in solitary confinement in a Qatari prison for the crime of wearing makeup. \u201cNo, nothing has changed for us.\u201d Same-sex sexual activity is punishable by seven years in prison in Qatar. Under an interpretation of sharia law, it can lead to a death sentence. There is not so much an LGBTQ+ community in Qatar as a disparate collection of terrified individuals. This summer, Beckham, 47, took part in a promotional film for Visit Qatar in which he spoke of the pride of Qataris about their culture. \u201cThe modern and traditional fuse to create something really special,\u201d he said. It is his image flashing across Qatari World Cup Snapchat and Instagram channels. In a video message to a youth festival in Doha on Thursday he claimed the World Cup would be a platform for progress, inclusivity and tolerance. Two weeks ago, Beckham, donning dark sunglasses, posed alongside the British sculptor Hugo Dalton and his installation of golden goal posts on Doha\u2019s Lusail City Marina. In a jarring contrast, Human Rights Watch reported just a few days before the sunny photoshoot on the suffering of gay and transgender people who said they had been detained as recently as October in an underground prison in Doha\u2019s Al Dafna district, six miles south of the golden posts, where they had been variously verbally abused, slapped, kicked and punched until they bled. One woman said she lost consciousness. Beckham\u2019s friend and former teammate Gary Neville was recently on the rough end of an appearance on the news panel show Have I Got News for You over his World Cup contract with the state-owned broadcaster beIN Sports. Robbie Williams and Black Eyed Peas have come under fire for agreeing to perform. But Beckham, contrary to the pet name Golden Balls given to him by his wife in the innocent days of 2008, when he could do no wrong, has been the central target of the opprobrium. Back in 2002 Beckham posed for the cover of Attitude, the gay magazine, and subsequently made the undeniably pioneering statement in a game riddled with homophobia that he was \u201chonoured to have the tag of gay icon\u201d. The distance Beckham has seemingly travelled in the last two decades might account for much of the vehemence of the backlash coming his way. The relationship with Qatar, a country with which he has longstanding links from his time as a player at the French club, Paris Saint-Germain, owned by Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the emir of Qatar, now arguably presents the biggest risk to the Beckham brand since his talent and \u201ccurtains\u201d haircut caught the public attention with an audacious halfway-line goal against Wimbledon in 1996 in the red of Manchester United. Piara Powar, the director of Fare, an anti-discrimination group that has an arrangement with Fifa to post monitors in the World Cup stadiums in Qatar, said it had pleaded behind the scenes without success for the country\u2019s supreme committee, in charge of the event, to make a public statement welcoming LGBTQ+ people to the football. \u201cThey were prepared to say some things off the record but not to do anything publicly,\u201d Powar said of conversations that had carried on up to October. Judgments would be made, he suggested, about Beckham\u2019s decision to maintain his link. \u201cSome of the things that people like David Beckham are learning is that human rights are universal and non-negotiable,\u201d he said. \u201cI have no doubt that the LGBTI community in western Europe will see him as somehow a traitor or someone who used to be an ally but no longer is.\u201d The comedian Joe Lycett said this week that he would put \u00a310,000 of his own money into a shredder if Beckham did not end his deal with Qatar. Picking up his award for man of the year at the Attitude awards, the world\u2019s only out top-tier footballer, Josh Cavallo, from Australia, told the audience: \u201cTake that, David Beckham,\u201d before appealing for him to speak out about LGBTQ+ rights in Qatar. Beckham said this week: \u201cQatar dreamed of bringing the World Cup to a place that it had never been before, but that it wouldn\u2019t be enough just to achieve things on the pitch. The pitch would be a platform for progress.\u201d But Peter Tatchell, the human rights campaigner, who visited Qatar last month to stage a daring one day protest, could not be more withering. \u201cDespite Qatar being a sexist, homophobic and racist dictatorship, he\u2019s reportedly described it as \u2018perfection\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cBeckham was once a LGBT+ ally and icon but no more. He\u2019s taken his 30 pieces of silver. Putting money before principles, he seems driven solely by pure greed.\u201d But could this really be terminal for the Beckham brand? Andy Milligan, the author of Brand It Like Beckham, a book chronicling the building of the image of the boy from Leytonstone, has his doubts. Beckham had maintained his appeal across the demographics for over a quarter of century, he said, despite episodes that would have surely killed off other celebrity figures. There was the alleged affair in 2004 with his personal assistant Rebecca Loos (denied by Beckham), the petulant red card in the 1998 World Cup tie with Argentina that some speculate cost England the tournament, and then, perhaps most dangerous of all, the leak of emails published by European newspapers, in spite of an injunction, in 2017, which Beckham had railed in foul-mouthed terms to an aide about his lack of a knighthood.  This is not even the first time he has put his name in the hands of an authoritarian regime. Beckham became China\u2019s global soccer ambassador in 2013 at a time when the game there had been tarnished by a match-fixing scandal and an exodus of internationals from the country\u2019s Super League. \u201cThis is a wonderful sport that inspires people across the world and brings families together, so I\u2019m relishing the opportunity of introducing more fans to the game,\u201d Beckham said then. Despite it all, the Beckham brand keeps going \u2013 and growing. The latest accounts of Beckham\u2019s company DB Ventures mention deals with Adidas, the video game company Electronic Arts, the watch brand Tudor and the scotch whisky Haig Club. In 2020, the company posted an after-tax profit of \u00a310.5m on a turnover of \u00a311.3m. This for a man who retired from football in 2013. \u201cHe has tended to be resilient because there is an awful lot of goodwill in the bank towards his brand,\u201d said Milligan. \u201cIt comes back to character. Because for so many years he represented a lot of things people value: dedication, patriotism towards England, his work around children [as a Unicef goodwill ambassador] and the fact that everywhere around the world he is liked. \u201cDespite the fact that he is incredibly famous, he has a down-to-earth feeling about him. He queues for 13 hours to see the Queen\u2019s coffin, he retains the Essex accent, he comes across humbly and that appeals to people around the world, particularly in Asia where humility is highly valued.\u201d Beckham offered a combination of \u201cfootball, fashion and feelgood\u201d \u2013 and his \u201csmartness is often underestimated\u201d, Milligan said. He said: \u201cMaybe most importantly he has an ability to recognise and take very good advice. So I think both him and Victoria have made smart decisions on who they have had around them to advise them.  \u201cHis very first choice of agent before Simon Fuller [former manager of the Spice Girls], when he was on loan at Preston North End, was Alan Shearer\u2019s agent.\u201d This February, Beckham shuffled his team. Longstanding friend and business manager Dave Gardner stepped aside, and the US giant Authentic Brands Group (ABG) paid $269m (\u00a3225m) to take a controlling stake in DB Ventures. \u201cOur shared vision makes ABG the ideal strategic partner to help unlock the full potential of my brand and business,\u201d Beckham said. \u201cThe question is, if there is an effect how long will it last?\u201d Milligan said of the impact of Qatar on its star name. \u201cIf you look at Beckham\u2019s history, the show moves on. We have very short memories nowadays. We are highly distractible, with short attention spans and a new story will emerge very quickly after the World Cup.\u201d Some may think it is all over for brand Beckham but there is every chance he will bounce right back."

                    "body": "It has the big screen, the pumping music and the Fifa branding, but this is a fan zone with a difference. There are no visiting supporters, no women, no team colours and certainly no beer. The clue is in the venue: a cricket stadium on the edge of Doha. Inside, thousands of mostly south Asian low-wage labourers, fill the stands or sit cross-legged on the grassy outfield.  It is a world away from the polished face of Doha that most fans will see. The stadium fan zone is within Asian Town, a shopping and entertainment complex purpose-built for Qatar\u2019s migrant workers about 30 minutes by car from the city centre. A vast expanse of warehouses, workshops and accommodation blocks stretches out for miles on one side, housing hundreds of thousands of workers, often in grim, crowded dorms. On a wall near the entrance to the fan zone, a banner in Arabic, English and Hindi reads: \u201cThanks for your contributions for delivering the best Fifa World Cup ever.\u201d  Many here probably played a part in building the stadiums and infrastructure for the tournament, but gratitude has its limits. While some match tickets went on sale for Qatar residents for just 40 rials (\u00a39), no one the Guardian spoke to had managed to get one. Any that were available were far too expensive for workers who earn as little as \u00a3225 a month. Without a match ticket, they are unable to register for a Hayya card, which is needed to enter the main fan zones in Doha. Even if they could, the efficient and cheap Metro does not reach this part of the city, forcing workers to take more costly alternatives. The fan zone, and Asian Town itself, highlight the parallel lives that many migrant workers inhabit. Critics say it entrenches divisions, the unspoken message being: you can have your restaurants, shops and fan zone, as long as you don\u2019t come to ours.  As the match between Spain and Costa Rica kicks off, Dilip Kumar Mandal from Nepal looks thrilled. \u201cI come every night. I like the environment,\u201d he says. Asked which team he is supporting, he pauses and says, \u201cThe red one.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019d like to be in a stadium, but I have no money. Whatever I earn, I have to send home for my children\u2019s education,\u201d he adds. Mandal, a mason, is just happy to be there. Before the World Cup began, 350 of his workmates were ordered home, as his company, like many others, wound down its work on instructions from the government. As Spain score their first goal, he punches the air. \u201cYes! I knew they\u2019d score,\u201d he says, his face glowing red in the light of the giant screen. Sitting nearby, Stephen* from Ghana works at the airport, transferring inflight meals to the planes. It\u2019s his day off, but during the week, \u201cAll I do is work, sleep, work, sleep, work, sleep,\u201d he says. Like Dilip, he could not afford a match ticket, but unlike him, he speaks about football as fluently as the Spanish play it. As another goal slides in, he enthuses about Ghana\u2019s chances: \u201cI just hope I can get off work to watch them,\u201d he says. As half-time approaches, hundreds surge towards the stage, and are soon rewarded, not by another goal, but by an MC and her four female dancers. She gives a shoutout to, \u201cMy African friends\u201d, before reeling off the other countries that make up the bulk of Qatar\u2019s migrant workforce: India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and the Philippines.  There are no team colours or flags on display. With the exception of Ghana, none of these nations qualified for the World Cup and so decisions about who to support appear to be determined by a favourite player or the colour of a shirt. In the stands, Mohammed Malik from Bangladesh says he comes to watch the matches every day. He has nothing better to do. \u201cMy company stopped sending us to work because we can\u2019t access our worksite during the World Cup. They\u2019ve stopped paying us too,\u201d says the 42-year-old carpenter. Yam Kumar Rajbanshi, a forklift operator, is another regular in the fan zone. \u201cI come every night. I love football more than cricket. Brazil will win,\u201d he says confidently. Rajbanshi, from Nepal, said a ticket for a match cost too much \u2013 half his monthly salary \u2013 but he did not seem to care. \u201cIt\u2019s better to watch here!\u201d  As Spain stroll to a 7-0 win, the workers who helped make it possible, saunter back to their dorms, a band of south Indian drummers sending them on their way. * name changed to protect the individual\u2019s identity"

The Turkish chef, who owns a string of his Nusr-Et restaurants in cities including London, Dubai and New York, was shown holding, kissing and pretending to sprinkle salt on the World Cup trophy, and interrupting Argentina players\u2019 celebrations after their penalty shootout victory over France. The trophy is only supposed to be touched or held by a select group of people, including tournament winners and Fifa officials. Salt Bae, whose real name is Nusret G\u00f6k\u00e7e, could also be seen trying to get the attention of Argentina captain Lionel Messi after the game. Photographs were later posted to G\u00f6k\u00e7e\u2019s Instagram account. A statement by the governing body said: \u201cFollowing a review, Fifa has been establishing how individuals gained undue access to the pitch after the closing ceremony at Lusail stadium on 18 December. \u201cThe appropriate internal action will be taken.\u201d  G\u00f6k\u00e7e went viral on social media in 2017 after a video showed his over the top method of preparing and seasoning steak in front of diners. Since then he has established a chain of more than 20 restaurants. His west London eatery opened in September 2021, notoriously featuring a tomahawk steak wrapped in gold for \u00a32,000.  David Beckham, Leonardo DiCaprio and the Venezuelan president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, are among well-known diners to visit his restaurant. In the aftermath of Argentina\u2019s third World Cup win on Sunday, G\u00f6k\u00e7e could be seen walking around the pitch and trying to pose with bemused players, including Lisandro Martinez. Fifa head Gianni Infantino visited one of his restaurants in Dubai in January 2021, where he could be seen alongside G\u00f6k\u00e7e, mimicking his trademark salt-seasoning pose. \u201cMr Nusrat, number one, the best of the best, unforgettable evening in Dubai,\u201d Infantino said on the video, before calling him a \u201clegend\u201d. G\u00f6k\u00e7e posted a video during the World Cup of him embracing Infantino, and he was later pictured in VIP seats alongside Brazil players Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos and Cafu."

                    "body": "Hundreds of Heathrow airport workers will go on strike for three days later this month, potentially disrupting travel plans for football fans planning to fly to the World Cup in Qatar. The Unite union said 700 workers involved in ground handling, airside transport and cargo at Europe\u2019s busiest airport were to go on strike from the early hours of 18 November to the early hours of 21 November over pay demands. Fans jetting to the World Cup could face the prospect of missing England\u2019s first game, a group match against Iran on 21 November, as the strike action is expected to cause delays at Heathrow Terminals 2, 3 and 4. Qatar Airways operates from Terminal 4 and has scheduled an additional 10 flights a week during the tournament. The strike threatens to bring fresh disruption at Heathrow after a chaotic summer of cancelled flights, long delays, mountains of lost baggage and a daily passenger limit. It also raises more difficulties for its chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, after Heathrow\u2019s decision to implement a 100,000 daily passenger cap between mid-July and the end of October infuriated airlines. Sir Richard Branson, the owner of Virgin Atlantic, said earlier this week he would be \u201creally pissed off\u201d if Heathrow imposed further restrictions on capacity at Christmas. The summer disruption also led to speculation over Holland-Kaye\u2019s future at the airport, including criticism from Willie Walsh, the director general of airline body Iata and former boss of the British Airways parent group IAG, who described Heathrow as \u201ca bunch of idiots when it comes to running airports\u201d. \u201cStrike action will inevitably cause disruption, delays and cancellations to flights throughout Heathrow, with travellers to the World Cup particularly affected,\u201d said Kevin Hall, a regional officer at the Unite union. Other airlines that will be hit by the strike action include Singapore Airlines, Cathay Pacific and Emirates. Passengers returning to the US for the Thanksgiving holiday may also be affected. Ground handlers are responsible for aircraft while they are on the ground, assisting with the efficient arrival, turnaround and departure of jets. They also have responsibilities for handling baggage and freight. Airlines have responsibility for ground handling, and each airline makes its own arrangements for providing these services. The striking workers are employed by Dnata and Menzies. \u201cOur members at Dnata and Menzies undertake highly challenging roles and are simply seeking a decent pay rise,\u201d said Sharon Graham, the general secretary of Unite. \u201cBoth companies are highly profitable and can fully afford to make a fair pay increase.\u201d Unite said Dnata had offered its workers a 5% pay increase, while the offer from Menzies ranged from 2% to 6%. The union said both of the companies were offering real-terms pay cuts. A Heathrow spokesperson said: \u201cWe are aware of proposed industrial action from Dnata and Menzies colleagues at Heathrow, and we are in discussions with our airline partners on what contingency plans they can implement to support their ground handling should the strike go ahead. \u201cOur priority is to ensure passengers are not disrupted by airline ground handler shortages.\u201d Dnata said its UK airport operations business was making a financial loss each month as a result of inflation and the impact of the pandemic. The company called Unite\u2019s proposed salary increase \u201cirresponsible\u201d and said it did not \u201creflect the challenging economic environment\u201d for the business. Alex Doisneau, the managing director of Dnata UK, said the industrial action had come despite the company\u2019s offer to staff \u201cof an award which, with previous increases, amounts to a pay rise of 15.5% (20.2% for HGV drivers) since December 2021 \u2026 This is in line with inflation and among the best in the industry.\u201d Dnata said it was implementing contingency plans to minimise disruption to its operations during the strike.  Menzies Aviation called Unite \u201cobstructive\u201d and accused them of refusing to join discussions over a pay increase for its ground handlers. \u201cThis threatening of industrial action is all about creating sensationalist headlines rather than doing what\u2019s right for their members,\u201d said Miguel Gomez Sjunnesson, executive vice president Europe, Menzies Aviation. \u201cWe are ready and willing to continue pay discussions, which we believe is in the best interest of our employees.\u201d Menzies said it was also working on contingency plans."

                    "body": "German firms have signed a 15-year deal to buy 2m tonnes of liquid gas from Qatar, sending out mixed signals over the priority Germany places on human rights in the Gulf and its commitment to a carbon neutral energy supply. The deal was announced by state-owned Qatar Energy and deliveries will start from 2026. The gas will be sold by Qatar to the US company ConocoPhillips, which will then deliver it to the LNG terminal in Brunsb\u00fcttel, Qatar\u2019s energy minister said in the capital, Doha. Germany has been one of the countries most critical at the World Cup of Qatar\u2019s treatment of LGBTQ people, as well as the labour conditions of workers building the football stadiums. But the economics minister Robert Habeck, a Green party member, has also said that, faced with a need to wean itself off Russian gas supplies, Germany has to take its energy from a variety of sources. Habeck visited Doha in March, but disputes over the length of the contract delayed an agreement, with Qatar preferring a 25-year contract and Germany seeking something much more short term. He said on Tuesday: \u201cFifteen years was great. They look like good conditions to me.\u201d Germany is building four temporary emergency floating LNG terminals to offload liquid gas. Imminent construction of permanent terminals has been snarled up in planning delays, but is now going ahead, broadening Germany\u2019s ability to diversify its energy sources away from Russian pipelines. Qatar\u2019s gas will not arrive early enough to help Germany avoid energy shortages this winter and, potentially, the winter after. At present, Germany is confident it can avoid power outages this winter but is less confident that it will have the reserves to avoid power cuts or rationing in 2023-24.  The emirate\u2019s sovereign wealth fund is helping to finance a major corporate takeover via an RWE convertible bond. As a result, Qatar will become the largest shareholder in RWE, the Essen-based energy giant, with 9% of its shares. The relatively small size of the contract underlines Germany\u2019s desire to meet its carbon neutral targets, including reaching carbon neutrality in 2045, four years after the Qatar contract is due to end. Two million tonnes of liquid gas correspond to about 30 terawatt hours (TWh) or 3% of annual German energy consumption. Before the Ukraine war, about 500TWh of gas were supplied from Russia alone every year. Qatar is one of the world\u2019s largest exporters of LNG. The emirate has the third largest gas reserves in the world after Russia and Iran. Qatar shares the world\u2019s largest gas field with Iran, located off the country\u2019s coast. The vast majority of exports go to Asia, so far primarily to Japan, South Korea and India. Qatar wants to increase its LNG production by 60% by 2027, producing 126m tonnes annually."

Just 16 days until The Fiver rocks up to the local Boxpark and gets seriously on it, throwing \u00a38-a-pint grog into the air with abandon as the goals pile up when mighty Qatar take on Ecuador in a seriously thrilling Human Rights World Cup opener. Yeah baby! Footer fever! Freed from desire, mind and senses purified. We\u2019re on the ball, the world\u2019s in motion, and, y\u2019know, it could actually be coming home if Gareth could, like, literally increase the Three Lions\u2019 xG by getting it launched to the big man while controlling the half-spaces during the counter-press. Or something, given there\u2019s been a bit of talk that the event in Qatar may not be a Good Thing. Thanks, then, to Fifa overlord and Doha resident Gianni Infantino for reminding us all that \u201cthere are many challenges and difficulties of a political nature all around the world. Everyone is welcome regardless of origin, background, religion, gender, sexual orientation or nationality.\u201d In other words, bad stuff happens all over the place, so stop picking on this mega-rich, almost limitlessly-funded country for its human rights violations of migrant workers and treatment of the LGBTQ+ community. Infantino\u2019s advice was part of a letter sent to all 32 competing nations at the HRWC, urging them to \u201clet football take the stage\u201d, an echo of that \u201cstick to football\u201d stuff you see from reply guys like @DaveLuvBrexitNUFC242626 on assorted social media disgraces. Gianni is determined that, come the final on 18 December, as he ring-kisses the Emir of Qatar before handing over the trophy, football will be all that bloody matters. Helping him do so, the local authorities have engaged a crack team of influencers, including a number of England and Wales fans, 40 each at the latest count, who will be given free travel to Qatar as \u201cambassadors for the tournament\u201d. And as \u201cfan leaders\u201d, they will appear in the TV coverage of the opening ceremony. \u201cBe ready in your shirt, flags and scarves to cheer and shout,\u201d roars the shills\u2019 instruction booklet. Further duties reportedly include being asked to \u201clike\u201d and \u201cre-share third-party posts\u201d, and flag social media content that is critical of the HRWC. Most cunning, save for the problem that among England\u2019s \u201cfan leaders\u201d is a John Hemmingham, leader of the self-appointed, atonal crime against musicianship that is the \u201cEngland Band\u201d, a group so unpopular they would be eating crocodile members nightly in the jungle even if they were up against Matt Hanc0ck. Really good luck with that one. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cIt is the time to bring this journey to an end. I\u2019ve always said that there will not be any other team after Bar\u00e7a. This Saturday\u2019s game [against Almer\u00eda] will be my last\u201d \u2013 with his team dumped out of Big Cup, Gerard Piqu\u00e9 presumably doesn\u2019t fancy seeing out the remainder of his career with cameos in Big Vase. FIVER LETTERS \u201cI was totally spooked by this monstrosity on a door in a Wembley pub when attending the NFL last week. Paying \u00a38 a pint was scary enough without having to see this \u2026 looks like Dracula or maybe Robbie Savage\u201d \u2013 Mike Turney.  \u201cAh, come on. Does anyone actually believe that the Halland/Haaland thing (yesterday\u2019s Quote of the Day) is an actual issue, and not a Swedish PR person taking the opportunity of a slow news day to make some progress on an admittedly tricky brief? Thank god for transparent chocolate marketing stunts, or we\u2019d not have heard the last of it\u201d \u2013 Jon Millard. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.

                    "body": "1 Fake Qatar fans\nIt is one of the strangest minor stories of the strangest of World Cups. Shortly before the opening game, Qatar versus Ecuador, a group of men in uniform Qatari team-coloured T-shirts emerged en masse into a vacant area behind the goal and started making noise, doing choreographed dances and leaping about with apparently genuine excitement, something they kept up through the game irrespective of what was happening on the pitch.\nAt first it looked like an expert parody, perhaps an arch pastiche on fan culture. But the story of the bolt-on ultras was also authentically Qatari, in a land where everything is traded as a commodity from human labour to staged human joy.\nIt turned out this group of around 1,500 young (male) Lebanese, Egyptian and Algerian football supporters had been offered free flights, accommodation, match tickets and a daily allowance to pretend to support Qatar. They came in mid-October to write and rehearse their songs and dances. And now here they were, synthesising excitement at a game where half the spectators left before the end.\n\n\nOn the face of it this looks like an open-and-shut outrage against the idea of authentic fan culture. But as ever there are sides. First, these were genuine football fans of Middle Eastern clubs, delighted to be doing something they never could have afforded otherwise. The faux-Qataris were proud to support a team \u201cfrom the region\u201d and saw a kind of pan-Arab solidarity in the show of support. \u201cWe share the same language. We share the same culture, we are fingers from the same hand,\u201d one of them said, and it sounded fair enough. Fake real fans doing something real-fake, to create something oddly real. Welcome to Qatar 2022.\n2 Green Carpet\nThe green carpet was laid out around dingy concrete stadium walkways, with the intention of simulating a pastoral sporting parade for photo opportunities. Managers and players were required to walk down the green carpet, thereby creating a staged \u201csports\u2011style\u201d scene, like the pictures of footballers and cricketers before fast shutter speeds where players would stand frozen in action poses while a Brylcreemed man called Snapper Wilkins clanked a massive flash bulb in their faces.\n\nAnd grass is a tricky thing in Qatar generally. You must have grass. Grass is football. But grass is also not meant to be here. Pitches are watered and tended constantly at vast carbon cost. The landscaped Al Bidda park has lavish lawns manicured by a team of turf stylists, but this stuff has no life in it, no insects or worms, nothing but sand and glue. Twenty miles outside Doha, rising up out of the desert, Al Bayt Stadium has a wonderful rolling lawn around its southern end, a needless human engineering miracle, an Astroturfing scheme for the sake of an Astroturfing scheme. We have all walked the green carpet at this World Cup.\n3 Beckham\nDavid Beckham\u2019s image is constantly present in Qatar, as though he is now the national mascot, or perhaps a thrusting junior emir. But for all his visibility he remains mute and distant, a flattened image. It suits him. In many ways promoting a World Cup he initially expressed deep (generic) suspicions over is the perfect Beckham moment, an act that has reduced him to his essence, an empty corporate power image, a flattened face for hire.\n\nEvery man has his price, and Beckham\u2019s soul is at least reassuringly expensive. And this image is great because in it Beckham has finally become a logo. He is now a chin, a hairline, a sculpted beard, a baseline of pixelated symmetry. The other great thing about this new, improved Beckham is he could also be any nationality, a deracinated corporate swoosh.\n\nPrivately Beckham is said to be furious about the backlash for abandoning his previous set of principles in order to promote Qatar. He would prefer people used the word \u201cengagement\u201d instead, which is a more comforting word. His argument is, apparently, that nobody complained when he played for Paris Saint-Germain, a wonderful piece of dead\u2011end logic, and another convincing argument for remaining an icon, a logo, a jawline, or anything else that doesn\u2019t involve expressing thoughts.\nAndy Warhol would probably have done this to Beckham, unlocked the raw power of his inner inanity. Qatar has done it beautifully.\n4 Fake Venice shopping centre\nThe motorised gondolas at the Villaggio Mall, a Qatari classic. This is a place that loves a bit of urban mimesis. Doha and its surrounds also have a fake Place Vend\u00f4me, a fake Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, even a fake Hackney in the guise of Stadium 974, with its billionaire-hipster aesthetic, the pretence of being built out of glossily reclaimed shipping containers.\n\nIt isn\u2019t hard to see why. Doha is built on a plateau of desert scrub. There are no features. So why not borrow some. The fake Venice shopping centre is almost old brand-new Doha by now. It has painted ceilings and piped soothing music. It has a weirdly draining quality. It is also based on a fitting model. Venice is one of those cities that flourished and was then left behind, preserved in its splendour as a snapshot in time. Qatar\u2019s entire nation-building project is about cashing in its own moment of peak wealth, making it permanent, fixed, carbon-proofed. And like Venice, Qatar is also now at the mercy of climate change. So, a nice twin doom-laden energy there. Oh well. Have a motorised gondola ride to nowhere.\n5 Photo frame at Lusail\n\nThe lit posing frame at Lusail, a staged moment at a stage-set World Cup. Step inside the square and bathe in the light of Lusail, the world\u2019s most startling future-city. Lusail is still more a concept than an actual city, conceived as an ark in the desert for the super-rich, and venue also for the World Cup final. Walking around this place is exhausting, an assault on the senses via constant piped music, scrolling lights, massive video screens. But it is also beautiful, so new, so empty, a hypothetical city for a hypothetical people, and the final level at this World Cup of painted backdrops.\n6 Goal actualisations\n\nGoal actualisations: why? In whose fevered imagination did it seem like a good idea to replay, in weird, faceless cartoon form on vast scrolling screens, the action that your live audience has just seen in the flesh? This is a Lionel Messi goal actualisation. In all there have been more than 800 goal actualisations during the football actualisation at the Qatar World Cup tournament actualisation. A Gianni Infantino actualisation has already sat centre stage at the Virtual Stadium and hailed this World Cup as the greatest actualisation of all time. Probably Qatar is just ahead of time as usual. Actualisation feels like the future. So clean, so natural, no armbands, no ragged human edges.\n7 Pre-match show\n\n\nWhat do you need for a World Cup? You need light, noise, an iconography of World Cup-dom. You need to block out the sky with drones and fire and empty colour. Qatar\u2019s pre-match displays have been uniform and relentless, like watching a robot express excitement on an endless loop. There is nothing new about this. All tournaments do it. Qatar\u2019s achievement has been to synthesise the loudest tournament excitement of all time, and to do it over the top of often silent stadiums. Here some volunteers shake a flag while the inflatable World Cop appears to explode into flames and history\u2019s most brain-manglingly loud PA screams in boilerplate excitement. Never has kick-off felt like such a relief in any sporting event. Finally some peace and quiet. Perhaps Qatar can now pack all of this generic white noise away and simply wheel it out again for the inevitable Olympics."

The move by Transport for London (TfL) is understood to be linked to concerns about the World Cup hosts\u2019 human rights record, stance on homosexuality and treatment of migrant workers. A person involved in the Qatari review of London investments told the Financial Times that TfL, which is chaired by the city\u2019s mayor, Sadiq Khan, contacted Q22, the body overseeing the World Cup, and Qatar\u2019s tourism authority this week to inform them about the ban. In response, Qatar was \u201creviewing their current and future investments\u201d in London and was \u201cconsidering investment opportunities in other UK cities and home nations\u201d, the person involved in the review told the newspaper. The source added that the TfL ban \u201chas been interpreted as a message from the mayor\u2019s office that Qatari business is not welcome in London\u201d. The Gulf state has become one of biggest investors in London through its sovereign wealth fund. Earlier this month, the Observer reported that the state of Qatar alone, not counting individual royals\u2019 personal holdings, is the 10th largest landowner in the UK, according to analysts at MSCI Real Assets. The emirate owns nearly 2.1m sq metres (23m sqft) of property in Britain. Among the properties in the portfolio of the Qatar Investment Authority are department store Harrods in Knightsbridge; Britain\u2019s tallest building, the Shard, which was built with nearly \u00a32bn of Qatari investment; Forbes House mansion; Chelsea Barracks; and the Savoy and Grosvenor House hotels. It is also a co-owner of Canary Wharf and has a 20% stake in Heathrow airport. In May, the Gulf state pledged to invest \u00a310bn over five years in the UK including in the technology, healthcare, infrastructure and clean energy sectors. A spokesperson for Khan told the FT the mayor was not involved in day-to-day decisions regarding advertising on the city\u2019s transport network. A TfL spokesperson said it had provided \u201cadvertising partners and brands with further guidance\u201d on acceptable advertising during the World Cup."

                    "body": "The UK was plotting for the Iranian national football team to defect on the pitch at the World Cup in Qatar, the minister of sport and youth has told the Iranian parliament, without providing any evidence. The sports minister, Hamid Sajjadi, told MPs the country\u2019s enemies had attempted \u201cthe height of sedition\u201d. He said the \u201cOld Fox\u201d, by which he meant the UK, had planned for Iran\u2019s players to walk off the pitch at specified moments and seek to defect. Sajjadi claimed the Iranian authorities had foiled the plot. He was willing to substantiate his claims in a private session, in what appears to have been part of a failed attempt to stave off an MPs\u2019 vote of censure for the state of the national game, after the team was knocked out of the World Cup at the group stage. Many prominent Iranian footballers have been subjected to harassment by state security services for supporting the protests that have swept the country, but this was the first time a minister claimed there was a plot to subvert the Islamic Republic on the pitch at the tournament. His remarks came as an Iranian chess player, Sara Khadem, arrived in Spain on Tuesday after receiving what a source close to her said were warnings not to return to Iran after competing without a hijab at an international tournament in Kazakhstan. Khadem, born in 1997, took part in last week\u2019s FIDE World Rapid and Blitz Chess Championships, in Almaty, Kazakhstan, without wearing a hijab, the mandatory headscarf under Iran\u2019s dress codes. The source, who did not want to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter, said Khadem subsequently received multiple phone calls in which individuals warned her against returning home after the tournament, while others said she should go back, promising to \u201csolve her problem\u201d. The sports minister\u2019s claims, for which there is no evidence, underline the atmosphere of paranoia that surrounded the men\u2019s national team at the World Cup as many of the players struggled with conflicting pressures from protesters and officials. The claims did not stop him from being censured by the parliament, which accused of him of allowing foreign-based players and coaches to be given massive salaries. Over the past three months a number of Iranian footballers have been publicly threatened and harassed by the authorities. The former Iran national captain Ali Karimi was forced to flee the country after he expressed support for the protesters on social media, and all his properties and assets in Iran were confiscated by the order of the judiciary. The football manager Ali Daei has also been banned from leaving Iran."

                    "body": "A Birmingham family have revealed the distress they have endured in a six-year legal battle in Qatar to gain compensation for the severe injuries experienced by their youngest daughter when they lived in the Gulf state. Elizabeth Soffe, now eight, received life-threatening burns as a baby in a fire at her family\u2019s villa in Al Waab, near the country\u2019s capital, Doha, in 2014. Her parents, Liam and Sinead Soffe, have been pursuing legal action in the Qatari courts since 2017 against the company that owned and managed the property. The couple, who are Irish citizens but now live in Birmingham, near the hospital that has treated Elizabeth, are seeking compensation to cover the cost of their daughter\u2019s treatment to date and her future care needs.  Elizabeth was left with third-degree burns to more than 60% of her body and lost most of her fingers and her hair, part of her nose and an ear, and will need many more operations throughout her life. She also needs regular physiotherapy to ease the movement of her neck, elbows, wrists and other joints, which is restricted due to scarring. A Qatari court-appointed fire expert determined that the fire was caused by inadequate maintenance of an air conditioning unit in the property by Al Asmakh Real Estate Development, or by the unit being connected to a poor electrical supply. Her parents initially tried to reach an informal settlement with the company. But despite the assistance of the Irish government, no settlement was forthcoming after more than two years, so the family initiated legal proceedings against the firm in Qatar in January 2017. The family hoped their fight was over last year when Qatar\u2019s court of the first instance ruled that Al Asmakh Real Estate Development and its insurers Sukoon Insurance should pay nearly 15m Qatari riyals (\u00a33.4m) in compensation. The amount covered Elizabeth\u2019s existing treatment and future treatment, as well as the family\u2019s possessions lost in the fire. But the Qatari property firm successfully appealed against the ruling and got the case transferred to a lower court, the rental disputes settlement committee, which in October ruled that the firm should pay almost \u00a31.6m. This amount does not cover any future treatment needed by Elizabeth. \u201cThey rejected [costs for] all future treatment \u2013 operations and prosthetics \u2013 because nothing was scheduled,\u201d said Liam Soffe, a civil engineer who was a project manager on infrastructure for the World Cup. \u201cShe has had 70-80 operations on the NHS, and she will probably need at least another two operations every year until she\u2019s an adult. She\u2019ll need prosthetics for the front of her nose and one of her ears, and her medical team are talking about taking one of her toes to make a thumb for one of her hands. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent about \u00a325,000 on court fees so far. UK solicitors we\u2019ve asked all agree that if the case was heard here, the compensation would be between \u00a38m and \u00a310m. [In Qatar] there\u2019s almost no consideration of what we would consider pain and suffering \u2013 for mental health and trauma. All we want is for Elizabeth to be taken care of, so that she has a life and opportunities.\u201d Both the Soffes and the property firm have appealed against the latest ruling, with further hearings scheduled for February. Liam Soffe said the whole family, including Elizabeth\u2019s three older siblings, had been affected by the ordeal. \u201cIt\u2019s been constant mental anguish from having no closure. Every day you have to worry about the court case, but also about Elizabeth\u2019s future and whether you\u2019ll be able to look after her. We\u2019ve got to look her in the eye when she gets older and make sure she understands we did everything we could.\u201d Despite the situation, Soffe said Elizabeth had endeavoured to lead a full life and she enjoys swimming, gymnastics, dancing and trampolining. Last year, to raise money so that Birmingham children\u2019s hospital could buy a laser machine that breaks up scar tissue, she ran a mile a day for 26 days, raising \u00a3202,000. In October, she received a Pride of Britain award in recognition of her courage. Her father said: \u201cElizabeth has a survivor mentality. That\u2019s what\u2019s going to get her through life. But she\u2019s going to need an awful lot of help.\u201d Simon O\u2019Loughlin, an associate solicitor at Irwin Mitchell, which has advised the Soffe family, said: \u201cLiam and Sinead have gone through every parent\u2019s worst nightmare. They continue to fight to ensure Elizabeth secures the compensation to give her access to the rehabilitation and treatment she will need for the rest of her life.\u201d Al Asmakh Real Estate and Sukoon Insurance have been approached for comment. A spokesperson for Ireland\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs said: \u201cThe family\u2019s concerns have been raised with the Qatari authorities, including recently.\u201d"

                    "body": "The European parliament has voted to strip a Greek MEP implicated in a bribery and corruption scandal of her role as one of the body\u2019s vice-presidents.\nMEPs voted by 625 votes to one, with two abstentions, to remove Eva Kaili as one of the parliament\u2019s 14 vice-presidents, following a decision in favour of the move by the assembly\u2019s senior leaders.\n\u201cThe group chairs in the European parliament unanimously voted for the removal of vice-president Kaili\u201d tweeted the German MEP Terry Reintke, co-president of the Green group, before the vote. \u201cWe also agreed to a full inquiry into the matter and taking further preventative measures.\u201d \nThe European parliament has been rocked by the biggest scandal in its history after Belgian prosecutors announced they had charged four people with corruption, money laundering and participation in a criminal organisation, as part of an investigation into attempts by a Gulf state, named by Belgian media as Qatar, to buy influence in the assembly.\nSince Friday, police have raided European parliament offices and 19 private homes, finding data and hundreds of thousands of euros in cash.\n\nKaili is one of four people charged, although she has not been officially named. She has been remanded in custody and will be brought before a judge on Wednesday.\nBreaking Kaili\u2019s silence on Tuesday, her lawyer said she was innocent. \u201cHer position is she is innocent. She has nothing to do with Qatar\u2019s bribes,\u201d her lawyer, Michalis Dimitrakopoulos, told the Greek television channel Open TV.\nPolice seized computers, mobile phones and \u20ac600,000 (\u00a3515,000) in cash at one home, as well as \u20ac150,000 in a flat belonging to an MEP and \u201cseveral hundred thousand euros\u201d from a Brussels hotel room, according to the public prosecutor.\nAsked if any cash was found at Kaili\u2019s home, Dimitrakopoulos said: \u201cI am not confirming or denying. There is confidentiality. I have no idea if money was found or how much was found.\u201d\nKaili has been expelled from the European parliament\u2019s Socialists and Democrats group and Greece\u2019s Pasok party, and Greek authorities have frozen her assets.\nAn MEP from Cyprus\u2019s governing Disy party has claimed that Kaili approached him to amend a highly critical European parliamentary report on LGBTQ and other human rights in Qatar.\n\u201cThis can happen among colleagues,\u201d Loucas Fourlas told Sigma TV. \u201cBut when I saw the amendments concerned Qatar I got a flea in my ear and called the general director at the foreign ministry and told him as Cyprus we shouldn\u2019t get involved. The amendment said Qatar wasn\u2019t so strict on human rights and homosexuality [...] things that would have watered down the report.\u201d\nMEPs have postponed a vote on granting Qatari citizens visa-free travel rights to the EU, which was scheduled to have taken place this week. \u200b\u200b\n\u201cWe must ensure that this process has not been influenced by corruption,\u201d said the German Green MEP Erik Marquardt, who is in charge of the file, which also affects Kuwait, Oman and Ecuador.\n\u201cWe also have to make sure that any attempt to attack our democracy has consequences. For now, we will not proceed towards visa liberalisation for Qatar.\u201d\nSeparately, the Spanish liberal MEP Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Bauz\u00e1 announced he was suspending the EU-Qatar friendship group. Such friendship groups have no official status and, according to the European parliament\u2019s website, are \u201csometimes sponsored by lobbyists and foreign governments\u201d. \nQatar has denied any wrongdoing.\nEU leaders are expected to discuss the scandal when they meet the European parliament president, Roberta Metsola, on Thursday at a regular summit in Brussels. The president of the EU executive, Ursula von der Leyen, has said the allegations were of \u201cutmost concern\u201d and promised to act on a 2019 promise to set up an independent ethics body for all EU institutions.\nThe Guardian also understands that at least four MEPs from the Socialists and Democrats group employing parliamentary assistants who are subject to the Belgian police investigation have stood down from roles in the parliament while the inquiry is ongoing, at the request of the group.\nThe anti-corruption NGO Transparency International said the affair appeared to be \u201ca bribery and corruption scandal of epic proportions\u201d that demanded \u201croot and branch reform of the EU institutions\u2019 ethics and integrity systems\u201d."

                    "body": "Pervis Estupi\u00f1\u00e1n smiles ruefully as he proves those who fall just short cherish their own versions of history. He was only eight and watching at home on Ecuador\u2019s north coast when Carlos Tenorio, given an early chance, hit the England crossbar from close range via the shin of a desperate Ashley Cole.\n\u201cA really painful chance,\u201d he calls his first World Cup memory, which ended with Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson\u2019s side reaching the 2006 last eight in ultimate comfort. \u201cBecause of that we couldn\u2019t make the quarters but the whole country felt proud because the team had given everything.\u201d\nA rematch in early December is not unrealistic given first- and second-place teams from both sides\u2019 groups will then face second and first respectively in the other pool respectively. More remarkable is the fact Estupi\u00f1\u00e1n is sitting next to two of his international teammates on a sofa at Brighton\u2019s training ground and that all of them should be involved when Ecuador open this winter\u2019s tournament against the hosts, Qatar, in Al Khor on Sunday.\n\nIf La Tri fare well in Qatar there is a high chance any success can at least partly be traced back here: not just to the affable Estupi\u00f1\u00e1n, a left-back who has impressed since joining from Villarreal in August, but through to the younger pair who blazed such an unlikely trail to the south coast.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think I would be sharing a dressing room here with Ecuadorians,\u201d says Mois\u00e9s Caicedo, the softly spoken midfielder who started the mini-influx in February 2021. Caicedo turned 21 earlier this month and has become a fixture in Roberto De Zerbi\u2019s side: for Ecuador he is already the heartbeat, the brain and legs in the engine room, a player tipped for football\u2019s summit who carries the hopes of a youthful, savvy national side.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re one of the youngest teams at the World Cup but we\u2019re convinced we have the ability and the talent in every player,\u201d Caicedo says. \u201cWe believe that, with this quality and effort, it\u2019s enough for us to be able to show the world we\u2019re a very strong team too.\u201d\nTo his right sits Jeremy Sarmiento, who speaks fluent English with a faint London inflection. Sarmiento was born in Madrid to Ecuadorian parents who relocated to England when he was seven; he spent nine years at Charlton\u2019s academy and three with Benfica before Brighton called last July. He has started only one Premier League game but anybody who saw him glide through Arsenal\u2019s defence in this month\u2019s Carabao Cup win will feel well apprised of the forward\u2019s gifts. Sarmiento has won nine caps for Ecuador but represented England up to under-18 level.\n\u201cIt was a process of the heart rather than the head,\u201d he says. \u201cMy parents have made so many sacrifices to help me get where I am now, so I just wanted to pay them back with something they\u2019d be happy with. The switch wasn\u2019t easy but I feel in my blood that I\u2019m Ecuadorian and the support I get over there made it a lot easier.\u201d\nEcuadorians have taken Sarmiento into their hearts and they have also embraced the Seagulls. For many Manchester United remain a first love after the trailblazing success of Antonio Valencia but the south coast club are stealing some of those affections. \u201cLots of people wear the Brighton shirt,\u201d Caicedo says. \u201cThe time difference is crazy but people back home get up at 5am, 6am to watch our games and it means a lot,\u201d Sarmiento adds.\n\nOn his arrival Estupi\u00f1\u00e1n, who spent four years within the Pozzo model at Watford but was loaned out for the entirety, completed a group that has quickly become tight-knit. Neither he nor Caicedo speak English confidently, so Sarmiento doubles as interpreter and social coordinator; there is a South American restaurant nearby, although no tangible Ecuadorian community. They are hardly a discrete unit within the squad but their togetherness has obvious benefits. \u201cThere\u2019s the pride you feel to have a compatriot on the pitch with you,\u201d Estupi\u00f1\u00e1n says. \u201cYou know they\u2019ll be there to support you if things aren\u2019t going well and you know you\u2019ll be there to support them in a game too.\u201d\nCaicedo was 19 when he joined directly from Independiente del Valle, who won the Ecuadorian title last year. The culture shock was extreme and perhaps it is no coincidence that, with two fellow countrymen alongside him, his fortunes have skyrocketed. \u201cWhen I came here I wanted training to end and get home because I didn\u2019t have that communication,\u201d he says. \u201cSince they have come it feels like I have found my refuge. I have someone to talk to and it\u2019s given me so much: with them I\u2019ve felt at home.\u201d\n\nAt 24, Estupi\u00f1\u00e1n is seen by his two peers as a guiding hand. He is hardly a conventional veteran but, in a national team whose average age exceeds those of only Ghana and USA, has similar importance for Gustavo Alfaro\u2019s side. Ecuador have flown beneath most radars outside South America: in a punchy Group A there has been more focus on Senegal, the African champions, as a contender for qualification alongside the Netherlands.\nThat belies the fact Ecuador are formidably tough to beat. They have lost only one of their last 15, no mean feat given many of those assignments came in the enervating Conmebol World Cup qualifying competition. Their last six friendlies have brought four goalless draws and two 1-0 wins, which does not promise a thrill a minute but suggests a surprisingly gnarled, durable side that may serve them admirably when the games come thick and fast.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new generation with a real desire to grow,\u201d Estupi\u00f1\u00e1n says. \u201cIt\u2019s meant that we face every opponent without really feeling conscious that we\u2019re playing against top players. We don\u2019t focus on them and there\u2019s a happiness in that: we enjoy ourselves on the pitch and it\u2019s allowed us to get good results against big teams.\u201d\nWhen Sarmiento made his debut against Bolivia in October 2021 it felt light years from the manicured, deliberate process through which young England players are guided. His first start, against Venezuela a month later, was played in Quito at an altitude of 2,850m above sea level and meant senior international football required adaptation on several levels.\n\u201cAt first it was crazy for me, I felt out of air every time and it was a real struggle,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you get used to it as you play more games. In terms of style, over there the pace of the ball is a lot slower but there\u2019s a lot more aggression, like you see all over South America.\u201d\n\nAll three cite Valencia as their role model: the player who won 99 caps and showed, by progressing from playing barefoot near the Amazon rainforest to spending a decade at Old Trafford, that difficult upbringings in Ecuador need present no obstacle to the top. \u201cHe opened up doors and made people believe it\u2019s not impossible to make it out of Ecuador,\u201d Sarmiento says. \u201cWe\u2019re following his path and opening a new path for the others who follow us,\u201d agrees Caicedo.\nThe next steps will be taken at Al Bayt stadium; Ecuador may not be the story when they step out to face the hosts Qatar on a footballing fever dream of an evening that has been 12 years in the making, but that does not bother them. The shadows of Cole\u2019s last-ditch lunge may rear up but, with a little help from the spirit honed in Sussex, they believe new frontiers are in sight this time.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of my dreams,\u201d Estupi\u00f1\u00e1n says. \u201cWe\u2019re not scared of anyone,\u201d adds Sarmiento. \u201cWe\u2019ll go out and play the style of football we\u2019re used to. We\u2019re working towards our best tournament and I feel we can get far.\u201d"

                    "body": "Good morning. The justice department will ask a court today to void the special master review examining documents seized from Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago residence and make the materials available to the criminal investigation surrounding the former president. The hearing is particularly consequential for Trump: should he lose, it could mark the end of the special master process on which he has relied to delay, and gain more insight into, the investigation surrounding his potential mishandling of national security information. In a 40-page brief filed in advance of an expedited afternoon hearing in the 11th circuit court of appeals, the department argued that Trump should never have been able to get an independent arbiter because the federal judge who granted the request misapplied a four-part legal test in making her judgment. The department also argued that the 11th circuit should terminate the injunction preventing federal investigators from examining the documents in the special master review, since Trump appeared to drop his claims that some of the materials are subject to privilege protections.  What did justice department say in its briefing? \u201cAbsent any likelihood of any success in the merits of the claim, there is no justification for an injunction,\u201d the department wrote, as it sought the appeals court to reverse the entirety of the Trump-appointed US district court judge Aileen Cannon\u2019s special master order.  Colorado Springs shooting: suspect faces murder and hate crime charges  The suspect in a weekend gun attack on an LBGTQ+ nightclub in Colorado Springs will face five murder charges, and five additional hate crime counts of causing injury with \u201cbias motivation\u201d, preliminary records released on Monday afternoon show. The details came as police updated the number of injured in the Saturday night rampage at Club Q to 18, and said the alleged shooter, 22-year-old Anderson Lee Aldrich, remained in custody at a local hospital. Officials said it was likely he would be discharged from hospital in the next couple of days and would then make a first court appearance on video. Earlier, the mayor of Colorado Springs, John Suthers, said the attack had \u201cthe trappings of a hate crime\u201d, and spoke of the \u201ctragic darkness\u201d that had descended on the community. \u201cThe actions of this single individual, whatever his motivations, don\u2019t reflect the city of Colorado Springs,\u201d Suthers told ABC\u2019s Good Morning America.  What do we know about the victims? Among the victims were two bartenders, a trans woman, a mother to an 11-year-old and a young graduate. The Colorado Springs shooter had allegedly threatened his mother with a bomb. Why could he still get a gun? There\u2019s no public record that prosecutors sought any felony kidnapping and menacing charges against Aldrich, or that police or relatives tried to trigger Colorado\u2019s red flag law that would have allowed authorities to seize the weapons. Questions are being asked about why.  Indonesia earthquake: rescuers search for survivors as death toll rises to 252  Indonesian rescue workers were racing to reach people still trapped in rubble one day after an earthquake struck the main island of Java, as the death toll rose to 252. Monday afternoon\u2019s quake, centred in the Cianjur region of West Java province, struck at a depth of 6.2 miles (10km), triggering landslides and damaging buildings, including thousands of homes. The number of people killed is unclear. In an Instagram post on Tuesday the local government said 252 people were confirmed dead, with 31 missing, 377 injured and 7,060 displaced. Ridwan Kamil, the governor of West Java, said most of the dead were children, many of them students taking extra lessons. \u201cSo many incidents occurred at several Islamic schools,\u201d he said. Authorities were operating \u201cunder the assumption that the number of injured and [dead] will rise with time\u201d.  How is the rescue operation going? At least 25 people were still buried under the rubble in Cianjur as darkness fell last night. Efforts to reach victims have been complicated by power failures, damaged roads and more than 80 aftershocks.

In other news \u2026  A manhunt has now been under way for more than a week in a remote college town where a still-unidentified suspect stabbed four University of Idaho students to death in the early hours of 13 November. The lack of clues about the killings is fueling fear and rumors. Ukrainians are likely to live with blackouts at least until the end of March, the head of a major energy provider has said. Half of Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure had been damaged by Russian attacks, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, leaving millions of people without electricity and water as winter sets in. Jay Leno has been discharged from hospital and is \u201clooking forward to spending Thanksgiving with his family\u201d after being treated for serious burns sustained in a recent petrol fire accident. The former host of the Tonight Show was said to be thankful for the care he had received. A career 911 dispatcher and longtime friend of the New York City mayor Eric Adams who rented a room to Adams in her apartment in Brooklyn\u2019s Crown Heights for four years now has one of the highest-paid jobs in city government, records show.  Qatar World Cup \u2013 get daily updates with First Thing  The US played their first match of the Qatar World Cup on Monday against Wales and they started out brilliantly, going 1-0 up. But they faded as the game went on and the game ended 1-1. It was a solid result but on Friday they face England, who looked very strong as they crushed Iran 6-2. The top two from USA\u2019s four-team group qualify for the knockout stages. If Iran looked distracted during their loss to England, they had good reason. The players refused to sing their national anthem before the game in an apparent support of anti-regime protests in their home country. Barney Ronay was at the game and paid tribute to a stand that could have consequences for the players when they return home. Meanwhile, Fifa\u2019s dismal crackdown on anything vaguely LGBTQ+-themed at this World Cup continues (homosexuality is illegal in Qatar). Teams such as England were threatened with discipline if they wore armbands with OneLove written on them, while US soccer journalist Grant Wahl was briefly detained at the USA-Wales match for wearing a shirt with a rainbow logo. Elsewhere at the World Cup:  Two of the favorites enter the fray on Tuesday. Argentina play Saudi Arabia, while the reigning champions, France, face Australia. Both teams should win their openers easily. Timothy Weah, who scored USA\u2019s goal on Monday, comes from soccer royalty. His father, George, was Fifa\u2019s World Player of the Year in 1995, and is now president of Liberia (Timothy was born in New York and spent his early years in Florida). Wondering why the World Cup is taking place in November and December this year? It\u2019s been moved from its usual slot to avoid the baking temperatures that Qatar experiences in June and July.  Don\u2019t miss this: Why sexual health projects should switch the focus to pleasure  After decades of emphasis on STIs, HIV, Aids and unwanted pregnancy, a wave of initiatives around the world are using a more sex-positive narrative. The International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF)\u2019s digital campaign Treasure Your Pleasure has been leading the way. Mahmoud Garga, who ran the campaign, says: \u201cWe talk about sexually transmitted infections, mortality, morbidity. We talk about HIV and unwanted pregnancies. It\u2019s always fear-based. People are always left with guilt and shame and feeling [sex] is something bad they shouldn\u2019t be doing. It\u2019s a taboo. We wanted to shift the narrative and do a sex-positive campaign.\u201d Climate check: US receives stinging criticism at Cop27 despite China\u2019s growing emissions  The US, fresh from reversing its 30 years of opposition to a \u201closs and damage\u201d fund for poorer countries suffering the worst impacts of the climate crisis, has signaled that its longstanding image as global climate villain should now be pinned on a new culprit: China. Following years of tumult in which the US refused to provide anything resembling compensation for climate damages, followed by Donald Trump\u2019s removal of the US from the Paris climate agreement, there was a profound shift at the Cop27 UN talks in Egypt, with Joe Biden\u2019s administration agreeing to the new loss and damage fund. Last Thing: American democracy, Biden\u2019s bad jokes \u2013 and two turkeys  High on the Democrats\u2019 midterm success, the president, who celebrated his 80th birthday on Sunday, presided over the annual pardoning of the Thanksgiving turkeys. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful Thanksgiving tradition here at the White House,\u201d the US\u2019s first octogenarian president said as he welcomed the turkeys Chocolate and Chip on the South Lawn. Noting that Chocolate had won a public poll with Chip as his backup, Biden remarked: \u201cFirst of all, the votes are in. They\u2019ve been counted and verified. There\u2019s no ballot stuffing. There\u2019s no fowl play. The only red wave this season is going to be if a German shepherd, Commander, knocks over the cranberry sauce on our table.\u201d Sign up  First Thing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.

                    "body": "Shortly after midday on 22 November 1963 Aldous Huxley, novelist turned consciousness-expander, was lying in bed dying. And not just dying, but dying on acid. As his wife prepped his final dose of LSD she heard on the radio that something else had happened. John F Kennedy had been shot. This presented a dilemma. Did Huxley really need to be told, that, by the way Aldous, I know you\u2019re dying on acid right now, but one of the most mind-blowing events of the 20th century has also just happened? In the event, Huxley was allowed to drift off, swaddled in his private ecstasies, undisturbed by half-grasped visions of grassy knolls or the Dallas police. And the reason for mentioning this here is that this image has sprung to mind a lot in recent weeks while being entertained and distracted by professional sport; and at the same time half-following the endless scroll of news and counter-news from what we must, out of habit, call the \u201creal world\u201d. There you are quietly deciphering the Cruyff-based iconography of Erling Haaland\u2019s flying volley, and someone keeps tugging at your sleeve saying, you really need to concentrate on the imminent hostile collapse of the established world order. They\u2019re opening \u201cwarmth-hubs\u201d in the north of England for when the gas runs out this winter. But hey, Todd Boehly\u2019s all-star game has DIVIDED football. Can you just keep it down for a bit? We\u2019re trying to die blissfully on acid in here.  In the middle of this there is one topic that keeps cutting across these two worlds; and which has for now been allowed just to sit there, unsolvable, unavoidable and uncomfortably grim. The thing is, we probably do have to think about it now. This week Gareth Southgate announced his squad for England\u2019s final fixtures before Qatar 2022. Last week Liz Truss announced that you will only have to pay \u00a32,500 on your energy bills, while also (follow the ball under the cup) funding this via \u00a3100bn in taxes. This week the French government also capped energy payments and, by extension, payments to Qatar\u2019s gas industry, at a cost of billons to their own public purse. Also this week Qatar opened the magnificent $767m Lusail Stadium, which really is a lot of money, but no biggie because they, and indeed you, have got this covered. Did we mention Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 scored again? Those dots are so connected it almost seems too obvious to draw a line between them. Everyone knows football is in hock to fossil fuels and ambitious nation states. But the war in Ukraine, the loss of Russian energy, the profiteering of Opec+ has put this into brutal focus. To the extent that it is worth taking a moment to consider how that flow of power and money is playing out, with football sat like a cackling Lord Haw-Haw in the middle of it. There is almost a kind of dark Fifa comedy here. A war started by the last World Cup hosts is now filling the coffers of the next World Cup hosts, while generating mind-boggling profits for the latest 2030 bidders and current owners of Newcastle United (a war that involved, needless to say, invading the hosts of Euro 2012. Take that Uefa!). In the middle of which there is a real prospect that two months from now you could be watching the World Cup under a blanket, while a nation that is profiting from you being under a blanket stages its grand spectacular, paid for by you being under a blanket.  Here is a spectacle that is, in the end, being paid for through your excess energy bills, even as the UK goes cap in hand for Qatar\u2019s gas reserves. Let me entertain you. But let me also impoverish you. Watch David Beckham shaking hands with the sheikh. Then go to the food bank. When will this not be OK? Closer to home, as the people of Britain seek relief from fuel poverty this winter, they will at least have the chance to celebrate the football glory paid for by those who benefit directly from this struggle. Menaced by global energy prices? Announce Demb\u00e9l\u00e9! A billion pounds in the window! Just keep looking at the lights. Give me just enough bread and just enough of a circus. Football is of course just a public relations strand here, a noise around the politics driving this dynamic. But shouldn\u2019t we at least be sceptical of that process? Shouldn\u2019t we mention it? Or factor in how we plan to consume it or celebrate the people in charge? And this really is a genuine power-shift. Recently, Saudi Aramco announced what are reportedly the biggest quarterly profits in the history of companies having profits, all of which bodes well, naturally, for Eddie Howe\u2019s complex squad-building needs. Those high prices are a result of the war in Ukraine. Plus, the UK buys most of its gas from Norway. But don\u2019t be fooled by the arms-length commercial relationships. In a market where prices and supply are agreed and inter-related there are only dealers and customers, led by a group at the centre that has complete control over the world\u2019s addiction to carbon. And in the meantime you\u2019re basically paying for this power-play every time you turn the heating on for a treat, paying for Shell\u2019s profits too, for EDF\u2019s profits, for Chris Wood\u2019s wages. This is of course everywhere in football. Chelsea\u2019s new owners have heavy Saudi investment, not connected to the purchase of the club. Abu Dhabi\u2019s national energy company, owned by the same people that own the league champions, has seen profits rocket by 63% during the energy crisis. Meanwhile about 15% of Greater Manchester households are living in fuel poverty, a horrendous state of affairs that will only get worse as the glorious winter of oil-ball closes in. But hey, Haaland looks good. And all the while it\u2019s getting just a little bit colder out there. Some supporters of those clubs will feel attacked by having these relationships pointed out, will call for silence on such issues, because they are complex and uncomfortable and essentially insoluble. Every club is touched by this in some way. No one is clean. All owners are foisted on us, no matter how deep their pockets. Life is hard enough. Sometimes you just need some relief. But it is also important to note this isn\u2019t simply about things like show or reputation management, but about control, resources and hard power. The visible end, the investment in PR through sport, should at least be consumed in full knowledge. Just as when, say, Alan Shearer proclaims that this is all unconditionally good and beneficial, loaning his celebrity glaze to the project, when there is no real analysis of why, just scores and points, then something is missing from the picture."

                    "body": "The Greek MEP at the centre of a corruption scandal engulfing the European parliament will have to wait in prison until next week to find out whether she will be released on bail pending a trial. The Greek Socialist MEP Eva Kaili is one of four suspects arrested last week in connection with a major police investigation into cash for influence involving Qatar\u2019s government. In a statement, Belgium\u2019s public prosecutor said \u201cdefendant EK\u201d had not been present at the hearing, \u201chaving requested a postponement\u201d, and would appear before the judicial chamber on 22 December. However, Kaili\u2019s lawyer, Andre Risopoulos, told AFP that she had not been able to attend court because of a staff strike in the prison where she is being held. Another lawyer for Kaili told the agency she was innocent and denied \u201cfalse rumours\u201d that she had received bribes from Qatar. Michalis Dimitrakopoulos said the MEP \u201cdid not know of the existence\u201d of the cash found at her home. He said that Kaili\u2019s partner, Francesco Giorgi, might have \u201canswers about the existence of this cash\u201d. Giorgi, a parliamentary assistant, has also been arrested and found out on Wednesday he will remain in pre-trial detention. Qatar\u2019s government has denied any wrongdoing. Two suspects, identified as FG and PP, will remain in pre-trial detention, the Belgian prosecutor said, while a third was said to be subject to an electronic tag. The European parliament, currently meeting in Strasbourg, is still reeling from the biggest corruption scandal in its history, while senior politicians have warned that the EU\u2019s credibility is at stake. David McAllister, chair of the European parliament\u2019s foreign affairs committee, told the Guardian he felt anger and fury at the \u201ctotally incredible\u201d situation. \u201cIt is just appalling to see that we have an ongoing police investigation regarding corruption, money laundering and participation in a criminal organisation.\u201d \u201cThis whole story reminds you of a bad Netflix series and it is sad reality,\u201d said McAllister, a centre-right German MEP. On Wednesday Belgian police released photos of neatly stacked bundles of cash worth nearly \u20ac1.5m that had been seized during raids on 20 addresses in Brussels since last Friday.  A Belgian judicial source told Agence France-Presse that \u20ac150,000 was found in Kaili\u2019s flat, \u20ac600,000 in her partner\u2019s home, and \u20ac750,000 in her father\u2019s hotel room. Police have also searched several European parliament offices in order to seize data for their investigation. Several bureaus, including Kaili\u2019s, are now sealed off with police tape. MEPs are expected to vote on Thursday in favour of setting up a special committee to identify problems in the European parliament\u2019s transparency, integrity and anti-corruption rules. The parliament is also considering setting up an inquiry committee to investigate corruption and third countries once the current legal proceedings have concluded. According to McAllister, the parliament will call on the European Commission to issue a long-delayed proposal on an EU-wide ethics body. He added that the parliament would also discuss the \u201cproper regulation and monitoring of the friendship groups\u201d, unofficial bodies that can be sponsored by lobbyists and foreign governments. The European parliament\u2019s Qatar friendship group has been suspended since the scandal broke. MEPs voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday to remove Kaili as one of the European parliament\u2019s 14 vice-presidents. The former television presenter has also been expelled from the parliament\u2019s Socialists and Democrats group and Greece\u2019s Pasok party, while Greek authorities have frozen her assets. European leaders are expected to discuss the scandal on Thursday, when they hold a regular meeting with the European parliament president, Roberta Metsola, at an EU summit."

Varane will be out at least until the start of the tournament that begins on 20 November, leaving Maguire to compete with Victor Lindel\u00f6f for a place alongside Lisandro Mart\u00ednez in the centre of the United defence. Maguire has not played since sustaining a thigh injury in England\u2019s draw with Germany in September and had previously lost his United place, with Erik ten Hag preferring to pair Varane with Mart\u00ednez.  Maguire is back in full training and available for Thursday\u2019s penultimate Europa League group game against Sheriff at Old Trafford. United need to avoid defeat to qualify for the knockout stages. Ten Hag said: \u201cHe always has an important role. He was injured and is happy he is back and now he has to get back into games. It\u2019s always about performance. Regarding his qualities \u2013 no problem. He is a great player and has great capabilities to do a job for us.\u201d The manager was asked whether Maguire\u2019s need for matches before the World Cup in Qatar would influence his thinking. \u201cI understand the interest but we especially look at Manchester United. We have to get the right results and performances,\u201d he said. Varane may recover and be available for France\u2019s defence of the World Cup. \u201cI think so but we have to wait and see how it develops, how his rehab develops,\u201d said Ten Hag. \u201cHe will certainly be out until the World Cup.\u201d Cristiano Ronaldo is back in the squad after a one-game suspension for refusing to come on during last week\u2019s win over Tottenham and exiting down the Old Trafford tunnel before the final whistle. \u201cI think we said everything and we answered all the questions,\u201d Ten Hag said.\u201d With Anthony Martial still injured, Ronaldo may start. Ten Hag was asked whether he had money to strengthen in January. \u201cIn the background we always continue a process and you see and examine how you can improve and that\u2019s what we will do,\u201d he said. Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Donny van de Beek have also returned to full training after injury."

                    "body": "Art People stream out of every corner of a smoky city in Going to the Match, a 1953 painting by the renowned master of matchstick figures LS Lowry. Everyone seems compelled by a magnetic attraction, approaching the football ground as if it contains the holy grail or a UFO. And Lowry shows us why this game looms so large in their lives. What else have they got? Grey chimneys hang in the milky air above a landscape of dreary toil. The dearth of colour is shocking. But the crowd are all individuals: women and men, workers and clerks, all inspired by the common passion that turns a Saturday afternoon into a supercharged special time. This is why football became the people\u2019s sport. Jonathan Jones * * * Television  Much has, and will, be written concerning Qatar\u2019s human rights record, particularly in terms of the freedoms of LGBTQ+ people and their treatment by the state. For that reason, a look back at Britain\u2019s own complicated relationship with football and homophobia feels timely \u2013 and the 2017 documentary, Forbidden Games: The Justin Fashanu Story, shines a spotlight on the first man to publicly weather the storm of it all. A remarkable patchwork of Black footballing history, political gossip and transracial adoption, this film will make you mourn Britain\u2019s first \u00a31m Black footballer, who died aged just 37. Jason Okundaye * * * Music  For somebody who isn\u2019t overly fussed about football, a World Cup is much more about feeling and atmosphere than it is about genuinely rooting for any one team. Nonetheless, when I think of the beautiful game, my mind instantly goes to the 2002 JXL remix of the Elvis classic A Little Less Conversation. For ever synonymous with Nike\u2019s big-budget \u201csecret tournament\u201d advert, the song is as light and nimble on its feet as the endless big-name stars the ad showcased, uniting pitch and dancefloor in giddy, sweaty euphorics. It\u2019s a formative World Cup memory for millennials \u2013 I\u2019d take it over World in Motion or Sweet Caroline any day. Jenessa Williams * * * Film  Corneliu Porumboiu\u2019s delightfully deadpan film Infinite Football understands that the beautiful game is about more than the movement of a ball across a field. Ironically, however, this fact has eluded its amusingly sadsack star, Laurentiu Ginghin\u0103. A mid-level Romanian bureaucrat, he spends his spare time frowning owlishly at a whiteboard on which he outlines ever more hilariously impractical ways to reform the sport, from octagonal pitches to seven-player teams to the construction of a wall on the halfway line. But the profound truth at work here is not that football is a matter of life or death, it\u2019s that life and death are a matter of football: when Ginghin\u0103 dreams, in increasingly erratic, unenforceable ways, about \u201cperfecting\u201d the game, really he\u2019s dreaming about perfecting the world. Jessica Kiang * * * Book  In 1974, the great manager Brian Clough lasted just 44 days in charge at Leeds United (even fewer than Liz Truss had as prime minister). Even so, the repercussions of his short tenure have been felt ever since. Not least because the author David Peace immortalised this brutal chapter in footballing history so well in The Damned Utd. His novel takes us deep inside the head of \u201cthe boss\u201d as he berates his own players for their thuggish, cheating ways. Those players (understandably enough) revolt against him and the hitherto all-conquering Leeds race down the table. The football was disastrous, but the resulting novel is intense, thrilling and unforgettable. Sam Jordison"

Other locals have been seen chanting their support for Argentina and Brazil.\n\nIn a statement the Supreme Committee said it rejected the allegations about fake fans, which they called \u201cdisappointing and unsurprising\u201d.\n\u201cFans from all over the world \u2013 many of whom have made Qatar their home \u2013 have contributed to the local atmosphere recently, organising fan walks and parades throughout the country, and welcoming the various national teams at their hotels,\u201d it said in a statement. \n\n\u201cNumerous journalists and commentators on social media have questioned whether these are \u2018real\u2019 fans.

                    "body": "For Qatar, this was a letdown 12 years in the making. The host nation has spent that time building the infrastructure of a World Cup shrouded in controversy and replete with a bitter taste that, whatever the next four weeks bring, is unlikely ever to be washed away.\nWhen they kicked off this tournament, however, the hope locally was for a bravura show from the meticulously constructed football project that has run concurrently with the creation of a manicured, deeply unsettling fantasy sporting land from sand. Instead they flopped, left for dust by a stronger and cannier Ecuador unit who dealt the hardest of truths about how life at this level really looks.\n\nThe manoeuvres honed by F\u00e9lix S\u00e1nchez\u2019s players across that time were barely evident and it was doubly ignominious that Qatar became the first home side to lose an opening game. No other outcome seemed likely after the moment, three minutes in, when Enner Valencia thought he had silenced the party. The goal was eventually disallowed by VAR for the most borderline of offsides but Qatar\u2019s defence, and especially their goalkeeper Saad al-Sheeb, were clearly ripe to be picked off.\n\nThat impression was quickly justified when Valencia, fouled by Sheeb, converted a penalty. His outstanding header after the half-hour removed any remaining edge and long before the end swathes of this vast, textured tent-like structure north of Doha had virtually emptied. The envisaged extravaganza had not materialised and it would take a vast improvement against Senegal on Friday to give Qatar any chance of progress. Ultimately this was a non-contest, a dissatisfying spectacle and, with due credit to a competent Ecuador, a poor reflection on what should be football\u2019s showpiece.\n\u201cMaybe the responsibility and nerves got the better of us,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said of a pallid display that, given this was billed as the logical apex of a country\u2019s footballing journey, must have felt hugely anticlimactic. \u201cWe had a terrible start and this determines the rest of the match. We\u2019ll just have to forget about the pressure and be more competitive. We can do it.\u201d\n\nAt least the award and dispatching of Valencia\u2019s spot-kick ascribed less importance to the controversy around his disallowed opener. The overrule looked marginal at best and came after Sheeb had flapped under a free-kick, allowing a combination of F\u00e9lix Torres and Michael Estrada to locate Valencia with the custodian stranded. There was widespread confusion when it was chalked off: Fifa\u2019s semi-automated system probably decided Estrada\u2019s foot was beyond Sheeb, with only one defender back, when Torres headed on.\nPerhaps the stars were aligning for Qatar, who would have faced murmurings about injustice had the call decided things. Nobody could accuse their country of failing to produce an off-pitch show. Morgan Freeman had been reeled in to front the high-spec opening ceremony, intoning weighty thoughts about football\u2019s ability to unite, but Ecuador were a class apart in those opening moments. Qatar could neither retain possession nor a sensible measure of concentration.\nThey were behind soon enough when a sluggish Sheeb came out to meet Valencia and clipped him on the shin. A penalty, a booking and no further scope for suggestions of favouritism; Valencia scored coolly and, at that point, Qatar looked vulnerable whenever Ecuador attacked.\nThere was visible frustration in the kick on Valencia for which Almoez Ali was cautioned. Valencia\u2019s revenge was emphatic, finding space between two defenders and leaping thrillingly to plant Angelo Preciado\u2019s cross past Sheeb after persistence from Moises Caicedo. The former West Ham and Everton player, now 33, has still got it.\n\u201cHe was questioned at times but now we see how much he gives us,\u201d the Ecuador manager, Gustavo Alfaro, said of the country\u2019s all-time leading scorer. \u201cIf I have to choose, I always choose Enner Valencia.\u201d Whether he can do that for their next game, against the Netherlands, depends on his recovery from multiple knocks.\n\nSurely Qatar had more to offer. They are the Asian champions and, in what should have proved a useful exercise, did not disgrace themselves when guesting at the Copa Am\u00e9rica three years ago. It was obvious they had frozen on this surprisingly brisk evening; their football was lightweight against technically and physically superior opposition.\nNonetheless Ali, the star of that continental win, headed wide with the first half\u2019s final action. He had been unmarked and perhaps a cleaner contact would have belatedly put Qatar at ease. It might have ignited the contest but, instead, it was virtually the final action of note.\nEcuador could cruise through the second period, occasionally squandering openings on the counter. Romario Ibarra allowed Sheeb slight redemption with a parried shot but little else raised the pulse as the crowd drifted away. \u201cWe hope in the next game people feel prouder,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said. It was the heftiest blow to his adopted nation\u2019s self-esteem."

                    "body": "The big man is back. All two metres of him, hunching slightly to get through the door. Harry Souttar has the spring in his step of somebody who knows they have made it after all. \u201cIt was a long 12 months,\u201d he says.  A lot has happened since November of last year, when the Stoke City centre-half ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament playing a World Cup qualifier against Saudi Arabia. There was a long flight back to the UK before surgery and countless hours of rehab. This June, Australia finally qualified for the World Cup via the playoffs \u2013 a key motivation to fast-track his recovery. In August, he was mourning his older brother, Aaron, a talented golfer who died at 42 after suffering from motor neurone disease. Souttar arrived in Qatar with two new tattoos, both of which encapsulate what he holds dear. \u201cMy brother passed away three and a half months ago, so I\u2019ve got him on my arm just to remind me every day what a brilliant person he was,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I got my cap number and the [Australian] coat of arms on my calf.\u201d Glance down and there it is, inked proof he is Socceroo No 606. Souttar\u2019s timely return is welcome in more ways than one. The 24-year-old is a well-liked member of the playing group, to the point that he was flown into camp before the decisive qualifier against Peru simply to boost morale.  He is also potentially the defensive difference in a tough World Cup group, his quickness of foot and skills on the ball belying the length of his limbs and his calm decision-making an invaluable settling force while facing big opponents such as France. Whether he is thrown straight against the reigning champions or saved for Tunisia and Denmark is unclear, given he only made his senior comeback in the English Championship on 8 November \u2013 one day after he was named in the World Cup squad. \u201cYou have doubts in your head along the way of being a year out,\u201d Souttar says. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously ups and downs, but I don\u2019t think I ever thought I wasn\u2019t going to make it. I always knew, with the hard work I put in to get here, I was going to do it in the end.\u201d It is hardly surprising these days to hear a Scottish accent wearing green and gold, given this team is becoming very much a blend of the two countries. Like attackers Martin Boyle and Jason Cummings, Souttar is Scotland born and bred, growing up in the small eastern village of Luthermuir and starting his professional career at Dundee United alongside his other brother and fellow defender, John. But while John, 26, stayed local, forging a career at Hearts before being capped for Scotland and joining Rangers in the off-season, Souttar moved to central England and found himself the subject of some close monitoring by Socceroos coach Graham Arnold, who knew his mother was born in Australia. He had played for Scotland\u2019s underage sides but not pledged his full international allegiance. Arnold made his move in March 2019, calling him up to his under-23s before handing him a senior debut that October in a World Cup qualifier against Nepal. He scored twice, and by the end of the first phase of qualifying had six goals from his first five games \u2013 as a central defender. He also developed a reputation for prowess on set-pieces \u2013 an unfashionable yet efficient way to win games.  \u201cSet pieces is a massive weapon, and if you\u2019ve got tools to utilise it I think anything would do,\u201d Souttar says. \u201cObviously we\u2019ve got some great deliverers of the ball. Aziz [Behich] is one of them \u2013 he can put it on a sixpence. Obviously I\u2019ve scored against some of the smaller-height nations, so to do it on the big stage would be great.\u201d But not, he says, because he wants to impress future club suitors and reignite the Premier League interest in him before the injury.  \u201cI don\u2019t think you can go into any tournament thinking that. Obviously as a player it\u2019s nice to get praise, but you\u2019re also only one match away from from criticism. So that stuff for me is irrelevant.\u201d While Souttar is not guaranteed to start against France \u2013 likely alongside Kye Rowles \u2013 he appears closer than Boyle (knee) and Ajdin Hrustic (ankle), who are now cutting it fine. That appears especially the case for Boyle, for whom Arnold has already flown in Marco Tilio as cover should he require a injury replacement on the eve of the opening match on Tuesday night (Wednesday 6am AEDT). At training on Saturday night the pair performed light duties on a seperate pitch from the main squad. \u201cI saw Boyley running yesterday just through the window of my room and Ajdin as well,\u201d says striker Jamie Maclaren. \u201dFrom my eyes they looked good but I think the medical staff will make a call whenever they can. \u201cBut they are two huge players for us and exciting players and players that have played a big part in the last four years. And from where I stand now, I think they\u2019ll be okay.\u201d"

                    "body": "With a month to go until the opening match of the World Cup, human rights abuses \u201cpersist on a significant scale\u201d in Qatar, according to Amnesty International. In a final pre-tournament report, Amnesty said progress has been made by the Qatari state on the protections afforded migrant workers. But weak regulations and a lack of enforcement means there is \u201cstill a long way to go\u201d, the organisation says. Amnesty calls for a number of actions, including support from Qatar and Fifa for financial compensation for workers.  \u201cDespite the positive evolution of Qatar\u2019s labour system, substantial work remains to effectively implement and enforce these [changes],\u201d the report says. \u201cUltimately, human rights abuses persist on a significant scale today.\u201d Among its observations, the report finds that workers in security and domestic labour remain particularly vulnerable to exploitation, with some expected to work up to 18 hours a day without a weekly day off. Furthermore, Amnesty argues, there has been insufficient research into the thousands of deaths of those working in construction in the country over the past decade and the contribution played by extreme heat.  The report also finds vestiges of the abolished kafala system in the country and states wages are still commonly withheld from workers. Steve Cockburn, Amnesty\u2019s head of economic and social justice, said: \u201cAlthough Qatar has made important strides on labour rights over the past five years, it\u2019s abundantly clear that there is a great distance still to go. \u201cWith the World Cup looming, the job of protecting migrant workers from exploitation is only half done, while that of compensating those who have suffered abuses has barely started.\u201d \u201cProgress must not grind to a halt once the World Cup roadshow leaves Doha. Turning a blind eye to the abuses suffered by thousands of migrant workers over the years flies in the face of their respective international obligations and responsibilities.\u201d Last month, the English Football Association endorsed a compensation scheme for workers and their families involved in building the World Cup infrastructure in Qatar. They were joined by a number of other associations, with the United States Soccer Federation adding its name this week. Fifa and World Cup organisers, however, have yet to confirm their commitment to such a scheme. Fifa said : \u201cFifa remains in positive ongoing dialogue with the International Labour Organization, the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) and all relevant authorities in Qatar over initiatives that will benefit migrant workers in Qatar long after the final game of the World Cup. Further information will be provided in due course.\u201d The Qatari supreme committee for delivery and legacy said: \u201cThe advancements in workers\u2019 welfare is a legacy we are very proud of, and one that we are already seeing in action. We have always believed that the World Cup will be a catalyst to accelerate positive initiatives, leaving a legacy of meaningful and sustainable progress for the country and region. \u201cOur progress has been recognised by one of the world\u2019s largest trade unions, Building and Wood Workers\u2019 International (BWI), the UN International Labour Organisation (ILO), and we welcome the recognition by Amnesty International, highlighting that our work has \u201cimproved the living and working conditions of thousands of migrant workers\u201d and that it \u201crepresents an unprecedented and significant improvement in the living and working conditions. \u201cWork is ongoing and there is of course still room for improvement. We are continuing to explore alongside key partners the opportunities to enhance the legacy that improves the lives of workers and lays the foundation for fair, sustainable and lasting reforms.\u201d"

                    "body": "And now, finally, some football. For much of the 12 years since Sepp Blatter\u2019s fumbling fingers ripped open an envelope containing one word and a thousand questions, the 2022 World Cup has been able to exist in our minds as little more than a surreal abstraction. A computer-generated simulation. Some Philip K Dick-infused vision of a future that might never come to pass; that could even somehow be averted if we made the right choices. But the time for daydreaming and denial is over. This is happening. Matty Cash is going to Qatar, and to greater or lesser extents, we\u2019re all going with him.\nWhy? How? Why here? Why now? And \u2013 frankly \u2013 what the hell? Just a few of the more intelligible responses to a project that from its grubbily cynical inception has felt like a giant step into a sun-scorched unknown. This is not the first World Cup to be held in the shadow of totalitarianism. It is not the first to be awarded under questionable premises, nor the first to be built at a ruinous expense to the public exchequer and the planet. But in most other respects it is like nothing this sport will ever have seen before.\n\nOf course, you didn\u2019t choose this. Nor did the players or coaches. A winter World Cup in a tiny desert state with no footballing heritage and a litany of human rights abuses to its name was instead imposed upon us by the 22 men of Fifa\u2019s executive committee, three of whom are now dead. There is, perhaps, a certain dark irony in the fact that the survival rate of the people who awarded the World Cup was even lower than that of the people who built it. But the very existence of this tournament is a reminder of where the power has always resided in this sport. You are of course welcome to turn up, tune in and enjoy. But this spectacle is not yours, and never has been.\nSo perhaps the first thing we can do is to shake ourselves free of the idea that anything that happens on the pitch over the next month can ever redeem or mitigate its colossal moral expense. Football loves to spin this self-serving yarn about itself: the notion that whether through noble escapism or shared joy or athletic beauty, it serves in some small way to make the world a better place. But in this case of Qatar 2022, football has made the world measurably and noticeably worse. It has quite literally killed people. How you feel about that is totally up to you. But the very least we owe the victims of this World Cup is our present remembrance and future vigilance.\n\nAlmost inevitably, very little of this human wastage will impinge on the show itself. Those of you watching on television will encounter pretty much the same curated, star-studded, heavily branded, tournament-flavoured substance you know and love. For those involved, Qatar will be experienced in much the same way they experience everywhere else: through the windows of a bus, on a familiar treadmill from hotel room to dressing room via pool and training ground, by the reassuringly stateless whiff of fresh paint on temporary plasterboard. The heat may be a factor. The lack of atmosphere may be a factor. Fatigue and curtailed preparation time will certainly be a factor. So, what sort of tournament can we expect?\nThe temptation is to home in on the stars, to weight our analysis towards the household names. Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and Robert Lewandowski, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, Kevin De Bruyne and Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior, Sadio Man\u00e9 and Gareth Bale. And individual brilliance will certainly have a part to play in this tournament, particularly in the latter stages where the margins are at their finest.\nBut by and large it is cohesive teams rather than great collections of players \u2013 or even great coaches \u2013 who tend to go deep at World Cups: teams with a defined style of play, a collective understanding and a sense of their own momentum. Recall that a ruthlessly drilled Russia and a baggy Brazil both did equally well at the last World Cup; recall too that Croatia did better than both. Star quality can raise expectations and occasionally get you over the line. But it is never sufficient on its own.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting distinction to be made is between those teams with a distinct identity based on possession and high pressing, and those who in tough times will fall back on the classic tournament nostrums of counterattack, set pieces and individual inspiration. In the former group: Hansi Flick\u2019s mercurial Germany, the gilded but largely untested Brazil, Luis Enrique\u2019s exciting Spain, the last gasps of a great Belgium side and the Netherlands under the idiosyncratic tutelage of Louis van Gaal.\nIn the latter group: the quietly fancied Argentina, defending champions France, the talented but limited Portugal and a limping England that appears ripe for another bout of navel-gazing angst culminating in an early exit. Neither approach, by the way, is objectively better than the other. Pragmatism worked for Portugal in 2016 and France in 2018, for Argentina at last year\u2019s Copa Am\u00e9rica and Senegal at this year\u2019s Africa Cup of Nations. Ideology triumphed for Germany in 2014, for Brazil in 2019 and Italy in 2021. Further down the pecking order the relevant divide is between more explosive and direct teams like Canada and Ecuador, or teams like Iran and Costa Rica who will simply sit in and try to limit the damage.\nWales travel to their first World Cup in 64 years with high hopes of upsetting the odds again, even if their deep-lying system seems to invite pressure. Poland, boasting one of the world\u2019s greatest strikers and one of Aston Villa\u2019s best full-backs, have a favourable group as they attempt to reach the knockout stages for the first time since 1986. Switzerland and Serbia would both be highly fancied were they not unfortunate enough to be drawn in the same group as Brazil.\n\nPerhaps the greatest unknown, however, centres on the hosts. Qatar\u2019s squad is entirely domestic-based and has not played a competitive match in a year. But they are perhaps the best-prepared of all the squads this winter, and what they lack in raw talent they will make up in organisation and nationalistic zeal. They may just spring a surprise.\nIn short: we just don\u2019t know. No World Cup has ever taken place under these circumstances, midway through a European domestic season, with a heavy toll of injuries (N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9, Paul Pogba, Diogo Jota, Son Heung-min and Paulo Dybala are among those out or in doubt) and teams that have barely spent any time together in months. \nMaybe anger is the appropriate response here: anger at the lack of compassion or foresight, anger at the way powerful men have simply strong-armed this ruinous tournament into existence. But equally, this thing is also irresistibly enjoyable. The football starts, and everything else stops. There will be upsets, there will be feats of greatness, there will be heartbreak and there will be triumph. To celebrate these things is not to condone them; it\u2019s simply all there is. A non-alcoholic toast, then, to Qatar 2022, and the weirdest, most horrifying good time we\u2019ll ever have."

                    "body": "Seventeen World Cup debutants walk into a bar. They\u2019re all asked for ID, questioned on whether they are grown-up enough to be here. Six of them, after all, only had their first drink in September against New Zealand. Nine have thrown back five or fewer. Now here they all are, in Qatar, seeking a bit of Dutch courage against reigning champions France.\nFor many Australians back home setting their alarms for Wednesday\u2019s early morning kick-off, this 26-man Socceroos squad will feel unfamiliar. Granted, some quarters of the nation still live long in the past, as if they cryogenically froze themselves in 2010 and cannot work out why the so-called golden generation are no longer around.\n\nBut times have changed significantly, and so has the national team. These days those better-known figures such as Mark Schwarzer are asking the questions, sitting with the media and inviting one of those debutants, Kye Rowles, to recount his rapid rise from the Central Coast Mariners to Hearts and the national team.\n\u201cIt\u2019s real but it still feels surreal, if that makes any sense,\u201d the defender tells him. \u201cStill sinking in at the moment. We were in club football on the weekend. It\u2019s just one of those pinch-yourself moments, as you would know. That was my first one. I can\u2019t even explain it. I made my debut in June and now it\u2019s November and it\u2019s had a World Cup. It\u2019s just been so quick, I\u2019m almost lost for words.\u201d\nFor context, Rowles was seven when Schwarzer famously saved two penalties in the 2005 qualifying playoff shootout against Uruguay to help send Australia to a first World Cup in 32 years. Now 24, it remains \u201cpretty much the most iconic football memory in my lifetime\u201d.\n\u201cThat\u2019s really the moment that set off me wanting to get to this moment. It wasn\u2019t as dramatic, but we recreated our own moment as well in June,\u201d he says, referring to Andrew Redmayne\u2019s own penalty heroics in the playoff against Peru.\nAnd this, really, is the point. While expectations for this tournament are realistically humble, this new generation are planting the seedlings of an identity.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s great to see the next generation coming through,\u201d Schwarzer says afterwards. \u201cWhat I actually also am really happy about is we\u2019ve got more and more coming to Europe, because I still believe 100% that that\u2019s the best place for our players. If they really want to progress, and really want the Socceroos to get to the highest possible level we can, we need as many players as possible playing at the best leagues around the world.\u201d\n\nThat is the fruition of four-and-a-half years under coach Graham Arnold, who made the ambitious decision to also manage the Under-23 team so he could oversee young players\u2019 transition to senior international football.\nHe qualified the Olyroos for the Olympics for the first time in 12 years. Eight Under-23 members of that Tokyo 2020 team made the World Cup squad, notable by the absence of some more senior players including Tom Rogic, Adam Taggart and Trent Sainsbury.\n\u201cI do feel, if there is a legacy, it is the young kids coming through,\u201d Arnold said last week. \u201cWhen I took over in 2018 it was an ageing squad, I was thinking, \u2018where am I going to get these players?\u2019 Losing players like Jedinak, Cahill, Milligan and Kruse, where was I going to replace them?\u201d\n\nThe Olympics acted as a springboard, with a dozen of that squad soon earning Socceroos caps and a chunk signing with overseas clubs. The most popular destination has been Scotland, where Rowles, Cameron Devlin and Nathaniel Atkinson now play for Hearts and Keanu Baccus for St Mirren, while older heads Aaron Mooy and Martin Boyle are at Celtic and Hibernian respectively.\n\u201cCredit to all the boys who are here because we worked hard to get to that Olympics, and that gave us the experience of men\u2019s football,\u201d says Baccus. \u201cIt was 23s, but for us it was a big step up from where we were all playing. Most of us were playing in the A-League, so it was a good challenge and good experience for us to go through together. And obviously Arnie there with us, which helped integrate us into the national team.\u201d\nSchwarzer describes club football in Scotland as \u201ca stepping stone\u201d. \u201cSome would say it\u2019s only Scotland, but it\u2019s Europe and it\u2019s on the doorstep,\u201d he says. \u201cThe chance of moving to other European leagues is far greater when you\u2019re in Europe.\u201d\nThe more senior squad members who were at Russia 2018 under Bert van Marwijk already have experience playing two of Australia\u2019s 2022 Group D opponents France and Denmark, to whom they lost 2-1 and drew 1-1, with the less familiar foe of Tunisia sandwiched in between.\n\u201cI remember [France] being a close game and feeling we were a little bit unlucky,\u201d says Mooy, who believes this squad is capable of taking something from their opening game.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no point being here if you don\u2019t believe that. We need application, focus. These sorts of things are hugely important to make the most of this opportunity. We want to have a positive performance, maybe surprise a few people. That\u2019s the goal.\u201d"

                    "body": "\u2018My mission,\u201d Zanele Muholi has said, \u201cis to re-write a Black queer and trans visual history of South Africa, for the world to know of our resistance and existence\u201d. With photographs that range from small to colossal, this self-proclaimed \u201cvisual activist\u201d captures people in their communities, people who have often been subjected to violence because of their sexuality. Muholi tells their marginalised stories. Born in 1972, Muholi grew up in South Africa during apartheid, and was a young adult when the brutal system came to an end in 1994. This was meant to usher in a new era of political and social progress: the 1996 Constitution of the Republic of South Africa banned all discrimination on grounds of gender and sexuality. Ten years later, the country legalised same-sex marriage, the only one to do so in the entire African continent. Yet queer communities still face injustices daily, from abuse to much worse. Muholi took up photography in their youth. \u201cI was going through a rough period,\u201d they once told the Guardian. \u201cThe camera was a tool through which I could speak about whatever was inside \u2013 the feelings, the pain, the personal experiences.\u201d Weaving their stories into art history, placing them on museum walls for all to see, Muholi makes LGBTQ+ people visible so that \u201cfuture generations will note that we were here\u201d. In 2006, Muholi sought to build a living archive for the queer community through Faces and Phases, a vast series that contains more than 500 photographs. It tells us about the individuals who are shaping this new South Africa \u2013 and also risking their lives by defiantly looking into Muholi\u2019s lens and stating: \u201cI am here and my story deserves to be told.\u201d  Tinashe Wakapila, from Durban, features in the series, their Instagram bio describing them as \u201cPoet, Civil Rights Activist, Feminist, Revolutionary Human, Model, Queer AF\u201d. Muholi also photographed Lungile Cleo Dladla, from the township of Kwa-Thema, who in 2010 was raped by a man with a gun and subsequently diagnosed as HIV positive. \u201cJust existing daily,\u201d says Muholi, \u201cis political in itself.\u201d In 2009, three years after same-sex marriage became legal, there was a sign of how far South Africa still had to go. Lulama Xingwana, minister of arts and culture, was criticised for walking out of an exhibition featuring Muholi\u2019s photographs. Xingwana called the show \u201cimmoral, offensive and going against nation-building\u201d and judged it a threat to children. How will discrimination end if the government, rather than driving positive change, chooses instead to condemn anything that raises awareness about the experience of LGBTQ+ people? Muholi, at their exhibition at London\u2019s Tate Modern in 2020, chose to leave gaps on the walls in the display of photographs from Faces and Phases. The decision seemed to echo the invisibility of these people \u2013 and speak to their loss, their death, through hate crimes. The gaps also suggested those yet to be photographed.  How long will it take for all people to feel safe \u2013 and heard \u2013 in this world? This is the question posed by Muholi\u2019s work and it feels especially resonant this month as the World Cup kicks off in Qatar, where same-sex sexual activity is illegal. Khalid Salman, the country\u2019s World Cup ambassador, recently called homosexuality \u201cdamage in the mind\u201d. One prominent activist claimed that gay Qataris have been promised safety from torture in return for helping the authorities to track down other LGBTQ+ people in the country. Fans who hang LGBTQ+ flags in stadiums will be removed, apparently.  Echoing the response to the South African culture minister\u2019s refusal of LGBTQ+ representation, James Cleverly, the British foreign secretary, was criticised for urging fans to be \u201crespectful\u201d of Qatar\u2019s culture. Does Cleverly really want an idle acceptance of something so deeply unjust? This keeps the issue out of sight and such invisibility is damaging. It all makes Muholi\u2019s growing archive feel more necessary than ever. One can only imagine what effect it would have on young queer people in Qatar to see brave, defiant faces proudly asserting their identities and telling the world their stories."

                    "body": "World Cup 2022 BBC One/ITV | iPlayer/ITVXDavid Baddiel: Jews Don\u2019t Count Channel 4 | All 4Wednesday NetflixAgatha Christie: Lucy Worsley on the Mystery Queen BBC Two | iPlayer We all thought we knew the drill with World Cup television. Tentative hope followed by sofa-leaping delusion, ending with a desolate trudge to the fridge after England get unceremoniously turfed out on penalties. Well, not this time, in the tarnished, politically charged sporting arena of Qatar, with its disregard for human rights and women\u2019s rights, its outlawing of homosexuality and its ill treatment of migrant workers, allegations of corruption and so on. Who feels like tearing open the beer nuts for that? I thought, Just imagine if England won: we\u2019d all be shrugging in the streets. This was proved wrong with huge viewing figures, particularly for the team\u2019s 6-2 victory over Iran. Still, for a thrilling moment, sport stood aside and let integrity score a few \u2013 from the BBC replacing the opening ceremony with Gary Lineker\u2019s courteous but still scathing monologue on the Qatari regime, to the Iran team\u2019s heart-stopping courage in refusing to sing their national anthem (echoing the wave of protests back home sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini). Before long there were reports of Qatar having \u201cbuyer\u2019s remorse\u201d about hosting. As for the OneLove armbands, Germany\u2019s players covered their mouths with their hands for the pre-match photos ahead of their game with Japan on Wednesday to indicate they\u2019d been gagged by Fifa, who threatened sanctions against those teams wearing them. Alex Scott wore hers while standing pitchside for BBC One\u2019s coverage of the England v Iran game. Over on ITV for Wales\u2019s opening match against the USA, Roy Keane chided the England squad for not wearing theirs for their first match. \u201cTake your medicine and then in the next game you move on,\u201d he growled from behind a strong beard. Arguably, nobody should be in Qatar, including well-remunerated ambassador for the country David Beckham, occasionally glimpsed looking as though he wished the sand would swallow him up. On Channel 4, someone who once sang \u201cfootball\u2019s coming home\u201d had other things on his mind. David Baddiel: Jews Don\u2019t Count is the TV version of the comedian\u2019s 2021 book, which asked why, in this era of heightened sensitivities, Jewish people aren\u2019t included in conversations about racism. At first it\u2019s a little alarming when Baddiel appears, suited, in black and white: is he going to Ted talk the book at us? In the event, the documentary is just as well argued, weaving through several tough issues, from Jewish stereotypes (running Hollywood; controlling global finances) to Israel/Palestine (discussed by Baddiel and Miriam Margolyes), from cultural prejudice (an evil wealthy character in a Royal Court play was changed to Jewish from Mexican-American to \u201cavoid giving offence\u201d) to mass denial that antisemitism is a factor, even when synagogues are attacked, and more. Various Jewish celebrities are enlisted along the way. Actor David Schwimmer reveals: \u201cI\u2019ve never felt white. Ever.\u201d Author Dara Horn observes: \u201cThere are people who feel that antisemitism consists of murdering 6 million Jews and anything short of that is no big deal.\u201d Comedian Sarah Silverman wonders: \u201cIf we controlled things, wouldn\u2019t we have better PR?\u201d  Elsewhere, Baddiel visits his old Jewish primary school and finds that the children now have regular security drills. He also faces up to his own racism when, as co-presenter of the BBC\u2019s Fantasy Football League in the 90s, he wore blackface to lampoon footballer Jason Lee. When Baddiel meets Lee at the latter\u2019s AbsoluteLee podcast studio to apologise in person, it\u2019s politely accepted. Well, ish. It\u2019s actually one of the tensest TV moments of the year. It\u2019s a cobwebbed understatement to say I expected much of new Netflix eight-parter Wednesday. If we all have an inner child, then make mine Wednesday Addams, baby-goth queen of the acid one-liner. This is what Netflix is up against: those still in thrall to the \u201ctrue\u201d Wednesday, as flawlessly portrayed by Christina Ricci in 1990s films The Addams Family and Addams Family Values. How could Smallville creators Alfred Gough and Miles Millar top that? The first four episodes are directed by Tim Burton (who knows his way around spooks and kooks), while the terrific Jenna Ortega plays Wednesday. The skinny plaits, icicle stare, rigor mortis posture and monotonic delivery (\u201cSartre said hell is other people. He was my first crush\u201d) are all there as Wednesday sets piranhas on high school swim-team bullies. She\u2019s then sent to the Edgar Allan Poe-inspired Nevermore Academy, basically a Hogwarts for \u201coutcasts\u201d, with Mean Girls noir tribes: Fangs (vampires), Furs (werewolves), Stoners (gorgons) and Scales (sirens).  Nevermore is the alma mater of Wednesday\u2019s mother, Morticia, played somewhat flatly by Catherine Zeta-Jones (think a tranquillised Valley of the Dolls), while Morticia\u2019s all-important spark with husband Gomez (Luis Guzm\u00e1n) is awol. Elsewhere, la Ricci appears as a Nevermore teacher, while Gwendoline Christie is the stooping, Dahl-esque principal. One problem is there\u2019s too much going on: psychic visions, stalking monsters, \u201cnormie\u201d townspeople, pilgrims, witch burning. Now she\u2019s 16, Wednesday is also given admirers (Hunter Doohan and Percy Hynes White), which is where I lost patience. Bore off with the boyfriends! A rare creature such as Wednesday is beyond humanising. Indeed, nicely done though the series is, it adheres too firmly to the teen mystery/romantic quandary template. For this Addams fangirl, it\u2019s a waste of her specialness.  In the opening episode of the new three-part series Agatha Christie: Lucy Worsley on the Mystery Queen (BBC Two), the historian hunts through the author\u2019s early life for clues into her psychology and finds a few: the unconventional family; the spendthrift father; the cut-price Egyptian debutante season; the pharmaceutical know-how gleaned volunteering in hospitals during the first world war; the unsuitable marriage to a pilot beneath her station, who was, Worsley gasps, \u201cincredibly hot\u201d. Once Christie started writing, a publisher said a courtroom scene didn\u2019t work, and thus the fabled drawing room denouement was born. This is great fun for those of us who are Christie aficionados. (You didn\u2019t ask, but my favourite screen Poirot is David Suchet \u2013 naturellement! \u2013 while Miss Marple would be a snoop-off between Joan Hickson and Geraldine McEwan.) Few put a pin through human nature quite like \u201chistory\u2019s greatest detective author\u201d, and \u2013 delving, speculating, prying \u2013 Worsley does her proud.

                    "body": "World Cup organisers are increasingly open to discarding the new three-team group format for the 2026 tournament in the US, Mexico and Canada. It comes after concerns that too many dead rubbers in the last round of matches could dilute the expanded, 48-team event.\nAlthough Fifa\u2019s official position remains unaltered, multiple sources say there have been \u201cinformal talks\u201d and \u201ccorridor chats\u201d in Doha about the benefits of going with 12 groups of four teams rather than 16 groups of three.\nThat could lead to a 104-game World Cup if the top two in each group, plus the best eight third-placed sides, go through to a 32-team knockout stage \u2013 which is 40 more than will be played at Qatar 2022.\n\nNothing has been decided and stakeholders are expected to talk more formally about a potential switch in the coming months. Any decision would have to be taken next year.\nOne well-placed observer said that if the tournament were extended by a few days to fit in more matches then neither Fifa nor the major sponsors would likely object. They pointed to the vast extra revenue that would be generatedthrough ticket sales and concessions.\nHowever, such a move would risk a conflict with clubs and players\u2019 unions given the sensitivities around the increasingly busy calendar and the likelihood of the best teams having to play eight matches and not seven.\nThere is acknowledgment in the game that three-team groups have severe flaws. One is that it may lead to unofficial deals being struck in the last match if, say, both teams needed a high-scoring draw to go through on goal difference. Similarly, if one team lose the first two matches, the final match of the group would only decide where the other two countries ended up in the knockout stage.\nIf Fifa needed any reminder of how a four-team group format can generate extraordinary tension and chaos it was illustrated in Group D on Wednesday as the Poland v Argentina and Saudi Arabia v Mexico matches went to the wire.\nWhatever happens, the number of World Cup games will rise. The tournament has consisted of 64 matches since the switch to 32 teams in 1998. Increasing it to 48 teams for 2026 will lead to a minimum of 80 games, the figure under a three-group format."

                    "body": "The Via Manzanares shopping centre in the northern suburb of Pilar outside Buenos Aires is an old-style ring of stores around a modest parking lot that usually services a countryside area dotted with gated communities and polo clubs, in a country that boasts the best polo players in the world.There\u2019s a small supermarket, a bicycle shop, a sushi delivery store, a coffee shop and not much more, except for a sleepy mutt named Canela who\u2019ll amble up for a pat on the head from the shoppers stopping by for a pack of beer, a quick espresso or to order a tray of nigiri.But in recent days its peace has been disturbed by fans not of polo, but of football. A large quantity of kids and adults stood patiently waiting in line outside its sweet shop, desperate to buy \u201cfiguritas\u201d, football player stickers similar to US baseball cards.The object is to fill the traditional Panini World Cup album that is a ritual of almost religious significance that repeats itself every four years in Argentina when the World Cup tournament rolls around. The stickers come in sealed packs and there is no assurance collectors will find the players they need to complete the album. Sold in countries around the world, an English-language version in the UK will cost fans an average of about \u00a3870 to fill.With the Qatar games fast approaching, Argentina has gone into a dizzy whirl that is outdoing by a wide stride any previous sticker furore in a country that breathes, dreams and lives football.\u201cI can\u2019t handle the amount of people wanting stickers,\u201d said the attendant at the Via Manzanares sweet shop early in the week, before having to inform her distraught customers that she had run out of packs on Thursday.Sticker mania has swept over Argentina like a tsunami this year, creating a scarcity on the sticker market that has quite literally become an affair of state.Sweet shops, known here as \u201cquioscos\u201d, have been the traditional outlet for sticker packs, but this year Panini began supplying the stickers to other outlets such as supermarkets and gas stations, provoking howls of protest from sweet shop owners.Trade secretary Mat\u00edas Tombolini was forced to call a meeting with Panini executives and sweet shop representatives to try to solve a scarcity that has led to media-reported threats from some parents to sue Panini because of the anguish the scarcity has been causing their children.\u201cThe meeting has begun to assess the situation of the World Cup figuritas market,\u201d the trade secretary tweeted, offering to \u201cmake our legal and technical teams available to collaborate in the search for possible solutions.\u201dBut with inflation out of control and poverty snapping at the heels of an ever-widening segment of society, the government\u2019s intervention backfired badly. There was a social media uproar against the authorities distracting state resources to solve the stickers problem and the government abruptly suspended its intervention.The hardest sticker to find is that of Argentina\u2019s ace player Lionel Messi, who will reportedly be playing his last World Cup at the Qatar games.  Marc R Stanley, the US ambassador to Argentina, posted an ecstatic Twitter video of himself opening up his sticker packages. \u201cOh holy crap, I got Messi, I can\u2019t believe it. That\u2019s unbelievable. I got Messi! All right, Messi, you\u2019re mine!\u201dApart from Italian-owned Panini allowing the stickers to be sold at other venues than just sweet shops, the scarcity is being blamed on distributors who are reportedly bypassing traditional outlets to sell directly in wholesale amounts to individual buyers, sometimes online.This seems to have led to hoarding by mass buyers who then hawk the stickers on the online shopping site Mercado Libre for up to 10 times their suggested retail price of slightly under one dollar a pack.With inflation heading for 100% this year and the recent assassination attempt on vice-president Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, which failed when the assailant\u2019s gun failed to fire, perhaps Argentina was in need of some light distraction, and the sticker scarcity seems to fit the bill."

                    "body": "It was 16-year-old Mohamed Suleiman from Bolton who said it best, as he gazed at a vast panorama of England supporters around him in Doha \u2013 and saw so many faces looking like his own. \u201cI think English fan culture is changing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming more diverse. More welcoming. And you can definitely see it in Qatar.\u201d\nMohamed\u2019s father, Abdul, explained that he had always dreamed of taking his son to a World Cup. Now they were here in England shirts for what they both called a trip of a lifetime. \u201cOver the weekend England and Wales fans were fighting in Spain,\u201d added Abdul. \u201cBut there are no issues here. Perhaps the lack of alcohol has something to do with it, but it feels safe and welcoming.\u201d\nThese were not isolated voices. On the metro Tarique Ghaffur, a former assistant commissioner with the Met, stressed how much English fan culture has improved since he was policing the terraces in the 70s. His son, FG, a prominent YouTuber who has worked with Manchester City, made it clear that he had never faced an issue in the game because of the colour of his skin. \u201cFootball is a global sport,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd a fantastic leveller.\u201d\n\n\nOf course the majority of England supporters in Qatar still conform to the traditional stereotype. But it is all a far cry from the last time the national team played in an away tournament, at the 2019 Nations League in Portugal. Thousands of fans caused general mayhem in Porto and sang songs about Tommy Robinson, the IRA and German bombers. Two England fans were also arrested after being baton-charged by police after hurling bottles at local supporters and police in a packed fan zone.\nSo what is going on? Several fans the Guardian spoke to suggested that because Qatar is a Muslim country and it is harder to find alcohol, they felt safer travelling out to support England. They knew they would not be drenched by a beer shower and the risk of antisocial behaviour would be lower.\nSeveral second-generation British Indians and Pakistanis also said they had family in the region, and so felt comfortable coming out. There are also many guest workers, particularly from India, who have adopted England as their favourite national team. And not always for football reasons either. As Nasisasa, from Thailand, put it to the Guardian: \u201cI support England because they are a good team \u2026 and their players are handsome.\u201d\n\nAnother factor, according to the academic Jamie Cleland, is that many younger white England fans have not travelled to Qatar because it is so expensive \u2013 which has broadened the fanbase. \u201cWith the World Cup occurring mid-season, close to Christmas, and in a cost of living crisis, it is no surprise to see so many traditional fans stay behind in the UK,\u201d he says.\nThe second academic Geoff Pearson agrees. \u201cOne way to look at a football team\u2019s support is to consider in terms of different subcultures that basically attend matches for different reasons,\u201d he explains. \u201cA lot of the work that I\u2019ve done has been about a subculture of English fans I call the carnival fan. They essentially travel and their primary focus is around the match, not the match itself.\u201d\nPearson, whose book An Ethnography of English Football Fans: Cans, Cops and Carnivals, is the definitive work on the subject, adds: \u201cTheir behaviour is based around transgression, intoxication, chanting and creating atmosphere. And when it comes to the English national team that subculture is predominantly male and predominantly white. Not exclusively male and not exclusively white. But it\u2019s very much laddish behaviour.\u201d\n\nWhat does that mean? According to Pearson it is \u201cbeer in the air, standing on tables, chanting, hanging flags up, that kind of thing. It\u2019s not violence. And it\u2019s not necessarily racist either. But it\u2019s predominantly white, male and laddish.\n\u201cHowever that subculture of England fans hasn\u2019t really travelled to Qatar in sufficient numbers. Whereas normally for tournaments, or big matches particularly in Europe, that subculture will dominate. And of course, that subculture will travel even if they don\u2019t have tickets, because actually attending the matches isn\u2019t primarily why they\u2019re there.\u201d\n\nThe situation is complicated and nuanced, but it suggests that what we are seeing in Qatar 2022 is a blip rather than a long-term trend. Pearson, for one, cautions that we may not see such diversity among England\u2019s fanbase for the 2024 European Championships in Germany.\n\u201cI think the fact that it\u2019s easy to get tickets in Qatar has made a big difference as well in terms of a more diverse fanbase,\u201d he adds. \u201cTo a certain extent, it\u2019s a bit of a closed shop for tournaments in Europe, in particular, because demand outstrips supply so greatly. If England qualifies for the Euros in two years\u2019 time it will be very very different indeed.\u201d"

                    "body": "The US men\u2019s national team drew 0-0 with Saudi Arabia in Spain on Tuesday in their final game before their opening World Cup clash against Wales on 21 November. Following on from Friday\u2019s tame 2-0 loss to Japan in Germany, these were two tune-ups that served to underline the team\u2019s shortcomings rather than solve them, played in low-key atmospheres that felt more like pre-season friendlies than the last international fixtures before a World Cup. Context is key It was a series that was more send-to-sleep than send-off, but let\u2019s acknowledge the weird circumstances. A game in front of 364 spectators (yes, 364!) on a bad pitch at the home of third-tier Real Murcia is not the sort of occasion that promotes good vibrations. Contrast with June 2014, when the US were roared off to Brazil with a pair of 2-1 wins: over Turkey in front of a sell-out 26,672 crowd at Red Bull Arena and Nigeria before 52,033 in Jacksonville. The US beat Ghana in their opening group game in Brazil nine days after that victory in Florida. But this group of players are heading back to their clubs, some of them facing another dozen fixtures or so until Qatar 2022 kicks off. It would have carried an injury risk but US Soccer may have cause to regret not arranging another friendly in November, as a number of nations have done, including Mexico and Canada. On this evidence a final dress rehearsal on the eve of the tournament would have been useful.  If the US don\u2019t have pace and intensity, they don\u2019t have much Head coach Gregg Berhalter has discarded some experienced names in order to shape what will be one of the youngest rosters in Qatar. That reflects a conscious break with the past after the failure of Bruce Arena\u2019s veterans to reach the 2018 tournament, and also a desire to instill a dynamic pressing style that Berhalter hopes will compensate for a talent deficit relative to the gaudiest World Cup rosters. But when they\u2019re being outmuscled and outhustled, as was the case against Japan and for some of Tuesday\u2019s game, they seem to drift, unable to find a quick course correction unless Berhalter shakes things up with substitutions or Christian Pulisic takes charge. That\u2019s partly down to a lack of experience, but it also reflects a dependency on midfielder Weston McKennie. Barrelling into dangerous areas, he was an inspirational link to the forwards when the US were at their best during Concacaf qualifying. However, the Juventus man was poor against Japan and mediocre against Saudi Arabia and as a result the US lacked command in midfield. These slapdash two matches have made it even more obvious that Yunus Musah\u2019s tenacity and resilience under pressure are going to be critical against World Cup-calibre nations. The Valencia midfielder was missing from this camp through injury; but his absence only enhanced his reputation. Striking shortcomings persist Two shots on target against Saudi Arabia; none against Japan. A team that entered the international window lacking a proven goalscorer ended it none the wiser given the lack of good chances. It means that Jesus Ferreira of FC Dallas remains the favorite to start against Wales, and he did force goalkeeper Mohammed Al-Yami into an admittedly straightforward save soon after coming on for Ricardo Pepi. With a paltry 13 touches, Pepi didn\u2019t get the opportunity to demonstrate that he\u2019s rediscovering his scoring touch after a fallow period of almost a year. It\u2019s fair to say this fixture wasn\u2019t much of a confidence-booster for the teenager.  Also dishearteningly, one of the squad\u2019s shiniest creative forces, Gio Reyna, exited after half an hour as a precaution with muscle tightness. The 19-year-old\u2019s injury history means he\u2019s best treated as a potential impact substitute despite his starting XI-level ability. And Pulisic was muted. Berhalter\u2019s side have scored once in six games on foreign soil this year. It\u2019s been more than a year since they won on the road and they haven\u2019t found the net in six of their 12 games in 2022. The battle to be No 1 is done Japan\u2019s dominance gave Matt Turner the chance to showcase his shot-stopping skills and the clean sheet against Saudi Arabia also enhanced the Arsenal back-up\u2019s case to start in Qatar. The 28-year-old is surely now the undisputed first choice, with his only serious rival, Zack Steffen, absent from the camp. Berhalter had been expected to give possible third-choices Ethan Horvath and Sean Johnson some action but Turner played every minute of both matches. With the center back slot next to Walker Zimmerman still very much up for grabs, Turner looked reassuringly reliable. The identity of the goalkeeper likely to start against Wales might have been the only issue Berhalter was able to resolve to his satisfaction after a pair of games that proved more confounding than clarifying. Uncertainty is certain in Qatar Was this an improved performance compared with the Japan game? Slightly, yes. But Saudi Arabia are a worse team than Japan. And they still carved out better chances than the Americans. For what it\u2019s worth, neither opponent has ever gone beyond the round of 16 at a World Cup. Brow furrowed, weight of the world on his shoulders, Berhalter stalked the touchline like a technical-area Hamlet, dressed all in Nike black, as if attending a memorial service with a sports-casual dress code. But no need to issue the obituary notices just yet for the US\u2019s prospects of progressing from Group B, which also comprises England and Iran in addition to Wales. The performances in the past two games are sure to generate pessimism, but they should also strike a note of realism. So much emotional energy has been invested in returning to the World Cup after eight years, with less consideration of how the team might fare in Qatar. The US looked what they are: Concacaf\u2019s third-best nation, missing half-a-dozen players. Berhalter\u2019s team have shown they can raise their game against their greatest rivals, Mexico, so it\u2019s perfectly possible that they will be inspired on the greatest stage come November. Or that they\u2019ll get some early luck or benefit from a moment of individual greatness that will send their self-belief soaring. Then again, this is an injury-prone side short of depth \u2013 the US struggles if their handful of stars are absent or out of sorts \u2013 and they need to get things right from the start, as it\u2019s hard to imagine them qualifying from the group if they lose the opening clash with Wales. Berhalter is certainly executing a masterclass in managing expectations downwards. After admitting to reporters that the team \u201cgot our butts kicked\u201d by Japan, he said that \u201canxiety\u201d and a lack of confidence affected the display against Saudi Arabia. The only ways from here are up \u2026 or out."

                    "body": "In a parallel universe \u2013 say at Wembley or Molineux \u2013 Harry Maguire rumbles forward and keeps on going to the fringes of the penalty area. It is 0-0, half an hour gone and England are labouring.\nMaguire does not give the impression that he has the ball entirely under his spell. Or that he knows what he is going to do next. It is chaotically off the cuff. He simply puts his head down and shoots. It zings out for a throw-in on the far side.\nCue the derision? Because that is what Maguire tends to inspire in big crowds back in England. Not here. Not at the Ahmad bin Ali Stadium on Tuesday night in the final World Cup group game against Wales. Within seconds, the England fans behind the other goal have begun to sing Maguire\u2019s song, the one about his alcohol preferences and massive head.\n\nSpool forward to the interval. The game remains goalless, England error-strewn and predictable. Cue the boos? Because that is what tends to happen. England were jeered by the Wembley crowd at half-time in their opening Euro 2020 matches against Croatia and Scotland with the score at 0-0 and everyone remembers the vitriol at Molineux in June during the Nations League game against Hungary. That night, England were 1-0 down at the break. It would get much worse.\nAt the Ahmad bin Ali, there were no boos when the half-time whistle blew, no spontaneous outpouring of frustration. It seemed to reinforce a couple of developing themes for Gareth Southgate and his squad as they attempt to win the World Cup \u2013 next stop Senegal in the last 16 on Sunday night \u2013 with trust and patience central to them.\nPlaying at home can be a blessing and a curse for a national team, especially at a tournament. Remember Brazil at the 2014 World Cup? With 200 million deeply passionate people willing them on, the side were a sea of nerves and anxiety, riding the wave as far as the semi-final before they crashed against Germany.\n\nSouthgate has previously said there could be no greater pressure for his players than to have what was effectively a home tournament at the Euros, with all but one of their games at Wembley. The desperation of the supporters for glory can magnify the highs and drive a wild kind of momentum. It can accentuate the lows.\nIt is different in Qatar, more balanced. The profile of the travelling England fan feels different. Perhaps the alcohol situation is also a factor. No one seems to be fired-up drunk inside the stadiums. There were boos at the end of the 0-0 draw against the USA in the second group game but that was after the full-time whistle. It did not affect the performance. A half-time booing is harsher. It is a prejudgment.\nMaguire is feeding off the support. He positively bounded over to the England fans before kick-off against Wales, applauding them and getting plenty back. It is not to say that Maguire is not cheered at home or does not hear his song. Just that the bad stuff can overtake it there on a bad day. Over here, the supporters have embraced Maguire\u2019s cult-hero qualities. His size and physical toughness; the fun of him in full flight. He has had a good tournament so far.\n\nAs England eased to a 3-0 win over Wales in the second half, there was the chant to the tune of Jingle Bells about it being fun to see them win away. Christmas ditties during a World Cup? It is an unusual experience in so many ways.\n\u201cWe had fantastic support in the stadium,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cIt reminded me of tournaments I played in where you\u2019ve got that bank of fans and it\u2019s a very special feeling to run out and hear that.\u201d\nWednesday brought a day off for the England players, a time to reflect, and Southgate is happy at how phase one of the assignment has been completed. Nine goals, and they have been shared around; two clean sheets; group winners with seven points. The team spirit is excellent and Southgate\u2019s options run deep, especially for his front line.\nAgainst Wales, he was able to get minutes into Kyle Walker and Kalvin Phillips \u2013 as they work their way back after major operations \u2013 and control those of Luke Shaw, Declan Rice and Harry Kane, withdrawing them around the hour mark.\nMan-management is everything. Southgate has had to show compassion for Shaw, whose grandmother died before the opening game against Iran after a long time with cancer. \u201cShe was a really important part of my childhood \u2013 I spent a lot of time with her,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cYou could say she is part of my motivation.\u201d\nSouthgate\u2019s selection decisions have been difficult and they will only get more so. How to strike the right tone with those he omits? It was certainly a big call to leave out Raheem Sterling against Wales. Southgate has always started the Chelsea winger in tournaments \u2013 except the dead-rubber final group game against Belgium at the 2018 World Cup.\n\n\u201cRaheem\u2019s had two starts here and he\u2019s played at big clubs where you don\u2019t necessarily start every game,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cThe players understand that. Of course they are disappointed not to start but we\u2019ve got an incredible spirit among the group. They take that as well as you can expect. They\u2019ve got to be ready for when their moment comes.\u201d\nThe memory of England\u2019s first-half performance against Wales remains jarring; exhibit B for why they will not win the World Cup. Exhibit A had come from much of the 90 minutes against the USA. Southgate and some of the players pushed the idea that the largely sterile domination against Wales before the interval had served to wear their opponents out, setting up the second-half knockout blows. Maguire made a more irrefutable point. \u201cIf you watch a lot of the games here, they\u2019ve had really tense first halves,\u201d he said.\nThe England players can feel the excitement building, particularly when they see videos of the celebrations from home. \u201cIt\u2019s hard sometimes to stay calm,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cBut we have a good group and a good coaching staff who will always keep us grounded \u2013 especially Steve Holland.\u201d\n\nThat got a laugh. Southgate\u2019s assistant is surely more bad cop than the manager. But for a symbol of England\u2019s quiet assurance, look no further than Southgate\u2019s in-game demeanour. The manager has barely come out of his dugout, preferring to leave the players to it, to empower them.\n\u201cI got into a habit during Covid of standing on the touchline because you felt they needed more encouragement without the fans,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cBut I\u2019m happier biding my time and taking my moments. We\u2019ve also got the monitor where we can watch everything with a slight delay if things happen when you\u2019ve got to make tactical decisions. I don\u2019t need to be playing every ball with the players. I trust them.\u201d"

                    "body": "The Gregg Berhalter era began in the desert with a 3-0 friendly win over Panama in January 2019 in front of 9,040 people in Glendale, Arizona. The journey to Qatar has spanned 56 matches: a sometimes thrilling, occasionally dreary trip from the cacti and air-conditioned sprawl of the oblivious Phoenix suburbs to the dense skyscrapers and ignoble stadiums of the peninsula hosting the globe\u2019s highest-profile sporting event. Here, in another arid region known more for sand than soccer, come three or more games that will define Berhalter\u2019s tenure as head coach of the US men\u2019s national team \u2013 and, if things go horribly askew, probably end it. Given the immense scrutiny the Americans will face as co-hosts in 2026, Berhalter cannot afford to acquire a reputation as a tactician who shrinks under the spotlight. But adjudicating what would constitute success or failure in Qatar is tricky since this is a new and green group of players, only one of them \u2013 DeAndre Yedlin \u2013 with prior World Cup finals experience. There is relief that the US made the tournament at all following the 2018 qualifying debacle and a tremulous 2022 campaign that saw Berhalter\u2019s side finish behind Canada and Mexico, securing the third and final automatic place on goal difference on the last day. The man who took the US to the 2014 tournament, J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann, told Sports Illustrated in 2018, \u201cyou build a new skeleton between World Cups\u201d. There\u2019s not much flesh on the bones. But we\u2019re about to learn plenty about the heart, soul and mind of an American generation often touted as the most talented the nation has ever seen. Asked on ESPN about expectations, Berhalter spoke about style rather than results: \u201cI think it\u2019s important that we go over to Qatar and we represent our identity as a team. It\u2019s not time to change who we are. We\u2019re an aggressive team, a high-pressing team, we want to use the ball and we\u2019re going to find out if we can be successful doing it.\u201d Executing the gameplan flawlessly but finishing outside the top two in Group B, which also includes Wales, Iran and England, would not reflect well on the plan. It would also be a below-par outcome. Reaching back to Italia \u201990, the US have reached the knockout stages in four of their past seven finals, including their last two campaigns, in 2010 and 2014. But the only victory after the group phase came in 2002, when Bruce Arena\u2019s side beat Mexico in the round of 16 (and then lost unluckily to Germany in the quarter-finals).  A conclusion in Qatar that\u2019s in line with history and reasonable expectations, then, looks like a battling defeat in the round of 16 with Berhalter able to argue that his squad has banked valuable experience that will serve them well for 2026, when most of his core players should be at their peak. Anything more would be a bonus; anything less a disappointment. But luck will play a role. The group and knockout stages are \u201cliterally two different tournaments,\u201d the 49-year-old said. \u201cAnything can happen on any given day. All you want to do in the knockout tournament is play your best possible game. And if you happen to go out and you play your best possible game, you go out with your head held high.\u201d Still, such an exit would make it harder to assert that the USMNT have made significant progress in the eight years since the 2014 side did their best and lost, reaching the round of 16 but going out to a superior Belgium after extra-time despite the heroics of Tim Howard in goal. By the key metric for casual observers \u2013 how far did you get in the World Cup? \u2013 it would indicate stagnation. The 2022 side is obviously weaker at striker and goalkeeper than 2014, when the US boasted Clint Dempsey and Howard; in other positions it is potentially more dynamic, especially on the flanks. Plenty of the current crop are at large or medium-sized European clubs, but the 2014 vintage had steady veterans such as DaMarcus Beasley, Michael Bradley, Geoff Cameron and Jermaine Jones, who also spent time in major European leagues. \u201cOn paper they are the most talented US men\u2019s national team we\u2019ve ever had,\u201d says the former striker Herculez Gomez, who played for the US in the 2010 World Cup finals and will be in Doha to host a show on ESPN+. Compared to previous generations, \u201cThis team is a lot younger, a lot faster, better in transition, individually better, technically better.\u201d  However, he adds, they lack the veteran knowhow of the 2010 and 2014 sides, which had \u201cguys that were a bit nasty, who played with a chip on their shoulder\u201d and were not daunted by tough assignments away from home.  In 2014 the US sauntered to Brazil, winning the Hex qualification stage with seven victories and one defeat over 10 games for an 11-point cushion over fourth-placed Mexico, who progressed via the inter-confederation playoffs. For the 2022 cycle the US won only once on the road and scored 21 goals in 14 games, most of them close-range tap-ins or simple headers. A typical goal came from the defence failing to clear a cross and an American pouncing on the loose ball. No goals were scored from outside the penalty area and there were only two golazos: a Christian Pulisic pirouette against Panama and a rocket against Costa Rica from Sergi\u00f1o Dest. Aside from age, perhaps the biggest difference from eight years ago is not the calibre of those in the squad but the quality of those who aren\u2019t. The talent pool now is far deeper and there are many more Americans at foreign clubs \u2013 learning each day, as Gomez points out, from some of the planet\u2019s finest coaches. In contrast, most of the 2010 roster spent their late teens playing at American universities. Berhalter had enough options to almost completely reinvent the team. Only four of the players who lost the fateful 2017 qualifier to Trinidad &amp; Tobago are in the squad for Qatar. The coach trialled dozens of up-and-comers in their teens and early 20s, many playing in the top two divisions in leading European countries. He\u2019s used 91 players \u2013 three more than England\u2019s Gareth Southgate, who\u2019s overseen 20 more fixtures. Some of the players Berhalter has used most frequently \u2013 Paul Arriola, Sebastian Lletget, Gyasi Zardes, Reggie Cannon, Zack Steffen \u2013 didn\u2019t even make the final 26.  Other names that Berhalter has discarded or ignored imply the luxury of choice. The teenaged attacking midfielder Julian Green, shockingly named in the 2014 squad by Klinsmann, scored with his first touch against Belgium. Now 27, Green made 24 Bundesliga appearances last season for Greuther F\u00fcrth but no one seriously expected him to be invited to Qatar. He hasn\u2019t made a single appearance under Berhalter. Of the 26 in Qatar, nine are at MLS clubs and the other 17 ply their trade in Europe. But Berhalter (a former MLS player and coach) could easily have picked a comparably gifted roster with only three MLS-based players, Walker Zimmerman, Kellyn Acosta and Jes\u00fas Ferreira. Klinsmann, meanwhile, selected 10 MLS players for his 23-man squad despite his aversion to the league, which he saw as substandard. And the level in MLS has improved since 2014, when there were only 19 teams; this season there were 28. Klinsmann, for all his grand long-term schemes to rebuild the pipeline from top to bottom, was fired when it looked doubtful that the senior team would reach Russia. Given the extreme importance of the World Cup to the profile of American soccer his departure wasn\u2019t surprising. The 2014 group game between the US and Portugal attracted about 25 million viewers on ESPN and Univision. The US\u2019s final warm-up game before Qatar, a goalless draw with Saudi Arabia, drew an audience of 226,000 on FS1. The Black Friday clash with England is a big opportunity to attract attention, though the summer tournament in Brazil became a mainstream cultural moment that will be hard to repeat in 2022 given the early kick-off times for US residents and the alternative temptations of the festive season, with football, basketball and hockey in full swing. Still, there are gains that can\u2019t be as easily measured as viewing figures or the results of a month-long tournament. Some are Klinsmann\u2019s legacy: intensive recruitment of dual nationals, the conviction that the US should adopt a more complex and attractive style, an emphasis on youth development, and encouraging players to move to Europe. In 2014 there were growing pains. Klinsmann deployed criticism as motivation but it was sometimes hard to tell whether he was being demanding or demeaning. One New York Times headline read: How Jurgen Klinsmann Plans to Make US Soccer Better (and Less American). The vision was bright but blurry. When Berhalter talks about his team\u2019s identity he\u2019s discussing tactics, not inviting agonised introspection about what it means to be an American soccer player. Eight years on from the US\u2019s last World Cup finals there is a stronger domestic league and a deeper well of global talent. Tactical debates, not an identity crisis. A coach not a psychodramatist. And the promise of greater things in three-and-a-half years\u2019 time. It would be optimistic to expect the US to take a giant step forward in Qatar but there is little doubt the path leads upwards."

                    "body": "It is happening. Australia are one match away from making the knockout stages of a World Cup for the first time since 2006.  On Saturday the Socceroos rescued their Qatar 2022 campaign, beating Tunisia 1-0 to atone for their 4-1 tournament-opening loss to France. But, as Graham Arnold said after Saturday\u2019s historic win, they haven\u2019t \u201cdone nothing\u201d yet.  Denmark now await in the third and final group match, which will decide their fate. For the first time in a long time their chances of making the round of 16 are in their own hands. Yet there are still permutations to unpack. In keeping with World Cup tradition in place to avoid unfair advantage, the final fixtures of each group will kick off simultaneously. France, the defending champions, have confirmed they will finish at the top of Group D. Here\u2019s what you need to know about Australia\u2019s fight for second. Group D as it stands (points and goal difference) France: 6 (+4) Australia: 3 (-2) Denmark: 1 (-1) Tunisia: 1 (-1) The fixtures (both Thursday 2am AEDT) Tunisia v France Australia v Denmark If the Socceroos win They are through to the round of 16. This is the simplest equation and the one that offers surety regardless of the other result. A defeat of Denmark, coupled with their win over Tunisia, would give Australia a total of six points. That means they would qualify as the second-placed finisher in the group behind France, who have already sealed their progression thanks to their two wins. If the Socceroos draw This is more complicated. A draw \u2013 which would give them a total of four points and leave Denmark on two \u2013 could well do the trick. But Tunisia could make life difficult by beating France, which would bring the Tunisians level with Australia on four points but with a superior goal difference (this is why conceding four goals against France matters). By virtue of the goal difference, Tunisia would advance and the Socceroos finish third. On paper, France should be all over Tunisia. But Didier Deschamps could rest his best players in preparation for their first knockout match. Watch this space. If the Socceroos lose This is decidedly less complicated. A defeat would end their campaign. Denmark would increase their tally to four points and leapfrog Australia."

                    "body": "It is late afternoon in Al Wakrah and as Kalvin Phillips discusses crossing his fingers to recover from shoulder surgery in time for the World Cup in a Bedouin-style tent at England\u2019s training base it seems apt that the call to prayer for the Maghrib Salah seeps into conversation. In weeks gone by the only call Phillips, who has played just four minutes in the Premier League this season, had been praying for was from Gareth Southgate and before receiving confirmation of his place in the squad his anxiety was only heightened when Kyle Walker, his Manchester City teammate who has been sidelined since October, told of his inclusion earlier that morning.  Phillips has been limited to a total of almost 70 minutes across four appearances for City since a \u00a345m move from Leeds in the summer. \u201cI think Kyle had been told the day before me, so I walked in the gym, Kyle came to me and said: \u2018Ah, Gareth\u2019s just rung me and said I\u2019m involved in the World Cup,\u2019 and I was thinking: \u2018Well, if he\u2019s ringing all the injured players telling him they\u2019re involved, well why hadn\u2019t he rang me?\u2019 So there was a little bit of doubt that crept in,\u201d Phillips says. \u201cI got a phone call about 9.30am. I asked him how he was and he said: \u2018A lot better after seeing you play for 40 minutes\u2019 [against Chelsea in the Carabao Cup on 9 November] and then he told me that I was involved. I just said: \u2018Thanks a lot\u2019 and \u2018Thanks for including me, and thanks for believing in me.\u2019\u201dSouthgate was always going to give Phillips every chance of making the cut given his starring role at Euro 2020, where he started every game, including the final, playing all but 25 minutes of his first major tournament. Phillips won England\u2019s player of the year in 2020-21. \u201cIn the Euros I had a really \u2026 well, I had an alright tournament,\u201d he says, smiling. \u201cI spoke to Pep [Guardiola]. He didn\u2019t exactly force me to get the operation but said he felt it was the best thing to do to have the best chance to be involved in the World Cup. When Pep tells you something like that then you\u2019re not going to ignore it.\u201dPhillips first dislocated his shoulder at Leeds before suffering a recurrence in a pre-season friendly for City against Barcelona at Camp Nou in August. \u201cThe first time it popped out at Leeds it literally wouldn\u2019t go back in and that was like an hour\u2019s drive in the taxi to the hospital, so every bump that he [the driver] went over and every turn that it took, I was in agony,\u201d he recalls. After deciding to undergo surgery in September, Phillips at least felt in good hands, with his surgeon, Lennard Funk, having previously operated on Nick Pope.  It is clear Phillips, a self-deprecating character who previously likened his role at the base of midfield to a dog that chases whoever has the ball, is excited to be at his first World Cup, only 18 months after getting the man of the match award on his tournament debut against Croatia at Euro 2020. He looks in rude health \u2013 he says he is at about 95% fitness but could start against Iran on Monday if required \u2013 but why is his left flip-flop scissored and his foot cut? \u201cIt\u2019s quite a good story,\u201d he grins.He whittled what should have been a 12-week recovery period into seven-and-a-half weeks: gruelling double sessions, stints in the heat chamber, altitude training and hours on the bike. But his hard work could have been rendered redundant had he dropped anything heavier than a 5kg weight plate on his foot on the morning of City\u2019s final game before the World Cup break, a surprise stoppage-time defeat to Brentford, for which he was an unused substitute.\u201cBeing the professional that I am,\u201d he smiles, \u201cI went to the gym before the match and was just doing loads of Achilles work on the leg press. I\u2019d gone to pull a weight off the rack and there must have been one stuck behind it and [as] I pulled it off it landed straight on my foot and cut it all. But it is not too bad, it is the blisters from training [in Qatar] that hurt more \u2013 it isn\u2019t too bad but I stood for about 10 seconds and thought: \u2018Oh my god, what was that?\u2019 If it wasn\u2019t a 5kg plate, if it had been heavier, I think it would have been a lot worse.\u201dHas he been able to benefit from Guardiola\u2019s wisdom despite his stop-start beginning to life at City? \u201cI\u2019ve not been able to learn as much as I would like because of my injuries but from the first moment I walked in I was learning. The way Pep sees the game and wants his players to play was a massive eye-opener. When I got there I was confident in myself and in the first training session I was just like \u2018Woaaah\u2019 this is very, very different, this is very tough. But they are the best players in the world so I didn\u2019t have any regrets or doubts.\u201dPhillips is determined to seize his latest chance. The 26-year-old hopes his father, Mark, an inmate at Wealstun Prison, will be able to tune into his games. Congratulatory messages from old teachers at Farnley Academy, his secondary school in Leeds, and old coaches from Wortley Juniors, his first club three miles from Elland Road, flooded in, filtered via his twin sister, Deren, after news of his place in the squad spread. \u201cIt was very humbling for me as I came from a little area in Leeds, not a tough upbringing but had to work for everything that I got and just to get the call-up, after the eight weeks I had was a relief,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I knew the hard work was about to start.\u201d"

                    "body": "\u201cAnd the winner is \u2026 Qatar!\u201d It all began with those words, read out in a tone of strangled gaiety by Sepp Blatter on stage at Fifa house. Twelve years on Qatar 2022 has now concluded with the same phrase hanging in the air.\nProject Hard Football Power is complete. And it really could not have gone any better, a micromanaged power play, from the pharaonic-scale nation-building project, to the painted backdrop sets, to the regional visibility that helped see Qatar through the blockade years, to the chance at the death to parade Lionel Messi around the winners\u2019 enclosure like a beaming Guy Fawkes dummy. The winner is ... Qatar!\nThere were layers to that moment of ignition back in December 2010. Blatter\u2019s strange tone spoke to the fact that he also knew he was reading out his own redundancy note, that Qatar\u2019s victory indicated he, Blatter, had lost control of the show. Standing there stiff as a board, Blatter nudged J\u00e9r\u00f4me Valcke, who looked as if he was about to cry, and ordered him to smile.\n\nOn the back of that moment the house of Blatter would fall, the regime of the more opaque and unknowable Gianni Infantino would rise. And that stage of the cycle is now done. The most costly, carbon-heavy, bloodstained, corruption-shadowed event in the history of global sport is a wrap. But what does it mean? And what next?\nQatar 2022 also signalled the end of a few other things. For starters, the end of the pretence, and it was always a pretence, that there is any kind of innocence about Fifa\u2019s World Cup; that this is anything other than a marauding city state, out there circling the globe looking for the next compliant and complicit host to share in its gluttony.\n\nQatar has transformed football: you also hear this a lot. In reality Qatar has simply supercharged what was already there, presented us with football\u2019s standard corruption and hypocrisy stripped of artifice and gleamingly unapologetic.\nQatar didn\u2019t invent this world, didn\u2019t invent migrant labour, didn\u2019t invent global capitalism. It is simply the most zealous of late adopters, selling brutal carbon-fed hyper-capitalism back to the world in its final form, like the Beatles taking rock and roll to America.\nOn a more micro level the end of this World Cup is also the end of a generation of great players, perhaps even an end to the age of the modern-day individualist, a lineage that runs though Ronaldinho to Messi. Football is more compressed, more systems-led, more controlled than ever. It seems possible the highest stage may never again see a baggy, strolling 35-year-old conjurer of patterns. Similarly Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar, Luka Modric, Karim Benzema, Robert Lewandowski, goodnight ladies, sweet ladies, good night.\n\nAnd for now, as the comedown starts to bite, there are probably three things worth saying about Qatar 2022. First, the football was excellent. The action on the pitch was luminous, packed with drama and topped with the greatest World Cup final ever staged.\nThere is no meaning to this, no moral to be drawn. The World Cup was good because football is good. This is why Qatar paid $220bn to borrow its light. It is why Fifa will rake in $7bn revenue from the show. This thing is supernaturally resilient, no matter how hard we may try to bend it out of shape.\nThere has been a lot of talk about the breadth and reach of this World Cup, the idea of new powers, a new world order. It is a good propaganda line for the organisers and host broadcasters. In reality eight of the last 16, five of the last eight, two of the final four were European nations. We did get Morocco and the thrill of a first African semi-finalist but even this is more complex. This was also a diaspora triumph, a triumph of expert management and fine domestic facilities, combined with multiculturalism.\n\nSeven starting players were products of European club academies and European childhoods, gelled into place with a Moroccan sense of togetherness that seemed to offer a model of how to live these many identities. This story is more nuanced, more interesting than simple parping regionalism.\nOtherwise the entertainment was derived from dramatic finishes and in-game tension as much as high quality. Take away Messi and there were no really exceptional teams outside France and Argentina. England, Croatia and Morocco were the second rank here. This is some pretty functional football. But they produced great games, plenty of goals, good refereeing and a welcome absence of red cards.\nFernando Santos single-handedly saved football by dropping Ronaldo and playing a 21-year-old who scored a hat-trick, one of the great managerial flexes of all time. Croatia were a captivating bunch of super-smart dinosaurs. Brazil did Brazil.\n\nAnd it was all a good job too because a bad World Cup on the pitch might just have fatally wounded the whole idea of international football given the backdrop to this thing.\nOtherwise Messi wrote the story of Qatar 2022 and did so while manifesting the key paradox of Big Football. Here is a player whose talent expresses freedom, beauty, love, imagination, uplifting human qualities. Messi is basically a sporting unicorn \u2013 and a highly unusual unicorn, the kind of unicorn even other unicorns look at and say: \u2018That unicorn, he\u2019s a bit special.\u2019\nOften the word \u201cplayer\u201d can feel like a ludicrous anachronism. Play is fun, joy, gratuitous things. Modern football, meanwhile, is a suffocating matrix, all constriction and physicality. Somehow Messi, the greatest footballer of the age, is also a player.\nAt the same time his professional existence is still lived out as a tool of despotic regimes, pegged out around the commoditised global game. Messi is the face of Qatar\u2019s propaganda World Cup. Messi is Saudi Arabia\u2019s tourism ambassador. It is almost an act of unintended rebellion to be all these things and to perform the way he does, the rebel heart to Argentinian football expressed not through any conscious act of will, not through guns and cops and drugs, but through a way of playing, the whisper of a free spirit.\n\nAside from all this, we still have the death. Not to mention suffering, corruption and grotesque monarchical vanity. So many things at this World Cup have seemed to be screaming in horror, from the open mouths of the gleaming stadium roofs, to the frightening cartoon avatars of the Bein Sports graphics, to the mind-numbing universal public address system.\nThe stage was haunted by ghosts. The People\u2019s World Cup was also the dead people\u2019s World Cup. We can argue over the final tally, which is also part of the horror, the lack of care, death as part of life, in the words of the dear old Supreme Delivery Committee. But this has been football as an accessory of the overclass world, football as VVIP product.\nThere are other costs. An otherworldly chill settled over Lusail Iconic Stadium an hour before kick-off in the World Cup final. Rain? Guilt? No, this was the giant-scale air-conditioning, brainchild of Qatar\u2019s famous \u201cDr Cool\u201d, whose indirect carbon footprint must be one of the most terrifyingly vast on earth. Hopefully Dr Cool also recycles and rides a bike. But we all pay for this in the end.\nOtherwise this was also a World Cup of illusion and fakery, football in the age of populism and post-truth. Concerns about a lack of care by the hosts have been routinely dismissed with useful, dead-end moral relativism; even described, absurdly, as racism (reality: few things are as racist as a structurally racist state carelessly harming migrant workers).\n\nFifa introduced the idea of \u201cunnatural lost time\u201d at this World Cup and Qatar 2022 has often felt like this, from the artful fakery of Stadium 974, which pretended to be an ecological triumph, to the strange dance of the conscience-laundering armbands, presumably long since burnt on the Al-Wakrah docks like the 1970 squad\u2019s van full of corned beef; to the malleable quality of Infantino who believes in revisiting European oppression from 3,000 years ago, but maintains he can\u2019t be held responsible for what happened at Fifa five years before he became president. Feeling dizzy yet?\nAnd this is the final thing worth saying about Qatar 2022, which in the end is simply a mirror to the world. Qatar is not an aberration. Qatar is the way the world works, presented to you with brutal, unapologetic clarity. Other nations may have checks and balances, trades unions, democracy, free speech, ways of mitigating the brutality of rule by an overclass. Doha may also have wilfully neglected its duty of care to migrant workers, explicitly targeting nations suffering most from climate change to build its World Cup, because desperate people are cheap people. This does not have to happen.\n\nBut in the end the real question about migrant workers is why are migrant workers so poor they are willing to do this, and who benefits from that world? Qatar 2022 may be a bloodstained thing but it is also a light and a lens, a crib-sheet on how the world works. Not to mention its superheated carbon centre. Qatar is the power source. Qatar is the winner: this was not an aberration, but a prophecy.\nA final note on what might happen next, beyond the US, Mexico and Canada in 2026 and our newly opened book on the morality of World Cup hosts. It was interesting that Michel Platini declined Emmanuel Macron\u2019s invitation to attend the World Cup final. Platini is said to be unwilling to meet Infantino and his circle, whom he sees as malevolent architects of his own downfall.\nThere is genuine enmity here. Platini is also free now of criminal charges. Infantino, newly re-elected, cosying up to world leaders, looks bulletproof. But if anyone knows anything about the things no one knows about, it is perhaps Platini, who doesn\u2019t seem to be done just yet."

Van Gaal, when was asked about the scrutiny the latest display received, said: \u201cI agree with the criticism but we are unbeaten for 17 matches and I think if you look at the goal difference too we deserve some respect.\u201d  The Netherlands have conceded only 14 times during that run, which began in August 2021, but Van Gaal brushed off the notion that his previous statement saying that they are at Qatar 2022 to win the World Cup could be counterproductive. \u201cI hope this is no pressure at all because always you have to identify the goal and if you don\u2019t identify the purposes and say the quarter-finals is enough you won\u2019t become world champions,\u201d the 71-year-old said. \u201cWe never said we will become world champions, I said we have a chance to become world champions and the players are convinced of that. If you want to become a world champion you will have to be capable of beating everyone.\u201d A noticeably relaxed Van Gaal made a joke when Frenkie de Jong was asked if he was in good health after it had been observed that the playmaker appeared a bit pale when sitting alongside the Dutch coach at the tournament media centre in Doha. \u201cThank you for saying Frenkie looks a bit pale because I\u2019ve seen that as well,\u201d Van Gaal said. \u201cThe rest of us have been lying at the poolside. Me not so much but my mother lay in her coffin with rosy cheeks when she died, it\u2019s a matter of genes.\u201d De Jong confirmed he is fine to face Qatar beyond having a sore throat and not being able to sleep well recently. Van Gaal, meanwhile, explained why he has confidence in Andries Noppert, the goalkeeper who made his debut against Ecuador despite having made only 32 Eredivisie appearances across six years. \u201cHe has a personality of which we feel that he wouldn\u2019t be very [overawed] by this World Cup, which is important,\u201d the coach said. \u201cWe assessed how he played in the last weeks to the World Cup \u2013 he was in good shape and the other argument, the other reason why we picked him, is that he can give the ball short in the build up which is what we want.\u201d Van Gaal, who recently had treatment for prostate cancer, came out of retirement to lead the Netherlands again and he suggested he may be open to offers beyond the tournament. \u201cIf we become world champions then the football world is a very opportunistic world. You never know,\u201d he said."

The 18-year-old, who is the youngest Socceroo since Harry Kewell in 1996, has a fervent following at his home town of Shepparton in northern Victoria, where the community is gathering on Saturday night for the second group-stage match.  Agoness Kuol has watched her nephew grow up to play at the highest level, and she says his family and the South Sudanese community in Shepparton could not be prouder. \u201cHe makes us so happy. It makes us feel like we can fly, watching him play at the World Cup. And [we\u2019re] so happy for his parents, who worked so hard for this. \u201cHe has always, always loved playing football, since he was in kindergarten. But he\u2019s a good boy, he would come with us to church and would always stay with his family.\u201d The South Sudanese community has been growing in Shepparton, where just over 17% of the population were born overseas, compared with 12.4% for regional Victoria.  The communities have created spaces for themselves, including the South Sudanese community, which will host a viewing party of the next Socceroos match at St Paul\u2019s African House. Kuol says there will be food and dancing before the match, which begins at 9pm local time, and that the community is celebrating no matter the result. \u201cWe are a very connected community here. We\u2019re around 40 families and we all know each other. We all know Garang as well and we will be praying for him. \u201cHe\u2019s representing Australia, but also Shepparton and also South Sudan. He has three teams, three groups behind him. And we\u2019re all so proud of him.\u201d  Kuol was born in Egypt after his family fled Sudan. They moved to Australia as refugees before settling in Shepparton and becoming part of the fabric of the community there. Khadiga Abdalla will be cooking a series of traditional dishes for the viewing party at St Paul\u2019s African House. \u201cEveryone is very excited, we\u2019ve been working hard to prepare,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re always told we need more chairs, more food because more people are coming. But who knows what will happen in the match. \u201cSaturday night is for everyone \u2013 mums, dads, kids, we\u2019re all going to be there. No one would miss Garang at the World Cup.\u201d  Abdalla says her own children know Garang, making their pride in Garang\u2019s achievements all the more powerful. \u201cWe\u2019re all one family, together. My kids have been so excited, they didn\u2019t sleep for days before the last match, and they can\u2019t wait for the second one. \u201cHe\u2019s playing for all Australian and African kids.\u201d One of Kuol\u2019s early coaches at the Gosford Suns, Craig Carley, tells the Guardian that watching the youngster play at the World Cup gives him goosebumps. \u201cEvery single time I\u2019ve seen Garang on TV, it makes the hairs on my arm stand up, because I know how exciting he is. And I know how proud he has made people.  \u201cHe plays with no fear,\u201d Carley says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise me in the slightest what he\u2019s achieved \u2026 I know he can play at the highest level.\u201d Shepparton has been represented in the Socceroos before \u2013 by Robert Enes in the 1990s \u2013 but there hasn\u2019t been a player to break through the ranks from the town since.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Kuol\u2019s rise, which has now included being snapped up by English Premier League club Newcastle, has brought a sense of excitement to the town. \u201cWe pride ourselves on being the regional sporting capital of Australia,\u201d the Shepparton mayor, Shane Sali, says. \u201cAnd to have someone from our own backyard, who has grown up here playing in the junior ranks, and now on the international stage, is just something special.\u201d Sali is adamant Kuol should start Australia\u2019s second group game after coming off the bench in the loss to France on match-day one. \u201cFor them to win, he needs to start. You\u2019ve got to buy into the excitement he brings, and fingers crossed he starts a lot earlier. \u201cHe\u2019s a generational talent. Get him on early. We\u2019re all behind him.\u201d"

                    "body": "And here\u2019s one we made earlier. Please ignore the noises from the basement. We, the sovereign state of Qatar, are here to restore the lost soul of your prized social-sporting institutions. And it\u2019s all going to be fine. There was an unavoidable significance this week in the coincidence of two apparently unrelated events. First the suggestion that Qatar really may have a serious interest in buying Manchester United, or at least enough interest to add its name to the list before Friday\u2019s \u201csoft\u201d deadline. And second the deliciously more-ish scenes of chaos at Paris Saint-Germain as the current Qatari football project confirmed its status as the most thrillingly grotesque entity in European club football.  It is worth stating this simply: Qatar buying United would be an absolute disaster for the team, the Premier League and Uefa. And not just for reasons such as human rights abuses, which nobody really seems to care about, or the fact nation-state ownership is by definition unhealthy, and foreign policy never benign. In the end none of this really seems to cut through. What makes an impact is basic footballing competence. We hear talk already of how \u201cclassy\u201d Newcastle\u2019s Saudi owners are, which is no doubt a huge comfort to those the state has classily beheaded, or gay people in Saudi being (classily) tortured. If this is what really counts then we do have a model of what being owned by Qatar looks like. Witness the state of PSG, a job interview for the role of Manchester United owner so inept it serves to be ranked up there with the one where you accidentally called the senior partner of a magic circle law firm \u201cDad\u201d or punched the head of HR in the clavicle going for a handshake. Qatar is, of course, more than just one thing. Past incompetence is no guarantee of future balls-ups. No doubt the relevant \u201cfund\u201d would build some really good bridges in Salford and generally machine-gun this thing with money. But the fact remains Qatar has made a mind-numbingly awful hash of running PSG in a way that would play specifically to United\u2019s own vices and destroy in an instant the cautious progress made under Erik ten Hag. It is easy to lose track of the sheer level of inanity and dysfunction at PSG. But it was there in its many shades before, during and after the 1-0 defeat by Bayern Munich in Paris on Tuesday, an occasion when the team looked more than ever like a version of football as reimagined by an uncompromising nine-year-old video game enthusiast. The culture at the club is perhaps best summed up by the \u201cbien manger, bien dormir\u201d affair that has dominated PSG celebrity gossip channels in the days since. This was a comment made by Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 to Canal+ after the game, urging his teammates to eat and sleep properly before the return in Munich, taken as a public slap-down of Neymar, who seems unusually intent on having late-night parties at his house in Bougival. Most recently there was his birthday party (Neymar is, lest we forget, eight years old) plus other boisterous shindigs that have led the Bougival mayor to describe Neymar as \u201ca disrespectful individual\u201d who is \u201cprodigiously annoying\u201d.  Which seems fair enough and indeed demonstrably true. It also captures perfectly a club that has come to mirror its ownership, not so much a sporting enterprise as a kind of royal court, a power struggle between princelings and dukes, where Sir Kylian, demi- emir of Paris, is free to fritter away his surplus brilliance overseeing his sub-empire. The day after that potential season-ending defeat, it just kept rolling on. A round of key power meetings were breathlessly staged, meetings that seemed of more consequence than the actual game: Lionel Messi\u2019s dad and the club board; Todd Boehly and Nasser al-Khelaifi. Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani and Emmanuel Macron at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace. All of it confirming a sense of a sporting institution that is essentially a celebrity gossip mag made flesh (What Kiki Really Said To Ney!). The wider frustration here is that this just feels like such a vast and pointless waste, making a silly star show out of a one-city club that could be something profound, that sits at the centre of the most stupendous player production model of the age, that has the banlieues as its feeding ground, that has boundless funds and time to develop a player culture. Instead we have this. A celebrity construct that has already wrecked the European transfer system once, that seems to no longer hide its political influence, which just keeps chewing its way through good and thorough managers because all must be subservient to the egotism of star players. Which brings us back to United and to Erik. Why have things begun to settle? Because just enough power and authority has been given to a serious, ascetic man who cares only about football, who has lanced some of the celebrity waxwork stuff, who has invested in a useful Dutch beanpole, who has publicly disciplined Marcus Rashford, then publicly backed him, then made him into the high-grade homegrown standard bearer he was always meant to be.  Nothing has been achieved yet but just look at the easy gains, the uplift from simply trusting in a serious, competent person and neglecting the fripperies. Throwing Qatar at this thing would demand the opposite model, the one to which United have already been vulnerable as a grand old club trading off its past. It is as though the engine crew of the Titanic have finally worked out how to stop this thing listing into the waves, only to be informed that their new captain is a horse in a top hat who has decided to set sail immediately for the nearest and sparkliest ice shelf. Plus it would be disastrous for Uefa, which has described the multi-club ownership model as a threat to football\u2019s \u201cintegrity\u201d but has no real power to stop it when a fund can just become another fund. Not to mention deeply uncomfortable for the Premier League, which has charged Manchester City with offences allegedly related to connected sponsorships. Welcome, National Bank of Qatar! And yet for all the potential barriers the fact remains this thing will happen if the emir wants it. This is how football works, how deregulated industries work, how energy dependence on Qatar works. In which case the current, fragile little age of Erik may just come to look like its own brief shaft of light."

                    "body": "When British journalists were writing about the treatment of migrant workers building World Cup stadiums, they might have expected to receive a phone call from a Qatari based in Doha, pushing back on their accusations. Instead, newspapers found themselves being contacted by Britons such as George Pascoe\u2011Watson, a former political editor of the Sun, challenging the premise of their story and offering a more pro-Qatari viewpoint.\nPascoe-Watson is a senior partner at Portland, a high-end London-based public relations and lobbying company founded by Tim Allan, a former adviser to Tony Blair. It is one of many British\u2011based firms who benefited from spinning on behalf of the Qatari government before the World Cup, pushing the Gulf nation\u2019s case in the media, and arguing against negative coverage.\nBecause while England once again failed to win the World Cup, London\u2019s lobbyists and lawyers working on the competition have done their best to ensure a fortune\u2019s coming home.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a very well\u2011organised and well-resourced campaign in place,\u201d said Nicholas McGeehan, a longtime campaigner on migrant workers\u2019 rights in the region. \u201cArguments have been constructed very effectively to deflect attention from fair and proportionate criticism.\u201d\nOne of the reasons for the heavy presence of British PR representatives is that criticism of Qatar\u2019s bid \u2013 whether the alleged corruption (denied by Qatar) involved in securing the hosting rights, the treatment of migrant workers, or its lack of LGBTQ+ rights \u2013 has been led by UK newspapers such as the Guardian and the Sunday Times. While German and Scandinavian news outlets have also investigated these issues, it is the English-language media which are easier to read around the world.\nPortland declined to comment on the nature of its work in Qatar, although it has an office in Doha and has been working on various Qatari-related contracts since at least 2014. Early challenges included dealing with the detention of a BBC journalist in the country and helping to set up a blog that criticised opponents of the country hosting the tournament. But as time progressed, journalists reporting on the World Cup preparations said the efforts to improve Qatar\u2019s image in the British press became smarter and more subtle.\n\nIn particular, they receive pushback from representatives of Hassan al-Thawadi, the secretary general of the World Cup\u2019s organising committee. He is a Qatari national who attended sixth-form college in Scunthorpe before studying law at the University of Sheffield and is said to take British criticism personally. One British reporter who has dealt with Thawadi claimed: \u201cHe\u2019s absolutely convinced that he\u2019s this liberal guy who really cares about workers\u2019 rights and conditions. He\u2019s mortified that the world would think of him as just another uncaring Qatari. He phones his PR people in fury each time there\u2019s a negative headline about what\u2019s happening in Qatar being down to him. And he may be less worse than the vast majority of the Qatari elite, because they don\u2019t care about migrant workers.\u201d\nWith UK newspapers often uploading their stories to their websites around midnight, newsdesks became used to Qataris on a different time zone waking up in the early hours of the morning and demanding alterations.\nOne Briton who played an important role in the World Cup press operation is Richard Conway, who as a BBC Sport correspondent in 2018 produced an upbeat report on the preparations for the Qatar World Cup while riding a camel across the desert. A few months later he left journalism to form his own PR agency and has been working exclusively on the Qatar World Cup for several years. Journalists who have dealt with him say he has adopted a hands-off approach, acting as an informal conduit and enabling conversations by inviting critics of the World Cup and prominent newspaper journalists to off-the-record meetings with senior Qatari officials at London hotels. \nMany Britons also work for the Qatari division of Teneo Blue Rubicon, a PR agency that has worked hard to promote the country, while journalists who have written critically about the country have also received legal letters from the law firm Carter Ruck. Neither company returned a request for comment on the nature of their work in the country.\nOne of the gripes among Qatari officials is that they have received criticism for adopting similar tactics to regional rivals such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The Guardian has previously reported on extravagantly funded events held in London where MPs and former footballers received large fees from an unknown source, all with the intention of building opposition to the Qatar World Cup. The organiser of that event also approached the former Conservative election chief Sir Lynton Crosby \u2013 whose company already conducted work for Saudi Arabia \u2013 and discussed a \u00a35.5m influence campaign to strip Qatar of the right to host the World Cup.\nThose nations also spent tens of millions of pounds on lobbying campaigners aimed at western politicians and media outlets, with Qatar feeling they had the right to fight fire with fire.\nDespite this, there\u2019s little doubt among Qatar\u2019s critics that the decision to host the World Cup has ultimately transformed the country\u2019s global standing in the media. Low expectations and ethical concerns were ultimately dialled down in media coverage as the football began. Paid influencers have flooded TikTok with upbeat stories from Doha.\nAnd according to McGeehan, who now runs the FairSquare NGO, one of the most effective tactics during the tournament has been to argue that criticism of Qatar is Orientalism, or anti-Arab: \u201cA good PR person understands how that is going to play well with particular audiences who are sensitive to charges like that. It led to people who would normally be considered as allies in this to essentially engage in the counter-debate, rather than the debate what the issues are.\u201d"

This Thanksgiving has been renamed \u201cdanksgiving\u201d by some as so many states have now legalised weed but Colbert warned that it \u201ccould be a gateway to harder holidays like Crackmas, Rosh Hashanah and St Patrick\u2019s Day\u201d. The first licences for recreational marijuana have also finally been produced in New York. \u201cNew Yorkers are gonna be so excited to finally try marijuana,\u201d Colbert joked. Seth Meyers  On Late Night, Seth Meyers spoke about Joe Biden\u2019s annual turkey pardoning quoting a joke he made: \u201cThe only red wave this season would be if his dog knocked over the cranberry sauce.\u201d He responded with a groan: \u201cToo bad his dog didn\u2019t have the presence of mind to knock over the microphone.\u201d Meyers also added that it \u201cwould be the slowest wave ever\u201d before revealing the true meaning of Thanksgiving: \u201cGetting high with your weird cousins when things get too tense inside.\u201d Biden has said that he will make a decision about running for 2024 in the month between Thanksgiving and Christmas. \u201cWhatever you think of him, it\u2019s impressive that an 80-year-old man is planning that far ahead,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I was 80 I don\u2019t think I\u2019d plan on bingeing a show that had more than one season.\u201d Maxwell Frost, the first Gen Z member of Congress, has said that he believes that Biden does adequately represent the values of his generation. Meyers agreed as he \u201calso knows what it\u2019s like to live in a house you\u2019ll never own\u201d. Jimmy Kimmel  On Jimmy Kimmel Live!, the host also spoke about Trump\u2019s taxes. \u201cWe may actually finally maybe get to see what Darth Tax Evader has been hiding from us,\u201d he joked. He said that Trump was very upset and played a montage of the times he has promised to release his taxes which is \u201cmore times than he promised to release Melania\u201d. This week also saw a report that Trump\u2019s team is requesting that the FBI return personal items that were seized from Mar-a-Lago, including golf shirts and multiple pictures of Celine Dion. \u201cIs it possible he\u2019s even weirder than we thought he was?\u201d Kimmel asked Trump is also reportedly \u201cpissed\u201d that Republicans don\u2019t want him to help the controversial Georgian candidate Herschel Walker as he prepares for a runoff as it could hurt his chances. \u201cHerschel Walker doesn\u2019t need Donald Trump out there to make him look bad, he\u2019s doing a very good job of that himself,\u201d he joked. This week also saw the annual arrival of the Christmas tree to the White House, \u201ca presidential tradition since Joe Biden was a teenager in 1889\u201d."

                    "body": "Marcus Rashford says he would volunteer to take a kick in a penalty shootout at the World Cup and is actively hoping the scenario arises, as he reflected on his remarkable comeback story.\nThe England forward missed in the shootout defeat against Italy in the Euro 2020 final and endured racist abuse on social media. He then laboured sorely at Manchester United last season, also losing his place in the England squad. \n\nInjuries were a factor; he underwent shoulder surgery in August of last year. But after a reset over the summer, when he pushed himself through a punishing fitness regime, he has recovered his form, scoring vital Premier League goals to earn the recall from Gareth Southgate.\nRashford scored within seconds of coming on as a substitute in England\u2019s 6-2 win against Iran in their World Cup opener \u2013 his first involvement since the penalty miss against Italy \u2013 and he is champing at the bit to feature in their final group-phase tie against Wales on Tuesday. \nRashford\u2019s confidence is back, as evidenced by his reply to the question about whether he would have any doubts over stepping up again in a shootout.\n\n\u201cNo, not at all,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are big moments and, as an individual, I\u2019ve always been comfortable with them. I enjoy being in big moments so I\u2019m hoping that we get to take another penalty in the tournament. I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d\nSouthgate introduced Rashford from the bench in England\u2019s second game \u2013 the 0-0 draw against the USA on Friday \u2013 playing him off the right, as he had done against Iran. Rashford prefers to play off the flanks but he would jump at the chance to start at centre-forward against Wales if Southgate chose to rest Harry Kane. England need only to avoid a four\u2011goal defeat in order to qualify and Kane has had a knock to the top of his foot.\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s ready and I\u2019m raring to go,\u201d Rashford said. \u201cWe are on the biggest stage in the world and it\u2019s an opportunity for all of us to go and take. I\u2019ve been on the bench but you\u2019re waiting for your opportunity. \n\u201cWe are not disjointed as a collective and, in tournament football, that is needed because it\u2019s going to be the squad that wins. It\u2019s impossible for us to win the tournament just off our starting players. There is a huge sense of togetherness and belief that we can go a long way.\u201d\n\nEngland were booed off by some fans after the USA game when the performance was flat. But Rashford offered a reminder that results had to be the priority. \u201cAs players, we always want to play our best football but it\u2019s not possible,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou have to learn to win games when you\u2019re not playing well because it\u2019s unrealistic to think you\u2019re going to play your best every single game.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a nice feeling [to be booed] but you don\u2019t need fans to boo us to know we\u2019ve not played as well as we could have. It was a feeling that was mutual and it\u2019s not just the players that started, it\u2019s the full group.\n\u201cYou do sometimes question whether you would have changed things in the lead\u2011up to a game but that\u2019s natural because as players you want to win as many games as you can. We can\u2019t be so negative about it. We are in a good position and we just need to win against Wales. It\u2019s not often teams win all three group games.\u201d\n\nRashford won the first of his 48 caps under Roy Hodgson in May 2016 and he was involved at Euro 2016, which ended in the humiliating defeat against Iceland. Hodgson departed thereafter. Rashford said that Southgate had greatly improved the setup \u2013 beginning with the work on the training pitch.\n\u201cTraining\u2019s been good here for the lads who haven\u2019t been getting as many minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I feel for this squad it\u2019s never been an issue, especially since Gareth\u2019s been managing. Maybe before it was a bit of an issue in terms of quality of training and people\u2019s dedication to training.\n\u201cI was only there for a short period of time before [Southgate] but the standard of training wasn\u2019t as high. For players it\u2019s black and white. If you aren\u2019t training well, you can\u2019t expect to play well or go into games and win just because you think you are better players. You have to put the work in and earn the right to win matches. For me it\u2019s two different sides of a coin. \n\u201cI don\u2019t think it takes a genius to see how we\u2019ve improved since 2016. You cannot really compare the two situations and you cannot compare the feeling around the camp. \nWe\u2019re a really strong team. We don\u2019t fear anybody. It\u2019s up to us to prove we have what it takes to win the World Cup. Do I believe we have? Yes.\u201d"

Son sustained a fracture around his left eye during Tottenham\u2019s game at Marseille last week and had surgery on Friday. The Spurs manager, Antonio Conte, said on Sunday he expected the 30-year-old to be fit for the World Cup and Son provided an update on Instagram on Wednesday. After saying he had \u201creceived a lot of strength\u201d from messages of support, he wrote: \u201cPlaying for your country at the World Cup is the dream of so many children growing up, just as it was one of mine too. I won\u2019t miss this for the world. I can\u2019t wait to represent our beautiful country.\u201d Son posted a message in Korean and one below in English and a section not translated into English raised the possibility that although he would be in the squad and fitted with a mask, it was not certain he would play. His status with South Korea is such that he will be part of the squad even if there is a doubt over his availability.  \u201cWhen I think of the masks you\u2019ve been patiently wearing for over two years, my mask that I\u2019ll be wearing at the World Cup matches is nothing,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf there is only 1% chance, I will look at that possibility.\u201d Man\u00e9 is similarly important to Senegal. Bayern did not specify how serious his injury could be but said he would not be available to face Schalke on Saturday. Man\u00e9 was substituted against Werder Bremen on Tuesday and the initial word from the assistant coach Dino Toppm\u00f6ller was that it was \u201cnothing too serious and his participation in the World Cup should not be in jeopardy\u201d. But far less positive reports emerged on Wednesday, including that he was out of the World Cup, before Bayern said in a statement: \u201cFurther examinations will follow in the coming days. FC Bayern is also in contact with the medical staff of the Senegalese Football Association.\u201d "

                    "body": "It seems as if every person who encounters him has declared Garang Kuol ready to make an impact at this World Cup \u2013 now we know he agrees with them. The much-talked-about 18-year-old is in the frame for at least one cameo off the bench during Australia\u2019s group matches in Qatar. But if he was nervous about facing the likes of France, Tunisia and Denmark, you wouldn\u2019t know it. \u201cOf course,\u201d he said matter of factly when asked if he can make a difference for the Socceroos. \u201cIt\u2019s all about just having confidence in yourself and being ruthless, and having that mindset to want to create something and make an impact. \u201cIt\u2019s a very exciting experience for me. I\u2019ve been watching the Socceroos for a long time and the World Cup\u2019s the biggest stage, so that\u2019s just where I want to prove myself.\u201d  The hype about Kuol is real, and warranted. Despite having not started a single senior game for his club, Central Coast Mariners, the teenager dazzled in an Australian All Stars friendly against Barcelona in May and earned praise from manager Xavi Hernandez, who said \u201cit\u2019s incredible that he\u2019s 17 years old\u201d. Since then he has become the youngest player to receive a Socceroos call-up since Harry Kewell and will become a Newcastle United player in January, with a promise from the club\u2019s manager, Eddie Howe, to be patient in his development. In short, he is largely untested but also one of Australia\u2019s most dangerous assets. He is the second-youngest player at Qatar 2022 \u2013 he is 66 days older than Germany\u2019s Youssoufa Moukoko \u2013 and will become the youngest Socceroo to play should he get the chance. For him that\u2019s \u201cjust a label\u201d; what matters more is proving himself against reigning champions France on Tuesday night (Wednesday 6am AEDT). \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say intimidation,\u201d he said. \u201cI find it more exciting, to see what you can do against players of that calibre. \u201cI don\u2019t really pay attention to what\u2019s said around me. I\u2019m mainly just focused on what I do in the field and training and the game.  \u201cIf I\u2019m not playing well, I\u2019m not going to look at what\u2019s online. What I do on the field makes me happy or gives me motivation to keep pushing forward.\u201d Kuol\u2019s lack of conditioning for a full 90 minutes means he will likely be used sparingly by coach Graham Arnold, who has told the prodigious talent he has \u201cplenty of belief\u201d in him. But he did participate in a two-hour intra-team game during training this week at the Socceroos\u2019 Doha base, the Aspire Academy. \u201cIntensity was a killer, I\u2019m still getting used to it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe boys play quick, the ball just zips around. It\u2019s a whole lot of chasing. We\u2019re trying to mirror what France would do.\u201d \u201cSpeaking with Arnie, it\u2019s been very chill. He hasn\u2019t really said much. He just told me he has plenty of belief in me. I\u2019ve just got to keep training well and to prove myself.\u201d Kuol has support within the playing group, in particular from fellow South Sudanese refugees Awer Mabil and Thomas Deng.  Born in Egypt in 2004 after his family fled South Sudan, he moved to Australia as a baby and settled in Shepparton, Victoria, growing up with seven siblings including older brother Alou, 21, who is on the books of VfB Stuttgart and is also a Mariners product. \u201cIt\u2019s a journey we\u2019ve all been on as a family,\u201d Kuol said. \u201cThree years back my mum\u2019d driving me to Melbourne every two weeks \u2013 two hours there, two hours back. They\u2019re very happy for me. They\u2019re just telling me to do my best and make them proud. \u201cThere\u2019s people that spur me in the right direction. Obviously my coach at the Mariners, my parents, older brothers, these two next to me, they all play a part in the way I carry myself out and take everything in.\u201d Kuol, Mabil and Deng represent the changing face of Australia\u2019s national team in line with the country\u2019s multi-cultural society. \u201cWe have a motivation to try to [represent] not just the Australian community but also kids from our community especially, because sometimes it\u2019s easy to go down the wrong path,\u201d Mabil said. \u201cAs a kid, I wanted to see somebody from my community showing us the way. So that\u2019s our motivation, to try and push higher so we can show these kids the way.\u201d Those kids include Kuol. \u201cHe\u2019s been good since he\u2019s come in,\u201d Deng said. \u201cHe\u2019s just a young kid who wants to play football. He\u2019s just full of confidence and he\u2019s got a really bright future ahead of him. We\u2019re just trying to help him learn in the right way.\u201d"

Since then, BA has changed the route, so all flights to south-east Asia transit through Qatar. Since I have HIV, which is classed as a disability under UK law, I am not legally allowed to enter Qatar and so I cannot book flights to the region with BA. I therefore need a refund so that I can book with another airline. However, BA customer service took a month to inform me that it operates a no-refunds policy for eVouchers. One operative actually suggested I call the Qatar embassy to check if I\u2019d be deported if I flew into the country.KC, London If BA had listened to your predicament and cashed in your voucher, it might have retained a loyal customer for future flights and spared itself a public shaming. Instead, its robotic refusal to look beyond its small print has caused you weeks of distress. As it happens, the airline performed a U-turn last year and allowed customers who were due to fly between March and November 2020 to trade in their vouchers for a refund. Your flight had been due to depart in January 2021 and is not eligible. BA\u2019s reasoning is that it wasn\u2019t in a position to offer refunds before November 2020, whereas passengers due to fly after that had the choice of a voucher or cash. That \u201cchoice\u201d is debatable. BA, along with other airlines, amended its website to make vouchers the only online option. Customers who wanted their money back were required to queue indefinitely on a congested phone line. The airline only agreed to refund you for a service it could not provide after I took the matter up.

While hosting the World Cup is often a once-in-a lifetime opportunity, given the global interest in hosting the Mondial, the world can give Qatar a thumbs up for delivering on its promises.\u201d\nThe Gulf Times singled out Qatari Ghanim al-Muftah for praise, saying he had \u201cshone\u201d at the opening ceremony. Born with Caudal regression syndrome, a disorder that impairs the development of the lower spine, Muftah is a local social media celebrity who walks on his hands, and who, in dialogue with Morgan Freeman, spoke on inclusion and diversity and quoted the Qur\u2019an.\n\nThe pro-government semi-official paper of Qatar, Al Raya, went beyond the call of duty in praising the man who drove Qatar to bid for the World Cup, the Emir. In an editorial following the Emir\u2019s speech at the opening ceremony, it wrote: \u201cWe are overwhelmed with feelings of love, gratitude and pride in our wise leadership, which always strives to raise the name of Qatar above the cloud.\u201d\nMuhammad Al-Marri in the Al-Watan wrote: \u201cThe truth shone like a sun in the middle of the day. And the dream turned into a tangible reality. Those who know Qatar, its leadership, and its people bet on its victory and won. As for those who doubted and promoted lies and spread fallacies, their loss was heavy and their end painful.\u201d\n\nAnd the verdict on the football? Also a painful loss.\nIn a press conference after the match, Qatar\u2019s Spanish coach, F\u00e9lix S\u00e1nchez, was pressed on whether modifying the formation and style of play of the team had lead to the loss. He told reporters the national team still has a lot to offer in its next match \u2013 against Senegal on Friday \u2013 and they did not appear at their true level.\nFocus for much criticism had been the goalkeeper Saad al-Sheeb, who flapped at a cross leading to Ecuador\u2019s early disallowed goal, and then conceded the penalty with which Enner Valencia opened the scoring. After the game Sheeb insisted: \u201cThere are two remaining matches in which we can make amends.\u201d\nIn its match report the Peninsular raised questions about the team\u2019s preparations, with journalist Fawad Hussain writing: \u201cQatar fans were expecting a much better show. The hosts failed to register a single shot on target in their historic match. Perhaps, Qatar succumbed to the pressure of winning on their World Cup debut in front of their home fans. Al Annabi didn\u2019t look a side said to be the best prepared team of this World Cup, with all the players being kept out of the country\u2019s top flight league to train at isolated camps offshore for more than four months.\u201d\nIn the Gulf Times, Sahan Bidappa wrote: \u201cThe manner in which they crumbled against Ecuador would have disappointed the home fans,\u201d many of whom were observed leaving long before the match had ended. The paper lamented: \u201cThis was supposed to be Qatar\u2019s easiest fixture.\u201d\nBidappa said: \u201cAs the Qatar players failed to impose themselves on the game, coach S\u00e1nchez stared at the roof of the tent-shaped architecture marvel Al Bayt Stadium, wondering what he or his players could have done differently on the night. In reality, not much,.\u201d\nHe added of the team \u201con the biggest stage of their lives, Qatar players looked frozen, clearly overawed by the historic occasion. This was a nervous and disjointed performance.\u201d"

Here is how you can watch the Socceroos in action as Australia take on Argentina in the last 16.\nWhen is the World Cup happening?\nIn a drastic departure from its usual June and July slot on the calendar, the 22nd edition of the showcase tournament kicked off on Monday 21 November. Hosts Qatar lifted the curtain against Ecuador, while Australia\u2019s national football team got their campaign up and running against defending champions France. Australia\u2019s next match of the group stage is against Denmark on Thursday morning, with a kick off time of 2am AEDT.\nSocceroos results/fixtures:\n\nFrance vs Australia \u2013 Wednesday 23 November, 6am AEDT\nTunisia vs Australia \u2013 Saturday 26 November, 9pm AEDT\nAustralia vs Denmark \u2013 Thursday 1 December, 2am AEDT\nArgentina v Australia \u2013 Sunday 4 December, 6am AEDT\n\n\nThis year\u2019s World Cup is the last to feature 32 teams before the competition expands to 48 in Canada, Mexico and the US in 2026. Those teams are divided into eight groups of four, with winners and runners-up from each to advance to the last 16. The knockout stage begins in the early hours of 4 December, the quarter-finals on 10 December and the semis on 14 December.\nThe 2022 World Cup final is scheduled to be played at 2am AEDT on Monday 19 December \u2013 which is also Qatar National Day. In total, 64 matches will be played over the course of the month-long tournament.\nHow can I watch and follow from Australia?\nThe Guardian is extensively liveblogging the tournament with live blogs for individual matches running throughout the group stage all the way until the final.\nSee our full Fifa World Cup 2022 coverage here, or go straight to our World Cup live blogs.\nOn the ground in Qatar will be a team of 15 Guardian journalists, including Socceroos correspondent Emma Kemp, all of whom will be reporting on both the football on the pitch and the myriad issues arising off it.\nFor those watching on their couches, every match can be seen live in a free-to-air exclusive broadcast on SBS, with live streams available on SBS On Demand. Eight of those live games will also be shown on SBS Viceland.\n\nWhere is it happening?\nIn another break with tradition, every ball at this World Cup will be kicked within a 55km radius in Doha, the capital of Qatar, making it the most geographically compact tournament in World Cup history. Eight stadiums will host the matches, ranging from the smallest \u2013 Stadium 974, Al Janoub Stadium and Al Thumama Stadium, which hold 40,000 \u2013 to the 80,000-capacity Lusail Stadium, which will host the final.\nWhy is it controversial?\nFrom Fifa\u2019s original decision to award hosting rights to Qatar 12 years ago to the country\u2019s record on human rights, via its treatment of migrant workers and discriminatory laws, this World Cup has attracted attention for the wrong reasons like no other before it. For many, the tournament sits uncomfortably, but it will provide an opportunity to use the spotlight on Qatar to draw attention to these issues.\n\nIs this the last major sporting event this year?\nIf you have been thinking there have been a quite a few World Cups going on of late, you would not be wrong. Between the T20 World Cup, the men\u2019s and women\u2019s Rugby League World Cups and the Women\u2019s Rugby World Cup, it\u2019s been a hectic end to the year. The tournament in Qatar is not quite the last one of the 2022 though \u2013 there\u2019s still the short course swimming championships in Melbourne and a couple of Test cricket series to come in December if you\u2019re not already completely over sport."

                    "body": "At some point late on a wild night in Lusail, Lionel Messi was asked what had happened out there. \u201cA bit of everything,\u201d he said. There had been four goals, eight penalties, 17 yellow cards and one red. In the end, there was only one winner, even if they had to win it twice. Maybe even three times. Or, to put it another way: as the Argentina goalkeeper, Emiliano Mart\u00ednez, departed the pitch, he did it with a defiant look in a Dutch direction, shouting his expletive-rich message in English to make sure it wasn\u2019t lost. It was that kind of night and at that point it wasn\u2019t over. \u201cWe suffered more than we should have done,\u201d Messi said. \u201cAt 2-0, we had it under control, we shouldn\u2019t have had to go to extra time, let alone penalties.\u201d  The Netherlands, though, had gone to Plan B, launching long, Luuk de Jong and Wout Weghorst sent on, got one back and then scored a superb free-kick to equalise on 101 minutes. And so now here they were on the spot, as if it wasn\u2019t tense enough already. This was what the Dutch wanted, the advantage apparently theirs, but Mart\u00ednez had saved from Virgil van Dijk and Steven Berghuis. Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez shot wide at 3-2, opening up the chance of another absurd shift when Luuk de Jong made it 3-3. Lautaro Mart\u00ednez had the last shot, the opportunity to send them through, the whole thing distilled. \u201cUgly,\u201d Lionel Scaloni called it. Fifa has since opened a disciplinary case against both teams. It\u2019s a long, lonely walk from the halfway line to the penalty spot, or at least it\u2019s supposed to be, but when Lautaro Mart\u00ednez\u2019s time came he had company. Asked where his thoughts had turned as he prepared to take the penalty that could carry Argentina into the World Cup semi-final, the striker, on as a sub, said: \u201cCalmness and confidence\u201d. Yeah, good luck with that. As he set off, four Dutch players followed him, led by Denzel Dumfries, and they were still surrounding him almost halfway there.  The assistant referee stepped in, sending them back, but there were words. De Jong, who had just scored his penalty, had a word. The goalkeeper, Andries Noppert, had more of them. Mart\u00ednez, though, thumped his penalty into the net and from the halfway line, Argentina\u2019s players began to sprint his way. When they set off, and for a while after as they ran, at least four \u2013 Leandro Paredes, Gonzalo Montiel, Germ\u00e1n Pezzella, Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi \u2013 and probably more turned to the Dutch players and celebrated in their faces. Otamendi raised his hands by his ears, taunting. \u201cI celebrated in their faces because on every penalty one of their players was saying things to ours,\u201d he said. All of them raced to the left corner and Lautaro Mart\u00ednez, except for Messi who ran for Emiliano Mart\u00ednez, lying in a star shape on the grass in the other corner. \u201cHe\u2019s a beast and today he responded again; we\u2019re grateful,\u201d the captain said. Soon, Dumfries was running in the same direction, trying to get at them. He had to be held back; not just calmed down but dragged out of there. It took three men. Just another confrontation, just another celebration, and those two things kept clashing. There had been a ball booted into the Dutch bench and flying tackles. Messi accused Weghorst of coming on and provoking everyone. Mart\u00ednez was not the first penalty taker followed across the field: \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda came to Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s rescue. You wouldn\u2019t have seen it on TV but there was also a pitch invader. Like Dumfries, it needed a lot of men to get him under control. And in the middle of it the referee was \u201cMateu-Lahozing\u201d again \u2013 and yes, that is a verb, or it should be.  \u201cIt\u2019s not easy,\u201d De Jong said. \u201cBut he seemed to blow very easily for Argentina.\u201d Messi and Emiliano Mart\u00ednez thought differently. Messi suggested it was possible sanctions that silenced him, while Mart\u00ednez wasn\u2019t afraid. \u201cHe was giving everything for them. He gave 10 minutes extra for no reason. He just wanted them to score. He\u2019s useless.\u201d That was not all the goalkeeper said, adding: \u201cVan Gaal said: \u2018If we go to penalties we win.\u2019 He should keep his mouth shut.\u201d Messi said so too in his way, standing there in front of the Dutch bench cupping his ears. Edgar Davids gazed back at him through dark glasses. The day before Louis van Gaal had suggested Messi doesn\u2019t run much. \u201cHe talks about good football but just boots the ball long. I don\u2019t like people talking before the game: that\u2019s not part of football,\u201d Messi said. This was, though. \u201cThere were things out there that shouldn\u2019t happen but, well, it\u2019s a World Cup quarter-final,\u201d Messi said.  By the time the players reappeared \u2013 and it was 3am when they did \u2013 they had all come round to that view, the battle done now. Asked if Argentina had been too aggressive, Nathan Ak\u00e9 said: \u201cNo, no, it shows how much they wanted to win the game; we wanted the same. That\u2019s where the emotion comes in and the fight comes in, that\u2019s just part of it, and we understand.\u201d The Manchester City player smiled, unable to answer why Messi hadn\u2019t been booked for a clear handball and when it came to the final celebration conceded: \u201cMaybe out of emotion, you do stuff \u2013 I don\u2019t think you can be too critical.\u201d They had been at \u201c1,000 revolutions,\u201d Pezzella said. \u201cIt\u2019s a World Cup, there is a lot on the line, it is hard. Everybody wants to win: the players on the bench, the staff. And you see this,\u201d De Jong said.  If Messi had suggested these were things that shouldn\u2019t happen, for all the moralising, it did help make it more of an event. It may also have been good for Argentina, a team forged in the fight, stronger the more they suffer. They had won that way, too. Messi interrupted a post-match interview to shout: \u201cWhat you looking at, fool.\u201d People in the tunnel believe Weghorst was waiting to suggest swapping shirts and he could be heard saying he wanted to shake hands, but between the language barrier and the fact this had already gone too far, it didn\u2019t turn out that way, Lautaro Mart\u00ednez and Sergio Ag\u00fcero among those stepping in. Lisandro Mart\u00ednez ended it, eventually heading towards the dressing room, saying: \u201cWe\u2019re more of a team.\u201d"

                    "body": "The human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell has been stopped by police in Qatar while staging a protest against the Gulf state\u2019s criminalisation of LGBTQ+ people. Tatchell\u2019s protest outside the National Museum of Qatar in the capital, Doha, comes less than a month before the start of the Fifa World Cup, which is expected to attract 1.2 million visitors from around the world. Reuters reported that two uniformed police officers and three plainclothes officials arrived at the scene, taking possession of his placard and photographing Tatchell\u2019s passport and other papers, and those of a man accompanying him. Reuters said police left after shaking hands with Tatchell, who remained on the sidewalk. Tatchell said he and a colleague, Simon Harris, who filmed the protest, were arrested and detained at the scene but the Qatari government has denied this. The veteran campaigner was holding a placard that read: \u201cQatar arrests, jails &amp; subjects LGBTs to \u2018conversion\u2019 #QatarAntiGay.\u201d The Peter Tatchell Foundation said it was the first LGBT+ protest in Qatar or any Gulf state. The incident adds to mounting pressure on Qatar over its treatment of the LGBTQ+ community and migrant workers, as well as other human rights concerns. Qatari law criminalises both male and female homosexuality, with sentences of one to three years for adults convicted of consensual gay or lesbian sex. Speaking via Zoom from Doha international airport, Tatchell said he was arrested and detained on the roadside by Qatari authorities for 49 minutes after protesting outside the museum for 35 minutes. He said: \u201cThe first carload of security officials arrived in an unmarked Land Rover and started taking photographs. Then about five minutes later a police car arrived. The police came over and took away the placard and began to interrogate me. \u201cThey then notice that my colleague was taking photographs and videos, [and] confiscated his phone, and deleted photographs and videos. They took our passports and boarding passes. We were not allowed to leave or to to continue the protest. \u201cThe police were not abusive or threatening. But they did make it clear that we should go to the airport and leave the country.\u201d Qatar\u2019s government communications office denied that Tatchell had been arrested. It said in a statement: \u201cRumours on social media that a representative from the Peter Tatchell Foundation has been arrested in Qatar are completely false and without merit. An individual standing in a traffic roundabout was cordially and professionally asked to move to the sidewalk, no arrests were made.\u201d Last month, European football federations announced their intention for team captains \u2013 including England\u2019s Harry Kane \u2013 to wear \u201cOne Love\u201d rainbow armbands to symbolise opposition to LGBTQ+ discrimination in Qatar. Tatchell added: \u201cIf a Qatari footballer came out as gay, he would not he would be more likely to be jailed, than be selected for Qatar\u2019s national team. That\u2019s discrimination. It\u2019s against Fifa\u2019s rules, and Fifa is doing nothing about it.\u201d The human rights campaigner added that Fifa had failed to secure change in Qatar, such as legislative reforms on LGBT+ or women\u2019s rights, adding that the Gulf state had not fulfilled many of the pledges it made when it won the right to hold the World Cup. Tatchell\u2019s protest comes as Qatar\u2019s ruling emir attacked criticism of his country over its hosting of the World Cup, describing it as an \u201cunprecedented campaign\u201d targeting the first Arab nation to hold the tournament.In a televised speech before the emirate\u2019s legislative body on Tuesday, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani said: \u201cThe campaign tends to continue and expand to include fabrications and double standards that were so ferocious that it has unfortunately prompted many people to question the real reasons and motives.\u201d Human rights groups have credited Qatar with improving its labour laws since it won the right to host the world\u2019s biggest sporting event, such as dismantling the kafala system, for example, which tied a worker to a single employer, and introducing a minimum monthly wage. However, activists call for more to be done. Sacha Deshmukh, Amnesty International UK\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cAttempts to silence Peter Tatchell simply for drawing attention to Qatar\u2019s outrageous criminalisation of LGBT people is a stark reminder of the repressive climate around freedom of expression in the country.\u201d"

                    "body": "The morning after its seven-game World Cup lifespan was complete, Stadium 974 \u2013 the shipping container one, a kind of elite Qatari hipster project, cod-Hackney to go with the cod-Paris \u2013 was already being dismantled by men with diggers and grabbers and electric wrenches.\nThis is the way of things here. Indeed, as the yellow-shirted travellers streamed through the night on Doha\u2019s driverless metro, another Brazil World Cup campaign done in a haze of tears and grief, it was tempting to wonder how long before the men who dismantle things would be out with their wrecking bars, setting about another Qatari World Cup fixture.\nOK, let\u2019s pack this thing up. Break it down to its basic parts: the magic dust and dandelion petals, the superstructure made from 974 recyclable velveteen codpiece boxes. Project \u20ac222m, also known as Neymar Jr, has run its course. Time to take down the icon.\n\nFor Qatar 2022, Neymar has been a key building block of the past five years, one of the key public faces of this global security-outreach project. He will remain urgently present in avatar form. The Neymar actualisations will continue. Take a walk around Lusail and before long you feel yourself drowning in Neymar content, Neymar iconography, boulevards of scrolling Neymar, lighted walls of Neymar.\nThe most relentlessly annoying of all the World Cup TV ads \u2013 an achievement in itself in a tough field \u2013 features a mind-numbingly cutesy child squealing \u201cImagine the city of the future! And Neymar is there!\u201d On cue, Neymar doggedly appears, already with a kind of glazed, hostage-scenario look. He does some skills, says \u201cno problem\u201d as though these are the final words his desiccated lips will ever utter, then fades out.\nExcept, it turns out we do have a problem. Neymar will not be in Lusail next Sunday. This feels like a kind of end point for all that. Neymar has already suggested he may not play another World Cup, has spoken of his own fragility in that glare, which is in itself quietly encouraging, a reasonable response to his entirely unreasonable existence.\nAs of Friday night his major-chord career, that sweet spot where a kind of ultimacy was still within his reach, is effectively done. Qatar made Neymar one of the richest athletes who has lived. Qatar has also made him into a kind of parable; a place where everyone, in the end, loses something of value.\nIt is five and a half years since Neymar was bought by the state of Qatar and installed at its Paris outpost. This was prime Neymar, the years still un-wasted in frolics and room-temperature domestic fluff. Lest we forget, this is a player who can, or could or might have done anything with a football on any stage, the closest of his generation to having that Lionel Messi everything-all-at-once kind of magic.\n\nEven at this World Cup, more than 600 games into his professional span, there was something almost comic about Neymar\u2019s lightness, his feel for the ball. What is this thing out there spiralling about like a grain of cosmic dandruff, like God\u2019s mosquito, like a speck of dust in the sun?\nNeymar had a fine game against Croatia, and scored a fine extra-time goal, conceived and executed in one movement. Had Croatia\u2019s one shot on target been saved then Neymar being his best Neymar \u2013 being, arguably, more Neymar than he has ever managed before at this level \u2013 would have been the story.\nInstead, we have this: exit music. There will be chances to win things. Maybe Messi can help cajole another Champions League win. But in terms of a defining peak, that ship has now pretty much sailed off the Al Wakrah docks. And there will now be an urge to mock Neymar\u2019s tears \u2013 so, so many tears \u2013 and to rejoice at the hubris; also to drag in the politics, his support for the despotic and dangerous Jair Bolsonaro.\nWhy does Neymar annoy people? Because he\u2019s annoying. The on-pitch theatrics have been grim to watch, most notably the Total Tantrum-Ball stuff in 2018 and the habit of always appealing to the referee, something the journalist Tim Vickery says has links to growing up as a futsal kid, a discipline where fouls are called constantly and the ref is always on hand.\n\nThen there is the gaudy inanity of his public persona. The interminable Netflix documentary, intended to showcase the real Neymar, did exactly that, revealing in turgid, painful detail the basic boredom and airlessness of being Neymar.\nA few years back, Barcelona spent \u20ac300,000 just to fly out his core hangers-on for his unveiling. More recently, one newspaper report involved Neymar allegedly threatening to \u201cgo on strike\u201d during Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s tour of China in order to force his own exit, a sentence so replete with toxins and bad things that just reading it feels like standing too close to football\u2019s exposed reactor core, eyes already staring to melt. Imagine living in that place all the time, forever.\nThis is perhaps the key point about the sporting life of Neymar Jr, beyond the sparkle and the rage; an inescapable note of sadness. Nobody does this to themselves. Football made this thing, the Neymar identity; football will do this, will take your talent and transform it into something grotesque. This is one more reason Neymar inspires such apparently genuine antipathy. Like so many things at this grand-scale pastiche of a World Cup, he can often look like a parody of footballing joy, talent, freedom. Here is the spirit and the beauty that made you love this thing; but reproduced now as a corporate-greed avatar, weaponised as propaganda and soft power.\nThe best parts of his recent career can get lost in this. Pel\u00e9\u2019s international goal record is deeply significant in Brazilian football. It is a serious achievement to equal it. And Neymar has been good at tournaments when he hasn\u2019t been injured, as he has been too often in the Champions League knockout rounds. I once saw him score four against Dijon in Paris, including the single greatest individual goal I have seen in the flesh. It felt like feasting on a hologram. Here was a stellar talent being expressed, pointlessly.\n\nPerhaps in the end the most notable achievement is to express more than any other athlete the idea of divine sporting talent as something entirely lost within the machine. Here we have an elite processed human talent-unit, a walking commodity chip, his chief impact on European club football to act as an agent of financial disruption.\nThere is a toxic flowchart you can draw, from Neymar\u2019s absurd \u00a3200m move to PSG, through the idiotic self-destruction at Barcelona, the smart plays and hedges at some clubs, the disintegration at others, the Super League chaos, the rip tides of pre-existing fear and greed that are still circulating. And for all the sense of stunted talent, of wings never fully spread, modern football is in so many ways his world, a place he captures more profoundly than any other individual. Imagine the city of the future. And Neymar is there!"

                    "body": "Qatar is facing renewed calls from migrant workers, their families, and rights groups to compensate for human rights abuses including wage theft, injuries and uninvestigated deaths, days before the World Cup kicks off. As fans and footballers descend on the Persian Gulf country for the month-long tournament, workers and their families, who have spent 12 years sounding the alarm on exploitative conditions endured while building the tournament\u2019s infrastructure, are seeking an amount equivalent to the $440m (\u00a3372m) World Cup prize money for a remediation programme. Qatar\u2019s labour minister, Ali bin Samikh al-Marri, has previously rejected such proposals, telling the news agency AFP that there was \u201cno criteria to establish these funds\u201d. Faced with scorching temperatures and a lack of labour protections, thousands of workers from Nepal, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and elsewhere have died in the host country since the World Cup was awarded 10 years ago. While the official number of work-related deaths during preparations for the $220bn project is three, according to the Qataris and Gianni Infantino, Fifa\u2019s president, the exact number of migrant workers who have died as a result of negligence remains unknown. \u201cMany migrant workers, their families and communities are not able to fully celebrate what they have built, and are calling on Fifa and Qatar to remedy abuses of workers that have left families and communities destitute and struggling,\u201d said Rothna Begum, a senior researcher in women\u2019s and migrant rights at Human Rights Watch. The unsettling human cost of the tournament is acute for workers such as Ram Pukar Sahani, who left Nepal for Qatar with his father, Ganga Sahani, in 2017, to earn money to repay family debts. In May Ram, who had returned home to get married, received a call from Qatar saying that his father, believed to have been healthy, had died while working. Ram recalled conversations with his father in which he would complain about his work and said Ram\u2019s job, where he was able to escape to air conditioning and had time to rest, was better. When Ganga\u2019s body was returned to Nepal, along with his 9,000 Qatari riyal salary and bonus (\u00a32,000) , no further action or compensation came from the company. His father\u2019s death, he said, was attributed to natural causes. \u201cThey are making this a huge event, but I lost my father,\u201d Ram said through a translator on Thursday. \u201cThere is no debt now, but it took my father\u2019s life to pay back that debt,\u201d he said. While the family received insurance money and support from the Nepali government, it wasn\u2019t enough, he added. Ganga\u2019s death is one of many migrant workers in the past decade that Qatar has failed to investigate, according to an Amnesty International 2021 report that says most migrant worker deaths in Qatar are attributed to \u201cnatural causes\u201d, or cardiac or respiratory failure. In May, Human Rights Watch and other non-governmental organisations wrote a joint open letter to Fifa\u2019s president, calling on the sports body and Qatari authorities to remedy past labour abuses and to compensate workers and their families. Earlier this month, 10 European footballing nations demanded that Fifa deliver a permanent workers\u2019 rights centre in Qatar and a compensation fund for migrant workers and their families. On Sunday, Amnesty International\u2019s secretary general, Agn\u00e8s Callamard, made an urgent plea for compensation to help families rebuild their lives. To quell mounting criticism, sweeping labour reforms were introduced in 2019, which included ending kafala, the system that made it illegal for migrant workers to change jobs or leave the country without their employer\u2019s permission. Other reforms included the first minimum wage for migrant workers in the region and harsher penalties for companies that did not comply with the new laws. \u201cThis is because of our blood and sweat,\u201d said Ram of the tournament, which starts in three days. \u201cLook at us, see our conditions, because there are so many people who have made a huge contribution, even losing their life, to make Qatar\u2019s World Cup possible.\u201d The Qatar 2022 Supreme Committee was approached for comment."

                    "body": "A Scottish engineer who was held in an Iraqi prison facing extradition to Qatar over a bank debt has been released, according to a human rights charity that had been campaigning for his freedom. Brian Glendinning, 43, who had been contracted to work at a BP oil refinery in Iraq, was arrested on an Interpol red notice at Baghdad airport on 12 September. Glendinning, from Kincardine in Fife, was informed on arrest that the Interpol notice had been issued by Qatar over an alleged debt owed to the Qatari National Bank. Radha Stirling, founder of the Interpol and Extradition Reform (Ipex) initiative, said Glendinning\u2019s family are currently arranging flights and it is hoped he could be home as soon as Monday night. \u201cMr Glendinning\u2019s lawyer Tahseen Alchaabawi gave us the good news this morning. It was an emotional moment for his family and I couldn\u2019t be happier for the Glendinnings,\u201d she said. However, Stirling said Qatar had not confirmed if the Interpol red notice had been removed, so there could still be a risk that the 43-year-old could be arrested en route back to Scotland. Stirling previously said Qatar had a history of abusing the Interpol system and that the use of a red notice in Glendinning\u2019s case should be taken as a warning to football fans travelling to the country for the World Cup this month. Glendinning\u2019s brother John said he had lived in \u201cvile\u201d conditions in the Iraqi prison and his beard had grown as \u201cthere was only a single communal shaver in the jail and he wasn\u2019t going to use that.\u201d He added: \u201cHe\u2019s in the hotel. I\u2019ve seen a photo of him with a beer and I\u2019m so happy he\u2019s free. \u201cIt was really emotional for the family. Even our father teared up and he never cries. Kimberly (Brian Glendinning\u2018s partner), the children, they can breathe again. Now it\u2019s just hours until they are together.\u201d A class action lawsuit will now be launched against Interpol for what Ipex says is a \u201cconsistent and repetitive\u201d abuse of power, Stirling said. She added: \u201cIraq was furnished with evidence from Qatar National Bank last week to prove the extradition was over bank debt. \u201cConsumer debt does not meet the criteria for extradition, but it was highly likely Iraq would have succumbed to pressure from Qatar and handed him over anyway. \u201cBrian is free due to a combination of lobbying and media efforts, negotiating and settling the debt with QNB and strong diplomatic representations.\u201d A spokesperson for the Foreign and Commonwealth Development office confirmed it was providing consular support to Glendinning."

                    "body": "STICKING TO FOOTBALL LATEST Gianni Infantino might give off major Bond villain vibes \u2013 the cosy chats with unscrupulous autocrats, the fleet of private jets, the impeccably lacquered bonce, the name \u2013 but really, he\u2019s just a nice guy in a tough spot, doing the best he can. After all, he wasn\u2019t in charge when Fifa awarded the Human Rights World Cup to Qatar \u2013 having taken the reins in 2016, Po\u2019 Gianni has had barely six years to make what little difference he can as the leader of world football\u2019s governing body. Finally then, with the HRWC\u2019s big kick-off six days away and with tofu-munching do-gooders adding to the chorus of concern over a lack of tangible progress in Qatar, Infantino had his big idea. Speaking to G20 leaders over lunch in Bali, he called for a \u201ctemporary ceasefire\u201d in Ukraine for the duration of the big bash in Qatar. \u201cFootball and the [HR] World Cup are offering you and the world a unique platform of unity and peace,\u201d Infantino cheered, as various suits asked to have whatever the grinning bald guy was having. \u201cMaybe the current [HR] World Cup can be that positive trigger.\u201d That\u2019s some serious blue sky thinking. And yes, we\u2019re sure critics will be queuing up to \u201chand out moral lessons\u201d (G Infantino, 2022), pointing out that a couple of weeks ago, Infantino himself wrote to every competing nation, urging everyone to \u201cfocus on football\u201d in Qatar and \u201cnot allow football to be dragged into every ideological or political battle\u201d. Presumably, ones that have nothing to do with the 2022 host nation are OK. Those same hand-wringing haters might also suggest that, as the recipient of a Russian Order of Friendship medal, Infantino has a better chance of getting through to Vladimir Putin than any of those sat around the table. Said tedious naysayers might also suggest that focusing on the plight of migrants would be a better use of Gianni\u2019s time, but he\u2019s way ahead of them \u2013 back in January, he suggested a biennial World Cup \u201cmight give hope to Africans so that they don\u2019t need to cross the Mediterranean in order to find, probably, death in the sea\u201d. Yet Infantino seems less keen to engage with initiatives that actually have a basis in reality, like the #PayUpFifa campaign, led by Amnesty and Human Rights Watch, calling for support and financial compensation for migrant workers in Qatar.  Infantino addressed the issue of workers\u2019 rights in Doha earlier this month, breezily claiming \u201csome criticism was raised, rightfully, and changes have happened.\u201d Since then, 10 European FAs have collectively called for \u201cconcrete answers on issues, [such as] the compensation fund for migrant workers\u201d. Infantino has kept his counsel since then, perhaps wary of an ability to lever his foot directly into his mouth every time he opens it. \u201cWhen you give work to somebody, even in hard conditions, you give him dignity and pride,\u201d Infantino said in May, before expressing an attempt at solidarity with migrant workers far from home, toiling in the heat of Qatar. \u201cMy family emigrated from Italy to Switzerland.\u201d Gianni is nothing if not a man of the people.

Yes, it was a great chance for \u2018a narcissistic, self-serving egomaniac\u2019 (to use Barney Ronay\u2019s description) to make it all about himself and he took it with both hands, but I think Ronaldo is not entirely faultless either\u201d \u2013 Admir Pajic. \u201cFair play to Lufthansa.

Barney Ronay and the podcast are celebrating wins too. Chelsea have appointed Paul Winstanley as their \u201cdirector of global talent and transfers\u201d, which means that they\u2019ve now procured Brighton\u2019s manager, assistant manager, current player of the season, first-team coach, goalkeeping coach, head of recruitment, etc and so on. England have revealed their squad numbers for the HRWC, with James Maddison handed the, erm, coveted No 25 shirt which means the Leicester playmaker\u2019s fitness is not too troublesome.  Aaron Lennon has called time on his career at the age of 35. And Ashton United of the Northern Premier League Division have offered to take Erling Haaland on loan from Manchester City to stop the gigantic goalbot from seizing up while he\u2019s in storage. \u201cIt just makes sense,\u201d cackled manager Michael Clegg. \u201cCity aren\u2019t playing, and we want to help by keeping [him] fit.

                    "body": "Formula One has confirmed the six venues that will host sprint races in the 2023 season. The sport will retain the current format for the sprint weekends in which the shortened 100km race will decide the grid for the grand prix on a Sunday. The sprint race was introduced in 2021 and since then has been held at three meetings each year. F1 has been eager to expand the concept and next year sprint meetings will be held in Azerbaijan, Austria, Belgium, Qatar, the United States and Brazil. Of the six only Brazil and Austria have previously held sprint events.  Next season the weekends will proceed as they have in 2022. Qualifying will be held on a Friday, with the quickest driver claiming pole position for the weekend. That session will decide the grid for the sprint race on a Saturday contested over a 100km distance, usually equating to a race of approximately 30 minutes. Points will be awarded to the top eight drivers on a sliding scale from eight points for the win. The fundamental issue of the driver who wins the race not being counted as having taken pole position for the grand prix itself, despite starting from the front of the grid, remains an awkward and unwieldy construction. F1 considers the format to have been a great success in its opening two years and it is widely supported by race promoters, who enjoy an additional competitive session on a Friday, and similarly by broadcasters. F1 states it has increased revenue and audiences, with Friday qualifying replacing second practice, which has limited appeal. However the general reaction from fans has been less enthusiastic. The majority of the races held thus far have been pedestrian at best, with drivers unwilling to take risks for fear of compromising their race on a Sunday. Equally the tense jeopardy of qualifying, the test under pressure in the single lap discipline, is a challenge many \u2013drivers included \u2013 prefer. F1 is known to want to further adjust the format, making the sprint an entirely standalone race, with its own qualifying session in order to encourage drivers to race more competitively. While that will not be adopted next season it remains under consideration for future years. The new venues were chosen after research into how suitable circuits would be for short-format racing. F1 has emphasised the need for overtaking opportunities, close racing and high-speed sections as crucial to making for a successful sprint."

                    "body": "The rainbow flag flew above the Bourne Corn Exchange as South Kesteven council embraced LGBT history month. A year after voting against such a gesture the Lincolnshire local authority declared itself pleased \u201cto celebrate and recognise the [\u2026] rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people\u201d, hoisting the flag outside its headquarters in 2019. Across Britain, many other councils regularly follow suit, showing solidarity with their LGBT residents through their support of events such as Pride marches. Yet, as a Guardian investigation reveals, at least 28 councils \u2013 including South Kesteven \u2013 have been quietly depositing more than \u00a31bn of taxpayers\u2019 money into accounts at Qatar National Bank (QNB), the state lender in a country where fans who display rainbow flags at next month\u2019s World Cup may have them confiscated \u201cfor their own protection\u201d.  The investments pose a moral dilemma for western institutions dealing with the tiny, gas-rich Gulf emirate \u2013 whether to prize financial returns over principles. Some councils have pulled money out of QNB due to ethical concerns about Qatar, which has said it will welcome LGBT fans but where homosexuality is illegal, women are second-class citizens and migrant workers have died in their thousands. But others have carried on with the investments, described by the human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell as \u201cshocking\u201d. Investment firms, including Halifax and Hargreaves Lansdown, that flaunt their credentials on diversity, inclusion and labour rights, have also poured cash into accounts with the lender. Halifax does not appear to disclose this publicly. The investments take the form of funds deposited with QNB, which is 50%-owned by the Qatar Investment Authority, the $450bn sovereign wealth fund of the gas-rich emirate.  Amid mounting criticism of Qatar\u2019s record on human rights, the World Cup offers an opportunity for the emirate\u2019s ruling elite to secure their place at the top table of global culture, politics and business. Qatar National Bank has played a key role in laying the groundwork for the sporting extravaganza. During the event itself, QNB will be the sole provider of cash machines at games in stadiums. More importantly, QNB helped fund the estimated $220bn of the tournament. According to its annual reports, the bank financed the Education City stadium, where nine matches will be played, as well as infrastructure projects to ensure everything goes off without a hitch. Few people in the UK will suspect that, in paying their council tax, they may have indirectly helped QNB bankroll these investments. Yet freedom of information requests to every local authority in the UK show that at least 27 have invested more than a combined \u00a31bn with QNB since 2017. They do so as part of \u201ctreasury management\u201d \u2013 effectively the storage of council tax money due to be spent on crucial public services. Their deposits at QNB, which has just one branch in central London, reflect the search for yield that more than a decade of ultra-low interest rates has foisted on investors, from local authorities to high street banks. QNB pays a healthy rate of interest \u2013 nearly 4% in some cases, according to council disclosures \u2013 a useful return for councils struggling with cuts to central funding. Most told the Guardian that this was in line with their investment strategy. But not everyone in local government appears to agree that depositing cash with QNB is appropriate. Spokespeople for Trafford and Blaby, both of which have invested in QNB in the past, told the Guardian that they had stopped doing so, citing their ethical investment policies.  Ryedale said it did not have an alternative at the time it did deposit cash with QNB but admitted that the investment had been a \u201cmistake\u201d and said it would not do so in the future for ethical reasons. In Reading, the Green party councillor Josh Williams raised an objection to the council\u2019s investments in a country with a \u201clamentable\u201d human rights record, warning that Reading citizens might draw the conclusion that the council was \u201chappy to invest millions of pounds in a country that would imprison homosexual men\u201d. Reading\u2019s last investment was in July 2022. It says QNB\u2019s sustainability policy means it meets the council\u2019s investment criteria but that it has suspended further investments. Councils that still had millions invested with QNB as of October 2022 include South Kesteven, Argyll and Bute, Swindon and Portsmouth. \u201cIt\u2019s shocking to learn that local authorities are depositing council taxpayers\u2019 money with a state-controlled bank in such a homophobic country as Qatar,\u201d said Tatchell.  \u201cThrough these deposits, local authorities are supporting a bank that funds the World Cup and sustain a regime that stands accused of human rights abuses against LGBT people, women and migrant workers.\u201d Anyone who invests in shares may also have unwittingly contributed to the volume of cash deposited at QNB. The Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s client assets sourcebook regime (Cass) requires stockbrokers to deposit customer money with a panel of major banks, to ensure that funds could be recovered if the brokerage went bust. The banks receiving the deposits typically include well-known UK lenders but some share-dealing brands, including firms that publicly support LGBTQ+ rights, use QNB. Earlier this year, Halifax won praise when it gave staff the option to display pronouns on their name badges and told customers who objected to the move that they should close their accounts. The bank also espouses its commitment to gender equality. But the Guardian understands that the lender\u2019s share dealing arm, which manages \u00a31.5bn of money on behalf of its clients, has more than \u00a3300m with QNB.  Same-sex sexual activity is prohibited under Qatar\u2019s 2004 penal code, which criminalises acts of \u201csodomy\u201d and \u201csexual intercourse\u201d between people of the same sex. Women must obtain permission from a male \u201cguardian\u201d in order to make key decisions about their lives, such as reproductive healthcare or overseas travel, according to a 2021 report by Human Rights Watch. By contrast, Hargreaves Lansdown sponsors Bristol Pride and has won awards at the event thanks to its credentials as an LGBT employer. Yet the company, which also boasts that it is a living wage employer, deposits up to 8% of clients\u2019 cash \u2013 suggesting a maximum of \u00a31.5bn \u2013 with QNB. Fellow stockbroker AJ Bell also lists QNB among the banks it uses, with a maximum of 35% of client money helped there, implying up to \u00a334m. Not all stockbrokers publish the panel of banks they use to store clients\u2019 cash, meaning many more may have deposited funds with QNB. QNB did not answer requests for comment. Hargreaves Lansdown and Halifax declined to comment. A spokesperson for AJ Bell said: \u201cWe evaluate and monitor a number of factors when assessing which banks to use to hold cash,\u201d adding that this \u201cincludes a bank\u2019s independently assessed ESG or ethical rating\u201d."

                    "body": "Fifa has been accused of failing to adhere to its own human rights commitments after it chose not to create a remedy fund for migrant workers injured or killed in Qatar.\nAn umbrella group comprising, among others, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch has spoken out as the World Cup enters its final stages in Doha. It says plans announced by Fifa\u2019s president, Gianni Infantino, to create a legacy fund that \u201chelps people most in need all across the world\u201d falls short of Fifa\u2019s obligations, and undercuts assurances made before the tournament.\n\nIt has called on the game\u2019s governing body to change direction and help victims by using some of the $7.5bn (\u00a36.1bn) of revenue generated from taking the World Cup to Qatar to provide compensation. \n\u201cFifa can still do the right thing by channelling the legacy fund towards workers and their families, supporting a genuinely independent workers\u2019 centre and working with Qatar to ensure that every worker can access the compensation that they deserve,\u201d said Steve Cockburn, Amnesty International\u2019s head of economic and social justice.\n\u201cBy changing course, Fifa could make a lasting difference to the lives of the true heroes behind this World Cup. Refusing to do so would be a terrible indictment on its commitment to workers\u2019 rights.\u201d\nIn 2017 Fifa published its first human rights policy after criticism over the decision to award Qatar the World Cup. At its heart was a commitment to protecting human rights and remedying failures when they occurred, in accordance with the United Nations\u2019 Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.\n\nTo date, however, Fifa has made no express promise to remedy workers hurt or killed during the years of construction leading to the World Cup. A Workers\u2019 Support and Insurance Fund run by the Qatari government claims to have paid out $350m to workers, but public evidence suggests it has so far been used to reimburse workers who have had wages stolen. Fifa\u2019s obligations exist above and beyond any government action.\nNGOs and charities, like European Football Associations who hoped to extract some form of legacy commitment, had extensive meetings with Fifa before the tournament and received encouragement only to be blindsided by a series of vague commitments in Infantino\u2019s bizarre speech that launched the tournament last month. Sources suggest there have been no further meetings since that date.\nNick McGeehan, the founding director of FairSquare, another member of the umbrella group, denounced Fifa\u2019s actions. \u201cInstead of ensuring protection of migrant workers who built and delivered the World Cup infrastructure in Qatar, Fifa has benefited from their exploitation and parroted Qatari authorities\u2019 talking points, showing their complicity to all the misleading claims and deflections on abuses of migrant workers,\u201d he said.\n\u201cFifa has tuned out genuine demands for remedy for migrant workers, including from the football industry, and ignored evidence of widespread uncompensated abuses and the inadequacies of the current compensation systems in Qatar.\u201d\nFifa has been approached for comment. It has previously said it would publish details of the finances of the legacy fund once the World Cup has finished \u201cin keeping with previous tournaments\u201d."

                    "body": "Serge Gnabry was on the pitch. They thought it was all over. With Germany 2-0 up at a sullen Wembley, Hansi Flick decided to kick back and roll out his substitutions. On came Gnabry, trying to play himself back into form after an indifferent start to the season with Bayern Munich. On came Robin Gosens, spying a chance to reclaim the left-back berth. But with 20 minutes to play, the prevailing sense was of a winding down, a gear shift, an opportunity to knock the ball around as the stands slowly emptied around them. On this front, it\u2019s fair to say things didn\u2019t quite go to plan. Indeed, perhaps the clearest indication of the suffering Germany endured during those final 20 minutes came at full time. As the whistle blew, centre-backs Nico Schlotterbeck and Niklas S\u00fcle bent double, the weariest men on the pitch, having borne the brunt of a chastening late England assault. Kai Havertz\u2019s equalising goal had salvaged a little solace from the jaws of catastrophe. But Germany\u2019s body language told its own story: the basic dislocation of a team coming to the collective realisation that it does not know itself quite as well as it thought.  And so Flick\u2019s team will travel to Oman for their pre-World Cup training camp on a run of just one win in seven games, and with far more questions than answers. An initial relief at the passing of the Joachim L\u00f6w era has given way to a certain self-reflexive doubt: the suspicion that the underlying problems in this side go deeper than its ageing coach. None of these issues are terminal or unfixable. This remains a richly talented squad with champion footballers in every area of the pitch. But, right now, something appears to be missing. The old certainties \u2013 resilience, character, composure, defensive solidity, the ability to burgle a goal at the moment it is most required \u2013 no longer feel as certain as they did. If a lack of coherence in attack has been the defining theme of Germany\u2019s last few games, then here it was their brittleness at the back that was most concerning. Even before England\u2019s comeback there were frequent opportunities on the counter. Raheem Sterling had two good chances in the first half. And on the occasions England were able to play through the press, there was abundant space for them to run into: space that more often than not had been vacated by Joshua Kimmich.  There has been a rumbling debate in Germany over recent weeks about Kimmich\u2019s role in midfield, not just with the national team but with Bayern. His gifts are self-evident: a superb passing range, speed of thought, a preternatural reading of the game. What is less clear is how best to use them. Philipp Lahm recently observed that Kimmich\u2019s gradual migration into a more attacking player has blurred some of his defensive responsibilities. \u201cWhat is crucial,\u201d Lahm said, \u201cis that the roles must be clearly assigned. I don\u2019t see that at the moment. I don\u2019t currently understand his role.\u201d In recent games Kimmich has been deployed alongside Ilkay G\u00fcndogan, also a roaming, marauding sort of midfielder. When it works, it works extremely well: Kimmich receiving the ball from the defence and setting G\u00fcndogan off with a searing diagonal pass. But there were moments of confusion here, times when it was unclear who would go forward and who would cover, times when they both pushed high and left gaps behind them. Leon Goretzka, Kimmich\u2019s Bayern colleague and a more natural covering player, might solve the issue. But Flick seems to prefer the versatility of G\u00fcndogan, his ability to make late runs into the box, an insurance policy in a team not blessed with natural goalscorers.  In a sense this encapsulates Flick\u2019s dilemma: cover up one flaw and another one appears, like one of those sliding square games. Force Kimmich to sit deeper and you lose a creative presence further up the field. Bring the defensive line up and you leave yourself vulnerable to pace. Meanwhile the introduction of Timo Werner in the second half bolstered Germany\u2019s press, but he also missed two good chances. And while the return of Antonio R\u00fcdiger will shore up the defence, Flick still has issues to solve at full-back, where neither Thilo Kehrer nor David Raum has made an unanswerable case. This is, of course, a wildly open World Cup. But it is hard to recall a Germany tournament side with quite so many problem areas, with so little sense of its own capabilities. Was this an insipid collapse or a bracing comeback? Is this a team on the cusp of coming together or on the verge of falling apart? Not until Qatar, you feel, will we truly know the answer."

                    "body": "Some of the UK\u2019s largest listed companies including water and energy giants have handed almost \u00a3500m to Qatari state-owned investors this year, raising concerns that blue-chip company profits are supporting the controversial World Cup host.\nThe dividend payouts are the result of the Gulf nation\u2019s investments in a raft of FTSE 100 firms, including Barclays, Shell and utility firm Severn Trent, which have reported strong profits amid a cost of living crisis and the worst UK drought in centuries.\nThe figures, compiled by the Guardian, cover funds distributed to Qatari state-owned shareholders in the 10 months leading up to the controversial tournament in November.\nHowever, the Qatari state\u2019s income from UK-listed firms is likely to have been in the billions of pounds since it won the rights to host the Fifa World Cup in 2010.\n\nThe figures will raise concerns over how everyday spending by British consumers, through bank transactions, grocery shopping and air travel, may be inadvertently supporting the Qatari host, which has criminalised homosexuality and been accused of exploiting migrant workers to build World Cup infrastructure.\nAlthough the shareholdings of listed companies are publicly available, there is little awareness about the types of investors that hold shares in UK firms.\nAmnesty International UK\u2019s director of economic affairs, Peter Frankental, said British firms needed to be more upfront about the destination of dividend payouts.\n\u201cQatar\u2019s considerable wealth and its extensive portfolio of overseas investments have been accompanied by the systematic exploitation of its vast migrant labour force, many of whom have toiled for years for abusive employers with the connivance of the Qatari authorities,\u201d Frankental said.\n\n\u201cUK companies need to be transparent about any human rights abuses that may have occurred in their investor chain, including those originating in Qatar\u2019s notorious construction sites.\u201d\nQatar\u2019s $450bn (\u00a3389bn) sovereign wealth fund, the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), has taken a huge interest in UK-listed investment in recent decades, spending billions to acquire stakes in a raft of British blue-chip firms such as the London Stock Exchange Group and Royal Dutch Shell.\nUK stocks make up nearly a fifth of the QIA\u2019s equity portfolio at 17%, and are worth a combined $8.8bn. That makes the UK the third-largest destination for the authority\u2019s equity investments, behind Germany which makes up 29% of the portfolio at a value of $15bn, and Qatar where shares make up nearly 19% of the portfolio at $9.6bn.\nThose UK stakes have meant that the investment authority \u2013 and therefore the Qatari state \u2013 have benefited from British companies\u2019 profits, which have subsequently been handed to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.\nGuardian analysis of publicly available data shows Qatari vehicles, including QIA, have pocketed around \u00a3475m in dividends since January alone, helping support Qatari finances at a time when the state is estimated to have spent about $200bn preparing to host the World Cup.\n\nThat includes Shell, which handed nearly $17m worth of dividends to Qatar in a year when it reported record profits on the back of surging energy prices linked to the shortages caused by the war in Ukraine.\nMeanwhile, the QIA earned \u00a313m through its 4.6% holding in Coventry-based water company Severn Trent, which has come under fire for bumper executive payouts \u2013 including \u00a33.9m for its boss Liv Garfield \u2013 even though the country suffered under the worst drought conditions in centuries.\nThe QIA also earned \u00a311m from the London Stock Exchange Group, in which the QIA still holds a 7% stake, and further \u00a333m from its shareholding in supermarket chain Sainsbury\u2019s.\nThat is on top of \u00a364m from a 6.3% stake in banking giant Barclays. Its holding in the UK bank is a hangover from its controversial involvement in the bank\u2019s emergency fundraising at the height of the 2008 financial crisis. The funding arrangement helped Barclays avoid a public bailout that would have placed it under government control, but later led the Serious Fraud Office to accuse three former Barclays bankers of funnelling secret fees to Qatar in exchange for the emergency funding. A jury found those executives not guilty in early 2020. The bank itself is now appealing against a regulatory fine over the deal.\nOne of the biggest sources of UK dividend revenue came from UK-listed mining giant Glencore, which paid Qatar Holding \u2013 a subsidiary of the QIA \u2013 a total of $387m (\u00a3347m) since January. The dividends are the result of an 8% stake in the company.\nWhile Glencore is headquartered in Switzerland, rather than the UK, most UK pensions will have a stake in the FTSE 100-listed firm, which trades metals used in key technologies such as electric batteries. Glencore became one of the largest commodity companies in the world thanks to a \u00a350bn merger with mining company Xstrata, sealed thanks to late-night talks involving Tony Blair and Qatari billionaire politician Hamad bin Jassim Al Thani.\nOther dividend payouts came from stakes in Dettol disinfectant and Nurofen maker Reckitt Benckiser, which paid \u00a3382,000 to QIA, and private equity group and GKN-owner Melrose Industries, at \u00a314,000.\nThe state-owned Qatar Airways also holds a 25.23% stake in British Airways owner IAG, though the group \u2013 which is still recovering from the Covid pandemic \u2013 has not yet paid a dividend this year. \nThe QIA, Glencore, Barclays, Severn Trent, and the London Stock Exchange declined to comment. Melrose Industries did not respond to requests for comment.\nSainsbury\u2019s said in a statement that it did not choose its shareholders, and that the majority were UK pension funds and private investors including Sainsbury\u2019s staff.\nReckitt Benckiser said the company recently strengthened policies meant to prevent modern slavery and had a zero-tolerance policy on human rights abuses. \u201cWe have a track record of working throughout our supply chain to strengthen human rights and labour standards, excluding suppliers where our standards are not achieved, and working with suppliers, peers and civil society to enable change at scale.\u201d\nShell did not directly comment on the dividend payouts but shared a statement regarding its approach to separate investments in Qatar. \u201cA commitment to worker welfare and respect for people is fundamental to how companies in the Shell group operate globally, including in Qatar.\u201d\nThose dividends from listed firms are on top of valuable stakes in private British companies including Harrods, Heathrow, The Shard and Starling Bank.\nIn December engine maker Rolls-Royce announced the QIA was spending \u00a385m to take a 10% stake in a UK government-backed project to develop small nuclear power plants, known as Rolls-Royce SMR.\nQInvest, another investment vehicle of the Qatari royal family, also maintains a 43% stake in stockbroker and investment bank Panmure Gordon, which posted its first profit in three years in 2021.\nMeanwhile, Farnborough-headquartered arms company BAE Systems announced in March that it had signed an agreement to develop warship support for the Qatar Emiri\u2019s Naval Force. And amid the UK\u2019s energy crisis, Qatar\u2019s participation in the South Hook LNG terminal has come into focus. State-owned Qatar Energy has a 67.5% share in the Pembrokeshire-based terminal.\nQatar is one of the UK\u2019s largest sources of liquefied natural gas (LNG), a role that led Boris Johnson to discuss increased supply from the Gulf state in late 2021, as global gas prices soared.\n"

Croatia qualified for the Nations League semi-finals next year as defender Dejan Lovren marked his return to the team with a rare goal in a comprehensive 3-1 victory over relegated Austria in Vienna. Lovren, playing his first international in almost a year, scored the third goal for the visitors, who topped League A Group 1 with 13 points from six matches, one point ahead of second-placed Denmark. Austria finished bottom. Luka Modric gave Croatia an early lead with his 23rd international goal as he took a touch to control Nikola Vlasic\u2019s pass and fired low into the net. That joy was short-lived as Austria equalised three minutes later when Christoph Baumgartner glanced Marcel Sabitzer\u2019s cross into the net with a deft header. But two goals in three minutes midway through the second period sealed the points for Croatia as Marko Livaja headed home at the back post after a cross from Ivan Perisic, before Lovren was left free by the home defenders to score with a header from Lovro Majer\u2019s cross. Despite the loss, it was a special night for home forward Marko Arnautovic, who won an Austrian record 104th international cap and moved past Andreas Herzog at the top of the country\u2019s list of most appearances.      9.51pm    Reuters take on the Netherlands, who are on their way to the Nations League final with Croatia.   Captain Virgil van Dijk netted a second-half winner as the Netherlands beat neighbours Belgium 1-0 on Sunday to ensure top spot in their Nations League group and a place in next year*s finals tournament.  Van Dijk powered home a header from a corner in the 73rd minute at the Amsterdam Arena on Sunday to ensure the Dutch finished runaway winners in League A Group Four. They finished with 16 points, six more than Belgium who had a chance to leapfrog their neighbours, and take first place, but needed to win by three goals or more on Sunday to do so. Any hopes of a goal feast were quickly stymied, however, as the two sides effectively cancelled each other out in a tight tactical battle. The Dutch pressing game frustrated Belgian efforts at building up attacks, while a five-man defence for the visitors meant there was little room for the home strikers.      9.47pm    Reuters on France\u2019s loss to the Danes.   Nations League holders France lost 2-0 to Denmark in their final Group 1 game but salvaged their place in the top tier at the end of a dismal campaign on Sunday. Didier Deschamps\u2019s side, who will face Denmark in Group D at the World Cup in November, conceded first-half goals by Kasper Dolberg and Andreas Skov Olsen to finish third in their Group with five points from six games. Austria were relegated to League B after a 3-1 home defeat in Croatia left them bottom of the group on four points. Croatia qualified for the final four with 13 points, one ahead of Denmark, who burst into life against France after being dominated in the first 20 minutes.      9.43pm   Full-time scores in the Nations League  Austria 1-3 CroatiaDenmark 2-0 FranceFaroe Islands 2-1 TurkeyNetherlands 1-0 BelgiumLuxembourg 1-0 Lithuania     9.41pm   Full-time: Wales 0-1 Poland  Not the way Wales would like to sign off ahead of going to Qatar but this was a young, inexperienced team, with Gareth Bale playing only for match fitness, and who failed to make much of a free-kick in the dying embers. Much to admire in the performance of Brennan Johnson, but for now, Wales have been relegated from the elite section of the Nations League.

This time, Sorba Thomas\u2019 cross is perfect and Bale powers the ball beyond Szczesny and off the bar.      9.35pm    90+1 min: It\u2019s full-time as Denmark have beaten France 2-0.      9.35pm    90 min: There will be five minutes on, and Wales are at least pushing hard.      9.34pm    88 min: Wales waste a free-kick as Sorba Thomas, usually so good at these moments, especially for Huddersfield, just lumps the ball into the wall.      9.31pm    86 min: Thomas is now on for Roberts for Wales. Colwill, all bouffant hair and youthful promise, escapes down the left-hand channel. Johnson is waiting in the middle, and he can\u2019t be found. Szczesny has been a safe pair of hands tonight.      9.29pm    84 min: Score correction: it\u2019s actually Luxembourg 0-0 Lithuania. Must have been a VAR.      9.28pm    83 min: Poland making a series of subs now as they attempt to further run down the clock.      9.27pm    82 min: Matt Dony gets in touch: \u201cBergkamp-esque. Except, Lewandowski meant it. (Tin hat: On)\u201c Peter Oh: \u201cI\u2019m having a hard time keeping things straight. Tell me if I\u2019ve got it right: England are poor, Scotland are good, and Wales are mediocre.\u201d Alexander McMillan: \u201cSeems to me, it depends on who you think football is for. If you think it\u2019s for the serial winners (big clubs and major nations) then you probably don\u2019t like it. But if you think it\u2019s for everyone, and that all nations deserve the chance to progress and play against opponents of a similar level, then you\u2019ve got to be all for it. Lots of the \u2018lower\u2019 standard European sides showing massive improvements.\u201d     9.25pm    80 min: Wales\u2019 attacks have been rather less than fluid, with the Poles sat deep in numbers, and Bale, somehow still on the field, struggling to impose himself.      9.24pm    78 min: Scoreflash: Austria 1-3 Croatia, goals from Marko Livaja and Dejan Lovren are good news for France who are now likely to stay up.      9.22pm    77 min: Szczesny makes a fine save \u2013 again \u2013 James whipping in the ball from the left, and the Polish goalkeeper dived late to force it away from danger. Kieffer Moore might have been on the crime scene there.      9.21pm    76 min: Scoreflash: Netherland 1-0 Belgium and Virgil van Dijk got it.      9.20pm    75 min: It\u2019s getting even more bitty, with Poland running down the clock, they have plenty of experience in their team. Lewandowski buys time off a Cabango foul.      9.17pm    72 min: On comes Rubin Colwill, and off goes Levitt. That would seem to have left just Joe Morrell as a Wales central midfielder.      9.15pm    70 min: All huff and puff for Wales, who Poland are keeping at arm\u2019s length here.      9.14pm    68 min: Bogdan gets in touch: \u201cTell me honestly what do you really think about this Nations league project, is it good or bad for football? I just don`t know, in some way for me it has improved the international football since there are no meaningless friendlies but, on the other hand, there are more difficult competitive matches and the players get more tired playing not-so-important games?\u201d I am torn, I have to say. I sigh each time the Nations League comes around then enjoy some of the games. So it\u2019s better than friendlies, but then it\u2019s not the Premier League or a major finals. Hmm.      9.12pm    65 min: Scoreflash: The Faroe Islands are currently leading Turkey 2-0. The only other goal other than Swiderski\u2019s here is that putting Luxembourg 1-0 up on Lithuania.      9.10pm    64 min: Poland change: off goes Karol \u015awiderski, the goalscorer, and on comes Krzysztof Pi\u0105tek of Salernitana.      9.08pm    62 min: Wales staring down the barrel of relegation, and paying for not being able to take their chances and suffering for having Joe Allen and Aaron Ramsey on the bench.      9.06pm    60 min: Szczesny makes a great save, as Brennan Johnson comes in from the left, and the ball was arrowing in, only for the Juventus goalkeeper to make the save with his fingertips. Good football all round.      9.04pm    59 min: And as that goal went in, courtesy of a piece of Bergkamp-esque skill from Lewandowski, on comes Moore, and off goes Norrington Davies.      9.03pm   Goal! Wales 0-1 Poland (Swiderski, 58)  That man Lewandowski at the heart of it. Krychowiak\u2019s pass goes to Lewandowski whose flick takes out two Wales defenders and Swiderski smashes home.    Updated at 9.12pm BST    9.01pm    57 min: James seems to be the furthest man forward, and is having real problems holding it up. Bale surely to go off?      9.00pm    55 min: Yes, Moore is coming on, after a discussion with Rob Page, who has clearly seen enough.      8.58pm    53 min: Kieffer Moore is imminent for Wales, and they could really do with a focal point up front. Arwel Jones gets in touch: \u201cBale looks like an old man lost in the park.\u201d Yes, a little bit.      8.56pm    51 min: More groans for the officiating as Glik smashes into James, and somehow that\u2019s not given as a foul. It looked a forearm smash.      8.54pm    48 min: Neco Williams is booked as Bartosz Bereszy\u0144ski took a smashing, and comes back on the field to roll around. The referee rather awarded that one blind.      8.52pm    47 min: A slow start to this half, and will we see more of Bale who has a free role as ever.      8.51pm    46 min: Back underway in Cardiff. with Poland getting it launched to the back stick from the kick-off.      8.37pm   Half-time scores in the Nations League  Austria 1-1 CroatiaDenmark 2-0 FranceFaroe Islands 0-0 TurkeyNetherlands 0-0 BelgiumLuxembourg 0-0 Lithuania     8.35pm   Half-time: Wales 0-0 Poland  As it stands, Wales will get relegated from the Nations League top tier. They finish the half with Szczesny making brave save from Gareth Bale, and the two share a handshake as the whistle goes. Dan James had the best chance of the game, and perhaps stopped Brennan Johnson having a better one. Still, an inexperienced Wales team is holding its own.      8.33pm    45+1 min: Bednarek is not booked when James looked to have escaped at the halfway line. Lucky boy. That\u2019s a yellow in the Barclays. Three minutes added on here.      8.32pm    45 min: Wales have been a bit better as this half has gone on, without ever throwing much in the way of passing together. Brennan Johnson, who is so lively, is caught offside.      8.29pm    43 min: Norrington-Davies is booked, having smashed into Lewandowski, who does take his time coming back up. He\u2019s still wiping his brow as he gets up.      8.28pm    42 min: So close for Wales. Brennan Johnson speeds forward, unleashes a shot and it might well have been going in, only for the ball to come off Dan James and go wide.      8.27pm    40 min: Scoreflash: Denmark 2-0 France; Andreas Olsen has got it.      8.26pm    39 min: Almost a horror moment, for Wayne Hennessey, who almost did a Peter Enckelman, a Scott Carson, a David de Gea, from a back-pass from Norrington-Davies, I think \u2013 Rodon maybe. Hennessey makes amends by making a save soon after.  Updated at 8.28pm BST    8.24pm    38 min: Szczesny has to come out and stop Gareth Bale, who had just escaped after a throw-in. The LA king has been quiet, it has to be said.   Updated at 9.02pm BST    8.22pm    36 min: West Brom and PSG legend Grzegorz Krychowiak is booked for a foul on Morrell, wrapping his arm around the Portsmouth man, and shunting him to the ground.      8.20pm    34 min: Scoreflash: Denmark 1-0 France, Kasper Dolberg got it and, like England, the French could be headed for Nations League relegation.;  Updated at 8.23pm BST    8.19pm    33 min: Dan James does a Dan James thing, sent away by Cabango\u2019s clearance, and it\u2019s one on one. He\u2019s up against Szczesny, who saves not once, but twice. Perhaps it was the weaker foot for James but we\u2019ve all seen James fail to make the most of those chances.      8.17pm    31 min: Connor Roberts goes close\u2026no, he had fouled Zalewski in trying to win the header. The Polish defender holds his head, though actually took a blow to the back. Then there\u2019s some afters, dealt out by Lewandowski. Roberts\u2019 turn to make something of a foul. No love lost in the Nations League.      8.15pm    29 min: Joe Rodon, the senior Welsh defender tonight, has to clear a ball from the flank. It\u2019s not been an easy first 30 minutes for Wales. Their attacking fliers have seen very little of the ball.      8.12pm    27 min: Poland chance! Hennessey hangs on gratefully as Zielinski\u2019s cross is headed downwards. Poland beginning to pile up the pressure now, dominating possession.      8.10pm    25 min: Lewandowski falls to the floor, grabbing his face, some theatrics on show from the Poles here? No, Cabango had walloped him across the chops, the Swansea defender is one of those who isn\u2019t quite sure of a place in Qatar.   Updated at 9.03pm BST    8.08pm    23 min: Poland are not especially zippy in attack, though that\u2019s been a problem since Lewandowski started playing for them.      8.07pm    21 min: Scoreflash: Actually, there\u2019s been no Nations League goals anywhere other than that match between Austria and Croatia, where it\u2019s still 1-1.      8.05pm    18 min: Neco Williams to the rescue, a last-ditch job, to cut off a pass from the so far excellent Zielinski. Wales look shaky at the back to say the least.      8.03pm    16 min: Joe Allen and Aaron Ramsey look on from the sidelines. Allen, back at Swansea, has a hamstring problem, Ramsey has something similar, picked up while playing for Nice.      8.01pm    14 min: Wales have their first corner, Brennan Johnson forcing it, using his pace down the right-hand side. It\u2019s cleared after a push in the box.      7.59pm    13 min: Jeers as Lewandowski\u2019s loose touch allows the ball to go out. The great man will need more than that to put him off.      7.58pm    11 min: Matt Dony corrects me, correctly. I knew the difference, having covered the Welsh team at Cardiff\u2019s stadium.  \u201cI\u2019m assuming it was a simple mis-type, but they\u2019re not at the Principality. It\u2019s Cardiff City Stadium. Which is one of many, many things that that the Welsh FA are currently getting right. They could no doubt sell more tickets if they used the Principality, but the players and the fans want to be in Cardiff City\u2019s home instead. And even though it generates less revenue (especially considering the surprisingly cheap, family-friendly ticket pricing structure), the powers that be listen. The performances and atmospheres have vindicated that, and led to WC qualification, meaning a massive injection of revenue in the longer term. A clear strategy that has paid off. See also, fading out the music for the anthem and allowing the crowd to sing unaccompanied. It\u2019s enormously popular among fans, and although it\u2019s a relatively small thing, it makes a massive difference to fans. Are you listening, RFU? No, of course you\u2019re not\u2026\u201d     7.56pm    9 min: Zielinski is down, after a clash with Cabango, and the referee blows up, much to the consternation of the home fans. The Napoli player is holding his ankle but he\u2019s going to be OK. It\u2019s now Austria 1-1 Croatia, Christoph Baumgartner getting the equaliser.      7.54pm    8 min: Scoreflash: Croatia 1-0 Austria, Luka Modric getting the goal.      7.53pm    6 min: Ben Cabango gets his first chance to prove himself against Lewandowski. Then there\u2019s a flutter of hearts as Rodon is again loose, and there\u2019s panic before Hennessey slides out to deny the Polish through ball.      7.51pm    5 min: Some early touches for Bale, and then Lewandowski gets his first touch. Wales getting plenty of space down the flanks.   Updated at 7.51pm BST    7.49pm    3 min: Early warning sign for Wales as Rodon steps out and Zielinksi goes through. He was offside but Wayne Hennessey made a save in any case. It\u2019s started with plenty of energy.      7.47pm    1 min: And away we go in Cardiff. An early attack from Daniel James and he was looking for Gareth Bale as he scampered away. The Polish fans are making themselves heard, too. Their defence gets the ball clear.      7.45pm    A frankly unbelievable version of the Land of My Fathers, the Welsh national anthem from the fans in Cardiff. Incredible sound. You can keep your Marseillaise and the Il Canto degli Italiani, when the Welsh get proper hold of their song they are untouchable.  Updated at 7.46pm BST    7.39pm    This is a farewell to the fans ahead of the World Cup, the first since 1958 where, despite the problems of accommodation and cost, it\u2019s said there may be almost as many Welsh fans travelling to Qatar as the English. Once in a lifetime, even allowing for the glory of Euro 2016 and being at Euro 2020. The Principality Stadium is rocking with some classic EDM and the lights are flashing on and off. Cardiff is a city that does these events well, very well.      7.30pm    Alan Pugh gets in touch: \u201cBonsoir from Paris. Impossible to find a bar showing the game in Cardiff. On the plus side the Munch exhibition here was well worth a visit at the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay. And it\u2019ll certainly be a scream if we and the Scots are both in the A band for the next Nations\u2019 League while our neighbours take on Kazakhstan.\u201d     7.29pm    Rob Page speaks to S4C \u2013 in English.   It is is what it is and we\u2019ve got one game to win. We\u2019ve had four senior players out of both games. We couldn\u2019t have played Gareth on Thursday, it would have been crazy. Kieffer [Moore] had a bit of illness and took a knock that\u2019s nothing to do with team selection. It\u2019s another full house, [the fans] play their massive part.       7.13pm    Ben Fisher is our man in Cardiff tonight, and he\u2019ll be filing the full-time report later.  He\u2019s been in the Wales camp, and listening to what the likes of Rob Page and Gareth Bale have to say.  Page: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a job in hand that we\u2019re fully focused on. As soon as the final whistle has gone we\u2019ll be preparing for the World Cup.\u201d Bale: \u201cI am closer than I have been in the last few years, for sure,\u201d Bale says. \u201cIt\u2019s about playing minutes and games and I\u2019m starting to do that a lot more often now. The more I play, the fitter I\u2019ll get. Hopefully, I can start to peak and get stronger and stronger as quickly as possible.\u201d      7.05pm    For the record, Big Vinny Janssen has scored six in five for Royal Antwerp.      7.03pm    Some Premier League legends in here, not least Spurs icon Vincent Janssen, and that Belgium team features Jan Verthongen and Toby Alderweireld.        6.58pm    Denmark v France features some rather exciting players, Arsenal fans can either enthuse or look through their hands as William Saliba starts. Eduardo Camavinga and Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni of Real Madrid in partnership.        6.51pm    Four Welsh changes from the team that lost to Belgium. Mepham, Ampadu, Smith and Moore out. Cabango, Morrell, Levitt and Bale in. Three Polish changes but the same back three from the loss to the Netherlands. It\u2019s Bale v Lewandowski in the battle of the captain\u2019s armbands. Per PA Media:  Skipper Gareth Bale was back in the Wales starting line-up for their Nations League relegation decider with Poland in Cardiff Bale, who was a second-half substitute in Belgium on Thursday after arriving late due to his playing commitments in the United States, was one of four changes alongside Ben Cabango, Dylan Levitt and Joe Morrell. Suspended pair Chris Mepham and Ethan Ampadu, as well as Matt Smith and Kieffer Moore, dropped out with Wales knowing only victory was enough to keep them in League A. Barcelona striker Robert Lewandowski captained a Poland side who needed to draw or win to stay in the top tier of European football.   Updated at 6.53pm BST    6.48pm   The teams - Bale starts  Wales: Hennessey; Cabango, Rodon, Norrington-Davies; C Roberts, Morrell, Levitt, N Williams; Johnson, Bale (C), James. Subs: Gunter, Colwill, Smith, Roberts, Ward, Moore, Burns, Williams, M Harris, King, Thomas, James Poland: Szczesny; Bednarek, Glik, Kiwior; Bereszynski, Krychowiak, Zurowski, Zalewski; Zielinski, Lewandowski (C), Swiderski. Subs: Skorupski, Dragowski, Gumny, Kedziora, Wieteska, Milik, Piotrowski, Grosicki, Skoras, Kaminski, Szymanski, Piatek.     6.45pm   Preamble  Thursday\u2019s defeat to Belgium, their habitual opponents, showed the size of the task that may await Rob Page in Qatar. The second-half display, which raised the hackles of Roberto Martinez so much he got himself sent off, at least suggested that all is by no means lost. These Nations League matches, competitive as they technically are, are warmups for what comes in November, but like the English the Welsh are set to be relegated from the top tier unless they beat the Poles tonight. Page\u2019s men have not won their last four matches, not ideal preparation for the World Cup but Gareth Bale is likely to be involved from the start. As for the Poles, they are readying themselves for a World Cup group involving Mexico, Saudi Arabia and Argentina, and coming off a 2-0 loss to the Netherlands on Thursday. There\u2019s some other big matches played this evening to keep you updated on, with Denmark taking on France, and the Netherlands taking on the Belgians. The Nations League: it\u2019s relentless.  "

                    "body": "So much for football being a game that lasts 90 minutes. Or the sight of a fourth official holding up a board showing two or three minutes of added time. At this tournament, the 100min-plus match is becoming the new normal.\nEngland\u2019s 6-2 victory against Iran on Monday lasted a record\u2011breaking 117min, with 14min 08sec of stoppage time in the first half and 13min 08sec in the second. Argentina\u2019s shock 2-1 defeat against Saudi Arabia on Tuesday was not far behind, lasting 111min. Forget Fergie Time, welcome to Fifa Time.\n\nThe reason, Fifa has confirmed, is down to a new directive to ensure all \u201cunnatural lost time\u201d is added at the end of each half. In Qatar it has asked officials to more accurately monitor when a game is stopped for goal celebrations, time wasting, video assistant referee decisions, substitutions, penalties and red cards \u2013 even if it means extending a match by many minutes.\nPierluigi Collina, the chairman of Fifa\u2019s referees committee, said last week: \u201cIf we want to have more active time, we need to be ready to see this kind of additional time given.\n\u201cThink of a match where in a half there are three goals. The celebration normally takes one to one and a half minutes. With three goals, basically you lose five, six minutes. So what we really want to do is to accurately calculate the time to be added.\u201d\n\nAccording to Opta, the average game time in the first six matches of this World Cup was 106min 12sec, compared with 97min 12sec in 2018. It said the four halves with the most stoppage time in a World Cup match since records began in 1966 were all on Monday, with time added on in the second halves of USA v Wales and Senegal v Netherlands both being more than 10min. That was before the added time in Argentina\u2019s second half against Saudi Arabia, which came to 14min.\nSome of that was down to extended injury breaks: the Iran goalkeeper, Alireza Beiranvand, sustained concussion after a clash of heads against England and the Saudi defender Yasser al-Shahrani was knocked out by a flying knee from his own keeper, Mohammed al-Owais, in injury time.\n\nCollina made Fifa\u2019s position clear, saying: \u201cIf we want to protect the image of the game we must calculate time and add it on at the end of each half. We do not want matches where the ball is only in play for 43, 44 or 45 minutes. We must make sure the time is fair for both teams.\u201d\nIfab, football\u2019s law-making body, rejected a proposal for games to be reduced to 60min of \u201ceffective playing time\u201d with the clock stopped when the ball goes out of play. Last season the ball was in play on average in the Premier League for just over 55min but in some leagues it can drop as low as 45min."

                    "body": "When Ankaragucu host Besiktas on Sunday there will be a former MK Dons forward taking to the field, aiming to prove his talents on Turkey\u2019s biggest stage, while having half an eye on making the Qatar World Cup. To add to the similarities, like Dele Alli, Gboly Ariyibi spent a number of his early years in Nigeria. The two will come face-to-face at Eryaman Stadium in the Super Lig where they find themselves a long way from home. This is not the first time they have met. Ariyibi, then of Chesterfield, was an unused sub against MK Dons in 2014, and the future England international made an impression. \u201cI remember watching him and seeing his playing maturity, he was a cut above League One, even then,\u201d Ariyibi says. \u201cI knew he wouldn\u2019t be there for long.\u201d  The route to the Turkish capital has been circuitous for Ariyibi. He came through the ranks at Southampton but was released without making an appearance. He was playing Sunday league while he trialled at clubs up and down the country from Bolton to Bournemouth, and even turned up at Leyton Orient with boots in hand hoping to force them to give him a chance. Eventually his then agent Lee Payne set up a trial with Leeds, Ariyibi got on the train at London\u2019s King\u2019s Cross and never came back. Ariyibi went from amateur football to playing in front of 30,000 people in the Championship in a matter of days. After a year at Elland Road he dropped down to Chesterfield from where he earned a move to Nottingham Forest, then two seasons on loan at MK Dons and Motherwell. He headed to Greek Super League team Panetolikos to show he could cut it in a top division where two successful campaigns were enough for Ankaragucu to come calling, wanting Ariyibi to help them bounce back from relegation at the first time of asking. \u201cIt was an amazing feeling, not just for the players but the fans,\u201d Ariyibi says. \u201cThere were a lot of expectations for a team that has made one of the most illustrious Turkish clubs. It was a surreal moment to make history and be part of it. You could feel the buzz around the city when we had the celebrations. The support was unmatched throughout the season and you can really see how passionate they are. Definitely my best experience in football.\u201d  Ankaragucu are back to the top table, alongside Galatasaray, Fenerbahce and Sunday\u2019s opponents Besiktas but are winless in three matches and have dispensed with their title-winning head coach. \u201cWe go in as the underdogs but we can beat anyone in this league with the support of our fans. \u201cIt is going to be a million miles away from Anfield or the Emirates for Alli. Eryaman Stadium can be a difficult place to come to as an opponent and the fans \u2013 from both sides \u2013 will be giving it everything for 90 minutes and more.\u201d His close friend Uche Ikpeazu recently left Middlesbrough to join Ariyibi in Turkey at Konyaspor. He asked for advice and Ariyibi will be happy to share his insight with Alli. \u201cIt is always nice to see people from England abroad and I genuinely think a lot more people should come out of their comfort zones. \u201cYou have quality players here and lots of big names with the likes of Alli himself. I have loads of football friends in England and they call me for advice. If I was Dele I would also feel comfortable knowing there are other homegrown talents in the same situation.  \u201cPlaying in another country is never easy, it can be very tough at times adapting to a new culture. People don\u2019t realise the sacrifices and being away from your family can be challenging. There are a few of us playing in the Super Lig and it is nice to know we are all connected in some way. I will wish him all the best.\u201d Will Ariyibi want to swap shirts with Alli? \u201cI assume he will want mine,\u201d he jokes.  Home is Oxford for Ariyibi; he has great affection for Quarry Rovers, and coaches Neil McCrea and Darren Gallacher, who helped him reach this point. Alongside Ariyibi in Ankara are the former Real Madrid winger Jes\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez and ex-Manchester United striker Federico Macheda. Jes\u00e9 won two Champions League titles after coming through the ranks at Madrid, while Macheda is famed for his dramatic late winner as a teenager against Aston Villa at Old Trafford. \u201cI grew up as a Manchester United fan and my idol is Cristiano Ronaldo, so to have people that have trained, played and won titles with him as my teammates is quite an honour. Having these sort of talents around can only make you better and is a big turning point from being released at Southampton all those years ago. Learning from players with these careers is great and humbling.\u201d Ariyibi left England because he wanted to play at the top level. He hopes reaching the Turkish Super Lig could help boost his World Cup ambitions. He represented USA at age-group level and believes facing teams such as Besiktas can show that he is ready for the full international stage. \u201cIt\u2019s always been a dream of mine to feature in a World Cup. That would be an honour, we know what football is like and anything can happen. I feel like this season is one of my most important.\u201d A sentiment Alli might share."

                    "body": "It\u2019s coming home, it\u2019s coming home \u2026 You know how it goes. Hang on, though: it came home, didn\u2019t it? In July, when the Lionesses beat Germany with a dramatic extra-time winner at Wembley to win Euro 2022. It was England\u2019s first major trophy since Bobby Moore, Jack and Bobby Charlton, Nobby Stiles, Gordon Banks, Geoff Hurst etc won the World Cup in 1966. With all those years of hurt finally over, David Baddiel said he was happy for his song, Three Lions, to be \u201cput to bed\u201d. Guess what, though: it just got up again, for the World Cup in Qatar, and for Christmas. We will come to the new version \u2013 and Qatar \u2013 later. But first, rewind to the summer of 1996 when a wave of Britpop, new laddishness and optimism was washing over the country. The Football Association asked Ian Broudie of the Lightning Seeds to write a song for the European Championship. He came up with a catchy melody and a chantable refrain. The comedians David Baddiel and Frank Skinner, who presented the comedy football TV show Fantasy Football League, wrote lyrics that were yearning and plaintive and hopeful about what it was like to be an England fan. \u201cIt\u2019s coming home\u201d referred to the fact that this was the first major international football competition to be held in the UK since 1966, and also to the hope that success and glory might return. The fans adopted the song and took it to heart. When England beat Scotland in the group stages, it echoed around (the old) Wembley Stadium: \u201cI have never been somewhere where something so spontaneous \u2013 this is our song, the people\u2019s thing \u2013 happens. It felt amazing,\u201d says Baddiel. Baddiel, Skinner and Broudie, a little less fresh of face but perhaps wiser inside, have come to the Guardian\u2019s offices to talk about the song that never went away. \u201cI\u2019ll let them do most of the talking,\u201d says Broudie, gently. \u201cThey\u2019re good with words.\u201d He sits, looking on wryly through his sunnies, occasionally chipping in almost apologetically but \u2026 well, wisely. \u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of community when you\u2019re all singing: \u2018It\u2019s coming home.\u2019\u201d Baddiel and Skinner are good with words. They josh and rib \u2013 at times it is as if those years have melted away and they are back on that Fantasy Football League sofa, a set that transplanted their home life (they shared a flat at the time) to television. Good times. \u201cI\u2019m not much of a looker-backer, but I would say, for me, that was pomp,\u201d says Skinner. \u201cI was red hot in 1996.\u201d  I wonder if there is anything they look back at less fondly, that makes them wince? \u201cAre you talking about Jason Lee?\u201d asks Baddiel. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make me wince, it makes me ashamed,\u201d says Skinner. On their show, they repeatedly ridiculed the Nottingham Forest player Jason Lee\u2019s hairstyle; in some sketches, Baddiel appeared in blackface. It was, they admit, inexcusable, sustained, ugly, racist bullying. I\u2019m not going to go into it massively here: Skinner has talked about it frankly and extensively in a recent Guardian interview; Baddiel has a programme about antisemitism on Channel 4 on Monday in which he addresses his own racist transgressions by visiting Lee to listen and to apologise.  \u201cIt happened because we used to dress up as cartoons of footballers all the time, and we didn\u2019t think how that is different when you are impersonating a black person. That was bad and mistaken,\u201d says Baddiel. \u201cWe fucked up. We have had conversations about how it happened; I certainly don\u2019t want to defend it in any way,\u201d says Skinner.  By writing an England football song, were they somehow associating with the darker underbelly of hooliganism and nationalism? Skinner reckons the opposite. \u201cI think 96, that song and \u2013 strangely \u2013 the cross of St George seemed to bring less menace than the union jack. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m Catholic. That was the first time it felt more family. I\u2019m not saying it can\u2019t all go off at games \u2013 I was at the final of the men\u2019s Euros last year \u2013 but there was no one chanting \u2018No surrender to the IRA\u2019 or stuff like that. That rightwing thing seemed to go in 96.\u201d Baddiel agrees. \u201cBecause of things that have happened since, like Brexit and the hardening of the far right, it might look different now. But, at the time, the music and the vulnerability of the lyrics meant people were singing a song that was patriotic, yearning after this idea of England that was not nationalist or aggressive. It was a song about losing. As a result, the singing of it and waving of flags felt to me like a type of gentle non-aggressive patriotism.\u201d Of course, England lost to Germany on penalties in 1996. But the dream lived on. \u201cSeventeen years of hurt never stopped us dreaming; Labour\u2019s coming home,\u201d Tony Blair told his party\u2019s conference that autumn before a landslide new dawn in the spring. At the last World Cup, Croatia\u2019s captain, Luka Modri\u0107, said his team had found the refrain disrespectful, but used that to motivate them to win the game and send England home. \u201cI\u2019m just happy that Modri\u0107 knows our song,\u201d says Skinner. \u201cBut we are making an enormous fuss about whether this is a jingoistic, arrogant thing. I think England can describe itself as being the home of football historically. The game we know, the first league, first cup competition, the rules, the first football association were all formed in England. That\u2019s history \u2013 it doesn\u2019t give you ownership.\u201d Broudie gets a word in: \u201cIf the Olympics went to Greece and they said it was coming home, I don\u2019t think anyone would have a problem.\u201d Skinner reminds us that Greece did host the Olympics \u2013 they went home in 2004, and no one had a problem with it. Baddiel: \u201cAlthough I did a documentary \u2026\u201d Skinner: \u201cOh, you\u2019ve done a documentary about everything \u2026\u201d Baddiel: \u201cI have. It was called David Baddiel on the Silk Road, in which people say they invented football.\u201d Skinner: \u201cThat\u2019s a different argument \u2013 stories about people kicking a pig\u2019s bladder around \u2026\u201d OK, whatever: the song certainly came home and stayed home. Over a quarter of century, it wormed its way into the nation\u2019s consciousness, lying dormant for most of the time, but then breaking out for the competitions, most recently \u2013 and most joyously \u2013 at the Women\u2019s Euro 2022. \u201cIt\u2019s coming home, it\u2019s coming home \u2026\u201d chanted a new, maybe (even) nicer generation of England fans in the place it all began. Manager Sarina Wiegman\u2019s post-final press conference was interrupted by a spontaneous victory conga of singing, dancing Lionesses. \u201cIt\u2019s what they naturally turned to,\u201d says Baddiel, proudly. \u201cNot Sweet Caroline but Football\u2019s Coming Home, to sing in that moment of joy.\u201d *** It\u2019s that moment of joy that kicks off the video for the new version, Three Lions (It\u2019s Coming Home for Christmas). \u201cI\u2019ll be honest, I had to slightly be convinced about doing it,\u201d says Baddiel. Skinner: \u201cI would say I dragged Dave kicking and screaming.\u201d Baddiel: \u201cMy son said, \u2018If you do this I\u2019ll never speak to you again.\u2019 But I sort of love Christmas. I think it\u2019s partly to do with being Jewish and not celebrating Christmas when I was young.\u201d Skinner: \u201cFor me, to do a football song is regarded as a bit tacky by a lot of people. To do one that is also a Christmas song is a double tackiness. You know in mathematics two negatives make a positive \u2026\u201d Baddiel: \u201cSo it\u2019s classy.\u201d In the video, they are back in the flat \u2013 a younger Skinner and Baddiel on the sofa, a younger Broudie in the kitchen making the tea \u2013 then joined by today\u2019s Broudie! They sing together. \u201cIn that scene where there\u2019s two of me, I keep thinking I\u2019m not that one [the older Broudie], I\u2019m that one [the younger Broudie].\u201d It\u2019s lovely, and moving, a duet between the same person at different stages of his life. Who is at the door? Older Skinner and Baddiel! All right, lads?  The new lyrics acknowledge the Lionesses\u2019 pride, but the hurt for the men. Then comes Baddiel\u2019s verse: When they decided on Qatar / Should have checked VAR Hah! Funny. It\u2019s too hot / And too far What? Really? I mean, it is too hot in Qatar, certainly \u2013 that\u2019s why the World Cup is on now, messing up domestic football seasons \u2013 but are those really the issues? \u201cIt is perhaps not the most extreme denunciation of that particular state,\u201d admits Baddiel. \u201cBut then it is a football song and I think lyrics about modern slavery and persecution of gay people would have been hard to get in.\u201d  The mood drops a little. Baddiel: \u201cWe are holistic people. I can say that if I was asked if I\u2019d take a ticket to this World Cup final, I wouldn\u2019t go. I don\u2019t particularly want to support that state, what it does and what it represents. Broudie: \u201cIn some way it has brought these issues up, and highlighted Fifa corruption.\u201d Baddiel: \u201cAnd it is complicated. That can feel like a get-out, but it is. It was in Russia after they invaded Crimea. The [winter] Olympics were in China; the worst ethnic cleansing in the world at the moment is of the Uyghurs in China.\u201d Skinner engages seriously. \u201cI think on one hand the, \u2018We are more civilised than you approach\u2019 has not always turned out well for this country in history. I am also not a fan of the very patronising: \u2018They don\u2019t know any better \u2013 don\u2019t get involved in the culture.\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t get involved\u2019 and \u2018it\u2019s their business\u2019 are dangerous. I attended many anti-apartheid events when I was a student. No one said: it\u2019s their culture, we shouldn\u2019t tell them what to do and, eventually, like they say about people in Arab countries, give them 50 years and they\u2019ll be as civilised as us. No one said that about apartheid. They said: \u2018Fucking hell, this needs to end tomorrow.\u2019 So you could argue that you don\u2019t accept it and it does need to end tomorrow and we shouldn\u2019t be there, or you can also be wary about this superior western view of: \u2018We\u2019ll tell you.\u2019\u201d The Lightning Seeds wouldn\u2019t play Qatar; Skinner wouldn\u2019t do a standup gig there, or a David Beckham. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest: if they said, \u2018Come over and be an ambassador for the World Cup,\u2019 I wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d At least Harry Kane\u2019s going to wear a rainbow armband. Skinner says: \u201cI think Phil Foden before the first game is going to sing [adopting voice of Kermit the Frog], Why are there so many songs about rainbows \u2026 No he isn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cI wondered where that was going,\u201d says Baddiel, jollification returned. No, they don\u2019t wear rainbow armbands in the video. \u201cBut we have two Lionesses in the video, both of whom are gay and out,\u201d says Skinner, referring to Jess Carter and Beth England. \u201cIt is difficult for men\u2019s football to be pointing the finger at homophobia when players are frightened to come out. Women\u2019s football has no problem; I\u2019ve never heard of any of the many out gay female players being abused.\u201d As well as Lionesses, the new video has a kid\u2019s choir and another cameo from hat-trick hero Geoff Hurst, now 80, as Santa, obviously. Jules Rimet\u2019s still gleaming \u2026 at the top of the tree. Maybe it is tacky, but it is also lovely and makes me want to cry a little bit because it is about the passing of time, and survival and still dreaming. There may be a few new lyrics, but it is the same old song, the best football song, and that\u2019s why it is still going. Skinner, Baddiel and Broudie realise that, no matter what else they do \u2013 books, television, records \u2013 this is going to be the one that\u2019s remembered. The thing they will always be best known for will be Three Lions.  Skinner says: \u201cIf I\u2019m desperately trying to establish who I am to someone, it would be my first port of call. If I\u2019m in, say, a pub in Birmingham, it\u2019s no good saying: \u2018Maybe you know my poetry podcast?\u2019\u201d Broudie hasn\u2019t said a lot, but as the man who sowed that seed, wrote the first notes, he can have the last word. He has made some brilliant music, and it used to annoy him that he would probably always be best known for a football song: it\u2019s coming home, it\u2019s coming home \u2026 \u201cI used to think that wasn\u2019t right, but when I look at it calmly and see the musicality of it, how it can be adapted by a brass band or a kids\u2019 choir, I feel in a weird way, maybe it is my finest hour.\u201d"

                    "body": "US soccer has many forces acting against its success. The country shunned the sport after the 1930s, leaving a men\u2019s national team withering and winless. Even after years of progress, soccer lags behind indigenous sports in a crowded marketplace. Add one more powerful force to that list. Entitlement. Also add its close cousin, snowplow parenting, a term referring to those parents who knock down any obstacle standing in front of their kids. The obstacle du jour is Gregg Berhalter, the once and possibly future men\u2019s national team head coach. The parents are Hall of Fame player Claudio Reyna and his wife, Danielle, a roommate and teammate of Berhalter\u2019s wife at the University of North Carolina\u2019s storied women\u2019s soccer program.  And the child, though he\u2019s 20 years old, is Gio Reyna, the Borussia Dortmund attacker who sulked for a few days after Berhalter told him he\u2019d have a limited role at the World Cup. Reyna did come around eventually, and he played the second half when the US were eliminated from the World Cup in a 3-1 loss to the Netherlands. On Tuesday, Berhalter released a statement admitting he had kicked his future wife\u2019s legs in an alcohol-fueled argument in 1991, when they were both UNC student-athletes. He added these startling words: \u201cDuring the World Cup, an individual contacted US Soccer, saying they had information about me that would \u2018take me down.\u2019\u201d To the surprise of absolutely no one, the Reyna family admitted on Wednesday that they had told the federation about the 31-year-old incident, though they denied making any sort of threat. They had opportunity, given that Claudio Reyna and Berhalter were national teammates of the USSF sporting director, Earnie Stewart, and the US men\u2019s general manager, Brian McBride. And they had motive, given not only Gio Reyna\u2019s scant playing time but also Berhalter\u2019s comments at a 6 December conference on moral leadership, in which he said he nearly expelled a player during the World Cup before reconciling. The contents of that conference were not intended to be made public. Nor did Berhalter name the player in question. And yet Gio Reyna all but confirmed the next day that he was said player, and Danielle Reyna confirmed on Wednesday that the comments motivated her to reveal the 1991 Berhalter incident, which she says was worse than Berhalter is letting on. On Tuesday, the same day Berhalter released his statement, US Soccer alerted the public, saying they hired outside investigators as soon as they learned of the incident, on 11 December. That investigation has since morphed: \u201cThrough this process, US Soccer has learned about potential inappropriate behavior towards multiple members of our staff by individuals outside of our organization.\u201d Beleaguered US Soccer officials, already accustomed to being either the referee, the instigator or the instigated in controversies big and small, declined on a Wednesday conference call to give more detail. In short: the Reynas said nothing about a physical fight between Berhalter and his future wife for more than three decades but mentioned it to US Soccer officials after learning that Berhalter had mentioned in a private conference that he had since-resolved issues with a player he didn\u2019t identify who got scant playing time for most of the World Cup. In other words, the Reynas acted like typical soccer parents in the US.  Every youth soccer parent, coach and referee knows these parents. They\u2019re the ones who gush about their kid\u2019s new youth club in August and then rant against it when they leave in May. They\u2019re the ones who intimidate coaches into substitutions at nearly every stoppage in play, lest a player be left on the sideline longer than a few minutes. They\u2019re the ones who gossip on anonymous message boards to trash coaches and clubs. To be sure, complaints about playing time in sports aren\u2019t exactly breaking news. But if there was a World Cup for such griping, the US would surely have a crowded trophy case. Woe be unto the coach who keeps the wrong player out of the lineup of any team from under-9s to the national teams, men and women. Woe be unto the referee who crosses a women\u2019s national team player who feels emboldened by a sycophantic fanbase not just to argue with referees but to humiliate them.  Woe be unto the youth soccer coach who fails to achieve the sometimes-incompatible goals of winning trophies and developing children into prized players who can earn everything from a spot on the local high school varsity to a professional opportunity. This is, after all, a country in which parents took advantage of preferential college admissions for athletes by fabricating their children\u2019s exploits, part of a series of events exposed under the catch-all title Operation Varsity Blues. It\u2019s also a country in which players grow up and see nothing wrong with taking a staggering 90% of the prize money the men earned in the 2022 World Cup and the women will earn in the 2023 World Cup, all while grassroots organizations seethe at seeing the rich get richer. (At a media teleconference on the agreement, I asked representatives from both teams if they plan on building bridges with those who work with youth and amateurs. Silence.) And it\u2019s a culture that rewards players who don\u2019t think they need to listen to coaches or critics. In women\u2019s soccer, the fanbase has adopted the attitude that players are always right, while coaches, league officials and referees are always wrong. In men\u2019s soccer, players are less immune to criticism but have come up through a youth system that all too often pampered them, perhaps to the detriment of their performance. \u201cAre you going to continue to be a bunch of soft, underperforming, tattooed millionaires?\u201d Alexi Lalas asked in 2017 when the men were teetering on the edge of World Cup qualifying failure.  But ultimately, it comes back to the parents. Not every parent. Not every player. But too many. The investigation of Berhalter and any related business may take months. In the meantime, US Soccer must decide whether to offer Berhalter a new contract or look elsewhere. The federation has already shown it can drag out such decisions for more than a year. And so in dragging down Berhalter, the Reynas may also drag down the federation that Claudio Reyna once represented so well and Gio Reyna may yet do the same. Those who are involved with youth soccer have seen it all before. The ironic aspect of the term \u201csnowplow parent\u201d is that those snowplows leave behind scorched earth. At the heart of the matter here are two families, once closely intertwined, torn apart by an argument over playing time and a player\u2019s attitude. Just like we see in youth soccer every day."

                    "body": "On the plane It is inconceivable that Jordan Pickford will not be England\u2019s No 1 despite missing the latest camp with a thigh injury. Gareth Southgate is loyal to his senior players and often prefers to go with the tried and trusted. The manager has repeatedly backed Harry Maguire, even after the centre\u2011back blundered during the 3-3 draw with Germany on Tuesday, and is past the point of experimentation. He values experience and wants leaders like Kyle Walker and Kieran Trippier around. Both are familiar with Southgate\u2019s back three, as is a resurgent Eric Dier, while Reece James\u2019s occasional defensive wobbles are cancelled out by the thrust he offers from right wing\u2011back.  On the opposite flank Luke Shaw, who was a doubt after losing his place at Manchester United, has surely played his way back in after impressing against Germany. In midfield Declan Rice is a guaranteed starter, while Jude Bellingham banished any concerns over his inexperience with a fabulous display against Germany. Jordan Henderson is certain to make the cut if he stays clear of injury and there will always be space for Mason Mount because of his work off the ball, which is enough to make managers stick with the Chelsea midfielder even when he is not playing well. Southgate loved Mount\u2019s goalscoring cameo against Germany. He finished brilliantly after coming off the bench and combining with Bukayo Saka, who also sparkled in his substitute appearance. After struggling at left wing-back against Italy, Saka shone on the right wing at Wembley and is a contender to start, though England are not short of creative options. Phil Foden is too gifted to miss out, for all that he needs to become more decisive, and although Southgate tends to see Jack Grealish as more of an impact player than a regular starter the Manchester City winger is more than capable of making chances for the side\u2019s two main finishers, Harry Kane and Raheem Sterling.  In the departure lounge Nick Pope\u2019s kicking is a concern and he gave away a soft goal against Germany, but the Newcastle goalkeeper appears to have established himself as Pickford\u2019s deputy following two consecutive starts. Arsenal\u2019s Aaron Ramsdale will probably have to content himself with being third choice, even though his form is good and his distribution is vastly superior to Pope\u2019s. At this stage it does not feel as if Southgate is about to spring many surprises. Conor Coady is not an exciting name but Southgate loves the Everton centre-back\u2019s sunny demeanour and knows that he is comfortable in a back three. John Stones, who was having a fine game at right centre-back before succumbing to injury against Germany, will go if he is fit. The same applies to Kalvin Phillips. He has been a key player for Southgate, who would find it hugely frustrating if shoulder surgery deprives him of the City midfielder.  Hoping for a ticket James Ward-Prowse would be the likely beneficiary if Phillips misses out. The Southampton midfielder has constantly been on the fringes of the squad and has pushed ahead of Conor Gallagher, who has dropped back into the Under-21 set-up after a difficult start to the season at Chelsea. Perhaps the energetic Gallagher could make a late push if his form improves following Graham Potter\u2019s appointment as Chelsea manager. Similarly Ben Chilwell, who did not get a look-in during the latest camp, will hope that his fortunes improve under Potter. However Southgate has repeatedly overlooked the left-back, who could be a high-profile omission if he continues to struggle for regular starts at Chelsea. A lot can change in two months. Many people would like to see Fikayo Tomori take Maguire\u2019s starting spot but Southgate seems less convinced about the Milan defender. The worry for Tomori will be that he loses out to Crystal Palace\u2019s Marc Gu\u00e9hi, who was on the bench against Germany. As for Nottingham Forest\u2019s Dean Henderson, his hopes surely rest on Pope or Ramsdale getting injured or experiencing dramatic slumps in form. Of course the biggest story would be if Trent Alexander\u2011Arnold, whose club form has been underwhelming, is left out. Does Southgate trust the Liverpool right-back? The evidence suggests otherwise given that he had no minutes during the latest camp and ultimately there is no point selecting the 23\u2011year\u2011old if he is not going to be used, particularly as accommodating four right-backs would probably force Southgate to leave out a forward player. What of those attackers? Jarrod Bowen has been involved in the last two squads but the West Ham winger is off colour and his chance may have passed given that he did not feature against Italy or Germany. Tammy Abraham is yet to demonstrate that he can deputise for Kane and has only scored twice for Roma this season. Ivan Toney has not been fully discounted following his first call-up, but the Brentford striker remains uncapped and will surely be vulnerable if Marcus Rashford recovers from injury and continues his resurgence at United. Rashford should be in if he is fit and firing. He boasts a decent goalscoring record for England, offers more experience than Toney and is more flexible and slippery than Abraham. Watching from the sofa Southgate has not ruled out a return for Jadon Sancho, who looks a better option on the wings than Bowen, but if the United winger\u2019s strong start to the season was not enough this time then the prospect of him making it to Qatar is slim.  Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Ollie Watkins, Callum Wilson and Patrick Bamford look unlikely to make it as Kane\u2019s deputy. Emile Smith Rowe needs to focus on becoming a regular starter for Arsenal and Southgate remains unmoved by James Maddison, even though the Leicester midfielder is one of the most creative players in the Premier League. Sam Johnstone and Fraser Forster are unlikely to make it as the third-choice goalkeeper. Full-backs such as Kyle Walker-Peters, James Justin and Tyrick Mitchell have drifted away. In central defence the ship has sailed for Aston Villa\u2019s Tyrone Mings, while Arsenal\u2019s Ben White has fallen behind Tomori and Gu\u00e9hi. "

                    "body": "The Football Association has sought, and believes it has assurances, that LGBT+ couples who hold hands in Qatar during the World Cup will not face prosecution.\nThe FA has also been told that supporters with rainbow flags will not be arrested \u2013 as long as supporters do not \u201cdisrespect\u201d the local culture and norms by draping them over mosques.\n\nQatar\u2019s laws, which criminalise same-sex relationships, have raised considerable concern among LGBT+ fans who fear for their safety at the finals this winter.\nAlthough those laws will stay in place during the tournament, the FA chief executive, Mark Bullingham, said he had been encouraged by talks with the Qataris \u2013 as well as the introduction of an \u201cenabling law\u201d for the World Cup, under which minor offences will not prosecuted.\nOn a day when it was announced that the England captain, Harry Kane, will wear an anti-discrimination armband in Qatar as part of the FA\u2019s plans to highlight human rights, Bullingham was asked what would happen if any England LGBT+ fans were arrested for holding hands at the finals tournament.\n\u201cWe absolutely have been asking those questions of the Qatari authorities over the last six months,\u201d Bullingham replied. \u201cBut the laws you\u2019re referring to actually get suspended for a period of time before the World Cup, so the actions you are referring to aren\u2019t illegal.\u201d\nBullingham also appeared to broadly praise the Qatari authorities for listening to the FA\u2019s concerns over LGBT+ issues, saying: \u201cThey\u2019ve absolutely told us all the right answers for anything we\u2019ve talked about, even down to \u2018are our rainbow flags allowed\u2019?\n\u201cYes, absolutely, as long as someone doesn\u2019t go and drape them on the outside of a mosque \u2013 that was one example we were given \u2013 and were disrespectful in that way. They have absolutely been briefed to be very tolerant and act in the right way.\u201d\nDespite Bullingham\u2019s upbeat tone it remains highly unclear where the bar for a \u201cminor offence\u201d will be set \u2013 whether that is kissing in public or even holding hands. Sources close to the Qatar authorities continue to maintain that fans will still have to respect the local culture, where public displays of affection are frowned upon, and have been opaque in confirming where the line will be drawn.\nBullingham also conceded he had met the Three Lions Pride supporters group, which advocates for England\u2019s LGBT+ fans, and some were still worried about travelling to Qatar.\n\u201cWe understand their concerns,\u201d Bullingham said. \u201cWe met with them and I understand quite a few of them won\u2019t be going out.\n\u201cThe message we have had from Qatar overall is that everyone is welcome and those communities are absolutely welcome. Where they have been a bit frustrated is that they have asked several follow-up questions and not got the answers.\n\u201cI think a few of them feel they have timed out in terms of getting the information they need to know they are safe on the ground,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have asked the question in lots of meetings with the security teams on the ground and they all give the right answers, but there is certainly more information needed.\u201d\n\nThe FA is also calling for Fifa and the World Cup organisers to ensure families of migrant workers who have lost their lives or have been injured in construction projects receive compensation.\nLess than two months before the tournament starts, the issue of human rights in Qatar remains an ongoing concern. The Guardian has highlighted how workers employed on World Cup-related projects are earning a basic wage of 1,000 riyals (\u00a3225) a month, the equivalent of about \u00a31 an hour.\nAmnesty has also called on Fifa to set aside at least $440m for the hundreds of thousands of migrant workers in Qatar who have suffered human rights abuses during preparations for the World Cup \u2013 the same as the prize money due to be handed out at the competition."

                    "body": "This article is part of the Guardian\u2019s World Cup 2022 Experts\u2019 Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 32 countries who qualified. theguardian.com is running previews from two countries each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 20 November.\nThe plan\nWhile most nations were busy booking hotel complexes in Doha and entering existential national debates on final squad selection, Australia were still treading the path to qualification. To say that road, which stretched thousands of kilometres across Asia, was a long one would be an understatement \u2013 Graham Arnold\u2019s side played a mammoth 20 qualifiers over 1,008 days before finally sealing their place in Qatar via an intercontinental playoff against Peru in June this year \u2013 after extra time and penalties, of course, just to prolong the journey that bit longer.\nA fifth consecutive appearance at a World Cup ranks as a major feat for a nation where football remains a fringe sport in a competitive domestic market. So too for this squad of players, whose limitations are at times all too evident, despite setting a world record for the most consecutive wins in a single qualification campaign at one point last year. That streak quickly gave way to a run of poor form \u2013 including defeats to Saudi Arabia and Japan (twice), and dropped points against the Saudis, China and Oman \u2013 that resulted in the Socceroos ceding what seemed to be a nailed-on automatic qualification spot, and forced them down the playoff route.\n\nHowever, they arrive in Qatar with the euphoria of that shootout win over Peru still fresh in minds and off the back of wins over New Zealand in their only two outings since. Arnold cut a buoyant figure after the second of those warmup games, joking that he planned to \u201creach out to Panadol for a sponsorship\u201d, such were the selection headaches his players were giving him.\nThat has since been somewhat tempered by injury clouds hanging over a number of players, including the attacking midfielder Ajdin Hrustic, key defender Harry Souttar and winger Martin Boyle, although when confirming the final 26-man squad, Arnold appeared upbeat over all three players\u2019 chances of proving their fitness in time for the opener against France. \n\nThe coach\nGraham Arnold has ridden extreme high and lows \u2013 mostly lows \u2013 since taking over after the 2018 World Cup. In March, the 59-year-old was seemingly facing the sack with the qualifying campaign imploding. By June, once Australia had won two unlikely playoffs, he was being hailed a tactical genius. Arnold\u2019s philosophy has divided opinion for a decade of mostly domestic club management, particularly around his reliance on dead balls and transitional play. But his realism is a strength, and he understands the virtues of deploying players in roles similar to the ones they fill with their respective clubs.\nStar player\nThis Australian vintage may lack a standout star of the calibre of Tim Cahill, Mark Viduka or Harry Kewell but, when on song, Ajdin Hrustic can lay claim to being the Socceroos\u2019 top dog in 2022. The creative midfielder, who poses a goal threat from open play as well as set pieces, was an integral part of the qualification campaign and how he responds to an ankle ligament injury sustained while playing for his club Verona will be key to his country\u2019s hopes in Qatar.\n\nUnsung hero\nJackson Irvine rarely makes headlines \u2013 defensive midfielders rarely do \u2013 but his growing importance to the Socceroos should not be underestimated. The Melbourne-born player greases the wheels of Arnold\u2019s machine from a deep-lying central position, while providing a goal threat from set pieces and late runs into the box. He played a crucial part in the qualification campaign and, having been installed this season as co-captain of St Pauli in Germany, the 29-year-old is becoming a leader on and off the pitch for Australia.\nProbable lineup\n\nQatar stance\nSixteen Australian players released a video at the end of October, raising their concerns over the human rights issues in Qatar. The group \u2013 which included captain Mat Ryan \u2013 became the first collective voice of players to be heard in the build-up to the tournament. Football Australia, which had until that point been relatively silent on the issues, and the players\u2019 union, Professional Footballers Australia, also released statements condemning the suffering of migrant workers and LGBTQ+ people and calling for reform in the country. Arnold has since indicated he expects the focus of his players to be on the pitch in Qatar, saying \u201conce they arrive, it\u2019s all about football. The statement has been made, the players now just need to focus on the game, focus on the football and come here and enjoy this World Cup.\u201d \nNational anthem\nAdvance Australia Fair was published in 1878 by Scotland-born composer Peter Dodds McCormick and first replaced God Save the Queen as the national anthem in 1974 after being preferred to Waltzing Matilda and The Song of Australia in a national survey. The controversial lyrics are divisive though and were finally changed in 2021 to recognise the legacy of Indigenous Australians. The second line now reads \u201cfor we are one and free\u201d instead of \u201cyoung and free\u201d.\nAll-time cult hero\nEver since 16 November 2005, the name of John Aloisi has been indelibly etched into Australian sporting folklore. \u201cHere\u2019s Aloisi for a place in the World Cup \u2026 he\u2019s scored! Australia have done it!\u201d So went the commentary as the big striker\u2019s winning penalty in the playoff shootout against Uruguay sparked bedlam in Sydney and sent the Socceroos to the World Cup for the first time in 32 years. \u201cI still get asked to run around with my top off,\u201d Aloisi wrote 17 years later, soon after another dramatic penalty shootout secured the nation\u2019s latest World Cup qualification and produced a natural heir to Aloisi in the shape of jelly-armed goalkeeper Andrew Redmayne.\nMike Hytner and Emma Kemp write for Guardian Australia.

                    "body": "Qatar is a rich Gulf nation known for both its huge oil reserves and its flagrant human rights abuses. It is a dictatorship in which women have to seek permission from their male guardians to marry or work in many government jobs, in which being gay is criminalised and can result in a prison sentence, in which migrant workers are treated appallingly and in which journalists have been imprisoned for reporting critically on domestic politics. Yet all of this will inevitably be minimised as the world\u2019s eyes fall on Qatar for the start of the 2022 World Cup next month. Qatar\u2019s leaders know this and this is why they have paid through the nose \u2013 estimates put it at $220bn (\u00a3190bn), by far the most expensive World Cup of all time \u2013 to host the competition, including lavishing money on efforts to lobby British politicians, as we report today. And so football teams, international supporters, the world\u2019s media and foreign dignitaries will duly head to Qatar for an international sporting tournament that has serious environmental implications and will, some predict, leave a huge carbon footprint. At a conservative estimate, at least 6,500 migrant workers have lost their lives n Qatar since it was awarded the World Cup in 2011. This World Cup is just the latest in a long line of expensive international sporting events that have been hosted by nations that stand accused of fundamental human rights breaches. The 2008 Summer Olympics and 2022 Winter Olympics in China; the 2014 Winter Olympics in Russia; the Bahrain Grand Prix; the 2019 World Athletics Championships in Qatar; the 2019 Anthony Joshua fight in Saudi Arabia: there is an indisputable trend of big sporting events being hosted by rich but unsavoury countries.  This is the reflection of a number of trends. There is the push factor of dictatorships around the world seeking to launder their reputations through the medium of international sport \u2013 $200bn on a World Cup doesn\u2019t just secure international visitors and sporting entertainment but PR that money normally can\u2019t buy. This is particularly valuable in an age when Gulf states recognise that at some point the oil and gas will run out and so are looking to build other sources of power on the world stage. In response, competitions are more and more expensive to put on, as democracies that have to justify the expense to voters get priced out of the market. The 2006 World Cup in Germany cost just $4.3bn. The levels of financial corruption in international sport \u2013 governing bodies such as Fifa and the International Olympic Committee have been notoriously porous to expensive bribes and shady deals in exchange for votes behind the scenes \u2013 have made things worse. All this means that sporting bureaucrats often face unenviable choices, for example, between Beijing in China and Almaty in Kazakhstan for the 2022 Winter Olympics, which ultimately went to the former, necessitating the manufacture of fake snow out of 49m gallons of water. Sports governing bodies advance the case that awarding competitions to countries with questionable human rights records draws attention and scrutiny to their abuses, encouraging liberalisation. Sebastian Coe, president of the International Association of Athletics Federations, claimed at the 2019 World Athletics Championships in Qatar that sport can uniquely \u201cshine the spotlight on issues\u201d and is \u201cthe best diplomat we have\u201d. But there is little academic evidence of these effects. China\u2019s human rights abuses got worse between the 2009 Summer Olympics and the 2022 Winter Olympics. The same is true of Russia and the 2014 Sochi Olympics. And the 1936 Berlin Olympics were undoubtedly a propaganda coup for the Nazis. Sporting competitions would lead to improvements only if sports bodies were to take a tough approach with host nations, attaching stringent conditions that improve human rights records beyond the period of the competition itself. But they are not, generally, willing to do this. In fact, they are much more likely to equivocate and protest their neutrality over the most dreadful human rights abuses. Thomas Bach, the president of the IOC, when asked what he would say to Chinese Uyghurs forcibly separated from their children and interned in concentration camps, declared on the eve of the 2022 Beijing Olympics: \u201cThe position of the IOC must be to give political neutrality\u2026 if we get in the middle of intentions and disputes and confrontations of political powers, then we are putting the Games at risk.\u201d Could there be anything more morally decrepit than a policy of neutrality on genocide? The problem does not start and stop with sport. In truth, the approach the international sports bodies take to countries such as the Gulf states is just a reflection of international politics. Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are considered close allies of the UK, with cooperation on security and the fostering of trade links, including arms sales. The RAF even has a joint air force squadron with Qatar; earlier this year Boris Johnson went to Saudi Arabia to meet Mohammed bin Salman despite the fact that his government had arranged for the Saudi journalist Jamal Kashogghi to be murdered in its consulate in Istanbul in 2018. International sporting competitions should not be awarded to governments with appalling human rights records. But this is a line that western political, not just sporting, leadership has proved all too willing to cross. \u2022 This article was amended on 3 November 2022.

                    "body": "So here we are then. Premier League season on pause while the lower leagues keep chugging away. Knackered and injured players off to a country where it\u2019s illegal to be gay, where women who are victims of sexual assault can be put in prison and where thousands of migrant workers have died since Qatar was awarded the tournament 12 years ago. Welcome to the World Cup.\nOf course, we all know these things by now. In fact the impact of hearing about them again and again seems to numb you from the brutal facts. It\u2019s easier to just talk of migrant workers as a homogenous block rather than remembering that each life is a father, a son, a brother \u2013 most, but not all, of these are impoverished young men from Asia and Africa.\nWe have by now also worked out what our relationship is going to be with this World Cup. From a full boycott at one extreme to free flights and tickets in return for some positive tweets and keeping an eye on those around you. Fan by day, Stasi by night.\n\nThis tournament is football\u2019s equivalent of a dirty burger \u2013 you know it\u2019s come from the power-washed off cuts of a cow following a life on death row bunched up with thousands of others before being slaughtered. But you just have to eat it.\nIt\u2019s instinctive to get excited by the World Cup \u2013 smiling at that picture of James Maddison with England face paint as kid, losing yourself in Dafydd Iwan\u2019s Yma o Hyd, or watching the Uruguay squad announcement film and just thinking how much you love football. There\u2019s a beautiful moment where the Australia midfielder Cam Devlin chokes up when he gets the call from his manager, Graham Arnold.\nThe Guardian Football Weekly podcast has recorded a number of special programmes that we\u2019ll release alongside previews of the tournament this week, specifically on the lives of the LGBTQ+ community, the rights of women and the treatment of migrant workers. The reality for these people has been written about extensively: gay dating apps populated by people masquerading as love interests to arrest or beat up genuine users. Meanwhile women rely on a male guardian for virtually all of their rights. And some of the migrant workforce \u2013 female domestic workers can experience a hidden life of abuse and violence, while men live in terrible conditions in insufferable heat \u2013 have paid the ultimate price. What\u2019s most striking is how difficult it is to speak to anyone on the record, such is the fear of reprisals.\nUnicef ambassador and LGBTQ+ ally David Beckham is being paid a reported \u00a3150m over the next 10 years to be an ambassador for Qatar. He has such power and influence that criticism has been thin on the ground from the football world. His support for this tournament legitimises it in the eyes of so many. It\u2019s such a grave disappointment, such hypocrisy \u2013 a legacy completely tarnished. How much money does he actually need?\nTim Cahill, Cafu, Samuel Eto\u2019o, Ronald de Boer and Xavi are all ambassadors, too. All with their name alongside a quote on the website. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to believe in the legacy projects when you see for yourself all the good they\u2019re doing,\u201d notes the Barcelona manager. Who to listen to? Xavi or Human Rights Watch? It is almost impossible to find unambiguous support for the tournament from anyone who isn\u2019t in some way paid by Fifa or the Qatari state.\n\nJ\u00fcrgen Klopp was, in part, right that it isn\u2019t a footballer\u2019s responsibility to be a human rights activist, but footballers are humans too. They live in the world. They have the power to do more than just say: \u201cI\u2019m a football person, I can only talk about football.\u201d See the Socceroos\u2019 powerful video and Jackson Irvine\u2019s call for LGBTQ+ rights to see how it can be done.\nAnd we are all hypocrites \u2013 I don\u2019t know the working conditions of whoever made the hard disc on this laptop. I didn\u2019t check whether my coffee was fair trade this morning. We can all do better. And there are of course human rights abuses in all countries. But the logical extent argument is that you can\u2019t criticise anything without criticising everything.\nSo can we watch with a clear conscience? Can we feel the agony of England\u2019s defeat in pure footballing terms? Why did Gareth wait until the 115th minute to bring on James Maddison?\nAnd what can we realistically do? How much, if any, lasting change will this World Cup create in Qatar is impossible to know. And we will move on quickly. Oh look, it\u2019s the fourth round of the Carabao Cup.\nBut we can at least go into this competition with our eyes open. And focus on Fifa. The #PayUpFifa campaign is worth fighting for, despite Qatar\u2019s labour minister calling it a publicity stunt. The secretary general of Amnesty, Agn\u00e9s Callamard, has called on Gianni Infantino to break his silence on the creation of a workers\u2019 compensation fund of $440m (\u00a3370m) \u2013 equal to the player prize-money pool. Neither Qatar or Fifa wants to accept responsibility. You fear they wouldn\u2019t budge even under a huge wave of pressure. But why not at least try to force their hand?\n\nFifa has insisted it \u201cremains in positive continuing dialogue\u201d with labour organisations and the Qatari authorities over \u201cinitiatives that will benefit migrant workers in Qatar long after the final game of the World Cup\u201d. It has also said there had been a \u201cgreat response\u201d to Infantino\u2019s letter calling for teams to \u201cfocus on the football\u201d, with various teams backing it. But that does not answer the question that remains for the rest of us: What should we all do?\nI\u2019ve been a member of Juan Mata\u2019s Common Goal for a few years, committed to donating 1% of my annual earnings to charity. For this World Cup I\u2019ll give the same again to the families Fifa won\u2019t compensate. It\u2019s not a huge gesture \u2013 perhaps I\u2019m just trying to make myself feel better. Some will say that\u2019s not enough, that you can\u2019t just offset human rights, moreover people\u2019s lives, and they might be right. But it\u2019s something."

                    "body": "A second MEP has been arrested as part of a criminal investigation into alleged bribery, corruption and money laundering at the European parliament. Marc Tarabella of Belgium was taken in for questioning after police arrived at his home at about 6am on Friday, according to Belgian press reports. Tarabella has previously declared his innocence. A statement from Belgium\u2019s federal prosecutor said an MEP identified as \u201cMT\u201d had been arrested for questioning and may soon appear before an investigative judge. It said police had searched a safe deposit box belonging to him in the city of Li\u00e8ge, as well as several offices in the town hall of Anthisnes, a small district in east Belgium where Tarabella has been mayor for nearly 30 years. He is the second MEP to have been detained over the investigation into alleged cash for influence payments from the governments of Qatar and Morocco. In December, a former European parliament vice-president, Eva Kaili, was arrested during a series of raids where police seized bundles of cash totalling nearly \u20ac1.5m. Tarabella\u2019s Brussels home was searched last month, and last week he was stripped of his immunity by the European parliament at the request of the Belgian federal prosecutor. He is suspected by investigators of having taken cash payments of between \u20ac120,000 and \u20ac140,000 to take supportive positions \u201cin favour of a third country\u201d, according to a report drawn up by the European parliament\u2019s legal affairs committee. Investigators believe he is a close associate of Pier Antonio Panzeri, a former Italian MEP thought to be the ringleader of the corruption network. Panzeri recently struck a plea bargain with prosecutors in which he agreed to provide information in exchange for a reduced jail sentence. Panzeri and Kaili were arrested in December along with Panzeri\u2019s former assistant Francesco Giorgi and the head of a Brussels-based NGO, Niccol\u00f2 Fig\u00e0-Talamanca. All four have been held in pre-trial detention. Kaili and Fig\u00e0-Talamanca have denied wrongdoing, while a lawyer for Giorgi has declined to comment. Tarabella, 59, has been a member of the European parliament since 2004, with a two-year gap between 2007 and 2009 when he was a minister in the regional government of Wallonia, the eastern Francophone part of Belgium. He was a member of the European parliament\u2019s delegation for relations with the Arabian peninsula, which includes Qatar. After the scandal broke, he stood down from that position and gave up his membership of the Socialists and Democrats group in the parliament. A month before the scandal emerged, Tarabella participated in a debate in the parliament\u2019s subcommittee on human rights on Qatar and the World Cup. Tarabella, who was not a member of that committee, criticised fellow MEPs who had drawn attention to the deaths of migrant workers building World Cup infrastructure in Qatar. He accused them of basing their criticism on outdated information and claimed neither China nor Russia had faced such questions when they hosted international sports competitions.  \u201cWe didn\u2019t have all of this when we were talking about Sochi or Beijing,\u201d he said, urging MEPs \u201cto actually respect [Qatar\u2019s] journey\u201d."

                    "body": "If only the World Cup could be about the football. Last week, Fifa sent a letter to the football authorities of the 32 competing nations to urge them to \u201cfocus on the football\u201d and to ensure it is not \u201cdragged into every ideological or political battle\u201d. Which is fine so long as you are not gay, a woman, a migrant labourer, a believer in democracy or a person with a conscience \u2013 or indeed any of the people Gianni Infantino claimed to be in his risibly hypocritical speech on Saturday.\nThis is, of course, the same Fifa president who was at Davos earlier in the year and who last Tuesday spoke at the G20 summit in Bali, calling for a ceasefire in Ukraine for the duration of the World Cup \u2013 a laudably neutral position, providing you are unaware Ukraine has just recaptured Kherson and has momentum such that any pause in the fighting is of clear advantage to Russia and Vladimir Putin. Infantino, coincidentally, was awarded the Order of Friendship by Putin in 2019 after Russia had hosted the World Cup. How complicated these things are! Thank goodness Infantino overcame the ginger jibes to do the politics for us.\n\nSo to take him at his word and focus on the football \u2013 which is, after all, the reason Fifa exists \u2013 the idea that football\u2019s authorities actually have the good of football at heart is laughably naive. Any governing body that cared more about the game would not deliver bloated tournaments such as the Euros that feature the mucky compromise of best third-place teams going through. That means a lot of games lack jeopardy, while teams who play later have the advantage of knowing exactly what they need to do to progress. It is not yet clear how the 48 teams will be arranged for the next World Cup but it is hard to see a good way, so we should probably enjoy the clean simplicity of eight groups of four while we still can.\nIn an ideal world teams would be turning up refreshed and prepared. There would have been a break after the domestic season ended so squads could have a couple of weeks together to fine-tune systems. Some sides have done that but any player based in England, Germany, Italy, France, Portugal or the Netherlands had a week. Clearly that is not enough. There have never been fewer than 16 days (and 20-24 is more usual) between the Champions League final and the start of a World Cup \u2013 which means most players have had around four weeks to prepare.\nIt is true that a lot of teams played in either the Euros or the Copa Am\u00e9rica last summer or in the Africa Cup of Nations earlier this year and so, for some, the preparation is already largely done. But there has been little chance for teams to experiment or make changes since: in common with most of Europe, England\u2019s past six games were all in the Nations League, and four of those came in June when the players were exhausted.\n\nCome September for the final two Nations League games that also doubled as World Cup preparation, Gareth Southgate, to take one example, was left in effect with a choice of either picking Harry Maguire to see if he could still prosper with the national team despite struggling at Manchester United or trialling possible replacements on the left side of central defence. He opted to stick with what he knew so neither Fikayo Tomori nor Marc Gu\u00e9hi is in England\u2019s 26 while Maguire is almost certain to start, despite his indifferent form.\nSouthgate, presumably, would also have liked a friendly or two to see how Ivan Toney, or indeed James Maddison, fared in an England system before making the decision to select the latter and discard the former. But there has been no opportunity.\n\nWill that matter? For teams that were fairly settled, perhaps not too much. Argentina won the Copa Am\u00e9rica and can rumble on. Senegal won the Cup of Nations and have essentially been building for four years. Injuries to Giovanni Lo Celso and Sadio Man\u00e9 complicate matters but essentially they know what they are doing. But Ghana, for instance, have installed an entirely new coaching structure since the Cup of Nations and would probably have benefited from more than two friendlies between the summer and naming their squad.\nThe Cup of Nations offers clear evidence of the lack of preparation time. Because of the compressed calendar and Covid protocols, no side had more than a week of buildup and many found themselves training with reduced squads. So the first round of games was extremely risk-averse, with most teams preferring to sit deep and few having had time to develop the fluency to overcome such tactics. Those fixtures yielded only 1.12 goals per game, as against 2.06 for the rest of the tournament.\n\nIt may be that that checks the direction in which international football has seemed to be going. Portugal won Euro 2016 and France reached the final of that tournament and won the 2018 World Cup with grim cussedness, keeping things tight and looking to nick a goal from a set piece or via a moment of brilliance from a forward. It is that model, with limited pressing, that Southgate\u2019s England largely follow.\nOther contenders, though, seem to have moved on: it may not be as sophisticated as the top club sides but Spain and Germany, even Brazil and Argentina, play a form of pressing game. Perhaps the muscle memory is strong enough for them to be able to pick up their style straight away but, if not, there could be an advantage for the more rigid, lower-block sides such as England, France and Portugal.\nBut the point is less what a successful style is likely to be than that the schedule of the competition is having an impact upon, and perhaps even slowing, the evolution of the game. Judge Fifa on the football? Happily: apart from all the more serious issues, Fifa has failed the sport it is supposed to govern and protect."

                    "body": "As some of the biggest names in football gather in Doha for today\u2019s World Cup draw, commentators will no doubt point out how much money Qatar has lavished on its preparations for the sporting mega-event. They will talk of its vast, gas\u2011fuelled wealth and the $500m (\u00a3380m) a week it was at one stage spending on new stadiums, transport links and infrastructure. But despite the billions spent, Qatar\u2019s World Cup infrastructure has been built on the cheap. Hundreds of thousands of workers have been forced to pay for their own recruitment and labour for years earning poverty wages. In villages and towns across South Asia and parts of Africa, young men desperate for work sign up with recruitment agents who, often in collusion with companies or brokers in Qatar, illegally extract huge sums from them in return for a job.  It can take a low-wage worker from Bangladesh a year of hard labour just to recoup the fees.   For some the bargain eventually pays off; money is sent home, houses are rebuilt, children sent to better schools and marriage dowries paid. Many workers return to Qatar multiple times, a sign perhaps of a lack of opportunities at home, but also that migration can work. But for many others, it\u2019s a trap. They find themselves deep in debt, unable to change jobs and on very low wages. In 2014 I met a worker building the Al Janoub stadium who was earning overtime pay of 45p an hour. In 2016, Amnesty International found scores of workers maintaining the green spaces around the Khalifa stadium earning a basic salary of about 50p an hour. Two years later, the Guardian interviewed a worker at Al Rayyan stadium earning about 60p an hour. And last year I met dozens of workers employed at Fifa-endorsed hotels, earning a basic wage of \u00a31.25 an hour or less. When the case of low wages at Al Janoub stadium was reported, the local organising committee said it was \u201cworking with the contractor to rectify any non-compliance\u201d. At Al Rayyan, the committee said it had rectified the case. These are not just a handful of extreme examples. When Qatar introduced a basic minimum wage the equivalent of \u00a31 an hour last year, the UN\u2019s International Labour Organization said that more than 400,000 workers would benefit. In other words, close to half a million workers were earning less than that at the time. That is assuming they get paid at all. Wage theft appears rife in Qatar: we reported on accounts from some of the men who built the offices used by the World Cup organising committee, as well as some of those who have worked on World Cup stadiums. Last month Human Rights Watch highlighted another case involving workers who had not been paid for up to five months. The Qataris point to labour reforms, announced in 2020, as a sign that things are changing. They also cite the abolition of the much-criticised kafala system, which barred workers from changing jobs, and the introduction of a minimum wage. Narad Nath Bharadwaj, Nepal\u2019s former ambassador to Qatar, told me that conditions for workers in Qatar are better than in other Gulf states but described the reforms as \u201csymbolic\u201d. He particularly criticised workers\u2019 wages, saying they receive far less than in other countries with similar levels of affluence. \u201cIt\u2019s a dire situation when workers are exploited, paid paltry wages, made to work eight to 10 hours a day in the inclement climate,\u201d he said.  Symbolic or not, reforms are not enough. According to the UN\u2019s Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, when business-related human rights abuses occur, \u201cstates must take appropriate steps to ensure \u2026 those affected have access to effective remedy\u201d. The local World Cup organising committee has taken an important step in that direction by requiring companies with stadium contracts to partly repay the recruitment fees of workers. But these men only ever made up a small fraction of Qatar\u2019s migrant workforce. Hundreds of thousands more have no prospect of repayment. Even in death, migrant workers often pay their own way. Families of workers who died have told me that the only help they got from Qatar came from their loved ones\u2019 co-workers, who gave up their own money to send a donation, often to help with costly funeral rituals. The Qatari authorities and Fifa talk a lot about the positive legacy of the World Cup. The local organising committee said: \u201cThis tournament is a powerful catalyst for delivering a sustainable human and social legacy ahead of, during and beyond the 2022 Fifa World Cup.\u201d But a real legacy would be to help ensure compensation for those who have suffered: men like Tilak Bishwakarma. Nine years ago, I met Tilak as he cremated the body of his son, Ganesh, on the banks of a river near his home in western Nepal. Ganesh had died in Qatar just months after arriving. When I got in touch with him recently, Tilak said the family had received no compensation from his employer. In fact, his son\u2019s death meant they had no way to pay back the loan they took out to pay for his job. \u201cMy heart cries whenever I think about him,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was my fate to cremate my son, while it should have been the other way round. Nothing hurts a father more than cremating his son.\u201d A spokesperson for the Qatar government said: \u201cThere are complex challenges that need to be overcome to protect economic migrants globally, including in Europe. For its part, Qatar is committed to eradicating illegal recruitment practices in its labour market and supporting efforts to tackle abuse and exploitation throughout the global economy.\u201d The spokesperson highlighted a number of initiatives the government has taken to address the payment of recruitment fees, including setting up recruitment centres in major labour-sending countries. \u201cCompanies in Qatar are legally required to compensate the families of all workers who lose their lives in a work-related incident,\u201d the spokesperson added."

I\u2019m here for that. Don\u2019t criticise anyone. Don\u2019t criticise Qatar.\u201d And in that moment it became clear what we were watching. Here he is: Football Jesus. Behold for He walks among us.\nDoes Football Jesus not bleed for you? Does He not accept medals from Vladimir Putin on your behalf? Like Actual Jesus, is He not (not literally) struck down (not actually struck down) by the stones (not real stones) of the unjust, the heretical, the human rights charities?\n\nA little later Infantino briefly became Football Mandela (\u201cDo we want to continue to divide? Do we want to spit on others because they look different?\u201d asked the man who has promoted what is in effect a racially segregated society). But mainly he was Football Jesus. And what is really clear, the one thing nobody should doubt, is that Football Jesus had a message in Doha. And that message was \u2026 well, what exactly?\nInfantino spoke for an hour and a half in total. At times the spectacle was so captivatingly grotesque you didn\u2019t want to breathe or cough for fear of breaking the magic.\nBecause this speech was also Infantino\u2019s moment. This was his Imagine, his I Have a Dream, his Earth Song, his Now We Move on to Liars. With this screed of whining imperial discontent, I declare this World Cup open.\nReally, though, in between the pull quotes and the killer lines, Infantino\u2019s performance was something far more disturbing. This was the sound of a man who seems not just tired and angry but oddly hollowed out, who has spent so long residing close to death and to corruption by others that it has begun to rot him from the inside like a dead fish.\n\nThe opening remarks will take the headlines. Striding to his podium with an air of grandiose faux humility, Infantino paused, let the silence gather, then shared his feelings. \u201cToday I feel Qatari. Today I feel Arab. Today I feel African. Today I feel gay. Today I feel disabled. Today I feel [like] a migrant worker.\u201d\nIt is tempting to marvel at the virtuosity here. Accused of betraying the rights of assorted minority groups, of promoting only the interests of the powerful, in the space of three short seconds Infantino wore gay face, he wore African face, he wore disabled face.\nMost cynically, Fifa\u2019s president dressed himself up in the clothes of a deceased migrant worker killed building that \u00a34bn cash machine. Later on, explaining his struggle against prejudice as a white man in Switzerland, he brandished his own red hair and freckles like a magician triumphantly producing a rabbit from a bowler hat.\n\nIt was, it goes without saying, a wretched spectacle \u2013 not to mention myopic, tin-eared and oddly lost. Either side of which Infantino basically talked a lot of horse shit. There will be wider fact checks available on the many half-truths and misleading angles spouted here. Some stood out.\nAt one point Infantino seemed to be saying that Qatar offers hope and succour to the poor and desperate people of the world, whereas Europe closes its borders and refuses to help. There are a great many things wrong with the UK. But it is also a longstanding complaint that Qatar is profoundly opposed to helping asylum seekers and refugees. Last year Qatar took just 197 refugees despite having a war on its doorstep and being one of the world\u2019s richest nations. Zambia took 75,000. The UK took 137,000. Infantino is not just dissembling here, he is simply wrong.\nThere was plenty more of this stuff. Infantino suggested his own trip to Iran had brought peace and tolerance to the nation. \u201cIf a few thousand women in Iran are happier because of me, then I will take every criticism,\u201d he schmoozed, which will certainly come as interesting information to the women of embattled, brutally patriarchal Iran.\n\nHe boasted about Fifa\u2019s new human rights strictures on World Cup bids. \u201cSo would Qatar be allowed to apply as a host now?\u201d he was asked. \u201cYes of course because the World Cup is open to all,\u201d Infantino bounced straight back.\nAt times like these you see his thin but dogged talent, the thing that has put him on that stage, the sense of a giant marzipan man oozing into whatever shape fits the moment, sliding under the door out of reach, altering the contours of his face \u2013 marzipan concern, marzipan defiance \u2013 as it turns from side to side.\nHe did make some legitimate points. Fifa\u2019s basic argument is that things in Qatar are not perfect, but they are better than they were. And that nobody but Fifa has addressed these issues, which is true if you ignore everyone else who has been addressing these issues for years. But the World Cup has undoubtedly made some things happen.\nHe is also right that the cancellation of beer sales within the stadium complex is not such a huge issue in itself. The fat end of the wedge is, frankly, already upon us. Drinking beer is not a human right, not least in an Islamic country. If the hosts are uncomfortable, whenever that emerges, frankly it is hard to argue back.\nAside from all that, beneath the faux concern and the cod-statesman stuff, the base note of this extraordinary show was rage. Infantino is clearly furious with his critics, furious that this thing cannot be bent to his will. And by the end it had become hugely engrossing just to see someone so blind to his own contortions, so shameless, and quite clearly losing his grip on his own spectacular.\nInfantino announced at one point that he feels \u201c200% in control\u201d of this World Cup, which sounds like the kind of thing someone might say just as their World Cup rears up and gallops off into a creak. Not least when that World Cup is already reeling from sponsor slap-down, shifting dates and constant noises off.\nThis is the most alarming part of Gianni\u2019s song, the Infantino Monologues. For all the inanity and toxic spin, one fact remains. That person up there, Corporate Spartacus, with his gay-migrant-African call to arms, is actually in charge of this show, caretaker of this shared sporting jewel. The global game, always such a faithful reflection of the global times, has rarely looked so busted, so loose on its hinges, so out of control."

The Rainbow Wall, a Welsh LGBTQ+ fans\u2019 group, said on Twitter: \u201cNot the men, just women. @FIFAcom ARE YOU SERIOUS!!\u201d\n\nThe former Wales footballer Laura McAllister, a trustee of the FAW Trust, was among those to have a rainbow\u2011coloured bucket hat taken away before entering the stadium to watch the team\u2019s first game at a World Cup finals since 1958.\n\n\u201cSo, despite fine words from @FIFAWorldCup before event @Cymru rainbow bucket hats confiscated at stadium, mine included.

Yet Silva denied Ronaldo\u2019s situation is a distraction and was asked if he and other squad members have offered support to the 37-year-old.\n\nSilva said: \u201cTop, top, top. The news that comes from England has nothing to do with the national team so I won\u2019t say anything. It doesn\u2019t concern me, it concerns Cristiano. I don\u2019t have to comment. It\u2019s a matter for Cristiano, I\u2019m not a Manchester United player and even if I was I would not answer that because we\u2019re in the national team so I\u2019m not going to talk about it.\u201d\nSilva was asked if there is any friction between Ronaldo and Bruno Fernandes\u2019s, who is also in the Portugal squad and a United teammate, given the divisive nature of the centre-forward\u2019s claims.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any strange atmosphere in our national team between Cristiano or Bruno,\u201d Silva added. \u201cOnce again I say that it\u2019s his issue, I don\u2019t even play for this club. An issue that has to be resolved with the right person. It\u2019s a situation with the club. I see him motivated and focused on the national team like all of us. It\u2019s one more thing to help our country, it\u2019s an individual matter. You only talk about it in press conferences when Portugal has a World Cup to play. I don\u2019t understand your persistence on this subject, because there is nothing.\u201d\nPortugal\u2019s opening match of Qatar 2022 is against Ghana on Thursday. Silva was asked if the team play any different when Ronaldo is not in the XI.\n\u201cIt has to do with the fact that it is a different generation, different players. In the last eight years, almost all the players have changed, apart from two or three. It is a very strong generation, almost all of them play in the best leagues, in the best clubs. When Cristiano is not there, the national team has known how to respond, we are 26 [players] \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter if there\u2019s one or the other [in the team], we\u2019re going to do our best to represent our country,\u201d he said."

                    "body": "\nToday I have very strong feelings. Today I feel Qatari. Today I feel Arab. Today I feel African. Today I feel gay. Today I feel disabled. Today I feel a migrant worker. I feel like them because I know what it feels like to be discriminated, to be bullied as a foreigner in a country. At school I was bullied because I had red hair and freckles. I was bullied, plus I was Italian, so imagine. I didn\u2019t speak good German. What do you do then? You lock yourself down in your room, you cry and then you try to make some friends. You try to engage \u2026 You don\u2019t start accusing or fighting, you start engaging. This is what we should be doing.\u201d\n\nInfantino\u2019s opening remarks set the tone for his unexpectedly lengthy address. They are personalised and speak to his key theme, that of hypocrisy and that the way to effect change is not through confrontation but \u201cengagement\u201d. The metaphor, comparing being bullied for having red hair to the experience of migrant workers who remain exploited in Qatar to this day, appears flippant, but is likely sincere. Infantino has also lumped together the experience of exploited workers and those of LGBTQ+ people whose sexuality is illegal in Qatar, with those of some Qataris themselves \u2013 especially those at the top of society \u2013 who feel they have been the subject of unfair criticism. This gives the impression of a relativist approach to a highly sensitive debate.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy every day to read all these critics of decisions that were taken 10 years ago when none of us was there. Now everyone knows we have to make the best out of it and make the best World Cup ever. Doha is ready, Qatar is ready, it will be the best World Cup ever, of course.\u201d\n\nInfantino is correct to observe that there has been widespread personnel change at Fifa since the decision was taken to award Qatar the World Cup in 2010. According to research by Nick Harris of the Mail on Sunday, 10 of the 22-member Fifa executive committee which voted on the deal have since been banned for ethics violations while another four have either been indicted or convicted of criminal corruption. At the time of the vote, Infantino himself was not a Fifa employee, but secretary general of the European governing body, Uefa.\n\n\nLet\u2019s start with the migrant workers. We are told many many lessons from some Europeans, the western world. I am European. I actually am. I think for what we Europeans have been doing in the last 3,000 years, around the world, we should be apologising for the next 3,000 years before starting to give moral lessons to people.\u201d\n\nIn the year 1,000 BC, the concept of Europe did not exist and those living within the geographical boundaries were emerging from the Bronze Age. But if you substitute 300 for 3,000 then many European countries were colonial powers, putting human beings into slavery and exploiting natural resources. An anti-slavery movement did not appear in the UK until the late 18th century. The question of whether, and to what extent, contemporary European societies are responsible for the past, and should perhaps also undertake restitution, remains an active debate. Again Infantino\u2019s criticism speaks to a perceived hypocrisy.\n\n\nI don\u2019t have to defend Qatar, I\u2019m defending football and injustice. We see here many government representatives coming to Qatar. They all come because a country which has just sand and pearls turns out to have something much more, it\u2019s gas. If there was no gas nobody would care. Now they all come and they all want something and who is actually caring about the workers. Who? Fifa does, the World Cup does and to be fair to them Qatar does as well.\u201d\n\nInfantino is right to observe that western governments, including those of the UK and USA, have a dependency on Qatari natural gas and oil, especially during the current Ukraine war. These governments, however, have not spoken out to criticise the World Cup, instead it has been a coalition of unions and NGOs as well as journalists and, in some cases, football authorities and players. These groups have been critical of Fifa and Qatar\u2019s \u201ccaring\u201d for workers.\n\nHundreds of thousands of workers from developing countries come to Qatar and earn many times more [than at home] and help families to survive. They do it in a legal way. We in Europe close our borders. Those who reach Europe or who want to go to Europe have to go through a very difficult journey and survive. If the EU really cared about the destiny of these people, then EU could also do as Qatar did to create some legal channels where at least a percentage of these workers could come to EU \u2026 give them some work, give them some future.\u201d\n\nCriticism of European treatment of migrants from outside the bloc is widespread and often comes from the same people who criticise the Qatar World Cup. However the European Commission claims that 21.6m people, or 4.2% of the total population, are third party nationals. In the UK, the 2021 census showed that 10m people living in England and Wales had been born outside the country \u2013 16.8% of the total population.\n\n\nI wonder why nobody recognises the progress that has been made since 2016 [when Infantino became Fifa president]? The kafala system was abolished, minimum wages were introduced, heat protections were put in place. ILO, unions acknowledged this, but media don\u2019t, or some don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nMoving from \u201cnobody\u201d to \u201csome\u201d suggests Infantino is aware his claim won\u2019t stick. Media have generally reported on the progress or otherwise of reforms in Qatar, especially through the research of those on the ground, including the International Labour Organization and Amnesty International as well as individual journalists.\n\nThe only way of obtaining results is by engaging, seeking dialogue, not by hammering, insulting. When your child does something bad at school and you tell him he\u2019s an idiot he\u2019s useless and you put him in his room what do you think his response is? If you talk to him say let\u2019s work together you will have better grades, he will recognise that and he will be better. I don\u2019t want to give you any lessons of life I just want you to realise that what is going on here is profoundly unjust.\u201d\n\nDifferent styles of parenting remain in practice. Again, the segue from his first point to his claim of profound injustice seems ambitious.\n\nMany organisations have recognised that workers\u2019 rights standards are similar here to those in western Europe, the standards are similar on safety. Let\u2019s see what happens in the next 10 years.\u201d\n\n\nThis seems a grand claim. Amnesty, in their last update before the World Cup, says forced labour continues \u201cunabated\u201d in Qatar, particularly among security and domestic workers. Pay is regularly withheld from workers, while thousands are still working unsafely, Amnesty say. Building and Woodworkers International, who have been on the ground in Qatar since 2016, say safety standards on World Cup sites have been found to be broadly comparable with western Europe, but they were not replicated in the industry more widely.\n\nPeople [in Qatar] are happy and want to cheer for the teams arriving, and what do I read: \u2018These people don\u2019t look English so they should not cheer for English because they look like Indians\u2019. I mean what is that? Can someone who looks Indian not cheer for England or for Spain or for Germany? You know what this is: this is racism. This is pure racism. They have difficult lives, everyone has difficult lives, we want to have a moment where we don\u2019t have to think about this.\u201d\n\nClaims that south Asians cheering the arrival of England in Qatar were \u201cfake fans\u201d were inaccurate. The accusations did, however, follow the revelation that Qatar had been paying people to be enthusiastic supporters during the tournament. Furthermore, the claim that someone \u201cwho looks Indian\u201d could not support England is different altogether. Infantino may also have been more revealing than intended when imagining an escape from this.\n\n\n[On the banning of beer at stadiums] Every decision taken in this World Cup is joint decision between Qatar and Fifa. There will be eight to 10 fan zones, over 200 places where you can buy alcohol anyway, I think personally if for three hours a day you cannot drink a beer you will survive. Maybe it\u2019s a big thing because it\u2019s a Muslim country, I don\u2019t know. We tried until the end to see if it was still possible. It\u2019s one thing having the plans and designs in place, then you look to see the flows of people, going to different matches, we have four matches on the same day so have to make sure people can go in and go out. That is why we had to take the decision about the beer.\u201d\n\n\nInfantino contradicts widely held views that Budweiser\u2019s beer stands were withdrawn at the request of Qatari authorities. He may be correct, but it was certainly the case that the sale of beer at the stadiums was not only considered possible but actually guaranteed by Fifa as little as two months ago. A spokesperson told the AFP in September that alcoholic beer would be sold \u201cwithin the stadium perimeter prior to kick-off and after the final whistle.\u201d This is no longer the case. However some people will not have to wait three hours for a drink, with VIP boxes still serving alcohol. The World Cup\u2019s \u201cmost luxurious\u201d hospitality offer, the Pearl Lounge, will offer a six-course meal, welcome drinks, champagne, cocktails a dedicated sommelier and \u201cguest appearances\u201d for $34,300.\n\nIf you want to criticise, come to me. Here I am, you can crucify me, I am here for that. Don\u2019t criticise Qatar, don\u2019t criticise the players, don\u2019t criticise anyone, criticise Fifa, criticise me because I am responsible for everything. How many occasions do we have to unite the world? Do we want to continue to spit on others because they look different or they feel different? We defend human rights. We do it our way. We obtain results. It\u2019s a step-by-step process, help us in doing more. Don\u2019t divide, don\u2019t split.\u201d\n\nInfantino\u2019s final remarks neatly encapsulate the whole speech: personally felt, lyrical and combining very different messages in one apparent argument. How many critics of the Qatar World Cup are \u201cspitting\u201d on others because \u201cthey look different\u201d? How many \u201cresults\u201d have actually been achieved? And is \u201cdon\u2019t criticise Qatar\u201d a plea or a demand?"

Croatia face Morocco for the chance to call themselves the third-best team on the planet, which is not a bad claim to have in your back pocket. Here is an attempt to give you six reasons to be joyful about the match.\n1) Bidding an international farewell to Luka Modric After 162 caps (assuming he plays) the Real Madrid midfielder is set to bow out for Croatia. Modric is yet to confirm his international retirement but it looks likely. Either way, at 37, he will not be back for another World Cup. He made his international debut in 2006 and has aged like a fine armagnac. There is no doubt Modric is a key reason his country reached the final four years ago and came so close to repeating the feat in Qatar. Rightly adored in his homeland as one of the most elegant passers of the ball in the world game, Modric will leave a strong legacy behind him and another World Cup medal would be a lovely way to depart.\n2) Morocco could make more historyAlready the first African nation to reach a semi-final, Morocco could become the first to get a podium finish at a World Cup. It would be a positive ending to the tournament for the side that have given it so much. They have achieved greatness, outlasting almost everyone\u2019s predictions. To lose their final two matches would be a sad way to leave Qatar for a side that have shone brighter than most.\n3) Last chance to earn a move There are players in each squad that have shown themselves capable on the world\u2019s biggest stage, creating interest from potentially bigger and better-paying club employers. These players will be eager to prove themselves one final time to ensure they stand out for the scouts. Consistency is important for players, so a lowering of standards should not be accepted by them or their coach, especially when they are looking to better themselves.\n4) The \u2018booby prize\u2019Morocco\u2019s head coach Walid Regragui has described this match as a \u201cbooby prize\u201d but, importantly, it is still a prize. In the TV quiz show 3-2-1, presented by Ted Rogers, losing contestants would get a model of the show\u2019s mascot Dusty Bin as a small token of their failure. They were utterly worthless at the time, but now would surely sell for hundreds of pounds. So, even if the players are not too keen on the match, that bronze medal might come in handy one day.\n5) History for Croatia, tooSince joining Fifa in 1992 after becoming independent from Yugoslavia, Croatia have created a remarkable competitive record. In their first World Cup in 1998 they finished third after losing to France in the semi-final, beating the Netherlands 2-1 in the playoff thanks to goals from Davor Suker and Robert Prosnecki. Croatia failed to make it out of their group in 2002, 2006 and 2014 and failed to qualify in 2010 but went all the way to the final in 2018. Now they are 90 minutes away from another top-three placing. Since 1998 only France and Germany have made it to the final four more often than Croatia, not a bad record for a team that are barely 30 years old.\n\n6) Another chance to see Infantino It seems within seconds of any World Cup match starting, the camera pans to Gianni Infantino looking glum in the stands. The host broadcast camera operator always knows where to find the Fifa president, allowing the world to celebrate his greatness. Rarely has he looked happy when watching a match but he is always there, committed to the cause like a parent on muddy sidelines every weekend. He will make the best of the occasion to celebrate football as a cohesive power for good or some such, while ignoring the empty seats. And if that does not entice you, then nothing will.\nPS: it turns out Belgium beat England 2-0 to clinch third place in Russia. Who knew?\n\nTalking points\nWill illness derail France\u2019s push for back-to-back titles?France preparations for the final have been hit by a virus that has spread through the camp since the semi-final win over Morocco. The same illness that struck down Adrien Rabiot and Dayot Upamecano before the semi-final has reportedly been picked up by Ibrahima Konat\u00e9 and Rapha\u00ebl Varane. Both defenders impressed as they stood firm under intense pressure from Morocco and it would be a huge blow if one or both missed out. The French forward Randal Kolo Muani said: \u201cI think everyone has been careful. The doctors have put in place a hygiene system to avoid the virus spreading.\u201d Has that hygiene system worked well enough, though? GB\nWhere have all the red cards gone?Let\u2019s be honest, some of the most vivid World Cup memories centre around red cards and on-field pandemonium \u2013 think Zinedine Zidane\u2019s 2006 butt, the sound and fury of England v Argentina 1966, or Argentina being reduced to nine men in the rancorous closing stages of the 1990 final. With the exception of the Netherlands v Argentina in the quarter-finals, Qatar 2022 has been curiously bereft of all this. There have been only four sendings-off in this tournament, three of which took place in the closing stages of matches and only one being a straight red. That went to Wales\u2019s Wayne Hennessey for his full-frontal felling of Iran\u2019s Mehdi Taremi \u2013 and only after the VAR intervened. This continues a trend set at Russia 2018, when the number of dismissals tumbled from 10 in 2014 to four. There were a whopping 17 in South Africa 12 years ago. Whether this is a consequence of VAR, improvements in defensive discipline or less officious refereeing is hard to tell. But it\u2019s been striking nonetheless. TD\n\nBeyond the football\nAn app providing migrant workers in Qatar with information on their rights and the possibility of legal assistance has been launched by three trade unions, the first definitive legacy for workers exploited in the process of delivering the World Cup. The failure of Fifa and football associations to deliver positive change for workers has led the the international players\u2019 union Fifpro, the Building and Wood Workers\u2019 International (BWI) and the International Domestic Workers Federation (IDWF) to take action into their own hands by developing a digital platform to provide employment support. A joint statement read: \u201cWith the Fifa World Cup coming to a close on 18 December, International Migrants Day, Fifpro, BWI and IDWF remain committed to supporting the advancement of migrant workers\u2019 rights and conditions. The global unions encourage collaborations from all stakeholders to ensure that the working conditions and fundamental human rights of all workers involved in and around football tournaments are respected and protected.\u201d\nGlobal media-watch\nWith the semi-finals in the rearview mirror, the press in Qatar are predictably extolling the success of hosting the tournament. According to Jinan Al-Sabbagh in Al-Raya, \u201cQatar won great acclaim \u2026 for the impressive success of organising the world\u2019s largest tournament. Qatar amazed the world and made it the pride of the Arabs\u201d. Al-Raya is seen as the semi-official paper of the Qatari state, and said the country \u201cacted as a link that embraced the cultures of the world thanks to its hospitality and the morals of the generous Qatari people.\u201d\nMuhammad Qasabi reported for Al Sharq on a press conference held by the Qatari Sports Media Committee which declared that \u201call the visitors to the World Cup, including athletes, media professionals and fans, have discovered a truth other than that which some western media outlets reported to them, and this is the first gain from Qatar hosting the World Cup\u201d.\n\nFor Al-Watan, the lead story on Friday was of childhood dreams fulfilled, writing: \u201cA decade ago, attending World Cup matches from the stands was a childhood dream for soccer fans in the Arab world. The exorbitant costs of travel and hotel reservations, as well as the remoteness of the countries that usually win the organisation of the championship, were reflected in the reluctance to engage in this experience.\u201d All that, the paper says, has changed.\nThe Peninsula was thrilled that there would be some Qatari representation right at the end of the tournament, with Abdulrahman al-Jassim assigned to referee the third-place playoff. The Croatia head coach, Zlatko Dalic, was less impressed, saying: \u201cFifa has now taken on a huge risk on itself \u2026 I hope that we will not be talking about the referee after the match.\u201d The English-language Qatar Tribune, meanwhile, was keen to stress that \u201cseveral British journalists have noted that Qatar has presented an outstanding model in its World Cup hosting\u201d. The small catch in that story? All of the people interviewed were working for the Fifa website. MBe\nToday\u2019s live match\nCroatia v Morocco, third-place playoff (3pm GMT, BBC One) Walid Regragui spoke on Friday of his desire to be \u201con the podium\u201d, which suggests a more purposeful approach to the third-place playoff than that shown in recent tournaments. Belgium beat a listless England four years ago while a traumatised Brazil succumbed meekly to the Netherlands in 2014. \u201cMy players still have that appetite, they want to finish well,\u201d said the Morocco head coach. \u201cFinishing well\u201d could be the key here, because if there\u2019s one area in which a fine side slightly let themselves down in Qatar it was in taking their chances. Croatia and Morocco shared a reasonably entertaining goalless draw in the group stages and each have improved since then. This should be well worth watching, even if tiredness and injuries \u2013 particularly in Morocco\u2019s case \u2013 may take their toll. TD\n\nThe internet reacts\nEven in a surprisingly dull press conference Gianni Infantino managed to provoke a reaction from many by casually announced there will be a 32-team men\u2019s Club World Cup from 2025, likely to follow the same format as the current Fifa World Cup (unless it is replaced by a 48-team one in 2026). His revelation was made even though no agreements have been made with the relevant domestic leagues, so you can imagine how this went down in some quarters.\n\n\n\nPlayer to watch\nAzzedine Ounahi We can expect Morocco players to figure prominently in the transfer gossip columns next month, and Angers will face a battle to cling on to the busy yet elegant Azzedine Ounahi, who has been an outstanding presence in one of the best midfields in this tournament. Ligue 1\u2019s bottom club could pretty much name their price, if so minded, for a player whose energy, creativity and intelligence have been fundamental to Morocco\u2019s run to the last four \u2013 both as an attacking presence and as an aid to that parsimonious defence. It is to be hoped he gets a full run-out once more on Saturday against Croatia, having come closest to scoring for Morocco when the sides met in the group stages, only to be denied by another of this tournament\u2019s emerging stars, the goalkeeper Dominik Livakovic. TD\n\nAnd finally \u2026\nAfter making jaws drop with his \u201cToday I feel gay\u201d press conference at the opening of the World Cup, there was much anticipation about what outrageous lines Gianni Infantino might spout in his closing press conference. It turns out he didn\u2019t say anything too outlandish at all, apart from lauding the Qatar World Cup as the \u201cbest ever\u201d. In fact, most of the reaction on social media was about how late the Fifa president was for his own show.\n\n\n"

                    "body": "Ever since it won the right to host the 2022 World Cup, Qatar has been the subject of sustained critical scrutiny. A spotlight has been shone on the Gulf emirate\u2019s repression of women and LGBTQ people, and its punishing exploitation of hundreds of thousands of migrant workers. But the picture is incomplete. The fact is that the roots of Qatari repression extend well beyond Qatar, connecting the emirate to the supposedly liberal states of the west. Much of the discourse around the World Cup has carried the implication that abuses in Qatar are an outgrowth of a local conservative \u201cculture\u201d, as juxtaposed with more enlightened \u201cwestern values\u201d. In fact, the persistence of monarchical rule in the Gulf is the result of more than a century of collusion between local elites and the west. If we are serious in our objections to the abuses found in Qatar, then we need to consider how Qatari authoritarianism sits within a much wider system of power, violence and exploitation. The processes of state formation that brought the modern Qatari state into being are inextricably bound up with histories of capitalism and western imperialism. It was British imperial power that first integrated the Gulf states of Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the UAE and Oman into the structures of the global economy with discoveries of vast oil and gas reserves sealing the region\u2019s status as a major material and geostrategic prize. To ensure British influence and privileged access to this prize, local monarchies such as the Al-Thani family in Qatar were built up and buttressed against external and internal challenges. Britain worked with these client elites to develop systems of internal repression designed to foreclose any possibility of nationalist forces overthrowing the monarchies and breaking ties with the west. Even after the Gulf states gained independence in the 1960s and 70s, scores of British civilians remained in their militaries and state bureaucracies, including in Qatar\u2019s, to ensure the regimes\u2019 survival and their correct geopolitical orientation.  In more recent years, Qatar has become one of the world\u2019s leading arms importers, with the regime\u2019s military muscle now provided by the United States, France and other western suppliers. These include the UK, whose contribution includes a fleet of Typhoon military jets. And with its al-Udeid airbase playing host to the forward headquarters of the US military\u2019s Central Command, Qatar sits right at the heart of western power projection into the Gulf, as it has done for more than 100 years. The peoples of the Gulf are no more or less desiring of basic rights and autonomy than the rest of the human race. If repressive monarchy has not given way to democracies and republics in the Gulf as it has elsewhere in the world, this is at least partly owing to a sustained and intensive intervention from the western powers on the side of the local elites. The false notion that authoritarianism in the Gulf is simply a reflection of regional \u201cculture\u201d has its roots in the Orientalist discourse of the colonial era. To this day, racist caricatures of an enlightened west encountering the backward despotisms of the Middle East obscures the relevant history and legitimises the west\u2019s role in the region. This self-serving mythology externalises and circumscribes the blame for human rights abuses in states like Qatar, while preserving a narcissistic sense of western innocence. The regimes themselves are happy to play along with these fictions, presenting themselves as visionary \u201creformers\u201d of societies hidebound by \u201ctradition\u201d and asking the west for patience as they struggle valiantly against the backwardness of their own people. The Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, was widely hailed as a \u201creformer\u201d until the bubble was burst by the murder of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi among a wider, inescapable record of abuses. The Gulf regimes and their western allies have both told the reform story many times, but in truth the only reforms they are interested in are those that deflect political pressure and shore up the conservative regional order.  As an act of \u201csportswashing\u201d, this winter\u2019s World Cup fits squarely into these narratives. Playing into Orientalist notions of \u201ctradition\u201d versus \u201cmodernisation\u201d, the tournament is designed to showcase a Qatari regime heading in the right direction and deserving of the world\u2019s embrace. This is aimed at something more specific than burnishing Qatar\u2019s international public image per se. The real goal is to provide Qatar\u2019s western allies with an alibi for continuing the support that has been so crucial to the regime\u2019s longevity. It is soft power as the currency that buys hard power, with the entire global football community recruited into the transaction. As a Potemkin village of 21st-century capitalism, the 2022 World Cup is not a phenomenon separate from or alien to the west. It is a representative example of the world that western power built. The western brands sponsoring the tournament benefit just as the regime does from the continued exploitation of migrant labour that is making the tournament possible. And to the extent that the tournament serves to sportswash authoritarianism, it will be sportswashing an authoritarianism that has long been a joint venture between the west and Qatar. Only when the spotlight shines on the role of our own governments will true accountability for all this be possible.

There were loud cheers for the captain, Harry Kane, and an even bigger one for Gareth Southgate, especially when the manager turned to wave.\n\nThere were also familiar chants of \u201cEngland! England!\u201d as well as the rather unusual \u201cSouthgate is our super coach! Sterling is our super star! Pickford is our super keeper\u201d.\nIt was another sign that this World Cup, the first in the Middle East and the first to be held in winter, will be very different to the 21 tournaments that have come before it.\nThere have been suggestions on social media that some locals are being paid by the Qataris to add a dash of spice, but the half a dozen or so fans the Guardian spoke to promised they were the real deal. They insisted they made their own jerseys, bought their own tickets to the games and supported England having grown up watching players such as David Beckham.\nThey were also happy to talk about the latest developments in the Premier League \u2013 and were clearly unhappy that a Scandinavian newspaper at the weekend had questioned their authenticity.\n\nSajidh, a 29-year-old mechanical engineer who did not want to give his full name, described suggestions that he and the others were receiving cash to be cheerleaders as \u201cfake news\u201d. He said:\u201cNone of us is getting paid. We are diehard England fans.\n\u201cMy favourite player was Beckham but now it is [Bukayo] Saka. If someone offered to pay us to support England we would turn them down. We are genuine supporters. Many of us grew up watching Beckham and Michael Owen. Our love is to this team.\u201d\nAnother fan, Niyas, from Kerala, estimated that there were 700,000 fans in his region back home and he showed the Guardian an 80ft cardboard cutout of Kane and a mural of the England team in his home state. He also showed a WhatsApp group of supporters with nearly 1,000 members.\n\u201cWe made these England tops ourselves,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one gave them to us. Argentina is the most supported team among Indians in Qatar, followed by Brazil. But then it is England.\u201d\nAs the England squad touched down, Kane insisted everyone was match fit and ready for the first game against Iran on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be massive,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI remember when we were out in Russia in our own little bubble. We saw all the videos from back home going crazy \u2013 it makes a big difference, it motivates us to be successful.\n\u201cWe want to make the fans proud and happy. Of course, there will be some in the stadiums \u2013 we always have great support \u2013 but most will be at home and we just want to make them proud.\u201d"

                    "body": "Five Australian women are suing Qatar Airways in the New South Wales supreme court over a 2020 incident in which they were forcibly removed from aeroplanes at gunpoint in Doha, and some intimately examined without explanation or their consent. The women are seeking damages from both Qatar Airways and the Qatar Civil Aviation Authority \u2013 owned by the Qatari government \u2013 over the \u201cunlawful physical contact\u201d and mental health impacts, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. On 2 October 2020, women on planes on the ground at Doha, including 13 Australians, were subjected to the examinations as authorities searched for the mother of a newborn baby found abandoned in a plastic bag in the departures lounge at Hamad international airport.  Women on 10 flights, including five Australians who were on a Sydney-bound Qatar Airways flight, were removed from planes at gunpoint and taken into ambulances on the tarmac. Some were instructed to remove their underwear and some were forced to submit to invasive gynaecological examinations for evidence they had recently given birth. Women who were examined said they were given no information by officials on why they were being forcibly examined, and did not have an opportunity to provide informed consent. The infant survived.  Sign up for our free morning newsletter and afternoon email to get your daily news roundup  According to the statement of claim filed in the NSW supreme court, three of the five women were subjected to \u201cunlawful physical contact\u201d. \u201cEach of the applications has suffered \u2026 from anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorders and other psychological effects.\u201d The women have incurred medical expenses, and some have suffered economic loss \u201cas a result of needing to take medical leave from work due to the effects of the events on \u2026 mental health\u201d. Papers were served on Qatar Airways at the airline\u2019s Melbourne offices on Thursday. The airline has not responded to requests for comment from the Guardian. Damian Sturzaker, partner at Marque Lawyers, told the Guardian he was \u201cproud to stand with this group of brave women who have been forced to take on the Qatar government after it gravely breached their human rights\u201d. Qatar is an ultra-conservative Muslim monarchy, where sex and childbirth outside marriage are punishable by jail. The mother of the child has since been identified. She is not a Qatari national. Ahead of the football World Cup next month, the country has struggled to reassure critics its promises to protect women\u2019s rights are credible. Facing potentially devastating commercial and reputational damage after the incident, Qatar vowed to guarantee the future \u201csafety and security\u201d of passengers, without further details. The Qatari prime minister, Sheikh Khalid bin Khalifa Al Thani, conceded standard security protocols had been violated, and expressed his \u201csincerest apology for what some female travellers went through\u201d. \u201cWe regret the unacceptable treatment of the female passengers,\u201d he said. An airport security official was charged and prosecuted, and received a suspended prison sentence. But the Qatari government and Qatar Airways have failed to respond to entreaties from the Australian women to \u201cprovide a meaningful apology for the hurt and distress caused\u201d as well as \u201cprovide assurances to both the complainants and the international community that this kind of conduct will never happen again\u201d. Marque Lawyers has filed a complaint on behalf of the women with the Australian government\u2019s National Contact Point, under the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. An initial assessment heard the airline\u2019s \u201clack of response\u201d was a further breach of their rights. The legal action brought this week against Qatar Airways, and the state-run aviation authority, has been lodged in the NSW supreme court. Under the 1999 Montreal Convention, which governs airline liability around the world and to which Australia and Qatar are both parties, an action for damages can be brought before the courts at the place of destination of the aircraft or in the territory where a passenger lives."

                    "body": "Football Ramble: Inside the Qatar World Cup  UnboxedThe Diary of a CEO With Steven BartlettGeneration Gap (BBC Radio 4) | BBC Sounds I\u2019m aware that the current football, erm, situation is not to everyone\u2019s taste. But for those of us who enjoy the game and don\u2019t hate women, LGBTQ+ people or migrant workers, it\u2019s been a bit of an odd week. I\u2019ve limited my participation to listening to the matches. This isn\u2019t a protest, I just don\u2019t really like the analysis/bantz football shows. They sometimes just feel like being talked at by pub bores. Still, if you\u2019re what is usually called a \u201cproper\u201d fan, there are umpteen World Cup audio shows: radio programmes and podcasts are popping out daily from the BBC, indie producers and commercial stations, packed with pundits a-punditing from stadium or sofa. Or you might try Inside the Qatar World Cup, an excellent three-part strand from Football Ramble. Host Kate Mason is that unusual thing: a female football journalist who worked in Qatar for a couple of years (for the beIN Qatar sports channel). Beginning at a seven-a-side women\u2019s game in Doha, the pitch completely hidden so no men can see, she talks to players, fans and coaches, most of whom withhold their names. Mason covers how women are treated in Qatar, the state of the country\u2019s men\u2019s national football league, visits the segregated workers and fan areas and speaks to migrant workers who actually worked on the stadiums. She also talks to Dr Nassar Mohamed, the only Qatari thought to have ever come out as gay (he had to claim asylum in the US), who explains in clear, measured terms just what gay people go through in his home country, including conversion practices and being \u201cdisappeared\u201d by the authorities. Mason is level-headed and sensitive throughout. An excellent series from an independent podcaster. Football, for the Qatari rulers, means business, as it does for many others. The Sidemen, a collective of some of Europe\u2019s most successful YouTubers (KSI, Miniminter \u2026 ask your kids), started their careers by putting up videos of themselves playing Fifa, or mucking about trying to score goals against each other, eventually staging celebrity charity matches watched by millions. Now their manager, 25-year-old Jordan Schwarzenberger, has a podcast, Unboxed, in which he talks to high-profile \u201ccreators\u201d (YouTubers, TikTokers, Instagrammers) and gets them to explain how they became successful.  At first, as a generation above the target audience, I was a bit lost. Who is Zac Alsop and why is Schwarzenberger interviewing him? (Answer: he\u2019s a YouTuber.) But I was won over by both men\u2019s straightforwardness and honesty. And actually, Alsop\u2019s description of what he does struck me as very much like editing a magazine: thinking about how to grab attention, what to offer the reader/watcher, which photo works, which cover line\u2026 Unboxed has lovely sound and crisp editing, plus, if you like your podcasts visual, you can watch the show as well as listen, which helps when discussion turns to specific \u201cthumbnails\u201d, the small still pictures used to promote YouTube videos.  Actually, I enjoyed Unboxed so much I tried out The Diary of a CEO, which I\u2019ve been avoiding because a) it\u2019s so successful it doesn\u2019t need my endorsement and b) I hate business talk. Also c) each episode is an hour and a half long, which is far too lengthy to iron to, even if you tackle the sheets. There are downsides to the show: entrepreneur and host Steven Bartlett\u2019s manner is superior, as though he, and only he, understands the real truth. And the highlights reel at the beginning is OTT. But Bartlett is very thorough, and I loved singer/producer Labrinth\u2019s account of growing up in a religious musical household. Being a guest on The Diary of a CEO is like being invited on to Desert Island Discs, a form of endorsement, so each interviewee is immensely happy to be there and willing to spill whatever beans are needed. Radio 4 is providing a lower-key, old-school business approach in the Generation Gap, where two differently aged practitioners of the same job talk about how they go about things. Last week we met GPs, cab drivers, builders, turkey farmers and, on Tuesday, Jan and Sonya, both hairdressers. Jan, 66, still does perms for her care-home clients, but, explains Sonya, 35, perming has fallen off hairdressers\u2019 training, replaced by how to put in extensions. Times and attitudes change, and such small cultural exchanges can reveal as much as any world-beating tournament."

                    "body": "\u2018Too many people have died to elevate a country\u2019s prestige\u2019\nMy first World Cup was France 98. I was on my summer holidays from school and watched every game. It was magical to see Dennis Bergkamp score against Argentina, the intrigue of Ronaldo before the final and Zizou becoming an icon. They are some of my most cherished memories. Since then it\u2019s been the best four weeks of my life every four years.\nI\u2019ve not been excited at all by this World Cup. I\u2019m not an expert on human rights and would never claim to know more than the person next to me, but it was clear that the authorities in Qatar had no intention of treating workers with dignity. I feel the main failure and most blame should be pointed at Fifa. They knew what they were doing and showed the disdain they truly have for human worth by sending the World Cup there. The World Cup is a summer event. Such a big event needs to be held in a country that has the space and infrastructure. And too many people have died to elevate a country\u2019s prestige; that\u2019s just not right. Daire Sweeney, Ireland\n\u2018This is an immoral, false tournament\u2019\nI\u2019m normally very excited for a World Cup. I live in the US and being a soccer fan here means you are part of a special club of people who follow the game either early in the mornings or late at night. It\u2019s a good way to be social, get to know people, and I made my best friends here through watching or playing the game. The World Cup also wakes up neutrals.\nBut I am boycotting. I haven\u2019t watched a single minute of the qualifiers and I am about to suspend my football podcast feeds \u2013 about eight podcasts a week, from the Guardian and other places \u2013 to avoid World Cup chat. I do not know what I will do with myself; I\u2019m debating watching classic matches from previous World Cups, and I will be watching more American football (which is a totally non-problematic sport with no human rights issues whatsoever, no siree). I\u2019m aware that this is somewhat hypocritical, but show me a professional sport and I\u2019ll show you some corruption, hypocrisy and malfeasance. I\u2019m especially frustrated as a USA v England game would usually be a big event for me and my friends.\nI have no issue with the World Cup being taken to different parts of the globe, but with each World Cup we are getting more and more wasteful and outlandish. South Africa and Brazil are saddled with stadiums that lie unused. Russia abuses human right and has an appalling outlook on homosexuality. Qatar, however, feels beyond the pale. The World Cup should be the best players performing on the biggest stage \u2013 we\u2019re patently not getting that because of the compressed schedule. Doha is clearly unsuited to hosting so many fans. And a country that outlaws gay people means excluding fans. If those are your laws, fine, but you don\u2019t get to host citizens of the world for a tournament unless you welcome everyone. Everyone. Then there are the human rights abuses. We can\u2019t even confirm how many victims there have been because of a lack of transparency from the government. This is an immoral, false tournament. Thomas Bilous, an England fan in the US\n\n\u2018It is appalling yet entirely unsurprising\u2019\nI would normally be very excited about getting together with neighbours to watch games at each other\u2019s houses with much joy and celebration. But I will be completely boycotting this year. Some of my neighbours are a bit surprised, but I can\u2019t support it in any way. I have a trans daughter and there is no way I can support this World Cup if she\u2019s not welcome or would be in danger if she attended. The human rights issue and the treatment of the workforce are even worse issues, of course. It is appalling yet entirely unsurprising that Fifa thought they could get away with this. Jonathan Mowll, England\n\u2018I hope Qatar does a fine job and silences its critics\u2019\nI won\u2019t be doing anything differently this year and will watch any matches I can. I find all the boycotting talk a little late in the day. If fans were upset, they should have been making a fuss 12 years ago. Many people seem to be jumping on the boycott bandwagon \u2013 and most people in the UK are probably making judgements without knowing much about the country and its people.\nI was delighted when Qatar won the right to host the tournament. I lived in Qatar for 12 years and have great affection for the country. Why shouldn\u2019t a small country host the World Cup? Why should fans have to pay out thousands to travel all over a big country, or worse, move between two or even three countries? A compact city has some advantages. \u2028I understand the criticism of Qatar but it\u2019s not the only host country with less than perfect history. Qatar is a young country and not everything is perfect, but some of the criticism is unwarranted. I hope they do a fine job and silence their critics. Helen Bennett, a retired English teacher\n\n\u2018Quite frankly, I find the pile-on on Qatar quite appalling\u2019\nI am insanely and unreasonably excited to be attending the World Cup in Qatar. Quite frankly, I find the pile-on on Qatar quite appalling, especially the identity of the countries piling on. Qatar\u2019s human rights record is appalling but, as someone born in Nigeria, I have a different view of who the bad guys and good guys are in global affairs.\nWhile Qatar could do so many things better, I find the idea of boycotting Qatar, when I would have no qualms traveling to England or France, quite laughable. On the list of culprit countries in my mind \u2013 that is countries who have historically meted (and are currently meting) out unspeakable atrocities on my kind \u2013 Qatar does not register in the top 20.\nIt is a bit silly on the part of Qatar to host this World Cup. I cannot see how it is beneficial to them. Otherwise, I am insanely excited. I am old enough to remember how badly the international media denigrated South Africa as hosts in 2010. The racial dimensions to these discussions are quite apparent to me. That said, I hope that Qatar will seize this opportunity to reform and become a more open state. Emmanuel Oga, a Nigerian-born American\n\n\u2018Football relies on sponsors so I\u2019ve stopped using their products\u2019\nI always enjoy watching the best playing the best and am from Canada so, as this is only our second appearance at a World Cup, I should be even more interested. That said, what has been allowed to happen with these finals is a human and sporting disgrace. Even though Canada qualified, I almost wish they boycotted. The sport relies on its sponsors so I\u2019ve stopped using their products. I wish others would too. It\u2019s a disgrace and embarrassment to the game and goes to show that money trumps everything. It disgusts me. Nick Willcocks, a Canada fan in Turkey\n\u2018There will be no dancing in the street\u2019\nNormally, the World Cup is the highlight of the sports year for me. I remember watching England games in the pub at 8am when it was in Japan and South Korea. I watch every game and the excitement usually starts a year or more before the tournament.\nI\u2019d find it hard to boycott the entire tournament. A part of me feels it would be right to keep the TV off, but it\u2019s not the players\u2019 fault the tournament is being played in Qatar. As a dual US and British citizen, I don\u2019t think I could turn away from the USA v England game. I feel the same about the later rounds, especially the final. I will watch fewer games and do not intend to celebrate this tournament by going to the bars. If England or USA pull off some kind of miracle and win the tournament, I shall politely applaud the team. There will be no dancing in the street. Matthew Dunford, an Englishman in the US\n\n\u2018Sportswashing is killing our game\u2019\nI normally watch all the games and, even though I am a grown man, I usually fill out a World Cup wallchart. But I can\u2019t and won\u2019t watch this year. I\u2019ve banned myself from social media and comments about this tournament. I have stopped listening to the Guardian\u2019s football podcast. I understand you have to cover it, but that doesn\u2019t mean I have to be a part of your audience. It\u2019s scandalous that this tournament is going ahead. They could not have made it more plain that the principle of this World Cup is to maximise revenue. Sportswashing is killing our game. For example, I used to have a soft spot for Newcastle but can\u2019t watch them. I have a choice about the World Cup and have decided to sit this one out. I resent Fifa, the so-called \u201cguardians of the game\u201d, for denying me the passion of a tournament I\u2019ve been watching for 50 years. Andrew Paget, a West Ham fan living in the US\n\u2018I simply wouldn\u2019t enjoy watching it\u2019\nI\u2019m a football fan and an F1 fan \u2013 it\u2019s pretty hard to follow either without making some sort of moral adjustment to matches and races backed, sponsored or located in oil-rich regimes with questionable human rights records. But something about Qatar hits differently. So many journalists and papers have done an excellent job shedding light into the horrific human cost of building these stadiums \u2013 and so many human rights organisations have provided accounts of the physical and financial abuses of migrant labourers. And most importantly, the firsthand accounts of these workers are impossible to ignore.\nI don\u2019t think my boycott will make a difference. Enough people will watch that it will not be noticed. But I find my unease has grown so strong, my distaste so impossible to ignore, that I simply wouldn\u2019t enjoy it. Best of luck to the players and teams, who deserved better. I won\u2019t be watching. No World Cup could better reflect the corruption at the heart of international football than this one. It is both an absolute indictment, and perfect definition, of what Fifa is. Scott Connolly, Liverpool\n\u2018Russia was hardly a paradise of human rights\u2019\nBoycotting will have sod all effect on the Qatari regime. A boycott might have been effective before the hosting decision was made or around the time it was announced. It was a bizarre decision to stage it in Qatar and I\u2019m unhappy about the workers\u2019 rights and human rights violations. That said, it needs to be put into perspective. Four years ago the World Cup was staged in Russia, hardly a paradise of human rights. In 1978, which I am old enough to recall, the bloody thing was staged in Argentina, where the junta was well on its way to offing 30,000 of its own citizens. So Fifa has form on this. Plus \u00e7a change, plus c\u2019est la m\u00eame chose as Michel Platini might have said. Jonathan Smallbone, a trade union official\n\n\u2018I will do a partial boycott\u2019\nI am a lifelong football fan who always looks forward to the World Cup. I remember vividly watching the 1998 final as a seven-year-old with my father and grandfather. Football has been a huge part of my life ever since.\nI have decided I will do a partial boycott this year. I am too big of a fan to completely withdraw myself from the tournament, but I want to withhold my consumption and invite others to do so as well. My best friend is Spanish, and I have various friends and family throughout Latin America, so have decided to only watch games in which Brazil, Ecuador, Argentina and Spain play. That may not sound like a significant boycott but, as someone who breathes football, it will be quite a big challenge.\nI feel less excited. It\u2019s hard to support a sporting event that has directly caused so much death. As the son of a brown Peruvian immigrant, I feel responsible for doing my part to lift up migrant justice. Though, I\u2019m also aware that I haven\u2019t thought to boycott previous World Cups; there is potentially some pontificating and hypocrisy there. I don\u2019t judge people who are not boycotting. I do think it would be beautiful to put enough pressure on Fifa to move them to compensate the bereaved families. Alfonso Sasieta, a Peru fan in the US\nThanks to everyone who took part. We had hundreds of responses and would have published many more but simply ran out of space. Thank you."

                    "body": "This article is part of the Guardian\u2019s World Cup 2022 Experts\u2019 Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 32 countries who qualified. theguardian.com is running previews from two countries each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 20 November.\nThe plan\nGregg Berhalter has ditched the fading veterans who flopped during the last qualifying cycle, waded through a large pool of promising youngsters and installed a dynamic pressing style that retains the US\u2019s hallmark spirit and energy but is more sophisticated and possession-oriented than the direct approach of previous generations.\nTheory, meet reality: Berhalter conceded that players were lacking confidence and were \u201cbelow our normal levels\u201d in the final two World Cup warmups, a 2-0 defeat to Japan and a goalless draw with Saudi Arabia. At least the struggles were educational. \u201cThings became pretty clear,\u201d he said, without elaborating.\nThe zestless efforts weren\u2019t aberrations. The US generally struggle to score away from home and often look ordinary against opponents outside the mediocre Concacaf region. There\u2019s an abundance of wingers and the midfield is busy and bright, but the centre-back and centre-forward positions are problematic and frequent injuries have prevented Berhalter from playing his best XI.\n\nNor is it clear that the US are good enough on the ball to outplay the world\u2019s best teams, and there\u2019s little evidence they can adjust if exuberance does not carry the day. So wedded to youth and athleticism is Berhalter that there is a real lack of World Cup experience in the squad, although that is partly down to the fact the US missed out in 2018.\nWith so many untested players \u2013 not to mention the coach \u2013 it is hard to predict whether they will rise to the occasion, be cowed by it, or perform more or less in line with their talent level \u2013 which would mean that with a good start against Wales they could qualify from the group, probably in second place, then be outclassed by the first major nation they face in the knockout round.\n\nThe coach\nAfter a 14-month search for a successor to Bruce Arena, Gregg Berhalter was appointed in December 2018 after spells in charge of Swedish club Hammarby and MLS side Columbus Crew. This worried fans who wanted a head coach with a more distinguished pedigree and many are still to be convinced of his merits \u2013 but the thoughtful and thorough 49-year-old New Jersey native has won 36 and lost only 10 of his 56 games in charge. Berhalter\u2019s playing career as a defender included a season at Crystal Palace and 44 international caps. He made two appearances at the 2002 World Cup when the US reached the quarter-finals, and was an unused squad member in 2006.\nStar player\nChristian Pulisic will cut in from the left wing and much responsibility rests on the captain\u2019s shoulders, especially since the US don\u2019t have a top-quality central striker. At 24 the Chelsea forward is not the same fearless, rampaging kid who emerged during the failed 2018 qualifying campaign. For his country he now tends to drop into midfield in search of the ball. That\u2019s the weight of expectation (and injuries) for you. There\u2019s even a car advert in which he reclines on a therapist\u2019s couch and runs into a wardrobe to escape the media.\n\nUnsung hero\nIn 2021 Yunus Musah chose to represent the US rather than England, Italy or Ghana, and the calibre of his suitors is evidence of his ability. Blossoming at Valencia, he\u2019s an energetic midfield disruptor who is calm under pressure with the ball at his feet. If he can add goals and assists the 19-year-old is a potential superstar, though that may not be obvious if he plays in a deeper-lying role to liberate Weston McKennie and act as a bulwark against superior opponents.\nProbable lineup\n\nQatar stance\nUS Soccer has briefed the players on the issues arising from staging the tournament in Qatar. Given the squad\u2019s adoption of the slogan \u201cBe The Change\u201d after the killing of George Floyd and previous outspoken positions on stronger gun laws and social justice \u2013 each team member wore a jacket with a personal message before a game against Wales in 2020 \u2013 it would not be surprising if some players speak out and/or make symbolic gestures in support of LGBTQ+ and migrant workers\u2019 rights. US Soccer also plan to encourage the display of rainbow flags and has been checking that the businesses it is working with in Qatar during the tournament \u2013 such as the team hotel \u2013 respect workers\u2019 rights laws.\nNational anthem\nThere\u2019s a bit of previous here to add spice to the US-England group game. Sung to the tune of an 18th-century English drinking ditty, The Star-Spangled Banner became the national anthem in 1931. The words of this stirring ode to freedom were written by Francis Scott Key, a slaveholding 35-year-old lawyer, following an American victory over the invading Royal Navy in the Battle of Baltimore in 1814, soon after the British had torched the White House.\nAll-time cult hero\nA US national team stalwart, bearded musician and export to Europe turned TV pundit who\u2019s not Alexi Lalas? That would be Clint Dempsey, AKA Deuce, who released a rap song, Don\u2019t Tread, ahead of the 2006 World Cup. Was it a banger? Sort of. \u201cBest to give way for the USA / Now we\u2019re hot / You might think we\u2019re a sun ray.\u201d The artful Texan forward and inducer of Robert Green\u2019s nightmares scored in three World Cups, thrived in England with Fulham and Tottenham then signed for Seattle in 2013, declaring: \u201cI just want to score goals and go fishing.\u201d He retired in 2018 with a joint-USMNT record 57 goals from 141 caps and, like Lalas, will work for American TV at Qatar 2022.\nTom Dart is a freelancer who writes for the Guardian US among others.

                    "body": "Towards the end of Gareth Southgate\u2019s post-match press conference, deep in the harshly lit fibreglass bunker that is the Al Bayt Stadium media suite, England\u2019s manager was asked by an Argentinian journalist for his thoughts on the prospect down the track of having to face Lionel Messi. \u201cWell,\u201d Southgate frowned, making a show of giving the question all due consideration. \u201cHe\u2019s a good player.\u201d As super-dry wee\u2011hours press room one\u2011liners go, it was pretty good.\nAfter that Southgate just kind of shrugged and said something like, yeah, he\u2019s a genius but we\u2019ll worry about that if it happens. England have to play France first in the quarter-final on Saturday. Their only chance of facing Messi at Qatar 2022 would be to reach the final, less than two weeks and three possible games from now.\nProgress has been tidy so far against opponents that have ranged from not very good, to quite good, to really not very good at all, to Senegal\u2019s decent-ish. But the weather is now shifting. France await. And things are about to get real.\n\nBefore then Southgate has a moment to feel some due satisfaction at England reaching their par level at this World Cup. However this ends now there will be no disaster, no humiliation, no shrieking and wailing from the chorus at England\u2019s back (NB there will of course be shrieking and wailing, because there must be, but only from the most entrenched, the fringe elements, broadsheet football writers and other extremist elements).\nThe reality is England have now hit their level. If it is acceptable to compare this World Cup to the Premier League \u2013 and we may as well, because that seemed to be happening until a few moments ago \u2013 then England are the Tottenham Hotspur of Qatar 2022 (fourth place last year, Kane+, not won anything for decades).\n\nBeating a depleted Senegal was like Spurs beating Wolves. Good but you kind of expected it. The USA were Brighton, spiky, difficult, an acceptable 0-0. Wales were Southampton. Iran were Norwich.\nEngland/Spurs have done a good but unremarkable job of getting past these teams. But now Super Saturday is starting to loom. Spurs will now play Liverpool, supercharged but mildly flawed opponents; a game they aren\u2019t expected to win, but which will still carry a skein of hope. \nThis is a good spot to be in; but also a tactically troubling prospect given the evidence of England\u2019s and France\u2019s four games apiece so far.\nSouthgate was also asked the more relevant question of how England are going to cope with Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 operating in a perfect moment of Mbapp\u00e9\u2011ness, an issue he dodged by talking instead about how good Antoine Griezmann is. But something will surely have to change before Saturday\u2019s game back at Al Bayt if England hope to move beyond steady and commendable progress.\nFirst, the good news. England came into this World Cup finals tournament in bit of mess, besieged by goldfish\u2011memory critics, and facing a group where, somehow \u2013 it remains a mystery \u2013 every opponent was ranked in the world\u2019s top 20.\n\nChuck in Sunday night\u2019s date with the (depleted) African champions and England have played four, won three, scored 12 and conceded only twice, in the messy endgame with Iran. The midfield looks fluid and has begun to score goals. The starting front six against Senegal featured four players aged 23 and under.\nLooking back further England have clean sheets in nine of their past 11 tournament games, with eight wins and three draws. Harry Kane has also scored, which will ease his hidden but tangible frustrations, those moments in the second half where Kane comes to resemble some sad, noble, cat-rescuing 1950s milkman, unthanked but doggedly dutiful. He will be settled now. And he likes these games.\nOn the other hand there are also some obvious flaws, weaknesses that all four opponents to date have picked at, and which France may just rip open.\nSenegal looked as if they were targeting Harry Maguire in the early moments, isolating him, pressing high, finding moments where the speed of their front three could prey on his glacial turning circle.\nThere were also three occasions where Maguire chugged forward with the ball, a kind of steamship Beckenbauer, then gave it away. At least one should have ended in a goal for Senegal. Southgate has talked up Maguire\u2019s ability to carry the ball forward. Perhaps Maguire now feels this is part of his locus standi for keeping a spot in the team.\nAgainst the USA he kept launching showy artillery passes, and at one point veered out to the left wing like a broken dodgem. This feels like a player trying to fit an abstract idea of himself, one fraught with danger. Here is England\u2019s least mobile player effectively choosing to move himself miles out of position. Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and Mbapp\u00e9 will feast on those spaces if Maguire tries this, offering up their own bespoke VIP lane to England\u2019s goal.\n\nThe other problem in defence may heal itself with a few more days. Kyle Walker did not look fit against Senegal. There is an idea out there that England have a player capable of matching Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s foot speed on the same flank. Not on this evidence.\nIt seems likely the moments of vulnerability in all four games to date will encourage Southgate to switch to his comfort-blanket back three. This will probably become the battlefield of the upcoming days, and the stick with which to beat England if they lose, as they probably should four times out of five, whatever the formation.\nThe back three is still an understandable choice given the defenders Southgate has. Maguire needs cover. Walker as the right-sided centre-back and Kieran Trippier outside him is a way of not losing the game in the opening half-hour.\nOn the other hand even those who value the results of Southgate\u2019s caution may feel tempted now by the success of the current midfield three, with its fine balance of strengths. It would be fascinating to see Rice-Bellingham-Henderson/Phillips tested against the world champions, if a little hair-raising if Maguire starts in a four, and seriously undermined if he drops deep in fear of France\u2019s pace, as has happened at Manchester United.\nSouthgate will run these permutations, will make the call based on seeing his players up close, and on proper study of England\u2019s opponents. It is probably time simply to trust him.\nAnd here is another thing: England have only once in their entire World Cup history won a knockout game against a team that had previously won the tournament. That was the 1966 final. England tend to win the games they should win, then lose to better teams: Portugal, Germany, West Germany, Brazil, Uruguay (as world champions). It is a surprisingly prosaic reality for a nation that considers itself, against the facts, to be a poetically stricken underachiever.\nWith any real perspective France should basically be a free hit from this point. But then, in many ways it doesn\u2019t really matter what England do now, or how they do it. We are witnessing a kind of endgame, six years into this thing, the dots being joined, the pieces aligned. We have watched this process in action, have taken our positions. Whatever your view on Southgate (despoiler of talent, or pleasant and successful manager) it is unlikely to change. Time, now, just to watch it play out."

The move has cemented Moulding\u2019s control of THG, formerly known as The Hut Group, which owns a range of internet health and beauty retailers, and ended speculation about SoftBank\u2019s disastrous investment. The Japanese firm, run by its founder, Masayoshi Son, is offloading its stake \u2013 once worth \u00a3500m \u2013 for \u00a331m, making a loss of \u00a3450m on its investment. It bought an 8% stake in THG for \u00a3481m in May 2021 to help fund expansion of its technology platform a few months before it floated in London.  THG shares rose 10% in early trading and later traded 9% higher at 49.9p. However, shares have plummeted 86% over the past year, as the business struggled with slowing sales. THG owns the retail websites Lookfantastic, Glossybox, Zavvi and Coggles, as well as beauty brands including ESPA and Illamasqua, and the sports nutrition brand Myprotein. It was founded in 2004 by Moulding and John Gallemore, who started out selling CDs and DVDs online for other retailers. SoftBank\u2019s disposal comes as it decided to liquidate its internal hedge fund SB Northstar, which has racked up losses of about $6bn (\u00a35bn). THG said SB Northstar had agreed to sell 80.6m THG shares, its entire shareholding, to Qatar Investment Authority and Moulding, THG\u2019s chief executive. The shares will be sold at 39p each on Thursday, below Monday\u2019s closing price of 45p. QIA, which is already a shareholder, will buy 84% of the shares. SoftBank terminated an agreement in July that would have allowed it to acquire a fifth of THG\u2019s Ingenuity technology division. In a stock market update, Moulding said: \u201cWe at THG extend our thanks to SoftBank for their support as a financial and commercial partner, and we will continue to benefit from the relationships formed across their international technology portfolio. \u201cI\u2019m delighted to be further increasing my family\u2019s stake in THG, continuing our unswerving support following on from other recent share purchases.\u201d"

                    "body": "Amnesty International\u2019s secretary general has made an urgent plea to Fifa before the World Cup, calling on it to commit to a compensation package for migrant workers who suffered abuses in Qatar.\nAgn\u00e8s Callamard urged the world football governing body to issue a \u201ccast-iron commitment\u201d that \u201cabused workers will be compensated and that programmes to prevent further abuses are funded\u201d, adding that such a package would go \u201ca long way towards helping victims and their families rebuild their lives\u201d.\nShe also fiercely criticised Fifa president Gianni Infantino\u2019s request to World Cup teams that they should \u201cfocus on the football\u201d rather than discussing human rights issues in Qatar. \u201cInfantino\u2019s letter is a crass attempt at shirking Fifa\u2019s culpability,\u201d Callamard said.\n\nIn the letter, sent last month, Infantino had suggested critics were \u201chanding out moral lessons to the rest of the world\u201d and said nations should \u201cnot allow football to be dragged into every ideological or political battle that exists\u201d.\nRather than calming criticism of Qatar, the letter angered human rights groups and football leaders, with countries including England and Wales saying they would continue campaigning on off-pitch issues. \u201cHuman rights are universal and they apply everywhere,\u201d they said in a joint statement with eight other European football associations.\n\nThe hosting of the World Cup by Qatar has attracted protest worldwide over LGBTQ+ rights and labour issues. Ten captains of European teams have said they will wear \u201cOne love\u201d armbands to promote diversity and inclusion during the tournament. While, last month, Australia released a video in which players criticised Qatar\u2019s human rights record.\nLast week, the Danish football association said Fifa had rejected a request to allow its players to train at the World Cup in shirts with the words \u201chuman rights for all\u201d on them \u201cdue to technical reasons\u201d.\nAlso last week, England\u2019s largest LGBTQ+ supporters\u2019 group criticised David Beckham for his role as a paid ambassador for the Qatar World Cup, saying it was \u201cincredibly disappointing\u201d that he had taken the role given that Qatari law criminalises homosexual behaviour.\n\u201cI\u2019m just so disappointed because we \u2013 the LGBTQ+ football family \u2013 have put David Beckham on a pedestal, as a great ally,\u201d said Di Cunningham, the co-founder of the Three Lions Pride group.\nThe comments from Callamard come six months after Amnesty and 24 other rights groups wrote to Infantino urging Fifa to establish a remediation programme for the abuses suffered by workers in Qatar.\nThe rights groups say hundreds of thousands of migrant workers, predominantly from south and south-east Asia and Africa, have been subjected to \u201crampant labour abuses\u201d including \u201cextortionate recruitment fees, conditions amounting to forced labour, lost and unpaid wages, and long hours without days off\u201d.\nIt also highlighted the cases of workers harmed in Qatar, including a Nepali citizen, Tul Bahadur Gharti, who is reported to have died in his sleep in November 2020 after working more than 10 hours in extreme heat on a construction site.\nA death certificate issued by the Qatari authorities said that Gharti, 34, died of \u201cnatural causes\u201d.The call for compensation has been backed by the football associations of England, Germany, France, the Netherlands and the US, and by World Cup sponsors, including Coca-Cola, Adidas, Budweiser and McDonald\u2019s. However, Qatar has disputed reports about the scale of the labour abuses and rejected calls for a Fifa-led compensation fund, describing them as a \u201cpublicity stunt\u201d.\nIn an op-ed for international media on Friday, Callamard wrote: \u201cAmid this growing clamour, the most crucial voice of all has remained conspicuously silent: Gianni Infantino.\n\u201cDespite private and public assurances from Fifa that they are \u2018considering the proposal\u2019, Infantino, a few platitudes aside, has consistently dodged the topic. To date, he has provided no response to our joint letter.\u201d\nShe added that \u201cgiven the well-documented history of labour-rights abuse in Qatar\u201d, Fifa \u201cknew \u2013 or should have known \u2013 the obvious risks to workers when it awarded Qatar the tournament.\n\u201cA pledge from Infantino to provide compensation would provide a tangible demonstration that Fifa is truly serious about its commitment to respect human rights,\u201d she said.\nIn a statement to AFP last month, Qatar\u2019s labour minister, Ali bin Samikh Al-Marri, said the Gulf state was already handing out hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid wages, and described critics as \u201cracist\u201d. He added that the ministry\u2019s \u201cdoor is open\u201d, saying that \u201cif there is a person entitled to compensation who has not received it, they should come forward and we will help them\u201d.\nIn response to the statement, Amnesty International, which is part of a campaign called #PayUpFIFA, said that while money paid out already was \u201cundoubtedly important\u201d, Qatar must expand its existing compensation funds or establish a new one.\nIt is calling for Fifa to pay $440m towards reparations \u2013 matching the prize money it will pay during the World Cup.\nOn Saturday, Fifa said it \u201cremained in positive continuing dialogue\u201d with labour organisations and the Qatari authorities over \u201cinitiatives that will benefit migrant workers in Qatar long after the final game of the World Cup\u201d.It said there had been a \u201cgreat response\u201d to Infantino\u2019s letter calling for teams to \u201cfocus on the football\u201d, with various teams backing it."

                    "body": "At this rate Gareth Southgate is going to have to bow to public pressure and stuff his team with attackers when England face Iran in their opening game at the World Cup next month. The defensive concerns are mounting for England\u2019s manager. If the possibility of John Stones returning from the hamstring injury that forced him off against Germany last month is a positive, then it is counteracted by Harry Maguire\u2019s exile from Manchester United\u2019s starting XI and Kyle Walker undergoing groin surgery last week. Even someone with Walker\u2019s recovery speed will find it hard to win the race to be fit for Qatar and, given there is no guarantee Stones will not break down again, it means there are doubts over every member of Southgate\u2019s ideal back three.  No pressure, then, Eric Dier. The Tottenham centre-back has enjoyed an impressive return to form under Antonio Conte and looks certain to start in the middle of the back three against Iran. The problems, though, have continued to pile up for Southgate this week. First came Gabriel Martinelli tormenting Trent Alexander-Arnold before the Liverpool right-back departed with an ankle injury during his team\u2019s defeat by Arsenal last Sunday; then, at San Siro on Tuesday, there was the sight of Reece James going off with a knee injury during Chelsea\u2019s 2-0 win against Milan, whose hopes of regaining control of their Champions League group were squashed by Fikayo Tomori being sent off in the 18th minute. While Graham Potter sounded optimistic about James \u2013 it is understood the right wing-back, who is making himself undroppable for club and country, will not be out for long \u2013 the mood around Tomori was gloomier. The defender\u2019s evening was not supposed to end in such rancour and disappointment. Tomori had a point to prove against his old team, especially after failing to impress when Milan lost 3-0 at Stamford Bridge last week, and the general view was that he was unfortunate to be dismissed for a soft foul on Mason Mount after James sent the midfielder through on goal. Did the punishment fit the crime? Daniel Siebert was right to award a penalty, but did he have to give a red? The contact was minimal and many people felt Tomori deserved a caution. Equally, Tomori made no genuine attempt to play the ball and it was possible to understand why the referee felt the 24-year-old had denied Mount an obvious goalscoring opportunity.  Using that cold logic, it becomes harder to see Southgate trusting Tomori. He is likely to look past the debate over the red and focus on the defensive frailties. He will analyse how Mount got the wrong side of Tomori, who made matters worse by panicking as he tried to stop his fellow Chelsea academy graduate from shooting. Southgate will surely conclude Tomori is not ready for a place in England\u2019s starting XI. Southgate has never been convinced about Tomori. He did not bow to the clamour to pick him instead of Maguire as the left-sided centre-back during England\u2019s Nations League matches against Italy and Germany. Tomori was not given a minute, even though Maguire\u2019s struggles continued against Germany, and his difficulties against Chelsea will even leave him at risk of not making the squad. While that may sound drastic, there was an acceptance Tomori needed to shine during Milan\u2019s double-header against Chelsea. Impressing in Serie A is one thing, but Chelsea are a step up on anything Tomori faces in Italy. It is not insular for Southgate to place more importance on performances from defenders playing in the Premier League. The quality of the opposition is higher and the pace quicker. Tomori, who has admitted his form has not been up to scratch this season, could not contain Chelsea. He was poor at Stamford Bridge, wilting under an early aerial barrage. He lacked composure and was at fault for Chelsea\u2019s second goal, his failure to cut out a cross from James allowing the unmarked Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to make it 2-0 from close range. More was expected from a player who helped Milan to win the Scudetto last season. Back on home turf, though, Tomori could not even rely on his pace to get him out of trouble when he allowed Mount to get goalside. The red card was instant and if Tomori does miss out on the World Cup that may well be the moment when Southgate crossed his name off the list. At the same time Southgate is not blessed with many reliable alternatives to his first-choice defenders. Crystal Palace\u2019s Marc Gu\u00e9hi is inexperienced and Ben White, who has been impressing at right-back for Arsenal, missed out on the last camp. Given Southgate likes to pick those he trusts, do not rule out a recall for Aston Villa\u2019s Tyrone Mings, Maguire\u2019s deputy at Euro 2020. Compromises could be required. There is time for injuries to heal before the 26-man squad is named, but the situation at the back is not ideal. So much of England\u2019s approach is about defensive stability. For Southgate, who has repeatedly stressed the importance of balance at international level, uncertainty is something to avoid."

                    "body": "As the Covid-19 pandemic ripped through London in spring 2020, the revolving doors at Claridge\u2019s stopped turning and its art deco lobby fell silent. The 220-year-old luxury Mayfair hotel, whose guests have ranged from Mick Jagger to Winston Churchill \u2013 and which was a favourite lunch spot of Queen Elizabeth II \u2013 fell foul of government guidelines that ordered venues to shut as part of efforts to halt the spread of the virus. Like most hotel businesses, Claridge\u2019s \u2013 and the Maybourne Hotel Group that owns it \u2013 claimed furlough cash to fund wages for its waiters, porters and managers as the pandemic choked off business. All told, Maybourne entities, including its Connaught, Berkeley and the not-yet-opened Emory hotel, claimed up to \u00a312m, according to records obtained by the Guardian. Meanwhile, work continued on the \u00a3800m renovation of the quartet, including a luxury subterranean spa at Claridge\u2019s, to enhance the value of the jewel in the crown of its royal proprietors. Maybourne is part of the growing empire of prestige assets belonging to the phenomenally wealthy ruling elite of Qatar, the gas-rich emirate due to host the upcoming football World Cup. Its ultimate beneficial owners are the former emir of Qatar Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, sometimes known as HBK, and the businessman and former prime minister Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber al-Thani (HBJ), who together have masterminded Qatar\u2019s investment in the UK, including deals to buy Harrods and the financing of the Shard. HBJ made headlines recently when the Sunday Times revealed that he had given \u20ac3m (\u00a32.6m), including cash stuffed into a Fortnum &amp; Mason bag, to King Charles \u2013 then the Prince of Wales \u2013 for his charity. The cash was handed over in three lots between 2011 and 2015. But that windfall, not to mention the money that the Al-Thanis saved by accepting the taxpayer\u2019s furlough largesse, is small beer compared with another prize now at stake.  The Qatari aristocracy are embroiled in a multibillion-pound legal fight over the no-expense-spared overhaul of Claridge\u2019s. Now that fight is about to escalate, with the embattled Swiss bank Credit Suisse set to become the latest entity dragged into a bitter dispute between former friends. The tussle revolves around the true value of Maybourne\u2019s portfolio of luxury hotels and the impact that this price tag has on an agreement between the Qataris and Paddy McKillen, a Belfast-born hotelier who has overseen the renovation. The result of McKillen\u2019s work has wowed critics. The penthouse suite, featuring a Steinway piano, is expected to carry a per-night price tag of \u00a3100,000 when it opens later this year. Claridge\u2019s did not have a spa before but McKillen\u2019s builders have put one in, digging out a five-floor excavation below the famous black and white lobby, at times with their hands, to avoid any uncouth rumblings disturbing the guests who have returned post-pandemic. In the Japan-inspired treatment rooms, guests are treated to floral kimonos instead of the usual robe and slippers. They can choose from a vast menu of treatments, or relax in a private cabana amid the stone pillars surrounding the swimming pool. As peaceful as the result of the makeover may be, the war over the value created by it is likely to be long, expensive and bitter, with one insider noting: \u201cNobody is going to win except the lawyers.\u201d A second source close to the dispute said that the Qataris appeared to be ready to spend \u201ctens of millions\u201d on legal fees, arraying their almost unrivalled financial power against McKillen\u2019s stomach for the fight. That battle pits McKillen against his erstwhile friend and saviour, HBJ. The Belfast boy had acquired a stake of just over a third in the hotels in 2004, as part of a consortium led by the Irish real estate investor Derek Quinlan. When the financial crash capsized Quinlan\u2019s property empire, the billionaire Barclay brothers swooped in and tried to wrest control of the hugely prestigious assets. McKillen did not want to relinquish control without a fight but ultimately he had a choice: either rack up huge and risky levels of debt to buy out the Barclays or enlist a wealthy backer. In stepped HBJ, whose financial firepower dwarfed even that of the Barclays. He bought out the brothers\u2019 64% stake and threw his weight behind McKillen, who possessed not just the other 36% but a wealth of valuable expertise in how to run luxury hotels. What happened next has become the crux of a prolonged and costly legal dispute. Under an agreement between the business partners, HBJ and HBK would increase their stake to 100%, clearing McKillen\u2019s debts in the process and giving his business, Hume Street Management Consultants, a lucrative seven-year contract to spruce up the hotels to match the world-beating standards of luxury living that the Qataris expected. McKillen would get 36% of the resulting increase in the hotels\u2019 value above the \u00a31.3bn price tag that had been set by the Qataris\u2019 initial investment, with deductions for the costs the Gulf owners incurred paying for the work. The deal seemed to work for everyone. However, in April this year, it became clear that there was trouble in paradise. McKillen and his longtime associate Liam Cunningham were unceremoniously jettisoned from the board of Maybourne Hotels, amid a dispute over his share of the hotels\u2019 increased value. It is thought that McKillen is claiming that the portfolio is worth upwards of \u00a35bn, a near fourfold increase since 2015 that could see him pocket seven figures. The Qataris beg to differ, to the point that it is unclear whether McKillen will receive anything at all. Another point of difference rests on whether hotels in Beverly Hills and the French riviera, which the Qataris argue were added to the portfolio after their deal with McKillen, should be included. Factoring them in would increase McKillen\u2019s payout. Both sides say that the contract between McKillen and the Qataris is unambiguous and favours their own interpretation of events. Given how far apart the two sides are in their valuations \u2013 by a factor of 500% according to one source \u2013 a settlement appears unlikely. One way to arrive at a valuation is to ask an independent bank to estimate the price tag. To that end, HBJ and HBK are understood to have asked Credit Suisse to do the job. But an arbitration process, expected to start within days, is expected to consider whether the Swiss bank can really be considered independent. Qatar Holding, the investment vehicle of the Gulf state, owns 5% of Credit Suisse. HBJ\u2019s son Jassim bin Hamad is a former director of the bank, although he stood down in 2017. Credit Suisse declined to comment. While the legal process plays out, HBJ can take comfort in having full control over London\u2019s most famous hotels, with the possible exception of the Ritz and the Savoy, which both happen to be wholly or partly owned by Qatar or its ruling elite.  Shortly before McKillen was ousted, HBJ installed several new members on the board. They include his son Mohammed bin Hamad bin Jassim and his right-hand man, the Italian banker Michele Faissola, who was recently cleared on appeal, having been given a jail sentence as part of a probe into the falsification of accounts at the Italian bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena in 2019. Faissola, head of HBJ\u2019s family office Dilmon, is said to be a key figure at 67 Brook Street, a former home of the Bee Gees that has become the London nerve centre for HBJ\u2019s many business interests in Britain \u2013 and a stone\u2019s throw from Claridge\u2019s. Many of the guests enjoying Claridge\u2019s genteel and peaceful surroundings will be blissfully unaware that their bed for the night is the subject of such an unseemly and acrimonious brawl. As for the 210-year-old hotel and its staff, they have surely seen it all. McKillen declined to comment. Maybourne Hotels and its owners did not return a request for comment."

It was ever thus, the upside is a festival of popular internationalism\u2019 \u2018How do you solve a problem like Qatar?\u201d Even Julie Andrews belting it out is perhaps not a terrace anthem yet but certainly what fans, and non-fans, have been pondering the last few years \u2013 a debate due to reach fever pitch (sic) as the tournament opens next Sunday. Treating Qatar as simply the latest World Cup to be used as a political platform, and to observe there is nothing remotely unusual about this, would be a start. At the 1934 World Cup, in Italy, Mussolini\u2019s blackshirts explicitly used the Italian national team to build support for fascism, winning their home tournament, and winning again in France four years later, the first team to win an away World Cup. Harold Wilson declared after England\u2019s 1966 win: \u201cHave you noticed we only win the World Cup under a Labour government?\u201d That was one old Labour pledge that has stood the test of time, more\u2019s the pity. In 1973, the Soviet team were expelled from the tournament for refusing to take part in a qualifying play-off against Chile following Pinochet\u2019s coup. Chile, on the other hand, were welcomed to take the last place as a result. Or the last tournament, Putin\u2019s World Cup, just four years after his annexation \u2013 aka invasion \u2013 of Crimea, while this time all Russian participation has been banned. Qatar using and abusing the World Cup \u2013 it was ever thus. This is the downside of football as the one truly global sport. Yes, rugby (both versions) and cricket (all versions) have their world cups but they\u2019re not truly global, are they? These are sports fundamentally framed by empire, with the odd other international hangers-on who can score upsets but never get remotely close to the latter stages of the tournament. The winners of football\u2019s World Cup are a likewise select few from Europe and South America, but the teams that make it to the semi- and quarter-finals come from every continent, every corner of the world. This is the upside, a World Cup as a festival of popular internationalism. I\u2019m lucky enough to have gone as an England fan to four World Cups, including Asia\u2019s first, Japan and South Korea 2002, and Africa\u2019s first, South Africa 2010. Never mind \u2013 well, actually I do mind, a lot \u2013 that England didn\u2019t come close to lifting the trophy, the experience was unforgettable. Yes, it\u2019s a holiday of privilege but being there is also inextricably mixed with, despite the unfamiliarity and the differences, what we share as visitors with our hosts, the love of football. That\u2019s what Qatar should be about: the first Middle Eastern World Cup, good; the first in a majority Muslim country, good. But of course, we all know it won\u2019t be about that \u2013 and that is a huge loss, barely recognised. To boycott or not to boycott? Let\u2019s be brutally honest: it\u2019s a non-question. England exit in ignominy at the group stage and the boycott will be unstoppable. Wales march on triumphantly to the knock-out stages and there\u2019s a tidal wave of Welsh solidarity with their team. Because when it comes down to it, for the next four weeks any moral gymnastics can be reduced to four words. Love football, not Fifa. \u2022 Mark Perryman is the author of books including Ingerland: Travels With a Football Nation No. \u2018To watch it would make me complicit. A passive approver of homophobia\u2019 I support football. I\u2019ve loved it since I was a child, when I\u2019d sit in front of Match of the Day every Saturday night with my grandad. I\u2019m a lifelong Liverpool fan and spend my weekends (and many week nights) shouting and arguing with a television set. When the World Cup rolls around there are dizzy levels of anticipation and by this stage I\u2019m usually poised and ready, the rest of my life cleverly rearranged around a very crowded fixtures list. This time, however, I\u2019ve decided not to watch. I never imagined I\u2019d say this, yet with Fifa choosing to hold the tournament in Qatar (a decision Beth Mead, Arsenal and England forward, describes with heavy understatement as \u201cdisappointing\u201d), I\u2019m left with no other option. In Qatar, homosexuality is illegal and was recently described by Qatar World Cup ambassador Khalid Salman as \u201cdamage in the mind\u201d. More than that, under strict Sharia law, anyone \u201cengaging in homosexuality\u201d faces being fined, imprisoned or even executed. Qatar\u2019s human rights record is abysmal. Women\u2019s rights, freedom of expression and assembly are all suppressed under Qatari regulations, while Amnesty International continues to push for its fair treatment of migrant workers (the Guardian reported that 6,500 migrant workers have died since Qatar won the right to host in 2010 \u2013, a figure officials bizarrely describe as \u201cmisleading\u201d). The competition\u2019s organisers state that everyone is welcome to attend the matches, but with its chief executive, Nasser al-Khater, adding that any visitors must \u201crespect our culture\u201d. I respect and admire many things about Islamic culture. But not this. To watch would make me complicit. A passive approver of homophobia and misogyny. How can I watch a tournament held in a country where some of my friends could face the death penalty, purely for quietly and peacefully living their lives. I support football, but more importantly, I support the idea of an existence free from fear, violence and discrimination. Many, including Piers Morgan, suggest we should \u201cjust enjoy the football\u201d and sport shouldn\u2019t be political. But everything is political (the fact that Qatar, the \u201crichest country in the world\u201d, was successful in its bid to host is a huge political statement in itself). Others have implied engagement \u201chighlights the issues\u201d, a fumbling defence used by World Cup commentator Gary Neville when recently challenged so exquisitely by Ian Hislop on Have I Got News For You. No, Gary. You can highlight the issue without sitting in a commentary box with a big fat pay cheque in your back pocket. Most people believe whether they watch or not will make zero difference, but if you think you are too small to count, \u201ctry sleeping with a mosquito\u201d, as the Dalai Lama says. Besides, I strongly believe it\u2019s the small decisions we make, whether we look or turn away, whether we speak out or stay silent, these are the decisions that make us who we are. Especially when no one ever sees those decisions except ourselves. So the next few weeks, at least for me, will be football-free. Will anyone care what I do? I doubt it. But if we all made that small change, if we all decided not to watch, what a very big difference that would be. \u2022 Joanna Cannon\u2019s latest novel is A Tidy Ending Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

                    "body": "US soccer journalist Grant Wahl says he was detained by security staff after he wore a rainbow shirt to USA\u2019s World Cup opener against Wales. Wahl, who works for CBS Sports and writes a popular Substack column, wore the shirt as a show of solidarity with the LGBTQ+ community to the game at Qatar\u2019s Ahmad bin Ali Stadium. Homosexuality is illegal in Qatar.   However, he said a security guard told him the shirt was not allowed. Wahl said his phone was \u201cforcibly ripped\u201d from his hands by a guard as he tweeted about the incident. He said he was then detained for 25 minutes and told to remove his shirt, which a member of security staff said was \u201cpolitical\u201d. He was also asked if he was from the UK.  Wahl says he told a New York Times journalist who was passing by what had happened and he was detained too before being let go shortly afterwards. \u201cThen a security commander approached me,\u201d Wahl wrote in his Substack column. \u201cHe said they were letting me through and apologized. We shook hands. One of the security guards told me they were just trying to protect me from fans inside who could harm me for wearing the shirt \u2026 A Fifa rep later apologized to me as well. \u201cBut the entire episode left me wondering: What\u2019s it like for ordinary Qataris who might wear a rainbow shirt when the world isn\u2019t watching here? What\u2019s that like?\u201d Wahl said he was subsequently allowed to wear the shirt in the stadium.  A Wales LGBTQ+ supporters group said some of its members were forbidden from wearing rainbow hats at the same game.   Fifa has said everyone is welcome at this year\u2019s World Cup but LGBTQ+ rights activists and campaigners had earlier on Monday criticized soccer\u2019s world governing body after it threatened to impose sanctions on players who wear OneLove armbands at the tournament.  England, Wales and five other European nations have confirmed their players will not wear the armband, saying Fifa had made it clear their captains could be booked or forced to leave the pitch if they did so. Stonewall, the LGBTQ+ charity, said on Twitter: \u201cBy threatening sporting sanctions &amp; stopping players from wearing #OneLove armbands, Fifa are brushing criticism of human rights abuses under the carpet. \u201cLGBTQ+ people are criminalised in Qatar just for being themselves. No country which abuses the human rights of its people in this way should have been awarded with the honour of hosting a major sporting tournament in the first place. \u201cWe appreciate all the @England and @Cymru players\u2019 efforts to draw attention to the appalling human rights abuses of LGBTQ+ people in Qatar, and we urge them to continue to speak out in Qatar as best and safely as they can.\u201d"

                    "body": "Graham Arnold will sit down with Football Australia chiefs in early January to thrash out a new deal that is expected to see him remain in charge of the Socceroos, with the coach\u2019s bargaining power having received a fillip after he was named the best coach of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Highly regarded sports newspaper L\u2019Equipe put the out-of-contract Australian in top spot on its rankings, above the likes of Lionel Scaloni of Argentina and France\u2019s Didier Deschamps. Arnold\u2019s future is yet to be clarified after his deal expired following the Socceroos\u2019 barnstorming run to the last 16 of the tournament in Qatar, although he is expected to be offered a new contract once he returns from holiday in Europe in the new year.  In the meantime, he can bask in the glow of edging out Japan\u2019s Hajime Moriyasu at the summit of the French publication\u2019s rankings, which are based on individual match ratings throughout the tournament. Arnold averaged a score of 6.75 out of 10 after masterminding wins over Tunisia and Denmark as the Socceroos navigated out of Group D and into the last 16 for the second time in their history and for the first time since 2006. Defeats came against eventual winners Argentina in the knockout phase and runners-up France in their opening match of the tournament. The run earned an official 11th-place finish for the Socceroos and is expected to help Arnold\u2019s side rise to 27th in the world when the latest Fifa rankings are released on Thursday \u2013 their highest since reaching 25th in 2012 under Holger Osieck. The coach ratings, which are compiled by L\u2019Equipe journalists after each match, are based on a number of metrics, including tactical nous and how their teams played. Scaloni, having guided Argentina to the South Americans\u2019 third world title, ranked joint third alongside Walid Regragui, who took Morocco all the way to the semi-finals \u2013 the first time in history an African team had gone so far. France boss Deschamps came in fifth, with England\u2019s Gareth Southgate ranked sixth. L\u2019Equipe\u2019s player ratings are notoriously miserly, with just 14 perfect 10s having been awarded in their history. The first were given to Franck Sauz\u00e9e and Bruno Martini after a France U21s game in 1988 and the most recent to Erling Haaland for this season\u2019s Manchester derby hat-trick performance. Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, Lionel Messi (twice), Robert Lewandowski and Neymar also appear on the elite list. Aziz Behich was Australia\u2019s top performer in Qatar, according to L\u2019Equipe, with an average rating of 5.75 (by comparison, the Guardian gave Behich an average of 6.25) and golden boot winner Mbapp\u00e9 topped the list with a score of 7.17. Arnold headed to the UK straight from Qatar and is taking a break before returning to Australia in the new year for contract discussions. The Football Australia CEO, James Johnson, said on Wednesday he was in regular contact with the coach but no \u201chard conversations\u201d were being had at the moment. \u201cWe are midway through the post-World Cup campaign review,\u201d Johnson told Fox Sports. \u201cWe have signalled to Graham that we\u2019d like to have a conversation with him about the next four years. And he\u2019s signalled to us that he\u2019s open to having that conversation. \u201cHe\u2019s back from his holidays in early January and so too am I, and we\u2019ll sit down and have that conversation at that point in time.\u201d"

                    "body": "Long before the end of a painful and humbling opening night for Qatar at this World Cup, many of the country\u2019s richest and most powerful men were speeding away from the Al Bayt stadium in their fast cars and 4x4s. They had, however, learned a valuable lesson. Money can buy you a lot of things in sport. Major events. Lavish stadiums. Impressive infrastructure. But it cannot guarantee a competitive national football team.\nThat harsh reality was dispensed in clinical style by an unheralded Ecuador side, who breezed to a 2-0 lead \u2013 thanks, in part to Qatar\u2019s erratic goalkeeper, Saad al-Sheeb \u2013 before taking their foot off the pedal. Not that many home fans were there to see it. Despite so much hype and expectation, along with a 12-year wait to watch their team in a home World Cup, thousands left at half-time.\nWe have regularly been told how deeply this World Cup matters to Qataris. Yet when it came to the crunch they could not disappear quick enough. Then again, having spent a reported $200bn to get their country ready for this event, more than every combined World Cup and Olympics in history, maybe they expected more from their team. Most of us did, in truth. Maybe the nerves and pressure were just too much.\n\nEarlier the omens had appeared promising. There was a lavish opening ceremony with sword-spinning dancers, camels and the South Korean K-pop star Jungkook, who sang the official anthem Dreamers. He was not the only one. The show was narrated by the actor Morgan Freeman, who promised: \u201cOn this journey, east and west will come together with one goal.\u201d The message was clear: Qatar and football could act as an emollient for a troubled and divided world.\nPerhaps it contained the thinnest sliver of truth. High above in the VVIP seats, Qatar\u2019s emir watched on, sitting beside Fifa\u2019s president, Gianni Infantino, and Saudi Arabia\u2019s ruler Mohammed bin Salman. Early last year, when the Saudis were part of a six-nation blockade of Qatar, few would have predicted that.\nOutside the stadium, meanwhile, thousands of ticketless fans had gathered to revel in the moment. And everywhere stereotypes were being smashed, not bottles. Traditional musicians played as kids and their parents danced and smiled. The first Arab and Muslim World Cup reverberated with possibilities.\nThere were no huge queues before kick-off nor a late rush to get in. But on the lush lawns of a perimeter park created in the desert 40km from Doha, thousands of ticketless locals gathered to be part of the moment and queue for a McDonalds.\n\nOne Doha resident, Shahid, who did not wish to share his full name, was looking after his children outside while their mother had got lucky with a ticket for the match. Shahid said he would go to 20 matches during the tournament, having created two Fifa accounts for the purpose. He said the majority of his friends had done the same.\nThe stage was set. The Al Bayt stadium looked spectacular, the pitch perfect. Meanwhile the gigantic air coolers on the side of each stand ensured the temperatures were perfect for players and fans.\nWhen the emir, who arrived by helipad before driving past an immaculate parade of soldiers on camels, turned up in the stadium there was loud applause. Before today a tournament host had never lost their opening World Cup match. But the writing was on the wall long before a double strike by the veteran striker Enner Valencia applied an efficient kill.\nAs the match sagged towards a predictable conclusion the Qataris who remained largely sat in silence, apart from a singing section in purple shirts \u2013 apparently brought in from Lebanon \u2013 behind the goal. By the end even their enthusiasm had waned. Could you blame them?\nThis, of course, has been billed by many as the most controversial World Cup ever, because of Qatar\u2019s human rights record. But, remember, the last one was staged in Russia. And the one before that in Brazil, which has since been shown to have been soaked in corruption.\n\nQatar continues to point out that it has made some notable changes \u2013 in particular laws to abolish the kafala system in 2020, which stopped migrants from changing jobs or leaving the country without their employer\u2019s permission, and introduce a minimum wage. Too many worrying gaps remain in the system, though.\nAnd watching this match, it was hard not to think about the thousands of migrant workers who have lost lives in the last 12 years. Meanwhile reform remains nonexistent when it comes to LGBTQ+ issues and partial regarding women\u2019s rights.\nThe tournament\u2019s opening game also served as an early stress test of how Qatar may cope with the expected influx of 1.2m foreign fans. The signs, it is fair to say, were mixed.\nFour hours before kick-off the cars on the main road into the stadium were barely moving, and there were some empty seats as the opening ceremony began. Meanwhile it was also reported that a group of more than 200 south Asian workers, hired to work on the food stalls at the match, had been without access to food, water or toilet facilities for seven hours.\n\nPerhaps these were early teething problems. The matches on Monday, especially England\u2019s intriguing Group B game against Iran, will provide a much more reliable guide.\nBut as the Al Bayt stadium emptied, one was reminded that the atmosphere was a far cry from the giddiness in the local papers hours earlier, with the Gulf Times promising that the\u201cBest ever Fifa World Cup kicks off in Qatar today\u201d and Al Arab hailed how \u201cQatar turns the Arab dream into reality\u201d.\nSo much for that. Repeatedly the Ecuador fans chanted \u201cqueremos cerveza\u201d \u2013 we want beer \u2013 in celebration. The Qataris, however, will have to find a different way to drown their sorrows.\nAdditional reporting by Paul MacInnes in Doha"

The Moroccan and Arab fans in the stands supported us and gave us strength when we felt tired.\u201d\nIt was a similar story 24 hours earlier after Tunisia also secured a 0-0 draw in their opening game against Denmark in front of a packed crowd dominated by their supporters. \u201cThe fan factor was very positive for us,\u201d said their coach, Jalel Kadri. \u201cIt mentally gave us a great lift and we are looking forward to seeing the fans continue to do that for us.\u201d\nSaudi Arabia, of course, had led the way in a historic victory against Argentina greeted by jubilant scenes in the stands and beyond. \u201cThe number of fans was large, but I hope it will be even larger,\u201d said manager Herv\u00e9 Renard of Saturday\u2019s meeting with Poland.\n\nOf all the trends in the first round of matches at the 2022 World Cup, the excellent start made by the Arab nations \u2013 Qatar aside \u2013 was the most eyecatching. Roared on by passionate supporters and playing in conditions many of the players are accustomed to, there has been a marked improvement in results in comparison with previous World Cups, especially Russia 2018. Saudi Arabia\u2019s 5-0 thrashing by the hosts in the opening match there set the tone, with Tunisia and Morocco losing to England and Iran respectively and failing to make it through the group stages.\nWhereas Renard can perhaps feel confident of matching Saudi Arabia\u2019s best World Cup performance, when they reached the last 16 in 1994, Regragui\u2019s and Kadri\u2019s sides still have it all to do after their stalemates \u2013 two of a record four 0-0 draws in the first round of matches.\nAt this rate, Qatar 2022 is on course to surpass the all-time high of seven goalless draws, which has occurred in four previous tournaments: 1982, 2006, 2010 and 2014. By contrast, none of the first 16 matches at Russia 2018 produced a goalless draw, with only one occurring during the tournament.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s been a boring World Cup by any means \u2013 there were 41 goals in the first round of matches at an average of 2.56 a game compared with 38 four years ago. Twenty-five of the goals in Qatar came in four matches.\nDeciphering trends at a World Cup can be confusing. How have the first 16 games in Qatar yielded no own goals when there were four in 2018 at the same stage, for example? The all-time high of nine own goals in Russia looks unlikely to be surpassed.\nThe absence of red cards during the first round of group matches in Qatar was the first time that no player has been dismissed since 1986, perhaps surprising given the introduction of VAR. Unfortunately for Wales\u2019s Wayne Hennessey, that clean sheet didn\u2019t last long. Meanwhile, there must be some explanation for why there were no goals from direct free kicks during the first round of matches.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to say some trends are more predictable, such as Uruguay\u2019s formidable defensive record at the World Cup. They have gone 465 minutes without conceding a goal in the group stages, since Wayne Rooney\u2019s equaliser for England 15 minutes from time in S\u00e3o Paulo in 2014. Uruguay\u2019s opening match with South Korea featured one shot on target, the lowest since 1986 when Denmark and Scotland registered one shot in their match.\nElsewhere, Andr\u00e9 Ayew\u2019s goal for Ghana against Portugal finally ended Africa\u2019s long wait for a goal in the first round of matches and Japan bucked a trend by recording their first comeback victory at the World Cup, against Germany at the ninth attempt, with the winning goalscorer, Takuma Asano, saying they had been inspired by Saudi Arabia\u2019s success. \u201cWe watched the Saudi game and thought we can do it \u2013 then we just did it today,\u201d he said."

                    "body": "It has been overlooked so far in the middle of so many other urgent issues, but the state of Qatar is currently facing a ticklish existential question. Here is another standard-issue jaw-dropping fact about this place. Climate scientists have estimated that by the year 2070 Qatar will no longer be fit for human habitation. Wait. What?\nLodged between two seas, deprived of greenery or waterways, Qatar is warming at an alarming rate. At the same time Qatar produces more carbon per citizen, for export and domestic use, than any nation on earth. Here is a place that is basically sitting on a pile of gold, while simultaneously gnawing its own legs off. The end of the world? It\u2019s on the check-list. The Supreme Committee is aware of your interest.\nThe answer, it seems, is to build new worlds. Welcome to Lusail, Lego-city of the gods, venue for Qatar\u2019s World Cup final three weeks from now, and surely one of the strangest places on earth.\n\nWalking around Doha there is a general sense of pastiche, of parody-castles conjured out of the air. Andy Warhol would love this place, would probably say something pithy about it, like all the realest things are fake-real, or real-fake. And Warhol would love Lusail most of all, a plastic city built for a hypothetical populace, $45bn (\u00a337bn) in the making, a kind of super-Croydon, as designed by the god of fire.\n\n\nA security guard at the Lusail Iconic Stadium.\n\nThis is a planned city, built wholesale from scratch, and coloured with a mimetic sense of humour. Lusail has a replica Place Vend\u00f4me. Lusail has a fake Beverly Hills (still under construction). There\u2019s a fake Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, and a fake Rimini further down the way just past Entertainment Island, south of Entertainment City (opening date TBC).\nLook at it for long enough and Lusail also explains a couple things. First, why Qatar actually has the World Cup in the first place. And more to the point, why Qatar, for all its mind-boggling dictator-state modernity, should not be seen as a distinct and separate world. This is not an alternate universe. Come to sunny Lusail and find something that seems, in many ways, highly familiar. First, though, the future shock.\nWalking into town past the Iconic Stadium, venue for the World Cup final, you wind down Lusail Boulevard, pipeline to the heart of the city. In a World Cup week it is peopled by a trickle of awed tourists, a mix of Saudis, locals and football-shirted huddles, with a vague sense of some frontier adventure in train, astronauts discovering the Eiffel Tower on an alien beach.\n\nThe Boulevard is an amazing thing, a vast, gleaming causeway of perfect surfaces, electrified with sound and light, modelled on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, but the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es as reimagined by the members of Kraftwerk in a peyote trance.\n\n\n\n\n\nA family walk down the car-free Lusail Boulevard under flags of the competing nations of the World Cup; The packed boulevard before the Brazil v Serbia World Cup match; Screens with a message to upgrade your world on the Lusail Voulevard; The four towers at Al Sa\u2019ad Plaza can be seen from Lusail Boulevard.\n\nHere is a vast gloss-finish colonnade. Here are looming mirrored edifices on both sides. Giant golden pepper grinder towers rise at its end point, because, well, why not? Shiny motorised wild-west carriages wait for someone who wants to ride in a shiny motorised wild-west carriage. Here is an enormous pristine Chuck E Cheese, seductively lit but also empty and sealed, the only sign of life in an orderly row of rat traps.\nIt is a perfect city-scape, albeit one that after about 50 metres becomes pretty much unbearable, an overload of the senses. The piped music is inescapable. Vast scrolling screens carry Stalinist-scale Neymar watch adverts. And as you struggle on, lost in this urban TikTok world, something else keeps happening. Gusts of cold air surge from the pavement gulleys, freezing your ankles. Of course, of course. The municipal authority of Lusail is forcibly cooling the streets. This is how we, humanity, will fight climate change. Crank the dial. Let\u2019s air-condition the world.\nLate on Saturday morning a blaze will break out in one of the towers of Lusail, sending a cloud of black smoke above the skyline. The future, it seems, is on fire. But don\u2019t look up. Enjoy the high-spec present. As they say on the Qatar 2022 Supreme Delivery Committee: Now Is All.\nAnd later that evening, speeding along the marbleised esplanade towards the lights of Winter Wonderland, a machine voice can be heard emerging from some hidden grill. \u201cPlease go back. You are out of the approved zone. Please stay in the approved zone.\u201d It is a fair point well made. We are some way from the approved zone out here. Supercharged by Qatar\u2019s\u2019s despot-ball World Cup, a new world is being built. But for who?\n\n\n\n\n\nMotorboats parked next to the luxury restaurant Beefbar Qatar at the Lusail Esplanade with the ferris wheel of Winter Wonderland in the background; A worker painting in the midday sun at the entrance to the Lusail Winter Wonderland on the man-made island of Al Maha and a communications tower disguised as a palm tree near to the entrance; Some of the Winter Wonderland rides, including the Ice Slide.\n\nThe official version of Lusail is more prosaic and more reasonable. Qatar first announced the plans for this place in 2005, billing it as \u201ca sustainable lifestyle and community \u2026 a haven that is set to attract the world in the coming years\u201d. It is now close to being finished, arching all the way around what was once an empty bay, from The Iconic at one end down to the marina, the esplanade, the man-made islands, the distant Parisian domes.\nLusail is a place foreigners can buy (very expensive) Qatari real estate, most commonly on a 99-year lease. It will eventually host 450,000 people, 250,000 of them its privileged residents, the other 200,000 service people and workers. Lusail is building 36 new schools, a giraffe zoo, water parks and promenades, much of it designed around a mimesis of the old world, a post-modern Milton Keynes of the hyper-rich.\nIt is also beautiful, of course, and crammed with grandiose creative design. In the distance the outline of a vast metal whale shark sculpture floats above the boulevard, lashed on thin steel ropes. The giant shark in the sky is there to indicate (of course), Qatar\u2019s total commitment to preserving wildlife and ecology. It hovers, dream-like, lovely, menacing.\n\n\nA recently unveiled 30-metre art installation of a whale shark, called Al Nehem, suspended between the four Lusail Towers to show Qatar\u2019s concern about endangered species.\n\nAnd at the end of the boulevard are other walkways, other genres. At the end of the boulevard is, in fact, a surprisingly good Elvis impersonator, flanked by a peppy band and serenading a small crowd of street sweepers and tourists about the perils of stepping on his blue suede shoes. \u201cMmmmthangyverrymuch,\u201d Elvis says, then launches into a lavish, deliciously melodic version of It\u2019s Now Or Never, those fat sweet minor chords filling the empty air.\nFurther down there is a kind of ziggurat made from huge Rubik cubes and ringed by giant white swing pods. The heat by the water is soft, every surface bathed in red-blue light. Across the bay a mountainous roller coaster is being built. Crisp new football flags stand erect. A sculpted World Cup sign spells I Heart Qatar. Senses flushed, swooning a little, you feel the tug of the sweet, sweet, sports-washing.\nAcross the deserted bay Lusail Proper looms. There are cars here and people on the walkways, although most seem to be present to serve the people who don\u2019t yet exist. Bugsy Malone-style open-top stretch limos idle. Five basking policemen whistle at a lone jaywalker. The lampposts evolve into curlicued ironwork. And entering the Vend\u00f4me through vast sliding doors beneath golden fake stone buttresses, a transition takes place.\n\n\nBoats for hire at the lake inside the middle of the Place Vend\u00f4me shopping mall.\n\nInside this is just another entrance point to the global luxury shopping-verse. The halls are patrolled by squadrons of security men. The dancing fountains at its centre are ringed by fancy eateries. As the sun dips the lights fill this place with gold. It is frankly incroyable, habibi. A large sign on one wall reads There Can Only Be Beautiful Things to Look Forward To. An encouraging thought. But is it true?\nBecause this thing is also unnerving. There is wealth and life here, but also the sense of a sealed world, an arc in the desert on a planet of eight billion people. Lusail\u2019s public literature keeps using the word \u201csustainable\u201d, which is an interesting notion. And now I am become Death: builder of vast and decorative shopping malls.\nAnd yes, death does keep coming up around here. At Yacht Club tram station on the bay a sign reads \u201cFootball is a culture of peace and respect of human rights\u201d. Next to it is a 24-hour hotline number to Qatar\u2019s National Human Rights Committee. It is tempting go give it a call. \u201cHello? Is that the NHRC? I\u2019d like to report the unexplored deaths of up to 6,500 migrant workers\u2026 Er\u2026 Hello\u2026?\u201d\nQatar\u2019s World Cup development is an engineering miracle. But this is also a guilty miracle. As night creeps in along the lighted seafront, the loudest noises are the clanks and bangs from inside a darkened skeleton skyscraper. Is it falling down? No. This is the sound of people working, hammering this place of panels and precast blocs together, and with plenty of human waste along the way. The migrant workers haunt this place, ghosts at the feast, shadows on the edge of your vision at Qatar\u2019s gleaming stadiums.\n\n\nA sign displaying the rules and regulations at the Lusail promenade.\n\nVery few things have ever been built on this scale and at this speed without human suffering. The Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, would like us to ponder three thousand years (is this right?) of European colonialism before even considering unionised rights and working safety standards for people building a needless vanity project right here and right now.\nIt is a nonsensical line from a despot\u2019s glove puppet. Infantino spent his opening speech at this World Cup lambasting the power hungry elites in service of his own power hungry elite. His every public utterance is like having both ears violently syringed with a solution of walnut oil, amour propre and corporate lies.\nAnd yet, and yet, and yet, there is of course a kernel truth in Infantino\u2019s line of half-thought. There is a strong feeling at this World Cup, taking in the corruption at its source, the repressive laws of its host nation, the absurdity of its basic existence, of simply shouting and pointing at something opaque. And just as Lusail may be startling , as it is intended to be, the othering of Qatar is to be resisted. In fact, look closely and there is a kind of clarity in its more extreme notes.\n\n\nLocals walk past a painted facade made to look like old houses, erected to hide building works going on behind, in the background the Katara Towers on the seafront in Lusail which houses two luxury hotels, where many Fifa officials are staying.\n\nFor one thing it is hard not to be wowed by this new build city, to like it. Someone has to make something new. Why not this? And new things are always strange. There is also the fact the frantic development of Lusail and indeed this World Cup is born out of security threats. This play-place for the global rich is also a form of ballast against regional power grabs. Qatar was until recently a very small spot on the map, keeper of the world\u2019s third largest energy reserves.\n\nFootball, sport, investment, the building of Lusail. This is all about connecting to the world, not so much to be liked, as to be respected, to be a player. Fifa is now on site. Qatar has ultimate visibility.\nAnd beyond that Qatar is not, when you look more widely, some kind of rogue state peopled by a different kind of human being. In fact, the best way to look at it is perhaps as a very literal-minded and efficient expression of the forces at work across every other modern state. Qatar just does it wilder, harder and without apology. It is a reductio ad absurdum of the idea of supremely wealthy overlords, of the surveillance state, of an underclass of workers, of increasingly repressive laws, of the global carbon addiction. Do any of these sound familiar? In many ways Qatar is like your furiously able and efficient younger colleague; who has essentially looked at this, learnt the mannerisms, and said, yeah, we can do that.\n\n\nthe floating pitch on the sea that was put there for FIFA to play on when they get bored in their luxury hotel inside Katara Towers.\n\nSo Qatar builds its Venice and its Paris on the fly, crams a hundred years of growth into a decade, without the cultural flora and fauna to hide its workings. Here it is doing the same thing with the World Cup. OK, we can have one of those. It\u2019s going to be massive. Just like yours. This is the message of Lusail, and of the vast and echoey Iconic Stadium, a kind of warning from the future. Welcome to Winter Wonderland.\nAt the end of the bay the lights melt into the sea. Enormous shiny cars crawl along the double lane highway and turn back. This part of town is not empty. There is an industry of the World Cup here, some early settlers, native joggers, tourists luxuriating in the dreamy glaze of this waterfront Narnia. As the land ends past the Wonderland the scooter motor clicks off, extended beyond its range. Please go back. You are out of the zone."

                    "body": "James Maddison is expected to miss England\u2019s opening game at the World Cup with a slight knee problem that kept him out of training again yesterday. The Leicester midfielder, a surprise inclusion in Gareth Southgate\u2019s squad, has been struggling since limping off during his side\u2019s victory over West Ham last weekend. Maddison has not trained properly since Wednesday and is unlikely to be involved when England face Iran in Group B on Monday.\nThe 25-year-old\u2019s potential absence is a blow for England. Maddison was never likely to start at the Khalifa International Stadium but he would be a useful option off the bench. The injury is not believed to be serious and there is confidence that he will be available when England face Wales and the USA.\n\nThe likely absence of Maddison will enhance the prospects of Conor Gallagher featuring in some role and the midfielder is confident his energetic style will give him a chance of making a positive impact in the Qatari heat. Gallagher was not called up for England\u2019s Nations League games in September and did not expect to be on the plane after struggling to nail down a regular starting role at Chelsea. The 22-year-old had taken the bold decision to return to his boyhood club after impressing on loan at Crystal Palace last season and it seemed his international hopes were under threat when he was sent off for two bookings during the first half of Chelsea\u2019s win over Leicester in August.\nThere was a feeling that Gallagher, who has started eight games this season, would have been better served by returning to Palace. Eyebrows were raised when the Chelsea academy graduate edged Southampton\u2019s James Ward-Prowse out of Gareth Southgate\u2019s 26-man squad for Qatar.\n\u201cTo be honest, I didn\u2019t expect it,\u201d Gallagher said. \u201cI was a little bit surprised., \u201cI\u2019ve not played consistent football with Chelsea and as a team Chelsea have not played great this season \u2013 we\u2019ve definitely got a lot to improve and I am sure we will.\n But I am very grateful and honoured that the England manager has belief in me and saw what I can do when I\u2019ve played for Chelsea this season and, obviously, last season as well. It\u2019s football. The road is never just going to go up. There\u2019s always bumps in the road. It\u2019s just about keeping believing in myself.\u201d\n\nSouthgate has explained that Gallagher, who has four caps, can give England something different. He offers a goalscoring threat from midfield and could be a useful option off the bench when England play Iran. The stadiums are air-conditioned but kicking off at 4pm could still be challenging for Southgate\u2019s players.\n\u201cI feel like I can bring energy going forward and defensively as well,\u201d Gallagher said. \u201cIn whatever position the manager players me, I will do my best to be as effective as I can on the pitch. Whether that\u2019s to score goals or try to win the ball back then that\u2019s what I can do.\u201d\nEngland ramped up their preparations by training again in scorching conditions on Friday. They took to the field at their Al-Wakrah Sports Club base at 12.30pm local time for the second consecutive day, with the temperature at 33C.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big difference from the cold, wet weather at home but I feel that we have adapted well,\u201d Gallagher said. \u201cWhen that first game comes we will be raring to go, no matter what the temperatures are.\u201d\nThomas Tuchel, Chelsea\u2019s former head coach, has previously compared Gallagher to N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9. \u201cWhen he said it, it did make me laugh and surprise me a little bit,\u201d Gallagher said. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously a massive compliment, even if I\u2019m half the player Kant\u00e9 is because I feel like he\u2019s the best midfielder in the world. We are obviously different players. He probably gets around a bit more than me. He\u2019s a bit sharper than me.\u201d\nDespite the modesty it is clear that Southgate values Gallagher. The 22-year-old has done well when given opportunities by Graham Potter, who replaced Tuchel in September. He scored his first goal for Chelsea in October and impressed Southgate by accepting a call-up to the Under-21s when not involved in England\u2019s Nations League camp. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t do my job properly and go and play with the 21s then I probably would not be here now,\u201d Gallagher said."

                    "body": "Pep Guardiola has confirmed Kyle Walker will not play for Manchester City before the World Cup and that Kalvin Phillips has only an outside chance of doing so, but said each was optimistic of being fit for England should Gareth Southgate name them in his 26-man squad. Walker has been out with a groin problem since 2 October, and Phillips\u2019s shoulder injury was sustained on 14 September. Southgate considers them automatic choices when fit and with Chelsea\u2019s Reece James, another of his preferred right-backs, out until after the group stage, the manager faces a dilemma regarding how many players not 100% he can take to Qatar.  Guardiola said of Walker, who can play in central defence as well as at right-back, and Phillips, a midfielder: \u201cThey are better, I think they are getting better, Kalvin especially, but they are out. Until after the World Cup, they will not be ready [for City].\u201d The manager was then brighter regarding Phillips. \u201cHe said he feels really well,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cHis mobility in the shoulder is perfect. He\u2019s started to train in contact with the ball. He has to avoid contact with teammates but he\u2019s really well. We\u2019re surprised at how quick his development [has been]. \u201cIf he\u2019s fit then I believe he can play [at the World Cup]. If he\u2019s ready he can maybe take minutes [for City before] but I don\u2019t know right now. We\u2019ll see.\u201d Southgate is due to name his squad on 10 November, two days before City\u2019s final pre-World Cup fixture. Guardiola, asked about Phillips\u2019s and Walker\u2019s mood, said: \u201cThey are in a positive way, they are optimistic, they are ready. I think they are in touch with Gareth. The managers of the national team, maybe they have more info. Hopefully they can get it and be ready to be selected at the end. It\u2019s a question for the national team.\u201d Erling Haaland was replaced at half-time of Tuesday\u2019s draw at Borussia Dortmund after feeling unwell. Regarding the striker\u2019s availability for Saturday\u2019s trip to Leicester, Guardiola said: \u201cHe feels better but we have training this [Friday] afternoon. We will assess in a few hours. We will see how he is feeling, if he is fit.\u201d Guardiola\u2019s contract expires next summer. In the close season he stated discussions may occur during the break for the World Cup. Asked on Friday whether this was on the agenda, he said: \u201cNot yet.\u201d Guardiola believes Manchester United are serious title contenders again. \u201cI have a feeling that United is coming. Finally, United is coming. I saw yesterday [against Sheriff] and Chelsea [last Sunday] the first half. I thought: \u2018I like it, what I see from United just now\u2019.\u201d"

                    "body": "Phil Foden had unleashed the blond bombshell look, \u00e0 la Gazza, and he was ready to take Euro 2020 by storm. To say that it did not work out for the 22-year-old midfielder on an individual level is an understatement. Each and every detail went against him, the big ones, the small ones and even those over which he had no control.\nIt is a large part of the reason why Foden readily admits that England are yet to see the best of him. \u201cDefinitely not,\u201d he says, after training in the searing heat of Qatar on Thursday lunchtime before England\u2019s World Cup opener against Iran on Monday.\nOr why Foden does not remotely consider himself world-class despite the trophies he has won and the profile he has built since breaking through at Manchester City. \u201cDefinitely not,\u201d he says again. The numbers are not good \u2013 two goals in 18 caps, the first of which he won in Iceland in September 2020, and the less said about that trip the better.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it is easy coming into a team and not knowing the players very well,\u201d Foden says. \u201cYou have to learn what they like best \u2013 running behind or wanting balls to feet. [But] I have had enough experience in the England team to understand the players. I should have scored a lot more for England. I am hoping that this World Cup can be good for me and hopefully I can bring goals.\u201d\nFoden enters with confidence and perhaps it is because he is the only member of the squad who knows what it is like to have won a World Cup. He triumphed in the Under-17 edition in 2017, when he was named player of the tournament. Have his teammates picked his brains over that? \u201cI don\u2019t think they realise,\u201d Foden replies with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to tell them that I\u2019ve already won the World Cup, aren\u2019t I? It changed some of our lives forever.\n\u201cI do remember strongly the team just being so confident. Not being big-headed but we just knew that we were going to win because of how good we were. It\u2019s the same here with this squad. Making it to the final of the Euros gives the team a big lift. I think Harry [Kane] has already touched on it. He sees us as one of the favourites. We\u2019ve just got to be confident and believe in that.\u201d\n\nFoden\u2019s Euros might have taken a different course had an early shot in the opening game against Croatia gone in rather than come back off a post. \u201cIt could have turned my tournament around,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you score, your confidence goes through the roof and you feel like you can do anything.\u201d\nInstead it lurched the other way after he picked up a booking for a needless 64th-minute foul on the Croatia defender Josko Gvardiol. The consequences would be extreme, out of all proportion to the offence. When Mason Mount was ruled out of the final group game against the Czech Republic and the last-16 tie against Germany, having been a close contact of Scotland\u2019s Covid-positive Billy Gilmour, Gareth Southgate removed Foden from the lineup that took on the Czechs.\nThe manager did not want Foden to collect a second yellow card and a suspension against Germany. In came Bukayo Saka, who excelled, and Foden would feature again only as an extra-time substitute in the semi-final win over Denmark. He would miss the final after suffering a serious foot injury in training. The session had ended and it sounded as if Foden was messing around.\n\u201cI was doing a bit of long passing after training and I decided to do some kind of touch and I felt something in my foot,\u201d he says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t walk. It was quite bad and they said to me it was an injury you do not see very often. To sit out the final \u2013 probably one of the biggest games of my life \u2013 was really difficult.\u201d\nFoden, who has been in and out of the City team since the beginning of October, wants to transfer his club scoring form to the World Cup. He has eight goals for City this season, putting him on course to break his career high of 16 in 2020-21, and he believes he is getting into better areas, mainly from wide starting positions. In previous seasons, he played as a false 9, at times. There is no need for that now Erling Haaland has joined.\nWhat is Foden\u2019s best role? There is the sense that Southgate has not quite found it, although he has seemingly tried him everywhere, including as a deep-sitting playmaker and up front alongside Kane. \u201cI see myself playing behind the striker in the future or as one of the 8s or 10s at City,\u201d Foden says. \u201cYou can influence the game more centrally because sometimes you are standing out wide \u2026\u201d\nFoden is fiercely motivated to step up at the World Cup but there is one pre-tournament difference \u2013 there is no peroxide rinse. \u201cIt was unbelievable to see everyone doing it [at the Euros],\u201d Foden says. \u201cMy phone was daily going off with: \u2018This kid\u2019s got the haircut!\u2019 It was surreal. I am just going to stick with what I have got this time round unfortunately.\u201d"

My colleague Imogen Dewey kicked us off last week and has passed the baton my way for this second instalment. In the first full week of summer it\u2019s little surprise that music, sport and health are top of mind. While I\u2019ve got your attention, subscribe to our weekday Morning Mail newsletter for the lowdown on what happened while you slept, and Afternoon Update to get you up to speed on the commute. For now, here\u2019s some fine writing to get the weekend juices flowing. 1. Is Facebook losing its US$100bn metaverse gamble?  Facebook\u2019s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, is increasingly spending his time trying to perfect his vision of the virtual reality future. Out in the real world, the future of the social media behemoth is suddenly looking shaky: the parent company Meta has laid off 13% of the workforce and investors have made for the exits, wiping US$80bn off its valuation in the process. Virtual reality competitors such as VRChat and Rec Room are thriving. At Meta HQ, employees are wondering whether Zuckerberg\u2019s vanity project will kill the company. By the numbers: Reality Labs, Meta\u2019s metaverse division, has lost US$3.7bn in the past three months. Worse is expected to come. How long will it take to read? Five minutes. 2. A \u2018deeply uncomfortable\u2019 World Cup experience Guardian Australia\u2019s deputy sport editor, Emma Kemp, has just returned from Qatar, where she had a front-row seat to the Socceroos taking it to the world\u2019s best. \u201cThe pre-tournament stream of news and commentary about what was happening off the pitch slowed as journalists shifted their focus to the football,\u201d she writes. And although she enjoyed herself, the \u201cgrotesque pang of privilege\u201d was never far from the surface. Notable quote: \u201cYou can try to bridge the gap all you like, by chatting and joking and humanising the person who has just served you something from a fridge you could have opened yourself. Truthfully, though, that process only helps you \u2013 the workers themselves will still be there, standing sentry at their station like servants inside a mansion of disproportionate wealth.\u201d How long will it take to read?

The price of \u2018sugar free\u2019 Even if you\u2019re not seeking out artificial sweeteners, the chances are you\u2019re consuming them. Researchers in Hong Kong have detected them not just in sugarless chewing gum, but also in salad dressings, bread and instant noodles. As the world scrambles to cut down on sugar, Bee Wilson\u2019s long read asks: are sweeteners as harmless as we thought? Key takeaway: Every expert Wilson spoke to said the best answer for our health would be for people to get used to a less sweet diet. \u201cBut sweeteners are no easy thing to give up,\u201d she writes.

Suffice to say, it was the talk of the newsroom, generating highly polarised views. Why the Nora Ephron photo above? Take it away, Isabel. \u201cWhen I found myself sad and lonely in the Upper West Side apartment of my now-ex-boyfriend\u2019s dreams, I turned to Nora Ephron. I hunted through her body of work searching for clues, trying to understand who and what my ex-boyfriend loved and feared.\u201d How long will it take to read? Three minutes. 5. Wrapped in stats A clinical dissection of who you are as a person or a cynical marketing exercise? #SpotifyWrapped dominates Twitter and Instagram for 24 hours each year as tastemakers and punters share their most-played music of the past 11 months, even if in my case that does lead off with Kanye West thanks to a post-doco, pre-antisemitism discography binge. But I digress \u2026 Where exactly your music taste comes from is a matter too complex even for the Spotify algorithm. Katie Hawthorne speaks to two authors with alternative takes: one romantic, the other more scientific. \u201cAlthough streaming services might surreptitiously curate our listening experiences,\u201d Hawthorne writes, \u201cSpotify can\u2019t account for the songs that get stuck in our heads.\u201d Fun fact: Those genres you\u2019re assigned to, like Escape Room or Float House?

The US men are guaranteed $13m in prize money for reaching the last 16 in Qatar. That will be shared equally between the men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams under the equal pay agreement struck between US Soccer and the USWNT Players\u2019 Association earlier this year (10% of the money will go to the US Soccer Federation). For context, the $6.5m coming to the women\u2019s team is more than they won in total for their last two World Cup victories. The USWNT earned $4m for winning the 2019 World Cup and $2m for their title in 2015.  The prize money for the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup has not yet been set, although Fifa president Gianni Infantino has said he wants to \u201cat least double\u201d the pot from 2019. However, even if the prize money doubles to $60m, it would still be dwarfed by the $440m handed out to men\u2019s teams in Qatar. Under this year\u2019s agreement the US men will get 50% of the US women\u2019s prize money in 2023. World Cup prize money was not the only area where equal deals were reached in the US teams\u2019 agreement, which was ratified in May and formally signed in September. Shares of ticket sales will now be equal, as will win bonuses. Some aspects of income and benefits will differ between the teams. The men did not share their $2.5m bonus for qualifying for this year\u2019s World Cup as it was part of the their previous CBA. Walker Zimmerman, who is part of the US squad in Qatar and a member of the US men\u2019s players\u2019 union, said in May that he was happy with the deal. \u201cThere are tough conversations, but at the end of the day, it is the right thing to do,\u201d Zimmerman said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that [the US women\u2019s team players] deserve. It\u2019s something that they have fought for so hard, and, to be honest, sometimes it does feel like we had just kind of come alongside of them and had been a little late.\u201d Becky Sauerbrunn, the USWNT players\u2019 association president, said in May that the agreement would ensure success for the team in the future. \u201cWe hope that this agreement and its historic achievements in not only providing for equal pay but also in improving the training and playing environment for national team players will similarly serve as the foundation for continued growth of women\u2019s soccer both in the United States and abroad.\u201d The US women\u2019s team has long fought for equal treatment with the men\u2019s team. In December 2020 they reached an agreement with US Soccer over equal work conditions with their male counterparts. The players were granted the same conditions as the US men\u2019s team in areas such as travel, hotel accommodation, the right to play on grass rather than artificial turf, and staffing. Then, in February, the team agreed a $24m settlement that ended a six-year legal battle over equal pay. The teams will be guaranteed $17m if the US beat the Netherlands on Saturday to reach the quarter-finals. In the unlikely event the US win the title in Qatar they will earn $42m. They US women shouldn\u2019t hold their breath though \u2013 their male counterparts are 90-1 with most bookmakers to lift the trophy."

                    "body": "Qatar\u2019s longest-lasting legacy following the World Cup won\u2019t be football or even its human rights record \u2013 it will be the climate crisis, according to a new report warning that its huge expansion of gas extraction could push the planet into catastrophic global heating. Should Qatar exploit all of its oil and gas reserves it will eventually add an enormous 50bn metric tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere once burned, which is more than the entire annual emissions of the whole world, the new research, shared with the Guardian, has found. This vast output of emissions will in itself push the world beyond the internationally agreed limit of 1.5C of global heating beyond industrial times, beyond which scientists warn there will be increasingly disastrous impacts from heatwaves, droughts, floods and biodiversity die-offs. QatarEnergy, the state-owned petroleum operation that is overseeing a huge escalation in the country\u2019s oil and gas output, is a sponsor of the World Cup currently under way in Qatar. Fifa, which has been accused of falsely claiming the World Cup will be carbon neutral, has featured QatarEnergy in sponsorship slots in stadiums and online even as the global football body launched a campaign called #SavethePlanet in which it warned the climate crisis \u201cthreatens the essential ingredients of good health\u201d and causes \u201cincreasing destructiveness of extreme weather events\u201d. Qatar\u2019s vast oil and gas resources have greatly enriched the small Middle Eastern country, which this year became the world\u2019s largest exporter of liquified natural gas (or LNG), superseding the US and Australia. It is now looking to further cement its position by ramping up production from a vast offshore gas deposit called the north field, which will account for 70% of the emissions growth according to the new report by BankTrack, an NGO that used data from BP to ascertain the extent of Qatar\u2019s \u201ccarbon bomb\u201d projects. The emissions from Qatar\u2019s oil and gas resources will cause $20tn in damages and 11m deaths around the world, BankTrack said, citing calculations based upon recent research looking at the economic and mortal cost of fossil fuels. QatarEnergy has signed recent partnership deals with western oil giants including Shell, Total, ConocoPhilips, Exxon and Eni in order to boost output of the north field by 60% over the next five years. Separate deals have been struck in the past month with Germany and China to provide the countries with gas amid concerns over supplies disrupted by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Saad Sherida al-Kaabi, Qatar\u2019s energy minister and chief executive of QatarEnergy, said last month Qatar will \u201cprovide reliable and credible LNG supply solutions to customers across the globe\u201d. No new fossil fuel infrastructure can be built if the world is to avoid breaching the 1.5C limit, the International Energy Agency has warned, but despite this there has been plenty of financial support for Qatar\u2019s gas expansion. JPMorgan Chase, Citi, HSBC, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, MUFG, Credit Suisse and Bank of America have all backed planned projects in the north field, providing nearly $12bn in bond underwriting services to QatarEnergy. \u201cThere\u2019s a massive amount of emissions about to come from oil and gas taken from Qatar, although there hasn\u2019t been much attention to it until now,\u201d said Henrieke Butijn, climate campaigner and researcher at BankTrack. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening in Qatar is awful in terms of these projects and also worker conditions, but there is a level of hypocrisy here because Qatar isn\u2019t acting alone. \u201cFifa selected Qatar for the World Cup and chose QatarEnergy as one of the main sponsors, even while they push their own climate campaign. And banks which have made net zero emissions commitments all know what they are doing when they are underwriting QatarEnergy. These banks need to cut off any finance that isn\u2019t aligned with the 1.5C goal.\u201d At the recent UN Cop27 climate summit in Egypt, the world\u2019s governments again committed to keeping below 1.5C, although emissions reduction pledges currently fall drastically short of meeting this target. While wind and solar energy deployment is growing rapidly \u2013 clean energy is set to overtake coal as an energy source globally by 2025 \u2013 the world is still teeing up vast quantities of fossil fuels that would push societies into climate meltdown should they be burned. A huge 3.5tn tons of greenhouse gas emissions will be emitted if governments allow identified reserves of coal, oil and gas to be extracted and used, a recent released in September found. Qatar\u2019s 50bn tons of emissions will occur if it allows all of its deposits to be burned. While this may not happen if other countries move decisively away from fossil fuels as an energy source, there is currently no commitment from Qatar that it won\u2019t completely exhaust its reserves. In previous years there have been claims Qatar\u2019s gas reserves could last more than 130 years. QatarEnergy was contacted for comment on the research. On its website, the state-owned body states that the climate crisis is \u201cone of the most critical issues of our times\u200b and requires prompt and dedicated action at a global scale\u201d. \u201cFossil fuels are weapons of mass destruction, carbon bombs ticking against the time we have left to avert the very worst of the climate crisis,\u201d said Harjeet Singh, head of global political strategy at Climate Action Network International. \u201cFossil fuel companies, the banks that fund them and the governments that support them are complicit in the suffering of millions. It is time to strip them off their social and economic licenses and make them pay up for climate damages.\u201d"

                    "body": "A man requiring a wheelchair claims he was booted from his Qatar Airways flight after boarding the plane and left stranded at Melbourne airport because of his disability. The story of Craig Nolan, an Australian man with spina bifida whose plan to return to his home in Finland via Doha was disrupted, comes after the disability royal commission heard evidence in recent weeks that airlines are \u201cdehumanising\u201d Australians with disabilities, who they treat as an \u201cafterthought\u201d. On Monday, Nolan arrived at Tullamarine airport for his flight to Doha, having already alerted the airline to his disability and the fact he would be travelling solo \u2013 something the well-travelled 43-year-old has grown used to doing.  Nolan had been in Australia for several months, having returned in September for a family funeral. Nolan said he was made to check in his wheelchair and transferred to an aisle seat \u2013 a narrow chair that requires another person to push it that some airlines use to take passengers to their seat on a plane. This involved ground staff lifting him up over a roughly large step from the airbridge onto the plane. However, before the flight took off, Nolan said he told one of the cabin crew he would need assistance to reach the in-cabin bathroom, because he needed someone to push his aisle chair there. Soon after, he said another member of the cabin crew told Nolan he had to leave the flight. Nolan was stranded at the airport, with Melbourne airport putting him up in a hotel initially. He has since tried to apply for a refund on his flight ticket, and said Qatar Airways was going to deduct about $400 from the refund because he was listed as a \u201cno show\u201d in their system.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Nolan told the Guardian he believes he was removed from the flight due to a misunderstanding \u2013 that the cabin crew wrongly assumed he would need assistance throughout the flight including when in the bathroom. \u201cHad they listened they would have realised I only needed help to be pushed from my chair to the toilet, which is part of their job description. I wasn\u2019t asking for help in the plane or in the bathroom,\u201d Nolan said. Nolan, who runs a translation company and a disability auditing company with his partner in Finland, said he had been made to fly in aisle seats numerous times when travelling by himself internationally but had never encountered a similar misunderstanding. He said he was particularly frustrated at the thought the incident could have been avoided had Qatar Airways\u2019 crew asked him directly. Guardian Australia has contacted Qatar Airways, but a spokesperson did not respond by deadline. Nolan\u2019s experience comes after the disability royal commission heard evidence that people with disabilities are routinely subject to violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation when flying domestically through Australian airports. In workshops with more than 60 Australians with a disability held in recent weeks, the commission heard that participants frequently faced extended and unreasonable wait-times when checking into flights, denial or lack of access to necessary information and support pre-flight, and that accessible flight options were poorer in regional and remote locations. The royal commission also heard that discrimination and poor service were more prominent amid flight cancellations \u2013 which were at record levels in the middle of the year. People with disabilities said they were seen as an \u201cafterthought\u201d when passengers on cancelled flights are managed. Participants also told the royal commission that whenever issues arise when flying domestically, they frequently do not receive \u201ctimely and appropriate responses by Airlines\u201d, with participants reporting experiences of being \u201csilenced\u201d and \u201cdismissed\u201d. \u201cAirlines are good at \u2018dehumanising\u2019 people with disabilities,\u201d one participant told the royal commission workshop. \u201cWhen issues are brought to them, they are easily dismissed and not taken seriously.\u201d Another participant, the disability advocate Zoe Simmons, said: \u201cOur stories just get swept under the rug. We get told we are the problem. People don\u2019t realise how widespread the problem is.\u201d Acceptance of assistance dogs was also raised as an issue. Participants reported it is common to be barred from travelling on flights with their assistance dogs. The royal commission also heard that most aircraft limit the number of wheelchairs to two per flight, and that some aircraft do not allow passengers to bring their wheelchairs on board and instead require passengers to transfer into aisle chairs. The royal commission\u2019s insights follow the Guardian\u2019s reporting of travellers with a disability being rejected assistance and left stranded at airports \u2013 with their complaints falling on deaf ears. In August, Tony Jones, who relies on a wheelchair due to a spinal cord injury, lodged a complaint with the Australian Human Rights Commission after he was turned away at the gate when trying to board a Jetstar flight in Sydney. Lawyers representing Jones have said there are low levels of industry compliance with disability standards, and that the onus is not on airlines and airports to comply but rather on individuals to make discrimination complaints \u2013 with the AHRC the only avenue."

                    "body": "Reading the Brazil attacking options aloud would make any opposition manager feel a little nervous. Tite could start with Neymar, Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior, Richarlison and Raphinha and if things are not going their way he has Gabriel Jesus, Gabriel Martinelli, Rodrygo, Antony and Pedro in reserve. They will take some stopping in Qatar.\nI have always had a soft spot for Brazil \u2013 I would buy the yellow and blue kit as a kid \u2013 because of all their incredible players. We are in another era of brilliant Brazilian forwards 20 years after they last won the World Cup, when Ronaldo led them to glory. They are on a great run of form, having not lost since their Copa Am\u00e9rica final defeat by Argentina in July last year. I think they will need to face their old South American rivals again in the semi-finals and whoever gets the better of that match will become champions.\nPeople keep saying how it could be Lionel Messi\u2019s final tournament but it could be Neymar\u2019s too, and both will be especially motivated by the prospect of a winner\u2019s medal. It will be interesting to see which of those two Paris Saint-Germain teammates fares better. I think Messi will win the Golden Boot but Brazil have a slight edge over Argentina.\n\nTournament football requires match-winners and Brazil have an array of them. Games are so close because of how data can be used to help set up a team to be compact and nullify threats, but Brazil\u2019s starters and finishers can turn any match in their favour.\nTite has said it will be a case of horses for courses when it comes to selection. The philosophy of Brazil will never change but the coach may decide for a certain game he wants someone who can run in behind, greater physicality from Richarlison, or he could want to press more aggressively or overload in wide areas. Tite will have seen what Jesus has done since moving to Arsenal and may want to go with him. For one-v-one situations on the flanks, will he turn to Vin\u00edcius or Martinelli? Whatever he needs, Tite can look at his squad and pick accordingly and he will be spoiled for choice.\nBehind that they will have a very experienced midfield and defence. Casemiro will be at the heart of it and everyone has seen the difference he makes to a team. Brazil will need to stop the transition, which is what Casemiro, Fred or Fabinho are in the side to do, because transitions will be hugely significant. The central midfield combination will have a big job because Brazil\u2019s defence is ageing. On the upside, the older a player is, the more experience they have and that could be vital. There is not much Dani Alves and Thiago Silva have not witnessed and their presence could help their younger teammates.\n\nPreviously Brazil have not been a pressing team but they will now press from the front because they want to win the ball as high as possible. They may require fewer defenders because Tite will know if this plan works out, the ball is not going to make it into the areas where opponents can hurt them. I like that Tite is not going to change his principles and why would he with such an arsenal at his disposal?\nOn paper, Brazil should beat Serbia, Switzerland and Cameroon in their Group G games and score goals to ignite the campaign. If a team get a good start, it is a great boost. Everything in tournament football is anchored in momentum, helping to grow confidence as each successful match passes.\n\nEach team in this World Cup has a weak unit. France have lost their midfield from four years ago through injury, England\u2019s back four looks fragile and Brazil\u2019s defence is getting old. It will be a case of who manages their problem the best.\nIf England are to challenge, they will need to gather momentum. In international football I am a huge fan of experience and Gareth Southgate has gone with high cap accumulation in his squad \u2013 820 between them. This is his third major tournament and it is the most caps he\u2019s gone with. Kyle Walker\u2019s fitness is unknown and Harry Maguire is not playing for his club, meaning the England defence will be desperate for an early morale-boosting clean sheet. Southgate also has options to bring on if he needs to win a game. A forward line of Phil Foden, Harry Kane and Raheem Sterling means England will score goals but it is the other end they need to pay attention to.\n\nI would love England to make it to the final but I\u2019m tipping Spain to get there. In last year\u2019s Euros, Spain were knocked out by the eventual winners, Italy, on penalties in the semi-finals. Their young players have grown in maturity and understanding. The only problem is scoring goals. Brazil have goalscorers all over the pitch but that cannot be said of Luis Enrique\u2019s side. Spain have a good opportunity if they can find a consistent scorer.\nEngland will need fans behind them. Even though they are thousands of miles away, they will feel the support. If they are not to win it, hopefully I will have my second team to fall back on."

                    "body": "Amid a cacophony of beeping car horns, fireworks, and people hanging from car windows waving flags, cheering football fans poured on to Paris\u2019s Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es on Wednesday night to celebrate France beating Morocco to reach the World Cup final, hoping it would become the first country in 60 years to retain the title. \u201cWe\u2019re in the final!\u201d yelled Romain, 16, who had high school the next day but was planning a late night celebrating. \u201cWhen France won the World Cup in 2018, I was 12 and couldn\u2019t really celebrate in the streets,\u201d he said. \u201cIt feels brilliant tonight, but facing Argentina will be close, nail-biting.\u201d People danced, cheered and climbed lampposts and traffic lights as vans of police stood guard. More than 2,000 officers, including riot police in body armour, were stationed around the Champs-Elys\u00e9es and across Paris in order to control the crowds and keep them to the pavements. More than 5,000 officers were deployed in the greater Paris area, and a total of 10,000 across the country. In Lyon, local media reported that police had fired teargas after stones and projectiles were thrown at them.  Even as the match was nearing the end, workmen with power drills were still hastily boarding up the windows of sports shops and other businesses on the Champs-Elys\u00e9es as a precaution against vandalism, but the crowds remained calm, and included some families and children in Santa hats. Large numbers of dual French-Moroccan nationals had sat together in nearby bars watching the champions, France, face the outsider success story, Morocco, and there were also Moroccan flags amid the celebrating crowd on the Champs-Elys\u00e9es. Some fans were wrapped in French and Moroccan flags tied together, while others hanging out of car windows waved the flags of both countries at once.  Rays, a care worker in the southern town of Montpellier, had come to Paris to celebrate his 21st birthday the night before. He watched the match wrapped in the Moroccan flag alongside friends who were France fans sporting tricolour face paint. \u201cFrance played brilliantly,\u201d he said. \u201cI was born in France to Moroccan and Algerian parents. I really, really wanted Morocco to be the first African team to make it to the World Cup final. It would have been historic, but it wasn\u2019t to be. Argentina will be hard to beat now \u2013 Messi wants one last trophy.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m really happy and proud. Both teams played so well,\u201d said Domitilla, 22, a French-Italian communications worker wearing red, white and blue face paint who had watched the match in a local bar. She lives in a flat near the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. \u201cI\u2019m a bit worried that I won\u2019t get any sleep tonight,\u201d she said as cars streamed towards the avenue, beeping furiously, and fireworks went off. Alexis, 25, a French engineer, said: \u201cThe last time they won the World Cup, I was at a scout camp in the countryside, so it\u2019s good to be following it in the city now. France have done brilliantly.\u201d A group of six off-duty police officers wearing red, white and blue facepaint and draped in French flags were heading from a bar to the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es to celebrate. \u201cIt was a magnificent game, beautiful to watch. Morocco was a very strong team,\u201d said one. \u201cNow we just hope the night goes OK for our colleagues policing here. We won\u2019t stay late \u2013 we\u2019ve got work in the morning.\u201d"

                    "body": "\u201cI asked myself the question and my answer was that they can\u2019t kill my passion: I still love football,\u201d Thomas Hitzlsperger says, but he knows they have tried. It is nine years since he became the first Premier League footballer to reveal he is gay, a decision that improved his life and those of others too. \u201cEven today,\u201d he says, \u201csomeone came up to me and said: \u2018Are you who I think you are?\u2019 I said: \u2018Probably.\u2019 He put his thumbs up, said: \u2018Good on you.\u2019\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s so powerful, which is why I say to others: it\u2019s not just your personal situation, which is of course the most important thing. And that\u2019s why I don\u2019t stop speaking up. Now when I reflect, my decision was all about what impact I can have on society, without overdoing it.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised how many people you can reach,\u201d the former Aston Villa, West Ham and Everton midfielder says, reflecting on the role of LGBTQ supporters\u2019 groups, the increase in symbolism, a shift in attitudes at clubs embracing the gay community. He discusses how more athletes have stood up, how he \u201cwould love to see a big, active player come out\u201d, and how there has been a \u201cbig, big change\u201d. He says: \u201cThe environment is constantly improving in football, at least in most parts.\u201d\nAnd then on Sunday, the World Cup kicks off in a country where being gay is illegal. Only last week Khalid Salman, an ambassador for the competition, described homosexuality as a \u201cmental defect\u201d. Football enabled this, politicians and sports people have justified or normalised it. David Beckham has been paid to promote Qatar.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just wrong,\u201d Hitzlsperger says, and nor is the \u201csickening\u201d situation for homosexuals in Qatar the only aspect that concerns him. Indeed his discussion now, and the focus of a documentary he has just filmed in Qatar and Nepal, begins instead with the widow describing her husband coming home in a coffin, the workers he met who go unpaid. Those are the stories that have left him wondering where the line is. Not just their line \u2013 that, he thinks, is all too clear \u2013 but his own.\n\nThe former player \u2013 who represented Germany 52 times, played in a World Cup and a European Championship and won the Bundesliga with VfB Stuttgart \u2013 has grappled with how he should engage with a tournament he will be watching from a studio in Mainz for German television.\nEven doing that meant examining his conscience; while others, such as Gary Neville with beIN Sports, have chosen to go to the Gulf state, Hitzlsperger says: \u201cIf I had the option, I wouldn\u2019t: it just doesn\u2019t feel right after what I have seen, the things I have said in public. You can\u2019t be paid by Qatar or Fifa and at the same time criticise them, it doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\u201cYou see the world we live in: how sick it is that we allowed Qatar to buy the right to send pictures to the world for four weeks, presenting themselves as something they\u2019re not. It\u2019s not just sad, it\u2019s sick.\n\u201cA Nepali worker told me he saw people collapse in the heat, so they\u2019re put in a room to cool down for an hour, then you have to work again. The paperwork says: \u2018Died in his sleep.\u2019 That\u2019s not the reason. The government says the Kafala system doesn\u2019t exist but it still does, in practice. There are so many things you think: this must not happen. But it does. And to me Fifa allowed it to happen.\n\n\u201cI spoke to a woman from Human Rights Watch who said Qatari officials have figures but don\u2019t publish them. I met a young woman there who tried to show me how open it was and when worker deaths came up, she said the criticism was not justified. She even used the phrase \u2018fake news\u2019. She doesn\u2019t get to see it: she thinks the west is against Qatar. So it\u2019s difficult to judge how many deaths there have been, but it\u2019s not three.\u201d\nThree is the number the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, claimed.\n\u201cPeople criticise Qatar, but we have to discuss Fifa\u2019s role, those from the former executive committee who took the money,\u201d Hitzlsperger says. \u201cBecause if no one would take it, if no one received it, Qatar would have a problem. But the greed in the football business is just immense.\u201d\nFifa has since acknowledged these wrongdoings and the need for reform, in the 2017 Garcia report.\n\u201cThere is so much money involved and some people have no morals and just take it. You find a PR agency, you pay them, and they give you a reason. I spoke to Fifa\u2019s media department. They\u2019re incredibly nice, kind people but they make you believe they\u2019re trying everything to get the conversation going and it never happens, so they are smart. It would have been easy for Infantino to explain the improvements, the changes, to say why it makes sense to give Qatar the World Cup. He\u2019s smart enough, but he refuses to speak: why? Why aren\u2019t you more transparent?\u201d\nInstead, Infantino sent a letter to the 32 national federations telling them to focus purely on the football now. \u201cThat shows how fed up they are,\u201d Hitzlsperger says. The Qatari organisers are too, some suggesting that racism lies beneath criticism.\n\u201cThat\u2019s totally understandable,\u201d Hitzlsperger says. \u201cPut ourselves in their shoes: there\u2019s a point where you say: \u2018Look, we\u2019ve had enough, we\u2019ve changed.\u2019 And there has been change, probably more than in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states. We have to mention in their defence that they\u2019ve spent four years with the blockade as well. There\u2019s probably fear. Hosting a tournament is a way of protecting themselves \u2013 as is investing in football clubs. I understand that.\n\u201cBut the price is that it costs lives. And if you bring race into it: prove it, name the people who are racist. We have to understand that they know they can buy whatever they want: you offer people money, they take it. But suddenly there are people saying: \u2018We don\u2019t want your money.\u2019\u201d\nThe question is what can be done now? Hitzlsperger understands that more was not said or done sooner when real change may have been possible \u2013 \u201cthat\u2019s just human nature and I\u2019m not going to blame journalists as it wasn\u2019t on the agenda: why would you talk about Qatar five years ago?\u201d \u2013 and he has doubts about the efficacy of statements such as the One Love rainbow armband to be worn by 10 captains.\n\n\u201cThe original idea was to get together among the European federations and come up with the best idea,\u201d he says, \u201cbut the end product is an armband that possibly means a lot but doesn\u2019t upset anybody. It becomes generic, people go: \u2018What does it mean?\u2019 Then they move on. It doesn\u2019t start a debate. We know the rainbow flag symbol upsets people. People know what it stands for \u2013 and some in Qatar don\u2019t like it so much. That\u2019s stronger.\u201d\nThere are broader conclusions. \u201cThe question has been why don\u2019t teams boycott the tournament? They can\u2019t even agree on an armband,\u201d Hitzlsperger says. Besides, this goes beyond sport. \u201cNot long ago the German FA president and the interior minister said they had been reassured by the Qatari interior minister that everybody would be safe. And you think: what world are we living in?! That someone has to give a guarantee!\u201d\nAnd the message may also be lost in the noise. \u201cWhen it\u2019s every day even people who agree think: \u2018I can\u2019t hear this any more,\u2019\u201d Hitzlsperger concedes. \u201cI\u2019m trying to find a balance between saying it, refusing to be quiet, and not saying it every day. It\u2019s a shame: it destroys part of the game.\u201d\nAh, the game. Hitzlsperger talks eloquently about it. He discusses the evolution in the German side since 2008, laughing about how they needed to get rid of him first and recalling a European Championship final where he could not get near Spain. He talks of Jamal Musiala, a player he can\u2019t quite stop himself momentarily likening to Lionel Messi, concluding: \u201cHe said he wants to become one of the best in the world: I\u2019d put money on that.\u201d\nAnd there\u2019s a fondness for the England manager he first met at 18, recalling Gareth Southgate as a player \u201cwho stood out, smarter\u201d, \u201ca kind man\u201d, a \u201cmodern leader\u201d.\nYet that\u2019s the point: for now at least, the game is lost, used and abused, taken from those for whom it is everything. Hitzlsperger is trying to resist, unwilling to let go. \u201cI still love football but people come into it who don\u2019t know what it means to fans, to players.\n\u201cEverything changes, money dictates everything. I don\u2019t know at what point I will give up, go and watch Sunday league. But I still love it. It\u2019s tiring: everything that has happened makes you not want to watch, but they haven\u2019t managed to kill my passion for the game.\u201d"

                    "body": "Perhaps, in a way, this had to happen eventually. Football\u2019s narrative arc demanded nothing less. The numbers simply made too little sense. Perhaps like Batman v Superman, Godzilla v Kong, the cronut, Manchester United and Qatar was simply a crossover concept begging to be brought into existence. Indulge me for a second. I\u2019m thinking pre-season tours to Doha. I\u2019m thinking an Mbapp\u00e9/Rashford reality TV job-swap. I\u2019m thinking luxury party barges on Manchester Ship Canal. A hologrammatic New Trafford to sit directly above the old one. A Phil Jones mural visible from space. And so to the news that Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani \u2013 a private Qatari individual with no direct connection to Qatar itself, unless you churlishly count the fact that he is its head of state \u2013 is interested in purchasing United. Or perhaps simply a stake in United rather than a full takeover. Or, according to which report you read, not necessarily Thani himself but a fund linked to the royal family, or perhaps the Qatar Investment Authority sovereign wealth fund.  This is pretty much all we know at this stage, which one suspects is exactly how the Qataris want it. Interested enough to test the water, to perform due diligence, to gauge the reaction from fans and the wider game; deniable enough that they can still pull out. One potential sticking point appears to be the valuation of between \u00a36bn and \u00a38bn being imposed by the Glazer family. Once you add investment to the squad and the exorbitant cost of redeveloping Old Trafford and Carrington, you\u2019re close to an 11-figure sum before you\u2019ve even landed in the country. In short: we are not talking another Paris here. It is easily forgotten amid the maelstrom that followed, but Qatar\u2019s initial investment in Paris Saint-Germain was minuscule by comparison: an initial 70% stake that valued the club at less than \u00a3100m. Financially speaking, it was a no-brainer. Paris was a failing club with a knockdown price, enormous potential, unfettered access to one of the richest markets in Europe, no close rivals and a medium-strength league that could easily be brought to heel. None of these advantages exists with United. For all the travails on the pitch, it remains one of the sport\u2019s most successful businesses: a paradigmatic example of how the modern sports club can lucratively leverage its brand and its advertising space without ever needing to trouble a trophy engraver. The Premier League will not simply be bought and bidden as Qatar did with Ligue 1, trapping it in an irresistible pincer movement of unmatchable transfer spending and beIN broadcast rights. If you\u2019re in charge of the sovereign wealth fund of an autocratic nation with a virtually limitless credit facility, you want cast-iron guarantees. Lumbered with an eye-watering price tag and surrounded by predators, United offer very few.  So what might Qatar want from United? Perhaps the same thing that it wanted from Harrods, from Heathrow airport and Sainsbury\u2019s, all of which it either owns or owns significant portions of: immediate identification with a cherished global brand, almost a stake in British society itself. Among cultural entities not even Liverpool or Arsenal can offer the same level of name recognition, the ability to print money simply by being who you are. And as Saudi Arabia discovered with Newcastle, buying a football club earns you an army of pliant bots desperate to do your bidding for you. Before the last World Cup, Qatar surreptitiously paid hundreds of football fans to promote the tournament for them online, rewarding them with free flights and tickets. It\u2019s a bit like that, really, but instead of free flights and tickets it\u2019s Jude Bellingham and Harry Kane. The really interesting question here, by contrast, is what United fans can possibly want out of Qatar. Spending money? If any club can offer a salutary lesson in the dangers of brainlessly flinging resources at the transfer market, then surely it is the club that has spent more than \u00a31bn in transfer fees in the past decade and won a grand total of zero league titles and reached zero Champions League semi-finals. The redevelopment of Old Trafford is long overdue, but anybody who visited the grotesque and soulless domes of Qatar\u2019s World Cup will testify that money can buy you a lot of things, but it doesn\u2019t buy you taste. There are no palatable options on the table here. There is no queue of ethical multibillionaires out there scrambling to claim a piece of one of the world\u2019s dirtiest sports. Nobody has ever accumulated the sums of money required to buy a football club of Manchester United\u2019s size without some form of widespread exploitation: exploitation of the planet, exploitation of human rights, exploitation of some of the world\u2019s poorest and least powerful people. Just because the Glazers were terrible, parasitic owners does not mean the next guys will be any better. But United fans have always liked to think of their club as an exemplar. As somehow more cherished and noble than any other. How stirring it would be if, as in 2005 when they furiously protested against the Glazer takeover, they chose to evoke that sense of exceptionalism for the greater good of the sport. To resist the prostitution of their club to one of the world\u2019s most savage governments. To demand better. The Glazers took hundreds of millions of pounds out of United. A Qatari takeover would take more still: something unique and elemental and important, something that it could never, ever replace."

                    "body": "The ink was barely dry on Qatar\u2019s decision to ban alcohol from World Cup stadiums when an informed insider in Doha was asked why it was happening now, just 48 hours before the tournament\u2019s big kick-off. His response was succinct. \u201cIt\u2019s a deliberate fuck you to the west.\u201d\nOf course it was. Yes, the Qataris wanted to ensure that fans of every nation, religion and creed feel comfortable at matches \u2013 and that wouldn\u2019t be the case if some were boozed-up or blotto. And yes, Qatar remains a conservative Muslim country, in which alcohol is alien to the culture. But that was true on 2 December 2010, the day it won the right to host the World Cup, every bit as much as today.\nSo for it to rip up its promises and policy so late in the day should be seen for what it is: a show of strength and an almighty two fingers up to its critics.\n\nBut, as another well-connected football consultant put it, Friday\u2019s decision is part of a notable change in tack from the Qataris.\n\u201cFor years, they have appeared contrite and humble amid questions about their record,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now with the World Cup so imminent, their attitude has changed. The geopolitics around energy, and the west\u2019s increased need for gas during the war in Ukraine, makes them think they are immune. And if someone attacks them, they hit right back.\u201d\nTake LGBTQ+ rights. For years, western reporters and human rights groups have criticised Qatar\u2019s record. For years, itthe host country has stuck to giving vague assurances that everyone would be welcome. Then this month a Qatari World Cup ambassador, Khalid Salman, called homosexuality a \u201cdamage in the mind\u201d and warned gay fans they would \u201chave to accept our rules\u201d. That is some adjustment.\nMeanwhile when the Sunday Times suggested that Qatar had been using private investigators to target journalists, it didn\u2019t let it pass. Instead it threatened legal action \u201cto ensure those responsible are held to account\u201d.\n\nQatar also believes it has made significant progress on workers\u2019 rights and that this has been largely ignored by a western media who continue to focus on the negatives. That has furthered fuelled its anger and frustration.\nYet, in recent days, Qatar has also sent a more inflammatory message: that many criticisms of its human rights record are based on western racism, or a misplaced sense of western superiority.\nThat message is largely erroneous. And it is misplaced. But it is gathering force by the day.\nAs Qatar\u2019s labour minister, Ali bin Samikh al-Marri, put it this week: \u201cThey don\u2019t want to allow a small country, an Arab country, an Islamic country, to organise the World Cup.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cSome politicians and some media outlets in western countries have lost the moral and professional motive in their attack against Qatar.\u201d\nThat message has been echoed by local media. When a handful of people in the western press questioned whether India-born supporters of England, Brazil and Argentina might be \u201cfake fans\u201d, the Doha News quickly played the racism card.\nMeanwhile the state-run Qatar News Agency enthusiastically endorsed the official position, noting that: \u201cHis Excellency pointed out that the false slander campaign transgressed all limits in its attempt to discredit Qatar, the latest of which was the claim that the World Cup organisers used fake fans who receive money to attend the matches.\u201d\nWhat makes Qatar\u2019s behaviour more remarkable is that usually in the buildup to a World Cup, the Fifa show takes over. Rules are introduced to ensure things are done a certain way, and that brands such as Budweiser who are paying $75m (\u00a363m) are heavily promoted. Not here. Not now.\n\nInstead the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, will spend Saturday morning answering searching questions about whether his organisation will face a massive lawsuit, which ensures the story will run for another 24 hours.\nBut this story isn\u2019t about whether beer should be sold at stadiums. In truth, if the Qataris had decided to ban it years ago, the issue would have long blown over. It is about shifting goalposts and worrying uncertainties.\nFor years it has talked about finding a middle ground between Qatar\u2019s conservative culture while doing its best to accommodate the 1.2 million expected visitors; an entirely reasonable position. But after this, how do we know that other assurances will not also be discarded over the next month? After all, if the Qataris are prepared to disregard the wishes of Fifa and its major sponsors, who could be next?Can LGBTQ+ fans really trust that they won\u2019t be censured for holding hands? Will England fans get in trouble for a minor cultural misunderstanding, despite Qatari claims they will take a patient and relaxed approach?\nAt least one thing has become clear. This World Cup will not only be played on Qatar\u2019s turf, but by its rules too."

                    "body": "THE TIMES, THEY ARE A-CHANGIN\u2019\nWe\u2019re old enough to remember when Marathon became Snickers in the UK. It was 1990 and everyone kicked off about it. The change would have happened earlier but apparently company suits feared Snickers sounded too much like knickers so repressed Brits would be too flushed in the cheeks to buy it. Anyway, the thing that really bothered the corner shop-bothering folk was whether nougat, peanuts, chocolate and caramel could still taste the same with a different name. BA Baracus seemed to think so. You see, Mars could afford to hire Mr T to give their product the big sell by getting him to reassure worried consumers by the medium of pointing and shouting loudly at them that they\u2019re fools if they didn\u2019t like it. At Fiv \u2026 sorry, Football Daily Towers, we\u2019ve got, erm, let\u2019s see, um \u2026 \u201cHello? Hello? Uncle? Granny? Anybody?!\u201d Is it cold in here?\nAnyway, we can tell you where it isn\u2019t cold. Doha. It\u2019s 32C and sizzling as teams and journalists descend on the desert in mid-November for this completely normal and in-no-way egregious Human Rights World Cup. England were greeted at their team hotel by a crowd of enthusiastic expat Indians singing \u201cThree Lions\u201d. There were accusations that they weren\u2019t proper England fans \u2013 presumably because not one of them had a lit flare stuck up their backside or was ostentatiously hoovering up marching powder off the back of their hand while stood on a phone box. But with searingly witty new ditties such as \u201cPickford is our super keeper\u201d being belted out, perhaps these newly-discovered supporters should be embraced.\nThe Qatar [HR] World Cup Supreme Committee denied they were \u201cfake\u201d fans. \u201cWe thoroughly reject these assertions, which are both disappointing and unsurprising,\u201d blathered a statement. Much like Snickers over three decades ago, this tournament is hard to get our simple head around. Who knows what\u2019s legit any more? We already know, there really are \u201cpaid\u201d England fans in Doha. How\u2019s your bank balance, David? And, of course, the 40 supporters being given free flights and a \u00a360-a-day spend to \u201cstand up, sing the song/chant, wave your flags\u201d and play the Great Escape on a trumpet repeatedly for the cause which, let\u2019s be clear, is to polish the Gulf nation state\u2019s image.\n\nOne thing we can say for certain is that getting stuck into a mood-enhancer will be a costly and perhaps soul-crushing business. It will cost \u00a312 for just less than a pint of Budweiser. Budweiser, for heaven\u2019s sake! Can you taste the joy? Well, you might if you can find the right place and time to buy it. The owner of the \u201cKing of Beers\u201d grovelled that it was trying to deliver \u201cthe best possible consumer experience under the new circumstances\u201d after being told to move its stalls to less visible spots outside stadiums by the Supreme Committee, which confirmed there will be specific \u201cpouring times\u201d and a limit of four units per person. So good luck getting a hangover, then. Mind you, with reports of journalists being harassed on the streets already, and campaigners saying that gay Qataris are being physically abused then recruited as agents to track down other LGBTQ+ citizens, it is most likely that the game itself is the one left with the shakes when this dystopian chapter in football\u2019s history ends.\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\n\u201cWhy are we so competitive? Because they teach us to be. Because pitches exist, everywhere. In every neighbourhood, every place, however deprived. Wherever there\u2019s space to kick a ball, there\u2019s a game. That competitiveness demanded as a professional is already there: you\u2019ve been doing it all your life, every day, in the rain, any surface, playing barefoot, breaking a toe, wrapping it up and carrying on. I always say that in football it\u2019s not the same to play as to compete\u201d \u2013 Edinson Cavani\u2019s chat with Sid Lowe is well worth your time, on getting joy from nature, wanting to be a vet and why Uruguay succeed.\n\nFOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS\n\u201cMy congratulations to the marketing department on the rebranding of The Fiver to Football Daily. A change from a name suggesting something of universal value to one signalling a dreary, repetitive, never-ending stream of content. At least somebody working there knows what they\u2019re doing\u201d \u2013 Mathias Stigsgaard.\n\u201cFootball Daily? Weird Uncle Football Daily doesn\u2019t really have the same ring, does it? Is this going to be like when St James\u2019 Park was rebranded as the Sports Direct Soccerdome and everyone just ignored it and carried on as before?\u201d \u2013 Dom Ward.\n\u201cSurely Football Daily is the very opposite of STOP FOOTBALL?\u201d \u2013 David Maddock.\n\u201cHaving followed David Squires\u2019s series in the run-up to HRWC, I must admit I went from tsk, tsking over the plight of the workers to at least wondering if I should even watch the spectacle. But being a weak and spineless sort, I knew I\u2019d eventually relent \u2026 it\u2019s the (HR) World Cup after all. But after his final part yesterday, I now know I am done with it. So thank you to Squires, for helping me grow a spine. RIP Rupchandra Rumba and all the rest of your departed colleagues\u201d \u2013 Mike Fichtner.\n\u201cAs a consultant in orthopaedic and trauma surgery, I can reassure Adam Forde (yesterday\u2019s letters) that I am well versed in the myriad ways in which a bone can twang, pop, snap, crack and doink. Or maybe that\u2019s now two reputations in tatters?\u201d \u2013 Dan Westacott.\nSend your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet Football Daily via @guardian_sport.

Ronaldo\u2019s position at United is considered untenable after saying in an interview that he felt \u201cbetrayed\u201d and that the Glazer family do not care about the club. The 37-year-old forward also said he has no respect for the manager, Erik ten Hag, and singled out two former United teammates, Wayne Rooney and Gary Neville, after they criticised him.  But a person with knowledge of the situation told the Associated Press on Tuesday that Glazer will have the final say on any decision to sell the forward and it will be up to Ronaldo\u2019s agent Jorge Mendes to present potential clubs willing to buy him. The source also said United\u2019s hierarchy has backed Ten Hag\u2019s handling of the player and were fully supportive of his decision to drop Ronaldo from the squad and order him to train away from the first team after the Portugal star refused to come on as a substitute against Tottenham last month. For the Premier League match against Fulham on Sunday, Ronaldo was left out of United\u2019s squad for a second game in a row after the club said he had an unspecified illness. But he trained with Portugal\u2019s national team on Tuesday as they began preparations for the World Cup in Qatar. There was widespread speculation about Ronaldo leaving United even before the season started, but a potential exit is being complicated by the limited number of clubs that can afford to meet his reported salary of around \u00a3500,000 per week.  Ronaldo has six months remaining on his contract, and United\u2019s lawyers are reviewing footage of his interview to determine the club\u2019s legal position, the person with knowledge of the situation said.  In the excerpts of the interview that were released on Sunday evening, Ronaldo is heavily critical of Ten Hag, the owning Glazer family and the club in general. \u201cI don\u2019t have respect for [Ten Hag] because he doesn\u2019t show respect for me,\u201d Ronaldo told the interviewer Piers Morgan. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have respect for me, I\u2019m never going to have respect for you.\u201d United officials have yet to see the full interview and had no knowledge that it had been conducted before excerpts started to circulate on Sunday. \u201cThe club will consider its response after the full facts have been established,\u201d United said. \u201cOur focus remains on preparing for the second half of the season and continuing the momentum, belief and togetherness being built among the players, manager, staff and fans.\u201d"

The 29-year-old starred for the Atlas Lions in Qatar as they became the first African side to reach the semi-finals of the World Cup, despite his barely featuring for his club in the Premier League this season. Ziyech has played just 148 minutes so far for Chelsea and made his only start of the campaign under the previous manager, Thomas Tuchel, back in August, having been linked with a move away from Stamford Bridge in the summer. But while Potter said he had been in touch with the former Ajax forward, he warned that Ziyech would have to be patient for his opportunity with so much competition in Chelsea\u2019s squad. \u201cWe know his qualities, we like him as a player, he plays between the lines with fantastic quality as we saw in the World Cup,\u201d said Potter. \u201cAt Chelsea there are always good players who aren\u2019t in the starting XI and have to be patient. I was delighted for him, kept in touch with him over the World Cup. Delighted for him that he got the game-time, delighted for him that he helped his team, he\u2019s a good guy and he\u2019s got quality.\u201d  Chelsea signed off before the World Cup with three successive defeats to leave them in eighth and Potter is hoping to see quick improvements from his side. Yet with Ziyech and Croatia\u2019s Mateo Kovacic the only players from the club\u2019s 12-strong contingent who were in Qatar still to return, he said it could take a while before the tournament\u2019s ultimate impact is revealed. \u201cWe\u2019ve given all the guys who have been in the World Cup some time off, so they\u2019ve had a bit of a break, time with their families,\u201d Potter said. \u201cObviously it\u2019s not so easy to get the balance right. We\u2019re all learning because it\u2019s never happened before. So we don\u2019t know how that\u2019s going to go. I think you\u2019ve got to constantly evaluate the players and assess. \u201cBecause you might get two or three months down the line and think: \u2018Hang on a minute, we need to do something here, just to refresh, because we don\u2019t know how that\u2019s going to look like, in the future, long term, the effects of a World Cup.\u2019\u201d"

                    "body": "\u201cEngland can win it,\u201d says Gary Lineker of this year\u2019s World Cup. \u201cWe need luck, we need breaks, we need all our players to find their form but we\u2019ve got a lot of exciting young players. I think we\u2019ll be competitive and I think we\u2019ll be competitive in every tournament we play now. In fact, I think we\u2019re going to have fun with England for the next 10, 12 years.\u201d\nLineker remains the ultimate football enthusiast. To talk with the 61-year-old about an event he describes as \u201cthe biggest thing going\u201d is to rekindle an unfamiliar feeling, that of excitement for a tournament that has given off more bad vibes than it is possible to count. He uses language stronger than the Guardian will publish to describe the process that ended with Qatar becoming host, says \u201cwe are stuck with it\u201d and promises the BBC\u2019s opening night of coverage will be akin to \u201ca mini-Panorama\u201d. But he is supportive of Gareth Southgate, excited for Lionel Messi and ready to back Brazil.\n\nThat Lineker has reasons to retain affection for Fifa\u2019s quadrennial jamboree is self-evident: he is indelibly associated with some of the tournament\u2019s most abiding moments. His hat-trick in Monterrey against Poland and the odds, the hand of God and the greatest goal of all time (he scored the consolation), the Golden Boot and a reprisal of that form four years later to take England to the edge of a World Cup final \u2013 \u201chave a word\u201d and all; it adds up. Lineker has done as much for the World Cup as it has done for him which, he acknowledges, is a lot.\n\u201cFinishing with the Golden Boot in Mexico, six goals, top scorer, it changed my life,\u201d he says. \u201cI was having a decent career, I was scoring lots of goals for first Leicester and then Everton, but to do it in the World Cup catapults you onto a global stage. From being only recognised in a few places in England I was now known everywhere I went.\u201d\nIf 86 was personally transformative, Italia 90 went further becoming a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d for football in this country, he says. \u201cPolitically it was a really difficult time for the country: there was concerns over hooligans travelling, Thatcher was talking about whether we should go or not. But we went and I think we then changed the perception of the sport. It wasn\u2019t just a working man\u2019s sport any more. Women were starting to get interested in football, the middle classes were starting to get interested in football, it was perhaps the seminal moment. After that we had the Taylor Report, then along came the Premier League and all of a sudden football was a better place.\u201d\n\nTwenty-eight years later and another transference of energy from an England football team to the country at large occurred. After decades of disappointment, decadence and, ultimately, disconnect, Gareth Southgate led England\u2019s men\u2019s team to their third World Cup semi-final with a group that lacked stardust but won the affection of supporters. This, in turn, led to the England coach and his players becoming more engaged in the national conversation than the generations that had preceded them. They spoke about things that mattered to them and made the case for change. Their decision to take the knee before matches at 2021\u2019s European Championship saw them win the moral argument for protesting against racial inequality over the government of the day.\nPlayers\u2019 advocacy has consistently been met with criticism, and now the same individuals are under pressure to protest against the World Cup in Qatar. Lineker, whose political interventions on Twitter have earned him an army of critics, understands the bind they are in.\n\u201cPlayers that speak out will be told to stick to football, players that don\u2019t speak out will be told to speak out,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t generally win as a footballer in these circumstances and a lot is expected of what are very young men. They earn huge amounts of money these days and often people don\u2019t like that, but nobody seems to say anything about singers or F1 drivers. Most of the players around the England squad \u2013 Gareth is great around this as well \u2013 they do say the right things and I think they\u2019ve represented our country really well.\u201d\n\nLineker has occasionally \u2013 and notably \u2013 been known to show the edge of his tongue towards Southgate, being critical of the England manager\u2019s conservative approach to tournament competition. After a 1-0 Nations League defeat by Italy in September, he tweeted: \u201cI think Gareth Southgate\u2019s tactical master plan of not giving us any hope in order not to kill us is working beautifully thus far.\u201d\nIn person, the BBC man and co-host with Cesc F\u00e0bregas of a new World Cup podcast is more diplomatic and makes sure to be clear as to what he deems to be the baseline when it comes to the England manager. \u201cI\u2019ve put my views in there,\u201d he says, \u201c[but] I\u2019m a strong supporter of Gareth and I think whatever happens he has absolutely earned the right to succeed or fail in this World Cup. He\u2019s taken us to a semi-final of the World Cup, a final of the European championships. I would play more adventurously because I\u2019m a striker, [but] history tells us that you probably need a degree of pragmatism to win the World Cup. I understand completely how difficult and thankless a task he\u2019s got \u2026 unless he wins the thing.\u201d\n\nLineker\u2019s favourites for the tournament are Brazil, both the most successful World Cup nation and a country that hasn\u2019t seen success for two decades. \u201cIt\u2019s been 20 years since a South American team won the World Cup and if you asked me to put my head on the block and say you\u2019ve to pick someone I think I\u2019d probably pick Brazil, slightly ahead of Argentina,\u201d he says.\nThe logic of a stacked squad leads him to plump for the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o, ahead of the individual genius of the man he calls the GOAT, Lionel Messi. The admiration Lineker has for his fellow sporting great is charming and another marker of his boy scout enthusiasm. Lineker says the 35-year-old doesn\u2019t need a World Cup title to prove his greatness, but then \u201cit would probably put any argument anyone has ever had to bed\u201d so, \u201cin that sense, probably he does\u201d.\nMessi is in great form with PSG and playing in a system that suits him under Lionel Scaloni for Argentina, and Lineker says a desert triumph for the diminutive No 10 would be a fitting accolade late in his career. But as someone who has been there and been witness to much more World Cup history, Lineker is aware of the fine lines between sporting death and glory.\n\u201cPeople talk about how Maradona must be better because he won the World Cup; well, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s quite the way you should judge things,\u201d Lineker says. \u201cFor example Maradona sticks Burruchaga through against Germany late on, Burruchaga finishes [the third goal in Argentina\u2019s 3-2 victory in the 86 final]. Messi sticks through Higua\u00edn, he goes through, misses [against Germany in a 1-0 final defeat in 2014]. If Higua\u00edn scores that, the debate is already gone. What I\u2019m trying to say is: the greatest player in the world still needs a team.\u201d\nHow to Win a World Cup with Gary Lineker and Cesc F\u00e0bregas is available to listen to on Audible"

                    "body": "The World Cup has left us with two images of Lionel Messi. One is of him in his Argentinian team shirt, holding up the trophy. The other is of the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, putting the traditional Arab men\u2019s cloak, the black bisht, round Messi, just before he receives the trophy. The second image showed the rich state, which had bought the World Cup, rubbing in the world\u2019s noses in it. It should always be an indelible reminder us of what happens when sports organisations give in to the power of money. But the other image tells a story we can all associate with. In a final that ranks as the greatest ever, the greatest player finally wins the one trophy missing from his collection and joins the pantheon of the game\u2019s legends, Pel\u00e9 and Maradona. The climaxing of the competition reminded us that football can still produce magic, mystery and enthralling drama, and provide the most unexpected twists and turns that uplift us, and, for a few brief hours, make us connect us with strangers. I first realised this in an east London pub, on the first Saturday of the tournament. Until then the World Cup had been overshadowed by the not unexpected, but nevertheless sad realisation that the sceptics were right. Far from Qatar being magically transformed into a place where migrant labourers suddenly started getting justice and LGBT rights were respected, we had to accept Qatar\u2019s ways. Harry Kane was prevented from wearing a \u201cOne Love\u201d armband, having been threatened with bookings that would have jeopardised their involvement in the tournament and the fortunes of their teams. It was against this background that I had gone to the pub to celebrate my niece\u2019s birthday, only to find that all the television screens were showing Argentina playing Mexico. Surprisingly Argentina had been beaten by Saudi Arabia in their opening game. Another defeat would have meant almost certain elimination, ending all hopes of Messi fulfilling his great dream.  For an hour, as Mexico dominated, it seemed that was just what might have happened. Then Messi, receiving a pass from just outside the box, directed a shot with such precision and delicacy that he seemed to be caressing the ball past the diving goalkeeper. I had seen him do it often but nevertheless it evoked wonder. In the pub I was suddenly part of a community, all of whom had one shared objective \u2013 for Messi to succeed. Most of us had never met, and will probably never meet again. In the weeks that followed, Messi would do this often as he showcased his bewitching skills, sometimes suggesting he had extrasensory perception. And, on Sunday night, as he lifted the trophy, a wave of happiness for him and his country swept over me. This is despite Argentina being a country I hardly know. I have always been in love with the football of their greatest rival, Brazil, and have savoured Argentinian defeats. Perhaps the World Cup was never going to change Qatar. But then there are signs that we may look back and see it as the place where the World Cup started to change into becoming a truly global event. In the near century of this competition, Europe and South America, where so many people are of European descent, have been the only two continents to win the trophy. The rest of the world was invited but never had a chance to sit at the top table. Then Morocco emerged. Its impact hit me one evening at Piccadilly Circus. Tourists admiring the Christmas lights and shoppers laden with their presents were suddenly surrounded by cars honking and streams of people draped in a flag I could not recognise. A friend who was passing by said, \u201cIt is the Spanish supporters celebrating winning.\u201d In fact it was the Moroccan supporters, whose team had just beaten Spain, one of their old colonial masters. Morocco would fall to another former colonial master, France, but became the first team from Africa to reach the semi-final. This suggested that we may be seeing a quite profound change in international football.  Unlike in my youth, when they meant discovering players from different lands, today\u2019s World Cups are essentially contests between players from European clubs who know each other well and often play for the same team. When Kane took his penalties for England against France, he faced Hugo Lloris, his captain at Tottenham. The final developed into a contest between Messi and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, teammates at Paris Saint-Germain. It can be a wonderful \u201cplay within a play\u201d, but the thrill of exploring the unknown has gone. Morocco held out the hope that football\u2019s outsiders may finally aspire to the top table. But even as this new world finally emerges, the tragedy is that Fifa will not change. These self-appointed guardians of the game, who for decades have feasted on venality, continue to make promises they know they cannot fulfil, and instead use the wonders of Messi and others to validate themselves. The only consolation is that, for nearly four weeks, the world\u2019s footballers produced moments we will savour long after the image of Messi wearing a bisht is consigned to history.

However, Beckham appeared in no doubt as to how much progress the country had made.\n\n\u201cQatar dreamed of bringing the World Cup to a place that it had never been before, but that it wouldn\u2019t be enough just to achieve things on the pitch,\u201d he said. \u201cThe pitch would be a platform for progress.\u201d\nHe also said: \u201cDreams can come true. That is why you are here. You share Generation Amazing\u2019s twin passions for the game of football and for making the world a more tolerant and inclusive place.\u201d\nBeckham has been increasingly criticised by LGBTQ+ groups, with Di Cunningham, co-founder of the Three Lions Pride group, last week saying he should no longer be considered a great ally because of his paid ambassador role.\nHowever, Beckham said Qatar and its ambassadors were changing lives for the better. \u201cEvery one of the great players I was lucky enough to play with started exactly the same way,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a back garden, park, or a street outside their home with just a ball and an imagination that they dared to let run wild.\n\u201cAlmost two decades ago a small group of football lovers from Qatar had an equally fantastic dream: that they could bring the greatest football show on earth to their home country and to the Middle East for the very first time.\n\u201cAnd now we are here. Because when dreams are harnessed and mixed with dedication and hard work, they are no longer dreams. They become reality.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cI want to say to all of you, \u2018today is your day to dream\u2019. Because there are no limits to what you and your teammates can achieve in our beautiful game.\n\u201cEven before this festival kicks off, more than a million lives have been touched to create an inspirational global community of coaches, educators and new young leaders. It all began as a dream. That is now yours. So please be inspired and pass it on.\u201d"

The match will happen Sunday morning Australia time. \nArgentina supremo Lionel Messi has said \u201cAustralia is going to be very difficult\u201d, though the Socceroos will enjoy underdog status for the match. \nLive viewing sites will be set up in Sydney and Adelaide for Sunday morning\u2019s match, the respective premiers have announced, bowing to pressure over questions as to why Federation Square appeared to be the only live site showing Socceroos World Cup matches in an Australian capital city. \nSocceroos fans celebrated on the streets of Melbourne and Sydney in the early hours of Thursday morning, as the team surprised the world to book Australia\u2019s place in the knockout stages of the World Cup for just the second time in the tournament\u2019s history. \n\nI\u2019ll leave you with Guardian Australia\u2019s deputy sports editor' Emma Kemp\u2019s latest despatch from Doha here\n\n\n\n\n 11.24pm  \nPerrottet announces live site for Argentina match\n\nThe New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, has promised to set up an \u201cawesome\u201d live viewing site for the next Socceroos World Cup game. \nHe flagged the Sydney Opera House as a probable venue but said he would confirm later in the week. \nSpeaking at a press conference in North Sydney, he said: \n\nWe\u2019re going to have a great live site. It\u2019s going to be the best in the country because this is the best city in the world, so it\u2019s going to be awesome. \n\nHe did not know why a live site was not in place for the first games.\nPerrottet did not stay up to watch the Australian victory on Thursday morning but said he would make sure to watch the next game. \n\n\n\n 11.22pm  \n\nSocceroos fans in London:\n\n\n\n\n 11.17pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 11.10pm  \n\nJournalist Daniel Garb from Doha:\n\n\n\n\n 11.03pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 10.58pm  \n\nGood news for Socceroos fans in Adelaide:\nPremier Peter Malinauskas has announced a live site at Adelaide Oval will screen the round of 16 match against Argentina. \n\nAll eyes on you, Dominic Perrottet, Annastacia Palaszczuk et al. \n\n\n\n 10.44pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 10.33pm  \n\n\u2018Now these guys are heroes\u2019: Socceroos bound into last-16 date with Argentina\nMathew Leckie\u2019s goal sank Denmark in a 1-0 win as Australia finished second in their group \u2013 now Lionel Messi\u2019s side await in this Qatar odyssey\nRead Emma Kemp\u2019s latest despatch from Doha:\n\n\n\n\n 10.22pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 10.11pm  \nMessi: \"Australia is going to be very difficult\"\n\nArgentina supremo Lionel Messi is talking up the Socceroos\u2019 chances ahead of their knockout round clash.\n\nIs it that much of a stretch to call Australia and Argentina traditional rivals? Those with memories of the glory days of Oceania will remember the Socceroos\u2019 World Cup qualification playoff losses to Argentina.\nFor some of Argentina\u2019s players, the fixture is steeped in family history. Let us not forget that Argentina\u2019s Alexis Mac Allister will be following in his father Carlos\u2019 footsteps if he lines up against the Socceroos on Sunday morning Australia time.\nThe elder Mac Allister was part of the Argentina team that drew 1-1 with Australia in the first leg of a 1993 World Cup qualification play off that famously saw Diego Maradona play at the Sydney Football Stadium.\nLet\u2019s hope Alexis is not out for revenge!\n\nUpdated at 10.37pm GMT\n\n\n 10.00pm  \n\nUnion chief Sally McManus channeling Bob Hawke this morning:\n\n\n\n\n 9.51pm  \n\nSocceroo Jackson Irvine has praised the team chemistry as a factor in their historic progression to the World Cup knockout stages where Australia will face Argentina.\nIrvine, speaking to ABC news from Doha, said he and fellow teammates found their achievement \u201ca bit overwhelming\u201d.\nHe said:\n\n\u201cObviously emotions were running super high straight after the game and trying to kind of grasp what we have just kind of achieved. But immediately brought back down to earth by the prospect of a last 16 game in a couple of days.\nFor us as a group here, the dynamic that we have built, the environment we have, that we have curated over the last few years, we got such strong belief in each other, such a great mentality, and even after, you know, the first game, after what was a tough night, we have just bounced back and come back stronger and the individual displays that we have seen have been just so immense physically and mentally the focus in big moments\nObviously I can\u2019t speak high enough of every person involved in this camp from staff through all the players, everyone has been top notch.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n 9.49pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 9.26pm  \nCalls for live sites for Argentina match\n\nThere are growing calls for live sites to be set up in Sydney and other capital cities to screen the Socceroos\u2019 upcoming knockout match against Argentina, as football fans across the country react, likely with jealousy, to the scenes captured at Melbourne\u2019s Federation Square this morning.\n\nA petition is already circulating for a live site in Sydney.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.38pm GMT\n\n\n 9.16pm  \n\n\u201cUnbelievable\u201d: Socceroos fans outside Al Janoub Stadium in Doha following the 1-0 victory over Denmark.\n\n\n\n\n 9.12pm  \n\nWe\u2019ve included scenes of fans celebrating in Melbourne and Sydney in an earlier post in this blog, though fans were up and at it across the country:\nThis, from Adelaide this morning:\n\n\n\n\n 9.08pm  \n\nFor those just tuning in:\n\n\n\n\n 9.04pm  \n\nMost newspapers would have had to have gone to print well before the Socceroos\u2019 victory, but over in the West the news has made the front page of the late edition of the West Australian. Trademark pun included. \n\n\n\n\n 8.56pm  \nSocceroos to play Argentina in knockout stages\n\nArgentina have defeated Poland 2-0, securing their place at the top of group C and setting up a showdown with Graham Arnold\u2019s Socceroos. \nThe round of 16 knockout match will happen early on Sunday in Australia (6am AEDT). \nWhile the Socceroos will be underdogs against Argentina, the side that includes Lionel Messi has dropped points already this campaign, losing to Saudi Arabia in their opening match.\n\n\n\n 8.51pm  \n\nPictures of fans celebrating this morning are still filtering through, and you really could look at this for days. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n 8.43pm  \n\nFor those playing along at home, the Socceroos set a handful of records in their victory over Denmark this morning: \nThis World Cup is the first time Australia has ever won two matches at any edition of the tournament. \nNot only that, it is the first time the Socceroos have scored a goal in three games at a World Cup finals. All those goals have come from open play.\nIt\u2019s also the first time Australia has kept two clean sheets at a world cup tournament. (Our clean sheet in the Tunisia match was in fact Australia\u2019s first clean sheet at a World Cup since we drew 0-0 with Chile in 1974). \n\n\n\n 8.38pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 8.29pm  \n\nIt\u2019s looking very much like the Socceroos will be playing Argentina in their round of 16 knockout stage match on Sunday morning Australia time. \nArgentina has just gone up 2-0 against Poland, and they\u2019re now very much favourites to win group C. \n\n\n\n 8.19pm  \n\n\u201cI truly believe that the Socceroos are the team that unite the country\u201d, said Graham Arnold, vindicated. \u201cIf the cricket team get to the final of the World Cup you don\u2019t get scenes like tonight. You don\u2019t see the squares like they are tonight, and not with the rugby union or rugby league either. I\u2019m just so proud and happy. This is what World Cups are for.\u201d\nRead more from Paul MacInnes at Al Janoub Stadium:\n\n\n\n\n 8.17pm  \n\nMexico are now 2-0 up in that match\n\n\n\n 8.13pm  \n\nMexico have just taken the lead against Saudi Arabia in group C\u2019s other match. \nIn terms of what this means for the Socceroos, we\u2019re still on track to play Argentina in our next match. \nSaudi Arabia are still a chance to top the group and face Australia, however with Argentina\u2019s goal and now Mexico going ahead, that is looking far less likely. \nYou can follow the Guardian\u2019s live blog of the Saudi Arabia-Mexico match here:\n\n\n\n\n 8.09pm  \n\nArgentina take lead, on track to play Australia\nAlexis Mac Allister has just put Argentina up 1-0 in their match against Poland, scoring 68 seconds into the second half. \nThat goal takes Argentina to top spot in the live standings of group C, with Saudi Arabia and Mexico still at 0-0. \nIf those results stand, Argentina will win their group, and play the Socceroos on Sunday morning Australia time. \nYou can follow that match on the Guardian\u2019s live blog here:\n\n\n\n\n 8.05pm  \n\nThe Socceroos\u2019 hero in Doha, goalscorer Mathew Leckie, spoke after the match:\n\nI\u2019m proud, exhausted, everything really. It\u2019s hard to describe the emotions right now. We always knew we could do it as a group. We had our doubters but our spirit, our belief, our work ethic and how close we are as a group shows on the pitch. The last 15, 20 minutes we battled until the end. It didn\u2019t matter what they threw at us, we weren\u2019t conceding. We\u2019ll make the most of it tonight, but then it\u2019s all about recovery.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 8.02pm  \n\nAfter match, Socceroos coach Graham Arnold has said his team will avoid celebrating and social media as they prepare for their upcoming round of 16 match. \nArnold said:\n\nI\u2019m just so proud of the effort by the boys. A short turnaround, but their effort was incredible. A lot of belief. A lot of hard work. These boys came in with a great mindset. We\u2019ve been working on this for four-and-a-half years, and I could see in their eyes they were ready tonight. \nNo celebrations tonight. That\u2019s why we won after a great win against Tunisia. No celebrations, no emotion, sleep, no social media.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n 7.58pm  \n\nAustralia\u2019s historic World Cup win over Denmark sparked wild celebrations across the country in the early hours of the morning as the team progressed to the knockout stages of the finals for only the second time.\nRead more:\n\n\n\n\n 7.55pm  \n\nCalls for public holiday\nAdmittedly these calls are coming from the football establishment, but still, surely something for Anthony Albanese to consider. \n\n\n\n\n\n 7.54pm  \n\nAt half time in the group C games, it\u2019s Poland 0-0 Argentina and Saudi Arabia 0-0 Mexico. \nIf these results hold, Poland will top the group, and play the Socceroos on Sunday morning Australia time. \n\n\n\n 7.49pm  \n\nMore pictures of Australians celebrating this morning\u2019s win. \n\n\n\n\n\n 7.41pm  \n\nOver in the Poland v Argentina match, Lionel Messi has just had a penalty sensationally saved by Polish keeper Wojciech Szczesny.\nAt the 41st minute mark, it\u2019s still Poland 0-0 Argentina.

                    "body": "World leaders must not let the World Cup in Qatar distract them from a simultaneous nature summit, or they face being embarrassed by the outcome, the UN\u2019s biodiversity chief has warned. This December, delegates will travel to Montreal, Canada, for the UN biodiversity conference, known as Cop15, to negotiate a new set of global goals for nature over the next decade after two years of delays, with the final agreement due to be reached on the eve of the World Cup final on 18 December. Presidents and prime ministers routinely attend the World Cup, but Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, executive secretary of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, has urged world leaders to remain focused on the nature negotiations, which environmental organisations have warned are in crisis due to the lack of engagement by governments. Cop15 will start just two weeks after the end of the climate-focused Cop27 in Egypt, where countries are expected to announce stronger commitments to limit global heating to 1.5C (2.7F) above pre-industrial levels. The talks in Sharm el-Sheikh are likely to have a significant impact on the tone of the biodiversity summit. \u201cAll leaders will have to think twice [about the clash between Cop15 and the World Cup]. You can go to the World Cup but what does it mean if there\u2019s no life beyond that when you come back?\u201d said Mrema. \u201cIf they go to Qatar, then they should leave behind appropriate instructions,\u201d she added. \u201cOtherwise they will be embarrassed.\u201d Both climate and biodiversity negotiations have seen significant divisions between the global north and south. During two weeks of talks in Nairobi last month, countries struggled to make progress on the final text, and there was particular disagreement over money to fund the draft targets, implementation of the agreement and \u201cbiopiracy\u201d. Speaking to the Guardian from the UN ocean conference in Lisbon, Mrema acknowledged that progress had been slow and said input from governments in the negotiations, which are largely technical at this stage, was required to break the deadlock on big issues. \u201cWe really need a political push. Leaders are talking of a transformative, ambitious agreement. If negotiations continue this way, we will probably end up with a framework but it probably won\u2019t be ambitious, innovative or what is expected to really change the loss of biodiversity,\u201d she said. At the G7 last week, the Canadian government said both Boris Johnson and Emmanuel Macron had discussed Cop15 in meetings with the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau.  Despite being hosted in Montreal, the summit will remain under the presidency of China, having been moved from Kunming after the country\u2019s zero-Covid policy made hosting it there impossible. Mrema said the governments would work together to deliver a Chinese Cop15 on Canadian soil.  \u201cCanada will lead in terms of ensuring we find a suitable conference venue and have all the facilities in place. But China will continue to lead the substance of the negotiations under their presidency,\u201d she said. Cop15 begins in Montreal on 5 December, with another round of negotiations scheduled before then in an attempt to break the deadlock on major issues in the agreement. The once-a decade nature agreement is scheduled for completion on the final day, 17 December, with attendance from ministers expected in the days leading up to this.

                    "body": "A World Cup works always and everywhere. There is nothing like it \u2013 and it is a diverse event. Eleven men or women are actively involved on both sides, even up to 17 due to the new rule with substitutions. All continents take part and Sunday\u2019s finalists Argentina lost in Qatar to a country from Asia \u2013 Saudi Arabia \u2013 and almost had to go into extra time against Australia. Thanks to Morocco, Africa \u2013 alternatively Arabia \u2013 made it to the semi-finals for the first time.\nAt a tournament, the world negotiates how it wants to live together. The game provides material for discussions in all directions. Was the ball out before Japan\u2019s winning goal against Spain? Can offside be measured digitally, as technology optimists believe? Is the Palestine flag political and what does it say? Was the OneLove armband necessary? What signal does it send when Muslim athletes dance with and kiss their mothers in front of the world after victories?\n\nA World Cup writes stories above all on the pitch. The most dramatic match was the replay of the 1978 final between Argentina and the Netherlands. Lionel Messi was sneaking around until the genius initiated the lead with a pass.\nArgentina dominated from then, but when the Netherlands dropped the Ajax school for a good 20 minutes and unleashed the crowbar, things took an unexpected turn. Argentina were now feeling the downside of their passionate and nationally proud style: fearing the concession of a 2-0 lead, they lost control and risked sending-offs. Had they not recovered their poise in extra time, they would have been eliminated. In the end, they won on penalties.\nQatar has witnessed the resurgence of France\u2019s Antoine Griezmann. He won the World Cup in 2018, after which his club career floundered. In the meantime, he is once again directing his side\u2019s attacking play with strategic passes and the most precise crosses. He enjoys the respect of his teammates, whom he serves unpretentiously.\nThis is not least thanks to the best footballer among the 32 coaches. Didier Deschamps would be the first coach to defend his World Cup title. Great nations should be led by great footballers \u2013 or mature personalities. Orchestrating such an accumulation of talent is a job for people such as M\u00e1rio Zagallo or Franz Beckenbauer, who, like Deschamps, became world champions as players and coaches. To integrate a supernaturally gifted player such as Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, you need their wisdom.\nIt\u2019s the \u201cwe\u201d that counts in this team sport. However, this does not preclude the \u201cI\u201d from expressing itself freely, in very different ways. Luka Modric is still, at the age of 37, the perfect midfielder because he keeps the balance of his team. Wout Weghorst almost turned the game against Argentina with his simple but effective style and then amazed the world with a free-kick trick.\nThe collective is not a dogma; football, rooted in Europe, is not totalitarian. The rules are the same for everyone, they regulate togetherness. Football is the most attractive game in the world.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with football itself. But the people who govern, manage and market it are squandering the unrestricted joy of it. They forget that they are merely service providers for a common good.\nFifa\u2019s president, Gianni Infantino, is trusted with everything. Some fans are beginning to believe that technocrats in the VAR cellars are exerting a damaging influence when they decide on penalties or calculate in millimetres whether the ball was out. Obvious mistakes such as Frank Lampard\u2019s goal that was not spotted against Germany in the 2010 World Cup last 16 should be corrected. But AI suggests an absolute justice that can never exist. And if there is a human behind the mistake, as with the 1966 Wembley goal, that is much more acceptable than if technology is wrong.\n\nA World Cup would not be complete without surprise. Morocco let themselves be carried by their fans. You can hear in their voices why football is the people\u2019s sport. And the team are the most disciplined in the tournament, managing their resources ideally. This must be based on good coaching. Walid Regragui has done an excellent job of adapting his team to the successful playing culture of the Europeans.\nNorth African football contains the elements of Sacchi, Mourinho, Guardiola, 4-3-3, Premier League and rondo. This is also true of Tunisia, who beat France in the group stage.\nThe Arab region has its football culture, which could be reinforced with a World Cup. Morocco has applied to host five times. But Fifa passed them over and awarded the tournament to Qatar, where football is seen as a political instrument. Money rules the world. Those in charge of Fifa and Uefa have too often put individual gain above the common good. \n\nEurope\u2019s institutions must be defensible in these times. It is alleged that Qatar bribed high\u2011ranking MEPs to try to influence policy. However, self-interest is no longer the order of the day, but self-preservation and resilience.\nThe next big men\u2019s football tournament, Euro 2024, will take place in a democracy, in Germany. There, what Europe is all about, namely freedom, diversity and equality before the law, must be defended. They are also the values of football.\nPhilipp Lahm\u2019s column was produced in partnership with Oliver Fritsch at Zeit Online, the German online magazine, and is being published in several European countries"

                    "body": "It was an unremarkable type of goal \u2013 a header from just outside the six-yard box, neatly glanced low into the far corner. More notable than the finish was the identity of the scorer and what it might mean for the US men\u2019s national team as they play their last two games before the Qatar World Cup, starting with a friendly against Japan on Friday. Ricardo Pepi was named the MLS Young Player of the Year after scoring 13 times for FC Dallas in 2021. US head coach Gregg Berhalter had reason to be grateful for the teenager\u2019s lethal form last September when Pepi scored on his international debut and provided two assists as the Americans recovered from a 1-0 deficit to beat Honduras 4-1 in San Pedro Sula.  That was the US\u2019s third game in Concacaf qualifying. They only drew the first two and Berhalter\u2019s job security would have been the subject of intense scrutiny had they lost to the weakest team in the group. Instead, the US went on to beat Jamaica 2-0 in October and the Texan grabbed both goals in Austin to cement his status as an ascendent star. As Pepi jogged towards the corner flag to take the adulation of the crowd and his teammates after steering a cross low into the net in the 62nd minute, no one would have imagined that he would not celebrate again for nearly a year. Pepi\u2019s goal for FC Groningen against Sparta Rotterdam last Saturday ended an astonishing 30-match, 345-day scoreless streak for the striker. He joined Augsburg in January for a reported $20m-plus transfer fee but the drought continued and the Bundesliga side dispatched him to the Eredivisie last month on a season-long loan. The 19-year-old slid from indispensable to optional \u2013 he hasn\u2019t played for the US since March \u2013 but Berhalter called him into the squad for Friday\u2019s match against Japan in D\u00fcsseldorf and Tuesday\u2019s game with Saudi Arabia in Murcia even before the Groningen goal, citing a desire to boost the striker\u2019s confidence. It\u2019s not surprising Berhalter feels a sense of loyalty towards a player who had an important role in qualifying. His inclusion despite the barren run is also a reflection of the lack of proven high-calibre options at centre forward, which remains one of the biggest question marks in the line-up as Qatar looms. Jes\u00fas Ferreira of FC Dallas is the putative favorite to start when it matters. This year the 21-year-old has shown he is a prolific scorer who offers more in the build-up than Pepi. Josh Sargent is also in contention after a strong start to the season with Norwich City following a dismal 2021-22, though Berhalter will have to parse the extent to which the 22-year-old\u2019s improved performances are a result of lower-quality opponents after Norwich\u2019s relegation from the Premier League.  Since Jordan Pefok is in scoring form in the Bundesliga with Union Berlin, his omission from the roster signals that his World Cup prospects are remote, though Berhalter was keen to stress to reporters that \u201ca lot can happen between now and November 9\u201d. That\u2019s the date the US are planning to unveil the final roster, 12 days before they kick off against Wales. The US also face England and Iran in Group B. That\u2019s not just the usual hedging and caution from a coach who wants to keep all his options open, but an acknowledgement that this player pool, though young, has frequently been disrupted by health issues during his tenure. \u201cA lot can happen between the 9th and the [Fifa deadline of the] 14th,\u201d Berhalter added, a note that sounded more realistic than pessimistic given the US\u2019s injury history and the vagaries of an unprecedented winter World Cup. Forward Tim Weah, midfielder Yunus Musah and left back Antonee Robinson, who are sure to be on the plane to Qatar if fit, are injured and missing from the current squad. Goalkeeper Zack Steffen was also left out because of injury but played for Middlesbrough last Saturday. Berhalter will have to choose between Steffen, who\u2019s had some shaky moments this year but is playing regularly, albeit in the English second tier, or Matt Turner, a more solid performer who\u2019s a back-up for Arsenal and has only made one appearance this season. Another problem position is center back, but the next two games may not provide clarity as to who\u2019ll partner with Nashville\u2019s Walker Zimmerman in Qatar, since two leading contenders, Cameron Carter-Vickers (Celtic) and Chris Richards (Crystal Palace) are also sidelined. Not that this has opened the door for Benfica\u2019s John Brooks or Fulham\u2019s Tim Ream \u2013 veterans who are too slow for a coach who\u2019s shaping his team to be youthful and dynamic. So with two months before the start of the World Cup, the US\u2019s concluding warm-ups may be chiefly useful as strength tests against two other qualified nations, tactical rehearsals and establishing who\u2019s likely to fill reserve spots on the roster rather than giving Berhalter the opportunity to confirm the last three or four names on his definitive preferred starting XI. The next 180 minutes might at least give the coach a clearer idea of whether he prefers Gio Reyna or Brenden Aaronson as attacking midfielders/wingers. The most intriguing question of all, though, is whether Pepi is about to enjoy a perfectly-timed renaissance. There\u2019s only a small sample size for a player at the start of his career, but he did tend to score in clusters last year. If his long-awaited goal last weekend proves the first of many \u2013 or at least, some \u2013 then Berhalter may have a very welcome selection dilemma ahead."

                    "body": "A financial firm that operates billions of dollars in real estate properties around the world is facing new questions from the powerful chairman of the Senate finance committee about whether Qatar was secretly involved in the $1.2bn (\u00a31bn) rescue of a Fifth Avenue property owned by Jared Kushner\u2019s family while Kushner was serving in the White House.  Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat who leads the finance committee, has given the chief executive of Toronto-based Brookfield Asset Management until 24 October to answer a series of detailed questions about a 2018 deal in which Brookfield paid Kushner Companies for a 99-year lease on the family\u2019s marquee 666 Fifth Avenue property. When the deal was announced in August 2018, it was seen as the end of a drawn-out saga surrounding the property. The rescue, it was said in media reports, generated enough money for the Kushner family to pay $1.1bn (\u00a3970m) of debt on the building and buy out a partner. In a statement on Thursday, Wyden accused Brookfield of stonewalling his committee and refusing to answer questions about the transaction, including whether Brookfield \u201cintentionally misled\u201d the public when it said that \u201cno Qatar-linked entity\u201d had been involved in the deal. In fact, it has since been alleged by Wyden that Brookfield used a Qatari-backed fund \u2013 called Brookfield Property Partners \u2013 to fund the transaction. At the time of the deal, Wyden said, the Qatari Investment Authority was the fund\u2019s second largest investor. \u201cI remain deeply concerned that funding from a foreign government was involved in the rescue of a Kushner-owned property while Jared Kushner was employed as a senior White House official closely involved in the formulation of US policy towards the Middle East,\u201d Wyden said. \u201cThis is a serious issue, as federal criminal conflict of interest statutes for White House officials extend not only to matters affecting their own financial interests, but that of their direct relatives and spouses.\u201d Wyden also noted that Kushner was involved at the time in matters involving a diplomatic blockade against Qatar by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt. He pointed to recent testimony by the former secretary of state Rex Tillerson, who said Kushner frequently engaged with foreign officials in a manner that was inconsistent with the views of other US government officials. In the case of Qatar, Tillerson said, Kushner expressed support for the blockade despite opposition from the Departments of State and Defense. Kushner\u2019s investment fund, Affinity Partners, has recently secured a $2bn (\u00a31.7bn) investment from Saudi Arabia, which Wyden said raised additional questions about his communications with both Qatar and Saudi Arabia, and whether Kushner changed his stance on the Qatar blockade only after his family secured funding for the deal. A spokesperson for Brookfield did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Kushner could not immediately be reached for comment. In his letter, Wyden asked for a wide range of documents and correspondence in connection with the transaction. "

The big food-poisoning set piece is used to express disgust at the vapidity of these hyper-spoilt lives.\nSome have walked out in shock.

A Qatari government memo suggested Germany is in fact applying a racist trope, that Qatar\u2019s ruling family has been \u201csuffering from an unjust stereotype for decades\u201d.\nIt is not the first time this point has been made. As long ago as 2015 an editorial in the Al-Raya newspaper, a pro-government filter, raged against the \u201cracist campaign\u201d to undermine Qatar\u2019s World Cup, in this case the corruption findings around the Fifa bid process. The World Cup chief executive, Nasser Al Khater, also refused to rule out this idea in a recent interview with Sky Sports, noting, when asked, that criticism was \u201cpossibly\u201d racially motivated.\nQatar is not alone in taking this view. Two weeks ago an anonymous briefing linked to Manchester City suggested J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s comments about City\u2019s financial power were considered to be borderline xenophobic.\nOn the one hand this could be seen as smart PR. Qatar in particular is a serial employer of the kind of western public relations vessels who will see a checkmate move here. Chuck a little mud, blur the edges, toss your own online army a bone. Get out of that one, post\u2011colonial virtue signallers. And don\u2019t mention arms sales, historic slavery, or the Gulf war.\nOn the other hand this is also an entirely legitimate issue if those involved believe it to be true, and one that must be treated with sensitivity. Football\u2019s billionaire overclass, like the denizens of that vomit-strewn yacht, are people too.\nIt is also an interesting point in other ways. For a start it invites fair scrutiny of those making it. Plus there is the obvious response that to suggest concerns over corruption, intolerance and workers\u2019 deaths are driven by racism is to devalue and disrespect the racism that less empowered people routinely suffer. And that to do so for political gain is something straight out of the Trump script, the Putin manual, the entitled\u2011billionaire hissy\u2011fit playbook.\nSo what is the substance here? It is hard to see any actual evidence of xenophobia in Klopp\u2019s words. Klopp said \u201cnobody can compete with City\u201d on financial matters. Klopp said: \u201cNo matter what it costs, you just do it.\u201d Klopp said: \u201cThere are three clubs in world football who can do what they want financially. It\u2019s legal and everything, fine, but they can do what they want.\u201d\n\nThere is nothing here that isn\u2019t fair comment. It is the case that there are three nation-state clubs in Europe\u2019s top tiers, and all three happen to share a coastline. Perhaps Klopp could have offered balance by mentioning the wild lines of credit extended to certain members of \u201cthe cartel\u201d or the absurdity of Chelsea\u2019s rolling oligarch debt. But those clubs can still go bust. Whether it\u2019s a Gulf state or the Danish government buying your local rivals, this is a legitimate topic.\nIt has been impossible to dig any deeper into why City feel this was borderline xenophobic given the club\u2019s refusal to give further details or go on the record properly with such a serious accusation. City have refused to answer questions on the subject this week.\nSo it is just left hanging there, fed into the opinion matrix. And unsurprisingly the other place where this idea has taken root is on social media, which are buzzing with voices responding with commendable patriotism to unsympathetic Qatar news stories.\nSome of this could be induced. This week it emerged in the Netherlands that Qatar is paying at least 50 Dutch fans to travel to the World Cup next month, in return for signing a document committing to making \u201ca positive contribution\u201d. This ambassadorial role involves liking certain online posts and, most intriguingly, taking action against \u201coffensive comments\u201d from third parties.\nAnd no doubt this is all just part of the game now, an adjunct to more formalised types of reputation management. Fifa has in the past employed the American company Weber Shandwick, among many others, to manage its World Cup PR. Qatar is advised by the global giant Teneo. It is legitimate, in this company, to manage the narrative however your client sees fit.\nBut it is worth noting two things along the way. First, the company you\u2019re keeping. Vladimir Putin, for example, who has described Russia\u2019s ban from sporting competition as an act of racism. Or Sheikh Ahmad of Kuwait, one\u2011time president of the Olympic Council of Asia, who accused Qatar\u2019s critics of \u201cracist actions\u201d in 2014, and was convicted last year of fraud. Or indeed Sepp Blatter, who told delegates at the 2015 African congress attacks on the Qatar World Cup were \u201cracist\u201d, a reaction to revelations that would end with various criminal convictions.\nMore hopefully this kind of comment does at least open up the debate. No doubt workers in Abu Dhabi will welcome City\u2019s owners\u2019 concerns over racial profiling. Last year Amnesty International revealed police in the United Arab Emirates had seized 375 African migrant workers in the middle of the night and deported them without trial.\n\u201cThe authorities have brutalised hundreds of individuals on the basis of their skin colour, ill-treating them in detention, stripping them of their personal possessions and their dignity,\u201d Amnesty\u2019s report concludes. Which definitely sounds like borderline xenophobia.\n\nQatar has also arguably done itself a service by turning the spotlight on these issues. A recent report by the UN\u2019s special racism envoy voiced \u201cserious concerns of structural racial discrimination\u201d in Qatari society, and a \u201cde facto caste system based on national origin\u201d. These problems must now presumably be high on the agenda.\nNone of this means Qatar is necessarily wrong. There may well be a racist campaign to portray its working conditions or the criminalisation of homosexuality as bad things. Manchester City\u2019s owners can be the victims of genuine prejudice whatever the issues in the Emirates.\nThere is also a legitimate point that other nations are guilty of the same faults. The US got to stage the World Cup while deploying troops on almost every continent. Britain recently played host to both the Windrush scandal and the final of the European Championship.\nBut this is also a question of degree. The criticism of Qatar has come from human rights bodies, trade unions and left\u2011leaning voices. Is Amnesty racist? Is Antonio R\u00fcdiger racist? Is Unison racist? Are the only non\u2011racist people out there Adidas, McDonald\u2019s, Budweiser, Coca\u2011Cola and Visa, which have wisely kept their counsel on Qatar\u2019s World Cup?\nIt is a line that will be explored more often as the noise around Qatar 2022 reaches its peak; and an issue to be treated as more than just a shared bile-fest. Albeit with the proviso that such statements start to look cheap or vexatious without proper substance; and that there is a danger cries of discrimination from football\u2019s hyper\u2011rich powerbrokers might ring a little hollow to the less privileged, or sound like an unearned smear.\nThese are just some of the contortions to be unravelled before we get to the basic business of playing and watching football. Who knows, perhaps beyond the talk, the endless vomit of bluff and counter-accusation, there might even be the shadow of progress waiting to be made."

                    "body": "The most controversial World Cup ever? Mohammad al-Kuwari dismisses 12 years of international cynicism and scrutiny with a shrug. \u201cWe don\u2019t care that much,\u201d the Qatari national says from his office among the luminescent skyscrapers of Doha\u2019s palm-lined West Bay waterfront. \u201cThey say if you don\u2019t have enemies you\u2019re not successful. Every successful person has people jealous of them.\u201d With hours until arguably the world\u2019s biggest sporting event kicks off, Qatar is witnessing a spree of grand openings: new roads, restaurants, stadiums and theme parks, in addition to a brand new city, Lusail, erected in time to host the World Cup final. \u201cWe used to have malls, but now we have many malls, even malls I haven\u2019t been to yet,\u201d says Mohammad al-Qassabi, 22, a recent university graduate. More than a dozen interviews with Qataris over the past week have shed light on a society eager to welcome the world (\u201cThey\u2019ll see we\u2019re actually very nice people,\u201d al-Kuwari says) but a little anxious at its presence, counselling their children in the unfamiliar things they are about to see and hear.  \u201cWith my kids, for example, I\u2019m telling them: soon we will be seeing the people we always see outside of Qatar, inside of Qatar,\u201d says Reem al-Bader, who works in healthcare. \u201cWe will be going to matches, maybe some people will be sitting next to you. If you see them doing any weird actions, just ignore. Don\u2019t shout at them, don\u2019t disrespect anyone \u2013 they\u2019re our guests.\u201d Above all, though, Qataris say they are enraged at how one of the most important moments in their country\u2019s 51-year history is being portrayed by some western governments and the media. \u201cIt hurts me,\u201d says Shaikha al-Marri, a graphic designer living in Doha. \u201cAnd what hurts me the most is, it\u2019s coming from \u2013 what do they call themselves? Developed countries. Countries that lecture the world about tolerance, about peace.\u201d \u201cThe things the west is allowed to do, we\u2019re not allowed to do,\u201d says a businessman in the gas industry, who asked not to be named. \u201cWe\u2019re not allowed to be richer than them, we\u2019re not allowed to be smarter than them, we\u2019re not allowed to be more advanced. It is a way of staying ahead in the game.\u201d \u201cIt is no longer about Qataris,\u201d says Noora Fakhroo, who works in telecommunications. \u201cIf we fail, the Arab world will fail, and if we succeed it\u2019s a success story for everyone. The equation is like that now, especially with the attacks we are receiving.\u201d Qatar wanted the world\u2019s gaze. Instead, it has received its glare, in the form of critical media coverage of its conservative social laws, substandard conditions for low-wage workers and the circumstances surrounding its successful World Cup bid. But while the scrutiny of foreign governments and the media stings, increased visibility is precisely why Qatar wanted the tournament. The peninsula state has the second-largest proven natural gas reserves in the world, but those who see only its fabulous wealth can miss the country\u2019s deep sense of insecurity. Its citizens number fewer than 350,000, a fraction of the country\u2019s nearest neighbour, Saudi Arabia, which has long considered Qatar either rightfully part of its own territory, or a vassal state that should toe the Saudi line, says Paul Michael Brannagan, an international relations scholar who has co-authored a book on the 2022 World Cup. This threat is neither abstract, nor past: as recently as 2017, Riyadh led an effort by allied Gulf states to freeze out Qatar, brand it a supporter of terrorism and blockade its airspace and ports, offering relief only if Doha agreed to a set of demands that amounted to surrendering its independence. Qatar outlasted the campaign thanks to a decades-long strategy of building energy and security ties with larger countries, including the UK \u2013 which broke from the Trump administration to call for an end to the blockade \u2013 and by carefully raising its profile in the world as an international destination for ending wars, seeing art and watching sport.  \u201cFor small states like Qatar, their greatest hurdle is invisibility and survival, and they tend to be linked,\u201d Brannagan says. \u201cThe World Cup is really about, first and foremost, showcasing Qatar\u2019s sovereign independence and separating itself symbolically from Saudi Arabia. \u201cLong-term, it doesn\u2019t matter if the world has a negative perspective of Qatar now. Behind the scenes, this event is going to do so many things for the country that it couldn\u2019t have done without it.\u201d Embracing the world has bought Qatar some security, but it has also transformed its close-knit society at whiplash speed. \u201cWhen I was young, the community was very small, everyone knew each other,\u201d says Mubaraka al-Marri, 54, a businesswoman and social activist. \u201cLife was very quiet.\u201d Qatari women are subject to guardianship laws that give men control over who they marry, if they can work or study and whether they can leave the country. But many women are also eager to point out their rate of participation in the workforce has become the highest in the region, and that they now graduate from Qatar\u2019s best universities at far higher rates than men. \u201cWe did have tribal aspects that affected how women were treated, affected her rights,\u201d says Fakhroo. \u201c[But] when you walk into any workplace right now you\u2019ll see the majority are women who are working, and they\u2019re part of management. They\u2019re part of ministries and they\u2019re successful.\u201d For every opening, there has been pushback. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t afraid of change, they\u2019re afraid about their identity,\u201d says Mubaraka al-Marri. \u201cWe have values, we have traditions.\u201d She points to art exhibits in Doha that have sparked some outcry, including a recent show featuring the flamboyantly dressed British artist Daniel Lismore (\u201cWhy do we bring these strange people?\u201d) and fears among some that the widespread adoption of English is diluting the quality of young people\u2019s Arabic. \u201cWe have to be careful about what is coming into our society,\u201d she says. \u201cNot to accept everything because others accept it, especially just because westerners accept it \u2026 Why do they want us to be a copy of them?\u201d The World Cup has been a catalyst for faster, deeper changes, including to the country\u2019s notorious labour sector \u2013 too late for the at least 6,500 south Asian migrant workers estimated to have died in the country over the past decade. For many Qataris, the workers\u2019 issue is hazy and contested. Several pointed to Fifa\u2019s official count that just three people perished on construction sites for World Cup stadiums. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you, I don\u2019t know if there was a lot of deaths or injuries,\u201d says Aisha a-Maadeed, 28, an environmental activist. \u201cBecause you don\u2019t believe anything on social media or on the media or in the news.\u201d Under the supervision of the International Labour Organization, Qatar has made steps towards improving the system \u2013 with significant room for progress \u2013 despite the grumblings the reforms have sparked. \u201cThings have changed a lot in the last 15 years and any worker now has the freedom to change jobs,\u201d says al-Kuwari. \u201cIt\u2019s changed to the point where it feels like the opposite [\u2026] Imagine, you bring someone who\u2019s working for you, and you teach him and make him learn the job,\u201d he says. \u201cBefore, if he wanted to switch jobs he needed a no-objection letter. Now, he can leave you and go. And people are like, \u2018Fine. It\u2019s no problem\u2019.\u201d The prospect of gay and queer people being permitted to openly participate in festivities over the next month has been a harder sell, sparking consternation and homophobia within Qatar\u2019s raucous social media circles. Influencers have been among those trying to calm the public mood. \u201cFor a long time, [gay people] have been in our country,\u201d Mohammed al-Dosari, a popular Qatari personality, says in one video responding to the discontent. \u201cThey\u2019re already here. Both boys and girls. Does it change anything? Focus instead on looking after yourself, the people around you, your family, and trying to make sure this kind of thing doesn\u2019t reach them. \u201cThink about how you can change the ones who are coming,\u201d he adds. \u201cThat they see our traditions and how we live and maybe something will change in them. But if you carry on this way, nothing will change, in them or in you. The opposite: you\u2019ll make them hate you, hate the religion and hate the country. Try to change them [by your example], and if you can\u2019t change them, shut up.\u201d Qataris travel widely, but the prospect of encountering rowdy fan behaviour and public drunkenness at home \u2013 where it is harshly policed, but will be tolerated to some extent for the course of the tournament \u2013 is another bracing thought . \u201cI am concerned, but I\u2019m also expecting it,\u201d says Fakhroo. \u201cI\u2019m telling myself, \u2018Noora, stay realistic. This is happening\u2019 \u2026 My only concern is that my kids are attending some of the games, and making them aware that some of these things might happen in front of them \u2013 for them not to be shocked.\u201d The tournament has prompted careful conversations with her football-mad eldest son, aged nine, she adds. \u201cHe\u2019s seen it online and we\u2019ve spoken about it. He knows what\u2019s acceptable and not in our religion. He\u2019s aware of people being drunk and stuff like that. He\u2019s also aware of the LGBTQ community and how we don\u2019t get affected by them, and so on.\u201d For others, the arrival of the world\u2019s fans will mean more practical adaptations. \u201cBefore the World Cup, we could easily leave our cars open and go to the store and come back,\u201d says al-Qassabi. \u201cOr leave our laptops in a food court or restaurant and go and come back, or leave our front doors open.  \u201cBut during the World Cup we expect people from different backgrounds, different behaviours. So, we have to be more safe.\u201d Most say they are at ease with what is about to erupt in their city, reassured by a belief it is ultimately temporary. \u201cIt\u2019s like when you have a party,\u201d says Mubaraka al-Marri. \u201cYour house isn\u2019t used in the way you know, because there are people inside. But when they leave, you organise it again as you like.\u201d Shaikha, her daughter, agrees: \u201cJanuary 2023, I think the rules will be back, maybe even more strictly when it comes to drinking. And I know my European friends, they\u2019re used to drinking in designated areas \u2026 and they are OK with that.\u201d But unwinding the transformations of the next four weeks may not be so simple. Beer tents can be packed up and bans on public displays of affection reimposed. But for those pushing for a more relaxed kingdom, the memory of what is transpiring here may not be so easily erased. \u201cThey hired David Beckham to be the face of the Fifa World Cup,\u201d says al-Maadeed. \u201cSo, after the World Cup, if a Qatari guy comes and shows his tattoos, no one can speak. And if a Qatari lady comes with her tattoos showing, no one should speak because, two or three months before, you were advertising this guy whose tattoos are virtually everywhere.\u201d"

                    "body": "I watched Wales\u2019s second game of the World Cup at Clwb Ifor Bach, Cardiff. The same venue I saw the Strokes, Afrika Bambaataa and Roots Manuva play in my 20s, but there has never been a headliner at Clwb like Wales v Iran. As I walked through Cardiff city centre last Friday morning I saw pubs fill and football fans greet each other, alongside office workers purchasing that pillar of the 21st-century Welsh economy, the Boots Meal Deal. People having a pint at 9.35am because Wales are playing in the World Cup against opposition we haven\u2019t met since 1978. We have always wanted this.\nAfter the 1-1 draw with the USA in the opening game, fans hoped for a repeat of Euro 2020: a nervy stalemate in the first match against Switzerland followed by Bale and Ramsey rolling back the years to outclass Turkey and see us reach the last 16; Gareth and Aaron adding to the evidence that there are in fact two real Princes of Wales. We were all to be disappointed. A deserved win for Iran as a lacklustre Wales cracked in the final two minutes of stoppage time. Even a victory in the final group game may not be enough.\nAnd so, on to England. Many, if not most, of our fans were disappointed when we were drawn in the same group as our next-door neighbours. If the European Championship is about big international derbies and the continent\u2019s heavyweights being pitted against each other, part of the World Cup\u2019s allure is new teams, strange fixtures, different experiences, something that can\u2019t be provided by the familiarity of Luke Shaw and Mason Mount. Before last Monday night the only competitive games Wales had played against non\u2011European opposition were against Mexico and Brazil in 1958. Declan Rice was not part of the plan in this global festival of football.\n\nSeeing such recognisable faces on the pitch is jarring at a major tournament, lending a Sky Super Sunday feel to a game taking place in a different time zone, both on and off the pitch. Some countries in South America might have a bigger problem with hooliganism. German fans might be more organised, the phenomenon of the tifo might make the Italians more colourful. But when it comes to one of the most dreaded sights and sounds in football, the synchronised jeer and outstretching of arms culminating in a wanker sign as the opposition\u2019s best player drills a goalscoring opportunity wide of the post, England fans are undoubtedly world class. As seasoned watchers of the Premier League, we are acutely aware of the talent Gareth Southgate has at his disposal. Wales need to play with the handbrake off. We\u2019re hoping England don\u2019t do the same.\nEngland and Wales in football is a strange rivalry. We share a border but the English are more bothered by Germany, France or Argentina, and historically Scotland. It lacks the class element of rugby union, where English former public schoolkids take on the largely state-educated working\u2011class Wales team. What it does share with rugby union is an imbalance of resources. England is a country of 57 million people. Wales has a population smaller than that of the east Midlands. Among football fans there is far less of the \u201cas long as we beat the English\u201d attitude that has been prevalent in Welsh rugby, something that makes more sense when a sport\u2019s primary focus is an annual European competition played between the same six teams.\nWales haven\u2019t beaten England at football since 1984, in the final season of the much-maligned British Home Championship. A 20-year-old Mark Hughes, with the fresh face of an angel and thighs of a powerlifter, scored the winner just 17 minutes into his debut, in the final year of a tournament that provided the Football Association of Wales with an enormous amount of its annual revenue, but that the English (and Scottish) FA no longer wanted to play. Since then, it has been played six, lost six.\n\nThere was a very British element to Welsh football when I started going in the 1990s. Like today, lots of our fans supported English teams. A lot of the songs we sung were the same. The four big Welsh clubs \u2013 Cardiff City, Swansea City, Newport County and Wrexham \u2013 were fully signed-up sufferers of the \u201cEnglish disease\u201d and had significant hooligan problems. But this has changed substantially since I first fell in love with following Wales in 1990.\nThe FAW has announced it would like the team to be known as Cymru, rather than Wales. Our fans now sing in Welsh and English. If part of the aim for this World Cup was to raise the profile of Wales globally, it actually helps we\u2019re playing England.\nNo one can be forgiven for thinking we\u2019re not a country in our own right any more. Our cricketers represent England (and Wales). Our athletes compete in the Olympics for Team GB. International football matters because it tells the world that Wales exists, in a sport that globally is more popular than democracy. Tom Jones might have been introduced on stage in America as a singer from England, but no one is under any illusions as to where Gareth Bale is from. Our greatest player is now under huge pressure to provide us with one more moment of magic.\nApart from the rare occasions we\u2019ve been drawn against England in qualification campaigns, or in the group stage of Euro 2016, our paths haven\u2019t crossed very often since 1984. We have more historical grievances with Scotland, having failed to qualify against them for the 1978 and 1986 World Cup finals. We have been drawn so often against Belgium in recent years I am now more familiar with their starting XI than I am with some of the CDs I still keep in my glove compartment. But we need to beat England in Doha to stand any chance of progressing at this tournament. Winning against a team we have beaten 14 times since 1879, in our first World Cup finals for 64 years. It\u2019s just another game.\nElis James has donated his fee for this column to Amnesty International, which is campaigning for Qatar and Fifa to establish a compensation fund for migrant workers."

                    "body": "Paris has joined several French cities in announcing they will not show World Cup matches in public places or set up \u201cfan zones\u201d in protest at human rights and environmental abuses in the host nation, Qatar. The moves to boycott the competition next month come after what has been described as a \u201clast minute crisis of conscience\u201d by the public authorities. Local authorities in Marseille, Lille, Bordeaux, Reims, Nancy, Rodez and the capital have announced they will not install giant television screens as in the past to relay matches. \u201cThis competition has gradually turned into a human and environmental disaster, incompatible with the values we want to see conveyed through sport and especially football,\u201d Beno\u00eet Payan, the mayor of Marseille and head of a leftwing and environmentalist coalition, said in a statement. In Lille, the city council unanimously voted not to broadcast World Cup matches. The city\u2019s Socialist mayor, Martine Aubry, said holding the competition in Qatar was \u201ca nonsense in terms of human rights, the environment and sport\u201d. In Paris, Pierre Rabadan, a former French rugby international and the deputy in charge of sport at city hall, said there was \u201cno question\u201d of installing fan zones. This is despite the city\u2019s football team, Paris Saint-Germain, being owned by Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, the Emir of Qatar since 2011. Strasbourg has also decided not to screen the World Cup. \u201cIt is impossible for us not to listen to the numerous alerts from NGOs denouncing the abuse and exploitation of immigrant workers. Thousands of foreign workers have died on the building sites, it\u2019s unbearable,\u201d the city\u2019s ecologist mayor, Jeanne Barseghian, told 20 Minutes. \u201dStrasbourg, the European capital and seat of the European court of human rights, cannot decently condone these abuses, cannot turn a blind eye when human rights are being flouted in this way,\u201d she added. Pierre Hurmic, the ecologist mayor of Bordeaux, said screening the World Cup and setting up fan zones would make the city an \u201caccomplice to this sporting event which represents all the humanitarian, ecological and sporting aberrations\u201d. Eric Cantona, the former French international and Manchester United footballer, is also boycotting the World Cup. \u201cI will not watch a single match of this World Cup. This will cost me because since I was a kid it\u2019s been an event that I love, that I look forward to and that I watch with passion. But let\u2019s be honest with ourselves. This World Cup makes no sense. The only meaning of this event, as we all know, is money,\u201d he wrote. In a communique at the end of last month, the French Football Federation responded to criticism of its \u201cdeafening silence\u201d over the forced labour and deaths of migrant workers at World Cup sites. It said the \u201ccampaign of stigmatisation\u201d of Qatar was to be \u201cdeplored\u201d and that it had defended \u201chuman rights and other essential causes on a daily basis\u201d. \u201cTaking part in the World Cup doesn\u2019t mean closing one\u2019s eyes and supporting [abuse],\u201d it wrote. The FFF claimed to have \u201cimplemented various verification measures concerning the respect of social rights and the application of respectful working conditions at the French team\u2019s base camp\u201d in Qatar. The FFF believes the World Cup has brought progress to Qatar. \u201cEven if the reality on the ground is not perfect, this progress is undeniable and positive,\u201d it said. Laurent Bodin, an opinion writer for L\u2019Alsace newspaper, wrote: \u201cThe call to boycott is legitimate \u2026 but it\u2019s a bit late.\u201d He added: \u201cSuch behaviour cannot be selective. Those calling for screens to be turned off during the World Cup should stop following the news of Paris Saint-Germain, which is financed by Qatar, and many other clubs for which the state-owned airline, Qatar Airways, is a major sponsor. \u201cThe damage is done because the competition will take place.\u201d"

                    "body": "  5.10pm    Thank you so much for joining me today as we get ready for what promises to be an absolutely rollercoaster night, kicking off in less than two hours now. Gosh. Scott Murray is on MBM duties for us tonight, and he says:  Lionel Messi wants to put those GOAT arguments to bed by single-handedly dragging Argentina, Maradona-style, to the top of the world. Luka Modri\u0107, one of only two players to break the Messi-Ronaldo Ballon d\u2019Or duopoly of the last 14 years, dreams of another masterclass in overachievement with four-million-strong Croatia. In a few hours, one of our 35 and 37-year-old superheroes will be smacked flush in the face with the realisation that their World Cup dream will almost certainly remain unfulfilled for eternity. Tears before bedtime are nailed on.  I will see you here again tomorrow for the news and buildup to France v Morocco. Until then, stay safe, and I hope you have a great time watching the match. Go and join Scott over here \u2026      4.59pm    Jacob Steinberg is in Doha for the Guardian, and he has written this analysis ahead of tomorrow\u2019s second semi-final, saying that France have mastered art of winning, but tireless Morocco will set new traps: On Wednesday night France face a conundrum: how to breach opponents who will give them the ball and trust in the tournament\u2019s best defence to hold firm. Morocco, the first African side to reach the semi-finals, stand in their way and are likely to take some budging. The underdogs will be roared on by thousands of supporters at Al Bayt Stadium, where a hostile atmosphere is bound to test the courage of the France players, and they are surely not going to open up now. Entertaining neutrals is not Morocco\u2019s priority. They have played eight and a half hours of football, faced three penalties in their shootout win over Spain and still the only goal they have conceded came when Nayef Aguerd put the ball into his own net against Canada. Patience, as the France goalkeeper Hugo Lloris acknowledged, is going to be key. Part of the problem for the world champions is that Morocco, supremely drilled by Walid Regragui, are effective. They will look to their brilliant right-back Achraf Hakimi to set aside his friendship with his Paris Saint-Germain clubmate Mbapp\u00e9. There will be responsibility on the tireless Sofyan Amrabat to pin down Griezmann, who was so impressive against England, and Bono to perform more wonders in goal. They will be praying that Aguerd, Romain Sa\u00efss and Noussair Mazraoui are fit to play in defence, and that they are not too weary after beating Portugal 1-0 in the quarter-finals. But Morocco, who topped a group containing Belgium and Croatia, will also look to lure France into a trap before springing forward on the break. As Lloris pointed out, they have a strong midfield and creative threats from Hakim Ziyech and Sofiane Boufal. Youssef En-Nesyri, who scored the winner against Portugal, is a dangerous runner up front. \u201cThey\u2019re not just good in defence,\u201d Deschamps warned. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t have reached the semis if they were just a defensive team.\u201d Read more here: Jacob Steinberg \u2013 France have mastered art of winning but tireless Morocco will set new traps      4.51pm    We are probably still about an hour away from team news, but the kits are out at the stadium. I\u2019ve zoomed in, but sadly nobody appears to have left a team sheet hanging around.       4.44pm    The stadiums for the World Cup semi-finals open to fans a mere four hours before kick-off. You could cram in a lot of Bud Zero before a match, couldn\u2019t you? But that does means we already have some joyous scenes of anticipation building at the Lusail ahead of a Croatia v Argentina match that just seems impossible to call. Will it be Messi\u2019s destiny or Croatia\u2019s absolute point-blank refusal to lose knockout matches in 90 minutes that prevails?    On a more sombre note we are also getting images from the Lusail stadium of books of condolence that have been set up for three journalists who have died in Qatar while covering the tournament: ITV technical director Roger Pearce, Qatari photojournalist Khalid al-Misslam and US soccer journalist Grant Wahl.      4.24pm   Moroccan FA distributes unsold tickets for France semi-final to fans for free  Hundreds of Moroccan fans waited outside Al Janoub Stadium on Tuesday for a chance to score a free ticket to the country\u2019s World Cup semi-final game against France, AP reports. The tickets were given out by the Moroccan soccer federation in coordination with Fifa and the Qatari organising committee. \u201cWe bought the rest of unsold tickets in the stadium and we distributed them to our fans,\u201d Moroccan federation president Fouzi Lekjaa said. \u201cThey are here in Qatar and they have only one desire \u2013 to see the national team.\u201d Fans outside Al Janoub stadium said they had been waiting for several hours. Some camped out with blankets and chairs and took turns sleeping on the ground. Many plan to support the team in Qatar even if they can\u2019t get a ticket.  \u201cWe are just going to rely on God. We wish from the bottom of our heart that tomorrow\u2019s game goes well,\u201d Moroccan fan Mohammed al Hmaemi said. \u201cWe hope that our national team wins. We do not have tickets, so we are just going to stay outside and cheer for them.\u201d Moroccan fan Hasnae Belazzeyz said the wait was worth it: \u201cIt\u2019s more than a dream, it\u2019s incredible. It\u2019s a national pride. It is historical.\u201d     4.06pm   Upamecano and Rabiot both miss training for France  Reuters reports that defender Dayot Upamecano and midfielder Adrien Rabiot are both doubtful for Fracne\u2019s World Cup semi-final against Morocco after missing collective training on Tuesday. Centre back Upamecano and Rabiot, who suffer from a cold, are on light training indoors, the French federation said. Upamecano had already missed Monday\u2019s training session. Should they be ruled out, Ibrahima Konat\u00e9 would be expected to start at centre back while Youssouf Fofana would be most likely to be alongside Antoine Griezmann and Aurelien Tchouameni in midfield.     3.50pm    France have been out training today ahead of tomorrow\u2019s second semi-final, where they face Morocco.        3.40pm    Ghana\u2019s Football Association (GFA) appears to be having a moment. They have just issued a press statement threatening to sue unnamed people who they claim have been making defamatory statements against the national team following the early exit from Qatar. In part the statement reads:  Following the exit of the senior national team, the Black Stars from the on-going Fifa World Cup Qatar 2022, the GFA issued a statement dated 2 December 2022 (same day of the third match). We apologised to the general public and all stakeholders and also indicated that we will continue with the positive lessons going into the future.  The GFA has since kept an open mind and continue to listen and receive comments, suggestions, and ideas from well-meaning Ghanaians both home and abroad for the improvement of the team.  Unfortunately, the GFA has noticed that a few persons are deliberately maligning and defaming the GFA and the Black Stars brand in an attempt to manufacture a nonexistent scandal about the team.  The GFA has therefore instructed its lawyers to institute legal action against persons who defame the Association, its officials, products and destroy the Black Stars brand as well as the media platforms used to do same.   I must confess one of the highlights of the group stage for me was the last ten minutes of that Uruguay v Ghana match where both teams knew they needed goals to avoid going out and appeared to both be working on the premise that they might as well go all out attack.     2.54pm    Away from the men\u2019s World Cup for a moment, this weekend in England we saw the last action in the Women\u2019s Super League until after the winter break. Faye Carruthers rounds up the final, weather-hit action in 2022 alongside Suzanne Wrack, Flo Pollock and Tim Stillman in Women\u2019s Football Weekly.      2.51pm    Fifa have a breakdown today of some of the records that Lionel Messi is equal to or close to. They include:  Messi has made 24 World Cup appearances \u2013 one short of the record held by Lothar Matthaus Messi and Rafa Marquez have made a joint-best 18 appearances as captain in the World Cup Messi could break Paolo Maldini\u2019s record for the most minutes played in the World Cup (2,217) if tonight\u2019s match goes into extra time Gabriel Batistuta and Messi are Argentina\u2019s joint-leading marksmen in the World Cup on 10 goals apiece Miroslav Klose has played in 17 World Cup victories. Messi is currently on 15      2.34pm    This World Cup has been slightly duller for the absence of Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107, who you imagine would liven up even the most glittering of spectacles. Thankfully, never shy of coming forward, he has had some things to say about Qatar. Firstly, he thinks Argentina are going to win the whole thing. \u201cI think it\u2019s already written who will win, and you know who I mean. I think Messi will lift the trophy, it\u2019s already written,\u201d Ibrahimovi\u0107 said. Secondly, he hasn\u2019t been totally surprised by Morocco. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a surprise because I knew they were good before the World Cup. Then obviously in the World Cup everything can happen,\u201d he said. \u201cThat they reached the semi-final, maybe a little surprised, but remember it\u2019s a good team, a good nation. And these surprises I think the people like; they enjoy because they want these things to happen so they get some kind of extra adrenalin.\u201d Thirdly, he said he wasn\u2019t really in any position to give Cristiano Ronaldo any advice after Portugal\u2019s captain made a lonely tearful exit down the tunnel following Saturday\u2019s defeat to Morocco. \u201cI think it\u2019s not important what I can say. I mean everybody wants to win the World Cup; not everybody gets to win the World Cup,\u201d said the Swede, who has been capped 121 times for his country. \u201cEverybody is trying and if you don\u2019t win it obviously you\u2019ll get emotional, if you win it, you get also emotional in a different way.\u201d     1.52pm    Have I mentioned the officials for the semi-finals yet today? I don\u2019t think I have. For Croatia v Argentina it is the Italian job. Daniele Orsato has the whistle, and his compatriots Ciro Carbone and Alessandro Giallatini will be running the line. Mohammed Abdulla of the UAE is the fourth official. You can insert your own conspiracy theory here about Fifa appointing Uefa officials to a semi-final that features a European team. Orstao was in charge of the opening match between Qatar and Ecuador, and previously refereed Argentina in their group game with Mexico.  Tomorrow, Morocco v France will be officiated by C\u00e9sar Arturo Ramos of Mexico. His assistants will be Alberto Mor\u00edn and Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez. They have already been in charge of Denmark v Tunisia, Belgium v Morocco and Portugal v Switzerland. The fourth official is Jes\u00fas Valenzuela from Venezuela.      1.34pm    Let us just say that my lunchtime walk in the London snow was more popular with some members of the party than others.  There is very little danger of snow affecting play in Qatar today, with temperatures expected to be around 21C (69.8F) for kick-off tonight between Argentina and Croatia in the first semi-final. We are already getting some pictures through of fans gathering ahead of travelling to the stadium.        1.24pm    Martin is back from lunch now so I\u2019ll hand back to him. Thanks.      1.21pm    The body of journalist Grant Wahl has been repatriated to the United States following his death while covering Argentina v Netherlands in the quarter-finals, the State Department has confirmed. Wahl was a passionate advocate for football/soccer in the United States in both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s game. He brought a critical eye to the World Cup in Qatar and football in general, reporting on human rights and LGBTQ+ issues and standing up for those without a platform. He wrote for Sports Illustrated for more than two decades and then started his own website. He was a major voice informing the US public about the game during a time of increased interest after the US hosted the 1994 World Cup. Tributes to Wahl have poured in since his death, with the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken adding his voice to the chorus of appreciation.  I so appreciated Grant Wahl, whose writing captured not only the essence of the beautiful game but also the world around it. I send my deepest condolences to his family, and thank our embassy team and Qatari partners who worked together so effectively to fulfill their wishes.  The Associated Press reports that State Department spokesman Ned Price said the US had no reason to believe Wahl\u2019s death was the result of foul play and praised Qatari authorities for fully cooperating with the embassy in arranging the repatriation. \u201cWe have seen no indication of foul play or anything nefarious at this point,\u201d Price told reporters in Washington. Rest in Peace, Grant.   Updated at 2.30pm GMT    1.06pm    There has been much debate about the format of World Cup 2026, which will be a bloated 48-team tournament when it kicks off in the three-and-a-half years time in the USA. It\u2019s the result of more meddling by Fifa, but world football\u2019s governing body is likely to row back on plans for three-team groups after Gianni Infantino claimed Qatar had hosted the greatest group stages of all time. But that still means many groups will have a third qualifier, thus giving rise to the probability of less excitement in many of the final group games. Jonathan Wilson argues that if the reason for a 48-team World Cup is to make it more global why not create a final global round of qualifying for a 32-team finals, thus preserving the current format. It\u2019s an interesting read \u2013 and one you may have missed at the weekend.       12.56pm    I know Guardian Towers has its own cartoonist and all, but I\u2019ve always been a fan of the work of the No Score Draws crew (formerly known as @Cheappanini). If you\u2019re willing to apply yourself you can still do great things, such as these drawings of Nikola Vlasic and Ivan Perisic.  Though my favourite at this World Cup is still probably Allison Becker:  It\u2019s all for a good cause, too:   Updated at 1.46pm GMT    12.39pm    Thanks Martin. In this morning\u2019s World Cup briefing Michael Butler points out that stopping Luka Modric, not Lionel Messi, may be key to shifting the balance of this evening\u2019s semi-final. I\u2019d very much agree with this but the current Croatia midfield is more than just Modric and is such an unbelievably well-grooved unit. Modric, Mateo Kovacic and Marcelo Brozovic are always shifting shape and seem to know instinctively where each other will be at any time. They\u2019ve played together a good while I suppose. They\u2019re all technically excellent and combative, as many Croatian midfielders have been down the years. There must be something in the water. Zvonimir Boban, Niko Kovac, Ivan Rakitic have been a joy to watch over the past three decades but, for me, the best was Robert Prosinecki, a ridiculously gifted footballer who played like Paul Gascoigne and Zinedine Zidane had been spliced together in a lab experiment. I remember my youth football coach at Marine FC in the mid-90s imploring us to watch him. I\u2019m not sure how this was supposed to help us because we couldn\u2019t learn how to do impossible things with a football. I\u2019m glad he did though. Football seemed to be one big joyride for Prosinecki.   Updated at 12.41pm GMT    12.33pm    I\u2019m going to hand you over to Gregg Bakowski now for a bit while I take a break and get over-excited about it being semi-final day.     12.12pm    Aleksandar Holiga writes for the Guardian today to set up tonight\u2019s semi-final from the Croatia perspective: It is quite a ridiculous idea. To come to the World Cup, four years after making it to the final as one of the best underdog success stories in the tournament\u2019s history, thinking you could go one step further this time and win the whole thing. This is football after all, the No 1 global sport, not handball or water polo, the other two team sports Croatia are any good at. In those two sports the competition is much narrower and you also get a chance to win the world championship every year. It is not the Davis Cup either, which they have managed to win twice in the last 17 years, with two different generations of players. If you are a small nation, the best you can normally hope for in football is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to play in the World Cup semi-finals or final. Many good teams from much bigger nations never get that opportunity, but here we are in 2022 with Croatia set to play in their third semi-final in less than a quarter of a century. What\u2019s more, they are not satisfied yet. \u201cIn 2018 we wrote history, but now we want to repeat that,\u201d the captain Luka Modri\u0107 told Marca after beating Brazil on penalties in the quarter-finals. \u201cI hope we can make that extra step this time.\u201d  Read more here: Aleksandar Holiga \u2013 \u2018We are built differently\u2019: Croatia relish second shot at World Cup glory      11.58am    Argentina and Croatia also met in Bordeaux in the 1998 World Cup. It was their final match in Group H, and both sides had already guaranteed they would qualify after both securing victories over Japan and Jamaica. Argentina won 1-0 with a lovely goal by Mauricio Pineda. There were some amazing players on both sides \u2013 Javier Zanetti, Ariel Ortega, Gabriel Batistuta, Slaven Bili\u0107, Davor \u0160uker, Zvonimir Boban, Robert Jarni and more. There are some highlights here if you\u2019ve got a couple of minutes to spare. Argentina\u2019s win set up their round of 16 tie with England, while Croatia would go on to face Romania and Germany before losing out to hosts France in the semi-final. Argentina made it to the quarter-finals that year before being undone by Dennis Bergkamp and the Dutch in Marseille.     11.49am    The last time that Croatia and Argentina met at a World Cup was matchday two in Group D in Nizhny Novgorod. 43,000 people watched Croatia humble la albiceleste 3-0 with Ante Rebi\u0107, Ivan Rakiti\u0107 and that man Luka Modri\u0107 on the scoresheet. Croatia are obviously hoping for more of the same today.      11.40am    In another brief \u201cnot football\u201d interlude, AP reports that a Spanish court has acquitted Neymar and his fellow defendants in a fraud and corruption trial related to the Brazilian\u2019s 2013 transfer from Santos to Barcelona. The plaintiff, Brazilian company DIS, had accused Neymar, his father, and the former presidents of Santos and Barcelona of having intentionally hid the cost of his transfer to avoid paying DIS what it was due as the partial holder of his player rights. However, the court said in a statement Tuesday that \u201cit has not been proven that there was a false contract or that DIS was intended to be harmed.\u201d The verdict is not a surprise after a decision by Spanish state prosecutors to drop all charges during the trial. That left only the lawyers of DIS to continue arguing their case.      11.34am    Effortlessly making everything I ever write look instantly less funny and with a lot fewer drawings to it, a new David Squires has dropped \u2026      11.24am    It would not be a France press conference ahead of France v Morocco without *checks notes* a question about England. French captain Hugo Lloris has apparently backed Harry Kane to bounce back from his penalty disappoint against France. To be honest, I\u2019m not really sure what else Lloris could be expected to say, he is hardly going to declare that he expects it to haunt Kane to the grave and start laughing maniacally while twirling a comedy villain moustache is he? Anyway PA sport quotes him saying:  We had a text after the game. But it was not easy to find the words straight after the game. I think he needed some rest. It\u2019s a difficult time obviously for the English national team and for Harry but he can be proud for what he\u2019s done for the national team during this World Cup. In football history many top players missed important penalties in their career. Players like Leo Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, like Kylian Mbapp\u00e9. But I have no doubt Harry will keep his chin up and he will help Tottenham and the national team to shine.   Fortunately, some of the media also asked Lloris about Morocco, to which he said:  I believe that both teams have plenty to lose. It\u2019s a semi-final of a World Cup, it\u2019s a unique opportunity to go to the final. Obviously it\u2019s already a success for Morocco to be at this stage of the competition but, believe me, they won\u2019t stop, they just want to carry on and to become even more heroes for the Moroccan country. In our side, we prepare for the demands of a semi-final of the World Cup, it doesn\u2019t matter who is the opponent. We just try to put the focus, the energy, the concentration and all of our strength into this game to make sure we will not have any regrets at the end.      11.00am    If you missed today\u2019s World Cup briefing, you also missed my look at what is going on in Argentina\u2019s media in the buildup to tonight\u2019s game: No media outlet can overlook an omen going into a World Cup semi-final, and Argentina\u2019s press is no different. Ol\u00e9 is slightly concerned that to avoid a colour clash with Croatia\u2019s shirts, Emiliano Mart\u00ednez \u201cwill be all in green and will not wear the historic red shirt with which he became a hero against Louis van Gaal\u2019s team\u201d. However, the sport journal notes that \u201cDibu (Mart\u00ednez\u2019s nickname) wore green in the decisive matches against Mexico and Poland, two duels in which La Scaloneta beat their respective rivals 2-0.\u201d  The Buenos Aires Times says Argentina have been helped by \u201chordes of travelling fans that have transformed each of their matches in Qatar into virtual home games\u201d. It says: \u201cThat passion is evoked in two songs that have regularly reverberated around Qatar\u2019s stadiums \u2013 \u2018Vamos Argentina\u2019 and \u2018Muchachos,\u2019\u201d a de facto national anthem of the national team which name-checks Messi, Diego Maradona and the 1982 Malvinas/Falklands war between Argentina and Britain. \u201cArgentina is a complex, politically fractured country. There are few subjects that unite the country \u2013 but the Malvinas and the football team do,\u201d it quotes Edgardo Esteban, director of the Malvinas Museum in Buenos Aires as saying. In Clar\u00edn the talk of the town remains firefighters in Esquina, the home town of Diego Maradona\u2019s mother, who listened to Argentina progress against the Netherlands while actively fighting a fire. One of them, 27-year-old Roberto Cardozo, told the press: \u201cWhen we got to the field, the owners were waiting for us and we went in to fight the fire. When I returned to refill the water, my girlfriend sent me a WhatsApp message notifying me of Argentina\u2019s first goal. I let my teammates know that we were winning. We even filmed ourselves at the moment Messi scored the penalty to make it 2-0 because we already had the situation under control.\u201d Lionel Scaloni\u2019s men will hope they similarly have Croatia under control at the Lusail tonight. Read more here: World Cup briefing \u2013 Modric, not Messi, could be the man to stop      10.54am    In tomorrow\u2019s semi-final, French fans will be largely outnumbered by the Morocco supporters at the Al Bayt stadium and France know they are in for a noisy night, as coach Didier Deschamps and captain Hugo Lloris have said at this morning\u2019s press conference. \u201cThey\u2019re benefiting from a huge support, I\u2019ve seen this and my observers have told me about. We know it\u2019s going to be extremely noisy, it\u2019s part of the context and we\u2019ll have to be ready for it,\u201d Reuters reports Deschamps told the news conference on Tuesday. \u201cGood for them. We have to prepare for the game, but also for the environment of the game.\u201d Lloris said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to be ready for the noise. I admire and respect what they\u2019ve done here, they owe nothing to chance, they finished top of their group,\u201d said Lloris. \u201cThey have a lot of qualities on and off the pitch, in terms of cohesion. The environment will be hostile but we\u2019re getting ready, calmly. We\u2019ll have to be ready to up our level one more time.\u201d     10.32am    There are a few more quotes from Morocco\u2019s coach Walid Regragui on the wires via Reuters, and he has said that his team do not have a specific plan to counter Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 tomorrow. He said:  I am not going to try and set up any particular tactical plan to counter Kylian. France also has other good players. Griezmann is on top of his game and playing well between the lines and Ousmane Dembele is also a perfect complement to Mbapp\u00e9 on the other wing. If we just focus on Mbapp\u00e9 that will be a mistake. They are world champions, with world class players and they will be going for it with all they got. We need to focus on what we can do to cause problems for France.  Mbapp\u00e9, on the left of the attack, goes up against Paris St Germain club mate and close friend Achraf Hakimi, who is Morocco\u2019s highly-rated right back. \u201cAchraf knows Mbappe better than me and trains with him on a daily basis, so he\u2019s better placed than I am to know how to deal with Kylian. Hakimi is one of the best players in the world, so it\u2019s going to be a great duel between the two,\u201d Regragui said.  One worry for Morocco and their fans is the number of injuries that the side have picked up en route to the semi-final. Morocco were still struggling with \u201ca lot of injuries\u201d said the coach, but players were recovering. There are concerns over the first-choice centre back pairing of skipper Romain Saiss and Nayef Aguerd in particular. \u201cWe have an excellent medical team and they have been coming with good news. But we will have to wait until the last minute to select the team. None is out yet, but no one is in either,\u201d he said.  Morocco have so far faced European opposition at this World Cup in Croatia, Belgium, Spain and Portugal without conceding a goal, and Regragui defended his side\u2019s tactics. \u201cWhat good is 70% possession if you only get a few shots on goal?\u201d he asked.  \u201cEverybody\u2019s working, everybody is giving their best in every way and we play a collective game every time with a good spirit, which for me is everything in football.     10.22am    Coach Didier Deschamps and captain Hugo Lloris are the France media duo again today in Doha it appears.  Meanwhile, I do enjoy the random pictures that come over the newswires ahead of a big football match. They will be dancing in the patriotic bakeries of Zagreb tonight for sure if Croatia progress.      10.06am    Anita Asante writes for us this morning on the topic of Olivier Giroud, who she says continues to thrive beneath the radar for France: Against England, we saw the full benefits of Giroud. France were not at their best. In some ways we\u2019ve been spoiled by some of the French teams over the years with players such as Zinedine Zidane, Marcel Desailly and Claude Makelele, teams and players against which this side will always be measured. Anytime we think of France, we think of the flair, the fluidity of play, the elegance, the finesse. We saw glimpses of that on Saturday, but we didn\u2019t see it in large doses. However, they did show they can get things done when they are not at their full, flying best. We still saw majesty from Mbapp\u00e9 on the ball and the intelligence of Antoine Griezmann dropped into that midfield role while Adrien Rabiot looked another level, dictating the linkup between defence and midfield and into the forward line. But the strengths and qualities of a forward such as Giroud, when things aren\u2019t going your way as a team, were fully on show. We shouldn\u2019t underestimate the work he does to be on the defenders\u2019 case with his movement and his positioning so that they do not get a moment\u2019s rest. That is extremely tiring and frustrating because they constantly have to be switched on to his whereabouts. The mind is constantly racing: Where is he? Who\u2019s got him? Is he in between us? Here he is now. He\u2019s stretching the game. We can\u2019t squeeze that space because what about this space?  Read more here: Anita Asante \u2013 Traditional No 9 Olivier Giroud continues to thrive beneath the radar for France   Updated at 10.12am GMT    9.50am    I missed one of the Asian teams out of that round-up. That is partially because I am old enough to remember when Australia were part of the Oceana confederation, and partly because we already have our own specific standalone story about Graham Arnold, who is set for a Socceroos contract offer after their World Cup success: Socceroos coach Graham Arnold appears set to be offered a fresh contract as informal negotiations continue with Football Australia hierarchy. Arnold\u2019s previous deal expired after overseeing Australia\u2019s most successful World Cup at the tournament in Qatar. The head coach is holidaying in the United Kingdom, with FA chief executive officer James Johnson keeping in contact ahead of Arnold\u2019s return to Australia after Christmas. Johnson has pledged to not sound out any other potential coaching candidates before Arnold returns. \u201cWe are in touch with Graham about what his involvement over the next four years will look like,\u201d Johnson told AAP. \u201cSure, having some stability with this team, given the rise, is a good thing and we will talk to Arnie about that. \u201cWe won\u2019t talk to others until we have finished talking to Arnie. But ... we have got to be realistic, Arnie\u2019s value has increased but so has the Australian game, and the Socceroos ... let\u2019s see where we land, but I must say I am very proud of Graham.\u201d Under Arnold, the Socceroos won two games at a single World Cup for the first time and advanced to the round of 16 for only the second occasion, following the feat of the 2006 squad. Arnold has yet to indicate his future intentions.  Read more here: Graham Arnold set for Socceroos contract offer after World Cup success      9.34am    What now for the coaches of the Asian teams at the Qatar World Cup? John Duerden at the AP has a round-up: South Korea: Paulo Bento leaves Seoul after more than four years in charge. He took the team to the second round after a last-minute win over his native Portugal in the last game of Group H, but his tenure ended with a 4-1 loss to Brazil. \u201cAlthough we were eliminated in the Round of 16, we still stuck to our style of play against a powerful team,\u201d said Bento, who added that he\u2019d decided in September to move on after Qatar. \u201cI will always be connected with South Korea, both in terms of my career and my personal life.\u201d The domestic football debate has already moved to whether the next head coach will be a Korean or a foreigner.  Japan: Japan beat Germany and Spain to top its group and progress to the knockout stage of the World Cup for the fourth time, but the Samurai Blue was disappointed not to reach the last eight for the first time, however, losing in a penalty shootout to Croatia. Coach Hajime Moriyasu, appointed in 2018, confounded critics who thought he was too conservative to guide the team to great success. It is expected that the 54-year-old Moriyasu will continue after he told reporters upon returning to Tokyo that he wants to stay in the job longer, and the team received a hero\u2019s welcome on their return.  Iran: Carlos Queiroz was only appointed in August, and may also stay. Iran beat Wales but could not get a point against the United States in the last Group B game to advance to the knockout stages. \u201cNow we have to think about supporting the technical staff and Queiroz and think about the players and their spirit,\u201d Hamid Sajjadi, the Minister of Sports and Youth, said after the Iran squad returned home. \u201cQueiroz should be able to plan for the next Nations Cup with peace of mind, and we will do whatever we can to help.\u201d  Saudi Arabia: Herve Renard signed a contract extension in May to remain in charge of Saudi Arabia until 2027. After the Green Falcons\u2019 shocking 2-1 upset of Argentina, and coming close to a place in the last 16, Renard is safe in the Saudi job.  Qatar: The worst performing of the Asian teams in Qatar was the host nation. Felix Sanchez was the longest serving coach of the six, taking the reins at Qatar in 2017, but he recorded three losses on home soil. \u201cOur goal is very clear, we will have a generational shift,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cSome players will leave, others will come.\u201d It already seems to be happening. On Monday evening, the Qatar Football Association named a new-look roster for the regional Gulf Cup in January with Bruno Pinheiro, a former coach of Qatar\u2019s youth teams, in charge.     9.18am   Morocco coach Regragui: 'We aren't satisfied with the semi-final. We want to go further'  Morocco\u2019s coach Walid Regragui has been up before the press already today, and he has said they are aiming higher than just reaching the semi-final. PA Sport is carrying the following quotes:  The further you get, the more difficult the games are. We are playing the world champions with world-class players and a very good coach, possibly the best in the world. But we will show great desire and try to pull off an upset. Why not reach the final of the World Cup? We\u2019ve come to this competition to change mindsets within our continent. If we say the semi-final is enough, I don\u2019t agree. We aren\u2019t satisfied with the semi-final and being the first African team to do that. We want to go further. Its\u2019s a knockout game and when you have desire, commitment and the support of the crowd, you can win it. We have beaten some top sides. Before every match people thought we would get knocked out but we are still here. We are getting closer to our dreams and we will fight to get there. We are one of the four best teams in the world now and we want to reach the final. The best team, Brazil, is already knocked out. We are hungry. I don\u2019t know if it will be enough but we want Africa to be on top of the world. I know we are not favourites but we are confident. You might think that\u2019s crazy, but a bit of craziness is good.       9.04am    Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag has said centre back Harry Maguire had a really good World Cup and urged him to replicate his England form at the club when the Premier League restarts, Reuters reports. Maguire lost his first-team spot for United in August but the 29-year-old started every game for England in Qatar, where they were knocked out in the quarter-finals by France. \u201cIt\u2019s clear he is good enough to play at the highest level,\u201d Ten Hag said at United\u2019s training camp in Spain.  \u201cHe had a period in Manchester where he performed badly and then, of course, there are difficulties. For England, he has good games almost all the time. We want him to bring that back to Manchester with him so he can bring it on the pitch for United. \u201cI think he had a really good World Cup. He was really consistent. When he is playing with his confidence like now, he is a massively important player for us and that is what everyone expects.\u201d     8.58am    Away from the football for a moment, AFP reports that the lawyer for Greek member of European parliament Eva Kaili on Tuesday said his client was \u201cinnocent\u201d after she was charged with corruption in a probe into suspected bribes from Qatar. Belgium has charged four suspects including Kaili as part of an investigation into allegations World Cup host Qatar has been handing out cash and gifts to influence EU policy debate. Two others were released after questioning. \u201cHer position is she is innocent. She has nothing to do with Qatar\u2019s bribes,\u201d Kaili\u2019s lawyer Michalis Dimitrakopoulos told Greek television channel Open TV.  Belgian prosecutors said \u20ac600,000 euros (\u00a3516,000) were found at the home of one suspect, \u20ac150,000 at the flat of an MEP, and several hundred thousand euros in a suitcase in a hotel room. Asked if any cash was found at Kaili\u2019s home, Dimitrakopoulos said: \u201cI am not confirming or denying. There is confidentiality. I have no idea if money was found or how much was found.\u201d Kaili, a 44-year-old Greek socialist and one of the European parliament\u2019s vice-presidents, was detained in Brussels on Friday. She has been stripped of her vice-presidential responsibilities and parliamentary group leaders are to meet Tuesday to prepare a vote to formally remove her from the post. She is remanded in custody and will face a hearing on Wednesday to see if she and three fellow accused will need to remain in detention pending a corruption trial.     8.51am    Croatia\u2019s social media manager is having fun this morning \u2013 and why not? They are in a World Cup semi-final again. They\u2019ve put up a poll asking who is going to win. And the options are Argentina, Croatia, and Croatia on penalties.       8.37am    Are Croatia even in a tournament knockout match if it doesn\u2019t go to extra time and penalties? Their record is stunning in that regard. Ed Aarons reports on how Dominik Livakovic is ready to repeat his heroics against Argentina: Livakovic \u2013 the son of Zdravko Livakovic, a former state secretary of Croatia\u2019s ministry of transport \u2013 made his debut for Dinamo\u2019s first team in October 2017 having previously played for amateur side NK Zagreb. Two years later, he broke a record that had stood for more than 20 years for most minutes from the start of Dinamo\u2019s season without conceding a goal. Livakovic was Subasic\u2019s deputy at the 2018 World Cup as Croatia made it all the way to the final in Russia before losing to France. \u201cEverything was particularly emotional,\u201d he said in an interview a few months later. \u201cApart from the result, which is the biggest in the history of Croatian football, the emotions that stuck in my memory the most during the last World Cup in Russia were the moments when our passage depended on penalties. It\u2019s something that can hardly be described in words: I was yelling, laughing and crying at the same time.\u201d  Read more here: Ed Aarons \u2013 Dominik Livakovic ready to repeat heroics against Argentina      8.25am    Not just any match day, say Croatia, it is an epic match day. I honestly cannot wait for either of these semi-finals and I just cannot call who we will be seeing in the final on Sunday.      8.19am    Talking about being sarcastic about things, I did feel yesterday that I was maybe being a little bit disparaging about the Fifa technical study group briefing that took place, and appeared to be some kind of \u201cDeath by PowerPoint\u201d event. Barney Ronay, on the other hand, is in Doha and decided to go at it overnight with a high two-footed tackle: These occasions are part of the treadmill of Big Football events. Qatar 2022 has hit its last, choreographed deep breaths, the bridge before the final push. It is now time for the football version of those moments in The Office where we watch the printer trays whirring, blank sheets loading, something to feed the machine between the beats. This is when we get the Fifa Technical Study Group media briefing, there to fill the empty air with words. The job here, like everywhere else, is to reinforce and justify every aspect of this World Cup. Pascal Zuberb\u00fchler was basically talking about how successful he thinks Fifa\u2019s new rules about staying on the goalline are. Earlier Zaccheroni had hymned the \u201ctechnical\u201d effects of five subs and masses of extra time. Nothing is bad in this room. Everything is good, better, progress. At some stage everyone on stage parroted the (arguable) line that this World Cup is a showcase for emerging powers \u2013 because, of course, this is a way of selling the expanded version next time out.  Read more here: Barney Ronay \u2013 Welcome to Fifa\u2019s Technical Study Group: nothing is bad, everything is good      8.16am   Preamble  Hello! Football is back! Briefly. This evening. There are only three competitive fixtures of the Qatar World Cup to go, and one of them is tonight. Strap in for Croatia v Argentina at the Lusail for a place in Sunday\u2019s final. 7pm GMT. A Messi-driven Argentina will be looking for their sixth final appearance and his last chance to lift the trophy. For Croatia, a team who remarkably have never failed to reach at least the semi-finals if they manage to get out of their group, it is a chance for a second successive final, and possible redemption against France for 2018\u2019s 4-2 defeat. As well as the buildup to that, we should also have media appearances from the France and Morocco camps, more speculation about the future of England\u2019s Gareth Southgate, probably a little bit of club football gossip creeping back in, and me being sarcastic about things.

                    "body": "Some governments, such as Syria and Myanmar, kill their own people. Some, such as Russia, kill people in other countries, as in Ukraine. Iran\u2019s government is doing both, home and away. Now, pressed into action by this murderous regime, Iran\u2019s national football team is about to play England, Wales and the US in the 2022 World Cup \u2013 as if nothing untoward were happening. This is not OK. In truth, it\u2019s shameful. To assist fans travelling to Qatar for the England-Iran match on 21 November and other Group B fixtures, here\u2019s a brief programme guide to recent events off the pitch. Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish Iranian woman, was beaten to death in police custody in Tehran in September after her arrest for allegedly breaking rules on mandatory head-coverings. In the ensuing nationwide protests \u2013 which are continuing \u2013 Iran\u2019s security forces have killed hundreds of people and detained nearly 10,000. Demands for reform have been rejected out of hand. Hardliners say the demonstrators should be executed. That would be nothing out of the ordinary for a regime notorious for human rights abuses, foreign hostage-taking and assassination plots. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, does not stop at terrorising young women. By supplying swarms of \u201ckamikaze\u201d drones to Russia, and reportedly ballistic missiles, too, the ageing dictator is helping Vladimir Putin\u2019s forces kill and maim Ukrainian children and create a humanitarian disaster this winter. Khamenei\u2019s regime, which has military ties to North Korea and Syria, as well as Russia, and is regarded by Israel as an existential threat, appears determined to acquire nuclear weapons-making capability. Tehran stalled last-ditch European efforts to revive the 2015 UN-backed nuclear deal. Experts say Iran can now produce enough fissile material to build a bomb in less than seven days. Iran\u2019s players are uncomfortably aware of regime efforts to use football (and them) to present a normal face to the world and distract attention from the crisis at home. Sardar Azmoun, a star striker, castigated the mullahs on Instagram. \u201cShame on you for so easily killing our people and long live the women of Iran,\u201d he wrote. Teammates have also criticised the regime. Yet there\u2019s little doubt Team Melli, as the national side is known, will show up in Doha. Penalties for refusing to play would be fearsome and there appears no prospect of a boycott. For different reasons, the England, US and Wales teams will also presumably do as they are told. National prestige and a great deal of money are at stake. Politically speaking, it would be next to impossible to pull out now. Humanly speaking, it\u2019s sickening. How is it acceptable to play games with a country at war with its own people and, indirectly, with you and your friends? Gianni Infantino, president of Fifa, world football\u2019s governing body, gave his tin-eared answer this month. He pleaded with the 32 countries competing in Qatar to \u201cfocus on the football\u201d and leave \u201cpolitics\u201d out of it. \u201cWe know football does not live in a vacuum,\u201d Infantino wrote. \u201cBut please do not allow football to be dragged into every ideological or political battle that exists ... At Fifa, we try to respect all opinions and beliefs, without handing out moral lessons to the rest of the world.\u201d Given its history of corruption and racketeering, the idea of Fifa handing out \u201cmoral lessons\u201d to anyone is laughable. But set that to one side for now. Significantly, Infantino did not address calls for Iran to be thrown out of the World Cup. And he also ignored the quintessentially political action taken by Fifa itself in February, when it excluded Russia after its Ukraine invasion. Other precedents include ostracism of apartheid-era South Africa, and the banning of the Yugoslavia/Serbia team from international tournaments in 1992. The bizarre yet persistent idea that sport can somehow isolate itself, or be absolved, from the political and socioeconomic order in which it has its being underpins the flawed approach of World Cup hosts Qatar \u2013 a close ally of Iran. This \u201cDon\u2019t look up\u201d strategy has inevitably sucked Qatar into controversy over migrant workers\u2019 rights and, more recently, over archaic attitudes to LGBTQ+ fans. An offensive claim last week by a Qatari World Cup \u201cambassador\u201d that homosexuality arises from \u201cdamage in the mind\u201d crystallised the problem. Despite some progress, \u201chuman rights abuses [in Qatar] persist on a significant scale,\u201d Amnesty International reported last month. \u201cIf Gianni Infantino wants the world to \u2018focus on the football\u2019 ... Fifa could finally start tackling serious human rights issues rather than brushing them under the carpet,\u201d said Amnesty\u2019s head of economic and social justice, Steve Cockburn. \u201cIt is astonishing they still have not done so.\u201d Ten European football associations, including the English and Welsh FAs, are demanding Fifa and Qatar do more. A joint statement included an important, even historic declaration. \u201cEmbracing diversity and tolerance also means supporting human rights. Human rights are universal and they apply everywhere,\u201d it said. That\u2019s certainly true. So if for no other reason, consistency requires that Saudi Arabia, another World Cup qualifier and serial human rights abuser, also face harsher scrutiny.The Saudi regime has turned Qatar-style sportwashing \u2013 reputation laundering \u2013 into a successful industry through lavish sponsorship of international sporting events and the purchase of the English Premier League club Newcastle United. Yet egregious Saudi human rights abuses, including mass executions and torture, persist. Will the wrongfully jailed Leeds University student, Salma al-Shehab, and other Saudi and Iranian political prisoners be watching the footie from their cells? Unlikely. Scrub the paeans to \u201cuniversal rights\u201d. Forget hyped-up talk of an \u201cexceptional global carnival\u201d and \u201cunprecedented festival of football\u201d. As a spectacle of human self-deception, disassociation and blatant hypocrisy, the 2022 World Cup is a genuine world-beater."

Guardiola and his staff may also have to watch events in Qatar through their hands, clenching as heavy tackles fly in and muscle injuries stack up given City \u2013 with 16 players \u2013 are the Premier League club sending the most players to the finals.\nEven if Erling Haaland will be spending much of the next six weeks on the Etihad Campus, key players such as Kevin De Bruyne, Phil Foden and Rodri will return bearing the physical and mental scars of the tournament. And individual success in Qatar may not necessarily be good news for a player\u2019s club.

Like Guardiola, Klopp has a star forward getting a needed rest, in Mohamed Salah, but it is Uruguay rather than Liverpool who will be the immediate beneficiaries of Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez\u2019s recent flowering.\nOverall the Premier League is providing more World Cup players than any other division, with 134 players at the tournament \u2013 16% \u2013 plying their trade in the English top flight. The league leaders, Arsenal, have 10 players in World Cup squads but their England contingent of three contains two players, Aaron Ramsdale and Ben White, expected to be reserves in Southgate\u2019s squad. The same may go for Gabriel Jesus and Gabriel Martinelli among a Brazil squad featuring heavy competition for forward places. Mikel Arteta appears to be getting off rather lightly, though how to motivate players disappointed at being underused is yet another consideration to add to the pile.\nThe response of players to disappointing tournaments is also important. How, for example, might Antonio Conte coax the best from Harry Kane at Tottenham should England\u2019s captain flop in Qatar? Or, to name another player among Spurs\u2019 11 call-ups, someone carrying a yet heavier burden for his national team, Son Heung\u2011min? Will his disappointing season so far \u2013 and the facial injury he is nursing \u2013 cast a shadow over his World Cup and consequently his return to Tottenham? Every player is on a sliding scale. How might they react to playing in a mid\u2011season tournament in which their country\u2019s expectations are sky\u2011high while playing for a different coach using probably very different tactics?\n\nFor managers such as Graham Potter and Erik ten Hag, relative newcomers to their clubs trying to install a fresh playing doctrine, losing players in mid\u2011season is unhelpful. Manchester United, sending 14, have made significant improvements under Ten Hag, and though Cristiano Ronaldo can be discounted from the list of players whose fitness he will care about, Casemiro, Christian Eriksen and Lisandro Mart\u00ednez have all been crucial to United\u2019s revival. Each is playing for a nation expected to go deep in the tournament.\nPotter\u2019s Chelsea have stalled of late. His players have appeared unresponsive to his tactics. Chelsea will have 12 players in Qatar but a mid\u2011season training camp planned for Abu Dhabi also gives Potter a decent core with which to work. Reece James, Wesley Fofana, Kepa Arrizabalaga, Marc Cucurella, Trevoh Chalobah, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Jorginho and Pierre\u2011Emerick Aubameyang are among those players not travelling.\n\nManchester United and Chelsea will return to action at Christmas looking at Newcastle in third place, and while Eddie Howe will not welcome a loss of momentum only five players are being lost from his squad to the World Cup, two of them \u2013 Callum Wilson and Nick Pope \u2013 likely to be on the England bench. And while Bruno Guimar\u00e3es is a player Newcastle cannot afford to lose, other leading players from this season in Sven Botman, not picked for Louis van Gaal\u2019s Netherlands team, and Miguel Alm\u00edron, whose Paraguay did not qualify, will return to Tyneside after taking short rests.\nFurther down the table, the World Cup break throws up an opportunity for Nathan Jones, freshly arrived at Southampton, who are sending only two players. Should Bournemouth appoint a new manager \u2013 or Gary O\u2019Neil stay on \u2013 only the Wales pair of Kieffer Moore and Chris Mepham will not be around.\nThree managers ended the season\u2019s first tranche of fixtures under pressure. At West Ham David Moyes will have mixed feelings if England progress deep in the tournament, with Declan Rice a key midfielder. Lucas Paquet\u00e1, the summer\u2019s big signing, is yet to shine in east London but is favoured by the Brazil coach, Tite. Perhaps a good showing in Qatar can energise Paquet\u00e1\u2019s club season. Jesse Marsch will be roaring on Team USA, though in Brenden Aaronson and Tyler Adams he will fear fatigue in two players who have become important to Leeds.\nWhich leaves Frank Lampard, with Everton losing four players to the tournament. Until his mistakes at Bournemouth at the weekend, Jordan Pickford had been exemplary in goal. An injury or the loss of form that can follow for players scapegoated for English failure could mortally wound Everton. Such are the myriad equations the World Cup must turn over in the minds of Premier League managers."

                    "body": "James Maddison visited a specialist on Wednesday as Leicester attempt to get to the bottom of a mystery knee injury, after the midfielder returned from the World Cup with a fresh problem. Maddison has not been able to train with his Leicester teammates since returning from Qatar and will miss Friday\u2019s trip to Liverpool. Maddison travelled to London with Mark Waller, the Leicester club doctor, on Wednesday to further understand the extent of his issue. Maddison had injured the back of his knee in November before the World Cup, for which he received treatment while away with England. The midfielder is now ruled out with a problem at the front of his knee. It is unclear how long Maddison is set to be sidelined.  Maddison was included in Gareth Southgate\u2019s England squad for the World Cup despite his initial knee problem but did not feature in Qatar. He was forced to sit out training sessions during the early stages of the tournament but was an unused substitute against Wales, Senegal and France. Maddison\u2019s sole England appearance came in a 7-0 win over Montenegro in November 2019. Leicester\u2019s manager, Brendan Rodgers, clarified that Maddison is absent with a different problem to the one he travelled to the World Cup with. \u201cHe was clearly getting treatment when he was out there and he and the medical team with England deemed him OK to train.  \u201cHe was training and available for games. He\u2019s come back to here, looked to do some work and he has felt some pain in a different part of his knee. The medical team have assessed that, looked at that. He tried to go out on to the field to do some multidirectional work and he was getting a pain from it. The medical team have gone to see the specialist, to get another opinion on it to see where he\u2019s at.\u201d On Tuesday Rodgers, for the first time in his managerial career, cancelled his players\u2019 day off as he launched an inquest into Leicester\u2019s flat performance in their 3-0 home defeat to Newcastle on Boxing Day. \u201cThey understood,\u201d Rodgers said of his players\u2019 reaction. \u201cThey would have been like me and had families travel over, kids and people who were there, probably waiting at home for them on their day off. But my responsibility is to make sure the team is at their required level mentally. I just felt it wasn\u2019t the performance that we would want and had built up for. I didn\u2019t want to waste another day in trying to make it right.\u201d"

                    "body": "1) Robot offsides\nIt\u2019s a new chapter in VAR\u2019s \u201cundisputable success story\u201d, says Fifa: 12 roof-level limb-tracking cameras plus an in-ball sensor. When the data hits, a robot draws toenail lines for the VAR; the VAR checks them, tells the referee and sends a 3D model to broadcasters. Fifa says it will cut the average 70-second wait before a goal can be celebrated down to \u201cjust 25 seconds\u201d \u2013 and anyone who says it\u2019s sucking the life out of football is wrong: \u201cWe are very proud of this work.\u201d Also new this winter: a chance to see more than half a starting XI subbed off in a game \u2013 five subs in normal time and another in extra time \u2013 while benches will expand to 15 players, up from 12.\n\n2) Female referees\nAt welcome odds with regional vibes, three of the 36 referees are, for the first time in men\u2019s World Cup history, female: Japan\u2019s Yamashita Yoshimi, the Rwandan Salima Mukansanga and St\u00e9phanie Frappart of France \u2013 as are three of 69 assistants. Michael Oliver and Anthony Taylor are the Premier League faces, while Zambia\u2019s Janny Sikazwe makes the cut despite a tough Africa Cup of Nations in January where he ended a game early twice in three minutes, blaming heat exhaustion.\n\n3) This mascot\nAt La\u2019eeb\u2019s launch in April, Qatar\u2019s Supreme Committee for Delivery &amp; Legacy played up his lack of fixed identity and asked fans to tell them what he looked like. \u201cUse your imagination \u2026 La\u2019eeb is whoever a football fan wants him to be.\u201d That went as well as could be expected \u2013 fans quickly agreeing he looks most like the ghost of a dead migrant worker. The official biog has tightened since then: La\u2019eeb, meaning \u201csuper-skilled player\u201d, is an \u201cadventurous, fun, curious\u201d sprite based on a ghutra headdress who \u201ccomes from the mascot-verse, a parallel world where all mascots live\u201d.\n\n4) Official songs\nMost World Cups have to get by with only one official song. Qatar has the \u201cFifa World Cup Qatar 2022\u2122 Official Soundtrack\u201d instead \u2013 \u201cpart of Fifa\u2019s revamped music strategy\u201d. Among the tracks are Hayya Hayya by Trinidad Cardona, Davido and Aisha, chorus: \u201cYo yo yo, yo ho, You know we better together\u201d; and Light the Sky by Rahma, Balqees, Nora and Manal, whose message is much more Doha: \u201cIf you feel like a star, then you feel like me, Gotta treat yourself, like a VIP.\u201d\n5) The opening ceremony\nSunday 20 November, before Qatar v Ecuador. Rumoured acts include Waka Waka\u2019s Shakira, BTS and the Fifa Official Soundtrack artists, all there to \u201ccelebrate and embody everything the Fifa World Cup stands for\u201d. It\u2019ll be held at Al Bayt Stadium, where 28-year-old Nepalese migrant Sanjib Raya died of heart failure working a 12-hour shift in 40-degree heat for \u00a31 an hour.\n6) The official ball\nAdidas\u2019s Al Rihla has \u201cSpeedshell PU skin\u201d inspired by \u201cthe culture, architecture, iconic boats and flag of Qatar\u201d, with \u201cmacro- and microtextures and surface debossing\u201d, \u201cCRT-Core\u201d technology and a strong PR game. Yours for \u00a3130. Fifa says \u201cit travels faster in flight than any ball in the tournament\u2019s history\u201d, which is similar to what they said about 2010\u2019s Jabulani. So, fingers crossed.\n\n7) Air-cooling technology\nPlenty for fans of air-cooling pipes to enjoy: seven of the eight grounds are equipped with chilled water-based aircon systems. Fifa denies that the tech, along with new roads and 150 flights a day, will have a negative environmental impact; with organisers making a \u201clandmark\u201d carbon neutrality pledge. Or as Carbon Market Watch called it in May, an \u201cabsolutely not credible carbon neutrality pledge\u201d.\n\n8) Alternative facts\nDavid Beckham faced plenty of criticism for taking a reported \u00a310m a year to sportswash Qatar, but hasn\u2019t been slow to shine a light on the nation, including in this video about visiting Qatar, released in August: \u201cQatar really is an incredible place to spend a few days on a stopover. The modern and traditional fuse to create something really special. It\u2019s one of the best spice markets that I\u2019ve ever been to. This will go down as one of my favourite mornings. This is perfection.\u201d Expect more positivity elsewhere, too, with the Supreme Committee giving 400 social media-influencing fans free trips in return for positive comments. Influencers had to sign a code of conduct making clear \u201cit would obviously not be appropriate for you to disparage Qatar [or] the Supreme Committee\u201d, and: \u201cYou understand that the Supreme Committee will be monitoring your posts.\u201d\n9) Managers giving half-time interviews\nThough maybe not many: Fifa\u2019s new half-time flash interview slot is \u201cnot compulsory\u201d. The BBC and ITV share the TV rights this winter \u2013 up to four games a day from 10am plus highlights, making for scheduling tension: Strictly\u2019s quarter- and semi-finals have been bumped to Friday 2 and Sunday 11 December, while Matt Hancock\u2019s planned win in the I\u2019m a Celebrity final is up against Spain v Germany."

                    "body": "It is an oft-repeated expression that \u201copinions are like arseholes, in that everyone has one\u201d. Tim Minchin used this once during a speech to university graduates, and then clarified that \u201copinions differ significantly from arseholes, in that yours should be constantly and thoroughly examined\u201d. The comedian-composer said we should be hard on our beliefs, \u201ctake them out onto the verandah and beat them with a cricket bat\u201d. It feels like an uncomfortable but worthwhile exercise after the Socceroos qualified for the World Cup, particularly when it comes to opinions regarding the coach. Today, a quick Google search of \u201cGraham Arnold\u201d brings up headlines such as \u201cvindication for Arnold\u201d, and \u201cAustralia, we owe this man an apology\u201d. Less than three months ago an identical search returned results like \u201caxe looming for Arnold\u201d and \u201cpressure is mounting\u201d.  At that time, in late March, a 2-0 loss to Japan had consigned Australia to two sudden-death playoffs next to nobody believed the team could win. The only tangible difference between then and now is that they have won both and we are all rather happy about it. Football is notoriously fickle, and recency bias gets the better of us all from time to time, especially in the context of such emotive subject matter. Arnold nailed the Peru match from start to finish. His already-famous goalkeeper gamble was dumfounding in its audacity. In the moment it seemed stark-raving mad. And perfectly so, because it worked. Had it not, the torches and pitchforks were ready. That decision would have, for those already prognosticating his failure, offered indubitable proof that they were right and he was wrong and so were all of his supporters. But why must we oscillate so wildly? There must surely be some space on the spectrum between mythical hero and substandard super villain. Arnold has been many things over the course of his four-year tenure and a lot of them don\u2019t fit neatly into any box. For those who already liked him at the time of his 2018 appointment, he was the perfect choice. A very good local coach who had won numerous domestic trophies with different clubs, been named coach of the year multiple times and learned a lot since his first stint in the national set-up. For those who did not he was a facade, a master of skullduggery and an already-tried-and-failed Socceroos coach. Most damning was the notion he did not possess the romantic ideals of Ange Postecoglou. In Arnold\u2019s very first press conference he said his philosophy lay somewhere between Postecoglou\u2019s attack-at-all-costs mentality and Bert van Marwijk\u2019s more defensive approach. He is probably a pragmatist, but did not want to use that word because of its (inaccurately) negative connotations. He, like those before him and no doubt others in the future, inherited not just a team but an entire country\u2019s worth of hopes, gripes and snipes. When it comes to the actual team, he has been overseeing transition. The remnants of the classes of 2006 and 2010 retired and, in an attempt to expedite the development of young players, he took charge of the Under-23s too. He was building for the future. This is laudable, isn\u2019t it? So why were we so off-kilter when results did not meet our expectations in the present? Was it partly the cognitive dissonance of hearing him repeatedly telling us \u201cwe expect to win\u201d even when they did not do so? Was it that a couple of the opponents who beat Australia had interpreted those pre-match words as arrogance? Do we forgive that because we know he got them from a self-described \u201ccoach whisperer\u201d who tells his clients to study the \u201csubconscious mind\u201d? Does it make a difference that he has since toned down that rhetoric, or that behind the scenes he is well liked in the dressing room for being jovial and kind?  Maybe it is all ancient history anyway because Australia have qualified. Does it spoil the party to point out that Peru played at a level well below their best and Australian football still faces myriad challenges? Had the Socceroos not made Qatar 2022 would it have been Arnold\u2019s fault or that of all of these long-unresolved problems? Would his success or otherwise be defined by his selections or tactics, and would that be offset by all the difficulties associated with Covid-19 and absences of key players throughout the campaign? It is hard to even define success when there is no constant against which to measure it. These questions just render it all the more confusing, but the point is that every time we watch a Socceroos match we are spring-loaded with whatever preconceived ideas we have already formed. None of us is impartial and, just like with managers, it is easier to back ourselves into an obdurate corner than unlearn learned behaviours. Australia are off to the World Cup. Now we must ask ourselves what we expect when they are there and why, and whether our answers stand up to a good beating with a cricket bat."

Well, you know all the gifted sporting heroes England is sending to the World Cup this week? Yes. It\u2019s for their wives and girlfriends. But why? Listen, this is a great idea. While their boyfriends and husbands overheat in order to prove their merit at an ethically compromised World Cup, the Wags get to live it up a vessel of unthinkable luxury. How luxurious? We\u2019re talking crystal staircase. We\u2019re talking spas complete with snow rooms. We\u2019re talking 13 restaurants, expensive jewellery shops, the longest dry slide at sea, a full butler service, all spread over 22 decks. Sounds expensive.

There are 20 different bars! There\u2019s a jazz speakeasy! The place sounds like a licence for full-blown debauchery. Crikey, it really does. It\u2019s better this way. Imagine the press reaction if some of the Wags were slung in jail for being drunk and disorderly. Doesn\u2019t bear thinking about. It\u2019s far from the prying eyes and long lenses of the paparazzi, too. Much harder to get papped looking a little worse for wear on a massive boat. What brilliant news. Nobody loses! Well, you could argue that attending the World Cup in any capacity is a tacit sign of support for a country with a long history of harrowing human rights abuses, and that all the Wags should be deeply ashamed of themselves. But whatever \u2026 Jazz! Fun! Do say: \u201cTime to celebrate the World Cup in total luxury!\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cComing soon: the Wags visit a floating casino off the coast of North Korea.\u201d   "

The guidance to clergy, under the heading \u201cMaking the most of the World Cup final\u201d, warns of the possible difficulties of holding a carol service on Sunday 18 December. The Sunday before Christmas is a traditional time for afternoon or evening festive services. With the final due to kick off at 3pm, the C of E says services \u201ccould still be possible if you choose the time carefully \u2026 but what if there are penalties?! It may be best to avoid that day altogether and host a carol service on Saturday 17 instead.\u201d But it adds: \u201cDespite this clash of dates, football and faith don\u2019t have to be at odds with one another.\u201d Football and the church have a \u201cconjoined heritage\u201d, it says, as several Premier League clubs \u201cstarted up as parish church football teams, set up for the health and wellbeing of those local communities\u201d. The guidance suggests ideas for how parish churches could encourage people to \u201cuse the World Cup as a missional tool this Advent and Christmas\u201d. They include watching games at local sports clubs or pubs or inviting neighbours to your home. \u201cOffer to lead some carols, perhaps sharing a sport and faith testimony after the game, with an invitation to Christmas services.\u201d Alternatively, parishes could screen games in church with refreshments, or host a Christmas sports day instead of regular worship, \u201cweaving together a range of sport and Christian values\u201d. Another idea is to stage a football-themed nativity play. The C of E has created two scripts that parishes can download, involving the three kings following the star to an adaptation of the anthem Football\u2019s Coming Home. \u201cWe\u2019re coming west / We\u2019re coming west / We\u2019re coming / Kings are coming west.\u201d The C of E has acknowledged the controversies surrounding the World Cup in Qatar. In an article on the C of E\u2019s website, Libby Lane, the bishop of Derby and the C of E\u2019s lead bishop for sport, said: \u201cThere are serious concerns about the treatment and safety of workers, especially migrant workers. I am concerned about the discrimination which women face in Qatar, both in law and practice. And I am concerned for the safety of LGBTI+ supporters travelling to the World Cup, and who are impacted by the decision to play the World Cup in a country which criminalises homosexuality \u2026 \u201cI personally do not think that the World Cup should ever have been awarded to Qatar, and I support those individuals and nations who are making a stand at the tournament, on behalf of migrant workers, women and LGBTI+ people.\u201d Sport should never be \u201ca smokescreen for discrimination, oppression and exploitation\u201d, she said."
