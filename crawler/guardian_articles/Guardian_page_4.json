                    "body": "Less than 20 minutes into only his second Major League Soccer game, Gareth Bale scored a goal that could have served as a mission statement. Introduced off the bench with Los Angeles FC already 1-0 up against Sporting KC, the Welsh winger, who needs game time to find his best form before the 2022 World Cup, produced a performance that grew sharper with every minute and culminated in a quick transition strike to kill the game at 2-0.  Another typical Bale goal quickly followed in a 4-1 win over Real Salt Lake in which the 33-year-old strode past two opponents at the byline to fire home from a tight angle. Two goals in three appearances off the bench represented a good start to his MLS career, but Bale has struggled to build on this. In fact, he hasn\u2019t scored another goal in the two months since his strike at Rio Tinto Stadium. In fact, Bale hasn\u2019t even completed a full MLS match, and has started just two of the 12 games he has featured in for LAFC since joining from Real Madrid in June. Steve Cherundolo\u2019s team clinched the Supporters\u2019 Shield with victory over the Portland Timbers on Sunday and will be among the favourites to win this year\u2019s MLS Cup with the playoffs set to start later this month, but Bale has hardly had a hand in their success.  The measure of Bale\u2019s time at LAFC was always likely to be different. As long as he arrives in Qatar for the World Cup in good shape, he will consider his decision to make the move to MLS vindicated. Bale once infamously waved a flag that read \u201cWales, golf, Madrid \u2013 in that order,\u201d and his club might still be at the bottom of the list. \u201cWe have a plan in LA with what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Bale recently said when asked to assess his own impact in MLS. \u201cWe\u2019re not doing too much straight away. Every footballer wants to play as much as they can, but we\u2019re being clever and building myself up for the last important part of the season. Hopefully that should put me in great shape for the World Cup. I think I\u2019ll be a lot fitter.\u201d Wales manager Robert Page\u2019s comments hinted at underlying dissatisfaction at his best player\u2019s situation. \u201cWhat he does from now until the first game [of the World Cup] against USA \u2026 we will be in contact with the club and help manage those minutes,\u201d Page said after bemoaning not being able to use Bale across all 180 minutes against Belgium and Poland in the Nations League due to his lack of fitness. Page knows Bale can be a difference-maker for Wales in Qatar. He is the country\u2019s all-time top scorer (40 goals in 108 caps) and the player who secured World Cup qualification in the first place, scoring three goals in the playoff semi-finals and final. At his best, Bale can win a match on his own. For Wales, his fitness could be the difference between a last-16 appearance and a group stage exit. LAFC may not have much incentive to increase Bale\u2019s game time before he heads to Qatar. This may seem somewhat peculiar given the Welshman\u2019s individual quality and record at the elite level of European soccer, but Cherundolo has a system that already works well without Bale and with the playoffs almost here there isn\u2019t much scope for experimentation between now and November. Many argued Bale\u2019s move to MLS would afford him more freedom to gain fitness and match sharpness than would have been the case in the Premier League or another of Europe\u2019s \u201cBig Five\u201d leagues. However, MLS\u2019s relative parity makes rotation difficult, even for a team like LAFC who appeared a good bet to make the playoffs from early on. On top of this, MLS\u2019s travel schedule makes the season a gruelling one. In Spain, Bale\u2019s longest away day involved an hour or two on a chartered plane. In the Premier League, most away matches can be reached on a bus. In MLS, though, Bale is regularly travelling across multiple time zones, sometimes on commercial flights. It may not be until the World Cup is out of the way that MLS sees the best of Bale. Only then will the winger be able to clear his mind and fully commit to life at LAFC with a full pre-season ahead of him to get ready for the 2023 campaign. Even then, Bale could struggle to build momentum as he is only contracted until next summer. A decision on his long-term future will have to be made. There have been glimpses of brilliance from Bale in MLS, which will have offered encouragement to Page and Wales. At 33, he has lost some of the pace that made him so explosive earlier in his career, but the ability remains. Once Bale has finished making sure Wales can unlock that ability at the World Cup, he may get round to doing the same for LAFC in MLS."

Their prime target is Vincent Aboubakar, the Cameroon striker who is at Al Nassr in Saudi Arabia.\nErik ten Hag regards Weghorst as an ideal solution for a stopgap centre-forward with United working this month to a limited budget.

A player is allowed to air their view. We\u2019ve been together for six years now and comments won\u2019t help us to win. Maybe it was a double-bluff. It\u2019s what happens behind the scenes that matters.\u201d\n\nThe Manchester City midfielder was again subdued, and Mart\u00ednez was asked why Belgium had not seen the best of De Bruyne at this World Cup. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the best of Belgium yet,\u201d he replied. \u201cWe are not at our best. It\u2019s not just Kevin, it\u2019s the whole team. We didn\u2019t play with freedom. Football is a team sport and when it works together the individual can reach a higher level.\u201d\nMart\u00ednez claimed Belgium\u2019s biggest problem was the weight of expectation on his players and their lack of enjoyment on the pitch as a consequence. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see us enjoying our football or playing with joy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t play with joy and maybe that\u2019s because of the weight we are carrying on our shoulders. We\u2019ve played the last two games like we have something to lose.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a lack of quality or the technical aspect. We were better on the ball than against Canada but the link-up and the last pass was missing. We played with a fear of losing. I don\u2019t see the enjoyment we usually play with and that\u2019s something we need to work on.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t anything to lose any more. We will play to win against Croatia and that will be the start of us at this World Cup.\u201d"

Moments like this materialise these changes and remind you of how proud we are of our youth.\nSaudis have long bristled at the notion that a love of sports and a keenness to attract global events amounted to image laundering, with many sports fans insisting that they too wanted to experience international competition and pitch their national teams into the mix.\nAhead of the match, Prince Mohammed told the national team: \u201cAll I want to tell you is stay relaxed, play your game and do your thing.\u201d Few believed that this was just another game, however. In a country battered by criticism over human rights and geopolitical positions, this was a nation-building moment, a chance to turn a political tide.\nAfter full-time, regional rivals embraced the Saudi win. Dubai\u2019s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, tweeted congratulations. Qatar\u2019s emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, meanwhile, briefly draped himself in the Saudi flag \u2013 an image that put to rest five years of enmity in the lead-up to the World Cup, in which Prince Mohammed had boycotted Qatar and severed ties.\nThat row is now firmly over and the Saudi victory was being received around the region as an achievement the Arab world could swing in behind. In South America, though, the reaction was markedly different.\nThere was shock and despair in Argentina as the final whistle went nearly 14,000km away in Qatar. The Argentinian football magazine Ol\u00e9 lamented what it called \u201ca world-wide whammy\u201d.\nThe newspaper Clar\u00edn said Argentina\u2019s players had suffered \u201ca historic walloping\u201d after becoming \u201centangled in Saudi Arabia\u2019s spider\u2019s web\u201d.\n\u201cIncredible,\u201d Ol\u00e9 announced beside a photograph of Lionel Messi cradling his face in his hands.\nThe football writer Diego Macias called the result \u201ca hammer blow \u2026 the likes of which will leave a long-lasting mark\u201d.\n\u201cArgentina lost much more than a game against Saudi Arabia,\u201d Macias wrote. \u201cIt forgot its footballing principles in the changing room and began the World Cup in the worst possible way.\u201d\nIn neighbouring Brazil, fans rejoiced over their arch footballing rival\u2019s dismal performance. A reworked version of Argentina\u2019s triband flag \u2013 in which the yellow sun at the centre wept uncontrollably \u2013 went viral on social media.\n\u201cWhat an embarrassment, Argentina,\u201d tweeted the football commentator Luis Felipe Freitas.\nBrazilian newspapers pronounced Argentina the World Cup\u2019s first \u201czebra\u201d \u2013 a Portuguese expression that roughly translates as an unfathomable upset. \u201cPigs flew!\u201d said Rio\u2019s O Globo newspaper.\nAllies of Brazil\u2019s outgoing far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, meanwhile, blamed the fiasco on Argentina\u2019s leftist leaders.\n\u201cSocialism in Argentina has shattered the behaviour of its citizens to such an extent that they lost to Saudi Arabia in the cup,\u201d tweeted the congressman and broadcaster Bibo Nunes. \u201cWhat you get with socialism/communism is a wasteland.\u201d"

                    "body": "Sadio Man\u00e9\u2019s leg injury is not \u201ctoo serious\u201d and the Senegal international should be fit for the World Cup in Qatar, Bayern Munich\u2019s assistant coach Dino Toppm\u00f6ller said. Man\u00e9 had to leave the pitch after 20 minutes of Bayern\u2019s 6-1 win over Werder Bremen on Tuesday. The forward will key to Senegal\u2019s hopes at the World Cup, where they face the Netherlands in their Group A opener, followed by Qatar and Ecuador.  \u201cSadio Man\u00e9 was hit on the leg, which caused him a little nerve pain,\u201d Toppm\u00f6ller said. \u201cNothing too serious and his participation in the World Cup should not be in jeopardy.\u201d Bayern\u2019s head coach, Julian Nagelsmann, said the two-times African Footballer of the Year would undergo scans. \u201cI can\u2019t say anything for sure, he took a blow to the head of his shin,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s an unpleasant spot, it radiates a bit into the muscles. I think he has to go to the X-ray to see if there is something there, because it is splintering easily. But I hope that nothing is wrong. I can\u2019t say anything for sure yet.\u201d Without Man\u00e9, the Bundesliga leaders Bayern still blew Werder away, scoring four goals in the first half, with Jamal Musiala getting the first in the sixth minute before Serge Gnabry scored either side of a strike from Leon Goretzka. Anthony Yunh had equalised for Werder four minutes after Bayern\u2019s opener but the champions took control from there, despite the loss of Man\u00e9. Gnabry completed his hat-trick in the 82nd minute before the 17-year-old Mathys Tel scored a late sixth. Wolfsburg scored at the start and at the end to battle past Borussia Dortmund 2-0, stretching their unbeaten run to seven consecutive matches and ending their opponents\u2019 three-game winning streak. Wolfsburg\u2019s Micky van de Ven nodded in at the far post from a corner after six minutes. Dortmund hit the post in first half stoppage time with Niklas S\u00fcle but it was the hosts who again had the better chances in the second half.  The Wolves, who had lost their previous seven home games to Dortmund, sealed their first win over the visitors in seven years with a Lukas Nmecha tap-in in stoppage time. Gerard Piqu\u00e9 was shown a red card in his final match before retiring as Barcelona fought back to win 2-1 at Osasuna despite the striker Robert Lewandowski also being sent off in the first half. Piqu\u00e9 was a substitute but was dismissed after remonstrating with the referee at half-time, after the red card for Lewandowski. David Garc\u00eda had headed Osasuna into the lead from a corner in the sixth minute but Pedri equalised from a rebound right after the break and Raphinha came off the bench to score Bar\u00e7a\u2019s winner five minutes from time, with a brilliant dipping header from outside the box that looped over the goalkeeper into the net.  Barcelona will go into the World Cup break top of La Liga on 37 points, five ahead of second-placed Real Madrid, who will host second-bottom C\u00e1diz on Thursday. The Serie A leaders, Napoli, extended their league winning streak to 10 games when they beat Empoli 2-0 at home thanks to a goal and an assist from the substitute Hirving Lozano. Napoli broke the deadlock when Lozano converted a penalty in the 70th minute after the Empoli midfielder Razvan Marin tripped Victor Osimhen inside the box. Empoli\u2019s Sebastiano Luperto was sent off after picking up a second yellow card for tripping Lozano in the 74th minute, before the Mexican then crossed for Piotr Zielinski, who found the net in the 88th minute. Napoli top the table with 38 points after 14 games, and got a further boost on Tuesday with second-placed Milan only managing a 0-0 draw at strugglers Cremonese. Argentina\u2019s Giovani Lo Celso has been ruled out of the World Cup with a hamstring injury for which the midfielder, on loan from Tottenham, requires surgery. The 26-year-old was replaced during Villarreal\u2019s La Liga loss against Athletic Bilbao on 30 October and scans confirmed that Lo Celso suffered a hamstring tear."

                    "body": "THE ITCH IS BACK\nYour super, soaraway Football Daily always looks forward to Black Friday. Unashamed dopamine fiend that we are, we\u2019ll never tire of watching viral videos of adults (sic) brawling doggedly over an immersive multi-room speaker system they don\u2019t need or particularly want, and which was 50 notes cheaper when they walked straight past it a week earlier. Today, that entertainment will be supplemented by Fifa\u2019s new post-Thanksgiving celebration: Bloke Friday, in which a load of men play a load of football in front of crowds made up of a load of men.\nIt\u2019s the start of the second round of group games at the Human Rights World Cup, and yes the last five days really have flown by. There are four more matches, which means six hours of entertainment, or 17 if you include added time. Iran\u2019s dramatic win over Wales is followed by Qatar 0-2 Senegal and Netherlands 1-0 Ecuador, which, depending on results, could end with Qatar becoming the first team eliminated from their own tournament. Then it\u2019s the biggish one. England v USA! USA!! USA!!! Tommy Shelby v Tony Soprano. Mark Corrigan v George Costanza. Barely suppressed self-loathing v barely suppressed self-loathing. England have never beaten the USMNT at a World Cup \u2013 they lost unthinkably/hilariously in 1950 and drew 1-1 in 2010, when the unfortunate Robert Green made a career-defining howler and ITV missed England\u2019s only goal because they cut to a Hyundai advert. The good news for UK-based viewers is that Friday\u2019s game is being shown on \u2026 wait, never mind. At least you\u2019ll have Roy Keane.\nAnd at least \u2013 pick this segue out \u2013 England will have Harry Kane. Despite the prattle of wounded ankle over the past few days, he has been given the all-clear. Gareth Southgate is expected to follow the established footballing wisdom that you\u2019d have to be a bit of an ostentatious oddball to change a team that has just won 6-2. USA! USA!! USA!!! \u2013 excellent in the first half against Wales before the unwelcome revelation that their kryptonite is a big old boy from the English Riviera with a Welsh grandfather \u2013 should provide a sterner test.\n\nAnother England triumph will now secure a last-16 place with a game to spare. We\u2019ll be honest, though, we\u2019re not on top of our game at the moment as our mind is elsewhere. Football Daily thought it was safe to relax and stop planning trips to a digital bunker in the Kerguelen Islands when England lost the Not Euro 2020 final to Italy. That was their chance, it\u2019s gone, thanks be to Donnarumma. But the way they shredded Iran has got the It\u2019s Coming Home itch, or the ITCH itch as we loathingly call it, going again. If England handsomely win against the kind of resourceful, athletic, dispiritingly competent team they usually draw 1-1 against at major tournaments, we\u2019ll know things are serious. And if they lose, #SouthgateOut will be trending before ITV have had a chance to cut to the scheduled commercials. It\u2019s not only Black Friday that makes adults (sic) behave like eejits.\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\n\u201cIt was the wrong decision \u2026 It was actually a foul against us. If somebody scores a goal, congratulations. But this was a gift. A special gift from the referee\u201d \u2013 Ghana coach Otto Addo is not a happy chappy after Cristiano Ronaldo controversially won a penalty that kickstarted Portugal\u2019s 3-2 HRWC victory. In converting it, Ronaldo became the first man to score at five World Cups.\n\nFOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS\n\nJust a quick question. While Fifa and Qatar are being quite rightly slated (the former for its corruption, the latter for its human rights record) over this HRWC, why is no one questioning the record of the countries of seven other nations (25%) who are represented? In these countries \u2018homosexuality\u2019 is also illegal. If we continue to bang the drum against Qatar (and we undoubtedly should), shouldn\u2019t we also be highlighting human rights injustices in the countries of the teams playing?\u201d \u2013 Merv Evans.\n\n\nMay I be the first of 1,057 readers to congratulate I\u00f1aki Williams on bringing pantomime season to the HRWC? In the week that Glasgow\u2019s Tron Theatre\u2019s panto opened (shameless plug for old school pal, apologies), Williams ensured a thousand cries of \u2018He\u2019s behind you!\u2019 rang out across the globe. Even better, when he came in and got the ball, Williams prompted refrains of \u2018Is he going to score?\u2019 \u2026 \u2018Oh yes he is\u2019 \u2026 \u2018Oh no he\u2019s not\u2019 in one quick and simple slip. Surely such dedication to the panto trade is worthy of some sort of award?\u201d \u2013 James Thomson (and no others).\n\n\n\nI quite agree with Allastair McGillivray\u2019s plea (yesterday\u2019s Football Daily letters) that we don\u2019t adopt the horrendous kick-off countdown into our domestic game. But to give credit to our Fifa comedy overlords, it did provide a proper laugh in the opening game when the ref decided to ignore it and blow the whistle before the countdown reached zero. True dedication to find something new that this HRWC has managed to foul up along with everything else\u201d \u2013 Tim Clarke.\n\n\nWhile most teams on their days off at tournaments seem content to just play bingo or ride inflatables in the pool, I note from Big Website that our Gallic cousins have a much bigger project in mind\u201d \u2013 Tony Crawford.\n\nSend your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet Football Daily \u2013 while you can, hi Elon \u2013 via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of our prizeless letter o\u2019 the day is \u2026 Merv Evans.\n\nThis is an extract from our daily football email \u2026 Football Daily.

                    "body": "Elated Morocco fans celebrated on the streets of London on Tuesday night following their team\u2019s triumph over Spain in the last 16 of the World Cup. Footage showed crowds of people around Oxford Street, Piccadilly Circus and Edgware Road chanting, dancing and waving Moroccan flags after the result. Morocco won 3-0 on penalties after the final whistle went without either side managing to score a goal.  It is the first time Morocco, or any Arab nation, has reached the last eight of the World Cup finals. They are also the first African team to reach the quarter-finals since Ghana in 2010, with only Cameroon and Senegal having done so previously. It is the third successive major tournament \u2013 following the 2018 World Cup and the 2021 Euros \u2013 in which Spain, the 2010 World Cup champion, have been knocked out on penalties. Describing the scenes on Edgware Road, Jahmell-Hasan Rhys Campbell, a 21-year-old student from London, said: \u201cIt was incredible. There were lots of flags everywhere. Not just Moroccan flags but flags of almost every African nation. \u201cThe cars were beeping every second, people were dancing in the street and hanging out of their car windows. It was such a surreal experience. [There were] easily around 300 people.\u201d Lucie Bickerdike, 37, who watched the celebrations from the top deck of a passing bus, said everyone seemed \u201cin very high spirits\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t follow football closely so at first I wasn\u2019t sure what was happening,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were lots of car horns blaring all down the street, chanting, dancing, flares, and fireworks. At one point, a group boarded the bus singing and dancing, and then left again.\u201d Celebrations were also seen in cities across Spain, which has about 800,000 Moroccan residents. In Barcelona, Youssef Lotfi, a 39-year-old construction worker who was born in Morocco but moved to Spain as a child, said he loves both countries, but \u201ctoday is a day of joy for Moroccans and all the Arab world\u201d. \u201cMorocco is representing all the Arab world, all the African continent. That is beyond description, it is the most glorious part,\u201d he told the Associated Press. In a statement, the king of Morocco, Mohammed VI, sent his \u201cheartfelt congratulations\u201d to the players, who he said \u201cgave their all and blazed a trail throughout this great sporting event\u201d. \u201c[The team represents the] hopes and dreams of Moroccans in Morocco, Qatar, and all over the world,\u201d he said."

                    "body": "THE LEAVING OF LIVERPOOL The purported sale of Liverpool Football Club by Fenway Sports Group has sent whatever lies on the cliche continuum between a shockwave and a ripple through the world of football. Who will take control of one of the crown jewels of the English game? And when? And for how much? To which the answers are, erm, oh look, it\u2019s Worthington Cup week. Nobody knows anything yet, except that whatever finally happens, Liverpool fans will join those of Chelsea, Manchester City and Newcastle United in being expected to address complex contradictory emotional and geopolitical positions to a problem not of their own making, to the satisfaction of all the people wagging big fat self-righteous fingers in their faces. The luck of the draw meant that J\u00fcrgen Klopp got to give Tuesday\u2019s pre-Carabao press conference the body swerve, sending in poor Pep Lijnders to deal with any awkward questions instead. Despite gamely trying on several occasions to bring the conversation round to the match against Derby tomorrow night, Lijnders was repeatedly hauled back to the hot topic of the day. \u201cIt is nothing new for the club to find new owners,\u201d he began. \u201cThey are trying to take the club forward. I always know the owners act in the best interests of the club and always did. They always tried at least.\u201d At which point Bart Simpson came barrelling into the room with a celebratory cake.  That ringing endorsement from Lijnders was followed by a checklist of trophies, new stands and big-name contracts. It was all relevant to any serious analysis of FSG\u2019s achievements, though he could have saved an awful lot of time by simply asking \u201cRemember the spine of Brad Jones, Sotirios Kyrgiakos, Christian Poulsen and Milan Jovanovic?\u201d and leaving it at that. \u201cThey made a lot of good decisions,\u201d concluded Lijnders. \u201cThey tied down one of the best managers in the world.\u201d But as that manager said upon his arrival, it\u2019s not important what people think when you come in, but what they think when you leave, and FSG\u2019s final act will have a huge bearing on their legacy. Will they sell to Bahrain? Dubai? Bezos? Musk? When a faceless USA! USA!! USA!!! hedge fund is your least problematic potential option, you\u2019re facing a moral conundrum all right.

                    "body": "It was surely the defining moment of Gareth Southgate\u2019s year to date. The full-time whistle had blown on England\u2019s 4-0 Nations League defeat against Hungary at Molineux on 14 June \u2013 the country\u2019s heaviest home loss since 1928 \u2013 and the boos and howls from the stands were venomous.\nWhat Southgate did next summed up his strength of character, his nobility. He walked on to the pitch to applaud the fans who were jeering. Perhaps he thought he had sufficient credit in the bank, some kind of insulation, what with being England\u2019s most successful tournament manager of the modern era, of any era since Sir Alf Ramsey.\nThe volume of hatred towards Southgate only intensified. By the press box a man bellowed abuse, eyes wide with rage, and he was a long way from being alone. It was Southgate who felt the isolation because, when his players walked around to give sheepish waves, they were met with applause from the fans who had stayed. This is England and this is the life of the manager. It is all on him when things go bad.\n\nAt the Football Association there was shock. The hierarchy do not feel that Southgate gets the respect he deserves from a section of the supporter base and they could not believe how quickly things had turned. Before England kicked off their Nations League campaign against Hungary in Budapest on 4 June \u2013 when they were beaten 1-0 \u2013 they had won 18 of 22 matches, losing only once, which was the penalty shootout defeat by Italy in the Euro 2020 final.\nSouthgate himself was shaken. Did he really need all of this? Four days previously he had told a group of journalists that he would not outstay his welcome in the job, which appeared to hint that he could be entering his England end-game. It was after the 1-1 draw with Germany in Munich and just before the 0-0 with Italy, also at Molineux.\nSouthgate is sensitive to the tides of public opinion, even what is written about him in the newspapers \u2013 the \u201cnoise\u201d as he has called it. The Hungary humiliation put him firmly on the back foot and there is no doubt that the mood from the summer has tracked him to Qatar for the World Cup, despite his attempts to highlight the mitigating factors, which essentially boiled down to the players being scrambled after a long season.\nSouthgate truly needed a tonic in September but he did not get it, the team losing 1-0 against Italy in Milan and drawing 3-3 with Germany at Wembley when they did at least rally from 2-0 down to go 3-2 up. It rounded off a dismal Nations League campaign, in which England were relegated from the top tier, and it has fed a narrative that has pressed down on Southgate from outside the camp.\nThe goodwill towards him has seeped away. The team has grown stale. And he is the problem. For Southgate it is now or never in Qatar.\nThe FA does not see it that way. It has Southgate under contract until December 2024, having agreed an extension in November of last year. The idea is that he will also have a shot at Euro 2024 in Germany, with the extra six months on the deal meaning there would be no unhelpful speculation about his future leading up to the tournament. Southgate could then help to smooth the transition to his successor.\nFrom the FA\u2019s point of view it has hit the jackpot with Southgate. After the missteps and scandals with previous managers, it has the consummate statesman, measured and at ease on any subject, almost never taking the wrong line. An excellent man-manager, he has also delivered results.\nThe FA is always looking at contingencies and would be open to an overseas successor to Southgate, with the British field looking slim at present. There was surprise within the organisation when the Rugby Football Union chief executive, Bill Sweeney, said the \u201cpreference\u201d would be to replace Eddie Jones with an English coach. Why would he limit the choice?\nThe FA would be massively reluctant to sack Southgate after the World Cup unless the team absolutely bombed and even then it would probably be a mutual decision. It feels as though the onus would be on Southgate to consider whether to press on.\n\nIf it is to be the 52-year-old\u2019s last dance with England, then he would be at peace with that. Southgate has eyes only on the challenge over the next month, which begins against Iran on Monday. He was able to move on after the Hungary debacle, to regain his sense of perspective. It is now about embracing the moment, the tremendous opportunity.\nSouthgate cannot care that his left-leaning sensibilities grate with some fans or that his playing style is perceived as overly cautious. Defending with all 11 men wins international tournaments and Southgate has to be more bothered about regaining the defensive solidity and balance of 2021 when his team kept 14 clean sheets. This year there have been two.\nAs for the theory about Southgate needing to win the World Cup or be branded a failure, that it is the only available option after reaching the semi-finals last time and then the Euro final, it is ludicrous. The tournament feels wide open, with about eight countries in with a chance \u2013 including England. But to believe that Southgate\u2019s team will do it, have to do it, is to be guilty of a comical case of exceptionalism. England do have lots of talent. They also have gaps which are not all Southgate\u2019s fault.\nThe FA has done everything to get the squad\u2019s base in Qatar right. The hotel, the Souq Al Wakra, is unprepossessing by previous England standards, feeling more four star than the five it has. But it is private and tranquil, set by a lovely stretch of beach and calming waters, benefiting from being outside Doha. It feels ideal. The pristine training pitch at the Al-Wakrah Sports Club is a five-minute drive away.\n\nWhat Southgate has done so successfully is to finesse the environment within his squad, creating one free of suspicion and club rivalry; the players want to join up and express themselves. Listen to any of them and they will invariably highlight the togetherness, the lack of individual ego. It is a platform for good things.\nThere has been much fretting about the poor form of certain likely starters \u2013 especially Harry Maguire and Raheem Sterling \u2013 but others are in fine touch, chief among them Kieran Trippier, Jude Bellingham, Bukayo Saka and Harry Kane. Luke Shaw has got his groove back after a difficult start to the season. Phil Foden has had good games.\nThere has been a strange vibe in Qatar this week; so quiet with the World Cup so close. There are banners and flags and there is plenty of Fifa\u2019s mauve signage but no atmosphere, no electricity, although it must be said that the volunteers are friendly to the point of their lives depending on it.\nSouthgate\u2019s challenge is also unusual: to prepare his 26 players in next to no time with each needing different fitness programmes to correspond to their seasons so far.\nConfidence is high. Those who have spoken to the media have not been afraid to embrace the levels of expectation, to declare that England can win. In the past there has almost always been something that goes wrong; a rush of blood, a missing detail, a lack of in-game management. Southgate knows that he has to be perfect."

                    "body": "Not even the World Cup break looks like slowing Newcastle\u2019s pursuit of Champions League football and, as Eddie Howe\u2019s team climbed into second place in the Premier League, Brendan Rodgers even suggested they should \u201cabsolutely\u201d be considered title contenders.\nEarly goals from Chris Wood, from the penalty spot, Miguel Almir\u00f3n and Joelinton brought Newcastle a sixth successive league win against one of the division\u2019s previous in-form teams, for whom the six-week international break in Qatar clearly came at a bad time.\n\nThe teams meet again in the Carabao Cup quarter-final in a fortnight but, with a trip to Arsenal, the leaders, next Tuesday, Newcastle\u2019s priorities may have moved beyond one-off silverware by then. \u201cWe can do anything,\u201d Howe said. \u201cThe season is still young enough for all possibilities to exist for us. I want the fans to believe we can do anything.\u201d\nWhile the Newcastle manager was more restrained in his briefing with the written media, his Leicester counterpart believes there is no reason why they cannot compete for the title. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cHaving watched them through this season, and today, obviously they have got that hunger to be there, with a point to prove. Making a good start gives you the belief you can stay there. They\u2019ve signed top players \u2026 and got some great results.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason why they can\u2019t be [involved in the title discussion] and if they can make the right additions in January, so they have cover for certain players, and keep players fit, then with the fanatical fanbase up there, they can have a great chance.\u201d\n\nRodgers criticised his players for their slow start to the game \u2013 \u201cOur attitude was really poor\u201d \u2013 and now has to contend for a longer period without James Maddison, the subject of a \u00a340m bid from Newcastle last summer, who has suffered a setback from the knee injury that curtailed his involvement with England in Qatar.\nLeicester\u2019s form going into the World Cup had actually been as brilliant as Newcastle\u2019s; they also averaged two points a game after they had been bottom with one point from their first eight games. But it was Howe\u2019s team who picked up where they had left off as they went 2-0 up inside seven minutes.\nEuphoric chants of \u201cWe\u2019re going to win the league\u201d rang out from the black and white corner of the King Power Stadium as Newcastle responded to the disappointment of losing Callum Wilson to illness by seeing Wood, his replacement, fire them into the lead after Daniel Amartey tripped Joelinton in the area after 85 seconds.\n\nThe former Leicester striker kept his nerve to smack his penalty straight down the middle \u2013 none of this waiting to see where the goalkeeper is going \u2013 for his third goal of the season. The centre of defence is one area in Leicester\u2019s squad Rodgers is keen to replenish come the opening of the transfer window next week but they were too easily opened up all over throughout the first half.\nLuke Thomas was too accommodating as Almir\u00f3n received a long pass out wide and cut back inside on to his favoured left foot before playing a one-two with Bruno Guimar\u00e3es and steering home his ninth goal of the season, equalling his tally for the previous four campaigns, with his left foot.\nTo add injury to insult, Leicester lost Danielennis Praet, Maddison\u2019s deputy, in the 17th minute, but as they briefly played their way back into the game in the middle of the pitch. Patson Daka was unlucky not to pull a goal back when he nicked the ball past Nick Pope but fell as the ball rebounded off him but not over the line.\nNewcastle went 3-0 up in the 32nd minute for the first time in an away game in the Premier League in 15 years when Joelinton rose above Boubakary Soumar\u00e9 to head home Kieran Trippier\u2019s corner.\n\nWood could have made the half-time scoreline even more embarrassing but he lofted Joe Willock\u2019s pullback on to the top of the net just before the break.\nIt was no surprise when Jamie Vardy was summoned from the substitutes\u2019 bench for the second half as Leicester sought a way back into the game. Rodgers made some tactical changes as he paired Vardy and Harvey Barnes up front, with Ayoze P\u00e9rez playing in a No 10 role, and was able to make some inroads in behind Dan Burn down Newcastle\u2019s left. But the nearest they came to getting a goal back came when Sven Botman\u2019s clearance ricocheted off Burn for a corner.\nNow four points above the relegation zone, Leicester head to Liverpool on Friday."

                    "body": "Spanish-speaking soccer fans of a certain age have grown up listening to broadcasters refer to the US men\u2019s national team as \u201cel equipo de todos\u201d \u2013 everyone\u2019s team, representing the diverse cultural backgrounds that make up America. But the 26-player US squad for this year\u2019s World Cup, which kicks off on 20 November, has just three players representing the Latinos and Latinas who provide a considerable share of the game\u2019s supporters in the US.\nForward Jesus Ferreira moved from Colombia to Texas when he was 10, midfielder Cristian Roldan\u2019s parents are from El Salvador and Honduras, and Gio Reyna\u2019s grandfather is Argentinian. Luca de la Torre, whose father is Spanish, provides another Hispanic presence, but he isn\u2019t Latino. And one would have to stretch the definition of Latino to count Kellyn Acosta, whose paternal step-grandfather is Mexican. Ricardo Pepi, the Mexican American striker who settled a heated battle over his services by choosing the US over his family\u2019s native country, was left out.\nManager Gregg Berhalter\u2019s choices will face little scrutiny if his team get out of a group with England, Wales and Iran. But, for now, his selections have sparked a discussion about whether the roster reflects America\u2019s 62 million-plus Latinos, most of whom identify as soccer fans and who drove a 52% growth in interest for the sport in recent years, according to a report commissioned by Telemundo.\n\nSome of North America\u2019s best-known experts on soccer are inclined to give Berhalter the benefit of the doubt at this stage though.\nAfter all, Berhalter is hardly to blame for the way soccer operates in the US. The expense associated with participating in US youth soccer often sets up white, affluent children to thrive. The best of those players also frequently have European backgrounds \u2013 and EU passports \u2013 that let them seek opportunities in Europe\u2019s high-caliber leagues without requiring clubs to give them one of a limited number of spots for players coming from outside the continent. \nIn any case, it is not just coaches who decide who represents the US. Martin Vasquez, who played for the US and Mexico as well as acting as an assistant coach for the USMNT, says that dual nationals often choose to represent El Tri over the Stars and Stripes (he was able to play for both nations as his matches for Mexico were not Fifa sanctioned).\n\u201cIt\u2019s individual decisions, and not that the players aren\u2019t given opportunities,\u201d Vasquez tells the Guardian.\nAt least three players who had a chance at making the US squad for this year\u2019s World Cup instead chose to represent Mexico: goalkeeper David Ochoa, midfielder Efrain Alvarez and defender Julian Araujo. As it happens, none of the three made the final Mexico squad announced on Monday\n\nThe recruiting battles over Pepi, Ochoa, Alvarez and Araujo are not only an extension of an intense on-field rivalry between the US and Mexico. They also symbolize the complex dynamics that go into which side not only to root for, but in some cases who to play for, when players have ties to both countries.\nNow the coach of USL League One\u2019s Central Valley Fuego FC, the Mexican-born Vasquez got to know Araujo, Ochoa and Alvarez and tried to recruit them for the US. He understands their plight well, having lived it and \u2013 during his time as a USMNT assistant to J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann \u2013 having worked with others who had experienced it as well, including Omar Gonzalez, Herculez Gomez and Jose Torres, all of whom had Mexican roots.\n\u201cThey all had dreams of representing the US or Mexico and going to a World Cup,\u201d Vasquez says. \u201cWhat influenced me [to switch sides] was the better chance to be taken to a World Cup \u2013 on-field opportunity, in other words.\u201d\nAnd it\u2019s what has happened on the pitch in the months leading up to the World Cup that has hurt the chances of some of the USMNT\u2019s Latino players. Pepi is a prime example. After the teenager scored 13 goals for FC Dallas in 2021 (as well as three more for the US), he moved to Bundesliga side Augsburg in January 2022 for a reported fee of $20m \u2013 and didn\u2019t net once in 16 appearances. He has enjoyed more success on loan to Dutch side Groningen \u2013 with seven goals in 10 appearances \u2013 but Berhalter has made clear that he is unimpressed with the Dutch league\u2019s quality. Instead he chose Norwich City\u2019s Josh Sargent, whose experience in the rough-and-tumble English Championship could be valuable with matches against England and Wales looming.\nSome Latino \u201ccandidates just didn\u2019t perform well,\u201d says journalist Jon Arnold, who publishes the newsletter Getting Concacaf\u2019ed. \u201cI\u2019m not sure there\u2019s that many players that are \u2026 really in the mix.\u201d\nThat\u2019s a position echoed by Luis Omar Tapia, the chief commentator of the Spanish-language broadcaster TUDN. Tapia believes the 19-year-old Pepi\u2019s switch from Major League Soccer to the Bundesliga was premature, and the accompanying reduction in playing time \u2013 as well as the loan spell \u2013 in effect ended his Qatari dreams.\n\u201cPepi left when he shouldn\u2019t have,\u201d says Tapia. \u201cAnd that\u2019s affected everything.\u201d\nBut perhaps Qatar isn\u2019t the goal anyway. Arnold and Tapia point out that Pepi will be 23 and approaching his prime when the US co-host the 2026 World Cup alongside Canada and, appropriately enough, Mexico. Other USMNT players will be in their peak years by then, including Christian Pulisic, Reyna, Sergi\u00f1o Dest and Weston McKinnie, making a deep run at the tournament realistic, something that could draw talented dual nationals away from Mexico and towards the US.\nArnold believes a player like Alejandro Zendejas of Mexico\u2019s Club America, who\u2019s set off a Pepi-like recruitment battle after representing El Tri at youth level, could factor in upcoming USMNT matches. And Tapia says he has information that FC Cincinnati striker Brandon Vasquez prefers the USMNT over Mexico, despite having eligibility for both.\nFor now, Amelia Lopez of the Marketing Jersey sports consultancy and management agency says she doesn\u2019t believe attracting Latino and Latina fans to the USMNT is simply a matter of selecting more Hispanic players. The backgrounds \u2013 soccer or otherwise \u2013 of the few Latinos rostered for this World Cup could not be more diverse, underlining the fact that America\u2019s Hispanics aren\u2019t a monolith. Why, for example, would a Honduran-American fan cheer specifically for an Argentinian-American like Reyna when their roots are in countries thousands of miles apart?\n\u201cAttempting to properly connect with one part of the community oftentimes means you\u2019re disregarding another,\u201d says Lopez, who supports Mexico over the US because of her father\u2019s love for El Tri. \u201cI think that is where US soccer will have to decide whether the lack of representation is a necessary consequence or a problem worth rectifying.\u201d\nYet Tapia and Vasquez have no problem with how things are. Vasquez hopes both of his nations make deep runs in Qatar. As for Tapia, Chile, where he was born, didn\u2019t qualify for Qatar, so he\u2019s all in with the USMNT, saying it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise for the team to make the quarter-finals.\nTapia says his \u201csegundo equipo\u201d \u2013 or second team \u2013 has long been the US. \u201cMy two daughters were born here, my four grandchildren were born here, I moved here when I was 14, and my whole career has been here,\u201d he says. \u201cI always want the US to win, \u2026 and I think this team can.\u201d"

                    "body": "Golden generation. The eyes must roll every time that loaded description is mentioned in Belgium circles but there it is, from Eden Hazard no less, in a Fifa promotional video for the World Cup in which the Real Madrid man insists this incarnation has delivered on account of a third-place finish in Russia four years ago. Roberto Mart\u00ednez concurs, although that is no great surprise from a master of positive spin who once described an Everton player\u2019s broken leg as \u201ca great opportunity\u201d and every set of results going against Wigan in their fight for Premier League survival as good for his players\u2019 mindset. They were relegated the next day courtesy of a 4-1 defeat at Arsenal.\nRevisit Belgium\u2019s performance in 2018, however, and it does seem churlish to dismiss Hazard\u2019s and Mart\u00ednez\u2019s point entirely. Beating England for a second time in the tournament to win the third-place playoff meant something, as the jubilant reaction in the dugout and on the pitch demonstrated. It meant Belgium\u2019s best placing at a World Cup, eclipsing the achievement of the Enzo Scifo, Jan Ceulemans, Eric Gerets and Jean-Marie Pfaff generation who finished fourth in Mexico in 1986. And it meant a great deal to the thousands of fans who packed the Grand-Place in Brussels, turning the air black, yellow and red with their flares as they gave the squad a triumphant homecoming. There was no sign of disappointment that day with a golden generation being unmasked as bronze.\nFour years on Belgium bring expectation into a World Cup again, albeit accompanied by reservations rather than the conviction this gifted group can go one step further. Several of the original cast members have gone \u2013 including Vincent Kompany, Marouane Fellaini and Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, plus Nacer Chadli, who underlined the value of a selfless squad player when scoring the 94th-minute winner that sealed a thrilling 3-2 comeback win over Japan in the last 16.\n\nSeveral ageing originals remain \u2013 mainly concentrated in defence where Mart\u00ednez remains reliant on the 33-year-old Toby Alderweireld and 35-year-old Jan Vertonghen. Last summer\u2019s European Championship brought defeat in the quarter-finals by the eventual winners Italy, when Belgium ran out of options and ideas. This year has brought two defeats by the Netherlands in the Nations League, the first a comprehensive 4-1 reverse on home soil after Romelu Lukaku had departed injured with the game goalless. \u201cThis is what we needed to prepare for the World Cup,\u201d said Mart\u00ednez, true to form, of Belgium\u2019s first loss to the Netherlands for 25 years.\nDoubts continue to surround the fitness of Lukaku, who has made only two brief substitute appearances for Internazionale since injuring a hamstring in the summer and has been receiving daily treatment in the buildup to day\u2019s opener against Canada. Belgium\u2019s prospects are closely aligned to the availability of their leading goalscorer but there is validity to their belief as well as the concerns. Mart\u00ednez\u2019s squad remains packed with title-winning experience, possesses some world-class talent and an emerging crop who hope to replenish the golden stock. They include Amadou Onana, whom Everton signed in a deal worth up to \u20ac40m from Lille this summer and who exudes confidence that his first World Cup can result in the ultimate triumph in Qatar.\n\n\u201cWhy not? That is the ambition we have,\u201d says the 21-year-old. \u201cWe have a very good mix. We have very experienced players; I\u2019m talking about Kevin De Bruyne, Eden Hazard, Thibaut Courtois, Romelu and others. I think we have a great mix. Talking about pressure \u2013 I don\u2019t feel no pressure. We have a great team. Of course we have to take it in a very serious way and not just think: \u2018We are Belgium and we\u2019re going to make it anyway,\u2019 but I am quite confident.\u201d\nDe Bruyne is a major reason for Onana\u2019s optimism. The younger midfielder venerates his senior teammate, and to whoever is in his company. \u201cHe is one of the best players in the world. That is my opinion,\u201d Onana says. \u201cFor me, and I have been saying this is the locker room at Everton, he does things that no one else can do. I would give him the Ballon d\u2019Or. If it depended on me I would give it to him. He is a crazy player and I enjoy having the chance to share the pitch with him.\u201d\n\nThe Manchester City playmaker is 31 and has indicated this could be his last chance to win a World Cup. That is certainly true of Vertonghen and Alderweireld, while Courtois and Lukaku, who will be 34 and 33 respectively by the time the 2026 tournament kicks off, may also view Qatar as a final farewell in their prime. Onana believes the golden age could last until the United States, Canada and Mexico in four years\u2019 time, however. \u201cYou will have to ask them if it is their last World Cup,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I would be pleased to keep playing with them because they are great, great players. And they are great professionals.\u201d\nOnana admits it will be the realisation of \u201ca dream to play in a World Cup\u201d and the completion of a plan that involved moving to the Premier League, establishing himself in the Everton team and winning selection for Mart\u00ednez\u2019s squad. There is a possibility he could come up against his Everton colleague Jordan Pickford, and England\u2019s No 1, in the final. \u201cI\u2019ll score against him\u201d he laughs. \u201cI\u2019m joking, but why not?\u201d"

                    "body": "Well, that was unexpected. After the cold, cold theatre of Qatar 2022\u2019s opening game, elite sport reimagined as a despot\u2019s light-show, something remarkable happened on Monday afternoon in Doha.\nAs night fell over the vast, swooping Khalifa International Stadium (all these World Cup structures are vast and swooping; unless specifically told otherwise, assume vast and swooping) England and Iran produced something that felt jarringly real, oddly warm, suspiciously authentic.\nAgainst all odds at this dislocated World Cup, a football match broke out. Albeit one shot through with its own layers of intrigue, and indeed pathos and horror.\nFirst the fun part. England were excellent in this group B opener: eager, fluent and fancy-free against a poor Iran team. A 6-2 victory is England\u2019s most thrillingly unbound start to any tournament ever. It almost feels a bit too much. Steady, chaps.\n\nHistory tells us stodgy, cautious stuff, cardigan-football is the way to go here. The 1966 World Cup kicked off with 0-0 draw against Uruguay so tedious the Guardian match report contains a whimsical digression on the writer\u2019s urge to drift off to sleep in the second half.\nInstead England produced something that felt a little transgressive in this most controlled of stages, tightening their grip in a bruising first half, before freewheeling downhill in the second with their feet up on the handlebars. Jude Bellingham, only 19, was sensationally good in central midfield, even against opponents who provided all the high-grade resistance of a beaded curtain. Bukayo Saka was spiky, sharp and adorably relentless.\nVictory leaves England in a position to drive through this group and on to the agonies to come. Better opponents than these will test this fun, peppy version, and indeed Southgate\u2019s own will to retain a progressive midfield. No matter. This, also feels like football.\n\nBecause of course there were layers here too. Welcome to Qatar 2022, a World Cup so contorted by wider push and pull you can almost feel the political actors at the side of pitch shunting their avatars about the turf with long wooden paddles.\nMuch will be made of Fifa banning England from wearing the bespoke armband of tolerance during this game. Harry Kane may take some flak for failing to press the point and insist. In reality he deserves our sympathy.\nThis has become a power-play between England, Fifa and the Qatari leadership. England\u2019s players have been very good on these issues. Kane himself is an unaffected and hugely committed advocate of the rainbow campaign. He doesn\u2019t have to be like this. It just comes naturally , in a way it doesn\u2019t to, say, the celebrity popinjay David Beckham. Kane is, most definitely, not part of the problem.\n\nIndeed, if this game deserved to commemorate anything it was perhaps the deaths of two people five years apart. Mahsa Amini was arrested by the Iran\u2019s morality police and died in hospital days later in September. Her crime was a breach of the country\u2019s strict dress rules. Her death was a spark for the ongoing popular uprising against the regime.\nZac Cox is an Englishman who died in January 2017 after falling 40 metres from rigging while installing a catwalk. This happened right here, in this same Khalifa Stadium. An English coroner has since described the working conditions that caused his death as \u201cchaotic, unprofessional, unthinking and downright dangerous\u201d.\nCox is significant in other ways. His death is one of the three \u2013 yes really: three \u2013 that the Qatari government has been willing to acknowledge as actually related to this vast vanity project. Other estimates put the toll at more than 6,500. It could be argued there is a note of shared significance to both deaths. Both feel like reminders that the real divide, so starkly present at this Pharaonic sporting super-show, is between the powerful and the powerless.\nThis week Fifa\u2019s morally invertebrate president, Gianni Infantino, gave a speech that attempted to paint his World Cup as a marker of a grand struggle between the bright new world and corrupt old Europe, with Infantino himself the Mandela at its centre. In reality Infantino has presided over a World Cup staged in a repressive state that has feasted on those who built its palaces, and has barely wagged a finger at Iran\u2019s regime in the lead up to their appearance here. This is not an east or west thing. It\u2019s a power thing.\n\nWith this in mind perhaps the most significant element of the afternoon was the sight of the Iranian players refusing to sing their own national anthem, a brave and powerful gesture.\nThere were some calls for England to boycott this game with the intention of shaming the dictatorship, but this is to misunderstand the dynamic.\nThe football team is not an extension of Iran\u2019s leaders, but is in fact the opposite, seen as an amplifier for freedom, group expression, modernity. It is no coincidence women have been banned from football grounds since 1979. The regime fears this thing, with its spontaneity and its sense of collectivism.\nIran\u2019s support duly kept up a drum-walloping din through the second half, even as England glossed the scoreline. And this is already the strangest of World Cups, a place where it is possible to nod approvingly at the improved staggered positioning of the England midfield; while also drinking in the joy of the gathered Iranians, a small note of victory in the wider battle of football against the enemy."

                    "body": "Human rights advocates have condemned the decision to allow Saudi Arabia\u2019s tourism authority to sponsor the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, calling it a \u201ctextbook case of sportswashing\u201d. Visit Saudi is set to join international brands such as Adidas, Coca-Cola and Visa in attaching their names to the 32-team tournament that is due to kick off on 20 July at Auckland\u2019s Eden Park. Despite Saudi Arabia\u2019s history of oppressing women\u2019s rights, Fifa has decided to ratify the deal under the new \u201ccommercial partnership structure\u201d dedicated to developing revenues specifically for the women\u2019s game. But the announcement has sparked criticism from human rights groups in Australia.  A spokesperson from Football Australia said they were seeking clarification from Fifa. \u201cWe are very disappointed that Football Australia were not consulted on this matter prior to any decision being made,\u201d they said. \u201cFootball Australia and New Zealand Football have jointly written to Fifa to urgently clarify the situation.\u201d  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free email newsletters for your daily news roundup  The director of global initiatives at Human Rights Watch, Minky Worden, said the decision showed a \u201cshocking disregard\u201d for the status of women in Saudi Arabia. \u201cIt is a shocking disregard of the suffering and ongoing repression of courageous women\u2019s rights defenders in Saudi Arabia, to award the Saudi state tourism company sponsorship of the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup,\u201d Worden said. \u201cIt is worth remembering that, as recently as 2018, women and girls in Saudi Arabia were not allowed to play sport in schools \u2013 or even to watch sports in stadiums. \u201cInstead of sportswashing with sponsorships to attempt to rehabilitate its global image, it would be far better for Saudi Arabia to undertake fundamental human rights reforms, including to uphold basic rights for women and girls.\u201d  A number of legal changes have been introduced in recent years in Saudi Arabia, including ending the ban on women driving and making amendments to the oppressive guardianship law that would allow, for the first time, women to apply for official documents such as a passport and to travel abroad independently. However, women still have to obtain male guardian permission to get married, leave prison, or obtain some forms of sexual and reproductive healthcare. Male guardians can also bring legal action against women for \u201cdisobedience\u201d and being absent from home. There are still reports of arrests of peaceful dissidents, public intellectuals and human rights activists. Dozens of Saudi human rights defenders and activists continue to serve long prison sentences for criticising authorities or advocating for political reforms. Nikita White, an Amnesty Australia campaigner, criticised Saudi authorities\u2019 human rights record. \u201cIt would be quite the irony for Saudi\u2019s tourism body to sponsor the largest celebration of women\u2019s sport in the world when you consider that, as a woman in Saudi Arabia, you can\u2019t even have a job without the permission of your male guardian,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Saudi authorities have a horrendous record of human rights abuses \u2013 including cracking down on women\u2019s rights defenders.  \u201cThe campaign of so-called reform leader Mohammed bin Salman has been on is nothing more than a publicity stunt to try to diversify the economy. The Saudi authorities sponsoring the Women\u2019s World Cup would be a textbook case of sport-washing.\u201d The director at the Australian Human Rights Institute, Prof Justine Nolan, condemned the move.  \u201cIt is evident that Fifa seems to have adopted a flexible approach to applying its human rights policy and that it is not taking a rigorous and holistic approach to respecting rights,\u201d she said. \u201cIts policy to respect universal human rights does not apparently extend to its sponsorship arrangements. \u201cThe acceptance of Saudi Arabia as a sponsor of the Women\u2019s World Cup \u2013 a country where women\u2019s rights are expressly inhibited \u2013 ensures rights take a backseat to money and sponsorship.\u201d The 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup hopes to accelerate the growth of the women\u2019s game across the world, with an expanded competition and a tournament split over two countries for the first time. On Monday, Fifa announced it had moved the opening match of the Australian leg to the 83,500-capacity Accor Australia stadium due to the huge demand for tickets. Fifa was contacted for comment. In other news, Saudi Arabia has been chosen as the 2027 men\u2019s Asian Cup hosts at the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) congress in Bahrain. It will mark Saudi Arabia\u2019s first staging of the event, with the decision confirmed after India, Iran, Qatar and Uzbekistan had earlier withdrawn from the bidding process. The Gulf state is thought to be very keen to host the men\u2019s World Cup in 2030, potentially in a joint bid alongside Greece and Egypt. Delegates at the AFC congress also re-elected the incumbent president, Bahrain\u2019s Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa, for another four-year term."

                    "body": "Well. About last night \u2026 to describe the conclusion of the group stages of this World Cup as crazy feels a bit like calling the residents of Arkham Asylum merely eccentric. For three minutes on Thursday, Costa Rica\u2019s lead over Germany would have meant Spain were heading home, with the coach Luis Enrique mercifully in the dark about this potential outcome. \u201cIf I\u2019d have known,\u201d he reflected mildly afterwards, \u201cI would have had a heart attack.\u201d It was certainly the evening for it.\nITV\u2019s Graeme Souness appeared to be suffering from a number of baroque medical conditions as he \u201canalysed\u201d the notion that the ball did not go out of play before Japan\u2019s crucial second goal against Spain. Graeme\u2019s conniption swiftly tipped over into such deep conspiracy theory that he is expected to follow his stint in Qatar with a secondment to Donald Trump\u2019s stop-the-steal campaign. \u201cWhy have we not seen the evidence?\u201d the studio\u2019s Oliver Stone kept demanding rhetorically.\nShould Souness find the siren call of US wingnuttery impossible to resist before the end of this tournament, he could perhaps be more competently replaced by any one of the rush of viewers who created their own at-home videos showing a ball which from one angle looked like it was wholly in their kitchen, but from another angle was actually revealed to still have an edge crossing over on to their living room carpet. Witchcraft. Sheer witchcraft.\n\nThen again, it has all been highly watchable. Only Fifa could survey the WTF-fuelled mayhem of this World Cup\u2019s group stages and be entertaining talks to abandon the four-team format. Sporticidal maniac Gianni Infantino has been spearheading these discussions since 2016, when he rubber-stamped the 48-team World Cup as part of his organisation\u2019s absolute commitment to the principle of quantity not quality. As things stand, plans have been under way to move instead to groups of three teams, with possible penalty shootouts to stop countries playing for results that favour them both. If you can\u2019t have quite the level of financial corruption you enjoyed for decades, then I guess you scratch the itch by corrupting the product instead. That said, more teams mean more money, so in Fifa terms you get a twofer. There are now hints that this sensationally appalling idea might be up for reconsideration, with backroom discussions in Qatar apparently increasingly open to the notion of four-team groups again, meaning the 2026 World Cup would clock in at just the 104 games.\n\nAnyway, all that is for another day, because England play Senegal in the round of 16 on Sunday, and the buildup finds The Country That Gave Football To The World TM managing its expectations like it manages its economy. Honestly, who\u2019d be Gareth Southgate? The sheer intensity of the ire directed at England\u2019s most successful manager since Alf Ramsey has for some time suggested that its most aggressive proponents are angry about a vast constellation of other things for which Southgate and his team serve as a convenient proxy.\nIt\u2019s notable that England\u2019s national football side is almost the last area of the public realm of which some people still have the highest expectations. Trust in every other institution has drained away over the past decade and beyond, with pretty much the last thing \u201cEngland expects\u201d being for England to win the World Cup. Arguably the most striking thing about the often-grotesque failures of state during the pandemic was the relative indifference to them. The country deserved better \u2013 of course it did \u2013 but what initially saved the Johnson administration was that the country clearly did not expect better. That distinctly declinist state of affairs meant that it was ultimately Boris Johnson\u2019s lying which did for him, and much later than a number of much deadlier charges might have done in a state with the luxury of higher standards.\n\nJohnson\u2019s mayfly successor Liz Truss and her chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, famously unveiled a budget that led the former US treasury chief Larry Summers to observe: \u201cThe UK is behaving a bit like an emerging market turning itself into a submerging market.\u201d Which is, at least, partway to it being just like watching Brazil. Although England (the country, not the football side) is unfortunately not even demonstrating any of the emerging market characteristics of high growth, high productivity, an expanding middle-class \u2026 maybe we\u2019ve just got the fantastically-high-expectations-in-football bit. Hey \u2013 it\u2019s a start.\nIn fact, for the preceding two major tournaments, it has been possible to observe tartly that England are one of those countries who can be described as \u201cplaying on despite the political turmoil back home\u201d. This World Cup doesn\u2019t look likely to have broken that run so far \u2013 although now they are entering the business end of their draw it does feel as if it would take an awful lot of luck for Southgate\u2019s side to appease the section of the fanbase which believes a World Cup win is the very least they could do, actually. A number of our madder notions of exceptionalism are in the process of being quietly abandoned after several years of wanton political and economic self-harm \u2013 perhaps football will end up the last remaining bastion of the tendency.\nIf it does all go tits-up for England on Sunday or beyond, maybe a quick stint on I\u2019m A Celebrity could rehabilitate Southgate in the public imagination for his hideous crime of possibly making substitutions too slowly. After all, a mere three weeks on the show took the infinitely greater transgressor Matt Hancock all the way to the threshold of the jungle throne in the public vote. It\u2019s a funny old country, isn\u2019t it? It would take more than a few homemade fan videos to penetrate its enduring mysteries. And I think, on balance, that I\u2019d prefer a full-blown Souness conspiracy theory to explain them than the rather less palatable reality.\nMarina Hyde\u2019s World Cup Week will appear each Friday during the tournament"

Wales were among the nations to U-turn on wearing the rainbow-coloured OneLove armband in support of LGBTQ+ rights after Fifa threatened sporting sanctions.\nFifa and the Qatari authorities have been in dialogue after the FAW sought urgent clarity over the circumstances that led to supporters being ordered to remove rainbow-coloured clothing if they were to enter the Ahmad bin Ali Stadium.\n\nThe FAW\u2019s chief executive, Noel Mooney, described Fifa\u2019s action over the armband as \u201ccheap\u201d and \u201cpretty low\u201d, adding: \u201cWe were told this was going to be a really inclusive, welcoming, warm World Cup. That is not what I have seen, I have to say. To have our fans having their bucket hats taken off them is just appalling. Their voice was taken away, the players\u2019 voices were taken away by the armband. For that we are deeply disappointed.\u201d\nBefore receiving assurances from Fifa on Thursday, Wales made a point of reiterating their inclusive message to fans by displaying rainbow-coloured flags at their Al Sadd Sports Club training base. A large rainbow flag is draped from a pitch-side tent and corner flags decorated with the Welsh dragon were changed in support of the LGBTQ+ community.\nAn FAW statement said: \u201cIn response to the FAW, Fifa has confirmed that fans with Rainbow Wall bucket hats and rainbow flags will be allowed entry to the stadium for Cymru\u2019s match against Iran on Friday. All World Cup venues have been contacted and instructed to follow the agreed rules and regulations. The FAW urges Fifa to adhere to their message that everybody will be welcome in Qatar during the World Cup and continue to highlight any further human rights issues.\u201d"

                    "body": "Good morning. Police have praised the individuals who tackled a gunman after he opened fire at an LGBTQ nightclub in Colorado Springs for their \u201cincredible act of heroism\u201d that stopped the tragedy that killed at least five people from being even worse. The mayor of Colorado Springs, John Suthers, told CNN that one or two individuals in the club moved quickly to \u201csubdue\u201d the shooter. At least 25 people were also injured in the attack. Suthers said police were on the scene by midnight and the incident was over by 12.02am. \u201cThat\u2019s largely because of the intervention of at least one, possibly two, very heroic individuals who subdued this guy,\u201d he said. \u201c[They] appear to have taken his handgun \u2026 and used it to disable him \u2026 not shoot him but hit him with the gun. \u201cBut for that, as tragic as this incident is, it\u2019s a horrible crime, it could have been much, much worse but for these heroic actors.\u201d  Who was the gunman? Police allege that 22-year-old Anderson Lee Aldrich went into Club Q at about 11.55pm on Saturday and immediately began shooting with a rifle. Do we know anything about the victims yet? According to reports, bartenders Daniel Davis Aston and Derrick Rump were two of the victims. Was the suspect motivated by hate against LGBTQ people? A motive has not officially been established yet. However, the attack took place at Club Q, a club that has a weekly drag show on Saturday evenings and had a drag brunch scheduled for Sunday morning, which was also the transgender day of remembrance. The attack came amid growing fears of violence and intimidation toward drag queens.  World still \u2018on brink of climate catastrophe\u2019 after Cop27 deal  The world still stands \u201con the brink of climate catastrophe\u201d after the deal reached at the Cop27 UN climate summit on Sunday, and the biggest economies must make fresh commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions, climate experts and campaigners have warned. The agreement reached in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, came after a marathon final negotiating session that ran 40 hours beyond its deadline, and was hailed for providing poor countries for the first time with financial assistance known as loss and damage. A fund will be set up by rich governments for the rescue and rebuilding of vulnerable areas stricken by climate disaster, a key demand of developing countries for the last 30 years of climate talks. But the outcome was widely judged a failure on efforts to cut carbon dioxide, after oil-producing countries and high emitters weakened and removed key commitments on greenhouse gases and phasing out fossil fuels. Mary Robinson, the chair of the Elders Group of former world leaders and former president of Ireland who twice served a UN climate envoy, said: \u201cThe world remains on the brink of climate catastrophe. Progress made on [cutting emissions] has been too slow.  Why wasn\u2019t the deal stronger? Oil-producing countries had thwarted attempts to strengthen the deal, said Laurence Tubiana, one of the architects of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, now chief executive of the European Climate Foundation. \u201cThe influence of the fossil fuel industry was found across the board,\u201d she said. She blamed the host country, Egypt, for allowing its regional alliances to sway the final decision, a claim hotly denied by the hosts.  Amy Coney Barrett urged to step away from gay rights case because of faith affiliation  Former members of Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s secretive faith group, the People of Praise, are calling on the US supreme court justice to recuse herself from an upcoming case involving gay rights, saying her continued affiliation with the Christian group means she has participated in discriminatory policies against LGBTQ+ people. The former members are part of a network of \u201csurvivors\u201d of the controversial group who say Barrett\u2019s \u201clifelong and continued\u201d membership make her too biased to fairly adjudicate an upcoming case that will decide whether private business owners have a right to decline services to potential clients based on their sexual orientation. The former members point to Barrett\u2019s former role on the board of Trinity Schools Inc, a private group of Christian schools that is affiliated with the People of Praise and, in effect, barred the admission of children of same-sex parents. A faculty guide published in 2015, the year Barrett joined the board, said \u201cblatant sexual immorality\u201d \u2013 which the guide said included \u201chomosexual acts\u201d \u2013 had \u201cno place in the culture of Trinity Schools\u201d. The discriminatory policies were in place before and after Barrett joined.  What is the upcoming case about? The case centers on a Christian website developer, Lori Smith, who has claimed an anti-discrimination law in Colorado has violated her right to free speech over same-sex marriage, which she says goes against her religious faith. Smith has said the Colorado law has forced her to \u201ccreate messages that go against my deeply held beliefs\u201d since she cannot legally turn away gay couples seeking her website services. When does the case go to the supreme court? The justices will hear oral arguments in the case of 303 Creative LLC v Elenis on 5 December.  In other news \u2026   Iran has arrested two prominent actors who expressed solidarity with the country\u2019s protest movement and removed their headscarves in public, according to state media. Hengameh Ghaziani and Katayoun Riahi were both summoned by prosecutors looking into their \u201cprovocative\u201d social media posts. Russian forces launched almost 400 strikes yesterday in Ukraine\u2019s east as part of a campaign of artillery fire, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said. Russia\u2019s surge in missile strikes in Ukraine is partly designed to exhaust Kyiv\u2019s supplies of air defenses and achieve dominance of the skies, a Pentagon official said. Mike Pence said the FBI \u201csent the wrong message\u201d with its search of Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago residence in August to retake government secrets that were stored there without authorization. The former vice-president made those remarks yesterday in an interview with the host of NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, Chuck Todd.

Qatar World Cup \u2013 get daily updates with First Thing Introducing a new daily update on the World Cup, written for First Thing readers by US sports editor Tom Lutz. On top of the daily summary you can find here, the Guardian has 14 journalists on the ground in Qatar and we\u2019ll have reports and analysis from all 64 games. We\u2019ll also be covering the political and social issues around the tournament, which you can find here. The World Cup kicked off yesterday although much of the focus has been on the host country\u2019s human rights record rather than the soccer itself. Qatar has been attacked for its treatment of migrant workers, allegations of corruption in the bidding process for the tournament and its record on LGBTQ and women\u2019s rights. That led to the Fifa president Gianni Infantino\u2019s bizarre defense of Qatar on Saturday, in which he depicted himself as a Christ-like figure standing up for the poor and downtrodden. Things weren\u2019t much better for the hosts on the field, as they lost the first match of the tournament to Ecuador. That came after an opening ceremony that featured the actor Morgan Freeman, a member of Korean boyband BTS and a cameo appearance from Russia, who have been banned from the tournament. Away from the stadium there was chaos as organizers allowed too many fans to enter viewing parties before kick-off. Fox Sports didn\u2019t see any problems though. TIt was criticized by fans for lavishing praise on Qatar and failing to mention human rights concerns in its opening broadcast. Qatar Airways, the country\u2019s state-owned airline, happens to be a major sponsor of Fox\u2019s World Cup coverage. Here\u2019s what to watch out for:  The tournament runs for four weeks, culminating in the final on 18 December. There are eight groups of four teams, with the top two teams from each group advancing to the knockout stage. Argentina, Brazil and France are the favorites. The US, in a group with England, Wales and Iran, have an outside chance of making the quarter-finals but it wouldn\u2019t be a huge surprise if they fail to win a game. The US start their campaign today. US deputy sports editor Bryan Graham is in Qatar and will be following the Americans throughout the tournament. He says they have a talented young team but injuries and a lack of form may cause them to struggle. They face Wales in their opener at 2pm ET, and you can follow the match with our liveblog, which will start an hour before kickoff here. We\u2019ll also have a match report at full-time and Bryan\u2019s thoughts on the game. The day\u2019s other games feature England v Iran (8am ET), and Senegal v Netherlands (11am ET). We\u2019ll have live coverage of both matches here.  Don\u2019t miss this: \u2018Why am I talking to 10 guys?\u2019 The rise and fall of dating apps  Swiping, benching, ghosting \u2026 Dating apps can be so cold, writes Annie Lord. We find connections and then we let them fall through our hands, we choose nights out with friends instead of date nights, we work too hard to make time to go out at all, we delete dating apps, redownload them and try again, then ignore the people we match with. It\u2019s not my fault and it\u2019s not the fault of the men I\u2019m approaching. It\u2019s dating as a whole. It\u2019s in crisis. Now that disgruntled singles are realising the best way to meet someone is in real life, will a new world of \u201coffline dating\u201d bring people back together? Climate check: Pacific leaders celebrate Cop27 victory on loss and damage fund after decades of advocacy  Pacific leaders and climate activists are celebrating the establishment of a loss and damage financing mechanism in the Cop27 agreement, three decades after they raised the need for such a provision. A loss and damage fund, which would provide financial assistance to poor nations stricken by climate disaster, has been a key ask of Pacific countries \u2013 which are among the most vulnerable to the impacts of the climate crisis \u2013 for decades in climate negotiations. It was first raised more than 30 years ago by Vanuatu, which the UN has ranked as the country most vulnerable to natural disasters. Last Thing: Christie\u2019s cancels T rex skeleton auction after doubts raised  Christie\u2019s has called off the auction of a Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton days before it was due to go under the hammer in Hong Kong after a US fossil company raised doubts about parts of the skeleton named \u201cShen\u201d. Christie\u2019s said in a statement that Shen \u2013 a 3,100lb (1,400kg) skeleton \u2013 had been withdrawn from its fall auctions week, which starts in Hong Kong on Friday. \u201cThe consignor has now decided to loan the specimen to a museum for public display,\u201d it said. Questions have been raised over whether bones from a replica of another T rex skeleton had been used to complete Shen. Sign up  First Thing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.

                    "body": "Gregg Berhalter bemoaned his team\u2019s lack of a world-class finisher as the United States were knocked out of the World Cup by the Netherlands on Saturday. The US failed to finishing off promising attacks in all four of their games at the World Cup, and many have pointed to the team\u2019s lack of a clinical striker as the reason they failed to progress. Jesus Ferreira, Haji Wright and Josh Sargent led the line at different times for the US in Qatar but none of them posed any real threat to opposing defenders.  \u201cWhat I would say is, when you look at the difference, to me there was offensive quality that the Netherlands had that we\u2019re lacking a little bit,\u201d said Berhalter after the match. \u201cIt\u2019s normal. We have a young group, players beginning their careers and we\u2019ll catch up to that, but we don\u2019t have a Memphis Depay right now, who plays at Barcelona and has played in the Champions League for years. Those are not excuses, that stuff is going to come.\u201d The Dutch, on the other hand, were ruthless when presented with chances during their 3-1 victory. The US defence had been solid this World Cup but they were less robust on Saturday. Berhalter said lapses cost the US. \u201cIt\u2019s just moments that the players were [switched] off a little bit here and there and it ends up in the back of the net,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you play at this level, against high quality opponents, that\u2019s what happens. It\u2019s unfortunate that it happens in the knockout game, but it did and we\u2019ve got to learn from it.\u201d Despite the team\u2019s defeat the USA coach said he was pleased with his team\u2019s progress. \u201cWhen you look at our team, there\u2019s a very clear identity of what we\u2019re trying to do. You have a group that\u2019s extremely committed to each other in what they\u2019re trying to accomplish,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a very young group, we have players that are beginning in their careers and they\u2019re going to catch up to that. It\u2019s not to make an excuse for this group, they\u2019re still very resilient. That stuff will come.\u201d The US will co-host the World Cup in 2026 and Berhalter said there are good things to come with players such as Tyler Adams, Christian Pulisic and Weston McKennie making up a strong young core for the Americans. \u201cI think this group is close,\u201d he said. \u201cTo be fielding the youngest starting XIs in the World Cup four times in a row, to still play the way we are, the American public should be optimistic.\u201d Berhalter would not be drawn on whether he would coach the US in 2026. \u201cI\u2019ve only been focused on the World Cup, achieving things with this group,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the next couple of weeks, I\u2019ll clear my head and think about what\u2019s next.\u201d"

Belgium\u2019s failure to beat Croatia in their final Group F match led Mart\u00ednez to confirm his exit after more than six years in charge.\nMart\u00ednez insisted he was proud of his legacy despite his failure to achieve with the so-called golden generation, with Eden Hazard, Thibaut Courtois and Kevin De Bruyne among the players who may never return to this stage.\n\nRomelu Lukaku missed a series of chances to earn victory and a place in the last 16, including a glaring opportunity in second-half stoppage time. Mart\u00ednez guided Belgium to the semi-finals of the 2018 World Cup, where they were defeated by the eventual winners, France. Despite a winning start against Canada in Qatar, a shock defeat by Morocco and a goalless draw against Croatia led to Belgium\u2019s humbling exit.\nMart\u00ednez hugged his players after the final whistle in Doha. \u201cThat was my last game with the national team and it\u2019s emotional as you can imagine,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was going to be the end whether we were world champions or out in the group stage. It has nothing to do with being eliminated at this stage. This is the time for me to accept that this day is the last game.\u201d\n\nAsked to clarify when he made his decision, Mart\u00ednez said: \u201cI took the decision just before the World Cup. I always work in the long term. I believe the long-term projects need to be long term and they need to be set in advance. As you can imagine, since 2018 I have had many opportunities to leave and take jobs at club level. I always wanted to be loyal, I always wanted to finish the job and now I don\u2019t resign, this is the end of my contract. This was always the plan.\u201d\n\nMart\u00ednez said defeat by Morocco was behind their downfall. \u201cWhen you come to the World Cup, you have to play three games and we only played one,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first two games, we were fearful, we were not the team that we are, we listened to the noise on the outside and we were feeling the responsibility.\n\u201cWe played thinking that we could lose the game and that we could be out and that\u2019s what cost us progressing. If we had gone through, I think we would have seen the real Belgium and we could have been very competitive.\u201d"

The Norwegian arrived in the summer from Borussia Dortmund where he missed large portions of last season through injury. Due to Norway\u2019s absence from Qatar 2022, Haaland avoided the mental and physical stress of tournament football.\n\n\u201cI think he is still not at his best because of the injury, to move his huge body is not easy for him but as much as he can play, minutes will be better,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cI had the feeling he is not at his best. It is a matter of time. [He is] always an incredible threat for the opponent. The numbers are unbelievable but I have the feeling he is not just coming here for the numbers, he wants to win it. Still there are 70 points to play for.\u201d\nHaaland admitted he could have scored five at Elland Road to add to his incredible tally. \u201cHe missed chances, hopefully he can do better, but the numbers are exceptional, an incredible threat for us and always in the right position at the right time,\u201d Guardiola said.\nThe victory at Elland Road puts City five points behind leaders Arsenal with Haaland completing 90 minutes as he looks to grow sharper in front of goal. He scored against Liverpool in the Carabao Cup last week in the first game after the break that saw him recuperated. \u201cWhen we started to train in Abu Dhabi he could not train one single day, maybe the last one.\u201d\nThe rest has done him good. \u201cI kind of recharged my batteries and to watch other people score and win games in the World Cup kind of triggers me and motivates me and also irritates me,\u201d Haaland told Amazon. \u201cI\u2019m more hungry and more ready than ever.\u201d\nHaaland\u2019s goals at Leeds got the better of his former RB Salzburg coach Jesse Marsch, who he is still close to. \u201cI am just really happy for him,\u201d Marsch said. \u201cIn some ways watching him score is painful, I want him in a different kit.\n\u201cBut when you know some of these young men, and you see their qualities as people, you want them to do their best, just not against your team.

                    "body": "Gareth Southgate has decided to continue as England\u2019s head coach after considering his future in the wake of the World Cup quarter-final defeat by France. Southgate said he would take time to weigh up whether he had the energy to carry on and hold talks with the Football Association, which wanted him to honour a contract that runs to December 2024. He feels the climate is very different from the negativity that followed the Euro 2020 final defeat and the recent Nations League campaign that ended in relegation. He has greatly valued the support of the FA chief executive, Mark Bullingham, and the other members of the hierarchy, while he retains the firm backing of his squad.  A feature of the World Cup campaign was the near-constant endorsement of Southgate from within the dressing room. After the loss to France Harry Kane, the captain, said he wanted Southgate to continue and Declan Rice and Harry Maguire did likewise. Southgate led England to the World Cup semi-finals in 2018 and to within a penalty shootout of winning the Euros. Southgate went to Qatar targeting a first tournament victory since 1966 and said after the team\u2019s exit: \u201cThe energy that it takes through these tournaments is enormous. I want to make the right decision, whenever that is, for the team, for England, for the FA.\u201d Southgate said in June he would not outstay his welcome and reflected after the defeat by France that he was \u201cconflicted\u201d about whether to continue in light of the various lows of the past 18 months. The nadir came with June\u2019s 4-0 home defeat by Hungary at Wolves, which drew an angry reaction towards Southgate from the crowd. There remains an element of the fanbase that would like Southgate to leave and he mentioned the Molineux response when saying after the France game: \u201cI\u2019ve found large parts of the last 18 months difficult.\u201d When Southgate extended his contract in November of last year, he talked of the depth of playing talent at his disposal, how he had \u201cdone a lot of the work culturally\u201d to turn them into contenders and his desire to bring it to fruition. \u201cTo step away at a moment where we still think the next few years can be very exciting \u2026 that would have been difficult to live with,\u201d he said. After a week of soul-searching he has come back around to the wisdom of those words."

                    "body": "THE STORM BEFORE THE CALM Absolutely nothing is off the table at these Human Rights World Cup finals. For all Gianni Infantino\u2019s protestations, his \u201cshut up and dribble\u201d pre-tournament message has been about as effective as Serbia\u2019s offside trap against Cameroon striker Vincent \u201cScoop\u201d Aboubakar. So if HRWC 2022 proves anything, it\u2019s that history is rarely forgotten. And that means you, Ingerlund-supporting berks who think it a wheeze to visit the actual Middle East clad in crusader costumes. Did you not do history at schoo \u2026 oh, what\u2019s the use? Wales v England will invoke plenty of historic cross-border overtones when they collide on Tuesday evening: Llywelyn The Great, Owain Glynd\u0175r, David Lloyd-George, Barry John, Max Boyce and all that. But for sheer geopolitical white heat, and with apologies to Plaid Cymru, it has nothing on the other Group B game played at the same time. A win for either Iran or the USA! USA!! USA!!! guarantees progress to the last 16. Those are the bare footballing facts, but the buildup has seen a heavy deployment of the chucking-in-the-kitchen-sink school of discussion heavily featured in this HRWC. Tyler Adams showed genuine diplomacy when fielding a volley from one Iranian journalist about Black Lives Matter, having been initially upbraided for his pronunciation of the word \u201cIran\u201d, something he apologised for. Iran coach Carlos Queiroz, fresh from coating off J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann for cultural insensitivity, then invoked shootings in American schools. That came in response to the US Soccer Federation displaying an Iranian flag without the emblem of the Islamic Republic in a now-deleted tweet; it\u2019s by no means just the Iranians lobbing in that kitchen sink. That gesture clumsily poked the fires of serious, harrowing events back in Iran, where women fighting for basic human rights have a country teetering between sweeping social change and vicious crackdowns from the regime in Tehran. The most significant political gesture of this tournament has been the Iran players\u2019 refusal to sing their national anthem before their opener with England. It happened amid genuine, continuing fear of reprisal. Against Wales in their second match, the anthem was sung half-heartedly. Now for a match against the country known back home as \u201cthe Great Satan\u201d, with whom diplomatic relations have been sketchy at very best since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. World Cup memories abound, of course, of the teams meeting in 1998, Iran winning 2-1 in Lyon, the players having got together for a chummy photo-call before the match. More of the same? The HRWC\u2019s revival is a supreme test of that unifying force of football Infantino keeps wanging on about. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE!

QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cThey get on that until 4am or 5am and watch all the great comments and enjoy all that sh1te, and it affects the sleep patterns. You\u2019re up until 5am looking at good comments, and the same people backing you are the ones killing you the day after. So just get rid of it, don\u2019t look at it\u201d \u2013 Australia coach Graham Arnold is warning his players over the perils of social media disgraces before their flamin\u2019 final group game against Denmark.  FOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS  The Big Website World Cup guide to all 830 players is a wonderful document (presumably no Football Daily input). However, the Senegalese defender with the No 24 has been included as \u2018Moustapha Name\u2019. Perhaps, for the sake of completeness, a bit more work was needed?\u201d \u2013 John Lawton.    According to my research, England have been knocked out of the World Cup nine times in the knockout rounds. 1954, 1962, 1970, 1986, 1990, 1998, 2006, 2010 and 2018. The one thing these games all have in common is that, on the television coverage, England start every one of these games attacking to the left in the first half. Coincidence? Of course not, can someone let Gareth know. PS. You might want to check my \u2018research\u2019\u201d \u2013 Tim Evenden.   After the 3-3 draw with Cameroon I wonder if my Serbia are: 1) The laughing stock of this HR World Cup; 2) The most entertaining team; 3) The worst defence in the competition; 4) The most unpredictable team in Qatar; or 5) maybe all of the mentioned above. We may be all confused here (our defence is certainly 100% confused) about who we are, but at least it is never boring with our national team\u201d \u2013 Bogdan Kotarlic.

Gracia is one of two candidates on the club\u2019s latest shortlist. Two of their preferred candidates, West Brom\u2019s Carlos Corber\u00e1n and Rayo Vallecano\u2019s Andoni Iraola, proved out of reach after Jesse Marsch was sacked a fortnight ago. They also held talks with other candidates including the former Ajax coach Alfred Schreuder before saying last Tuesday that Michael Skubala would continue as caretaker for the \u201cupcoming fixtures\u201d. One game later Leeds are trying to find a permanent manager. On Saturday they play at home to another of their relegation rivals, Southampton. Gracia\u2019s most recent job was with Al Sadd in Qatar, where he won the league before being sacked last June. He was at Watford from January 2018 until September 2019, reaching the 2019 FA Cup final but being dismissed after a poor start to the following season. M\u00e1laga and Rubin Kazan are also among the 52-year-old\u2019s previous clubs."

                    "body": "\nThe main event\nYes, yes, and you really need to check out a promising band called the Arctic Monkeys as well. It\u2019s a statement of the offensively obvious that you should watch Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 play football. But it\u2019s not about watching Mbapp\u00e9 per se, it\u2019s about watching him now, when he looks in the form and the mood to do something career-defining, something we\u2019ll still be talking about when we\u2019re old. If Mbapp\u00e9 plays for France against Tunisia \u2013 and godspeed Didier Deschamps if he wants to have that conversation \u2013 then it\u2019ll be worth renouncing the more important Group D game between Australia and Denmark.\nMbapp\u00e9 looks on a mission to win the lot: the World Cup, the Golden Boot, the Golden Ball, the Ballon d\u2019Or. As if to emphasise the old cliche about his football doing the talking, Mbapp\u00e9 declined to speak to the media after the Denmark game and is facing a fine from Fifa\u2019s reliable arbiters of acceptable human behaviour. He can probably afford it.\nUnlike club football, the World Cup has nothing to do with money, at least not on the field, and there has been an exuberant purity to Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s performances. When you couple his talent with the intent and focus that he showed against Australia and Denmark, it\u2019s hard not to reach for hyperbole. His sparkling dominance has tentatively evoked the pinnacle of association football: Diego Maradona at Mexico 86. But Maradona peaked at the business end, and Mbapp\u00e9 could easily end up like Lionel Messi in 2014: electric in the group stage, all out of charge when it mattered.\n\nMbapp\u00e9 has three goals and an assist at Qatar 2022; the other 18 players who received at least one vote at this year\u2019s Ballon d\u2019Or have three goals and two assists between them. Many have been absent, either literally (Karim Benzema, Erling Haaland, Sadio Man\u00e9, Mo Salah) or metaphorically (Kevin De Bruyne, Son Heung-min). That, and the poignant sight of so many galacticos in denial, has made Mbapp\u00e9 stand out even more, as an all-time great in an entertaining but not especially high-quality tournament. Only Casemiro has been as influential; only Vinicius Jr has sent the pulse into the cardio zone.\nThe thrill of Mbapp\u00e9 is about so much more than the hard currency of goals and assists. He doesn\u2019t just capture the imagination; he enhances it. Watching him in this form, on this stage, should be prescribed by doctors. It gets your heart rate up, it releases endorphins, it reduces anxiety. And you don\u2019t even need to leave the couch. RS\nTalking points\nKoulibaly crucial for Senegal at both endsThe injured Sadio Man\u00e9 is sorely missed by Senegal, but a deep run at any World Cup is built first and foremost on defence. Chelsea supporters (and the club\u2019s opponents) have been discovering Kalidou Koulibaly\u2019s qualities since his arrival from Napoli in July. An uncompromising defender, yes, but also a natural leader who provides a significant scoring threat. The centre-back demonstrated his finishing ability by tucking away the goal that secured Senegal\u2019s progress at Ecuador\u2019s expense. Alongside his centre-back partner, Abdou Diallo \u2013 on loan at Leipzig, but on the books at Paris Saint-Germain \u2013 the last-16 meeting with England on Sunday is a chance for Koulibaly to further demonstrate his undeniable talent on the biggest stage. LM\n\nCould it be the Netherlands\u2019 year? Every qualified team arrives at the World Cup with big dreams; one of them goes home with the trophy. Could this finally be the year that the Netherlands go one better than those three previous runner-up spots? There is the sense they have the raw materials in terms of playing talent. There is also an inspirational backstory, with the 71-year-old coach Louis van Gaal receiving cancer treatment while leading his beloved Oranje at one last major tournament. Cody Gakpo is soaking up plenty of attention, but this is a unified squad that looks capable of building towards big things. They face the United States in the last 16 on Saturday. LM\n\nBeyond the football\nHassan al-Thawadi, the Qatari official responsible for the delivery of the World Cup, has made the belated admission that the number of workers who have died on projects related to the tournament is far higher than Qatar\u2019s official total of three work-related fatalities. On the TV show Piers Morgan Uncensored, Thawadi said: \u201cThe estimate is around 400. Between 400 and 500. I don\u2019t have the precise number, that is something that is being discussed.\u201d After the interview Nicholas McGeehan, of the advocacy group FairSquare, said: \u201cThis is just the latest example of Qatar\u2019s inexcusable lack of transparency on the issues of workers\u2019 deaths. We need proper data and thorough investigations, not vague figures announced through media interviews.\u201d An investigation by the Guardian found that 6,500 migrant workers from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka died in Qatar between 2010, when the tournament was awarded, and 2021. WM\nGlobal media-watch\nThe Australian media aren\u2019t in quite the frenzy you might expect as their team attempts to reach the second round for the first time since 2006. The Herald Sun conceded the game against Denmark was \u201cAustralia\u2019s biggest World Cup game in 16 years\u201d, but it also put its focus on coach Graham Arnold explaining to the rest of the world \u201cwhere football sits in Australia\u2019s pecking order\u201d. Definitely not at the top.\n\nIn the Sydney Morning Herald, Vince Rugari was slightly aggrieved that all the talk coming out of Denmark\u2019s camp before the game was about Australia\u2019s physicality, bemoaning that coach Kasper Hjulmand was \u201cmaking no mention of the slick technical moves or tactical exploitation behind Australia\u2019s goals so far at this World Cup\u201d. Some things never seem to change in Murdoch-land, though \u2013 if you visited the sport page of News Corp\u2019s Australian Daily Telegraph, the main story about the World Cup on Tuesday before the Socceroos\u2019 do-or-die game was \u201cQatar slams \u2018very racist\u2019 BBC World Cup coverage\u201d, with a huge picture of Gary Lineker. MB\nThe internet reacts\nWith the world watching and Senegal needing a win, you could have forgiven Isma\u00efla Sarr for just keeping his head down and absolutely smashing his penalty at goal in their must-win match against Ecuador. But no, the Watford winger found ice in his veins, sitting Hern\u00e1n Gal\u00edndez down in goal with an insouciant no-look penalty. As you can imagine, Twitter lit up. His Watford teammates liked it, too. GB\n\nToday\u2019s matches\nFrance v Tunisia (Group D, 3pm GMT, BBC One) No, we\u2019ve no idea why Group D finishes before Group C either. Les Bleus have been the most impressive team and should prove beyond the abilities of Tunisia, who still cling to the hope that a win here and a draw between Denmark and Australia would sneak them through. Expect it to be tense in the stands \u2013 when Tunisia played in Paris in 2008 the atmosphere was so hostile that then-president Nicolas Sarkozy demanded no more matches on French soil against the national teams of former colonies. MB\nDenmark v Australia (Group D, 3pm GMT, BBC Two) The Danes arrived as much-fancied dark horses after their impressive Euros but disappointed against Tunisia and then went down against France, even if it was an improvement. They\u2019ve left themselves with it all to do against a side that will be full of confidence in the way they rebounded from defeat against France. If Australia can start with the kind of tempo and attitude they did against that European opposition, and keep it tight at the back, Denmark will struggle. MB\n\nPoland v Argentina (Group C, 7pm GMT, BBC One) The great escape is on. After a humiliating defeat to Saudi Arabia, a win here will almost certainly see Argentina end up top of Group C. Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez will relish another chance to put himself in the shop window. Poland will be hankering after their glory years \u2013 they had two third-place finishes in 1974 and 1982, but 1986 was the last time they reached the second round. They just need a point. Can they hang on for one against Argentina? MB\nSaudi Arabia v Mexico (Group C, 7pm GMT, BBC Two) There is something of Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s methods in the way Saudi Arabia press and harry and they were unlucky in the end that their backline cracked against Poland in what had been a hard-fought match. With the support again of what is likely to be a noisy crowd, you would not back against them getting the win they need to progress. Mexico need a win and to hope that Poland do them a favour, but more than anything they need a goal. Uruguay and Tunisia are the only two other sides who have failed to score. MB\nPlayer to watch\nPiotr Zielinski is just one of a number of Poland players yet to consistently bring his exceptional club form to the international stage. He can beat players, he can create goals, he can score goals: and yet for his country he has rarely, if ever, played with the kind of freedom and creativity he displays in Serie A. Collectively, Poland have sometimes seemed to riddled with anxiety when faced with the prospect of another tournament disappointment. But there was something that felt cathartic about the way Zielinski belted Poland\u2019s opening goal against Saudi Arabia into the roof of the net. Robert Lewandowski soon had his first World Cup goal, too. Will the floodgates finally open? LM\nAnd finally \u2026\n\nHowever much Fernando Santos tries to change direction, Portugal\u2019s World Cup campaign keeps getting diverted back to Cristiano Ronaldo. \u201cRonaldo played a great game but all our team played a great performance \u2026 I think it was a great match, our team played very well and the rest for me does not matter,\u201d he said exasperatedly, when asked about the debate over whether Ronaldo had touched the ball for his side\u2019s opener in the 2-0 win over Uruguay. So keen were they for their ageing talisman to be immortalised alongside Eus\u00e9bio as the nation\u2019s all-time record World Cup goalscorer, the Portuguese FA was reportedly set to present evidence to Fifa proving that Ronaldo had got the final touch on Bruno Fernandes\u2019s cross. Unfortunately for him, Adidas\u2019s evidence says differently, with technology in the match ball allowing the manufacturers to confirm that Ronaldo, despite celebrating exuberantly, made no contact whatsoever.

                    "body": "BrewDog has said it plans to brew in China as part of a deal with Budweiser China to expand sales in the world\u2019s biggest market for beer. Budweiser China would start brewing BrewDog\u2019s Punk IPA, Hazy Jane and Elvis Juice beers by the end of March at its Putian craft brewery near the south-east coast, the companies announced on Monday. BrewDog is focusing on international expansion after a difficult few years in the UK. The company, headquartered in Ellon, Aberdeenshire, lost its status as a ethically certified B Corp in December after complaints over its treatment of workers. BrewDog apologised to employees in 2021 after a group wrote an open letter accusing the company of creating a \u201cculture of fear\u201d within the business.  Other missteps include a badly received advertising campaign focused on workers\u2019 rights at the football World Cup in Qatar, and a \u201csolid gold\u201d beer can giveaway that was in fact brass plated with gold. James Watt, one of BrewDog\u2019s founders, ended up paying winners of the promotion nearly \u00a3500,000 from his own pocket after some complained. Watt said the company was focusing on international expansion in part because \u201cthe environment is very challenging in the UK\u201d, in an interview with the Financial Times. BrewDog produces its beers in the US, Germany and Australia, allowing the company to get products to customers more quickly and reducing the costs and carbon emissions associated with shipping around the world. The company had also agreed a deal with an unnamed affiliate of Budweiser China to expand BrewDog in South Korea, with options to collaborate in other Asian markets, the announcement said. BrewDog has another joint venture in Japan with Asahi. It said Japanese sales had doubled since the deal was announced in September 2021. The China tie-up will allow BrewDog to use \u201cBudweiser China\u2019s extensive sales and distribution network\u201d to win a portion of the fast-growing market for \u201ccraft beer\u201d \u2013 a term generally used for beers that deviate from the milder flavours of the biggest brands of lager. Budweiser China is part of a group majority-owned by AB Inbev, the world\u2019s largest brewer. BrewDog will open nine bars in China, adding to one in Shanghai. The company runs 110 bars around the world. Watt said: \u201cWe are very excited about further expansion into China. This is a genuinely transformational partnership which is going to bring BrewDog to every corner of the world\u2019s biggest beer market, from a truly bespoke craft brewery which will help ensure the quality of our beers.\u201d He added: \u201cChinese drinkers love craft beer, but the sector is still very new.\u201d"

With the core task accomplished, it\u2019s time for a mentality shift. It\u2019s not just getting your foot in the door, it\u2019s acting as if you belong inside, and proving it. Looking the part, and playing it. That will be the challenge for the US in Qatar against more experienced opponents, and there are hints that Berhalter\u2019s men are evolving assertively in that direction, even as they squeezed through with a draw, a win and a loss over the past week. Triumph in defeat was a suitably dissonant note to conclude this qualifying campaign. The deepest and most gifted generation of US men\u2019s players ever assembled finished third in the standings, only avoiding a playoff by virtue of goal difference. The US ended below Canada, an outcome that would have seemed preposterous before the Octagonal stage began last September. They also finished beneath Mexico despite a merited superior recent head-to-head record. In this qualifying cycle, humility and insecurity were byproducts of the shocking failure to make the 2018 tournament after seven successive appearances. No longer could Wednesday night\u2019s headline news \u2013 the US are going to a World Cup \u2013 read like a statement of the obvious, a routine matter. Qualification has at times been couched not as the pursuit of a positive achievement but as an exercise in disaster prevention.  Even as US Soccer adopted the slogan \u201cOnly Forward\u201d, the caution and concern were palpable. Take February\u2019s deep-freeze diffidence, when the US decided that they were so in need of a little extra home advantage against Honduras, the Octagonal\u2019s worst and only winless team, that they scheduled what proved to be a farcical fixture in frost-bitten Minnesota. That\u2019s not acting as if you\u2019re the 13th best team in the world hosting the 78th, per Fifa\u2019s latest ranking. Last September, when the US were 1-0 down to Honduras at half time (ultimately winning 4-1), having opened their campaign with draws against El Salvador and Canada, it was even tempting to wonder whether Berhalter might meet the same fate as Jurgen Klinsmann: ousted early in a stuttering qualifying campaign. Despite the blemishes of defeat away to Panama and Canada, and the usual loss in Costa Rica, the performances against Mexico have been the most instructive guide to this team\u2019s potential: energetic, ambitious and undaunted.  The 2-0 win in Cincinnati last November, their third victory over El Tri in 2021, secured with late goals from Christian Pulisic and Weston McKennie, was vibrant. The goalless draw in Mexico City last week was, finishing aside, a more impressive display than the 5-1 victory over Panama in Orlando last Sunday.  That point also provided what proved a vital cushion for the game in Costa Rica: it meant the US could afford to lose, even by five goals, and still avoid a playoff against New Zealand in Qatar. Though two second-half goals settled Wednesday\u2019s match, with set-piece defending and goalkeeper Zack Steffen at fault, it was overall a bright display from an American side who must have been exhausted but were patently disappointed to lose. Canada, the group winners, have played with greater purpose and joy in comparison. A less intricate tactical approach based on rapid counter-attacks is surely a factor. So too is less pressure \u2013 after all, Canada\u2019s only other World Cup appearance came in 1986 and they did not even reach the final qualifying round in the previous cycle.  Also relevant is that the US under Berhalter have been a perpetual work in progress \u2013 a \u201cprocess\u201d, as he likes to say. In 50 games in charge the head coach has used 88 different players. Of those, 21 have made only one appearance. There\u2019s no lack of choice, no shortage of footballers at high-level clubs. Julian Green, who scored the US\u2019s most recent World Cup goal in the second-round loss to Belgium in 2014, has played 17 times in the Bundesliga this season and is still only 26 years old, yet has not featured under Berhalter. No wonder it\u2019s been hard to ascertain much of an identity beyond \u201cyoung and promising\u201d \u2013 the team has been a constant construction site. In Pulisic, Sergino Dest, McKennie, Tyler Adams, Gio Reyna, Yunus Musah, Brenden Aaronson and Tim Weah, the head coach has players who look capable of excelling on the biggest stage (if healthy). There are question marks at goalkeeper and centre forward, and the centre backs must prove they can handle the step up from regional to global standard. Pre-tournament friendlies against high-level opponents, if they can be arranged, should be clarifying in that respect. But the US squad for the 2014 World Cup had an average age of 27.3 years. The oldest of the eight listed above, Pulisic and McKennie, will be 24 when Qatar kicks off. Berhalter\u2019s top talents are yet to peak. The stand-out from that big win over Panama in Florida, which all but sealed qualification, was a hyper-caffeinated Pulisic, who claimed his first senior international hat-trick. It wasn\u2019t only the goals, though. It was the attitude of a player embracing the responsibility of the captain\u2019s armband, willing to shoulder the heft of the occasion and lead by example. It was, as Affleck\u2019s character might have said, presidential stuff. Now let\u2019s see how far and fast this group can go."

Warning: contains topical Kwasi Kwarteng references.\n\n\n\n\n 5.26pm  \n\nWith the waking nightmare that is Qatar 2022 looming ever larger in the collective consciousness, Barney Ronay wants to move beyond \u201csportswashing\u201d and discover a new lexicon for the coming World Cup dystopia. Here\u2019s his latest column.\n\n\n\n\n 5.19pm  \n\nMeanwhile, in Europe, there\u2019s even more to look forward to. It\u2019s el cl\u00e1sico weekend, for one, with Barcelona travelling to the Bernab\u00e9u to play Real Madrid on Sunday.\nSerie A is gearing up for the Turin derby, with Juventus facing city rivals Torino. In the Bundesliga, Union Berlin, the surprise league leaders, will do battle with Borussia Dortmund, while Freiburg, in second, play Bayern Munich, in third. In Ligue 1, PSG welcome hated rivals Marseille to the Parc des Princes. That should be enough to keep you busy.\n\nUpdated at 2.31pm BST\n\n\n 5.06pm  \n\nBeyond the Premier League, there are plenty of games worth keeping an eye on this weekend. In the Championship, fourth-placed Burnley take on sixth-placed Swansea in a meeting between two of the division\u2019s form sides. In League One, Cheltenham Town go up against Bristol Rovers in a West Country derby (of sorts). In League Two, second-placed Leyton Orient host third-placed Northampton Town.\nThere are also a few dozen FA Cup fourth qualifying round ties on Saturday, so get down to your local non-league club if you don\u2019t fancy any of the above.\n\nUpdated at 5.07pm BST\n\n\n 4.29pm  \n\nAnthony Martial could return to face Newcastle after limping off against Everton last weekend. At least, Ten Hag hopes so. \u201cMartial can be [fit] but we have to wait [to see] how it develops in the coming hours. Harry Maguire will not make this [game], but it doesn\u2019t take long [for him to return] \u2026 I think that next week he will be back in the team training or over the next week.\u201d\n\n\n\n 4.14pm  \n\nWill Magee here, thrown back in at the deep end. Shall we hear some more from Erik ten Hag? Go on, let\u2019s treat ourselves. Asked about his strongest midfield pairing ahead of Newcastle\u2019s trip to Old Trafford on Sunday, he said: \u201c[It\u2019s] difficult to say in this moment, when they have to play longer together, but what\u2019s important once again is that you need a squad. \n\u201cI think Fred played a good game [against Omonia Nicosia] and he [did] really well in the counter-press, he wins a lot of balls \u2026 I think we have some combinations and in the midfield it\u2019s always about balance. So I am happy with all four [Fred, Scott McTominay, Casemiro and Christian Eriksen] and I hope they keep going in this way.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 4.00pm  \n\nRight, my work here is done, and it\u2019s back over to Will Magee to close this out.\n\nUpdated at 4.15pm BST\n\n\n 3.59pm  \n\nWorld Cup latest: Spain will not, after all, be sending riot police to Qatar.\nPer Reuters.\n\nSpain will not send riot police to Qatar to help safeguard the upcoming soccer World Cup as had been requested by the Middle Eastern country.\nThe ministry would not provide any further comment on the decision, and only confirmed an earlier report on Cadena Ser radio, which said Spain had been mulling whether to send around 115 officers to Qatar but ultimately refused.\nWith a population of less than three million \u2013 of whom just 380,000 are Qatari nationals \u2013 Qatar faces a shortage of personnel as it gears up for the month-long FIFA soccer tournament kicking off on Nov. 20. Last month, Turkey announced it would send more than 3,000 riot police to help Qatar stage soccer\u2019s showpiece event.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.31pm BST\n\n\n 3.44pm  \n\nDouglas Luiz has signed a new deal with Aston Villa, the club describing it as \u201clong term\u201d. Arsenal pushed hard to sign the Brazilian midfielder late on in the summer transfer.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.07pm BST\n\n\n 3.39pm  \n\nAleksandar Mitrovic could be back for Fulham tomorrow against Bournemouth, having sustained an injury during the recent international break and did not feature during his side\u2019s 3-1 defeat at West Ham last weekend, having come off early against Newcastle on October 1.\nMarco Silva admitted he will have to be assessed ahead of Saturday\u2019s match.\n\nHe\u2019s getting better. Of course, he did the warm-up with the team, did some boxes and the session was more strategy for the match, of course, but I can tell you that was the first day that he was involved in the team.\nBefore he was two-and-a-half weeks without (training) with the team and now we\u2019re checking, assessing how he is feeling as well and we will do the same later this evening to take the decision if he will be involved in the squad list or not. But it is still soon, let\u2019s see what will happen in the next few hours.\n\n\n\n\n 3.23pm  \n\nAs well as Reece James, there\u2019s another Chelsea player in danger of missing the World Cup, and that\u2019s N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9. These quotes from Graham Potter seem quite pessimistic. \n\nAgain, he\u2019s due to see a consultant at the weekend. It\u2019s a setback so it\u2019s not good news but anything other than that at this stage I can\u2019t give you anything more. Historically there are things which have happened which is a concern, so we need to get to the bottom of that.\nIt\u2019s a setback at this stage of this rehab which is worrying, but all we can do is get the right diagnosis, get the right consultation, and try and help him get back to full fitness and enjoying his football.\n\n\n\n\n 3.00pm  \nKulusevski set to miss out again for Tottenham\n\nDejan Kulusevski is out of Tottenham\u2019s home game against Everton on Saturday after suffering a set-back in his injury rehabilitation during Thursday\u2019s training session.\nThe winger returned from Sweden duty at the end of September with a hamstring problem and he has not been able to play since. He had a scan on Monday and Antonio Conte reported it was positive. The Spurs manager was ready to include Kulusevski against Everton.\nBut that will not happen now and Conte is unsure whether Kulusevski will be available for Wednesday night\u2019s trip to Manchester United.\n\u201cIn this moment, honestly, it is a bit difficult to answer yes or not [about the United game],\u201d Conte said. \u201cIt depends on the new MRI he did today and what the doctors say. Also, the feeling of the player. In this situation, it is important to respect the feeling of the player. The player has to feel he is OK, 100 per cent, otherwise it is not good to take stupid risk.\u201d\n\n\n\n 2.56pm  \n\nYou rarely hear how ambitious Newcastle are these days, do you\u2026?\nEddie Howe bangs the drums here. \n\n\nThe aim of this club with the ambition behind the scenes \u2013 which is huge now \u2013 I have always said we have to now try and deliver those huge ambitions. But there is no ceiling here. When you see the passion around the city \u2026 the thing that always blows me away is the young people here, the 12-, 13- and 14-year-olds, their passion for Newcastle. It runs through generations and that won\u2019t stop.\nWhat will happen hopefully is the global brand and the global enthusiasm for Newcastle will grow. The global support will definitely change through time if the club can be successful. I am putting more pressure on myself here, but that is the challenge and that is where the club wants to be. Who knows what the future will look like in 20 or 30 years.\n\n\n\n\n 2.54pm  \n\nMore Manchester City, from Jamie Jackson, who was at the club\u2019s pre-match presser today. \n\n\nI always had the feeling in Anfield that we behaved really well,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cMaybe in the last two games we were a little bit soft, in different circumstances, but you have to behave at the top, top level. But in Anfield, win or lose, we always behaved with a huge personality.\nIt is one of the biggest and nicest [venues], it\u2019s a joy to be there and be a part of this type of game \u2013 it\u2019s important but it\u2019s a football game. With Liverpool what is important is the quality they have. You have to win duels. When they push you, you have to push, you have to be there. The semi-final in the FA Cup was tough and in the Community Shield we were not ready. They were one base higher; you cannot do that against this team.\n\n\n\n\n 2.43pm  \nGuardiola: Liverpool can still be City's main challengers\n\nPep Guardiola has given Liverpool the dreaded vote of confidence despite form that has dropped them to tenth of the league while Manchester City sit comfortably on the shoulder of Arsenal. He even believes that J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team will be City\u2019s main challengers for the Premier League title come the end of a season cut in half by next month\u2019s World Cup.\n\u201cAlways have been [our main rivals], always it is, and will be. If you asked that question with 10 games left I would say I don\u2019t think Liverpool can catch the top of the league. But being in the position we are now, and with the World Cup, anything can happen. I know the quality they have. It has always been a tough game and I don\u2019t expect anything else. Always have been, always it is, and will be. I know the quality they have, the character.\u201d\nBut beware Liverpool. Erling Haaland is ready, after resting up against Copenhagen. \u201cHe was tired, and Bernardo (Silva) and others as well, but they feel good and are ready for Sunday.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 2.59pm BST\n\n\n 2.34pm  \n\nSome Steven Gerrard words from his press conference ahead of Aston Villa\u2019s match with Chelsea. Villa were unconvincing \u2013 and dull \u2013 in drawing with Leeds and Nottingham Forest in their last two matches. Let\u2019s suggest this press conference is not dissimilar. \n\nWe have gone four unbeaten - I\u2019m not satisfied with that because in the last two games we should have executed better and should have taken maximum points - but we want to make that five. We want to go into this game [against Chelsea] with belief and confidence that one of these moments could be taken.\nI have got a job to do, to prepare the team and focus on what I can control. I prepare our game plan the best I can and try and prove people wrong. Obviously we are underdogs at the weekend but for me it\u2019s a really exciting opportunity to go and prove people wrong.\nPlayers under me are allowed to make mistakes, that\u2019s not a problem as long as we move on quickly and focus on next match. Pressure is coming my way - that is fine, I accept it, I won\u2019t shy away from it.\n\n\n\n\n 2.14pm  \n\nHere\u2019s J\u00fcrgen Klopp on the clear and present danger of Erling Haaland. \n\n\n\n\n 2.06pm  \n\nThat\u2019s all from Hasenh\u00fcttl and, coincidentally, from me. John Brewin has returned from eating a delicious lunch and will guide you through the rest of the afternoon.\n\n\n\n 2.02pm  \nHasenh\u00fcttl not fretting about his future\n\nIn what is becoming an alarmingly regular occurrence, the Southampton manager is asked whether he fears losing his job. \u201cI have not really had one minute to think about it,\u201d he says gruffly.\n\u201cThis is not the way I plan my week. As long as I am here I do my best to make us successful. It costs so much energy there is no energy left to think about that question. For me, the only goal is to see my team working hard and knowing that on the weekend we have a very important game for this club, the fans. It\u2019s not about me, it\u2019s about winning points and coming in a better position in the table. I think since I have been here we have not been below the [relegation] line, so it\u2019s necessary to win on Sunday or we could be below that line.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 2.04pm BST\n\n\n 1.52pm  \n\nWith Manchester United set to host Newcastle on Sunday, Erik ten Hag has given an optimistic assessment of his side\u2019s attacking capabilities. Here\u2019s Jamie Jackson with the lowdown.\n\n\n\n\n 1.47pm  \n\nBad news for Reece James, it seems. Jacob Steinberg has the latest on his knee injury, which is worse than first thought and could keep him out of the World Cup.\n\n\n\n\n 1.44pm  \n\nMore injury news. Hasenh\u00fcttl has suggested Rom\u00e9o Lavia, Southampton\u2019s \u00a312m summer signing from Manchester City, is close to making a comeback from the hamstring problem which has kept him out since September. Moussa Djenepo has been sidelined with illness, however, while Tino Livramento is still working his way back from knee surgery.\n\u201cFor us we have only Moussa with illness. He was not in the training the whole week. The rest of the team \u2013 apart from Rom\u00e9o, who is possibly starting the beginning of next week with the team, and Tino, [who] will still need a bit longer \u2013 the rest are fit.\u201d\n\n\n\n 1.33pm  \n\nGiven that West Ham are on a four-match winning run in all competitions following their 2-1 win against Anderlecht in midweek, Hasenh\u00fcttl knows Southampton will have to be at their best on Sunday. \u201cThe Premier League is the hardest league and even if you perform well you might not win games,\u201d he says.\n\u201cAgainst Wolves and Everton it was possible to get more than a good performance but it wasn\u2019t enough.\u201d\n\n\n\n 1.23pm  \n\nThat\u2019s all from Guardiola. Over to Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl. Asked about So\u00fcthampton\u2019s worrying four-match losing run, he says: \u201cThis is a Premier League situation for us, like all the last four years since I was here. The margins for winning a game \u2026 take the last game against Everton, 1-0 up and conceding two goals in five minutes. You have to put these margins on your side to be successful again.\n\u201cWe have had tough moments but also moments where we have turned things around. We are more than 10 years part of the Premier League, it is clear fans want to see higher up the table and this is the goal we have.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 1.11pm  \n\nAnd now for some injury news. Guardiola confirms that Kalvin Phillips, John Stones and Kyle Walker will all miss the trip to Anfield, saying: \u201cJohn I think will be back I don\u2019t know when, but maybe one week, 10 days. Kalvin is getting better and is improving a lot. Kyle is still out.\u201d\nAsked whether they will be fit in time to feature for England at the World Cup, he says: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\n\n 1.04pm  \nGuardiola 'not thinking' about contract talks\n\nAsked whether there has been any progress over extending his contract, which runs out at the end of the season, Guardiola bats the question away airily. \u201cYou know I am not thinking one second about that.\n\u201cWe have two or three weeks until the World Cup and this is an important time. After that we have plenty of time to talk about that.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 1.04pm BST\n\n\n 12.51pm  \n\nIt\u2019s press conference time for Pep Guardiola, who insists that Manchester City\u2019s upcoming visit to Anfield will be a tricky challenge despite Liverpool\u2019s slump to 10th in the Premier League. \u201cIt\u2019s always difficult in the years since we have arrived here together, it will be a tough game and I don\u2019t expect anything else. The game will be dictated on the pitch, not by the table, because we are in front of them, or behind, not because of those kinds of things.\n\u201cI know the quality they have, they know the quality we have. If this was with three games left, I would say they could not catch top of the league but, with so long left plus a World Cup, anything can happen.\u201d\n\n\n\n 12.44pm  \n\nAhead of West Ham\u2019s trip to Southampton on Sunday, David Moyes has reflected on Jarrod Bowen\u2019s chances of being On The Plane\u2122 to Qatar. \u201cHe is a really good boy to work with. He wants to listen and watch his clips back and watch his runs. He wants to see where he can improve. He is a really diligent boy at trying to improve his game.\n\u201cI have told him if he scores five or six goals between now and the World Cup, he will have a chance of going to the World Cup. He has a couple already so he has a chance. Let\u2019s hope he can keep it going.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 12.37pm  \n\nWill Magee here. You\u2019ve been saddled with me again. Look, I\u2019m as unhappy about this as you are, OK? Here\u2019s Ben Fisher\u2019s interview with Wout Faes, Leicester\u2019s only outfield summer signing, to start us off.\n\n\n\n\n 12.32pm  \n\nRight, lunchtime calls, and so the next tranche of red-hot news will come from Will Magee. \n\n\n\n 12.06pm  \n\nPotentially big story here, way beyond the world of football, though a reminder of how tied in with geopolitics football has become. \n\nThe Premier League has been asked to confirm whether it has investigated the billionaire owner of Manchester City Football Club under its \u201cfit and proper\u201d owners\u2019 test, over allegations of helping Russian oligarchs avoid western sanctions after the invasion of Ukraine.\nSheikh Mansour bin Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan, the deputy prime minister of the UAE and a member of the ruling family of Abu Dhabi, has been accused in media reports of helping to allow rich Russians to evade sanctions by moving their assets, including superyachts and private jets, to the Emirates.\n\n\n\n\n\n 11.28am  \n\nMore from Newcastle\u2019s Dan Ashworth, this time in the sphere of women\u2019s football. \n\nAlready, they\u2019ve gone from a team where the players had to pay to play last year to being professionalised. We will do everything we can to give them the support to get to the WSL as quickly as possible.\n\n\nIn the WSL itself this weekend, all eyes on Chelsea, where Emma Hayes has taken her leave of absence. Her assistants Denise Reddy and Paul Green will take charge of the team in her absence. Chelsea\u2019s next game is at Everton on Sunday. They begin their Champions League campaign at Paris Saint-Germain the following Thursday.\n\n\n\n 11.20am  \n\nSome meat on the bones of that SENSATIONAL Nuno return to Wolves from Ben Fisher. \n\nNuno signed a two-year deal with Al-Ittihad in July and his lucrative contract with the Saudi Arabian club could prove prohibitive, with compensation likely required. But Nuno\u2019s agent, Jorge Mendes, who also represents Lopetegui, is highly influential at Molineux and could ease talks.\nWolves have also spoken to their former Under-23s coach Rob Edwards, who was recently sacked by Watford after 11 games. Edwards, a former Wolves defender, is highly regarded by the club\u2019s hierarchy.\n\n\n\n\n\n 11.10am  \n\nNewcastle corner, courtesy of a BBC interview with sporting director Dan Ashcroft Ashworth, and some decent quotes from the former West Brom, England and Brighton operative. \nOn heavy transfer spend: \u201cYou can\u2019t keep doing that every year. You just can\u2019t, so consequently we have to look at some emerging talent, enhancing our academy and getting the players through from a different route.\u201d\nOn selling to buy: \u201cI can\u2019t lie to you and say we\u2019ll never have to sell a player, we\u2019d always be able to hold on to our top talent. That doesn\u2019t happen anywhere. Liverpool sold Mane - you have to sometimes make a pragmatic decision to go, \u2018OK, we\u2019ll do that because that\u2019s a way of reinvesting in the club\u2019. But as a rule of thumb, I would like to think we\u2019ll be able to hold on to our top talent in order to drive our ambitions of driving up the league and competing for cups.\u201d\nMeanwhile, for their game at Old Trafford, Newcastle will be without Alexander Isak, who will be back soon, and Emil Krafth, who has a long-term injury. \n\n\n\n 10.56am  \n\n\nJake Daniels of Blackpool and the Australian Josh Cavallo of Adelaide United are the highest-profile current male players to have come out. Asked why more had not followed, Lineker said: \u201cFear. Fear of the unknown, I imagine. Perhaps they are worried what their teammates might think, although they probably already know. It seems insane that it should even be a thing.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 10.57am BST\n\n\n 10.51am  \nKlopp wary of 'best striker in the world'\n\nSome J\u00fcrgen Klopp, ahead of Sunday, firstly on his team\u2019s concession of early goals. \n\nThese things can happen if you lose the ball in the wrong moment,\u201d he says of Liverpool\u2019s habit of conceding first. Obviously when you play against somebody at the moment who is the best striker in the world you have to make sure he doesn\u2019t get that many balls. That\u2019s what we will try but obviously against City the problem is if you close Haaland down with too many players you open up gaps for all the other world-class players. So that will not make life easier, it\u2019s a challenge, it\u2019s a football problem and we will try to find a solution.\n\nAnd on City\u2019s attacking talent, including you know who. \n\nWhen [Haaland] was very young, you could see the potential, it was insane. I don\u2019t think he started against us in a home game, I think he was injured or came on - but we were already pretty busy with thinking about him, I can remember that. How can you close him down, shut him down - he scored anyway!\nPhysically he sets new standards, the combination of being really physical and technical and sensational awareness, his orientation on the pitch is exceptional, he knows always where the decisive gaps are, barely offside. Now at City he has some of the best players in the world at setting up goals - De Bruyne, Mahrez, Foden, Bernardo Silva, - so it\u2019s a perfect fit.\n\nThis was Haaland\u2019s previous visit to Anfield. \n\n\nUpdated at 12.44pm BST\n\n\n 10.26am  \n\nThe word is that Nuno has a dream of going back to Wolves, and so do they. Nuno, of course, was the first client of Jorge Mendes, who is the club\u2019s owner\u2019s \u201cfootball adviser\u201d, but who couldn\u2019t get Julen Lopetegui, also his client, to Molineux. He was also Bruno Lage\u2019s agent. \n\n\n\n\n 10.22am  \n\nIt\u2019s hotting up in the MLS, though no playoff place for the David Beckham/Pippin Neville dream team in Miami. Always next year, lads. \n\n\n\n\n 10.13am  \n\nThe World Cup Qatar from next month will have areas for drunk fans \u2013 and journalists \u2013 to sober up as the first to be held in a Muslim country with strict controls on alcohol yet still sponsored by a certain American beer brand.\nPer Reuters. \n\nQatar will let ticketed fans buy alcoholic beer at matches starting three hours before kickoff and for one hour after the final whistle, but not during the match, Reuters reported in September, citing a source with knowledge of plans for the tournament.\nQatar 2022 chief executive Nasser Al Khater told Sky News in an interview published on Thursday that anyone who overdoes it would be looked after. \u201cI know that there are plans in place for people to sober up if ... they\u2019ve been drinking excessively,\u201d Al Khater said, adding that it was to make sure they were safe and not harmful to others or themselves and said it was \u201ca good idea\u201d.\nAl Khater also repeated assurances that LGBTQ+ fans were welcome and would feel at ease in Qatar. Homosexuality is illegal in Qatar, as it is in many countries in the Middle East. \u201cEverybody is welcome here and everybody will feel safe when they come to Qatar,\u201d he said when asked for his message to LGBTQ+ fans. When asked if that included gay fans holding hands in public, he said: \u201cYes\u201d and said \u201cyes\u201d again when asked if that was a message of reassurance.\nTournament organisers have previously stressed that everyone, regardless of their sexual orientation or background, is welcome in Qatar, while also warning fans against public displays of affection. Qatar and several countries in the region banned Disney\u2019s animated film \u201cLightyear\u201d from screening in cinemas this year for featuring characters in a same-sex relationship.\n\n\n\n\n 9.59am  \n\nCrisis club latest, from Reuters. \n\nBarcelona will sport the owl logo of Drake\u2019s OVO Sound label on their jerseys instead of main sponsors Spotify when they take on Real Madrid on Sunday to mark the Canadian rapper surpassing 50 billion streams on the music platform.\nBarcelona, who were one of the last major clubs without a shirt sponsor, said the move was part of their efforts to bring soccer and music together. Four-times Grammy award winner Drake posted an image of the limited-edition jersey on Instagram to his more than 120 million followers. Barca lead La Liga on goal difference ahead of Real Madrid.\n\nTo \u201cbring soccer and music together\u201d is an interesting concept. Why didn\u2019t anyone think of that before? Well done, Drake, on 50 billion streams. Don\u2019t spend the $20 cheque all at once, mate. \n\n\n\n 9.44am  \n\nRecap of last night\u2019s Europa League news and events. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n 9.41am  \n\nOur overnight 10 things starts off with this from Andy Hunter\n\nOne \u201cfreak\u201d result \u2013 as J\u00fcrgen Klopp put it \u2013 has transformed the mood inside Liverpool after they condemned Rangers to the joint-heaviest defeat in their history at Ibrox on Wednesday. The next, and more onerous, challenge is to ensure an emphatic first away win changes the momentum of an inconsistent season. Manchester City and a rested Erling Haaland pose the most formidable threat but the 7-1 win in Glasgow, or certainly the standard of the second-half display, has to be the benchmark for a team that comfortably beat Rangers at Anfield last week before underperforming in defeat at Arsenal. With 13 points separating the two teams who have dominated the title race in recent years, Liverpool cannot afford another false dawn. Their intensity will be key, according to Andy Robertson. \u201cWe need to get consistency back into our game, back into our performance,\u201d said the fit-again full-back. \u201cWe have to play with that intensity again. At our best we know we can cause problems to any team. Anything below that and it will be a difficult afternoon.\u201d Andy Hunter\n\n\n\n\n 9.30am  \nPreamble\n\nIf Liverpool\u2019s visit to Arsenal last week was a last-chance saloon for the title race, then maybe Sunday and the visit of Manchester City represents something akin to Douglas Adams\u2019 Restaurant at the End of the Universe. Should Erling Haaland do Erling Haaland things then there\u2019s a possibility it puts an end to the club\u2019s latest golden era, a doomsday that means the top four becomes a distant prospect, too. Of course, we are talking about a team that gubbed Rangers 7-1 just two days ago but then again the 9-0 defeat of Bournemouth rings out. Bournemouth are two points above Liverpool at the time. There was a time when there was nothing between Liverpool and City, a matter of two points over four seasons, but not now. There\u2019s loads of other stuff to look forward to including Brentford v Brighton tonight, with the home team struggling for form. Saturday sees the latest examination of Brendan Rodgers when Crystal Palace visit Leicester. There\u2019s also an unlikely mid-table class between Fulham and Bournemouth, managerless Wolves v Nottingham Forest, that bastion of incredulity. \nSunday is where the main action can be found with Aston Villa, Steven under severe pressure, welcoming Graham Potter\u2019s Chelsea. Table-toppers Arsenal go to Leeds Leeds Leeds. Manchester United v Newcastle now feels like a big match again, which is what a decent run of form in red and an injection of Saudi cash will do for you. Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s tightrope walk continues when Southampton welcome West Ham, before the big one takes place at Anfield. Unlike last week, when Everton played Manchester United, there\u2019s no game in the Hi de Hi/Last of the Summer Wine slot, and long may that continue. \nBeyond that, all the big news from the EFL and around the world game. Join us. \n\n"

                    "body": "Pep Guardiola said the desire Manchester City displayed when beating Liverpool and Leeds was evidence of why he signed a new contract to stay at the Etihad. The wins in the Carabao Cup and Premier League came in City\u2019s first two matches since the Qatar World Cup. Guardiola agreed his fresh one-year deal \u2013 with the option of another 12 months until the summer of 2025 \u2013 during the tournament and urged his side to continue performing as they did against Liverpool and Leeds when they face Everton on New Year\u2019s Eve.  \u201cIt is the results [that matter] \u2013 if we are tired of each other then I will not finish this contract,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cThe contract is just paper. If I extend it\u2019s because I have the feeling that we can still play good \u2013 like the last two games. We did many good things [in those games] and still have the desire and hunger to do it. When you win a lot, it is easier to handle the situations but on the other side it is: \u2018Oh, we have to do it again\u2019. It\u2019s complicated. \u201cYou have no idea how people are going to come back from the World Cup. They are in 25 degrees. And then you come here with this weather, immediately to Elland Road against the most intense team in the Premier League. But they reacted really well, I\u2019d say. The commitment made me feel that \u2018let\u2019s try to do it again\u2019. If we don\u2019t do that against these opponents then it won\u2019t be possible. That is the challenge: to do it again. What I\u2019m proud of the most is that we are still there. The same in the Carabao Cup, beating Chelsea [the previous round] and Liverpool.\u201d City have an opportunity to cut Arsenal\u2019s lead at the top of the Premier League to two points before Mikel Arteta\u2019s side face Brighton in Saturday\u2019s evening kick-off. Guardiola said the London club deserved to be top at this stage as they attempt to win the title for the first time since 2004 but believes his side have shown the \u201cdesire\u201d to push them all the way. \u201cArsenal have done brilliantly and have been better than us so far. For a long time they have not been there and they want to continue being there,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir lead is not 15 or 20 points, we are close. I prefer to be closer but we have not finished the first leg [of the championship]. Winning four in five years and seeing the way we played at Leeds, after the contenders all won, I see the desire. The moment I feel something is broken I will resign or not extend.\u201dGuardiola believes that to retain the title City must keep their focus. \u201cIt\u2019s not about Arsenal and Newcastle, it\u2019s about ourselves,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are there it depends on how you perform, not because in the recent decade we were the best team in England.\u201d"

                    "body": "John Herdman stands in front of a yellow conference room wall, shifting his weight from one foot to the other, off to the side of a projector screen. It displays a quote from Sun Tzu in one corner and a dramatic description of a wildfire along the bottom. He leans into the latter.\u201cIt gains a terrifying momentum. That\u2019s what it gains \u2013 a terrifying momentum. This red shirt, this team,\u201d the Canada manager tells his players. \u201cIt consumes everything in its path: Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Aruba, Suriname \u2026 and then you\u2019ll be ready. What a fucking journey.\u201dIf the identities of the four teams in that path somewhat detract from the speech, they really shouldn\u2019t. This is the world that Canada\u2019s men\u2019s national team were operating in just a year and a half ago. Next week Herdman, an Englishman who has become a hero in Canada, will send his team out to face Belgium in the country\u2019s first men\u2019s World Cup match for nearly four decades. The speech is one of the first stirring moments from WeCAN, a behind-the-scenes series charting Canada\u2019s rollicking run through Concacaf qualifying en route to Qatar. There are plenty more. But in truth, this is all merely part of the journey.Just one Canadian player was born before Mexico 86, the last time the country played on the game\u2019s grandest stage \u2013 indomitable skipper Atiba Hutchinson who turns 40 in February. Much is rightly made of the rawness and inexperience of the team he captains. But Herdman, the 47-year-old former teacher from Durham, does not lack for experience. Qatar, remarkably, will be the fourth senior World Cup of a management career that started in earnest 16 years ago.Herdman talks about history as something to be torn up or rewritten, to be challenged or made and remade. When asked last week what it meant to him to be the first manager ever to take a team to a men\u2019s and women\u2019s World Cup, he spoke of how pivotal it is to be \u201cpracticing what I preach\u201d.The preaching is, and appears to have always been, the key part of Herdman\u2019s practice. Spend time with any of those who he\u2019s brought with him on his journey from skills camps in northern England and doubters at the Sunderland Academy to grassroots roles in New Zealand that turned to national team jobs there and in Canada, and the talk always comes back to the talk. Herdman is a master of motivation.\u201cJohn is built for these kind of tournaments,\u201d says Melissa Tancredi, the former Canadian stalwart who played under Herdman at the 2015 Women\u2019s World Cup. \u201cHe\u2019s been through it all. He\u2019s been through one at home [in Canada] when we all felt that pressure so I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s any inexperience with John.  \u201cThis man has something that most managers don\u2019t and that\u2019s his ability to actually connect with players and get the absolute best out of them. He\u2019s a mastermind. I\u2019ve never had, or heard of, a coach who is able to connect with players like he does. He\u2019s an absolute beauty in terms of a motivator. He has that ability to calm the situation or bring it to where he needs to bring it, he\u2019s a calibrator. You don\u2019t really learn that, it\u2019s something you\u2019re innately given.\u201dWhile Herdman has undoubtedly grown as a tactician during his years in the international game, Tancredi\u2019s argument that the psychological and cultural skills were a feature from the jump is backed up by those who were there at the start.Wendi Henderson was long since retired from the New Zealand national team and was feeling her way back into club football, initially for fun, in 2006 when someone approached her on the sidelines in Wellington.\u201cIt was John Herdman. He said he\u2019d just been appointed as Football Ferns manager and asked: \u2018Where are you at?\u2019\u201d Henderson says. \u201cI started laughing. \u2018Where am I at? I\u2019m 35 and retired three years ago!\u2019\u201d  Henderson would soon be on a plane to China for a two-match tour, Herdman handing her the captain\u2019s armband for both. She\u2019d retired on 48 caps but now rang up her half century as a new era dawned under a manager four years her junior.\u201cHe and I used to laugh about the age difference,\u201d adds Henderson. \u201cBut he had a way of really connecting with people and drawing them in to the journey. He has done that with every team he has coached and you can see it. You can see the goosebumps. It instantly takes me back to those moments, making us want to die for each other and die for our country.\u201dHenderson led the line at Herdman\u2019s first World Cup, the 2007 women\u2019s edition where he set up his side to contain their opponents. By the time the 2011 tournament rolled around, the journey had progressed and Henderson watched a more expansive Ferns side. Herdman\u2019s motivational skillset was being sharpened too. Defender Kirsty Hill, on the 2011 team, shared with Herdman a Maori saying that he has often come back to: \u201cYou have to touch someone\u2019s heart before you can take them by the hand.\u201dNew Zealand had touched the Herdman family. His son Jay now represents their U-19s. But there was a new calling. Canadian hearts were barely beating when Herdman arrived in the country in 2011. Canada had been the worst performer at that year\u2019s Women\u2019s World Cup.\u201cWe were completely broken,\u201d recalls retired defender Emily Zurrer, who was also part of that 2015 squad. \u201cSome of us were thinking about hanging up our boots and here\u2019s this guy talking about being on a podium and seeing our flag rise \u2026 and very quickly he instilled that belief in us. It wasn\u2019t this false sense of belief, it was: \u2018Holy shit we can actually do something here with this guy leading our way\u2019. He\u2019s not just talk, he\u2019s the hardest working person I\u2019ve met in my life.\u201dHerdman guided the women to back-to-back Olympic bronzes before they went two better at Tokyo last year. It\u2019s therefore understandably hard to find dissenting voices, anyone left unmotivated by all the talk. Would his earnestness have such a runway in the more cynical confines of his homeland? We may one day find out. Herdman is a demanding leader but surrounds himself with a staff who know the drill. One minor criticism is that he perhaps wants to be liked too much and delays hard conversations. His jump from the women to the men in 2018 was hugely controversial and Herdman has admitted regret about how it was handled, particularly a hurried apology to veteran captain Christine Sinclair.With Croatia and Morocco alongside Belgium, Group F in Qatar looks daunting. But then so did getting there. What\u2019s remarkable is that the same powers of persuasion and motivation that brought Henderson, a city worker in her mid-30s, back to a World Cup in 2007 was just as effective in 2021 in convincing someone like Alphonso Davies, a $100,000-a-week Champions League winner barely out of his teens, that he could guide Canada there too.Tancredi, Zurrer and Henderson give knowing smiles when they hear Davies say he\u2019d \u201crun through a brick wall\u201d for Herdman. The coach is doing it again.And it\u2019s a lot more than Sun Tzu quotes. Before a ball had been kicked in qualifying Herdman arranged mocked-up Canadian front pages celebrating World Cup qualification and passed them to the players. History there to be written. On a Zoom call recently from his home office, Herdman had a freshly hung poster from Mexico 86, where Canada played three, lost three and didn\u2019t score a goal. History there to be remade. Nothing would surprise his former charges. \u201cJohn works best with his back against the wall,\u201d says Tancredi, a sentiment Zurrer echoed. \u201cHe loves to be the underdog, it\u2019s where he thrives. That\u2019s where he has shown with our team and with this men\u2019s team: the more you doubt him, the more work he\u2019s going to put in to prove you wrong.\u201dWhat a journey."

Kevin has had eight years here, you know him like me \u2013 he has to find the right fire inside of himself, just to be a little bit, I would say grumpy or upset to play his best. That is his energy inside of him.

He will be remembered for ever as one of the greatest, greatest, greatest players of this club.\u201d\n\nWhile Phillips\u2019s fellow England squad members at the World Cup, John Stones, Phil Foden and Jack Grealish, were all introduced as replacements against Liverpool, and another, Kyle Walker, was an unused substitute, the holding midfielder was absent.

This season, there has been a notable lack of snow across Alpine resorts, leaving holidaymakers disappointed and causing some ski tournaments to be called off. Global heating has meant that there is no longer guaranteed snow at some of the top ski areas, with the situation predicted to get worse as the planet heats and weather becomes more erratic. Now, leading athletes have called for the FIS to overhaul its sustainability strategy, as it is lacking. They have asked for a more \u201cgeographically reasonable\u201d race schedule to reduce carbon emissions, as often the races entail flying across the world multiple times. This year, the men\u2019s circuit will have travelled from Europe to North America and back twice. They are also asking for the ski season to be changed to keep up with climate breakdown. They have suggested shifting the start of the season from late October to late November and the end of the season from mid-March to late April. \u201cThe seasons have shifted and in the interest of us all we need to adapt to those new circumstances,\u201d they said. The Norwegian racer Aleksander Aamodt Kilde told the Associated Press: \u201cWe see that the world is changing. We see also the impact of our sport \u2026 I want the future generations to experience winter and to be able to do what I do.\u201d The letter, signed by 200 athletes, was written by the Austrian downhiller Julian Sch\u00fctter, ambassador for climate campaign group Protect Our Winters (Pow). It says: \u201cWe are already experiencing the effects of climate change in our everyday lives and our profession. The public opinion about skiing is shifting towards unjustifiability \u2026 We need progressive organisational action. We are aware of the current sustainability efforts of FIS and rate them as insufficient.\u201d The American downhiller and Pow ambassador Travis Ganong added: \u201cThe simple truth of the matter is you can\u2019t ski without snow and it\u2019s going closer and closer every year to that. \u201cWe really want to push our organising body to be leaders in this fight for climate change and currently I don\u2019t think we are leading. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the schedule or what [the FIS] can change, but at least start looking deep into what we\u2019re currently doing and how we can do it better.\u201d The FIS has been approached for comment."

Nick Ames\nA South American showdown: Argentina v Brazil, and Brazil to win. Ben Fisher\nBrazil over Belgium. The Sele\u00e7\u00e3o\u2019s embarrassment of attacking riches \u2013 headlined by Neymar, Vin\u00edcius Jr, Gabriel Martinelli, Rodrygo and Raphinha \u2013 will break Europe\u2019s two-decade stranglehold and plant the flag for another Brazilian dynasty. Bryan Armen Graham\nBrazil v France with Tite\u2019s favourites avenging their country\u2019s defeat in the 1998 final. Andy Hunter\nBrazil to beat France in the final. Brazil have the firepower and the range of options to end 20 years of heartbreak. David Hytner\n\nThe best two teams here are Brazil, who have lost just three times in the last four years, and Argentina, who are unbeaten since 2019. But if they top their group they\u2019ll meet in the semi-finals. So let\u2019s say Brazil v Spain, with Brazil winning. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s maxim, that the team with the best keeper wins the World Cup, holds more often than not. Sean Ingle\nArgentina and Brazil after the latter finish second in Group G and enter the other side of draw. 3-2 to Argentina in the best final since Italy beat West Germany 3-1 in 1982. Jamie Jackson\nArgentina and Germany to contest the final, with the former finally possessing a supporting cast capable of sending their main man, Lionel Messi, off with the trophy he has long coveted. Emma Kemp\nThis feels like Argentina\u2019s time, a battle-hardened squad with a strong sense of mission (Mession?) and an ability to grind out results. France should emerge from what promises to be by far the weaker half of the draw. Jonathan Liew\n\nBrazil will. They will beat France. Sid Lowe\nArgentina will beat England 3-2. I have come to this conclusion by calculating what I think ought to be the answer (Brazil beating France) then tweaking it a bit to create something I would rather see. Paul MacInnes\nArgentina and France. Messi for the win, followed by a tearful, heartfelt speech about the dubious moral nature of this World Cup and instant retirement. Barney Ronay\nArgentina will win their semi-final against Brazil. Then Lionel Messi will beat Spain in the final. Jacob Steinberg\nIt\u2019s deja vu time. The clock turns back to 1998 in Paris so it\u2019s Brazil and France in Doha with France to win again and crowds dancing down the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es once more. Louise Taylor\nArgentina to beat Germany. Given injuries, fatigue and the lack of preparation time, this feels a very hard World Cup to predict so if the European stranglehold is to be broken, it may have to be now. Argentina and Brazil are both in great form \u2013 albeit having played limited European opposition, but I worry about the back of Brazil\u2019s midfield, whereas Argentina, even without Giovani Lo Celso, have a nice balance and the narrative thrust of Lionel Messi in his final World Cup. Germany and Spain look the most coherent European teams, but Germany perhaps have a little more experience. Jonathan Wilson\nWho will win the Golden Boot?\nKarim Benzema looks a fair bet for this, particularly considering France\u2019s group. NA\nDarwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez. Ten goals in his past 20 appearances for club and country is a more than respectable return and it could be a fruitful tournament for the Liverpool forward. BF\nNeymar. Only three goals shy of breaking Pel\u00e9\u2019s record and becoming Brazil\u2019s all-time top goalscorer, the in-form PSG star\u2019s firm hold on penalty duties for a team that should go far will only help. BAG\nCristiano Ronaldo, on the basis he is unlikely to bow out quietly. AH\nKarim Benzema. France will go deep in the competition and the Ballon d\u2019Or winner will sense the chance to get up and running quickly against Australia and Tunisia in the group phase. DH\n\nThe usual formula is to pick a penalty taker from a strong team. So let\u2019s go with Leo Messi. SI\nRobert Lewandowski as he fires Poland to the knockout phase for a first time since 1986. JJ\nHarry Kane to retain it at a pinch over (the potentially injured) Karim Benzema. Even if England do not make it past the quarter-finals (see below), the opposition until that point presents their frontman with plenty of opportunities. EK\nDarwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez. Three headers, two off his shin and one off an unidentified body part during a goalmouth scramble against South Korea, in case you\u2019re wondering. JL\nMbapp\u00e9. SL\nLionel Messi. It\u2019s about time, the group\u2019s not strong and let\u2019s face it, he\u2019s capable of it. PM\nKylian Mbapp\u00e9. BR\nAssuming no one signs Erling Haaland on a last-minute loan, how about Lautaro Mart\u00ednez to benefit from Messi\u2019s service? JS\nDespite England\u2019s likely quarter-final loss to France Harry Kane will clock up sufficient goals to ensure he becomes the tournament\u2019s top scorer. It\u2019s the award his exceptional talent as a rare, ultra special, No 9/No 10 hybrid demands. LT\nMemphis Depay. He was joint leading scorer in European qualifying, clearly loves the role he has for the Netherlands under Louis van Gaal and, given the groups, it\u2019s easy to imagine him getting a couple against either or both of Qatar and Ecuador, then maybe Wales or USA in the last-16. JW\nWho will be the surprise team of the tournament?\nWith the caveat that they must first make it through the competition\u2019s most fiendish group, Serbia look ready to cast aside the \u201cmercurial\u201d tag and make a big impression. Their attacking options are up there with most and the coach, \u201cPiksi\u201d Stojkovic, has drilled them superbly. NA\nNobody is really talking about Croatia, England\u2019s old foes who have a classy midfield and will surely fancy their chances of qualifying out of Group F with a spring in their step. BF\nUruguay. Left for dead in the early stages of qualifying, La Celeste came to life after Diego Alonso replaced longtime manager \u00d3scar Tab\u00e1rez and installed a high press to create chances for Luis Su\u00e1rez, Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez and Edinson Cavani. A semi-final run is not out of the question. BAG\n\nStill holding on to the hope that Senegal can build on their first victory at the Africa Cup of Nations in February, despite the seismic loss of Sadio Man\u00e9. AH\nIf Serbia can get the better of Switzerland in the group \u2013 and I think they can \u2013 they could reach the quarter-finals, at least. Dragan Stojkovic has great attacking potential to call upon. DH\nDenmark. Not impossible that they finish top of the group, ahead of France, and then play Mexico or Poland in the last-16 and then England in the quarters. SI\nUSA \u2013 which might be bad news for England, with whom they share a group. Look out for DeAndre Yedlin, the sole survivor from their last appearance in 2014 who has Premier League experience, and rising star, Haji Wright. JJ\nSerbia seem poised to progress past the group stage for the first time in history and possibly even make life difficult for others once they do. Dragan Stojkovic\u2019s outfit qualified convincingly on the back of fluent, attacking football utilising their wing-backs and proven forward pairing Aleksandar Mitrovic and Dusan Vlahovic. EK\nReached the knockouts at the last four major tournaments; stunned France at Euro 2020, beat Spain and Portugal in the last five months. Yes: everyone\u2019s forgotten about Switzerland again. JL\nGhana. SL\nIf a revivified Uruguay - Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez, Fede Valverde et al - are too obvious, then let\u2019s say Canada. Impressive in qualifying, a nation behind them and - in Alphonso Davies and Jonathan David - quality going forward. Could squeeze through group F if Belgium falter. PM\nSerbia. BR\nDenmark were a breath of fresh air at Euro 2020 and this time they have Christian Eriksen. My Spain tip is dependent on the Danes pipping France to first spot in Group D. JS\nThe Netherlands. The squad is strong, they are unbeaten in 15 games and crown princes of the high press so they should go deep, offering Louis van Gaal a deserved last managerial hurrah. LT\nGhana were terrible in the Cup of Nations, but they have a new management structure and seem to have done things relatively sensibly since the Chris Hughton/Otto Addo pairing took charge, not least by persuading Tariq Lamptey and I\u00f1aki Williams to play for Ghana. And that group is full of unpredictable sides.\nWho will be breakthrough player of the tournament?\nXavi Simons could well show his lavish talent to the wider world if Louis van Gaal lets him off the leash for the Netherlands. Another Dutch-based player, the thrilling Mohammed Kudus, is capable of burnishing both his and Ghana\u2019s prospects this winter. NA\nXavi Simons, a Next Generation pick in 2020, arrives uncapped but could leave Qatar a Dutch hero. Louis van Gaal has picked up on the 19-year-old\u2019s fine performances since leaving Paris Saint-Germain last year and there is plenty of headroom for the dreadlocked PSV midfielder to blossom. Simons spent nine years in the academy at Barcelona and is now making a splash in the Eredivisie. BF\nGavi. Spain\u2019s precocious attacking midfielder only turned 18 in August, but he has already made 50 appearances for Barcelona and a dozen for the national side. Expect an international coming-out not unlike Pedri\u2019s at last year\u2019s Euros. BAG\nIt will be interesting to see if Pedri \u2013 who only turns 20 during the tournament - can transfer his Barcelona form onto the world stage. AH\n\nThis could be Jude Bellingham\u2019s tournament. Only 19, the England midfielder is having the best goalscoring season of his career \u2013 nine already for Borussia Dortmund \u2013 and his range of other attributes represent a heady cocktail. DH\nDepends what you mean by breakout but in Jamal Musiala and Youssoufa Moukoko Germany have two legitimate shots. SI\nJack Grealish will shake this World Cup and make the team of the tournament. JJ\nI am biased, but the Australian forward Garang Kuol has the raw talent and tenacity to change a game out of nothing. The (only just) 18-year-old striker has yet to start a single senior club match but recently signed with Newcastle United and is a wildcard World Cup selection with impact substitute written all over it. EK\nVin\u00edcius J\u00fanior hasn\u2019t really hit his straps for Brazil yet, and isn\u2019t even guaranteed a starting place. But if Tite can find a role for him in Qatar - and he really should - this could be the explosion of an extraordinary talent. JL\nIf he even counts as breakthrough: Gavi. SL\nDepends what a breakthrough is, but one of the Bundesliga boys - Jamal Musiala and Jude Bellingham - could leave a mark. PM\nCristiano Ronaldo. Or Cody Gakpo. BR\nGermany\u2019s Jamal Musiala is a bewitching talent. And he could have played for England. JS\nBruno Guimar\u00e3es. The 24-year-old Newcastle United midfielder has only eight senior caps so far but, given the chance, would be capable of switching the lights on for Brazil in Doha. His central midfield talent \u2013 whether deployed as a No 6 or No 8 \u2013 is sufficiently powerful to ensure he becomes virtually indispensable; even to a team this gifted. LT\nEnzo Fern\u00e1ndez has been in great form for Benfica and could get his chance in Argentina\u2019s midfield with Lo Celso injured. The 21-year-old was very impressive after coming off the bench in the friendly against Honduras in September. JW\nHow far will England and Wales get?\nEngland: quarter-finals. Wales: valiant but agonising group stage exit. NA\nEngland reach the quarter-finals, the damning inquest begins and Gareth Southgate walks away after six years of unwanted spotlight. Wales to make it to the last-16 but avoid the hysteria. BF\n\nWales\u2019 first World Cup in 64 years will be a quick one as they go quietly in the group stage. England won\u2019t be far behind after getting all they can handle from either Senegal or the Netherlands in the last-16. BAG\nBoth to make it out of the group, and both to go out in the last-16. AH\nWith England, it could be anything from quarter-finalists to finalists. My heart says the latter, that there were mitigating factors for their Nations League dip, that the experience and quality is there. My head says an exit in the quarters, probably to France. Wales to reach the last-16. DH\nWith England nothing would surprise me, but the draw has fallen their way and they will be in the easier half if they top their group. Wales will do well to progress to the last-16. SI\nEngland \u2013 last-16. Wales - group. JJ\nIt\u2019s not coming home, and I\u2019m going to wager it\u2019ll get lost in transit somewhere around the quarter-finals on the evidence of England\u2019s recent issues and Nations League woes. If Wales (welcome back) keep their veterans injury-free they could yet beat the United States and Iran to second spot and seal a spot in the round of 16. EK\nEngland group stage. Wales last-16. JL\nNot far enough. Would love to think Wales will get out the group but I fear it\u2019s unlikely - although don\u2019t underestimate how good Bale could be. England are remarkably consistent really and more or less always do the same thing at a World Cup, at least in knockout phases, which is to beat the teams they \u201cshould\u201d beat and go out to the first really strong team. Maybe a step better this time. Semis. SL\nEngland will get to the final (see above) or go out at any point after the group stage. Wales will get to the second round thanks to Gareth Bale. PM\nSuspect neither will get past the last-16. Although oddly, can also see England winning it, Gareth Bale being inexplicably brilliant and the Welsh generally cheering everyone up. Football eh? BR\n\nEngland will lose in the last four to Spain \u2013 we\u2019ll talk a lot about the lack of a controlling midfielder. Wales will go out in the last-16 to Holland. JS\nEngland to the quarter-finals and a likely defeat to France. Wales to the round of 16 where the Netherlands may well lie in wait. LT\nEngland could easily go out in the group, or they could win it, but a quarter-final exit feels about reasonable. Wales have a great opportunity to finish above the US and get to the last-16. JWHow do you feel about going to Qatar to cover the tournament?\nWhat would normally be the pinnacle of this profession is undoubtedly tempered by the context. That certainly hits home when friends you spent cherished moments with watching World Cups in childhood say they will not be tuning in this time. But I\u2019m convinced it\u2019s important to be there, and feel I\u2019m part of a conscientious reporting team who will try our hardest to bring all elements of the tournament to readers with depth and sensitivity. NA\nNaturally conflicted. Am excited about covering my first World Cup and Wales\u2019s first for 64 years but that many fans feel they cannot be here to witness it safely is the sad and depressing reality. The Rainbow Wall, a Welsh LGBTQ+ fans group, are among those not travelling. BF\nOn one hand, if you\u2019re serious about framing yourself as a truly global game, then you are going to have to bring your showcase event to the Arab world at some point. As a pure outcome, the Middle East deserved a first World Cup before the United States deserved a second. On the other, there\u2019s no getting around the stomach-turning human cost of the spectacle ahead and I expect it to be front of mind throughout the month. BAG\n\nCovering a World Cup should be a career highlight. Sadly, due to Fifa greed and corruption, this feels anything but. AH\nWe have talked a lot internally at the Guardian about getting the balance of our coverage right, about shining a light on the human rights abuses in Qatar and also celebrating the football. My hope is that the latter can be achieved. My worry is that the two elements are not mutually exclusive. DH\nAfter a month in Beijing for the Winter Olympics in February, nothing will surprise me. And it\u2019s a journalist\u2019s job to cover stories, wherever they take place in the world. SI\nExcited, fascinated, while also having serious issues with Qatar\u2019s human rights issues, its anti-gay laws and how women are treated. Regarding purely the football matches and being at a World Cup, this writer truly cannot wait. JJ\nUneasy, about participating in an event tainted by corruption, covering games inside stadiums potentially built by people who have died, and the possibility that I will contribute to sportswashing by writing about the actual football. But I also feel better about being here than not, because this World Cup will go ahead with or without journalists, and at least if we are on the ground we can record what we see and hear. EK\nThe correct answer here is probably \u201cconflicted\u201d or \u201cmorally ambivalent\u201d. Actually, I can\u2019t wait. Sitting at home and stewing in righteous outrage is all very well, but we\u2019ve all been doing that for 12 years. Time to get out there and chronicle the whole sickening escapade for posterity. JL\nI don\u2019t know the right answer to this. SL\nQatar should never have got the tournament, and the reasons why have been reported by the media. Now it\u2019s time for the biggest event in the world and that needs covering too. PM\nDetermined, curious, excited but basically quite disturbed by the whole thing. BR\nConflicted. I\u2019ve never been to a World Cup before, so I should be excited. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s impossible to get away from everything surrounding the tournament. JS\nConflicted. I love the Middle East and feel a World Cup staged in the region is overdue but it is a shame this one comes so heavily caveated by the self destructively slow progress made regarding the treatment of construction workers, human rights and women\u2019s freedoms since it was awarded 12 years ago. LT\nSad that a tournament that should be about bringing people together through sport is so debased, by its use as a propaganda tool and by corporate greed. But I find the idea journalists shouldn\u2019t be here bizarre. I\u2019ve been to Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and Cameroon to cover Cups of Nations but that doesn\u2019t mean I endorsed the regimes of Mubarak, Obiang, Bongo or Biya; rather my job was to provide a record, both of the sport and what surrounded it. I\u2019m not sure the world would have benefited had Nick Ames and I sat at home moaning about how awful the Cameroonian government is rather than reporting on January\u2019s tragedy in Yaounde. If people don\u2019t understand that, they don\u2019t understand what journalism is. JW"

                    "body": "A World Cup of protest and rancour has taken another incendiary turn with Germany\u2019s players covering their mouths with their hands to suggest they had been gagged by football\u2019s governing body, Fifa.\nTheir message was reinforced by the German interior minister, Nancy Faeser, who also wore a OneLove armband, which promotes tolerance, diversity and LGBTQ+ rights, as she sat next to Fifa\u2019s president, Gianni Infantino.\n\nIt was a calculated act of defiance against Fifa, who has warned seven nations, including England and Wales, that they will face sporting sanctions if their captains wear OneLove armbands during matches.\nSix players, including captain Manuel Neuer and Manchester City\u2019s Ilkay Gundogan, also wore Adidas boots with rainbow stitching during the team\u2019s shock 2-1 defeat against Japan, while the entire German squad sported tops with rainbow colours on their sleeves in the warm-up.\nIn a strongly worded statement, the Germans made clear their anger, telling Fifa: \u201cWe wanted to use our captain\u2019s armband to take a stand for values that we hold in the Germany national team: diversity and mutual respect. Together with other nations, we wanted our voice to be heard.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t about making a political statement \u2013 human rights are non-negotiable,\u201d it added. \u201cThat should be taken for granted, but it still isn\u2019t the case. That\u2019s why this message is so important to us. Denying us the armband is the same as denying us a voice. We stand by our position.\u201d\nSame-sex relationships are illegal in Qatar and while organisers and Fifa have repeated the message that \u201ceveryone is welcome\u201d during the World Cup (link), it is unclear whether laws that criminalise acts such as kissing in public have been suspended.\nSimilar levels of opaqueness exist when it comes to whether rainbow-coloured flags and clothing is allowed, given the Qataris have taken such attire off some fans. The authorities are still yet to respond to a protest by the Football Association of Wales after fans had rainbow-colour bucket hats removed by security guards before the game against the USA.\nMeanwhile, England are also understood to be monitoring the fallout from Germany\u2019s decision closely, with the Football Association among the countries looking into whether it will be legally possible to challenge Fifa\u2019s threat to impose sporting sanctions wearing the OneLove armband.\nThe FA is deeply unhappy that their captain Harry Kane faced the prospect of an instant booking had he donned it against Iran. Fifa has not specified what sporting sanctions would have meant but the FA was under the firm impression that Kane would have been booked.\n\u201cAs a squad we all stand for it,\u201d England\u2019s goalkeeper, Jordan Pickford, said. \u201cWe all wanted Harry to wear it, but I think the decision got taken out of our hands as a squad and as players. If Harry wore it and got a yellow card and missed the next game it\u2019s not going to be ideal for us.\u201d\nIt remains to be seen if England\u2019s players decide to follow their German counterparts by mounting a different form of protest before playing the USA tomorrow. Gareth Southgate attempted to draw a line under the issue after his side\u2019s 6-2 win over Iran, arguing that he and his players should be allowed to concentrate on their performances on the pitch.\n\nFootball\u2019s governing body later confirmed it would not be censuring the German FA or their players for their protest.\nAsked why they had decided to protest, manager Hansi Flick said: \u201cIt was a sign, a message we wanted to send out and we wanted to deliver the message that Fifa is silencing us.\u201d Striker Kai Havertz also stressed how important it was for Germany\u2019s players to promote diversity and tolerance. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s important for us to make a statement like this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe spoke before the game about what we could do and for us it was the right sign to show the people that we try to help wherever we can. Of course, Fifa makes it not easy for us.\u201d\nFifa did confirm that it had opened disciplinary proceedings against Ecuador over homophobic chanting by their fans in their World Cup opener against Qatar."

He\u2019s won Serie A titles with Juventus and Inter, lifted Premier Leagues and FA Cups with Chelsea, even watched c-beams glitter in the dark near the Turnpike Lane. But he\u2019s never tasted glory in Europe. A single measly Big Cup quarter-final with Juventus in 2013 is the best he\u2019s managed on the continent, if you don\u2019t count nearly winning Big Vase in 2020 with a team containing Ashley Young, Alexis S\u00e1nchez and Victor Moses, which we probably should do, but for the ease of narrative, don\u2019t. Either way, it\u2019s all very strange. Oh oh Antonio!\nIt\u2019d be enough to make the most mild-mannered of men lose their supercool. But as we all know, Po\u2019 Conte is cursed with a short temper, its trigger rather ironically made out of 100% genuine hair. And that snapped on Wednesday night in spectacular fashion, when Harry Kane\u2019s injury-time strike against Sporting, a goal that would have dramatically sent Spurs into Big Cup\u2019s knockout stage, was ruled out after a four-minute VAR consultation. The decision was ultimately the correct one, Kane having been pictured fractionally offside from Emerson Royal\u2019s header milliseconds before whipping home, but the combination of circumstance and interminable wait was always going to end with Conte\u2019s canopy spinning around faster than a Zonophone shellac.\nThe inevitable red card and subsequent post-match press-conference meltdown \u2013 a bravura one-answer soliloquy in which the Tottenham manager questioned the \u201chonesty\u201d of his dismissal and the VAR process \u2013 has met with similarly predictable consequences. Conte is now banned from the dugout for next Tuesday\u2019s decisive match at Marseille, from which Spurs need to take a point if they\u2019re to qualify for the last 16. With their influential manager forced to sit impotently in the stand, and barred from having any contact with his team before or during the game, that\u2019s now far from a given. If they fail to make it, and Conte\u2019s constant demands for significant January investment aren\u2019t met, don\u2019t be totally surprised should Antonio leave Spurs alone-i-o for a new sweetheart.\nLIVE ON BIG WEBSITE\nJoin Barry Glendenning from 5.45pm BST for hot Big Vase MBM coverage of PSV 1-1 Arsenal, while Scott Murray will have you covered for Manchester United 3-0 Sheriff at 8pm.

                    "body": "Fifa should pay reparations of at least $440m (\u00a3356m) to migrant workers whose human rights have been compromised by the Qatar World Cup, a group of non-governmental organisations has said. England and Gareth Southgate have been asked to support the initiative, described as an \u201cinnovative scheme\u201d that would \u201cprovide some real redress\u201d for workers, as attempts to leave a positive legacy for the tournament come into focus six months before the opening World Cup fixture in Doha.  Amnesty International, alongside Human Rights Watch, Football Supporters Europe and the trade union the Building and Wood Workers\u2019 International are among those calling for a remediation scheme that would address the documented failings of human rights protections which have scarred the history of Qatar\u2019s World Cup. According to the organisations, Fifa should \u201creserve an amount not less than the $440m prize money offered to teams participating in the World Cup, to be invested in funds to support remediation. This would represent just a small percentage of Fifa\u2019s anticipated $6bn revenues from the tournament and the $1.6bn it holds in reserves. \u201cThis amount reflects a likely \u2018floor\u2019 for the scale of harm suffered. The final amount required for remedy will be determined by the scale of the need, the harms to be redressed and reparation measures to be offered, should be decided through a participatory process and subject to an independent evaluation.\u201d Sacha Deshmukh, the CEO of Amnesty International UK, called on England to support the idea. \u201cWe hope the FA and Gareth Southgate and the players will back this innovative scheme,\u201d he said. \u201cInternational football can easily afford to do the right thing here. This is a comparatively small share of Fifa\u2019s enormous prize money pot \u2013 and it would provide some real redress for the serious human rights violations that underpin this tournament.\u201d Fifa, in response, said it was \u201cassessing\u201d the proposals. It said it had put in place \u201can unprecedented due diligence process\u201d in relation to the protection of workers and \u2013 alongside the Qatari Supreme Committee responsible for tournament \u2013 had devised its own remediation processes. This includes $22.6m transferred to workers by the end of 2021 to redress the particular issue of recruitment fees often paid by migrant workers to agencies or brokers to secure employment. Qatari authorities reacted angrily to the proposal. The ministry of labour said \u201cQatar is proud of the reforms it has introduced\u201d and that progress in labour reforms was \u201cirrefutable\u201d. It said \u00a3110m of payments previously owed to migrant workers had been distributed via the government\u2019s Workers\u2019 Support and Insurance Fund.  \u201cDuring this decade-long process we have engaged openly with NGOs that have been consistently critical of Qatar,\u201d a statement from the ministry said. \u201cThe new report undermines much of the goodwill that has been generated.\u201d "

                    "body": "\nThe main event\nFor a country perceived by many as having something of a tenuous relationship with the sport of soccer, the United States of America has made quite a contribution to the culture at the very top of the game. They\u2019ve reached the semi-final of one World Cup (1930), hosted another (1994) and registered one of the all-time great shocks (1950) in which their supposed elders and betters, the self-styled fathers of the game, were handed their asses in a high hat. Throw in the garish but fondly remembered NASL, an all-senses assault which attracted nearly as many superstars as Studio 54, and that\u2019s a sizeable legacy. And this is all before we get to the USWNT, four-time winners of the Women\u2019s World Cup and reigning champions. They\u2019ve more than done their bit on that side of the briny.\nSo you can bet your bottom dollar that the Netherlands won\u2019t be daft enough to underestimate the USMNT as the knockout stage of the 2022 World Cup kicks off on Saturday afternoon. The Dutch sailed through their group without drama, albeit without making too much of a case that they can go deep. Louis van Gaal however had no truck with reporters berating his side for lacking the wow factor and can legitimately point to the humiliations of neighbours Germany and Belgium, both significantly hyped going into this tournament, as a useful metric to measure his own team\u2019s under-the-radar fuss-free competence. The Netherlands also possess one of this World Cup\u2019s breakout hits in Cody Gakpo, with his variety pack of three goals in three games. Few gave the Dutch too much of a chance in 2010 or 2014 either, and look what so nearly happened then.\n\nHistorical precedent and optimistic spin only get you so far, though. The Dutch are good but not out of the top drawer, certainly not by their own lofty standards, and the USA will fancy their chances of springing a surprise. Despite only scoring two goals in the group, Gregg Berhalter\u2019s team have received good notices for their attacking intentions. Sergi\u00f1o Dest and Antonee Robinson maraud along the flanks in the modern style. Tyler Adams, Yusuf Musah and Weston McKennie are urgent presences in midfield. Meanwhile centre-back Tim Ream is enjoying an Indian summer at 35, the US posting back-to-back clean sheets at a finals for the first time since that aforementioned romp to the semis in 1930.\nIn fact, they\u2019ve yet to concede a goal from open play in Qatar, and have only shipped nine in the 15 matches they\u2019ve played this calendar year. The containment of the seemingly irrepressible Gakpo would be another feather in their cap. The question would then be: can Virgil van Dijk et al do a similar number on the up-and-coming Timothy Weah? If the US start clicking in attack, Van Gaal could be off to manage Belgium sooner than expected. SM\nTalking points\nGhana miss another fateful penaltyIf Uruguay intended to get inside their opponents\u2019 heads by putting Luis Su\u00e1rez \u2013 that is, \u201cthe devil himself\u201d \u2013 up for media duties before their game against Ghana, they will feel it worked as intended. Whether or not mind games had anything to do with the way this match played out, Andr\u00e9 Ayew\u2019s saved penalty \u2013 swiftly followed by two goals from Giorgian de Arrascaeta \u2013 inevitably drew parallels to the way Asamoah Gyan squandered the spot kick which resulted from Su\u00e1rez\u2019s infamous handball in Johannesburg. \u201cThis penalty miss put Ghana back in 2010,\u201d said Didier Drogba at half-time. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to come back after missing a penalty like this.\u201d So it proved, though Uruguay still failing to progress thanks to events elsewhere at least provided a hint of cosmic justice. WM\n\nSouth Korea dispel group-stage curseHaving extended their 100% winning record against Portugal, South Korea have avoided another early exit from the World Cup. Having gone out at the group stage in 2018, 2014 and 2006, they were in danger of falling at the first hurdle for a fourth time in five attempts before Hwang Hee-chan\u2019s late, late winner. The last time they reached the last 16, in 2010, they were dumped out by Uruguay, with Su\u00e1rez scoring twice. Again, there is a satisfying circularity to South Korea being the side to deny the Uruguayans a place in the knockout rounds. WM\nBeyond the football\nA video shared on social media appears to show presenters on a Qatari television programme enjoying Germany\u2019s exit while mocking the team\u2019s stance on human rights. In the clip, presenters wave goodbye to Germany while clamping hands over their mouths \u2013 a send-up of a gesture that the German team had made before their opening defeat by Japan on 23 November in protest against Fifa\u2019s decision to stop them wearing One Love armbands. \u201cHuman rights are non-negotiable. That should be taken for granted,\u201d the German Football Association said in words that those Qatari TV presenters could do with reading again and trying to understand.\nAnd here\u2019s the celebrated visual satirist Cold War Steve takes on protests and power struggles at the Qatar World Cup. GB\n\nGlobal media-watch\nIt was a \u201cwinter nightmare\u201d (S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung), an \u201cenormous embarrassment\u201d (Bild), a \u201cnew low point\u201d that revealed the four-times world champions to have shrunken into a \u201cfootball dwarf\u201d (Spiegel). Ouch. Germany\u2019s players and coaching staff hopefully avoided Thursday morning\u2019s front pages after crashing out at the group stage for the second tournament in a row.\nNewspapers and websites in Japan were the polar opposite. \u201cSamurai spirit: Japan explodes with World Cup joy,\u201d cheered Japan Today after the wild 2-1 comeback win over Spain. \u201cCaptain Yoshida rewrites history,\u201d roared the Chunichi Shimbun. \u201cWorld Cup redemption,\u201d said The Mainichi, recalling manager Hajime Moriyasu\u2019s experience of being beaten by Iraq in Doha in 1993, which cost the nation a place at USA 94. In the Japan Times, repetition was the only way they could get their heads around the achievement. \u201cJapan is in the last 16 \u2026 Japan is in the last 16 \u2026 Japan is in the last 16 \u2026 The more accurate the sentence becomes, the more improbable and fantastical it feels, as though it flowed from the pen of Terry Pratchett or J.R.R. Tolkien.\u201d GB\n\nThe internet reacts\nThe whistle had barely blown on Japan\u2019s win over Spain before various homemade versions of footballs hovering over bylines were being posted on Twitter. They seem rather nerdy \u2013 and some of the footballs look suspiciously like they were shop-bought on Wednesday night \u2013 but given many seasoned observers of the game were struggling to understand the basics of physics and perspective, perhaps the home videos and DIY explainers are useful. Here are a selection of them. GB\n\n\nOk, yes, we\u2019ve been at it too.\n\nFriday\u2019s final group games also provided a couple of meme-worthy moments. First, here\u2019s Granit Xhaka with an internationally-recognised gesture towards the Serbian bench. Earlier, Edinson Cavani gave the kind of violent takedown of VAR that would have Graeme Souness chuckling malevolently.\n\nToday\u2019s matches\nNetherlands v USA (Round of 16, 3pm GMT, BBC1)\u201cIf you think it\u2019s boring why don\u2019t you go home?\u201d That was Louis van Gaal\u2019s response to a journalist who suggested the Netherlands, despite easing through as Group A winners, have failed to light the tournament up. Van Gaal is predictably refusing to go quietly, if indeed this does prove to be his last World Cup, and his tactical mind is as sharp as ever. On the pitch Cody Gakpo is scoring goals, while at the other end Virgil van Dijk is marshalling a miserly defence. As England discovered in the group, though, the USA are an accomplished outfit and difficult to break down, while Christian Pulisic should feature despite being injured in the win against Iran. Van Gaal\u2019s last stand? He would be delighted to grind into the last eight, and prolong one of Qatar\u2019s best stories. LMc\nArgentina v Australia (Round of 16, 7pm GMT, BBC1)Lionel Messi performed with devastating intent in the concluding Group C victory against Poland. It was a vintage display of dangerous dribbling and perceptive passing; clearly he has no intention of wasting what should be his last shot at a World Cup. Are Australia intimidated? Not a bit. \u201cHe\u2019s just a human, as we all are,\u201d said Socceroos defender Milos Degenek. Messi aside, for all the quality in their squad, the feeling persists that Argentina are vulnerable following their early defeat by Saudi Arabia. Buoyed by progress to the last 16 for the first time since 2006, Australia will be determined and wily opponents. At a World Cup of shocks: why not? LMc\n\nPlayer to watch\nMemphis Depay To British fans, the forward is mostly known for his unsuccessful stay at Manchester United. Whether he failed or the club failed him is open to debate. Now at Barcelona via a spell at Lyon, the 28-year-old is at his peak. He made his first start of the tournament in the Netherlands\u2019 2-0 win against Qatar and performed well, involved in both goals. Louis van Gaal could be persuaded that Depay can play a major role in the Oranje\u2019s assault on the knockout rounds. \u201cDream Believe Achieve\u201d is tattooed on Depay\u2019s chest: He has the blueprint to go with talent and experience. A dangerous opponent and a world-class foil to the headline-grabbing Gakpo. LMc\n\nAnd finally \u2026\nYou might think a renowned manager such as Luis Enrique \u2013 \u201cI am the best coach on the face of the earth\u201d \u2013 would be hyperaware when his own nation, Spain, could be in danger of getting booted out of the finals. But no, he says he didn\u2019t have a clue that his team had slipped to third in the as-it-stands table on Thursday evening. \u201cWere we knocked out at some point? \u2026 When? Why?\u201d he asked bemused journalists. \u201cYou see? Well, fantastic \u2026 Of course. I didn\u2019t know. At no point did I find out \u2026 [if I had known we were] out three minutes, I would have had a heart attack.\u201d It\u2019s probably for the best Germany mounted a rapid comeback against Costa Rica.

In his first appearance since missing a penalty against France that ultimately cost England the chance to progress in Qatar, Kane found himself on the receiving end of taunts from home supporters at the Gtech Community Stadium, with some suggesting he had let his country down. Kane responded in typical fashion \u2013 scoring with a 65th-minute header that sparked a comeback from Spurs after they had found themselves 2-0 down against Thomas Frank\u2019s side. \u201cI have zero doubt about his quality, about his mentality, about the way he approached every game and every training session,\u201d Conte said of the striker. \u201cHe\u2019s facing a strange situation because he played a really good World Cup. I think that also because he played a good World Cup and the team played the quarter-final, then he missed this penalty.   \u201cIt was a decisive penalty for England. But you know very well, football is this. You can have positive or negative moments. If you are strong mentally, if you are a top player, if you are a player of a big, big level, then there is a moment you have to put to one side a negative situation and move on. I think Harry did this. \u201cI repeat we are talking about a really, really good player and especially a good person. For this reason, our fans and also the fans of the other teams should clap him.\u201d Kane\u2019s header was followed by an assured finish by Pierre-Emile H\u00f8jbjerg on 71 minutes, cancelling out goals either side of half-time from Vitaly Janelt and Ivan Toney. It was the ninth consecutive match in which Spurs had conceded first and Conte admitted having mixed feelings about the result. \u201cI have to be happy for the reaction, for the way we played in the second half of the game, but not only the way we scored two goals, but the energy, the desire, the intensity that we played,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you play in this way for sure you create a lot of problems for your opponent. \u201cIn the other side, this is nine games in a row that we conceded the first goal. This is not positive because, understand we have great character, understand that we have a great reaction, understand that we believe in ourselves but at the same time it\u2019s important to be stable for a team that wants to try to stay in a good position in the table.\u201d"

                    "body": "Did the US reach their potential in Qatar? Probably. Inexperience told in the end, as it usually does, and proved their undoing. By exceeding the expectations of a general public that leaned pessimistic after the Americans\u2019 failure to qualify in 2018, yet falling short of what the team expected from themselves, I\u2019d say they hit it right on the nose. BAG It\u2019s a fair reflection of where the US stand right now. They can go head-to-head with anyone, but they can be beaten by more experienced teams, and the possession game breaks down because they have no direct option to vary the attack. BD Performance review: meets expectations. Losing to more clinical and streetwise opponents in the first knockout stage? Normal service has been resumed after the 2018 blip. But, had they performed at their best, did this team have the capacity to shock the Netherlands? Yeah. Even without an elite-level striker and little depth off the bench. So no recriminations, just regrets. TD Given the history of the US\u2019s performance at the World Cup, a round of 16 exit would have to be considered a par score. But given the quality in the squad and the limp manner of the loss to the Netherlands, it\u2019s hard not to be left with the sense that this team should have done better. AT Best US player \u2026  Tyler Adams. His lone mistake of the tournament was a costly one: failing to track Memphis Depay\u2019s run before he scored Saturday\u2019s opening goal. But the Leeds United midfielder, who was announced as the US captain one day before the opener against Wales, more than lived up to the role, both on and off the pitch. BAG Tempting to say Adams, who led the team in all the nerdy stats showing how effective he truly was, but Christian Pulisic was involved in every goal despite taking a beating from opponents and suffering a nasty injury against Iran. BD At various points you could make arguments for Adams, Pulisic, Tim Ream and Tim Weah. Overall \u2013 though he wasn\u2019t over-taxed in the group stage \u2013 Matt Turner was irreproachable. Adams was an admirable on- and off-field leader, but his only glaring mistake (not tracking Depay for the Netherlands\u2019 first goal) proved crucial. TD It\u2019s got to be one of the Tims and I\u2019m going with Weah, a springy presence on the right flank who scored the best American goal of the World Cup and was often responsible, in combination with Sergi\u00f1o Dest, for many of the US\u2019s most rewarding moments in attack. AT Most disappointing US player \u2026 Jes\u00fas Ferreira. The FC Dallas forward\u2019s inclusion in the squad over Ricardo Pepi (or Jordan Pefok) will go down as one of the USMNT\u2019s all-time WTF squad decisions, so it\u2019s almost not his fault. But Ferreira was useless when finally called into action on Saturday due to Josh Sargent\u2019s injury after not playing at all in the group stage. BAG May seem unfair to give it to someone who only played 45 minutes, but Ferreira had to be better than that. The starters generally played as expected or better. BD None of them. The only sustained bad performance was Ferreira\u2019s feckless 45 minutes against the Dutch, but he was unwisely thrown in at the deep end for his World Cup debut. Hard to blame him for the coach\u2019s error in not putting Weah at center forward. Inexcusably, Gio Reyna had an entire half but didn\u2019t dribble past six Dutch defenders and score from 35 yards. TD Their non-goalscoring forward (take your pick between any of the three who were handed starts: Sargent, Haji Wright, or Ferreira). The team combined well in attack but the lack of a first-class finisher was pretty straightforwardly glaring in all four matches. The image of Wright spurning a jewel of a chance against the Dutch then scoring when he didn\u2019t mean to offered a cruelly accurate summary of the team\u2019s finishing woes. AT Should Gregg Berhalter stay as coach?  No. Berhalter will always be remembered fondly for his principal role in nursing the program back from the trauma of their failure to qualify for the 2018 World Cup: the rare US coach who will leave the team better off than he found it. But standing pat with a steady hand isn\u2019t worth the risk of holding this young group back with tactical rigidity and questionable decision-making. BAG No. It\u2019s telling that the US outplayed all four opponents in the first half and then stayed on the back foot in most of the second halves they played. And in general, a coach staying for more than one cycle simply isn\u2019t the best way to progress. Give him a solid \u201cB\u201d for his effort and wish him well as he takes over a team in MLS. Or the Eredivisie. BD If he wants to, sure. The players like him and a country previously known for a direct and physical style just played some of the most exciting and ambitious soccer in the tournament and only lost to the Dutch \u2013 the Dutch! \u2013 because of individual errors. If we\u2019re expecting that this young team will grow with experience and peak in 2026, shouldn\u2019t we also believe the same is true for the coach? TD No. Despite impressive spells of possession, some slick passing, and a few nice runs into wide areas, the US couldn\u2019t score. This felt like a failure on Berhalter\u2019s part to pick a starting XI with the right combination of players to engineer a route to goal. There was a tactical rigidity to Berhalter\u2019s selections, his substitutions and mid-match decision making were generally uninspiring, and he also must bear some of the responsibility for the deficiencies in defense and game management on display against the Dutch. Berhalter has done well to get US soccer back on track after the debacle of 2017, and his diplomat\u2019s work in squad assembly \u2013 scouring the globe for promising potential recruits with ancestral connections to the US \u2013 has been impressive, but it\u2019s time for a fresh start. The squad is strong. A better manager would get more out of it. AT Best US moment On the field? It\u2019s hard to pick against Pulisic\u2019s winner against Iran that lifted the US into the knockout stage and settled a politically fraught rematch a quarter-century in the making. Off it, Adams\u2019s confident, assured response to an Iranian journalist who asked him to answer for America\u2019s legacy of inequality and racial discrimination. BAG A few years ago, Alexi Lalas called out this team as \u201ctattooed millionaires.\u201d In Qatar, there were many moments that showed the grit they\u2019ve developed despite years of coddling in US academies. None more than Pulisic sacrificing his body to score the goal that sent the US through. BD Wright\u2019s fluke goal against the Netherlands. Not only for the five minutes of hope it bestowed, but because it defied the laws of physics and should be studied by scientists for years to come. How is it possible to loop the ball high into the far corner while facing away from the goal towards the corner flag? TD The goal against Wales. Pace in transition, efficiency of movement, a cultured finish with the outside of the boot: Weah\u2019s strike was a video-game goal that whet the appetite for what the US might achieve in Qatar. More of this in 2026, please. AT Who will win this World Cup?  Brazil. With an embarrassment of attacking riches and a clearer path to the semi-finals than they could dream of, the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o are right on course for their sixth star. After a titanic showdown with Argentina in the last four, Richarlison and co will take care of unfinished business with the French in a classic final. BAG I\u2019ll stick with England because I\u2019m a sucker for punishment. Also because they dismantled Iran, and we saw in the next two Iranian games that such a feat should not be taken for granted. BD Argentina, France or Brazil. The South American sides are the most gifted in the top half of the draw (with Argentina\u2019s main talent being to do just enough while hinting at the potential for more) while the French, though they live dangerously at times, have the tournament\u2019s best player. TD France. Could this be the World Cup where Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 announces himself to the world? (Insert irony emoji.) AT Very early prediction for 2026 \u2026 If you think Twitter is bad now, just you wait until England v USA in the 2026 World Cup final. BAG The good news: US players are working their way into the European club elite. The bad news: That means they\u2019ll be playing tons of games in domestic and European play, and they\u2019ll come into the World Cup exhausted. They\u2019ll suffer three key injuries leading into the tournament, they won\u2019t have the depth to compensate, and they\u2019ll depart in the group stage. Or they\u2019ll stay healthy and make the semi-finals. Canada will make the quarter-finals. BD Battle-hardened after being invited into (and hosting?) the 2024 Copa Am\u00e9rica, the US beat a European team and reach the quarter-finals; a nation rejoices. Touchline footwear fashionista Berhalter swaps his Air Jordans for his own line of Gregg-branded sneakers. The Dutch play in Los Angeles and Denzel Washington seeks out Denzel Dumfries for an autograph. TD The US and Canada will both make the quarter-finals \u2013 after Qatar\u2019s lame showing here, we all want to see at least one decent host run at the next tournament \u2013 the success of the 48-team format will convince Fifa to stage a 96-team tournament across three different continents in 2030, and France will become the first nation to win three World Cups in a row.

                    "body": "Gareth Southgate has admitted some of his younger England players felt the weight of the shirt during a high\u2011stress Nations League get-together. The manager was the focal point for criticism after the 1-0 defeat against Italy in Milan last Friday, the travelling fans booing him at full time. The result had followed the 4-0 home defeat against Hungary in June when Southgate was also jeered \u2013 the final tie in a sequence of four, which started with the away loss against Hungary and took in draws with Germany and Italy.  The fear was that the negativity would hold the team back and they wobbled in the Wembley game with Germany on Monday, falling 2-0 behind in the second half. But Southgate was delighted with the quality and character they showed to take a 3-2 lead, even though a soft, late concession gave Germany a draw \u2013 feeling the emotion and experience would bolster them for the World Cup in Qatar, which kicks off in late November.  \u201cThey have been through a lot and the psychology of it all is fascinating for us,\u201d Southgate said.  \u201cDifferent expectations, different levels of experience in the group. Some young ones that are actually handling it brilliantly and some that are needing help and guidance. They will be thinking: \u2018What is this?\u2019 \u201cWe have talked about how the shirt feels and they are experiencing for the first time a little bit what some of the older ones have been through in the past. That [comeback against Germany] is what we want. That\u2019s the style of play that we know they are capable of. We have to keep instilling the belief and the confidence in them to be able to do it.\u201d Southgate pushed the theme of resilience in adversity and he applied it specifically to Harry Maguire, the Manchester United defender, who has lost his place at club level and continues to live under an unforgiving spotlight; he was badly at fault for Germany\u2019s first goal and he lost the ball in the buildup to their second. Southgate has said that Maguire\u2019s prospects would become \u201cmore complicated\u201d if his lack of football at United persisted for the \u201cseven to eight weeks\u201d leading up to the World Cup. The manager added on Monday night that he had to \u201cfocus on our best players \u2013 unless that situation becomes untenable\u201d. He has given himself the wriggle room to drop Maguire in Qatar. But his backing for one of his key lieutenants remains strong.  \u201cI know everybody says he\u2019s important to me \u2013 he\u2019s important to us,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cIt\u2019s us. It\u2019s not me. Why do we pick him? Because he\u2019s one of the players who gives us the best chance of winning. We should all be wanting a Harry Maguire that\u2019s playing regularly and playing with confidence. \u201cThat applies, of course, to quite a few players but he\u2019s the one that everything lands on, which must be a tough space for him. But he\u2019s showing tremendous character. He has got the character to get over this because he\u2019s a boy that has been from Sheffield United to Hull City \u2026 he\u2019s not one where everything has been smooth.\u201d Southgate suggested that Trent Alexander-Arnold faced a battle for inclusion in the 26-man World Cup squad, as he was behind Kieran Trippier in the right-back pecking order \u2013 not to mention Reece James. Trippier\u2019s ability to play on the left side is another point in his favour. Southgate also explained why he omitted Alexander-Arnold from the 23-man match-day squad against Germany, having left out the left\u2011back, Ben Chilwell, against Italy. \u201cFirstly I didn\u2019t want any player to sit in the stand for two matches,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cAgainst Italy we didn\u2019t need the left-back cover [on the bench]; against Germany, we did because of the way we went with the team, so we needed Chilly on the bench. And we had Kieran who, at the moment \u2026 I feel his all-round game is ahead [of Alexander-Arnold]. \u201cI\u2019ve had long conversations with all of them [who have been left out]. I\u2019ve been very clear with them about where they stand, what they need to improve upon, what they\u2019re doing well. They\u2019re very clear on where they sit.\u201d Southgate will not see his players again until 14 November when they report for the World Cup. They travel to Qatar the next day and their opening fixture comes against Iran on 21 November. \u201cThis tournament is unique,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cWe don\u2019t get the four weeks we had ahead of Russia at the last World Cup. We have to adapt better than anybody else.\u201d"

                    "body": "England face France in the World Cup quarter-final on Saturday and the dwindling band of psychic animals has spoken. In the early stages of any World Cup, of course, you cannot move for obliging creatures predicting match results. However, as the tournament progresses, several of this global menagerie will have a shocker, effectively knocking them out of further opportunities to have their random movements anthropomorphised by pushy human keepers/people who reckon there might be two hundred quid in it from a tabloid. As we near the business end of Qatar 2022, though, a psychic alpaca from Chipping Norton is still in it, along with a lion in Thailand. Inauspiciously, both have wandered vaguely in one direction in their enclosure/predicted a France win on Saturday night, which I assume has led to accusations of talking England down, and a slew of credible death threats.\nNot that a perfect record insulates any creature from meeting a sticky end themselves. Rabio the octopus was the Japan-based mollusc oracle who accurately forecast every Japan result in the group stages of the 2018 World Cup, yet he was reported by a local news outlet to have been chopped up and eaten before the round of 16. (Which certainly puts the BBC not renewing Mark Lawrenson\u2019s contract into perspective. Though not, perhaps, for Mark.)\nStill, a nation awaits, and we are where we somehow always are at this stage of things: waiting it out against a backdrop of mid-level English madness. Alongside the various animal attempts to people-please are an increasingly deranged series of stunts from the tabloids, who in days of yore would hit some national pulse with this sort of stuff, but now come across as having only recently learned human from a textbook.\n\nWhat\u2019s brought it all on? Rupert Murdoch was recently said to be incensed that the Daily Star\u2019s can-this-lettuce-outlast-Liz-Truss stunt went around the world, believing it to be classic Sun territory into which the paper had somehow failed to plant its flag. Perhaps consequently, readers are inflicted with near daily attempts to chase that dream. These have tipped into the advanced stages of something or other, if Friday\u2019s headline \u201cWalker\u2019s Got Mbapp\u00e9 In Pocket\u201d is anything to go by. On closer clinical inspection, this turned out to be a reference to a pair of jeans the Sun has had specially made up, which bear a leather label reading \u201cKYLE WALKER JEANS CO\u201d and which feature a printed image of Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 peeking out of the back pocket. I mean \u2026 guys? Is everyone involved in this idea OK?\nWhile that question remains tantalisingly unanswered, the signs don\u2019t look good, considering the Sun\u2019s self-styled \u201cjean-ius\u201d stunt incredibly contrives to be even worse than Thursday\u2019s high-concept coverage, which involved finding a 16-year-old kid in Leicester whose name is also Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, and who said he reckoned England would beat the French. According to the report, this teenager also said \u201call my friends are Three Lions-mad\u201d, and told the paper: \u201cI\u2019d pick a sausage roll over a croque monsieur any day.\u201d And yet, did he? Did he really? Did a Leicester teen honestly fix the Sun\u2019s reporter with a discerning metaphorical eye and go: \u201cI\u2019d pick a sausage roll over a croque monsieur any day\u201d? I somehow find it impossible to hear those words without also hearing the words; \u201cNo boss, I didn\u2019t tape it but I\u2019ve got a contemporaneous note\u201d.\n\nThe only saving grace at this familiarly ominous stage of a tournament is that politicians have largely stayed out of the football \u2013 though we have to countenance the possibility that might not continue should England defy the all-seeing animals and beat France. Rishi Sunak\u2019s speech at the annual parliamentary lobby drinks at Downing Street on Thursday night was reportedly full of football jokes, which confirms that a) he didn\u2019t write it and b) there could be worse to come. The prime minister certainly posted a sensationally tone-deaf tweet before last weekend\u2019s Senegal game, chirping: \u201cHats off to Qatar for hosting an incredible World Cup so far.\u201d This fell comfortably into the you-had-one-job category, though may simply be based on his assessment that weapons will soon be our last remaining export.\n\nIn general, though, England\u2019s tournament has been greatly enhanced by ministers not feeling the need to define themselves by Having A View on it all. This state of affairs reached a hideous nadir during the Boris Johnson administration, which had lost twice to Marcus Rashford on free school meals, and appeared horribly sore about it. The Euros last year were marred by any number of senior ministers failing to condemn the booing of players for taking the knee before games. In fact, some even appeared to support it, and barely a day went by without one or other secretary of state who was utterly failing in their job feeling the need to pontificate at players doing rather better in theirs \u2013 right up until the racist abuse suffered by black stars in the wake of England\u2019s final loss made it perfectly clear why many felt the need for the gesture.\nThis England side itself may have rather less chance of advancing to the final than they did in summer 2021. But the absence of ministers feeling the need to muscle in on every moment of it all has felt like welcome progress of a different sort, and a bizarrely overdue reminder that these major tournaments can actually happen with precisely zero input from people no one wishes to hear from on footballing matters, and who have rather more pressing things to do with their time than be wrong about how others choose to use theirs. Let\u2019s hope this period of silence continues; otherwise it might be time to set the psychic animals on to election polling predictions.\nMarina Hyde\u2019s World Cup Week will appear each Friday during the tournament"

Welcome to the Fifa Technical Study Group weekly media briefing at the Qatar National Convention Centre in Doha.\nQatar is a place of constant piped music, most of it weirdly jarring. Walking down a gleaming gantry at a half-constructed training complex hangar? You\u2019ll be wanting some Howard Jones. Shopping for groceries? Here\u2019s a super-slow orchestral arrangement of More Than Words by Extreme that will nag away at your brain for almost three weeks before finally revealing itself, horribly, in the pastry aisle.\n\nFor the buildup to the Fifa Technical Study Group media briefing, as scattered microphone fluffers and media footsoldiers enter the chilled air of Virtual Stadium Hall One, the selected warm-up music is an urgent, full-length recording of Highway To Hell by AC/DC. Which does at least generate a much-needed, if ultimately rather misleading, sense of urgency.\nThese occasions are part of the treadmill of Big Football events. Qatar 2022 has hit its last, choreographed deep breaths, the bridge before the final push. It is now time for the football version of those moments in The Office where we watch the printer trays whirring, blank sheets loading, something to feed the machine between the beats.\nThis is when we get the Fifa Technical Study Group media briefing, there to fill the empty air with words. Although in fairness there was a buzz of static around the Study Group briefing on Monday morning, that wide, luminous stage arranged with seven potently empty chairs, like the set for the world\u2019s worst Westlife reunion gig.\nThe excitement in the room was in part because this place is now shot through with its own event glamour, the venue for That Speech by Gianni Infantino. And secondly because the last time the Study Group appeared in public Ars\u00e8ne Wenger breached protocol by accidentally saying something interesting.\nThose comments at the end of the group stage were widely reported. According to Wenger, who was actually just there to talk about pressing and quick throw-ins, the most successful teams were those \u201cwho had the mindset to focus on the competition and not on political demonstrations\u201d. Or in other words, zip it and stick to football.\nAh, Ars\u00e8ne. How did they get to you? Wenger loves Fifa these days. He is basically Fifa\u2019s Gandalf, a craggy, legitimising, wizard-ish presence. But he is also 100% wrong, as demonstrated by those nations who progressed while waving the Palestinian rights flag.\n\nNever mind the basic impossibility of keeping politics out of something staged entirely for and by politicians. Or indeed the fact this is from a man who previously raged about financial iniquity and waste, who may have coined the phrase \u201dfinancial doping\u201d, but who is now out there acting as a public thought-policeman for football\u2019s carbon-dealers. Funny how perspectives change.\nSadly there would be no Ars\u00e8ne today. Even Fifa seems to have noticed Wenger has gone a bit wild-eyed-uncle-in-the-shed. Instead we had a lineup of familiar old pros, lounging on their low steel chairs: Cha Du-ri of South Korea, Faryd Mondrag\u00f3n from Colombia, Sunday Oliseh of Nigeria, Alberto Zaccheroni of Italy, the Swiss Pascal Zuberb\u00fchler, plus the man introduced as \u201ccaptain\u201d of the Technical Group, J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann.\nThis was at least some consolation. Klinsmann has already caused his own stir on BBC TV by lumping together a list of disparate nations \u2013 sole common element: not being western European \u2013 as keepers of a shared culture of cheating.\nCarlos Queiroz urged Klinsmann to resign. But he seems to be still here, his role now to be less unreliable, less of a loose cannon, than Wenger. Plus of course, there is always that strangely moreish voice.\nFor a long time Klinsmann spoke in the voice of a sad Californian robot boy who just wants to understand the meaning of the word love. He has now become sassier, communicating in the uplifting tones of a Las Vegas dinner theatre host who will eventually rip off his velcro tuxedo and join the high-kicking chorus. \u201cOh my God we have these discussions \u2026 twennyfourseven,\u201d Klinsmann confided early on.\n\nIt isn\u2019t hard to see why, because this is essentially pub chat, and quite deliberately so. Klinsmann said that if Harry Kane had taken his second penalty without a VAR interruption he would have scored. Maybe! But he also waited ages for the first one. Klinsmann said passing the ball a lot like Spain is probably overdoing it. He called Croatia \u201ca young nation\u201d, which may or may not be a good thing to say to a Croat.\nThe other guys all said stuff too, although none of it seemed that technical. Cha said \u201cAsian players are less intimidated\u201d than previously, one of those things you say when you\u2019re sort of verbally sub-Tweeting someone. \u201cThe Japanese manager was born in Japan and still showed amazing tactical skills,\u201d he added, and you knew what he meant.\nOliseh made a rousing plea for African coaches to be given greater opportunities. Zuberb\u00fchler and Mondrag\u00f3n then delivered a passionate two-hander about goalkeepers, who they seem to see as some kind of oppressed minority, like Iranian women or freckled redhead boys.\nIf Zuberb\u00fchler seemed a little overexcited about the rise in penalty saves to 34%, there was at least a hint here of exactly why Fifa does these things, of the deep meaning of the Fifa Technical Study Group weekly media briefing.\nThe job here, like everywhere else, is to reinforce and justify every aspect of this World Cup. Zuberb\u00fchler was basically talking about how successful he thinks Fifa\u2019s new rules about staying on the goalline are. Earlier Zaccheroni had hymned the \u201ctechnical\u201d effects of five subs and masses of extra time.\nNothing is bad in this room. Everything is good, better, progress. At some stage everyone on stage parroted the (arguable) line that this World Cup is a showcase for emerging powers \u2013 because, of course, this is a way of selling the expanded version next time out.\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to the US, Mexico and Canada. More countries, 48 nations and we will see even more surprises,\u201d Klinsmann robot-boyed towards the end and you felt a kind of glaze wash over you, the familiar haze of approved Fifa truth in an approved Fifa zone inside this painted-backdrop of a World Cup.\nThe best way to get the real point of this exercise is probably to turn back to the end of Russia 2018, when the last Technical Study Group offered up its 140-page glossy report. Among the stat padding and weirdly meaningless pull quotes from Carlos Alberto Parreira, the most telling bit of copy is Zvonimir Boban\u2019s foreword, which calls Russia \u201ca beacon of hope and beauty\u201d and concludes: \u201cIn Russia, they made us fall in love with our game all over again.\u201d Follow that, Ars\u00e8ne. The technical bar is high."

                    "body": "1) England 0 USA 1, Brazil 1950\nThe biggest World Cup upset up to that point in the competition\u2019s history and one so shocking that some newspapers assumed the wire report of a 1-0 final score was a typo and so instead reported that England had won 10-0. That is a myth, apparently, but nobody could blame editors at the time for not believing the turn of events in Belo Horizonte. An England team featuring players such as Billy Wright, Tom Finney and Stan Mortensen were meant to wipe the floor with an American side made up largely of amateurs who had arrived in Brazil having trained for only a week together. Even their own manager, Bill Jeffrey, described them as \u201c\u2018sheep ready to be slaughtered\u201d, but in their second group game they performed like lions, taking the lead through a 38th-minute header from Joe Gaetjens, a Haitian-born dishwasher from New York, and holding on during a second-half onslaught from England to complete the so-called \u201cMiracle on Grass\u201d.\n\n2) Italy 0 North Korea 1, England 1966\nIt\u2019s hard to think of North Korea as plucky little underdogs but that was very much the case on a July evening at Ayresome Park as a nation featuring at the World Cup finals tournament for a first time came up against the two-time winners of the competition. According to most, North Korea stood no chance of prevailing, especially given they went into what was the final round of fixtures in Group 4 having lost 3-0 against the Soviet Union and drawn 1-1 with Chile. Italy had beaten Chile 2-0 but then lost 1-0 against the Soviet Union so were vulnerable, but they should have breezed to victory in Middlesbrough. Instead, however, they were undone just before half-time via a low shot from a little-known midfielder who is now part of pub quiz folklore: Pak Doo-ik. \u201cThe North Koreans take the lead \u2013 what a sensation!\u201d the BBC commentator Frank Bough roared, and it really was. That North Korea held on and qualified for the quarter-finals at Italy\u2019s expense made it even more so.\n\n3) Argentina 1 Saudi Arabia 2, Qatar 2022\nThe latest World Cup may be a regrettable one but it has already produced one of the greatest upsets in the competition\u2019s history. Saudi Arabia arrived at the Lusail Stadium ranked 51st in the world \u2013 a place below Qatar \u2013 and found themselves coming up against a team unbeaten in 36 matches, a run during which they have also become Copa Am\u00e9rica champions. They also had a certain Lionel Messi in their ranks. Argentina should have won with ease but instead were undone through a combination of their own sluggishness and a display of great togetherness and ambition by their opponents. Crucially, Herv\u00e9 Renard\u2019s men also had a cutting edge, cancelling out Messi\u2019s 10th-minute penalty via two well-taken second-half goals, scored by Saleh al-Shehri and Salem al-Dawsari. Argentina reacted with increased intensity but Saudi Arabia stood firm and, eventually, were able to celebrate a result of genuine shock and awe.\n\n4) Argentina 0 Cameroon 1, Italy 1990\nAs difficult as it is for football fans in their forties to accept, Italia \u201890 was not a good World Cup. What is for sure, however, is that it started with an almighty bang. Cameroon arrived at the tournament with little pedigree or form and with a squad largely made up of journeymen from France\u2019s second division who were constantly at each other\u2019s throats. They were in a wretched state going into the opening game in Milan and were fully expected to be hammered by the holders, who just so happened to be captained by the best player on the planet in Diego Maradona. Ultimately, however, neither he or anyone else in blue and white could pierce the wall of African defiance in front of them and were left stunned after Fran\u00e7ois Omam-Biyik\u2019s header squirted through the grasp of goalkeeper Nery Pumpido on 67 minutes. It would prove to be the winning goal and lives on as one of the most iconic, and vivid, moments in World Cup history.\n\n5) France o Senegal 1, Korea &amp; Japan 2002\nAnother opening game that saw a team from Africa kick things off in spectacular style. Appearing at their first World Cup, Senegal should have stood no chance against not only the holders but also reigning European champions. France were imperious and even without the injured Zinedine Zidane were expected to win with ease on a late May night in Seoul. But instead they were overwhelmed by positive, skilful and determined opponents largely made up of players from the middle-ranks of France\u2019s domestic leagues. Lens\u2019 El Hadji Diouf was Senegal\u2019s tormentor-in-chief and it was he would assist what would prove to be the winning goal, driving down the left-wing on 30 minutes and delivering a low cross that Papa Bouba Diop put past Fabian Barthez at the second attempt. \u201cWe have achieved something extraordinary,\u201d said Diouf afterwards. He was not wrong.\n\n6) Bulgaria 2 Germany 1, USA 1994\nUpsets in the group stages are one thing; upsets in the knockout stages, when the bigger and better teams should well and truly be in their stride, is another. That, in part, is what makes Bulgaria\u2019s victory over Germany in the quarter-finals of the 1994 tournament so legendary; it simply should not have happened, despite the fact Bulgaria had been performing well in the United States and contained a handful of highly talented players, no one more so than Hristo Stoichkov. Germany were the holders and this was the sharp end of proceedings; they were going to do what they so often do \u2013 win. Instead, however, they were stunned on a hot July afternoon in New Jersey as Bulgaria cancelled out a 47th-minute penalty from Lothar Matth\u00e4us via goals from Stoichkov and Yordan Letchkov, the latter remaining the greatest diving header by a balding player ever seen at a World Cup."

                    "body": "This World Cup is starting to feel a bit South Africa 2010. Australia\u2019s 4-1 humbling at the hands of France in Qatar on Wednesday stirs up a sentiment similarly portentous to that of 12 years ago, when Australia started their campaign with a 4-0 drubbing by Germany in Durban.\nThe team, under the tutelage of the late Pim Verbeek, recovered via a 1-1 draw with Ghana \u2013 despite Harry Kewell\u2019s early red card \u2013 and went on to beat Serbia 2-1. But the damage had been done in the first match. Too many goals had been shipped, and they finished third in their group on goal difference.\nThe Socceroos of today find themselves in a comparable position, and now face the daunting task of climbing back up the hill France tossed them down to stop history repeating itself.\n\n\u201cOf course now the stakes are higher for the second game,\u201d midfielder Jackson Irvine said the day after the opener. \u201cBut at the end of the day you know you\u2019re going to have to get two positive results to progress, and we\u2019ve still got full belief that that\u2019s achievable.\u201d\nGraham Arnold\u2019s side are in a marginally more promising position than the class of 2010, with one goal in their favour courtesy of that Craig Goodwin scorcher that had the country believing \u2013 for a beautiful 18 minutes \u2013 that an upset of the defending champions might be on the cards.\nWhat it means is they must beat Tunisia in their second match on Saturday and also pray that France score another hatful against Denmark, who were held to a 0-0 draw by the less-fancied Tunisia in their opening fixture. That would put Australia in a positive position going into next Wednesday\u2019s third and final match with Denmark.\n\nDraw with world No 30 Tunisia and the outlook is more difficult, with a win over Denmark the minimum requirement plus a hope other results fall their way. A loss would effectively spell the end of their Qatar 2022 campaign.\nIn short, the team have two days to prepare for the Tunisians, who they have not played since a 2-0 Confederations Cup loss in 2005. The North Africans will have a 12th man in a big and extremely vocal contingent of Tunisian fans largely made up of a 55,000-strong expat community in Qatar. It could make for a hostile atmosphere back at Al Janoub Stadium, where Australia are playing all three of their group fixtures.\n\nRight now, though, the priority for the players is moving on mentally from the gut-wrenching loss against what Arnold called a \u201cbigger, faster and stronger\u201d France. Irvine said it still felt \u201cquite raw\u201d, but the group had starting shifting focus to their next opponent.\n\u201cThe key is using last night as a platform to build into Saturday rather than overthinking how that game went,\u201d Irvine said. \u201cTactically there are lessons to be learned. We need to defend crosses better \u2013 to concede three goals from wide areas is a very clear lesson for us to learn.\n\n\u201cWhen we were on the front foot early in the game we looked a totally different kind of threat. Obviously you\u2019ve got to be aware of the individual quality of the opposition, especially when you\u2019re playing against players of that pace \u2013 you don\u2019t want to be leaving too much space in behind. But I think when we played on the front foot, when we pressed high, that was where we had our most joy.\u201d\nTunisia, led by captain Youssef Msakni, matched 10th-ranked Denmark in both attack and defence, creating chances and targeting Christian Eriksen. That performance will increase confidence the team can reach the knockout stage after five unsuccessful attempts.\n\u201cThis will obviously be a very different opposition; the game will flow in a totally different way,\u201d Irvine said. \u201cAgainst a team that can play so compact ... you are going to have to find different ways to create chances.\n\u201cWe have got the quality of players who can play in those areas out wide or in between lines and create chances to score goals. We will look at where are the best areas to hurt them but not much changes within the framework that we\u2019re always trying to do.\u201d\nThe key for Australia could be attacker Ajdin Hrustic, who has not played since 3 October because of an ankle injury and was unused against France, but could yet play a crucial role in this game.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a quality player, obviously we want him out on the pitch as soon as he is available,\u201d Irvine said. \u201cI am sure he will have a big role to play in these next couple of games.\u201d\n"

Moments after the restart, however, the goalkeeper sank to the turf and signalled to the bench that he needed to be substituted, with Hossein Hosseini belatedly replacing him.\n\nLuke Griggs, Headway\u2019s interim chief executive, was shocked by what he witnessed.

                    "body": "The Football Association\u2019s chief executive, Mark Bullingham, made some interesting comments in response to questions about Qatar 2022 in a parliamentary committee hearing last week. Notable among them was the claim that the migrant workers whom the FA had met during \u201cseveral trips\u201d to Qatar, as well as \u201cthe NGOs on the ground\u201d, were unanimous that \u201cthey want the World Cup to go ahead in Qatar\u201d. According to Bullingham, who said the FA would brief Gareth Southgate and his players on the situation before Saturday\u2019s match with Switzerland, the top request of workers and NGOs is that the FA \u201ckeep having regular visits there \u2026 shine a light on the country and help drive positive change\u201d.  The FA is right to visit and consult with the organisations the Qatari government allows to have a presence there, but a few meetings with a handful of migrant workers is hardly the basis for a prevalence claim. The week before Bullingham\u2019s comments, a coalition of NGOs, including the groups who have conducted the overwhelming majority of the independent research on migrant workers\u2019 rights in Qatar, provided a detailed briefing to the FA and painted a far less rosy picture. Human Rights Watch, for example, told of an ongoing case in which workers for a company with \u201cmultiple ongoing projects related to the Fifa World Cup Qatar 2022\u201d had not been paid for five months. FairSquare, who I represented at the meeting, and Amnesty International were also seriously concerned about the lack of progress on labour reforms. Southgate and his players\u2019 creditable stance on the issue of racial justice has led commentators such as Rod Liddle, Julia Hartley-Brewer and Tim Montgomerie to make accusations of hypocrisy over a failure to protest about human rights in Qatar. Thankfully, England\u2019s impressive group of young players either aren\u2019t aware or aren\u2019t bothered by such sneering and have expressed a willingness to take on the issue. \u201cOne of the incredible things that has come out of this group is that people try and make a difference all the time,\u201d Conor Coady has said. \u201cThat is constantly happening in this squad, people trying to use their platform to make a difference.\u201d The FA should be showing them the way. Here\u2019s how it can do that. There are a broad range of very serious problems in Qatar and multiple actors with different views on the reform process. Football associations and teams who want to make a difference should make simple calls on issues where there is no room for the type of debate that will leave them unsure of their footing. And there is one issue where none of the organisations working on this issue would disagree.  Qatar 2022 has led to tremendous harm and suffering for many migrant workers and families whose loved ones never returned. \u201cNow everything is shattered,\u201d the wife of a 34-year-old Nepalese man who died in Qatar from unspecified causes in 2020 told Amnesty International. She has been left to raise two young children alone. \u201cSince becoming a widow, I get 2,000 rupees [US$16] monthly from the [Nepali] government. Sometimes when I get a job, I go to work on roads, farm and drainage. It is the only way to meet the family\u2019s needs.\u201d There have been thousands of deaths of young men like this in Qatar since it won the right to host the World Cup, significantly more than half of them unexplained. No answer for families. No closure. No remedy for their loss.  Sign up to our new women\u2019s football newsletter  To that can be added millions of dollars of wage theft that have left workers and their families from some of the world\u2019s poorest countries indebted and destitute. A very large pile of newspaper articles and chunky reports are testament that all this happened in the course of the colossal construction programme Qatar had to push through to be ready for the World Cup. The football associations whose teams will participate in Qatar 2022 stand to make millions from doing so. That should jar with people\u2019s basic sense of justice when it is set in the context of such tragedy and loss. The FA can step up and show the way for other football associations by publicly supporting calls for compensation and remedy for migrant workers and their families.  This advice was relayed very clearly to the FA in our meeting. If Southgate and his players choose to add their support, that would lend significant momentum to calls that could transform many thousands of lives for the better.

While the Atlas Lions have continued to amaze on a deceptively serene route to the semis that has seen them concede just one goal, few seasoned football-watchers seem even remotely surprised to see Croatia still in the last four mix because \u2026 well, because they are Croatia.\nThe T-1000 of international teams, this ageing, streetwise bunch of fearless, dead-eyed footballing assassins never know when they\u2019re beaten. Having reached the last four of the tournament again, despite \u201cwinning\u201d just one game in Qatar, Croatia are currently on a run of four consecutive World Cup shootout wins. \u201cWe are raised as fighters, giving our best and that is the recipe for success,\u201d roared goalkeeper Dominik Livakovic after his side had come from behind to remove the spring from Neymar\u2019s samba step, sending him and his Brazilian teammates packing.\n\nThe unenviable job of trying to deposit Croatia into Fifa\u2019s Big Vat O\u2019 Molten Metal now falls to Argentina, a team who have also demonstrated no little doggedness of their own as they sh1thoused their way to these semis. But while their win over the Netherlands at times resembled nothing so much as a cartoon brawl with assorted fists, boots and yellow cards emerging from a big cloud of dust, manager Lionel Scaloni has explained they were only doing what was required to win and pointed out it actually takes two to perform that most Argentinian of dances, the tango. \u201cThe previous game was played, you know, the way we had to play it,\u201d he told reporters during his pre-match pow-wow. \u201cBut from both teams. And that\u2019s football. And sometimes, you know, things can happen like the previous game. There can be arguments, more challenging times. But that\u2019s all. That\u2019s why there is a referee, to make justice.\u201d\nOn the subject of the various Argentinian post-match moans about the particularly card-happy and fussy Spanish referee, Mateu Lahoz, who has since been sent to the airport by Fifa, Scaloni insisted his players were not the sore winners many think. \u201cThat\u2019s very far from who we actually are as a team, as a squad and as the way we represent our nation,\u201d he sighed, taking time out from supervising target practice that involved various players taking potshots at a dugout full of mannequins wearing tablecloths sourced from a nearby Italian restaurant. While a win for Argentina would perhaps serve as another step in Lionel Messi\u2019s journey towards cementing his status as the greatest player of all time (or just the second best in Argentinian history), in his opposite number Modric he faces a fellow legendary Ballon d\u2019Or-winning No 10 hoping to drive his team to HRWC glory. By close of play, however this one ends, only one of these diminutive legends will be left standing tall.\nLIVE ON BIG WEBSITE\nIt\u2019s time for the first semi-final! Join Scott Murray for live MBM updates from Argentina 1-1 Croatia (aet, 3-4 pens), kicking off at 7pm GMT.\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\n\u201cI am disappointed that there is continuing coverage of this matter (as well as some highly fictionalised versions of events) and extremely surprised that anyone on the staff would contribute to it. Coach [Gregg] Berhalter has always said issues that arise with the team will stay \u2018in house\u2019 so we can focus on team unity and progress\u201d \u2013 USA! USA!! USA!!! midfielder Gio Reyna hits back at reports most definitely out of the house that he was almost sent home from the HRWC for a perceived lack of effort against Wales. \u201cI am someone who plays with pride and passion,\u201d he added. \u201cI am also a very emotional person, and I fully acknowledge that I let my emotions get the best of me and affect my training and behaviour after learning about my limited role. Thereafter, I shook off my disappointment and gave everything I had on and off the field.\u201d\n\nFOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS\n\nI am writing to express my disappointment after reading Big Website\u2019s interview with the Mac Allister family. The reporter inexcusably failed to address the incident several years ago when the family went on holiday and Alexis\u2019s brother, Kevin, was accidentally left home alone and single-handedly fended off a pair of dimwitted burglars\u201d \u2013 Jonathan Jucker.\n\n\nEven the c0ckles of the coldest of hearts could not fail to have been warmed by the story of John Stones bringing home \u2018Dave\u2019 the stray cat from Qatar (yesterday\u2019s Football Daily). This is by no means a World Cup first \u2013 in 1962, Brazilian legend Garrincha came home from Chile with a rascally black dog who had not only invaded the pitch during Brazil\u2019s clash with England, but also left his calling card on our very own Jimmy Greaves\u201d \u2013 Allastair McGillivray.\n\n\nRe: Karl Baxter\u2019s surplus England World Cup winner T-shirts (yesterday\u2019s News, Bits and Bobs). While Football Daily may not be interested, I\u2019d suggest he could do a healthy trade in places like Aberystwyth, Kilmarnock, Strabane and Galway\u201d \u2013 Bryan Paisley.\n\n\nFootball isn\u2019t the only sport with a World Cup, and England must have won one in something this year. T20 cricket for a start, but probably also junior tiddlywinks or something as well. Just flog the footy merch to those fans and hope it doesn\u2019t mention Fifa anywhere\u201d \u2013 Robin Hazlehurst.\n\nSend your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.

USA!!! were still at it in their glorified friendly, The Fiv \u2026 bear with us, this is going to take some time \u2026 Football Daily breathed a sigh of relief. See, we\u2019ve got used to electronic advertising hoardings stripping one product at a time all the way down the touchline, so it\u2019d been nice at this Human Rights World Cup when the e-banners occasionally flicked round to display an ersatz version of yesteryear, a virtual row of lots of separate little ads in the old-fashioned style. Sure, the selection of modern McCosta companies wouldn\u2019t quite have the Azteca 1970 glamour of Cinzano, Kleenex, Bata shoes and Mothercare, but it would be better than nothing. Sadly, suddenly, for a couple of days back there, no more! So imagine how pleased we were to see the old-school corporate shilling suddenly appear again as the crucial Group B decider reached its last knockings. Hyundai, we hardly knew ye.\nFor the record, nothing much else happened on the pitch after that. Bata, though! Gotta love Jonathan Meades.\nMeanwhile at Ahmad bin Ali Stadium in Al Rayyan, Wales went gentle into that good night. Did Dylan Thomas drink 387,489 pints of whisky for nothing?! Though Gareth Bale at his end secretly knew dark was right, the match with England was the first time British teams had met at a World Cup finals, so it was beholden to him, Aaron Ramsey and Joe Allen (collective age in legs 873 (145 \u00bd years per leg)) to give it a go. Ah well, curse, bless them now with your fierce tears. And what a blessing: Bale is off to play a lot of golf, Allen to look after a lot of chickens, and Ramsey to spend the rest of his life receiving a lot of thanks from Celtic supporters. Meanwhile England, even if they beat Senegal, will have to deal with Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 or possibly even Lionel Messi. Sing the sun in flight!\n\nAll of which leaves Football Daily to ponder Wednesday\u2019s upcoming matches, and consider how we\u2019ve not yet come to terms with the loss of our This Morning and Bargain Hunt-bothering 10am and 1pm kick-offs. Football Daily is still in a state of mourning, but even in this reduced state we can feel a frisson of excitement at the possibility of Messi being toe-punted out of the tournament for the last time by all-new World Cup scoring sensation Robert Lewandowski, 34, or Australia making it through to the last 16 for only the second flamin\u2019 time in their history by holding off Denmark. Good luck and all to the Socceroos, though should they secure their draw, only for Tunisia to do a number on France B and nip in ahead, Football Daily begs all Aussies permission to guffaw long and loud. See, we\u2019d have to take our kicks when we can get them, before next summer\u2019s Ashes pans out like everyone imagines it will.\nLIVE ON BIG WEBSITE!\nJoin Scott Murray from 3pm GMT for MBM coverage of Australia 1-2 Denmark, while Will Unwin will be on deck for Tunisia 1-2 France at the same time.

You have a different perspective to me. Why don\u2019t you write down that it\u2019s terribly boring. If you think it\u2019s boring why don\u2019t you go home \u2026 I don\u2019t agree with you; I think everyone would be rather proud we\u2019re progressing to the next round and I think people know why you\u2019re asking these questions. I don\u2019t think things are as bad as you say\u201d \u2013 Louis van Gaal decides to expand after all, bristling in response to a reporter who queried the entertainment value provided by his Netherlands team, after they beat dismal HR World Cup hosts Qatar 2-0 to top their group and set up a meeting with the USA! USA!! USA!!!\n\nFOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS\n\u201cHaving just watched the Qatari national side eliminated after three consecutive Sunday pub team performances at a tournament facilitated by abused migrant workers, and in grounds which emptied long before full-time, I was thinking: presumably Qatar acquired this tournament in the hope of showing the world what the country is all about. Job done, eh?\u201d \u2013 Chris Jersan.\n\u201cThe match ball seems to be a very subtle but at the same time also very prominently featured sign of protest at this year\u2019s HRWC.

                    "body": "In a tent amid Doha\u2019s university campus the player to take lessons from was sitting to Cody Gakpo\u2019s right. Daley Blind knows the value of a searing World Cup debut: he was 24 when the Netherlands beat Spain 5-1 in a modern classic eight years ago and the first of his two assists was for Robin van Persie\u2019s extraordinary body-flipping header. \u201cIt was a great game, maybe that game changed my life,\u201d Blind said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see about that for everyone who is in the tournament.\u201d\nThat outcome already seems nailed on for Gakpo. His teammate had been asked to make a comparison with the winger\u2019s outstanding first week at Qatar 2022, which has brought two goals and directly earned a stuttering side four points. It is hardly a secret Gakpo is destined for higher echelons than those inhabited by PSV Eindhoven but football\u2019s month-long showpiece remains the most significant validator to global eyes. He has blazed on to the scene and the Netherlands\u2019 prospects may, to a large extent, depend on him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised,\u201d Gakpo said when it was suggested a start this quick may not have been anticipated. \u201cI know what I\u2019m capable of but it\u2019s always a challenge to reach your highest level. I\u2019m not there yet, I think I can improve in a lot of things.\u201d But his contributions so far have been those of an all-rounder. A well-timed run and header, using his nose for goal and rangy frame to beat \u00c9douard Mendy to the ball, breached Senegal when the Oranje were toiling. Then there was the left-foot finish, so truly struck, that seemed to have built the foundations for victory over Ecuador and screamed of a talent announcing itself beyond doubt.\nIf not screams, the suggestions Manchester United will finalise a long-term courtship when the transfer window opens in January have amounted to loud whispers. \u201cI\u2019m focused on the World Cup but it\u2019s always nice to hear such rumours,\u201d Gakpo said, not exactly swatting them away. \u201cAs it stands now, I will still be playing for PSV after the winter break. But as I said before the start of the World Cup, we will see what happens.\u201d\n\nHe stressed more than once that the Netherlands team needs to come first. There is certainly work to do on the collective. It struck a chord when, requested to list those areas on which he can brush up, he landed straight upon a need to \u201chelp the team more in ball possession, to keep it so that the team can move forward\u201d. Louis van Gaal\u2019s major bugbear so far is that, with the ball, the Netherlands have been nowhere near the level he seeks. They barely created a chance against Ecuador after Gakpo\u2019s early rocket and were duly punished, although the draw should not complicate their hopes of progress given Qatar are up next on Tuesday.\n\nPositional work was the focus of the closed training session that followed the audience with the two players. Gakpo may be deceptively quick, deft of touch, over 6ft and involved across 34 goals in club and international football this season but he cannot do it all himself. He has been used in two roles already since the competition began, behind the strikers against Senegal and up front when facing Ecuador; a player who usually operates on the left for PSV has demonstrated his versatility and Van Gaal\u2019s task may be to find a deployment that brings out the best in everybody.\n\u201cHe is trying to challenge me to become a better player,\u201d Gakpo said of his manager, who advised him to eschew the Premier League\u2019s bright lights last summer. Gakpo was heavily linked with Leeds and Southampton but would surely be priced far beyond those clubs now. Blind laughed when asked whether Van Gaal still had the same gravitas among players as in 2014 when, during the second of three spells in charge, he pitched him in to torment Spain. \u201cLouis is always Louis; what you see is what you get,\u201d came the response.\n\nIt is having the right effect on Gakpo. Behind the 23-year-old\u2019s modesty and focus on the unit is the confidence that has fuelled scores of his national team predecessors. They may need it: a potentially revitalised Argentina would be their opponents in the quarter-finals if a hitherto wild tournament reverted to type from here. \u201cOur goal is to be world champions \u2013 that is the thing we are trying to reach,\u201d Gakpo said. Nothing in this sport could be more life-changing than that."

                    "body": "Goalkeepers Mat Ryan, FC Copenhagen: Moved to Denmark in search for more game time, but lost the battle for the No 1 shirt to Kamil Grabara upon the latter\u2019s return from injury and has only started one game in the past month. Was recently scrapped for a fixture because of \u201cknee problems\u201d but Socceroos coach Arnold is confident in his fitness. Andrew Redmayne, Sydney FC: The \u201cGrey Wiggle\u201d has started every game for the Harboursiders this season and looked solid in the weekend\u2019s Sydney derby defeat until he was beaten with 20 minutes to go.  Danny Vukovic\u0301, Central Coast Mariners: Heads to Qatar having conceded three goals in his final ALM outing before the tournament begins, including a howler for Macarthur\u2019s opener and Jed Drew\u2019s injury-time winner for the Bulls.  Defenders Kye Rowles, Hearts: Instantly slotted in as a starter upon his move to the Scottish side, only for a broken foot suffered on 28 August to put his World Cup in jeopardy. He returned off the bench last week and appears injury free although his smooth transition back to football was blighted by a red card in the draw with Livingston at the weekend.  Milo\u0161 Degenek, Columbus Crew: One of the Socceroos\u2019 most experienced campaigners and unheralded for his versatility, Degenek moved to Columbus in the MLS this season and ended up playing over 2,000 minutes as a centre-back. The American league broke a month ago, but he says he is in \u201cpeak shape\u201d. Harry Souttar, Stoke City: Tore his ACL while playing for the Socceroos in a wet World Cup qualifier against Saudi Arabia last November, but has made progress to the point where Arnold is comfortable in picking him. Began his rehab with Stoke\u2019s Under-23s and marked his return to senior football against Luton Town last week. Thomas Deng, Albirex Niigata: After a torrid time with injury, the versatile Deng found form and fitness at the back end of the J2 League season as Albirex Niigata secured promotion \u2013 their last game was played on 23 October. Bailey Wright, Sunderland: After being rarely started at the start of Sunderland\u2019s season, Wright has found minutes at the right time, starting their last four league games and even wearing the captain\u2019s armband against Cardiff. Aziz Behich, Dundee United: Moved to Tannadice Park from Turkey this off-season and is seeing consistent minutes at left-back and on the left wing. The Tangerines, however, sit bottom of the Scottish Premiership with a goal difference of -14. Joel King, Odense BK: After a promising start to life in Denmark after moving over in the January transfer window, King has fallen out of favour at Odense BK and has not started a league game since August. He was an unused substitute in the weekend\u2019s game against Horsens. Nathaniel Atkinson, Hearts: An injured ankle put the right-back\u2019s World Cup hopes in jeopardy but he returned to action with a goal in the Europa League and is now set to become the first Tasmanian to play in the World Cup. Was an unused substitute at the weekend. Fran Kara\u010di\u0107, Brescia: Has battled injuries during the season but, when fit, has been a regular starter for Serie B side Brescia. Started at right-back in his club\u2019s recent draws with Genoa and Ascoli, but was absent from the matchday squad for this weekend\u2019s game against Ternana. Midfielders:  Keanu Baccus, St Mirren: Another member of the squad whose selection has been built off the back of a move to Scotland, Baccus has played 94% of available minutes in Paisley this season before coming on as a substitute in the draw with Rangers on Saturday.  Jackson Irvine, St. Pauli: Seeing minutes and in good form at club level, Irvine plays week in and week out in midfield for German second-division side St. Pauli. Has also worn the armband for Die Kiezkicker this season. Cammy Devlin, Hearts: The terrier-like Devlin has come on in leaps and bounds for Hearts this season and started in league, cup, and continental competition this season, most recently in the weekend\u2019s draw with Livingston that featured that red card for teammate Rowles. Riley McGree, Middlesbrough: Departs for Qatar with another high-quality goal to his name after scoring a beauty for Boro against Norwich City on Sunday. Has played over 1,000 minutes this season as a central midfielder, attacker and, most recently, left winger.  Ajdin Hrustic\u0301, Hellas Verona: The Socceroos\u2019 best player returned to the bench at the weekend after the 26-year-old gave Arnold an almighty scare when he suffered an ankle injury while playing against AC Milan. He did not take to the field in Verona\u2019s defeat to Spezia but Arnold is confident of his fitness before the opener against France. Aaron Mooy, Celtic: After escaping his contract with Shanghai Port and China\u2019s fierce Covid lockdowns, Mooy signed for Ange Postecoglou and Celtic this season, where he has seen consistent minutes off the bench with intermittent starts, although he did not feature on Sunday. Forwards Martin Boyle, Hibernian: Yet another member of the squad who has been in a race against time to recover from an injury, Boyle was in strong form for Hibernian this season only for his World Cup to get thrown into doubt by an injury suffered against St Mirren on October 29. Hasn\u2019t played since and will likely be in pain in Qatar, but is still able to feature. Garang Kuol, Central Coast Mariners: Signed off in style, scoring twice in the Mariners\u2019 defeat to Macarthur \u2013 one a penalty and the other an outrageous finish from a tight angle after bringing down a cross with some excellent control. Is still yet to start a single professional league fixture, but poses a real threat as an impact player off the bench.  Jason Cummings, Central Coast Mariners: One of ALM\u2019s most in-form players this season, Cummings has a goal and three assists in five games this season for the Mariners, as well as a number of goals disallowed. Mat Leckie, Melbourne Leckie: Has been one of the form players in the defending premiers\u2019 strong start to this ALM campaign, playing on both the wing and as a 10 in his side\u2019s undefeated start to the season. Was named man-of-the match in the weekend\u2019s win over Newcastle. Mitch Duke, Fagiano Okayama: Played 70% of available match minutes in the Japanese second tier this season, scoring eight goals and grabbing three assists in 37 games. His season ended on 30 October with a 3-0 defeat to Montedio Yamagata in a J1 League qualification playoff. Awer Mabil, C\u00e1diz CF: After a few early starts, has been pushed largely to the periphery of La Liga side C\u00e1diz, but he did start the Copa Del Rey match against Real Union on Sunday, playing 77 minutes before being withdrawn.  Craig Goodwin, Adelaide United: After recovering from a pelvic injury during the off-season, Goodwin has found form and fitness at just the right time for Adelaide. He scored from the penalty spot and provided an assist in Friday\u2019s 3-0 win over Melbourne Victory. Jamie Maclaren, Melbourne City: Continues to score goals, goals and more goals for Melbourne City. He netted the winner early in City\u2019s win over Newcastle, continuing his run of scoring in every game so far this season."

                    "body": "The Football Association\u2019s chief executive, Mark Bullingham, has spoken of his \u201cdelight\u201d at Gareth Southgate\u2019s decision to continue as England\u2019s manager and lead the team into qualifying for Euro 2024. After a week of soul-searching that followed the heartbreak of England\u2019s 2-1 defeat by France in the World Cup quarter-final, Southgate has concluded there is no reason to quit before his contract ends in December 2024.  The 52-year-old had come into the tournament under heavy pressure, prompting him to consider his position, but the broadly positive reaction to the France game has convinced him to continue his tenure. Southgate\u2019s decision is a major boost for the FA, which did not want to lose him \u2013 not least because potential successors are thin on the ground. England begin their European Championship qualifying campaign with a trip to Italy on 23 March and a home game against Ukraine three days later. The prospect of trying to replace Southgate in such a short space of time did not appeal. With the leading English candidates \u2013 Newcastle\u2019s Eddie Howe and Chelsea\u2019s Graham Potter \u2013 unavailable, the FA could have been forced into approaching a foreign manager, such as Thomas Tuchel or Mauricio Pochettino. \u201cWe are delighted to confirm that Gareth Southgate is continuing as England manager, and will lead our Euro 2024 campaign,\u201d Bullingham said. \u201cGareth and [assistant] Steve Holland have always had our full support, and our planning for the Euros starts now.\u201d The FA has given Southgate, who has been in charge for six years, space to make up his mind. A chief consideration for the former Middlesbrough manager was whether he had the energy to take the team into another tournament. Southgate has endured a difficult period since England\u2019s defeat by Italy in the Euro 2020 final. He was bruised by the public backlash during and after England\u2019s demoralising Nations League campaign, particularly when he was jeered by supporters after the 4-0 defeat against Hungary at Molineux in June. That result, England\u2019s worst home loss since 1928, appeared to confirm that the team had grown stale. England were subsequently relegated from the top tier of the Nations League and Southgate received more abuse after the 1-0 defeat by Italy in Milan in September. However Bullingham has been unflinching in his support. England flew to Qatar hopeful of securing their first major men\u2019s trophy since 1966 and their performances were strong. Southgate sent England out to attack in a positive 4-3-3, they finished top of their group and were hugely unfortunate to lose to France. It could have been different if Harry Kane, who equalised with one penalty, had not missed from the spot when he had the chance to make it 2-2 in the dying stages. England, who dominated much of the game, could also feel aggrieved a foul on Bukayo Saka was not awarded during the buildup to the first France goal. Ultimately England lost on small details \u2013 Southgate will look at the tactical problems France caused during the first 20 minutes and the poor defending that led to Olivier Giroud heading the winner from Antoine Griezmann\u2019s cross.  Yet there was no major criticism of Southgate after the final whistle. Some of his substitutions were called into question but mostly there was recognition that England played good football. Southgate, who retains the full support of the squad\u2019s senior players, has been able to gain a better perspective after talking with family and friends after flying home from Qatar. He had acknowledged after the France game that it would be difficult to walk away from young talents such as Jude Bellingham, Declan Rice, Phil Foden, Reece James, Mason Mount and Saka. The challenge for Southgate will be lifting Kane after his penalty miss and ensuring that England, whose qualifying group also includes Malta and North Macedonia, continue to make progress. He has taken them to the semi\u2011finals and quarter-finals of a World Cup, plus the men\u2019s first major final in 55 years. He has another opportunity to prove that he is capable of beating the best teams and leading England to a trophy."

And every night when he returned to his labour camp, he would get out his phone and make TikTok videos for his 60,000 followers. Most of his videos are songs and poems about love, romance and the trials of life, but among them are stories of the hardships he faced in Qatar. \u201cI wanted to show that foreign land is the land of trouble \u2026 Nepal is always better for us,\u201d says Sahani, who is now back in his home country.   Images from Bisho Sahani\u2019s TikTok account, where he posts videos about his life in Qatar. Photos: Bisho Sahani  The men who have built Qatar\u2019s World Cup, and those helping to deliver it, are often defined by little more than the pale blue boilersuits that signal their status as low-wage labourers. But even in Qatar, their lives are complex and varied. They are workers, but they are also social media stars, activists, fathers and fashionistas. About 95% of Qatar\u2019s working population come from overseas. Some are middle- and high-income earners, but the vast majority are low-wage workers. With a population in Qatar of about 400,000, Nepalis make up the second-largest nationality in the country (tied with Bangladesh, but behind the 700,000 Indian expats). They feature prominently in an Instagram account that offers a rare insight into the lives behind the uniforms and construction gear. DohaFashionFridays documents the many and varied fashion styles of migrant workers as they stroll along the Corniche, the sweeping promenade in the heart of Doha, on their weekly day off. \u201cNepalis are very stylish \u2026 they are always on point when it comes to hair and tattoos,\u201d says Khalid Albaih, a political cartoonist who founded the project in 2016.   Francis Grey, from Lagos, who is a chef in a Doha restaurant. \u2018I love H&amp;M. I don\u2019t do Zara because it\u2019s way overpriced. When I was young I liked being noticed, and fashion gave me that\u2019  Khalid says the idea for the project was to put a human face to the statistics. \u201cLet\u2019s meet these people, let\u2019s see what they think. It\u2019s not about victimising. It\u2019s about them showing off themselves the way they want to be [shown] off,\u201d he says. Many Nepalis in Qatar find a sense of belonging in the communities they were part of at home. There are more than 140 Nepali social organisations in the country, says Rajan*, who is on the committee of six of them. Some are organised around the districts workers come from, others are based on ethnic groups or political affiliations. \u201cWhatever is there in Nepal, is here also,\u201d says Rajan.  Trade unions are prohibited in Qatar, but Rajan heads up an unofficial group of activists who help out fellow migrant workers in need. \u201cIf anyone is suffering, we give them advice or accompany them to the embassy or labour court,\u201d he says. These days, Rajan is in need of help himself. He has not been paid for eight months. His company works for one of Qatar\u2019s largest construction firms, but the cashflow has dried up. He has repeatedly asked his company\u2019s management for his salary, only to be told: \u201cWhen we are paid, we will pay you.\u201d     Clockwise from top: Friends RZ Saiful and MD Shafin Ahmed Shubo, from Bangladesh; Kennedy and Louise, from Kenya; Roommates Teresa and Sherryl, from Kenya, who work for a cleaning company  Suresh set out for Qatar in 2007 to work as a construction labourer. Fifteen years later, he is doing the same job. \u201cI don\u2019t have any big dreams that I will be in a better position. My only duty is to support my family,\u201d says the 50-year-old Nepali. He has little free time, getting up at 4am each day to start work. But there is a twice-daily ritual he never skips; making a phone call to his wife, three daughters and two-year-old son. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be here because I miss my family, but if I don\u2019t work, there is no one to support them. I\u2019m not here willingly. I\u2019m compelled to be here,\u201d he says.   One of *Mansor\u2019s jobs is to sell karak tea on the Corniche in Doha. He wears different coloured rings on his fingers as a style statement  Low-wage labourers, like Suresh, are not allowed to bring their families to Qatar, and so hundreds of thousands of men live with enforced celibacy. They are often called \u201cbachelors\u201d but, in many cases, they are young married men who miss their wives. If his children are not at home, he gets to be, \u201ca little personal\u201d with his wife. \u201cThis way we control our emotions for a few hours,\u201d says Suresh, before adding, \u201cit\u2019s a tragedy.\u201d      Shirts and shoes: migrant workers show off their favourite styles on the Corniche in Doha  Some of the most nuanced portrayals of migrant workers come from those closest to the story. The Nepali Times runs a series, Diaspora Diaries, which reveals the diversity of destinations, jobs, motivations and experiences of Nepal\u2019s migrant workers. \u201cWe hope to bring out the human side of migration, and how it has touched almost every Nepali family in both positive and negative ways,\u201d says the paper\u2019s editor, Kunda Dixit. \u201cWe also want to show that it is not always about exploitation and abuse, but Nepalis\u2019 aspirations for themselves and their families. Even the most horrifying stories of suffering and pain show people with hope, inner strength and selflessness.\u201d   Bangladeshi men pose on the Corniche in Doha.

                    "body": "Child\u2019s play? Anything but. England had toyed with Hungary amid the most unpleasant circumstances in September and might have expected a repeat in front of more than 30,000 energised youngsters. But a highly unusual setting brought what, by recent standards, was a thoroughly singular outcome: a no-show from Gareth Southgate\u2019s players and a ripple in what had been a largely smooth path to Qatar. England went through the motions, as players facing four games in the immediate aftermath of an unforgiving domestic season might. Their opponents strained harder across all departments.  In the matchday programme, the section dedicated to Hungary\u2019s visitors was adorned with mini profiles of English national treasures. The list may not have constituted a fantasy dinner party lineup but contained something for everyone: Michael Owen; Sir Alf Ramsey; Howard Webb; the Queen; the singer Alfie Templeman; fish and chips. At full time it was tempting to suggest their boys had taken one hell of a beating, if not a battering, although the latter might have been close if Andras Schafer had doubled the margin of victory with a sitter. England had never played to such a shrill, youthful and multicoloured backdrop. A more familiar sight at Hungary\u2019s home games is the black-clad mass of ultras behind the goal, named the Carpathian Brigade, whose misdemeanours during Euro 2020 brought this game\u2019s staging under special measures. This time pockets of minors wearing lime green, yellow, blue, whatever stripe represented their school or club, occupied those spots along with their accompanying adults. Any sense of menace was dialled down close to zero, the scenes outside resembling arrangements for a summer camp rather than a fixture with unsavoury recent history. Yet there was still a grim reminder that a society\u2019s sicknesses are all too easily transmissible to its young: England were booed when taking the knee and that reaction, on its own, should intensify questions around the logic of staging a behind-closed-doors fixture that was nothing of the sort. A lone England flag flew briefly, for some reason, in the lower tier: beneath the gauze that, covering a section of seating, read \u201cHatred is not in the field of play\u201d in Hungarian. But the away side were otherwise alone and that need not have been too vexing. They are five months from a World Cup to which traditional supporters may not flock, in a country with little football culture of its own. Nobody knows how the atmosphere will feel in Qatar but this, enthusiastic yet vaguely distracted and powered by screeching vuvuzelas, felt analogous at times to the one-note buzz of a tournament group stage game. That changed whenever Hungary burst into life, which turned out to happen regularly. The assembled children could, the local FA president Sandor Csanyi had suggested, take learnings for life from the role models on the field. Everyone present felt educated, though, when the wing-back Loic Nego volleyed an angled pass of improbable ingenuity from which Dominik Szoboszlai almost scored. In moments like that the roof of this half-full arena almost lifted; the octave pitch would have left the scale had Adam Szalai beaten Jordan Pickford from inside the centre circle rather than shoot a foot wide. By contrast England were slow, ponderous, never quite disastrous but rarely capable of operating beyond the methodical. James Justin, who departed at half-time, was given numerous headaches on his senior bow by Nego, a 31-year-old who plays for the local league\u2019s fourth-placed side Fehervar. It was his replacement, Bukayo Saka, who produced England\u2019s brightest moment after a scorching run and saved effort that nobody in white came close to emulating; leaden and too readily exposed, they never looked close to turning the screw. There had been more attention placed on Jarrod Bowen, who had come off a pin-sharp season with West Ham. Bowen did as he usually does: refusing to go missing during an individual or collective off-day, a trait that endears him to managers and can compensate for the fact his technical qualities rarely soar above the mean. Volleyed half-chances at either end of the game highlighted that propensity; as Southgate pointed out afterwards, by the close he had taken most of the side\u2019s shots. In truth it was thin gruel; for all their debutant\u2019s willingness, England never got started.  They had nobody with the grace and craft to match Szoboszlai, whose penalty came after a Reece James blunder that typified their afternoon. Szoboszlai is Hungary\u2019s modern success story: a sublime talent who came through the relatively modest Fonix Gold academy before shuttling through the Red Bull machine to Bundesliga stardom. He is still only 21: if the budding footballers who roared him off the pitch took one example from their evening out, his would be a fine place to start. For England, the lessons are rather sterner."

                    "body": "\nThe main event\nAfter all that noise \u2013 the joy, the triumphalism, the entitlement, the schadenfreude, the self-loathing \u2013 England had the best record of any team in the group stage at Qatar 2022. It shows how far they have come under Gareth Southgate that seven points and nine goals, the latter a record for England at a major tournament, was not enough to please Twitter\u2019s finest.\nEven in the hysterical world of the England national team, it\u2019s hard to remember the last time that the balance between on-field achievement and off-field angst was so far out of whack, and that is unlikely to change unless England win handsomely against Senegal tonight. After a semi-final in 2018 and a final last year, the louder elements of the media, traditional and social, have come to a near unanimous conclusion: Southgate is holding England back.\nThe received wisdom is that England have an embarrassment of riches in attacking areas. Fine players though they are, we might be confusing the excellence of the Premier League with that of the national team. Since England became good again in 2018, a total of 10,158 voting points have been available at the Ballon d\u2019Or. (Bear with us, this isn\u2019t as boring as it sounds.) Premier League players picked up 3,431 of them, or 33.78%. But English players received only 86, or 0.85%. That\u2019s less than Eden Hazard, and he has barely played in the last three years. For all his imperfections, most obviously his indecisive in-game management, Southgate has significantly overachieved with a squad that is not as talented as the \u201cgolden generation\u201d of the mid-2000s.\nSenegal, who they face tonight, have been filed under \u201cawkward opponent but one England should beat\u201d. England have never lost to an African team, a statistic that has been cited frequently in the buildup. Despite 30 years of watching players as stylistically diverse as Nwankwo Kanu, Mo Salah, Sadio Mane, Jay-Jay Okocha and Yaya Tour\u00e9 in the Premier League, there is a perceived homogeneity to African football that doesn\u2019t reflect well on English football\u2019s subconscious.\nFrance are also in action today, taking on a Poland side who qualified for the last 16 with their tail between their legs. It should be a joyous occasion, Poland\u2019s first knockout game at the World Cup since a closer-than-it-sounds 4-0 defeat by Brazil in 1986, but their pitiful performance against Argentina \u2013 no shots on target, no ambition, but only one yellow card \u2013 has changed the mood. It depends on what happens against France, but when the story of Poland\u2019s 2022 campaign is written, historians may conclude that it would have been better to go out with a bang than through with a whimper.\nEngland have no such choice. Unless they go through with a bang against Senegal, the knives \u2013 and the hashtags \u2013 will probably be out. RS\nTalking points\nNetherlands ease into last eightSince Louis van Gaal took charge the Netherlands are unbeaten in 19 matches. In yesterday\u2019s ruthless 3-1 dismissal of the USA they appeared to be a team playing within themselves, still with plenty of room for improvement in their quarter-final against Argentina \u2013 and perhaps beyond. There was a smidgen of defensive vulnerability to be seen when the USA fought back to 2-1 in the second half, but that recovery was swiftly squashed by a third Dutch goal, scored by the exceptional Denzel Dumfries. If nothing else, neutrals should hope the Netherlands stay in the tournament for the mental stimulation being offered by Van Gaal. Every time he speaks it seems to be something amusing, insightful or both. \u201cYesterday I gave him a big, fat kiss,\u201d Van Gaal said of Dumfries, who was sitting beside him in the press conference. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to give him another big, fat kiss.\u201d As always, he meant what he said. LMc\nA moment to forget for Australia\u2019s RyanThe manner of Australia\u2019s exit was particularly painful for the goalkeeper Mathew Ryan after his blunder handed Argentina their second goal, slotted in by Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez. Kye Rowles\u2019 back pass wasn\u2019t ideal, and hindsight is always a wonderful thing, but the effectiveness and urgency of Argentina\u2019s pressing at that moment meant the Socceroos goalkeeper would have been wise to put his foot through the ball and aim for Row Z. Instead Ryan lost it and \u00c1lvarez did the rest. The margins would have been tight regardless but when they were chasing the game, Australia showed the vulnerability that clearly exists at the heart of Argentina\u2019s defence. They will wonder what might have been but Ryan, and the Socceroos collectively, can be proud of how they performed in Qatar. LMc\n\nBeyond the football\nWith drama aplenty in the group stage, stories in the global media have largely focused on the thrilling football \u2013 exactly as Qatar\u2019s Supreme Committee and Fifa want it. Sean Ingle reports that the country is so happy with how the tournament has gone that it can be a springboard to hosting the biggest sporting event of all, the Olympic Games. The Guardian understands the country is ready to flex its muscles again and bid to stage the Games in the autumn of 2036, despite having failed with bids three times in the past. Ingle reports there is \u201cgrowing optimism in Doha\u201d that this World Cup will prove they can host the Olympics. But there will be obstacles, from LGBTQ+ rights to commercial concerns from the IOC after Qatar\u2019s 11th-hour alcohol ban at stadiums. GB\nGlobal media-watch\nThere was disappointment in the US after the national team were brushed aside by the Netherlands. \u201cThe subpar play from practically the entire team counts as a major disappointment,\u201d wrote Jeff Carlisle for ESPN. In the Washington Post, Steven Goff wrote: \u201cThe US men\u2019s team had reached the knockout stage with a blend of defensive excellence, precocious poise and unflinching confidence \u2013 but these things were missing [on] Saturday.\u201d\n\nIn Australia, journalists digesting the Socceroos\u2019 early-morning exit were more sanguine. \u201cOne piece of genius from the greatest player of all time, and a rare mistake from one of Australia\u2019s most loyal servants. In a sport defined by razor-thin margins, sometimes, that\u2019s just the way it goes,\u201d accepted Vince Rugari in the Sydney Morning Herald. The Guardian\u2019s own Emma Kemp wrote: \u201cThis was not a bad performance. It was a very good performance with all the makings of another upset; the moving mass of blue-and-white tension in the stands confirmed it to be so.\u201d\nMeanwhile in South Korea, the official World Cup anthem Dreamers, featuring Jungkook of BTS fame, is getting plenty of airtime as they savour a place in the Round of 16 following the dramatic late win against Portugal. Not a patch on Shakira\u2019s 2010 World Cup banger, Waka Waka (This Time for Africa), but admittedly that\u2019s a high bar. LMc/NMc\nThe internet reacts\nNo social media post was more gratefully received by the world of football than the one posted by Pel\u00e9 on Instagram. After a day of reports that the Brazil legend was receiving end-of-life care, Pel\u00e9 shared a positive update from his hospital, adding that he felt \u201cstrong\u201d and \u201cwith a lot of hope\u201d. The 82-year-old, still the only player to win three World Cups in his career, will continue treatment, and we wish him well. NMc\n\nElsewhere, plenty of people enjoyed Luis Su\u00e1rez bawling his eyes out after Uruguay were dumped out of the World Cup. The former Liverpool forward sat on the bench for the final 24 minutes (plus an age of injury time) after being replaced by Edinson Cavani. He went through most of the emotions available to humanity; happiness, fear and eventually just tears, partially hidden behind his light blue shirt. Patrice Evra later liked an Instagram post of Su\u00e1rez looking like his mother had just thrown a beloved teddy bear into a skip. It is not the first time Su\u00e1rez has cut onions after a football match, allowing for a clever ranking system. WU\n\nToday\u2019s matches\nFrance v Poland (Round of 16, 3pm GMT, BBC1)\u201cThey [Poland] have a hardcore of players with good experience,\u201d Didier Deschamps said in his pre-match press conference. \u201cThere is [Wojciech] Szczesny, [Kamil] Glik, [Robert] Lewandowski and you have to respect what this team does, they deserve to be there. Szczesny was decisive.\u201d The France head coach knows their last-16 opponents have enough quality to cause an upset \u2013 and some \u201chardcore\u201d individuals with enough experience to rile France. Szczesny has been in fine form in Qatar, while Lewandowski has broken his World Cup duck and will be confident of causing problems for the French centre-backs. France\u2019s second string were appalling against Tunisia, a sign they Deschamps does not have much in reserve. If Poland can keep it tight until deep into the game, they will hope to crank up the pressure on the reigning champions. WU\n\nEngland v Senegal (Round of 16, 7pm GMT, ITV1)Senegal are missing a number of key players \u2013 and potentially their head coach Aliou Ciss\u00e9 due to illness \u2013 for this most vital of games. Sadio Man\u00e9, Cheikhou Kouyat\u00e9 and Idrissa Gueye are all missing through a mixture of injury and suspension. Not only are they quality players but possess incredible experience, which will be sorely missed. Their replacements face a tough job to defeat an England team in good form. Sheffield United\u2019s Iliman Ndiaye has already been given a chance in Man\u00e9\u2019s absence and impressed in the victory over Ecuador. Nampalys Mendy of Leicester City is another who has knowledge of the opponents thanks to his Premier League employers. Although not a regular for club or country, he has the skills to irritate England\u2019s midfielders, while Chelsea\u2019s Kalidou Koulibaly will be solid behind him. It might not be the optimum Senegal team but there is enough to cause problems to England, who need to avoid complacency. WU\n\nPlayer to watch\nIliman Ndiaye When England take on Senegal, they ought to watch out for the lad from Bramall Lane. A non-league youth player with Boreham Wood three years ago, Ndiaye has come a long way since signing for Sheffield United in 2019. An unused substitute against the Netherlands, he made a second-half cameo against Qatar and, 10 minutes after coming on, danced through three attempted tackles before laying on an assist for Bamba Dieng. Having started the win against Ecuador and produced a lively performance, the 22-year-old has grown in stature as the tournament has gone on. Even if Aliou Ciss\u00e9 decides to use him from the bench, he could be a threat. WM\nAnd finally\nJapan\u2019s success in topping Group E ahead of Spain and Germany has surprised their next opponents as much as anyone. \u201cWe did not expect this,\u201d said the Croatia midfielder Lovro Majer before the last-16 meeting on Monday evening. \u201cI think hardly anyone expected that, but hats off to Japan. They showed that it is not names that are playing, but what is more important is heart and courage.\u201d Japan defeated Germany despite having 29% possession, while they overcame Spain with just 22%. \u201cPossession means nothing in football today,\u201d said Josip Juranovic, the Croatia right-back, when those stats were put to him. \u201cThey play very well as a team and they are fast. But we showed against Canada we can deal with quick teams.\u201d WM"

                    "body": "Inflation has come for the football sticker album. Collecting and completing the official Panini Fifa World Cup Qatar 2022 album will cost fans an average of about \u00a3870. Panini, which first produced a World Cup sticker album for the 1970 tournament in Mexico, has priced five-sticker packs for the Qatar 2022 album at 90p each. That is a 12.5% increase on the 80p cost of a five-sticker pack for the Russia 2018 album. For Euro 2016 a pack cost 50p. There are a total of 670 Qatar 2022 stickers, which first went on sale last Thursday, to collect. However, because of duplicates, fans would \u2013 on average \u2013 need to buy 4,832 stickers to complete the album, according to calculations by Paul Harper, a mathematics professor at Cardiff University. At 18p a sticker that works out at \u00a3870. The total average cost has increased from \u00a3770 in 2018 (when there were more stickers in the album). Harper said if fans were \u201cextremely lucky and never had a duplicate\u201d in the packets they bought they would need to buy a minimum of 137 packets to complete the entire book. That would cost \u00a3120.60. A total of 670 stickers in the entire book, with five stickers in each packet and a packet costing 90p: 670/5 = 134 packets x 90p = \u00a3120.60.  However, Harper said most people will find they collect many duplicate stickers. He worked out a formula to predict the probability of duplicates. \u201cThe first sticker you buy is absolutely guaranteed not to be a duplicate,\u201d he said in his research first posted in 2018. \u201cThe second sticker you get has a 681/682 (99.85%) chance of being a new sticker. The third sticker you get has a 680/682 (99.7%) chance of being a new sticker, and so on.\u201d The probability of finding new stickers when you get close to the end becomes vanishingly small, and most collectors resort to swapping stickers with friends or in online swap clubs. \u201cWhat is interesting is that to collect just the last 19 stickers for the book, you would still be required to buy 483 packets of stickers, or half the total number of expected packets,\u201d Harper said. \u201cPut another way, you are only halfway through when you have just 19 stickers left to collect.\u201d A migrant stadium worker who helped build the Qatar 2022 stadiums would need to have worked 1,964 hours to afford the cost of completing the album, based on the 45p-an-hour wage many were paid as revealed in a Guardian investigation. Panini reported annual sales of $1.4bn (\u00a31.2bn) in 2018 on the back of strong demand for its Russia 2018 stickers. This was more than double the $613m revenue achieved in 2017. Chris Clover, the managing director of Panini UK and Ireland, said: \u201cThe publishing phenomenon that is the Panini Fifa World Cup sticker collection reaches its 14th edition and anticipation across the globe is huge. The release of the collection has always kicked off the excitement for major international football tournaments, and this one will be no different. We have created a fresh new look and an innovative collection which promises to bring people of all ages together to swap and stick their way to completion.\u201d All 32 qualified teams for the tournament \u2013 which starts on 20 November \u2013 are included in the album, and are represented by a squad of 18 players, official strips and badges. The collection consists of a total of 670 stickers, including 50 special stickers known as \u201cshinies\u201d."

I got them right here.\u201d The words, there, of Nasser Al Khater, chief executive officer of Qatar 2022, speaking in Doha on Thursday morning. Actually that\u2019s not correct. In fact this is a line spoken by an unnamed door\u2011to\u2011door crack cocaine salesman in the TV series The Wire, during a sequence where the Baltimore police department experiments by decriminalising drugs in an abandoned neighbourhood. Addictions reach desperation level. The city\u2019s dealers create their own vision of entrepreneurial hell. And everyone gets a lesson in life-or-death commodity capitalism.  Al Khater didn\u2019t say anything about pipes. Instead, responding to some fairly mild expressions of concerns over LGBTQ+ rights from Gareth Southgate, he said: \u201cSomebody with a lot of influence like Southgate, somebody with a big audience that listens to what he says has got to choose his words very carefully.\u201d Al Khater went on to imply Southgate was ignorant and that he had failed to investigate properly the issues raised. And the message was clear enough. The chief executive, who has spent a very long time listening politely to this stuff, and being emollient and conciliatory, isn\u2019t going to take it any more. Later that day Hassan Al-Thawadi, secretary general of the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy of Qatar 2022, told the president of the Norwegian Football Federation, Lise Klaveness, that she needed to \u201ceducate\u201d herself before presuming to express moral qualms about a World Cup procured via a Fifa committee riddled with corrupt individuals. Not to mention staged in a nation where, frankly, Klaveness would be ineligible to be president of anything because she is gay, and therefore a member of a criminalised class. So yeah. Education. Stay classy guys. But one thing does seem clear as Qatar 2022 enters its extended countdown. There has been a change in the ambient mood music. Qatar is done with saying sorry. It has instead gone a little more alpha, flaring its neck muscles, snapping its towel across those gleaming new-build stadiums. It isn\u2019t hard to see why this is happening. And why it is probably also a good thing, or at least a little closer to the truth of this whole extraordinary episode. Why the shift of tone? Basically, Qatar is having an absolute moment. The stars have aligned. The World Cup is all packaged up. Gas prices have spiked. War in Europe is bringing daily pilgrims doffing their caps and wringing their hands over petroleum prices. Only last November Boris Johnson was sidling up to Amir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani at the UN general assembly urging Qatar to do us a solid by becoming the UK\u2019s \u201cgas supplier of last resort\u201d, which has a scary ring right now. This is giddy stuff. Boycott? Protests? Get real. You\u2019re all coming. And none of you are going say a word. OK, apart from you, Norway, with your carbon riches, your energy sufficiency. The rest of you, just keep eyes fixed on that sweet 200-year natural gas reserve. Take a hit. Suck it down. Pipes. You need them, we got them right here.  In this sense things have at least clarified a little. For those of us lost in the noise and colour it has been a bit like staring at a magic eye picture of history. It made no sense at all in Zurich in 2010. But fast forward to the current geopolitical map and it looks entirely logical. Of course, Qatar is staging the World Cup. Historians charting the events of our anxiety-ridden age will be able to use these twin World Cups, Russia-Qatar, as a neat practical example of the way oil and gas have driven power, conflict and wealth around the world; the way sport has been not only a metaphor for this, but an active and willing part of the process. Oil built the past two World Cups. Oil just won the Champions League. Oil has a lease on the Premier League title. They should probably just go ahead and fill the World Cup ball with natural gas, stick the winning team up on podium with an oversized camping cylinder they can light up like a Bunsen burner. And so it probably is a good thing if Qatar decides to be bit more frank about all this. Most obviously because we are all complicit. Until we kick this addiction, until gas and oil can be dialled back or replaced, we are all bound up in the process, from uneasy consumers, to the strange double life of our politicians pawing about for a deal, a handshake, a tanker route. Right up to the flaring hypocrisies of David Beckham, white knight of England\u2019s own World Cup bid and generally sympathetic to things like inclusion and liberal values which are so hot right now; but seduced also by the lure of Qatari money, and transformed into a ludicrous popinjay by his own \u00a3150m deal to help pretend this World Cup is just about cool hotels and nice stadiums.  But hey, Becks is only human. And in the end this is all a balance of those human needs. People close to the process have suggested for some time that the real reason Qatar wanted the World Cup in the first place is security. The morality stuff, the endless circular conversation about worker rights is a necessary soundtrack. But Qatar has one of the highest GDPs per capita in the world. Why would it care, really, what a small section of the liberal west thinks about aspects of its culture? In reality this has been about concerns that seem more a lot more real right now. Qatar wants to be known. Qatar doesn\u2019t want to be part of the mainstream. Qatar doesn\u2019t want its neighbours marching over the border while the world tries to find it on the map. That goal has been attained and gloriously so. From here on in Qatar no longer has to make nice. The rest of us, well, we\u2019re free to watch."

Licensed New South Wales venues will be allowed to stay open if they are broadcasting the do-or-die match from Qatar, which kicks off at 2am AEDT on Thursday. The NSW government has extended trading hours from midnight on Wednesday to 5am on Thursday for the game.  Australia\u2019s 1-0 win against Tunisia in Doha on the weekend has placed the nation on the brink of qualifying for the knockout phase of the cup for only the second time. If the team beats Denmark, the coach, Graham Arnold, will join his Dutch-born mentor Guus Hiddink who in 2006 steered the Socceroos out of their group. A draw is also likely to be enough to secure progression for the Socceroos. \u201cEvery four years when the Socceroos make the World Cup the whole nation is behind them,\u201d Arnold told Sydney radio station 2GB on Monday. \u201cRugby league fans, and AFL fans, cricket fans they all become football fans for that tournament,\u201d he said.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  The NSW hospitality minister, Kevin Anderson, said the Fifa World Cup was one of the biggest global sporting events, with more than half the world tuning in for the last one in 2018. \u201cWith these extended trading hours, fans will be able to gather at their local hotel or club to cheer the Socceroos to victory,\u201d he said.  Trading hours will be extended for future Socceroos matches if Australia progresses beyond the group stage. Extended trading will apply for the final, with venues able to open from 10pm on 18 December to 5am on 19 December. Western Australia has also announced it would allow venues to remain open to show World Cup matches. Venues have been able to apply for a \u201cone-off extended trading permit\u201d to show the games, and to trade until 30 minutes after the conclusion of the match. The WA racing and gaming minister, Tony Buti, said it was an opportunity to share in one of the world\u2019s biggest events. \u201cMany of the games start outside of normal pub or bar hours, which is rarely a deterrent for a dedicated football fan, so we hope everyone makes the most of the opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is also great for tourists, as there\u2019s nothing better than finding somewhere in a foreign city to tune in and watch your team. Thursday\u2019s match will also be shown at Federation Square in Melbourne, where the previous two group games were shown and attracted raucous crowds.  This article was amended on 29 November 2022. An earlier version incorrectly stated that it was a certainty that Australia would progress out of the group stage in the event of a draw with Denmark.  "

                    "body": "Saudi Arabia have been bringing the noise in Qatar. Fans have travelled in numbers greater than any other country, with only Argentina coming close. The emerald green shirt is a common sight across Doha. They\u2019re on the corniche and in the metro and, in their first two Group C fixtures, they have generated a fearsome atmosphere within the ground.\nIt may seem an observation that ought not to have to be made, but the Saudi fanbase in Qatar is made up of both men and women. At Education City on Saturday afternoon, perhaps one in 20 of those making their way into the stadium were female, making them equivalent to the number of women there to support Poland. This is a first.\nThree years ago, as part of a series of reforms, a decree from the Saudi royal family announced that women would be allowed to leave the country without first acquiring the consent of their male guardian. The guardianship system remains, and applies to every woman throughout their lives, with the role of guardian transferring from father to husband. But it does not apply in as many aspects as it once did \u2013 which means that going to this neighbouring World Cup, for a country that is demonstrably football mad, is now possible for everyone.\n\nTalking to female supporters before the match was not easy. Requests to talk were politely turned down and business cards offering the opportunity to talk later \u2013 just about the football \u2013 were returned. One woman, wearing the niqab, agreed to speak. Her name was Aliya, it was her first time watching her national side and she was optimistic: \u201cInshallah we will win.\u201d She said she was excited about being part of the experience: \u201cI am looking forward to the cheering and the people in there, the whole experience\u201d. Her husband took over. \u201cThis is the World Cup \u2013 this is what it means,\u201d he said. \u201cSaudi will go to the next stage, we will have female teams and a female league. Our new president supports everything and ladies come first.\u201d\n\nThe president of the Saudi Arabian Football Federation is Yasser al-Misehal, a former chair of the Saudi men\u2019s professional league and a member of Fifa\u2019s disciplinary committee. It is true he has presided over rapid change in the women\u2019s game in the country. Two years ago the Saudi Women\u2019s Premier League was established, the first national competition for women\u2019s club sides. Then, in the spring of this year, a potentially more momentous event occurred: a first international fixture, with Saudi Arabia women beating the Seychelles 2-0 in a friendly in Mauritius, the first step on a proposed pathway into the official Fifa classification.\nThe growth of the women\u2019s game comes a decade after Saudi officials were lobbying Fifa to ban the wearing of the hijab in football, a measure that would prevent women from playing the game at all. Five years ago women were not allowed into stadiums as spectators, the ban eventually lifted in three venues at the beginning of 2018. That these changes have been made at the same time as Saudi looks to claim a more central role in the sporting world, and with a potential bid for the 2030 World Cup on the way, may not be a coincidence. But they are real.\nA few minutes after I spoke to Aliya, Mariam Meshikhes walked past with her friend. Mariam lives in the east of Saudi Arabia, was attending her first match and wearing a replica Saudi away shirt and a light green hijab. It was fair to say she was not reluctant to talk about the experience.\n\n\u201cThis is my first World Cup, this is my first game I have ever attended in a stadium for the Saudi national team \u2013 this has been my dream since I was a teenager,\u201d she said. \u201cI have watched all the games. As a teenager I watched all of them and I was just wishing to be there and I can\u2019t believe that this is the day.\u201d\nAt this point her friend, an engineer, observed that Mariam, a doctor, had left her twins at home with her husband. \u201cThey\u2019re OK, they\u2019re OK,\u201d she said. \u201cThey know I\u2019m happy.\u201d\nWhat, Mariam was asked, did she think female football fans bring to a previously all-male crowd? \u201cWell, civility, obviously,\u201d she smiled. \u201cFemales are needed everywhere; we\u2019re 50% of our country \u2013 more than 50% of our country, right? She\u2019s an engineer, I\u2019m a doctor so we\u2019re already participating in our country. Now it\u2019s amazing that we are able to participate in rooting for our country in the World Cup. And to attend when they are on a winning streak \u2013 inshallah \u2013 and hopefully they win and they have a very big chance to be the first qualifier to the 16th round, was just ... you have no idea ... this is the greatest day of my life.\u201d\nOf course football doesn\u2019t always make dreams come true and Poland won a well-contested match 2-0. Now the Saudis face a final fixture against Mexico needing at least a point to qualify, and no doubt a stirring speech from their coach, Herv\u00e9 Renard, will be forthcoming. But the stars of the Poland match were as much the Saudi crowd as the players and they will be out in force at the 88,966-capacity Lusail Stadium on Wednesday. Much has been made of the means by which countries use sport to burnish their reputations, but there can be few more effective ambassadors for Saudi Arabia right now than their supporters.\n\u2022 This article was amended on 28 November 2022 to correct a misrendering of the name Herv\u00e9 Renard."

England have never been beaten by African opposition in 20 previous matches, although this will be the first time since Bobby Robson\u2019s side defeated Cameroon 3-2 after extra-time in a thrilling quarter-final at Italia 90 they have faced an African country in the knockout stages. \n\nEngland have had three 0-0 draws in group stages against African sides at World Cups, against Morocco in 1986, Nigeria in 2002 and Algeria in 2010. With a place in the last eight on the line this time, what can England expect from Ciss\u00e9 and co on Sunday?\nStrengths After a disappointing opening defeat by the Netherlands, Senegal bounced back in style against Qatar and showed real resilience in the latter stages of their crucial game against Ecuador. Kalidou Koulibaly\u2019s performance epitomised the team spirit Ciss\u00e9 has helped to create, with the Chelsea defender leading by example as he scored the vital winning goal. He and Abdou Diallo \u2013 who is on loan at RB Leipzig from Paris Saint\u2011Germain this season \u2013 form a strong partnership at the back and Isma\u00efla Sarr, Boulaye Dia and Iliman Ndiaye have emerged as the preferred front three providing a real goalscoring threat in Man\u00e9\u2019s absence.\nWeaknesses The midfield is usually a massive strength but there will be concerns over who can replace Everton\u2019s Gueye. In the expected continued absence of the former captain Cheikhou Kouyat\u00e9 with a hamstring injury, Pape Matar Sarr \u2013 the 20-year-old yet to play a minute for Tottenham this season despite being named on the bench six times \u2013 could be handed an opportunity. The left-back Ismail Jakobs, cleared to play hours before the first game after problems with his switch of allegiance from Germany, has provided more balance to the defence but the right-back Youssouf Sabaly can be the weak link.\nTactics Ciss\u00e9 has stuck rigidly to 4-3-3 for the most part, although Gueye was employed as a No 10 against Ecuador with Path\u00e9 Ciss and Pape Gueye in holding midfield roles. Senegal are likely to drop deeper against England, soak up pressure and attempt to hit on the break, with Ndiaye\u2019s and Sarr\u2019s trickery on either flank a key part of the gameplan. Dia, who is on loan at the Italian side Salernitana from Villarreal, is a physical presence in attack who likes to link up with the midfield.\n\nDanger men Sarr has shown glimpses of his ability at Watford since arriving from Rennes in 2019 for a club\u2011record \u00a330m but has been an integral part of Senegal\u2019s team for several years. The 24-year-old has 51 caps and scored his 11th international goal with a perfectly executed \u201cno\u2011look\u201d penalty after being fouled to halt a brilliant run. Ndiaye, the Sheffield United forward who made his debut in June, had seemed determined to take the spot-kick before being overruled by Ciss\u00e9. That was an indication of the confidence Ndiaye has been playing with since being introduced into the side. Both players from Championship clubs will be desperate to make a big impression against England.\nCoach The second African coach to have guided a team to the knockout stages of a World Cup, after Nigeria\u2019s Stephen Keshi in 2014, Ciss\u00e9 is developing a reputation as a master tactician with a knack for making the right calls. The 46-year-old\u2019s status as an icon in Senegal was cemented by the penalty shootout victory against Egypt at Afcon and the man born in Casamance who moved to France as a nine\u2011year\u2011old is the driving force behind his country\u2019s success. Ciss\u00e9 played for Birmingham and Portsmouth in the Premier League and began coaching as an assistant for the lower-league side Louhans-Cuiseaux in France before completing his licence at Clairefontaine, the home of French football. He has never managed a club but spent more than three years with Senegal\u2019s Under-23s before stepping up in 2015.\n\nMomentum It seemed all hopes that this team could emulate the class of 2002 had gone up in smoke after Man\u00e9 was ruled out. But Ciss\u00e9 has galvanised his players and made up for the disappointment of being cruelly eliminated from the last World Cup at the group stage because of their inferior disciplinary record to Japan\u2019s. Senegal will believe that anything is possible, especially as Koulibaly\u2019s winnner on Tuesday came less than three minutes after Ecuador\u2019s equaliser appeared to have ended their chances. \u201cIt is now a win or lose situation \u2013 there are no second chances,\u201d Ciss\u00e9 said. \u201cIf you win, you go through, if you lose, you go home.\u201d"

                    "body": "The Socceroos have wrapped up preparations for November\u2019s World Cup with a 2-0 win over New Zealand which showcased the team\u2019s best and worst form. In Australia\u2019s final match before taking on France at the Al Janoub Stadium in Al Wakrah on 22 November, second-half goals from Mitch Duke and Jason Cummings \u2013 the latter from the penalty spot \u2013 ensured Australia completed their Qatar 2022 preparations with a pair of wins against the All Whites, having defeated the same opponent in Brisbane last Thursday.  But it was the introduction of 18-year-old Garang Kuol with 20 minutes remaining that excited most, and the exciting attacker wasted no time showing why he has garnered international attention. His individual brilliance along the touchline created the chance preceding the penalty converted by his Central Coast teammate Cummings, who, like Kuol, was making his international debut. Kuol\u2019s 20-minute cameo, during which he never once looked overawed by the occasion of senior international football, has surely stamped his ticket to Qatar as Australia\u2019s bolter. Whether any of his teammates today did enough to force their way into calculations remains to be seen given the inconsistent nature of the Socceroos\u2019 most recent two outings. True to his word before the game, Socceroos coach Graham Arnold used the match as an opportunity to experiment, making wholesale changes to the team that edged New Zealand 1-0 on Thursday night in Brisbane. Ten players who featured in the centenary celebration at Suncorp Stadium were released from camp, free to return to their club sides, before Australia had even traveled to Auckland.  It meant Arnold made 11 changes to his starting line-up, with only Mat Leckie and Mitch Duke considered regulars, while the likes of Connor Metcalfe, Denis Genreau and Marco Tilio were offered a rare starting berth to press their case for selection in Australia\u2019s 26-man squad for Qatar. The group offered a glimpse into the future with many of those selected expected to form the nucleus of the Socceroos squad over the next World Cup cycle.  In the first five minutes, at least, the future looked bright as Australia started on the front foot. Riley McGree had the first genuine effort on goal inside the first quarter-hour with a long-range effort that packed power but not the required placement, shooting directly at All Whites custodian Ollie Sail. But as the half wore on it was the home side who took control, dictating the game\u2019s flow and tempo and rendering their visitors second best as Australia\u2019s struggled for any meaningful possession inside their forward third. And yet for all of New Zealand\u2019s first-half dominance, the Socceroos finished the half with the best opportunity and should have taken a lead into the break. Melbourne City midfielder Marco Tilio had the ball laid on a platter by Mitch Duke, who could have taken the shot himself but opted to slide the ball across for Tilio, waiting in front of an open net but inexplicably skewing his shot wide. Whatever Arnold said at half-time worked as Australia came out in the second half with far greater intent, pushing high and pressing the Kiwis at every opportunity. Eight minutes into the half they struck gold when Duke powerfully headed home an inch-perfect cross from Metcalfe to give the Socceroos the lead. Alex Grieve and Matthew Garbett both enjoyed half-chances for New Zealand but Andrew Redmayne, playing in green and gold for the first time since his penalty shootout heroics against Peru, could not be breached. The introduction of Kuol reinjected the spark into the Socceroos side, and were it not for a last-ditch block he too might have had a goal on debut, 56 days out of the World Cup."

                    "body": "  1.31pm    And that concludes the blog. Thanks all for your company and comments over the last month \u2013 enjoy the final, coverage of which you can find below. Peace and love!       1.30pm    I\u2019ve not yet got these 100% confirmed, but these appear to be our teams \u2013 and they look right. The big news is the return of \u00c1ngel di Mar\u00eda, which should give Argentina a bit more in the middle of the park. I\u2019m Lionel Scaloni \u2013 FAOD, I\u2019m not \u2013 I\u2019m playing him very narrow. Argentina (4-4-2): Mart\u00ednez; Molina, Romero, Otamendi, Acu\u00f1a; Di Mar\u00eda, De Paul, Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez, Mac Allister; Messi, \u00c1lvarez. France (4-3-3): Lloris, Kound\u00e9, Varane, Upamecano, T.Hernandez; Tchouam\u00e9ni, Rabiot, Griezmann; O.Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, Giroud, Mbapp\u00e9.   Updated at 1.32pm GMT    1.25pm    \u201cI remember one of the MBMs featuring Ghana included a recommendation for the following album,\u201d returns Joe Pearson. \u201cIt is a banger.\u201d Are we allowed to call a compilation an album? Well, either way, here it is.      1.22pm    Here\u2019s a final preview from Nick Ames.      1.19pm    \u201cI\u2019ll be watching today\u2019s game in Dublin with my good friend from Poland, Karolina,\u201d emails Robert Holmes. \u201cShe\u2019s not just a football nut, she also into referees (no idea) and is particularly excited for today\u2019s game due to the man in the middle, Szymon Marciniak, hailing from her native land. She\u2019s been telling me his origin story: as an undisciplined amateur player, he picked up a red card and gave the ref some backchat. The ref in question duly gave him the old \u2018If you think you\u2019re so clever why don\u2019t you become a ref and show us how it\u2019s done\u2019 line. Challenge accepted, this he duly did and today he\u2019s reffing the biggest match of them all. I can tell you, this Pole sitting beside me here is bursting with pride. You can read all about it here via a popular translate service if your Polish isn\u2019t too hot.\u201d I didn\u2019t know that \u2013 that\u2019s great.      1.17pm    It seems there\u2019s some overcrowding around the ground. Hopefully it sorts itself quickly.       1.13pm    My proudest achievement of this World Cup: a playlist of Ghanaian tunes, prepared for Ghana v Uruguay.      1.10pm    \u201cFor the record, I\u2019m still a Hoosier and still don\u2019t have an opinion on Southgate,\u201d says Joe Pearson in Indianapolis, \u201cbut I do think that Griezmann is the most important player in today\u2019s match. His floating, do whatever is needed, non-position has been a revelation all tournament.\u201d Yes, can\u2019t argue with his impact, and perhaps he\u2019s found his position. I hope he gets the chance to play it in club football and, I guess, we\u2019ve to credit Deschamps for finding it for him.      1.05pm    So how is this gamer going to go? I\u2019m leaning towards France, who I think have more knowhow, more ways to win, and the confidence that they\u2019re capable of it. Argentina lack a bit in midfield, I think, and if France dominate that area, which I think they will, I imagine they\u2019ll create enough chances to score the goals they need.      1.03pm    Our World Cup final MBM is liiiiiive!      12.56pm    \u201cIf we limit ourselves to World Cup winners, I think France in 1998 had probably the best crop of players in my lifetime, though West-Germany in 1990 is pretty close,\u201d reckons K\u00e1ri Tulinius. \u201cLooking back, Brazil in 1970 had an absurd lineup that\u2019s hard to look past. But I don\u2019t think this year\u2019s France comes close. If they had a better crop, they\u2019d have at least one each of an attacking midfielder and a left-back; instead Deschamps figured out how to make previously round holes square, to fit the pegs he had. Considering how spectacularly unlucky France have been with injuries, if France win today it\u2019ll possibly be the greatest feat of international management in football history. And let me add my voice to the chorus of thanks. If a tournament ever needed the kind of wide-ranging context that you and your colleagues provide, it was this one.\u201d But France 98 had St\u00e9phane Guivarc\u2019h up front, and Thierry Henry wasn\u2019t yet Thierry Henry. By Euro 2000, they were better, I think \u2013 also because Patrick Vieira was also better.      12.51pm    \u201cIf you\u2019re Argentina you don\u2019t want three at the back,\u201d returns Yash Gupta. \u2018\u201cGriezmann\u2019s deeper role plus Giroud and Mbappe will leave back three all over the shop and Argentinian midfield will be unable to balance offence and defence. It should be saved as an in-game change to change the tide when France will be on top or to close the shop. Harsh on Lisandro Martinez nevertheless.\u201d I dislike three at the back as a general rule, but 4-4-2 means conceding midfield and possession \u2013 which against a team with Mbapp\u00e9 up front and Greizmann in form is asking for trouble. Perhaps Scaloni will go 4-3-3.      12.48pm    \u201cYou\u2019re right about the Hand of God,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cI think the full quote made reference to divine intervention and went something like \u2018a little bit the hand of Maradona, a little bit the hand of God\u2019. Couldn\u2019t happen today with VAR of course, and more\u2019s the pity I say. But then I am Scottish, so not entirely neutral. Thanks for all the coverage, here\u2019s to a great final\u2026\u201d Football would be the poorer without that goal, I\u2019d say.      12.41pm    \u201cThere will be intriguing battles all over the pitch,\u201d emails Yash Gupta, \u201cbut Romero v Mbapp\u00e9 edges everything else for me. If the ref lets things go, which they usually do in a final, that matchup will overshadow everything else and I can\u2019t wait to see that!\u201d Scaloni\u2019s centre-back preferences are interesting \u2013 Romero has a lot of potential and a lot of attributes but he can be wild, while Otamendi always has an error in him. So I\u2019m surprised Lisandro Mart\u00ednez has been in and out; we might see three at the back today, but 4-4-2 seems more likely.      12.36pm    The Pakistan v England Test has finished for the day, and it\u2019s brewing.       12.32pm    \u201cI too would like to add my thanks for your coverage of a World Cup that I originally viewed with apathy,\u201d emails Nigel Phillips, \u201cbut have really actually enjoyed your real-time comments add to a communal atmosphere that because of a lack of local pubs, I\u2019ve been missing. Argentina to win 3-2.\u201d Thanks Nigel, our pleasure. An Argentina 3-2 sounds alright.      12.29pm    There are some belters in this:      12.24pm    On which point, Rapha\u00ebl Varane already has one of the best CVs in football \u2013 one World Cup, three La Ligas and four Champions Leagues. But another of the former? That would be absurd.      12.22pm    I wonder if France\u2019s current crop is the best pool of players any country has ever had. They might just lack an all-time great \u2013 Mbapp\u00e9 will obviously be a generational one, but beyond that I\u2019m not sure \u2013 and it\u2019s hard (for me) to rank them alongside the best international outfits I\u2019ve seen. But you can\u2019t argue with consecutive World Cups (or should that be Worlds Cup)?     12.20pm    But back to the final, here\u2019s Jacob Steinberg\u2019s preview.      12.16pm    But perhaps the most significant footballing development is proper added time. I also wrote about that:       12.12pm    I asked for moments of the tournament a little earlier; mine is Morocco beating Portugal, and this is why:       12.08pm    \u201cGiven the greed Messi showed in grabbing millions to become Saudi Arabia\u2019s \u2018tourism envoy\u2019, \u201c says Darryl Accone, \u201cpoetic justice would be for him to miss a winning penalty and then for his team to lose. As an ethics-free indentured servant of both the Saudis and Qatar (PSG), that would be an apt catharsis.\u201d For more information on that, read this:      12.03pm    Earlier, we were talking about this World Cup needing an epic final. I wrote about what constitutes the perfect competition before we got going, and dreadful stuff notwithstanding, that\u2019s my biggest criticism.       11.58am    \u201cIf Messi scores the winner today,\u201d says Phil Grey, \u201cdo you think the goal will be known as The foot of God?\u201d I\u2019d say not because I always thought the God whose hand it was was actual God, i.e. Maradona saying there was an intervention, rather than it being said that he was God. Have I misunderstood all these years?      11.53am    Breaking news: the heating is off.      11.52am    Here\u2019s David Hytner on Southgate:      11.47am    \u201cThanks for your and your colleagues\u2019 fantastic coverage of a thoroughly enjoyable World Cup,\u201d emails Mark Moran. \u201cOn the prospect of Messi winning the it, I\u2019m in two minds. On one hand, I want Argentina to win because I love how passionate the nation is and I\u2019ve recently discovered that Alexis Mac Allister and I share a great-great-great grandfather (!). However, I find the media frenzy in some quarters around Messi quite wearing and especially feel sorry for goalscorers to whom he provides the assist, who are completely overshadowed. I have no particular love for or dislike of Messi, and while recognising that he is an unbelievably talented player that we are fortunate to see play on the biggest stage, I think the hysteria around him if he wins the World Cup may be tiresome.\u201d Excuse me?! Alexis Mac Allister is your cousin? You need to be on the phone for comps!      11.44am    Will posted this earlier but I\u2019m going to post it again, simply because Marcela Mora y Araujo is a great woman and, alongside Jorge Valdano, the person I most want to read on Argentinian football.       11.40am    \u201cI agree that there hasn\u2019t been a bona fide classic this tournament, like France-Argentina last time around,\u201d says K\u00e1ri Tulinius, \u201cbut all the quarter-finals came close. I\u2019m having a hard time picking one, though I\u2019d probably opt for England v France, because it was high quality throughout, and featured two good teams posing difficult questions to each other and then solving them.  I think the defence of the tournament is pretty clear, Tagliafico, Gvardiol, Varane and Hakimi. I\u2019m less sure about midfielders and forwards, but I think I\u2019d go for Tchouam\u00e9ni, Modric and Griezmann in midfield, and Messi, Mbapp\u00e9 and Giroud up front. The Moroccan players dancing with their moms is obviously the best moment, but I suppose it wasn\u2019t during a match. I which case my favourite moment was those three minutes when both Spain and Germany were going out and Costa Rica and Japan were going through.\u201d I agree England v France was the highest standard, and we got some good extra-time in Brazil v Croatia, but yeah, the final round of group games was when this tournament peaked. I can have three of that back four \u2013 Tagliafico isn\u2019t getting in mine though I\u2019m not sure who is. I love Modric but don\u2019t think he played that well in this tournament \u2013 I\u2019d have Casemiro and the two Moroccan lads ahead of him and Tchouameni, I think. I also think I\u2019m having \u00c1lvarez before Giroud.      11.32am    \u201cAs a Boro fan,\u201d confides Victor Rushton, \u201cI have never had much time for Southgate\u2019s management skills. At the highest level he is found to be too cautious tactically, and one has to highlight the over indulgence of favourites such as Pickford and Kane. \u0130t was widely predicted that England would get to the quarters and then lose to the first decent team we played, that should not be considered a success. Deep down we all know England will never win anything with Southgate in charge. Ultimately we have decided to persist with a diplomat, rather than a coach.\u201d I can\u2019t say I haven\u2019t criticised Southgate for managing England like he\u2019s managing Boro, but I do think he\u2019s improved in this tournament. Any team can lose to France, so I don\u2019t think the line about first decent team he faced is a fair one \u2013 he was a missed penalty away from extra time \u2013 and I don\u2019t see an outstanding replacement around, unless Emma Hayes fancies it.  Updated at 11.32am GMT    11.29am    \u201cBad decision in my view,\u201d says David Sheal on Southgate. \u201cKept with same team against France that performed poorly in first half of Senegal game. Substituted too late (as usual). Rashford should have been on at the start of the second half along with Grealish and Trippier. Grealish had two minutes to make an impact! What would Deschamps have done? Played Rashford and Trippier from the start and brought Grealish on mid second half. Madness to let Kane take a second penalty against Lloris, who knows him so well. We all saw the save coming. Southgate has done what he can-he keeps making the same mistakes. The France game was winnable. We lost it.\u201d I agree the France game was winnable and that Southgate used his subs too late, but I don\u2019t think he got the team wrong, especially. I\u2019d maybe have gone Phillips not Henderson, but I doubt that gives a different result, and England\u2019s performance from 45-65 tells us he was right not to make changes at the break \u2013 managers rarely do. I also don\u2019t think Deschamps is any great shakes as a manager, he\u2019s just got good players and one amazing player.      11.25am    On which point, epics is where this World Cup has fallen down. The quarter-finals were fun and dramatic, but we\u2019ve not seen a classic match of wild quality, I don\u2019t think. One today, and as the years pass we\u2019ll look at this tournament very differently.      11.23am    \u201cPerhaps i\u2019m in a minority of one,\u201d says David Wall, \u201cbut I\u2019m kind of hoping that France win precisely so that Messi doesn\u2019t ever win the World Cup. That\u2019s nothing against Messi personally, i think he\u2019s a wonderful player (though I\u2019m not interested in arguments about who is the best ever player, etc). I just think that it\u2019s better for the game that it can\u2019t be bent so readily towards such nice narratives, that it isn\u2019t something that people can ever really master. So I think there was something beautiful in the fact that, say, Pele put his shot wide after that outrageous dummy on the goalkeeper in 1970, that Brian Clough never won the FA Cup, that Gary Lineker fluffed the penalty that would have equalled Bobby Charlton\u2019s England goal scoring record and so on. It would all be too neat for Messi to finally get his hands on the World Cup, as though there\u2019s nothing left to achieve.\u201d I don\u2019t have a strong feeling on Messi: if he does it, he deserves it, but I don\u2019t think his career requires it and I don\u2019t desire it for him \u2013 partly for that reason and partly because much as his football is incredible, I don\u2019t feel a personal connection to him the way I do to some. I\u2019d love a proper epic, though.      11.18am    I don\u2019t feel strongly about most aspects of these things, but if this isn\u2019t your best goal, we\u2019ve got a problem.       11.15am    I\u2019m trying to think of my team. I guess players you can\u2019t leave out are Messi, Mbapp\u00e9 and Griezmann; at least one of Amrabat and Ounahi, maybe both.      11.14am    Otherwise, who are we saying is our player of the tournament? I guess that one might have to wait until later, but send in your teams, your best matches, best moments and such.      11.13am    So what do we think about Gareth Southgate staying on as England manager? Now that you don\u2019t ask, I\u2019d say that on balance it\u2019s good for all parties. Southgate\u2019s in-game management needs to improve \u2013 he was reactive against France \u2013 but I\u2019ve seen definite progress through the tournaments and, now the team looks to be peaking, he\u2019s earned the opportunity to take it to the Euros.      11.10am    Also going on: England have just overtaken Pakistan\u2019s first-innings score and three wickets with which to establish a lead.       11.09am    Tell you what, though: much as I\u2019m buzzing for the game, my wife and daughter are going out for the day shortly, and when that happens \u2026 I\u2019m going to turn the heating off!       11.02am    Here\u2019s my preview of what should be a belting final\u2026       11.00am    Morning everyone and thanks Will. Just two sleeps until the return of the Carabao!      10.59am    Thanks for joining me for the early hours of the day. Daniel Harris is here for the next couple of hours.      10.49am    Naturally, the animals need to decide who will.      10.37am    \u201cThank you for all the fantastic coverage during this WC, but what on earth are we going to do come tomorrow? Back to politics live?\u201d asks Americo Bagnatti. \u201cTo add to what fellow reader Francisco explained regarding the \u201ccabalas\u201d, superstitions and jinxes Argentinian fans embrace, I\u2019d like to direct you to this Quilmes ad (I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re allowed to share ads for beer on the live blog), which has a somewhat humorous but ultimately illuminating take on the subject.\u201d I expect a free case of Quilmes for this.   Updated at 10.47am GMT    10.32am   Southgate to stay on as England manager  Gareth Southgate has a contract until 2024 but the FA have taken the time to confirm he has not quit, so that is nice.    Updated at 10.38am GMT    10.28am    In Paris the Metro station \u2018Argentine\u2019 has been renamed for the day. Lovely stuff.       10.15am    It did not take long for Gareth Southgate to stick with England. I suspect the fact he would not get a top club job and this England team has potential meant it was the only sensible decision to make. David Hytner has a look at what it all means.      10.09am    WhoScored have taken a look at the two teams - and they use stats and all that.      9.47am    And for France \u2026 We have Philippe Auclair on Didier Deschamps.  David Hytner on Lloris.      9.42am    Let\u2019s have a little focus on Argentina for a moment. Starting with Jonathan Wilson on Julian Alvarez.  Sid Lowe &amp; friends on Lionel Scaloni.  And some Paul MacInnes for good measure.      9.38am    \u201cWe\u2019re always in the news for bad stuff, politics and the economy aren\u2019t going in the direction you might want, and it\u2019s been a long time since there\u2019s been a genuine reason to celebrate.\u201d Amy Booth in BA.       9.34am    The global game, in pictures.      9.23am    We can all see it, right\u2026?      9.19am    Croatia midfielder Luka Modric said he intends to play for the Balkan nation until the Nations League finals in June next year but has yet to decide about his participation at the Euro 2024 tournament. Modric helped Croatia win the bronze medal at the World Cup in Qatar after they defeated Morocco 2-1 in the third-place playoff on Saturday, having finished as runners-up at the 2018 edition in Russia. Croatia head coach Zlatko Dalic said this week Modric is likely to feature for them at the Euros in Germany despite his age should the team qualify, but the 37-year-old said on Saturday that he would consider his options. \u201cAbout my future? I do not know if I will play until the Euros in Germany. I need to go step by step,\u201d Modric told beIN Sports. \u201cI am enjoying the national team and I feel happy. I still think I can perform at a high level. Then after, there will be more time to think about the Euros. Now it is (to) go step by step and continue at least until Nations League and then we will see.\u201d Reuters     9.18am    I am sure he is open to suggestions.      9.16am    Buenos Aires is primed.     Updated at 9.17am GMT    9.01am    Let\u2019s have a look at two key individuals in today\u2019s match. Nick Ames on Emi Martinez.   Jacob Steinberg on Dembele.      8.52am    \u201cFrancisco here, a 32-year-old Argentinian,\u201d good morning Francisco. \u201cWonderful job throughout the World Cup from you and your colleagues, deep admiration and congratulations!\u201d stop it! \u201cThree things to share \u2026 \u201cFirst the incredible level of excitement here. It\u2019s something out of this world. Encapsulated by this Twitter thread made of celebrations after reaching the final a couple of days ago - can\u2019t even imagine what could happen if things go the way we want them to go yesterday (touch a million pieces of wood!).  \u201cSecond, as evidenced in how I phrased the potential result above, is the superstition or \u201cc\u00e1balas\u201d we Argentinians use. Amongst all, it is never to say something that may happen lest you jinx it. So every person here talking about the match will never say something like \u201cwe\u2019ll win it\u201d or start celebrating beforehand. I know of people who always use the same clothes to see the match, others who stand up every time Messi touches the ball, or watching the matches alone on purpose. So much so this way of thinking goes that, as a joke to hope somebody would lose, we say \u201cah, congratulations to the team for having won x tournament\u201d in a way to jinx them. Lots of traditions and superstitions in the hope that some deity (Maradona?) helps us. Having lived in London for the last six years I find it interesting to compare this view with the classic irony of British humour with the \u201cit\u2019s coming home\u201d chant.  \u201cThird - I know Tiger Tiger around Trafalgar Square was showing the matches and it was full of Argentinians.\u201d \u201cVamos argentina!!\u201d     8.45am    Mbappe? Nah. Antoine Griezmann is the man to stop, according to our very won Karen Carney.      8.32am    Fill your boots with the briefing.      8.25am    Naturally, if Argentina do win and Messi scores the winner, and a commentator says \u201cyou could not write this\u201d, then they should be sacked on the spot. I think the world\u2019s best (ever) player scoring a big goal in the biggest match really is quite easy to write. Even I could put that script together.      8.21am    Barney Ronay has had a busy few days coughing up phlegm and writing about Doha.  Here are his latest offerings \u2026       8.12am    One interesting for France is the absence is Karim Benzema. He left the camp before the tournament began with a thigh problem but has not returned despite playing in friendlies for Real Madrid. His social media output has been quite cryptic in recent days, mainly him posting about winning the Ballon d\u2019Or. I think there is a bigger story to come out of that once the competition is done and dusted.      8.10am    The important thing is to get into the mood for the final and the only way to really do that is by reading a plethora of Guardian features on France and Argentina.  We start with Marcela Mora y Araujo in Buenos Aires on that Messi chap.   Jacob Steinberg looks at France and their stars who were in this position four years ago before defeating Croatia.      8.07am   Hello  Finally, after what seems like an eternity, we have reached the final. We can all go back to spending time with our loved ones and watching club football once the day is done. In the meantime, it is the final a lot of people wanted: Messi v Mbappe. Argentina have been excellent since their opening match bashing by Saudi Arabia, while France have trudged through to the final two with some acceptable performances. The match kicks off at 3pm UK time, so use your search engine of choice to find out what the means for you. Here\u2019s to an exciting day that the world has been waiting for since 2018, in a way.  "

The Fulham player embraced fellow defender Ramin Rezaeian, who was in tears, and spent time with Abolfazl Jalali, who had slumped to the turf at the final whistle. Images and footage of Robinson and the Iran players quickly went viral on social media, where he won praise for his empathy.\n\nIran\u2019s players had been under huge pressure due to issues off the pitch. In their first match of the tournament, against England, they failed to sing the national anthem in an apparent show of support for anti-regime protests in Iran, which began after the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody in September. Conservative figures in the country have warned the players they may face consequences for their actions when they return home, and the players sang the anthem \u2013 albeit half-heartedly \u2013 before their games against Wales and the US.\nSome fans in Iran celebrated the team\u2019s World Cup exit as they believed the government would use any success as a propaganda tool.\n\nAt the end of the match, the Iranian journalist Masih Alinejad posted videos of celebrations on Twitter, writing: \u201cIran is a country where people are very passionate about football. Now they are out in the streets in the city of Sanandaj and celebrate the loss of their football team against US.\u201d\nThere were also pockets of protest among fans in the stadium on Tuesday night. Some smuggled in T-shirts bearing the words \u201cwomen life freedom\u201d. There were also signs condemning US sanctions against Iran and some fans brought in flags of Palestine."

We will definitely support it if any [Saudi] private sector comes in, because we know that\u2019s going to reflect positively on sports within the kingdom. If there\u2019s an investor willing to do so and the numbers add up, why not?\u201d\n\nThe prince also stated a wish to see Cristiano Ronaldo play in Saudi. The 37-year-old is a free agent after leaving United by mutual agreement this week and he recently stated that he turned down a two-year deal in the summer worth more than \u00a3300m a year from a Saudi club.\n\u201cI would love to see Ronaldo play in the Saudi league,\u201d said Prince Abdulaziz. \u201cIt would benefit the league, the sports eco-system in Saudi and will inspire the youth for the future. He\u2019s a role model to a lot of kids and has a big fanbase in Saudi.\u201d\nRonaldo scored in Portugal\u2019s 3-2 win over Ghana at the Qatar World Cup on Thursday and Saudi may make its own bid to host the tournament. \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t want to host the World Cup?\u201d the prince said. \u201cAny country in the world would love to host the World Cup.\u201d\nIn hosting major sporting events including boxing world title fights Saudi has been accused of sportwashing to deflect criticism of its record on human rights. But Prince Abdulaziz claimed doing so has been positive for his nation\u2019s people.\n\n\u201cThe numbers don\u2019t lie \u2013 when you look at participation in boxing, from six gyms in 2018 to 57 gyms today. A 300% participation increase, 60% are women, which was a shock for us. When you see appetite from the youth, men and women, they learned from it. If it\u2019s making the country better and fixing a lot of the social issues we have in terms of participation then that\u2019s a benefit for us,\u201d he said."

                    "body": "Lionel Messi urged Argentina to overcome one last hurdle after they reached the World Cup final by defeating Croatia 3-0 on Tuesday night.\nMessi was in inspired form in front of an adoring audience at the Lusail Stadium, opening the scoring with a penalty and making two goals for Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez. The 35-year-old\u2019s performance led to his manager, Lionel Scaloni, calling him the greatest player of all time and opened up the prospect of Argentina, who had been in danger of an early exit after losing against Saudi Arabia in their opening game in Qatar, finally seeing their star player win the World Cup.\n\n\u201cThe first match was a hard blow,\u201d Messi said. \u201cWe had been unbeaten in 36 matches. We didn\u2019t think we would lose versus Saudi Arabia. To start in such a way was an acid test for the squad. But this squad proved how strong we are. Every match was a final.\n\u201cThis leaves a mental load. We have played five finals and have won five finals. I hope this will be the way in the final game. We were confident we would make it as we knew what we are capable of.\u201d\n\nMessi, who is not expected to play in another World Cup, is determined to make up for losing the 2014 final against Germany. The forward has led by example and was too good for Croatia, creating \u00c1lvarez\u2019s second goal with a trademark dribble. He is now one win away from emulating Diego Maradona, who inspired Argentina when they became world champions in 1986.\n\u201cWhether Messi is the greatest of all time ... I don\u2019t have any doubt,\u201d Scaloni said. \u201cI have been saying this all the time with my staff. Every time you see him playing it is a huge motivation for his teammates. There is nothing left to say about Messi. It is a privilege to have him.\u201d\nFrance or Morocco will block Argentina\u2019s path to a third title. Messi argued that Scaloni\u2019s side will be well prepared for either opponent. \u201cThis squad is very intelligent,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know how to read the game. We know how to suffer. We have an excellent technical staff.\u201d\nZlatko Dalic, who insisted he will lead Croatia into qualifying for Euro 2024, was unhappy with the penalty for the first goal. Dalic thought Croatia should have been given a corner before Argentina counterattacked, and he felt Dominik Livakovic was unfortunate to be penalised for bringing down \u00c1lvarez in the area.\nThere were angry protests from the Croatia bench before Messi converted his spot-kick. Mario Manduzkic, the assistant coach, was sent to the stands.\nHowever, Dalic admitted his side were well beaten. It was a sad end for Luka Modric, who was withdrawn with 10 minutes left, although the 37-year-old midfielder has indicated he could continue to play for Croatia."

The John Lewis advert has arrived, tugging on the nation\u2019s heartstrings and overdraft facilities with a cover of Blink 182; the Guardian Sport Xmas do was on Thursday night, which is why this Fiver reads as if written by a rampantly hungover tea-time email guiltily phoning it in, in the hope The Man is still depositing unmetabolised cr\u00e8me de menthe into a wastepaper basket; and various Premier League managers have been asked about what it would mean to be top/third/16th/bottom on 25 December. The disease of the mind that led Fifa\u2019s finest to award its fancy shindig to Qatar means this weekend\u2019s round of fixtures is the last before Santa tours the country dispensing Voltarol to hundreds of red-zoned Premier League footballers.

In other news, Cristiano Ronaldo missed Manchester United\u2019s Milk Cup win over Aston Villa through illness. If Arsenal win at Wolves on Saturday, they will be top at Christmas \u2013 a symbolic and almost entirely meaningless achievement at the best of the times, never mind when Christmas comes on 12 November. It might not be a bad thing if Arsenal aren\u2019t first when the presents are unwrapped. The last five times that happened, between 1951 and 2007, they blew the title, usually via a thundering meltdown. Arsenal made a statement last week by battering Chelsea 1-0. Newcastle will hope to do the same at St James\u2019 Park in the weekend\u2019s biggest game. They sit deservedly in third, making The Fiver wonder whether it should trademark the phrase \u201cBig Seven\u201d and try to sue every news organisation in the land when they start using it. Newcastle also have three players in the England HRWC squad, Eddie Howe is the Premier League Manager of the Month and Wor Miggy Almir\u00f3n has won his first Player of the Month award since coming to England. That\u2019s one more than Jack Grealish, the life coach whose controversial methods \u2013 derived from the classical English theory of sneering drunken abuse \u2013 have revived Almir\u00f3n\u2019s career.

                    "body": "DON\u2019T MENTION THE VAR What the Human Rights World Cup lacks in equality, dignity, human rights and Scotland, it is more than making up for in drama. The last group games have been popcorn-gorging, brain-melting belters, with something for everyone: schadenfreude addicts, conspiracy theorists, historians and permutations junkies. Belgium and Germany went out on Thursday, and for a delirious couple of minutes, in which it was beyond the wit of man to utter anything other than \u201cOh my God!\u201d, it looked like Spain might join them. Belgium\u2019s exit was on the cards after their defeat to Morocco on Sunday, but nobody saw the manner of it coming. Poor Romelu Lukaku produced a tragi-cameo for the ages, with a personal xG of 1.98 and a G of 0.00. His only shot on target was when he rammed his fist into the dugout after the game. Germany followed Belgium to the airport a few hours later despite beating Costa Rica 4-2. That\u2019s because Japan beat Spain, with a winning goal that, at first glance, seemed to involve the ball going out of play before Kaoru Mitoma cut it back to the goalscorer Ao Tanaka. Everyone shouted \u201cOver the line!\u201d like Walter Sobchak until, a long time after the event, somebody stumbled upon an angle that showed the curvature \u2013 don\u2019t pretend you\u2019d ever heard that word before it came out of Peter Walton\u2019s mouth \u2013 of the ball may not have been completely over the line. This was not enough for ITV pundit Graeme Souness, who muttered darkly about cover-ups and stopped just short of saying that Fifa was responsible for a psyop called Covid-19. Friday\u2019s matches will decide the last four places in the second round, which begins on Saturday. England play Senegal on Sunday evening, which is bad news for the viewing figures of Countryfile on BBC1 \u2013 not to mention Craig Charles: UFO Conspiracies on the History channel, this time with guest presenter Graeme Souness. Before all that, there\u2019s the small matter of Ghana v Uruguay to decide who joins Portugal in the last 16. There\u2019s a small chance that South Korea could finish above them both, but the likelihood is that it\u2019ll be a fight to the death, just like it was in the quarter-final 12 years ago. Luis Su\u00e1rez, whose handball on the line stopped Ghana becoming the first African team to reach the semi-final, pointedly held court in front of the press on Thursday. The gist of his message was, well: bite me. \u201cI didn\u2019t say sorry because I did the handball but Ghana\u2019s player missed the penalty, not me,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe I would apologise if I tackled and injured a player but in this situation I took the red card, the referee gave a penalty and it\u2019s not my fault because I didn\u2019t miss the penalty. The player who missed it said he\u2019d do the same. It\u2019s not my responsibility to take the penalty.\u201d The Ghana coach Otto Addo agreed with Su\u00e1rez, pretty much, but such reason is unlikely to be evident when the game gets going \u2013 especially if Su\u00e1rez again demonstrates his win-at-costs-you-can\u2019t-imagine mentality.

There are cats strolling around and he\u2019s scared of them. It makes everyone laugh\u201d \u2013 France\u2019s Randal Kolo Muani is short on sympathy for teammate Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, who is apparently struggling to deal with the number of stray felines on the streets of Doha.   FOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS \u201cSo, there we were, on a winter sun holiday in Tenerife, and decided last night (of all nights) to go to a lovely restaurant with no TV and no football. Good food, good wine and good chat with Mrs Smith. A romantic evening. On our way there I caught a glimpse in a bar, of the early scores, 1-0 to both Germany and Spain. You\u2019re a genius Mike, the best night not to watch. About an hour later and well into food, wine and chat, my phone receives lots of WhatsApp messages from friends back home in freezing Wiltshire. \u2018Hope you\u2019re watching this mayhem, bedlam, carnage, chaos, ridiculousness \u2026\u2019 I then spent 30 minutes or so constantly refreshing the scores. Romance went out the window when I excitedly told Mrs Smith that, at one point, Spain and Germany were going home. All is fine here, we love each other \u2013 I\u2019ll make it up to her on Sunday when we get home to freezing Wiltshire. Oh no, it\u2019s England v Senegal\u201d \u2013 Mike Smith. \u201c\u2018Denmark as the HRWC\u2019s biggest disappointment (yesterday\u2019s Football Daily)? Roberto Mart\u00ednez has entered the chat\u201d \u2013 JJ Zucal. \u201cSo, like any Football Daily pedant, I was intrigued by your crafty line that the Danish team took \u2018flight DO1 to Copenhagen\u2019 (yesterday\u2019s Football Daily) after their poor runout at the HR World Cup. Well, that\u2019ll be a long travel day. \u2018DO\u2019 is the international code for Compania Dominicana de Avia. I\u2019ll assume they have a quick layover in the Dominican Republic and be home by nightfall\u201d \u2013 Mike Wilner. \u201cLiverpool\u2019s 2,500 new rail seats (yesterday\u2019s Beyond the HRWC) won\u2019t be much use for any fans wanting to travel to Anfield with Avanti West Coast, given they\u2019ll struggle to get a rail seat, rail stand or rail hide-in-the-toilet to get there\u201d \u2013 Jim Hearson.

                    "body": "Speak to fans in Doha and nobody has a bad word to say. When you announce you\u2019re a journalist there\u2019s a narrowing of the eyes, an uncertainty about what you might ask, but when it\u2019s clear it\u2019s the experience and not the host country you want to talk about there\u2019s a list of positives: transport is great, the city is safe and the experience at the matches has been wonderful.\nMost supporters are here for a short while and perhaps on a tour. Two England fans, father and son, had taken in the Formula One in Abu Dhabi on the way over. One American family, browsing the rails at a knock-off sports shop, were taking in 10 games in Thanksgiving week then heading home. What were they doing in between matches? \u201cIt\u2019s quite nocturnal, so you sleep. And then you go to the mall. I mean, it\u2019s the Gulf \u2013 what else is there to do?\u201d\nThere have been some miserable exceptions to this rule with reports of sewage flooding shipping container apartments in fan villages, or brown water coming from taps. Some fans have been offered a refund on accommodation that had not been finished in time. Meanwhile Wales fans have had to engage their Football Association to complain to Fifa after their hats were confiscated by security because they displayed the rainbow symbol.\n\nStill, it is difficult to find discord on the streets of Qatar \u2013 that may be because those who are disgruntled have stayed at home. A lot of people have looked at the price, looked at the restrictions \u2013 with all accommodation and transportation funnelled through the organisers and entry to the country dependent on possession of a match ticket \u2013 and decided to give this World Cup a miss. Official estimations of 1.2 million foreign visitors this month seem way off.\nThat\u2019s not to say you can\u2019t tell a tournament is on. Doha has been done up to the nines, plastered in bunting, slogans and endless advertising, some of it stripped hundreds of metres along the height of skyscrapers in the gleaming West Bay district. At night and weekends the locals \u2013 largely but not exclusively the South Asian community \u2013 take to the streets in replica shirts (Argentina, then Brazil, then Qatar in that order) and bang drums on the Corniche and the \u201cboulevard\u201d of the new neighbourhood-cum-city of Lusail.\n\nThere are, also, decent contingents from regional neighbours \u2013 Saudi Arabia most obviously, but also Morocco and Tunisia. Argentinians and Mexicans have travelled too, the Latin American presence at a tournament thousands of miles and dollars away perhaps boosted by expat communities from the USA. In terms of substantial followings, that may be about the full extent, with other countries maxing out at the 2,000 to 3,000 ultras visible in the stadiums.\nThe matches are the best place to see people. There hasn\u2019t been a fixture without empty seats, with Qatar\u2019s match against Senegal on Friday the most egregious example yet. But most games have had an atmosphere worthy of a World Cup, largely thanks to the ultras and their resident drummers, but perhaps also down to the acoustics of stadiums built at such great cost.\nTo be in the ground is to feel part of something, but that sensation quickly dissipates on departure and to recapture it is a challenge almost impossible to master. The organisers have their answer: the Fifa fan festival, a 40,000-capacity space in full view of the West Bay skyscrapers. It has free entry for those with appropriate ID (the Hayya card, a digital application so insecure that German authorities have advised wiping your phone after using it). It stays open till 2am and by 10pm the crowd can be substantial, but they remain quiet. That is perhaps a reflection of the atomised groups of supporters in attendance, padded out by locals who \u2013 not infrequently \u2013 are taking advantage of the opportunity to drink alcohol legally and in public.\nThe fan festival has no seating and no shade (if fans do complain about one thing it\u2019s that awnings and umbrellas or even trees to cut out the glare from the still fiery winter sun are in short supply). The attractions on offer within are largely showcases for the products of sponsors. The fan festival is as much trade fair as fun park and beyond it there are not many places to go.\nTo come to Doha is to experience a city without a sense of the public realm. It\u2019s the absence not only of bars to gather in but of parks and squares too. The best \u201climbs\u201d videos of exuberant support have come from small, dark bars in international hotels. The American family are not wrong when they say that the mall \u2013 of which there are many \u2013 is the best place to congregate. But traipsing around the shops does not facilitate the sort of spontaneous meeting and exchange with people from different cultures that usually characterises an international sporting event.\nThe opening week of this tournament has been characterised by tension over who controls the World Cup. Changing rules over the sale of beer suggested Qatari organisers had the whip hand over Fifa. Threats of sporting sanctions over OneLove armbands showed Fifa flexing its muscles over European associations. Where the fans and the countries they represent sit among all this is a moot point. The strange thing, and this is a strange World Cup no doubt, is that very few people here seem to be bothered."

                    "body": "Three games into their World Cup campaign, 11 games into 2022, 79 games into Gareth Southgate\u2019s reign, the question remains unanswered: are England actually any good?\nTo which there are probably two answers. The first is simple: yes, reasonably. They finished top of their group. They were joint top-scorers alongside Spain. They kept two clean sheets. The second is a weary sigh as any discussion of England is immediately submerged by hackneyed debates about arrogance and expectation, set against a backdrop of implausible ideals of breezy attacking perfection. What even is good?\nBelgium, their golden generation well and truly past it, were dreadful at this World Cup. They scored one goal, were outplayed in two of their three games and looked utterly fed up in the third. As Roberto Mart\u00ednez tearfully announced he would not be staying on as manager, batting away questions from the media that ranged from gently disappointed to nakedly antagonistic, the temptation for an outsider was to wonder just what people expect.\n\nAt the 2018 World Cup, Belgium played superbly to beat Brazil in the quarter-final before losing to the eventual champions, France. At Euro 2020, with Kevin De Bruyne struggling with injury, they lost their quarter-final to the eventual champions, Italy. If that is failure, very few people in any walk of life have ever been anything else. This may have been an extraordinarily gifted generation, but other countries have good players too.\nFor Southgate, then, is anything short of winning the World Cup failure? Perhaps not even that would be enough. Although Alf Ramsey, the one England manager to win something, was hailed in the moment, it wasn\u2019t long before he was being blamed for ushering in a culture of negativity, the radicalism of his approach overlooked or unrecognised; reticent and repressed he may have been, but Ramsey was a revolutionary nonetheless.\nSouthgate\u2019s record far outstrips every England coach since. He has taken England to two of the six semi-finals they have reached. He is responsible for five of their 14 victories in knockout games at major tournaments. Yet still the mood since the Euros final has been grouchy. He\u2019s too negative. He has to take the handbrake off. He has to unleash this great glut of forwards. Why, oh why, oh why is there no place for [insert name of Premier League creator du jour here]? History will look back and ask why [delete as appropriate: Phil Foden/Marcus Rashford/Jack Grealish/Mason Mount/Bukayo Saka] was left on the bench.\n\nIt\u2019s all nonsense, of course. Major tournaments are short. Freakish things happen. Far too much is read into individual games. For years Germany got to semis and beyond largely by dint of being German. Then, 20 years ago, they decided they actually wanted to be good at football as well. They created the dominant way of thinking about the game and yet have gone out in the group stage in the last two tournaments.\nIn Qatar they were so befuddled their hopes came down to Niclas F\u00fcllkrug, a journeyman striker apparently selected because he was the nearest thing anybody could find in the modern Bundesliga to Horst Hrubesch. It\u2019s not ill luck, Hansi Flick said, it\u2019s inability. Well, perhaps, but it was also ill luck. Should the whole Reboot be rethought for the sake of eight minutes of weirdness against Japan \u2013 in which they conceded twice \u2013 that ended up mattering only because Spain had three minutes of weirdness against Japan in which they conceded twice?\n\nIt is often asked before tournaments what would represent success. A semi-final? A quarter-final? But that\u2019s an inadequate metric. A team can play appallingly and go deep thanks to good fortune and a kind draw. Or a team can play brilliantly, delight the world, yet be defeated early in a classic against another great side, or be undone by bad luck, or implode. Denmark of 1986, all mullets and attacking vigour, linger in the consciousness as one of the great World Cup sides; the England of 2006, a sad gloop of barely distinguishable games overshadowed by the hedonism of Baden-Baden, do not: yet that England went further in the competition.\nYet after the penalty shootout defeats of 1990, 1996 and 1998, there has been a sense that England were done with heroic failure. Give us a trophy and never mind how. In that context \u2018good\u2019 is probably too vague a term. Do England look like they could win the tournament? Perhaps, but these things are best judged in retrospect. There are exceptions \u2013 Spain in 2010, despite their opening defeat, or West Germany in 1990, maybe Brazil in 2002 if only because of the haste with which rivals fell away \u2013 but few World Cup winners have looked like champions all the way. \nFour years ago, France needed their wobble against Argentina; four years before that, it took the near loss against Algeria and Jogi L\u00f6w\u2019s contemplative run along the beach in Rio to set Germany on the path to glory; in 2006, Italy only seemed credible contenders after their two extra-time goals against Germany in the semi-final.\n\nGroups are for getting through but, for what it\u2019s worth, England had a better group-stage record than any winner since Brazil 20 years ago. There are positive signs. Harry Maguire may have become a term of ridicule in the Ghanaian parliament but his partnership with John Stones has looked a lot more secure than was feared. Southgate has often failed to made decisive changes during games but against the USA and Wales his tweaks had a positive impact. England have often been over-reliant on Harry Kane to score goals but in Qatar they have had six different scorers, none of them Kane \u2013 who has nonetheless played a key role with three assists.\nBrazil, Spain and France have all produced periods of football that seem beyond anything England are capable of, but they have all had dips as well. Argentina, fuelled almost entirely by the Lionel Messi narrative, have spluttered, only really getting going against a supine Poland. The Netherlands seem still to be waiting for Memphis Depay to recover fitness. Portugal plod on in the unmoving shadow of Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s ego, aided by a couple of odd penalties. Croatia, by their manager Zlatko Dalic\u2019s assessment after the 0-0 draw against Belgium, are finally \u201cexhausted\u201d.\nBut the truth is that any of the sides in the last 16 could beat England, and England could beat any of the sides in the last 16. Given Southgate\u2019s preference for a back three when he envisages a battle for possession, England probably haven\u2019t even yet played the shape they will use against the best opponents.\nAre they any good? It\u2019s far too early to tell \u2013 and may be for some time."

                    "body": "Lionel Messi will not retire immediately from international football after finally capping an extraordinary career with Argentina\u2019s first World Cup since 1986, preferring to soak up the glory for at least a while longer.\nOn a dizzying night in Lusail it seemed more than once that Messi could be denied the fulfilment of a lifelong dream at the fifth attempt. But he added to his two goals and virtuoso all-round performance in regulation time with a penalty during a successful shootout against France and afterwards confirmed his 172nd cap was not his last.\n\n\u201cObviously I wanted to complete my career with this \u2013 I can\u2019t ask for more,\u201d he said. \u201cFinishing my career this way is impressive. After this, what else? I have a Copa Am\u00e9rica, a World Cup, almost at the very end.\n\u201cI love football, what I do. I enjoy being part of the national team, the group. I want to enjoy a couple more matches being a world champion.\u201d\nMessi has previously claimed Qatar 2022 would be his last World Cup and there is no indication he will continue beyond the short-to-medium term. But his manager, Lionel Scaloni, made clear the door would be open in three and a half years\u2019 time if he made himself available for the 2026 edition. Messi will turn 39 during that tournament, which will take place in the US, Canada and Mexico.\n\u201cWe need to save him a spot for the [next] World Cup,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he wants to keep playing, he will be with us. He is more than entitled to decide if he wants to keep playing and what he wants to do with his career. It is such a huge pleasure to coach him. Everything he transmits to his teammates is something unparalleled that I have never seen before.\u201d\n\nScaloni, who was visibly emotional at points of his post-match press conference, said positivity was key to Argentina\u2019s recoveries when they were twice pulled back from the brink of victory. He also hailed the self-confidence of his goalkeeper, Emiliano Mart\u00ednez, who saved Kingsley Coman\u2019s spot kick.\n\u201cI told them we had to be optimistic, that is the main thing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe knew if we played our game we were going to create chances, going on the attack. In the shootout it was the same thing; we had to remain calm [even though] before it we conceded another goal. Emiliano is a very positive guy and told his teammates he was going to save some penalties. We had so many players who were ready and willing to take them and it shows the trust we have.\u201d\nAt times Scaloni\u2019s players seemed spurred by a supernatural fervour. \u201cThis squad played for the Argentina flag,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone is pulling for the whole country. This is the greatest pride. The players broke their backs because they understood what they had to do.\u201d\nScaloni and Mart\u00ednez admitted Argentina had \u201csuffered\u201d, although the goalkeeper said he had been \u201ccalm\u201d when facing France\u2019s penalties. Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni also dragged a spot kick wide.\nArgentina headed to an organised parade along Lusail Boulevard, adjacent to the venue of their success, two hours after full-time and Scaloni said he would be \u201copen to what the players have to say\u201d about further celebrations in their home country, where they are certain to be received ecstatically."

                    "body": "Reece James could miss the World Cup after damaging knee ligaments against Milan, handing England a selection crisis at right wing-back, and Chelsea are also worried N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 will be out of action for the rest of the year.\nGraham Potter was unable to deliver much positivity before Chelsea\u2019s trip to Aston Villa on Sunday. Potter reported that the France centre-back Wesley Fofana was unlikely to feature before the World Cup, said that it was \u201cnot good news\u201d on Kant\u00e9\u2019s recovery from a hamstring injury and confirmed that James would visit a specialist this weekend to determine whether he requires knee surgery.\n\nThe initial signs were that James, who went off during Chelsea\u2019s 2-0 win at Milan on Tuesday, had not sustained serious damage. The 22-year-old, who has been in outstanding form for club and country this season, took an EasyJet flight back from Italy on Wednesday night and was understood to be hopeful of making a swift return to action.\nHowever James received bad news when he underwent a scan in London on Thursday. The tests revealed that he had damaged ligaments and could be out for six to eight weeks, which would give him little chance of being ready in time for the beginning of the World Cup. James was in line to start in England\u2019s opening group game against Iran on 21 November.\n\u201cHe is due to see a specialist over the weekend,\u201d Potter said. \u201cUntil we get that information, there\u2019s not too much I can add. We will wait and see. He spoke yesterday and felt not too bad. But until you get these things checked, you never know.\u201d\nLosing James, who started England\u2019s Nations League games against Germany and Italy last month, would be a major blow for Gareth Southgate. England\u2019s manager usually has an embarrassment of riches at right-back but injuries are threatening to ruin his plans.\nManchester City\u2019s Kyle Walker, who is an option at right centre-back and right-back, could miss the tournament after undergoing groin surgery last week. Liverpool\u2019s Trent Alexander-Arnold has an ankle injury and James\u2019s potential unavailability could force Southgate to start Kieran Trippier at right wing-back. The injuries could give Southampton\u2019s Kyle Walker-Peters a chance of going to Qatar, although a 26-man squad will give Southgate the opportunity to pick James if he looks likely to return to fitness after the group stage.\nEngland are not the only country with worries over key players. Kant\u00e9 has not played since sustaining a hamstring injury during Chelsea\u2019s 2-2 draw with Tottenham on 14 August and the France midfielder suffered a setback in his recovery last weekend. \u201cHe\u2019s due to see a consultant this weekend,\u201d Potter said. \u201cIt\u2019s not good news.\u201d\n\nKant\u00e9\u2019s hopes of featuring in Qatar look slim and the 31-year-old\u2019s long-standing injury problems could affect his hopes of extending his Chelsea contract beyond this season.\nFrance could also be without Fofana after the \u00a369.5m defender injured a knee during this month\u2019s 3-0 win over Milan at Stamford Bridge. \u201cI don\u2019t think we will see him before the World Cup,\u201d Potter said.\nChelsea, who remain hugely interested in Rafael Le\u00e3o after failing to sign the Milan winger last summer, have agreed a deal to appoint Southampton\u2019s Joe Shields as their co-director of recruitment. Shields joined Southampton from Manchester City only in July and is expected to go on gardening leave before beginning his new role.\nChelsea\u2019s owners, Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital, are restructuring their recruitment department. They are close to appointing Christopher Vivell as technical director, but it is believed that they are moving away from plans to appoint a sporting director. Instead it appears that they are looking to build their recruitment team by making several more hires. It is understood that Norwich\u2019s Stuart Webber is not under serious consideration for a role at the moment."

                    "body": "Chelsea are planning a fresh move for Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez after previously failing to agree a deal for the Benfica midfielder. His contract contains a \u00a3106m release clause and Benfica remain reluctant to sell the Argentina international for a lower fee. Chelsea tried to pay less during negotiations at the start of the window and ended up switching focus to other targets. Graham Potter wants midfield reinforcements and Chelsea, who are spending heavily under their latest ownership, had a \u00a355m bid for Brighton\u2019s Mois\u00e9s Caicedo rejected last week. An improved offer for the Ecuador international remains a possibility, with Brighton scouring the market for potential replacements for the 21-year-old.  However, Fern\u00e1ndez, who played a key role in Argentina winning the World Cup last month, remains an option for Chelsea. Sources have indicated talks are due to resume this week. Benfica, who are in the last 16 of the Champions League, want to keep Fern\u00e1ndez,who has repeatedly told them that he wants to join Chelsea, until the end of the season. Chelsea have other midfielders in their sights, including Brighton\u2019s Alexis Mac Allister. They have spent about \u00a3460m on 15 players since being bought by Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital,. Chelsea are crying out for fresh legs in central midfield. Jorginho could leave on a free this summer, and although N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 is expected to extend his deal before it expires at the end of the season, the Frenchman has been out with a hamstring injury since August. Chelsea are also expected to challenge for Declan Rice in the summer but Arsenal are emerging as favourites to sign the West Ham captain. Liverpool, Manchester City and Real Madrid are seen as likelier destinations for Borussia Dortmund\u2019s Jude Bellingham. Boehly and Clearlake have been highly active in the transfer market. This month they have made the permanent additions of Andrey Santos, Beno\u00eet Badiashile, Mykhailo Mudryk and Noni Madueke and the loan signing of Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix. Potter has warned that Chelsea\u2019s squad must not become bloated. Sales of fringe players would be welcome. Everton are one of the clubs interested in the Morocco winger Hakim Ziyech. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has been linked with a swift return to Barcelona. Chelsea are also in the market for a right-back to provide cover for Reece James, who is close to returning from a knee injury. A bid for the 19-year-old Lyon defender Malo Gusto has been rejected by the French club, who do not want to sell.  Arsenal have confirmed the signing of the centre-half Jakub Kiwior from Spezia in a \u20ac25m (\u00a322m) deal. The Poland international was described by Mikel Arteta as a \u201cversatile defender who has shown huge potential\u201d. The 22-year-old started all four of his country\u2019s matches at the World Cup in Qatar. He is Arsenal\u2019s second signing of the window, after the forward Leandro Trossard. Manchester City have announced the arrival of the Argentinian midfielder Maximo Perrone from V\u00e9lez Sarsfield for about \u00a38m. The 20-year-old made his V\u00e9lez debut last March and leaves after scoring three goals and making two assists in 33 games."

                    "body": "Good morning. Elon Musk has announced a general amnesty for suspended Twitter accounts in a move that brought a warning that \u201csuperspreaders of hate\u201d will return to the social media platform. Twitter\u2019s new owner said an amnesty for blocked users would begin next week after a majority of votes in a poll on his account backed the move. Accounts suspended on Twitter include Donald Trump\u2019s former adviser Steve Bannon, the rightwing UK commentator Katie Hopkins and David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard. Musk launched a poll on Wednesday asking if a general amnesty should be offered to accounts provided they have not \u201cbroken the law or engaged in egregious spam\u201d. Musk did not specify which laws he meant. More than 3.1m votes were recorded by the poll, with 72% in favour of an amnesty.  \u2018The people have spoken\u2019. Announcing the result, Musk tweeted: \u201cVox Populi, Vox Dei\u201d, a Latin phrase meaning \u201cthe voice of the people [is] the voice of God.\u201d It came days after he reinstated Donald Trump\u2019s account as well as the accounts of Jordan Peterson and Andrew Tate, and unlocked Kanye West\u2019s.  Joe Biden renews call for assault weapons ban after latest mass shootings  Joe Biden has reiterated his calls to ban assault weapons after mass shootings at a gay nightclub in Colorado Springs on Saturday and a Walmart in Chesapeake, Virginia, on Tuesday left 11 people dead. While visiting a firehouse on Nantucket Island, Massachusetts, to thank first responders on Thanksgiving, Biden told reporters he would attempt to pass some form of gun control before a new Congress is seated in January, possibly renewing his attempt to ban assault weapons. \u201cThe idea we still allow semi-automatic weapons to be purchased is sick. It\u2019s just sick. It has no, no social redeeming value, zero, none. Not a single solitary rationale for it except profits for gun manufacturers,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI\u2019m going to try. I\u2019m going to try to get rid of assault weapons.\u201d  There have been more than 600 mass shootings so far this year across the US. That\u2019s according to the Gun Violence Archive, using the definition of four or more shot or killed, not including the shooter.  Top Iran footballer arrested at club for \u2018spreading propaganda against the state\u2019  Iranian security forces arrested one of the country\u2019s most famous footballers on Thursday, accusing him of spreading propaganda against the Islamic republic and seeking to undermine the national World Cup team. Voria Ghafouri, a former member of the national football team and once a captain of the Tehran club Esteghlal, has been outspoken in his defence of Iranian Kurds, telling the government on social media to stop killing Kurdish people. He has previously been detained for criticising the former Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif. The Iranian team has already been warned of reprisals after refusing to sing the national anthem before their game against England four days ago, and Ghafouri\u2019s arrest is likely to be seen as a warning to the players not to repeat their protests. Iran\u2019s players sang their national anthem before Friday\u2019s World Cup game against Wales. There was again heavy booing and whistling of the anthem by Iran supporters inside the stadium in Qatar and some fans could be seen crying.  Arrested after football training. Ghafouri was detained after a training session with his club, Foolad Khuzestan, on charges of having \u201ctarnished the reputation of the national team and spread propaganda against the state\u201d, the Fars news agency said.  In other news \u2026   France has moved a step closer to becoming the first country in the world to enshrine abortion as a constitutional right, after lawmakers approved a resolution in the lower house to guarantee access to \u201cthe right to voluntarily end a pregnancy\u201d. An Algerian court has sentenced 49 people to death for the brutal mob killing of a painter who was suspected of starting devastating wildfires but had actually come to help fight them, according to lawyers and state news. A small island school in New Zealand recently ran a competition encouraging children to catch and kill hundreds of rats in an effort to preserve the island\u2019s birdlife. Forty students caught more than 600 rats over the 100-day challenge. Deliberate starvation tactics used by South Sudan government forces and allied militia, and by opposition forces, are driving civilians out of their homes, exacerbating Africa\u2019s largest refugee crisis, according to a report.  World Cup: US to face England later today  After four games on Thursday \u2013 including a convincing win for five-time champions Brazil \u2013 all 32 teams at this year\u2019s tournament have now played. They\u2019ve only played one game each but, based on that limited evidence, Spain, France, England and Brazil look like the teams to beat. But there are plenty of examples of teams getting off to good starts before coming horribly unstuck in the knockout rounds. Despite plenty of negative attention over off-field issues in Qatar, Fifa reported that TV viewing figures for this year\u2019s opening game were up on the same fixture at the 2018 World Cup. One note of caution: Russia 2018 started on a Thursday, while Qatar 2022\u2019s first game was on a Sunday (for most parts of the world) when fewer people were at work. Elsewhere at the World Cup:  No doubt about the biggest match of the day on Friday: the US take on England. The US actually have a pretty good record against England at the World Cup: they drew with the Three Lions in 2010 and beat them in 1950, in one of the biggest upsets in the tournament\u2019s history. Today\u2019s match kicks off at 2pm ET and you can follow it with our liveblog here. The hosts try to get their first points \u2013 and goals \u2013 of the World Cup after a convincing defeat to Ecuador in their opener. They have invested millions in player development since winning the right to host the tournament but they struggled badly against Ecuador. Senegal, one of the best teams in Africa, will be an equally stern test when the teams kick off at 8am ET. Colorblind fans suffered through Switzerland and Cameroon\u2019s match on Thursday. Both teams wore their home jerseys, red and green respectively, even though Fifa dictates such clashes should be avoided. Research by Colour Blind Awareness showed that 6% of elite male players are colourblind, meaning there\u2019s a good chance one of the players on the pitch may have been at a disadvantage.  Stat of the day: record heat over Great Barrier Reef raises fears of second summer of coral bleaching  Ocean temperatures over parts of the Great Barrier Reef have reached record levels this month, prompting fears of a second summer in a row of mass coral bleaching. Data from the US government\u2019s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) shows sea surface temperatures over the northern parts of the reef have been the highest for any November on a record going back to 1985. With the peak period for accumulated heat over the reef not expected until February, cooler weather conditions and cyclone activity before then could stave off a mass bleaching event. Prof Terry Hughes, a leading expert on coral bleaching at James Cook University in Australia, said he had never seen heat stress accumulating on the reef this early, but a \u201cwell-timed cyclone\u201d in December could reduce the risk of bleaching. Don\u2019t miss this: the row in Paris over rented e-scooters  Paris is considering a ban on rented electric scooters, warning that its fleet of 15,000 for-hire scooters presents safety concerns, is stressing pedestrians, clogs up city streets and is yet to prove its positive impact on the environment, Angelique Chrisafis writes. Last week, Maud Gatel, a centrist MoDem party councillor, told a Paris council meeting that rental e-scooters had turned the city into a \u201cjungle\u201d where \u201cpedestrians are afraid to cross a street or even walk along the pavement\u201d. But Nicolas Gorse, the chief business officer of the operator Dott, said Paris\u2019s \u201cmassively regulated market\u201d was the most organised in the world. \u201cThere is no other city where you have 2,500 micro-mobility parking spots \u2013 there is one every 200 metres in Paris.\u201d Climate check: more than 20,000 died in western Europe\u2019s summer heatwaves, figures show  More than 20,000 people died across western Europe in this summer\u2019s heatwaves, in temperatures that would have been virtually impossible without climate breakdown, figures show. Analysis of excess deaths, the difference between the number of deaths that happened and those expected based on historical trends, reveals the threats posed by climate change-induced global heating, scientists said. During the summer heatwaves temperatures exceeded 40C (104F) in London, areas in south-west France reached 42C and Seville and C\u00f3rdoba in Spain set records of 44C. Analysis from the World Weather Attribution group of scientists found that such high temperatures would have been \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d without the climate crisis, Sandra Laville writes. Last Thing: morale the key in Kyiv as winter sets in  Russia has used the iconography of the second world war to maintain Russian public support for the invasion, writes Julian Borger. Ukrainians are quick to point out that ultimately victorious struggle is their legacy, too, and they draw from it lessons in resilience. \u201cWe are Ukrainians. We\u2019re strong and we can get through this,\u201d said Angelina Anatolieva, a 50-year-old Pecherskyi resident. \u201cDo you remember the siege of Leningrad? They lived through that and we can live through this. We can live through anything.\u201d Sign up  First Thing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.

He has publicly been coy about his future and the potential for a bargain has alerted several of the Premier League\u2019s top clubs, who have long tracked his role in Brentford\u2019s rise to eighth in the division.\n\nSpurs, in particular, need a successor to the 36-year-old Hugo Lloris while United have not yet secured fresh terms with David de Gea, whose current deal has five months to run.\nChelsea have their own conundrums to solve: \u00c9douard Mendy is yet to agree a contract extension while Kepa Arrizabalaga\u2019s long-term status remains uncertain. Raya\u2019s capacity to distribute the ball from the back has few parallels in the top flight and his potential availability is attractive to all three clubs, who have all enquired about the player\u2019s situation.\n\nArsenal showed firm interest in signing Raya in 2020 but Brentford rejected multiple bids of around \u00a310m and eventually the league leaders moved on.\nRaya signed a new deal at Brentford, who were subsequently promoted from the Championship, and his potential sale value increased significantly. The keeper who began his professional career at Blackburn has since become a full international for Spain. There has been little indication he will further extend his commitment to Thomas Frank\u2019s side and a battle for his services is likely at the end of the campaign.\nOne potential replacement for Raya at Brentford is the QPR goalkeeper, Seny Dieng, whose contract runs until 2024. The Senegal international, who was part of the World Cup squad in Qatar, is also being monitored by Spurs and Brighton.\nAdditional reporting by Will Unwin"

                    "body": "Richarlison\u2019s \u201cballetic barnstormer\u201d has been called one of the great World Cup goals; an unstoppable scissor kick that launched Brazil\u2019s campaign in Qatar with a bang. But after his thrilling two-goal blitz against Serbia, the Tottenham forward is being celebrated as much more than just a sporting hero. Brazilian fans, pundits and politicians lined up to hail Richarlison as a paragon of human decency, compassion and good sense after four gruelling years in which Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s far-right government divided society, wrecked the environment and mishandled a Covid outbreak that killed nearly 700,000 citizens. \u201cRicharlison is the idol Brazilians deserve after so much suffering,\u201d the sports journalist Talyta Vespa wrote on Friday in one of many tributes to the player\u2019s off-field activism and charity work. Richarlison \u2013 or the Pigeon, as fans know him, thanks to his avian-style celebrations \u2013 is by far the most progressive member of Brazil\u2019s sele\u00e7\u00e3o. In recent years, as his homeland fell under the control of Bolsonaro\u2019s far-right administration, Richarlison has repeatedly spoken out on topics such as racism, poverty, police and gender violence, LGBTQ+ rights and environmental destruction.  He questioned how Brazil\u2019s yellow jersey had been dragged into the country\u2019s political dispute, and adopted a jaguar to highlight the threats to Brazil\u2019s Pantanal wetlands.  When the British journalist Dom Phillips and Brazilian Indigenous expert Bruno Pereira vanished in the Amazon in June, Richarlison was one of the first celebrities to champion the campaign to try to find them. \u201cOn top of everything, he\u2019s sensitive and committed to Brazil,\u201d Pereira\u2019s widow, Beatriz Matos, tweeted at the player on Friday. During Brazil\u2019s devastating coronavirus emergency \u2013 which Bolsonaro called a \u201clittle flu\u201d \u2013 Richarlison publicly backed vaccination efforts that the science-denying president had actively undermined. \u201cHe\u2019s not only a star on the pitch, he\u2019s a star off it too,\u201d said the favela activist Rene Silva, remembering how Richarlison donated oxygen cylinders to the Amazon city of Manaus when its healthcare system buckled during the pandemic. Juca Kfouri, one of Brazil\u2019s top football writers, said the outpouring of adoration for Richarlison, while perhaps slightly excessive, reflected how millions of progressive fans were desperate to fall back in love with a team that many had grown profoundly disillusioned with. Particularly to blame for that estrangement was Neymar, who alienated millions of progressive Brazilians by supporting Bolsonaro\u2019s failed re-election bid and then promising to dedicate his first World Cup goal to him. Other players, including the defender Dani Alves, have also backed Bolsonaro, who lost October\u2019s election to the former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva. \u201cRicharlison represents a more loving, more affectionate side to the Brazilian sele\u00e7\u00e3o,\u201d said Kfouri. \u201cHe\u2019s seen as being a citizen who actually cares about Brazil.\u201d Bolsonaro has fallen silent since losing last month\u2019s election and has said nothing of Brazil\u2019s triumph in Qatar. Leftwing politicians, in contrast, were united in their commemoration of Richarlison and his teammate Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior, who helped create Thursday\u2019s sensational goal and has also been outspoken on issues such as racism. \u201cMuch more than a great player, Richarlison is a model citizen,\u201d tweeted the Worker\u2019s party politician Paulo Pimenta. Writing in the black website Alma Preta, the journalist Pedro Borges described the state of ecstasy he had found himself in after watching Richarlison and Vin\u00edcius shine. He wrote: \u201cNot just because of Brazil\u2019s victory \u2026 [but] because the standout players were black athletes who respect our history, who didn\u2019t ignore the suffering of the people and who understand the role they have in our country.\u201d Rene Silva said Richarlison\u2019s off-field endeavours, which also include helping cancer patients, made him an inspiration to children and teens. \u201cHe is a Brazilian idol,\u201d Silva said. \u201cAfter everything we have been through, this was a moment of hope.\u201d"

                    "body": "This article is part of the Guardian\u2019s World Cup 2022 Experts\u2019 Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 32 countries who qualified. theguardian.com is running previews from two countries each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 20 November.\nThe plan\nIt is hard not to conclude that it is now or never for Gareth Southgate\u2019s England. They have come agonisingly close under the 52-year-old, reaching the semi-finals of the last World Cup and losing to Italy on penalties in the Euro 2020 final, and if those near misses are viewed through an optimistic lens there is an argument that glory is attainable if the pieces all fall in the right place.\nAfter all, while recent form has been unconvincing, this remains a highly talented group. The creative options are enviable and Declan Rice and Jude Bellingham are two of the finest young midfielders around. Harry Kane is one of the best strikers in the world.\nStill, though, the sense persists that a cycle is coming to an end. Problems have mounted this year \u2013 the barren Nations League run, Harry Maguire\u2019s struggles, injuries to Reece James (the Chelsea player has been ruled out) and Kyle Walker a headache on the right side of the defence \u2013 and it could well be time for Southgate to depart, even if his deal runs until the end of 2024. \u201cI know I will be judged on what happens at that World Cup,\u201d the head coach says. \u201cI am not arrogant enough to think that my contract is going to protect me.\u201d\n\nSouthgate accepts the defining moment is approaching. England are under pressure to attack. There will be fury if they limp out in timid fashion.\nBut do not write off this squad yet. There were signs of life during the recent 3-3 draw with Germany and a group containing Iran, Wales and the USA should be negotiated with relative ease. In Southgate\u2019s view some of the panic is overblown. He has proven that he is tournament savvy and, given a fair wind, England have the potential to go all the way.\n\nThe coach\nIs Gareth Southgate too negative? What\u2019s his problem with Trent Alexander-Arnold? Is he \u2026 a woke fraud? Or is he actually the manager who lifted England off the floor, made the waistcoat fashionable, offered moral authority on a range of difficult topics and almost ended 55 years of hurt? As ever there are shades of grey. Southgate is not perfect, he can be too cautious and a lot of fans have turned on him. But he has done a good job overall and still commands the respect of the dressing room. Even the boo-boys must admit Southgate could still be The One.\nStar player\nMuch will rest on Harry Kane\u2019s level. The captain has enjoyed a long injury-free run and been in goalscoring form for Tottenham. England will hope he is in tip-top shape. Working with a new physio has strengthened Kane\u2019s body and an added motivation for the 29-year-old is that he is two behind Wayne Rooney\u2019s record of 53 goals for England. It would be a surprise if Kane doesn\u2019t overtake Rooney in Qatar.\n\nUnsung hero\nDeclan Rice is a mandatory pick. The West Ham captain lets others play and his knack of being in the right place at the right time is an invaluable defensive asset for England. This defence cannot afford to be without Rice\u2019s protection. His ball-winning abilities are second to none, while his positional discipline should allow Bellingham to push forward. Throw in an efficient passing range and it is clear to see why Southgate has come to rely on Rice.\nProbable lineup\n\nQatar stance\nThe Football Association has vowed to lobby Fifa on creating new labour laws in the gulf state, has called for any worker injury or death to be compensated and will push for a Migrant Workers\u2019 Centre to be created in Qatar. However there have been no condemnatory statements from Southgate or Kane. Jordan Henderson called Qatar\u2019s human rights record \u201cshocking, disappointing and horrendous\u201d after he and his fellow players received a detailed briefing on the situation. But any visible protest during the tournament is likely to be limited to Kane wearing a rainbow-coloured \u201cOneLove\u201d captain\u2019s armband.\nNational anthem\nIt does what it says on the tin. The origins of the lyrics and the tune are unknown, other than the fact they date back to the 17th century, but everyone knows the meaning. The only thing to be aware of this time is a slight tweak in the wording: following the death of the Queen in September the players will have to remember to sing \u201cGod Save The King\u201d instead. It\u2019s the best way of ensuring King Charles sends them victorious.\nAll-time cult hero\nIt\u2019s been 32 years since Paul Gascoigne broke down in tears in Turin. The midfielder captured the imagination during Italia 90 and he could not hide his devastation when he was cautioned during England\u2019s semi-final defeat to Germany. The booking would have ruled Gazza out of the final and his inconsolable reaction made people warm to him. He was that rare thing, a maverick talent who actually became a force for England, and nothing demonstrated his ability more than his stunning volley against Scotland at Euro 96. If only his studs had been longer when England lost to Germany in the last four again \u2026\nJacob Steinberg writes for the Guardian. Follow him here on Twitter."

                    "body": "How\u2019s your voice this morning? And your head? Your nerves? The answers are probably, in order: shredded, throbbing and frayed. After an evening of almost obscene tension, England were knocked out of the 2022 World Cup by the reigning champions, France, 2-1. It was a familiar ending for the England men\u2019s team, but how they arrived at that dispiriting point all felt rather different. At the final whistle, as the England players collapsed on the turf of the Al Bayt Stadium in Qatar, home fans at the Wood House pub in south-east London gave them a standing ovation. England had dominated the play and the defeat, while crushing, was also hopeful.  \u201cEveryone knows that was a great performance,\u201d said Will Pethybridge, one of the locals. \u201cWe\u2019ll get the rub of the green one of these days. That\u2019s why people here aren\u2019t angry and aggressive. No one\u2019s going to be going out and smashing up a Citro\u00ebn tonight!\u201d Before the match, the optimism was irresistible. Morocco\u2019s shock victory in the afternoon match against Portugal made it feel that whichever team prevailed in the England-France game would be heavy tournament favourites. Nigel Roberts, another Wood House regular, looking around the pub as the fervour built, added: \u201cGod knows what\u2019ll happen if we get to the final.\u201d The match had even piqued the interest of England fans who had previously not been exactly feeling the Qatar World Cup. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in this particular tournament \u2013 for moral reasons, gay rights,\u201d said Justine Ellis. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve just put the Christmas tree up today. It shouldn\u2019t be happening now!\u201d  So why watch this match? \u201cI\u2019m more interested in being festive than patriotic,\u201d replied Ellis. \u201cI like Gareth Southgate. I like the team, who they are, what they stand for.\u201d The match started and the heady vibes were soon punctured \u2013 after 17 minutes to be exact, when French midfielder Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni lasered a shot into the bottom corner. The boisterous crowd at the Wood House fell uncomfortably silent. It was broken by one fan: \u201cFuck the French!\u201d Then some strained laughs. There were not many French fans to be found, at least in this corner of London. And France are harder to demonise (at least on a football field) than time-honoured foes Germany, Argentina or Portugal. In the Wood House, Marie-Pierre Denaro, a teacher from Paris who moved to London 24 years ago, was not taking any chances. \u201cI\u2019m feeling I\u2019m not going to tell anyone I\u2019m French,\u201d she admitted, as the first half progressed. When, after 24 minutes, a VAR appeal for a penalty after Harry Kane goes down is rejected, the boos are loud and long. \u201cI think the England fans are going to start blaming it on the ref,\u201d said Denaro, keeping her voice low. There were warmer feelings towards the referee, Brazilian Wilton Sampaio, after 52 minutes, when he did award a spot kick for a foul on Bukayo Saka. Kane buried it, and the Wood House descended into end-of-days delirium. People didn\u2019t throw their pints in the air \u2013 this isn\u2019t the Boxpark Croydon after all. And besides, they were in proper glasses so it might have hurt when they landed.  The tension escalated uncomfortably throughout the second half. Then on 77 minutes, France\u2019s Olivier Giroud won the clash-of-the-foreheads battle with Harry Maguire and got his frosted tips on a cross to send France into a 2-1 lead. The energy was sucked out of the room like a vortex had opened up. But then, a second penalty for England. By now, Sampaio was starting to find himself on a lot more Christmas card lists. \u201cI can\u2019t watch,\u201d said a lot of grown adults in the Wood House. It was probably better not to: Kane blasted it over the bar. The stricken groans from the few who didn\u2019t avert their eyes told you everything. Of course, there was one final twist. In the 99th minute, Marcus Rashford stood over a free kick. Destiny awaited England\u2019s Robin Hood, but his shot sailed just over the bar. \u201cI feel happy,\u201d said Denaro, the French fan, slipping away from the pub. And perversely, when the dust settles, many England supporters will feel, maybe not exactly that, but less distraught than usual."

                    "body": "Gareth Southgate will blast away the negativity surrounding England by telling his players they can make this the best period in the team\u2019s history by winning the World Cup.\nEngland\u2019s 26-man squad fly to Qatar on Tuesday as one of the favourites but recent performances have cast doubt over their chances. They faced heavy criticism after toiling in the Nations League this year and a series of stodgy attacking performances has increased the pressure on Southgate, who was booed by supporters after September\u2019s 1-0 defeat in Italy.\nHowever the head coach, who was also jeered by supporters after his side\u2019s 4-0 defeat by Hungary at Molineux in June, is determined to keep the mood positive. England\u2019s recent tournament efforts \u2013 runs to the semi-finals of the 2018 World Cup and the final of the 2020 European Championship \u2013 are prominent in Southgate\u2019s thinking. He also saw England\u2019s women become European champions in July \u2013 the country\u2019s first major trophy since the men won the World Cup in 1966.\n\n\u201cWith the players we want to talk to them about the excitement of going to a World Cup,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cWe understand the need to comment on the off-field things that surround this tournament, but we want the players to feel that enthusiasm that they\u2019ve had since kids.\n\u201cWe want to fuel that. The first couple of days we won\u2019t be on the training pitch, bar a couple [of players] that will need to do something. We want them to transition from a hectic club schedule to thinking about England. We want to talk to them about the fact that this, whatever happens over the next four weeks, has been the second-best period for English football. We can make it the best.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the challenge mindset. How can we take the supporters on another journey, like the one they loved four years ago and loved last summer? That\u2019s why we do it and that\u2019s what makes playing for England special.\u201d\nSouthgate, whose side play their first game in Group B against Iran a week tomorrow, does not see the recent backlash against him as relevant. \u201cI don\u2019t think what it was for me is important at this stage,\u201d he said.\n\u201cMy only focus is, how do I help this team to have a brilliant tournament? And I think we\u2019ve got a great chance. We\u2019ve perhaps, as we did before Russia, qualified and managed expectations at the same time.\n\u201cI know what this group of players have been capable of. They\u2019ve been to the deep reaches of tournaments. They know what that feels like. They know they can do that again. What people say or think about me is irrelevant. My job is to free the players of any of that.\u201d\nOne of the players who embodies joy and adventure is Jude Bellingham. The 19-year-old midfielder is expected to partner Declan Rice against Iran.\n\u201cHe has tremendous maturity for his age,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cMature in how he works, how he trains, how he speaks. He competes \u2013 it is probably the thing we love about him more than anything else. That has a line at times and undoubtedly there will be moments, while he is young, that it will be crossed. But he\u2019s a very exciting player and he\u2019s one we\u2019ve got a good body of experience into early.\n\n\u201cHe went to the Euros \u2013 we thought it was a good experience for him, but he wanted more. We were thinking for a 17-year-old: \u2018This is a really good transition.\u2019 But his mentality is: \u2018No, no, no.\u2019 He wants to start, he wants to take corners, he wants to captain the team.\u201d\nSouthgate remains mindful of the group staying clear of Covid. England will consider how to let players meet their families. \u201cWe\u2019re still a little bit fluid on that,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cWe almost prefer to under-promise and over-deliver. We would like it to happen, we think it is a significant part of a team feeling relaxed. But at the moment none of us know what the transmission rate is likely to be out there.\n\u201cFamilies are obviously going to be mixing in bigger numbers with people at the stadiums and things like that. We\u2019re going to have to track that. There might be ways of doing that more securely outside. We have some plans in place.\u201d\nSouthgate said England\u2019s training schedule this week could depend on the heat in Qatar. \u201cWe believe it won\u2019t be too severe,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that can vary and we have to assess because while a lot of our games are later, the first one isn\u2019t and we need some adaptation. We\u2019re north Europeans so we are not going to adapt totally to the environment. We have to manage that training schedule really carefully.\u201d"

Italy\u2019s Federica Brignone was 1.43sec off the pace for third.\n\nAfter collecting herself in the finish area, Shiffrin pumped her right fist to the crowd before shouting in elation and embracing Gut-Behrami and Brignone.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can add something,\u201d Shiffrin said in the immediate aftermath. \u201cIt might take me a little bit to figure out what to say. I have a new YouTube episode coming out tonight or tomorrow. I think it kind of explains my emotions.\u201d\nIt was Shiffrin\u2019s fifth opportunity to break Vonn\u2019s record since matching it earlier this month with a giant slalom win in Kranjska Gora, Slovenia. She was denied the mark by longtime rival Petra Vlhova in a slalom in Flauchau, Austria, before failing to reach the podium in two downhill races and one super-G over the weekend in Cortina d\u2019Ampezzo, Italy.\n\nBut on Tuesday, the four-time overall World Cup champion lay down the fastest first run, then held off all comers on her second attempt a few hours later after the course conditions had deteriorated. She has now won nine of her 20 starts on the season.\nShiffrin needs only three more wins to match Ingemark Stenmark\u2019s overall mark of 86 victories for men and women. That could happen before long. She has won nine races already this year with roughly a dozen to go before the season ends with the World Cup season final in March.\nStenmark, the great Swedish star of the 1970s and 80s, himself predicted last year that Shiffrin, who plans to ski at least through the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan and Cortina, will retire with more than 100 wins.\nOnce a teenage prodigy who became the youngest Olympic slalom champion in history at the 2014 Sochi Games, Shiffrin has since blossomed from a specialist into the world\u2019s best all-around skier. She has branched out into the speed events with success and become the only skier, male or female, to win World Cup races in all six disciplines: slalom, giant slalom, downhill, super-G, combined and parallel slalom."

Roughly divided by age, hundreds of young men play football until it gets dark or the tides of the Atlantic Ocean wash away their pitches and the discarded tyres being used as impromptu goalposts.\nIt only takes a few minutes of watching the dazzling array of skills on show to understand why Teranga Lions have won Africa\u2019s Beach Soccer Cup of Nations on seven of the past nine occasions, although it needed another penalty shootout victory over Egypt to claim their fourth successive title in October.\nIt is no accident that last season Senegal, with 51, was the African country with the highest number of players in the top five European leagues \u2013 a total that put them 10th on the global list. Thanks to the pathway provided by academies such as Dakar\u2019s G\u00e9n\u00e9ration Foot \u2013 which helped to produce Sadio Man\u00e9 and Isma\u00efla Sarr because of its links with the French club Metz \u2013 a country with a population of 17 million continues to punch above its weight.\nThe president, Macky Sall, awarded every player in Senegal\u2019s squad \u00a364,000 and two plots of land for their shootout victory against Egypt in the Africa Cup of Nations Cup final in February in recognition of their historic triumph. But Saer Seck, who set up the Diambars academy with the Crystal Palace manager Patrick Vieira in 2003, believes that achievement could be topped by beating England at the World Cup in Sunday\u2019s last-16 showdown. \u201cIt would be an earthquake,\u201d he says. \u201cThis a very big moment for the team and everyone is prepared to play the game of his life.\u201d\n\nDiambars, situated in Saly on Senegal\u2019s Petite C\u00f4te, is where Idrissa Gueye and Saliou Ciss began their careers before joining clubs in Europe. But with the team\u2019s talisman Man\u00e9 out of the tournament and the experienced defender Ciss not selected, Cheikhou Kouyat\u00e9 sidelined by a hamstring injury sustained against the Netherlands and Gueye suspended, the coach, Aliou Ciss\u00e9, will face England without four of the side that started against Egypt in Yaound\u00e9.\n\n\u201cWith Sadio it\u2019s another story,\u201d says Seck, a former vice-president of the Senegalese Football Association. \u201cThe team is no longer individuals because the strongest is not here, so we have to fight together to succeed. But each team has its own injuries so we can\u2019t cry about that. Against England we will be missing four players due to injuries and suspensions and they all have a lot of experience. So it\u2019s a different team but they will all be focused and ready to fight.\u201d\nIn Qatar, Ciss\u00e9 has been happy to allow El Hadji Diouf \u2013 a teammate from the side that famously reached the last eight at the 2002 World Cup \u2013 to do most of the talking. The former Liverpool forward is Sall\u2019s special adviser for sport as he targets becoming president of the Senegalese FA one day, although there is no doubt who calls the shots when it comes to the team.\n\u201cAliou has proved he is an excellent coach with very strong and solid knowledge of the game,\u201d says Seck. \u201cHe has been in football for more than 30 years and has been our manager since 2015. All his boys understand what he is telling them to do in preparation for the games. And this is enough to inspire them to follow him when they go on to the pitch. Having Aliou Ciss\u00e9 in charge of this team is one of our biggest strengths.\u201d\n\nKhalilou Fadiga, a former Bolton and Coventry winger and another member of the famous 2002 side who were defeated by Turkey after shocking the holders France in the opening match thanks to Papa Bouba Diop\u2019s winner, is also in Qatar to add his experience to the Senegal party. But could the ice-cool Ciss\u00e9, who captained that team before playing for Birmingham and Portsmouth in the Premier League, become the first African manager in the Premier League one day?\n\u201cIf you had one clever president in the Premier League I think that he could be a very good manager,\u201d says Seck. \u201cI\u2019ve been very close to him in the management of the national team for a long time so I know him very well and I\u2019m sure he has the ability to lead a very good project in club football. And I know that Aliou Ciss\u00e9 is prepared to go there and make it.\u201d\nFor now, Ciss\u00e9 has his sights set on making more history against England. After the victory in Seoul over their former colonial masters France 20 years ago Senegal\u2019s then president, Abdoulaye Wade, declared a national holiday and Seck is adamant that overcoming Gareth Southgate\u2019s side could have even more significance.\n\u201cThis would be more historic because it would mean a place in the quarter-finals,\u201d he says. \u201cI think that England are the favourites but the game is not yet over. We are talking about football and, in football, faith is very important. Our team has faith, courage and we will fight. It won\u2019t be easy for England \u2013 there\u2019s definitely a quiet confidence about our team. Let\u2019s see what happens but we will be ready to take our chance.\u201d"

                    "body": "It was never going to be easy. Then again, neither has the grinding pressure of being American soccer\u2019s chosen one. But when the right opportunity arrived, Christian Pulisic surrendered his body for his team and finally took hold of his signature moment on the international stage.\nWith the temperature of this geopolitical proxy war between the United States and Iran at the Middle East\u2019s first World Cup having risen to a boiling point, Pulisic turned the volume down with a goal the United States desperately had to have, making the difference in a tense and riveting win-or-go-home showdown for the Americans. When Sergi\u00f1o Dest directed a header toward goal off Weston McKennie\u2019s floated pass in the 38th minute, an onrushing Pulisic burst through a thicket of white shirts and struck home what proved to be the winner while barreling into the Iranian keeper. Pulisic then lay sprawled in the goalmouth for nearly four minutes.\nHe was taken to hospital at half-time with dizziness and to receive a precautionary abdominal scan. But once the US held off a heart-pounding Iranian onslaught late in the second half, sealing their progress to the knockout stage and a date with the Netherlands on Saturday, the fallen winger joined the rollicking locker-room celebration over FaceTime and was already back at the team hotel by the time they arrived. US Soccer later said Pulisic is \u201cday-to-day\u201d and had suffered a \u201cpelvic contusion\u201d.\n\n\u201cChristian makes those runs,\u201d USA manager Gregg Berhalter said after the game. \u201cThat\u2019s what he does. That\u2019s the special quality he has. As soon as the ball is wide, he goes in with intensity into the penalty box and good things happen and you score goals. We\u2019ve seen at Chelsea he\u2019s scored a number of goals on the same types of runs. He crashes the box and makes it really difficult for defenders with his change of pace.\u201d\nThe 24-year-old from Hershey, Pennsylvania, remains the frontman of a romper room that\u2019s been breathlessly touted as America\u2019s golden generation. More than half of Berhalter\u2019s 26-man squad compete in the world\u2019s top five leagues, including Pulisic (Chelsea), Dest (Milan), McKennie (Juventus) and captain Tyler Adams (Leeds United). It\u2019s a set-up designed at least in part for the next World Cup, when the US will be co-hosts and today\u2019s core players will be in their presumptive primes, even if Berhalter resists the notion. \u201cWe want to build a ton of momentum going into 2026,\u201d he said last week. \u201cBut it all starts now.\u201d\n\nAnd how. Berhalter has selected the three youngest lineups of all the games played in Qatar and Tuesday\u2019s was the youngest one yet with an average age of under 25 years old: the first ever American side at World Cup where all 11 starters featured for European clubs. Each of them levelled up on a night when the thorny political underpinnings were uncomfortably thrust to the fore. The atmosphere in and around many of the stadiums at the Qatar World Cup has been oddly flat. That was not the case on Tuesday, to the extent it almost felt like a different tournament altogether. It was clear outside the Al Thumama Stadium more than three hours before kickoff that US fans would be vastly outnumbered by the Iranian supporters and the many neutrals brought into their fold. They turned the 44,400-seat venue into a cauldron of noise: a neutral site in name only.\nComing off a draw with Wales that felt like a loss and another with England that felt like a win, the United States were always going to face an uphill climb in the group-stage finale, needing three points against Asia\u2019s highest-ranked team. Iran would almost certainly progress with a draw, meaning they could pack players behind the ball in the type of low block the United States have consistently struggled against. But the hostile roars and ear-splitting cacophony of vuvuzelas and drums made it that much harder. Welcome to Great Satan v Iran II, a rematch a quarter-century in the making.\nThe first half hour unfolded on a knife\u2019s edge, with the counter-attacking threat from Iran\u2019s forward pairing of Sardar Azmoun and Mehdi Taremi looming over the US team\u2019s promising start, but the Americans were not in awe of the occasion. The itinerant Adams took command in midfield. McKennie made the lung-busting box-to-box runs that have become his calling card. The prodigious Yunah Musah, celebrating his 20th birthday, dribbled out of pressure and fearlessly ran at defenders.\n\nBy the 35th minute they\u2019d already peppered the Iran goal with as many shots as in the entire Wales game, but the agita mounted with each missed finishing touch. Until that moment. For all the precocious talent in their ranks \u2013 so young and ambitious, unscarred by failure, with the note-perfect blend of confidence and humility \u2013 Pulisic remains the bellwether; as he goes, so go the Americans. It\u2019s not an accident the US team have won eight straight matches in which he\u2019s scored.\n\u201cWhat I saw from the group was a tremendous amount of focus, especially leading into the game: you could tell they were locked in,\u201d Berhalter said. \u201cThe end of the game is really what I\u2019m most proud of because it\u2019s the mark of determination and an extreme amount of effort and resiliency to hang in there and get the win and not buckle. You know, that\u2019s the first time in 92 years that we\u2019ve gotten two shutouts at a World Cup, so the boys are doing something right.\u201d\nIt\u2019s the fifth time the United States have reached the knockouts since 1994 \u2013 which puts them in some elite company \u2013 but this one means so much more after the gloomy nadir of five years ago when they failed to qualify for Russia with a dour defeat at Trinidad &amp; Tobago. Pulisic is one of only four holdovers from that traumatic night in Couva and the wait surely makes his maiden World Cup goal that much sweeter.\nAnd now? The Americans enter the business end of the tournament on a tailwind of confidence, wanting for goals but having yet to concede from open play. Berhalter, who will forever be remembered by supporters as the player whose left foot nearly sent the US into the semi-finals back in 2002, is confident this team can follow that path.\n\u201cFrom here, anything can happen,\u201d Berhalter said. \u201cAll we need to do is play one game at a time and there\u2019s no need to even project how far this team can go, because the next match is against Holland and that\u2019s our main focus. It\u2019s great to be in this knockout format. We relish this. It\u2019s an opportunity for our guys to keep grinding and stick together and enjoy this experience.\u201d"

                    "body": "The title race When Premier League festivities resume on Boxing Day the smart money is on Arsenal and Manchester City slugging it out for the title until May in what could be a contest for the ages. Leading their sides in a classic master-apprentice matchup is City\u2019s near-peerless manager, Pep Guardiola, and his former assistant and now Arsenal No 1, Mikel Arteta. The tale of the tape thus far is fascinating. Arteta\u2019s pretenders are the young thrusters who have a five-point lead but could be without Gabriel Jesus until February. Their goal count is 33 with 11 conceded, the division\u2019s joint lowest, and in captain Martin \u00d8degaard (who is 24), Bukayo Saka (21), Gabriel Martinelli (21), Ben White (25), Aaron Ramsdale (24) and William Saliba (21) Arsenal have an effervescent core being led by the vibrant Arteta.  Guardiola\u2019s seasoned campaigners are reigning champions, have scored a division-high 40, and their 18-goal phenomenon Erling Haaland enjoyed six weeks off before returning to score against Liverpool in the Carabao Cup. City have plundered four of the last five Premier League titles and Kevin De Bruyne, Kyle Walker, Phil Foden and Jack Grealish are some of their other headline acts. In this World Cup-interrupted season both sides have played 14 games but are yet to meet. Keep 15 February and 26 April in the diary free for City\u2019s visit to the Emirates and the reverse fixture to watch how each will hope to unpick the other plus, of course, the riveting sideshow of two animated managers trying to maintain cool on the touchline. Viewers of Arsenal\u2019s All or Nothing, which took in last term, were offered an insight into Arteta\u2019s at times left-field methods (a floating lightbulb featured in one team talk) and wholly likable persona. They will be impressed at how his team have gone from the late-season collapse that ended in a fifth-place finish, featured in the Amazon documentary, to this season\u2019s apparent real deal. Arsenal\u2019s sole reverse has been at Manchester United and they have dropped only two points since.  City have two defeats on the card. November\u2019s fractious 1-0 downing by Liverpool at Anfield in which J\u00fcrgen Klopp was sent off. And Brentford\u2019s smash-and-grab 2-1 win at Etihad Stadium in their final outing before the Qatar 2022 cessation. Five points is not a massive margin but it indicates an Arsenal side who are not going anywhere between now and the spring months when the championship is decided. Newcastle United, a further two points behind City, and Tottenham (three), may believe they can still force themselves into the contest but realistically this seems destined to unfold as a storybook toe-to-toe of two prizefighters: the side who were last England\u2019s best in 2004 and the current holders. Battle for the top four Only three Premier League teams have broken the usual suspects\u2019 vice-like grip on Champions League qualification in the past 20 years \u2013 Leicester, when winning the title in 2016, Everton in 2005 and Newcastle in 2003 (only the top three in England qualified when they finished fourth in 2001-02). It is St James\u2019 Park that houses the biggest threat to the closed shop once again. History may suggest otherwise, but on pre-World Cup form the odds must be firmly on Eddie Howe delivering a top-four finish in the first full season since the money started flowing in from Saudi Arabia. Taking the title race as a shootout between Arsenal and Manchester City \u2013 and Newcastle may beg to differ given their winning streak before the break \u2013 six teams are left challenging for the remaining two Champions League spots, from Howe\u2019s side in third to a plummeting Chelsea in eighth. Newcastle, who resume their league campaign at Leicester on Boxing Day, have presented the strongest case for inclusion by far in a season when they have lost once in all competitions and won seven of eight league games prior to the World Cup. There could be no clearer statement about their credentials than the performance that secured the 2-1 win at Tottenham.  Fourth-placed Spurs remain in contention but were faltering before the World Cup. Antonio Conte was left in no doubt as to the misgivings over his style among supporters during a run of three defeats in five league games, with a Carabao Cup exit at Nottingham Forest thrown in for bad measure. Harry Kane\u2019s laboured performances in Qatar and the burden carried by Son Heung-min will be an added cause for concern. Richarlison\u2019s elavated status and self-belief after a fine campaign with Brazil offers the counterbalance. Graham Potter has greater problems across London having made an underwhelming start to his Chelsea reign. The 2021 European champions find themselves eight points adrift of fourth place, albeit with a game in hand on Spurs, having not won a Premier League game since 16 October. New co-owner Todd Boehly may already be sweating on his investment and decision-making. Potter\u2019s former club Brighton are level on points with his new one but, despite an excellent recruitment strategy that was showcased on the World Cup stage, strength in depth may count against a sustained challenge over the next five months. All of which points to a potential duel between Manchester United and Liverpool for the golden ticket their respective US owners have, at various times in their tenure, taken as read. United are now unburdened from the Cristiano Ronaldo saga. Liverpool had just started to click again when the league paused and have a habit of finishing strongly under Klopp. But they are all playing catchup to the growing threat from the north-east. Relegation scrap At this time of year there are usually a handful of teams particularly short of festive cheer having swallowed the statistic that only three clubs bottom at Christmas have escaped the drop since the Premier League\u2019s inception 30 years ago, Leicester the last to do so in 2014-15. But the picture is a little skewed this season \u2013 teams have played a couple of games fewer at this stage than in years gone by \u2013 and the World Cup break provided the perfect opportunity to reset, reinvigorate and, as the modern-day manager will almost certainly testify, get on the grass with their players.  A nine-point blanket covers 11 teams from ninth-placed Fulham to bottom club Wolves. If anything, perhaps those that head into Boxing Day in the relegation zone will be more optimistic than a couple above the dotted line. Julen Lopetegui will take charge of his first league game with Wolves at Everton on Monday, with his arrival at the centre of the restructuring that has brought a new sporting director and, they hope, Matheus Cunha as the first of several new faces in the January window. Southampton, too, are hoping for an uplift under Nathan Jones after one win from their past 10 league matches, the worst run in the division. Nottingham Forest\u2019s fortunes turned with victory against Liverpool in October \u2013 they have lost once since, at leaders Arsenal \u2013 and a move to a more pragmatic approach is paying off. Evangelos Marinakis spent around \u00a3150m in the summer and Gustavo Scarpa, a free agent who this month became their 23rd signing of the season, is unlikely to be the last through the door at the City Ground. Forest are not the only team with grand plans. Unai Emery was not attracted to Aston Villa by the lure of a relegation battle and Leicester, after an ominous start, will hope to continue making headway under Brendan Rodgers after four wins from their past five games. The heat is on for Frank Lampard at Everton and for David Moyes at West Ham, with both teams a point above the bottom three after a worrying run before the break. Bournemouth, the 10th top-flight club under American ownership after the billionaire Bill Foley\u2019s \u00a3120m takeover, are also determined to make a splash. The 78-year-old Foley, who recently described himself as a dictator, said he knows his aggressive approach to business could irk rivals. \u201cI\u2019m not here to make friends with other team owners,\u201d he said, with Bournemouth targeting up to five new signings after giving Gary O\u2019Neil the manager\u2019s job."

                    "body": "Iran has released two former members of its international football team who were arrested on charges related to countrywide protests, just hours before the national squad was set to play the US at the World Cup. Right-back Voria Ghafouri was detained last week and accused of tarnishing \u201cthe reputation of the national team and spreading propaganda against the state\u201d, while retired goalkeeper Parviz Boroumand was arrested nearly two weeks ago on charges of participating in rallies in the capital, Tehran. Both were released by the judiciary on bail, according to state-linked media, in a rare concession that will be seen as an effort to placate deepening anger across the country and internationally. Hundreds of other detainees were released in recent days, state media reported, without stating the reason behind the move. The timing of the footballers\u2019 release ahead of Iran\u2019s fixture spotlights the bind ruling clerics have put themselves in by attempting to stamp out with bloody force a national protest movement that has garnered support from many of the nation\u2019s most beloved sporting and cultural icons.  Ghafouri, once a captain of the Tehran club Esteghlal, has been outspoken in his defence of Iranian Kurds, demanding the government stop its attacks in Kurdish areas when many rallies have been held. He has been an outspoken critic of Iranian authorities throughout his career, including saying he was \u201chumiliated\u201d that women were banned from watching men\u2019s games. When Iran announced its Qatar World Cup team, there was surprise that the talented 35-year-old footballer, who was a member of Iran\u2019s 2018 World Cup squad, was not named, with some speculating it may have been because of his political views. Recently, Ghafouri expressed sympathy for the family of Mahsa Amini, the 22-year-old woman whose death in the custody of Iran\u2019s morality police ignited the latest protests that have now entered their third month.  Facing one of the boldest challenges to its hardline theocratic rule since the 1979 revolution that overthrew the western-friendly Shah of Iran, Tehran has repeatedly blamed foreign enemies for the strife and accuses \u201cterrorists\u201d of killing several dozen security force members. The UN office of the high commissioner for human rights (OHCHR) has said more than 300 people have been killed so far in Iran\u2019s crackdown, including more than 40 children. Ghafouri\u2019s arrest came after the Iranian team was plunged into controversy for remaining silent during the national anthem before its game against England, in a move interpreted as supportive of the protests."

                    "body": "\nThe main event\nHis political compass may have gone haywire, but Ars\u00e8ne Wenger still knows his left wing from his right. In his latest tactical briefing as part of Fifa\u2019s technical study group, analysing the data from the group stage, he drew attention to the fact that the majority of entries into the final third had come from the left and right channels \u2013 30% and 28% respectively \u2013 while goals from crosses in open play were up 83% on Russia 2018. \u201cDoes that mean that the teams that have the best wide players are the teams that have the best chance to win the World Cup?\u201d he asked with a rhetorical flourish. \u201cI believe there is something in that and in the final result of the competition.\u201d\nShould that give England cause for optimism when they take on France in the quarter-finals? Wenger isn\u2019t the only one who can ask leading rhetorical questions, clearly. In England\u2019s case, the numbers actually suggest dynamic balance across the team. Of the 12 goals scored by Gareth Southgate\u2019s side at the tournament so far, three have been assisted by crosses from the wide left channel and three from the wide right channel. To restate for those who prefer stats as fractions: half of England\u2019s goals have been set up from wide areas.\nIn a testament to the fluidity across the front three, two of Harry Kane\u2019s three assists have come from the right flank. His first, for Raheem Sterling against Iran, was a clever dinked cross after he had drifted out wide to gather a ball from Jude Bellingham. His second, for Marcus Rashford later in the game, came from a central area, but his third also came from the right flank when he flashed a ball across the face of goal for Phil Foden to rifle home at the far post against Wales. Foden, who has alternated between the wide positions, got his assists against Senegal from the inside-left and wide-left channels, teeing up Kane and Bukayo Saka respectively. Luke Shaw, Callum Wilson and Jude Bellingham have also teed up goals with crosses from wide areas.\n\nThere\u2019s little doubt England carry a threat out wide, then, whether through their wingers and full-backs or central players who have been willing to spread the play and attack the flanks. The obvious counter is that France have the most accomplished wide forward in the world in Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 who, with five goals and two assists, has the best attacking numbers at this World Cup. Inevitably, though, that gives France\u2019s forward line a certain lopsidedness. Of the nine goals they have scored, two have been assisted from the wide-left channel and three from the inside-left, in a reflection of Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s influence on that side of the front three. While Mbapp\u00e9 has been set up twice from the right, via Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and Antoine Griezmann, Demb\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019s flank is the road less travelled in the buildup to France\u2019s goals.\n\nWhile it won\u2019t be much comfort for Kyle Walker, England\u2019s balance out wide could give them an advantage in attack. Southgate can also take heart from his side\u2019s versatility, with two goals from set pieces \u2013 Harry Maguire\u2019s knockdown for Saka at a corner against Iran and Rashford\u2019s free kick against Wales \u2013 to one for France.\nEngland have eight different goalscorers to France\u2019s three and eight different assist makers to France\u2019s six so far. If France have the best wide player at the World Cup, then England have perhaps the most rounded attack. There\u2019s no accounting for the Mbapp\u00e9 factor but, up against a nosebleed left-back in Theo Hernandez and a stand-in right-back in Jules Kound\u00e9, Southgate will still believe that his side can win the battle for the wings and, ultimately, the match. WM\nTalking points\nNetherlands v Argentina an instant classic Lionel Messi doing otherworldly things? Tick. A legendary manager throwing tactics out of the window? Tick. A Burnley flop turning the tie on its head? Tick. One of the all-time great World Cup free-kicks? Tick. An equaliser in the 11th minute of injury time? Tick. Tackles flying in during extra time? Tick. A huge on-pitch melee? Tick. A raucous atmosphere? Tick. Just the 16 yellow cards? Tick. A red card that no one noticed? Tick. A referee that enjoyed blowing his whistle more than Mike Dean? Tick. Penalty shootout drama? Tick. Plenty of afters? Tick, tick, tickety tick. There are many elements that make for a classic World Cup tie \u2013 and this one seemed to have them all. Will there be any drama left for the semi-final with Croatia? Let\u2019s hope so. GB\n\nCroatia show Brazil that control is the keySometimes it\u2019s more than just a team game, more than a game of systems \u2013 as Neymar proved by burnishing a hitherto poor personal display with a cool and decisive extra-time finish following a beautifully worked move to dismantle Croatia\u2019s well-executed plan. But other times it\u2019s all about collective control and will, as Croatia demonstrated for much of this quarter-final and in recovering from going behind. Though having to absorb plenty of pressure, Croatia had looked the more controlled side over the 90 minutes. The galloping first-half forays of Josip Juranovic rather belied their \u201cwalking footballers\u201d reputation. Even though the Celtic right-back\u2019s raids weren\u2019t exactly matched by many of his teammates they did illustrate how Croatia were able to control the tempo for much of the tie, while Brazil\u2019s attempts to force the pace often seemed hurried and lacking their usual fluidity. Add that to a resolute Croatian back four and a goalkeeper having a barnstormer in Dominik Livakovic and there seemed to be a creeping inevitability about how things would pan out \u2013 a fourth consecutive World Cup shootout win for Croatia, and a fourth quarter-final exit in five for Brazil. TD\nBeyond the football\nThe chief executive of the Qatar World Cup, Nasser al-Khater, was roundly criticised by human rights groups on Thursday for the dismissive nature in which he dealt with questions about a Filipino migrant worker who died on a World Cup site this week. By failing to give satisfactory answer he caused a problem for the France manager, Didier Deschamps, as journalists continued to ask questions about the issue of Qatar\u2019s treatment of migrant workers during his pre-match press conference. Had Khater displayed some leadership it might not have been left up to Deschamps to speak on the subject, which he clearly found difficult. \u201cIt\u2019s always a sensitive topic, it\u2019s not something I want to talk about at length,\u201d said Deschamps. \u201cIt may be a priority for you today but my priority is the match tomorrow. We\u2019re involved in a tournament here. That doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re totally insensitive to what goes on outside the football, but you shouldn\u2019t mix everything up.\u201d GB\nGlobal media-watch\nThe media in Morocco are understandably jubilant about their team\u2019s progress so far \u2013 and future prospects. In Assabah, the view was that \u201camidst distinguished and professional performance, unlimited ambition and a solid will to achieve victories, Walid Regragui\u2019s cubs are going into this difficult match with high spirits\u201d. Morocco\u2019s support has become one of the stories of the tournament, with MWN reporting that national carrier Royal Air Maroc launched special flights for supporters travelling to Doha, and that ticket resale sites had more availability for the other three quarter-finals than the in-demand Morocco-Portugal clash. The Tanja7 site in Tangiers highlighted the local tourism industry benefiting from what it termed the \u201cunprecedented propaganda\u201d of the team doing so well on the global stage. Meanwhile Jamel Debbouze, the French-Moroccan actor and stand-up comedian, is in Le Matin discussing the tantalising possibility Morocco could face France in a semi-final: \u201cI want to see this match but at the same time I dread it because I won\u2019t know how to live this moment. It would be like my father playing against my mother. It\u2019s a very complicated dilemma.\u201d MB\n\nThe internet reacts\nYou almost have to admire Croatia\u2019s insistence that tournament knockout matches require at least 120 minutes. Juranovic was the breakout star of the quarter-final for some corners of the internet. A shining example of not spending so much time worrying about what your opponents can do and letting that hamper your natural game \u2013 take note Kyle Walker \u2013 at times he seemed to be gifted the freedom of the Education City Stadium by Brazil, like a little hobbit running free in the Shire sunshine.\n\nJuranovic plies his trade at Celtic, and their fans were quick to appreciate the impact the game might be having on the bean counters at the Scottish champions.\n<!-- Invalid tweet without \"html\" field -->\n\nAdding to the way people responded to how he consoled teammate Daizen Maeda after Croatia knocked out Japan, Juranovic\u2019s stock on social media has risen and risen in Qatar. And he gets to go again on Tuesday. MB\n\nToday\u2019s matches\nMorocco v Portugal, (Quarter-final, 3pm GMT, ITV1) Having found their flow against Switzerland without Cristiano Ronaldo, Portugal come up against possibly the best defensive team in the tournament. The North Africans carry the hopes of the Arab world and are the best-supported team in the last eight. A gruelling but vindicating win over Spain may well have drained Regragui but they will try to take Portugal down to the wire. The prize of being their continent\u2019s first semi-finalists is huge, while Portugal look to reach their third semi having got there in 1966 and 2006. JB\nEngland v France (Quarter-final, 7pm GMT, ITV1) For much of the English press it\u2019s been a case of stopping Mbapp\u00e9 and rolling on to the semi-finals, though it will be a little more complicated than that. Both Deschamps and Southgate are careful, cautious tacticians blessed with attacking riches their critics would like them to untether. Not since Brazil, losing finalists in 1998, has a defending champion been past the quarter-finals. France must bury that curse, while England have not beaten a higher Fifa-ranked team at a World Cup since Argentina in the group stage in 2002. JB\nPlayer to watch\nSofyan Amrabat Globalisation and the internet has reduced the ability of players to make breakthroughs at a World Cup. But after his masterful display in damping down Spain\u2019s midfield, Amrabat presents something of a throwback; as a Dutch-born Moroccan, he has played all his career in Europe. Well-travelled, he\u2019s into his third season at Fiorentina via spells at FC Utrecht, Feyenoord, Club Brugge and Verona. With the European transfer market set to reopen in just three weeks, Amrabat is the subject of transfer speculation; he is seen as a solution to Liverpool\u2019s problems in midfield. Tottenham are also linked, but neither of those clubs\u2019 interest in his talents began with his performances in Qatar. Scouts and data departments will know all about him, but his asking price will doubtlessly have multiplied. For Morocco, against Portugal, the likes of Bruno Fernandes, William Carvalho and Bernardo Silva must try to prosper where Sergio Busquets, Gavi and Pedro could not. In the last 16, and over 120 minutes, he appeared to be everywhere. JB\n\nAnd finally \u2026\nThe UK may not be experiencing the sort of weather compatible with showering people in lager at large gatherings (though when is it?), but the beleaguered pub industry is confident England\u2019s quarter-final can boost beer sales by six million pints. The British Beer and Pub Association\u2019s chief executive, Emma McClarkin, said: \u201cThis match\u2019s Saturday-night slot will hopefully deliver good trade for pubs, with people able to head to their local early to secure a spot and cheer on the Three Lions. The World Cup has been providing a boost to beer sales and if England manage to see off France this will hopefully continue. Pubs need this as they continue to weather what was already set to be a difficult winter.\u201d TD"

                    "body": "In January, the Utah Warriors of Major League Rugby announced an alliance with Stade Toulousain of France.  Toulouse play at Stade Ernest Wallon, a temple of the world game which holds around 20,000 fans. Champions of Europe five times and France 21 times, they field stars \u2013 including Antoine Dupont and Romaine Ntamack \u2013 who are set to shine at a home World Cup this year. The Warriors play at the Zions Bank Stadium, capacity 5,000, in Herriman near Salt Lake City. In four completed MLR seasons they have made the playoffs twice. They employ internationals including the ex-Harlequins centre Paul Lasike but he and the men\u2019s US Eagles will not be at France 2023, having failed to qualify. Glaring contrasts apart, as MLR kicks off year six this weekend Utah are not alone in thinking big. With US World Cups in 2031 and 2033, World Rugby has skin in the game. Around the oval world, kick-off in San Diego \u2013 where the Warriors play the Legion on Saturday \u2013 Atlanta, New Orleans, Dallas, DC and Seattle will be closely watched. Utah\u2019s chief executive is Kimball Kjar, once an Eagles scrum-half. Asked about the Toulouse alliance, he pointed to the pressing need to sell rugby in America. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get outside what I call the rugby echo chamber. And I know that\u2019s kind of weird to say when you\u2019re talking about rugby partnerships with another rugby team, but there\u2019s something to what we\u2019re building that is much more than rugby. \u201cThe idea we\u2019ve presented to Toulouse \u2026 is the concept of being able to generate new fans and people that can come to know who Antoine Dupont is, who Romain Ntamack is, and all the other stars they have as well as within French rugby, within top-tier professional rugby. \u201cSo it\u2019s not just a partnership where we\u2019re going to exchange rugby tips and talk about player and coach exchanges \u2026 This is creating in our eyes a company that\u2019s going to develop original content, build narrative storytelling, to be able to get 18-, 19- 20-year-old kids interested in what rugby is and why it\u2019s important here in North America.\u201d The World Rugby chief executive, Alan Gilpin, has discussed why North America is important to rugby. The World Cups were announced in May last year. By November, the US men had failed to get past Portugal for a place in France. Changes are afoot. At World Rugby, Dominic Hayes, formerly of WWE and once a Premiership executive working on staging English club games on the east coast, is now general manager, USA. He did not respond to a request for comment but USA Rugby did publish a letter to members. After detailing the considerable challenges arising from bankruptcy in 2020, the union said: \u201cHosting these Rugby World Cups is a game-changer for USA Rugby\u2019s future \u2026 there will be no financial obligations or risk for USA Rugby, but an opportunity to obtain significant outside investment for the growth of the game in the United States over the next eight to 10 years, and to create financial sustainability for the union thereafter.\u201d World Rugby, the US union said, will review \u201cthe basis for investment of resources leading up to 2031 and 2033\u201d in March, then present that plan for approval by the World Rugby Council in May. \u2022\u2022\u2022 By May, MLR will be approaching the business end of its season. The stakes are always high for fledgling leagues in fringe sports but this year they may seem higher. Many in MLR point out that its first duty is to itself as a business, not to the men\u2019s national team. Many in the world game counter that the US team\u2019s failure may reflect on the league which employs most of its players. MLR has something to prove. Rugby New York won the title in 2022, beating Seattle Seawolves at Red Bull Arena in a cracking ad for rugby, albeit in front of a small game-day crowd. New York now have a new name, the Ironworkers, and a new stadium, in Mount Vernon in Westchester county.  In MLR, change is a constant. Name tweaks and stadium switches are the least of the deal. Late last season, the league disqualified the LA Giltinis and Austin Gilgronis, two teams owned by and named for one Australian entrepreneur. The entrepreneur, Adam Gilchrist, filed suit. All looked grim.  But all went quiet on the legal front and Austin and LA will not play this year. A change of commissioner is imminent though not yet announced. A new team, the Chicago Hounds, includes players formerly with LA or Austin. A 13th team, the Miami Sharks, has been announced for 2024. There is a wild card too, out in the wild wild west. Out of Glendale, Colorado, the American Raptors will play in Superliga Americana de Rugby, the competition which fueled the Uruguay and Chile teams who proved too good for the Eagles. The Raptors were a founding MLR team but withdrew in 2020, charging that the mission, to produce American talent, had been mislaid. They now focus on crossover athletes but have struggled against MLR opposition in preseason. Kjar said: \u201cGlendale is going to do what they\u2019re going to do \u2026 they\u2019ve kind of pivoted from being a North American team to being kind of a hemispheric team. And, you know, that\u2019s fine. \u201cWe have been able to go through what I think is one of the more interesting periods of a league\u2019s maturation \u2013 of having the partnership tested by an internal partner [Gilchrist] that was opting to colour outside the lines. And we came through that, I think, in the right way, though maybe it wasn\u2019t communicated the way it should have been. \u201cSo we lost two teams who were successful \u2013 good, strong teams with good players \u2013 but we can now bring in Chicago, which has a great ownership group, and Miami. \u201cThe tide is rising. And I think it bodes well for the future.\u201d"

                    "body": "Harry Kane has admitted he will always be haunted by his World Cup penalty miss against France. The England captain lifted the ball high over the bar in the 84th minute of the 2-1 quarter-final defeat in Qatar and cut a broken figure afterwards. It was the most serious individual setback of Kane\u2019s senior career, after he established himself in the Tottenham team in the 2014-15 season, but he said he would not allow it to undermine his performances.  Kane\u2019s miss meant he remains level with Wayne Rooney on 53 England goals and he will hope to set the record in March when the Euro 2024 qualifying campaign begins with ties against Italy and Ukraine. He scored twice in Spurs\u2019 4-0 Premier League win at Crystal Palace on Wednesday to move to within touching distance of Jimmy Greaves\u2019s club record. Kane has 264 goals in 411 appearances for Spurs, two behind the number Greaves scored in 379 matches. \u201cAfter it happened, I just wanted to play again as quick as possible and get it out of my head. It\u2019s something you have to deal with,\u201d he told the Evening Standard of the penalty miss. \u201cI\u2019ll probably remember it for the rest of my life, but that\u2019s part of the game. It\u2019s not going to affect me as a player or as a person. I\u2019ll keep working hard to improve.\u201d Kane was taunted by a section of Brentford fans in his first league game back after the World Cup, although he did score in a 2-2 draw. He was then a part of the dismal 2-0 home loss to Aston Villa before the recovery against Palace. \u201cIt was a tough moment for me,\u201d Kane continued. \u201cIt\u2019s never an easy thing to go through, but it\u2019s part of football, part of the highs and lows of our sport. I had a bit of time away after, just to reflect, and it\u2019s made me even more hungry to come back and be successful. So nights like last night [against Palace] are always good for me and the team, and it was much needed after the last couple of results as well.\u201d Kane made clear after the France game that he wanted Gareth Southgate to continue with England and he is delighted that the manager has chosen to do so. \u201cI\u2019m really happy,\u201d Kane said. \u201cI feel like there\u2019s some unfinished business there and he\u2019s a fantastic coach. We\u2019ve been close now on a few occasions. We looked strong in the tournament and it was small details that ended up not going our way. It will be nice to have another go at the Euros with the same team and staff.\u201d"

NBC\u2019s deal for both the English- and Spanish-language media rights to all 380 Premier League fixtures \u2013 for a then-bargain fee of $250m over three years that has since been renewed for $2.7bn over the next six \u2013 established soccer in the American sports firmament like never before by making matches available on both free-to-air television and NBC\u2019s family of cable networks.\n\u201cGrowing up, the Premier League was always the dream,\u201d Adams said on Thursday. \u201cI grew up a huge Thierry Henry fan, partially because he played for New York Red Bulls, but also because I watched a lot of Arsenal games as well. I admired him, how he played the game. I think in America, you see a lot of young players tuning into a lot of the Premier League games. They\u2019re on in the mornings, they\u2019re easy to find.\u201d\n\nWhen the United States meet England in a blockbuster group-stage tie on Friday night at the Al Bayt Stadium, they will effectively be facing one of the reasons for the sport\u2019s rising profile back home. For the 23-year-old Adams, the wider accessibility of the Premier League only further cultivated a dream that was planted when he joined New York Red Bulls during Henry\u2019s four-year stint in Major League Soccer.\nHaving forged a reputation as an industrious ball-winning defensive midfielder, Adams moved to NYRB\u2019s sister club RB Leipzig in 2019, making his biggest splash when he fired in the goal that lifted the Bundesliga club into the Champions League semi-finals. When he landed at Leeds United in a $24.2m (\u00a320m) transfer this summer, it fulfilled a lifelong dream that not even his success in Germany could match.\n\n\u201cThe Bundesliga wasn\u2019t the biggest thing for me when I was growing up,\u201d he said. \u201cYou saw a lot of quality players on the pitch at the same time [in the Premier League], no matter which teams were playing.\n\u201cI remember telling my mom at a young age that I wanted to play in England. The culture is not too far off of what America has to offer, so definitely that transition has been a lot easier than playing in Germany. But there\u2019s something special about the Premier League. There always has been and I think there always will be.\u201d\nUSA coach Gregg Berhalter, who on Monday became the first person to play for and manage an American side at a World Cup, came of age at a time when finding Premier League matches on American television was all but impossible. Only when he was in the Netherlands during the 1990s at the outset of a 15-year playing career in Europe was he exposed to the Premier League on a regular basis.\n\u201cI remember when I was in Holland getting home from my games on Saturday watching Match of the Day on BBC, and that was the only real highlights you got,\u201d Berhalter said. \u201cAnd now, every Saturday morning in America, waking up to watching the Premier League and seeing all the fan festivals they\u2019re having. Everyone now in America seems to have a team that they support.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an incredible league. We\u2019re really proud to have our players playing in that league. And to me, it\u2019s similar to the NFL and in terms of how dominant it is and how commercial-orientated it is.\u201d\nAdams, who is the youngest captain of the 32 squads in Qatar by some distance, is also the youngest player to wear the skipper\u2019s armband for a US team at the World Cup since Walter Bahr in 1950 \u2013 a tournament where the Americans famously bucked the odds with a 1-0 upset of England in Belo Horizonte.\nAs the United States have rebuilt from the wreckage of their catastrophic failure to qualify for the World Cup four years ago, Adams has made no secret of this group\u2019s goal of changing the way the world perceives American soccer. An inspired performance in Friday\u2019s match on the northeast coast of Qatar could go a long way to making it happen.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a obviously a huge opportunity to fast-track the impact that we can have,\u201d Adams said. \u201cThese are the games where the pressure is a privilege to step on the field against some of these guys. We respect them. There\u2019s probably a mutual respect between both teams. And when you get a result in a game like this, people start to respect Americans a little bit more.\u201d"

                    "body": "Rob Page has conceded he is treating Joe Allen as a special case after naming him in his squad for Wales\u2019s first World Cup in 64 years and admitted that Gareth Bale\u2019s fitness for the finals remains the \u201cmillion-dollar question\u201d.\nBy the time Wales play USA in their Group B opener Allen will not have played a competitive game for more than two months but Page is giving the Swansea midfielder every chance of being fit for their first game in Qatar and never entertained the idea of not selecting the 32-year-old because of his invaluable experience.\n\nAllen, who last month visited a specialist about his hamstring complaint, has been named in the 26-man squad that will be captained by Bale, who recently scored a crucial extra\u2011time equaliser to help Los Angeles FC to their first Major League Soccer title.\nPage admitted that whether Bale, who is yet to complete 90 minutes since moving to the MLS in June, has the fitness to play three games in nine days is a key issue facing Wales in Qatar.\n\nWales begin their tournament against USA on 21 November before matches against Iran and then England. \u201cHas he played as many minutes as we\u2019d like? Probably not,\u201d Page said of Bale. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t worry me. He\u2019s proved time and time again when he puts the Welsh jersey on, irrespective of how many minutes he\u2019s played at domestic level, he\u2019s always produced.\n\u201cOn big occasions he\u2019ll always turn up, thrive, and enjoy it. He\u2019s already with the [Wales] staff, over in the country and raring to go. Gareth has proven in the past that without minutes he can deliver in important stages.\u201d\nOf Allen, Page said: \u201cWe\u2019re giving him every opportunity to be fit for that first game. He\u2019s progressing as we want him to. If he\u2019s fit, he\u2019s playing. He\u2019s massive for how I play and the success we\u2019ve had. He\u2019s a senior lad, he\u2019s got vast amounts of experience playing tournament football as well so he knows the game inside out and that\u2019s invaluable. That\u2019s why I\u2019m throwing everything at it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s similar to Joe Ledley probably at [Euro] 2016, when Cookie [Chris Coleman] had that scenario with an experienced lad that he wanted to go in, because he needed him as a key figure in that team. For me, it\u2019s no different with Joe [Allen].\u201d\nPage had always maintained there would be few shocks in his squad. The Luton defender Tom Lockyer, whose last Wales appearance came against Finland in September 2021, has been recalled to the squad in place of the injured Rhys Norrington-Davies.\nThere is no place for the in-form Swansea winger Oli Cooper or the Rangers forward Rabbi Matondo, who also missed out on a place at the European Championship last year. Chris Gunter and Jonny Williams, who play in League Two for AFC Wimbledon and Swindon respectively, have both been included.\n\nPage announced his squad at Tylorstown Welfare Hall, the last surviving coal miners\u2019 hall in the Rhondda valley, around the corner from the manager\u2019s childhood home, where his parents still reside. This was in contrast to the USA, who lit up the Empire State Building in red, white and blue in preparation for their squad announcement. \u201cIt is a world away from lighting up the Empire State Building,\u201d Page said, speaking in a building that used to be his old snooker hall.\nOn Wednesday morning, Page went for breakfast with his father in nearby Pentre, the birthplace of Jimmy Murphy, Wales\u2019s manager at the 1958 World Cup, before visiting the blue plaque on the outside Murphy\u2019s old house on Treharne Street.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been back for a few years and to come back to Tylorstown, where I grew up, and share it with the family is really, really special,\u201d Page said. \u201cIt means the world to me and the people of the Rhondda as well.\u201d"

                    "body": "It\u2019s bad news for Manchester United fans who enjoy interminable transfer sagas. According to Joan Laporta, the Barcelona president, Frenkie de Jong is \u201cnot for sale\u201d. Thankfully, United are linked with countless other players so, for the moment at least, the Bar\u00e7a midfielder can take a back seat. Taking his place riding up front in United\u2019s careening transfer go-kart: Randal Kolo Muani, with Mohammed Kudus perched precariously above the cup holders and Axel Disasi clinging on to the headrest. Having impressed at Eintracht Frankfurt so far this season, Kolo Muani could be an interesting solution to United\u2019s striker problem. That said, Frankfurt apparently value him at anything up to \u20ac100m (\u00a388.5m) and wouldn\u2019t want to let him go in January which, given United\u2019s pressing need for a forward, could be a stumbling block. As long as Frankfurt qualify for Europe, the France international could even stay beyond the summer. Oh, and he\u2019s also a target for Bayern Munich. As for Kudus, the Ghana international knows Erik ten Hag well from their time at Ajax together. He could cost over \u00a335m, however, which his former manager thinks is a bit steep. While he has played up front for Ajax recently, he has previously said that he\u2019s at his best as a No 10. So, again, it might not be the best fit. What about Disasi, then? The Monaco defender forced his way into France\u2019s World Cup squad and ended up making three appearances in Qatar, earning some new admirers along the way. West Ham and Tottenham are among them, so United better move fast. While Harry Maguire is being kept on as cover, Disasi\u2019s arrival could nudge him closer to the exit door. Elsewhere, Southampton are mulling over a move for Michael Keane. Having made it four defeats from four in the Premier League against Nottingham Forest on Wednesday, Nathan Jones is in dire need of something, anything, to lift his squad. Keane has only made three appearances for Everton this season so he may not be at his sharpest, but he does at least have plenty of experience. Southampton are also close to signing Mislav Orsic from Dinamo Zagreb for \u00a36m. Likewise, after restarting the season with three league defeats on the bounce, Leicester are looking to drum up reinforcements. Brendan Rodgers has his eye on Dango Ouattara, the young winger spearheading Lorient\u2019s impressive Ligue 1 campaign. It\u2019s yet to be seen whether he can be convinced to swap a European push for a survival battle. If anyone can win him round it\u2019s Rodgers, surely."

                    "body": "Earlier today I set you these three challenges by Argentina\u2019s puzzle guru Rodolfo Kurchan. Here they are again with solutions. 1. Messi maths Replace the ten letters of the following sum with the ten digits 0,1,2, \u2026 9, such that the sum is correct. Each letter represents a unique digit. There are two solutions, so find the one with the largest MESSI.  Solution 92335 + 92335 = 184670 (The other solution it is 52339 + 52339 = 104678) Here\u2019s one way you might have gone about it. You are looking for the largest Messi, so let M = 9. Straight away F = 1, and U = 8. E + E must be less than 10 (since there is no carry), so E is 0, 2, 3, or 4. We can eliminate E = 0, since this would mean that T is either 0 or 1, which would be impossible. We can also eliminate E = 4, since this would mean T is 8 or 9, which is also impossible. Thus E = 3 or 2. The number zero cannot be S, since this would mean either O or B is also zero. Nor can it be I, since this would make L zero. Nor can it be T since, this would give a carry to the M column. We can also see how zero is not B or O, since this would mean that S is 5, which cant be because if S is 5 then B would be 1, which is already taken. So L = zero. Which means I = 5 We know E = 3 or 2. Let\u2019s say E = 3. Then T = 6 or 7. If it T = 6, then there is no way of rearranging 2, 4 and 7 among the other letters to make the equation work. And it doesn\u2019t work with T = 7 either. So E is not 3. Let E = 2. T must be 4, and then with a Messi-like flourish, you finish with S = 3 and O = 7 and B = 6 2. A game of four parts For each of the five tasks below, you must divide a square into four parts that have the same shape, but whose sizes are determined by the following statements: i) All four shapes are the same size. ii) Only three are the same size. iii) Two are the same size, and the other two are also the same size (but a different size from the first two). iv) Two are the same size, and the other two are different sizes. v) No two parts are the same size. Here\u2019s a solution for the first one. The square is divided into four triangles that are the same shape, and the same size.  For clarification: within each solution, the four parts must have the same shape. It is only their sizes that may change. However, each solution may involve a different shape. One solution fits perfectly along the lines of a 12 x 12 square, one on a 10x10 square, and one involves triangles. Note: the fifth one is extremely difficult. Come back for the answer later. Solution ii) and iii)  iv) and v)  2. Snake paths Your goal in this puzzle is to create a path of digits in a 5x5 grid that goes 1,2,3,4,5 and then repeats the digits in a loop. The path can start in any cell, and moves horizontally or vertically, but never diagonally, and cannot cross itself. Digits cannot repeat in the same row or column (just like Sudoku). Here\u2019s an example of a path of length 12.  Can you find a path that has length 19, the maximum possible? Extra challenge: What is the longest path you can make in a 7x7 grid starting with 1 and then repeating the numbers once you get to 7? Solution:   I hope you enjoyed today\u2019s puzzles. I\u2019ll be back in two weeks. Thanks to Rodolfo for supplying today\u2019s puzzles. To find out more about him here\u2019s his website, and if you are strolling down Buenos Aires you can visit his philately shop. I set a puzzle here every two weeks on a Monday.

                    "body": "Not a single member of the Iranian team sang their country\u2019s national anthem at the start of their World Cup match with England, in an attempt to distance themselves from their government.\nOne official on the touchline sang, only serving to highlight his isolation, but there was heavy booing of the anthem by the large Iranian crowd inside the stadium.\nSome of the spectators held placards saying \u201cWomen, life and freedom\u201d. Others chanted the name of Ali Karimi, the Iranian former player and coach who has become an outspoken supporter of the protests and who on Saturday called for Iranians to take to the streets over the way in which the army had poured into the Iranian Kurdish town of Mahabad.\nThe silence of the team during the anthem was openly reported in reformist Iranian press, which described the first-half performance of the team as a humiliation. The pro-government Fars news agency made no mention of the protest in extensive coverage of the game, which Iran lost 6-2.\nThere was some suggestion that Qatari TV directors cut away from the line of Iranian footballers as they refused to sign the anthem. Schools had been closed to allow Iranians to watch the game on TV.\nThe match came as security forces were firing at protesters in the predominantly Kurdish cities of Piranshahr in the province of West Azerbaijan, and Javanrud, in Kermanshah. Photos showed bodies on the streets, with reports of dozens injured. Across the cities in Iranian Kurdistan, fires were lit and chants of death to the dictator were heard.\nThere have been reports of 11 people killed in nearby Mahabad over Saturday and Sunday, with heavy military equipment including armoured vehicles patrolling the streets and firing into buildings in what was described as a form of martial law.\nHuman rights groups say more than 450 people have died since protests started after the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurd who died in police custody after being arrested for not wearing the hijab in conformity with Iranian law. As many as 55 security force members have been killed.\nThe anthem protest may yet have repercussions for the players when they return to Iran, but Carlos Queiroz, their Portuguese manager, had said the players were free to make a protest.\n\nIn an interview before the game, Ehsan Hajsafi, the Iranian captain, opened his remarks by saying \u201cin the name of the god of rainbows\u201d, a phrase uttered by a 10-year-old boy, Kian Pirfalk, who was killed by Iranian security forces.\nHajsafi said he was standing by the Iranian people and offered condolences to the grieving families in Iran.\nThe Bayer Leverkusen forward Sardar Azmoun wrote on Instagram: \u201cAt worst I\u2019ll be kicked out of the national team, which is a small price to pay for even a single strand of Iranian women\u2019s hair. Shame on you for killing the people.\u201d\nPosters of the team have been torn down in parts of Tehran. Video showed that after England\u2019s third goal against the Iranian team, the residents of Kohsar region in Tehran cheered and chanted the slogan \u201cDeath to the dictator\u201d.\nThe protests show the extent to which Iran\u2019s sporting stars and celebrities are refusing to back the heavy-handed repression being meted out by the security forces.\nOver the weekend, authorities arrested two prominent actors who had expressed solidarity with the country\u2019s protest movement and removed their headscarves in public, according to state media.\nHengameh Ghaziani and Katayoun Riahi were detained after being summoned by prosecutors looking into their \u201cprovocative\u201d social media posts, Iran\u2019s state-run Irna news agency said.\nOn Saturday, Ghaziani published a video on Instagram of her removing the hijab. \u201cMaybe this will be my last post,\u201d she wrote. \u201cFrom this moment on, whatever happens to me, know that as always, I am with the Iranian people until my last breath.\u201d\nIranian sports stars ranging from wrestlers to archers and rock climbers have mounted protests at various international sporting events, including refusing to wear the hijab. One of Iran\u2019s most prominent football commentators, Farhad Fakhrbakhsh, quit.\nAt the weekend, the head of the boxing federation, Hossein Souri, and two youth team boxers failed to return to Iran with their team, instead seeking political asylum, prompting the conservative newspaper Kayhan to demand the authorities take greater care in vetting senior officials in sports federations."

I just hope Raheem and his family are OK and he does what he needs to do.\u201d\n\n\n\n 2.22pm  \n\nIf you are in the market for animal predictions, can I offer you Kurizo, who appears to be half-dog/half-teddy bear by the looks of it?\n\n\n\n\n 2.08pm  \n\nI can tell you that at Zagreb Zoo in Croatia, they have been trying to get Kent the gibbon to predict the winner of today\u2019s match. \n\nKent made a name for himself \u2013 well according to the Google search I\u2019ve just done anyway \u2013 during the 2018 World Cup with a string of successful predictions, although he came a cropper when he predicted that Russia would beat Croatia in the quarter-finals, which is why I\u2019ve not called him a \u201cpsychic gibbon\u201d.\n\n\n\n 2.02pm  \n\nHere is a little bit more detail on that Japan team courtesy of Reuters:\nJapan coach Hajime Moriyasu brought Takehiro Tomiyasu into his defence in place of the suspended Ko Itakura as one of three changes to his side for the World Cup last-16 game against Croatia on Monday.\nItakura received a second yellow card of the tournament in Japan\u2019s stunning upset of Spain in their final group match, so Tomiyasu, who has made two appearances off the bench as he struggles to shake off an injury, starts.\nMoriyasu also brought Wataru Endo and Ritsu Doan back into his midfield at the expense of Takefusa Kubo and Ao Tanaka, who scored against Spain.\n\n\n\n 1.58pm  \n\nJapanese fans have been bring their social media A-game to this tournament and I\u2019m loving this little video of the team all ready to go in a vintage video game style.\n\n\n\n\n 1.56pm  \n\nSpain coach Luis Enrique is convinced his players can overcome Morocco in the World Cup last 16 on Tuesday and deal with the lottery pressure of a penalty shootout if they need to.\nRohith Nair was at Enrique\u2019s media doo-dah today in Qatar for Reuters, and reports that Enrique actually said penalties shouldn\u2019t be a lottery at all.\n\nOver a year ago, in many national camps we told players, \u2018You have homework ahead of the World Cup. You must take at least 1,000 penalties with the club\u2019. You can\u2019t just train them when they\u2019re with the national team\u2019.\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a lottery. If you train often, then the way you take penalties improves. Obviously, you can\u2019t train the pressure and tension, but you can cope with it.\nIt doesn\u2019t depend on luck, the goalkeeper is key in the shootout. All three of our keepers are good at them. In our sessions we have players taking penalty kicks, it\u2019s homework we\u2019ve taken into account.\n\nEnrique sounds on paper quite laid back about the whole thing, saying:\n\nI couldn\u2019t care less about the result, I want to control what I can control as a coach. I encourage my players to forget about the result too, the result will come.\nFootball is not always a fair game. I\u2019m convinced we have more merits than Morocco. If we don\u2019t, I\u2019ll be totally fine.\nOur philosophy is the same. We try and entertain the fans so they have fun watching us. We shouldn\u2019t just go and get the victory, we need to entertain the spectators.\u201d\n\nHe also had some respectful words for tomorrow\u2019s opposition, telling reporters:\n\nWe have a clear idea. We don\u2019t have to dominate all opponents for 90 minutes. In the World Cup you have the best teams, you\u2019re playing against top level coaches and players.\nMorocco are in the best mood at the moment, they\u2019re highly motivated after a spectacular group stage, they topped a tricky group.\nI\u2019m very satisfied with what I\u2019ve seen in training, I\u2019m convinced we have a great chance to achieve a good result and advance.\n\n\n\n\n\n 1.49pm  \nTeam news: Japan v Croatia\n\nJapan are bidding to get beyond the round of 16 for the very first time. Croatia lost the final last time out. They\u2019ve only been out of the group stages on two previous occasions, and both times made it to the semi-finals. Something will have to give.\nJapan: Shuichi Gonda, Shogo Taniguchi, Wataru Endo, Ritsu Doan, Hidemasa Morita, Yuto Nagatomo, Junya Ito, Daichi Kamada, Takehiro Tomiyasu, Maya Yoshida, Daizen Maeda\nCroatia: Dominik Livakovic, Borna Barisic, Ivan Perisic, Dejan Lovren, Mateo Kovacic, Andrej Kramaric, Luka Modric, Marcelo Brozovic, Bruno Petkovic, Josko Gvardiol, Josip Juranovic\nYour officials today are referee Ismail Elfath (US), the assistant referees are Corey Parker (US) and Kyle Atkins (US), and Mustapha Ghorbal (Algeria) is the fourth official.\nAt the helm for our minute-by-minute is Daniel Harris where he has teed it up by saying that \u201cit\u2019s the only one of the eight ties in which the outcome seems in doubt at the outset \u2013 and feels by far the most likely to give us extra-time and the lottery of successfully executing a precision-skill under intense pressure.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll keep this blog running up until kick-off for all the rest of the World Cup news, which includes some corking quotes from Spain\u2019s Luis Enrique about *cough* penalties being a lottery *cough* that have just dropped, and then I\u2019ll be off.\n\n\n\n 1.39pm  \n\nThere are some rumblings afoot in the Portugal camp ahead of tomorrow\u2019s clash with Portugal and \u2013 imagine my surprise \u2013 a Mr C Ronaldo is right at the heart of it. \nCoach Fernando Santos has said he was deeply unimpressed with Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s behaviour as the forward left the pitch against South Korea and refused to guarantee that the striker would captain Portugal in Tuesday\u2019s last-16 tie against Switzerland on Tuesday. The Portugal head coach insists Ronaldo has been dealt with following his latest outburst but considers the case closed.\nRonaldo reacted angrily after being withdrawn midway through the second half of their defeat against South Korea last Friday. Ronaldo put his index finger to his lips as he left the field and later claimed he was irked by the opposition striker Cho Gue-sung for asking him to speed up his exit. \u201cBefore my substitution, one of their players was telling me to leave quickly,\u201d Ronaldo said after the shock defeat. \u201cI told him to shut up, he has no authority, he doesn\u2019t have to say anything.\u201d\nAsked about Ronaldo\u2019s substitution at a press conference on Tuesday, Santos replied: \u201cHave I seen the images? Yes, I didn\u2019t like it, not at all. I didn\u2019t like it. I really didn\u2019t like it. But from that moment onwards everything is finished regarding that issue. These matters are resolved behind closed doors. It\u2019s resolved. Full stop on this matter and now everyone is focused on tomorrow\u2019s match.\u201d\nSantos would not confirm whether Ronaldo would captain Portugal against Switzerland, who are hoping to reach the World Cup quarter-finals for the first time since 1954. \u201cI only decide who is going to be captain when I reach the stadium,\u201d Santos said. \u201cI still don\u2019t know what the lineup will be. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve always done and that\u2019s what I\u2019m always going to do and it\u2019s going to be the same tomorrow. The other topic is solved. We have fixed that in-house and that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\n\n\n 1.34pm  \n\nSocceroos players have returned to a heroes\u2019 welcome at a packed Sydney airport, with fans clapping and cheering for the players after a historic run to the knockout stages at the World Cup.\nAbout a quarter of the squad that lost valiantly to Argentina in the round of 16 arrived back in Sydney on Monday night, with another contingent landing in Melbourne.\nSupporters carrying signs and flags chanted and stomped for the players, creating a ruckus to welcome back a squad that had captured the heart of the country.\nAustralian captain and goalkeeper, Matt Ryan, told reporters the response from fans had been \u201cphenomenal.\u201d\n\u201cAfter the games we\u2019d have over there, we\u2019d see the reaction from the Australian public, through footage and videos, at Federation Square and lots of other places, and the support has been unreal.\u201d\n\u201cAnd its nice to come back here and see it with our own eyes, we can\u2019t thank the Australian public enough,\u201d Ryan added.\n\nRead more here: Mostafa Rachwani \u2013 Cheering crowds welcome home Australia\u2019s World Cup Socceroo heroes\n\n\n\n\n 1.17pm  \n\nAway from the World Cup there is still plenty of domestic football \u2013 men\u2019s and women\u2019s \u2013 going on in the UK. On Saturday I was at Brisbane Road to watch top of the table Leyton Orient beat Bradford City in League Two. You won\u2019t regret watching this goal from Tom James.\nOn Sunday I was at an FA Women\u2019s National League cup game, which pitched my local team London Seaward against Plymouth Argyle from the division above, who ran out 4-0 winners in a game that was more closely fought than the score ultimately suggested.\nThe top flight is still in action in the women\u2019s game too, and Suzanne Wrack, Sophie Downey and Renuka Odedra have got six talking points from the Women\u2019s Super League weekend action for you here \u2026\n\n\n\n\n 1.03pm  \n\nFrom the pictures, it seems like the atmosphere is already building up on the way to the Al Janoub Stadium in Al Wakrah, where Japan will be facing Croatia at 3pm GMT. We should have team news in just under an hour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 12.59pm  \n\nCroatia are getting set.\n\n\n\n\n 12.49pm  \n\nPA report that Callum Wilson did not join England\u2019s other non-starters at training on Monday due to a minor muscle strain.\nThe Newcastle striker has made two substitute appears in Qatar and was an unused substitute in Sunday\u2019s 3-0 World Cup last-16 win against Senegal.\nEngland\u2019s starters worked inside the following day at their Al Wakrah Sports Complex base, where the rest of the group worked outside with Gareth Southgate and his coaches.\nWilson was the only absentee from the session for non-starters, with a slight niggle meaning the striker sat out as a precaution. England are set to have a day off on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n 12.28pm  \n\nMy colleague Kim Willsher in Paris has been reading what the French press has to say about the prospect of Saturday\u2019s quarter-final against England:\nFor a country that sent its king and queen to the guillotine France has an enduring and surprising fascination for the monarchy. So it is no surprise that Saturday\u2019s quarter-final between England and France is being seen as a royal duel between King Kylian and Prince Harry.\nAfter Sunday\u2019s matches set the scene for a battle between the two countries \u2013 historic rivals on and off the pitch despite the Entente Cordiale \u2013 Eurosport carried a picture of Harry Kane and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and declared: \u201cThe quarter-final on Saturday will have an unusual flavour: for the first time in history the French team and the English team will cross swords in a direct elimination match\u201d.\nFrance Info headlined with France meeting its \u201cbest enemy\u201d and \u201cPrince Harry\u201d referring to Kane making the \u201cFrench kingdom tremble\u201d.\nNo reference to the Anglo-French rivalry is complete without a reference to \u201cperfidious Albion\u201d and France Info did not disappoint. \u201cBetween France and England, [football] history dates back more than a century to the first match on 1 November 1906 [which England won 15-0],\u201d it said.\n\u201cSince then, Perfidious Albion have won 23 of the 40 official duels, with 11 victories for the French and six draws. But 16 of these successes were achieved before the war \u2026 In the 21st century, Les Bleus have won four of the six encounters, with one defeat and one draw. And while this match has become a European classic, it will be the first time the two nations have faced each other in an international tournament\u2019s decisive match.\u201d\nRead more here: Kim Willsher \u2013 King Kylian v Prince Harry: how French media sees the World Cup quarter-final\n\n\n\n 12.25pm  \n\nI should imagine that the Spanish autonomous city of Ceuta has not crossed your mind recently. The exclave sits right at the tip of northern Morocco, and is the kind of place you could be forgiven for not putting much thought into until, say, Spain and Morocco are facing each other in a World Cup round of 16 match. At which point it is an absolute magnet for journalists looking for a bit of colour to add to their coverage.\nAntonio Sempere and Joseph Wilson for AP have been doing just that, with a piece talking to the people who live there, and finding out where their loyalties lie. The long and complex relationship between Morocco and Spain will no doubt be part of the backdrop to the game in Al Rayyan.\nSulaika Hosain, a 26-year-old Ceuta native, feels \u201c100% Spanish,\u201d yet when the game kicks off on Tuesday in Qatar, her sympathies will tilt toward Morocco, the land of her grandfather.\n\u201cI am a Spaniard and want Spain to win, but I am rooting for Morocco. When Morocco plays, something moves inside me,\u201d she said at the indoor playground where she works. \u201cLet them win something, so people can say, look, Morocco is not just a poor place.\u2019\u201d\nMohamed Laarbi, 28, manages a bar in Ceuta that is showing all the World Cup matches. He is a third-generation Spaniard and is fully backing Spain. Regardless of the result, he does not expect the game to lead to any serious problems like the riots in Belgium and the Netherlands after Morocco beat Belgium in the group phase.\n\u201cMorocco is playing well, but when they meet Spain they will hit a wall,\u201d he joked. \u201cAnd then the game is over. That is it.\u201d\nEven so, Laarbi acknowledged that he and other Muslims from Ceuta or the other Spanish territory of Melilla further east on the coast are caught in an no man\u2019s land.\n\u201cMoroccans say that we are not Moroccan, that we are sons of Spaniards, while Spaniards from the Iberian Peninsula say that we are not Spaniards,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are people from the peninsula who when you say you are from Ceuta, you have to show them where it is, and they say that is Africa.\u2019\u201d\n\nCeuta has been a Spanish possession since 1580 \u2013 although it is not formally recognised as Spanish territory. It has a mixed population of Christians and Muslims, Spanish and Moroccan residents and day workers, and has become a political flashpoint over border controls.\nFor Mohamed Et Touzani, a 35-year-old hairdresser in Ceuta, the message is clear: just enjoy the game. Originally from central Morocco, Et Touzani has lived in different parts of Spain for 15 years and said it is \u201clike my home.\u201d\nHe has a house, like many people with Moroccan roots, across the border. He plans to watch the game with Spanish friends at what he called a \u201cChristian\u201d bar in Ceuta. He will cheer for Morocco.\n\u201cSoccer is soccer, and politics are politics. So we are going to play a soccer game and have a good time, but with respect. That is the most important thing,\u201d he said. \u201cMorocco has red and green (in its flag), Spain has red and yellow. We have this in common. We are neighbours, and we must live like we were brothers.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 12.51pm GMT\n\n\n 12.13pm  \n\nBless him, Marcus Rashford has just posted up a proud picture of him with his mother in the stands in Qatar last night.\n\n\n\n\n 11.44am  \n\nHere is an update on the latest situation surrounding Raheem Sterling, via PA Media:\nSurrey police have confirmed they are investigating a burglary in which jewellery and watches were stolen after reports of a break-in at the home of the England footballer Raheem Sterling.\nIn a statement, the force said: \u201cWe are currently investigating a report of a burglary at an address in Oxshott, Leatherhead.\n\u201cPolice were contacted just before 9pm on Saturday 3 December after the occupants of the property came home and discovered a number of items including jewellery and watches had been stolen.\n\u201cInquiries to establish the circumstances are under way and the investigation is ongoing. No threat of violence was involved as the items were discovered stolen retrospectively. Inquiries into the circumstances are ongoing.\u201d\n\n\n\n 11.09am  \n\nBen Fisher is in Doha for the Guardian, and here he is reporting on how Poland\u2019s Matty Cash coped \u2013 or not \u2013 with Kylian Mbapp\u00e9:\n\u201cI spent the afternoon watching his clips and I knew it was going to be a tough test, but when he gets the ball, stops and moves, he\u2019s the quickest thing I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Matty Cash, the Aston Villa defender, says. \u201cI said to him at the end: \u2018Can I have your shirt?\u2019 and he gave me his match-worn shirt so I\u2019m delighted with that.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s the difference between mapping out how to halt Mbapp\u00e9 while studying footage of him and trying to stifle the real thing on the pitch? \u201cI\u2019m watching the videos while lying in bed,\u201d Cash says, laughing. \u201cIn real life he\u2019s burning my legs \u2013that\u2019s the difference. It\u2019s a massive difference. When he stands you up and moves he does it really well. He drops the shoulder, goes short then long. I got into a couple of races with him, and I did all right. You look over your shoulder and he\u2019s there.\u201d\nRead more here: Ben Fisher \u2013 \u2018Mbapp\u00e9 burned my legs\u2019: Matty Cash on how it feels to face France star\n\n\n\n\n 10.54am  \n\nMorocco will be playing only their second ever World Cup finals knockout match tomorrow. They last reached the round of 16 in Mexico in 1986. They drew 0-0 with Poland, and then England \u2013 that was the Ray Wilkins\u2019 match \u2013 and then beat Portugal 3-1 in the final group match to book a slot against West Germany. Here\u2019s how that went down \u2026\n\nAchraf Hakimi, who was born in Madrid, has been speaking to Spain\u2019s Marca newspaper in the build-up to Tuesday\u2019s clash between Morocco and their European neighbours. He told the paper:\n\nSpain are a top five team and always come to the World Cup to win. But our coach has also taught us to have a winning mentality; it doesn\u2019t matter who we are up against. We are going to try to play our way and try to beat them.\nWe finished first in the group and I think we deserve a little respect. I think that Spain knows that and that they have to be a little afraid of us. And why can\u2019t we pull off a surprise again?\nIt is something unique, playing for your country. And especially now that we are making history. It\u2019s incredible to see how people are living it with us, and that energy transmits a lot to us and gives us strength to continue and look to do great things.\n\nMorocco met Spain in their final group game in Russia, where a 91st minute equaliser by Iago Aspas denied Morocco a win, levelling the match at 2-2.\n\n\n\n\n 10.44am  \n\nFrance\u2019s Antoine Griezmann has yet to score as he toils away at this World Cup, but Julien Pretot writes for Reuters in Doha that the attacking midfielder could not care less, as he is enjoying his comeback at the highest level with the defending champions.\nWhile Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 has scored five goals in Qatar to take his overall World Cup tally to nine and Olivier Giroud has surpassed Thierry Henry to become France\u2019s all-time top scorer with 52 goals, Griezmann has been working away tirelessly in the engine room behind them without reward.\n\u201cI had chances to score against Dennmark but I missed them. Maybe I\u2019m not as close to the box as I used to be. I\u2019m playing good games,\u201d Griezmann, who has played a record 71 consecutive games with Les Bleus, told reporters.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still missing a goal but I don\u2019t shoot 50 times a game and I\u2019m not obsessing about it. The team need me in midfield to make the link between the defence and the attack. I\u2019m very proud and happy.\u201d\n\u201cI owe Didier Deschamps everything, so when I play, I play for France, my teammates, but also for the coach,\u201d said Griezmann.\n\u201cBeing well physically helps me a lot. There are no problems in my private life,\u201d said Griezmann. \u201cIn my head I had tough moments at Barca and last year when I came back to Atletico. It was complicated, I had to make myself very small, I had to find myself, on and off the pitch.\u201d\n\n\n\n 10.28am  \n\nIf you enjoy seeing people\u2019s faces while they talk on the Guardian Football Weekly podcast, then have I got the video clip for you. Here are Max Rushden, Philippe Auclair, Barry Glendenning and Mark Langdon talking about England last night, saying that Jude Bellingham had evoked memories of Gazza.\n\n\n\n\n 10.22am  \nSouthgate on France game: 'the biggest test that we can face'\n\nEngland coach Gareth Southgate has said he is looking forward to England\u2019s test against the \u201cvery best\u201d after beating Senegal. PA Media reports him saying:\n\nIt\u2019s the biggest test that we can face. They\u2019re world champions, incredible depth of talent, outstanding individual players, very difficult to play against and to score goals against. It\u2019s a fantastic challenge, brilliant game for us to prepare for.\nThe two quarter-finals that are already in place are fantastic, historic football rivalries and great games from the past. A brilliant game for us to be involved with and test ourselves against the very best.\n\nSouthgate went on to say:\n\nOf course Mbapp\u00e9 is a world-class player and has already delivered big moments in this tournament and in previous tournaments. But there\u2019s also, I think Antoine Griezmann is now over 70 consecutive games for France and I think he\u2019s also a phenomenal player. We know Olivier Giroud so well and they have outstanding young midfield players as well. \nSo, everywhere you look when we\u2019re studying France at every age group, they have incredible depth of talent in every position. It\u2019s a huge test but one that we\u2019re really looking forward to and it\u2019s a great challenge for our team now.\n\n\n\n\n 9.55am  \n\nMy colleague Kevin Rawlinson has a piece featuring the views of Mike Dodds, who coached Jude Bellingham as a youth:\nThere was already excitement around Bellingham when he left Birmingham as a teenager to further his career in Germany with Borussia Dortmund \u2013 a club with a demonstrable record of giving playing time at the top level to young talent. \u201cI think that [move] probably sums up his mindset because, when he made the decision to leave Birmingham at 16 or 17, his decision was a footballing decision,\u201d said Dodds.\nHe stressed the maturity needed of a teenager to make such a decision as the world dealt with the kind of uncertainty at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic in the summer of 2020.\n\u201cHe could have probably made easier decisions in terms of his lifestyle, his family. But he wanted to make a footballing decision \u2013 what was best for his career \u2013 that he thought was the next step for him.\nDodds described Bellingham as an \u201cauthentic\u201d character, adding that the two keep in touch regularly. \u201cI think the nice thing is we don\u2019t really talk about football. Now we talk about normal life stuff. And I think that\u2019s one thing I\u2019m really proud of \u2026 Seeing him doing what he\u2019s doing in the World Cup, I think I\u2019m probably more proud of the fact that we have a relationship that transcends the football pitch.\u201d\n\nRead more here: Kevin Rawlinson \u2013 Jude Bellingham\u2019s will to win set him apart, says youth coach\n\n\n\n\n 9.49am  \n\nWorld Cup diplomacy latest: AP reports that the leader of the United Arab Emirates made a surprise visit today to Qatar \u2013 his first since leading a yearslong four-nation boycott of Doha over a political dispute that poisoned regional relations.\nSheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who also serves as the ruler of Abu Dhabi, made the trip at the invitation of Qatar\u2019s ruling emir, sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the state-run WAM news agency reported.\n\n\n\n 9.31am  \n\nHere are some vox pops from fans after the England v Senegal game yesterday, many of which seem a little bit nervous at the prospect of facing France next.\n\n\n\n\n 9.29am  \n\nAaron Timms has written for the Guardian on how Fox Sports\u2019 US World Cup coverage is an unmissable abomination, with the broadcaster offering up \u201ca feast of gaffes, stupidity, and unconquerable on-air awkwardness\u201d which, frankly, sounds unmissable:\nInsults to our collective intelligence have come from all angles: the constant, tedious analogies to American sports (stepovers and feints described as \u201cdekes\u201d and \u201chesis\u201d, corners constantly compared to \u201cpick and rolls\u201d); the neverending quest to \u201ccontextualize\u201d the world game by comparing whole countries to American states (\u201cQatar is the size of Connecticut,\u201d we were told repeatedly on the opening day); the network\u2019s embrace and promotion of the interminable \u201cit\u2019s called soccer\u201d cause (who cares?); the strange extended segment in the run-up to USA v England about how much Harry Kane likes American football (ditto); the employment of Piers Morgan as a special guest pundit (no thanks).\nOn the field things may be developing nicely, but off it US football \u2013 or the version of it that Fox Sports serves up to us every four years \u2013 seems destined to remain stuck in a permanent 1994, forever on the brink of becoming America\u2019s next big thing, forever hostage to a cabal of C-suite cable bros intent on translating this exotic, bewildering sport into the language of touchdowns, home runs, and alley oops for what they see as the country\u2019s blinking, insular Yankee Doodle millions. This bizarre cultural parochialism does a disservice to both America\u2019s players, now a sizeable constituency in European club football, and the legions of fans on these shores whose understanding of the sport is every bit as sophisticated as anything you\u2019ll find on the terraces of Camp Nou, Anfield, or La Bombonera.\nRead more here: Aaron Timms \u2013 Fox Sports\u2019 US World Cup coverage is an unmissable abomination\n\n\n\n\n 9.10am  \nDeclan Rice: other countries should fear 'great team' England\n\nEngland\u2019s midfielder Declan Rice has been speaking to the media, and said that France should fear England ahead of Saturday\u2019s quarter-final. He told reporters:\n\nI\u2019ve said it all along. I don\u2019t think we get the credit we deserve in our performances. I think if you look at other teams, like the Netherlands and Argentina, they win their games comfortably and they get called masterclasses. With us, it always gets picked off. The negative things always come that way.\nIf you look at the last couple of games, it\u2019s been faultless. I think countries, like I said the other day, should be starting to fear us now because we\u2019re a great team.\n\nRice was also bullish about England\u2019s record in front of goal \u2026 and defending theirs, telling the media:\n\nWe\u2019re silencing the critics. Going into the tournament, there was a lot of talk that we don\u2019t score enough goals. That\u2019s another one we\u2019ve kept people quiet on. There was a lot of scrutiny around the defence and conceding goals, but it\u2019s been solid. We\u2019re going to keep building and pushing.\n\n\nAsked if this England squad was better than the one that reached the final of Euro 2020 last year, Rice said:\n\nYeah. We\u2019ve been pushing so well as a team. We\u2019re really together now on the pitch and off the pitch. As a team we really complement each other really well. The boys I\u2019m playing with in midfield, we really complement each other. The boys up front, he [Southgate] can bring in an attacker and nothing will change. And the back four has been absolutely solid. We\u2019re building a really nice foundation but it\u2019s down to us now. There\u2019s no point buzzing about [beating Senegal] if we can\u2019t push on and beat France.\n\nHe stressed that this England set-up doesn\u2019t seem to fear the big teams in big games any more:\n\nAgainst the big teams, there has always been a lot of talk on us using the ball. I think in this tournament we\u2019ve pretty much controlled every game. We\u2019ve had a fair share of possession, we\u2019ve moved it really well.\nThe opening stages have been really shaky because teams are really trying to stop us playing. But once we get that goal, they have to change. It opens up and then you really start to see us play.\nAgainst France, we\u2019ve seen some weaknesses in them that we can try to exploit. It\u2019s set up for a great game.\nThese are the games we want to play in. They only come round once: England v France, quarter-final, it doesn\u2019t get bigger than that. We\u2019ve got six days to prepare now and I\u2019m sure the world will be watching. We really want to progress.\n\n\n\n\n 8.49am  \n\nI\u2019m going to confess that my Japanese isn\u2019t all that, but some things about football transcend language. The Japanese team social media accounts have just put out an epic six minute supercut of Japan\u2019s highs and lows at World Cups, as well as what it has all meant for the development of the sport in Japan. If you want old people playing football, kids playing football on the beach, blind football, disability football, interspersed with clips of the Samauri Blue looking dejected after various round of 16 matches, this is the supercut for you.\nWhack the sound up, because it is all soundtracked by Syori No Emi Wo Kimi To from Ukasuka-G which the Guardian has previously described as \u201cbombastic indie from J-pop\u2019s answer to the Killers\u201d which \u201cbuilds to a climax so relentlessly silly that, by the six minute mark, you are somehow won over.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 8.32am  \n\nJonathan Liew was at the Al Bayt Stadium last night to watch ENgland and Senegal, and today he writes for us that Phil Foden gave a seminal display to show England he really is sensational:\nIn England\u2019s era of extreme competence there is a danger that nights like these, games like these, performances like these, somehow become normalised. There has been no outburst of national hysteria: no Gazza explosion, no Owen moment, no Rooney-mania. Foden\u2019s image does not hang from one of Doha\u2019s many skyscrapers.\nEven in the aftermath of this 3-0 win against Senegal it was Jude Bellingham who seemed to attract the bulk of the tributes, Kane who claimed the player-of-the-match award (although when asked who really deserved it, Foden was the first name Kane mentioned). Here, as for much of his career to date, Foden\u2019s gift was assimilated, priced in, accepted as established fact.\nPerhaps, in the long run, this is for the best: a long-overdue recession in the hype economy of English football. In a sense Foden\u2019s curse has been to spend his entire career surrounded by very good footballers in a successful team. There is no real sense of trajectory, no demons to slay, no haters to conquer. Foden was born sensational and everyone knew it. At no point has he really had the capacity to surprise us.\nRead more here: Jonathan Liew \u2013 Phil Foden gives seminal display to show England he really is sensational\n\n\n\n\n 8.27am  \n\nJust a quick note here that Saudi Arabia, who have been touted as potential World Cup co-hosts in 2030, look set to host the 2027 Asian Cup, after India, the other country bidding for the event, has withdrawn.\nAP reports that the bids from India and Saudi Arabia had been shortlisted by the AFC\u2019s executive committee in October and the final decision was expected to be made at a regional congress in February. Saudi Arabia is now the only candidate. \nThe 2023 edition will be played in Qatar after China was replaced as host because of the complications around China\u2019s zero-Covid policy. Qatar are the current champions, having won the event when it was last staged, pre-pandemic, in the UAE in 2019.\n\n\n\n 8.20am  \n\nJuninho Pernambucano\u2019s point there about Brazil being just expected to go through against what are perceived to be weaker sides did ring a little bit of a bell, having lived in England for quite some time.\nHere is how the English newspapers reacted to yesterday\u2019s victory for the Three Lions over the Lions of Teranga, which you suspect has merely postponed the gnashing and wailing of teeth about \u201cWhy didn\u2019t Southgate pick Grealish / Foden / Rashford / Saka / Mount / Maddison\u201d [Delete as appropriate depending on who he does pick against France]\n\n\n\n\n 8.15am  \n\nSpeaking of Brazil, Juninho Pernambucano writes for the Guardian this morning to say that Brazil are the best team in the world but pressure weighs heavily on the players:\nFor a football team to be successful, just in a developed society, you need its people \u2013 ie, players \u2013 to work together to achieve something special. In real life you need people to collaborate to evolve. That goes for every country. But in Brazil we have something different that I cannot see in other countries.\nThere is an enormous amount of passion around football in Brazil and the way everyone in the country analyses the national team is radical, at times simplistic and often overwhelming when it comes to criticising the players and the coach, making it seem as if football is very easy for those who play, especially if they are professional players. In Brazil it seems to be difficult to accept that football, as well as life, evolves.\nAnd so Brazil are under enormous pressure before their last-16 game against South Korea after losing their third group game against Cameroon. They also lost two more players to injury, Alex Telles and Gabriel Jesus, but Neymar should be fit again. The fact that they are playing South Korea, who everyone thinks they should beat, only adds to the expectation, the pressure and the sense that Brazil have to go through. It would have been different if they were facing Portugal or Uruguay from that group.\nRead more here: Juninho Pernambucano \u2013 Brazil are the best team in the world but pressure weighs heavily on the players\n\n\n\n\n 8.12am  \n\nAway from the World Cup for a minute, overnight AP have been carrying an update on the condition of Brazilian legend Pel\u00e9.\nMauricio Savarese writes that two of his daughters and one of his grandsons has said the three-time World Cup winner has been hospitalised since Tuesday to treat a respiratory infection aggravated by Covid-19. They added that the 82-year-old is under no imminent risk of death.\nKely and Flavia Nascimento and Arthur Arantes do Nascimento said in an interview that aired Sunday night in Brazil that Pel\u00e9, who is also undergoing chemotherapy in his fight against cancer, is expected to leave the Albert Einstein hospital in S\u00e3o Paulo once he fully recovers from the respiratory infection. Neither the family nor the hospital have any predictions in that regard.\nThe hospital said Saturday that Pel\u00e9 is responding well to treatment for the infection and his health condition had not worsened over the previous 24 hours. The hospital did not issue any statements on the former footballer\u2019s health Sunday.\n\u201cHe is sick, he is old. But at the moment, he is there because of the lung infection. And once he feels better, he will go home again,\u201d Kely Nascimento told TV Globo. She lives in the United States and spoke on video. \u201cHe is not saying goodbye in a hospital at the moment,\u201d she added.\n\n\n\n\n 8.05am  \n\nYou know the drill by now. Overnight Max and the gang have been producing more podcast goodness for your delight. Barry Glendenning, Mark Langdon and Philippe Auclair joined Max Rushden, and it says here \u201cthe panel spend most of part one waxing lyrical about Jude Bellingham. And who could blame them?\u201d\nGet it in your ears here \u2026\n\n\n\n\n 8.02am  \nPreamble\n\nWe know half of the final eight at this year\u2019s World Cup like no other: Netherlands, Argentina, France and England. That is an incredibly strong looking line-up of past winners and finalists. Today we will be adding two more teams to their number.\nFirst up at 3pm GMT, Croatia will be looking to emulate the run they made to the final in 2018. Two 0-0 draws and a thumping of Canada in the group stages sees them unbeaten so far, but suggests they haven\u2019t quite clicked yet. They face a Japan team who have shocked both Germany and Spain and must be on a high. This is Japan\u2019s fourth appearance in the round of 16. They have never won one. Could today be the day?\nThen at 7pm GMT Brazil will start as perpetual heavy favourites against South Korea, despite the South American side\u2019s stumble against Cameroon in their final group game. Brazil had only needed a point to top their World Cup group for the 11th consecutive time, but instead a much-changed lineup fell to a defeat, and only their superior goal difference over Switzerland kept them in top spot. South Korea\u2019s late winner against Portugal came in a game that they, frankly, had never looked like winning. It means they have a chance to emulate the squad of 2002, the only other time South Korea have been further than the round of 16.\nPlease join me for all the buildup to those games, and no doubt a lot of analysis of yesterday\u2019s performances by England and France \u2013 both of whom ended up winning by scores that perhaps flattered how tricky they had initially been finding their respective matches with Senegal and Poland. We should also get press quotes from the remaining four teams in action tomorrow \u2013 Morocco, Spain, Portugal and Switzerland. Do drop me a line at martin.belam@theguardian.com. \n\n"

The incident occurred at about 2am on Saturday as the hospitality village was emptying out after the game, which Argentina won on penalties. It came shortly after the US journalist Grant Wahl died of an apparent heart attack while covering the match.  The precise circumstances surrounding the fall are unclear but one fan told the Guardian that the guard had dropped from the top outside concourse on to the ground below close to gate 30 of the stadium. The person involved, who is believed to be a migrant worker, was rushed to Hamad hospital where he is said to be in a stable but critical condition. In a statement Qatar\u2019s supreme committee said: \u201cOn Saturday 10 December a security guard at Lusail Stadium suffered a serious fall while on duty. Stadium medical teams immediately attended the scene and provided emergency treatment before he was transferred to Hamad Medical Hospital care unit via ambulance. \u201cHe remains in a stable but critical condition. Our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family during this time, and we wish him a speedy recovery. The host country is investigating the circumstances leading to the fall as a matter of urgency. He will continue to receive his salary in full while receiving medical care.\u201d This latest incident comes days after it was reported that a Filipino national contracted to fix lights in a car park at the Sealine Resort, the training site for the Saudi Arabia national team, had died earlier in the tournament. According to reports the worker slipped off a ramp while walking alongside a vehicle and fell headfirst against concrete. The chief executive of the Qatar World Cup, Nasser al-Khater, then sparked controversy by saying \u201cdeath is a natural part of life \u2013 whether it\u2019s at work, whether it\u2019s in your sleep\u201d, when asked about the death. On Saturday football\u2019s governing body, Fifa, honoured Wahl by placing flowers on the desk he was due to use to cover England\u2019s quarter\u2011final against France. They also put a tribute to the 49-year-old on the stadium scoreboard shortly before kick-off."

                    "body": "Pep Guardiola has said for the first time that if Manchester City do not win the Champions League under him his highly successful tenure will \u201cnot be complete.\u201d Since becoming City manager in the summer of 2016 Guardiola had won five Premier League titles, four League Cups and the FA Cup. But he is yet to lead the club to the Champions League title and has previously always played down the importance of doing so. Guardiola signed a one-year contract extension last month with an option to extend it until 2025 and he was asked if winning Europe\u2019s most important club competition had been a motivating factor in that decision.  \u201cIt\u2019s not the only one but I admit it\u2019s the trophy we want and my period here will not be complete if we don\u2019t win it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not the only reason [I signed]. I will do everything in the time we have together to win it but I\u2019d say the same before [signing]. It\u2019s the trophy we don\u2019t have and we\u2019ll try to do it. I have the feeling they [City] will get it sooner or later. We\u2019ve tried in the past, even in the first season even though we went out in the last 16. So we will try with all our strength.\u201d City are back in action on Thursday night for the first time since the break in domestic football for the World Cup when they host Liverpool in the Carabao Cup last-16 tie. While five of Liverpool\u2019s squad were in Qatar compared to 16 of City\u2019s with Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez yet to return after being a member of Argentina\u2019s triumphant team, Guardiola has no concerns about a tournament hangover. \u201cI have the feeling that those who were at the World Cup are in better condition than players who weren\u2019t, the players who didn\u2019t go lack rhythm, the ones who come back have been competing and trained every day,\u201d he said. \u201cPlayers who were not at the World Cup and who play can get the rhythm tomorrow so we have to do it with what we have. Step by step they come back \u2013 we have six players back [already] and are happy they are back, in general they played really well and had an incredible experience.\u201d While the England players \u2013 Kyle Walker, Jack Grealish, Kalvin Phillips and John Stones \u2013 were among those back in training on Wednesday \u2013 Guardiola congratulated \u00c1lvarez, who ended the tournament with four goals. \u201cWe are incredibly happy for him,\u201d he said. When City lost October\u2019s league game at Liverpool Jurgen Klopp was sent off after berating an assistant referee, while the fixture has a history of hostility. This moved each club to write to fans to call for calm on Thursday. and Guardiola agreed this means extra emphasis is on the managers to behave properly. \u201cDefinitely,\u201d he said, then joked. \u201cWe want to behave good: the players, the managers, the spectators but sometimes emotion means people can\u2019t behave like a statue. We will always react in that way but the respect for the officials, the rules and the opponent is always there from my point of view. Reactions happen that\u2019s why the referees are there. It\u2019s just a game let\u2019s make people happy, that\u2019s what we try to do.\u201d The Arsenal forward Gabriel Jesus \u2013 who left City in the summer for \u00a345m after five years at the Etihad \u2013 suffered a knee injury at the World Cup that may rule him out until February. City trail Arsenal by five points and Guardiola was asked if the Brazilian\u2019s enforced absence may offer an advantage. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for Gabriel, that\u2019s for sure and I would prefer him to play for Arsenal. He\u2019s an important player for them like he was for us,\u201d he said . \u201cI want to wish him a speedy recovery. [But at the moment] I don\u2019t think about what we have to do with Arsenal. I start to think about what we have to do to win tomorrow, Leeds [in the league] and the next game. I\u2019m so sorry for him. Not one person in this club would speak badly about him, I wish him all the best.\u201d"

                    "body": "When it comes to World Cup preparation, England have been meticulous. With an eye on every detail, from team psychology to adjusting to the heat of a desert climate, Gareth Southgate\u2019s team have left no stone unturned. Except one: they\u2019ve picked the same goal music as Switzerland and Poland.\nFor some traditional football fans, that blast of music over the PA system that follows a goal is anathema. At the World Cup it\u2019s all part of the entertainment, with the organiser, Fifa, having requested a song from each of the 32 competing nations that might best capture the joy of scoring.\nThe Guardian has obtained the list of the nominated tracks and it showcases commercial pop music from every corner of the globe; from Canada\u2019s choice of native superstar Drake and his Going Bad to the devotional music of Tunisia\u2019s selection, Muhammed by Adnan Dogru, the Balkan reggaeton of Serbia\u2019s selection Preko Sveta by Rasta. England have chosen fan favourite Freed From Desire, a 1997 hit for the Italian singer Gala. The only problem is that the song is so popular the Poles and Swiss have selected it too.\n\nThe Three Lions have had occasion to play their goal music half a dozen times so far, while Switzerland have yet to kick off their tournament and the Poles were held to a 0-0 draw by Mexico, whose chosen piece is La Negra by La Hija Del Mariachi. While England have named a backup goal jingle, however \u2013 Dua Lipa\u2019s One Kiss \u2013 the other two countries have not.\nA clash of goal \u201cstings\u201d, as Fifa calls them, will not be the biggest controversy at the World Cup, but music is certainly playing a central role in the tournament. The official song of Qatar 22, Hayya Hayya (Better Together), brings pop stars from three continents together. The US R&amp;B singer Trinidad Cardona, the Afrobeats icon Davido and the Qatari star Aisha share verses on a song articulating a message of global friendship, one of the organisers\u2019 key themes.\n\nIn case Asian fans felt neglected at all, Fifa flew in the K-pop sensation Jung Kook of BTS to perform at the opening ceremony in Doha last weekend. The governing body also claimed a first when they launched an official World Cup playlist on Spotify under the artist name Fifa Sound. Not to miss out, sponsors Budweiser have released their own World Cup song too, a cover of Tears For Fears\u2019 80s anthem Everybody Wants to Rule the World, performed by the rapper Lil Baby. It has been less commonly heard in Doha than Hayya Hayya.\nIn another first, live music has also been integrated into the tournament in an attempt, in Fifa\u2019s words, to \u201creimagine\u201d the fan experience. The Fifa Fan Festival, a 40,000 capacity concrete park in Doha\u2019s West Bay, mixes live screenings of every match with a crowd-pumping MC and a series of live acts, again selected from all over the world. There is a beach festival too, with big name DJs, which fans can pay to access, or get in free if they stay in one of the \u00a3175-a-night tent villages.\n\nThe idea of the World Cup as one big party has never been so deliberately cultivated, but football and music have a long history together going back to the days of New Order and John Barnes, or the less artistically relevant 1970 single by England\u2019s World Cup squad, Back Home. The extension of the World Cup experience also reveals an underlying truth, however; that football\u2019s power brokers see a world in which their sport becomes just another strand of consumer entertainment, and they want to make sure they\u2019re ready."

We weren\u2019t happy with conceding late.\u201d Other than that, he\u2019s pretty happy, as most people associated with the US team would be and should be.

So the goal difference edge heading into Costa Rica will be just slightly less.     1.49am    84 min: Quick look ahead -- Mexico\u2019s final game will be at home against El Salvador. Assuming they hang on against Honduras, the chances that they\u2019ll drop out of the top three are minimal. Costa Rica might want to start scouting New Zealand. Or the Solomon Islands. Aaron Long picks up a yellow card for some rough defending.     1.44am    80 min: US Soccer would like your vote for Man of the Match ...   Somewhere, someone is compiling passing stats, expected goals and clearances to make a case for someone other than Pulisic.     1.42am    78 min: Ferreira could have a hat trick of his own if he had been a little more alert on a couple of possessions. Or if he really had taken one of those penalties. Good work from the youngster.     1.40am    76 min: Finally, a piece of bad but likely irrelevant news:       1.39am    75 min: Reference of the night ...      1.36am    70 min: There it is. Jordan Morris replaces the brilliant Christian Pulisic, who hands the armband to Tyler Adams. Then Adams is substituted as well. Officially, US Soccer is saying it\u2019s Gianluca Busio for Pulisic, with Morris replacing Adams.     1.33am    69 min: Yellow card to Pulisic, who hit the ground and instinctively grabbed the ball as if expecting a whistle. Probably time to take him out. This is the insight for which I make the big bucks.     1.30am   GOAL! USA 5-0 Panama (Pulisic 65)   Clinical, wondrous, composed. The buildup from Antonee Robinson and De La Torre on the left is good enough. The pivot and nutmeg from Pulisic puts him alone 10 yards out, and he slots it into the net for his hat trick.  Updated at 1.39am BST    1.28am    63 min: Aaron Long, a mainstay before an Achilles injury, is getting ready to come in. Looking ahead, here\u2019s my suggested lineup for the Costa Rica game: Horvath, Moore, Robinson, Robinson, Zimmerman, Long, Bello, Sands, Palmer-Brown, Yedlin, Adams. That\u2019s a goalkeeper, nine defenders and a midfielder who can defend.     1.25am    61 min: Oh, that is a beautiful pass from Reyna and a squandered chance from Ferreira. You could also look at it as De La Torre passing to an off-balance forward when he should\u2019ve shot.     1.22am    57 min: Reyna leads a promising charge up the center of the field, and Pulisic sends a pass along the ground to one post. The ensuing cross is cleared, but Shaq Moore presses forward and is fouled. Good game for the last-minute call-in.     1.21am    Meanwhile, in Honduras ... it\u2019s still tied. Beleaguered Mexico coach Tata Martino isn\u2019t there because of an eye ailment.     1.19am    55 min: Still nervous moments for the US defense. Well, they would be, if they hadn\u2019t already scored four goals. But they don\u2019t want to squander what they\u2019ve built here. Nothing can be taken for granted in Costa Rica.     1.17am    53 min: CHANCE for Panama, and Tyler Adams has saved a goal, blocking a shot from the top of the box after Steffen and Zimmerman\u2019s miscommunication. I\u2019ll say it again -- Steffen needs to come out.     1.16am    51 min: Gabriel Torres is close to 100 caps. According to transfermarkt, this is No. 99. He has 22 goals. His transfer history includes a stop at Colorado and maybe 400 other clubs. Panama has the better of the attack now.     1.13am    48 min: Good buildup for Panama, but the resulting shot is calmly blocked. Anyway -- Reyna and Kellyn Acosta are in, replacing Arriola and Musah. For Panama -- Medina, Rodriguez and Torres are in, replacing Barcenas, Gondola and Blackburn.     1.11am    Second-half subs ... A lot. Reyna is on, but it\u2019s Gio Reyna, not his long-retired father. He drags a shot wide on one of his first touches.     1.05am    Scott Bassett writes: \u201cI know USA! USA! USA! is leading by three goals (and a penalty on the way) but they look incredibly open and wobbly. Like they need Reyna on the field. Claudio Reyna, that is, to put his foot on the ball and calm things down.\u201d Costly giveaway in 2006, though.     1.03am    Stats ... Panama has had more than 60% of the possession but just one shot on goal. That\u2019s about it.     12.58am    Not to take anything for granted from a USA point of view, but if you\u2019re Costa Rica right now, are you thinking you have a better chance of overtaking Mexico instead of the soon-to-be-visiting USians? If Mexico can only get a draw tonight, they\u2019d be on 23 to Costa Rica\u2019s 22.     12.53am   HALFTIME: USA 4-0 Panama  Not the USA\u2019s best half of play. They lead 4-0. Sometimes, it\u2019s just going your way. And the goals were all well-taken.     12.52am    45 min +5: Pulisic gets shoved, comes back with a shove of his own, and then someone drills the ball in Pulisic\u2019s direction, though it hits De La Torre instead. Pulisic goes ballistic, but his teammates show remarkable unity in throwing their star player away from a messy situation.     12.50am   GOAL! USA 4-0 Panama (Pulisic 45+3 pk)   Correct guess by Mejia, but Pulisic\u2019s shot is just too powerful and too well-placed.  Updated at 12.54am BST    12.49am    45 min +2: PENALTY! Just after referee Ivan Barton let Panama get away with just a warning after another brutal foul against Pulisic, he gives a questionable penalty on some contact in the area. Barton gives at least one yellow and could easily give another for dissent.     12.47am    45 min +1: Panama\u2019s corner kick fizzles, and Pulisic quickly brings it forward and plays ahead to Antonee Robinson, who gets control of the ball with a step on the defense but is ultimately caught at the edge of the area.     12.46am    45 min: Finally, a lull.  I only disagree with the typo. But they\u2019ve taken advantage of their opportunities, and that\u2019s never to be taken for granted.     12.43am    42 min: BICYCLE ATTEMPT by Ferreira in the middle of the box. Sends it well over the bar, but it was worth a try.     12.42am    41 min: Pulisic turns it over in a dangerous spot, and a few passes lead to a shot from Godoy, who sends it just wide. Flag was up for offside, anyway, but the defense just looks far too uneasy here.  Good thing the USA has already, you know, scored three goals.     12.40am    40 min: A cleaner catch this time for Steffen. From the record books:       12.39am    38 min: Steffen dawdles with the ball at his feet far too long. No harm done in this case, but you have to wonder if some physical pain is distracting him and hurting his decision-making.     12.38am    37 min: USA on the run, but it\u2019s a poor ball in the end.  Agreed, and you wonder how much the midfield misses the industrious Weston McKennie.     12.36am    35 min: Free kick for Panama. Cleared.  A Panamanian goal in this game wouldn\u2019t be a surprise. They\u2019re playing for their qualification lives, and they were pressing even when it was 0-0. The question is how many they\u2019ll give up.     12.35am    The \u201clive\u201d table, with Mexico currently tied 0-0 with Honduras 28 Canada -- ignore them; they\u2019re in 25 USA -- 19 goals for, 7 against, +12 23 Mexico -- 14/8, +6 22 Costa Rica -- 11/8, +3 18 Panama -- would be eliminated     12.33am    32 min: Now Arriola\u2019s down, having taken a right forearm to the face from Gondola.  They checked this one but decided not to worry about it. Fearless editor Tom Lutz informs me that, given the current scores, Costa Rica would have to beat the USA 5-0 to take away their spot in the World Cup.     12.30am    30 min: Concern for Steffen again, as he flaps at a high cross and is fortunate to recover for a point-blank save. He\u2019s grimacing. He\u2019s hurt. He needs to come out.     12.29am   GOAL! USA 3-0 Panama (Ferreira 27)  De La Torre to Moore to Arriola to Ferreira, and the young American blasts it into the net from 6 yards out.  Goal difference matters, and this team smells blood.  Updated at 12.35am BST    12.27am    27 min: Half-chance for the USA, with Pulisic freezing a terrified defense before playing the ball for Ferreira, who is shut down ... For now ...     12.26am    We love replays ...      12.24am   GOAL! USA 2-0 Panama (Arriola 23)  Give credit to our referee Ivan Barton. Pulisic was absolutely clobbered in the corner, but Barton correctly played advantage. Antonee Robinson lofts the ball to the top of the 6, where Paul Arriola flicks it to the far post with a deft header.     12.22am    20 min: CHANCE for Panama! The free kick goes into a dangerous area and stays there for a goal mouth scramble that see keeper Zach Steffen come up in some pain. Replay shows Steffen punched it away and surely stopped a goal. Play continues farcically with a Panamanian attacker down three yards from the goal, causing Steffen to step around him. No whistle to stop play until Pulisic is emphatically fouled. Steffen gets treatment but continues. Folk hero Ethan Horvath is the backup.     12.20am    19 min: Panama goes direct toward Blackburn, who responds with an unconvincing dive that convinces our ref to give a free kick.     12.18am   GOAL! USA 1-0 Panama (Pulisic 17, pen)  Never a doubt. The Chelsea star-turned-benchwarmer-turned-star rips it into the net between the center and the left corner.   Updated at 12.25am BST    12.17am    PENALTY! Replay also shows a handball, and referee Ivan Barton of El Salvador can\u2019t ignore both of these. Jesus Ferreira is approaching the mark to take this one, which is a bit of a surprise. Our commentators wonder if this is a decoy, using Ferreira as a decoy to absorb Panama\u2019s ire as they whine about a legit call. And they\u2019re right. Kudos to Stu Holden and John Strong.     12.15am    14 min: Replay shows a routine hand to the face and neck from Godoy on Zimmerman. It\u2019s Concacaf, so that\u2019s probably OK. The ref will take a look at the screen anyway.     12.14am    13 min: This would be a good time to point that we have VAR because Walker Zimmerman is down in the area after that corner kick.     12.13am    13 min: Corner kick, and it\u2019s dangerous. Header, deflection, shot, deflected out. Let\u2019s do it again.     12.12am    11 min: Pulisic goes for goal despite the acute angle. The referee doesn\u2019t think it deflected off the way. The AR disagrees. The AR wins out. As it should be, says this frequent AR.     12.11am    10 min: This is better for the USA. Miles Robinson wins the ball, and they string together a few passes to get the ball to Pulisic. The anticipation rises, but his shot is blocked. But the USA regains possession, and Pulisic suffers the first of what will surely be many fouls. Free kick from 22 yards or so.     12.09am    8 min: Stats say Panama has had 64.5% of the possession. This is very strange. The USA simply can\u2019t get the ball. Carrasquilla rips a hopeful long-range shot well over the bar. Impressive technique to get that much power, but it\u2019ll only trouble a few supporters behind the goal.     12.07am    6 min: 30-yard free kick for Panama, and they run a set play that must\u2019ve looked great on the training ground but fails to impress here.     12.04am    ICYMI: If something should happen to the US men in qualifying, those of us in the 50 states and additional territories can always switch our allegiance northward ...      12.03am    2 min: Panama is pressing. No bunkering on the road here. Good for them.     12.02am    Kickoff: On a related note, my laptop\u2019s clock is 10 minutes behind. But we have indeed just started.     11.58pm    Meanwhile, El Salvador barely missed an equalizer against Costa Rica deep into stoppage time. Alas for the USA and Panama (and Mexico), no. And the game ended with Keylor Navas dodging water bottles while the ref urged him to play the ball forward. Concacaf in a nutshell.     11.56pm   Panama lineup  1 - Luis Mejia (Union Espa\u00f1ola, Chile) 15 - Eric Davis (Dunajska Streda, Slovakia)16 - Andres Andrade (Armenia Bielefeld, Germany)4 - Fidel Escobar (Cultural Leonesa, Spain)23 - Michael Murillo (Anderlecht, Belgium) 20 - Anibal Godoy (Nashville SC)8 - Adalberto Carrasquilla (Houston) 13 - Freddy Gondola (Alajuelense, Costa Rica)10 - Yoel Barcenas (Leganes, Spain)19 - Alberto Quintero (Universitario, Peru) 14 - Rolando Blackburn (Royal Pari, Bolivia) So the only countries whose pro leagues have two representatives on this team are Spain and ... the USA.      11.44pm   USA lineup  From the federation\u2019s notes:  1-Zack Steffen (Manchester City) 2-Shaq Moore (Tenerife) 3-Walker Zimmerman (Nashville SC)12-Miles Robinson (Atlanta United)5-Antonee Robinson (Fulham) 4-Tyler Adams (RB Leipzig)6-Yunus Musah (Valencia)14-Luca de la Torre (Heracles)  7-Paul Arriola (FC Dallas)10-Christian Pulisic (capt.; Chelsea)20-Jes\u00fas Ferreira (FC Dallas) Substitutes: 18-Ethan Horvath, 8-Cristian Roldan, 9-Ricardo Pepi, 11-Gio Reyna, 13-Jordan Morris, 15-Aaron Long, 16-George Bello, 17-Jordan Pefok, 19-James Sands, 21-Gianluca Busio, 22-Erik Palmer-Brown, 23-Kellyn Acosta If that lineup looks odd to you, bear in mind that DeAndre Yedlin and Tim Weah hit their yellow-card limits in Mexico. And everyone\u2019s tired. There was some talk that the USA might start a B team in Mexico in anticipation of loading up the team for tonight\u2019s game instead, but that obviously didn\u2019t happen. Moore, who has spent a few years banging around in Spain, mostly in the Segunda Division, only joined up with the team a few days ago when Reggie Cannon tested positive for Covid. De la Torre is starting for only the second time. Weston McKennie and Sergi\u00f1o Dest are still out.   Updated at 11.47pm BST    11.33pm    You may say I\u2019m a (bad) dreamer, but I\u2019m not the only one ...      11.31pm   Preamble: The scenarios  Please pardon this peek into my psyche, which I promise will pay off. Perhaps. Possibly. Over the weekend, I did live curling webcasting, because that\u2019s how I roll. On one key delivery, I was flabbergasted at the decision to attempt a runback rather than a draw to the eight-foot, because ... it doesn\u2019t matter -- just know that I was surprised by what one team tried to do. As I thought might be the case, they wound up giving up one rather than scoring four. A less risky shot would\u2019ve guaranteed three. I asked afterward why they would try such a shot. Their answer was that they simply didn\u2019t see the worst-case scenario I saw. That\u2019s me. I see worst-case scenarios.  So you\u2019ll see below that there are scenarios in which the USA! USA! USA! can qualify for a voluntary trip to Qatar for the World Cup, which will be held this year unless other worst-case scenarios come into play and we\u2019re all hiding from pandemics or geopolitical events. With a draw today, the USA would at the very least qualify for the intercontinental playoff with the Oceania representative, which will be either New Zealand or the Solomon Islands, who will face each other in a final that is now politically charged. Lest you think that result is a foregone conclusion, bear in mind that New Zealand scraped through today\u2019s semifinal with Tahiti by a 1-0 decision. The worst-case scenario is a loss to Panama. Assuming Costa Rica hangs on to win in El Salvador (they lead 2-1 in the 65th minute) and Mexico beats last-place Honduras, the standings would look like this with one game remaining if Panama wins: 28 Canada (qualified)25 Mexico22 USA (likely ahead on goal difference)--22 Costa Rica--21 Panama On the last matchday (March 30, the last of this brutal three-game international-window whirlwind slate), Panama hosts Canada, which has no incentive now. The USA must travel to Costa Rica. If that seems easy, you didn\u2019t see Canada visit Costa Rica a few days ago. Nor do you remember the USA crashing out of qualifying last time around. So will the USA heed its lessons of 2018? Will this young team show the fortitude of its predecessors in the rough-and-tumble world of Concacaf qualifiers? Or will today\u2019s game be the soccer equivalent of a runback attempt that concedes a vital three points? (Another example of my dark psyche: As a Duke graduate, I\u2019m already muting people on Facebook in anticipation of North Carolina\u2019s men\u2019s basketball team defeating the Blue Devils in Mike Krzyzewski\u2019s last game, and the Tar Heels haven\u2019t even defeated St. Peter\u2019s yet.)     11.08pm   Canada clinches  Never a doubt, really, at least not any time in the past couple of months.  Stuck in the wilderness since 1986, the Canadian men will finally be back on the sport\u2019s big stage. (The women are there routinely, thanks to North America being one of the regions that took the sport seriously.) Cyle Larin scored in the 13th minute, and Jamaica offered little resistance after that. The final tally was ... hang on, give me a second to count ... 4-0.  Also today, Kerri Einarson earned bronze for the Canadian women in the world curling championship, news overshadowed somewhat by the announcement that Rachel Homan and Tracy Fleury will be joining forces next year. That\u2019s like Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers saying, \u201cYou know what? I think we\u2019ll both sign for you.\u201d      11.00pm    Beau will be here shortly. In the meantime, here\u2019s a quick preview of today\u2019s game courtesy of our friends at the Associated Press: With two games left in World Cup qualifying, the United States head into a showdown against Panama in Orlando knowing that winning the last home match will be key before going on the road for the finale. Sound familiar? The US romped over the Panamanians 4-0 in October 2017 as Christian Pulisic scored the first goal and set up the second. Needing only a draw four days later, the Americans flopped to a 2-1 defeat at Trinidad and Tobago, a nadir in American soccer that ended a streak of seven straight World Cup appearances. \u201cEvery game comes with pressure, different pressure, and, of course, we feel it,\u201d goalkeeper Zack Steffen said Saturday. \u201cWe\u2019re aware of the emotions, of our emotions going into it, and it\u2019s just about kind of putting those on the backburner and going out there and playing the game that we\u2019ve been playing for our whole lives.\u201d Canada lead Concacaf qualifying with 25 points and the US are second with 22, ahead of Mexico on goal difference. Costa Rica are fourth with 19, and Panama fifth with 18. The top three nations qualify for this year\u2019s World Cup, and fourth place advances to a playoff against the Oceania champion, likely New Zealand. The US can clinch Sunday with a victory and Costa Rica failing to win at El Salvador, or with a draw if Los Ticos lose. A US draw would guarantee no worse than the playoff spot. With a plus-nine goal difference to Costa Rica\u2019s plus-two, a win would put the US in position to head to Costa Rica at most needing to avoid a lopsided defeat. \u201cIt\u2019s really important not to get ahead of ourselves,\u201d US coach Gregg Berhalter said. \u201cI know there are similarities to last time, but we\u2019re looking forward. I don\u2019t think this is a group that looks back. We acknowledge what happened in the past. It\u2019s part of who we are as US men\u2019s national team players and program. We acknowledge that, but we have to forge our own path, and tomorrow\u2019s a good time to do it.\u201d Goalkeeper Matt Turner, right back Sergino Dest, central defender Chris Richards and midfielders Weston McKennie and Brenden Aaronson are injured, backup right-back DeAndre Yedlin and winger Tim Weah are suspended and No 3 right back Reggie Cannon is out with Covid-19. Shaq Moore was brought in from Spain to meet the team in Orlando and appeared likely to start at right back. The US are coming off Thursday\u2019s 0-0 draw against Mexico at altitude in Mexico City, when the Americans had the better chances. The US followed the emotional high of a home win over El Tri in November with a bumpy 1-1 draw at Jamaica. \u201cIt was just a totally different atmosphere, and we knew it was going to be a tough game, an ugly game and something we just had to grind through,\u201d Steffen said. \u201cThis time, I think getting a point at Azteca, all the energy and emotions exerted there, we didn\u2019t get too high, we didn\u2019t get too low. Coming back to Orlando, where we\u2019re all focused, just kind of just to stay in the moment.\u201d  "

                    "body": "Graham Arnold lived out of a suitcase for seven months during 2021. World Cup qualifiers had resumed after a lengthy Covid-enforced hiatus, but Australia\u2019s strict border restrictions made it next to impossible to host home games. Opponents were not willing to complete the 14 days of hotel quarantine. Neither were some of his own overseas-based players, and even those who were faced resistance from their clubs. So Arnold left home bound for various parts of Asia, navigating a labyrinth of fixtures across the world\u2019s largest continent when few international flights were running and border restrictions varied. The 59-year-old stayed in Dubai for some locked-down periods, and regularly oversaw matches on the back of only one full training session with a squad that was regularly changing.  All up, 45 players participated in the Socceroos\u2019 qualifying campaign, a 20-match odyssey over 1,008 days featuring hundreds of thousands of kilometres in travel across 10 countries. Arnold, away from family and friends in Sydney, spent his days \u201csat there looking at the walls\u201d and ruminating about results and players\u2019 wellbeing. Less than a year later, after March\u2019s loss to Japan sent the besieged Socceroos to two qualifying playoffs, Arnold was almost sacked. He saved his skin three months after that by beating the United Arab Emirates and Peru \u2013 the latter on a penalty shootout in which the goalkeeper Andrew Redmayne made international headlines for his wiggling \u2013 to qualify. Five months on, he has taken Australia to a first win at a finals in 12 years, first back-to-back wins in history, and the knockout stages for the first time since 2006. On the eve of Australia\u2019s last-16 meeting with Argentina at Doha\u2019s Ahmad bin Ali Stadium, Arnold jokes he \u201cwas going to write a book on it all\u201d. \u201cI think the universe is paying us back for all the hard work we\u2019ve done,\u201d he said. \u201cThe universe is looking down on us and repaying the support and sacrifices that the players and staff made through all that. \u201cAnd I\u2019m trying to look at the positives, but I do believe this has been crucial, that Covid helped unite this team together and create the family culture of mateship. Because these boys were in lockdown in hotels, they couldn\u2019t go off the floor they were on and had to be with each other in the social room playing pool or table tennis. That really united the players as a family.\u201d There was another silver lining in the Socceroos\u2019 nomadic existence: they played five World Cup qualifiers in Doha, which ensured they were well acclimatised to the environment and playing in the air-conditioned stadiums. \u201cWe\u2019ve now won six out of seven games here in Qatar. It is, for us, a home away from home.\u201d Arnold took over the Socceroos after the 2018 World Cup and quickly learned why the job he held is perhaps Australian sport\u2019s most underappreciated and unrewarding one. The fact he was replacing an interim coach in Bert van Marwijk \u2013 Ange Postecoglou had qualified his team for Russia and then quit in frustration months before the tournament \u2013 said it all. Football in Australia is a minority sport battling for relevance and cash, and run by a network of competing agendas. Nonetheless, in a country known for its sporting achievement, expectations have remained high. Since November 2005, when John Aloisi\u2019s famous playoff penalty against Uruguay broke a World Cup drought dating to 1974, qualification has been the minimum requirement.  Arnold\u2019s career depended on his ability to carry the team to Qatar 2022. His polarising reputation (see the aforementioned politics), along with a short-lived tenure overseeing the Socceroos for a year between 2006 and 2007, meant sympathy for the unique challenges in his path was less forthcoming. Former players \u2013 some former national teammates \u2013 called for his head, attacking his tactics and selections. At points he compounded his own pain by deflecting or calling out what he perceived to be \u201cnegative media\u201d. One such selection that was criticised was the inclusion of Mitchell Duke, the striker whose header downed Tunisia last weekend. Duke and a handful of other older heads including the captain, Mat Ryan, are players he had coached from a young age in the A-League. Largely, though, he picked a young, inexperienced squad, dropping more senior members including Tom Rogic, Adam Taggart and his son-in-law Trent Sainsbury in favour of new faces he had brought through the under-23s team. That was the other stress \u2013 the last of Guus Hiddink\u2019s \u201cgolden generation\u201d had retired and, having spent years coaching domestically, Arnold knew there were not many waiting their turn. He felt he had no choice but to manage both teams concurrently with the help of his assistant, Ren\u00e9 Meulensteen, and trusted coaching staff he had mostly taken with him from Sydney FC. \u201cAt the 2018 World Cup it was an ageing squad,\u201d Arnold said last month. \u201cI was thinking: \u2018Where am I going to get these players?\u2019\u201d At the time he could hardly field a squad, but qualified the Olyroos for the Tokyo Olympics \u2013 breaking a drought dating back to Beijing 2008 \u2013 and upset Argentina in their opening match before losing the rest. He also scouted the world for players who could feasibly acquire an Australian passport. This exercise yielded some Scottish gems in the defender Harry Souttar, who had never previously stepped foot inside the country but is arguably the side\u2019s standout player so far, and the winger Martin Boyle, who is unfortunately injured. After Wednesday\u2019s 1-0 win over Denmark wrote this unknown team into Australian sporting folklore, the public started to call them the \u201cplatinum generation\u201d. International media, who had written them off after last week\u2019s chastening 4-1 loss to France, backtracked and watched more closely. \u201cPretty early on the culture embedded the young lads coming up,\u201d Souttar said. \u201cThe belief that we\u2019ve got as a squad is one like I\u2019ve never experienced before. It\u2019s taken probably three and a half to four years for everyone to think the same way. I think that the last two results have showed what can happen when everyone is on the same path. \u201cIf you told me four years ago we would be in this position I would probably have believed you, because we had so much belief in ourselves. We\u2019re not surprised, though I know we have surprised a few people, and hopefully we could do that again.\u201d"

                    "body": "Argentina We should get out of the group \u2013 then it\u2019s either the mighty France or the excellent Denmark, and all bets are off because we do not know how we measure up against strong European teams. That\u2019s the cold reality. If we can pass that hurdle, we could go to the final. I\u2019m overexcited about the World Cup, but this probably has more to do with everything else being so dire in Argentina that people are in desperate need of good news \u2013 not to mention the government, which is also in desperate need of distractions. And, of course, people are crazy about this team because we finally won a tournament in 2021 after being a shambles up to that point. I love football and the national team so am always excited but, with the World Cup being in Qatar, there are even more reasons than usual to dislike the whole Fifa shadiness. As for Argentina, we have a proper team, which is nothing short of a miracle considering the state we were until a year ago. Victory at the 2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica against Brazil changed everything and I can\u2019t tell you how happy I am for the players (past and present), who always gave everything for the team and had to put up with a lot of undeserved, ungrateful abuse. This team is not all about Lionel Messi, but it\u2019s always going to be all about Messi anyway. If the team can keep functioning as a team when they play against top European opposition, Argentina will be serious contenders. As for Messi, what else is there to say? No one has given so much footballing joy to so many people for so long. Should he win, millions of people all over the world are going to be happy for him, even in countries where there\u2019s very little sympathy for the Argentina national team. That\u2019s something you cannot say about any other single player. Mariano Prunes Australia We will go all the way to the group stage and back, sigh. We could be a headache for reigning champions France in the opening game and Denmark found us a challenge in 2018 but they have improved since. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll beat either team, but with the hallowed \u201cAussie DNA\u201d we can hopefully keep it tight and nick a goal or two. I\u2019m cautiously optimistic about winning our clash with Tunisia. The expectation is that we\u2019ll make life interesting for the European heavyweights and, heaven forbid, get a goal or two from open play. Truth be told, we\u2019re happy to be there and make do with the group stage after taking the scenic route in qualification against Peru. \u2028That said, the controversies surrounding the building of the stadiums, the laws in Qatar and the timing of the event are saddening and worrying. I\u2019m concerned for fan safety as well as that of the players. Player welfare is a big issue given the host of injuries we\u2019ve seen already. In terms of players to look out for we have Aaron Mooy, the Aussie Pirlo, who will be pulling the strings in the middle of the park. We need him to be in form. The same goes for Mat Ryan, a very capable and experienced goalkeeper who will be kept busy. Samuel Morse  Belgium We will probably get out of the group and face either Spain or Germany in the last-16 stage. In both cases we won\u2019t be favourites. Maybe the role of underdog will suit us though. Going beyond the quarter-finals would be a total success considering our ageing golden generation and inexperienced young players. The most worrying area is the defence, where we have a mix of creaking players \u2013 Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen \u2013 and young players such as Zeno Debast, Wout Faes and Arthur Theate. Romelu Lukaku is not fit for the start of the tournament so we need Kevin De Bruyne firing on all cylinders and Thibaut Courtois to be in wall mode. We missed a golden opportunity in 2018. This was a now or never moment. Bernard Hautecler Brazil It\u2019s time for Brazil to win the World Cup. It\u2019s been 20 years since we last won it and Lula had just been elected in 2002 as well, so this must be a sign this is our year. People in Brazil are always optimistic we will win it. Which players should people look out for? Excuse me, but I will not be helping our opponents. In truth, the whole team is playing well in their leagues, so opponents should prepare for all the Canarinhos. Mariana Scalassara Canada Canada have a slight chance of escaping their group (Belgium, Croatia and Morocco), but, if elements line up and they have a little luck and self-belief, they could make it to the knockout round before succumbing to some world power. Canadians are thoroughly stoked about this World Cup, which is a first for this nation. It\u2019s only in the past decade we\u2019ve embraced the sport at a professional level with MLS, the still fledgling Canadian Premier League and a growing immigrant-led population who grew up with a ball at their feet. Also, it\u2019s only been recently that we\u2019ve had full access to watch European soccer, regularly, on television. That goes a long way to fuelling the dreams of kids playing in the back yard on some lumpy, snow-covered pitch in early September. Some of us are old enough to have memories of Dale Mitchell, Tino Lettieri, Bob Lenarduzzi, Carl Valentine et al at the World Cup for Canada in 1986 in Mexico. We had a team based on defence with no scoring whatsoever. Brutal. That has all changed this time. I\u2019m going to try to watch every game of the World Cup, which may affect my sanity and my marriage. David Lennam Croatia Croatia can make it to the quarter-finals at least. There are many players of the new generation who will prove themselves to be worthy of those who made it to the final in 2018. Aside from them, the remaining veterans of 2018 will be there as well. Croats are a sanguine people and being labelled underdogs makes our football team even more competitive and determined.  In terms of players to watch, Dominik Livakovic is not Danijel Subasic but he is the best goalkeeper we have. We will miss Mario Mandzukic but we still have Marcelo Brozovic, Ivan Perisic, Mateo Kovacic and Andrej Kramaric. Domagoj Vida and Dejan Lovren are also returning, and they have shown in recent games that they still have their magic. The new players \u2013 Josko Gvardiol, Lovro Majer, Bruno Petkovic, Mislav Orsic and Borna Sosa \u2013 will not disappoint. I barely have to mention our captain, Luka Modric, who is already an institution. Tomer Nachman-Ribar Denmark Depending on our results in the group stage, we might have a chance to reach the semi-finals. The big \u201cbut\u201d is we may face Argentina before then. If we win the group, beating France \u2013 which is a fair possibility as we have already beaten them twice this year \u2013 then we might go a long way, like last year at the Euros. Fans have a lot of belief as we have an excellent coach, a well-organised team, and some really good players who have known each other for a long time. The atmosphere and relation between the coach, players and fans is ambitious yet relaxed. In other words, very Danish. Anders Mygind England We could top the group, squeak a reasonable last-16 tie against Senegal and comfortably put away France in the quarter-finals. Or, we could be edged out in two international derbies against Wales and the US, and suffer a repeat 2014\u2019s no-show. Choose your own adventure. The mood in England is weird. Despite being the only England manager with a comparable record to Alf Ramsey, and having over-performed in two tournaments while implementing notably different gameplans in each (from dead-ball hopefuls in 2018 to a genuinely smart football team in 2021), it feels as if Southgate has to prove himself all over again. We\u2019ve also managed to misplace about 37 full-backs; has anyone got Danny Rose\u2019s number? Jack Roe  France We\u2019ve gone too far already, simply by going there. The mood at home is aside: \u201cpolitics aside\u201d, \u201cclimate aside\u201d, \u201cethics aside\u201d, \u201cfootball culture aside\u201d and \u201cworld situation aside\u201d. I already feel ashamed for our victory in Russia and I hope France won\u2019t have its name as winners of two of the most shameful World Cups in football history. Clement Blain Germany If Germany reach the semi-finals, I will consider that a success. We have the best coach and goalkeeper, and a formidable attack, yet results have not been coming as expected. The defence has been porous at times, we don\u2019t have world beating wing-backs; and this squad has not demonstrated the killer instinct of previous Germany teams \u2013 that relentless aggression combined with technical capacity that Germany are renowned for. Of course, there is so much talent on the team, I would not be surprised if they win it, and I\u2019m hoping they reach the semis or better. Eric N Iran The hope is that the team will overcome USA and Wales in the group and go through with England to the next stage. Most people think the team will be third in the group. More generally, I hope the world media stops its negative news about my country. I have no idea why should they mix politics with sport \u2013 do we, the people of Iran, deserve being removed from the World Cup because of politics? Ali Badieian Japan  The manager\u2019s goal is to reach the quarter-finals but we\u2019ll be extremely hard-pressed to even get out of the group stage given that the only chance we have is to beat one (or maybe both) of Spain or Germany. There\u2019s room for full-on embarrassment over the course of those three matches; there\u2019s every chance we won\u2019t even win the \u201ceasy\u201d match of the group, against Costa Rica. No one outside of Japan\u2019s setup has any faith whatsoever in the manager. The goal of reaching the last eight is seen as a delusional fever dream among Japan supporters. Fans\u2019 expectations are so low. Just not being humiliated might be enough. Kei Teay Mexico I\u2019ve been following World Cups since in 2002 and have never seen such a pessimistic mood about Mexico\u2019s chances. We always live in hope of reaching the quarter-finals, but this time there is a real fear that we won\u2019t make it out of the group.\u2028 Gerardo Martino started great as a coach, winning and playing nice football, but that has gone. We\u2019ve also had some bad luck. Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez was on his way to becoming one of the best strikers in the world and our top scorer, but he has not been the same after his skull fracture. Players such as Hector Herrera left competitive clubs in Europe for money in the MLS, and that attitude hasn\u2019t helped. \u2028We assume we will lose to Argentina and beat Saudi Arabia, so everything rests on the first game, against Poland. If we make it through, we will face France or Denmark in the round of 16. That should be our way out, in the fourth match, as usual. I want to enjoy this World Cup because it will be the last with 32 teams. I hate the 48-teams idea due to the three teams per group format that opens the door to speculation and leaves a team just waiting for their luck in the last match without playing. That is a terrible idea that won\u2019t work. Francisco Fontano Patan Morocco I think we\u2019ll reach the last eight. Morocco can get out of the group and then beat Spain in the last 16. They showed they can match Spain in the last World Cup. I\u2019m very excited about the tournament because I\u2019m going to be there. I have tickets for all of Morocco\u2019s games and one for the last 16 should they make it. Bouh Mohammed Netherlands The Dutch team isn\u2019t that good, but the coach is. We are difficult to beat and that\u2019s something that can carry a team very far in a tournament. We can make it to the semi-finals, maybe further. Most people believe we have a chance of winning the World Cup There is no real mood at all in the Netherlands. There\u2019s more talk about the host nation, all the abuse there, than the team. Though now that Louis van Gaal has picked his squad the tension is rising a little bit. Last week I saw the first streets with orange decoration. We have a few big talents. Xavi Simons is the rising star. The boy is absolutely fantastic, although he\u2019s just 19 years old. He\u2019s Louis van Gaal\u2019s dark horse, because I think he won\u2019t be a starter in most games. Another big talent is the defender Jurri\u00ebn Timber, who is a starter. Of course Frenkie de Jong, Virgil van Dijk and Memphis Depay are players to look for. And in Luuk de Jong we have probably the best heading striker in the world. Simon van Herpen  Poland Everything depends on our first game, against Mexico. Even though they are a wonderful team, they are missing some of their most crucial players \u2013 but so are we. Because I\u2019m an optimist, I will say that we will finish second in the group and make it to the last 16, where I think we will be eliminated by either France or Denmark We\u2019ve flopped at most recent major tournaments but there is still hope in Poland considering we have perhaps the best striker in the world in Robert Lewandowski. Sebastian Szymanski is definitely a player to watch, as well as Nicola Zalewski. Bartek Hawro Portugal Reaching the quarter-finals would be a pleasant surprise, but the mood is grim given the absurdly conservative style employed by our manager and the shadow that Cristiano Ronaldo is starting to cast over the team. We have maybe our best team ever, but it isn\u2019t being put to use. We struck it lucky at Euros 2016 with the manager but that vibe is past. The nation is eager for this World Cup because one of two things will happen: either this will be our best performance at a World Cup since 2006, or the manager is finally let go and the team will undergo a new cycle, without him and Ronaldo. Fans will genuinely rejoice at either. Ronaldo\u2019s best years are behind him and a genuinely impressive team is being built before our eyes, if only we could take the focus away from him. Jose\u0301 Rodrigues  Spain Reaching the semi-finals would be an amazing achievement but the quarter-finals is more realistic. Spain are in the second tier of teams, alongside England and Germany, but we have a top manager and some of the best young players in Europe. The two Bar\u00e7a stars Pedri and Gavi are full of quality and energy, and their performances could dictate how far Spain go. Luis Enrique\u2019s style means that they don\u2019t tend to play with a reliable goalscorer as the manager values workrate and how forwards contribute to the team. I\u2019d love to see him more of Ansu Fati, who at only 20 could provide vital goalscoring instinct for the team. Oliver Jones  USA Three months ago I would have suggested that USA would cruise into the knockout stages. Our young team came together very well last summer, winning the Concacaf Nations League and Gold Cup, and suddenly had several key players playing in high-profile clubs. But there has been a dip in form for the team and some of the top players, Christian Pulisic especially, are not getting enough games. The striker position is a complete question mark. As usual, fans are divided between the overly optimistic, \u201cU-S-A! U-S-A!\u201d types and those who are realistic about where the youngest squad in the world is in their development. Look out for Yunus Musah, a box-to-box midfielder who plays for Valencia, and Brendan Aaronson of Leeds. Andy Palmquist Uruguay It\u2019s undoubtedly a tough group for La Celeste, who face a difficult opener against South Korea then Portugal and Ghana. Qualification is achievable and an appearance in the last 16 would be excellent. Uruguay are usually defined by a strong collective spirit with the imperious Diego God\u00edn still an influential presence. The team had a not entirely undeserved reputation as being a bit \u201chatchety\u201d in previous World Cups, 1986 and 1990 in particular, but that definition of their style is no longer valid. Qatar is going to be such a surreal experience \u2013 Uruguay may just be the team with the composure to thrive.  Uruguayans are upbeat about the team\u2019s chances. There is excitement about the younger generation coming through. Young Facundo Torres looks an exciting prospect; Rodrigo Bentancur has impressed at Spurs; and I expect God\u00edn to hold the side together. He is the dictionary definition of a seasoned campaigner. John Mageean Wales I\u2019m old enough to remember all the qualification near misses so, even though I disagree with a Qatar World Cup, I\u2019ll be getting behind the boys.  The first game is a must-win. Get past the USA and it sets us up nicely to get out of the group. We should give England a rattle but I doubt we have enough to win that one. Hopefully another win against Iran should see us through, although we can\u2019t take them lightly like Scotland did in 1978. Realistically we will probably meet Netherlands in the last 16. After only losing to them twice by the odd goal in recent Nations League games I reckon we can cause a shock. Both defeats came with goals conceded in injury time. Having said that, I fancy Senegal to surprise a few and they could top their group. I would give us a better chance against the slightly less physical Dutch than the Senegalese. That\u2019s probably the best we can hope for as we\u2019d probably meet France, Denmark or Argentina in the quarter-finals. To reach the finals after so much heartache is massive. The mood in the country is amazing. The Red Wall will travel in full voice and will be fantastic ambassadors for our nation. We won\u2019t win the World Cup but we\u2019ll have a damn good time. I\u2019m very excited but am trying to put the Qatar element in the shade. It should never have been awarded to them and it\u2019s disappointing that a lot of our supporters can\u2019t go because of where it\u2019s being held. I have chosen to stay at home as I\u2019d be a hypocrite if I went but it won\u2019t stop me roaring my support when we\u2019re playing. Andy Davies"

The 32-year-old suffered the injury in Sunday\u2019s 6-3 home win over Manchester United and if it is a blow for his club it stands to be an even bigger one for Gareth Southgate and England.\nSouthgate will name his 26-man squad for the finals in Qatar on 10 November, although the final Fifa deadline is 14 November, meaning he would have scope for late adjustments if problems were to arise in the Premier League games on 12-13 November \u2013 the last weekend before the domestic season pauses. England kick off in Qatar against Iran on 21 November.\n\nIt leaves Walker \u2013 who has 70 caps \u2013 with a little over five weeks to recover his fitness, with the chances of that happening rated as slim. Walker, though, refuses to give up hope.\nSouthgate has said he knows he will lose players before he finalises his squad \u2013 it is inevitable given the crowded nature of the schedule before an unprecedented winter World Cup. But he would not have wanted one of the absentees to be Walker, who he counts on as the right-sided defender in his back three and can also play at right wing-back or right-back in a four.\nWalker\u2019s pace is vital, especially to cover Harry Maguire \u2013 who Southgate continues to trust on the left of the three, despite his struggles for form. John Stones would be the prime candidate to move to the right of the three from the middle, with Eric Dier in the frame to start in the centre.\nStones, also of City, has had his own injury problems and he limped out of England\u2019s 3-3 draw against Germany last week with a hamstring injury. He has not featured since for City.\nSouthgate\u2019s other options in central defence are Conor Coady, Marc Gu\u00e9hi, Fikayo Tomori and, possibly, Ben White. His full-back options on the right are \u2013 in order of preference \u2013 Reece James, Kieran Trippier and Trent Alexander-Arnold.\n\nCity confirmed the surgery to Walker\u2019s left leg and that it had been \u201csuccessful and a more detailed prognosis will be provided in due course\u201d.\nPep Guardiola\u2019s options to replace Walker at right-back include Jo\u00e3o Cancelo, who can switch from left-back, and Stones.\nWalker tweeted: \u201cMy operation on Tuesday was a success and now I can concentrate on my rehab and getting back to full fitness. I will be supporting my teammates every day in any way I can.\u201d"

                    "body": "Welcome to Moving the Goalposts, the Guardian\u2019s free women\u2019s football newsletter. Here\u2019s an extract from this week\u2019s edition. To receive the full version once a week, just pop your email in below:  Linda Caicedo has four layers on but is still feeling the cold. The 17-year-old Colombian wonderkid is in London for a few days with her mother, Herlinda Alegr\u00eda, and is enjoying the anonymity while she can because it is unlikely to last. Currently at Deportivo Cali in her home country, she is likely to join a European club soon, with Barcelona reportedly leading the chase. The Catalan club\u2019s president, Joan Laporta, has confirmed that they have been watching her progress for years but the recent trip to the UK and Germany sparked rumours that Bayern Munich and Chelsea may try to usurp them.  \u201cIt was good for me to get to know a bit of European culture,\u201d she says as we meet after the Arsenal v Chelsea game at the Emirates. \u201cSome people are a little stricter, others are more like us Latinos, but I think this trip was really cool. It was good for me to learn and also help me decide what I want to do in the future.\u201d Before flying back to Colombia, Caicedo and her mother went sightseeing, visiting attractions including the London Eye. They travelled on the tube, bought souvenirs and were able to catch a rare sunny winter day in London. A few days\u2019 break will have been good for the youngest player to be included on the Guardian\u2019s 100 best female footballers list, ranked at No 74, because 2023 promises to be busy. Colombia have qualified for this year\u2019s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand and, barring injury, Caicedo should make her tournament debut against South Korea on 25 July. Remarkably it will be her third World Cup in a year. In August last year she represented Colombia at the Under-20 World Cup, where they reached the quarter-finals, and in October she played in the Under-17 tournament, taking her country to the final, where they lost 1-0 to Spain. It was a first-ever World Cup final for a Colombian team on the men\u2019s or the women\u2019s side.  \u201cIn the Under-17 World Cup we were so close [to winning the whole thing] and I feel we had a great World Cup,\u201d she says. \u201cNow I have a new chance with the senior team. With the national team, I just enjoy it, try to be myself and obviously give my best.\u201d She is now a star player back home and with that comes increased scrutiny. Not that it fazes her. \u201cApart from the external pressure, it\u2019s something in me, something that I must learn to manage,\u201d she adds. \u201cNot only now but also in the future. It\u2019s not about fulfilling other people\u2019s expectations; I need to think about me and about what I want to achieve.\u201d  The national team is well supported at home with more than 15,000 fans at all the games at last year\u2019s Copa Am\u00e9rica Femenina, during which Caicedo scored the winner in the semi-final against Argentina to qualify the team for the World Cup as well as the 2024 Olympics, though they were beaten in the final by Brazil. It was a stark contrast to the situation with the domestic league, where no games have been played since June last year. That drove the players to protest during the Copa Am\u00e9rica, raising their arms before the games. \u201cI admire my teammates so much because we have fought so much for the women\u2019s league,\u201d Caicedo says. \u201cAnd the Copa Am\u00e9rica helped a lot for us to draw attention because then people saw us. In Cali, Bucaramanga and Armenia, where we played, fans were really good to us.\u201d Caicedo has had to overcome adversity before. When she was 15 during the Covid-19 pandemic, she found out that she had ovarian cancer. The diagnosis was shared only with family and her closest friends and the tumour, which was discovered early, was removed. \u201cIt was something we dealt with internally,\u201d she says. \u201cThankfully I overcame it and I\u2019m well now. It was not easy, but with the help of my loved ones, I was ready to go back to playing once doctors told me I was OK. I feel like this is in the past, and now I can follow my path in football.\u201d Where that path will lead her remains to be seen but we are likely to know in February, when she turns 18. \u201cI feel that this is the best moment to leave and take advantage of the fact that I\u2019m turning 18\u201d, she says. \u201cEver since I was a little girl I have dreamed of playing abroad. I don\u2019t just want to grow as a footballer, but also improve myself, like getting to know another culture and learning a new language.\u201d Recommended viewing Cristina Mart\u00edn-Prieto\u2019s classy finish in Sevilla\u2019s Liga F win against Madrid CFF is our pick for the week because \u2026 why not?

                    "body": "Households in the UK spent \u00a31.1bn more on groceries in December than a year earlier, taking Christmas spending to a record \u00a312.8bn, but got fewer items in their baskets as rampant inflation hit home. In a clear indication of how soaring prices are hammering household budgets, the latest monthly report from retail analysts Kantar showed that despite the overall amount shoppers spent rising more than 9%, the volume of sales was down 1% on the same month in 2021. Many stocked up on alcohol to enjoy while watching the men\u2019s football World Cup, with sales of beer reaching the highest level for the year on the day of England\u2019s quarter-final against France on 10 December. However, the most popular shopping day of the year was Friday 23 December \u2013 when more than half of households went to stores or received a delivery.  Last month was the busiest in supermarkets since the coronavirus pandemic, with online sales accounting for a lower proportion of the total festive blowout than last year. Inflation prompted shoppers to cut back on some traditional favourites. The number of mince pies sold barely increased, for example, but the sum spent on them rose by 19%. Only 45% of households bought brussels sprouts, down from 48% a year before. However, the number of Christmas puddings sold rose 6% despite heavy inflation, which meant shoppers spent 16% more in total on the festive dessert. With heavy competition among supermarkets, grocery price inflation slipped to 14.4% in December, from 14.6% in November. The value of sales of groceries to take home \u2013 so not including takeaway sandwiches and drinks \u2013 rose 7.6% in the three months to 25 December, with only sales at Morrisons and Waitrose falling. Fraser McKevitt, the head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said: \u201cThis is the second month in a row that grocery price inflation has fallen, raising hopes that the worst has now passed. However, it\u2019s still a painfully high figure at the current rate, impacting how and what we buy at the shops.\u201d Shoppers continue to seek to combat inflation by turning to supermarket own-label products, where sales rose 13.7%. Sales of premium own-label items were particularly strong, with Aldi and Lidl taking the lead, underpinning total sales growth of 27% and 24% respectively in the three months to Christmas Day \u2013 well ahead of Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda, which reported growth of 6%, 6.2% and 6.4%."

                    "body": "  2.51pm    Right it is less than ten minutes until this afternoon\u2019s games get going, so I am going to wrap up here. Rob Smyth has got you covered for Croatia v Belgium  Barry Glendenning is your man for Canada v Morocco, which is going to be my poison of choice on the old tellybox this afternoon.  I hope you enjoy today\u2019s matches, and I will see you here again tomorrow.     2.35pm    Serbia coach Dragan Stojkovic hopes to find holes in Switzerland\u2019s defences, like in their famous cheese, when they meet in their final World Cup Group G game as they bid to qualify for the knockout stages for the first time. Bottom side Serbia sit two points behind second-placed Switzerland and must win to have any hope of progressing to the last 16, while the Swiss would need only a draw if Cameroon do not beat Brazil. Asked if Serbia would be up against a Swiss side that ticked over with the precision of their famous watches, Stojkovic said on Thursday he would rather compare them to Swiss cheese and exploit the \u201choles\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019d really like to talk about their cheese and find their weak spots \u2013 the holes \u2013 to get the result we aspire to,\u201d Reuters reports Stojkovic told reporters ahead of Friday\u2019s game at Stadium 974. \u201cWe knew after the draw was held that Brazil is an entirely different dimension and we would be fighting for second place with Cameroon and Switzerland. These forecasts brought us to this point. \u201cWe knew the match with Switzerland would be of major importance as the last one in the group, and this is what we\u2019re now faced with. We\u2019ve witnessed a lot of surprises at this World Cup, but we will be ready.\u201d  Stojkovic said Dusan Vlahovic is fit after missing the first two games, but would not confirm if the Juventus forward would be named in the starting lineup alongside Mitrovic. \u201cVlahovic is ready for the match and his physical state is a lot better than it was when we came to Doha. He could start tomorrow but I cannot share this with you today,\u201d Stojkovic said. \u201cAs for the formation, we will see tomorrow. One, two or three attackers \u2013 all options are on the table. Whatever we decide, they have to play together as a team. Since I became head coach, it has always been about team spirit.     2.21pm    Definitely one of those Marmite players, Luis Su\u00e1rez has stressed he would not be apologising for his handball in Uruguay\u2019s 2010 World Cup quarter-final against Ghana as the sides prepare to meet again on Friday. The clash at the tournament in South Africa 12 years ago saw Suarez sent off in the final moments of extra-time, with the score at 1-1, after keeping out a Dominic Adiyiah header on the line with his hands. The resulting penalty was struck against the bar by Asamoah Gyan, and Uruguay then won the subsequent shootout. PA Media reports that at his press briefing today in Qatar, the 35-year-old forward said: \u201cI don\u2019t apologise about that because I did the handball, but the Ghana player missed the penalty, not me. \u201cMaybe I can say an apology if I did a tackle, injured a player, and took a red card. But in this situation, I took a red card, the ref said penalty, (and) it\u2019s not my fault, because I didn\u2019t miss the penalty. \u201cThe player who missed the penalty, he said he would do the same in this situation. It\u2019s not my responsibility, to shoot the penalty.\u201d Suarez was then asked if he had thought, with Ghana looking for revenge, what the game on Friday could be like for him, and he said: \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t really thought about this. \u201cI don\u2019t know what people are saying, whether they are saying this, revenge. But players that will play tomorrow might be eight years old back then. \u201cSome people might say \u2018the devil himself\u2019, \u2018he did that\u2019 \u2026 We can\u2019t misunderstand things. \u201cWe won against Portugal in 2018 \u2013 have we heard Portuguese people saying \u2018we need revenge\u2019? No. What I did with (Italy\u2019s Giorgio) Chiellini \u2013 I played against him afterwards. I made a mistake, and then we shook hands. You can\u2019t just keep thinking about the past and just focus on revenge.\u201d     1.58pm    Pick the bones out of this: Belgium coach Roberto Martinez has dropped captain Eden Hazard and resisted the temptation to start lead striker Romelu Lukaku in their decisive World Cup Group F fixture against Croatia on Thursday, Reuters reports. Defender Leander Dendoncker, wing-back Yannick Carrasco and attacking midfielders Leandro Trossard and Dries Mertens come into the side in a major shake-up from Martinez that sees Kevin De Bruyne wear the skipper\u2019s armband. Croatia have kept their same starting XI from the team that thumped Canada 4-1 in their previous fixture, with captain Luka Modric again the key man.      1.54pm   Team news: Croatia v Belgium  Croatia: Dominik Livakovic, Ivan Perisic, Dejan Lovren, Mateo Kovacic, Andrej Kramaric, Luka Modric, Marcelo Brozovic, Marko Livaja, Borna Sosa, Josko Gvardiol, Josip Juranovic Belgium: Thibaut Courtois, Timothy Castagne, Jan Vertonghen, Toby Alderweireld, Thomas Meunier, Axel Witsel, Yannick Carrasco, Dries Mertens, Kevin De Bruyne, Leandro Trossard, Leander Dendoncker You have to wonder how many of this XI may be playing their last match for Belgium if they don\u2019t get the result they need today. Belgium need to win to be assured qualification. A draw may be enough, but only if already eliminated Canada beat Morocco, and even then it will come down to goal difference. A draw is enough for Croatia to progress. You will be able to follow all of this on our MBM with Rob Smyth \u2026   Updated at 1.56pm GMT    1.53pm   Team news: Canada v Morocco  Goalkeeper Yassine Bounou returns for Morocco after pulling out of the Belgium game at the last moment. Canada: Milan Borjan (c), Alistair Johnston, Samuel Adekugbe, Kamal Miller, Steven Vitoria, Junior Hoilett, Tajon Buchanan, Mark-Anthony Kaye, Cyle Larin, Alphonso Davies, Jonathan Osorio Morocco: Yassine Bounou, Achraf Hakimi, Noussair Mazraoui, Sofyan Amrabat, Nayef Aguerd, Romain Saiss (c), Hakim Ziyech, Azzedine Ounahi, Abdelhamid Sabiri, Soufiane Boufal, Youssef En-Nesyri A reminder, a draw will be enough to qualify. If they lose, but Croatia win against Belgium, they would still progress. If they lose and Belgium draw with Croatia, or they lose and Belgium beat Croatia, it would come down to goal difference whether they still progressed. Barry Glendenning is at the MBM controls for this one \u2026  Also I want to give a shout-out to my friend Marie Le Conte, who I have previously sat and watched Morocco games with for a World Cup. She made the decision to boycott watching the Qatar event, as many people did, and \u2026 well \u2026   Updated at 1.54pm GMT    1.47pm    With the caveat that I haven\u2019t verified the video, this clip of reaction to an Argentina goal in a airport has made me properly laugh out loud. You\u2019ll need the sound up.      1.43pm    I felt Poland were playing some curious new breed of anti-football yesterday, defending desperately to hang on to a 2-0 defeat. Sid Lowe is in Doha for the Guardian and writes on the topic: At times it was a surreal sight. Rather than chasing a goal \u2013 \u201cI was a defender first today,\u201d Robert Lewandowski said \u2013 Poland decided the best approach was for nothing to happen. But how do you defend for your lives without making a tackle? How do you run down the clock without running up the cards? With a little help from Argentina perhaps? \u201cIt did go through my head to go to those who play in Italy but I thought it would be ugly to do that,\u201d Napoli midfielder Piotr Zielinski said. \u201cIt was strange. We produced an ugly game and we have to improve now that we are going to face the world champions. So far we haven\u2019t shown how well we can play. We have given the ball to our opponents and we have to change. Against France it will be different. We have to have more courage, more will to do them damage. We could have paid for [the approach] but we\u2019re very happy. It\u2019s been more than 30 years since we got through a group.\u201d Read more here: Sid Lowe \u2013 \u2018Don\u2019t get cards\u2019: How Poland\u2019s strange World Cup progression played out      1.31pm    Portugal coach Fernando Santos said that Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s availability is still in question for their closing Group H match against South Korea on Friday. The 37-year-old Portugal captain missed Wednesday\u2019s practice and stayed at the gym to do recovery and specific exercises and, with his team already through to the knockout stages, he could be rested against South Korea even if fit. \u201cI think it is 50-50 if he plays or not, we\u2019ll see,\u201d Reuters reports Santos told a news conference on Thursday. \u201cIt will depend on if and how he practices today, if we see he is in good condition \u2026 There is a plan for if he is not available.\u201d Santos confirmed that defender Nuno Mendes will miss the rest of World Cup after the player left the pitch in tears against Uruguay when he sustained a thigh injury. \u201cUnfortunately he is out but by his will he will stay with us. It was his desire, his club agreed, and he will start his recovery here. His enormous desire to stay with us reflects the state of mind of the whole squad,\u201d he said.     1.19pm    South Korea\u2019s Portuguese coach Paulo Bento will sing both national anthems tomorrow before his side bid to recreate their result of the 2002 World Cup and beat his home nation Portugal. PA Media quotes Bento at his press briefing this morning saying: \u201cI do have feelings, of course, in relation to the Korean national anthem but I think I will sing the Portuguese national anthem as well. \u201cI was born Portuguese, I will die Portuguese and I am very proud of my nationality - but also I am very proud of coaching these players for more than four years now.\u201d South Korea beat Portugal 1-0 in Incheon to guarantee that the 2002 co-hosts progressed at the expense of the European side \u2013 and it had a special significance for Bento. \u201cIt was my last match as an international player so that\u2019s the memory I have, being proud regardless of a specific match, as I was able to represent my country in a World Cup regardless of specific results,\u201d he said.  The former Benfica and Sporting midfielder will serve a touchline ban having received a red card after South Korea\u2019s game with Ghana ended, but he said does not believe his absence from the technical area will adversely effect his players.     12.58pm    Jacob Steinberg is in Doha for the Guardian, and he was watching the England media round this morning with Declan Rice, who had some things about his domestic career to say, as well as discussing England\u2019s prospects: Rice is in line to start when England face Senegal in the last 16 of the World Cup on Sunday and he insisted that the big nations should be worried about Gareth Southgate\u2019s side. \u201cI think other nations will always look at us and think about the quality we\u2019ve got in the squad,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy should we not be feared? If you look at our attacking players, there are world-class, unbelievable talents across the board. Across the whole team. There are players who have played in the biggest games and won the biggest trophies. We are one of the biggest teams here. But it\u2019s down to us to prove it on the pitch.\u201d Read more here: Jacob Steinberg \u2013 Declan Rice indicates he wants to leave West Ham as he outlines ambitions      12.41pm    We have a very fun gallery here of behind the scenes in the England camp with a delightful cameo from an England striker from years-gone-by, and most importantly, an indication that England\u2019s players appear to be practising every sport under the sun except football.      12.38pm    Emma Kemp reports for the Guardian from Doha: Australia and Argentina have criticised Fifa for scheduling their last-16 match only three days after their final World Cup group games, saying the short turnaround treats players like \u201crobots\u201d. The Socceroos defeated Denmark on Wednesday night and now face a high-profile knockout clash with Lionel Messi and Argentina on Saturday at 10pm local time. Argentina have even less time to recover, having played their 2-0 win against Poland from 10pm \u2013 four hours after Australia\u2019s 6pm kick-off against Denmark \u2013 in a situation described as \u201ccrazy\u201d by their coach, Lionel Scaloni. \u201cHow can the Fifa organisation [do this] at such a high-prestige tournament,\u201d said the Socceroos assistant coach, Ren\u00e9 Meulensteen. \u201cThe four-day turnovers were already short, and after the group stages they go even shorter. If you want high-quality performance in a World Cup, you think could they have managed it slightly differently.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s something Fifa needs to consider, that we\u2019re not robots, that we are humans and that we do need to recover,\u201d said the Socceroos defender Milo\u0161 Degenek. \u201cThat we can\u2019t just play day after day. You know, we need a break as well. Scaloni, too, was critical after Wednesday\u2019s late-night result, which confirmed Argentina\u2019s progression as winners of Group C and set up the date with Australia \u2013 Group D\u2019s runners-up. \u201cToday we are happy but not euphoric, because I think it\u2019s crazy we are playing in just over two days,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t really understand this.\u201d Read more here: Emma Kemp \u2013 Australia and Argentina criticise Fifa over \u2018crazy\u2019 World Cup scheduling      12.04pm    I imagine, like me, you have some strong opinions about the penalty that was given against Wojciech Szczesny for touching Lionel Messi\u2019s face last night. Reuters is carrying some quotes from Szczesny about the incident, which a VAR review deemed sufficient contact to be a penalty.  Szczesny has told TVP Sport in Poland that \u201cI immediately told the referee that I touched his face with my hand, but I only ran over the side of his face. I told him that the contact was there, but in my opinion there was no penalty.\u201d He went on to say \u201cThe referee decided otherwise and that\u2019s good - I was able to show off. \u201cOn some penalties Leo looks at the goalkeeper and on some he hits hard. I knew that if he was going to hit hard, it was more to my left. I saw that he didn\u2019t stop, so I went (left), I sensed it and I saved. I\u2019m happy.\u201d Szczesny became the first goalkeeper to save two penalties at a World Cup tournament since American Brad Friedel in 2002 and only the third in all, along with compatriot Jan \u201cBrian Clough called me a clown\u201d Tomaszewski, who first achieved the feat in 1974.     11.53am    I\u2019ve got no context for this picture which has just dropped on the wires except that it says \u201cEngland\u2019s Declan Rice throws a dart during a game against a member of the media ahead of a press conference\u201d      11.50am    By the way if you are 1) a big fan of international sport jamborees and 2) a bit lost for what to do until the 3pm GMT kick offs get going, the ticket ballot has just opened for the Paris 2024 Olympics. You can sign up here. Although to be honest it looks like there is a huge queue at the moment and you\u2019ve got until the end of January to do it. Here are the details \u2026      11.26am    A lot of the attention on Group E has fallen on Germany\u2019s woes going into the final round of matches, but Spain have still left themselves something to do despite coming firing out of the blocks with that 7-0 spanking of Costa Rica on matchday one. We had this yesterday from Ben McAleer on how Spain\u2019s creative decision to play Rodri in defence is paying off: The dilemma for Spain, as usual, is that they have too many brilliant central midfielders. Gavi and Pedri, despite their youth, are guaranteed starters considering their technical quality, and they benefit from having their experienced Barcelona teammate, Sergio Busquets, alongside them to anchor the midfield. Busquets, the only World Cup winner in the squad, is now 34 but we all saw how much Spain struggled without him at the Euros last year. It\u2019s a tricky one for Luis Enrique: he doesn\u2019t want to lose his captain but he knows Busquets no longer has the legs to control the middle of the park. Given the make-up of his squad, Luis Enrique\u2019s decision to pick Busquets at the base of the midfield and use Rodri in the centre of defence could be a masterstroke. Rodri was used at the heart of defence by Pep Guardiola \u2013 obviously \u2013 on a handful of occasions in the 2019-20 campaign, but he is inexperienced in the role. Throwing him in at the deep end at a World Cup was a risk, but Rodri has handled it well. At 6ft 2in, he has the physicality to play the role and he is brilliant at dispossessing opponents \u2013 only Declan Rice (82) has won possession in the midfield third more times than Rodri (70) in the Premier League this season. Rodri has the tools to excel at centre-back in the modern game, given his tenacity off the ball and impressive distribution when in possession. Read more here: Ben McAleer \u2013 Spain\u2019s creative decision to play Rodri in defence is paying off at World Cup      11.14am    Switzerland have been out training in front of the cameras today ahead of tomorrow\u2019s heavyweight eliminator against Serbia. It is bound to be a quiet game, what with the memories of Xherdan Shaqiri and Granit Xhaka\u2019s double-eagle celebrations in the same fixture in Russia 2018 fresh in Serbian memory.    Fifa ended up fining Xhaka and Shaqiri 10,000 Swiss francs (the equivalent then of \u00a37,632) each after that match in Kaliningrad.     11.04am    SHAMELESS SELF-PROMOTION KLAXON: Every Thursday at 11am I publish the official Guardian Thursday quiz\u2122 which is 15 questions on general knowledge and vaguely topical issues crammed full of in-jokes and also usually features my dog. This week\u2019s edition is #84, and you can get stuck into it here \u2026      10.53am    If you are a fan of passing diagrams, then Opta have an Argentina one for you this morning that you are going to love. Unless you are a Poland fan I guess.      10.43am    In case you needed some Phil Foden and Jack Grealish this morning, here they are kicking the ball to each other \u2026      10.23am    England\u2019s Declan Rice has been prodded in front of the media to give some quotes, and he has said that coach Gareth Southgate has a selection headache ahead of Sunday\u2019s round of 16 match with Senegal. Asked about the competition between Bukayo Saka, Raheem Sterling, Marcus Rashford and Phil Foden to play up top with Harry Kane, the West Ham midfielder said:  What is so good about our group here is we are all so supportive of each other. There is probably a selection headache for the manager but whoever he picks, I know everyone will be rooting for each other. It is a real team effort now. I think it is top level. It is always nice to know you can bring players off the bench who can instantly change a game, we have got world-class players who can come on and throughout a World Cup you need that quality.       10.12am    We could be seeing a bit of a Johnstone\u2019s Paint Trophy-style squad rotation from Brazil tomorrow in their final group game, according to a report from APs Tales Azzoni. I mean, he didn\u2019t put it exactly like that, but you catch my drift. It is possible that coach Tite will make as many as 11 changes from the team which dispatched Swizerland. According to AP, he is planning to use only reserve players, starting with Ederson replacing Alisson in goal. Veteran Dani Alves is among those coming into the defence, while Fabinho is set to play in the midfield. Antony and Gabriel Martinelli are expected to be added to the attack. Tite wants to try to give playing time to all seven players who were yet to appear at the tournament. \u201cTite had already told us after the game against Switzerland that he intended to make changes in the lineup,\u201d midfielder Fabinho said. \u201cHe said he wanted everyone to play and we are happy with that decision.\u201d Stats nerds will get excited by the fact that 39-year-old Alves could become the oldest Brazilian to play at a World Cup, ahead of the 38-year-old Thiago Silva, and that with just a point, Brazil will win its World Cup group for the 11th straight time. The last time Brazil failed to win a group was in the rarely mentioned 1966 tournament, when Portugal and Hungary finished first and second in Group 3 and knocked them out.     9.52am    I know I am boring about these things, but it is really offending me deep in my soul that not only don\u2019t the group stages end in the correct alphabetical sequence, but Fifa have also jiggled around the matches in the R16 and quarter-finals so that \u201cMatch 52\u201d takes place before \u201cMatch 51\u201d. *shudders* Anyway, to avoid any confusion, and so you can start planning, here is how your weekend\u2019s football viewing is shaping up:  Match 49 \u2013 Saturday 3 December 3pm GMT: Netherlands v USA Match 50 \u2013 Saturday 3 December 7pm GMT: Argentina v Australia Match 52 *eye twitches* \u2013 Sunday 4 December 3pm GMT: France v Poland Match 51 \u2013 Sunday 4 December 7pm GMT: England v Senegal  Those eight teams will be hoping to head to these quarter-final fixtures:  Match 57 \u2013 Friday 9 December 7pm GMT: Netherland/USA v Argentina/Australia Match 59 \u2013 Saturday 10 December 7pm GMT: England/Senegal v France/Poland      9.44am    I mentioned St\u00e9phanie Frappart earlier, who will become the first woman to referee a match at a men\u2019s senior level World Cup finals. Fifa have put out a quick video of her from earlier in the year, when it was announced she would be going to Qatar. In it, Frappart says:  I felt enormous emotion because it wasn\u2019t particularly expected that I would be nominated. So, a lot of pride, a lot of honour to represent France at the World Cup. I think I\u2019ll have everything that\u2019s around me in mind, and the aim will still be the same, that is to referee well, and have a good performance on the pitch. So, I\u2019m really going to head into this with enormous emotion. But you have to channel that, because clearly the most important thing is the pitch. The first thing will be all the emotions of entering a World Cup stadium, packed with a large crowd with plenty of expectations. But after that I\u2019ll be focused on the pitch, because we need to make the correct decisions, and perform well by concentrating on the primary objective: the pitch.       9.23am    Elis James has actually made me laugh out loud at my desk with the line \u201cUnlike the writers in some other newspapers, I am able to experience two emotions at once, with neither being anger\u201d. Here he is with his reflections on a disappointing campaign for Wales that he still feels immensely proud of: Enormous pride that we qualified. Incredible disappointment that we are going home. But it is disappointment with context. It is far better to get knocked out of a World Cup than not to get to one in the first place. What was so frustrating about the great qualification failures of my time as a supporter \u2013 Euro 92, USA 94, Euro 2004 and Russia 2018 \u2013 was the feeling of unfinished business, a cosmic unfairness that prevented footballers who were good enough to play on the biggest stage from doing so. On the BBC Gary Lineker asked Ian Rush what the younger members of the Wales squad will have learned from Qatar. After talking briefly about the atmosphere, Rush said: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I never played at a World Cup.\u201d Rush scored 346 career goals for Liverpool, won the European Cup and European Golden Boot, and yet failed at the final hurdle for his country. Tuesday night has to be better than that. Read more here: Elis James \u2013 Wales fans feel pride and despair but not anger after swift World Cup exit      9.13am    In Germany, Die Zeit\u2019s World Cup briefing has very generously picked Croatia v Belgium at 3pm GMT as the match of the day, rather than the pressing issue of Costa Rica v Germany at 7pm GMT. Tammo Blomberg also has a rather tongue-in-cheek suggestion. St\u00e9phanie Frappart will become the first woman to referee at a men\u2019s World Cup finals in the Germany game, and Blomberg quotes Fifa referee boss Pierluigi Collina saying it is \u201cproof that quality and not gender counts\u201d. Blomberg suggests that if that is the case, maybe Germany could address their shyness in front of goal by drafting in Alexandra Popp, who has just the 61 goals behind her in her 124 caps for Germany\u2019s women.      8.54am    Paul MacInnes was at the Al Janoub Stadium for the Guardian yesterday, and this morning he has these words on that sorry exit by Denmark, who had been hotly tipped to go far before a ball was kicked in Qatar: Was it the expectations? Was it the armbands? Was it the tinkering? Or did Denmark just not have what it took to progress as expected at this World Cup? The postmortem can now begin for the team ranked 10th in the world, because Kasper Hjulmand\u2019s men are going home. The absence of Simon Kj\u00e6r will not have helped in terms of mental resilience, the captain proving so crucial in galvanising Denmark last year. But it was surely also the case that Hjulmand made some bad decisions during the tournament. Speaking after the match the coach did not stint in criticising the levels of performance. \u201cIt\u2019s a big disappointment and it\u2019s not going to be good to look back on,\u201d he said. But when he does pore over the videos \u2013 providing the Danish Football Association does not intercede first \u2013 Hjulmand may reflect on why he had clearly not settled on a preferred attacking system before the tournament, instead changing shape and personnel up front for each of the three matches, with an attendant shift in approach. Read more here: Paul MacInnes \u2013 Expectations, tactics, armbands: Denmark\u2019s Qatar postmortem begins     8.39am   Group F: What do Belgium, Croatia and Morocco need to do to reach the next round?  Belgium have it all to do against Croatia, while Morocco just need to focus on their own game to make World Cup history. Group F \u2013 Belgium, Canada, Croatia, Morocco Final matches Thursday 1 December, 3pm GMT: Canada v Morocco, Croatia v Belgium Croatia: A draw is enough for Croatia to qualify. They may still qualify if they lose, if Canada beat Morocco, depending on the margins of the respective victories. Morocco: A draw will be enough to qualify. If they lose, but Croatia win against Belgium, they would still progress. If they lose and Belgium draw with Croatia, or they lose and Belgium beat Croatia, it would come down to goal difference whether they still progressed. Belgium: Belgium need to win to be assured qualification. A draw may be enough, but only if Canada beat Morocco, and even then it will come down to goal difference. Canada have been eliminated, but as co-hosts next time round will be looking to show they belong in this company.     8.35am   Group E: What do Costa Rica, Germany, Japan and Spain need to do to reach the next round?  Despite thumping Costa Rica 7-0, Spain still haven\u2019t quite done it yet, and despite being bottom of the group, Germany might be feeling more confident than you\u2019d expect. Group E \u2013 Costa Rica, Germany, Japan, Spain Final matches Thursday 1 December, 7pm GMT: Costa Rica v Germany, Japan v Spain Spain: A draw will be enough for Spain to progress. However, if they lose and Costa Rica beat Germany, they will be eliminated \u2013 which would be a huge shock after opening the tournament with a 7-0 win. Japan: A win against Spain will see Japan qualify. A draw means they are relying on Costa Rica and Germany drawing to progress. If Japan draw and Costa Rica win, Japan are out. If Japan draw and Germany win by just one goal, whoever has scored the most goals will go through. If Japan draw, and Germany win by more than one goal, Japan are out. Costa Rica: A win will put Costa Rica through. A draw will be enough if Spain also beat Japan. If Japan get a draw, Costa Rica\u2019s vastly inferior goal difference means they would not progress. Germany: The Germans can qualify if they beat Costa Rica and Spain beats Japan. A draw is of no use to Die ex-Mannschaft     8.28am    Some pictures have just dropped on the wires of South Korea in training today ahead of their crunch match tomorrow. The Taegeuk Warriors face Portugal at 3pm GMT tomorrow knowing that a win is necessary, but they also have to hope that results go their way elsewhere. It is a tough ask, you feel.        8.15am    Jonathan Liew is in Doha for the Guardian, and this morning he casts his eye over the situation that Germany find themselves in ahead of their decisive clash with Costa Rica: Take the lack of a natural striker, an ongoing source of introspection in Germany and one brought into sharper focus in recent years. From Gerd M\u00fcller to Karl-Heinz Rummenigge to J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann to Miroslav Klose; the dominant, masculine No 9 is a central part of the mythology of German football. And so for many, the absence of world-class centre-forwards \u2013 generally believed to be a product of a youth development system that prioritises versatility and technical excellence over specialism \u2013 is emblematic of something deeper; a dilution of German identity, a divergence from tradition. By the same token, the rise of the veteran Niclas F\u00fcllkrug \u2013 the stalwart Werder Bremen striker who was playing second-division football until this season \u2013 has been interpreted as a return to core values. \u201cThe German virtues, which we had been missing a bit lately, are back,\u201d wrote Lothar Matth\u00e4us after F\u00fcllkrug\u2019s emphatic equaliser against Spain on Sunday night. Perhaps this feeds into a wider debate about whether, in an age of porous borders and the increasing fluidity of ideas, there remains such a thing as a national footballing identity. And if so, what is Germany\u2019s? \u201cI do believe there are identities,\u201d Flick said on Wednesday. \u201cPerhaps the nuances have changed in recent years. We want to have high intensity, be active and have possession. We want to force the opponent to make mistakes, which means we sometimes press hard. We want to stand for attractive and modern attacking football.\u201d Read more here: Jonathan Liew \u2013 Germany face questions that cut to heart of identity before Costa Rica tie      8.11am    One sad note that has come out of last night\u2019s Australia match is the confirmation from Football Australia that defender Bailey Wright\u2019s mother-in-law has died. Wright came out with an emotional statement in the immediate aftermath of his team\u2019s 1-0 victory over Denmark, saying \u201cI\u2019ve just come in from a message from my wife. I just want to dedicate this to my wife, bless her, and her mum. I\u2019ll be honest, I\u2019m not sure if she\u2019s still with us.\u201d  \u201cIt was, for them, a really tough time back home, but ultimately it made this possible for me to be here and live one of my dreams so I dedicate that to Tammy.\u201d Reuters reports that Wright said he had not told his teammates about his worries back home. \u201cNo one knows. That\u2019s something I\u2019ve kept to myself; we*ve all got a lot going on. Job to do, isn*t it? You\u2019ve got to be professional all the time,\u201d he added. Football Australia confirmed on Thursday morning that Wright\u2019s mother-in-law had died and the defender would not appear for media.     8.03am    It was another late night for Max and the gang in the pod. If you haven\u2019t caught it yet, then here is the latest daily episode of Football Weekly. Joining Max Rushden are John Brewin, Philippe Auclair, Mark Langdon, Marcela Mora y Araujo and Emma Kemp to dissect the final action in Groups C and D.      8.00am   Preamble  Today is the day we sort out Group E and Group F, which means this evening it is crunch time for Germany, the possibility of an unlikely redemption for Costa Rica, Japan sweating on results elsewhere if they can\u2019t get a second win, and Spain still not guaranteed a second round place. Before all that, Belgium\u2019s golden generation face their last hurrah, Croatia still have some work to do, Morocco will be hoping to progress from a group for the first time since 1986, and Canada want to show they will not \u201cdo a Qatar\u201d as co-hosts in four year\u2019s time. Here is what we have to look forward to:  Croatia v Belgium and Canada v Morocco at 3pm GMT Japan v Spain and Costa Rica v Germany at 7pm GMT  We will, of course, have MBMs for them all. Before then there\u2019s the fallout from last night, media appearances from all the teams playing in tomorrow\u2019s final round of group games, plus any other nonsense that occurs to me along the way.

                    "body": "For Osian Roberts it was too good an offer to turn down. When the coach once described as the most influential man in Welsh football was invited to Rabat in the summer of 2019 to meet Fouzi Lekjaa, the president of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation, he was whisked off on a tour of the Complexe Mohammed VI Maamoura \u2013 the state-of-the-art national training centre that would officially open a few months later.\nRoberts swiftly signed up as the federation\u2019s technical director and the two years he spent in the job mean he is looking on from afar at the team\u2019s remarkable World Cup achievements with particular excitement and satisfaction.\n\u201cI was absolutely convinced and wanted to be fully onboard because of the passion he [Lekjaa] has for football in Morocco \u2013 that\u2019s what sold it to me,\u201d says Roberts, now assistant manager at Crystal Palace. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just a wish or a dream. There was a plan behind it in order to achieve success. For me it was just a wonderful opportunity to develop football further in Morocco and become one of the leading nations in Africa that everybody could aspire to work towards. It almost felt like an obligation for me to jump on the bus and drive it forward.\u201d\n\nThe Atlas Lions will make history on Wednesday when they become the first African team to contest a World Cup semi-final. Led by the Paris-born manager Walid Regragui, a side made up of homegrown stars including the dashing midfielder Azzedine Ounahi and barnstorming striker Youssef En-Nesyri, and players drawn from the country\u2019s wide diaspora, such as Hakim Ziyech and Achraf Hakimi, face the world champions, France. According to Roberts, their success is no accident.\n\u201cMorocco is very serious about its football and the level of investment over the last 10 years has been quite astounding,\u201d he says. \u201cSome of these players at the World Cup have graduated from the Mohamed VI youth academy but since then the national training centre has been built and was inaugurated by the king while I was there. It\u2019s an unbelievable facility that is as good as anything in the world. At the same time they have opened five regional centres for the best boys and girls in the country.\u201d\n\nEn-Nesyri \u2013 who scored the winning goal against Portugal in the quarter-finals \u2013 was the original poster boy for the academy named after the football-mad reigning monarch that opened in 2009 and has produced Ounahi, the defender Nayaf Aguerd of West Ham and the third-choice goalkeeper Ahmed Reda Tagnaouti. Competition for places is fierce, with the academy\u2019s sides playing matches in Morocco\u2019s amateur leagues and in youth tournaments around Europe. There are close links with clubs in Spain and France, such as M\u00e1laga \u2013 where Sevilla\u2019s En-Nesyri began his career in Europe \u2013 and Ouhani\u2019s Angers.\n\n\u201cThey have made it easier for players to find a pathway to Europe \u2013 some have succeeded and some have not,\u201d says Abdellah Aarab, who owns the Moroccan football website almarssadpro.com. \u201cFor many years we used to see our best players go to the Gulf leagues for the money rather than try to develop their careers at smaller European clubs first.\u201d\nRoberts believes vast improvements in the standard of coaching in Morocco have made an important difference, particularly for Regragui, who won the domestic title with FUS and Wydad Casablanca. \u201cThere was a tendency for most opportunities to go to more experienced coaches but now to see him as a young coach coming through and succeeding at this level is so important,\u201d Roberts says.\nThe former Morocco defender was, with Senegal\u2019s Aliou Ciss\u00e9, part of the first pro-licence run by the Confederation of African Football and graduated in June, two months before he replaced Vahid Halilhodzic. \u201cThe course had started before I arrived but I continued that course and it actually finished after I left for Palace,\u201d Roberts says. \u201cDuring my time there we had Roberto Mart\u00ednez, Patrick Vieira and Thierry Henry deliver modules for the students, and of course Regragui was one of them.\u201d\n\nMorocco\u2019s group-stage victory over Belgium was therefore even more embarrassing for Mart\u00ednez but he is not the only manager outwitted by Regragui at this World Cup. The cosmopolitan Regragui has united a squad that speaks several languages including Darija (the Moroccan dialect of Arabic), French, Spanish and even English. \u201cThere are a few players in the squad who are Berbers or Amazigh that grew up in the Netherlands and they speak Berber more at home with their parents,\u201d Aarab says. \u201cWith them he is communicating more in English.\u201d\nFourteen players in Morocco\u2019s squad were born overseas. Most were identified by the extensive scouting system established by Lekjaa and Roberts\u2019s predecessor as technical director, Nasser Larguet.\n\n\u201cWe had full-time scouts in Holland, Germany, France, Spain and Scandinavia that are monitoring these players on a regular basis,\u201d says Roberts. \u201cThere was a database for all of those who were eligible for Morocco in all those countries ... it was necessary given the amount of players living overseas. That department has been extremely important.\u201d\nThree France youth internationals \u2013 Amine Adli of Bayer Leverkusen, Nice\u2019s Sofiane Diop and Mohamed-Ali Cho, a Real Sociedad striker once on Everton\u2019s books \u2013 are thought to be next on the federation\u2019s radar. \u201cWhen you bring young players to the country and you want to convince them to play for Morocco then it really helps to see such a professional training base like you see in western Europe or Qatar,\u201d says the Moroccan pundit Jalal Bounouar.\nRoberts said Morocco should aim to be in the world\u2019s top 20 when he stepped down in June 2021, and it is not only the senior men\u2019s side who have exceeded expectations. The women\u2019s team lost to South Africa in the Africa Cup of Nations final on home soil in July and the men\u2019s futsal team are reigning Arab and African champions and reached the world championships quarter-finals last year.\n\n\u201cI just felt the level of expectation needed to be raised because of the infrastructure and the talent that exists in the country,\u201d says Roberts, who spent almost 10 years at the Football Association of Wales and was Chris Coleman\u2019s assistant for the run to the Euro 2016 semi-finals. \u201cHaving worked with Wales for such a long time, we went from 117th in the world to eighth and then managed to sustain it with good planning and a vision of where we wanted to go. Likewise for Morocco now \u2013 this can\u2019t be a one-off.\u201d\nRoyal Air Maroc is operating 30 special flights for supporters to join the estimated 40,000 already in Qatar. Roberts will watch at home and says Vieira \u2013 the former France midfielder who is now his boss at Palace \u2013 is concerned about facing Regragui\u2019s side. \u201cHe\u2019s not so confident about this game as he has been. He knows: he\u2019s been in that situation where they have found it difficult in those games. Patrick always said when he played for France they always found it difficult playing against African teams. They knew they would raise the level against them and were so motivated and you could see it in their faces. That might prove to be the case again.\u201d"

                    "body": "Everyone has a Grant Wahl story. This was never more true than on Friday night, when messages of love, support, shock, and grief poured out across social media with the news of his sudden death while covering the World Cup in Qatar. On Twitter, I remarked that for other journalists, he was a mentor and a cheerleader. And for readers, he was compelling, smart, and educational. Others echoed my sentiments: there are thousands of posts detailing how Grant helped others, the advice he gave them, what he was like as friend, and their favourite article of his (it should be noted, I have yet to see the same piece posted twice). Even if Grant didn\u2019t know it, everyone has a Grant Wahl story. Here\u2019s mine.  Like many other new media journalists, I first met Grant over Twitter. In 2011, I had it in my head that I was going to try to run for Fifa president. Someone suggested that I speak to Grant, who had made a similar attempt in protest at the presidency of Sepp Blatter. I tweeted him for advice, not expecting a response. But Grant replied. And he replied with kindness, advice, and encouragement. And that\u2019s how we first connected: over a mutual goal of challenging the institutionalized and systemic problems with Fifa. We both wanted to see a change, or, at the very least, we wanted to be a voice for change (granted, his voice was much more prominent than mine).  In 2011, I was a young journalist, just starting out. I was 25 years old and Toronto-based, trying to navigate my way through a male-dominated industry, on a continent that didn\u2019t really care about a sport I loved (for context, Toronto FC had only been in MLS for four years at that point). For me, Grant was a rockstar, the type of person you aspired to be like. He was smart, passionate, and, above all else, a good writer. So when this man that I put on a pedestal reached a hand down to pull me up, I was astonished.  But I shouldn\u2019t have been. Because that was just Grant\u2019s MO. Grant did this for anyone who reached out: he pulled them up, treated them like an equal, and offered whatever he could to help. And that\u2019s why we all have Grant Wahl stories. He was a rarity in the field, not just because of his talent and passion, but because he wanted to bring out that talent and passion in others too. He selflessly worked to build a soccer community in North America.   Years later, when my writing partner Kirsten Schlewitz and I were launching Unusual Efforts \u2013 a football publication for unheard voices \u2013 Grant was a strong supporter. Not only did he champion our cause, but he also financially supported it, and we\u2019re proud to have his name on our backers\u2019 wall. That was Grant: a champion and supporter of those in the industry. Grant never backed away from a story or bringing it into the mainstream. I think that\u2019s why Unusual Efforts appealed to him: he too wrote about gender issues, was an ally for the LGBTQ2S+ community, and stood up for the voiceless long before \u2013 and long after \u2013 it was fashionable. He wanted to support writing he believed in; the type of stories published not for clicks, but for awareness. He used his privilege, power, and position for good, even when it was a detriment to himself. Grant\u2019s death has shocked journalists and readers alike because he was such an integral part of building soccer in North America. And as we grieve and mourn together, we can also honour Grant\u2019s memory together. First, by continuing to tell our Grant Wahl stories and the impact that he\u2019s had. Second, by continuing his legacy to help others. Whether it be through mentorship, advice, or storytelling, we all must continue to be the voice that Grant was. It both breaks my heart and makes me smile that his last public message to me was on 20 November, the first day of the World Cup. He was, once again, giving me advice on running for Fifa president.  Our last private conversation, a week before he died, was about one of his books. Despite how busy he was in Qatar, he still was happy to have a quick chat. I just wish it had been longer. To his family, I am sorry for your loss and I hope you find the love and peace that you need. To the sports community, I understand and share in your grief. And to Grant, thank you \u2013 and I hope we meet again. "

                    "body": "At its best, the World Cup encapsulates the best of our species. Because football is a simple, dynamic game that provokes complex, elemental emotions, it crosses borders and cultures with impunity, making the cross-border, cross-cultural imperative of its global expression the greatest show on Earth. All human beings covet joy, community and identity \u2013 we might just call it love \u2013 and football is the most reliable conduit of mankind\u2019s finest facility.\nBut what constitutes the perfect World Cup? For most of us, the answer is obvious: our debut. Which means that for some, the simple thrill of unrelenting football means that Qatar 2022 will forever be where it\u2019s at \u2013 despite everything \u2013 while the rest of us try to assimilate the devastating compromises we\u2019re about to make.\n\nIn a way, we\u2019ve got off lightly: the World Cup provides a colossal captive audience and is Earth\u2019s principal unifying force, so by rights it should\u2019ve been commandeered by evil far more often. But we learn from the 1934 edition, hosted by Mussolini\u2019s Italy \u2013 and also from Argentina \u201978 and Russia 2018 \u2013 that much as we enjoy tickertape, no quantity of it should obscure to us football\u2019s co-option as a tool of abusive regimes. And what words those are to write \u2013 words that those who\u2019ve criticised the various oil clubs can confirm are more controversial than face value suggests.\nGiven all power corrupts, it\u2019s hard to judge how much state violence is too much state violence, so let\u2019s paint a line on the grass: if the host nation systemically and systematically perpetrates violence \u2013 against minorities, its own citizens or those in other countries \u2013 this should necessarily affect our feelings towards the football we hope to enjoy. Death, suffering and persecution do not a perfect tournament make.\n\nThe 1938 edition in France is generally held to be the first classic, showing the extent of the possibilities when arbitrary landmasses take to the pitch. But many invitees stayed home while others were excluded, so the quality and diversity required for an ideal iteration did not exist.\nAfter breaking for war, in 1950 the World Cup visited Brazil, with the international collaboration required to defeat the Axis powers diluting prejudices \u2013 somewhat \u2013 and increasing entries, though African nations remained absent. Naturally, imperialist overtones remained \u2013 Stanley Rous, the Football Association secretary, realised that declining empire meant declining influence, so participation helped sustain some semblance of control \u2013 but the lesson of gathering to celebrate was established nevertheless.\nAfter Mussolini\u2019s overthrow, Ottorino Barassi, commissioner of the Italian Football Federation, had been concerned that the Nazis would melt down the trophy to aid their war effort. So he moved it from the bank to his home, and when he was duly visited, the shoebox under his bed was somehow missed, the Jules Rimet remaining there until armistice \u2013 a nice yarn, but also one which teaches that our perfect World Cup requires off-pitch folklore and mythology.\nThe football supplied similar. First, England lost to USA in the Miracle on Grass, then Uruguay became champions by beating Brazil in the Maracanazo, the Maracan\u00e3 agony \u2013 the hosts\u2019 national horror establishing the importance of location and likewise its football culture. Events such as these are essential not just because they were breathtaking but because they form part of an empowering, enveloping structure; a shared history with a shared language that transcends difference.\n\nWhat 1950 also showed us is that format matters. Because Brazil is so vast, teams were split into groups, the winners of which formed a further group, the winner of which was the winner. The lesson never to do this again was learned but not fully \u2013 similar errors were made in 1974, 1978 and 1982 \u2013 but it\u2019s since been agreed that the ideal competition requires the immediate jeopardy of knockout football.\nFour years later, in 1954, the world convened in Switzerland, with West Germany \u2013 previously banned \u2013 now involved. And the first televised competition did not let down the global community it helped create, a succession of exciting games setting goals records that still stand. But most significantly, the later stages featured epic encounters of astounding drama and unimpeachable quality.\nThe quarter-finals were glorified by the Battle of Berne in which Hungary \u2013 who revolutionised the way football was played and discussed \u2013 eliminated Brazil in a vicious thriller before the teams reconvened in the dressing rooms for a good, honest, old-fashioned ruck. Then, in the semis, they beat Uruguay in a belter before, in the final, Ferenc Puskas \u2013 the world\u2019s finest player \u2013 returned from injury and scored after six minutes as Hungary went 2-0 up in eight. But West Germany powered back to pull off an epochal shock and the tragedy of a historic side missing their moment while a troubled nation united in collective ecstasy were instantly enshrined in the annals of humanity. Though it wasn\u2019t perfect, it was close.\n\nIf 1954 was partly about an icon who didn\u2019t do what he was meant to, 1958 was about the birth of one who did all that and more. Pel\u00e9 dominated the tournament, teaching us that the perfect World Cup needs an icon \u2013 ideally an unarguable immortal \u2013 and if he happens to incarnate youthfulness for evermore, so much the better.\nBrazil\u2019s win also showed us that, while surprises are good because we love a story, we\u2019re also seeking a definitive answer to the question of which team are the world\u2019s best. Ultimately, 1954 left that up in the air, and while 1958 did the opposite, the evidence shouldn\u2019t be as emphatic as a 5-2 final blowout.\n\nOr should it? Following tight contests in 1962 and 1966, Brazil\u2019s 4-1 tousing of Italy in 1970 delivered football so luminous the margin of victory didn\u2019t matter, flair suffusing achievement with a primal, carnal romance. It reminds us that our quintessential competition is not just about the present but the continuum; the moving certainty that we\u2019re seeing the peak of human capability, not just in sport but in art; the unmatchable, almost unbearable feeling of proximity to greatness; of participating in greatness.\nSimilar is some of 1974, Rinus Michels and Johan Cruyff elevating the game to a different intellectual plane. Although 1970 showed the extent of the possible when amazing players express themselves in concert, it was predicated upon a unique collection of individuals. Netherlands\u2019 Total Football, on the other hand, showcased a new way of playing whose inspiration moved the game forward and sustains through generations \u2013 another feature of the perfect World Cup.\nThe competitions of the 80s did not do this, but they did reinforce the lesson that the essential aspect of any competition is sudden-death matches that stand forever. Italy 3-2 Brazil and West Germany 3-3 France from 1982, along with Brazil 1-1 France and Argentina 2-1 England from 1986 are clashes that are not only among the most exciting but the most controversial, taxing us with moral debates of style v substance, ends v means, sport v politics, the world consumed and enraptured by extremes of emotions and thoughts.\n\nAnd that\u2019s before we consider Diego Maradona, whose mind-boggling genius and charisma taught us how it feels to watch the best player in the world dominate the world to become king of the world. But Mexico 86 was also significant because it was there that Morocco became the first African nation to qualify for the knockouts before, at Italia 90, Cameroon reached the last eight. Finally, the World Cup really was La Coupe de Monde, the cup of the world, with Italy\u2019s wild atmosphere also making clear \u2013 especially when compared with USA 94 \u2013 that our perfect competition must be played in a country that is perfect for football.\nWhich brings us back to Qatar 2022: a repressive regime but not a football country, hosting no team likely to do anything new, no all-time great side and no all-time great player at his peak. Though we can still hope for legendary knockout matches, a scuffle or 73 and folkloric peripherals, what this competition contributes to our conversation depends on us. The perfect World Cup is an illusion, so too the perfect world, but that doesn\u2019t mean we should abandon our quest for them. Rather, if we enjoy both we must take personal responsibility for both, infusing the glory of one into the other \u2013 all that joy, all that community, all that identity and all that love \u2013 because otherwise, what in the world are we?"

That wasn\u2019t the only time Gianni Infantino dropped some bars this weekend, either. Just before Sunday\u2019s big kick-off between hosts Qatar and party-poopers-elect Ecuador, the Fifa funnyman hooked up a mic to the stadium PA and yammered on about football uniting the world in the finger-wagging one-last-thing tap-room style. Despite keeping it brief this time, he still managed to extract most of the atmosphere out of the stadium with just a few flaps of his brass neck, and so it was left to the players to bring everyone back up again.

OK, so the second half was a complete non-event, not least because a large proportion of the home support, having witnessed Qatar freezing in the searing heat, upped sticks and left, driving away in high luxury 4x4 dudgeon.

I will be watching, and the main reason is I can\u2019t justify telling a seven-year-old that he\u2019s not allowed to watch the World Cup because of the way a country he had never heard of treats migrant workers and LGBTQ+ people and women, and because of what a horrible corrupt organisation Fifa is. To offset my watching, I\u2019m reading every human rights-adjacent story coming from Qatar, and I applaud all the pieces by Barney Ronay, Jonathan Liew, and many others at Big Website, highlighting all these aspects, and especially David Squires\u2019 unbelievably hard-hitting and poignant recent series of cartoons. Watch, or don\u2019t watch, but support Amnesty, Human Rights Watch, FairSquare, Big Paper/Website, and everyone else trying to improve things. Enjoy the football, if you can\u201d \u2013 Brendan Mac Carron.\n\u201cI had actually put a bit into preparing for the HRWC. I bought a big Canada flag for the house, a small one for the aerial of the car, and a vintage Canada shirt to wear down the gym (I\u2019m not Canadian, mind, I\u2019m that needlessly wacky person at work). But as a series of canaries in coal mines turned toes up throughout Friday, I realised I couldn\u2019t tolerate any exposure to the thing. I\u2019ll be hiding in virtual churches from digital Brian Glovers, recreating a malevolent and interminable pastiche of the Likely Lads. Realising that what I fear most is being accidentally exposed to competently produced accurate and timely information about football, I\u2019m planning on only reading The Daily\u201d \u2013 Jon Millard.\n\u201cNot sure why Qatar felt they needed to ban the sale of alcohol in close proximity to the grounds (Friday\u2019s Football Daily), with the associated risk of negative publicity.

                    "body": "For an illustration of the problems that Gareth Southgate has faced for this end-of-season Nations League programme, why he feared a slap in the face, which duly arrived against Hungary on Saturday night, it is necessary to start at the back. The England manager named a squad for the four ties that contained 11 defenders, six of them specialist centre-halves, with the versatile Kyle Walker considered a seventh in a back three. More than enough, surely?  Southgate lost one of them straight away \u2013 Ben White withdrawing through injury \u2013 while it emerged that Fikayo Tomori and Marc Gu\u00e9hi would not be fit enough to start in Budapest or the second game, which is against Germany in Munich on Tuesday night. On to the remaining four options. John Stones came back from injury for Manchester City on the final day of the Premier League season on 22 May and he was not 100% for Hungary, while Harry Maguire \u2013 who has struggled desperately for form \u2013 returned to the Manchester United starting XI on the same day after a lay-off. Walker last played for City on 4 May because of injury, although he was an unused substitute for them on the final day, which leaves Conor Coady alone among the central defenders to have finished the club season properly. Southgate did not want to start Stones in Budapest, perhaps with an eye on Germany, and nor \u2013 understandably \u2013 did he want to play Maguire and Coady as a central defensive pair for fear of their lack of pace being exposed. And so he went with them plus Walker in a three. It was pretty much his only option, even if did not feel ideal. \u201cWe knew with the centre-backs to try to navigate these first couple of games while Fik and Marc are out, we probably needed to use Kyle Walker as a centre-back,\u201d Southgate said. Meanwhile, the hole at left-back burns. Ben Chilwell is not fit, having returned from a six-month knee ligament lay-off on the final day for Chelsea as an 89th-minute substitute, and Luke Shaw is injured, too. Kieran Trippier, who can provide an option on the left, made his first start for Newcastle after a three-month injury absence on the final day. Southgate gave a debut to James Justin at left wing-back \u2013 a full-back who can play on both sides \u2013 and on the right he preferred Trent Alexander-Arnold to Reece James. Because in among all the mix and matching, and the need to manage players\u2019 minutes, Southgate wanted to experiment a little and look further at other things.  Hence Bukayo Saka at left wing-back in the second half; he came on for Justin and had a few nice moments. Hence Jude Bellingham as one of a midfield two in the 3-4-3 system, which had mixed results. Hence Jarrod Bowen on the right of the attack for his debut; he was energetic and direct, although his finishing was off. Southgate says that he wants to go far in the Nations League but the fledgling competition provides the only matches he has before the World Cup gets under way in Qatar on 21 November. After the Germany tie, it is Italy on Saturday and Hungary the following Tuesday (both at Molineux). Then there are the return fixtures with Italy and Germany on 23 and 26 September. That is it. If it is to be a choice between necessary fine-tuning for the World Cup and advancing in the Nations League, there is no choice. Alexander-Arnold and Justin struggled defensively in Budapest, the former downcast when he was substituted just after the hour. England left spaces behind both players \u2013 into which Hungary countered \u2013 and they laboured to create the platform for control. Bellingham and Declan Rice were a long way behind the front three and it was all frustratingly disjointed, England largely passive until Dominik Szoboszlai scored what proved to be the game\u2019s only goal from the penalty spot in the 66th minute. Southgate\u2019s team were more urgent thereafter and, on another day, they might have equalised. Then again, Hungary should have had a second goal on 81 minutes when Andr\u00e1s Sch\u00e4fer blazed high. \u201cI knew going into this block of four games that you run the risk of some results that might hurt,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cBut I have got to look at the bigger picture and ignore the inevitable that comes with the defeats and take what I will learn from it going into Qatar. We have not got friendlies to try it so we have to do it in these types of games.  \u201cWe do not have a 38-game league where you are working with the players all of the time, so if I don\u2019t try some of them in these sorts of games we either flog the team which has been more consistent and we know all about and they fade at the end of these four games anyway. Or we try to balance it by putting some players in with some others with experience.\u201d After a run of 18 wins in 22 matches and only one defeat \u2013 against Italy on penalties in the Euro 2020 final \u2013 this was a reality check, even if Southgate is hardly blind to his reality. The timing of these fixtures and the volume of them feels strange and Southgate made the point that, previously, England had played only twice in almost seven months \u2013 the friendlies against Switzerland and Ivory Coast in March. Continuity is not a friend to any international manager. Southgate also lamented having \u201cplayed a couple a bit longer than we had hoped\u201d and in extremely hot conditions \u2013 a reference, presumably, to Rice and Harry Kane being put through the 90 minutes. \u201cSo that is not perfect,\u201d he said. The right balance was elusive. Southgate has plenty to solve before Germany."

                    "body": "The quarter-finals are about to begin and the world is talking about Morocco. For the fourth time an African nation and for the first time an Arab nation is among the last eight. Geographically, this is true, but in terms of football culture Morocco is European. One of the stars, Achraf Hakimi of Paris Saint-Germain, was born in Madrid and played in Real\u2019s youth teams. The other, Chelsea\u2019s Hakim Ziyech, grew up in the Netherlands and made his name at Ajax.\nMorocco, whose coast can be easily seen from Andaluc\u00eda, has adapted its football to the Spanish rondo style. The players are light-footed, agile, flexible, technically good. The team defend with dedication, counter with courage. \u201cWe have to copy the game of the Europeans,\u201d says Morocco\u2019s coach, Walid Regragui, \u201cand bring in our own values.\u201d Morocco knocked out Spain in the last 16.\nSpain and Germany are out, Italy are not even in the tournament \u2013 three of the five European world champions are watching at home. Nevertheless, Europe has prevailed in Qatar. Almost all the important players of the eight remaining teams are employed by European clubs, shaped by the intense competition there.\n\nAlso in the running are Argentina and Brazil, the two South American giants who haven\u2019t won a title in a long time but who are always strong. So the world has not changed in football. Morocco are the \u2013 not so huge \u2013 surprise that always happens and that adds to the already great appeal of football.\n\nFor me, Argentina are the ultimate in this World Cup. All the players have mastered the basic virtue of football: one-on-one, defensively and offensively, aggressively but fairly. These individual skills, which have been lost sight of in the debates about tactics and systems, are what count if you want to win. The Argentinian players show unconditional intensity. They form a unit with the many fans because they see that there is a team on the pitch. You can see why they play football. \nThe coach, Lionel Scaloni, has everything under control. Normally, national teams are less orderly because they rarely train together. But Argentina perform harmoniously like a club team in Champions League form. Their plan: to constantly win the ball and defend forward. It\u2019s a defensive idea, but designed to be proactive. Because Argentina can also keep the ball.\nIn addition, Scaloni has thought about how to integrate the outstanding class of the 35-year-old Lionel Messi. In an interview with the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, he told how he deliberately did without Messi at the beginning of his time in charge so the team could find their way without the star. Then he integrated him.\n\nArgentina and Messi have found an unusual and exciting division of labour. In 2014, when they lost to us in the Maracan\u00e3 final, his teammates seemed to be waiting for him to solve everything on his own. In 2022, they are playing for him and he is biding his time. Such stories produce added value beyond the sporting.\nAnd Scaloni shows what leadership with expertise means. He can be expected to coach a major European club at some point. The Iberian culture of ball possession, coupled with the mentality of South America \u2013 there could hardly be anything better in world football.\nEurope can certainly learn something from Argentina and South America. Germany have a lot of talent but lack order and a plan. Italy are the opposite: the structure is there but they lack daring and action on the offensive. Spain have a superior style, but the desire to go one-on-one is somewhat lacking and so is fighting back, leaving a not-with-us feeling. In Qatar, Spain played rondo, which, as we know, does not involve scoring goals. Football is child\u2019s play, they say in Germany, because all you need is a ball and two school bags as posts. In Spain, you don\u2019t even need the school bags.\nBut it is nice and attractive to play off the opponent or to take the ball from him, not to let him pass you, for players and fans. Morocco will show it in the quarter-final against Portugal again. Football is a game of combat.\n\nThose missing from the quarter\u2011finals are the hosts of the 2026 World Cup, which will again take place not in Europe, but in three emerging football countries. Mexico, hosts in 1970 and 1986, want a new impetus; in the USA football is taking deeper roots because of demographic developments related to the increase in Hispanic people; and in Canada it is on the rise. Such developments should be strengthened by holding tournaments there and allowing Europe to take its football culture to the world.\nFootball can have a democratic effect. The game involves many more people than tennis or volleyball, is less prone to injuries than American football and is simply great fun. A second big football market could emerge in North America. This could in turn influence South America, and it would be a new competitor for Europe.\nPhilipp Lahm\u2019s column was produced in partnership with Oliver Fritsch at Zeit Online, the German online magazine, and is being published in several European countries"

                    "body": "Are United about to have Qatari owners? According to the Daily Mail on Wednesday, a group of \u201cindividual Qatari investors\u201d will imminently bid to buy Manchester United, the 20-times champions of England. The Qatari offer, the Mail claimed, would \u201cblow the competition out of the water\u201d. Qatari interest in United has been confirmed by the Guardian, with Jamie Jackson reporting that the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, is interested in buying the club. However, he will not be blowing anyone out of the water and instead believes a \u00a34.5bn valuation of United is fair, which is under the \u00a36bn figure the Glazer family, who have owned United since 2005, are reportedly after.  How likely is the bid to become reality? It depends on whether there is one Qatari bid or two. No one on the Qatari side denies that the Gulf state is exploring investment opportunities in football beyond ownership of Paris Saint-Germain and a stake in Portuguese side SC Braga. Mansoor bin Ebrahim Al-Mahmoud, the chief executive of the Qatari Investment Authority (QIA), the country\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, confirmed as much at Davos last month. \u201cYou will not be surprised if we invest in this [football],\u201d he said. England is of particular interest but whether United is the right club and a full takeover the right deal remains to be seen. Mischievous sources even suggest news of Qatari interest might have surfaced because the Glazers are having trouble selling the club and looking to flush out bids. Who else is in the race to buy United? With the Glazers having set a self-imposed deadline of mid-February for initial offers, there is currently just one in the public domain. Ineos, the petrochemical and fracking giant owned by Sir Jim Ratcliffe, a lifelong United fan and UK tax exile, announced last month that it had \u201cformally put ourselves into the process\u201d. There have been rumours of interest from US investment groups, with the firm Sixth Street reported to be interested in a minority stake in the club. In a statement Sixth Street, which has funded financial restructuring at Real Madrid and Barcelona, said it was \u201cnot looking to buy Manchester United and \u2026 not in any active discussions to do so.\u201d  Could there be a problem with Uefa? If and when a bid of Qatari provenance is successful in acquiring United, there will undeniably be questions to answer. First and foremost, Uefa will have to determine whether the owners of United are suitably distinct from the owners of PSG so as to avoid a risk of sporting collusion should the two face each other in European competition. Uefa rules state: \u201cNo individual or legal entity may have control or influence over more than one club participating in a Uefa club competition.\u201d The governing body defines control as holding a majority share in a club, the ability to appoint or remove senior members of staff or \u201cbeing able to exercise by any means a decisive influence in the decision-making of the club\u201d. It\u2019s this last clause that would seem most significant. Is there a way around the problem? PSG are owned by Qatar Sports Investment (QSI), which would not be able to acquire anything more than a minority stake in United. But QSI is in turn funded by QIA and if another company under the QIA umbrella, say the Qatar National Bank, were to make a bid it is possible the same restrictions would not apply. These would be difficult considerations for Uefa and its Club Financial Control Body (CFCB) to make. A possible precedent can be found in the decision to allow Red Bull Salzburg and RB Leipzig to both play in the 2017-18 Champions League. Both sides are owned by the energy drink manufacturer, Red Bull GmbH, and Uefa investigators found the company exerted a strong influence over both clubs. However, the CFCB found there was not enough grounds to believe there was influence running between the two clubs after certain members of staff linked to Red Bull and loan arrangements between the teams had been removed. So a Qatari takeover of United is doable? Never say never in football, and in the interests of completion, it should be noted that Nasser al-Khelaifi, president of PSG and QSI chair, sits on the executive committee of Uefa and was described by Aleksander Ceferin, Uefa\u2019s president, as \u201ca great man\u201d who respects \u201cfootball and its values\u201d after PSG resisted the siren call of the European Super League. Ceferin thanked Khelaifi \u201cfrom the bottom of my heart\u201d for taking that stance."

Saka hobbled off before the half-hour in last month\u2019s win over Nottingham Forest and appeared to be accused of diving by Graham Potter when Arsenal defeated Chelsea last Sunday. He was booked for simulation at Southampton when replays suggested he had been fouled and Arteta said officials need to be aware that players receive closer attention as their reputations grow.  \u201cThe referees have the duties to deal with that,\u201d he said. \u201cThe better the players become, the bigger target they become, because people try to find ways to stop him. That is why football has very clear rules, what you can do and what you cannot do, and that is the referee\u2019s job.\u201d Arteta did not place all the onus on referees, saying his team need to be \u201cmore intelligent\u201d in finding ways to place Saka in situations that pose less physical risk. \u201cIt becomes about the timing, the decision making, the space you have generated before that action, and the understanding and knowledge of what is going to happen before it happens,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes [we can improve] the type of ball we give him and when we give him certain balls.\u201d Saka will be fit to face Wolves at Molineux on Saturday. Three points would guarantee Arsenal top spot in the Premier League over the World Cup break, an outcome few had considered likely in August. After the weekend 10 of their players, including England\u2019s Saka, will head to Qatar; from 4 December the remaining squad members will travel to Dubai for a 10-day training camp. During that period they are expected to face Lyon and Milan in a series dubbed the Dubai Super Cup, with Liverpool completing the quartet but not lined up as opponents. On their return they intend to host a friendly on 17 December, with Barcelona likely visitors to the Emirates. The intention is that, as far as possible, Arsenal\u2019s World Cup representatives will be able to join up with their club colleagues in the United Arab Emirates as and when they exit the competition."

James Maddison, James Tarkowski and Dominic Calvert-Lewin will be among those desperately hoping not. Tarkowski has impressed in a new-look defensive partnership with Conor Coady that has underpinned Everton\u2019s greater resilience and character this season. While Coady looks a safe bet for Qatar, Tarkowski has not had a look-in at international level since 2018, when he was on stand-by for the last World Cup before undergoing a hernia operation. Maddison\u2019s claims have also been ignored by the England manager despite producing six Premier League goals and two assists in a difficult season for Leicester.

He was first stripped of the captaincy and had his contract terminated before a February move to Barcelona.\nThe Gabon international, 33, scored 92 times in more than 150 appearances for Arsenal and returned to the Premier League in September, signing for Chelsea where he has scored three times in 11 games.\n\u201cThe history makes it an interesting one for Auba.

The schedule is always mad and always results in injuries, reckons the West Ham gaffer.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the time of the season where injuries happen,\u201d he said. \u201cWe go into the Christmas period where you\u2019re asking the players to play a ridiculous amount of games over a short period of time, but this is our culture and that\u2019s what we do. But to highlight it more now, there\u2019s probably the same number of injuries as there was last season when there was no World Cup, so if people are surprised then they shouldn\u2019t be - because with football comes injuries.\n\u201cAnd let\u2019s be fair with the amount of games the players, the clubs and the coaches have had to put up with, a huge scheduling - everybody\u2019s scheduling a big, big amount of games. So I don\u2019t think it should be too surprising knowing that there\u2019s injuries.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 4.35pm GMT\n\n\n 4.31pm  \n\nSydney United 58 FC have been fined $15,000 and face possible bans from future competitions after a Football Australia investigation found fans behaved in a \u201cdeeply offensive\u201d manner at last month\u2019s Australia Cup final.\n\n\n\n\n 4.28pm  \n\nJust in case you missed it: Here is Barney Ronay\u2019s piece from last week on all things Qatar:\n\n\n\n\n 4.27pm  \n\nAnyway, after so much World Cup stuff, on to something less controversial: VAR. Spurs were denied that late Kane goal against Sporting last week, so they needed a result in Marseille in midweek. One thing I was wondering about after writing about VAR last week \u2013 why does it make people so angry, compared to the TMO in rugby, or the third umpire in cricket?\nI reckon the answer must lie partly in the fact that in both cricket and rugby, the decision-making process is talked through by the officials involved during the decision review process, so fans and viewers are kept in the picture not just on the final decision, but how and why it has been reached.\nAnother thing I\u2019ve been wondering about is if football could introduce a \u2018margin of error\u2019 element for offside decisions, like umpire\u2019s call in cricket.\nWhat do you think?

It\u2019s time for The Fiver, courtesy of John Brewin:\n\n\n\n\n 4.10pm  \n\nSome more Antonio Conte quotes have dropped on the PA wire, starting with more on the schedule:\n\u201cWe knew it was crazy to put a World Cup during the league and the Champions League. This type of schedule is crazy. Honestly, it is really strange in England that we start to play three days after the final of the World Cup. We are the only country to do it.\n\u201cItaly, France, Spain and Portugal and other countries, they are taking time to give rest and to breathe a bit. I find it crazy that December 21, after three days from the final, we are going to play a game in the Carabao Cup. I find this crazy. After three more days you have to play in the Premier League. The show must go on, this is the truth, but honestly I don\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\nConte also said that Dejan Kulusevski may play a part against Liverpool on Sunday. He added: \u201cIt is better to start with a smile. Yeah, we need to face this situation [the schedule]. I said also before we have to try to finish these three games in the best possible way. We have these injuries and I can confirm Richarlison is not available for the game. It is the same for Romero but Bentancur is much better. Today he was part of the training session.\n\u201cIt was the same for Kulusevski, today he had half a training session with us. The problem is Lucas Moura is having some different faces for his pain in his tendon. Today he was really bad and he said to me he was really worried for this but I ask of him to try to be available because we need (him). Also, Sonny, you know, is now having surgery. At the end, we have to be happy for qualification for the Champions League.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 4.14pm GMT\n\n\n 4.06pm  \n\nEngland Lionesses news from PA, or \u201cthe PA\u201d, if you prefer:\nJess Park has been called up to the England squad for this month\u2019s friendlies with Japan and Norway. The 21-year-old forward, who is on loan at Everton from Manchester City, replaces Chelsea\u2019s Fran Kirby in Sarina Wiegman\u2019s 25-player squad. \nKirby has a viral infection and will remain with her club to complete her recovery. Kirby had been named in the initial squad on Tuesday despite missing four of Chelsea\u2019s last five games.\nHead coach Wiegman said at the time: \u201cShe\u2019s being assessed right now and then hopefully she\u2019ll progress this week and she\u2019s ready to come in for camp.\u201d \nWiegman\u2019s squad will travel to Spain next week to take on Japan and Norway in Murcia. The European champions face Japan on November 11 and Norway four days later.\n\n\n\n 3.48pm  \n\nNews from Germany, courtesy of AP:\nWith the World Cup only weeks away, Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer is set to return to action with Bayern Munich for the first time in nearly a month following a shoulder injury. \nNeuer has not played since a 2-2 draw with Borussia Dortmund on 8 October but Bayern coach Julian Nagelsmann said Friday the keeper will play against Hertha Berlin in the Bundesliga on Saturday as long as there are no setbacks in the final training session. \n\u201cWe waited for as long as needed for him to be pain-free again. There\u2019s always a certain risk but he and the doctors have given the green light,\u201d Nagelsmann said. \u201cSomething can always happen. Soccer is a contact sport.\u201d \nNagelsmann added that Germany forward Leroy San\u00e9 and France defender Lucas Hernandez will also return to the squad after recent injury absences but will only be involved off the bench. Sane had a thigh strain in the 5-0 win over Freiburg on 16 October and Hernandez has not played since tearing the adductor muscle in his left thigh against Barcelona in September. \nTwo other Bayern players with World Cup ambitions remain out of the squad. Nagelsmann said Germany forward Thomas M\u00fcller is in line to return next week after various minor injuries and illnesses which have restricted him to only brief appearances over the last month, while Netherlands defender Matthijs de Ligt missed training with a knee issue. Germany coach Hansi Flick is scheduled to announce his squad Thursday. Germany\u2019s opening World Cup game is against Japan on 23 November. \n\n\n\n 3.40pm  \n\nFifa has written to World Cup teams urging them to focus on football in Qatar and not let the sport be dragged into ideological or political \u201cbattles\u201d. The letter from Fifa president Gianni Infantino and the governing body\u2019s secretary general Fatma Samoura follows a number of protests made by World Cup teams, on issues ranging from LGBTIQ rights to concerns over the treatment of migrant workers.\n\u201cPlease, let\u2019s now focus on the football!\u201d Infantino and Samoura wrote in the letter to the 32 nations contesting the World Cup. \u201cWe know football does not live in a vacuum and we are equally aware that there are many challenges and difficulties of a political nature all around the world. But please do not allow football to be dragged into every ideological or political battle that exists.\u201d \n\u201cIf Gianni Infantino wants the world to \u2018focus on the football\u2019 there is a simple solution: FIFA could finally start tackling the serious human rights issues rather than brushing them under the carpet,\u201d Steve Cockburn, Amnesty International\u2019s Head of Economic and Social Justice, said in a statement. \u201cA first step would be publicly committing to the establishment of a fund to compensate migrant workers before the tournament kicks off and ensuring that LGBT people do not face discrimination or harassment,\u201d Cockburn added. \n\u201cIt is astonishing they still have not done so. Gianni Infantino is right to say that \u2018football does not exist in a vacuum\u2019. Hundreds of thousands of workers have faced abuses to make this tournament possible and their rights cannot be forgotten or dismissed. They deserve justice and compensation, not empty words, and time is running out.\u201d \nWorld Cup organisers have said that everyone, no matter their sexual orientation or background, is welcome, while also warning against public displays of affection. Qatar has acknowledged there are \u201cgaps\u201d in its labour system but the World Cup has allowed the country to make progress on worker rights.

Who will be next?\n\n\n\n 3.24pm  \nConte says condensed playing schedule is 'impossible'\n\nThose Conte quotes in full regarding the schedule: \u201cMany teams are having big injuries, this is because we are playing every three days. I think that we are seeing that this situation is impossible, it\u2019s impossible for the future. It will be important for the future to understand, because many times I hear about the welfare of the players, but it\u2019s only a polite way to show that you are really interested in their welfare. Because then, they [governing bodies] are not really worried about the welfare of the players if the schedule is this. In every moment you show that the most important thing is: \u2018The show must go on\u2019 then please, I don\u2019t want to listen, to speak about the welfare of the players, because this is not true.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 3.27pm GMT\n\n\n 3.18pm  \n\nAntonio Conte also spoke about the punishing schedule, saying that \u2018player welfare\u2019 is a \u2018polite\u2019 way for authorities to claim they care about the players\u2019 wellbeing, but that in reality the schedule comes first. A good point well made.\n\n\n\n 3.15pm  \n\nGraham Potter said Ben Chilwell is having a scan on his hamstring injury this afternoon, adding that they had to wait for swelling to go down a bit before doing checking the injury.\nThe Tottenham manager Antonio Conte, meanwhile, told Sky Sports News in his press conference that Heung-Min Son is \u201cprobably\u201d having surgery on his eye fracture now.\n\n\n\n 3.13pm  \n\nDavid \u201cMoyesy\u201d Moyes of West Ham is having a chat.\nWill Lucas Paquet\u00e1 feature against Palace? \u201cHe\u2019s been training \u2026 he\u2019s probably ready to be included in the squad \u2026 we certainly think he could be involved.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re beginning to get some injured players back \u2026 Nayef Aguerd played 90 minutes last night.\u201d\n\u201cWe earned it, we won the games in the other rounds of the tournament [Europa Conference League] \u2026 in the end we found ourselves top of a group in Europe which is excellent from our point of view \u2026 we left some players behind who didn\u2019t need to go to Romania [the 3-0 win against FCSB last night].\n\u201cWe\u2019ve not had the same preparation time as others as we\u2019ve just got back from Hungary.\nAre the players minds\u2019 on the World Cup? \u201cI\u2019ve not really had any conversations with them [about the WC] \u2026 we have got a job to do here. I\u2019ve got supporters and owners who want to see the team winning.

Wednesday was his first anniversary as Spurs manager but he doesn\u2019t look in celebratory mood given he has a mounting injury list to contend with before taking on the Reds.\n\nSonny is having his surgery now. We have to try and finish these three games in the best possible way. I can confirm Richarlison is not available. It is the same for Romero but Bentancur is much better. Today he was part of training. It was the same for Kulusevski, today he had half training session with us. The problem is Lucas Moura is having some pain. Today it was really bad and they said he was really worried for this. I asked him to try to be available. About Romero I can tell you for him, if I ask the possibility to play with one leg, he wants to play with one leg. For this reason I tell the fans we have players really committed to the club.\n\nConte also railed against the lack of welfare shown towards Premier League players when it comes to the scheduling of matches, something his counterpart on Sunday, Liverpool\u2019s J\u00fcrgen Klopp, will agree with him on. \n\nI don\u2019t want to listen or hear about the welfare of the player, because this is not true.\n\n\nUpdated at 2.47pm GMT\n\n\n 2.33pm  \n\nAdmir Paji\u00e6 writes in with this take on Unai Emery: \u201cHe was wrong for Arsenal in a similar way David Moyes was wrong for Manchester United or Roy Hodgson was wrong for Liverpool. He is excellent if you have a mid-table club that wants to punch above its weight and make a strong cup run but if you want a league title \u2026 Pass.\u201d\nMy question is: in what season will Aston Villa win the Europa League? \n\n\n\n\n 2.27pm  \n\nWolves face Brighton tomorrow hovering just a point above bottom-placed Nottingham Forest. They really need to sort a permanent manager out don\u2019t they? According to interim manager Steve Davis they\u2019re close to finally doing that but possibly not before the winter break. \u201cThat obviously could change if there is some sort of announcement in the next couple of days,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the moment my focus is just getting up to Arsenal, up to the World Cup, and then beyond that we\u2019ll see.\u201d Wolves have found goals as hard to come by as hens\u2019 teeth and their cause has not been helped by Diego Costa\u2019s red card last weekend. The striker is out till Boxing Day.\n\nUpdated at 2.27pm GMT\n\n\n 2.19pm  \n\nJ\u00fcrgen Klopp was awarded the freedom of the city of Liverpool yesterday. Naturally, after the ceremony he spoke about how he will be getting the ferry for free from now on the Qatar World Cup and how he thinks it shouldn\u2019t be the responsibility of players to make political statements when the decision to host the tournament there was taken by different people many years ago. Here\u2019s the video of what he had to say:\n\n\nUpdated at 2.20pm GMT\n\n\n 2.12pm  \n\nWill Donny van de Beek finally come good at Manchester United? Erik ten Hag doesn\u2019t sound too confident but isn\u2019t giving up on him just yet.\n\nHe had a good pre-season and then got injured, now he is back. I think it was a decent performance [against Sociedad] but he can do better. I know him very well [from Ajax]. He delivered what I expected in terms of positioning, pressing and in the transition. I can only talk about him [at United] from my time here and I think he can do more.\u201d\n\nTen Hag also added he was not sure whether forwards Antony and Anthony Martial would be fit to make the trip to Aston Villa.\n\n\n\n 2.01pm  \n\nHello, Gregg here. I\u2019ll keep the blog ticking over while Luke is away. First up is a a bit of bad news for Leeds United\u2019s bank balance. Cas has ruled that the club will have to pay \u00a318.4m to RB Leipzig for Jean-Kevin Augustin, who made only three substitute appearances for the club in their Championship-winning season. He\u2019s now at Nantes. Ouch.\n\n\nUpdated at 2.02pm GMT\n\n\n 1.52pm  \n\nHanding you over to Gregg Bakowski for the next hour.\n\n\n\n 1.52pm  \nUnai Emery: 'My dream is to win a trophy with Aston Villa'\n\nChristian Purslow, the Aston Villa chief executive, kicks off their press conference with some words about Emery\u2019s appointment, the club\u2019s ambition, and he makes a point of thanking Emery\u2019s former club Villarreal for their professional attitude in the deal.\n\u201cI am happy to be here,\u201d Emery begins. \u201cI decided to come here because it\u2019s a great project.\n\u201cOur ambition is going to be together. Step-by-step I want to improve [things] here, and help with my experience \u2026 we are going to take each match, and focus on Sunday and Manchester United.\u201d\nWhat did he learn during his time at Arsenal? \u201cI learned a lot \u2026 overall, each [opposition] team, they gave us some experience playing against them when I was in Arsenal \u2026 I learned as well, playing in Europe 15 years in a row against a lot of English teams \u2026 as a coach I am now 51 years old, I have managed in Spain, France in the Premier League \u2026 English teams are for me a big challenge \u2013 because I think now the Premier League is maybe the first league in the world.\n\u201cMy dream is to win a trophy with Aston Villa \u2026 it\u2019s my personal challenge. My second dream, my objective, could be to play with Aston Villa in Europe. But now we have to start thinking only about the next match because we are not in a good position in the table now. I want to test, I want to check, individually and collectively, the players.\u201d\n\n\n\n 1.43pm  \n\nFrank Lampard speaks before the meeting with Leicester City tomorrow evening: \u201cGetting consistency is what separates the top boys from the rest in the Premier League \u2026 sometimes they are operating in different ways\n\u201cWe have to strive to control ourselves, how we prepare, and hopefully the result of that is winning back-to-back games.\u201d\nOn the challenge of Leicester: \u201cThey are a great team, we have seen that in recent weeks \u2026 it was never in doubt for me [after a poor start], they\u2019re a team that have worked together for a few years with a really good manager, they\u2019ve shown resilience.\nOn Everton\u2019s defence: \u201cWe\u2019ve got good individuals doing their jobs and there\u2019s a desire to defend our goal. I think you have to give credit [to the players'] on that point.\n\u201cJordan [Pickford] is in the top bracket of goalkeeper\u2019s in the world. He is England\u2019s No 1 \u2026 if you look at the teams who have won titles in the last few years they have all got world-class goalkeepers.\u201d\nA reporter then says Leicester have conceded 26 goals from set pieces this season and that Everton have conceded the second-most goals from set pieces in that time. Lampard good-naturedly pulls him up on that and says it\u2019s wrong. The reporter eventually agrees it\u2019s from the start of last season.\n\u201cI came here in February so let\u2019s leave that one,\u201d jokes Lampard.\n\n\n\n 1.35pm  \n\nCould Brighton\u2019s Lewis Dunk and/or Danny Welbeck go to the World Cup with England? The Seagulls manager Roberto De Zerbi thinks they are good enough but is largely staying out of it:\n\u201cDunk is one of the best centre-backs in the Premier League,\u201d says the Brighton manager. \u201cThat is my opinion \u2026 I don\u2019t want to give advice. If Dunk will go to the World Cup, I will be happy for sure. The same for Welbeck. It\u2019s not my work to decide 22 players to go to the World Cup.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 1.35pm GMT\n\n\n 1.30pm  \n\n\u201cGood to see Unai Emery back in the league with the Villa,\u201d says AbberNibble. \u201cI doubt he was backed the way he would have liked at Arsenal, we were in a bit of a rut in that period, uninterested owner, squad needed sandblasting, supporters were unhappy.\n\u201cHopefully he gets a good shot at it this time, not an easy job though Aston Villa, Unai does not shy away from the tough gigs, you have to give the man a bit of credit for constantly testing himself I think.\u201d\nEmery will be speaking to the media any second, I believe.\n\n\n\n 1.23pm  \n\"It's his decision\": Vieira keen to keep Zaha at Palace\n\nPatrick Vieira has been talking before the trip to West Ham on Sunday, firstly on Crystal Palace\u2019s away form: \u201cWe have to accept that we will suffer more away from home. At the moment, every time we are suffering away from home, we are conceding goals, and that\u2019s not right if we want to win football matches.\u201d\nOn West Ham\u2019s European campaign: \u201cIt\u2019s challenge to play Thursday, Sunday, Thursday, Sunday \u2026 but when you look at the starting 11 they had last Sunday, I don\u2019t think any of those players [who played in Europe last night] will start.\n\u201cThey are in a better place now \u2026 they didn\u2019t have the start they were looking for \u2026 but now they are playing well and they look really solid. You just have to look at the squad that they have. They have players who can score goals, who can make a massive impact in games, of course it\u2019s going to be a challenging game, but we I believe we have quality to go there and perform well, like we did last year.\n\u201cWe have to believe in ourselves and go there and play as good as we can.\u201d\nAgain, Vieira is asked about the future of Wilfried Zaha, the highly rated winger whose contract ends next summer: \u201cIt\u2019s not a distraction for him and for the football club as well \u2026 the decision has to be his decision. We will do everything we can in our side to keep him. At the moment he is performing well and that\u2019s all that matters for now.\nBarcelona and Juventus have been linked with Zaha, says a reporter. Vieira previously smiled when those names were mentioned: \u201cIf you take any player in the Premier League, and you mention those names, that of course will have an impact \u2026 for any player in the PL that creates excitement.\n\u201cThat [his future] will be his decision. We will do everything we can to convince him to stay \u2026 the next couple of years can be really exciting for the football club.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 1.27pm GMT\n\n\n 1.08pm  \n\nThe Southampton manager Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl is having a chat now before fourth-placed Newcastle\u2019s visit on Sunday.\nHow will they deal with the Toon press? \u201cIt\u2019s impressive to see how they are doing. They are def having the players to do this \u2026 he is going for the players that give you this intense game, and we all know this can be a very nasty way of setting an opponent under pressure \u2026 As you said, we do it ourselves. I think when we do it well we can cause them some issues. When we have a good evening \u2026 we have shown we can break they rhythm and cause them some issues \u2026 this is the goal for Sunday.\u201d\nHassenhuttl also said that Kyle Walker-Peters has no chance of being fit for the World Cup.\n\nUpdated at 1.12pm GMT\n\n\n 1.01pm  \n\nA story from last night, from Paul MacInnes, about an on-pitch protest against the effects of gambling harm due to take place this weekend:\n\u201cBritish footballers will stage their first on-pitch protest against the effects of gambling harm this weekend, with more than 100 players showing support for a ban on advertising by bookmakers.\n\u201cPlayers in FA Cup, Scottish Women\u2019s Premier League Cup, Women\u2019s Championship and non-league matches will wear yellow laces as they try to heighten the pressure on government to take action.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 12.51pm  \n\nGuardiola\u2019s fitness update on City\u2019s players: \u201c[Manuel] Akanji is OK. Kalvin [Phillips] and Kyle [Walker] are still not fit.\nDoes anyone else have a problem? \u201cNo.\u201d\nOn this weekend\u2019s opponents: \u201cI am not surprised that Fulham are seventh. The manager is exceptional \u2026 last season in the FA Cup I know how we suffered [They won 4-1] \u2026 top, top \u2026 yeah, good team.\u201d\nWhy has Phil Foden been on the bench for recent Premier League matches? \u201cRiyad [Mahrez] has been in the bench as well \u2026 [Ilkay] Gundogan as well \u2026 Kevin de Bruyne as well. I have many players, I have to use them, I demand the best of them \u2026\u201d\n\nUpdated at 12.56pm GMT\n\n\n 12.48pm  \nDecision due on Erling Haaland's fitness later today\n\nPep Guardiola is asked: How is Erling Haaland\u2019s fitness and will he play this weekend? \u201cHe is much better. We will decide today. It\u2019s a good step, to start to train, now we have training this afternoon, and we will see.\u201d\nHow will the decision be made? \u201cHimself, his opinion, the doctor\u2019s opinion \u2026 if he\u2019s good for 90 minutes, or less minutes \u2026 we will see after training.\u201d\nCan Alvarez play three times in a week if Haaland doesn\u2019t play? \u201cHe\u2019s so young, he\u2019s so young. At that age, you can play every day.\u201d\nGuardiola reacts to Gerard Piqu\u00e9\u2019s retirement that was announced last night: \u201cI wish him all the best, for him and his family. Incredible human being. Huge personality. A player for big games. Never missed once a performance at the high level. All the big clubs need these type of players. Won everything with Bar\u00e7a and national team. Of course, the future will be bright because he\u2019s a smart guy.

The Scottish champions were knocked out at the group stage after taking just two points from their six matches against Real Madrid, Shakhtar Donetsk and RB Leipzig.\nDespite failing to notch a win, goalkeeper Hart is adamant it was an experience that added to Celtic\u2019s motivation to make sure they are regular contestants in the tournament. \u201cI don\u2019t think you could light our fire any more,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve experienced something that we feel the club we play for and represent should be feeling every year.\n\u201cWe want to get that little bit more and get victories and progression in the tournament, so I don\u2019t think anything could make us any more hungry for something that we feel is essential to this club.\u201d\n\nThe former England and Manchester City goalkeeper Hart believes being exposed to Champions League forays this season will have enhanced Celtic\u2019s development as a group.\n\u201cWe\u2019re all learning all the time, myself included,\u201d he said. \u201cI might have been there before and played in plenty of those kind of games and been part of those campaigns but I think we\u2019re learning as a group. It\u2019s going to make us more united if we\u2019ve got a common goal, a common focus. I feel like we\u2019ve had that from day one really and it\u2019s only getting stronger.

I always said that after Barcelona there will be no other club, and that is the way it is going to be.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 11.51am  \n\nEddie Howe continued, on Newcastle backing up their encouraging form: \u201cThe next area is to produce those types of performances week in, week out. I have to compliment the players so far this season. I think we\u2019ve been very level in terms of what we\u2019ve produced. We\u2019re always in the lap of the football gods but for us, controlling our application, desire and all the basics that you need to produce a good performance to win a game, I think, have been there.\n\u201cWe need to maintain that and there\u2019s a lot of areas of the team need to continue to improve which we\u2019re working towards everyday.\u201d\nQuotes from nufc.com.\n\n\n\n 11.48am  \n\nCourtesy of nufc.com, some quotes from Eddie Howe before his side\u2019s trip to Southampton on Sunday. First an injury update \u2013 Jonjo Shelvey may feature having not played a competitive match since April:\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a few bumps and bruises but nothing too bad. Allan (Saint-Maximin) has come through after his little cameo, as well as Jonjo. The strength of the group is slowly returning and we still have Emil (Krafth), Alex (Isak) and Matt Ritchie still out. Karl Darlow is back training and trained well this week. Apart from that, we\u2019re in a good place.\n\u201cI think Jonjo would probably say yes. He\u2019s certainly getting closer. This has been his second proper week of training so he\u2019s in a much better place but without that match exposure. We wanted to protect him from that and see him through to the World Cup.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 11.49am GMT\n\n\n 11.34am  \n\nNo, we definitely don\u2019t want any Adebayoresque gloating from the lad Aubameyang should he score for Chelsea against Arsenal. Definitely not.\nHere, from 2009, is the great Martin Kelner on Adebayor\u2019s length-of-the-pitch run to celebrate that header in front of the Arsenal fans and the OTT reaction to it.\n\u201cIn case you are not a regular listener to sports radio, I should explain that \u201clost the plot\u201d is shorthand applied to anyone who does anything you disapprove of. In phone-in land, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and Rafa Ben\u00edtez are the Premier League\u2019s chief plot-losers, Wenger for failing to replace Patrick Vieira \u2013 there is a rule somewhere that any Arsenal fan given access to the airwaves must mention this within the first 20 seconds \u2013 and Rafa for not being Bill Shankly.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 11.41am GMT\n\n\n 11.31am  \n\nAn already-spicy encounter between Chelsea and Arsenal has been lent added piquancy by a promo clip recorded for BT Sport by Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing personal, Arsenal,\u201d says the Chelsea striker, who is presumably eager to put one over on a club whose manager relieved him of the captaincy before shipping him off to Barcelona. \u201cI\u2019m back, I\u2019m ready and I\u2019m blue.\u201d The striker\u2019s harmless goading might carry more weight if he was currently firing on all cylinders but his return for Chelsea of three goals in 11 appearances \u2013 two of them off the bench \u2013 is hardly prolific. Aubameyang will be desperate to add to this tally on Sunday and should he do so, any celebration (or the lack thereof) will be scrutinised to within an inch of its life.

It was the winger\u2019s second start for United, following his full debut in last month\u2019s 3-0 win over Sheriff Tiraspol.\n\u201cHe (Garnacho) was good, but he knows we expect a lot from him,\u201d Fernandes told BT Sport. \u201cIn the (pre-season) tour, he didn\u2019t have the best attitude. That\u2019s why he didn\u2019t get chances. Now he\u2019s getting his chances because he\u2019s training better, [he has a] different attitude, and he deserves it.\u201d \nUnited, who needed to win by a two-goal margin to overtake Real Sociedad in the standings on goal difference, go into the knockout round playoffs. (Reuters)\n\n\n\n 11.19am  \n\n\u201cAm I the only one not excited about the Qatar World Cup ?\u201d asks CheshamJim in the comments. \u201cNot sure I\u2019m even going to watch it and I love football.\u201d\nAnd selected replies:\n\u201cYou\u2019re not alone, I\u2019m not bothering either.\u201d\n\u201cMe neither.

At the Chelsea training ground, the camera panned across to Graham Potter taking a training session.\n\u201cThat\u2019s interesting, an open training session on a Friday,\u201d I thought.\nBut they were promptly told to pack it in (presumably by a media person, off camera), and that they were not permitted to film Chelsea\u2019s preparations for Sunday\u2019s Arsenal tie.

Real and Barca bosses Florentino Perez and Joan Laporta were instrumental in the launch of the Super League last April.\nThe league quickly collapsed amid outrage among fans of the Premier League teams who had signed up, with the British Government, UEFA and FIFA also coming out in opposition to the plans. One of the key objections to the league from fans was its closed nature, with the premise being that 15 of the continent\u2019s top clubs would be permanent members.\nA video published on LaLiga\u2019s Twitter account on Friday morning stated: \u201cThe promoters of the Super League are trying to conceal its format, claiming that they still don\u2019t have a fixed model, although it will be inclusive and open. \u201cWe know that this is false and that they want to present a semi-closed format similar to that of 2019, which has already been rejected by the clubs and (the) European Leagues (group).\u201d\n\nUpdated at 11.00am GMT\n\n\n 10.53am  \n\nThe television in the club house at Coalville Town was tuned into BBC2 and all eyes were on Alan Smith and Dion Dublin as they prepared to make the draw for the first round of the FA Cup.\n\u201cWe were No 61 and Charlton were No 11,\u201d says Jake Eggleton, recalling that Monday night last month. \u201cWhen No 11 came out and we waited to see who\u2019d they play, all I could think was: \u2018Let it be 61, it\u2019s got to be 61.\u2019 When it was us, the whole place went mental. It was a wow moment. It felt fantastic, unbelievable, amazing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 10.48am  \n\nKlopp is interesting on the challenge of facing Luciano Spalletti\u2019s Napoli: \u201cThe [pre-match] analysis of Napoli was a pure joy from a football point of view \u2026 because everything they do works out in the moment. It\u2019s crazy, the way they score goals, where they score the goals, the highest tempo, all these kinds of things. The challenge was to deny that and we did that, so that\u2019s good. It\u2019s not news to me we can do that \u2026 we just have to do it again, and again, and again [for the rest of the season]. That\u2019s how it is.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 10.52am GMT\n\n\n 10.42am  \n\nJ\u00fcrgen Klopp is speaking now on Liverpool\u2019s general form before going to Tottenham on Sunday (they have lost their last two PL matches against Forest and Leeds): \u201cIf you want to get out of something, you first have to get through it \u2026 we go there [to Tottenham], and want to be 100 per cent at our best.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult place to go, a really good team \u2026 a really fighting unit. Antonio\u2019s [Conte] on his toes on the touchline, players going into challenges \u2026 it\u2019s a tough one, but that\u2019s what we all want. It\u2019s like a Champions League game in the Premier League.\n\u201cWe have to fight through this. That\u2019s the case. You cannot play through it. You cannot forget about the defending stuff \u2026 in between [Champions League wins over Ajax and Napoli] we lose against Leeds, that couldn\u2019t have felt worse, but then you play a good game against a team in form [Napoli], and it gives you a lift.\u201d\n\n\n\n 10.36am  \n\nNews this morning from the completely normal Fifa World Cup, courtesy of Paul MacInnes:\n\u201cEngland and Wales fans will be paid to travel to Qatar for the World Cup and given free tickets to the opening ceremony, but there is a catch: they will be expected to be ambassadors for the tournament.\n\u201cMembers of the Fan Leader Network, a group which Qatari authorities say \u201ccontributes to tournament planning through fan insight, research, content creation and message amplification\u201d, have been offered the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity of travelling to the tournament, providing they agree to certain terms and conditions.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 10.27am  \n\nLast night\u2019s match reports, if you missed anything:\n\n\n\n\n\n 10.18am  \nPreamble\n\nA mere 16 days to go now before Qatar and Ecuador kick off the World Cup \u2013 but there are still two rounds of the Premier League to be snuck in before England, Wales and assorted other qualified nations assemble in the Persian Gulf for the most controversial show on earth.\nIt\u2019s another big weekend of domestic action \u2013 aren\u2019t they all? Sunday is looking particularly momentous, featuring as it does Chelsea v Arsenal and Tottenham v Liverpool.\nWe\u2019ll bring you team news, previews, World Cup news, other news, and possibly some reaction to Erik ten Hag deploying Harry Maguire as a striker in the Europa League last night. \u201cIt is what it is,\u201d said Ten Hag, and it\u2019s hard to argue with that.\nAnyway, enough of my yakking. Here\u2019s 10 things to look out for in the Premier League this weekend:\n\n\nUpdated at 1.32pm GMT\n"

                    "body": "Milo\u0161 Degenek was 16, the temperature was minus eight degrees, and a jacket was not part of his sartorial repertoire. \u201cI had, like, two pairs of trackies underneath one another, and then four jumpers,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause I didn\u2019t have money to buy a winter jacket.\u201d\nEvery day the budding Australian defender layered his clothes in this manner, then shivered his way through the 90-minute journey to VfB Stuttgart\u2019s youth team training. Then, once it was done, he\u2019d turn around and travel 90 minutes back.\n\u201cMy first experience of professional football was being dropped in the middle of Germany and having to take an hour and a half to get to training in the middle of a freezing winter. My first professional contract was $1,000 a month, so I wasn\u2019t earning big bucks.\u201d\n\nDegenek\u2019s agent eventually bought him a jacket, but by then the most valuable lessons had already been learned. \u201cThose struggles, that\u2019s where I got that mentality,\u201d says the now 28-year-old, who made his World Cup debut as a substitute against France on Tuesday.\n\u201cWhere I thought to myself, \u2018I\u2019m training with another 20 guys but I want to be that one who goes on to make it\u2019. I can say, fortunately enough, I am one of the ones that made it. There\u2019s others in that group that did make it as well. One of them\u2019s a guy called Kimmich, who\u2019s not bad \u2013 I learned a lot from him even though he\u2019s younger.\u201d\n\nThat witty one-liner aside, Degenek is deadly serious. Struggle is in his blood, pumped from the ventricles of a heart that is uncommonly large not just by virtue of being an athlete.\nHe was 18 months old when his family sought refuge in Serbia, having fled his birthplace Croatia in the 1990s during the war of independence. Five years later they were on the move again, this time escaping the trauma of the Kosovo War. He ended up in western Sydney with a Red Star Belgrade jersey and not much else.\nThis background precipitates a certain level of perspective concerning simpler matters such as football. Concerning, specifically, Australia\u2019s match against Tunisia in Qatar. After losing their opener4-1 to France, Saturday\u2019s return to Al Janoub Stadium is effectively a must-win to stand a chance of getting out of Group D. A draw would leave them with a sliver of hope. A defeat would end the campaign.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not pressure,\u201d says Degenek. \u201cPressure is me as a baby fleeing a war. Pressure is me as a six-year-old being in the middle of a war. Pressure is not \u2018I must win a football game\u2019. Because you can win or lose, but I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s going to die.\n\u201cThis is just the joy of wanting to get better, wanting to have something to say to your grandkids and your friends back home when you have coffee and say you won a game at a World Cup, you got out out of the group.\n\u201cObviously we want to win the game, there\u2019s no doubt about it, and I think we have it in our squad. If we match them in terms of intensity and desire I think we will win.\u201d\nDegenek, a centre-half who can also slot in at right-back, is not guaranteed to start. But he wants to. It\u2019s obvious in the way he talks. He lives for games like this. For fighting not only the 11 Tunisians on the pitch but also the 40,000-odd others in the stands \u2013 the spirited contingent of expats in Qatar who went some way to helping their team draw 0-0 with Denmark.\n\u201cI\u2019m not a technician,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not a guy that\u2019s gonna dribble at 10 players \u2013 I don\u2019t have that ability in me. But I\u2019ve got that heart and desire that no one else can match.\u201d\nHe has big-game experience, too, having spent three years back in Belgrade with Red Star. In 2018, soon after signing, he helped seal the club\u2019s improbable return to the Champions League after a 26-year absence, providing two assists in two minutes to rally from 2-0 down against Red Bull Salzburg in their final qualifying match. While they finished bottom of the group, he played a key role in a 2-0 win over Liverpool.\nThe Serbian SuperLiga and its rambunctious supporters further shaped what he calls his \u201clion mentality\u201d. In June, before Australia\u2019s successful World Cup qualifying playoff against Peru, he explained it to teammates.\n\u201cYou either eat or you get eaten, that\u2019s the simplest way to put it,\u201d says Degenek, who recently signed with MLS outfit Columbus Crew. \u201cI said to the boys: \u2018There\u2019s bread on the table, either we eat tonight \u2013 my kids, my wife and my family \u2013 or they eat and my kids and wife go home to sleep hungry. I don\u2019t want that to happen.\u2019\u201d"

                    "body": "This changes everything. That was the netball world\u2019s collective reaction when Gretel Bueta \u2013 arguably the best player on the planet \u2013 revealed at the weekend she is pregnant, meaning she will miss the World Cup in South Africa later this year and the Super Netball season. The 29-year-old has not played for Australia since last year\u2019s gold medal-winning Commonwealth Games campaign, where she was among the Diamonds\u2019 most dominant players, terrorising defenders with her agility, aggression and accuracy.  Shooting with 96% precision in seven matches, Bueta \u2013 who took up netball late after representing Australia in basketball as a teenager \u2013 scored the second-most goals in the tournament, behind Jamaican icon Jhaniele Fowler, and had a flawless 37/37 final. After announcing and losing a pregnancy late last year, she stepped away to reassess and has since been absent from public view, missing last month\u2019s Quad Series in Cape Town, which the Diamonds won without dropping a game. An Instagram post on Saturday explained why with the announcement that she and husband Niko Bueta are expecting a brother for their two-year-old son Bobby, prompting congratulations from the Queensland Firebirds, Diamonds, fellow players and fans. It also sent a ripple through the sport. If available, Bueta would have been a lock for a spot in the 12-woman World Cup squad and a nightmare for every opposition team to combat. The implications are many, most notably for the world\u2019s No 1 side. The Diamonds will lack a certain shine without her at the World Cup. She is a quintessential \u201cx-factor player\u201d, equally gifted at goal attack as at shooter and as an unconventional player, nearly impossible to match-up one-on-one, as Jamaica found in the Commonwealth final. Even though Australia were able to win the recent Quad Series without her, it is accepted that any Diamonds side is better with Bueta in it.  Stacey Marinkovich knows too that Bueta is not a like-for-like player, someone who can be simply replaced by another. Without her first-picked star, the coach has to pivot and reassess her whole attack end. The original plan for the World Cup may have been to take the same four goalers from Birmingham \u2013 Bueta, vice-captain Steph Wood, Cara Koenen and Kiera Austin \u2013 despite having tried Sophie Garbin, Sophie Dwyer and Donnell Wallam in series since the Games. But that\u2019s no longer an option.  If goal attack Wood and shooter Koenen can stay fit and in form at the Sunshine Coast Lightning this Super Netball season, their places remain safe and they should be the go-to line in Cape Town. But the other two spots are wide open, as Marinkovich now needs more cover at goal shooter. Melbourne Vixen Austin plays most of her minutes at goal attack, can swing to wing attack if needed but is rarely seen in the GS bib, while Garbin runs goal attack at the domestic level for Collingwood but predominantly plays as a holding shooter on the world stage. It\u2019s a big call to pick her for shooter when she\u2019s played an entire season out in front. Then there is 22-year-old Dwyer, a goal attack specialist, and the third Indigenous Diamond, Donnell Wallam, who many thought unlucky to not make the 15-member Quad squad. By most measures, still-green Dwyer isn\u2019t ready but 193cm Wallam, who exclusively plays goal shooter, may be a bolter. It could be argued that the 29-year-old, who also has a basketball pedigree, has many of the same attributes as Bueta; agility, accuracy and an ability to bamboozle opponents with creativity. Like her Firebirds teammate, she is tall, tough and wily.  Although she wasn\u2019t in the selected 12, Wallam travelled to the Commonwealth Games as a training partner, so is familiar with the high-performance environment and has had match-play against the best Australian defenders in camp and in Super Netball matches in recent years. But Wallam lacks big-stage experience, having played just two Tests in the gold dress, both against England, a side on a downward trajectory. But what minutes they were. In her Diamonds debut in Newcastle in late October, Wallam shot at 100% when she came on in the last quarter and showed a calmness that belied her inexperience to sink the winning shot in the dying moments with a lay-up that has gone into netball folklore. It was in the same week she found herself at the centre of the Hancock Prospecting sponsorship furore. In her second outing, she missed just one goal in 37 minutes, and easily carried the weight of goal-scoring responsibilities. Wallam is not a true known quantity though and has not been tested against world-class defenders such as Kelly Jury, Jane Watson and Sulu Fitzpatrick, who will be formidable for the Silver Ferns come the World Cup after a full New Zealand domestic season. England\u2019s defenders have had a look at her, but she retains an air of mystery, which can be a benefit at a World Cup. If the Noongar woman can put together a decent Super Netball season, it might be her name reverberating around Cape Town in the absence of Bueta."

                    "body": "Modern football \u2013 that is, a spectacle you feel a nagging shame from participating in, because like so many other things it seems less about joy and more about money with every passing day \u2013 began in 1974. The global sport\u2019s governing body, Fifa, had previously been a parochial little outfit, a handful of men in suits happily organising World Cups that were simply football tournaments. But, under a new president, Jo\u00e3o Havelange, funds for the global expansion of the game were promised and, with no cash in Fifa\u2019s account, sponsorship deals were signed. Football just as sport for its own sake? That option no longer existed. Now it was brought to you in association with Coca-Cola and Adidas. Fifa Uncovered (Netflix), a four-part documentary, starts its story with the Havelange overhaul and peaks with the FBI making multiple arrests for corruption and racketeering a few decades later. Havelange steadfastly endorsed the 1978 World Cup, hosted by Argentina despite the country having recently fallen to a vicious military dictatorship. Here was a new kind of man in suit, who also saw the opportunity to expand and exploit the sport\u2019s marketing and broadcast potential. By the early 1980s, Adidas boss Horst Dassler had set up a special company, International Sport and Leisure, to which all Fifa\u2019s rights management was outsourced. Neither Fifa nor its member nations saw their fair share of the increasingly huge amount of money involved, but Havelange made sure he himself was lavishly rewarded. Into this pit slid Fifa Uncovered\u2019s main character, Sepp Blatter, a protege of Havelange\u2019s who finally levered him out of his chair in 1998 and remained as president until the house of cards fell in 2015. The standard mix of news archive and interviews with both observers and insiders is employed to explain how, under Blatter, Fifa became if not institutionally corrupt, then certainly very attractive to corrupt men. As well as having too much wonga sloshing about, Fifa\u2019s internal politics made it vulnerable to the self-interested: when presidents or World Cup venues were chosen, smaller nations had the same voting rights as major football hubs, without a strong football culture at home to keep them in check. Men such as Jack Warner , the president of Concacaf (the Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football), and his fantastically monikered sidekick, the American sports administrator Chuck Blazer, took full advantage. Although it drags in its overdetailed final episode and could have been trimmed from four hours to three, Fifa Uncovered for the most part is a queasily thrilling chronicle of allegations and fishy coincidences, with cash appearing in brown envelopes when a big vote is taking place, and disappearing when it ought to be going to worthy development projects. The brazen wrongdoing of some of the individuals involved gives the programme the addictive repulsiveness of a true-crime documentary. That said, the series scores an audience with several big players, then does little with them. The section on how the repressive desert petrostate of Qatar, selected to host the 2022 World Cup, happened to invest heavily in several countries that backed its bid, should climax with its representative being grilled \u2013 but the interviewer stumbles at the crucial moment. Blatter, ever keen to reshape his image via what he imagines is a suave air of authority, keeps popping up to offer irrelevant platitudes rather than confront key questions. Eventually, it is suggested to him that he must bear some guilt for presiding over an executive committee that was so overwhelmingly bent that only one of the 22 members in place when Russia and Qatar were awarded the 2018 and 2022 World Cups is still in post. He expresses regret but denies moral responsibility, while tossing in the idea that he can\u2019t be expected to answer for committee members from \u201cother countries and other cultures\u201d. Bearing in mind that the worst scandals involved delegates from African, Middle Eastern and Caribbean nations, one wonders whether this is insignificant waffle or a patronising sentiment from a perpetually cynical ghoul. With Blatter, it is always so hard to tell. Where Fifa Uncovered does score highly is in its canny portrayal of Fifa under Blatter as representing a wider, late-20th-century malaise: powerful men, compromised by business interests but protected by systems that ensure accountability is an illusion. As the Guardian journalist David Conn suggests that being co-opted by dictatorships is perhaps even worse than taking bribes, we see footage of Gianni Infantino, who succeeded Blatter on a clean-money ticket, glad-handing Vladimir Putin and the Qatari ruling elite. It is a bleak picture, summed up by one of the series\u2019 premier whistleblowers, former Fifa media director Guido Tognoni. \u201cIf you ask if Fifa can ever get away from corruption, you have to ask if the world can ever get away from corruption,\u201d he says. \u201cNo, it can\u2019t. As it is structured now: no. Not possible.\u201d"

                    "body": "Australia woke up to two pieces of news on Sunday morning. One was the Socceroos playing against Lionel Messi\u2019s Argentina(!) in the World Cup\u2019s round of 16(!). The other, dropped at exactly the same time, was the fixture for round one of the 2023 AFL season. This is not a crack at Australian rules football, the sport. Rather, a curious look at the AFL, the organisation. Caroline Wilson, one of the country\u2019s most respected AFL journalists, derided as \u201clame\u201d the perceived attempt to usurp football\u2019s biggest moment and said it should have given the Socceroos some clear air.\nAustralia\u2019s code wars do not need explanation. They have been bubbling away for decades, punctuated by the occasional boilover that sends #SokkahTwitter into the siege mentality to which it is always partial. It felt a bit different on Sunday, though. Almost as though the AFL was \u2026 nervous? Challenged, even? Had November\u2019s draft not enjoyed the same cut-through because eyes were elsewhere?\nThe problem \u2013 if there is one \u2013 is fabricated from within. Because, while Australians cannot get enough of almost any sport on offer, perhaps the one with the least traction in recent times has been football. The very fact the era of 2006 is still the last point of reference for many between then and now is a case in point. Football is not a threat, despite the waves of wonder the Socceroos have sent through society these past 10 days.\n\nFor 16 years, administrators, players, coaches and supporters have tried to grow the game but been curtailed by various forces. Some are of their own making. There was a catastrophic World Cup bid, the gradual sanitisation of fan culture to the point of near-death, the failure to capitalise on an Asian Cup won on home soil, and a lack of appropriate development pathways to prevent children with the right skillset from being poached by other sports. These are only a few examples, but demonstrate the puzzle the game must solve to have even a chance of causing genuine consternation among other codes.\nOther factors have contributed too, most notably a paucity of government funding and corporate investment for all levels of the game, from grassroots to the professional tier. But perhaps the most sizeable challenge is one which could assist all of the above immeasurably but is also sort of an uncontrollable: public opinion.\nTo shift such a thing requires more than marketing campaigns and good football. It takes something significant, like an uncharacteristically deep run at a World Cup. And even that probably won\u2019t alter the status quo overnight. Football Australia and the Australian Professional Leagues, which now runs the A-Leagues, are already making moves to take advantage of this unique moment in time which has swept from Melbourne to Perth and everywhere in between. It is difficult to ignore, but equally as difficult to leverage.\n\nThe A-League Men restarts this weekend and offers an ideal springboard off which to market its now better-known Socceroos. Head to Melbourne City to see Mat Leckie, down to Adelaide United to see Craig Goodwin and to the Central Coast Mariners to see Garang Kuol (for the next few weeks at least) and Jason Cummings.\n\u201cI hope and expect Australians start respecting the A-League, and the quality it has,\u201d the Socceroos coach, Graham Arnold, said in Doha on Saturday, the eve of their 2-1 loss to Argentina. \u201cI\u2019ve been out and about around Europe, and the A-League is as good as most European competitions.\u201d\nGoodwin, who scored Australia\u2019s first goal in Qatar against France, was hopeful public sentiment may begin to translate into meaningful change. \u201cWe hope that we\u2019ve inspired the young generation to push themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hope what we\u2019ve achieved here can help grow the game back home, because the A-League is better than it\u2019s perceived and the quality of Australian football is better than it\u2019s perceived.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s been that way for a long time, but hopefully what we\u2019ve been able to achieve here can put the Australian football on the map and help the game grow.\u201d\nIt can, but attention spans are notoriously short. Not 24 hours after Australia had pushed Argentina until the death, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 was outdoing himself yet again and England were marching mercilessly on. Australia, despite having elicited global praise, are no longer the tournament\u2019s story.\nGoodwin used the word \u201chope\u201d repeatedly after the match. It is probably the correct emotion, because some things cannot be forced or grown at will. Qatar spent its billions engineering a national football team and culture, all for the return of poor results and fan turnout. The Western Sydney Wanderers barely had a dollar or a squad when they were founded in 2012, but did have the highly receptive working class of western Sydney and Tony Popovic as manager. They topped the A-League table in their opening season and won the 2014 Asian Champions League.\nSometimes the pieces just fall into place, through enterprise or luck or a bit of both \u2013 and some other things too. More often, they need considerably more time to arrive at that same place. The Socceroos have woken the Australian public to football, but their achievements will not transform a country\u2019s deeply ingrained sporting inclinations immediately (don\u2019t worry, AFL). What they have done is engineered hope, which is the first step."

On the one hand, the World Cup stimulates the happy child in even the most bereft tea-time email; on the other, the human rights bit triggers the adult in us who frankly doesn\u2019t need any additional triggering. And now there\u2019s a new reason to despair about Qatar 2022, because millions of football fans are at risk of being denied the most basic tournament essential of all: Tin. This is nothing to do with whether you\u2019re allowed to swig flamboyantly from a bottle of Liver Compromiser in the centre of Doha. We\u2019re talking about the pubs and clubs of England, where fans traditionally gather during the World Cup to abuse a gigantic LED screen. Workers at GXO, a company which delivers around 40% of the nation\u2019s Tin, will be on strike for five days at the end of October and the start of November, with more scheduled if the issue is not resolved. The dispute is over a 5% pay offer, which GXO workers have rejected as it is well below the real inflation rate, and you couldn\u2019t possibly care less about the details could you. The Unite union, zeroing in on the essentials, said this would \u201cimpede the ability of pubs and other venues to replenish their cellars prior to the [Human Rights] World Cup\u201d.

Perhaps Pep Guardiola could have a chat with them and get their advice\u201d \u2013 Mike Wilner. \u201cIn response to Tom Dowler\u2019s question: \u2018Which Premier League player would be best suited to play 007 himself\u2019 (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters). For the Daniel Craig era, look no further than James Milner: clearly too old and way past his best, but still able to shake it with the young guns. Who else would you trust more to come out of retirement for one last job and neutralise sadistic terrorists/Phil Foden from destroying the world/Liverpool FC? But for a more classic Bond (suave, sophisticated, looks good in a tux) it has to be Pedro Neto because, you know, he\u2019s just a beautiful, beautiful man\u201d \u2013 Tom Orchard.  \u201cThe role of a Bond villain is to look evil and threaten carnage for 90 minutes before ultimately being outwitted by 007. So if Erling Haaland is the villain, there can only be one candidate for the role of Bond: take a bow, Virgil van Dijk\u201d \u2013 Paul Southgate. \u201cHaaland as a Bond villain? Nah. He\u2019s clearly Karl Vreski, Hans Gruber\u2019s sullen, blond henchman from Die Hard\u201d \u2013 Tom Whiteley. \u201cThere\u2019s more to football than the Premier League! If you just take your tinted glasses off, you\u2019ll see that the Championship, League One and League Two are positively teaming with would-be Bonds. Can\u2019t move for \u2018em.

He will become healthier very soon, I am sure.\u201d\n\nNeymar worried about his tournament after sustaining injury against Serbia. \u201cI was thinking of a million different things,\u201d he said. \u201cI was afraid of not being able to play in this World Cup again but I have the support of all of my colleagues, my family and I tried to look for strength where I could not find it. When I was reading all of the messages of encouragement, it helped my recovery.\u201d\nAfter scoring, Richarlison headed for the Brazil bench to celebrate with Tite, who joined his players for a Samba dance, which the 61-year-old head coach practised at the team hotel. \u201cI try to adapt to my players,\u201d Tite said.\n\u201cThey are very young and have a love of dancing, joking and making moves. They said I had to learn how to do the moves. They\u2019re very tight and difficult, but we kept playing around. Richarlison was there and I said: \u2018What\u2019s that dance?\u2019 I said: \u2018If you do it, then I\u2019ll do it.\u2019 There are various people who will say it was disrespectful. I know there\u2019s always a camera and I didn\u2019t want it to be misinterpreted.\u201d\n\nTite made five changes during the game, including the introduction of Weverton in place of Alisson with 10 minutes to play. As a result, all 26 members of the Brazil squad, including three goalkeepers have now featured in Qatar, becoming the first team in World Cup history to use as many as 26 at a finals. \u201cIt is very difficult to substitute a goalkeeper but when we have the opportunity it is very good because it makes the whole team happy,\u201d Tite said.\n\nBento said he will resign following their exit, with the Portuguese confirming he made his mind up in September to walk away after their World Cup campaign concluded. \u201cI have just announced to the players and to the president of the confederation that I had already taken [the decision] since September,\u201d Bento said.\n\u201cThis was a decision that was set in stone and today I have just confirmed it. I have to thank them for everything they [the players] have done and they have given their very best. I\u2019m very proud to have been their manager.\u201d"

After a strong tackle from Dan Gore on Martial at Carrington, the club\u2019s training base, on Wednesday the Frenchman is thought to have retaliated but the 18-year-old refused to back down. Martial and Gore, a midfielder signed from Burnley in July, were pulled apart and the 26-year-old subsequently apologised to the youngster.  While Ten Hag informed Gore that challenging a first-team player should not occur in the session because of the risk of injury, Martial is one of only a few of the manager\u2019s squad who are not at the Qatar World Cup finals tournament with their respective nations after Didier Deschamps did not select the forward for France\u2019s campaign. On Saturday Deschamps lost Karim Benzema after a training-ground injury but opted not to call up Martial, stating on Sunday that he would not choose to replace his first-choice No 9 despite being allowed to do so under Fifa rules. This followed the head coach choosing Eintracht Frankfurt\u2019s Randal Kolo Muani rather than Martial after Christopher Nkunku also had to withdraw from the tournament last week after also being injured in training."

                    "body": "Sir Jim Ratcliffe\u2019s bid to buy Manchester United would not burden the club with debt if successful, with the billionaire rejecting any leveraged buyout of the type used by the Glazer family. The Ineos owner hopes to paint himself as a safe custodian of the club he supports and in tune with the values of their fanbase, as rival consortiums prepare to formalise their offers for the 20-times English champions.  Raine, the bank in charge of the sale, has set an initial deadline of Friday for bids. Ineos has made the only publicly confirmed offer and under its plan any debt incurred in financing a takeover would be expected to be put on the books of the petrochemicals company. A rival offer is expected from Qatar but the vehicle for any proposal remains unknown. On Thursday questions were raised with the Premier League and Uefa over whether a takeover from the Gulf state could be \u201cindependent of state influence\u201d. At this stage, any offers are non-binding. This essentially makes the first round an opportunity for Raine and the Glazer family to gauge the range of interest. Rumours of multiple bidders, from Elon Musk to Apple or Amazon, have been aired over the past week but the Guardian understands any bidding pool this week is likely to be small . The Glazers will hope to drum up further offers over the coming weeks, and those already in the bidding process are likely to speak more publicly about their intentions. Earning the trust of a fanbase wounded by the Glazer era will probably form part of any strategy, with Ratcliffe perhaps hopeful that setting out his differences from the current owners will help his cause. The 70-year-old is understood to see any acquisition as an opportunity to shape his legacy.  A Qatari deal would have hurdles to clear with football authorities. On Thursday the human rights organisation FairSquare published a letter calling on Uefa\u2019s president, Aleksander Ceferin, and the CEO of the Premier League, Richard Masters, to block any Qatari takeover, arguing: \u201cNo consortium of Qatari investors capable of [acquiring Manchester United] would be able to convincingly demonstrate their independence from the Qatari state.\u201d Uefa rules prevent any owner from exerting \u201ccontrol or influence\u201d over another club in the same European competition. The state-funded Qatar Sports Investments owns Paris Saint-Germain and sources have previously told the Guardian a Qatari deal for United could necessitate changes in Uefa\u2019s rulebook. In his letter the director of FairSquare, Nicholas McGeehan, argues that it would be impossible to separate any Qatari consortium from the possibility of state funding. \u201cChecks and balances on the way in which funds are distributed and used by the [Qatari] ruling family are minimal to nonexistent,\u201d he writes, \u201cwhich would undermine any assurances provided about the sources of funding for such an acquisition.\u201d McGeehan goes on to say: \u201cState ownership of European football clubs jeopardises the integrity of the game, its proclaimed values and its sustainability.\u201d"

                    "body": "They consider themselves pretty hardy in the south Wales valleys town of Treorchy, but there were tears in the eyes of grown men and women as their country\u2019s first World Cup finals adventure for 64 years was dealt the heaviest of blows. Graham Jones, 76, struggled to find the words to describe his mood after watching the game against Iran in the Lion pub. \u201cAbsolutely deflated \u2026 devastated,\u201d was his best attempt. Jones has followed Wales since he was 13 and travelled to Sweden in 1958 to witness the last time they reached the finals. \u201cThat was wonderful,\u201d he said. But he accepted that on Friday the Iranians, who scored two added-time goals, were the better side. \u201cWe held them off as long as we could but we didn\u2019t finish the business.\u201d He cheered up at the idea of at least one more game \u2013 against England on Tuesday. \u201cIf we can beat them, that would be one of the best feelings in the world,\u201d he said. Despite the result, people were reluctant to criticise their team. \u201cI still love them,\u201d said Josie Eddy, 26. \u201cRed wall all the way.\u201d She said she would be helping to organise a screening of the England game at Treorchy boys and girls club next week. \u201cFingers crossed we can still do it.\u201d  Her friend Melanie Green, 49, said she was gutted by the defeat. With a sad smile, she said she planned to try to get over the disappointment by finalising arrangements for Saturday\u2019s Treorchy Christmas parade. \u201cBusy times \u2013 that will distract me,\u201d she said. Treorchy (Treorci in Welsh) and the wider Rhondda Cynon Taf area is probably still more associated with rugby in the sporting imagination, but football has become important here too. In the village of Pentre, just down the road, a blue plaque marks the house where Jimmy Murphy, who led Wales to the World Cup finals in 1958, lived. Four miles away is Tylorstown, the village where the current Wales manager, Rob Page, grew up. Page announced the Welsh squad for Qatar at the Tylorstown miners\u2019 welfare hall. Recalling his early playing days, Page told the Guardian: \u201cYou\u2019d see the wind and the rain driving down the valley and you\u2019re freezing cold. You\u2019d be ankle-deep in mud. Great memories. It shapes you.\u201d  Treorchy certainly threw itself behind the Wales team on Friday, the high street a blaze of red. The Welsh clothing and gift shop opened early to sell last-minute clothes and flags. \u201cYou can\u2019t watch the game without a bucket hat. It\u2019s the law,\u201d said one customer, Jeff Edwards. Even the skeleton in the chiropractor\u2019s wore a bucket hat and a Wales shirt. At Treorchy comprehensive, the receptionist Christine Howells was resplendent in her bucket hat sitting behind a desk surrounded by Welsh flags. She had three screens in front of her to watch the match. \u201cJust in case one or two break down,\u201d she said. The school\u2019s welfare dogs, cocker spaniels Boo and Lottie, wore Welsh bandanas. Students watched the game in the main hall, a sports hall and the gym. The headteacher, Jenny Ford, said she was glad the Welsh government had given schools the option to watch the game. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time coming for Wales to get to the finals so why not?\u201d  The school is big on promoting \u201ccynefin\u201d. There is no direct English equivalent, but it is described in the Welsh curriculum as \u201cthe place where we feel we belong, where the people and landscape around us are familiar, and the sights and sounds are reassuringly recognisable.\u201d Ford said: \u201cComing together for the match is part of that feeling.\u201d Teachers have been discussing with students the human rights controversies that have swirled around the tournament in Qatar, including the wearing of the OneLove armband. \u201cWe\u2019ve challenged our students to think what should Gareth Bale have done,\u201d said Ford. \u201cThere have been some excellent discussions.\u201d Some students decided not to watch the game because of the human rights issues. \u201cThat\u2019s their right too,\u201d Ford said. The students joined in a rendition of Yma o Hyd (Still Here), the defiant Welsh-language folk song that has been adopted by the squad and has become a fan favourite, before standing for the national anthem. And though the result went against Wales, students will not forget the day in a hurry. \u201cThe atmosphere and passion was amazing,\u201d said 14-year-old Seren. Luca, 15, added: \u201cIt was a privilege to be watching the game in our school. It\u2019s a good chance for everyone to bond.\u201d  Kian, also 15, said: \u201cWatching the football brings everybody together.\u201d"

                    "body": "You didn\u2019t really interview Miroslav \u201cCiro\u201d Blazevic. You just sat there, tossed some vague conversational gambit into the air and waited for the charismatic rush of anecdote to sweep you along, which was pretty much how he coached. He had extraordinary energy \u2013 at 75 he went to China to manage the national under-23 side, and had four jobs after that \u2013 and a profound love of football. But what he enjoyed most of all was to talk, particularly about himself. Even 18 months ago, weakened by the cancer that eventually led to his death on Wednesday, two days short of his 88th birthday, Blazevic gave a lengthy interview for the documentary Croatia: Defining a Nation, and his part in leading the country to third place at the 1998 World Cup. It was as though by talking about his greatness and the greatness of those around them, he could make them great, could talk worlds into existence.  An ethnic Croat, Blazevic was born in Travnik in what is now Bosnia and Herzegovina and, after an unexceptional playing career, became coach of Vevey in the regionalised third flight of Swiss football in 1968. One day a cleaner found him working late and asked what he was doing. \u201cOne day,\u201d he said, \u201cI will become national coach of Switzerland.\u201d She laughed. \u201cYes, of course you will,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd one day, I will become Miss Switzerland.\u201d He was right; she wasn\u2019t. \u201cHe would always say he was the best in the world,\u201d said Slaven Bilic, a key part of the Blazevic\u2019s 1998 side. \u201cI\u2019m not saying he was a bad coach or a great coach, but he was the ideal coach for us. Put [Fabio] Capello, [Alex] Ferguson, [Ars\u00e8ne] Wenger in our team and it wouldn\u2019t have worked like it worked with him. He was everybody\u2019s father, a great motivator. \u201cWe didn\u2019t need a coach to teach us how to pass the ball, that kind of thing; he was ideal for us. You would play against, let\u2019s say, Estonia, and you know, it\u2019s Estonia, away. But he would gradually motivate you. He knows every day in his head: \u2018Look, I\u2019m going to make a small incident to wake everybody up a bit, and then I\u2019m going to do this, then I\u2019m going to tell them to go out to a nightclub\u2019 \u2013 then at team meetings he\u2019d be talking about Estonia like it\u2019s fucking Brazil. You know he\u2019s lying; you know it isn\u2019t true, but you say, fuck, yeah, it\u2019s going to be hard. \u201cAnd he would always say, \u2018OK, Estonia\u2019s left-back is whoever,\u2019 and he\u2019s talking about their players, and he\u2019s writing their names, and you know it\u2019s wrong, and you know he\u2019s saying: \u2018This guy, he\u2019s so quick, he\u2019s so good\u2019 \u2013 and you know when he\u2019s talking to you that he\u2019s never seen him in his fucking life.\u201d  But it worked. Croatia, emerging from war, qualified for Euro 96 and then the 1998 World Cup where in the quarter-final they faced Germany, the side that had eliminated them at the same stage two years earlier. \u201cI spent the whole night thinking about theory,\u201d Blazevic recalled. \u201cI had a problem with [Oliver] Bierhoff because I didn\u2019t have a skilled player who could beat him in the air, so I had to stop the crosses coming in. I was thinking about telling the players the story about Rommel and Montgomery. Rommel was much, much better in strategy, but he didn\u2019t have fuel. So the tanks couldn\u2019t move and Montgomery wins. \u201cI was on my way to the dressing room with my theories, and I looked at myself in the mirror and I was a kind of green colour. So I thought: \u2018Oh my God, am I going to die?\u2019 I went to the room where the players were waiting for me \u2013 [Davor] Suker, [Zvonimir] Boban, [Alen] Boksic \u2026 and I had everything drawn on sheets of paper, but I didn\u2019t start to talk about anything. I couldn\u2019t, because I was thinking: \u2018Was I going to die?\u2019 I was looking at the players and there was silence in the dressing room, and after a few moments I saw that they were the same green colour as me. \u201cMy theory was seven or eight minutes long, and I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to keep their attention. They were getting more and more green. So I crumpled my sheets of paper and threw them down. Fuck the theory. So I just said: \u2018You have to go out and die today for the Croatian flag and all the people who have given their lives.\u2019 No dealing with Bierhoff, nothing. You have to understand the psychology of the players. You have to have that sort of relationship with the team, so you can communicate your state of soul. 3-5-2, 4-4-2 \u2013 this is bullshit. What is most important is if they decided to win or not. Are they willing to die on the pitch or not?\u201d And of course they won, 3-0. But Blazevic was nothing if not contradictory. Formations mattered an awful lot when it came to his work pioneering a back three. \u201cI was in the avant-garde,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody played 4-4-2 and I invented 3-5-2. In 1982, I won the Yugoslav championship with Dinamo Zagreb with 3-5-2. And after that the Germans picked it up. It came completely out of nowhere. I had to invent the system because I had a different kind of player in my team. You need elementary organisation and cohesion between the lines. When the opposition has the ball all three lines should be within 20 metres, and you make group attacks on the opposition players. When we win the ball, more and more expansion of the lines, more and more width. There is no depth without width.\u201d  Didn\u2019t Carlos Bilardo claim to have invented 3-5-2 with Argentina? \u201cWhat does that prick know? What year was that?\u201d But it was said with laughter. He knew he was talking self-aggrandising nonsense and he knew I knew he was talking self-aggrandising nonsense but somehow, as Bilic said, it didn\u2019t really matter. If Blazevic said it, you could believe it enough to make it true, and that was how he turned ideas and ambitions into reality."

                    "body": "Ben Chilwell is braced for confirmation that he has been ruled out of the World Cup with a torn hamstring, handing England another defensive headache before they name their squad for Qatar. Chilwell pulled up injured during Chelsea\u2019s victory against Dinamo Zagreb on Wednesday and the left-back expects the results of a scan to confirm his worst fears.  Although the severity of the injury is yet to be fully established, Chilwell is not expected to be available for England and there are fears he has sustained a ruptured tendon, which could rule him out for three months. Gareth Southgate is already sweating on the fitness of Reece James, Kyle Walker and Kalvin Phillips before naming his 26-man squad next Thursday. It is hugely unfortunate timing for Chilwell, who has been building his way back to full sharpness since recovering from a serious knee injury. The 25-year-old has been in good form and had hoped to compete with Luke Shaw for a place as England\u2019s starting left wing-back. The prospect of another lengthy layoff is a devastating development for Chilwell, who missed the second half of last season. There are hopes that Chilwell has sustained only a grade-two tear, which usually leads to between four and six weeks out. A more serious tear would probably mean that Chelsea would still be without him when the club season resumes after the World Cup, which begins on 20 November. Chelsea, who host Arsenal on Sunday, are already without James, Wesley Fofana and N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9. Chelsea\u2019s head coach, Graham Potter, has Marc Cucurella as an alternative to Chilwell. Southgate, however, faces a tricky decision. It remains to be seen whether England\u2019s manager chooses to pick Leicester\u2019s James Justin, Tottenham\u2019s Ryan Sessegnon or Southampton\u2019s Kyle Walker-Peters, who is unlikely to play again before the World Cup because of a hamstring injury. The alternative would be to use the versatile Newcastle right-back Kieran Trippier as Shaw\u2019s deputy. The Arsenal winger Bukayo Saka played at left wing-back during England\u2019s recent defeat by Italy. An issue around using Trippier on the left is that England, who play their opening game against Iran on 21 November, are short of options on the right. James was set to start at right wing-back but is out with a knee injury. Walker is yet to return from groin surgery, though Pep Guardiola has said that the City right-back will be fit. Guardiola has also made optimistic noises about Phillips, but the midfielder is recovering from a shoulder injury and has not played since 14 September. England are not the only team with injury concerns before the World Cup. France have lost Paul Pogba and Kant\u00e9, and South Korea are sweating on Son Heung-min after the Tottenham forward sustained a fractured eye socket during his team\u2019s win over Marseille on Tuesday. It was announced yesterday that the Germany forward Timo Werner has been ruled out of the World Cup with torn ankle ligaments."

                    "body": "It\u2019s not been a good few weeks for Brazilians in yellow football shirts. Six weeks ago, nationalist supporters of the far-right President Jair Bolsonaro had to swallow a painful defeat as his leftist rival Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva won a bitter presidential election. On Friday, the crowds who donned the famous yellow jersey to watch their team in the World Cup quarter-finals were dealing with another reverse, having watched Brazil get dumped out of the tournament by Croatia. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t what we expected,\u201d said Erico Vieira, a 27-year-old who watched the match with friends and family in a S\u00e3o Paulo bar. \u201cWe played well but we couldn\u2019t finish. It was just one of those things. You have to put it down to luck.\u201d  Many other fans were not as generous. Brazil took the lead in the 105th minute of extra-time but were unable to defend their lead. Bruno Petkovi\u0107 scored an equaliser with three minutes of extra-time remaining and then Brazil missed two of their penalties in the shootout. \u201cHow can you lose a goal on the counter-attack with \u2026 minutes remaining in extra-time?\u201d asked an incredulous Paulo Vin\u00edcius Coelho in his column after the game, summing up the thoughts of many fans who believed Brazil had done enough to qualify. It was the fifth time in a row that Brazil have fallen to European opposition in the knockout stages of the World Cup and their drought will now stand at 24 years, the joint longest since they won the first of their five trophies in 1958. Brazil came to Qatar as favourites to lift the title for a record sixth time but were inconsistent throughout, winning three of their first four games but losing to Cameroon, their first ever World Cup defeat to an African nation. Friday\u2019s reverse was particularly tough to take for players such as the 30-year-old former captain Casemiro. \u201cAll defeats are painful, especially when you have a goal and a dream,\u201d the Manchester United midfielder said after the final whistle. \u201cSo it\u2019s difficult, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s difficult to find words. All we can do is keep our heads up, life goes on.\u201d Supporters of all ages had packed bars and restaurants to watch a game that kicked off at noon in most of Brazil. Most companies closed early or gave employees time off to watch the match. The game was tense and Brazil failed to convince but Neymar\u2019s brilliant late goal led to wild celebrations, at least for a few moments. There were still 15 minutes to go but maybe too many people, on and off the pitch, thought the hard work was done. Some people paid their bills and left. They thought it was all over. \u201cThey blew it,\u201d said the yellow-shirted Fabiano N\u00fa\u00f1ez, a Colombian national, now resident in Brazil. \u201cIt was all under control and they took their eye off the ball. It\u2019s a bitter pill to swallow.\u201d Argentina are now the last South American team in the tournament, with a quarter-final against the Netherlands deciding their fate later on Friday evening. Some Brazilians will want their hermanos to progress and win the title for Lionel Messi, a player who is as admired outside Argentina as he is at home. Messi has won every honour available to him bar the World Cup and a large number of Brazilians would like him to add the world title to his dazzling array of silverware. Not barman Tiago Sousa Costa. The 27-year-old watched the Brazil match before service in Le Jazz, a popular S\u00e3o Paulo restaurant. \u201cWe were so shaken,\u201d he said of the 16 colleagues who had gathered. \u201cBut do I want Argentina to win? Are you mad? I want Cristiano Ronaldo. There\u2019s Portuguese blood in these veins.\u201d"

How could Wolstenholme have got that ready? He wasn\u2019t to know people were going to be coming on the pitch. Even if you think, \u2018If there\u2019s a goal today I might say this\u2019, you quickly put it out of your mind because you don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to happen. You\u2019ve got to react to what you\u2019re seeing.\n\u201cIf I am ever thinking of the commentary to come I don\u2019t even hear it in my own voice in my head; I hear it in Brian Moore\u2019s, or Barry Davies\u2019s or John Motson\u2019s voice.\u201d\nMowbray succeeded Motson, fondly remembered for his trademark sheepskin coat, as chief BBC commentator in 2010 and names those he grew up listening to when asked about who he admires most. \u201cThe voices you grew up with are always the ones that stay with you,\u201d he says.\nBroadcasting has changed in the same way football has been transformed, however, and Mowbray points out: \u201cI think back to the first World Cup I commentated on [in 1998 for Eurosport] and I pretty much did my notes 24 hours before, all on paper and handwritten. Now I have a bank of material and I\u2019m constantly adding to it. I don\u2019t want to be the person who misses something.\n\u201cBut my rule of thumb is that I might have six sheets of paper with all the facts and meticulous research and just little titbits to throw in, but if I\u2019m only using a tenth of that then it\u2019s been a terrific game. You only throw these things in when the game is a bit slow. Commentary is about adding \u2013 especially on TV when people can see what\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nHe says his job is \u201cessentially be the narrator and the guide, and just to add a little bit that might be of interest.\u201d He adds: \u201cIt\u2019s a funny game is the World Cup final because it should be the game you invest most energy in of all the games you cover throughout a season, but in it\u2019s at the end of a condensed tournament in which you\u2019ve probably commentated on both teams along the way as well and so you\u2019ve got to think about what you\u2019ve already used.\n\u201cA World Cup final to me is about the occasion. You\u2019ve got to get across the sense of the occasion out there and my own personal way of commentating is that I just enjoy it. I love the big football occasions and hopefully that comes across.\u201d\nAbove all, Mowbray wants his viewers to be entertained. \u201cWe do set out to enjoy it ourselves,\u201d he says of himself and others in the commentary team, \u201cand add to other people\u2019s enjoyment. I certainly never, ever think about the fact of so many people watching this \u2013 it wouldn\u2019t matter to me if there were 10 people or 10 million.\u201d\nAs for the game itself he says: \u201cI\u2019m delighted it\u2019s the final it is now that England are out. We have the South America v Europe clash and we have the two biggest superstars in the game \u2013 Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 who happen to be [Paris Saint-Germain] teammates \u2013 going head to head.\n\u201cI was a little down and homesick before the semi-final but Messi and Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez ripped me out of that. Just in terms of who you want to see play football there\u2019s nobody better on the planet for me than Messi.\u201d\nMaintaining his employer\u2019s neutrality, Mowbray hastened to add: \u201cThat said, I\u2019m not rooting for him.\u201d"

                    "body": "Chelsea have identified Brighton &amp; Hove Albion\u2019s Alexis Mac Allister as an alternative to Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez if a deal for the Benfica midfielder proves too costly during January, while the west London club could also hijack Arsenal\u2019s bid for the Shakhtar Donetsk winger Mykhailo Mudryk.\nFern\u00e1ndez, who established himself as one of the most exciting young players of his generation when he helped Argentina win the World Cup, has emerged as a key target for Graham Potter as he looks to revamp his midfield. Chelsea have contacted Benfica over a deal for the 21-year-old, who was voted the best young player of Qatar 2022, and hope that acting quickly will help them win the race to sign the midfielder.\n\nHowever, Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s contract contains a \u00a3106m release clause and Benfica, who signed the Argentina international from River Plate for an initial \u20ac10m last summer, do not want to lose him during January. The Portuguese club are holding out for the full fee and have told Fern\u00e1ndez, whose deal expires in 2027, that they will give him a significant pay rise if he stays with them until the end of the season. It is understood, though, that Fern\u00e1ndez wants to make the move to Stamford Bridge.\nChelsea, who are also closing in on a deal for the Monaco centre-back Beno\u00eet Badiashile, are reluctant to trigger Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s release clause. Chelsea are hopeful of convincing Benfica to relent on their stance by offering a significant fee up front to secure his services.\nIf that proves impossible then Chelsea have other possibilities in midfield. Mac Allister also starred for Argentina during the World Cup and could be more affordable than Fern\u00e1ndez, although the 24-year-old recently extended his contract at Brighton until 2025.\nPotter coached Mac Allister at Brighton and is keen to bolster his options in midfield. Chelsea are close to extending N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9\u2019s contract before he becomes a free agent in the summer but the Frenchman has not played since suffering a torn hamstring last August. Kant\u00e9 has endured a series of injury problems and is not expected to feature until March.\nJorginho is also out of contract in the summer and there is little clarity over the Italy midfielder\u2019s future at the moment. Potter\u2019s other options in midfield include Mateo Kovacic, Conor Gallagher, Mason Mount, Carney Chukwuemeka and Denis Zakaria, who is on loan from Juventus. Chelsea are interested in Declan Rice and Jude Bellingham but will face heavy competition for the England duo.\nMidfield has been an issue for Chelsea this season and Potter wants more energy, drive and imagination in that area. Fern\u00e1ndez and Mac Allister would both improve the side. Chelsea could revisit a deal for Fern\u00e1ndez in the summer if they cannot sign him now.\nAttack is another priority position for Chelsea, who have lost the striker Armando Broja to injury for the rest of the season. They have lined up a deal for the RB Leipzig forward Christopher Nkunku for the summer but are also interested in Mudryk, who has significant interest from Arsenal.\nShakhtar have already rejected a bid from Arsenal for the Ukraine winger and are holding out for \u00a385m. Mudryk, a quick and tricky winger, impressed for the Ukrainian club during the group stage of the Champions League and has also dazzled at international level. It would be a major coup for Chelsea if they can beat Arsenal to the 21-year-old, who was targeted by Brentford last summer.\nHaving already agreed a deal to sign the striker David Datro Fofana from the Norwegian side Molde, Chelsea are close to making Badiashile their second signing of the window. Personal terms have already been agreed with the 21-year-old, who made his senior international debut in September but missed out on France\u2019s World Cup squad. It is expected that he will cost \u20ac35m, with bonuses still under negotiation."

Especially a grinning Gianni, on whom the TV cameras must fixate at least once a match, though such candid shots are not shared on the stadium big screens, in case he receives the Gideon Osborne at London 2012 treatment. But why is everyone ruddy bloody loving it so much? One idea relentlessly floated by the tournament\u2019s advocates is that the booze ban imposed as last orders rang before the big kick-off has stopped hooligans getting lagered and bringing the ruckus in the fashion they actually didn\u2019t do much of at any of the Russian, Brazilian or South African World Cups.\nOf course, no booze has also made it safer for women, what with no beery, leery drunks around. And that may be so, for female tourists or media at least, though Qatar itself has a rather different attitude than in the west, women\u2019s rights restricted by the country\u2019s male guardianship laws. In the corporate boxes, it is assumed everyone can hold their freely available Budweiser and not make female visitors uncomfortable, as phenomenal wealth will always buy that sort of politesse. In the stadiums themselves, beyond those colourful scenes of fans mugging for the cameras, and despite some deft manoeuvres from the host broadcasters, there looks a plentiful supply of seats too. And that includes Monday\u2019s 4-1 shellacking of South Korea by a Brazil team bringing their dancing shoes.\n\nAt previous World Cups, the thought of the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o playing their jogo bonito samba-style and other overused cliches in front of empty seats would be unthinkable, but plastic blue lids were freely visible for the 974 BoxPark recyclable stadium\u2019s final stand. But thank Gianni for the sight of the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o playing their jogo bonito samba-style and other overused cliches, to make the HRWC feel like an actual real Copa do Mundo. From Le\u00f4nidas da Silva to Didi, to Clodoaldo to Denilson and his mates juggling to Sergio Mendes in an airport for a footwear manufacturer, Brazil have always brought the moves. \u201cWe have 10 different dances,\u201d roared Richarlison at full-time. His goal, Brazil\u2019s third, included their coach, Tite, adopting the John Sergeant/Gregg Wallace dad-dancing role.\nCue furrowed brows from Proper Football Men in the gantry, Roy Keane and Graeme Souness not missing their cue on ITV. In Ireland, another Didi, Hamann, joined in on RT\u00c9. \u201cThe dancing in the first half, and then taking the keeper off,\u201d he wailed, after Tite had extended the party to include third-choice goalie Weverton. The Wev\u2019s second-half arrival meant every member of the 26-man squad has played at this HWRC. But will Brazil still be dancing against Argentina, and before that, Croatia in the quarters? The PFM hope not, after such disrespect to the game. But Gianni\u2019s fun franchise really needs them to keep doing so.\nLIVE ON BIG WEBSITE!\nJoin John Brewin from 3pm GMT for MBM coverage of Morocco 1-2 Spain, before Rob Smyth is on deck at 7pm for Portugal 0-0 Switzerland (aet, 4-2 pens).\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\n\u201cI went on [to the pitch] and consoled all the boys first and then shook [Lionel] Messi\u2019s hand.

It\u2019s execrable, ignorant dross. We have watched almost every game on the Spanish language feed on Univision instead, and even though we don\u2019t speak a lot of Spanish it\u2019s infinitely better than the inane drivel coming from the mouths of the Fox presenters and commentators. Count yourselves lucky if you don\u2019t live in the USA! USA!! USA!!! We flipped on the pre-game yesterday to hear Landon Donovan and Alexei Lalas being introduced as \u2018World Cup royalty\u2019 and beat it in a big hurry. On a happier note, we\u2019re coming over to the UK for Christmas and meeting a friend in Cambridge. None of us know Cambridge at all well, can you recommend a decent pub for lunch?\u201d \u2013 Steve Marron.\n\n\nSlightly late, but had to gird my loins and sign up. In the Wales v England MBM coverage, a reader asked if there was some sort of secret inside-left factory set up in the early-2000s. Yes, there was. In my son\u2019s under-12 team, everyone wants to be Cristiano Ronaldo or Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, and spend their time dribbling down the left and practicing their celebrations (before realising it\u2019s actually quite hard). This is particularly galling for me as the defensive coach on the team \u2013 it seems there are no 12-year-olds wanting to be the next Steve Bruce\u201d \u2013 Pete Smith.\n\n\nWith all of the underdogs having fallen in the last 16 so far, it\u2019s now up to Morocco to keep the quarter-finals from becoming a club of all the usual suspects.

It would have been nice if we could have played better, but it\u2019s breathed life and awareness into our culture, our language. It\u2019s brought everyone together.\u201d Despite the result, Gareth, clutching his Welsh dragon flag, insisted: \u201cI think Wales is the best team in the world.\u201d Wrexham is so keen on its football that it set up two fan zones. On a bitterly cold Tuesday evening, thousands gathered outside a big screen on the high street in front of the Wynnstay Arms Hotel, where the Football Association of Wales (FAW) was founded, to watch the match with an English-language commentary. Wrexham is a border city, with many English people living and working here, but they stayed at home or at least did not wear their colours, leaving the streets a sea of red.  Hundreds also watched the game with Welsh-language commentary in the cosier surroundings of T\u0177 Pawb (Everyone\u2019s House), a market/arts space. Mei Emrys, a musician who warmed up the T\u0177 Pawb crowd before the game with some rousing Welsh tunes, admitted he was \u201cslightly disappointed\u201d Wales had not played as well as they could. \u201cBut two generations haven\u2019t even seen Wales get to a World Cup. You hope we\u2019ll be back for the Euros in two years and the next World Cup. And it\u2019s been more about the football team. You won\u2019t get a better stage than this to promote Wales, our language, our culture.\u201d Geraint Jones, who helps run the Welsh shop, Siop Siwan, in T\u0177 Pawb, has followed the city\u2019s club, Wrexham AFC, and the national team since he was a boy. The last time Wales beat England \u2013 at Wrexham\u2019s Racecourse ground in 1984 \u2013 he came home from college in Bangor to watch it. \u201cBut I had man flu so stayed at home. I should have crawled there.\u201d Welsh \u2013 Cymraeg \u2013 is Jones\u2019s first language, and he is glad it has received such prominence this World Cup. \u201cThe way the FAW has integrated the language has been great. They\u2019ve had the Welsh speakers like Aaron Ramsey and Ben Davies doing press conferences in Welsh \u2013 fantastic.\u201d  Like cities, towns and villages across Wales, Wrexham (Wrecsam in Welsh) has relished this World Cup. The museum has a wonderful exhibition of Welsh football shirts through the ages, including a top Mel Charles wore when he represented Wales in the 1958 World Cup. The city has organised football sticker swap points, flag screen-printing workshops and scarf-making clubs. Councillor Nigel Williams, the lead member for economy and regeneration, said now, more than ever, football was at the heart of Wrexham: \u201cIt\u2019s a huge part of our culture.\u201d Wrexham AFC has been in the headlines across the globe since the US actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney bought the club. \u201cWe get tourists from all over the world now because of them,\u201d said Williams. \u201cThey visit London, Windsor and then come to Wrexham.\u201d The profile Wales has enjoyed at the World Cup will help that, he said.  After the final whistle, Yma o Hyd (Still Here), the defiant Welsh-language folk song that has been adopted by the squad and become a fan favourite, blared from the speakers at T\u0177 Pawb and in venues across the city. Wayne Jones, landlord of the pub next door to the Racecourse, the Turf, said: \u201cThis competition has meant everything for the people of Wales after a 64-year wait. The players will come home with their heads held high. We won\u2019t ever forget what the likes of Gareth Bale, Ramsey and Davies have given us. We\u2019re not disappointed; we\u2019re proud.\u201d"

                    "body": "\u201cLionel Messi finally notched his first goal in a World Cup knockout game on Saturday,\u201d writes Andy Bailey. \u201cThis made me wonder: who has scored the most in knockout matches?\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t the easiest question to answer because of the different ways the World Cup has been structured over the years. In 1934 and 1938, there were nothing but knockout games (albeit with only 16 teams). In 1950, and then from 1974-82, there was a second group stage which replaced some of the knockout rounds. For example, in 1982, Paolo Rossi scored a hat-trick in Italy\u2019s legendary 3-2 win over Brazil \u2013 a de facto quarter-final, but not technically a knockout game.\nFor the purposes of this question we\u2019ve only included matches that were knockout fixtures in name and nature. That also means excluding the third-placed playoff, as it\u2019s usually a glorified friendly.\n\nThe list is dominated \u2013 who knew \u2013 by Brazilians, with the original Ronaldo top of the pops. He scored 15 goals at the World Cup, second only to Germany\u2019s Miroslav Klose, and more than half of them were in knockout games. In 1998 he hit two against Chile in the last 16 and then put Brazil ahead in their thrilling semi-final against the Netherlands.\nFour years later, in one of the great comeback stories, he helped see off Belgium in the last 16, then scored the only goal against Turkey in the semi-final and the only goals against Germany in the final. His last knockout punch came in Germany in 2006, when he beat the Ghana keeper Richard Kingson with a delicious stepover.\nThat goal puts Ronaldo one ahead of two other Brazilians, Pel\u00e9 and Vav\u00e1 \u2013 who both scored three of their seven knockout goals in World Cup finals \u2013 as well as the Czech forward Oldrich Nejedly. Nejedly played nothing but knockout games at the World Cup, six of them in total. He scored five times in 1934, including a hat-trick to beat Germany in the semi-final, and two in 1938.\n\nRonaldo might soon be overtaken by Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, whose pair of screamers against Poland were his fourth and fifth at the business end of the competition.\nHere\u2019s the full list of those with at least five goals in World Cup knockout ties:\n8 goals: Ronaldo (Brazil, 1998-2006).\n7: Oldrich Nejedly (Czechoslovakia, 1934-38), Pel\u00e9 (Brazil, 1958-70), Vav\u00e1 (Brazil, 1958-62).\n6: Le\u00f4nidas (Brazil, 1934-38; +2 in third-place playoff), Gary Lineker (England, 1986-90), Gyorgy Sarosi (Hungary, 1934-38).\n5: Roberto Baggio (Italy, 1990-98; +1 in third-place playoff), Eus\u00e9bio (Portugal, 1966; +1 in third-place playoff), Miroslav Klose (Germany, 2002-14), Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 (France, 2018-22), Silvio Piola (Italy, 1938), Wesley Sneijder (Netherlands, 2006-14), Zinedine Zidane (France, 1998-2006), Gyula Zsengeller (Hungary, 1938).\nNB: had we included goals in the second group stage, and we\u2019re still umming and ahhing over it, four other players would have made the list: Paolo Rossi (Italy, 1978-82) with 7 and Ademir (Brazil, 1950), Mario Kempes (Argentina, 1974-82) and Gerd M\u00fcller (West Germany, 1970-74) all with 6.\nSelected others:\n4: Garrincha (Brazil, 1958-66), Geoff Hurst (England, 1966-70), Diego Maradona (Argentina, 1982-94), Gerd M\u00fcller (West Germany, 1970-74; +2 in second group stage).\n3: Franz Beckenbauer (West Germany, 1966-74), Just Fontaine (France, 1958; +4 in third-place playoff), Michel Platini (France, 1978-86), Paolo Rossi (Italy, 1978-82; +4 in second group stage).\n2: Gabriel Batistuta (Argentina, 1994-2002), Bobby Charlton (England, 1962-70), Harry Kane (England, 2018-22), Mario Kempes (Argentina, 1974-82; +4 in second group stage), Rom\u00e1rio (Brazil, 1990-94).\n1: Thierry Henry (France, 1998-2010), Lionel Messi (Argentina, 2006-22), Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s (Hungary, 1954, Spain, 1962).\n0: Johan Cruyff (Netherlands, 1974; +3 in second group stage), Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal, 2006-22), Marco van Basten (Netherlands, 1990).\nBig wins, little reward\n\u201cSpain almost failed to qualify for the knockout rounds despite beating Costa Rica 7-0,\u201d notes Emily Bartram. \u201cHas any team had such a big victory in their opening game yet failed to get out of the group?\u201d\nThey have indeed. Hungary started the 1982 World Cup by famously trouncing El Salvador 10-1, but the next two matches were an uncomfortable step up in class. They were thrashed 4-1 by Argentina and then, in a game they had to win to make their goal difference count, drew 1-1 with Belgium. Hungary finished on three points (two for a win in those days), one behind Argentina and two behind Belgium.\nIn the same tournament, Scotland started with a 5-2 win over New Zealand before losing 4-1 to Brazil and drawing 2-2 with the Soviet Union. That\u2019s the second-biggest victory in the opening game by a team that was eliminated in the group stages.\nEcuador, Belgium and Saudi Arabia were all eliminated despite winning their opening games in Qatar. But the last example of a team starting with a handsome victory \u2013 let\u2019s say by three goals or more \u2013 and still failing to go through was in 2006. The Czech Republic looked the part in dismantling the USA 3-0, but they were well beaten by Ghana and Italy in their subsequent matches.\nAt the 1970 tournament, Belgium beat El Salvador 3-0 in their first match, but then lost to the Soviet Union and the hosts Mexico.\nIn total, seven sides have gone out after taking four points (or three when it was two for a win) from their first two matches.\n\n1974 Italy, Scotland\n2002 Cameroon, Costa Rica\n2006 South Korea\n2010 Slovenia\n2022 Ecuador\n\nThis being a tale of group-stage misery, Scotland probably have the best yarn. In 1974 they beat Zaire 2-0 before drawing 0-0 with the champions Brazil. But their relatively modest win over Zaire (who lost 9-0 to Yugoslavia and 3-0 to Brazil) meant they had to win their final game against Yugoslavia to avoid going out on goal difference. Scotland drew 1-1 and had the irritating distinction of being the only unbeaten team in the entire tournament.\nA couple of teams, Chile in 1930 and Yugoslavia in 1950, were eliminated in the first group stage despite winning their first two games, though that\u2019s not as unlikely as it sounds: on both occasions only the top team went through. A more famous example came later in the 1950 tournament, which was decided by a second four-team group. The hosts Brazil looked irresistible in beating Sweden 7-1 and Spain 6-1, only to lose 2-1 to Uruguay in one of the most dramatic games in football history.\n\nLast, but at least \u2026\n\u201cJapan have won Group E, despite losing to Costa Rica, who finished bottom of group E. Has this happened before in a four-team World Cup group?\u201d asks Mark Holt.\nIt actually occurred 24 hours earlier, when Argentina won Group C and Saudi Arabia finished bottom. In the era of four-team groups it has been pretty rare for the winners to lose to anyone, never mind the team finishing bottom, but it has happened on a few other occasions. Four, to be precise, with Cameroon\u2019s dead rubber (for them) defeat to the Soviet Union in 1990 the most eye-catching. They are:\n\n1990 Cameroon 0-4 Soviet Union (Group B)\n1994 Mexico 0-1 Norway (Group E)\n2010 Germany 0-1 Serbia (Group D)\n2018 Sweden 1-2 Germany (Group F)\n\nHello, goodbye\n\u201cWhen was the last time that neither team from a World Cup opening match qualified for the following round?\u201d asks Matt Reilly.\nSomewhere in the distant past, Qatar lost 2-0 to Ecuador in the first game of the 2022 tournament, and neither team was able to get out of Group A. To find the last time this happened, you have to go back to the day of simultaneous opening matches. The 1962 World Cup began with four games, one in each group. Two of them (Uruguay 2-1 Colombia and Argentina 1-0 Bulgaria) were played by teams who would fail to reach the knockout rounds.\nKnowledge archive\n\u201cIs it true that one of the goalscorers in the inaugural World Cup final between Uruguay and Argentina had only one arm?\u201d asked Trevor Miller in 2006.\nIndeed he did, Trevor. Uruguayan striker H\u00e9ctor Castro was that man, having lost the lower part of his left limb in an unfortunate carpentry accident at the age of 13. Not that this swayed him from his dream, mind, as he went on to represent his country and even score the last-minute clinching goal in the 4-2 win over Argentina in 1930.\n\nCan you help?\n\n\u201cDuring France\u2019s match with Tunisia, there were 15 French-born players on the field at kick-off,\u201d observes Chai in Atalanta. \u201cFrance had nine (everyone apart from Mandanda and Camavinga) and Tunisia had six (Ghandri, Talbi, Kechrida, Skhiri, Laidouni, Khazri). Is this a record for the number of players born in the same country for an international match?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAs I write, we are 20 games into the League Two season and only four different players have scored an EFL goal for Gillingham,\u201d mails Chris Matterface. \u201cWhat\u2019s the lowest number of players to have scored for a team in a complete season?\u201d\n\nMail us your questions or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU.\n"

                    "body": "As the unflappable presenter of World of Sport for almost two decades, Dickie Davies, who has died aged 94, was distinctive for the white quiff in his fringe and a name that stuck in people\u2019s minds. In 1965 when he first filled in as the summer replacement for Eamonn Andrews on ITV\u2019s Saturday afternoon answer to the BBC\u2019s Grandstand, he was billed as Richard Davies. Three years after taking over as the regular presenter in 1968, he was given some advice by Jimmy Hill, the football player and manager-turned-TV executive who was head of sport at LWT, which produced the programme. \u201cMy wife called me Dickie but, in the television world, it was considered Richard sounded much more proper,\u201d recalled Davies. \u201cOn our way to a game of golf one day, Jimmy said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you just tell them you want to be known as Dickie?\u2019 The difference it made was phenomenal.\u201d Hill completed the transformation by encouraging Davies to wear the dapper suits for which he was known off screen and to grow a moustache and sideburns. Over the next 17 years, until World of Sport was axed in 1985, these attributes \u2013 combined with a beaming smile \u2013 made Davies one of TV\u2019s most recognisable stars. Later, hosting programmes on single sports events, he donned his tuxedo to present the richest fight in boxing history, Marvin Hagler v Sugar Ray Leonard, from Las Vegas (1987).  At its height, World of Sport\u2019s five-hour programme would begin with the football preview show, On the Ball, and end with the day\u2019s results. Sandwiched in between would be live horse racing and professional wrestling, which gained a cult following for its showbiz approach to pre-recorded bouts featuring Big Daddy, Giant Haystacks, Jackie Pallo, Mick McManus and others who became household names, along with the commentator Kent Walton. Davies said: \u201cI was never a great wrestling fan. I never thought of it as a sport, but we used to get six to 10 million people watching it every Saturday, so the success of it can\u2019t be denied.\u201d  World of Sport filled the rest of its schedule with domestic sports such as golf, darts, speedway, rallying and angling, along with a curious mix of minority sports bought in from abroad such as cliff diving, log rolling and barrel jumping \u2013 largely a necessity because the BBC had bought the rights to most major events. The programme was axed after horse racing moved to Channel 4 and ITV looked to move up market. Born in Wallasey, Cheshire (now in Merseyside), he was the son of Ellen (nee Owen) and Owen Davies and attended William Ellis school, north London, and Oldershaw grammar school in Wallasey. Following national service in the RAF, he worked as a clerk in an amusement arcade at New Brighton. He then joined Cunard and became assistant purser on the Queen Mary, beginning 10 years at sea. He was eventually head purser on the Queen Elizabeth, organising the entertainment \u2013 \u201ca glorified redcoat\u201d, as he described it.  During time on dry land in New York, he discovered his passion for snazzy suits, bought from the Suicide Shop on Third Avenue, which sold clothes straight out of the city\u2019s mortuary \u2013 some previously worn by gangsters. A cruise passenger who worked for the American TV network NBC recognised Davies\u2019s talent behind the microphone as he called bingo and introduced the ship\u2019s entertainment turns, and advised him to look for work in television. After arriving back in Southampton, Davies met the broadcast journalist Julian Pettifer, who secured him an interview at Southern Television, the ITV company broadcasting to the south and south-east of England. As a result, in 1961, he left the high seas behind and landed a job as an announcer. He also read the news on the regional magazine programme Day By Day and hosted the 1962 and 1963 runs of the talent show Home Grown. During his years on World of Sport, Davies also presented the magazine programme Sportsworld from 1972 to 1977 and the football challenge show All in the Game (1976-77), as well as hosting other events such as boxing, the European athletics championships and the European and world figure skating championships. He fronted coverage of four Olympic Games (1968, 1972, 1980 and 1988) and continued to present FA Cup finals, boxing, snooker and gymnastics events. A popular guest on TV game shows, Davies hosted one himself for Channel 4, Jigsaw (1987), and devised and presented the ITV quiz show Sportsmasters (1989-90), retitled Grand Sportsmasters for its final run in 1991. That year, Davies anchored the satellite channel Eurosports\u2019s snooker coverage before becoming sports editor (1992-95) of the newly launched radio station Classic FM, presenting bulletins from a studio in his home six days a week. In 1995, he suffered a stroke, which affected his speech, but he recovered it through therapy. He then presented TV shows for Sky such as Bobby Charlton\u2019s Football Scrapbook (1995-99), analysing classic football matches with players who took part, and Dickie Davies\u2019s Sporting Heroes (1998). In 2005, he returned to ITV to host a one-off World of Sport special as one of the programmes marking the network\u2019s 50th anniversary. In 1962, Davies married Liz Hastings, who worked with him at Southern Television as a vision mixer. She survives him, along with their twin sons, Daniel and Peter, and four grandchildren. \u2022 Dickie (Richard John) Davies, television presenter, born 30 April 1928; died 19 February 2023"

                    "body": "NOW YOU SEE HIM, NOW YOU DON\u2019T A penny for the thoughts of Josko Gvardiol after he woke up in Qatar this morning. After untangling his limbs and summoning team doctors to untwist his blood, the Croatia defender could have been forgiven for cussing the name of Lionel Messi to the high heavens. Having worked so hard to establish himself as one of the players of the tournament, the 20-year-old\u2019s efforts were undone in a few seconds. Argentina\u2019s scurrier-in-chief twisted him this way and that down the touchline, before sending Josko skittering haplessly into the middle of next week with a drop of his shoulder as he rounded his outside and nutmegged him to tee up Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez. A routine finish cemented Argentina\u2019s place in the final and poor old Josko\u2019s place in the official Fifa Human Rights World Cup end-of-tournament montage. Should Argentina go on to win it is one that will be repeated endlessly and at least Gvardiol\u2019s need for a protective mask means that in years to come he can tell his grandchildren there\u2019s no proof it was actually him. In truth, the poor sod did little wrong and almost everything right but increasingly this World Cup looks like Messi\u2019s, while the rest of us are just watching or providing pratfalls by playing in it.  \u201cI just wanted to say: the World Cup final is coming and sure, we all want to win the cup,\u201d said Sofia Mart\u00ednez, an Argentinian answer to Geoff Shreeves, in her post-match interview. \u201cI just want to tell you that no matter the results, there\u2019s something that no one can take from you and is the fact you resonated with Argentinians. Truly, you made your mark in everyone\u2019s life and that to me is beyond winning any World Cup.\u201d A humbled Messi seemed genuinely touched by the kind sentiments, a far cry from: \u201cWell Lionel, what message do you think that win sends your PSG teammates Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 or Achraf Hakimi, one of whom will have to try to stop you in the final?\u201d While Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s France are white-hot favourites to see off Hakimi\u2019s Morocco in this evening\u2019s semi-final, theirs is not a task that should be taken even remotely lightly. The first African side to make it this far in World Cup history, Walid Regragui\u2019s men have conceded just one goal \u2013 an own goal \u2013 all tournament and their otherwise watertight defence is complemented by a propensity for the kind of lethal counter-attacks that would make Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and Antonio Conte feel all warm and gloopy inside. However, there is a feeling that a raft of mid-tournament knacks to key players may finally catch up with Morocco. Barring medical miracles they will be missing three of their first-choice back four as well as their suspended, key impact sub Walid Cheddira. All of which is not to write off Morocco, who will have a stadium full of fans, the folks back home, an entire continent and most of the footballing world behind them as they set about pulling off the kind of football miracle that, at the start of the tournament, would have made Leicester\u2019s famous 2016 title win seem little more than routine.

                    "body": "  12.22pm   Summary  Thanks for joining me today on an historic occasion for Australian football. Stay tuned for live coverage of the day\u2019s remaining three matches with Poland v Saudi Arabia up next. I\u2019ll see you back here soon.     12.19pm    Harry Souttar was a giant out there, literally and metaphorically. He\u2019s had a word to Australian TV.  It feels great, it was an absolute battle out there. Both teams going at it. We were hanging on a little bit towards the last ten, 15 minutes. But all the lads put their bodies on the line, making tackles, making the blocks. It was just an amazing feeling and that relief to go over the line and to get three points. We know we could have played better in the France game, we were disappointed with ourselves and the manner of the goals we conceded. But I think everyone defending to really put that right. Yes, just so happy we got through. I don\u2019t think I was on the ball much, just trying to defend the box. And every single one of us did that exceptionally well. Coming for crosses, taking pressure off the back four, the midfield dropping back for wing-backs, the wingers took again doing unbelievable and so pleased for everyone. The players, the staff, please for the manager.       12.15pm    Here\u2019s Emma Kemp\u2019s match report hot off the press.      12.14pm    Here\u2019s Arnie:  I\u2019m proud of the boys for showing that great fighting Aussie spirit. We were in their faces all the time. I hope we made the nation very proud. Look, the other night, we played against the current world champions and the boys had the same effort level. The effort level was incredible. Again, when the doubters hate us, bring it on. After the first game I said it was the best friendly we could have had against France. Because you make a small mistake and you get punished. And a lot of those mistakes were removed tonight and I could not be more proud of the boys. Incredible effort. The Australian fans here, great support. And now we move forward.      12.11pm    France still top group D on three points but it\u2019s now on goal difference from Australia. Denmark and Tunisia are languishing on one point with both still yet to play the French.  It\u2019s looking bad for the Eagles of Carthage from here, and Denmark will have added motivation for their clash with the World Cup holders later today.      12.06pm    Mitch Duke is so happy he\u2019s got tears in his eyes.   No words, such a big moment for my family and the supporters. It is the best feeling in the world, but try not to get too caught up because there is one more game to win and get out of the group. The best moment of my life and my football career, there are no words. Just so happy and proud of the boys. We made so many sacrifices to get here. It is the best feeling in the world. Honestly, I will go to war with these boys. A huge shift by the lads, keeping the clean sheet and getting a result, we fought until the end, everyone gave 110% and that is all you can ask. We showed the Aussie spirit and we got the result.      12.04pm         12.04pm         12.04pm         12.03pm    Harry Souttar was phenomenal. That was the performance of his life. Aaron Mooy and Jackson Irvine were combative and smart in midfield. Mat Ryan was authoritative in goal. Craig Goodwin, Mitch Duke and Matt Leckie were tireless. A banner night for Arnold\u2019s famous Australian DNA and the Aussie battlers. Expect to win, done done done.     12.01pm    It wasn\u2019t the prettiest match. Quality football was at a premium. But Australia were resolute, scrapped from start to finish, and deserved the three points. What a moment for Graham Arnold as he brings his charges into a huddle with Martin Boyle on crutches in the middle.      11.59am    Just Australia\u2019s third ever win at the World Cup finals. It keeps the Socceroos alive going into the final group game against Denmark and heaps pressure on the Danes who face France later.     11.58am   Full-time: Tunisia 0-1 Australia  A famous victory for the Socceroos!     11.57am    90+5 mins: Australia have dropped deep, Tunisia are lumping long diagonal balls into the final third. None of them cause any threat to a Socceroo rearguard action that is so committed.     11.56am    90+4 mins: Superb claim from Ryan, commanding his area and plucking a cross out of the sky on the penalty spot with bodies all around him. Tunisia running out of time.      11.54am    90+3 mins: Tunisia take an age to feed the ball into the box and when they do Australia have enough bodies to snuff out any danger. Mooy then does superbly to clear, forcing Sassi into accepting a yellow card for a deliberate handball.      11.53am    90+2 mins: What have Tunisia got left? Not enough to get through Harry Souttar who stands tall for the umpteenth time.     11.52am    90 mins: Australia have done so well all night putting bodies on the line and committing to winning the second and third challenges. Aaron Mooy especially has excelled in a blue collar midfield display.  Six minutes of injury time.      11.51am    88 mins: Tunisia are building. Kechrida gets free down the right and his pullback finds Khazri but his effort is weak and straight at Ryan.   Updated at 11.59am GMT    11.50am    87 mins: Sliti comes again, this time exchanging passes and making his way into the box but there\u2019s no clear shooting opportunity. A cross-shot from the left is then drilled straight at Ryan.      11.49am    86 mins: Souttar again! Tunisia threaten to break in behind but the Aberdonian stretches out one of his go-go Gadget legs and interrupts Khenissi at full speed.  Updated at 11.49am GMT    11.47am    85 mins: Souttar again brilliant stepping up from the back to nip the ball off the feet of Khazri allowing Mooy to clear.  More subs for Australia with Goodwin and Leckie making way for Awer Mabil and Keanu Baccus.      11.46am    84 mins: Montassar Talbi with a rare shot on target, but it was straight at Ryan from a long way out and the Australian skipper handles it with aplomb.      11.45am    82 mins: Tunisia work a couple of passes down the left to generate enough space for a cross that Souttar smuggles behind. Khazri whips in a dangerous corner but the Socceroos are committed at the near post. Souttar is there again to snuff out danger with Tunisia punishing a soft turnover in midfield.      11.42am    79 mins: Tunisia try route one, but it\u2019s meat and drink for a side schooled in Fitba corner. Souttar wins the aerial battle then Mooy mops up on the ground and sets up some nice ball retention. Everything is starting to get a bit leggy and stretched but Tunisia continue to offer little imagination or wit.  Updated at 11.42am GMT    11.40am    77 mins: Australia shift the ball around nicely in midfield. Mooy and Irvine have linked well all night, and Goodwin and Behich have always offered an outlet on the left. Leckie tries to keep the move alive but in his desperation he feels the effect of cramp and goes to ground clutching his toes before the trainer comes on with some pickle juice.      11.37am    75 mins: Dangerous cross from the right from Tunisia that Rowles can only flick on to Msakni, hit he can\u2019t react quickly enough to divert an effort on target. Degenek on for Karacic for Australia at right fullback.      11.36am    73 mins: Mooy flashes a half-volley just over the angle of post and bar.  More changes for Tunisia with Bronn and Jebali replaced by Taha Khenissi and Wajdi Kechrida.      11.34am    71 mins: Australia inches away from a second! Behich does well winning possession then finding Goodwin, who helps the ball onto Maclaren in the channel. His cross flies across the face of goal but the onrushing Leckie can\u2019t execute his slide in time. Tunisia go down the other end and Msakni draws a sharp save from Ryan at his near post. The ball isn\u2019t cleared fully and another effort arrives from range but straight into Ryan\u2019s breadbasket.   Updated at 12.04pm GMT    11.32am    70 mins: Maclaren\u2019s first touch is a cheap turnover, but Hrustic\u2019s is a lovely piece of skill to get behind the Tunisian defence, but he is obstructed and unlucky not to be awarded a free-kick. Tunisia are now the side dominating possession, but it\u2019s slow ball with plenty of sideways passes and Australia\u2019s defence alert to step up whenever anything is played vertically.      11.30am    68 mins: Now it is time for Tunisia\u2019s No 10, Wahbi Khazri. He gets the final quarter, replacing A\u00efssa La\u00efdouni.      11.28am    67 mins: Tunisia link a series of passes neatly through the lines and a cute backheel fashions a shooting opportunity for Msakni but his effort is blocked by a forest of bodies in the box. Abdi then tries to slide in Jebali but Souttar is too strong.      11.26am    65 mins: Ali Abdi has his name taken for pulling back Irvine with Australia threatening to break from midfield.      11.25am    64 mins: Jamie Maclaren and Ajdin Hrustic come on for the Socceroos. Mitch Duke and Riley McGree make way. Both put in committed shifts and can be proud of their efforts.      11.24am    63 mins: I wonder why Wahbi Khazri hasn\u2019t seen any action yet? I think plenty of Tunisians are asking the same question.       11.23am    62 mins: Awful from Sassi the sub. Tunisia shift the ball quickly into the final third but Sassi has no patience to build an attack, instead larruping a wild swipe from distance miles wide.      11.22am    60 mins: Nice skill on the left from Msakni but his cross is too close to Ryan who slaps clear. Abdi then tries to feed the ball into the box but Souttar is positioned well to head away.      11.20am    58 mins: Australia have absorbed Tunisia\u2019s reaction after half-time and settled back into their game. Jalel Kadri needs to shake things up a bit or this result will slide out of his reach.      11.18am    56 mins: Tunisia now playing the ball neatly in the middle third with Australia dropping off into a low block. Still the Socceroos find the turnover, Leckie battles hard to retain possession, Irvine carries the ball forward, Goodwin drills a tempting cross along the six-yard box but there\u2019s nobody on hand to finish.      11.16am    54 mins: Another free-kick to Tunisia clipped into the box but cleared by Australia. The second balls all falling their way and with it more time in possession.      11.14am    52 mins: All the second balls seemed to land Australia\u2019s way in the opening half but Tunisia have evened the ledger since the break. The Socceroos are being drawn out of their shape and into some rash challenges. From one, a free-kick results and Ryan has to be out smartly off his line to punch clear. Tunisia continue to push for an equaliser and now they have some momentum in midfield the crowd is back in the game.      11.12am    50 mins: Superb chasing back from Leckie on the right to help out his fullback and earn a free-kick with Tunisia looking dangerous. Australia take advantage and on the counter McGree is canny to free Goodwin on the left and his cross is dangerous in the box but there\u2019s no navy shirt to put the chance away.   Updated at 11.16am GMT    11.11am    49 mins: Tunisia have had more luck with their balls into the channel this half and after prospering down the left they make a move down the right, winning a handy second ball. A corner results but after playing it short it comes to nought. Tunisia look more assured, more composed, and more threatening. Australia in response are showing signs of retreating, which is not what they want to be doing.      11.09am    47 mins: That substitution will see Tunisia switch from a back five to a flat four and shift an extra body into midfield where Australia dominated. The Eagles of Carthage start brightly and earn a corner on the left but Souttar stoops to head clear, only to land awkwardly and require treatment.      11.07am    Tunisia have made a change at the break with Dr\u00e4ger, who had taken a couple of knocks, and a booking, replaced by Ferjani Sassi.     11.06am    The players are out for the second half. Can Australia hold on?     11.04am         11.03am    This can\u2019t be good.      11.02am         10.58am    Andy asks: \u201cAs someone who is Red Green colourblind I\u2019m wondering why Australia aren\u2019t playing in their home colours. It\u2019s very obvious for me to see the difference and most people, I\u2019m sure, prefer to see the home colours.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty sure the policy is to schedule dark v light as much as possible, and with Tunisia the nominal home side and choosing white, Australia have to accommodate.      10.57am    Australia\u2019s spearhead really put himself about.      10.56am    \u201cHow Australia miss the crossing ability of Brett Emerton and Marco Bresciano,\u201d emails Dechlan Brennan. It really has been striking how poor the Socceroos have been from set-pieces so far this World Cup considering it\u2019s their clearest route to goal. They have the personnel in Mooy, Goodwin, and others, but they just haven\u2019t delivered. Even the goal, which I didn\u2019t report at the time, came from a very fortunate deflected cross.     10.54am    Australia were well organised and committed in that half, but there was little of any quality to shout about. Tunisia were very poor, seemingly expecting to turn up, throw their weight around, and capitalise on Australian errors. Jalel Kadri has his work cut out at the break to convince his team to get the ball down and play through the Socceroos.      10.51am   Half-time: Tunisia 0-1 Australia  The Socceroos head to the break with a deserved lead after a hard fought, physical opening half. It\u2019s not a spectacle of champagne football, but in tournament play it\u2019s not how, it\u2019s how many.     Updated at 10.52am GMT    10.49am    45 + 3 mins: Tunisia build pressure down the right but Rowles cuts out one cross, and Goodwin the next. Still Tunisia come and from the third crossing attempt Jebali does superbly to whip the ball to the corner of the six-yard box where Mskani rushes onto it but clips his first-time effort just wide of Ryan\u2019s near post.      10.47am    45 mins: Corner on the right to Australia, Goodwin takes it, an inswinger with his left, but Tunisia head clear and push out quickly enough to force Karacic to hurry the second ball out of play.     10.46am    44 mins: Finally a decent free-kick delivery for Australia. Deep from Goodwin, swinging in from right to left, and Duke gets his head to the ball first in the area but can\u2019t get much purchase on it. The Socceroos keep the ball alive though, winning challenge after challenge allowing Mooy to spark another attack that Bronn makes a hash of, allowing Karacic the chance to shoot straight at white shirt.      10.43am    42 mins: Australia clear the resulting corner, then Ryan does brilliantly to leap and claim the second ball from the head of Jebali. He\u2019s probably fortunate to receive a free-kick for his bravery after spilling the ball on crash-landing.      10.42am    40 mins: When play resumes Australia attack sharply through McGree and Goodwin but Leckie is just unable to latch onto the through-ball. Tunisia go down the other end and fashion their first clear opportunity of the match, but Souttar slides in magnificently to deny Dr\u00e4ger who thought he only had Ryan to beat.      10.40am    39 mins: A slight delay while Dr\u00e4ger is attended to. Presumably that means 20 minutes of added time.      10.39am    37 mins: Mooy plays around the corner like Paul Scholes to set up Leckie to turn and run at the Tunisian defence but he\u2019s robbed and Tunisia can counter. With Australia a fraction out of shape Msakni can drive towards the penalty area but his shot is blocked off the boot.      10.37am    35 mins: Tunisia continue to look out of ideas. They have no confidence playing short passes out of defence and whenever anything longer is attempted Australia\u2019s back four steps up and snuffs out any danger. Someone in a white shirt needs to take the game on.      10.35am    33 mins: Tunisia are committing repeat fouls, bundling over Australian players all over the park and leaving a foot in here or there on most challenges. From one of these free-kicks the Socceroos earn the first corner of the day on the right, but as is becoming a chronic problem, the delivery is poor and causes no danger despite Irvine\u2019s efforts.      10.33am    31 mins: Duke and Tunisia substitute Hannibal Mejbri exchange angry words, then a friendly handshake after the Australian wins a free-kick near the dugout.      10.33am    29 mins: Apart from that one transitional breakaway, Tunisia have offered nothing in attack. Australia are matching them for physicality, winning the majority of second balls and it\u2019s unsettled the Arab Cup finalists. The back four deserves special credit for pushing tight to their direct opponent, denying any easy passes into feet.      10.29am    27 mins: The goalscorer Duke slides in to make a defensive block and Australia\u2019s bench clears to applaud the endeavour. Australia have the bit between their teeth today.      10.27am    25 mins: Excellent goal. The first time all night either side have tried to play through the lines and it pays dividends.  Meanwhile, the combative A\u00efssa La\u00efdouni is in the book for flattening Goodwin.      10.25am   GOAL! Tunisia 0-1 Australia (Duke, 23)  This is not especially brave-in-possession modern football. Both teams looking for long diagonal outlets to safeguard territory and minimise risk. That is until Australia play out from the back, feeding Duke with his back to goal, his delightful touch allows the ball to be sprayed wide to Goodwin and finally a cross finds its target, and it\u2019s that man Duke again to arrive on time to glance a header into the far corner! Australia bag the opening goal two matches running!     Updated at 10.32am GMT    10.22am    21 mins: Tunisia finally look to have come to terms with the pace of the game. Australia concede a couple of turnovers inviting their opponents onto them, but Dr\u00e4ger blazes high and wide with time to make a better decision.      10.21am    19 mins: Tunisia are really struggling with Australia\u2019s mid-block press. Until they slip it with a couple of vertical passes between the lines but Msakni is crowded out inside the box when he looked set to wriggle into a shooting opportunity.      10.19am    17 mins: Lots of headers, lots of hurried clearances, lots of second balls. It\u2019s all very retro for this state-of-the-art tournament. Lots of players playing like they\u2019re in the shop window for League 1.      10.16am    15 mins: Behich steps up and plants his knee unnecessarily into the buttocks of Sliti to stymie a possible Australian counterattack. Duke soon picks a Tunisian pocket to set his side back on the front foot but Leckie\u2019s cross is blocked. There are collisions and bodies flying in from all angles. Lots of energy, not heaps of skill.      10.14am    13 mins: The first cross from the right from Kara\u010di\u0107 is more dangerous but Australia don\u2019t have a body on the penalty spot to pounce. The Socceroos are bossing this one so far.      10.12am    12 mins: Mooy finds Behich with a long crossfield pass. His backheel releases Goodwin but another disappointing cross is easy to clear. This has been the pattern early.      10.11am    11 mins: As against France, Australia are on their game early. Mooy nips in to intercept a move through the lines and the passes link into the final third but there\u2019s no ball into the box. Tunisia have yet to settle and their physicality is not impressing the German referee.      10.10am    9 mins: Still the play remains on Australia\u2019s attacking left flank but two further crosses fail to trouble the Tunisian defence. From the second of those Ali Abdi has space to gallop into on the counter but he loses control and Australia hack clear. Poor from the Tunisian.      10.08am    8 mins: Australia have enjoyed a decent couple of minutes and it\u2019s all been down the left with Goodwin, Mooy and Behich linking well. Again though, the cross is easily cleared.      10.07am    6 mins: As is customary, Aaron Mooy is Australia\u2019s most important player, showing composure in midfield with bodies flying in from all sides. Leckie feeds off the good work and withstands a robust challenge to release Goodwin but his cross is cleared. Mooy is then fouled as the second ball comes out, but his subsequent set-piece is easily headed clear.  This is going to be a tasty physical encounter. Australia need to improve their free-kicks and corners.      10.05am    5 mins: Misplaced passes aplenty in the early exchanges with Dr\u00e4ger then Souttar both guilty of coughing up possession in dangerous areas.     10.04am    3 mins: Most of the match so-far has seen the ball in dispute in midfield with both sides committing to the early physical challenges. It\u2019s all a bit frenetic with the atmosphere from the stands spilling down to pitch level.   Updated at 10.07am GMT    10.02am    2 mins: Australia kick-off and try to pass the ball around at the back but the noise of whistling and jeering is deafening, and soon the Socceroos give the ball away. Every Tunisian touch is then greeted with a cheer like the Eagles of Carthage are 6-0 up in injury time. Carnival atmosphere.     10.01am   Kick-off!  Will one of these unheralded sides take a giant step towards the round of 16 and heap pressure on Denmark? Let\u2019s find out\u2026     9.57am    The teams are out into the Qatari sunshine. The anthems are mumbled. Let\u2019s. Get. Down. To. Business.      9.49am    Tonight is the third match of the tournament to be held at the Al Janoub Stadium in Al Wakrah, just south of Doha CBD. It\u2019s already hosted France\u2019s 4-1 victory over Australia and Switzerland\u2019s 1-0 win over Cameroon.  Updated at 9.54am GMT    9.47am         9.46am    Tactics: I think the pattern of play will be determined by Arnold\u2019s ambition and how he asses the risk-reward throughout the match. The opening 20 minutes against France demonstrated the potential for a hardworking team performance to control the game with Aaron Mooy pulling the strings from midfield. But will that be enough to force a victory? And is it capable of lasting more than a half of a half in the sweltering conditions? For my two cents I reckon Australia need to lengthen the pitch, not condense it, and invite an open, transitional end-to-end affair. It would involve relinquishing control of possession but in my opinion maximise Australia\u2019s strengths, namely pace out wide, Mooy\u2019s long-range passing, and a top level shot-stopper in goal. Expect to win, done done done!      9.42am    \u201cEvening Jonathan,\u201d greetings Phil Withall. \u201cI\u2019m rather confused and conflicted by Graham Arnold. Obviously he can do a job, you don\u2019t get to manage a side at a world cup by chance, but his ability to confuse is rather baffling.  \u201cThere seems to be no consistency in the way he communicates, just a random collection of statements, I wonder if he has the same connection with the players? He always seems to be reactive rather than proactive. Maybe I\u2019m missing something but he doesn\u2019t seem to be the man Australia need at the moment and I don\u2019t see the Socceroos chances of advancing being that strong. Hope I\u2019m wrong.\u201d I will direct you to this piece of analysis from Emma Kemp.  Why were we so off-kilter when results did not meet our expectations in the present? Was it partly the cognitive dissonance of hearing him repeatedly telling us \u201cwe expect to win\u201d even when they did not do so? \u2026 Do we forgive that because we know he got them from a self-described \u201ccoach whisperer\u201d who tells his clients to study the \u201csubconscious mind\u201d?       9.37am    The referee tonight is German Daniel Siebert. He took charge of the 2021 Arab Cup final that Tunisia lost to Algeria 0-2 after extra time.      9.33am    Tunisia may have the upper hand already simply by the selection of kits. The North Africans will run out in their home kit of all-white with red trim, Australia are in their change uniform of dark blue with teal accents.  I tried to find a definitive Guardian link to demonstrate how lighter colours are more cooling in hot environments, but this is the best I could muster.      9.27am    Apropos of nothing in particular, Australia doesn\u2019t have an embassy in Tunisia, instead piggybacking on Canada\u2019s diplomatic presence, with the Australian High Commission in Malta on standby.     9.23am    As Emma Kemp reported, Tunisia\u2019s fans are visible and vocal in Qatar.       9.18am    Thanks to Emma Kemp in Doha there is lots of excellent Socceroo-related content to enjoy. Try these on for size.         9.14am    Clearly they should have gone for this, in full.       9.14am    Australia\u2019s choice is the ubiquitous Down Under by Men at Work. I just think it\u2019s a shame they didn\u2019t opt for one of theses versions.       9.13am    This is the song that will be played on the Al Janoub PA system should Tunisia score.      9.11am    In and around the surfeit of soccer I hope you\u2019ve all had time to enjoy the sounds of the World Cup in Qatar. It has proven a major distraction for me in the past few days thanks to these features.       9.06am    Graham Arnold has spoken to SBS TV in Australia. He began by answering what he hopes to improve on tonight.  To get rid of the technical mistakes. When you play against top opposition it is a game of millimetres. If you make a small mistake it turns into a big mistake. That is down to the quality of opposition. But overall, we focus more on what we did well. That was obviously the first 30 minutes. We have got to do that for 90. When you look at it, the first 30 minutes we did exceptionally well. 27, 28, whatever people want to say. But it was not through their good play that opened us up. If you look back at the game, their first real chance that they built up was in the 43rd minute. They put the ball over the crossbar. The other times it was our mistakes. Sloppy mistakes. It is about getting rid of them and we can control that. If we are sitting here today and saying we were completely outplayed, dominated, that is something maybe we cannot fix, but we made some mistakes and we have got to fix it.  He moved onto the mood in the camp after the France defeat?  We had an honest conversation, that is the most important thing. After we got back here, I grabbed the boys straightaway. Of course they were down because we build their belief up so high, we give them the belief that we are going to give this a shot, but the most important thing is honesty. Afterwards, I said, lads, put our hands up, are we better players? It was 100% honest, all the players know. Did you give me everything you have got? 100%, yes. OK, let\u2019s get on with it then.  Then there\u2019s an unexpected detour into Gordon Strachan territory.  The size of the players at the tournament has been something that is surprising. I\u2019m not saying surprising me, but it is probably surprising to a lot of other people. A player of Harry Souttar\u2019s size, we have only got one of them. The other nations have got six or seven. That is just through athleticism. But we have got to make sure that we keep them out of our penalty box more and we can deal with that.      8.59am    Conditions: The unremitting Middle Eastern sun penetrates the yonic aperture of Al Janoub Stadium casting shadows on the verdant oblong oasis. Hot innit. It might be winter in Qatar but it\u2019s still 30C just after midday and far from optimal conditions for a high-tempo football match.      8.56am   Australia XI  Surprisingly, just the one change to Australia\u2019s starting XI with Fran Kara\u010di\u0107 replacing Nathaniel Atkinson at right-back. Socceroos supporters will hope playmaker Ajdin Hrustic is fit enough to make a cameo off the bench.      8.49am   Tunisia XI  Just the one change from Jalel Kadri with Na\u00efm Sliti ling up in attack in place of Anis Ben Slimane.       8.44am    Emma Kemp sets the scene for us from Doha, where Tunisian fans are out in force.  Emma\u2019s report also contains some prematch troop-rousing from Arnold, with the Socceroos coach demanding his side is ready for a war.  Anytime an Australian reaches for such a word it is my responsibility to send you here:      8.30am   Preamble  Hello everybody and welcome to live coverage of Tunisia v Australia from Al Janoub Stadium in Al Wakrah. Kick-off in this group D clash is 1pm local time (9pm AEDT/10am GMT). Neutrals, I\u2019m not in the business of hoodwinking anyone, this is not a premium World Cup fixture. Between them, in their 33 matches on the game\u2019s greatest stage, these nations have won only four times. They each average less than a goal a game. This is the stale grissini at the start of a banquet. Mow the lawn. Play with your kids. Ring your mum. Knock up a massive batch of ragu and let it blib away on the stove all day so that when France v Denmark and Argentina v Mexico come around you can watch in comfort. Fans of Australia and Tunisia, THIS IS THE BIG ONE! You may never get a better opportunity on the game\u2019s greatest stage! A win tonight puts you tantalisingly close to the knockout phase! What a time to be alive!?  Tunisia will begin the more optimistic of the pair. The Eagles of Carthage held their own against Denmark a few days ago and arrived in Qatar with recent victories over Iran, Chile, and Japan. They are also one of the best supported sides at the tournament with many locals and neutrals getting behind an Arab contender.  Australia did not enter the World Cup with grand ambitions and those expectations were not revised upwards after a chastening defeat to France. Simply, this is a limited squad, and it showed against such formidable opposition. But Australia\u2019s World Cup campaign was always going to come down to this contest. If they avoid defeat to a nation ranked only eight places above them on FIFA\u2019s rankings their tournament remains a going concern heading into a do-or-die clash with Denmark. A win today turns that fixture into a belter.  Graham Arnold has told his troops to treat the France defeat like a friendly and consider their group phase a two-match affair. Changes to his starting XI are expected, especially at right fullback, with Nathaniel Atkinson set to be replaced after Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 cremated the Tasmanian\u2019s joie de vivre. \u201cIt\u2019s a great lesson for the kid, he\u2019ll move on from it,\u201d deadpanned Arnold afterwards. There\u2019s bags of time before kick-off so feel free to send me an email, or, if you haven\u2019t yet abandoned the platform as it prepares to let slip the trolls of war, tweet me @JPHowcroft.  "

                    "body": "Alexis Mac Allister, Argentina Brighton are in a good position, having extended Alexis Mac Allister\u2019s contract until 2025 before the World Cup started, but clubs in the Champions League will come knocking. Mac Allister was essential to Argentina\u2019s success at the World Cup, playing in all six of the games they won, scoring the opening goal against Poland and setting up \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda to score a sensational breakaway goal in the final. But it was his hard work in midfield that really stood out. He made nine tackles, three interceptions and blocked more passes than any other player (12). In addition, he completed 89% of his passes, showing the all-round nature of his performances. Brighton signed Mac Allister for \u00a37m in 2019. If they choose to sell him, they will get a lot more than that. Sofyan Amrabat, Morocco Morocco\u2019s run to the semi-finals was not glamorous, but it was effective. Discipline and effort were key to the way Walid Regragui played, and no player embodied those values more than Fiorentina\u2019s defensive midfielder Sofyan Amrabat. He was linked with a move to Tottenham last year and would solidify any number of teams. Only three other players, one being his compatriot Achraf Hakimi, made more tackles than his total of 16 at the World Cup. His tireless efforts on and off the ball made Morocco tick and ensured they only conceded five goals in the entire tournament. Azzedine Ounahi, Morocco It is nigh-on impossible to get close to Azzedine Ounahi. He was only dribbled past twice during the World Cup and he was dispossessed just seven times, underling how good he is at holding on to the ball. He is also brilliant with the ball at his feet, driving his team up the field and creating opportunities for counterattacks. The 22-year-old, who is currently at French side Angers, is in line for a big move. Andries Noppert, Netherlands  At 28, Andries Noppert still has time to secure a high-profile move, which looked extremely unlikely two years ago. He was playing in the Dutch second tier and was contemplating a career switch, but an injury crisis at Go Ahead Eagles meant he was finally given an opportunity. Noppert grabbed his chance and earned a move to Heerenveen and a call-up to the Netherlands squad. The big keeper, who stands at 6ft 8in, won his first cap at the World Cup to complete a remarkable journey. He made 18 saves and kept two clean sheets in his five appearances at the tournament. Dominik Livakovic, Croatia It was no surprise Emiliano Mart\u00ednez won the Golden Glove given the number of important saves he produced in games and penalty shootouts. However, it would have made just as much sense to give the accolade to Dominik Livakovic. The Croatia keeper was immense, making more saves (24) than any other keeper at the tournament \u2013 including 11 against Brazil, the most by a goalkeeper in a single game. He also saved four penalties to help maintain his country\u2019s 100% record in shootouts. Tournaments are perfect opportunities for goalkeepers to showcase their talent and, if any club is looking for a serial shotstopper, then Livakovic \u2013 whose save success rate was an impressive 80.6% \u2013 is their man. Mehdi Taremi, Iran Mehdi Taremi turned 30 in July, but he is a late bloomer. The Iran striker was picked up by Portuguese club Rio Ave three years ago and he quickly impressed, scoring 21 goals in 37 games to earn a move to Porto. He has continued to sparkle there, adding another 63 goals in 117 appearances, and he used the World Cup to thrust himself into the spotlight. His reputation has soared given his fine performances in the group stage in Qatar, where he scored twice, registered one assist and made nine key passes \u2013 a sum that only eight players could better in the entire tournament. Chelsea fans may also remember Taremi for the spectacular bicycle-kick that won the Champions League goal of the season award in 2020-21. Age is not on his side, but Taremi has the talent for one more big move.  Randal Kolo Muani Randal Kolo Muani only played 181 minutes at the World Cup but the fact he was included in the France squad after Christopher Nkunku\u2019s injury demonstrates the talent he possesses. That he scored the third quickest goal by a substitute in World Cup history, and won a penalty in the final, isn\u2019t bad either. Interested parties should also look at his impact for Eintracht Frankfurt this season: in 14 league appearances, he has scored five goals and registered more assists (nine) than any other player in the Bundesliga. Gon\u00e7alo Ramos Replacing one of the best players in the history of the game while making your first start for your country, at a World Cup no less, would be a daunting task for most footballers, but not Gon\u00e7alo Ramos. The 21-year-old took Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s place for Portugal in their last-16 tie against Switzerland and grabbed the opportunity with both hands, scoring three in the space of 50 minutes \u2013 the youngest player to score a hat-trick at a World Cup since 1962. It was not a one-off. Ramos has scored nine goals in 11 league games for Benfica this season. He has plenty of time to develop and his next move could be crucial for his career.  Sergi\u00f1o Dest Sergi\u00f1o Dest has found first-team football hard to come by recently, making just five appearances for Milan in Serie A this season. The 21-year-old had a better experience at the World Cup, helping USA reach the last 16 and showcasing his effectiveness as a full-back. Dest is an attacking, energetic right-back. He had more successful dribbles than any of his teammates and only one USA player took more shots. He can look shaky when defending, but a top coach would develop that part of his game. Mohammed Kudus Mohammed Kudus\u2019s quality has been well known for a while, with Everton rumoured to be close to a deal for him in the summer. The move fell through but he has continued to shine at Ajax, with four goals and two assists in the Champions League this season. The World Cup gave Kudus a springboard to showcase his talent to a wider audience and, even though Ghana crashed out in the group stage, he still stood out. He was a constant threat to opponents and he scored twice in three games. \u2022 This is an article by WhoScored\u2022 Follow WhoScored on Twitter and Facebook\u2022 Follow Ciaran McLoughlin on Twitter"

                    "body": "George Cohen, who has died aged 83, won just one major honour during a career as one of England\u2019s best-ever defenders \u2013 but it was a 1966 World Cup winners\u2019 medal, and he was more than satisfied with his return. That he came away with nothing more than that can be attributed to the fact that he spent his 14 playing years at Fulham, where winning trophies was hardly a habit, and because a serious knee injury put an end to his playing days at the age of only 29, when he was at the peak of his game. While it lasted, however, Cohen\u2019s footballing career deserved admiration. At right-back for England he was, with Ray Wilson, part of the greatest full-back pairing his country had ever produced, winning 37 caps before injury cut him adrift. A sound tackler who was exceptionally quick and had great stamina, he was just what England\u2019s \u201cwingless wonders\u201d under Alf Ramsey needed most \u2013 a defender who could break with speed upfield and create openings for the forwards with crosses from the flanks. This he did to great effect throughout the 1966 World Cup finals, where he was an ever-present for England, playing in every minute of every game in the tournament and performing immaculately throughout, with unwavering concentration.  Cohen was born in Kensington, west London, and brought up in Fulham, where his Irish-born mother, Catherine (nee Gibbs), was a stores manager at the local Lots Road power station and his father, Louis (known as Harry) Cohen, was a gas fitter. Though of Jewish heritage on his father\u2019s side, with some of his family originally from Ukraine, Cohen never regarded himself as a member of the faith.  George\u2019s mother, a strong woman, was the greatest influence on his life, and it was she who backed his desire to become a professional footballer straight from school \u2013 while his father argued that he should learn a trade before even entertaining the idea. From an early age George had stood out as being quicker and stronger than many other children \u2013 something he partly put down to his ability to drink boiled cabbage water \u2013 often the only fare his hard-up parents could afford \u2013 \u201cwithout gagging\u201d. A good boxer, he maintained a strong interest in the fight game throughout his life, but his footballing talent was spotted at Fulham Central school by the former Fulham player Ernie Shepherd. With his mother\u2019s backing, George took up an offer to join the club\u2019s ground staff. Cohen made his first team debut in 1957 as a 17-year-old in a characterful Second Division side that also included Johnny Haynes and Jimmy Hill. Cohen\u2019s pace, admirable physique and attacking intent made a mark from the very start, and he quickly became one of the most popular footballers of his era, helping his side, in 1959, gain promotion to the First Division, where they remained for all but the very end of his career. Full-backs in those days were expected to be hard-tackling and robust rather than swift and tricky, so he was helping to break the mould. \u201cMy game depended on great fitness more than most,\u201d he once said. \u201cIt was so much part of my technique that it was the most valuable tool of my trade.\u201d In due course Cohen\u2019s adventurous outlook at Fulham caught the eye of Ramsey, and he was given his England debut against Uruguay in 1964, ousting Jimmy Armfield from his long-held right-back spot. Ramsey, who was a right-back too in his playing days, saw eye-to-eye with Cohen from the off, and their relationship even survived an unfortunate incident early on in his England career when, unaware that Ramsey had taken an impromptu decision to join in a training ground five-a-side match, Cohen turned blind into a tackle and sent his manager up into the air, watching in horror as he fell to the frosty ground and landed on his head. Ramsey eventually creaked back to an upright position and, fixing a withering glare at Cohen, said: \u201cGeorge, if I had another fucking full-back you wouldn\u2019t be playing tomorrow.\u201d Fortunately Ramsey was more focused on Cohen\u2019s fitness and speed than his tackling, especially because neither of his two centre-halves, Jack Charlton and Bobby Moore, were blessed with great pace. Wilson, Cohen\u2019s fellow full-back, was also quick, and the pair would push up the field to provide an element of width whenever they could. They were both low-key, undemonstrative players \u2013 Cohen was especially quiet both on and off the pitch \u2013 but their contribution throughout the 1966 finals was especially appreciated by their fellow players and the English public. Cohen was cheerful and friendly, but a quiet man who had his own way of doing things. \u201cNobody was more willing or dedicated than George,\u201d said Moore, his England captain. \u201cAny job he was given he would do without complication or complaint.\u201d But while he was an admirable team man he was never \u201cone of the lads\u201d and largely liked to entertain himself. On one England trip to Canada he was seen so little by the other players outside matches that speculation about his whereabouts became a running joke. It turned out that he was merely spending most of his time in his hotel room reading books and keeping out of the hot sun. He was an avid reader, always with a paperback in his hand, especially when travelling. What came after the World Cup win was sorely disappointing. In December 1967, playing for Fulham against Liverpool, Cohen twisted his knee badly and was taken from the field in agony. A year of remedial work followed the removal of his cartilage, but after struggling through a few comeback games he was told his knee was wrecked and that he could never play again. \u201cI was particularly angry because I was moving into my prime as a footballer,\u201d he said. \u201cThe World Cup had given me great confidence \u2026 and I was at the top of my business.\u201d In all he had played 408 league matches during 14 years for his club. For a year Cohen took charge of Fulham\u2019s youth team, but then made a decisive break with football by joining a firm of London architects, where he learned technical drawing and planning law. He formed his own property development company, George R Cohen Properties, and for a time the business went well. However, a speculative deal to develop a plot of land in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, failed, and he lost all his capital. The business later made a partial recovery, but things were never so good again, and in 1998 he put his World Cup winners\u2019 medal up for sale. When the reserve price at auction was not reached, the then Fulham chairman, Mohamed Al Fayed, bought the medal off Cohen for an undisclosed sum and kept it at the club. Fulham also employed him as a host for a number of years at home games. Cohen\u2019s difficulties in business were not his only misfortunes. In 1971 his 62-year-old mother died after being run over by a juggernaut. Five years later he was diagnosed with bowel cancer, and his treatment lasted for 14 years. In 2000, the year he was made MBE, his younger brother, Peter, died after being attacked in the foyer of a Northampton nightclub, leaving Cohen in \u201ca permanent state of rage\u201d for a long time afterwards.  In 1962 he married Daphne Church. She and their sons, Andrew and Anthony, survive him. \u2022 George Reginald Cohen, footballer, born 22 October 1939; died 23 December 2022"

                    "body": "Ashleigh Gardner picked up a career-best, player-of-the-match 5-15 against New Zealand after making just three with the bat during the group-stage fixture of the ongoing T20 World Cup.  Georgia Wareham hadn\u2019t played any international cricket in nearly 16 months but dealt Bangladesh a body blow with her match-winning 3-20 upon slotting back into Australia\u2019s XI.  Alyssa Healy had been on the sidelines with a weeks-long calf injury but struck vital fifties in two of her first three innings after returning to the line-up.  Grace Harris\u2019s tone-setting 3-0-7-2 \u2013 her best T20I figures \u2013 against Sri Lanka was only the second instance she had bowled for Australia since coming back into the side a year ago after a six-year hiatus. Tahlia McGrath hadn\u2019t considered herself any more than a \u201cspecialist fielder\u201d through the best part of the tour until her decisive 33-ball 57 against South Africa sealed Australia\u2019s semi-finals berth. To understand Australia\u2019s enviable depth, one has to understand these numbers as much as the context out of which they are born. Few teams across cricket can rival the vastness of the title favourites\u2019 playing resources and fewer can find match-winners in the way the defending champions have. As they gear up to take on India in the semi-final at Newlands on Thursday, the quality of their XI, as much as that of the reserves, explains why depth remains the most potent weapon in Australia\u2019s arsenal.  \u201cThat\u2019s absolutely our biggest strength \u2013 that we\u2019ve got so many options,\u201d McGrath, the player of the match in Australia\u2019s fourth and final group-stage fixture, said. \u201cSo many players can play different roles and it seems to be someone different sticks their hand up every time. We\u2019re all in really good form at the moment with the bat, with the ball, so we go into those semi-finals full of confidence.\u201d  That the five-time winners have found a new hero in almost every game of the 10-team competition so far is down to the \u2018D\u2019 word. They have copped challenges varied, but dug deep to muster an appropriate, winning response every single time. Be it the pitches \u2013 relatively slower by South African standards \u2013 the dearth of penetration in patches with both bat and ball during their unbeaten groups-stage run, or vice-captain Healy\u2019s unavailability for the last group fixture through soreness in the left quad, Australia have shown how well prepared their XV is to counter adversity of any kind. \u201cI think that\u2019s just a combination of a number of things,\u201d Beth Mooney said. \u201cObviously, [there has been] a huge amount of investment from Cricket Australia over the last few years to get our domestic competition to the level that it is at the moment and also having people coming in and out of the Australian squad at any moment who can play a game and win a game for us. \u201cI guess that comes down to the culture that\u2019s been created, too. We\u2019ve got an environment here where the coaching staff, support staff and the players \u2013 we all thrive off each other\u2019s belief and that means that anyone can go out there and contribute, be successful whether they come from the bench or outside the squad or anything like that.  \u201cSo, I guess it\u2019s a bit of fortune but certainly a huge amount of investment not just into the game back home, but obviously into the culture and the environment here.\u201d  No player in the public eye has fed more off this environment in the past year than their feted allrounder, Ellyse Perry. Dropped from the T20I side during the Ashes at the start of 2022 and then having sat out the entire Birmingham Commonwealth Games, where Australia clinched gold, Perry has since emerged as much a beneficiary of the team\u2019s flexible culture as a benefactor to their depth. Memorably, the 32-year-old\u2019s T20I career found a second wind during Australia\u2019s victorious five-T20I India tour in December. She finished second only to Mooney on the series\u2019 run chart, averaging 82.50 for her 165 runs, and has been a key all-round contributor in Australia\u2019s World Cup campaign so far in South Africa. \u201cPez has done just Pez in the last few months,\u201d Mooney said. \u201cShe\u2019s obviously has evolved her game pretty significantly in the T20 format, and takes the game on a little bit earlier I\u2019d say than she has done in the past. Obviously we had a couple of players missing in India and she got her opportunity back in the middle order there, and she absolutely took it with both hands.  \u201cShe probably would have had to wait a little bit of time in that she wasn\u2019t expecting that opportunity, but when she did, she absolutely batted the house down and we\u2019ve known for a long time that\u2019s what she\u2019s capable of. So it\u2019s really nice to see that she\u2019s been able to put that out in the park and win games for Australia with that style of play.\u201d  With their well-rounded line-up, Australia stand head and shoulders above India, whose out-of-form high-profile batters in captain Harmanpreet Kaur and opener Shafali Verma are only one of the many concerns facing them ahead of what is a rematch of the 2020 T20 World Cup and the Commonwealth Games gold-medal deciders. Mooney, however, expects the face-off to be \u201ca huge contest\u201d given \u201cthey have pushed us significantly in the last few years and got a bunch of match-winners in their line-up\u201d.  But if this World Cup has established anything beyond doubt, it is that Australia\u2019s battled-hardened army of impact players far outnumber those in any other team. For all the anticipation of a closely fought semi-final, Australia\u2019s inimitable depth might prove way too good for India\u2019s dreams."

                    "body": "Football pundits Harry Redknapp, Peter Crouch and Robbie Keane are helping to promote betting on World Cup matches despite stricter rules on celebrity gambling endorsements to protect young people. Fifa officials estimate the last World Cup generated \u00a3120bn in betting turnover. Gambling companies hope for a similar betting spree for this year\u2019s tournament, despite a ban on gambling in Qatar. Redknapp, the former West Ham and Spurs manager, who won the television show I\u2019m a Celebrity \u2026Get Me Out of Here! in 2018, is promoting BetVictor\u2019s World Cup coverage with an advertising campaign and expert commentary on the brand\u2019s website. Former England striker Crouch is a brand ambassador for gambling firm Paddy Power, appearing in advertising for the tournament. He also features on a Paddy Power-backed \u201calbum\u201d, the seven-minute long Crouchy Conducts the Classics, with profits donated to the charity Stonewall. It was announced last month that Keane, the former Tottenham player and Republic of Ireland international, had become a brand ambassador for Betway. He will provide expert opinion for the World Cup. New rules came into force on 1 October in the UK to stop celebrities with a \u201cstrong appeal\u201d to young people promoting gambling. The Advertising Standards Authority, the independent regulator, said the new rules would \u201csignificantly\u201d affect gambling advertisers using celebrities and prominent sportspeople. The ban covers footballers at top clubs, but the guidelines say former players or managers are less likely to appeal to young people. The guidance says \u201cretired footballers who have moved into punditry/commentary will be assessed on the basis of their social and other media profile\u201d. Tom Fleming, a spokesperson for the charity Gambling with Lives, which supports families bereaved by gambling-related suicide, claimed the use of celebrities to promote gambling during the World Cup was against the spirit of the new rules. He said: \u201cThe barrage of gambling advertising around the World Cup will lead to many people\u2019s addiction. No one, let alone ex-footballers, should be promoting highly addictive products, which is why the government must end all gambling advertising and marketing.\u201d Ministers said in December 2020 they were reviewing gambling laws, which would include advertising and football sponsorship. The white paper has been delayed four times, but is expected shortly. The Association of Directors of Public Health (ADPH) said it was concerned the promotion of gambling during the World Cup would \u201chelp to normalise gambling\u201d and \u201ccause a spike in the numbers of people experiencing gambling-related harm\u201d. Greg Fell, vice-president of the ADPH, said: \u201cWe know that using celebrities is likely to increase interest from children and young people. It is critical that the government acts to regulate marketing and promotion in the interests of public health.\u201d Research published last week by the charity GambleAware found six out of 10 football fans thought there were too many gambling ads during international football tournaments. It has launched a campaign, backed by the Football Supporters\u2019 Association, to help protect fans. In addition to advertising and marketing in the UK, there is a drive by global betting brands to maximise revenues in international markets. It was announced last week that recently sacked Aston Villa manager and former Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard would be a brand ambassador for M88 Mansion for the World Cup tournament, focusing on the Asian market.  The Betting and Gaming Council, which promotes the betting and gaming industry, said: \u201cThe regulated betting and gaming industry provides some of the country\u2019s most popular sport with vital funding.\u201d The council said the industry voluntarily agreed in 2019 to a \u201cwhistle to whistle\u201d ban on TV ads during sporting events before the 9pm watershed, starting five minutes before the event began and ending five minutes after it finished. Flutter, which operates the Paddy Power brand, said: \u201cWe work very hard to ensure we comply with all applicable regulations around the use of celebrities, and we firmly believe we lead the way on safer gambling. We hope the country can enjoy our advert in the spirit it is intended.\u201d BetVictor said its campaign complied with all relevant regulations."

                    "body": "For better and very much for worse, 2022 has been an apogee for sportswashing. The year began with the Winter Olympics in Beijing, as the International Olympic Committee insisted on its position of \u201cpolitical neutrality\u201d about crimes against humanity faced by Uyghur people. The war in Ukraine then forced the IOC and Fifa to backflip, all-but conceding \u2013 many years too late \u2013 that allowing Russia to host the 2014 Winter Olympics and 2018 World Cup was ill-advised. In the subsequent months, any lessons to be learnt from the Russian experience have been promptly forgotten by the global sporting elite. The International Cricket Council sold its soul to Aramco, the Saudi oil giant controlled by a brutal regime renowned for dismembering dissidents with bone-saws. There\u2019s also the small matter of Aramco single-handedly causing 4% of global greenhouse emissions in recent decades.  Formula One continues to curry favour with repressive regimes, including the Azeris (crushing dissent at home and committing war crimes in Nagorno-Karabakh) and the very same Saudis (who are also enjoying their first year as owners of an English Premier League team). The global body for cycling even blacklisted a journalist for asking tough questions about the sport\u2019s links to the repressive Turkmen regime and Russian oligarchs. And all of this as we hurtle towards the world cup of sportswashing: literally, the men\u2019s Fifa World Cup in Qatar, an autocratic state with few civil liberties, where LGBTQI+ relationships can lead to imprisonment and which has overseen the deaths of at least 6,500 migrant workers in the frenetic construction activity leading up to the tournament. Against the gloomy backdrop, the recent athlete and fan-led resistance to homegrown sportswashing has offered a ray of light. Is this finally a reckoning for those who, in the words of former Wallabies captain Senator David Pocock, \u201cuse the teams we love to advertise and buy social license\u201d? Certainly, developments of the past week \u2013 in netball, cricket and the AFL \u2013 are a promising start. They build on years of hard work by Australian athletes, player unions and activists, with Pocock and his wife Emma (co-founder of FrontRunners), at the forefront. They show the promise of the moment; growing community recognition that fossil fuel sponsorship is as reprehensible as tobacco sponsorship and should likewise be banned. Greater awareness, too, of the underlying premise of sportswashing \u2013 cash for social licence \u2013 and an appreciation that we can do better. This is a wave that is surely only beginning, particularly in the climate space. It seems inevitable that Santos\u2019s sponsorship of the Wallabies and the Tour Down Under, Woodside\u2019s sponsorship of the Fremantle Dockers and Adani\u2019s commercial ties with the North Queensland Cowboys are in their dying days. Activism empowers activism, success begets success. As some athletes and sports have successes in fighting back against the sportswashers, the movement will generate its own self-sustaining momentum.  It won\u2019t be long until state governments are drawn in; there is already a push for bans on fossil fuel advertising in stadiums (the Greens have introduced a bill in NSW). How attractive will Woodside\u2019s sponsorship deal look if the logo is covered up every time Fremantle play in Sydney? But it would be premature to celebrate just yet, especially with the World Cup \u2013 the sportswashing pinnacle \u2013 so imminent. It is understood that the Socceroos will make a public statement on human rights in Qatar ahead of the World Cup; otherwise, Football Australia has been conspicuously quiet. The stand taken by Australia\u2019s netballers is an instructive example of both hope and reality in the battle against sportswashing right now. Gina Rinehart is the richest person in Australia, one of our most influential global warming deniers and a supporter of climate-wrecking government inaction. She has also, individually and through her companies, heavily funded swimming, volleyball, rowing and artistic swimming for years, to great effect. Veteran swimmer Cate Campbell said during last year\u2019s Tokyo Olympics that Rinehart had \u201csaved swimming\u201d by way of her financial contributions to the sport. In 2022 Hancock Prospecting has stepped up its contributions, perhaps with an eye to growing community dissatisfaction with climate change deniers and the opportunity window presented by the home 2032 Olympics in Brisbane. In January, Hancock , became a major sponsor of the Australian Olympic Team. The company recently extended this largesse to netball, a sport facing financial oblivion, with a multi-million dollar deal. Current and former Diamonds players objected to the deal, noting Rinehart\u2019s views on climate change and past comments about Indigenous Australians by her late father, Lang Hancock, who founded the family business.   The Diamonds played in uniforms without the Hancock logo in a recent series but the deal remains on foot and Netball Australia has tried to quieten the dispute. An objection to the sponsorship by an Indigenous player, Noongar woman Donnell Wallam, was described on Tuesday by the governing body and captain Liz Watson as \u201ccultural sensitivities.\u201d Because objecting to wearing the logo of a company founded by someone who called for forced sterilisation of Australia\u2019s first people is clearly no more than a cultural sensitivity. Sport can be a potent tool for positive social change. It can also be hijacked by companies and brutal authoritarian regimes who want to use its emotional power to enhance their reputations. The resistance to sportswashing in Australia in recent weeks has been encouraging. But there is much work to be done to get the likes of Santos, Woodside and Hancock Prospecting out of Australian sport."

He had been tight-lipped when asked in the lead-up to the tournament whether he could discuss a fresh deal then. \nGuardiola, who will receive a rise on his reported \u00a320m-a-year salary, has led City to four Premier League titles, one FA Cup, four League Cups and one Champions League final, which was lost to Chelsea in May last year.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say thank you enough to everyone at the club for trusting me. I am happy and comfortable, and I have everything I need to do my job as best as possible,\u201d said Guardiola. \u201cI know the next chapter of this club will be amazing for the next decade. It happened over the last 10 years, and it will happen in the next 10 years because this club is so stable.\n\u201cFrom day one I felt something special being here. I cannot be in a better place. I still have the feeling there is more we can achieve together and that is why I want to stay and continue fighting for trophies.\u201d\nGuardiola\u2019s renewed commitment is a sizeable fillip to the club as they continue the process of renewing the squad and adding fresh competition. Kevin De Bruyne will be 32 in June and although Guardiola said this season there was no sign that his number-one midfielder\u2019s powers were waning, he accepts replacing the Belgian will be hard.\nOne candidate is Borussia Dortmund\u2019s Jude Bellingham, who is 19 and impressed in England\u2019s 6-2 win over Iran in their opening group match at the World Cup on Monday. Guardiola is an admirer. \u201cThe quality and skills, everyone knows about it, but it\u2019s not just about that,\u201d he has said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the whole package. He\u2019s really good. He\u2019s already in the national team playing with them at 19. That\u2019s quite impressive. When he was [as young as] 17, it wasn\u2019t just the quality, it was about he was shouting, leading, kicking, and going to the referee.\u201d\nSpeaking about Guardiola\u2019s new deal, City chairman, Khaldoon Al Mubarak, said: \u201cI am delighted that Pep\u2019s journey with Manchester City Football Club will continue. He has already contributed so much to the success and fabric of this organisation, and it\u2019s exciting to think what might be possible given the energy, hunger and ambition that he clearly still has.\n\u201cUnder his very special leadership our first team has accomplished so much, whilst continuously playing, and constantly evolving, a City style of football that is admired the world over. Like every City fan, I am looking forward to what lies ahead.\u201d"

                    "body": "On this underwhelming evidence Saudi Arabia must feel quietly confident about their chances of winning a now thoroughly intriguing, expectation-confounding, Group C. Mexico and Poland arrived at this most futuristic arena on the edge of the Arabian Sea after Argentina had been beaten by the Saudis. Poland, in particular, played much of the match as if still in shock.\nAlthough Mexico were largely the better side, they struggled to conjure clear openings. Indeed, they had what is destined to be remembered as one of the great World Cup saves by their 37-year-old goalkeeper, Guillermo Ochoa, to thank for earning them a point when he kept out Robert Lewandowski\u2019s second-half penalty.\nIn deceiving Poland\u2019s captain courtesy of a magnificent dummy before scrambling clear a ball heading low for the bottom corner, Ochoa earned Mexico a deserved point. It left the record scorer looking mortified. Poland\u2019s talisman is still to score at a World Cup finals and the team\u2019s chances of progressing to the knockout stages for the first time in 36 years have receded appreciably after a trying evening at a ground constructed using a colourful tapestry of 974 interlocking shipping containers. Perhaps not coincidentally, that trio of numerals forms the international dialling code for Qatar.\n\nFrom the outside a structure situated in Doha\u2019s port area and scheduled to be repurposed for community use is an edgy, arresting piece of architecture and inside it was hugely atmospheric. Mexico is 9,000 miles from Qatar but 974 was a sea of green with most of the noise generated by their fans. Poland must have felt they were playing away.\nGerardo Martino, Argentinian coach, has claimed he is \u201cpublic enemy No 1\u201d in his adopted country after some slightly iffy results of late but Mexico took much of the game to their opponents. With Poland sitting extremely deep chances were rare.\nA decent one did not arrive until virtually the half-hour mark when H\u00e9ctor Herrera crossed and Alexis Vega out-leapt Aston Villa\u2019s Matty Cash \u2013 who, despite being born in Slough, has a Polish grandparent \u2013 at the far post. From about six yards Vega, a strong man-of-the-match candidate, sent his header bouncing wide.\nWith the Napoli winger Hirving Lozano fazing Bartosz Bereszynski, Czeslaw Michniewicz, Poland\u2019s head coach, had much to ponder and must have been relieved to see his goalkeeper, Wojciech Szczesny, deny Jes\u00fas Gallardo.\nOf equal concern was Lewandowski\u2019s peripheral role. He completed an uncharacteristically low number of passes and in the first half he touched the ball inside Mexico\u2019s area once.\nHis room for manoeuvre proved severely restricted as he and his side struggled to conjure chances, let alone direct them on target.\nIt did not help his cause that his teammates retreated so deep, starving him of the service he needs to sprinkle his customary magic over proceedings. If Poland had felt brave enough to press a little higher up the pitch it might have been different.\n\nAs Lewandowski failed to impress, Henry Mart\u00edn, Mexico\u2019s central striker also exerted limited influence \u2013 even if he did see a dangerous glancing second-half header well saved by Szczesny \u2013 with the principal Mexico threat delivered down the flanks.\nMart\u00edn\u2019s lack of impact threatened to cost them dear when, early in the second half, H\u00e9ctor Moreno tugged Lewandowski\u2019s shirt during a tussle in the area and, after a VAR review, conceded a penalty and collected a yellow card.\nThe striker placed the ball on the spot and took a couple of deep breaths. His run-up looked a little nervous but, even though the kick was not his best, he still aimed, accurately, for the bottom corner, out of the reach of most goalkeepers.\nTo the crowd\u2019s considerable delight Ochoa proved equal to the challenge. After deceiving Lewandowski by feinting to dive to the right, he acrobatically changed course in mid-air and, throwing himself to the left, the keeper succeeded in extending a hand to palm the ball clear.\n\n\u201cI worked on that [the feint] for one month with the goalkeeping coach,\u201d he said.\n\u201cRobert is very emotional in the dressing room,\u201d said Michniewicz. \u201cHe needs time to digest what happened but we\u2019ll help him and I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll help us against Argentina and the sensational Saudi Arabia.\u201d\nAnd to think Ochoa, a veteran of five World Cups, was rejected by Fulham 12 years ago after a trial when Roy Hodgson was in charge."

                    "body": "How to control the narrative, how to cool the air, to reverse the fevered expectation of an early tournament romp? Well, that was certainly one way.\nWho knows, perhaps there was an element of masterful long-game vibes-chess about England\u2019s performance against the USA in the gleaming shell that is Al Bayt stadium.\nThere were boos at the end \u2013 rolling boos, impressively engaged boos \u2013 as Gareth Southgate offered a furrowed, headmasterly wave.\n\n\u201cI thought that was a really, really good match and both teams played really well,\u201d the manically over-excited stadium announcer declared over the ear-splitting PA.\nBut, the manically over-excited stadium announcer was wrong.\nIn reality this was 70 minutes of cold footballing custard, jetlag-ball, football played by a man struggling to escape from his sleeping bag. This was a Satanic Derby that saw only one team, Gregg Berhalter\u2019s perky USA, produce any real sense of rhythm and thrust.\nAt times in the first half, as England ambled vaguely, it felt like we were watching a kind of performance protest, an England team standing bravely against the basic idea of this World Cup as an entertainment product.\n\nMaybe, that first half seemed to say, it is simply wrong to enjoy yourself, to play with any joy or freedom in these lighted mausoleums. This was one angle England had covered.\nAt the end of which, well, what exactly? England are also top of the group and all-but through to the last-16.\nEngland have never won all three group games at a tournament where they ended up progressing to a decent outcome. It rarely happens for anyone.\nThe message, after a night of stale televised product, should be: don\u2019t panic. Southgate has been around long enough to have acquired entrenched opponents, observers who just seem bored of this, who crave something different.\nIt has, after all, been six years. But he has also been good enough to merit a little trust, a little more in the way of respect and good grace.\nThe debate about England, the debate about Southgate, which is really a debate about the confusions, the solipsisms, the deep feelings of being English, will of course rage on. The reality is England are pretty good, but not the best. Good enough, if they find their rhythm to edge though right to the end.\n\nSome say the confusion is fuelled by that fond old fever dream of English exceptionalism, the idea because England are now good England must, as of right, be the best, be English-good, which is the best good there is; that only inequity and folly prevents the natural state of things, unmanacled English supremacy. Take the handbrake off. Unleash Albion. Take back control. It rarely, if ever, works like this.\nThe fact is England have been stodgy for a while. Iran is now their only win in eight games. The sense of entropy in the summer was dismissed as fatigue. Perhaps it has more to do with the end of something, players ageing together, the balance of the team not right where Southgate has tried to refresh.\nCertainly something seemed to spook them here. Al Bayt is built in the shape of a Bedouin tent. A vast, pointless, oddly haunted Bedouin tent, an expression, above all, of Pharaonic-scale vanity, sport as despot theatre.\n\nBut it does certainly look like a tent. And a tent designed by Albert Speer, no less. This is not a misprint. It was the firm of Albert Speer Jr, son of the architect of the Third Reich, that just seemed like the best fit to the Supreme Delivery Committee, the best vibe, the best shout.\nPresumably Albert Speer III is being lined up for Saudi\u2019s 2030 gig.\nThere was the now-familiar pre-match show, with a giant exploding World Cup trophy, and a sense of forced and cajoling gaiety, right down to the shots of David Beckham, despots\u2019 glove-puppet, beaming handsomely in whatever VIP box he now occupies. \u201cQatar Energy\u201d read the scrolling advert boards at the perimeter. This was Big Qatar Energy.\nAfter which, nothing much happened.\nHarry Kane should have scored after nice work from Bukayo Saka. The move was made by Jude Bellingham, driving on into a cute half-forward position. This is the new gear England are searching for, but they also lose something with that extra juice from midfield. Southgate likes control. Football is control. England didn\u2019t have control in the centre.\n\nDeclan Rice sat deeper than Bellingham and often looked outnumbered. England struggled with shifting between phases of the pitch.\nWithout Jack Grealish or Phil Foden there is less in the way of angles and artistry on the ball when the spaces shrink, the range narrower.\n\nKane didn\u2019t touch the ball for 15 minutes in the first half. And in that period even the players\u2019 faces began to sag. Rice, so upright and perky against Iran, chugging sleekly like a champion police horse, seemed gaunt and troubled, with too much space to cover, too many holes to block. For long periods USA dominated, forcing corner after corner. Frankly England seemed happy to walk away from the whole gruelling spectacle intact.\nAnd perhaps it is a moment to reflect on the fact this is close to what we might have expected from this Narnia trip of a World Cup, a World Cup of bad energy and undercooked teams.\nA quarter of all the games so far have been nil-nils.\nAnd there are things England can do. Kane received some criticism for not scoring against Iran, despite playing well.\nHe barely figured here, resembling more than ever by the end a sad, noble cartoon lion. But he also has 17 goals in his last 20 caps. He will affect the game at some point. The midfield also looked too open. Perhaps the need to tinker and refocus will be of benefit.\nA strange, mournful evening at another strange, tinny, haunted stadium. But tournaments are odd things even at the best of times. England will roll on.\nPerhaps a little rage at the edges might even make this thing feel a bit more real."

                    "body": "There are dark clouds hovering over rugby at the moment. It has not been the best of times of late by any stretch of the imagination but the Six Nations provides an unbelievable opportunity to focus on the very best of our game as we pull back the curtain and welcome a wider audience to the sport. This is not to diminish from the problems engulfing the sport at the moment, which have to be treated with the utmost seriousness, but the Six Nations can help lift some of the gloom. It is a championship incomparable when it comes to any other sport on the international stage. It has a rich history and the proximity of the competing sides makes it such a captivating couple of months. Tens of thousands of supporters will migrate across five weekends, mix together and make such significant contributions to the spectacle.  This weekend we\u2019ll see them at Twickenham, in Cardiff and in Rome. In Twickenham the pubs will be packed by 10am, there\u2019ll be thousands of supporters making their way to the stadium, singing songs, pouring into the stands, desperate for their teams to win but embracing the sense of togetherness. That\u2019s before we even get into the competition, how tight the airspace is at the top end of it and, as much as it\u2019s an annual cliche, how this is shaping up to be the most competitive Six Nations in history. We can rejuvenate and be super-proud about what our sport is, what it can produce and celebrate the championship\u2019s ability to expand into a wider audience. It has got me excited and none of it is manufactured, it\u2019s just what the tournament brings. We have got the No 1 side in the world in Ireland, a France team who won the grand slam last year, considerable excitement around Italy \u2013 as much as since they joined the competition \u2013 a new era dawning with England and the return of Warren Gatland with Wales. We\u2019ll get tripped up trying to predict results, as we do every year, and that is the beauty of the Six Nations. This may be cliche number two but round one is so important because very few teams go on to win the title having lost their first match. Steve Borthwick will be aware that both Stuart Lancaster and Eddie Jones managed to beat Scotland in their first matches in charge of England and he will recognise the importance of following suit. Steve has spoken about the non-negotiables \u2013 things like workrate, fight, making every part of the game a competition. Those are things that can be introduced quickly because he really hasn\u2019t had much time in the job and with England, with players from so many different Premiership clubs, it can take time and the starts of recent campaigns have been far from ideal. He has also spoken about freedom, which is something you would not necessarily associate with England of late but I desperately hope that is what we\u2019ll see.  They might have had only 10 sessions together but Steve will know that if you can change the way that players think then ultimately you can change the way that they behave. That will have been the biggest influence from the coaches so far because I know that the players had felt constrained and restricted when they want to play with pace and fluency. Just look at the back five of the scrum. That is a dynamic combination who can cover plenty of ground \u2013 something Steve repeatedly made mention of this week. The backline is highly skilled too. They are not going to try and play like Harlequins but under Nick Evans maybe there will be a tendency to play what is in front of them. If there\u2019s an overlap 30m out, perhaps the first instinct will not be to kick the ball. Six Nations championships tend to have a slightly different feel to them in World Cup years, mainly because the sport\u2019s administrators are trying to align Test matches with how they want the tournament later in the year to play out. World Rugby had a shape-of-the-game meeting last November with all the key stakeholders, tournament owners, chief executives of the unions and a whole load of world-class coaches and referees. Those messages have been crystalised: they want a spectacle, they want space to be utilised and they want safety. We\u2019ve got a laser focus on what our game wants to be, how it\u2019s managed and what it looks like. A big part of that is speed of the game and we need to get the ball in play for longer. The directives have come that scrums and lineouts will be given the hurry-up \u2013 not to the detriment of safety \u2013 and there will be shot-clocks. The hope is that it will be translated into a more attractive spectacle later in the year but the beauty of the Six Nations is that either way, with so many closely matched sides, we can guarantee tension and excitement."

You don\u2019t see the squares like they are tonight, and not with the rugby union or rugby league either. I\u2019m just so proud and happy. This is what World Cups are for.\u201d\n\nThe Australia coach was talking after his team had beaten the odds and perhaps even their own expectations to qualify for the round of 16 at Qatar 2022. A deserved victory over the team placed 10th in the Fifa world rankings, Arnold believes this feat has sealed the creation of a second \u201cgolden generation\u201d for Australia after the team of 2006, but that now the focus must be on achieving more.\n\u201cIt\u2019s first time ever an Australian team has won two games of the World Cup in a row,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cMaybe we\u2019re talking about a new golden generation now because we\u2019ve been listening and hearing about the golden generation of 2006 who got four points \u2013 and now we\u2019ve got six.\n\u201cI\u2019m just so proud of the players, the work ethic, the commitment, the fight, the way they played. Denmark are top 10 in the world for a reason, they have high quality players who play in top leagues and defensively I thought we were outstanding tonight.\u201d\nAfter victory over Tunisia, Arnold had tried to bring his players down to earth by telling them they had achieved nothing yet. He said he had shared the same message after beating Denmark too. \u201cI truly believe that when you look at underdogs \u2013 teams like Japan and Saudi Arabia \u2013 they achieve something and they\u2019re celebrating, they\u2019re very emotional and they\u2019re on social media till 4 or 5 in the morning reading pats on the back\u201d, he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been around long enough to know that most important thing is recovery, it\u2019s sleep. Do everything to get ready for the next game.\u201d\n\nWhile crowds were up all night at home celebrating, Arnold advised his players to \u201cmake yourself happy before you go to sleep\u201d before the players go again on Saturday night, potentially against Lionel Messi\u2019s Argentina. Arnold said the Socceroos\u2019 progress has struck a blow for Asian football which, he says, is catching up the rest of the world \u201cquickly\u201d.\n\u201cWe were probably the last team everyone in Asia thought would qualify but it shows that when you walk on the pitch and have the right mentality where it\u2019s a war and you go out there and fight [what you can achieve]. It\u2019s great for Asia. I do believe Asia is getting stronger and stronger, particularly in the Middle East but also in South Korea and Japan. The travelling can make it difficult but i do think Asia is catching up quickly.\u201d"

                    "body": "Samurai Blue is more than just a nickname to Japan. To hear the veteran defender Yuto Nagatomo speak on the eve of their last\u201116 tie against Croatia was to receive a rousing education in how it relates to the character of a national team fighting to reach the World Cup quarter-finals for the first time.\n\u201cTo use the analogy of the samurai,\u201d the 36-year-old began, \u201cbefore they go into battle they polish their weapons and improve their technique. But if they are scared in battle they will not be able to use their weapons or their technique properly. It is the same in football. Tactics and technique are important but if you are scared on the field they are useless. To maximise all the tactics we have been practising in the last four years we need courage. The Japanese samurai is famous around the world and we would like to fight like samurais. Tomorrow we would like to showcase how courageously we fight.\u201d\n\nNo prizes for guessing who delivers the team talks in the Japan dressing room. The manager, Hajime Moriyasu, was considerably more restrained than the former Internazionale full-back, stressing the need for courage but also for his players to \u201cbe themselves\u201d, adding: \u201cThey should not be so tense that they forget what they are doing. They have shown their ability and now they can see it produces results.\u201d\nYet there is substance behind Nagatomo\u2019s rallying cry. Japan have come from behind to beat two of the past three world champions in Qatar and did so with only 27% possession against Germany and 18% against Spain, the lowest figure in a World Cup match since 1966. To fight, to never give in, have been hallmarks of their progress to the knockout phase.\n\n\u201cThere is an Italian word \u2018coraggio\u2019 which means courage,\u201d Nagatomo said. \u201cBefore the first game against Germany I shook hands with all the players and we shouted \u2018coraggio\u2019 together. Coraggio has manifested itself in our play. We are united as one and that is Japan\u2019s strength. I think we are the most united team at this World Cup. We came through the group stage as No 1. We are very confident now. We don\u2019t need to shout \u2018coraggio\u2019 any more.\u201d\nJapan need to erase painful memories from their football history on Monday, however. Samurai Blue have reached the last 16 of a World Cup three times and three times they have tasted defeat, each one harder to take than the last. After a 1-0 loss on home soil against Turkey in 2002 came a penalty shootout defeat by Paraguay in 2010. In 2018 they led Belgium 2-0 but Nacer Chadli completed the Red Devils\u2019 comeback with a 94th\u2011minute winner.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never forgotten that battle with Belgium; it has always remained with me,\u201d Nagatomo said. \u201cSometimes I will just suddenly remember something from that game. The last four years were very tough for me but we have overcome those challenging four years and we have grown mentally and physically. I have participated in a World Cup four times and as far as I can see this is the best and strongest Japan team in the history of the World Cup.\u201d\n\nMoriyasu said lessons had been learned since 2018 and that Japan have improved because of individual development. That in turn, he believes, has enabled Japan \u2013 along with South Korea \u2013 to be standard bearers for east Asia on the global stage. But his sights are much higher.\nJapan\u2019s manager said: \u201cIn order for Japan to win the World Cup we have been strengthening and nurturing youth players. At the same time the Japan football association has a target of contributing to Asian football by sending Japanese coaches to many countries in the region. It is great that Japan is contributing so much to the development of Asian football but unless we can win a World Cup we cannot lead other countries.\u201d\nZlatko Dalic, the Croatia head coach, believes there are parallels between the teams in terms of character and as two proud football nations succeeding in upsetting the established order.\n\u201cWe reached the final in 2018 because we believed in ourselves, we never gave up, we never surrender and we are prepared to fight,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we have similar mentalities and we are on equal ground. There are 4 million Croats and the results we have achieved in the last couple of years on the world stage is a miracle. We have become a world force and when we deliver great results at a World Cup we know we are bringing great joy to our country. We are the smallest country with the smallest population in the last 16. We are here against the odds.\u201d And looking to bury the last of the samurai."

People say the rhythm in the period was completely different but these type of players playing right now, he would have adapted the rhythm and spaces because he was so good. They control the games, so good in skills and mentality and everything. He could play in every generation.\u201d  Guardiola added: \u201cNeymar said a great sentence when he said before [Pel\u00e9\u2019s] No 10 was just a number and after it became something special. Every top player wanted to wear No 10 in their team. What he has done for football is there and always will remain. It\u2019s like a good movie, the legacy after many years. That we are still talking about him like a good movie or a good book is because he was so good. \u201cI think Pel\u00e9, Maradona, Cruyff, Messi, Beckenbauer, Cristiano Ronaldo \u2013 these type of players will be forever, they will be eternal.\u201d Frank Lampard, the former England and Chelsea midfielder who is now manager of Everton, recognised the enormous impact Pel\u00e9 had in the game. Lampard, 44, said: \u201cThere\u2019s huge respect for him as a player and as a person, as all the responses since yesterday have shown. He was a great man as well as a great player. He was one of the greatest without doubt. \u201cThe reach of his name in the game was obviously huge. It just gets bigger with age. We have lost him unfortunately but his name will continue for evermore because of his impact on the game.\u201d The Tottenham manager, Antonio Conte, said when he was young his father had told him all about Pel\u00e9. \u201cThe first person who spoke to me about Pel\u00e9 was my father. My father was in love with Pel\u00e9 because for him, he was the best player in the world and many times he spoke about him. Then I watched some games that he played and especially the final of the World Cup and [in] some situations it was incredible what he did with the ball. \u201cIf I have to compare Pel\u00e9 with Maradona, it is different because about Pel\u00e9 I listened, I had my father and I watched through the TV his quality and that he was an amazing player. About Maradona, I had the opportunity to play against him. Then to see and to touch his ability. But I repeat, Pel\u00e9 for my father was the best footballer in the world.\u201d Players will wear black armbands while there will be a minute\u2019s applause prior to kick-off at all Premier League and EFL games this weekend."

                    "body": "The schedule is relentless for the modern men\u2019s footballer. They often need to be primed to play twice a week and matches are especially bunched this season because of the World Cup in Qatar. Helpfully, footballers are almost superhuman, built for the physical rigours of a high-tempo sport and backed by incredible science and coaching to keep them at their best. The science behind nutrition, fitness and medical treatment is helping footballers achieve their athletic peak. At the top level they are playing more games than ever. Going into the 2018 World Cup, 29 players had featured for more than 5,000 minutes in the previous 12 months, but almost three times as many did so in the year before the European Championship in 2021. Their bodies are capable of doing more and are still being able to recover within a limited time frame.  Last season Liverpool\u2019s Virgil van Dijk played 60 matches for club and country, and in this campaign 17 already. That is an impressive feat but all the more so considering he missed most of the previous season with a cruciate knee ligament injury. He is a fine example of what the body can endure when prepared in the right way. Clubs took opposing views on how best to plan for this season\u2019s adapted calendar after a summer off. Tottenham ran their players hard to increase fitness, while Manchester City kept things more relaxed, preparing the squad to peak at various stages through the campaign. City played two pre-season friendlies before the Community Shield after finishing last season on 22 May but Tottenham arranged four fixtures before the Premier League kick-off. City will hope their methods pay dividends and that they will be in the Champions League final on 10 June. It is all part of a strategy aiming to get the best out of their players over an elongated season. Antonio Conte, on the other hand, wants his Tottenham squad to be pushed to their limits to understand the demands of playing for him, ensuring they are as fit as possible to deal with the rigours of his coaching style. International players\u2019 regimes work in cycles, ensuring they peak at the right time. This often involves a summer tournament, so they will be on a bespoke, carefully orchestrated plan for this season. Sports science staff at clubs are focused on doing the best for their employer but that requires working hand-in-hand with the national setup because they know the importance of major tournament football for their players. In Qatar, the players have the opportunity to take part mid-campaign when they should, in theory, be fresher.  Many countries have lost players from their squad. N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 has been ruled out for France after surgery on a hamstring problem and Diogo Jota will not feature for Portugal. In addition to confirmed absentees there are a number of players in a race to be ready. England have gone from having a great stock of talented right-sided players to worrying about the fitness of Kyle Walker and Reece James. A Fifpro survey showed players feel they are more likely to suffer injuries if they are playing many matches in a short period. Before a tournament I had to flick a switch when I crossed the white line to ensure I did not let thoughts of potential injury affect my game at club level because that is when you are more likely to be injured. Seeing teammates sustain injuries can spark extra anxiety, bringing home the realisation it could happen to you too, but it is important to clear your mind of such thoughts and focus on training and matches. Physically, players are prepared for these situations but the mental impact of a non-stop schedule can take its toll. This aspect will have a further impact after the tournament. The emotion is the key thing to deal with. I always felt it took me six months to recover mentally from playing in a major tournament but physically I had to jump pretty much straight into a league campaign. Everyone who reaches the World Cup will have put so much effort and dedication into representing their country that it is hard to recover. Some will be left wondering what is next having reached their perceived pinnacle and it can be difficult to get going again, especially if you have played plenty of games in recent years. The body can recover quicker from exertion and get through fatigue, it does increase the risk of injury, but it is the psychological element that is the hardest to recover and restore back to freshness. Sadio Man\u00e9 and Mohamed Salah enjoyed contrasting fortunes when they returned to Liverpool from the Africa Cup of Nations: the former was flying after winning the tournament, while the Egyptian struggled to get back to grips with the Premier League after the final defeat on penalties. The same could be seen when comparing Italy\u2019s triumphant Euro 2020 squad with many of the England players who lost. The modern player is equipped to deal with everything physically, even though more and more is demanded from them. The real test this season for those at the World Cup will be how they cope with the psychological demands when they return to their club duties."

                    "body": "The air of invincibility around Australia as they head into tournaments is such that the prospect of any opponent with hopes of standing in their way might seem like an exercise in futility from the outset. The eighth edition of the Women\u2019s T20 World Cup, which begins this week in South Africa, nears its kick-off hinged on a similar premise. Five-time winners in the showpiece 20-over event, current holders of the ODI World Cup and inaugural Commonwealth Games gold medallists, Australia saunter into the tournament as firm favourites. Since the start of 2018, they have placed first at all major events, scripted record unbeaten streaks and blooded fresh talent like Alana King, Tahlia McGrath and Annabel Sutherland, who have gone on to quickly establish themselves as the future of the side and world cricket.  The only match Australia lost in the past 14 months was a cliffhanger in Navi Mumbai that culminated in India\u2019s first super-over victory, in December last year. In their only assignment so far this year, Australia pummelled Pakistan on home soil across limited-overs formats. They rounded off their World Cup preparations with a thundering 2-0 victory in the three-match T20I leg of the contest, with the final game of the series washed out. But almost against the run of play, an unexpected false step came just three days out from their T20 World Cup opener against New Zealand, scheduled for 11 February in Paarl. In their second and final warm-up, the women in green and gold suffered a three-wicket defeat at the hands of Ireland. \u201cWe just got rolled by Ireland, so maybe they can stop that [favourites] tag,\u201d Australia vice-captain Alyssa Healy said. She added there was \u201cnothing too stressful\u201d about result. \u201cBut, look, I am an honest believer that you don\u2019t defend a World Cup; everybody comes here to win it. You\u2019re not bringing the trophy in with you. We\u2019re just approaching the tournament like that.\u201d Pooled in Group A alongside Commonwealth Games bronze medal winners New Zealand, hosts South Africa, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, Australia are within reason to rely on pragmatism and perspective rather than their pedigree alone. Battled-hardened through botched title defences not so long ago, their pursuit of a three-peat in T20 World Cups this month might feed off the fearlessness that has underpinned their resurgence since coming up short against West Indies and India in the final of 2016 T20 World Cup and the semi-final of the 2017 ODI World Cup, respectively.  Their tactical ferocity in the 20-over form that has been a staple since the 2016 T20 World Cup is most pronounced in their scoring rate, currently at an unrivalled 7.95 runs per over. With Healy batting against Ireland \u2013 she made a 40-ball 62 in what was her first innings since 17 December \u2013 the make-up of Australia\u2019s likely XI is set to regain its menacing formidability. The T20 World Cup also ushers in a new era on the leadership front for the team. The tournament will be Healy\u2019s first as full-time deputy to Meg Lanning, having stepped into the shoes of recently retired Rachael Haynes. A refreshed Lanning, who came out of a five-month hiatus during the Pakistan series, is looking to take her storied career to greater heights, as will some of the other senior pros of her vintage, including Ellyse Perry and Jess Jonassen.Yet a potential distraction for several of the Australian squad looms during the tournament with the Women\u2019s Premier League auction taking place on 13 February. But if the mood in their camp is anything to go by, the thrill of going under the hammer might finish a close second to finishing atop the podium. \u201cThe World Cup is the pinnacle of our sport,\u201d Healy said. \u201cA lot is made of the India rivalry and the Ashes series but the World Cup is the pinnacle and that\u2019s what we\u2019re here to do. We\u2019re here to do a job and get that trophy back in our hands.  \u201cEverything else that\u2019s happening around the world at the moment is super exciting and everyone\u2019s really chuffed about where the women\u2019s game is at, but as soon as we pull on an Aussie shirt, we\u2019re here for one focus and that\u2019s to win a World Cup, so we\u2019ll all come together for that.\u201d There are other unknowns to be tackled too \u2013 South Africa is relatively uncharted territory for Australia. The only ever assignment any Australian women\u2019s side has had there is a solitary 50-over World Cup in 2005. The sole opportunity that arose subsequently for them to tour South Africa \u2013 a scheduled engagement comprising three ODIs and as many T20Is starting late-March in 2020 \u2013 was put paid to by the onset of Covid-19. \u201cWe\u2019ve never really been in South Africa before; only three girls in our squad have been here, so these conditions are new to us,\u201d Healy said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to learn to play them really quickly come Saturday night and just go out there and play as good cricket as we can for an extended period of time. That\u2019s the only way you\u2019re going to win a T20 World Cup.\u201d"

We are the smallest nation in our group but that doesn\u2019t mean a thing when you have fight and passion and belief. I love it.\u201d\nWhen Gareth Bale equalised against the USA in Cymru\u2019s first game at the World Cup finals since 1958, the fan park erupted. Strangers hugged, kissed and danced. The polite notices not to throw beer into the air were roundly ignored. The game ended 1-1 but few left disappointed.\n\n\u201cThis means so much,\u201d said a dewy-eyed Paul Carroll, 40. \u201cI may never see the like of this tournament with my kids again. It\u2019s the best feeling. I\u2019m so proud.\u201d\nJust being at the World Cup after so many decades felt like a win. Before kick-off fans had jumped on tables and joined in ear-bashing versions of Tom Jones\u2019 Delilah and Yma o Hyd (Still Here), the defiant Welsh language folk song that has been adopted by the squad and has become a fan favourite.\nThe rendition of the national anthem threatened to do more damage to the tent roof than the bitter wind ever could, as 2,000 fans here \u2013 and 3 million more across the nation \u2013 united in song.\n\nSome wore lucky shirts that they vowed to keep on throughout the group stage no matter the beer or sweat stains. Others followed rituals they hoped would bring fortune \u2013 the same pub, the same curry house they went to during Wales\u2019s qualification campaign.\nThere were few here who could remember Wales\u2019s 1958 World Cup adventure (they lost in the quarter-final to Pel\u00e9\u2019s Brazil). Alun Jenkins, 75, was around but he said he had just failed his 11-plus. \u201cSo I had other things on my mind. I don\u2019t think it was such a big deal then.\u201d\nIt\u2019s certainly a big deal now.\nThe former Welsh goalkeeper, Neville Southall, who was in attendance to launch this Swansea fan park, said he hoped the World Cup would raise the mood of the nation. \u201cIt\u2019s good for the people to have some hope, some joy in these pretty gloomy times,\u201d he said.\nSouthall did not shy away from the sensitive issues, criticising Fifa for threatening to sanction players who wear the OneLove armband: \u201cWhy penalise someone promoting inclusivity? Football is for everybody.\u201d\nIt felt a little bit worse when Laura McAllister, professor of public policy at Cardiff University and a former captain of the Welsh women\u2019s football team, tweeted from Qatar that her rainbow bucket hat had been confiscated. \u201cWe will continue to stand up for our values,\u201d she said.\n\nAhead of kick-off, McAllister had explained the importance of the World Cup for Wales. \u201cThe whole Welsh football scene has been a reflection of a new self-confidence in the nation, especially among younger people,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThis gives us a chance to show what our strengths, our USP are. It\u2019s a huge platform. We will be doing everything we can not just to win games but to leverage as much profile and awareness and knowledge.\u201d\nEvie Jones, 18, left the Swansea marquee beaming. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the best flag, the best anthem, the best fans. I can\u2019t wait for the next game.\u201d"

On Sunday, he was among a group of Austrian and American skiers caught up in the avalanche on Nagano prefecture\u2019s Mount Hakuba Norikura. Three of the skiers were eventually able to make their way down the mountain but Smaine and another man, who has yet to be identified, were later found dead according to local police. Japanese authorities had issued an avalanche warning for the area after heavy snow. One of the American skiers, who was buried for 25 minutes before being dug out by rescuers, told Mountain Gazette: \u201cWe heard the crack. We realized: \u2018It is a big one.\u2019 We started running and then we got hit.\u201d  The US embassy in Tokyo said it was \u201caware of the incident in Nagano prefecture and has been in touch with the relevant authorities to provide all appropriate assistance.\u201d Smaine had retired from international competition and his last high-profile event was in February 2018. Fellow athletes paid tribute to him on Sunday. \u201cWe all did this for Kyle tonight,\u201d two-time Olympic halfpipe skiing champion David Wise said on Sunday, after his X Games victory. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of an emotional day for us.

This followed Fifa instructing seven European nations, including Germany, that their captains should not wear the OneLove armband, which stands for tolerance, diversity and LGBTQ+ rights.\nAfter the shock defeat Germany faced criticism that their protest had caused a lack of focus. Van Gaal was asked about this. \u201cThat is the question,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to run that risk \u2013 we\u2019re here to be a world champion \u2026 We put a full stop behind all the political issues [last] Thursday when we invited the migrants and we have this purpose. We are not going to have that tarnished by the actions of Fifa or whichever other organisation.\u201d\n\nBelgium\u2019s Eden Hazard echoed Van Gaal. \u201cGermany\u2019s gesture? They would\u2019ve done better if they didn\u2019t do it and tried to win,\u201d the forward told RMC Sport. \u201cWe\u2019re here to play football, I\u2019m not here to convey a political message.\u201d\nIt was put to Van Gaal that those back home were experiencing the World Cup differently because the spotlight remained on Qatar\u2019s human rights issues. \u201cThat has got to do with the environment in the Netherlands,\u201d said the 71-year-old. \u201cA different environment than what we see here. \n\u201cEverything has been organised in an excellent way. No criticism whatsoever. Perhaps it\u2019s all about human rights [at home] and maybe rightly so but also perhaps not rightly so. I believe I\u2019ve responded enough to that.\u201d\n\nCody Gakpo scored the Netherlands\u2019 second in their opening 2-0 win against Senegal, the 23-year-old\u2019s fourth goal in his 10 games. Van Gaal believes the PSV forward can be a breakout player of the World Cup. \u201cHe is a player with a lot of talent and possibilities,\u201d said the coach. \n\u201cHe is young and is a player who is still evolving and has a lot of room for improvement and has a personality that will do everything that it takes. Whether he will be a star at this World Cup, I don\u2019t know, but it is possible.\u201d\nThe Netherlands face Ecuador on Friday with Memphis Depay, who had had a hamstring problem, being fit to play a half at least after managing half an hour against Senegal. Van Gaal admitted selecting him in the squad contravened his usual code regarding players who are not fully fit.\n\u201cThis is a player that is quite extraordinary [so] I\u2019ve set aside my principles because I believe he is incredibly important to us,\u201d Van Gaal said. \u201cI explained this to the players. I do all this for Memphis and the players understand this. He played 30 minutes and really isn\u2019t grappling too much with the issue so we\u2019re proceeding to the next step, which is 45 minutes.\u201d"

                    "body": "With a swipe of his right boot, Aleksandar Trajkovski sent Italy back in time: to November 2017, their lowest moment, a nightmare that a nation has spent four and a half years trying to escape. Back then, the head of the Italian Football Federation, Carlo Tavecchio, described missing out on a World Cup as an \u201capocalypse\u201d. What word could describe a repeat of the end of all things? Roberto Mancini was without answers in the wake of Italy\u2019s 1-0 defeat by North Macedonia on Thursday. He took the blame on himself, but more than once reached for the same phrase as he fielded questions about the match and his future: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know what to say.\u201d  To fail like this was, on the surface, inexplicable. Italy, winners of the European Championship last summer, had held 65% of possession and taken 32 shots to North Macedonia\u2019s four. There were no end of statistics to illustrate their superiority \u2013 from the corner count (16 to 0) through to expected goals (1.98 to 0.18). And yet, there were few clearcut chances. Only when the North Macedonian goalkeeper, Stole Dimitrievski, passed straight to Domenico Berardi in the 29th minute, offering an open net, did a goal truly seem likely. The Italian rolled the ball tamely into Dimitrievski\u2019s arms. You could call it an unlucky night. There was nothing inevitable in the fact that Trajkovski should bury his shot so brilliantly in the 92nd minute, even if he was back at the Stadio Renzo Barbera, where he played for Palermo in Serie B three years before. Equally, though, this match was no outlier. Italy have sometimes seemed close to invincible under Mancini \u2013 setting an international football record as they went 37 matches undefeated, finally succumbing to Spain in the Nations League after playing for more than a half with 10 men. Yet they have not had a winning habit for some time. Only two of their preceding nine matches ended with victory in 90 minutes. Penalties were required to overcome Spain and England in the final rounds of Euro 2020. Profligacy got them into this playoff mess. The Azzurri took 27 shots to Bulgaria\u2019s four last September in a match that finished 1-1. They drew twice with Switzerland after Jorginho missed penalties that could have won both matches. Either would have sufficed to top the group. Whose fault is it when a team forgets how to score? It would be easy to make a scapegoat of the centre-forward Ciro Immobile, who has three times finished as Serie A\u2019s capocannoniere \u2013 equalling the league\u2019s record with 36 goals two seasons ago \u2013 yet has found the net a meagre 15 times in 55 Italy appearances. He drew a blank against North Macedonia just as in both legs of the playoff loss to Sweden in 2017. Yet this was collective failure. Lorenzo Insigne\u2019s form for Napoli has dropped off noticeably since Euro 2020, critics suggesting that his mind is already with Toronto, the MLS club he will join in the summer. Federico Chiesa is injured. Berardi was the only member of the attack to arrive in full health and good form. Why did Mancini stick with a group of forwards, and indeed a formation, that was no longer working? A system that had perhaps not functioned quite the same since Leonardo Spinazzola was injured against Belgium last summer. The more vexing question for Italian football is whether the alternatives were simply not good enough. As Italy searched for a goal in Sicily, Mancini sent on Giacomo Raspadori, a promising but raw talent who had scored once in seven appearances for the national team, and Jo\u00e3o Pedro, an uncapped 30-year-old with one goal in his past 13 games for Cagliari, 17th in Serie A.  Tavecchio\u2019s successor at the Italian Football Federation, Gabriele Gravina, acknowledged that reality on Thursday night. \u201cThere are very few selectable players,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must understand why so many young players don\u2019t get used [by their club teams].\u201d It is one thing to identify the ailment, and another to find a cure. Plenty of words were expended after 2017 on the failings of Italian football\u2019s youth development and a need to do things differently. Five years later, here we are. That is not to say nothing has changed for the better. Mancini is not Gian Piero Ventura, who never knew success to begin with and whose tenure ended with open mutiny from his own substitute\u2019s bench. The core of the team that won the Euros remains, and there are emerging talents to build on, from Alessandro Bastoni at centre-back to Sandro Tonali in midfield. Gravina insisted he would like Mancini to stay, and plenty of Italians would support that. Everything good that happened in the past three and a half years has not been eliminated in one stroke.  Yet the inescapable reality is that Italy will miss a second consecutive World Cup: a catastrophe for a generation of players. Jorginho, third in the Ballon d\u2019Or last year, has represented Italy since 2016 without having the possibility to be called up for a tournament that the Azzurri have won four times. Marco Verratti, Italy\u2019s enfant terrible at Brazil 2014, will be 33 by 2026. Little wonder that Mancini, whose contract runs to that summer, was struggling to come to terms with Thursday night. \u201cThe disappointment right now is too great to talk about the future,\u201d he said. \u201cJust as the victory last July was the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve experienced at a professional level, this is the greatest disappointment of all.\u201d"

                    "body": "Twitter stands a 50% chance of a major outage that could take the site offline during the World Cup, according to a recently departed employee with knowledge of how the company responds to large-scale events. The former employee, who was granted anonymity because of the sensitivity of what was discussed, has knowledge of the workings of Twitter Command Centre, the platform\u2019s team of troubleshooters who monitor the site for issues such as traffic spikes and data centre outages. \u201cBetween the lack of preparations and the lack of staffing, I think it\u2019s going to be a rough World Cup for Twitter,\u201d said the former employee. He suggested that an incident of some kind \u2013 such as a service responding slowly or incorrectly \u2013 is almost a certainty during the 29-day competition in Qatar, estimating a 90% possibility of something going wrong that users would see. The likelihood of Twitter staying online during the competition, which kicks off on Sunday, is no better than even, according to the former employee. Twitter is \u201clikely to struggle with traffic at kickoff, and may crash,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we\u2019re lucky, it will recover with minimal disruption.\u201d Twitter\u2019s ability to respond to any issues with its IT infrastructure has been weakened by swingeing cuts that Elon Musk, the CEO of electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla and founder of space exploration company SpaceX, has instigated since his 28 October purchase of the platform for $44bn . Approximately half of the company\u2019s 7,500 workforce were sacked in the first week. In the second week, around four in five of the firm\u2019s 5,500 contractors were released. And this week a further 1,000 or more workers resigned after Musk issued an edict asking them to opt into future employment. Many of those who resigned were Twitter\u2019s most experienced staff, some of whom had been at the social media platform for more than half its existence. Some of those affected by layoffs or employee attrition include those in Twitter Command Centre. The Observer understands as many as a third of the small global incident team may have departed in recent weeks.  The company is ill-prepared to handle the likely flow of traffic to the platform as people seek to discuss key moments during the World Cup. \u201cTraffic gets very spiky during big events, so any big play or controversial call will drive a very sudden surge of traffic \u2013 and the infrastructure would have to absorb the impact,\u201d said the former employee. \u201cUnder other circumstances there would be plenty of people watching things and making sure any hotspots get dealt with.\u201d A so-called \u201cchange freeze\u201d, which halts the ability to change Twitter\u2019s coding \u2013 in place before Musk\u2019s takeover and imposed on and off throughout his first few weeks \u2013 has hampered preparations, the former employee claims. Asked what plans are in place at Twitter to tackle issues likely to arise during the World Cup, he said: \u201cNone that I know of. We should have been doing things weeks ago.\u201d The prognosis for the World Cup is something that concerns John Ioannidis, a former software engineer at Twitter who was working for the company as it handled issues arising during the 2014 World Cup. \u201cThe brouhaha with Elon really peaked in the last couple of weeks,\u201d Ioannidis said. \u201cEven with the best set of equipment and hardware, sudden influxes of traffic can cause problems.\u201d According to Ioannidis, the company was constantly monitoring Twitter\u2019s infrastructure to ensure it stayed online during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. \u201cThere are so many ways that things can fail, you can\u2019t predict all of them,\u201d he said. The platform went offline for periods of the 2010 World Cup under high traffic. The potential for high volumes of traffic during the competition also worries Alan Woodward, professor of cybersecurity at the University of Surrey. \u201cAt the moment Twitter appears to be trusting things to luck, which in my experience is not a reliable approach,\u201d he said. The recently departed anonymous Twitter employee is \u201cdreading\u201d the start of the tournament. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do anything to help,\u201d he said. Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Twitter no longer has a communications department after the layoffs. Overnight on Friday, Musk tweeted: \u201cFirst World Cup match on Sunday! Watch on Twitter for best coverage &amp; real-time commentary,\u201d alongside a survey of users asking whether they would welcome the return of former US president Donald Trump, who was banned from Twitter in January 2021 for inciting violence through the platform."

They are carrying visitors along the crest of a sand dune whose slopes are scarred by the tracks of overland vehicles and SUVs. At the bottom, a gargantuan Chevrolet advertisement offers alternative transport options and a long line of semi-permanent structures hawks tourist trinkets. This is the gateway to a region Qatar hopes will bewitch those who want a break from the football: a near-empty expanse of undulating sand that covers the country\u2019s south-eastern interior and is marketed as an outdoor adventurer\u2019s playground.\nIn truth it hardly resembles a honeypot and that is how its temporary residents like it. The Saudi Football Association stole in quickly to secure this base, at the exclusive Sealine beach resort, two and a half years ago. It is only 25 miles from the border with their country and, an hour\u2019s drive south of Doha, feels cut off from the inner city\u2019s manic energy. They knew from the experience of 2019, when Qatar hosted the Gulf Cup, that the noise and logjams of an urban centre present unwelcome hurdles over the course of a tournament.\nSo it is to the quiet backdrop of those dunes and, 100 metres in the other direction, a palm-fringed stretch of sand that Herv\u00e9 Renard leads his players out for practice. The complex is closed to everyone bar the Saudi setup, their loved ones, operational personnel and a small number of visitors who have purchased day passes for a sectioned-off area of beach. One describes himself as \u201ca guest of the emir\u201d; it is the footballers, though, who have reaped the most obvious benefits of local hospitality.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an unbelievable feeling but we were talking about this and, if we want it to last, we have to qualify from the group,\u201d says Saleh al-Shehri, who scored the equaliser against Argentina and set in train one of the World Cup\u2019s great upsets. Saudi Arabia face Poland next and their task is to repeat the intensity and bravery that bent proceedings to their will last time out. Saturday\u2019s opponents may be considered a rung down from Argentina but Renard\u2019s side would still ordinarily be viewed as underdogs.\nThree points would, contrary to every initial expectation, guarantee their first knockout assignment since the Saeed al-Owairan-fuelled campaign at USA 94. \u201cAll the odds were against us,\u201d Shehri says. \u201cWe believe in ourselves and we worked hard to get here because it wasn\u2019t easy. And I think we proved to everyone that we are worthy of being here.\u201d\nSuccess inevitably begets greed for more but there is an awareness back home that, even if the Saudis fall short from hereon, they have already earned a place in legend. Perhaps they are at their best when the pressure is off. Last month Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince, met the squad and told them to \u201cbe comfortable, play and enjoy the tournament\u201d. That request has been fulfilled so far.\n\nNonetheless excitement will be at fever pitch on Saturday and venues such as Mrsool Park, a stadium in Riyadh that has been given over to a fan park and giant screen, will teem with anticipation. \u201cWe have to make our country and our fans proud,\u201d Shehri continues. \u201cGoing through is a dream for us: to get back there after all these years would be amazing.\u201d\nBefore the session starts, Renard stands in deep conversation with Yasser al-Misehal, the FA president. Misehal makes his way back around the pitch and is soon joined, in the modest bank of seats erected for onlookers, by Renard\u2019s parents. Their arrival brings spontaneous applause: families have been allowed to join the players and staff today, adding to the close-knit feel around a setup happy to be at a remove from the external gaze.\n\nThat is where most of the Saudi squad spend their time. They are all domestic-based and only the most dedicated of football followers from further-flung regions could reel off their names before Tuesday. It means that they have no secrets from each other and, having spent a two-month training camp together in the runup to Qatar 2022, felt ready to surprise the outside world. \u201cI think we\u2019ve developed a lot,\u201d Shehri says. \u201cIt\u2019s a chance to prove to everyone that Saudi football is getting better day by day.\u201d\nPhysical duels will, he suggested, be decisive against Poland. It will be a different kind of challenge, perhaps an equally imposing one if Robert Lewandowski has mended his radar, but the opportunity ahead is alluring. During the group stage about 200,000 Saudis are expected to visit Qatar for the party: that number would swell considerably with progress to the last 16. Shehri can see the prize. \u201cWe made history and there is still more to come, inshallah,\u201d he says.\nDriving north back towards the capital, along near-empty highways, flares leap high into the darkening sky from the stacks of a sprawling oil refinery that adjoins the stretch of shore next to Sealine. The contrast with the wandering dromedaries is stark and there is a sense that, in this short trip to the Saudis\u2019 base, the raw materials powering the host country\u2019s month-long festival have been set in microcosm.\nSaudi Arabia, whose country has its own tension between the private and the tableau shown to the public, intend to keep global eyes on the brighter side this weekend."

                    "body": "The Socceroos have given their strongest indication yet that Martin Boyle\u2019s World Cup is in serious jeopardy, flying Marco Tilio to Doha as a potential injury replacement a week before the start of their campaign. Australia\u2019s camp insist Boyle can still overcome the knee injury sustained while playing for Hibernian a fortnight ago, but the Scotland-born winger \u2013 one of his adopted country\u2019s key players \u2013 was absent from training for a second day running on Tuesday evening (Wednesday morning AEDT).  In his place was Tilio, who was not selected in Graham Arnold\u2019s 26-man squad but has been called up on standby in the event Boyle is not ready come the eve of the tournament. Fifa regulations stipulate World Cup teams are allowed to replace an injured or ill player up until 24 hours before their opening match. Australia play France next Tuesday night (6am Wednesday AEDT). Boyle, who has five goals from his 19 caps, has been under a cloud since the end of last month when he hurt his knee during his club\u2019s 3-0 Scottish Premiership win against St Mirren. His Socceroos teammate and Hearts midfielder, Cameron Devlin, clearly articulated the 29-year-old\u2019s importance. \u201cOver the years everyone can see what a big player he is,\u201d Devlin said. \u201cHe does it week in, week out over in Scotland for Hibs. He\u2019s been a massive player for them and takes it into his country, Australia. He\u2019d be a massive loss, but I think it\u2019s just precautionary because we\u2019ve got the first game in a week. But if he wasn\u2019t to play he\u2019d be a massive loss.\u201d Tilio, 21, was a notable omission when Australia\u2019s World Cup squad was announced last week, having been considered on the cusp but lacking in consistent enough form and minutes for Melbourne City to warrant his selection.  At the time the City head coach, Patrick Kisnorbo, said \u201cthe hype\u201d around the precocious forward \u201chasn\u2019t helped\u201d and added: \u201cEvery week we get asked about Marco. It\u2019s only normal that sometimes people listen.\u201d Every Socceroos player is now on the ground in Qatar, after the final few arrived late on Monday night local time \u2013 before Tilio materialised on Tuesday morning. Even with the full complement, Tim Cahill had his boots on again, participating in warmup drills at the $1.3bn Aspire Academy, Australia\u2019s all-inclusive base at which the former striker is chief sports officer. Cahill, while long retired, remains the last Socceroo to score at a World Cup from open play, via a head-turning volley against the Netherlands at Brazil 2014. Devlin, 24, met him for the first time on Monday. \u201cI spoke to him after training yesterday,\u201d Devlin said. \u201cFor someone like me to pick his brain \u2026 to have him here and ask him questions, if I can make myself a better player by listening to him, I\u2019ll take every opportunity to do that. \u201cHe joined in training yesterday so that was pretty cool to be up alongside him with the boots on. Legend for Australian sport, so just to be around him is super surreal.\u201d"

                    "body": "On the eve of Croatia\u2019s crucial World Cup qualifier against Russia last November, Luka Modric sat down with Dominik Livakovic for a chat. The Dinamo Zagreb goalkeeper had lost his place to Ivo Grbic after being blamed for mistakes in the 2-2 home draw against Slovakia a few weeks earlier that jeopardised his country\u2019s chances of securing a place in Qatar.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be telling you this if I didn\u2019t care about you but I see that you are not progressing with the national team,\u201d Modric tells Livakovic in a conversation that was captured during the Netflix documentary, Captains.\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s the pressure you\u2019re under, maybe it\u2019s not \u2026 but you\u2019re radiating uncertainty and that rubs off on the team. Do you understand? Why can\u2019t you make a mistake? We all make mistakes. I feel that your problem is that you\u2019re afraid of making them \u2026 name one person who doesn\u2019t make mistakes. I didn\u2019t get to where I am by being scared, it only makes things worse. Look, you\u2019re a great goalkeeper. You know that, right?\u201d\n\nModric\u2019s approach has certainly paid dividends. Little more than 12 months since that conversation in a hotel lobby, man-of-the-match performances against Japan and Brazil at the 2022 World Cup transformed Livakovic into an instant hero in Croatia. The 27-year-old became only the third goalkeeper in history to save three penalties in a World Cup shootout in the last-16 victory against Japan, following in the footsteps of Portugal\u2019s Ricardo against England in 2006 and fellow Croatian Danijel Subasic against Denmark at Russia 2018 \u2013 who, like Livakovic, was born in Zadar.\n\u201cI never thought about it possibly being my last game for Croatia, because when it went to penalties I told everyone that Livakovic would save them,\u201d Modric said after watching that victory from the bench having been substituted. Livakovic said: \u201cMy whole life in football flashed before my eyes before the first penalty, emotions that I\u2019ll definitely never forget.\u201d\nBut things would get even better for him against Brazil. Eleven saves during normal time was the most recorded by a goalkeeper since 2014, when USA\u2019s Tim Howard made 16 saves against Belgium in the last 16. Then his stop to deny Real Madrid\u2019s Rodrygo from the spot led to Livakovic joining Argentina\u2019s Sergio Goycochea, Germany\u2019s Harald Schumacher and Subasic as the only goalkeepers in World Cup history to make four shootout saves.\n\n\u201cHe was there to do what he\u2019s supposed to do, he saved the first penalty and gave us confidence and less confidence for Brazil because they were afraid he\u2019d save again,\u201d the coach Zlatko Dalic said. \u201cHe made the difference for us over the whole match.\u201d\nThe softly spoken Livakovic also excelled at volleyball and basketball in his youth and briefly studied diplomacy and international relations at Zagreb university before joining Dinamo in 2015. \u201cI\u2019m putting it aside while I\u2019m playing football, but I want to do it one day,\u201d he said in an interview in 2019. \u201cAnd my family is perhaps not sorry these days that I chose the ball instead of the book \u2026\u201d\nLivakovic \u2013 the son of Zdravko Livakovic, a former state secretary of Croatia\u2019s ministry of transport \u2013 made his debut for Dinamo\u2019s first team in October 2017 having previously played for amateur side NK Zagreb. Two years later, he broke a record that had stood for more than 20 years for most minutes from the start of Dinamo\u2019s season without conceding a goal.\nModric was not the only Real Madrid legend who spotted his ability at an early stage. \u201cThis year I have followed Dominik Livakovic,\u201d tweeted Iker Casillas in April 2019. \u201cHe plays for Dinamo Zagreb. 24 years old. Interesting.\u201d\nCasillas is one of Livakovic\u2019s idols and the former Spain goalkeeper and 2010 World Cup winner again showed his appreciation after the victory against Brazil with the tweet: \u201cDominik Livakovic, PORTERO [goalkeeper].\u201d\nLivakovic was Subasic\u2019s deputy at the 2018 World Cup as Croatia made it all the way to the final in Russia before losing to France. \u201cEverything was particularly emotional,\u201d he said in an interview a few months later. \u201cApart from the result, which is the biggest in the history of Croatian football, the emotions that stuck in my memory the most during the last World Cup in Russia were the moments when our passage depended on penalties. It\u2019s something that can hardly be described in words: I was yelling, laughing and crying at the same time.\u201d\n\nNow Argentina and Lionel Messi stand in the way of Croatia emulating the class of 2018 when they meet in Tuesday\u2019s semi-final. Only this time they will have to get past Livakovic. \u201cHonestly, I like playing big matches, that adrenaline and the atmosphere that can be felt in the air. That\u2019s when I have the highest concentration.\u201d"

It came little more than 24 hours after Queiroz called for J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann to resign from a Fifa committee over remarks about the \u201cculture\u201d of Iran\u2019s team.\n\nSpeaking at his pre-match press conference, the 69-year-old year old took great pains to praise the US team and their performances in Qatar. He also highlighted his own role in the development of the game in the States in the 90s. Asked about the USA\u2019s social media post, which removed the symbol of the Islamic Republic from the flag and led Iran to call for the US to be banned from the World Cup, Queiroz took quiet aim at social problems in the US.\n\u201cWe have said many times that we have solidarity of all humanitarian causes,\u201d Queiroz said. \u201cBut we have solidarity with causes all over the world whoever they are. If you talk human rights, racism, kids dying at schools from shooting, we have solidarity with all. But we bring a smile for 90 minutes, that is our mission.\u201d\nProtests in Iran since Mahsa Amini died in hospital while in police custody have seen at least 450 people killed, and more than 18,000 arrested, according to Human Rights Activists in Iran, an advocacy group following the demonstrations.\nThe USA coach, Gregg Berhalter, apologised for the tweet of the flag. \u201cI can only reiterate that the players and staff knew nothing about what was being posted sometimes things are out of our control,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not focused on those outside things, all we can do is apologise on the part of the players and the staff.\u201d\nQueiroz was asked about his lengthy tirade against Klinsmann, after the German had said the \u201cculture\u201d of the team was to look to pressurise the referee into giving fouls, but the manager said he had \u201cno comment\u201d to make. However went on to defend his team and what he called their \u201cvalues and principles\u201d.\n\u201cI always work and always believe in my life that a football team must be based on the work ethics and principles of what a team is. [I want] to create a code of conduct that can make players believe every single morning they wake up that they need to be better, to beat what they were the day before. The only thing I care to talk about is the team as a unit, cohesion and being as a family.\u201d"

                    "body": "\n\nThe main event\nQatar\u2019s controlling interests in football are not restricted to this World Cup, as the arrival of two major stars on the tournament stage will remind us. After all, Qatar Sports Investments owns Paris Saint-Germain, the club that feature Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 in an all-star forward line.\nBeyond the widespread social, political and economic issues that surround this tournament, Messi playing in his fifth (and probably final) World Cup at 35 seems the purest football narrative. Can a player regarded widely as the best ever \u2013 certainly of the 21st century \u2013 finally capture the trophy that has so painfully eluded him? The closest he has come was in 2014, when Argentina were losing finalists to Germany as Messi had an ineffectual game at the Maracan\u00e3. \u201cThe only thing I wanted to win was the World Cup,\u201d he said after receiving the Golden Ball award for the best player of the tournament, his face like thunder.\nFour years ago, he was let down by an Argentina team incapable of defending and, in losing 4-3 in a memorable last-16 match to Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s France, it seemed the baton was passed to the best player of the next generation. Mbapp\u00e9 scored two goals on that day in Kazan and would eventually claim the prize Messi so desired at the first time of asking \u2013 aged just 19 \u2013 as France were crowned champions in Moscow.\n\nMessi begins his quest against Saudi Arabia, whose crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, was highly visible at the tournament\u2019s opening match; it is no secret that the Saudi leadership hopes to host the 2030 World Cup. The Argentina squad is far more durable than four years ago. Their manager since they exited that tournament is Lionel Scaloni, briefly a West Ham player and still only 44. He has built a balanced squad, full of classic, strong defenders such as Manchester United\u2019s Lisandro Mart\u00ednez and Tottenham\u2019s Cristian Romero.\n\nThere is a decent supporting cast of attackers, too, with Inter\u2019s Lautaro Mart\u00ednez likely to lead the line, lifting the burden from Messi and allowing him to select his moments to shine. Argentina have gone 36 matches unbeaten and are South American champions, having broken Messi\u2019s senior international tournament duck by winning last year\u2019s pandemic-affected Copa Am\u00e9rica behind closed doors in Brazil.\nMessi took time to adjust to the added physicality of Ligue 1 but this season has been playing well, and working on his strength looks to have added a further dimension. Mbapp\u00e9 signed a huge contract to stay at PSG last summer, one giving him a say in the club\u2019s footballing direction, but while there are reports of a rift with Neymar, he and Messi have struck up an understanding.\nIn Qatar, with France kicking off against Australia in Tuesday\u2019s late game, he finds himself in a position his older clubmate would recognise, that of standard bearer carrying a heavy responsibility. Karim Benzema was ruled out of the tournament on Saturday, joining Presnel Kimpembe, Christopher Nkunku, Paul Pogba and N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 and leaving Mbapp\u00e9 bereft of an all-star cast of helpers.\nTalking points\nEmpty seats an issue againAn unfortunate trend continued into day two of the World Cup with banks of empty seats visible at all three fixtures. On Sunday, fans of the hosts abandoned their team in the second half of Qatar\u2019s 2-0 defeat against Ecuador. On Monday gaps in the crowd were visible from the off. Senegal versus the Netherlands, the other two teams in Qatar\u2019s group and the standout fixture in Group A, drew an official crowd of 41,721, from a tournament capacity of 44,400 (a figure confirmed by Fifa). England\u2019s 6-2 rout of Iran fell 500 short of capacity, according to official numbers, 45,334 from a capacity of 45,857 (although some images suggested greater gaps than that). Even Wales\u2019s draw with USA, which generated the best atmosphere of the tournament so far and had the Welsh red wall out in full force, fell short of full capacity.\nOrder restored at Al Bidda fan parkAfter overcrowding created chaos at the Al Bidda fan park on Sunday night, something closer to the intended plan was restored on Monday. With the park opening for England v Iran and running late into the night, crowds inside the entertainment space were substantial but numbers closely managed. There are few public options to engage with the tournament in Doha, making Al Bidda\u2019s big screen a draw. The substantial Budweiser bar is also popular with travelling fans (though hardly proving a magnet in and of itself). Crowds on Monday were mainly locals, but vocal groups from Mexico and Argentina were also there alongside a smattering of England fans \u2013 including the Indian contingent from Kerala who generated most of the noise during England\u2019s win. \u201cWe\u2019re at 10% right now,\u201d said their shop steward Girish. \u201cWe\u2019re keeping the rest in the pocket for later rounds.\u201d\nConcussion controversy back in headlinesEngland\u2019s first half against Iran lasted for 59 minutes after a long delay while the Iran keeper, Ali Beiranvand, received treatment after a clash of heads and then briefly attempted to play on. The decision to allow Beiranvand to try to continue was fiercely criticised by the brain injury charity Headway. \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t have stayed on for a second, let alone a minute,\u201d said their interim chief executive, Luke Griggs. \u201cHe was clearly distressed and unfit to continue.\u201d Beiranvand was eventually substituted.\nGrealish\u2019s wave for young City fanJack Grealish\u2019s celebration after he scored England\u2019s sixth goal against Iran was a promise to a young fan with cerebral palsy. Grealish met Finlay, an 11-year-old fan earlier this year, and said he would do an agreed dance the next time he scored. Finlay wrote to the Manchester City player after Grealish talked about his own sister, who also has the condition. The youngster had initially requested Grealish do the worm, but the pair settled on a wavy-armed move that required less exertion.\n\nBeyond the football\nWhile the saga rumbled on with the Uefa nations who had been planning to wear the OneLove armband, Iran had their own moment of protest on Monday. Fans in the stands booed the Iranian national anthem, which the team as one declined to sing, in a show of support for people back in Iran where major protests continue. Sardar Azmoun, who came on as a substitute in the 77th minute, was given a rousing reception by Iran fans, some of whom held up protest banners in the crowd. The Bayer Leverkusen forward recently spoke up in support of Mahsa Amini, a woman who died in Iranian police custody after refusing to observe the country\u2019s conservative dress code.\nTicketing did not go smoothly on Monday, with fans left stranded outside the Khalifa International Stadium when Fifa\u2019s app failed. Supporters were directed to check for confirmation emails or visit ticket resolution point in the stadium. On social media England fans described the scenes as \u201cchaos\u201d and complained that only one window was open and that they were being forced to queue in the heat.\n\nGlobal media-watch\nQatar\u2019s local media was thrilled with how the opening ceremony went down \u2013 but less enamoured with the lacklustre defeat that followed. Muhammad al-Marri in the Al Watan wrote that \u201cthose who doubted and promoted lies and spread fallacies, their loss was heavy\u201d, while the pro-government semi-official paper of the Gulf state, Al Raya, said it was \u201coverwhelmed with feelings of love, gratitude and pride in our wise leadership\u201d after Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani spoke at the opening ceremony.\nOn the field it was a different matter, with Sahan Bidappa in the Gulf Times criticising a team that appeared \u201cfrozen, clearly overawed by the historic occasion\u201d, saying: \u201cThe manner in which they crumbled against Ecuador would have disappointed the home fans.\u201d That may have been evident by the sheer number of empty seats visible as the match approached its conclusion.\nThe internet reacts\nThere were a lot of people dismayed after England and others caved over wearing the OneLove armband, but the BBC television pundit Alex Scott was called a \u201clegend\u201d for adopting it when she did her pre-match piece to camera. On Sunday, the BBC had shunned the opening ceremony entirely on BBC One in favour of a piece critical of the hosts.\n\nThere was disappointment in the England-Iran game, though, as a potential reenactment of a legendary World Cup moment failed to materialise.\n\nIt was Milad Mohammadi who famously attempted \u2013 and failed \u2013 with an acrobatic somersault throw in the 93rd minute against Spain in their group game in 2018.\nMeanwhile, Budweiser have reappeared on Twitter after an awkward silence, and offered the World Cup-winning country all the surplus beer they can\u2019t sell at stadiums in Qatar. Cue wags asking if the second prize is up for grabs instead.\n\nToday\u2019s matches\nArgentina v Saudi Arabia (Group C, 10am GMT, ITV1) Having lost 5-0 in the opening match at Russia 2018, Saudi Arabia could be in for another difficult start. They face a side who thrashed the United Arab Emirates 5-0 in a warmup last week and have not conceded since a 1-1 draw with Ecuador in March, so the strikers Saleh al Shehri and Firas al Buraikan will need to pounce on any chances they get.\nDenmark v Tunisia (Group D, 1pm GMT, ITV1) Having made it to the semi-finals of Euro 2020 despite the collective trauma of Christian Eriksen\u2019s cardiac arrest, Denmark are aiming to go far again and will feel victory is essential here. Tunisia lost 5-1 to Brazil in September, but have impressed under Jalel Kadri with a clutch of young dual-nationality talents \u2013 including the Br\u00f8ndby forward Anis Ben Slimane, born in Copenhagen and capped by Denmark at under-19 level.\n\nMexico v Poland (Group C, 4pm GMT, BBC One) With Mexico in shaky form, this could be the Robert Lewandowski show. As all-time top scorer for his country, the talismanic forward carries an enormous burden of expectation. He has never scored for Poland at the World Cup and will be determined to set that right against El Tri, who lost 2-1 to Sweden in their final warmup game.\nFrance v Australia (Group D, 7pm GMT, BBC One) They may be reigning champions, but France have battled injuries and internal divisions in the buildup to this World Cup. Nothing unusual there, then. They remain absurdly well-stocked with talent and will be confident of repeating their opening victory four years ago in Russia. Karim Benzema, the team\u2019s self-described F1 car, may have broken down at the worst possible time, but they still have a magnificent go-kart in Olivier Giroud.\nPlayer to watch\nGarang Kuol He may only have made his international debut in September, but Kuol has already stirred excitement in Australia. Aged 18, he has scored six goals in 13 appearances for Central Coast Mariners in the A-League and earned a January move to Newcastle United. Born in Egypt after his family fled South Sudan, his backstory has captured the collective imagination. He may not start against France, but a cameo would give Kuol a chance to stake a claim for the rest of the tournament.\n\nAnd finally \u2026\nIn an effort to avoid a potential clash between the Three Lions and the three kings, the Church of England is advising vicars to reschedule Christmas carol services due to be held on 18 December \u2013 World Cup final day. The C of E says Sunday services \u201ccould still be possible if you choose the time carefully\u201d (kick-off is 3pm, GMT) but then asks: \u201cWhat if there are penalties?\u201d The answer to which is surely simple \u2013 pray."

I will be back on Monday, by which time we will be halfway through the round of 16, and England will either be guaranteed surefire winners on their way to the title for definite this time, or we\u2019ll be embroiled in a massive postmortem with every Tom, Dick and Harriet on Twitter saying that if only Gareth Southgate had played an extra three forwards in a 2-1-7 formation, surely England\u2019s destiny would have been assured. I digress. Rob Smyth is your man for Ghana v Uruguay.  Barry Glendenning is at the controls for South Korea v Portugal.  Enjoy the football, and have a great weekend.     2.40pm    Australia coach Graham Arnold has also been up before the media, and vowed his side will take on Argentina with \u201call guns blazing\u201d in their World Cup last-16 showdown on Saturday. \u201cLook, the group games are past us and it\u2019s a one-off game, anything could happen,\u201d PA reports Arnold said. \u201cIt\u2019s 11 v 11, a battle, a war and we\u2019ve got to fight that. We\u2019ll give it everything, all guns blazing. \u201cWe respect Argentina, for sure, but we can\u2019t focus solely on them. We respect them but we respect ourselves and what we bring to the table.\u201d Arnold feels Australia\u2019s success is payback for a gruelling qualifying campaign, where Covid restrictions back home meant playing most of their matches away, including five in Qatar itself. \u201cThe universe is paying us back for the hard work we put in,\u201d he added. \u201cWe played four games out of 20 at home, and we had some hard journeys. \u201cBut Covid helped unite this team together, these boys were in lockdown in hotels. \u201cThe fact we played five qualifiers in Qatar gave us experience of being here, and now we\u2019ve won six out of seven games in Qatar. For us, it\u2019s a home away from home. \u201cOne thing we have achieved is bringing light to the nation after Covid and reuniting our sport. We\u2019ve seen the scenes of celebration and it really makes everyone proud, and we want more. \u201cWe haven\u2019t finished yet, we are turning up to win another game tomorrow.\u201d     2.37pm    Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni complained about the limited recovery time ahead of his squad\u2019s World Cup last-16 clash against Australia but promised his team would play out of their skins to ensure there are no more surprises at the tournament. Argentina beat Poland late on Wednesday to book their spot in the knockout stages and must play Australia on Saturday, a turnaround time that Scaloni had previously described as \u201cabsolute madness\u201d, Reuters reports. Scaloni and midfielder Rodrigo De Paul said they have yet to train, instead focusing on down time and recovery over the past two days. \u201cAustralia, who finished second in the group, played at 6pm and we finished first (in our group) but played at 10pm We went to bed at 4am and that has an impact when you have a game in 48 hours,\u201d Scaloni told reporters on Friday. \u201cWe will break our backs on this pitch to compete, we know how difficult this World Cup is, this is football. \u201cWe saw what happened yesterday but this is not surprising. When you say big national teams deserve to be in the next stage, that doesn\u2019t always happen.\u201d There were concerns winger Angel Di Maria was injured when he was taken off in the 2-0 win over Poland. Scaloni said they would assess player fitness before taking a call on the starting lineup. \u201cDi Maria is feeling fine, we hope he will be fine and is able to play. At the moment we don\u2019t have a clear picture,\u201d Scaloni said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve seen our matches, you know I don\u2019t always play the same players. I focus on every single match and adapt the team for the match. Very rarely have I repeated the starting 11. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is everyone knows what they need to do. We will go match by match and won\u2019t always play the same team if it isn\u2019t necessary.\u201dScaloni said Argentina must shed the \u201cfavourites\u201d tag going into the contest, while De Paul said they had analysed the team that beat Tunisia and Denmark in the group stage. \u201cI think it\u2019s a very fast team, focusing on wide players, and they have tall centre backs as well. I think we shouldn\u2019t make fouls near the area. They have very fast wingers and their main strength is their counterattack, so we need to be very careful. We shouldn\u2019t be on the back foot. It will be difficult for our midfield and defence so our forwards are free to roam.\u201d     2.18pm    Tom Sanderson writes for us today that Brazil need Neymar to win the World Cup \u2013 even if some fans disagree: Neymar knits the attack together and his absence was obvious against Switzerland. Brazil had 23 shots against Serbia, but this dropped to 13 against the Swiss. Brazil had a similar number of passes in both games \u2013 581 against Serbia compared to 550 against Switzerland \u2013 but the gulf in shots and xG (2.43 against Serbia compared with 1.02 against Switzerland) suggests they spent a lot of time knocking the ball around without finding a way of opening up the defence. Neymar is the player in their squad who is best equipped to thread through the final ball. Brazil do not have a perfect replacement for Neymar. Against Switzerland they brought the defensive midfielder Fred into the starting lineup to partner his Manchester United teammate Casemiro, and pushed Lucas Paquet\u00e1 further forward to take on Neymar\u2019s responsibilities. The West Ham man was hooked after a flat first half. On came Rodrygo, the stand-in the masses in Brazil wanted to see, and the player who claims Neymar has told him the No10 jersey will be passed from one Santos academy graduate to another one day. Though excellent in the box \u2013 as he showed for Real Madrid when they won the Champions League last season \u2013 Rodrygo is not yet ready to fill Neymar\u2019s boots. Read more here: Tom Sanderson \u2013 Brazil need Neymar to win the World Cup \u2013 even if some fans disagree      2.16pm    Here is a little bit more detail on those teams via Reuters: South Korea v Portugal (Group H, 3pm GMT, BBC1 in the UK) Portugal make six changes to face South Korea Captain Cristiano Ronaldo will lead Portugal\u2019s attack against South Korea at the World Cup on Friday despite having to train separately from the rest of the team this week but Fernando Santos made six changes to the side that beat Uruguay on Monday. Portugal, needing only a draw to be sure of top spot in Group H and mindful of the risk of yellow-card suspensions in the next round, have brought Diogo Dalot and Antonio Silva into the defence. Matheus Nunes, Vitinha and Joao Mario come into the midfield in place of Bernardo Silva, William Carvalho and Bruno Fernandes \u2013 who scored twice in the 2-0 win over Uruguay \u2013 while Ricardo Horta replaces Joao Felix up front. South Korea leave out injury doubt Kim Min-jae South Korea\u2019s Portuguese coach Paulo Bento left out central defender Kim Min-jae, who was an injury doubt, and replaced him with Kwon Kyung-won, while Lee Jae-sung and Lee Kang-in were drafted into midfield. The Koreans, with one point so far, must beat Portugal and hope the result of Ghana\u2019s match with Uruguay goes their way in order to reach the last 16.  Ghana v Uruguay (Group H, 3pm GMT, BBC2 in the UK) Uruguay start veteran Su\u00e1rez and drop captain Godin Uruguay give a start to veteran striker Luis Suarez and have dropped captain Diego Godin from their defence for their must-win World Cup Group H decider against Ghana on Friday. Suarez, playing in his fourth World Cup, will be at the centre of a three-man attack with Darwin Nunez and Facundo Pellistri, who gets a start for the second time, in a match the South Americans have to win to avoid their first group stage exit since 2002.Ghana bring back Seidu and Rahman at the back Ghana, who will go through to the last 16 with a win, make two changes to the team that beat South Korea 3-2, restoring Alidu Seidu and Baba Rahman to the fullback positions they played in during the opening game against Portugal, in place of Tariq Lamptey and Gideon Mensah.      1.56pm   Team news: South Korea v Portugal \u2013 Ronaldo starts  Here is the other team news \u2026 South Korea: Kim Seung-gyu, Kim Moon-hwan, Kwon Kyung-won, Kim Young-gwon, Kim Jin-su, Lee Jae-sung, Lee Kang-in, Jeong Woo-yeong, Hwang In-beom, Son Heung-min, Cho Gue-sung Portugal: Diogo Costa, Diogo Dalot, Pepe, Antonio Silva, Joao Cancelo, Matheus Nunes, Ruben Neves, Vitinha, Joao Mario, Cristiano Ronaldo, Ricardo Horta Officials: Referee Facundo Tello, assistant referees Ezequiel Braislovsky and Gabriel Chade, fourth official Maguette N\u2019Diaye Barry Glendenning is in the big MBM chair for this one \u2026      1.55pm   Team news: Ghana v Uruguay \u2013 Su\u00e1rez and Nunez start  Here is the team news \u2026 Ghana: Lawrence Ati-Zigi, Alidu Seidu, Daniel Amartey, Mohammed Salisu, Baba Rahman, Thomas Partey, Salis Abdul Samed, Mohammed Kudus, Andre Ayew, Jordan Ayew, Inaki Williams Uruguay: Sergio Rochet, Sebastian Coates, Giorgian de Arrascaeta, Jose Maria Gimenez, Guillermo Varela, Mathias Olivera, Rodrigo Bentancur, Facundo Pellistri, Federico Valverde, Luis Su\u00e1rez, Darwin Nunez Officials: Referee Daniel Siebert, assistant referees Jan Seidel and Rafael Foltyn, fourth official Yoshimi Yamashita Rob Smyth is your man for this on the old MBM \u2026      1.26pm    Harry Kane was the most abused England player on Twitter during the World Cup group stages, accounting for nearly three out of 10 negative tweets directed at team members. England players were sent 1,546 abusive tweets during the group stages of the World Cup, according to analysis by the Alan Turing Institute, accounting for 2% of the more than 75,000 tweets mentioning players for the national team. The institute\u2019s online safety team found that 13% of those abusive tweets \u2013 or 205 posts \u2013 contained keywords that referred to a protected characteristic such as race, gender or sexuality. The England captain received the most abusive posts, being tagged in 426 abusive tweets that made up 28% of the total of negative posts sent to players\u2019 Twitter handles during England\u2019s three group games. Read more here: Harry Kane most abused England player on Twitter since World Cup started \u2013 study      1.03pm    We are about an hour away from getting team news for this afternoon\u2019s matches, which as a reminder are:  Ghana v Uruguay and Portugal v South Korea at 3pm GMT  We will of course have MBMs for both of them running at the same time. The equation in this group is fairly straightforward. Portugal are through, and just need a point to top the group. Ghana go through with a win. A draw is probably enough for Ghana. Uruguay must win, and that would put them through. All that changes though if South Korea can beat Portugal, at which point we are in abacus territory. South Korea need to win by a couple of goals and hope Ghana and Uruguay draw, or that Uruguay win by the same margin or less than South Korea have beaten Portugal. I would normally type out something smug like \u201cbut none of that is going to happen\u201d at this point, but yes, I watched the football yesterday, so all bets are off.     12.43pm    Harry Maguire\u2019s shot against Wales that ended up going out for a throw-in is sure to be a staple of comedy England montages for years to come \u2013 step aside Geoff Thomas \u2013 but fairplay to the lad he is not shy about doing his media duties. Maguire has been in the England equivalent of the Big Brother diary room talking about set pieces, saying:  We\u2019ve got a really good record from set plays. The lads work hard on making space for myself, and obviously you\u2019ve got to go and attack the ball. We\u2019ve got players in the team, not just myself, who attack the ball really well from corners. So it\u2019s a big threat of ours. It\u2019s amazing these big games, they\u2019re really tight, they\u2019re realy edgy, and set plays, they\u2019re crucial. They can separate you from having a bad game, to having a good game and winning a football match.       12.25pm    Nick Roll is in Dakar, and he writes for the Guardian today that there is a buzz in the air in the bustling capital and a real belief the Lions of Teranga can beat England: \u201cThey will win. The Senegalese team is the champion of Africa,\u201d says Ousseynou Thioune, selling a variety of jerseys and wristbands on a busy boulevard. He predicts 2-0. \u201cThey\u2019re still the Lions, even without Sadio,\u201d Thioune says, referencing star forward Man\u00e9, who was injured in a Bayern game just before the beginning of the World Cup. When it was announced that the Ballon d\u2019Or runner-up would have to sit out, drama and consternation among the football- and Man\u00e9-crazed populace ensued. In the aftermath, one man told France24 that \u201cI cried when I saw\u201d the news. \u201cWith my friends, we were talking about it. There were some who had bought a television [to watch the World Cup] \u2013 and they sold it back,\u201d he said. Yet the Lions have more than persevered. Their opening game against the Netherlands, resulting in a 2-0 loss, was quickly pushed aside with 3-1 and 2-1 wins over Qatar and Ecuador, respectively. Read more here, and it has got some great photos in it as well: Nick Roll \u2013 \u2018Senegal is the best\u2019: Dakar\u2019s dreaming of World Cup upset      12.18pm    The good news for the US is that Christian Pulisic is said to be on track to play for the United States in its World Cup round of 16 match against the Netherlands on Saturday, We last saw Pulisic in Tuesday\u2019s final group stage match against Iran leaving at halftime after bruising his pelvic bone in a collision with the goalkeeper while scoring in the 38th minute.   AP reports US coach Gregg Berhalter said before Friday\u2019s training session \u201cIt looks pretty good, but we\u2019ll have to see him today on the pitch to get confirmation of that,\u201d  Pulisic, a 24-year-old winger, had said on Thursday that he was feeling better. Forward Josh Sargent also left the Iran match in the second half nursing an injury after hurting his right ankle. \u201cWith Christian we\u2019re hopeful, with him a little less so,\u201d Berhalter said.     12.06pm    Ghanaian journalist Benedict Owusu has been on BBC Radio today, and he has backed up chaotic supervillain striker Luis Su\u00e1rez that revenge should not be the order of the day when the African side face Uruguay later today. He told listeners:  Su\u00e1rez is right. We had the opportunity to score with that penalty from Asamoah Gyan, which he missed. We made it to the penalty shootout but we missed as well. We have to forget about the revenge, as it will go wrong. You always have to focus on what is ahead. I am very happy that the team and the players are not thinking about revenge. They are focused on the game and doing everything possible to get a good win \u2013 a result which will make sure they get to the next stage.      11.49am    We have some words for the media from US coach Gregg Berhalter ahead of their knockout match with the Netherlands tomorrow. \u201cWe deserve to be in the position we\u2019re in and we want to keep going,\u201d Berhalter said. \u201cSo for us, it\u2019s about how we recover from this game and prepare to play against a very good Dutch team, very well coached, ton of quality all over the field, and we have to come up with an idea of how to beat them.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a pretty fun one, playing against the country I was born in,\u201d he said. \u201cI know almost every single guy over there,\u201d AP report he told the media. Berhalter turned professional in the Netherlands 28 years ago.  If the US can beat the Netherlands and reach the quarter-finals, it will equal their best campaign in modern times. The US reached the last eight in 2002, losing 1-0 to Germany.     11.23am    Philip Oltermann reports for the Guardian from Berlin on reaction in Germany to the exit of the national team from the World Cup at the group stage: It was a \u201cwinter nightmare\u201d (S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung), an \u201cenormous embarrassment\u201d (Bild), a \u201cnew low point\u201d that revealed the four-times world champions to have shrunken into a \u201cfootball dwarf\u201d (Spiegel). The morning after the Nationalmannschaft crashed out of the World Cup at the group stage for the second tournament in a row, German front pages made for blunt reading. On paper, Germany\u2019s exit was a marginal affair. But that was not how the match has been digested in Germany the day after. Whether the ball had crossed the line in the Japan-Spain match was barely discussed in the TV postmortem and a secondary concern for most newspapers. Instead, the time had come for soul-searching questions about the philosophy of the German football since its World Cup win in 2014, or the lack of one. In the TV studio, Bastian Schweinsteiger said that the German players didn\u2019t seem to have the same \u201cburning\u201d desire for success as others, explicitly naming Costa Rica but seeming to imply his own heroics at the Maracan\u00e3. The DFB, Germany\u2019s football association, needed to train and produce more F\u00fchrungsspieler or \u201cleadership players\u201d, he added. Read more here: Philip Oltermann \u2013 \u2018A football dwarf\u2019: German media reacts to Die Mannschaft\u2019s early World Cup exit      10.53am    No VAR decision has sparked more debate than the award of Japan\u2019s second goal against Spain on Thursday evening, when \u2013 to the naked eye \u2013 it appeared that the ball had crossed the line and gone out of play. It ended up sealing Japan\u2019s qualification and effectively knocking Germany out of the tournament. What happened? Ao Tanaka scored in the 51st minute to make it 2-1 to Japan, following a cross by Kaoru Mitoma. But the question is whether the ball crossed the goalline for a Spain goalkick first.  The bottom line is that whole of the ball has to cross the line to be out, and that includes any curvature of the ball that is over-hanging the line.  The angle you take a photograph of a ball on or near the line makes a difference to how the eye perceives it. We sent photographer John Windmill down his local park with a football to recreate the scene for us. More here \u2026      10.46am    Tunisia striker Wahbi Khazri has announced his retirement from international soccer, Reuters reports. Khazri scored to give Tunisia an historic 1-0 win over holders France on Wednesday, joining Saudi duo Salem Al-Dawsari and Sami Al-Jaber as the all-time leading Arab scorers at World Cups with three goals each. \u201cAfter the Tunisia match, and in a meeting that included all the players and the technical and administrative staff, I told everyone that this moment is appropriate, and I thanked everyone and wished them success,\u201d Khazri told Bein Sports French. \u201cI am proud of what I gave my country over the past years, and I believe that the future for this generation is bright.\u201d The 31-year-old Montpellier striker said: \u201cTo beat France, to score and be decisive, that is more beautiful.\u201d  Khazri, who was born in France and played one game for the French national side in 2012, switched to play for Tunisia and won 74 international matches with them, scoring 25 goals along the way.     10.41am    Adam White writes for the Guardian today to say that Didier Deschamps needs a better plan for France than just relying on Kylian Mbapp\u00e9: Didier Deschamps has looked indecisive for some time. Even though he had deployed wing-backs and a trio of centre-backs for much of the last two year, when announcing his World Cup squad, Deschamps surprisingly said he would switch back to a four-man defence \u2013 despite not having any warm-up games before the tournament to test the set-up. It was assumed this meant France would be returning to the asymmetrical 4-2-3-1 formation that served them so well at the World Cup in 2018. However, Deschamps opted for a more traditional 4-2-3-1 against Australia and Denmark, with Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 operating on the right and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 on the left. The manager seems to be lurching from one idea to the next. Initially, he picked just 25 players in his squad \u2013 one fewer than everyone else \u2013 before adding Marcus Thuram a few days later, seemingly at random. The coach insisted he had planned the move all along and had wanted to see how the final round of domestic fixtures would play out. Yet, when Karim Benzema was eventually ruled out with injury, he then declined the opportunity to bring in another striker.

This video clip doing the rounds on social media appears to show television presenters mocking the German team\u2019s gesture of covering their mouths in their team photo to say they had been silenced over human rights issues while waving them goodbye.       10.29am    The German Football Association (DFB) will next week launch a round of talks to identify the reasons for their second consecutive World Cup flop, after the team were eliminated in the group stage again on Thursday night, Reuters reports. \u201cYou can imagine that today there is deep disappointment,\u201d DFB President Bernd Neuendorf told reporters on Friday at Doha airport as the team prepared to return home. \u201cThis elimination is extremely painful. But we have to look ahead and so we will lead a process on how to deal with this.\u201d \u201cThe expectation is for the sporting direction to have a sporting analysis of this tournament and to also develop a prospect for after the tournament and the Euros on home soil,\u201d Neuendorf said. \u201cIt must also include the development of the national team since 2018. This is the demand and claim that we have. Then we will have more talks.\u201d The Germans suffered a similar first-round exit at the 2018 World Cup in Russia, their earliest departure in over 80 years at the time. \u201cI am a strong supporter of clear processes and expect to hold these talks with respect and in private. We are taking the first step before the second step,\u201d Neuendorf said. Germany qualify automatically as hosts for Euro2024.      10.20am    If you prefer to watch your podcast rather than listen to it, here is an excerpt of yesterday\u2019s daily edition of Football Weekly, with some lively discussion and analysis \u2013 and more than a few laughs \u2013 about last night\u2019s stupendous action in Group E.      9.29am    Nick Ames is in Doha for the Guardian, and he previews today\u2019s clash between Serbia and Switzerland: Four years ago, hostilities had been publicly stoked. Yet much of the buildup to their latest showdown has resembled a convention of the saints. It was clear on Tuesday, when Sergej Milinkovic-Savic and Dusan Tadic took questions at Serbia\u2019s Al Arabi training base, that nobody was of a mind to dangle bait. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt it was big pressure four years ago but we need to focus on football and show we can play better than them,\u201d Tadic said when asked how Serbia would handle the occasion this time. His teammate matched the answer virtually word for word. Neither player expected emotions to run high: the priority was simply to look at themselves.  Mitrovic struck a similar note, saying: \u201cIt was a different game, we\u2019re not thinking about what happened before.\u201d The problem is that the wider context tends to lurk beneath the surface and undermine any well-scripted words. Serbia are under Fifa investigation for displaying a flag showing Kosovo as part of their country, along with the words \u201cWe do not surrender\u201d, in their dressing room before their opening game against Brazil. That did not go unnoticed in Kosovo. Read more here: Nick Ames \u2013 Switzerland and Serbia feel the weight of history before high-stakes clash      9.21am    Tomorrow we will be in the thick of the knockout stages, and Saturday evening\u2019s fare in Qatar will be Argentina v Australia. The Socceroos have been talking up the awe they hold their opponents in, while for Argentina, it has been about avoiding complacency. Steve Douglas at AP writes that Australia\u2019s players speak in glowing, almost reverential terms about Lionel Messi. \u201cHe just does things that, you know, no one else can do,\u201d forward Mathew Leckie said. Milos Degenek went even further. \u201cProbably,\u201d the Socceroos defender said, \u201cthe best footballer ever to grace the game.\u201d \u201cI think they\u2019re obviously driven by the motivation that it could be Messi\u2019s last World Cup,\u201d Degenek said, \u201cand he wants to win the World Cup and end it on a high. For us, it\u2019s about stopping that. Unfortunately, I\u2019m a big fan of his, but I\u2019d love to win the World Cup probably more than him.\u201d \u201cNo one expects us to win,\u201d Leckie said. \u201cSo let\u2019s shock the world.\u201d  Argentina have already weathered the storm of their shock opening defeat to Saudi Arabia. \u201cWe know, at the moment, everything is very difficult,\u201d said Messi, who is bidding to win the World Cup in his fifth and likely last attempt. \u201cAll the opponents are complicated. We know it as well as anyone.\u201d \u201cWe went back to being what we were for a long time,\u201d Messi said after Argentina\u2019s 2-0 win over Poland that secured a place in the last 16, \u201cand how we were looking to be at the beginning of the World Cup, which for different reasons we could not manage. \u201cIt gives confidence for what is coming.\u201d      9.05am   Group H: What do Ghana, South Korea and Uruguay have to do to join Portugal in the next round  Group H \u2013 Ghana, Portugal, South Korea, Uruguay Final matches Friday 2 December, 3pm GMT: South Korea v Portugal, Ghana v Uruguay Portugal have qualified. A point will guarantee they win the group. Ghana: A win against Uruguay will put Ghana through. A draw will be enough unless South Korea beat Portugal, in which case Ghana must hope South Korea pull off only a one goal victory, otherwise the Asian side will pip them on goal difference. South Korea: They must beat Portugal, and hope that Ghana do not win. If Ghana draw then their hopes depend on their goal difference compared to Ghana. If Ghana lose, then South Korean hopes depend on their goal difference compared to Uruguay. Uruguay: Uruguay must win, and hope that South Korea do not win against Portugal. If both Uruguay and South Korea win, then their relative goal differences will decide who qualifies. Uruguay start with a goal difference one worse than South Korea, so would have to beat Ghana by more than South Korea beat Portugal.      9.03am   Group G: What do Cameroon, Serbia, Switzerland have to do to join Brazil in the next round  Group G \u2013 Brazil, Cameroon, Serbia, Switzerland Final matches Friday 2 December, 7pm GMT: Cameroon v Brazil, Serbia v Switzerland Unless Cameroon can beat Brazil, the match between Switzerland and Serbia looks like being a straight knockout tie. Brazil have qualified and just need a point to guarantee top spot. Switzerland: A win ensures Switzerland go through. A defeat means they go out. If Switzerland draw, they will still progress unless Cameroon have beaten Brazil, in which case goal difference will come into play. Cameroon: Cameroon will progress only if they can beat Brazil and Switzerland do not win. A draw between Serbia and Switzerland \u2013 or a Serbian victory \u2013 would leave second place being contested on goal difference between Cameroon and one of the European sides. Serbia: Serbia will progress only if they can beat Switzerland. However, if Cameroon also beat Brazil, then second place will be contested on goal difference between Serbia and Cameroon.      8.42am    Karen Carney\u2019s latest column is up for us. She says England have a plan to take them to the final but warns that high-quality Senegal are a danger: England have not lost in their 20 matches against African opposition, which is an impressive record. There have already been shocks in the tournament and the important thing is for England to maintain their focus. Kalidou Koulibaly scored Senegal\u2019s winner after a free-kick was crossed into the box against Ecuador, a sign of how dangerous he is. England will be favourites but they should not have one eye on the quarter-final because they will be punished. I have played in tournaments where we were tipped to win, lost concentration, conceded two goals from set pieces and were on the next plane home. Senegal have lost some key players: not only Gueye and Kouyat\u00e9 but also Sadio Man\u00e9 before the World Cup began. Selfishly, as an England fan, this is good news because they will be very hard to replace. Senegal do, though, have plenty of quality. We have seen at Watford how dangerous Isma\u00efla Sarr is and he proved that by winning and scoring a penalty against Ecuador. Read more here: Karen Carney \u2013 England have a plan to take them to the final but high-quality Senegal are a danger      8.37am    Over 17 million people tuned in to German broadcaster ARD\u2019s coverage of the World Cup match between Germany and Costa Rica on Thursday, according to data from audience measurement firm AGF, Reuters reports. The survey sadly doesn\u2019t specify how many people threw their shoes at the telly in disgust at the end of the game.      8.32am    We will be coming to how that Japan goal was allowed to stand shortly, but late last night it was one of the main topics of conversation in the pod with Max and the gang. Barry Glendenning, Lars Sivertsen, Jonathan Fadugba and Archie Rhind-Tutt were with Max Rushden to assess the fallout from an extraordinary night of drama. Get it in your ears.      8.30am   Preamble  Well then, Morocco and Japan topping their groups was a coupon-buster yesterday and no mistake. Will we get anything similar today as our final groups, Group G and Group H, come to a climax/shuddering halt [delete as appropriate]? The evening matches see an already qualified Brazil Reserves XI take on Cameroon. Brazil need a point to top the group, Cameroon need to build on their spirited comeback against Serbia with a win or they are not going any further. Serbia and Switzerland could be tasty. The winner probably goes through, a draw is enough for the Swiss, and they met at this stage in 2018 and it was a bad-tempered affair. Before that, South Korea need a win against already qualified Portugal to stand any chance of progressing. Portugal need a point to guarantee top spot and avoid playing full-strength Brazil on Monday. Uruguay and Ghana have a rematch of that contentious 2010 quarter-final, with both sides knowing a win will probably see them progress.  Ghana v Uruguay and Portugal v South Korea at 3pm GMT Cameroon v Brazil and Serbia v Switzerland at 7pm GMT  Before then I will be bringing you reaction to yesterday\u2019s matches, words from the people paraded in front of the press in Qatar today, and all the other World Cup bits and bobs you need.

                    "body": "As a measure of how much Jordan Pickford\u2019s performances have flown under the radar during this World Cup, it turns out the England goalkeeper is so underrated that three of his best saves haven\u2019t even been recognised.\nYes, there was plenty of praise for the sharp reflex stop from Iran\u2019s Sardar Azmoun in England\u2019s opener in Qatar. And true, everyone applauded when Pickford kept his side level during their last-16 match against Senegal by pushing away a shot from Boulaye Dia.\nBut were you aware Pickford made an even better save against Senegal, springing off his line and using the top of his left arm to deflect a close-range effort from Isma\u00efla Sarr over the bar? Or that he got a touch to a cross-shot from Dan James during England\u2019s 3-0 win over Wales? Or, perhaps most impressive, that it was his fingertips that took a venomous, goalbound drive from Christian Pulisic on to the bar during the 0-0 draw with the USA?\n\nThe answer is \u201cno\u201d if you happen to be one of the officials from those games. Three times Pickford saved England by turning efforts behind; three times England were awarded a goal-kick when their opponents should have been given a corner.\nIn fairness, these things happen at lightning speed. Watching from the press box, I thought all three of those shots had flown off target. But Pickford knew. He was particularly adamant on the save from Pulisic. Nothing was going to get past him and what was unclear to the naked eye soon became apparent when England\u2019s goalkeeping coach, Martyn Margetson, took a closer look at the footage.\nIt must have been a moment of huge personal satisfaction for Margetson, who played for Manchester City and Huddersfield, among others, and was capped once by Wales, in 2004. He once made headlines by critiquing Pickford\u2019s technique during a television appearance, noting how the Everton goalkeeper sometimes had his hands too low when preparing to face a shot, but the pair clearly work well together on the training ground.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a really good understanding from Martyn on what Jordan needs, getting him in the right habits and the right behaviours every day to get the best out of him,\u201d Gareth Southgate said last week. \u201cThat relationship is a healthy one.\n\u201cBut as in every situation it\u2019s the player that deserves the credit. They are the ones that apply what\u2019s being worked on. You are trying to guide them in a certain way and teach them. But it\u2019s having players that are open to learning and wanting to improve that is the key to their development.\u201d\nIt is clear why Southgate has stuck with Pickford, who will win his 50th cap in the quarter-final against France on Saturday, through some challenging moments. The head coach has never had cause to regret his decision to drop Joe Hart and name Pickford as his No 1 at the 2018 World Cup.\n\nPickford excelled during his first major tournament, brilliantly saving a penalty from Colombia\u2019s Carlos Bacca in the last 16 when England won a shootout for the first time in 22 years. He scored and saved a penalty against Switzerland when England secured third place in the Nations League in 2019. He went through wobbles at club level, losing his place at Everton during the 2020-21 season, but international football has always brought the best out of him.\nPressure does not seem to affect Pickford when he puts on an England shirt. He has faced criticism for his exuberance and slightly wild air in the past. Within the game, questions have been asked over whether he received the right level of coaching when he was younger. As one goalkeeping expert puts it, though, something happens to the 28-year-old during tournaments. His concentration levels, occasionally an issue during the week-to-week grind at Everton, go up. There is more maturity to his performances; a sense that he is not going to be the one who lets England down.\n\nThat was never more evident than when they reached the Euro 2020 final. Using a psychologist made Pickford calmer. He was more restrained, conceding twice in seven games, and was desperately unlucky to be on the losing side against Italy in the final after saving two penalties in the shootout.\n\u201cHe\u2019s been exceptional in the shootouts we\u2019ve had and that gives you confidence,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cSometimes, the biggest thing is dealing with being the England No 1. That comes with a different level of scrutiny. He\u2019s dealt with that impeccably.\u201d\nThe message was clear: Aaron Ramsdale and Nick Pope have it all to do to dislodge Pickford. Southgate\u2019s view is that England\u2019s World Cup hopes are in safe hands. No doubt Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, Olivier Giroud, Antoine Griezmann and Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 will test that belief on Saturday night, but Southgate will hope Pickford\u2019s saves that never were are a sign of things to come."

                    "body": "Manchester United will consider offers for Harry Maguire next summer, with Erik ten Hag intent on selling his captain to help fund a continuing overhaul of the squad. Maguire cost \u00a380m but the club realise they may have to accept a considerable loss to sell him. The news comes days before England\u2019s World Cup 2022 campaign begins in Qatar, where Maguire is expected to be a first choice for Gareth Southgate. However, the 29-year-old\u2019s stock has fallen considerably at United.  Having been made captain under Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, who signed him from Leicester in August 2019, he has started only one Premier League match under Ten Hag since being in the XI for the 2-1 loss to Brighton and 4-0 defeat at Brentford in the opening two matches, and is now in effect fourth-choice centre-back. Ten Hag\u2019s No 1 pairing is Rapha\u00ebl Varane and Lisandro Mart\u00ednez, and Victor Lindel\u00f6f was preferred to Maguire to partner Mart\u00ednez in Sunday\u2019s 3-1 Premier League reverse at Aston Villa in the absence of the injured Varane. Maguire signed a six-year contract that has an option to extend to 2026. The length of his deal, his salary of about \u00a3190,000 a week and his dramatic loss of form mean he may be hard to move on for a price anywhere near \u00a380m. Ten Hag admires the player\u2019s professionalism but views Maguire\u2019s sluggish pace as a problem and wants to sell him to add true competition for Varane and Mart\u00ednez and enhance the quality of the defence. The manager is also preparing to release Fred when the midfielder\u2019s contract expires in June. United have an option to extend his deal for another 12 months but this is not expected to be taken. Ten Hag has been impressed with Fred\u2019s application and team ethic but is keen to overhaul a midfield in which only Casemiro has proven to be a consistent top-class performer. Fred was signed by Jos\u00e9 Mourinho in 2018 for \u00a352m and the 29-year-old has been named in Brazil\u2019s World Cup squad."

                    "body": "When I was growing up, the World Cup always felt like the pinnacle of football. The sticker albums, the wallcharts, the opportunities to relive the greatest moments while having a kickabout with friends. Trying to replicate Ray Houghton\u2019s lofted strike against Italy in 1994; Dennis Bergkamp\u2019s ridiculous pull down and volley against Argentina in 98; or, for when you really didn\u2019t want to be in goal, David Seaman\u2019s desperate backwards flailing against Brazil in 2002. While I wasn\u2019t a bad player, the dawning realisation that I\u2019d never get close to doing it professionally didn\u2019t diminish my enthusiasm as a fan, or my interest in finding a career related to football. At university, I sat in the press box at Lincoln City covering matches, and eventually found myself working on one of the longest-running and most successful football video games \u2013 one I\u2019d played religiously from my early teens. As part of my job, I essentially get paid to watch and keep up to date with football. I love the stats, the tactics and seeing the next wonderkid become a household name. A World Cup is a brilliant time for the studio. There are matches on every TV in the office, a fantasy football competition and an incredibly convoluted sweepstake. Retro international shirts become the fashion style of choice and every meeting kicks off with conversations about the previous days\u2019 games. Outside work, I\u2019d usually watch matches with friends at the pub or arrange entire weekends committed to watching every single game, sometimes on multiple screens. We\u2019d have WhatsApp groups filled with messages, gifs and the latest hilarious meme. But from the beginning, Qatar 2022 felt different. Reading that 17 of 22 Fifa executive members involved in the vote on Qatar\u2019s hosting bid have since been banned or indicted over allegations of corruption cast a dark shadow. It gave me the same sense of helplessness I felt after hearing the lies about Brexit or the PPE VIP lanes during the pandemic. I hated the idea of being somehow complicit by supporting the World Cup \u2013 especially one that was reportedly built on the deaths of migrant workers. When I told my partner that I was considering boycotting the tournament, she said not to concentrate on whether it would make a difference, but to think about what would happen if everyone who felt this way did what I was willing to do. It may just have been that, due to having no interest, she wisely took advantage of an opening to stop lots of football being on TV, but regardless of her motives, I decided to boycott. I watched nothing \u2013 not even the highlights. I scrolled past social media posts and ignored match reports. Being able to work remotely made it easier to miss the games and the excitement building in our office. With my friends, there was a bit of head-scratching at first, but they accepted my decision. Yet I did feel that conversations seemed to tail off when I mentioned I wasn\u2019t watching, like they all felt a bit awkward about it. With my colleagues, I felt a bit embarrassed to admit what I was doing, given so much of what we do revolves around following top-level football. Now the World Cup is wrapping up, there\u2019s definitely an element of feeling as if I\u2019ve cut off my nose to spite my face. It wasn\u2019t so much England\u2019s journey that I minded missing, but the shocks of Saudi Arabia beating Argentina, Japan turning over Germany and Morocco\u2019s groundbreaking run. One of the hardest things was talking to my dad over the phone. As I\u2019m sure is the case with a lot of parents and their children, one of the main topics of conversation we have is sport. That shared experience was gone because of my choice, and I got the feeling he didn\u2019t really understand why I was doing it.  What difference can one person make? I\u2019m sure the BBC and ITV won\u2019t miss one viewer, and Fifa have already made millions selling TV rights for the North American World Cup in 2026. Yet I\u2019m proud that I stood by my principles, and would do so again. I wasn\u2019t completely starved of football. I could still watch Oxford\u2019s League One fixtures via iFollow. However, the less said about the camera work for their goal against Accrington the better. At least I missed England\u2019s draw against the USA and Harry Kane\u2019s penalty.

Forecasts for the major capitals show actual summery weather across the country, though Hobart will be the coldest capital city on Christmas Day at 21C. Darwin is tipped to be the hottest with 33C, while the mercury in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra, Adelaide and Perth should peak between 27C and 31C. And if you\u2019re keen on airing your views on Elon Musk\u2019s tenure at Twitter, the billionaire has a poll running asking users whether he should remain as head of the social platform. As of writing, more than 10m votes have been cast and just over 56% agreed that he should step down. Top news   Calls for tougher gun laws | The NSW government has echoed calls for improved national gun laws in the wake of last week\u2019s ambush at a remote Queensland property that left six people dead. \u201cWe thought that it would never happen again after Port Arthur. But if there\u2019s an opportunity to see something good come out of this, then it\u2019s tightening gun laws and seeing national reforms,\u201d the NSW treasurer, Matt Kean, said. Penny Wong to visit China | The foreign affairs minister\u2019s busy travel schedule continues with Wong set to fly to Beijing this week to mark the 50th anniversary of the establishment of ties between Australia and China. It\u2019s the latest sign that tensions with Australia\u2019s main trading partner are easing.    Australia\u2019s first offshore windfarm zone | \u2026 will be on Victoria\u2019s Gippsland coast, which environmental advocates have labelled a game-changer. \u201cIt is one of the most significant wind resources anywhere in the world,\u201d the premier, Daniel Andrews, said, referring to powerful winds from the Bass Strait. The projects are expected to support more than 3,000 jobs over the next 15 years in the development and construction phases and an extra 3,000 ongoing operation jobs. Dingo attacks child on Fraser Island | The attack happened Sunday afternoon, leaving the child, aged five, in hospital with multiple wounds. The dingo bit the child on the head, arm and buttocks, before his father intervened and stopped the attack.  Fatal house fire near Geelong | Two bodies have been found after a house fire in Lara, south-west of Melbourne. Emergency services were called about 4.45am this morning, and police have launched an investigation. Further south-west in Victoria, police are concerned for the welfare of a 50-year-old man and 37-year-old woman missing in the Grampians. The couple set off from Melbourne to go four-wheel driving on Friday. They were expected to return last night, in time to pick up their dogs from family, but never showed up.    World Cup reactions | Tears of joy in Buenos Aires, tears of pain in Paris, jubilation among Argentinian supporters at the Sydney Opera House. It was a rollercoaster that toyed with the hearts of Argentinians and French football fans all over the world. \u201cYou can\u2019t begrudge him. He is Messi,\u201d said one French fan in Paris. \u2018Explosion of billionaire wealth\u2019 in UK | Calls are mounting in the UK for a billionaire wealth tax after a new report showed the number of UK billionaires increasing by a fifth since the onset of the Covid pandemic. \u201cThe UK\u2019s record on wealth inequality is appalling, grossly unjust, and presents a real threat to our economy and to our society,\u201d said Jo Wittams, co-executive director of the Equality Trust.    Vatican returning Parthenon marbles to Greece | Pope Francis has ordered three 2,500-year-old pieces of the Parthenon be donated to the Greek Orthodox Church after sitting in the Vatican Museums for two centuries. The decision to not return them directly to the Greek state is widely seen as a way for the Vatican to avoid setting a precedent, as many First Nations groups and colonised countries around the world demand western museums return artefacts looted during colonisation.  Full Story  Australia and the climate crisis: what happened in 2022 and what\u2019s next? Labor has had a number of environmental priorities, from trying to slow the rapid decline of Australia\u2019s natural environment to seeking greater influence at international climate talks. But what are the challenges ahead in 2023? Listen to this 22-minute episode. What they said \u2026  *** \u201cIt is absolutely crazy that at the same time as we\u2019ve got world leaders talking about plans to restore nature \u2026. back home in Australia, we have governments that are allowing the destruction of our native forests, whether that\u2019s Victoria, New South Wales or Tasmania.\u201d \u2013 Sarah Hanson-Young The Greens senator was speaking on the sidelines of Cop15 in Montreal, where she urged Australian states to end native forest logging. Land clearing has seen crucial habitat for local species disappear, resulting in native animals such as the koala being placed on the national endangered list. In numbers  \u201cThere is a deforestation issue in Queensland,\u201d Vanessa Keogh, a project manager at WWF-Australia, said after the release of the latest state government data. Queensland is the worst offender in Australia when it comes to deforestation \u2013 it\u2019s no wonder the koala is endangered. Before bed read  Argentina\u2019s victory caps a scintillating World Cup tournament that weaved threads of excitement and heartache throughout. But the grandest tale of all from Qatar 2022 is Lionel Messi. \u201cThis was a Messi story in so many ways. Messi scored six goals at Qatar 2022 and won the Golden Ball as the best player. He toyed with some of the greatest footballers on earth. He did all this aged 35 and semi-injured. This is not normal. At some stage it will start to stretch the bounds of credibility.\u201d Barney Ronay writes a fitting finale from Doha.

                    "body": "\nMain event\nAnd then there were two! After one of the least predictable World Cups of all-time, we now have a final that won\u2019t surprise anyone \u2013 and what a final it should be.\nFear not, the Briefing knows its history and is extremely aware of how foolish a comment that is \u2013 and yet, and yet, and yet. In their semi-finals, both Argentina and France came up against teams with nous and organisation, but both found a way to impose their class while showing sufficient defensive perviousness to excite each other for the final.\n\nThe array of offensive talent, though, is only part of what makes Sunday\u2019s showcase so theoretically appealing. Ultimately, sport is a story, stories agitate the human psyche like nothing else, and this is a game leaden with narrative and meaning; with characters and themes.\nArgentina, already Copa Am\u00e9rica champions, are seeking to establish themselves as the finest international team on the planet. And should they win on Sunday, they will leave behind France and Uruguay, who sit on two World Cups, to tuck in behind Germany and Italy who have four, and Brazil, leading the way with five, as football\u2019s, fourth, er, \u2018winningest\u2019 nation. That\u2019s one thing.\n\nBut the other thing \u2013 a thing that\u2019s preoccupied us for the best part of a generation and has, to significant extent, defined this competition \u2013 is whether it will have the honour of being won by Lionel Messi. Whether he is the greatest player ever depends on your criteria \u2013 to the Briefing\u2019s mind Messi lacks the dangerous, intoxicating charisma of Diego Maradona at Mexico \u201886, where he played association football better than anyone before or since. But when it comes to sustained hand-over-mouth disbelief and involuntary shrieking of biological impossibilities, he\u2019s so far removed from everyone else it\u2019s hard not to wonder if he even exists. If Maradona did it like the devil, Messi plays like God.\nFrance, meanwhile, are seeking pure glory, and a place among the gallery of the immortals. Not since Brazil in 1962 has the most significant trophy in football been retained, and should they become the first side to achieve the feat in the modern era, they will rival both their own country\u2019s achievement of taking the 1998 World Cup followed by Euro 2000, and Spain\u2019s in harvesting three consecutive titles \u2013 two European Championships and one World Cup \u00ad\u2013 between 2008 and 2012.\nLike Argentina, they too have a player seeking what should be crowning glory of his career, aged just 23, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 will be planning on winning another and another and another. Not since Maradona has there been a player of such inestimable confidence \u2013 of such justifiable certainty in the ridiculous uniqueness of his own ability \u2013 and he will expect to be the final\u2019s decisive figure. But unlike Maradona, who was all bouncing edge, and Messi, still a shuffling, unassuming magician, Mbapp\u00e9 is playful, childlike; and no less a killer, a footballing angel of death.\nHowever, Argentina and France have reached this stage not because they have the best players \u2013 though they do \u2013 but because they are the best teams, and reducing a match with so many aspects to Messi v Mbapp\u00e9 is foolish \u2013 almost as foolish as predicting a classic. But that\u2019s football for you. Bring it on! DH\nTalking points\nMorocco fall short but they have been a creditWalid Regragui could not resist the temptation to risk those who had taken Morocco to the brink of history. But adrenaline and a sense of occasion proved no substitute for physical readiness. Nayef Aguerd could not even make it past the warmup, Romain Sa\u00efss signalled his thigh could not sustain him once he was burned off by Olivier Giroud. Noussair Mazraoui did not survive past half-time. All three had been on the doubtful list. Perhaps Regragui might have shown more faith in the depth of his squad. Once rejigged into a 4-3-3, Morocco matched France to have the defending champions looking to the clock and referee for respite. Sofyan Amrabat excelled in midfield, just as against Spain and Portugal. He has been a star, just as his team\u2019s run to the last four has been the most welcome story from Qatar\u2019s World Cup. JB\n\nArgentina fans add authenticity in QatarTo those out in Qatar, the sense of jamboree found in previous World Cups has been somewhat absent. That\u2019s perhaps a byproduct of holding a tournament in a super-city constructed in the middle of a desert, an infrastructure built for the automobile rather than pedestrian. It is also suggested the cost of accommodation has been deliberately prohibitive to prevent the flood of humanity that usually swells the population of host cities. Morocco and Saudi Arabia, as Arab nations, have bucked that trend, as have Argentina. The South Americans always travel in huge numbers, doing so amid disappointment in Russia four years ago and with Rio turning into an Argentine enclave prior to the 2014 final against Germany. While questions continue to be raised over just how full stadiums have been, Argentina\u2019s wash of blue and white has added authenticity to the tournament, as do those lengthy, wordy terrace anthems their fans perform. JB\nBeyond the football\nIt has been revealed that Friday\u2019s quarter-final between the Netherlands and Argentina was the scene of a further tragedy to accompany the loss of Grant Wahl. On the day Wahl\u2019s family announced an autopsy revealed an aortic aneurysm was the cause of the celebrated journalist\u2019s sudden death, it was revealed a Kenyan migrant worker, 24-year-old John Njue Kibue, died while working as a security guard.\nKibue fell from the eighth storey of the Lusail Stadium before dying after three days in intensive care, a witness telling the Guardian that Kibue had fallen from the highest point of the concourse close to gate 30 of the stadium. \u201cQatar\u2019s tournament organisers are investigating the circumstances leading to the fall as a matter of urgency,\u201d read a statement from Qatar\u2019s Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy.\nAnne Wanjiru, Kibue\u2019s sister, told the Standard newspaper in Nairobi that help and an explanation are yet to be forthcoming from either the Qatari authorities or Fifa. \u201cWe want answers on the circumstances of his death,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are claiming he was intoxicated. We hear he had worked for long hours. The clarity of how he fell is not coming out.\u201d JB\n\nGlobal media-watch\nNovi list made much of Novak Djokovic sending his congratulations to Croatia on Instagram, while it was good to see that the English media doesn\u2019t have a monopoly on bemoaning refereeing decisions in the wake of an untimely exit. Jutarnji list described Italian referee Daniele Orsato\u2019s decision to award a spot kick to Argentina as \u201cthe penalty that divided the whole world\u201d.\nAntonio Juricic, the web sports editor at Slobodna Dalmacija, was having none of it. \u201cLet\u2019s concentrate on the bronze, and not on the fact that we were victims again. Because we are not,\u201d he said in a piece which also argued that \u201cthere is nothing wrong with the fact that you lost playing the kind of football that brought you to the semi-finals of the World Cup, and there is no point in spreading negativity\u201d.\n\nReaction in Argentina was, of course, rather different. In the Buenos Aires Times, Dan Edwards asked: \u201cwho would bet against Argentina now?\u201d Edwards added: \u201cagainst all expectations Lionel Scaloni turned out to be an inspired choice, carrying out Argentina\u2019s much-needed regeneration with minimal pain and forging a team abundant in both individual talent and collective spirit.\u201d\nAmong the celebrations there was a bit of defensiveness. La Naci\u00f3n devoted a whole column by Juan Manuel Trenado that attempted to refute the notion that Argentina had been favoured by refereeing decisions throughout the tournament. Trenado said that \u201cthe 10 minutes of added time that Mateu Lahoz gave and that allowed the Netherlands to draw\u201d, among other things, showed Fifa was not guiding Argentina into the final. Clar\u00edn put it simplest of all on their sports pages with the headline: \u201cFor the third World Cup\u201d. MB\nThe internet reacts\nThis pitchside view of Lionel Messi only makes you have even more sympathy for young Josko Gvardiol. GB\n\nAnd finally \u2026\nFootball has changed a lot over the decades, but an eternal pleasure is that \u2013 unlike many other team sports \u2013 quality is not directly proportionate to athleticism and physicality. For that reason the schemer exists and, though contemporary footballing vernacular has moved on there will always be a place in the game for a deft, cunning, lithe, tough, little kid who sees things that others don\u2019t, directing the big kids around the pitch according to their whims. There have been few as scheming as Luka Modric who, at 37, is coming to the end of his World Cup career. Not only a great of his generation but a great of the game, Modric is near-enough the perfect midfielder, the brains and heart behind Croatia\u2019s stunning consistency; Saturday\u2019s third-place playoff is an opportunity for us to appreciate him while we still can.

                    "body": "Chinese state television has censored World Cup games to remove shots of maskless crowds after the sight of joyous fans celebrating in packed stadiums stoked anger back home, where hundreds of millions remain under strict pandemic restrictions. A well-attended opening ceremony in Qatar \u2013 with no social distancing \u2013 led to users of Chinese social media platforms complaining that it contrasted with the severe isolation they felt under President Xi Jinping\u2019s zero-Covid policy. Chinese netizens said it was \u201cweird\u201d to see hundreds of thousands of people gathering in a carnival-like atmosphere while they were still forced to live under a draconian system that most other countries have long abandoned.   The official Global Times newspaper acknowledged some fans were \u201cchoosing to watch the games at home with their families\u201d due to Covid restrictions under which people have been discouraged from gathering to watch the tournament. Mark Dreyer, who runs the China Sports Insider blog, noticed that games broadcast on the state-owned channel, China Central Television (CCTV), were being edited to avoid live shots of cheering crowds and instead show closeups of the players and coaches. \u201cOf course, there are going to be times when you still see crowd shots \u2013 wider shots, after some goals when a cutaway shot would be too jarring etc,\u201d Dreyer wrote on Twitter. \u201cBut there is clear reduction.\u201d Broadcasters at sporting tournaments are typically given the option by organisers to choose their own camera angles, and can set a delay so that the game can be edited quickly before the public sees it. Dreyer, the author of Sporting Superpower: An Insider\u2019s View on China\u2019s Quest to Be the Best, said such \u201cpre-emptive censorship\u201d was not a new policy for Beijing. \u201cChinese broadcasters are notoriously cautious of crowd shots at international sporting events because of what might be seen \u2013 like Tibetan flags, for example,\u201d he said. The Fifa World Cup has come at a particularly explosive time for China, just weeks after Xi secured a historic third term in power. Coronavirus case numbers have hit record highs, prompting yet more lockdowns in cities across the country. Beijing has defended its policy as life-saving and necessary to prevent overwhelming the healthcare system. But in the past few days, hundreds of demonstrators and police have clashed in Shanghai over the restrictions. Such a wave of civil disobedience has been rare in mainland China in the past decade, with Xi having cracked down on any public display of dissent."

                    "body": "The introduction of VAR at the World Cup in 2018 did nothing to dampen debate around crucial decisions, and this year\u2019s tournament in Qatar has been no different. Whether it was Antoine Griezmann\u2019s disallowed late equaliser against Tunisia for France, Argentina\u2019s VAR-awarded penalty after Wojciech Szcz\u0119sny appeared to gently brush Lionel Messi\u2019s face with his hand, or the lack of a penalty after England\u2019s Harry Maguire was wrestled to the floor against Iran, VAR\u2019s subjective calls remain a point of contention. But no decision has sparked more discussion than the award of Japan\u2019s second goal against Spain on Thursday evening, when \u2013 to the naked eye \u2013 it appeared that the ball had crossed the line and gone out of play. It ended up sealing Japan\u2019s qualification and in effect knockingGermany out of the tournament. What happened? Ao Tanaka scored in the 51st minute to make it 2-1 to Japan, following a cross by Kaoru Mitoma. But the question is whether the ball crossed the goalline for a Spain goal-kick first.  First of all, the laws of the game are quite clear:   A goal-kick is awarded when the whole of the ball passes over the goalline, on the ground or in the air, having last touched a player of the attacking team, and a goal is not scored.  So did the whole of the ball cross the line? In some pictures it appeared to be quite clear.  However, rather like faking pictures of giant rats with false perspective, where you take the picture from makes a difference as to whether the ball appears to have crossed the line or not. In this photograph, for example, you can see that the ball appears to be wholly over the line.  However, without moving the ball at all, if you take a photograph of the same scene from a higher angle, you can see that the whole of the ball has not crossed the line.  Or if you prefer it in Subbuteo format.  The new tracking technology in the ball, much-touted before the World Cup started, is used as part of the semi-automated offside system, and is not used to track when the ball is in play. The VAR officials ultimately instructed the referee, Victor Gomes of South Africa, to award the goal because they had seen an angle that showed that the ball had not wholly crossed the line. The slightest fraction of the curvature of the ball being above the line is sufficient for it to be deemed still in play.  They say World Cups are won on fine margins. There is perhaps none finer than this, regardless of how angry any television pundit gets about the decision."

                    "body": "England will face France in a World Cup on Saturday for the first time since 1982, when they prevailed 3-1 in the first group stage. They hold the upper hand in this fixture, winning 17 times to Les Bleus\u2019 nine, although 10 of those victories came before 1950. France have won five of the past eight encounters, England coming out on top once.\nThe match at Al Bayt Stadium offers a huge opportunity to improve that run: Didier Deschamps\u2019s world champions are in free-scoring form but have been ravaged by injuries and are unbalanced in some areas. Here is a look at the factors that may decide their fate.\nStrengths They have a significant one called Kylian Mbapp\u00e9. He can illuminate the dreariest of games in an instant, as he did by creating Olivier Giroud\u2019s opener against Poland when France were going nowhere fast and setting the platform for his own second-half masterclass. The on-pitch relationship between the two, muted at Russia 2018, is visibly growing; a front line completed by Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and Antoine Griezmann is beginning to show genuine cohesion. In midfield, Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni is an admirable replacement for N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9, covers the ground at both ends of the pitch and uses the ball efficiently. Another major plus is their experience of winning at this level. France have the composure and unruffled complexion of world champions and, when conditions become fraught, that tends to show.\n\nWeaknesses England should look to target France\u2019s susceptibility on the flanks. Their full-backs have not looked convincing, especially on the right where Jules Kound\u00e9 is being used in an unfamiliar role. A modest Poland side had joy going down the sides in the first half and Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 did not always give his Barcelona teammate much support. Theo Hernandez is sometimes left exposed on the other side by Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s attacking tunnel vision; Deschamps has reminded his superstar more than once about the need to fulfil defensive obligations. Elsewhere, the lack of a midfielder with the eye for a killer forward pass sometimes sticks out and even though Griezmann and Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 became more involved on Sunday they still have a habit of looking to build too many attacks directly through Mbapp\u00e9. More variation would come in useful against England. A lack of options from the bench, mainly owing to their injury list, may also prove critical if the game is long and tight.\nTactics \u201cGet it to Mbapp\u00e9\u201d is high on reward when it works. He will nominally play on the left side of their attack, with Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 on the right and Griezmann floating behind Giroud, although in practice he may roam where mood and opportunity carry him. Deschamps raised eyebrows before the tournament by announcing he would field a back four having used a back three for much of the time since Russia 2018; a meeting with England could be more conducive to the latter but he has no natural right wing-back. France may allow England possession for significant periods in the hope they can counter through Mbapp\u00e9 and Demb\u00e9l\u00e9. They will not play an especially intense pressing game from the front: Giroud simply does not have the legs for it.\n\nDanger men Have we mentioned Mbapp\u00e9 yet? He has been electric, five of his 33 international goals coming in this tournament. It is a racing certainty he will overtake Giroud\u2019s hard-won national scoring record of 52, set after Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s assist against Poland, over the next couple of years. In any other side Griezmann and Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 would be considered star turns; even as supporting acts, though, neither can be left unattended. Giroud\u2019s link-up play with all three is smart and he offers the bonus of a towering aerial threat, which comes in especially handy at set-pieces. Rapha\u00ebl Varane also poses a threat from those situations. Hernandez\u2019s attacking runs in support of Mbapp\u00e9 will require attention.\nCoach It takes a stretch to recall a time when Deschamps was not at the helm. He is 10 years in the job, becoming the second man to captain and manage a team to World Cup glory when France beat Croatia at Russia 2018. That does not insulate him from criticism: he came under heavy fire after the surprise exit to Switzerland at Euro 2020 and has, at various times, been accused of adopting an unnecessarily conservative approach. He proved the doubters wrong four years ago and can scent a repeat performance now. One of his most valuable achievements has been to instil a discipline and togetherness that, to put it lightly, has not always been taken for granted in France squads.\nMomentum There were fears Deschamps had stalled France\u2019s early progress when he rested nine of his key players for the final group game against Tunisia. They lost 1-0 and only made an impression when the cavalry arrived late on. But they were already through and Deschamps was adamant the benefits of a refreshed side would pay off handsomely. Against Poland, it started to, particularly during a second half when their opponents were barely given a kick. France have scored nine goals in the three matches their big guns have been wheeled out; Mbapp\u00e9 is in irresistible form and there were encouraging signs their attackers are on the same wavelength. The sense is that only a fresh set of injury setbacks could stifle their growing confidence before Saturday."

                    "body": "  5.27pm    Andy Hunter was there to see it in at the Khalifa International Stadium.       5.22pm    They won this one for the Bouba.        5.15pm    Here\u2019s the report from Group A\u2019s other game, from Jamie Jackson.       5.09pm    Senegal are motoring on, a job well done from them and the excellent Aliou Ciss\u00e9.      5.08pm    The Dutch top thee group, with Cody Gakpo continuing his form.  Here\u2019s the final standings.       5.01pm   Full-time: Ecuador 1-2 Senegal  A flush of second-half goals decided it in the favour of Senegal, who make the last 16 for the first time in 20 years. The African champions, even if they will be without Idrissa Gueye and Sadio Man\u00e9, are going to be tough opponents for England should they win Group B. Ecuador flop to the floor, the promise of the opening match long gone, with Enner Valencia unable to revive himself one last time. It was a match Piero Hincapie may wish to forget, too.      4.58pm    90-6 min: All down to this minute now, and whatever is added on to that. Senegal holding the line, and the ball is sent to the back post, where there\u2019s a collision. Sabaly takes an overhead kick to the face, and screams in pain. That will delay things\u2026but not for long\u2026.Senegal have done it.      4.56pm    90+5 min: Senegal make a sub. Dia off, and Cisse, a defender on. Caicedo shunts Dia off.      4.56pm    90+4 min: All Ecuador, piling forward. Mendy looks nervous on the launched ball. Perozo helps it on, and the ball goes beyond Hincapie.      4.54pm    90+3 min: Mendy flaps like a bird at that corner. He knocks it behind wholly unconvincingly.      4.53pm    90+2 min: Sarmiento skids on and Ecuador gain territory. They have to settle for a throw, and have a corner. Will the keeper come up? Not yet.      4.52pm    90 min: Senegal, even without Idrissa Gueye, and Sadio Man\u00e9 are not going to be easy to face for the winning team from Group B \u2013 likely England.  Only six minutes added on. Have Fifa lost their bottle on time added on? Had TV execs on the line?      4.51pm    88 min: Ecuador seem to have lost their patterns of play. And with Valencia a passenger, they don\u2019t seem to have much of a route to goal. Caicedo scored their first World Cup finals goal from someone other than Valencia since 2006.      4.48pm    86 min: Plata\u2019s free-kick towards the head of the new man is no good. Senegal are good in the air, and that is meat and drink for them.      4.47pm    85 min: Mendy has done a decent job in locking down that midfield and then plays a decent pass out to the right. Off goes Preciado, and on comes Porozo, a centre-half, who will form part of a defensive trio and then be a target for getting it launched.      4.45pm    84 min: Valencia springs into life, and has got beyond Diallo who runs across and clotheslines him. And yet Betty Turpin is not having it, and waves play on.      4.44pm    82 min: Dia gets chance to spin and shoot on goal, just wide. Another goal would do just fine for the nerves.      4.42pm    80 min: Into the crucial hours we go, plus added time. Senegal in 4-5-1, trying their best to hold off the attack of the Ecuadorians.      4.41pm    78 min: Senegal would like to lock it down, but they aren\u2019t being too successful. Feels like Ecuador have something more in them, if Valencia is probably not fit enough to be out there.      4.40pm    76 min: Nampalys Mendy of Leicester is one of the Senegalese subs who has just come on, with Bamba Dieng of Marseille. Their job now is to lock matters down.      4.38pm    75 min: Sarmiento, his Brighton colleague Caicedo having scored before, can only hit the ball straight at Mendy.      4.36pm    72 min: What a game this has turned into. Ecuador fans, in their bright colours, are in dark moods. Just two minutes and 30 seconds between goals. The same time was crucial in Cameroon v Serbia \u2013 twice over.   Updated at 4.40pm GMT    4.33pm   Goal! Ecuador 1-2 Senegal (Koulibaly, 70)  Wow, a free-kick from the right comes off Hincapie, and to the captain who jabs home. That one was for Bouba and Senegal are going through now!   Updated at 4.39pm GMT    4.31pm    69 min: AS IT STANDS: Ecuador are going through, and suddenly Senegal are playing hurry-up offence.   Updated at 4.34pm GMT    4.30pm   Goal! Ecuador 1-1 Senegal (Caicedo, 68)  And from nothing, a set piece. The ball is pinged in and Caicedo receives flick on, and the man on the line plays him onside. Feels like Eduoard Mendy\u2019s first job of the day is to pick the ball from the back of the net. Sabaly was the guilty party in not running from the line.   Updated at 4.32pm GMT    4.28pm    66 min: Idrissa Gueye is booked for clattering in. He\u2019s aghast, and that means he will miss the last-16 match. And that match was supposed to be his 100th cap. Oh no, he\u2019s a poor lad.      4.27pm    64 min: Reasco\u2019s first touch is to smash into Koulibaly with intent. Rather admirable bravery from the Newell\u2019s man.      4.26pm    63 min: Ecuador hurriedly clear a free-kick bombed into their box. Plata, after running into a Senegalese defender, falls to the floor.  Another Ecuador sub: off goes Estrada, and on comes Djorkaeff Reasco, whose dad played at the 2006 World Cup.      4.23pm    62 min: Sarr found offside, and there\u2019s not been to many of those, with both teams playing quite deep.      4.21pm    61 min: It\u2019s getting scrappy, and Senegal are taking their time over things. Double figures of time to be added on? It can\u2019t be ruled out. Idrissa Gueye whips in a free-kick that is cleared away.   Updated at 4.27pm GMT    4.21pm    59 min: Luke Jones asks: \u201cGiven all the issues about the OneLove armband, is there a reason Koulibaly can wear his own unique armband without any punishment?\u201d Not even Fifa could\u2026.could they?      4.19pm    58 min: The aforementioned Sarmiento continues to look dangerous and his cross causes problems for the Senegal defence.      4.18pm    57 min: Tony Mason is thinking ahead.  Hi John: Three options for the 2nd round for England.  We win the group and play Senegal. Having never lost to an African side that is the preference. We finish second and play the Dutch. The last time we played them in a WC it was 0-0 though Pearce scored directly from an indirect free-kick. (1990?) Wales win 4-0.      4.17pm    55 min: On Jeremy Sarmiento, from our player interactive.   Despite having Spanish and English nationality, Sarmiento has never renounced his Ecuadorian roots. The 20-year-old attacker may have worn the shirts of the Spanish and England teams when he was young but his heart was inclined towards the Tricolor flag. A video game lover, the Brighton winger made his debut for the Ecuador team in October 2021, in a qualifier against Bolivia. Before being called up to Ecuador\u2019s senior team, he had a bad experience at under-15 level, where the doors were closed to him. Despite that disappointment, Sarmiento never lost his ambition of playing for Ecuador.       4.14pm    53 min: Preciado, recovered from his first-half knock, makes progress down the right, and then gets the ball over. It\u2019s cleared but Ecuador are the better team at the moment.      4.13pm    51 min: Sabaly on the end of one, and falls a little heavily to the floor. The theatrics are in full flow now, this is no dress rehearsal.      4.12pm    50 min: Free-kick to Ecuador but it\u2019s launched into the Senegalese area, where there is plenty of muscle to deal with the ball.      4.11pm   Latest: Qatar 0-2 Netherlands  Frenkie de Jong\u2019s goal means it\u2019s all on this game for both teams. It always was, in truth.      4.09pm    48 min: Sarmiento pushing up for Ecuador who need to try and alter the momentum of a first half where they spent their time on the back foot.      4.09pm    46 min: Two Ecuador changes, who need to find a goal. Brighton\u2019s Sarmiento comes on with Alan Franco.       4.02pm    The emails have flooded in: Charles Antaki: \u201cI did wonder whether this would ever become relevant, somehow, in a game involving Ecuador: in Spanish, hincapie means something like emphatically putting your foot down. Not necessarily correctly.\u201d Joe Pearson: \u201cI learn something new every MBM. Now I know a little (very little) about the British soap opera Coronation Street.\u201d Richard Hirst: \u201cAs a Fulham supporter, your reference to a Papa Boupa Diop armband has clinched my support for Senegal. A legend: and surely an opportunity to show his goal against Man Utd\u2026..On my patent \u2018which team is doing better ometer\u2019, which takes attempts on and off target, plus corners minus fouls, Senegal are at 11 and Ecuador at minus 9. Seems pretty conclusive.\u201d John Johnson: \u201cAlso married crazy Ecuadorian woman. Still married. Still crazy. 32 years of crazy...\u201d Mark J van Raaij: \u201cHincapie wouldn\u2019t be the first Colombian Ecuador fielded...after Byron Castillo...\u201d     3.53pm   Half-time: Ecuador 0-1 Senegal  Ismaila Sarr is the man making the difference in winning then converting the penalty. Senegal are going through and Ecuador need to revive themselves in the same fashion they found against the Dutch.    Updated at 3.55pm GMT    3.51pm    45+5 min: Senegal continue to push on, though Sarr is down on the floor, having taken a kick to the inside of his knee.      3.50pm    45+3 min: There\u2019s some aggro here\u2026Sibaly and Valencia get involved and Valencia falls to the floor like he\u2019s been shot. Referee Clement \u201cBetty\u201d Turpin has seen it all before, and waves them on like schoolboys.      3.48pm    45+2 min: Senegal want another, with Sarr flushed with confidence. They also are slowing it down.  Updated at 3.48pm GMT    3.47pm    45+1 min: It is put to me that Sarr\u2019s celebration is to \u201cput his hands over his eyes and then his finger to his temple\u201d. Any ideas why out there?      3.46pm    45 min: What a blow to Ecuador, and Sarr was equal to the task. Five minutes is added on at the end of this half. The better team is ahead.      3.45pm   Goal! Ecuador 0-1 Senegal (Sarr, 44 pen)  There\u2019s a dispute over who will take, but it eventually falls to the Watford man. He\u2019s cool after a lengthy delay, in which Galindez plays for time. He steps up, gives it the eyebrows and sends it home. As is the way, all the subs join in the celeb.    Updated at 3.52pm GMT    3.43pm   Penalty to Senegal!  Sarr speeds through, and then Hincapie ploughs into him. The tell-tale wag of the finger shows he knows he is guilty. It\u2019s a stick on.   Updated at 3.47pm GMT    3.42pm    40 min: The Senegalese fans behind the dugouts are quite a sight to behold. That can\u2019t be making Gustavo Alfaro\u2019s job any easier. \u201cCompacto,\u201d he bellows. That means \u2018compact\u2019, we are told by the admirable ITV duo of Seb Hutchinson and Andros Townsend.      3.39pm    38 min: Nice play from Sabaly as he speeds from right back into the Ecuadorian box. There\u2019s panic stations before it\u2019s cleared. Caicedo goes down, under a challenge from Sarr and time will be taken.      3.37pm    37 min: Cis heads over from a free-kick dinked into the box. He really should have done better and his grimace reflects that.      3.36pm    35 min: A worry for Galindez as he has to slide across to save a scooped pass from the depths of the Senegalese defence.      3.35pm    33 min: Koulibaly steps ahead of a ball aimed at Estupinan on the left but Ecuador are looking far more calm now. Koulibaly, wearing an armband dedicated to Papa Bouba Diop, also clatters in Valencia\u2019s knee and that might be significant.       3.32pm    31 min: Senegal not quite finding the space they did in the early stages. Ecuador look to have calmed themselves down. That barrage of drums was probably quite a lot to deal with.   Updated at 3.42pm GMT    3.30pm    29 min: There\u2019s been a goal in the other game. Cody Gakpo has put the Dutch 1-0 up on Qatar. In many ways, that doesn\u2019t change Senegal and Ecuador\u2019s task for the evening       3.28pm    27 min: Koulibaly, who\u2019s not been kept too busy so far in the Senegal defence, comes across to block an Estrada shot.      3.26pm    25 min: \u201cIs Piero Hincapie by any chance related to George Hincapie, the US cyclist? I think we should be told,\u201d asks Richard Hirst. This lad? Seems unlikely. George\u2019s father was Colombian.   Updated at 3.27pm GMT    3.24pm    24 min: Ecuador continue to be pressed back but do seem to be a bit more organised. That said, Sarr cuts in from the left, and on his right foot bends the ball wide of the post.      3.22pm    22 min: Preciado will, er, press on.      3.22pm    20 min: Karl Gibbons gets in touch: \u201cAs much as ITV\u2019s coverage has been surprisingly good at this HRWC, it baffles me that they have gone with Netherlands v Qatar as the game of choice with, effectively, nothing riding on it. Thank goodness I have your good self to cover of the one that counts! Come on Ecuador! (Supporting them because my friend had to marry a crazy Ecuadorian for visa reasons and it all ended very acrimoniously. He went for a holiday and came back with a fianc\u00e9 \u2013 be careful kids!) Thanks for all the Guardian coverage to date \u2013 you guys rock!\u201d (It\u2019s on ITV4 and yes, ITV have been very good in this tournament.)     3.21pm    19 min: Preciado goes down under a Sarr foul, and looks in some pain. There\u2019s a possibility it\u2019s timewasting, but that\u2019s a lot of time to waste and refs are adding on any breaks in play. It looks like he\u2019s got a lower leg issue, and can\u2019t put weight on it.      3.19pm    18 min: Idrissa Gueye in his free role forces a corner, one that Galindez does well with, and sets up an attack, where Valencia leads the charge though runs out of support.      3.16pm    16 min: Aliou Cisse is off the bench and barking instructions. His tactics have been pretty useful so far, with Ecuador really struggling to live with Senegal.      3.15pm    15 min: Sarr, down the inside-left channel, a talented player, slots in Pape Gueye but the ball ends up with the Ecuadorian goalie.      3.14pm    13 min: Ndiaye, of Sheffield United no less, blams one wide.  Paul Haynes emails in: \u201cIs there an error on the team-sheet? Surely Senegal\u2019s number 24 Moustapha Name?\u201d This is They Think It\u2019s All Over, Paul.      3.11pm    11 min: Valencia goes for glory from distance, the shot comes out from his free-kick and he has another swing. When your eye\u2019s in, it\u2019s in. Though maybe not this time, and Senegal escape on the counter. Preciado has to smash behind. It\u2019s breathless stuff, knockout football before the knockouts.   Updated at 3.22pm GMT    3.10pm    10 min: Senegal\u2019s turn to wobble. A misplaced pass almost puts Valencia through. Gueye commits a foul, and needs to be careful; he\u2019s on a yellow.      3.09pm    9 min: Dia drags one wide, that Ecuador defence comes asunder once more after Idrissa Gueye skates through. An agonising miss.      3.08pm    8 min: Valencia gets a sniff and looks lively enough as Senegal\u2019s defenders seem to lose the ball in the stadium lights. The danger is cleared \u2013 just.      3.07pm    6 min: Senegal are the team on it here. They have to take advantage of this ascendancy.      3.05pm    4 min: Ecuador are playing a very high line and Galindez, their goalie has come out on safari to clear his lines. They look rather dodgy at the back, with full-backs pushed up. Have they not been reading Martin Belam\u2019s permutations?      3.04pm    3 min: Golden chance for Senegal. The ball finds itself at the feet of Idrissa Gueye, but his shot goes wide. The goal was gaping. Ecuador had gone to sleep.   Updated at 3.09pm GMT    3.03pm    2 min: The lineups suggest 4-3-3 for the Ecuadorians, and then 4-2-3-1 for Senegal. Has Valencia been patched up? His movement so far seems fluid enough.      3.01pm    1 min: This is the first time Ecuador have ever played an African team in the World Cup and they are greeted with the din of those Senegalese drums. Ecuador get it underway with some passing. They will want to keep it tight for the entire 90 minutes.      2.58pm    And here are the anthems, sung lustily by both teams. I shall refrain from reviewing the tunes, as that type of thing is all a bit unnecessary, and liable to cause offence.      2.54pm    Ok, the teams are in the tunnel, and making their way to the field of play at the Al Khalifa Stadium. Within 90 minutes plus probably plenty of change, the first of the last 16 will be known.  And remember, the teams from this group will face those qualifiers from England\u2019s group.      2.31pm    I met Enner Valencia eight years ago during a media event, and later wrote this.   It\u2019s September 2014 and West Ham United are holding a press launch for Club London, a corporate hospitality programme for the move into the Olympic Stadium in summer 2016. As is customary at such events, first-team players are wheeled out to speak to the media. New striker Enner Valencia, fresh from scoring against Liverpool in a 3-1 victory, has a huddle of reporters around him, and he gives his reasons for choosing to become a Hammer. \u201cI knew about West Ham mainly from watching films,\u201d he says through a translator. \u201cAnd I know the supporters were very passionate.\u201d \u201cWhich films?\u201d Two journalists ask the question at the same time. Valencia smiles, and the translator begins to look nervous. There is a pause. \u201cHe means \u2018Green Street,\u2019\u201d the translator says eventually. The room erupts with laughter. A corporate junket has gone wildly off-message. \u201cGreen Street,\u201d or \u201cGreen Street Hooligans,\u201d to use its American release title, is a film about a West Ham hooligan, named after the street on which the club\u2019s current home Upton Park sits. Jacob Steinberg was there, too.        2.23pm    Two more Ecuador changes to mention. Alan Franco and Carlos Gruezo come into midfield as Jackson Porozo is benched with Jhegson \u201cGary\u201d Mendez is suspended.     2.18pm    Matt Dony zings in: \u201cPathe is playing? That\u2019s news to me. Boom. I\u2019m here all week, try the alcohol-free Budweiser.\u201d      2.13pm    Have some Squires, too.       2.02pm    Enner Valencia does start for Ecuador, and has recovered sufficiently from a knee strain. He left the field injured towards the end of both games his team has played so far.  Senegal coach Aliou Cisse bolstered midfield with the inclusion of Pathe Ciss in place of striker Famara Diedhiou, leaving Boulaye Dia as the lone centre forward. Iliman Ndiaye and Ismaila Sarr provide width to an attack.     2.00pm   The teams  Ecuador: Galindez, Angelo Preciado, Torres, Hincapie, Estupinan, Franco, Gruezo, Caicedo, Plata, Estrada, Valencia. Subs: Arboleda, Cifuentes, Pacho, Ayrton Preciado, Ibarra, Ramirez, Arreaga, Mena, Sarmiento, Palacios, Dominguez, Reasco, Porozo, Rodriguez. Senegal: Edouard Mendy, Sabaly, Koulibaly, Jakobs, Diallo, Ciss, Pape Gueye, Ndiaye, Idrissa Gueye, Ismaila Sarr, Dia. Subs: Seny Dieng, Formose Mendy, Cisse, Nampalys Mendy, Jackson, Moussa N\u2019Diaye, Ballo-Toure, Diatta, Pape Sarr, Diedhiou, Ahmadou Dieng, Gomis, Name, Loum N\u2019Diaye.     1.46pm    Beyond the football, the real story of this World Cup.   The Supreme Committee has always maintained there have been only three work-related fatalities and 37 non-work-related deaths among migrant workers at World Cup stadiums since construction for the tournament began in 2014. In 2021 the Guardian published research that showed that more than 6,500 migrant workers from five countries \u2013 India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka \u2013 had died in Qatar between the start of 2011, the year after country won the right to host the World Cup, and 2020.       1.43pm    And the final round of matches mean it\u2019s time for the permutations.   The Netherlands: A draw will be enough against Qatar for Louis van Gaal\u2019s men to qualify. Ecuador: Ecuador need only a draw against Senegal to progress. Senegal: Senegal must beat Ecuador to overhaul them. Qatar are already eliminated, and there remains mathematical possibilities that Senegal could qualify with a draw, if the Netherlands suffer a heavy defeat against Qatar, but given the hosts\u2019 performances so far in this tournament it seems unlikely this will come into the equation. If both Ecuador and the Netherlands win, then the margin of victory and number of goals scored will determine who tops the group. If they both win by the same score on Tuesday, they will end up with identical records, and who finishes first will be determined by their disciplinary records. The Netherlands\u2019 is currently better, with one yellow card to Ecuador\u2019s three. If those end up level, Fifa draws lots to see who plays in which second round match.        1.39pm    There\u2019s three other big games today at the World Cup, though one in particular catches the eye. Read and sign up for Football Daily. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cThey get on that until 4am or 5am and watch all the great comments and enjoy all that sh1te, and it affects the sleep patterns. You\u2019re up until 5am looking at good comments, and the same people backing you are the ones killing you the day after. So just get rid of it, don\u2019t look at it\u201d \u2013 Australia coach Graham Arnold is warning his players over the perils of social media disgraces before their flamin\u2019 final group game against Denmark.   Updated at 1.39pm GMT    1.37pm    The Senegal coach, Aliou Ciss\u00e9, also spoke at length.   I come from a country where we don\u2019t like losing. We\u2019re always hungry for that win. Not going to the round of 16 would be difficult to digest. We\u2019re okay, we\u2019re dealing with the pressure and stress. For me, it\u2019s good stress. We understand that winning will allow us to continue on the adventure and that\u2019s exactly what we intend on doing. We know in 2018 we were looking for a draw when maybe the points would play in our favour but this isn\u2019t the case tomorrow. We\u2019ve got a very strong and experienced team, they\u2019re a well-oiled machine. We\u2019ve got the right mixture of veterans and players, players who are used to these types of challenges. On Enner Valencia: I hope he won\u2019t be playing tomorrow. I don\u2019t really know (Valencia) in particular but I can see that he is a warrior and he\u2019ll want to be part of the team for a game like this. I think the whole Ecuadorean team is a great team, they are very aggressive and they defend well. I know that my team will be focused tomorrow.      1.33pm    Ecuador coach Gustavo Alfaro spoke ahead of the match.   I\u2019m convinced we\u2019ve done everything we can, we\u2019ve done our homework, hopefully tomorrow we will be strong and fortunate enough against Senegal, who are a great team, and hopefully we will go through, because we deserve it. We respect the pecking order, but we don\u2019t need to be fearful. We remain calm but that doesn\u2019t mean we are overconfident, we are not triumphalist.  We have our own way of playing, we are not just thinking of getting a draw. We have to come to the pitch trying to win the game \u2026 We are creating our own pathway. We want to progress, we want to seal our passage, we want to play the best World Cup in Ecuadorean history.      1.30pm   Preamble  And now we enter sudden death, the final round of group games. Ecuador with Enner Valencia one of the stars so far, need a draw to make it to the last 16. Senegal, who found a cutting edge in beating Qatar on Friday, must win to go through. Neither can rely on Qatar to do many favours for them in the concurrent Group A game being played. And this was always like to be the key game for both teams, with Ecuador\u2019s draw with the Dutch lessening their jeopardy. There\u2019s been a worry over Valencia, the tournament\u2019s leading scorer with three goals for Ecuador, as he took a whack in the 1-1 draw with the Dutch, while Aliou Cisse will be hoping Boulaye Dia and Famara Diedhiou can continue the scoring touch they found against the host nation in a 3-1 win. Ecuador want to reach the last 16 for the second time, they reach there in 2006, losing to England. Senegal reached the quarter-finals in 2002, with Ciss\u00e9 at the heart of it all as captain. To follow on from that great team, and this year\u2019s model \u2013 sans Sadio Man\u00e9 \u2013 and their winning of the Africa Cup of Nations, only a win will do. Kick-off at 3pm UK time / 6pm Mecca/Doha time. Join me.  Updated at 1.31pm GMT "

                    "body": "The cult of the manager has hit new heights in Cameroon where Rigobert Song\u2019s face stares down from countless roadside billboards and no current national player comes remotely close to rivalling the coach\u2019s fame.\nSong certainly exuded a distinctive aura as, fashionably late, he swept into a media theatre in Doha on Wednesday evening. Dressed in a brilliant white tracksuit and with a similarly bright white baseball cap \u2013 complete with an outsize peak \u2013 crowning his trademark long black dreadlocks, he looked more like a rock star striding on to a stage than a typical football manager.\n\nAs the former Liverpool and West Ham defender outlined his hopes for the Indomitable Lions\u2019 opening group game against Switzerland on Thursday an apparently transfixed audience took the opportunity to capture endless pictures of Song and his trademark grey goatee beard on their mobile phones.\nUndeterred by Switzerland\u2019s position, 28 places above Cameroon in the Fifa rankings, he was in ebullient mood and suggested a surprise could be in store. \u201cSwitzerland will see our fire tomorrow,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t mind the rankings, they\u2019re just on paper. Who knew Saudi Arabia would beat Argentina? We\u2019re fully fit and focused. Our pedigree will be known tomorrow.\u201d\nPoor Samuel Oum Gouet, the 24-year-old midfielder with Belgium\u2019s Mechelen sitting alongside his manager, who barely got a word in edgeways. Indeed, when a journalist asked Gouet a rare question both manager and player burst out laughing.\nAfter the briefing drew to a close Song stepped down from the stage and stood patiently, exuding charm, as reporters and tournament officials queued to shake his hand, pose for selfies alongside him and have a little chat with a man who played in four World Cups.\n\nIt seemed hard to credit that there was a moment, six years ago, when it all stopped for Cameroon\u2019s manager. At the age of only 40 Song collapsed with a cerebral haemorrhage and remained in a coma for two days. When he emerged from it doctors at Yaound\u00e9\u2019s emergency hospital decided his brain aneurysm required specialist treatment in France and he spent the next six months in Paris recovering before returning to Cameroon and eventually resuming his coaching career later in 2017.\nFast forward to February this year, and a coach who spent the past five years working with the Cameroon Federation succeeded Ant\u00f3nio Concei\u00e7\u00e3o as head coach of the Indomitable Lions.\nAlthough Song\u2019s appointment came after an explicit order from Cameroon\u2019s president, Paul Biya, it seemed a watershed moment for a country who have imported a long line of foreign coaches \u2013 Concei\u00e7\u00e3o is Portuguese.\nSong\u2019s critics, and there are a few, may claim he lacks frontline managerial experience and is overly laid back for the role but the majority appear keen to offer Cameroon\u2019s most capped player the benefit of the doubt. Moreover, that outwardly relaxed demeanour does not, so far at least, seem incompatible with motivating players to hit new heights as they prepare to face not merely Switzerland but Serbia and Brazil in a tricky Group G.\n\nHigh pressing and attack-minded, particularly down the flanks, Cameroon have, partly thanks to Song\u2019s pulling power, developed a helpful habit of convincing dual nationals to choose to play for them. In opting to turn his back on France, the country of both his own and his mother\u2019s birth, the Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo typifies this trend.\n\u201cWe love music and we like dancing; it\u2019s unbelievable in our dressing room,\u201d says the former France youth international. \u201cIt\u2019s so much fun.\u201d\nWhile Mbeumo\u2019s attacking skills enhance Cameroon, their brightest talent lies in central midfield where Napoli\u2019s Andr\u00e9-Frank Zambo Anguissa has rediscovered the talent he apparently mislaid during an earlier stint with Fulham.\nPart of his brief is to help create goals for Karl Brilliant Toko Ekambi who, despite operating mainly wide on the left, has scored 38 goals in 108 games for Lyon and also registered five at this year\u2019s Africa Cup of Nations.\nTellingly Mbeumo was recruited over dinner in London by Samuel Eto\u2019o who had flown in specially from his west-central African home where, as head of Cameroon\u2019s football federation, the former Barcelona, Internazionale, Chelsea and Everton striker is now Song\u2019s boss.\n\u201cWe go to Qatar to win the World Cup,\u201d says Eto\u2019o, undaunted by Cameroon\u2019s record of having only once progressed from the tournament\u2019s group stage (at Italia 90 when they lost a quarter-final to Sir Bobby Robson\u2019s England after extra time). \u201cThe other teams don\u2019t have the same magic as us.\u201d\nAlthough Cameroon qualified for Qatar only by the skin of their teeth, narrowly beating Algeria in a playoff, Eto\u2019o has ramped up by the pressure on Song by suggesting an all African final is possible. \u201cWe haven\u2019t always shown our best face at World Cups,\u201d says a man rumoured to sometimes succumb to the temptation to interfere in the manager\u2019s squad selections. \u201cBut now African teams are ready. Cameroon will win the final against Morocco.\u201d\nAt leat Song seems fully on message. \u201cWe\u2019re on a mission,\u201d he said on Wednesday. \u201cAnd we know how to win.\u201d"

                    "body": "It is quite a ridiculous idea. To come to the World Cup, four years after making it to the final as one of the best underdog success stories in the tournament\u2019s history, thinking you could go one step further this time and win the whole thing. This is football after all, the No 1 global sport, not handball or water polo, the other two team sports at which Croatia are any good.\nIn those two sports the competition is much narrower and you also get a chance to win the world championship every year. It is not the Davis Cup either, which they have managed to win twice in the past 17 years, with two different generations of players.\n\nIf you are a small nation, the best you can normally hope for in football is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to play in the World Cup semi-finals or final. Many good teams from much bigger nations never get that opportunity, but here we are in 2022 with Croatia poised to play in their third semi-final in less than a quarter of a century. What\u2019s more, they are not satisfied yet.\n\n\u201cIn 2018 we wrote history, but now we want to repeat that,\u201d the captain, Luka Modric, told Marca after beating Brazil on penalties in the quarter-finals. \u201cI hope we can make that extra step this time.\u201d\nMateo Kovacic, his playmaking partner in midfield, was even more direct: \u201cWe came here wanting to stay until the end,\u201d he told HRT, the Croatian national broadcaster. \u201cThat was our goal from the start and nothing is done yet. We\u2019ll do our best to achieve even greater things.\u201d\nThey are all thinking it. The coach, Zlatko Dalic, has never got over the defeat against France in the 2018 final, always believing this team can do the impossible and convincing the players to share his belief. And now, having made it this far, they are ready to speak their minds: yes, they came here to win the World Cup.\n\nBut football, as we\u2019ve known it all our lives, doesn\u2019t work like that. Their success four years ago was already a freakish occurrence \u2013 never has such an outsider, the darkest of horses, reached the final, at least not in the modern age. The World Cup final is reserved for football superpowers and only those can hope for a second chance if they lose it. And yet Croatia, a nation of less than 4 million, is one step away from getting it.\nWhat is a football superpower these days, anyway? Is it Argentina, who lost 3-0 against Croatia in Russia four years ago? Is it France, whom Croatia defeated 1-0 in Saint-Denis just six months ago to finish top of their Nations League group? Brazil? Already home. Germany? Ditto. Given the results in recent years, maybe the Vatreni should now be considered \u2013 dare we say it? \u2013 a football superpower of our times.\n\nIf so, they are a very special one. They have now played six knockout games in the past two World Cup tournaments without winning any of them in 90 minutes. Four of those went to penalties and every time they emerged victorious from the shootout. Every single time their opponent first took the lead \u2013 including the 2-1 extra time win against England in the 2018 semi-finals \u2013 only to be followed by a Croatia comeback. In Qatar, they have beaten only Canada so far, and that was after going behind early in the game. They have scored only twice in their other four matches and yet they remain unbeaten, unlike Argentina or France.\nMaybe they can\u2019t beat you, but they will also make it very, very hard for you to beat them. And the Argentinians better not take the lead against Croatia \u2013 if they do, they could be in serious trouble.\n\nHow do they do it? That is the question everyone is asking, but no one yet has offered a legitimate answer. Where does this exceptional mental strength come from? There are many theories flying around, many of them dealing with the esoteric, and you are tempted to go with some of them until you realise they can only explain why they are good \u2013 but not why they are this good. After all, this is a nation where often the only thing that feels organised is crime, with domestic football and everything around it particularly corrupt, and yet these players somehow find the way to stay among the world\u2019s best.\n\u201cWe are built differently,\u201d tweeted Ivan Ljubicic, who won the 2005 Davis Cup with Croatia and later coached Roger Federer, after the Vatreni\u2019s win against Brazil. Yeah, let\u2019s go with that, the Croatians shrugged, it\u2019s an explanation as good as any.\nBecause the Vatreni and their fans are not looking for explanations. They are looking for two more wins."

                    "body": "From rugby\u2019s Bledisloe Cup to netball\u2019s Constellation Cup, matches between Australia and New Zealand tend to have a bit more fire than most. As the two nations opened their campaign at the Women\u2019s T20 World Cup, even the backdrop was dramatic: the mountains of Paarl rising up behind the ground and the sunset sensing the occasion, casting deep reds and oranges over Boland Park.  But while the scene was set for drama, the Australians appeared in the mood for a light-hearted romp, taking a dominant 97-run win over their trans-Tasman rivals, despite a batting performance that will have them asking some questions before the remainder of their pool games. Australia had well and truly earned their favourites tag going into the tournament, but a shock loss to Ireland in a warm-up game \u2013 even though they tinkered with their line-up and retired batters \u2013 gave New Zealand an inkling that there were weaknesses to attack. Snaring Beth Mooney for a duck in the first over only heightened their resolve, but from there Australia settled, with Alyssa Healy and Meg Lanning seeing out a 70-run partnership. It was a good, but not clinical, batting performance from Australia. While they kept the run rate up, wickets fell regularly after Lanning was dismissed and Megan Schutt and Darcie Brown \u2013 batting at 10 and 11 \u2013 looked almost surprised to find themselves out at the crease. It was a match that demonstrated the importance of depth within a squad, and even outside of it \u2013 Australia could have assembled a second team to challenge this World Cup, with players across the Women\u2019s Big Bash League knocking down the door of selection. Every wicket New Zealand took brought on another batter with just as much determination and belief. While Brown and Schutt rarely see the middle with bat in hand for Australia, they are more than capable. With the backing of their team, they kept the run rate ticking over until the final ball.  In contrast, after New Zealand lost both their experienced openers in Suzie Bates and Sophie Devine for ducks to Schutt in the first over, they looked rattled. The Black Ferns needed to slow their scoring rate to avoid losing more wickets, and from the start nothing was going their way. A controversial call from the third umpire cost them a third wicket when a ball looked to drop short of Brown in the field, but was judged to have been caught to cost Bernadine Bezuidenhout her wicket, just as she started to build momentum. The slow scoring rate left New Zealand with a mountain of work that looked as insurmountable as those looming over the ground. They left themselves with no choice but to take risks and Australia pounced on every opportunity. Only Bezuidenhout (14), Amelia Kerr (21) and Jess Kerr (10) managed to scratch their way to double figures as Ashleigh Gardner made up for a lacklustre batting performance by excelling with the ball, taking career best figures of 5-12 from her three overs. Despite the dominance that earned her player-of-the-match honours, Gardner took the performance in her stride, crediting the work of the entire bowling unit. \u201cI think we started exactly the way we wanted to with the ball and I was just lucky enough to take those wickets at the end,\u201d she said. New Zealand captain Devine was frank in her assessment of their performance. \u201cI thought we were really poor today in all facets of the game,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought Lea Tahuhu was great with the ball, Amelia Kerr was outstanding, and 170 was always going to be a tough chase. But the way we went about it, losing the early wickets, was always going to be hard work. Really disappointing, that\u2019s probably the only way to sum it up.\u201d New Zealand now have two days before they take on South Africa, while Australia march on to play Bangladesh in pursuit of a third consecutive T20 World Cup win."

Curran starred in England\u2019s successful T20 World Cup campaign this year, picking up the player of the tournament award after collecting 13 wickets, including a spell of three for 12 against Pakistan in the final. On a day of big spending at the IPL auction in Kerala, the all-rounder sparked a bidding war with Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals among the teams vying for his services before Punjab came out on top, agreeing a fee which eclipses the \u00a31.6m Rajasthan paid for the South Africa all-rounder Chris Morris in 2021.  \u201cHe\u2019s a world-class player,\u201d said the Punjab Kings team director Ness Wadia. \u201cHe\u2019d play in any world XI, in any of the top teams, he\u2019s that good. He\u2019s probably one of the best all-rounders in the world, if not the best.\u201d Harry Brook, player of the series in England\u2019s recent Test tour of Pakistan and another of England\u2019s World Cup winners, also commanded a seven-figure fee with Sunrisers Hyderabad paying \u00a31.3m. \u201cHe\u2019s young, he\u2019s exciting, he loves finishing games off and that\u2019s something that any team would want, said the Sunrisers head coach, Brian Lara. \u201cYes, it\u2019s his first IPL but he has played in Asian conditions, he loves Asian conditions, and I believe he\u2019s going to be one of the most valuable players in the future.\u201d The England Test captain, Ben Stokes, joins Chennai Super Kings for \u00a31.6m, where he will be teammates with Moeen Ali, who is among several England players to be retained by their franchises. Mark Wood, Jofra Archer, Liam Livingstone, Jonny Bairstow, David Willey and the England T20 captain, Jos Buttler, also remain with their 2022 teams. Lower down the scale there were also deals for more of England\u2019s T20 World Cup winners \u2013 opener and wicketkeeper Phil Salt (\u00a3200,000 to Delhi Capitals), spinner Adil Rashid (\u00a3200,000 to Sunrisers Hyderabad) and fast bowler Reece Topley (\u00a3190,000 to Royal Challengers Bangalore). Will Jacks, who made his Test debut in Pakistan, was also picked up by RCB for around \u00a3320,000. Joe Root was initially among those going unsold, though the former England captain did pick up a deal later in the team selection process, joining Buttler at Rajasthan Royals. But not every England player in the auction picked up a deal \u2013 Rehan Ahmed, the 18-year-old spinner who made such an impact on his debut for the Test side, went unsold, while Chris Jordan and Dawid Malan, both World Cup winners, also failed to find deals, as did Will Smeed, the 21-year-old Somerset batsman who recently gave up first-class cricket to concentrate solely on white-ball game."

                    "body": "Lionel Messi hailed the \u201cbeautiful\u201d bond between Argentina\u2019s players and fans after marking his 1,000th professional appearance with a peerless performance, which included a sublimely taken first goal, in the nervy win over Australia.\nArgentina\u2019s fixtures have resembled home matches in Qatar, their fans turning stadiums into pulsating cathedrals that inevitably break into full choral worship of Messi. But the entire team was serenaded long after full time even after a stop\u2011start performance, and Messi highlighted the power of a relationship that has appeared to grow with each game in this tournament.\n\n\u201cThe union and bond we have is something beautiful and it\u2019s what the national team should be,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable how they live every single match, how they transmit passion, energy and joy. We\u2019re thankful.\u201d\nMessi described the victory, made more difficult after Craig Goodwin\u2019s shot deflected in off Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez, as \u201ctaking another step forward, achieving another objective\u201d. Of Argentina\u2019s late jitters, he said: \u201cThat\u2019s the World Cup for you, the matches are difficult.\u201d\nThe Argentina manager, Lionel Scaloni, pointed to the turnaround of less than 72 hours between their group match with Poland and this assignment. He said his players would \u201csleep so late\u201d as a result of their excursions but described them as \u201cborn to play these games\u201d.\n\nScaloni looked ahead to the quarter-final against the Netherlands, which is a repeat of the countries\u2019 classic meeting at that stage in 1998. \u201cProbably they don\u2019t play as beautifully as previous Dutch teams, but they have strong points and weaknesses we will try to use,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be a beautiful game with two historic national teams. We hope we\u2019ll qualify.\u201d\nGraham Arnold was left to rue his underdogs\u2019 flirtation with a seismic shock. Had Garang Kuol not been foiled by Emi Mart\u00ednez with the game\u2019s final significant action, they would have completed a two-goal comeback and taken proceedings into extra time.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about making the nation proud and I\u2019m pretty sure we did that,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore we came here everyone said we\u2019re the worst Socceroos team ever to qualify for a World Cup and the worst Socceroos team ever. That\u2019s gone now. We\u2019ve done exceptionally well.\u201d\nNonetheless Arnold admitted a pang of regret. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the way I am but even though we\u2019ve been successful I feel like we failed tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cMaking the last 16 was not enough \u2013 I wanted more.\u201d\nArnold\u2019s contract is up and he would not be drawn on his future, focusing first on an imminent holiday. \u201cI haven\u2019t had any thoughts about it,\u201d he said. \u201cI need a break, I\u2019ll have a rest and no doubt I\u2019ll have good discussions with the organisation.\u201d"

                    "body": "As Morocco\u2019s Zakaria Aboukhlal prostrated himself on the manicured football pitch on Saturday after his side became the first African or Arab country to reach the semi-finals of a World Cup, the streets of London erupted in celebration as supporters basked in the Atlas Lions\u2019 historic triumph. On west London\u2019s Golborne Road, women wearing hijabs roared with jubilation as they raised their arms in the air with red and green Moroccan flags fluttering like sails behind them. Chants of \u201cOl\u00e9, ol\u00e9, ol\u00e9\u201d and the explosions of fireworks could be heard on Edgware Road, where traffic came to a standstill and even sub-zero temperatures could not stop ecstatic fans from taking to the streets to dance and sing. From Ladbroke Grove to the Damascus Gate in Jerusalem to Baghdad, Morocco\u2019s victory has been a collective cause to celebrate for the African, Arab and Amazigh diaspora. The triumph has brought joy to spectators around the world in the form of Moroccan matriarchs who have become the unofficial champions of the 2022 World Cup. Videos of the forward Sofiane Boufal dancing with his mother after Saturday\u2019s quarter-final victory against Portugal and the PSG defender Achraf Hakimi\u2019s mum giving him a kiss on the cheek after his winning penalty against Spain in the last 16 have garnered global adulation. Nadia Boujettef, a British-Moroccan local leader from north Kensington, helped co-organise a public match-watching event on Golborne Road on Saturday. As the daughter of Moroccan immigrants who helped found the first Moroccan community centre in the area, the 42-year-old said she was overjoyed to see women who looked like her mother \u201cat the forefront of everything\u201d. \u201cIt makes us proud,\u201d Boujettef said. \u201cOur parents, especially our mothers, they are the rock of a Moroccan family. \u201cThey came here in the late 50s and 60s. English was a barrier, but they integrated, and they built north Kensington.\u201d Some of the volunteers brought together former Grenfell Tower residents, as well as people in the area who had no connection to Morocco. \u201cWe were all Moroccan [for the game],\u201d Boujettef added.  Revelling in the euphoric glow of Morocco\u2019s latest victory, British-Moroccan fan Hashim Wahbi, whose parents are of Moroccan origin, celebrated on Sunday by marching through Piccadilly Circus dressed in the national team\u2019s football kit while beating a drum. Although Wahbi had spent many holidays in Morocco as a child, he felt disconnected from particular aspects of the country\u2019s culture as a member of the diaspora. It was the national team\u2019s victory that renewed his pride in his Moroccan heritage. \u201cIt brought my Moroccan identity to the forefront,\u201d said the 29-year-old.  After their victory over Spain on Tuesday, social media was replete with historical jokes claiming \u201cthe winner gets al-Andalus\u201d \u2013 the name given to the formerly Muslim-ruled area of Spain from which many Muslims and Jews were expelled about 500 years ago and fled to Morocco. \u201cI think it\u2019s kind of reconnected me again to the Moroccan community online,\u201d Wahbi said.  As concerns have simmered recently over an increasingly rightwing Israeli government and its treatment of Palestinians, the Qatar World Cup has in its own way been eclipsed by the black, white, red and green Palestinian flag on its football pitches. While celebrating their historic win over Portugal yesterday, a Moroccan player unfurled a Palestinian flag. Several videos of English football fans humorously chanting \u201cFree Palestine\u201d in Arabic have also gone viral. \u201cIt\u2019s been really lovely that the support for Palestinians and the Palestinian flag has been at the forefront of this Moroccan story,\u201d Wahbi added.  Wahbi, who has a young mixed-race daughter, said Morocco\u2019s victory was especially important to him as a father. She has been a spectator of the matches along with the rest of the family. \u201cI feel it\u2019s important to celebrate Moroccan culture and achievements,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I hope it remains part of her identity when she grows.\u201d"

Then, softly and with little intonation, he explained that emotions in the Denmark camp are running \u201cvery, very high\u201d.\n\u201cIt is a World Cup,\u201d he said. \u201cWith football you can multiply your feelings by 10, and the fear of losing is very, very much involved. How can we best handle that? These considerations you have to make.\u201d\nThese are considerations Hjulmand is making right now \u2013 or perhaps has made already, in the days since Saturday\u2019s 2-1 loss to France left his team contemplating an imminent exit from a group they were anticipated to roll through with no fuss.\n\nOn pre-tournament form, which included two Nations League wins over Didier Deschamps\u2019 World Cup holders, they might have even advanced in top spot. Now a place in the last 16 requires at the very least a win on Wednesday over Australia, the 38th-ranked nation sitting above them in second, and also a prayer that Tunisia do not simultaneously upset already-qualified France.\n\u201cOf course there\u2019s pressure,\u201d Hjulmand says. \u201cBut we are very solid and a very good group. We are never alone \u2013 we do things together. We win, we lose, we fight \u2026 but we are together. I think the best way to focus on what we have to do is prepare just like normal. These players are very, very used to big games.\u201d\nHjulmand, in his half-hour media conference on Tuesday, expressed the whole gamut of emotions, all in that dispassionate voice \u2013 the sound of stability amid the uncertainty. One minute he is discussing the pressure of an expectant nation barely 18 months after they almost went all the way at Euro 2020, and the next \u201csolving a football-related task\u201d against an Australian side he expects to \u201cattack and run at us\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt will be a surprise for me if that doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d he continued. \u201cLike all football games, there will be times where we have to [solve a task], to break down a very strong defensive unit.\u201d\nDespite his even temperament Hjulmand is surely not unaffected by the wobble in Qatar, the place of Christian Eriksen\u2019s second coming which quickly morphed into a tit-for-tat over human rights statements and a scoreless draw with unheralded Tunisia.\nBut he does not bite on a question about the OneLove armbands fiasco he had lamented only a week ago was a distraction. \u201cWe\u2019re focused and we are ready,\u201d he simply said. \u201cRight now we are totally focused on this, we don\u2019t have any other thoughts.\u201d\nFrom a personnel perspective, Hjulmand declared no fitness concerns but also revealed nothing in terms of lineup or tactical approach, apart from the fact Jesper Lindstr\u00f8m sat next to him.\nInstead he spoke about the collective. \u201cThe more experience you have of these kinds of events, from maybe feeling the pressure, [the more] you feel pride,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a dream since you were a kid and now you are actually in a position where you can go out and play football for something. It is privilege.\u201d"

                    "body": "From the Beijing Winter Olympics to the Saudi-funded LIV golf tournament, 2022 has already offered ample evidence of the value of sportswashing to states with a global image problem. The forthcoming football World Cup in Qatar, now only five months away, will complete a hat-trick of events designed to augment the soft power of authoritarian regimes. The decision to award World Cup hosting rights to a searingly hot Gulf state with a poor human rights record provoked widespread bafflement, suspicion and dismay. Last November, the US Department of Justice alleged that officials working for world football\u2019s governing body, Fifa, had been bribed ahead of the decisive vote in 2010. But since then the global spotlight on Qatar has provided an opportunity for human rights campaigners. Lobbying on behalf of a vast migrant labour force, which has historically been subjected to brutally exploitative practices, has yielded tangible results. A minimum wage has been introduced, albeit at a very low rate. The abusive kafala system \u2013 which tied workers to a single employer \u2013 has been largely dismantled, and in most cases exit permits are no longer required to leave the country. This is obviously welcome progress. But there is a long way to go before the rights of a mainly south Asian workforce, from some of the world\u2019s poorest countries, are properly safeguarded. The Guardian has reported since 2013 on the need for action to protect migrant workers supplying the labour that fuels the ambitious \u201cnation-building\u201d programmes of Qatar and its neighbouring states. According to analysis published last year, thousands have died in Qatar since 2010. A minority were directly involved in the construction of new stadiums. Many more will have been employed in an unprecedented building programme including a new airport, public transport systems and hotels. Unexpected deaths of previously healthy young men remain unexplained or attributed to natural causes. An Amnesty International report published in April found that some migrant workers were subjected to conditions that amounted to forced labour, with illegally long hours in intense heat and no time off. Other investigations have highlighted wage abuses, with some workers going unpaid for five months. Britain\u2019s two largest unions, Unite and Unison, have joined Amnesty and Human Rights Watch to call on Gareth Southgate\u2019s England team to publicly back two proposals to boost migrant workers\u2019 rights in Qatar. The first is for a migrant workers\u2019 centre to be established, which would offer advice, support and representation in a country where joining a union is still illegal. The second regards compensation for relatives of the labourers who died while employed in the massive public works projects. Amnesty and a coalition of other human rights organisations and fan groups have suggested that Fifa put aside $440m for that purpose \u2013 an equivalent amount to the World Cup prize money on offer. With profits anticipated to top $7bn, that does not seem too much to ask. In his remarkable \u201cDear England\u201d letter, written before last summer\u2019s Euro 2020 football tournament, Mr Southgate wrote that he and his players had a duty to use their profile and platform to \u201cput debates on the table, raise awareness and educate\u201d. On issues such as anti-racism they have done this to great effect. The team\u2019s captain, Harry Kane, has indicated that discussions are taking place among players over taking a collective stand on human rights issues in Qatar. They and the FA should follow their counterparts in the Netherlands and Denmark and give their backing to these proposals. A positive legacy can still emerge from a controversial World Cup. \u2022 This article was amended on 19 June 2022 to make clear it was Amnesty that suggested Fifa put aside $440m. We had earlier erroneously said that it was Fifpro, the professional players\u2019 organisation, that made the suggestion."

                    "body": "Martin Boyle will miss the entire World Cup, in a major blow to the Socceroos\u2019 attacking arsenal two days out from their first match against France. The Scotland-born winger has been in significant doubt since arriving in camp at the start of this week, having injured his knee playing for Hibernian three weeks ago and only managed light training in Qatar separate from the rest of the squad.  Marco Tilio was flown in from Australia on Tuesday, ready to be drafted as cover should the time come for manager Graham Arnold to make the tough call. Under Fifa regulations, Arnold had until Monday evening at 10pm \u2013 24 hours before they run out against France at the Al Janoub Stadium \u2013 to cut a player for medical reasons and name an injury replacement. But Boyle did not pass a key fitness test on Saturday, prompting the early decision in favour of certainty for him, Tilio and the rest of the playing group. It means Boyle is yet to represent his adopted country at a major tournament, having also been ruled out just days before the 2019 Asian Cup in the United Arab Emirates after picking up a knee injury during a warm-up friendly against Oman. \u201cNot really sure I can put this into words how gutted I am to withdraw from the World Cup squad,\u201d Boyle posted on Instagram. \u201cGave it my all to be fit and it just wasn\u2019t to be this time unfortunately. Extremely proud to have been selected and to have played my part in qualifying for the tournament. \u201cGrateful to be kept in camp and show my full support to the lads on and off the field and to experience the whole World Cup. Will no doubt be back stronger than ever but for now my full focus is on being the vibe manager for the lads.\u201d Arnold said Boyle had been selected in the knowledge he was only a 20% chance of playing. \u201cBut we had to give him every last chance to try and get fit, especially because of the sacrifices and everything he\u2019s made through the whole [qualifying] campaign,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cThe medical staff have done everything they possibly can. Yesterday was pretty much the last chance, and he didn\u2019t come through well.  \u201cTilio has integrated really well. I called him [upon naming the squad] to tell him he wasn\u2019t part of the 26 but at the same time he was on standby. Melbourne City have been fantastic, releasing him to come across and train.\u201d Tilio, 21, was a notable omission when Australia\u2019s World Cup squad was announced last week, having been considered on the cusp but lacking consistent form and minutes for City. It was better news for Ajdin Hrustic, the Hellas Verona playmaker and Socceroos X-factor who had also been training separately but was ultimately declared fit and appeared with the main squad on Sunday, though back-up goalkeeper Danny Vukovic was missing with apparent calf tightness. \u201cAjdin\u2019s fine,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cAjdin is capable of playing against France. He won\u2019t start against France, but he\u2019s capable of coming off the bench and having an impact.\u201d Arnold said it was all systems go for tall defender Harry Souttar, who has been sidelined for 12 months after rupturing his anterior cruciate ligament and only played his first match back for Stoke on 8 November. \u201cEveryone else is ready for selection on the first game,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the training sessions we\u2019ve been working a lot on 11 v 11, getting the rhythm right and the communication and connection, and Harry\u2019s looked excellent.\u201d It follows news that France\u2019s injury woes have deepened, with Ballon d\u2019Or winner Karim Benzema to miss the whole tournament with a thigh injury sustained during training in Doha. Didier Deschamps is already already without Paul Pogba and N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 for Les Bleus\u2019 title defence."

                    "body": "England\u2019s progress in the World Cup could drive up the number of Covid cases across the country this winter, scientists have warned. Researchers say that mass gatherings in pubs, and in homes where friends and relatives get together to watch the team compete in Qatar, could lead to a rise in infections. They point out the effect that the Euro 2020 competition had. \u201cIt was a much bigger event in terms of mixing people and spreading the virus than the celebrations we had at Christmas that year,\u201d said Professor Christophe Fraser, an epidemiologist at Oxford University. \u201cThat suggests that a key factor in influencing infection rates this year will be England\u2019s performance during the World Cup.\u201d People who go to large gatherings to watch matches \u2013 including England\u2019s game against Senegal on Sunday evening \u2013 and then plan to visit an elderly or immunocompromised relative later should be careful to take a lateral flow test beforehand, he advised. They should also take up all offers of a vaccine. He added: \u201cWe are in a much better position than we were two years ago, of course. Vaccines have made sure of that and there is no reason that people should not enjoy the World Cup. I intend to do so.\u201d According to the most recent data from the Office for National Statistics, cases across the UK topped 1 million for the first time since mid-October \u2013 although they showed a decrease in Wales, while trends were uncertain in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Such numbers are still well below levels seen earlier in the year, when infections climbed to nearly 4 million in July and just under 5 million in March. Nevertheless, scientists warn there is potential for a jump in cases this winter. \u201cWe are in a triple dynamic of infections,\u201d said immunologist Sheena Cruickshank of Manchester University. \u201cWe have Covid, we have respiratory syncytial virus \u2013 RSV \u2013 and we have influenza. \u201cAt the same time, we are seeing increases in hospitalisations for all three of these diseases. For good measure, none of them are at the point of peaking. It is a worry, especially as we know how stretched the NHS is.\u201d  The problem was compounded because so many people were not getting vaccinated, Cruickshank added. \u201cFor example, the fact that only 54% of people aged between 50 and 64 years have taken the offer of a booster is worrying. That means we have the potential for a lot of waning immunity in a lot of people.\u201d People should think twice about going to parties; consider involving themselves in more outdoor activities; wear masks whenever appropriate and have a vaccine whenever offered one, she added. Health experts have also warned that since the easing of Covid restrictions in the UK there have been more opportunities for other infections to spread. An example is provided by rises in numbers of strep A bacterium cases which have led to the deaths of six youngsters. Reduced mixing among children over the past two years may have caused a drop in population-wide immunity, resulting in a rise in transmission. Parents have been advised to keep a close watch out for symptoms that include pain when swallowing, fever and red and swollen tonsils."

If you want high-quality performance in a World Cup you think could they have managed it slightly differently.\n\u201cIt\u2019s also the same for the other team, I have to say that. But we\u2019ve got almost no time to let it all sink in. It\u2019s recovery, recovery and getting their brains ready again for that challenge.\u201d\n\nBoth teams played their three group matches four days apart as part of Qatar 2022\u2019s condensed timetable of 29 days \u2013 three fewer than were used to stage the 2018 tournament and in Brazil four years earlier.\nThe regular 32-day schedule with five weekends was not available because of the compromise Fifa made with European leagues and clubs when it dropped the tournament into the middle of their domestic seasons to avoid Qatar\u2019s oppressive summer heat.\nThe unusual November-December slot also means clubs did not release their players until a week before the first match, a significant decrease from the extended preparation previously afforded to national teams.\n\nIn 2018, Australia had members of its squad in a pre-tournament camp in Turkey more than a month before the tournament and then made the short flight to Russia five days before their first fixture against France.\nThis time around, some had played for their clubs less than seven days before their opening World Cup fixtures. The unique circumstances prompted the international players\u2019 union, Fifpro, to warn the accumulated workload \u2013 along with the hot conditions \u2013 created an unprecedented injury risk.\n\u201cIt\u2019s something Fifa needs to consider, that we\u2019re not robots, that we are humans and that we do need to recover,\u201d said the Socceroos defender Milos Degenek. \u201cThat we can\u2019t just play day after day. And not just me, [it\u2019s] especially the boys who played three in a row, they have a short turnaround now again.\u201d\nScaloni, too, was critical after Wednesday\u2019s late-night win, which confirmed Argentina\u2019s progression as winners of Group C and set up the date with Australia \u2013 Group D\u2019s runners-up.\n\u201cToday we are happy but not euphoric, because it\u2019s crazy we are playing in just over two days,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t really understand this. It\u2019s almost 1am, tomorrow is Thursday. We could have had more rest.\n\u201cI want to make it clear that it doesn\u2019t seem right to me that we have just two and a half days of rest after being first in the group. These conditions aren\u2019t great.\u201d"

When the Qatar World Cup was rescheduled from the summer, she had concerns about the impact on female fans of watching evening games in pubs.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest things that I\u2019ve had to deal with as a manager of a grassroots club is the change in season,\u201d Drucquer said. \u201cWhen the lights go off we have so many issues with where we play and train. When it gets dark it\u2019s a very, very different situation. We\u2019ve had abuse when we\u2019ve been playing in the dark.\n\u201cWe know, as women, that we have to think about our journey to the courts quite differently. We know that we must avoid taking certain routes to protect our safety. When I was working out where we were going to play throughout the winter this year, I realised that there is going to be an issue for anyone who wants to watch the World Cup as well, because so many of the games are going to be played when it gets dark.\u201d\nAccording to research carried out in the UK by the End Violence Against Women campaign, one in two women feel unsafe walking alone after dark in a quiet street near their home, compared with one in seven men; one in two women feel unsafe walking alone after dark in a busy public place, compared with one in five men; and two out of three women aged 16 to 34 had experienced a form of harassment in the previous 12 months \u2013 with 44% of women aged 16 to 34 having experienced catcalls, whistles, unwanted sexual comments or jokes, and 29% having felt they were being followed.\n\nThis Fan Girl, which aims to create a space for women and non-binary people to connect with football and organises meet-ups for them to watch football together safely, has launched a charter for pubs to sign up to.\nIncluded in the charter are commitments to demonstrate they are welcome to all fans on their websites and social media channels; to provide the option to book tables before games and to consider table service, or the sale of beer buckets, to limit bar trips; to clearly display a code of conduct and ensure it is understood by all staff; to ensure complaints are taken seriously and to use de-escalation methods (switching on lights, playing music, serving water) at full time to prevent aggressive behaviour. Pubs that sign up are listed on the This Fan Girl pub finder.\n\u201cEveryone that\u2019s been working in football for the last year or so has been conflicted about this tournament for a lot of reasons,\u201d said Drucquer. \u201cBut a lot still are getting excited about it. So as much as in a perfect world it wouldn\u2019t be where it is, the reality is it is still going to get shown and it\u2019s going to be enjoyed by people around the world and we want to provide support for those that are going to be watching it.\u201d\nThis Fan Girl has also teamed up with the safety app Help Me Angela to provide free support for women travelling to and from pubs to watch the World Cup.\n\u201cPubs can only go so far; they can\u2019t necessarily help you on the walk there or back,\u201d said Drucquer. \u201cWe\u2019ll be posting a code that will provide free access to some unreal features like location or getting connected with a \u2018guardian angel\u2019, people that walk you home or talk to you on the trip.\u201d"

                    "body": "Always leave them wanting more. Fat chance. Nobody has ever really wanted much more of an England football manager. Such is the basic nature of the job, from the early embrace to the howls and bellows of the extended endgame; to be England manager is to act as a kind of public outrage service, a witch-dunking, a burning of the waistcoated wicker man. Come here to wail and froth about the state of England. In bad times and \u2013 it turns out \u2013 in good ones, too.\nBy now there are really only two ways out of this thing. Exit in a haze of well-earned abuse; or exit in a haze of undeserved abuse. With England\u2019s World Cup exit stamped and processed Gareth Southgate does at least have the option right now to take the second of these.\nAnd it may yet come to pass. Departure on his own terms, without the need to regather his internal energies for Germany 2024 or to return to a Wembley Stadium where he was jeered three months ago might just come to seem a bit more attractive.\n\nFrankly, who could blame him? The past six years have been a genuinely impressive body of work. This is the best England team of the last half\u2011century. Neither of these facts is contestable on the actual evidence. And yet the abuse of Southgate, the dismissal of his work, of his patience and good sense in the role, is by now verging on the bizarre.\nFair enough from the general public, who can say whatever they like about this stuff. But it is something to be regretted from those within the media who have simply taken an opportunity to play to the gallery or to grind a personal axe, adding another cynical and divisive note to the public discourse.\nWho could blame England\u2019s manager if he walks away from this? At times it feels as though the question is not whether Southgate deserves to continue as England manager, but whether English football, or at least its perpetually enraged periphery, deserves to keep him.\n\nSouthgate looked pretty calm on Saturday night inside the plasticised catacombs of Al Bayt Stadium, venue for England\u2019s energetic and engaging last stand at Qatar 2022. There was no snippiness, no signs of exhaustion or desperation. He looked, frankly, OK with things.\nAs he should. Defeat in Al Khor was that rare thing, a largely blameless exit. This was a close game against marginally superior opponents; and for the neutral an exhilarating World Cup spectacle. \nThis will disappoint those who wish to find outrage, the betrayal of Albion and all the rest, who will reflexively demand an inquest (an inquest requires a corpse: nothing died here). \nFrance did not play well. As L\u2019\u00c9quipe put it, they performed below themselves. But the brain of the team was enough to drag them through.\nThey survived England\u2019s better periods, were able to respond and fight back because they basically have very good players in every position, a squad that combines athleticism, technique and game intelligence to a rare degree.\n\nThis is no accident. France are the dominant football power of the last quarter\u2011century. France have contested five of the past 12 World Cup and European Championship finals, have the best player in the world and have the best academy system. Sometimes you just have to accept that you are simply a chapter heading, that there is someone else in the room with a greater Main Character Energy.\nGood points for England: they had a well-worked plan for Kylian Mbapp\u00e9. They came on stronger and dominated midfield in the second half, a complete reversal of the pattern of recent tournaments, and a note of progress that deserves praise. Their best player skied a penalty that would have deservedly forced extra-time. Only the most committed negative take \u2013 the Southgate truthers, the Anti\u2011Gaxxers, those for whom anything but uncontested English success is a perversion of the natural order \u2013 could find any glaring issues with the details here.\nThere were, of course, parts that could be finessed. Perhaps Southgate should even have obeyed his more cautious long\u2011term instincts and sought the control of a back three. Did he listen to the voices? Never, ever listen to the voices.\nWas Jordan Henderson really ready to start so many games in a short period of time? J\u00fcrgen Klopp has him on strict rotation at Liverpool. \nPhil Foden might have come off a little earlier when it was clear this was not his night. Bringing on Raheem Sterling was outright mistaken loyalty. Sterling had not trained. Others had.\nAnd yet \u2026 This is small beer. It is not necessary to study football history (although for some, it seems, it might help) to put this in context. With the defeats by Germany, Iceland, Uruguay and Italy there was a sense of system that had lost the run of itself, of incoherence from the top down. This is not that same thing. England is now a functioning machine, an entity with substance, leadership, internal communication, a way of playing and being. This has been to a great extent Southgate\u2019s work. It feeds directly into England\u2019s coherence, the sense of a happy unit. Legacy isn\u2019t always just pots.\nSo why would he leave now? Partly because there is always a moment to leave and six years is a long time. Plus for all the negativity, it would be an unconditionally honourable discharge at this stage. Look back across the names, the ageing mugshots and the fact is only three people have ever really succeeded in this job.\nAlf Ramsey won a World Cup. Terry Venables had a good Euros then left \u2013 this still seems weird \u2013 to spend more time with his court cases. Southgate has been to three tournaments and taken England to a semi-final, a final and now a quarter\u2011final. Bobby Robson had more lows and also some fine highs. Everyone else on that list is basically just paddling to stay afloat, keepers of the public rage, pressed men, a grimace in a tracksuit.\nAnd now we have this, the man with the suit and the zip-up golf top, an England manager who will now consider as methodically as ever the costs and benefits of staying for Germany 2024. \nThere is some surgery needed, most notably at the back. England need an upgraded centre\u2011half with a turn of speed. England need another central midfielder and some genuine Harry Kane backup. England may also want to look at another goalkeeper at some point. Seven players on the pitch at Al Bayt were also mainstays five years ago in Russia.\nDoes Southgate have the appetite to make this work? Would another voice get more, with an opportunity instead to ensure what he leaves is a solid foundation rather than a rebuild project? More to the point, when does the needless hostility begin to degrade his ability to do the job, or indeed simply to enjoy it? Here\u2019s a thought. England have improved even since last summer. This team, with this midfield, would probably win that European Championship final.\nBut imagine how much more certain \u2013 10%? 5%? \u2013 they might have been with greater support, with an intellectually honest assessment of the progress made, instead of that sub-chorus of incoherent anger? Being booed. Defending the manager. Justifying yourself in public. These things all take their toll. \nQatar 2022 is done for England. There will, of course, be some rage, some upset. But sometimes defeat against the world\u2019s best team is simply that."

                    "body": "For the generation born just after the end of the second world war, the emergence of the teenaged Pel\u00e9 during the 1958 World Cup opened a door to a new dimension of football. The brief televised highlights of the matches in Sweden were broadcast in a black and white that was actually more like blurred shades of grey but already the Brazilian prodigy seemed to be sharply focused and bathed in a golden glow. The skinny 17-year-old with the flat-top haircut scored six goals, several of them executed with an impudent wit and a hitherto unimaginable level of technique, and then wept openly on the shoulder of Gilmar, the team\u2019s goalkeeper, when the triumph was secured. For many of his new fans in foreign lands, Edson Arantes do Nascimento was the first complicated foreign name they committed to memory.  Twelve years after that first eruption of genius he won his third World Cup winner\u2019s medal. The 1970 tournament was watched by many viewers on colour television sets, a high proportion of them purchased specially for the occasion. Football has never seemed as splendid as when Pel\u00e9 \u2013 now a mature man of 29 \u2013 was at the heart of a team including Tost\u00e3o, Jairzinho, G\u00e9rson, Roberto Rivellino and Carlos Alberto, an ensemble of masters surrounded by their own golden aura as they took the game to a new level of creative interplay, with the No 10 as their conductor. The handful of footballers generally thought of as Pel\u00e9\u2019s peers, including Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano, Diego Maradona and Johan Cruyff, possessed their own special qualities: a patrician elegance in the first instance, a transcendental cunning in the second, a rare meeting of intellect and athleticism in the third. What Pel\u00e9 radiated was simpler \u2013 and made a more instant appeal to the eye and the heart: it was the quality of joy. That, perhaps above everything, is the factor that makes him first among equals in the minds of many good judges. No one could be blamed for preferring one of his rival candidates for the top step on the all-time podium; the unique appeal of each one triggers a different set of responses and you would have to include Zinedine Zidane, Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi in there, too. But there was something about Pel\u00e9 that made everyone smile as they cheered his exploits, something that spoke of the way the game at its best could illuminate individual lives and the whole world. He was the first global football superstar. More than that, along with Muhammad Ali and Bob Marley he became one of a select group of black sportsmen and entertainers who transcended their field of expertise and achieved global renown in the 20th century, with a status only half a rung below Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela. Although he was accused in the 1970s of leftist sympathies by Brazil\u2019s repressive military government, he was no revolutionary; in general his public utterances were as benevolently anodyne as those of a Miss World contestant campaigning for world peace. But the effect of his presence, of his pre-eminence, helped loosen the shackles of ignorant prejudice. In the eyes of the football public he was pristine, immaculate. He carried with him a kind of innocence: no matter how famous he became, this was somehow always the boy who had grown up the son of a goalscorer of some repute but whose own first matches had been played on the street in Tr\u00eas Cora\u00e7\u00f5es, his home town, with old shoes for goalposts and a ball made from paper or rags stuffed into a sock and tied with string. The freshness and sheer delight of his play remained those of that small boy, transmitting a message to which other boys playing in the back streets of Belfast or Bolton could readily respond.  No serious scandal stained his image during the 20 years of his playing career. He was not, of course, a perfect human being and he was certainly no softie on the pitch. But he did nothing mean or petty. His tricks with the ball bamboozled opponents but were never designed to diminish or humiliate them. He sought no unfair or illegitimate advantage. In victory he was gracious and modest, as if always profoundly aware of the good fortune that had been bestowed upon him. And he gave the impression of wanting to share his pride and pleasure in it with everyone. In his prime, between the finals in Sweden in 1958 and those in Mexico in 1970, Pel\u00e9 resembled the perfect athlete. Balance was the key, in build as well as in movement. Physically, everything about him appeared to be perfectly matched. Neither notably slender nor heavily muscled, he was fast over the ground whether in a sudden dart or a long run. As well as the nimbleness to outfox opponents with a feint or a nutmeg, he had the strength to resist would-be tacklers. He had a powerful shot and a good leap for a header. But most of all he had an imagination free from earthly constraints.  It was there in the first of his goals that made his new international audience sit up and take notice, when he scored the third of Brazil\u2019s five goals in the 1958 final by calling for a pass from N\u00edlton Santos and controlling the ball on his chest, waiting for it to drop and using his thigh to flip it over the head of Julle Gustavsson, the Swedish defender, before running round him and volleying the ball past the goalkeeper. Here was a signature move, the equivalent of Puskas\u2019s drag-back, the Cruyff turn or Maradona\u2019s gambeta. And it was being accomplished by a teenager, his mind clear of calculation, barely older than the boys who then tried to emulate it in their school playgrounds. It was, he wrote in his autobiography, one of his all-time favourite goals \u2013 and, according to his Brazilian club, Santos, he had 1,091 to choose from \u2013 \u201cbecause I was so young but also because no one had seen a goal like that before\u201d. In fact the quarter-final against Wales had featured a more earthbound version of the same trick, when he controlled a short pass on his chest inside the penalty area, turned past the bewildered Mel Charles, the Welsh No 5, and nudged the ball past goalkeeper Jack Kelsey to produce the only goal of the match. Five days later the second-half hat-trick with which he led Brazil past France and into the final contained nothing as memorable: he was saving that up for the main event, which he sealed with a looping header that sailed inside the post in the 90th minute. He promptly fainted from the excitement, waking to find Garrincha holding his legs in the air to allow the blood to flow back to his brain.  He had worn the No 10 shirt for the first time during the tournament, doing more than anyone to give that magic number its lustre and its association with creativity of the most exalted kind. Many years later it was claimed that the Brazilian team management had submitted their list of players without designating individual numbers; apparently they had been allocated by a Fifa functionary. A year later, at 18, he and his teammates faced England in a friendly at the Maracan\u00e0. Bobby Charlton remembered the tingle of anticipation he felt when Pel\u00e9 came towards him with the ball for the first time. Expecting the Brazilian to pass and move, as was already his most characteristic gambit, Charlton found himself the victim of a sudden and devastatingly effective dummy. \u201cIt was as if I\u2019d been foolish enough to try and catch a gust of wind,\u201d he wrote in his autobiography. Those enthralled by the exploits of 1958 looked forward to the next World Cup finals partly because it would offer a rare chance to see Pel\u00e9 in action again. This was long before foreign teams and players became a familiar sight in Britain, although the desire of Santos to retain his services ensured that they made regular trips for lucrative fixtures in Europe. In that way they kept him out of the clutches of the teams against whom they appeared in exhibition matches \u2013 such as Juventus, on whose behalf Umberto Agnelli took him to lunch in Turin and offered to start negotiations for his signature at $1m, an unimaginable sum in 1961.  From that perspective, the 1962 finals in Chile would be a severe disappointment. In Brazil\u2019s opening match, against Mexico in Vi\u00f1a del Mar, he beat two men before crossing for M\u00e1rio Zagallo to head the first goal and then unhinged another four defenders before shooting home with his left foot to complete the scoring. But in the same stadium three days later, against Czechoslovakia, a lurking groin injury worsened when he took a pass from Garrincha, dribbled towards goal, hit a shot against the post and felt a twinge as he stretched to reach the rebound. In the era before substitutions, he remained on the field, a limping passenger of no functional value. Later he would credit the Czechs, and Jan Lala and Jan Popluhar in particular, for refusing to take advantage by inflicting further punishment. Knowing that he was unable to do them real damage, they gave him room whenever he had the ball. \u201cIt was one of the finest things that would happen in my football career,\u201d he wrote. Things were very different in 1966. English fans who had looked forward to seeing him at first-hand were dismayed when he succumbed to the close attentions of Dobromir Zhechev of Bulgaria and Portugal\u2019s Jo\u00e3o Morais, the two butchers whose relentless tripping and hacking in the group stage resulted in him finally being carried from the Goodison Park pitch by the team\u2019s doctor and masseur, a vision of intense sadness. It may have been an illusion created by the television pictures, still in black and white, but the industrial gloom of northern England seemed completely the wrong stage for him and his compatriots, as incongruous as staging Look Back in Anger in the sunshine of Copacabana beach. Brazil, with one win and two defeats, went out of the competition and Pel\u00e9 vowed never to play in a World Cup again.  His resolution crumbled as the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o prepared for the 1970 tournament. After he scored his much-anticipated thousandth goal in 1969 \u2013 a penalty against Vasco da Gama \u2013 he wanted to make another mark on the competition, and there had been significant changes at the top of the CBF, the Brazilian football association. The role of head coach was taken over by Zagallo, his old teammate and friend, who assembled a group of assistants to take care of the fine details of preparation in a way that would prefigure the marginal gains philosophy of Britain\u2019s Olympic cycling squad three and a half decades later. Pel\u00e9 was the figurehead but Zagallo also empowered other senior players \u2013 notably Carlos Alberto and G\u00e9rson \u2013 to offer their opinions on selection and tactics. A devout Catholic since childhood, Pel\u00e9 helped instigate a daily meeting at which almost the entire party assembled for prayers: not to win the tournament but for others, such as the sick or those enduring the war in Vietnam. He spoke to the younger players about their duty to take the business of football seriously and not to waste the opportunity offered by a World Cup. \u201cWe lived as a real family,\u201d he remembered and the team responded with a series of incandescent performances that bestowed upon them the title, still unchallenged, of the best international team ever seen. Pel\u00e9 himself left memories of his wonderfully audacious attempts to score by dummying the Uruguayan goalkeeper and by shooting from 60 yards against Czechoslovakia \u2013 neither was successful but both left an indelible imprint. In the pulsating 1-0 group-stage defeat of England, his no-look sideways tap for Jairzinho to shoot home came at the end of a matchless example of interplay. The final against Italy yielded his last World Cup goal \u2013 a snap of the neck muscles to meet a cross at the far post, then a leap into the arms of Jairzinho for an image that defined goal celebration \u2013 and another selfless short square pass at the end of an intricate passing movement, this time cueing up the rumble of thunder with which Carlos Alberto scored Brazil\u2019s fourth. With Santos he continued to roam the world, refilling the club\u2019s coffers while allowing hundreds of thousands to glimpse his brilliance at first-hand. Finally, at the end of the 1974 season, he called it a day. At 34, his career in first-class football was over. But one new and unexpected challenge remained. The following season he signed for the New York Cosmos, bankrolled by Warner Brothers, to compete in the North American Soccer League. The US had been the one place in the world he could walk the streets without being mobbed. That would change as, joined in this new adventure by Franz Beckenbauer, he briefly made attendance at a Cosmos game as fashionable as a visit to Studio 54. He was paid $7m, more than he had earned in his entire career with Santos, in a contract negotiated with the record company executives who had founded the club, and who included a recording contract as part of the deal, alongside various tax-minimising measures.  Now we can look at the images from those years, at the groovy Cosmos badge and the modest semi-afro and sideburns, and immediately hear the disco-funk soundtrack: Lady Marmalade, The Hustle, Jive Talkin\u2019, You Sexy Thing, Love Hangover, Shake Your Booty, That\u2019s the Way (I Like It). Maybe the football produced by the Cosmos at their successive homes \u2013 Downing Stadium on Randall\u2019s Island (where the pitch had to be sprayed with green paint to disguise the absence of grass), Yankee Stadium in the Bronx or the Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey \u2013 had no more substance than the music but it similarly promised and often attained a good time, including the 1977 NASL championship. His retirement at the end of that season, celebrated with a match between his two clubs, in which he scored for both sides, prefaced the collapse of the league\u2019s fragile popularity. Away from the pitch, his romantic life was a complicated matter of three marriages, half a dozen children and the odd paternity claim. His business ventures, too, often ended unhappily, largely thanks to a poor choice of associates. But his life remained eventful and fulfilling, whether he was starring in Escape to Victory or visiting Buckingham Palace to receive an honour. Although there were spats with the notorious Brazilian football administrator Ricardo Teixeira over the rejection of a bid for television rights by Pel\u00e9\u2019s company, in general he was not the one to take issue with the game\u2019s rulers \u2013 Sepp Blatter and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Champagne of Fifa were the first to be thanked in the acknowledgments page of his autobiography. He became a goodwill ambassador for Fifa but had no desire to embark on a coaching career, although for a while he helped his old teammate Clodoaldo with Santos\u2019s junior teams, in whose ranks he spotted the talents of Robinho and Diego. Basically, however, he was now a professional diplomat, and a well-remunerated one, travelling from one tournament or commemorative event to another, smiling and shaking hands everywhere. At least this allowed him to operate at a level above cynicism and to remain a symbol of the idealised jogo bonito.  In 1994, having rebuffed approaches from previous Brazilian presidents, he accepted a request from Fernando Henrique Cardoso to become the country\u2019s minister for sport. He campaigned for clubs to be run in a more ethical and transparent way, for players in Brazil to enjoy a Bosman-style freedom of movement, and for the separation of the league and the CBF, as had happened in England with the creation of the Premier League. He met less resistance when he instituted a programme of \u201cOlympic villages\u201d in cities around Brazil, intended to give the kids of the shantytowns a chance to play organised sport. \u201cI did not realise that being in politics is one battle after another,\u201d he reflected and in 1998 he stepped down in order to be able to commentate on the World Cup in France. As a spokesman for a credit card company, he continued to give interviews and press conferences in which he sometimes seemed too eager to say things that would please his audience. Speaking to the English press, for example, he would invariably single out an England player for favourable comment. Sometimes his judgments bemused his audience, as when, while addressing a meeting of the international football press, he lavished praise on Nicky Butt as the best player at the 2002 World Cup. But he retained his aura. Like Stirling Moss or Arnold Palmer, he turned the business of being himself into his life\u2019s work, while never making the task seem onerous. For all that he had been through, all the hurtful injuries and the business humiliations, no lasting shadow fell on an ability to embody and project the essence of the simple game to which he had given new beauty and meaning. And, most of all, the joy that will continue to radiate whenever his name is spoken."

                    "body": "Antonio Conte has played down concerns over Harry Kane\u2019s fitness levels for the World Cup, having said on Wednesday that the England captain was \u201cvery, very tired\u201d after starting 21 games in a row for Tottenham.\nThe Spurs manager backed the forward to enjoy a \u201cfantastic\u201d tournament and defended his decision to keep playing Kane during a packed run of domestic fixtures. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to make a decision to put him on the bench,\u201d Conte said. \u201cWe are talking about a player with great experience to manage his body.\u201d\nKane was withdrawn after an hour of the midweek Carabao Cup defeat at Nottingham Forest and Conte revealed afterwards the 29-year-old had been struggling with fatigue in a training session on Tuesday. Despite that, the Italian insists he has no concerns about Kane before Saturday\u2019s visit of Leeds, or for England\u2019s campaign in Qatar.\n\n\u201cI think and I am sure Harry is going to play a fantastic World Cup because in this season he was never injured, he has had the possibility to have a good training session and he is good physically,\u201d Conte added. \u201cThe fans must not be worried for him. After this game they [England] have one week, eight days to prepare for the World Cup, but he is ready because he is working very well.\u201d\nConte had planned to rest Kane at some point during a run of 13 games in 43 days, but injuries to Dejan Kulusevski, Richarlison and Son Heung-min left Tottenham short of attacking options. The former Italy manager also warned Gareth Southgate that Kane \u201cwants to play every game. This is important for me because it means he feels well. He wants to finish well with us. Tottenham is at the top of his thoughts until Saturday [night].\u201d\n\u201cHe is the captain of England, the most representative player, we are talking about a really top striker in the world,\u201d Conte continued. \u201c[The World Cup] is a big competition, the most important in the world and he has great desire to do something special for his national team, but they have to do this after the [Leeds] game.\n\u201cWhen you are a player like Harry that gives you everything in every game, it\u2019s very difficult to put him on the bench or to give him a rest because [of] his desire, and his eyes are full of energy.\u201d\n\nConte\u2019s Tottenham deal expires at the end of the season, although the club reportedly hold an option to trigger a 12-month extension. The manager does not see the need to urgently discuss terms, but said the January transfer window will be a key topic of discussion with the club hierarchy.\n\u201cIn my opinion, it\u2019s important for me professionally [that] I have to feel I deserve to have a new contract with this club. I have to feel this. But for sure we\u2019ll talk with the club and we\u2019ll find the best solution,\u201d Conte said. \u201cIt depends always on the possibilities of the club and also the ambition, but for sure we\u2019ll speak.\u201d\nConte added that conversations with the chairman, Daniel Levy, and sporting director Fabio Paratici have been \u201cgood\u201d, but suggested that talks over \u201crealistic ambitions\u201d for the club are required. \u201cUntil now we worked only with this target to improve, and to find a good way to bring this club to be competitive,\u201d he added.\n\u201cFor this reason it will be very important to speak [and] to understand very well what is the realistic possibility for us, which are the realistic ambitions for the club, because I think the truth is very important. If you know the truth, you can work to find the best solution for the future.\u201d"

                    "body": "The whistles were deafening, drowning out every skerrick of doubt this crowd belonged completely, unconditionally, to Tunisia. A red vortex, a black hole threatening to suck Australia into Group D oblivion. But the Socceroos defied gravity at Al Janoub Stadium, blocked out \u2013 or fed off \u2013 the horns and hissing and beating drums, to make this must-win match their own and take three points at a World Cup for the first time in 12 years.\nThe key statistic beforehand was that Tunisia have not won a single match from their past 30 after conceding first. And so it went that, after Mitchell Duke headed his country into the lead midway through the first half, the 1-0 lead was rendered unassailable.\nIn truth that was less a case of statistical symmetry and more one of Australia\u2019s perseverance and dogged determination to win this war, this helter-skelter 90 minutes of fire and brimstone between two low-ranked teams wanting \u2013 needing \u2013 a win to stay relevant in the third and final group-stage fixtures.\n\nThe result ensures that is the case for Graham Arnold\u2019s side, who are now second on three points with France and Denmark still to play on Saturday. How that plays out will have a big say in the permutations, but for now they have done everything in their power to rectify their opening-match failures and stay in the calculations to reach the last 16 for the first time since 2006.\nThere is also something to say about the retention of Duke to lead the line, despite talk he might be less suited to a game such as this than Jamie Maclaren or Jason Cummings. His goal aside \u2013 a smart back-to-goal header \u2013 the striker got under his opponents\u2019 skin and scratched from the inside, winning a swag of duels and paying particular attention to Montassar Talbi.\n\nIn all the victory was hard-fought and deserved. It was also a scrap of breakneck pace and flesh on flesh, the ball at times a ping-ponging sidebar to the bustle of bodies. Aaron Mooy hit the ground with a thump under Dylan Bronn. Duke, under a crunching challenge from Talbi, looked briefly to have dislocated a knee cap but limped on.\nA\u00efssa La\u00efdouni, the same A\u00efssa La\u00efdouni who had slid with unbridled delight straight through Christian Eriksen four days ago, won a header from Craig Goodwin to a similar ovation.\nIt all tested the boundaries of the German referee, Daniel Siebert, and both sides pushed the envelope. Kye Rowles at times played a dangerous game \u2013 he also slogged one clearance into the crowd \u2013 and Jackson Irvine, hovering precariously on a yellow card from game one, erred close to the edge.\nBut the Tunisians, unsettled in the opening exchanges, pushed the envelope a little more and conceded a number of free-kicks.\nTunisia\u2019s coach, Jalel Kadri, had said he was unsurprised by the 4-1 scoreline in Australia\u2019s opening loss to France. Perhaps he now underestimated the opposition, but it became clear early on that his players throwing their weight around and exploiting errors was not a sufficient gameplan.\n\nKadri made just one change, slotting in Na\u00efm Sliti for Anis Ben Slimane and sticking with the 3-4-3 deployed with success against Denmark. They morphed into a back five when required and defended meanly. When Australia turned over possession, the counterattack was fast.\nFran Karacic, Arnold\u2019s only change, required help at times marking the captain and talisman, Youssef Msakni, but offered forward movement on the right flank.\nWith 20 minutes played, a diagonal through ball opened up ample space, only for Rowles to chase Msakni all the way to the byline. Some time later Mohamed Dr\u00e4ger blasted a shot over the bar, then threw up his head in dissatisfaction. The fans cried out in disbelief.\nTunisia\u2019s clearest opportunity arrived close to the break, when the brilliant Harry Souttar spectacularly denied Dr\u00e4ger when he thought he had only Mat Ryan to beat.\nRyan had the unenviable first-half task of manning Australia\u2019s goal in front of the biggest concentration of chants and flags and flailing limbs. When another foray approached he rushed off his line, leapt high above the throng and came down with the ball, only to spill on impact, grabbing desperately under the rush of boots. Msakni took honours for the biggest miss in first-half stoppage-time, failing to bury a finish at point-blank range.\nBy that point Australia were already ahead, playing out from the back for the first time and Goodwin feeding Duke from the left flank \u2013 the first cross to find its target \u2013 before the frontman flicked the ball into the far corner and raced over to the stands to celebrate with his son.\nIf the first half belonged to Australia, the second very well could have been Tunisia\u2019s. Ryan was called into action umpteen times as the penalty area was swarmed by white and red shirts.\nSouttar, who stood tall throughout, cut off Eliyes Skhiri in sublime fashion as the latter bore down on goal. Tunisia were opting for route one. In truth, neither side was especially brave in possession and the crossing was not always impressive but, with 20 minutes to play, the substitute Maclaren\u2019s was pinpoint. The ball raced along the pitch with intent and, had a sliding Mat Leckie made contact, the lead would have surely doubled.\nAs the minutes ticked down the stakes heightened. La\u00efdouni flattened Goodwin and went into the book for his troubles. Ferjani Sassi copped a late yellow card. The desperation reached a climax. The whistles were deafening \u2013 until they were snuffed out."

Young people climbed fences, light posts and the giant BA sign at the foot of the monument. It was an ecstatic tribute to a World Cup victory this country had been waiting for ever since this football-mad nation last carried the trophy home in 1986. A giant football shirt hung from the facade of the Teatro Col\u00f3n, on the central Avenida 9 de Julio. Parents asked friends to take pictures of babies in tiny Messi shirts to mark this momentous occasion for when their children \u2013 too young to remember \u2013 grow up. More than a million people were in the streets of Buenos Aires celebrating the victory, according to estimates from the Argentinian authorities. It was a scene that played out across the city, with impromptu parties even breaking out at bus stops as fans making their way back out to the suburbs waited for buses they were too euphoric to realise weren\u2019t running. \u201cComing to Argentina during the World Cup was the best decision I\u2019ve done in my entire life!\u201d said Tom\u00e1s Kuklis, who had moved back home from New York so he could watch the World Cup with his family.  On Monday, Argentinians were bleary-eyed but still buoyed by the victory. The national football team are due in Buenos Aires Ministro Pistarini airport at around 2am on Tuesday morning, arriving on a special Aerol\u00edneas Argentinas flight with the team\u2019s image emblazoned on its side. They can expect a hero\u2019s welcome, with local media posting links to flight tracker sites so fans can follow their return in real time.  Such vast crowds are expected to flock to the airport to see them home that buses that would normally run along the highway into central Buenos Aires are reportedly being put on diversion. Many social media users have been calling on President Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez to decree 20 December a public holiday, with \u201cAlberto decree\u201d trending on Twitter after the team\u2019s victory. \u201cAlways together, always united. WE\u2019RE WORLD CHAMPIONS! There are no more words. THANK YOU, Argentina,\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez tweeted after the game. For many Argentinians, Lionel Messi leading his team to victory has sealed his place at Maradona\u2019s side in the pantheon of the footballing gods. \u201cMessi has taken history by storm and won devotion, gratitude and eternity,\u201d was the headline in the broadsheet La Naci\u00f3n. The team captain, who is 35, has said that this World Cup will be his last, but on Sunday, with the World Cup trophy cradled in his arm, he told reporters that he would like to keep playing on the national team for the time being.  The Qatari emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al Thani, presented Messi with a traditional bisht robe before he lifted the cup. The gesture was interpreted as a great gesture of respect on both sides. Amid the riotous joy of car horns, music and whooping, several fans wore T-shirts, caps and signs with their new favourite Messi quote: \u201cQu\u00e9 mir\u00e1s bobo? And\u00e1 para all\u00e1 bobo!\u201d. (What are you looking at, dummy? Get lost, dummy!) The phrase is from the tournament\u2019s infamously scrappy quarter-final match with the Netherlands: as he came off the pitch, Messi was giving an interview in the tunnel when he caught the Dutch striker Wout Weghorst giving him the stink eye, and made the comment live on air. His take-no-nonsense attitude went viral instantly. Roars of support poured in from across Latin America, with football lovers across the region ecstatic that the trophy had gone, if not to them, then at least to their regional neighbours. \u201cArgentina\u2019s victory is the victory for the Great Homeland\u201d, tweeted the Bolivian president, Luis Arce, using the phrase which describes the ideal of a shared regional community of Spanish-speaking Americans.  \u201cFootball is so beautiful,\u201d added the Chilean president, Gabriel Boric. \u201cA giant hug to our Argentinian brothers. Their joy crosses the [Andean] cordillera.\u201d In France, which lost to Argentina by the narrowest of margins, police reported more than 200 arrests. But in Buenos Aires, city police had tallied just 17 arrests by Monday morning, according to local media. In the streets of San Telmo, a truck passed by, full of men several litres of Quilmes beer in. A man in a blue and white boiler suit thumped the car roof in anger at a perceived slight, looking for a moment like he might start something. But then, voices of revellers all around swelled like a tide. \u201cCome on man \u2013 be happy,\u201d they said. \u201cWe won!\u201d"

Francisco Maturana told Su\u00e1rez he was leaving to focus on the national team and he wanted him to join his assistant Hern\u00e1n G\u00f3mez in taking his place. \u201cThat morning I trained with my teammates; that afternoon they introduced me as coach,\u201d he recalls. \u201cMaturana believed in me before I did.\u201d\nWell, sort of. \u201cOne day I asked him what he had seen in me,\u201d Su\u00e1rez says. \u201cAnd he said: \u2018The thing is, you were such a bad player and such a good person that it was the only way to get you to retire.\u2019\u201d He laughs but Maturana, Colombia\u2019s coach at the 1990 and 1994 World Cups as well as Ecuador\u2019s in 1998, when he made Su\u00e1rez assistant, was right. On Wednesday afternoon, the 62-year-old will lead out Costa Rica, the third country he has qualified for a World Cup with, after Ecuador in 2006 and Honduras in 2014, to face Spain. It has become an \u201cobsession\u201d, he says.\n\u201cObsession is a positive thing. When I reached my first World Cup, I went round with a tape recorder like a journalist, but only asking one question: \u2018Profe, help me with your experience. If you went to a World Cup again, what would you do?\u2019 I saw Menotti, Bilardo, Basile, Queiroz. They opened up but when I got there I lived something I had never experienced \u2013 I was pretty bad, so it was quite hard for me to go to a World Cup \u2013 and couldn\u2019t believe it. In Germany, I saw all these great things and ...\u201d\n\nSu\u00e1rez shakes his head. \u201cI said to myself: \u2018This won\u2019t be my only World Cup. It can\u2019t be. I want more.\u2019 Luckily, I had Honduras and now Costa Rica and the obsession grows. This time, people were saying: \u2018You\u2019re not going to do it,\u2019 the situation wasn\u2019t good, but there was a moment where I thought: \u2018Yes, we can do this,\u2019 where I returned to that obsession.\u201d\nCosta Rica won only one of their first seven qualifying games. \u201cI was ill with Covid, at home, alone,\u201d Su\u00e1rez recalls. \u201cIt\u2019s a moment where you chuck it all away or drag yourself through. I chose drag through. I got this obsessive feeling again, and wanted to transmit that to the players. There\u2019s a group who want the same, a synergy. I remember Keylor Navas saying: \u2018I\u2019m here to fight.\u2019 And this very interesting emotional state was created.\u201d\nThey won six and drew one of their final seven games, reaching the playoff against New Zealand. On Su\u00e1rez\u2019s fridge are the arts and crafts his grandson made; in the middle of them are also four magnets: Spain, Germany, Japan and Costa Rica, placed there on the day of the World Cup draw in April. \u201cIt was never \u2018New Zealand or Costa Rica\u2019, just Costa Rica,\u201d he says; every time he went to the fridge for two months, he saw it. In June, Joel Campbell\u2019s goal took them to Qatar. The magnets stayed.\n\u201cIt was a difficult year; to arrive at a place I didn\u2019t know,\u201d Su\u00e1rez says, yet it is a familiar process. After all, this is the third country he has taken to a World Cup, and none have been his own. \u201cThe timing didn\u2019t fall right with Colombia,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was a moment they offered but I was very raw, didn\u2019t have the experience. I\u2019d only been assistant. It was 1999, I called my dad. \u2018What do you think?\u2019 He said: \u2018There are canons aiming at [coach] Javier \u00c1lvarez and all I see is them turning on you.\u2019\u201d\nSu\u00e1rez continues: \u201cA few years later, when Ecuador came I felt ready. I had been assistant there, I had been at Aucas, I knew how the Ecuadorian thinks \u2013 not the player, the person. That\u2019s important: to understand them, the idiosyncrasies, to have the plasticity to adapt. Honduras signed me in advance: I had a year, two, to get to know them. With Costa Rica, it was a crash course. You have to learn about them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI spoke to the coach of the Costa Rican golf team. He said the Costa Rican golfer is different to the American golfer: he tries to get the ball closer to the hole, the American hits to the hole. That\u2019s the Costa Rican: careful, cautious. I like how they are. Without being a rich country, it\u2019s an equalitarian country, without such difference between classes. Pura vida. They told me: \u2018When we got independence from the Spanish, we didn\u2019t fight. The viceroy sent a letter saying we were free.\u2019 Imagine it. There\u2019s not even a fight for liberty.\u201d\nSu\u00e1rez laughs. \u201cAnd the best thing was they took their time replying to say whether they accepted. You have to understand and use that character. You\u2019re not there to indoctrinate. Some coaches say: \u2018What I say is everything.\u2019 I totally oppose that. I want the team to be a mental state that\u2019s achieved when everyone feels heard, personally important, owners of their destiny, personified in the team.\u201d\nHe discusses sessions that provide structure but foster freedom, autonomous decision-making, problems put there to be overcome. There\u2019s an enthusiasm for leftfield ideas, mental games. Introduced to Three Sided Football, he may try it. He describes practice games in which players don\u2019t know who\u2019s on their team or that are conducted in silence. There\u2019s a glint in his eye going, an idea underpinning it all: players thinking, taking agency.\n\u201cIf players just do what we say they end up as robots,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have to humanise this. Us coaches are guilty of thinking about the move and not about the player: how he is, how he feels. We create a situation where he runs football, he doesn\u2019t play football. Latin Americans have tried to be more European but we lost our essence: joy, creativity. We\u2019ve put on a suit that doesn\u2019t fit; the Latin American is badly dressed.\u201d\nSu\u00e1rez continues: \u201cThe most important thing is listen, find complicity. I spoke to Keylor and saw a fervent desire to qualify. I said: \u2018Me too.\u2019 Two people obsessed with reaching the World Cup. Others are intelligent managing the group too, like Bryan Ruiz, Celso Borges, Bryan Oviedo. It\u2019s absolutely an advantage having that generation. Look at Joel Campbell. At Arsenal I always saw someone who could stand out; now although he\u2019s only 30 I see a mature man aware of where he\u2019s going. And the most important thing is those players teach. They\u2019ve taken kids aged 19, 20 and practically adopted them.\n\n\u201cNavas is a warrior, a role model, not just for Costa Rica but Central America. He\u2019s won three Champions Leagues but doesn\u2019t want to be the star: if the opponents are throwing stones at the ranch and he\u2019s saving everyone, he\u2019s not happy. When he brings a signed PSG shirt and raffles it among the youngest players, he\u2019s doing something no coach can. I can\u2019t achieve what he does with an embrace or a gesture. Just him being there is so valuable.\u201d\nNavas has also been here before. As the fridge magnets testify, Costa Rica could hardly have a more difficult group. \u201cMagnifico!\u201d Su\u00e1rez says, mock rolling his eyes. But in 2014, Costa Rica got out of their group ahead of England and Italy. \u201cThere are five or six who know how to approach this. Because it\u2019s happened before doesn\u2019t mean it will again, but their experience brings calm to others. They ask: \u2018How can we do this? Is it possible?\u2019 Yes, it\u2019s possible.\n\u201cWe\u2019re conscious that others are favourites but we want to compete. There was a catharsis in qualification, from six points in seven games to 19 in 21. Against New Zealand people thought we only had to turn up to go through, but we were very serious. Right now, I see a group that has the same concentration, focus, commitment.\u201d\nThey also have Su\u00e1rez\u2019s red Converse boots, worn every game and so lucky that he couldn\u2019t take them off if he wanted to. \u201cThe players oblige me to wear them \u2013 I could be naked, so long as I wore them,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s no sponsorship deal. I started wearing them because I had a foot problem, had to use a splint and needed something that held it in place. I\u2019ll enjoy wearing them at another World Cup.\u201d\nSo famous have the shoes become that before the tournament Su\u00e1rez presented the country\u2019s president, Rodrigo Chaves, with an identical pair. Do well now in Qatar and they\u2019ll end up in a museum. Costa Rica\u2019s coach laughs. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says, \u201cand if we do badly, I\u2019ll have to use them to run away.\u201d"

                    "body": "Nine years ago the then new chairman of the Football Association, Greg Dyke, spoke of his aims for England\u2019s men\u2019s football team. \u201cI want to set the whole of English football two targets,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first is for the England team to at least reach the semi-finals of the Euro Championship in 2020 and the second is for us to win the World Cup in 2022.\u201d So far better than expected, then \u2013 but one big step to come: win the blood-soaked, tainted World Cup in Qatar. It always seemed a ridiculous target on which to base any long-term success of the FA \u2013 get a dodgy decision in the semi-final and decades-old plans turn to dust.  It\u2019s a quote that\u2019s followed Dyke around for years, and to be fair to him it was part of a plan to focus the minds of everyone in the game about the paucity of English talent playing in the top flight. Of course, trying to win the World Cup seems like a really good idea. In practice, history tells us that it\u2019s slightly trickier. There are other countries in the world where football is quite popular, who also would like to win the World Cup, with teams who have excellent players \u2013 who, again, would also like to win the World Cup. But however glaringly obvious that is, there are still those, perhaps blinded by the quality of the Premier League (without noticing the nationalities of most of the best players), who expect so much of England each time around. It\u2019s this kind of madness that prompts people to write in capital letters when you try to point out that Gareth Southgate is the second-most successful manager in the side\u2019s history. YOU CALL LOSING A FINAL SUCCESS? THAT IS THIS COUNTRY\u2019S PROBLEM ALL OVER. As with previous England managers, it feels as if there is no middle ground \u2013 you either back him 100% or think he should be sacked immediately and replaced with Thomas Tuchel. If Tuchel isn\u2019t interested, force him to do it against his will, with no games and just a week of training before we play Iran in November.  Of course this nuance-less world extends to every part of England selection. Play more attackers \u2013 even if they\u2019re out of position. What are they doing out of position? Pick a squad of right-backs. Drop all the right-backs. Build the team around Jude Bellingham. HE\u2019S ONLY 19 STOP PUTTING PRESSURE ON THE LAD. The hashtag #SouthgateOut was trending on Twitter before England\u2019s first game in Euro 2020 because he picked Kieran Trippier at left-back against Croatia. The Toney-Tomori debate also elicited so much fury. How can you possibly know if they can cut it if they don\u2019t get 25 minutes against Germany? But similarly, how can 25 minutes in one game really be an indication of whether any player is international quality? Moreover what does \u201cinternational quality\u201d really mean when elite club football is better? It is possible to believe simultaneously that Southgate is the man to take England to Qatar but hold reservations about his tactics, or disagree with some of his selections. Given the swathes of criticism of his defensive outlook against the bigger teams, it feels counterintuitively brave to stick to those principles. England are unlikely to win the World Cup. Go down in flames and no one will complain (spoiler: they will); lose with the handbrake on and you\u2019ve left the door wide open \u2013 and probably lost your job.  A lot of this comes back to how we consume football. How many of us are really invested in internationals until a major tournament begins? It\u2019s on so we watch \u2013 but a boring game feels even more boring because you weren\u2019t that bothered in the first place. It\u2019s classic confirmation bias \u2013 you knew you hated the international break, it\u2019s disrupted your weekend routine, and so it\u2019s proved. (Granted, last Friday\u2019s Italy game was boring by any metric.) Even the thrilling bits, those 15 minutes in the second half against Germany, are more of a passing bit of fun than something to remember. But since it\u2019s the only game happening, it receives so much coverage despite the fact that none of us are really that interested. What would have happened had England not staged that comeback on Monday night? I heard someone on the radio saying there would be \u201cso much noise\u201d around Southgate and the players for the next two months. However much I\u2019d like to think the England manager switches TalkSport on or downloads the Guardian\u2019s Football Weekly podcast straight after a match, you\u2019d hope for his sanity that he opts straight for his mellow acoustic Spotify playlist. If there was a radio station called TalkTalkSport, that gave instant reaction to my shows after I came off air, hosted by current managers and players we\u2019d just criticised, I\u2019d probably give it a wide berth.  And realistically how much noise is there going to be about the World Cup until the week before it starts? For the next six weeks, football is relentless: Premier League, Champions League, EFL, WSL, La Liga, etc. There is barely any time to think about it. As for Greg Dyke\u2019s 2013 dreams, the one reassuring thing about losing the final of Euro 2020 was that the despair didn\u2019t last that long. Usually with every tournament exit you get another moving BBC montage and the chance to actually enjoy the rest of the football. Knowing our luck, however, if the men\u2019s team are going to win one major trophy in my lifetime, it\u2019ll be this depressing incarnation \u2013 in an unsuitable country, built on the lives of migrant workers. If there is any noise before this tournament, that is what it should be about."

The Ukrainian league has been suspended until further notice.\nThe Scottish Football Association wrote to its Ukrainian counterpart this week offering support and is willing to accommodate any arrangement that would allow the match to take place. \nA formal proposal to delay the fixture has not been made and it is understood by all sides that any postponement would not guarantee the match takes place. A decision on whether the fixture can go ahead on the scheduled date must be made by the end of this week.\nA statement from the SFA said: \u201cThe Scottish FA president, Rod Petrie, has written to his counterpart at the Ukrainian Association of Football to send a message of support, friendship and unity. Football is inconsequential amid conflict, but we have conveyed the strong sense of solidarity communicated to us by Scotland fans and citizens in recent days. \n\u201cWe remain in dialogue with Uefa and Fifa regarding our men\u2019s Fifa World Cup play-off and women\u2019s World Cup qualifier and have offered to support our Ukrainian colleagues\u2019 preparations as best we can in these unimaginably difficult circumstances.\u201d\n\nConfirmation that Poland will progress, to play Sweden or the Czech Republic on 29 March, is expected. The Guardian understands that no alternative mechanism, such as drafting in Hungary or Finland, who narrowly missed out on qualification for the play-offs, is being considered.\nPoland took a public stand against Fifa when they called for Russia, their play-off semi-final opponents, to be banned.

                    "body": "It may feel as if a sporting lifetime has passed since Saudi Arabia turned Argentina over, but it was only three and a half weeks ago. A massive shock that animated the whole World Cup, it begged many questions, not least about the prospects for Lionel Messi and his team at this tournament.\nIt turned out that those prospects were rosy, and any footballing obituaries now seem hasty as Argentina have since won five games on the trot in Qatar to stand 90 minutes (or 120, or 145 with injury time) from history. On reflection, then, the Saudi upset seems even more extraordinary. Given Argentina\u2019s 36-game unbeaten run going into the tournament, what was it that the Green Falcons had that dozens of other teams did not?\n\nGood luck is probably the best place to start. Argentina were 1-0 up within the first 15 minutes and had three more goals disallowed for offside before half-time. The second of these, finished by Lautaro Mart\u00ednez, was the kind of marginal call that only VAR could award.\nArgentina had numerous opportunities across the match and by far the better chances. InfoGol\u2019s calculation of the expected goals in the match rated Argentina at 2.29 compared with 0.16 for the Saudis.\nIt seems clear that Argentina\u2019s dominance in the first half led to complacency in the second, when the Saudis mounted their comeback. The move that led to Saleh al-Shehri\u2019s equaliser began with Messi being dispossessed after a loose touch. WhoScored says he has had seven poor touches in the entire tournament. After a quick ball forward, Shehri was able to get beyond a laggardly challenge from Cristian Romero to shoot across Emiliano Mart\u00ednez to score.\nThe second goal was worse, Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi underhitting a clearance before \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda, Nahuel Molina and Rodrigo De Paul undercooked their challenges to let Salem al-Dawsari have a free shot, which he buried with aplomb.\n\nA valiant backs-to-the-wall defensive effort then saw Saudi Arabia over the line. It was marked less by defensive shape than by individual bravery, with defenders throwing themselves into challenge after challenge. It was as if they were playing in their final, and Saudi Arabia left themselves so drained that they could never match the same levels. Equally, Argentina, after conceding their advantage, were never able to recover a tempo sufficient to win. A period of intense aggression from the opposition \u2013 something matched perhaps only by Australia in the second half of their last-16 fixture \u2013 had been enough to unsettle the Albiceleste. Argentina have not been behind in a game since, so the question of how they might respond a second time has not been asked.\nOne final factor that should be taken into consideration is the nature of the support that day. Whereas the crowd appeared to be split 50-50 at the Lusail Stadium, it was the Saudi fans who created the noise, especially after their team\u2019s first goal went in. Argentina have not played in an environment like that since, and will not on Sunday either.\nThe Qatar World Cup has turned out to be the equivalent to a home tournament for Argentina (and Morocco). They will be backed by a monstrous choir once again in the final against France.\n\nSo Saudi Arabia rode a special set of circumstances to beat the two-times winners. Their determination, energy and will to succeed could prove a model for others, but France play their own way, seemingly at their best when they feel affronted. But it is also true that whatever the Saudis achieved, Lionel Scaloni looked at his side and saw weaknesses, flaws that he immediately sought to correct.\nJuli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez, Alexis Mac Allister and Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez did not start. Their introduction at various points later in the group stage brought elements of energy and dynamism that have transformed the team. \nThe old legs of Di Mar\u00eda and Papu G\u00f3mez have been retired from the field. Any complacency, or a sense that Argentina could win a game at half pace, has also been notable by its absence. Whatever your opinion of the frenzied behaviour that marked the closing stages of the quarter-final with the Netherlands, there is no doubt that Argentina \u2013 deservedly two goals up with 10 minutes to go \u2013 refused to be dragged under after a comeback that deserves to sit alongside the Saudi victory as one of the highlights of this tournament. Their penalty shootout victory, meanwhile, was a triumph of confident focus.\nFinally, the obligatory Messi paragraph. Something remarkable has happened to him this past few weeks. Against Saudi Arabia he seemed what a 35-year-old legend ought to be; a player with undimmed technique but an athlete in decline. Not only was that observation incorrect but it has been going further into reverse with each match. Starting with his match-winning performance against Mexico and until his fateful haunting of Josko Gvardiol, Messi has got sharper, faster and more clinical. He has played every minute of every game and has only one more match to achieve full, unimpeachable immortality. The Saudis must be grateful to have caught him when they did."

                    "body": "Pep Guardiola admitted Manchester City failed to control Ivan Toney, whose two goals gave Brentford victory over the champions less than 48 hours after he missed the cut for Gareth Southgate\u2019s England World Cup squad.\nCity\u2019s reverse was a first in the Premier League at home since February, ending a 20-match run, and leaves Guardiola\u2019s side in second place on 32 points before the break for Qatar.\n\n\u201cThe better team won \u2013 Toney\u2019s exceptional for them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had a lot of problems. We could not make a high press because they did not allow us \u2013 long balls from the keeper to the striker and in this process we could not win any balls because when Toney flicks the ball on he creates problems.\n\u201cHe\u2019s very good, he\u2019s able to win [duels] with all the central defenders, we were not able to control this aspect. Every time a centre-back jumped they suffer.\u201d\nToney, who has 10 league goals this season, was asked about missing out on the World Cup. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing but, listen, I know what I\u2019m capable of and I won\u2019t let it put me down. I just keep going and keep doing well for Brentford.\u201d\nThe 26-year-old insisted Southgate\u2019s decision had not affected his approach to the game. \u201cThe motivation is the boys in the dressing room and the fans, as you can see,\u201d he said.\nA delighted Thomas Frank said: \u201cHe should have scored five goals \u2013 he had five good chances: one in [the] first half, then he scored then he missed one from angle, scored a goal and then missed the last one. Honestly, what a player.\n\u201cGareth picked the squad he believes in but I hope he thinks about Ivan if there is an injury. He proved it today against the best team in the world. Of course him and I both think he should be there but we\u2019re looking from our side and Gareth from the other side and we don\u2019t know who\u2019s right.\n\u201cIvan has a very good family around him. I\u2019ve known him for so long, I have no doubt he\u2019ll come back stronger. I showed my empathy [to him].\u201d\nFrank described Brentford\u2019s win as the best in their history. \u201cMaybe this is the single best result. It\u2019s massive. For the fans, I\u2019m so happy we\u2019ve created another unbelievably magic moment for them. The dressing room were fantastic scenes.\n\u201cWe are the bus stop in Hounslow [as Bees fans sing] against the best team in the world.\u201d"

                    "body": "Australia have done it again. With a low save to his right to deny Peru\u2019s Alex Valera from the penalty spot, dancing goalkeeper Andrew Redmayne secured cult hero status, launched quite a few memes and booked the Socceroos\u2019 place at the 2022 World Cup.\nThe win against the more fancied Peru clinched a fifth consecutive berth at sport\u2019s biggest party, 16 years after the Socceroos ended decades in the men\u2019s football wilderness with a similarly heart-stopping win on penalties against Uruguay.\nNow, the excitement builds. If you\u2019ve not been paying attention since 2018, here are five things you need to know about the Socceroos and the 2022 World Cup.\n\n1. Qualifying was tough this time\nThe Socceroos\u2019 journey to the final qualifier against Peru on Tuesday night was tough. On the final whistle, Graham Arnold, the Socceroos manager, noted that of Australia\u2019s 20 qualification matches 16 were played away from home, mostly due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAustralia got off to a good start in their Asian confederation qualifying group, but fell behind Saudi Arabia and Japan after a few crucial draws against weaker teams. Finishing third in the group stage set up a do-or-die contest against the United Arab Emirates for a chance to play fifth-placed South American qualifiers Peru, who had humbled the Socceroos at the last World Cup.\nLast week\u2019s UAE game ended in a closely fought 2-1 win, with Ajdin Hrustic\u2019s winner coming late in the match. And on Tuesday morning, after more than 1,000 days in search of qualification and 120 goalless minutes against Peru, Australia secured another World Cup berth.\n2. Holding the World Cup in Qatar will be unprecedented\nThis will be the first Fifa World Cup held in the Middle East, and, kicking off on 21 November, it will also be the first held during the northern hemisphere\u2019s winter months.\nThat decision was taken to account for Qatar\u2019s hot and humid climate. Much has been made about the fact that the eight stadiums in and around Doha are equipped with outdoor air-conditioning systems that are designed to keep conditions manageable for players and fans. In November, though, temperatures in Qatar are also cooler, averaging about 24C.\n3. Human rights groups have criticised the decision\nThe decision to hold the World Cup in Qatar has been condemned by human rights groups. Much of the criticism has been focused on the country\u2019s record on migrant workers, including approximately 40 known to have died while employed building the stadiums where matches will be played.\nThe Guardian last year reported that more than 6,500 migrant workers from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have died in Qatar since it won the right to host the World Cup, according to data collected from government sources. Last month, a group of non-governmental organisations said Fifa should pay reparations to migrant workers whose human rights have been compromised by the Qatar World Cup.\nSocceroos midfielder Jackson Irvine, goalkeeper and captain Mat Ryan are among those who have voiced concerns, as the players consider how and if they might take a stand. Some other national teams have already worn T-shirts with human rights messages in the lead up to the tournament.\nQatar\u2019s government has responded to criticisms of human rights groups, saying it has reformed labour practices and claiming it has made significant progress on tackling the effects of heat stress.\nEngland manager Gareth Southgate is among those who have spoken out about Qatar\u2019s record on LGBTIQ and women\u2019s rights.\n4. What are the Socceroos\u2019 chances in their group?\nAustralia have qualified into Group D, alongside France, Denmark and Tunisia. France, ranked third in the world and the current holders, and Denmark, ranked 11th and recent semi-finalists at the Euros, would be firm favourites to finish in the top two spots and progress to the knockout stage.\nTunisia are ranked 35th, while Australia are 42nd. Australia\u2019s group at the 2018 tournament in Russia was almost identical, with the Socceroos losing 2-1 to France and earning a solid draw against Denmark. However, on paper, the Socceroos squad is arguably weaker heading into this World Cup.\nAustralia\u2019s best performance at a World Cup was a heartbreaking 1-0 loss in the round of 16 against Italy in 2006. And that was with a star-studded side, often described as the Socceroos\u2019 \u201cgolden generation\u201d.\n\nIt will take a number of exceptional performances, and a fair bit of luck, to match that.\n5. Where and when to watch\nThe good news is that public broadcaster SBS holds the Australian rights to the World Cup and is promising to show all 64 matches live and free.\nAs far as timing, it\u2019s a bit of a mixed bag. Australia play France at 6am AEDT on Tuesday 22 November. The crucial game against Tunisia is at the prime time of 9pm on Saturday 26 November. Finally, the Socceroos play Denmark at the brutal hour of 2am on Wednesday 30 November.\nThe knockouts will also require serious viewing commitment, with most matches to be played at 2am or 6am.\nThe World Cup final at the 80,000-capacity Lusail Stadium will be played on Monday, 19 December at 2am (AEDT)."

                    "body": "Argentina Toby Donald, 11Toby lives in Salisbury, but used to live in Catalonia (near his hero Lionel Messi). He saw Argentina win the Copa Am\u00e9rica against Brazil in 2021. My mum is from Argentina and my dad is from England \u2013 if they meet in this World Cup, it will be fun to watch them arguing! My mum went to the stadium in Buenos Aires to see a game in the 1978 tournament, when she was younger than me. She\u2019s always telling me about people celebrating in the street when Argentina won.  My friends know how much I love Argentinian football. My favourite players are, of course, Messi, Dybala, Acu\u00f1a and \u201cDibu\u201d Mart\u00ednez, who plays for Aston Villa. Every time Argentina plays, I will wear the full kit, putting paper flags that I\u2019ve printed around the house. If they get knocked out, I will support England, and either South Korea or Portugal.  I have some aspects of Argentinian culture in me since I love terer\u00e9 and mate, which are like green tea. Terer\u00e9 is made with cold water and fruit flavours, and mate with hot water. Mum\u2019s friend has an Argentinean food truck in Folkestone, and she makes me churros. During the matches, we will eat empanadas, too.  I use a lot of vocabulary from Argentina, and have my mom\u2019s accent. I am happy about my dual nationality. It was my idea \u2013 this year we went to the consulate, so I am also Argentinian now. I have a passport, so when I am a professional footballer, I can play for Argentina. Australia Wilf Dehlsen, six, and Archie Dehlsen, 10  Wilf and Archie\u2019s mum is Australian, but has been in London for 16 years. Their English dad\u2019s parents are from New Zealand and Australia. The boys were born in the UK and only have UK passports. Archie My favourite Australian players are the ones I know from the Premier League, such as Matthew Ryan and Aaron Mooy. I can\u2019t wait to see how far they get. It\u2019s a tough group with France and Denmark, but you never know. We\u2019ll be cheering Australia on, wearing our kit \u2013 and FaceTiming our cousins in Australia at the same time! If there\u2019s a match on at the weekend, we will probably be with our Australian friends to watch it, maybe at the pub. If they get knocked out, I will be supporting England as this is my home and I\u2019ve lived here all my life. I think Daddy will support England all the way, but Mummy will support Australia. I love football. I play four times a week. I\u2019ve been to Australia a few times and can\u2019t wait to go back. Wilf I don\u2019t remember the last World Cup because I was too young, but I\u2019m really excited. It\u2019s clever that Australia are called the Socceroos \u2013 it\u2019s like soccer and a kangaroo mixed up. My favourite Australian food is Vegemite toast. If Australia gets knocked out, I\u2019ll support England because I\u2019m half-English. If Australia wins, I\u2019ll celebrate hard. I love playing football in the garden with Archie! Belgium Orson Berthier Ronald, five  Orson was born and lives in London. His father is English and his mother is Belgian-American, but recently became a UK citizen. Orson speaks English and French at home and goes to a local children\u2019s football class. He loves a kickabout in the square with parents and his younger brother, Lucian, Maman and Papa. I\u2019m Belgian, English and American, and I can draw all the flags. All three teams are playing, but I\u2019ll support Belgium and wear my strip. I like the way the \u201cB\u201d has been done on it \u2013 it\u2019s clever. Papa supports England, so if Belgium play them, we\u2019ll be shouting for different teams. I\u2019d like to watch the games with Nanou [Orson\u2019s grandmother], but she lives in Waterloo, in Belgium. If Belgium get to the final, I\u2019ll invite my friend Julius to watch it with us, even though he supports Sweden. We\u2019ll have Belgian food. I could make some madeleines with Maman, and we could have gaufres (waffles) with sugar and lemon. Papa would have moules et frites \u2013 I\u2019d just have the frites. Brazil Nicholas Goncalves-Newman, 14  Nick\u2019s Brazilian parents moved to the UK in 2005 from a small town called Amambai, and he was born in Hastings, where he still lives. His grandparents, aunties, uncles and cousins live in Brazil \u2013 he\u2019s visited three or four times and plans to spend more time there. Nick talks to his Brazilian cousins in Portuguese, but he admits he understands more than he can speak, and sometimes has to use Google Translate. I\u2019ve watched clips from the 70s on YouTube, with players like Pel\u00e9, as well as more recent ones featuring the likes of Ronaldo. It\u2019s cool to support the most successful World Cup team ever, but I know they\u2019re not invincible \u2013 I\u2019ve watched the 2014 game where they lost 7-1 to Germany. My older sister, Pietra, isn\u2019t interested in football, but likes the World Cup. I might have some friends round; some have Brazil shirts. I can imagine my parents inviting some of their friends, too, and having a bit of a party. Football is a real passion in Brazil \u2013 everyone seems to love it. My cousins are good players and all talk about how they dream of being professionals. But there are more opportunities over here to become a professional player than in Brazil. I\u2019ve seen Brazil and England twice at Wembley. It was a long time ago, so I don\u2019t remember much. I watch lots of local matches. My dad plays for a local team and I play for Hastings Athletic. I\u2019m a midfielder \u2013 sometimes I play left, sometimes right. I train three times a week and we\u2019re all right \u2013 we\u2019re winning some of our games. It\u2019s not something I\u2019d ever do professionally, though. I\u2019m more into music. I play piano, and one day I\u2019d like to set up a studio and hopefully get to write my own songs. Cameroon Peace-Hillary Nsangou, 12  Peace-Hillary was born in the UK to Cameroonian parents. She visited the country with her family in 2016. I\u2019m proud that my country is playing in the World Cup this year. I\u2019ll be watching with my family: my mum, my dad and maybe my sisters and uncle. My dad is a big football fan \u2013 he used to play for a club in Cameroon. I\u2019m really looking forward to seeing how far Cameroon get this year, as I\u2019m too young to remember much about the last time they appeared. I think they\u2019ll do well. I last visited Cameroon in 2016, when I was six. It was such a fun place to go because so many of my family live there, so it felt very welcoming. I visited my grandma\u2019s place and the gravestones of some of my family. We spent most of the time in the countryside on a farm where there were sheep and chickens; it was so different to my life in London. I was scared of the chickens, though, and it was very hot. There were a lot of bugs. Canada  Ivan Gonzales Wiley, eight, and Marvin Callahan Wiley, 10  Ivan and Marvin have a Canadian mother and a British father, who was a ballboy for Charlton Athletic when he was Marvin\u2019s age (he remains a Charlton fan and once won \u00a32,000 in their half-time raffle). The brothers were born in the UK and live on the south coast.  Ivan I play football every lunchtime. I\u2019m not sure what position I play, probably left wing or something. I have a special celebratory handshake that I do with my team when we win. Marvin I love being a striker. And when I\u2019m in goal, when I save the ball, it\u2019s really satisfying. Ivan We\u2019re really looking forward to watching Canada \u2013 it\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve qualified since the 1980s. Marvin We\u2019ll make our older sister, Juno, watch as well \u2013 she\u2019s 13 and not that interested, but she does play pretty well when we have a kickabout in the garden. We might have some Canadian food and drinks like poutine (french fries with cheese curds and gravy) and root beer. Ivan I hate poutine and root beer. Coffee Crisp bars and Kool-Aid? Marvin Maybe Granny will send us some Cheezies. Mum suggested painting our faces with the Canadian flag, but I\u2019m not keen on face paints. She also suggested turning our white cat, Coconut, red. I think she was joking \u2026\u2026 Ivan We watched some of the friendlies and saw Canada beat Qatar. That was pretty good, because Qatar is the host country. My favourite Canadian players are Alphonso Davies and Jonathan David. I saw a video where Alphonso got an amazing goal \u2013 there was a 1% chance of him scoring, but he did it. Marvin I like Atiba Hutchinson. He\u2019s the captain and a great midfielder. If Canada get knocked out before England, I\u2019ll support England instead. Ivan My best friend, Henry, is part-Norwegian, and my mum\u2019s great-grandparents moved to Canada from Ukraine, so I would support Norway or Ukraine, but neither of them qualified.  Marvin We have family in Canada, and they\u2019re quite carefree. Their attitude is: \u201cIt might be fun \u2013 let\u2019s do it.\u201d We drove a boat when we were there. Ivan We rode a rollercoaster down a mountain, too. We also threw axes. Costa Rica Zion Williams Monge, five, and Siara Williams Monge, three  Zion and Siara were born in the UK to a Costa Rican mother and Jamaican father. They live in Nottingham. Zion has been to Costa Rica twice, Siara has yet to visit, due to the pandemic. The girls stay in touch with their family there, including their maternal grandparents (Tita Carmen and Tito Pablo). They also have a lot of social contact with the Costa Rican community in the UK, as well as their paternal grandparents (who they call Tito Tony and Tita Audrey). They speak Spanish at home. Zion I remember going to Tita Carmen\u2019s in Costa Rica. There were green parrots, and we had chicken and rice. I like helping Mummy and Daddy cook. I help make tortilla sometimes, and gallo pinto (rice and beans). Siara I like to eat tortilla, and Jamaican dumpling. Zion We went to the Costa Rican independence party in London. Grandad and Grandma and Auntie came with us. Siara The ladies were dancing, and we danced in a circle. Zion We play football with Mummy and Daddy and their friends. I think Daddy plays best, but I\u2019m good at taking the ball. Siara We\u2019ll watch the games with Tito Tony and Tita Audrey at their house. We\u2019ll wear our Costa Rica tops. Mine says Siara on the back. Tito Pablo got it for me. Zion I want to buy a little one for Luana, our baby cousin. Siara When we\u2019re watching the World Cup, we can eat some popcorn. Zion I like popcorn! Croatia Max Stanic\u0301, 11  Max was born in London, but has lived in Zagreb, where his parents are from. He is fluent in Croatian and supports Dinamo Zagreb and Liverpool. He plays football for Brent Dynamo United, and likes that his own team have Dynamo in their name. During the 2018 World Cup, we were in London and watched all the Croatia games with our friends, who are from all different parts of the world: England, Croatia, Japan, Portugal. The best thing was when our friends came over from Croatia. One of my best friends is Buga, who is the same age as me and also loves football.  When Croatia played against England in the semi-final, we decided not to watch it with our football teammates because it could get too emotional. It was strange coming to school the next day. I was very proud and happy, but some of my friends were upset that England lost. When it came to the final, we watched together with my teammates and their parents, and everyone cheered for Croatia. I was too nervous to watch the whole game. It was very sad to have lost, but I was happy that my team had made it to the finals. Croatia is a very small country \u2013 with 4 million people, it is like half a London \u2013 so it was a huge achievement. We will watch the games in Qatar at home or with friends. We have friends from Croatia and England, but also many other countries. My uncle and his family are in Canada, and Croatia and Canada are in the same group, but we will be cheering for Croatia of course! If Croatia get knocked out, I will follow England, as many of my friends will be cheering for them. Denmark Laura Smart, 15, and Bess Smart, 12  Bess and Laura live with their Danish mum and English dad. The girls and their mum all have British and Danish dual nationality. Laura There are occasions which bring out my Danish identity, mainly Christmas and birthdays which see the house festooned in Danish flags, candles and pastries. But there are also wider events which awaken my Danishness \u2013 Eurovision, noir TV and the World Cup. Football is Denmark\u2019s national sport \u2013 though we are tiny, we pack a punch! But we take our social values seriously, and this year our away kit is a subdued black to reflect the controversy of Qatar. And if Denmark get kicked out in the first round I\u2019ll have the luxury of supporting England with Dad. Bess I like having dual nationality, as it gives a richer sense of identity. I also sometimes count up the fractions of other identities I have \u2013 Irish and Swedish \u2013 and I like to hear stories of my great-grandparents, who were travelling diplomats. I like to embrace all the diverse multicultural activities at school. So when the World Cup is on, the thing I like most is the unifying sense of many countries all coming together. It\u2019s what the world needs now. Ecuador Juan Alejandro Pachar Carmona, 10, and Juan Esteban Pachar Carmona, seven  Alejandro and Esteban\u2019s Colombian mother moved to the UK 20 years ago, and their Ecuadorian dad arrived here five years later. The boys have family in both countries, which they visited when they were younger. They live in Sutton, but have daily contact with their relatives via FaceTime and speak Spanish fluently. Esteban We are planning to watch Ecuador play while surrounded with family and friends, and I\u2019m hoping my granddad cooks a lovely hornado (roast pig) for us. Alejandro If Ecuador get knocked out, we\u2019ll carry on watching \u2013 football is our passion. I will support Brazil, Argentina and France instead. Outside of the World Cup, my favourite team is Real Madrid \u2013 I don\u2019t miss any games.  Esteban Not all of our relatives support Ecuador \u2013 part of our family is from Poland, and they want their team to win. I\u2019m sure Ecuador will do better, though. We know Jeremy Sarmiento who plays for Brighton &amp; Hove Albion and Ecuador. Brighton have several Ecuadorian players and we often watch their games. Alejandro We\u2019ve known Sarmiento for such a long time. He is my role model. My dream is to one day play alongside him in La Tri (the Ecuador team). England Yeray Sanchez Morales, 14  Yeray was born in Spain, but both his parents are Colombian. He moved to London when he was seven. Yeray likes playing both football and basketball. The last Word Cup feels a long time ago, and I didn\u2019t enjoy that one much, as England got as far as the semi-finals but didn\u2019t win. I\u2019ll be supporting England as I really appreciate the opportunities I\u2019ve had since moving here. I\u2019ve lived in the UK for nearly eight years, and feel really attached to this country \u2013 my mum and I love tea and have teatime every day. I\u2019ll be watching the whole tournament at home and my cousins are going to come round and watch with me. My favourite England player is Bukayo Saka. I really admire his perseverance. He gets bullied online, but he keeps going and proves his critics wrong. Colombia didn\u2019t qualify this year, so if England get knocked out before Spain, that\u2019s the team I\u2019ll support instead, as that\u2019s where I was born. I think my dad will be supporting Spain. If England and Spain end up playing each other, I\u2019m just going to tell him that he\u2019s going to lose. France Adam Tounsi, 11  Adam\u2019s mum and dad both have Algerian parents but were born in France. Adam goes to French school on Saturdays and speaks French fluently at home. My grandparents live near Grenoble in the French Alps. We visit them at Christmas and in the summer \u2013 it\u2019s hotter than in England and the mountains are very beautiful. Sometimes we go swimming. I remember France winning the 2018 World Cup, and I\u2019ve watched the game since. We beat Croatia 4-2. I\u2019ve seen the 1998 win, too, where we beat Brazil 3-0 on home turf.  Even though France have been winning nearly all their games recently, they have lost to some smaller teams. They\u2019ve been playing pretty well, but not to their full potential. I like N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9, Karim Benzema and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 best because they play well, they play fairly, and they don\u2019t fight.  I do think we stand a very good chance of winning again this year, and if we do I\u2019ll scream out: \u201cYeah! France won!\u201d Whether I\u2019ll scream it in English or French, I don\u2019t know. Germany Rebecca Eichler, nine  Rebecca lives in Hastings with her mum, Jackie, who moved to the UK from Germany when she was three. She is one of only two girls who play for the Hastings Wanderers U10s.  I really like being a quarter German, especially at Christmas when we have our St Nicholas stockings early \u2013 on 6 December! Most of the things my friends do on Christmas Day, we do on Christmas Eve. We have real candles on the tree, which some people think looks hazardous. I\u2019m pleased to support Germany \u2013 they\u2019re a really good team with lots of squad depth. Players like Neuer and M\u00fcller have been playing for a while \u2013 in fact this is probably their last chance at a World Cup. But they also have youngsters who haven\u2019t played in the World Cup yet, and they should also get a chance, like Jamal Musiala. I think Germany will at least make the semis or quarter-finals, and they could go all the way.  I know one girl at school who\u2019s supporting Germany. It would be harder to support England because they don\u2019t do that well sometimes. Germany have better teamwork \u2013 they\u2019re better at passing. Thomas M\u00fcller is my favourite player: he\u2019s funny and likes to assist a lot \u2013 his nickname is \u201cthe assist king\u201d. I try to play like him. This is my fourth year playing with Hastings Wanderers. It\u2019s a mixed team, but until recently I was the only girl. My mum sometimes coaches us, which feels odd, but she\u2019s doing quite a good job. Ghana  Benedith Gyanfiduah, 14  Benedith was born in Italy and raised in England, but his parents are from Ghana. He enjoys football and basketball at school. I remember France winning in 2018. Unfortunately, Ghana didn\u2019t qualify that time \u2013 I was very unimpressed, as usually they\u2019re a really good team and it was disappointing to see them slip. I\u2019ve watched the game from 2010, when Ghana played Uruguay. If we\u2019d won, we would have been the first African team to make the semi-finals.  My favourite player was Michael Essien \u2013 he\u2019s the reason I like Chelsea as well. I\u2019m excited to see how the team do this year, but I\u2019ll be happy to back England if Ghana get knocked out first \u2013 I was raised here, after all. My uncle and his wife will be coming round to watch with us, and we\u2019ll have Ghanaian food like jollof rice and fufu [a side dish made from cassava and plantain]. I haven\u2019t visited Ghana since I was very young, when I met my grandma and cousins, which made me very happy. I like the people there. We are a very peaceful, down-to-earth nation. Iran Tinoosh Simpkins, 15  Tinoosh was born in London to an Iranian mother and British father. He\u2019s a fan of Arsenal, the first team he ever watched, even though his mum thinks he should support his local team, Crystal Palace. I\u2019m the only one who watches football in my family. My dad\u2019s not into it, and my brother stopped liking it after he got hit in the stomach with a football three times in a row. He and Dad do watch World Cup games, though, and so does Mum when Iran are playing. I support both Iran and England. During the last World Cup I was only 10, but I remember watching Iran play in the group stages. We have snacks while watching the games, like pistachios which my grandma Maman Farideh brings back when she goes on trips to Iran. We store them in the freezer and only get them out for special occasions. We also have ajil, which is a mix of nuts and seeds such as pumpkin, melon and sunflower seeds. You can get salty or sweet ajil \u2013 the sweet kind also has dried fruit like raisins and mulberries. My favourite snack is Iranian Wotsits, which are called Pofak. I nag my parents to buy Pofak whenever we go to Iranian grocers, and to order chelo kabab from Iranian restaurants. I was only one when I last went to Iran, and I don\u2019t remember it. Iranians really like football, and my mum\u2019s family found it strange that my dad doesn\u2019t watch it. They even follow the Premier League. Iran did OK last time \u2013 it was very exciting to see them get their first win since 1998. My mum was really angry when we had a goal disallowed against Spain. Japan Iena Mirto, nine, and Yuji Mirto, 12  Iena and Yuji live in Brighton with their Japanese mother and Italian father. Their favourite member of the Japanese squad is Kaoru Mitoma because he plays for their local team, Brighton &amp; Hove Albion. Iena I\u2019m going to make a banner with the Japanese flag on and put it up in the living room. Hopefully Mum will make udon noodles and sushi for us during the matches \u2013 they\u2019re my favourites. Yuji I\u2019ll be wearing the strip and cheering the team on! Iena We\u2019ve never lived in Japan, but we visit every year or two. We love Japanese technology and anime, especially Studio Ghibli. Yuji We have dual nationality, Japanese and British, and our dad is Italian, so we\u2019re happy to cheer on all three teams. I will scream a lot if Japan wins. Iena I\u2019ll be screaming with joy, but also from the shock. Mexico Diego Bastian Cornejo-Kersten, nine  Diego was born in Mexico City and moved to the UK during the last World Cup. He has a Mexican father and German mother, and speaks English, German and Spanish fluently. Diego plays football at home with his younger sister and also at school, where he likes being in goal best, but enjoys scoring goals as a midfielder. We were still in Mexico when El Tri beat Germany in 2018. Me and Dad were wearing the Mexican shirt, and my mum and sister the German shirt. I was very excited to see Mexico win, but sad to see my mum disappointed. When we arrived in the UK I didn\u2019t speak a word of English, so I had to learn really quickly. Now my teachers can\u2019t believe I couldn\u2019t speak English just a few years ago. We usually visit Mexico once a year, and I love spending time with my grandma and grandpa \u2013 but England is my home now. I love that I am a mix of cultures. I\u2019m proud to follow El Tri. My favourite Mexican player of all time is Jorge Campos, an amazing goalkeeper who let almost no goals in. His outfit was very colourful, and I think it was great because it distracted the players of the opposing team. Although he doesn\u2019t play any more, I love watching videos of him on YouTube. I love Chucky Lozano\u2019s energy: he never stops running after the ball, and he is the one who scored against Germany \u2013 sorry, Mum!  I really hope Mexico win the World Cup, but we usually get knocked out quickly. If that happens, I will support Germany, though I also follow England. My favourite English player is Raheem Sterling, and my favourite German one is Bastian Schweinsteiger. My name is actually Diego Bastian, like him. Morocco Badr Riane, 11  Badr was born in the UK to Moroccan parents. They speak Arabic at home.  My whole family gets together to watch Morocco play. We didn\u2019t do that well at the last World Cup, but you always feel that Morocco are trying really hard.  I love visiting Morocco because the weather\u2019s so good. It\u2019s a tropical climate and I love the beaches \u2013 they\u2019re so clean. I feel proud of my heritage because Morocco is a strong country. Moroccans understand each other, and always try to help each other. If I had to pick one word to describe the country it would be \u201cjoyful\u201d. I have enough Moroccan friends in London to have a big celebration if we win. If we don\u2019t get further than we did in 2018, I\u2019ll support Brazil \u2013 their team includes most of my favourite players. The Netherlands  Lasse van de Lagemaat, seven  Lasse is the youngest of four siblings who were born in the Netherlands but live in Woking. Lasse supports the Oranje, Arsenal, because most of his school friends do, and Feyenoord. I was a toddler for the last World Cup and the Netherlands didn\u2019t qualify. But I got to wear orange for last year\u2019s Euros and for the Orange Lionesses) this year. I made some Dutch flags, and at school we made English flags, and I waved them when we watched the final. My brother and my dad went to a Dutch pub in London to watch the Oranje play. We did well in the Nations League and won against Belgium, which is important for us. At the Euros, we were not as good as England, and I was bullied a bit by my friends for wearing my orange kit to the after-school club. But in the last games, Oranje won and England lost, so now I can tell my friends the Netherlands is better than England. My favourite player is Vivianne Miedema, because she plays for Oranje and Arsenal. When I play football with my dad and siblings, I want to be Arsenal, and my dad\u2019s Feyenoord. We\u2019re going to watch the matches at home. I think I\u2019ll make some decorations with my brother and sisters. This time the World Cup is when we\u2019re celebrating St Nicholas, so we\u2019ll eat pepernoten [spiced biscuits]. When we reach the semis or the finals, my dad will take us to a Dutch pub to watch, or the Dutch Church, where he is the minister. I hope we\u2019ll win so I can celebrate with my cousins when we\u2019re in Holland at Christmas. Poland Bruno Tiger Taylor, three, and George Taylor, six   George and Bruno were born in the UK to a Polish mother and English father. Football is at the heart of their Polish family, who they visit every year in P\u0142ock, on the Vistula river. George plays football with his older cousin, Maciej, who helps him practice his tackling, and although young, Bruno is an agile player who can put up a fight. George When we\u2019re in Poland, I watch football on TV with my dziadek [grandad]. He likes Newcastle United and West Bromwich Albion, and so does my grandma. Last summer we wanted to see a Wis\u0142a P\u0142ock game, but they weren\u2019t playing at home while we were there. We\u2019ve been to the stadium in Warsaw, though and maybe we\u2019ll see them play next year. My favourite Polish player is Robert Lewandowski. He\u2019s at FC Barcelona, and he is very fast and keeps scoring goals. I hope Matty Cash [Poland\u2019s England-born right back] will be playing, too. Bruno We\u2019re going to wear our football tops to watch the World Cup. George We\u2019ll paint our faces in red and white, too, like Polish flags. We\u2019ll have a party if we win and eat kie\u0142basa [sausage], kaszanka [blood sausage] and bigos [stew]. Bruno We\u2019ll sing, \u201cPolska, Bia\u0142o-Czerwoni,\u201d and clap and shout \u201cPolska!\u201d Portugal  Gabriel Almeida, 14  Gabriel was born in Portugal and moved to the UK when he was four. He speaks Portuguese and says there was never any doubt who he\u2019d support: \u201cI\u2019ve always been Portuguese and always will be.\u201d I never miss any game they play if I can help it. Portugal beating France in the Euro finals in 2016 was one of the best moments of my life. My favourite player is Cristiano Ronaldo, because what he\u2019s done throughout the years is incredible. I\u2019m a keen footballer. I\u2019m in my school team \u2013 we won our last game even though the other team cheated. I\u2019ve also played for Arsenal for the past six months. I dream of one day playing for Portugal. I go back during the holidays and love it there.  I won\u2019t miss a Portugal game \u2013 I just want to see my team win. If they did get knocked out \u2013 and they won\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019d support Brazil, because their fans speak the same language. I look forward to celebrating Portugal\u2019s victory with other fans. There\u2019s a big Portuguese community in London, and I remember them celebrating all down the South Lambeth Road last time we won the Euros \u2013 more than a thousand people singing and chanting. There are other Portuguese students at my school, so I\u2019ll make sure they\u2019ll all be supporting the team. If they won\u2019t, it\u2019s a disgrace! Qatar Ali Khalid Al-Mawlawi, 22  Ali is a third-year student studying law in London. After his degree, he plans to move back to Qatar to work in the energy sector. I\u2019ve been into football since I was born. Literally the first thing I ever wore was a tiny kit from one of the local teams. When I was younger, I used to mostly be a supporter of the Spanish league, but then I grew up and realised the English league is the best. I didn\u2019t want to be a glory-hunter, supporting United, for example, when Fergie was in charge \u2013 it was not what I stand for. So I tried to find a team I had a link with. My great-uncle studied in Durham in the 60s and 70s, and his team was Sunderland. He saw them win the FA Cup in 1973. So that\u2019s the team I chose. They\u2019re doing really well under their new French owner. They\u2019re in the championship and I hope they get the qualifiers this year. I haven\u2019t seen them play while I\u2019ve been in London \u2013 home games are four hours each way on the train, so I keep hoping they\u2019ll play a London team like QPR. I played a lot of football throughout my school years and was a junior varsity player. I\u2019ve been to a couple of tournaments abroad and dreamed of training at the Aspire Academy in Doha. I have cousins who are there, but my father wanted me to continue with my studies. But Qataris have a huge love for football \u2013 everyone in Doha has a fantasy league. Everyone!  When Qatar was announced as hosts in 2010, I was at my uncle\u2019s house watching with my cousins and we all ran out into the street \u2013 the whole neighbourhood seemed to be out there. It was beautiful. This is the national team\u2019s first time in the World Cup, but we\u2019ve been doing well under F\u00e9lix S\u00e1nchez. We had a great victory in 2019 at the Asian Cup. I\u2019ve been to many of the new stadiums, and actually volunteered for the Fifa Club World Cup and studied at Education City, where one of the stadiums is located. The country\u2019s infrastructure has developed at an insane rate over the past 10 years in the run-up to the tournament, and every time I go back to Doha for a vacation it feels like a different city \u2013 I keep getting lost. I\u2019m not blind to the controversies surrounding that, but I do think Qatar has come under the spotlight more than some nations that have hosted the World Cup, such as Russia, Brazil and South Africa. I do think the light that has been shone upon workers\u2019 rights in Qatar has led to positive changes, such as the abolition of the kafala system. I don\u2019t accept that most Qataris have a problem with people being gay either, it\u2019s more about public displays of affection in general. We are a conservative country and a new nation, and all we want is for people to be patient with us. I\u2019ll be watching most of the World Cup in London, though I have a ticket for the final in Qatar \u2013 I just need to get permission from my professor to go! We wish all the best for Saudis and Moroccans, too \u2013 it\u2019s beautiful to see Arabs doing well in football. And of course I\u2019ll be watching with lots of England supporters. It would be great if they bring it back home, because I want to see the English people happy. But on the down-low, I actually support Brazil. Saudi Arabia Rowaid Mohammed Islam, six  Rowaid was born in Saudi Arabia and moved to the UK with his parents four years ago. He lives in Sheffield I like to play football at school with my friends, Maxim and Popy. I\u2019m good at passing and I\u2019m a good goalkeeper \u2013 I save lots of balls. I might like to keep on playing when I\u2019m older and perhaps one day I could play for Saudi Arabia or England. I still visit Saudi Arabia and I have family and friends there, who I like playing ping pong with. I play ping pong all day. I\u2019m as good at that as I am at football. I\u2019m going to watch with Dad and Mummy, and we\u2019ll wear our Saudi Arabia football tops. I like that they\u2019re green! Senegal  Mark Mohammed Fall, 13  Mark Mohammed was born in Dakar, Senegal, and moved to London when he was very young. He last visited Senegal when he was eight or nine. He plays for a local team in east London, training two days a week, and is also a ballboy for Arsenal, who he also supports. My favourite thing about Senegal is the food. My dad and his friends often cook Senegalese food. I remember watching the Senegal-Japan game in 2018 in a restaurant with my dad and his friends.  I also remember the Colombia game \u2013 the saddest time during that World Cup for me. We got knocked out of the group because of too many yellow cards! We were tied on goal difference with Japan, I think, and points.  I haven\u2019t been able to watch any of Senegal\u2019s international games recently because it\u2019s very hard to find the right websites to watch them on. But I do always follow the live score updates.  I think we have a good chance this year \u2013 a lot of our players are playing in the top divisions and are on good form. I also like to see some of the older players like Messi and Neymar do really well during the World Cup because I grew up watching them. Serbia Eddie, four  Eddie\u2019s grandad is from Serbia and met his English grandmother in Paris in the 1970s. Grandad is a big Red Star Belgrade and Manchester United fan. Eddie started playing football in the U4 squad for his local grassroots team in Essex last year.  When it\u2019s not the World Cup and I watch football with Daddy, we have crisps. I support Serbia and England, and think they\u2019re both going to win. I quite like the trophy \u2013 it\u2019s gold and really shiny. I\u2019m going to put flags up in the window so everyone knows we support Serbia and England. Grandad and Uncle Rich live in Manchester, but when we score a goal I\u2019ll celebrate with them on the phone. And when we win, I\u2019ll run around like an aeroplane. South Korea Noah Ji-Ha Shin, 12  Noah is a keen goalkeeper who, like his dad, was born and raised in the UK. His mum is originally from South Korea.   It was so exciting when South Korea knocked out Germany in 2018. I remember everyone was celebrating, especially my mum, who was screaming at the TV and clapping her hands.My dad showed me a documentary about the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan, when they knocked out Italy. Ji-Sung Park was really good, and he played for Manchester United, who I support. The Korean crowds were so passionate, and my parents said the atmosphere was amazing. Because this tournament is happening during the winter we might watch it with our grandparents, who know nothing about football but love watching Korea play in the World Cup. They get really emotional and excited. Most of my family is in Korea, so I visit Seoul during summer holidays. We eat tasty Korean food and go mountain hiking, as my grandma loves it. She teaches me Korean before I go to sleep as I\u2019m so bad at it. I like how advanced the technology is in Seoul. Everything is so convenient. We even got served by robots in a noodle shop in Myeongdong! Spain Nico, six, and Candela Lorenzo, 16  Nico and Candela moved from Madrid to the UK with their Spanish parents in 2019. Nico was only three and considers himself \u201calmost British\u201d, though he supports Spain. He attends London\u2019s Spanish Way FC academy twice a week. Candela loves London and says she would no longer wish to live anywhere else, though both siblings enjoy visiting family in Spain in the summer and at Christmas. Candela is a more casual football player, but a talented one. Candela I remember Spain getting knocked out of the last World Cup by Russia. It was infuriating, as we played really well, but had bad luck when it ended in a penalty shootout. I actually cried. Nico I\u2019m too young to remember much from back then, but I get very excited when I watch La Roja play. Sometimes I shout at the TV and encourage the players \u2013 I tell them off as well when I think they deserve it.  Candela Our grandad and auntie are fans of Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid, and the rest of the family supports Real Madrid, so things can get argumentative. But when they wear the Spanish shirt, the whole family gets behind La Roja. Nico I just want them to score goals and I get frustrated if they don\u2019t. I think my sister is happy if they just play a good game. Candela We\u2019ll be watching the matches together at home and preparing some Spanish food or maybe pizza. If Spain wins we\u2019ll have a proper party \u2013 invite lots of Spanish friends round and really celebrate with a big meal. Nico I\u2019ll be jumping around like crazy and shouting if we win. I think she will too, actually. Switzerland Louis Hoogenboom, nine, Vincent Hoogenboom, 12, and Eliana Hoogenboom, 16  Eliana, Vincent and Louis live in St Albans, Hertfordshire. Their mother is from Switzerland and their father from the Netherlands. Eliana was born in Basel, her siblings were both born in the UK. All three speak Italian and Dutch. Vincent I remember some of the 2018 World Cup, particularly Switzerland vs Brazil. I felt great that they drew, as Brazil is one of the strongest teams. I was happy when they qualified this year, though they\u2019ll be facing a tough group with Brazil again and Serbia. Louis It\u2019s great to see Switzerland qualify, as it\u2019s a small country, but one of the best teams \u2013 we\u2019re 15th in the Fifa rankings. Eliana The Netherlands and England have qualified, too, so all the teams I support are taking part.  Louis I am looking forward to seeing Fabian Sch\u00e4r, because he\u2019s a great team player. I think Juergen Sommer has a great focus as a goalkeeper \u2013 he doesn\u2019t let through many balls! Vincent I want to see Renato Steffen as he plays for Lugano, a club in the Italian-speaking part of Switzerland, where our mum is from. Eliana I hope we watch it with other Swiss people and maybe have raclette, a traditional melted-cheese dish. It\u2019s always nice to celebrate with other people. Vincent I was born in England, but feel very connected to Switzerland, as half of my extended family lives there \u2013 I still have two great-grandmothers. I speak weekly with my friend from Ticino [a Swiss-Italian canton], and we were recently chatting about the 1-1 draw between Switzerland and Italy in the World Cup qualifiers that prevented Italy qualifying for the World Cup. Louis I love going to Switzerland to see my family and my friends \u2013 we go there every summer and most winters. I like skiing. In Switzerland you can have the tastiest crisps in the world, especially the paprika-flavoured ones. Eliana All my friends support England, so if they ever play against Switzerland there would definitely be some friendly tension. But if Switzerland win, I would still be able to celebrate with my friends. Louis I would play my trumpet. Tunisia Ozan \u00d6zkan, 14, Haydar \u00d6zkan, 16  Haydar and \u201cOzzie\u201d were born in the UK \u2013 their mother is Tunisian and their father was Turkish (their cousin is Love Island winner Ekin-Su C\u00fclc\u00fclo\u011flu). They speak both Arabic and Turkish \u201ca little\u201d. Haydar We lived in Tunisia for about 18 months five or six years back. Ozzie We used to play football there, but we don\u2019t really any more. I was in a club for a while and played with friends \u2013 at school I\u2019d be playing every day at lunch. Haydar It\u2019s very competitive in Tunisia. The kids are always trying to trick each other during every game. It\u2019s a real challenge. Ozzie I don\u2019t think we have any friends in the UK who are supporting Tunisia \u2013 they\u2019re keeping it quiet if they do! USA Katherine Demetris, 17  Katherine was born in London in 2004, but both her parents are American. They met in London after moving to the UK in 1991, and Katherine is the youngest of their four children. Her brothers are back in the US, working or at university, and Katherine intends to attend university in the US too. My family has lived in London my whole life, and my siblings and I attended the American School in London (ASL) from the age of four \u2013 I\u2019m in my last year. I started playing football (or soccer, as we call it at ASL) when I was six.  It was hard to find an all-girls team when I was young, so I played with my brother until I joined Kinja FC, where I played from age eight to 15. Then I played on the varsity team of ASL from freshman year until now. I am privileged to be one of the captains. Before coming to ASL, and moving to Maida Vale, we lived in Chelsea, very near Stamford Bridge, so we became avid Chelsea fans. I\u2019ve also always followed the US women\u2019s team and was lucky to see them play in Paris in 2019 with my mom. I went with some of my teammates to see them play against England at Wembley in October \u2013 it was an incredible atmosphere and a great match. I\u2019m inspired by the level of women\u2019s football now and it\u2019s exciting to watch England playing so well. Being a dual citizen, I truly support both the US and England. During the 2018 World Cup, I was in Florida for the summer with my brothers and watched all the matches, supporting England all the way. We were heartbroken for them in the semi-final loss to Croatia. I am so pleased the US men\u2019s team qualified. I am bummed that the US and England are in the same pool, but I\u2019m confident they\u2019ll both be in the last 16! Uruguay Nacho Godoy, 11, and Camilo Godoy, 13  Budding footballers Camilo and Nacho live in West Wickham. They were born in the UK to a Uruguayan dad and an English mum. Their brother Santino is five, and keener on Lego than football. Camilo I remember going to a Brazilian restaurant in London to watch Uruguay v Italy for the 2014 World Cup with my dad\u2019s friends. When Godin scored to make it 1-0, the scenes were amazing. I also saw the Uruguay v Brazil friendly at the Emirates in 2018. Amazingly, they let my dad in with his candombe drum and he was on TV holding it up in the crowd.  Nacho I went to watch Uruguay in Cardiff for the Olympics in 2012, but I was just a baby so I don\u2019t remember anything. My parents invited the whole Olympic delegation to our house for an asado (barbecue) a few weeks later. The footballers had already gone home but most of the athletes took a train from the Olympic village to our house. Wherever we are in the world, if Uruguay are playing, my dad finds somewhere to watch it. There\u2019s a photo of me and Cami in San Sebasti\u00e1n in Spain in our Uruguay shirts watching a Copa Am\u00e9rica match. The Uruguayans we know in England are all friends my dad has made since living here. They are incredibly fun. The thing I like about Uruguayan culture is that kids are allowed to go to parties, and there is always barbecued meat and somebody ready to kick a football around.  Camilo For the 2014 World Cup, we often had parties at our house for all the Uruguayans in London. As it was summer, we would always have an asado. My grandad is English, and he came to watch Uruguay beat England at our house. We watched the 2018 World Cup at home because my dad was lucky enough to travel to Russia. The atmosphere wasn\u2019t the same without all the Uruguayans who usually descend on our house. When we watch Uruguay at home, we put on our shirts and decorate the house with flags. My dad loves to play the candombe drums and sing. There are videos of us as kids singing traditional football songs like Soy Celeste and banging on drums. This year we will be in Uruguay for the semi-finals onwards. Hopefully we will be watching them play the final with friends and family in Montevideo!  If Uruguay play England, I\u2019ll always support Uruguay, but if they\u2019re knocked out my support will shift to England. Wales Catrin Webb, 15, and Rhys Webb, 18  Rhys and Catrin\u2019s parents moved to south London from Crickhowell in the Brecon Beacons in 1995. Prior to that, their dad played in the Welsh Premier League for Ebbw Vale \u2013 he is now an acting head teacher, having started out in London teaching PE. The siblings regularly visit Wales, where most of their family still live. Catrin It\u2019s great that Wales qualified, but it\u2019s a pity we didn\u2019t get into the Women\u2019s World Cup. Female football doesn\u2019t get quite the same recognition, and it would have been good to promote the Welsh women\u2019s team. Rhys I\u2019d rather have qualified by beating Scotland than Ukraine. They\u2019ve robbed us of a few playoffs, especially since the 1977 Joe Jordan handball! I\u2019ve watched footage of the Wales v Brazil quarter-final game that got Wales knocked out of the 1958 World Cup \u2013 the goal was scored by a very young Pel\u00e9. Catrin There are some great players in the team. Like most Welsh people, I love Gareth Bale. But we couldn\u2019t have got there without Aaron Ramsey, Joe Allen and Chris Gunter. Rhys Some people say Gareth\u2019s lost his legs though, so to be successful in this World Cup we\u2019re going to need younger players like Neco Williams and Ethan Ampadu to showcase their talent and bring a breath of fresh air. Catrin We\u2019ve got the games in the diary already. First game against USA, then Iran the following week, then England. Rhys That\u2019s the big game, the England one. We should have people round, though it depends how we do in the two before it. Catrin It\u2019s a risk having English people round. You know: if you win, it\u2019s great; if you lose \u2026 Rhys Yeah, that\u2019s going to be miserable. Catrin It\u2019s a shame that, after 64 years, the chance of seeing Wales play live in a World Cup means having to travel to Qatar. I don\u2019t think we should support a country that\u2019s so homophobic and where women don\u2019t really have rights. Rhys I\u2019d still like to go. I mean, it\u2019s Wales in the World Cup! But it\u2019s a shame to think fans will be travelling over and not experiencing the same atmosphere our dad did when he went to Bordeaux in 2016 and saw Wales win for the first time in the Euros, against Slovakia \u2013 30,000 Welsh fans going nuts! \u2022 Research: Kitty Drake Additional research: Sundus Abdi, Francesca Hughes.

                    "body": "\u201cAzmoun and Taremi get Iranians dreaming,\u201d was the headline for an article on Fifa\u2019s website after \u201cTeam Melli\u201d were drawn to face England in their first match of the 2022 World Cup. Just a few months on and with the team\u2019s star strikers at loggerheads over the future of coach, Dragan Skocic, however, it\u2019s not exactly been the preparation Iran supporters had hoped for as the squad attempt to make history by progressing past the group stage in Qatar. Six days after being dismissed amid reports that the Iranian Football Federation (IFF) wanted to appoint a homegrown coach, the Croat was controversially reinstated last weekend on a technicality because the federation realised it didn\u2019t have the authority to dismiss him until it holds elections for a new president at the end of next month.  The volte-face was welcomed by Sardar Azmoun, the Bayer Leverkusen forward who retired from international football at the age of 23 in 2018 after facing heavy criticism from supporters, only to return a few months later. \u201cWe are members of the national team of Islamic Republic of Iran,\u201d he wrote on Instagram. \u201cWe thank Iran for the efforts and support of the government officials in the direction of all-round support for the national team. We announce that in the current situation, we will work together with the technical staff to make the hearts of the Iranian people happy in the Qatar World Cup, and trust us and the national team in this critical and short period. The World Cup should be fully supported. @teammellifootball We, the players, ask you not to change anything, let\u2019s leave everything for after the World Cup.\u201d  A few hours later, Mehdi Taremi \u2013 the Porto striker who scored a brilliant overhead kick against Chelsea that was voted Champions League goal of the season in 2021 \u2013 responded with an angry message that said Azmoun had spoken out \u201cwithout consent\u201d and \u201cagainst our wishes\u201d. \u201cIt is disrespectful to the national team to issue statements in the name of the national team based on the personal interests of some players and causing the team to be divided,\u201d he wrote. \u201cDenying the current difficult situation that the national team is facing only increases the mountain of our problems.\u201d Taremi\u2019s message was shared and liked by the captain, Alireza Jahanbakhsh, the former Brighton forward who plays for Feyenoord, and several other senior players. Taremi, Jahanbakhsh, and the AEK Athens duo Ehsan Hajsafi and Karim Ansarifard had been among a group of senior players who met the Iranian sports minister during their training camp in Qatar last month to demand that Skocic be removed from his post.  \u201cThey would never have dared to do something like that to Carlos Queiroz,\u201d says Shaygan Banisaeid, a coach for Arsenal\u2019s Football in the Community scheme who came to England from Iran in 2019, referencing the national team\u2019s former coach. \u201cAfter that, the team went into two groups. One led by Azmoun, with the younger players who have been given their chance by Skocic and are happy with him. Then there are the more experienced players with European experience who want to make a change. Unity used to be one of the team\u2019s biggest strengths but we don\u2019t have that any more.\u201d Elections for president take place on 30 August and Skocic\u2019s position is expected to come under more pressure before the next training camp in September. Meanwhile, Ole Gunnar Solsjk\u00e6r has been among those linked to the post along with Ali Daei, the former striker who saw Cristiano Ronaldo take his all-time international goalscoring record last year, even though Daei has not managed for three years and has said he is not interested in taking over.  Queiroz is Iran\u2019s longest-serving manager after leading them to creditable World Cup campaigns in Russia, where they only just missed out on the last 16 after drawing with his native Portugal, and Brazil. He is available having left his post with Egypt despite leading them to the final of the Africa Cup of Nations in February, although many feel nationality could count against Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s former assistant. \u201cThis is the opinion that some people have,\u201d says Banisaeid. \u201cThey believe that the Iranian government wants to play at the World Cup against its political opponents England and USA with an Iranian coach so they can show that we are a proud nation fighting against our big rivals with our own people.\u201d  Skocic was appointed in early February 2020 to replace the former Belgium manager Marc Wilmots and has won 15 of his 18 matches. Yet Iran managed only a draw and a defeat against South Korea in qualifying despite topping their group and lost to Algeria\u2019s second-string in June. The cancellation of a friendly against Canada after that country\u2019s government decided that \u201cthe untenable geopolitical situation of hosting Iran [had become] significantly divisive\u201d has left the team significantly short of match practice. \u201cIt\u2019s a big dilemma: can they continue with Dragan Skoic if he isn\u2019t going to be able to unite the players? asks Banisaeid, who has also coached at Fulham and Middlesbrough. \u201cThis will be our third World Cup in a row and there was lots of optimism when we saw the draw that this could be a good chance to get through the group. Even though some people may have underestimated the USA and Wales, everyone thought we could do something in Qatar. But now everyone is so disappointed and there is not much hope among the public. It\u2019s heartbreaking for the nation.\u201d"

                    "body": "El Hadji Diouf has accused England of believing they have already beaten Senegal and warned that could lead to another famous World Cup victory for his country.\nDiouf, who was part of the Senegal team that defeated France at the 2002 tournament, is an assistant coach with the squad preparing to meet England in Sunday\u2019s last-16 tie in Qatar. He was complimentary about Gareth Southgate\u2019s side but feels they are guilty of complacency.\n\u201cI never say Senegal can\u2019t win,\u201d the former Liverpool forward said. \u201cIt reminds me of when we play against France: they win the game before they play it and I think England today do the same thing, which is good for us.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have anything to show the world. If you see our squad, we have \u00c9douard Mendy, we have Kalidou Koulibaly [both Chelsea], we have a lot of good players in England. Some play in the Championship but they are really Premier League players, like Isma\u00efla Sarr [of Watford]. It\u2019s for them to show how good they are.\n\u201cIt is a wonderful draw \u2014 who would not want to play this game? The players are excited. Talking to the boys it\u2019s about big games, big players, they have to show how good they are. And definitely, this game is going to be very exciting because England have a good team, good players. I know we are not the favourites but we are going to do everything to beat them and the players can do it.\u201d\n\nDiouf said the pressure was all on Southgate\u2019s men. \u201cDefinitely yes. England have to [win] but we have to show them that the game is not finished before we play. These boys are ready. They work hard in training, we have a good spirit and just need to keep going.\u201d\nDiouf, whose former clubs also include Bolton, Leeds, Sunderland and Blackburn, believes England have changed their approach. \u201cThey all copy \u2013 the national team as well \u2013 Pep Guardiola and Man City. They play the same way: they want the ball and score a lot of goals and play tiki-taka.\n\u201c[The] players can do it as well, they have a good team and a very good team spirit. It\u2019s not like the Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard time \u2013 the two of them don\u2019t like each other \u2013 it\u2019s about team spirit and Gareth Southgate did a great job.\u201d\nSenegal won the Africa Cup of Nations on penalties in February and Diouf is confident they can beat England the same way. \u201cWe are always going to win on penalties,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we get to penalties we\u2019re going to win it. Easy. I know the goalkeeper we\u2019ve got [Mendy] and I know we can stop some of their penalties.\u201d"

Coman, Dayot Upamecano and Adrien Rabiot missed France\u2019s semi-final victory against Morocco on Wednesday and the situation worsened when Varane and Konat\u00e9 were forced to skip training on Friday.\nFrance, who also had injury concerns over Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni and Theo Hernandez, responded by implementing increased hygiene measures and urging players to wash their hands. Didier Deschamps, who had Upamecano and Rabiot back in training on Friday, could not afford to lose more players.\n\nHowever, their hopes of beating Argentina were boosted when all 24 of their players reported for training on Saturday night. Varane, Coman and Konat\u00e9 rejoined their teammates, while Hernandez and Tchouam\u00e9ni were also back.\n\u201cOn the virus, you are never really prepared for that type of thing,\u201d France\u2019s captain and goalkeeper, Hugo Lloris, said. \u201cBut we are trying to get ready for this match as well as we can. We remain focused.\u201d\nInjuries have been an issue for Deschamps before and during this tournament. France have been without the injured Presnel Kimpembe, Paul Pogba, N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9, Christopher Nkunku and Karim Benzema. They also lost their first-choice left-back, Lucas Hernandez, to a serious knee injury in their opening game.\n\nYet they have managed to overcome their misfortune by reaching the final. Their attack has functioned without Benzema. There were suggestions earlier this week that the Real Madrid striker could fly back to Qatar to join the squad for the final following his recovery from a torn thigh muscle, but Deschamps does not sound enamoured with that idea.\nFrance\u2019s head coach has even indicated that he has no interest in whether Benzema, whose place has been taken by Olivier Giroud, supports the team from the stands.\n\u201cSome players have been injured and Karim Benzema is one of them and Lucas Hernandez got injured in the first game,\u201d Deschamps said. \u201cFrom that point on I have 24 players in my squad and they are the ones at my disposal, so I don\u2019t think it is fair to those players to ask about players who aren\u2019t here. It is not up to me to decide who comes to watch the game \u2013 former players or injured players.\u201d"
