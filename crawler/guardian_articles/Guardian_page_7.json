                    "body": "Gareth Southgate said that England regained their belief during their 3-3 draw with Germany and are better equipped to handle the pressure of a World Cup, after putting their woes behind them by closing their disappointing Nations League campaign with an improved attacking display.\nEngland\u2019s manager was heartened to see his team mount a stirring fightback from 2-0 down at Wembley, only for Nick Pope to gift Kai Havertz a late equaliser, and he praised his players for sticking together after a horrible run of form.\n\nSouthgate was entitled to feel optimistic about his side\u2019s performance in their final game before Qatar, even though Germany\u2019s first two goals stemmed from defensive errors by Harry Maguire. England, whose six-match winless run is their worst since 1993, responded superbly after falling behind. Luke Shaw dragged them back into it by ended the side\u2019s run of 565 minutes without a goal from open play, Mason Mount scored a fine equaliser and the stadium was bouncing after Harry Kane put England ahead from the spot.\n\u201cThe players have been fantastic in the last few days,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cThey have taken some individual responsibility, collectively talked in the group and the whole experience has been one we needed to grow the team.\n\u201cWe are going to have pressure in a World Cup. You can try and avoid it but it is coming so better we feel it and learn how to deal with it.\n\u201cThe players reacted in the right way when Germany scored. We showed character but also a lot of quality and I think the crowd also came with us and stayed with us. Even at 0-2, they didn\u2019t get on their back and that was so important for us.\n\u201cWe scored and the roof almost lifted off and we all remember what it feels like for a goal to go in. Then we had an absolute punch on the nose at the end. I am sure everyone here was not enamoured by rewriting three match reports but I was not chuffed myself.\u201d\nSouthgate, who was delighted with Jude Bellingham\u2019s performance in midfield, saw positive signs in attack. He has been criticised for being too cautious, but he changed the game by making positive substitutions when England were trailing, Mount and Bukayo Saka giving the team fresh impetus after coming off the bench.\n\n\u201cEight hours ago not everything was wrong and now not everything is right clearly but the areas we weren\u2019t delivering in the top end of the pitch look much brighter,\u201d Southgate said.\n\u201cThe fact we scored three and looked dangerous is really important for the players. They have had to work that through and some of the senior players have been outstanding.\n\u201cOne of the things they asked was could they have a meeting on their own to talk things through and for me that was such a positive sign. There are moments at some clubs where that is not such a positive sign. But they talked that through with me. The best teams have a core of players that drive things.\n\u201cWe need to stay calm. It is the message that we have to stick to what we are doing. We believe in what we are doing and I think the players took that on board and recognised that we are only a few months from the World Cup. We can talk about team spirit when things are going well but the true test is in adversity.\u201d\nSouthgate, who has concerns over John Stones after the defender limped off with a thigh strain in the first half, defended Maguire after the centre-back produced another shaky display. He gave away the penalty that allowed Ilkay Gundogan to put Germany ahead and was at fault when Havertz made it 2-0. Pope, who deputised for the injured Jordan Pickford, was also jittery in goal and gifted Havertz his second goal."

                    "body": "  10.11pm    More reaction and analysis:        9.32pm    David Hytner was at Al Bayt Stadium. Here\u2019s his report. Congratulations to France for making it through to a semi-final with Morocco; commiserations to England, who gave an excellent account of themselves tonight, as well as throughout the tournament; and thanks to you for reading this MBM. Nighty night.      9.30pm    Gareth Southgate speaks to ITV. \u201cOur performance deserved better. Goals are decisive, but I\u2019ve just said to the players, I don\u2019t think they could have given any more. I think they played really well against a top team. There are fine margins, things at both ends that have ended up deciding the game, but the way the players have progressed as a group through this tournament has been fantastic. In most of the big moments we were in the right place. We had more shots on goal. But it\u2019s a game of fine margins.\u201d What about the referee? \u201cIt\u2019s pointless me going into that. I\u2019d rather talk about our players. Congratulations to France, they know they\u2019ve been in a hell of a game. We\u2019ve given a top team a game. I really don\u2019t think we could have done any more.\u201d As for Kane\u2019s miss? \u201cFor me, we win and lose as a team. We\u2019ve let a couple of goals in, and missed a few chances. So he\u2019s been incredible for us, so reliable in those sort of situations. We wouldn\u2019t be here but for the number of goals he\u2019s scored for us.\u201d A missed opportunity? \u201cWe were here to try to win the tournament. We had the belief that we could, and we showed in our performance tonight against the reigning champions, that we have a team that could have done that. \u2026 and finally, is he staying until Euro 2024, as per his contract? \u201cAfter every tournament we\u2019ve reviewed and reflected. We need a little bit of time to make sure that everyone makes the right decisions.\u201d     9.20pm    This is the semi-final line-up, then. England and their fans will understandably demur right now, but that\u2019s an exciting prospect. In 2018, all four semi-finalists were European; this time round, South America and, for the first time, Africa are represented. The World Cup, right here!  Tue 13: Argentina v Croatia (7pm GMT, Lusail Iconic Stadium) Wed 14: France v Morocco (7pm GMT, Al Bayt Stadium)      9.14pm    Jordan Henderson talks to ITV. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to sum it up now, straight after the game. It\u2019s difficult to find the right words. I thought we\u2019d given everything. We were disappointed to go 1-0 down but our character and mentality to keep going and find the equaliser \u2026 unfortunately it wasn\u2019t our night.\u201d On the missed penalty: \u201cWe know how many penalties Harry Kane has scored for us. He scored the first one. How many goals he\u2019s contributed for us to even get here. He\u2019ll be stronger for it in the long run, I\u2019m sure. He\u2019s a world-class striker and our captain. We wouldn\u2019t be here without him.\u201d Was this a big chance missed? \u201cProbably, yeah. Unfortunately it wasn\u2019t our night. You have to give credit to France, who are a good team, but I still felt it was there for us to win tonight.\u201d     9.05pm    Poor Kane. He\u2019s battling hard against the tears, which surely will come at some point tonight. Sooner rather than later. Bellingham looks distraught and is consoled by Aaron Ramsdale, then Gareth Southgate, who also spends a few minutes hugging his captain. Southgate knows a thing or two about missing crucial penalties, Euro 96 and all that, so he\u2019ll be a rock for Kane, who is a study in utter desolation right now. He trudges off down the tunnel. Meanwhile France cavort in delight, as well they might! They\u2019re still on course to be the first country to retain the World Cup since Brazil in 1962. It won\u2019t feel much of a consolation right now, but England have lost to a brilliant side.    Updated at 9.21pm GMT    9.02pm   FULL TIME: England 1-2 France  The reigning champions are through to the semi-finals! They\u2019ll face Morocco on Wednesday evening. England meanwhile will be going home. Harry Kane drops to his haunches and buries his head away.   Updated at 9.22pm GMT    9.01pm    90 min +11: Rashford whips a wonderful free kick over the wall and back down towards the top-right corner \u2026 but not back down quite enough. The ball clears the bar and settles on the top of the netting, and that\u2019s surely that.     9.00pm    90 min +10: As you\u2019d expect, it takes France a while to sort out their wall. Rashford is made to wait to take.     8.59pm    90 min +9: There\u2019s going to be one last chance for England! A hail Mary is hoofed into the box. France don\u2019t make a challenge \u2026 until Maguire, of all people, dribbles across the face of the penalty box and, on the edge of the D, is upended by Coman. Free kick in a very promising position!     8.58pm    90 min +8: Mbappe dribbles down the left and looks to have been clipped by Sterling. He wants the free kick, but the Random Decision Generator says no.     8.57pm    90 min +7: Stones looked in big trouble for a while there, so it\u2019s good to see him back up and trotting to the sidelines. But he won\u2019t continue, because he\u2019s sacrificed for Grealish. One last roll of the dice.     8.56pm    90 min +6: Stones challenges for a high ball with Giroud. He lands awkwardly and goes down in pain. On comes the trainer.     8.55pm    90 min +5: Shaw loops a ball in from the left. Way too high, and that\u2019s easy pickings for Lloris. Down he goes again, and time continues to do its relentless thing.     8.54pm    90 min +4: Sterling busies himself down the right but Hernandez stays strong and refuses to let him pass, before blasting the ball back into England\u2019s half.     8.53pm    90 min +3: Sterling swings a cross in from the right. An easy claim for Lloris, who then does the Pickfordian thing of flopping down on the ground with the ball to eat up some precious seconds.     8.52pm    90 min +2: Shaw crosses from the left. Lloris flaps and concedes a corner. Shaw goes across to take the corner from the right. Upamecano blooters a header clear. The tension is palpable. A place in the World Cup semi-finals up for grabs right here!     8.51pm    90 min +1: Griezmann swings a free kick into the England mixer from the left. Rashford clears. Mbappe comes back at England down the left. Walker and Sterling do enough to stop his gallop. Here\u2019s Peter Oh: \u201cI think the time has come for Gareth Southgate to ask, \u2018Will the English Wout Weghorst please stand up?\u2019.\u201d     8.50pm    90 min: This isn\u2019t over yet \u2026 by a long chalk, because there will be eight added minutes.     8.50pm    89 min: An irate Maguire is booked for elbowing Griezmann in the back of the neck. The referee\u2019s performance tonight has been idiosyncratic, to say the very least, but that was a no-brainer.      8.48pm    89 min: Mount buys a ticket for the lottery from the best part of 30 yards. The ball sails serenely into the stand.     8.48pm    88 min: Nope. The delivery is no good. France clear their lines, and the clock ticks on. \u201cSomeone asked why more players don\u2019t just put their laces through the ball and smash it. That\u2019s why.\u201d Adam Becker there, because somebody had to say it.     8.47pm    87 min: Mount draws another foul, this time out on the right touchline. He\u2019ll take this one himself. England load the box. All set up for Kane\u2019s redemption?     8.46pm    85 min: I\u2019m not sure anybody in the entire stadium believes what they\u2019ve just seen. Kane \u2013 who would have become England\u2019s record goalscorer had he slotted \u2013 looks utterly stunned. So does everyone else. Usually so reliable! Wow. Rashford comes on for Foden.     8.44pm    84 min: Oh my! Kane puts his foot through the ball again \u2026 only to blaze wildly over the bar! It\u2019s not quite Waddle-esque \u2026 but it\u2019s not that far off. Oh Harry.    Updated at 8.57pm GMT    8.43pm    83 min: It\u2019s Kane versus Lloris part two. An interminable, nerve-wracked wait. Here we go!     8.42pm   Penalty for England!  82 min: The referee goes over to have a look at the monitor \u2026 then comes back and points to the spot! Hernandez is only booked, as Mount wasn\u2019t in control of the ball and therefore no scoring opportunity was denied. England are furious France aren\u2019t down to ten \u2026 but at least they\u2019ve got a chance to save themselves!   Updated at 8.51pm GMT    8.41pm    80 min: Mount is immediately into the thick of it, chasing a long pass down the inside-left channel. Hernandez comes across and barges him from the side \u2026 but also from the behind. Just inside the box. VAR could be interested in this, you know!  Updated at 8.41pm GMT    8.40pm    79 min: England respond by making a double change: Henderson and Saka off, Mount and Sterling on.     8.39pm   GOAL! England 1-2 France (Giroud 78)  England half clear the corner. The ball\u2019s worked left to Griezmann, who powerfully curls towards the near post at mid-height. Giroud gets in ahead of Maguire and though he doesn\u2019t make perfect contact, smashes a header into the bottom left. Pickford, the hero seconds ago, had no chance!    Updated at 8.50pm GMT    8.37pm    77 min: Pickford makes an outstanding point-blank save! A cross into the England box from the left. It\u2019s cushioned back into the centre from the right. Giroud flashes a volley towards the bottom left, but the keeper gets a strong hand to palm out for a corner. However \u2026     8.36pm    75 min: France haven\u2019t showed much in attack lately, but now Hernandez crosses from the left. Giroud flashes a header wide right from ten yards. Chance. A few seconds earlier, Shaw had run into the back of Giroud, causing him to fall to the ground in the box. He made a half-arsed claim for a penalty, but nobody was listening.     8.34pm    74 min: England remain on top. A throw in from the right. Bellingham tries to spin Upamecano and falls into the box. He wants a penalty, and there was a little bit of contact, but the referee remains unmoved. That was much more ambiguous than the earlier challenge on Kane, to be fair.     8.32pm    72 min: Shaw works his way down the left and curls low. Saka races in from the right and prepares to blast home \u2026 only for Hernandez to get in the road and somehow deflect the ball wide left. In fact, the ball may have pinged back off Saka, because England don\u2019t get the corner. They\u2019re looking the more likely right now!     8.31pm    70 min: Henderson curls the free kick into the box. Maguire rises highest, ten yards out. His header isn\u2019t the most powerful, but it drops towards the bottom-left corner \u2026 only to shave the outside of the post. Goal kick. Lloris probably had that covered, though you wouldn\u2019t bet your last bronze centime on it. So close!   Updated at 8.39pm GMT    8.29pm    69 min: Saka is wrestled to the floor by Hernandez out on the England right. He gets the free kick this time. England line up on the edge of the French box. Henderson prepares to take.     8.28pm    68 min: Mbappe floats a diagonal pass towards Dembele, just inside the England box on the right. Everyone expects a creamed volley, but Dembele instead attempts a cushioned pass infield to \u2026 nobody in particular.     8.26pm    66 min: Saka is kicked on the heel by Rabiot but the referee waves play on. Saka and Bellingham are fuming. France meanwhile counter, and Tchouameni shovels a pass down the inside-left channel for Giroud, who extends a leg but can\u2019t keep the ball from going out for a goal kick. He takes a while to get back up, having landed awkwardly. But back up he eventually gets.     8.25pm    64 min: Neither coach is yet to blink. No sign of much movement on the benches. This game really is poised rather entertainingly.     8.23pm    62 min: Griezmann barges Foden over illegally. He\u2019s already on a yellow, and could now be in the last-chance saloon. Take care, Antoine.     8.22pm    61 min: England recover their poise, Saka then Kane testing Lloris from just inside the area. Both shots are weak, and the France captain passes the test easily. This game is very much in the balance.     8.21pm    59 min: \u201cThere have been some truly awful penalties in this World Cup,\u201d notes Matt Dony. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to be said for simply leathering the ball. Kane hits penalties so hard. Why don\u2019t all players do that?\u201d Yes, there was no hint of a Mulligan and O\u2019Hare-style tippy-toes run-up for that one. Kane knows what he\u2019s doing from 12 yards all right.      8.18pm    58 min: England calm things down a little bit, taking their sweet time over a goal kick. Wise move, having lost the run of themselves for a couple of minutes after the equaliser. \u201cI\u2019m thinking we should all just pay Andrew Benton to stay at the Co-op for the entire match,\u201d writes Kaarin Michaelsen. \u201cWho\u2019s with me?\u201d     8.17pm    56 min: Mbappe turns on the jets and romps down the left. He whizzes past Walker with absurd ease. He cuts back, hoping to tee up Dembele, free on the penalty spot, but the ball goes behind his team-mate. Dembele can\u2019t keep the attack going. Some response from France to falling behind!     8.14pm    55 min: That\u2019s Kane\u2019s 53rd goal for England. He now ties Wayne Rooney as England\u2019s all-time leading scorer! France then nearly retake the lead immediately, Rabiot racing into acres down the middle and volleying a shot towards the bottom right. Pickford gets down well this time! He parries clear, a brilliant save.  Updated at 8.15pm GMT    8.14pm   GOAL! England 1-1 France (Kane 54 pen)  It\u2019s an all-Spurs showdown: Kane versus Lloris. A nervous pause. Kane re-spots the ball \u2026 and powers a penalty into the left-hand side of the net, having sent Lloris the other way!    Updated at 8.19pm GMT    8.12pm   Penalty for England!  52 min: Saka dribbles in from the right flank again. He makes it into the box. Tchouameni hangs out a leg and brings him down. The referee points to the spot this time!   Updated at 8.27pm GMT    8.11pm    51 min: Saka dribbles dangerously in from the right wing, but just as things look like opening up for him, he hesitates and the chance is gone. But no matter, because \u2026     8.11pm    50 min: Griezmann swings it in. Maguire clears. Kane chases after the ball in the hope of launching a counter, but doesn\u2019t get there.     8.09pm    49 min: Mbappe steams past Henderson on the left flank and is clipped on the ankle. A free kick in a dangerous position. France load the box.     8.09pm    48 min: Foden hits the corner long. Lloris flaps, but Maguire can\u2019t head into the empty net at the far post. Lloris takes his second chance to snaffle the ball.     8.08pm    47 min: \u2026 but Bellingham gets back up, and that ankle looks just fine, because the resulting free kick is worked to the edge of the D, where he pearls a stunning rising shot goalwards. It\u2019s heading in, but Lloris fingertips over the bar. What a screamer! What a save!     8.06pm    46 min: Dembele comes sliding in on Bellingham, and goes into the book as a result. Bellingham stays down, having rolled his ankle.      8.05pm    England get the party started again. No changes \u2026 and here\u2019s some hope for England, courtesy of Andrew Benton: \u201cEnormous thanks to Jo Gray and Andrew McGuire for the brilliant set-piece set-up. I\u2019m off the the Co-op, back in 22 or so mins. Please cross fingers.\u201d   Updated at 8.10pm GMT    8.04pm    Controversy dept. For the record, on ITV, all three pundits \u2013 Roy Keane, Ian Wright and Gary Neville \u2013 think Saka was fouled in the build-up to the goal, and that Kane should have been awarded a penalty. But here we all are.     7.53pm   Who do you support?  Before you reach for the half-time oranges, please consider supporting Guardian journalism like this, for three reasons: \u2022 We are independent - no one tells us what we can and can\u2019t publish (and that includes Fifa)\u2022 We rely on readers funding us to keep us independent\u2022 We give you the full picture - the excitement on the pitch and the shame, corruption and injustice off it Support the Guardian today \u2013 it only takes a minute. Thank you.     7.52pm   HALF TIME: England 0-1 France  At the break, Tchouam\u00e9ni\u2019s fine long-range daisycutter is the difference. England think it should have been chalked off for a foul earlier in the move on Saka, and surround the referee as everyone walks down the tunnel. Or maybe they\u2019re discussing the non-award of a penalty for Upamecano\u2019s tangle with Kane. Or perhaps both incidents. Either way, they\u2019ll need to find something in the second half. As things stand, it\u2019ll be France facing Morocco on Wednesday evening!  Updated at 7.54pm GMT    7.50pm    45 min +4: Foden hits the corner way too long. Hernandez and Bellingham contest the loose ball, the former coming off worst. Hernandez gets back up gingerly, but he looks good to continue.     7.48pm    45 min +3: Shaw creams a long ball down the left. It\u2019s pretty aimless, truth be told, but Kounde clumsily allows it to clank off his head and out for a bonus corner for England.     7.47pm    45 min +2: France stroke it around the middle of the park in the patient style.     7.46pm    45 min +1: The first of four additional minutes.     7.45pm    45 min: Bellingham makes a little time and space for himself down the left by dropping a shoulder and gliding past Kounde. He crosses low hoping to find Kane, but there are too many blue shirts around. France clear their lines again.     7.44pm    43 min: Griezmann goes into the book for repeated fouling. The straw that broke the camel\u2019s back: a cynical clip on Walker in the midfield.     7.43pm    42 min: Mbappe tries to spin Stones down the left but is brushed to the ground spectacularly \u2026 and legally. The referee tells Mbappe to get up as Stones strides off with the ball. The England fans enjoyed that.   Updated at 7.54pm GMT    7.41pm    41 min: Bellingham and Henderson combine well down the right, cutting back down the flank for Saka, who looks long for Kane. The England captain is bustled out of it at the far post, and France clear. It\u2019s not as though England have failed to ask France a few questions.     7.40pm    39 min: A big chance for Mbappe to double France\u2019s lead. He\u2019s fouled by Henderson, and the resulting free kick is worked to Hernandez down the left. Hernandez pulls back low, and Mbappe sends a first-time effort from the penalty spot miles over the bar. Not the easiest of chances for Joe Public, but this is Mbappe we\u2019re talking about, and the look on his face suggests he felt he should have done better.     7.39pm    38 min: A replay of the goal. Pickford certainly went down late, but he was almost certainly unsighted by Bellingham, whose legs Tchouameni\u2019s shot whistled between.     7.37pm    37 min: Varane launches a long pass down the left for Mbappe, but Walker comes across to intercept and send the ball back safely to Pickford.     7.35pm    35 min: Dembele slides a pass down the right for Griezmann, who looks to make it into the penalty box but is brushed off the ball by the all-action Bellingham.     7.34pm    33 min: Ah, here he is. Bellingham passes carelessly straight to the France star. Mbappe dribbles his way down the left, but runs into a cul-de-sac as Walker and Bellingham, the latter tracking back to make up for his mistake, double up to stop him.     7.32pm    32 min: Mbappe\u2019s been very quiet. Almost too quiet.     7.30pm    30 min: Foden takes the corner. The ball drops in the six-yard box, and gets stuck in the middle of a comic-book cloud with loads of boots and fists sticking out of it. A sausage on a fork as well. Kane can\u2019t battle his way through the bedlam to poke home, and France eventually sort their collective feet out to hack clear.   Updated at 7.37pm GMT    7.29pm    29 min: Some space for Kane, the best part of 30 yards out. He takes aim for the top right. Lloris parries around the post for a corner, a fine save given the shot took a little deflection.   Updated at 8.02pm GMT    7.28pm    28 min: England have responded really well to conceding the opening goal. France haven\u2019t done a great deal since. Here\u2019s Richard Hirst: \u201cI thought at first that Pickford could have done better but the replays showed how much away curl there was on the ball: credit the strike.\u201d     7.27pm    26 min: Nope, VAR says play on. I\u2019m guessing the contact was outside the box, in which case it was just a foul and free kick, not a penalty, and so VAR can\u2019t intervene.     7.26pm    25 min: Kane dribbles into the France box from the right wing and falls to ground. He gets up and claims a penalty. Upamecano certainly tangled with him from behind. VAR to check. It looked as though there was clear contact, and it may well be on the line. Big moment coming up here!   Updated at 7.31pm GMT    7.24pm    23 min: Saka is lively, though. He rolls a pass inside from the right for Kane, who spins Upamecano and shoots from a tight angle, on the corner of the six-yard box. Lloris, who knows him well, spreads and blocks. Henderson tries to make something of the rebound, spooning towards the far post, but France deal with that easily enough. A good response to falling behind, this.     7.22pm    22 min: On ITV, refereeing guru Peter Walton points out that VAR will have looked at the Upamecano challenge on Saka, and waved it through. Also he thought the tackle was fine on first view anyway. So there we go.     7.20pm    21 min: Saka wins a foul this time, brought down by Rabiot as he dribbles purposefully infield from the right. A free kick just to the right of the D. Shaw takes, and curls it softly into the arms of Lloris.     7.20pm    19 min: England are claiming Saka was fouled at the start of that move. It\u2019d be interesting to see it again, though on first view nothing looked amiss. Still, France had to move the ball the length of the field, scoring the best part of half a minute later. Plus Pickford may think he could have done better, but couldn\u2019t get over to the shot in time.     7.18pm   GOAL! England 0-1 France (Tchouameni 17)  Upamecano picks Saka\u2019s pocket with embarrassing ease in the French left-back position and sets off down the left flank. His team-mates follow. The ball\u2019s shuttled to the right flank by Mbappe, then cut back via Dembele and Griezmann for Tchouameni, who sends a sensational diagonal daisycutter into the bottom left from 25 yards! What a strike!      Updated at 8.05pm GMT    7.15pm    15 min: Rice wins the ball in the centre circle and sends Kane off on a futile run down the inside-right channel. Henderson then ships possession carelessly to allow Rabiot to run down the left wing. Rabiot lays off to Mbappe, who can\u2019t find Dembele free at the far stick with a raking cross. Goal kick.     7.14pm    13 min: France are enjoying the lion\u2019s share of possession. \u201cKeine drei ohne zwei is poppycock!\u201d splutters Helmut Eckart. \u201cAlle guten Dinge sind drei! is an actual German saying.\u201d     7.11pm    11 min: Griezmann and Dembele are beginning to cause England some serious problems down the right. They combine again, the latter crossing for Giroud, who has to twist in mid-air to send a header straight at Pickford. An easy claim.   Updated at 7.16pm GMT    7.10pm    10 min: Griezmann cavorts down the right and forces Bellingham to toe-poke behind for a corner. Griezmann takes it himself and whips towards the near stick. Maguire clears calmly and effectively under intense pressure.     7.09pm    9 min: Dembele races down the right at speed and sends in a tempting low cross. Giroud prepares to sweep home from six yards, but Stones deflects away just in time. Brilliant football all round.     7.07pm    7 min: Mbappe curls in a cross from the left. Giroud attempts one of those fancy scorpion kicks he\u2019s not half bad at, but this time doesn\u2019t connect. Here\u2019s Andrew McGuire: \u201cIn the event regular correspondent Andrew Benton does not go to the Co-op this evening I nominate myself - another Andrew, please note - as substitute, having just returned from my local Co-op with two 400 gram wholemeal loaves, which I would like to think will translate into two England goals. (I saw some baguettes but they looked decidedly unwholesome.)\u201d     7.06pm    6 min: Shaw swings the ball into the mixer. Upamecano rises highest to power a header clear, and turns out half of the England team were caught offside anyway. Up pops the flag.     7.05pm    5 min: Foden takes receipt of the ball on the left touchline. He\u2019s clumsily tripped by Dembele, and this is a chance for England to load the box. Shaw to take the free kick.     7.04pm    3 min: Saka drives at the France back line, causing them to drop off. The ball\u2019s sent wide right for Kane, who has nobody in the middle to cross to. A bright enough start by both teams.     7.02pm    2 min: A crackle of anticipation as Mbappe touches the ball for the first time. He nips past Walker without too much problem, but then runs into traffic and is forced to turn tail. \u201cPlenty of hostages to fortune in that reference to Casablanca,\u201d begins Charles Antaki. \u201cRound up the usual suspects if England lose; of all the multi-million-pound stadia in autocratic regimes in the world; and of course, Play it again Sam (Allardyce).\u201d   Updated at 7.08pm GMT    7.00pm    England take the knee \u2026 then the world champions get the ball rolling. A belting atmosphere!     6.56pm    The teams are out. The 1966 champions England are in white; the 1998 and 2018 winners France sport blue. Time for some music. England\u2019s anthem \u2026 well, it is what it is. La Marseillaise is magnifique. We\u2019ll be off once all the pre-match folderol has been completed.      6.43pm    Pre-match postbag. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s wise that Southgate named an unchanged team from the last England game? It was probably the best performance by the Three Lions under his management, but Senegal and France pose very different problems. As it looks to me, he\u2019s making the risky bet that his forwards will outscore Deschamps\u2019 \u201d \u2013 K\u00e1ri Tulinius  \u201cI fear that England will uphold the time-honoured tradition of going out on penalties\u201d \u2013 Jim Fullton \u201cNeymar and Ronaldo going home. Mbappe will be going later today\u201d \u2013 Jeff Sachs \u201cThere is a German proverb that goes Keine Drei, Ohne Zwei - No Three, Without Two - which means that anything that happens three times has already happened twice. Sorry, where was I going with this?\u201d \u2013 Billy Ditchburn \u201cIs Andrew Benton \u2013 he of the \u2018when I go out they scored two goals\u2019 England-Senegal MBM fame \u2013 going to the Co-op???\u201d \u2013 Jo Gray     6.24pm    It\u2019s back! It\u2019s better than ever! It\u2019s PENNANT WATCH! It\u2019s hard to say who\u2019s put in the least effort here. We\u2019ve long established the will-this-do-esque nature of England\u2019s abomination, which surely only appeals to those who like mild cheddar and weak milky tea \u2026  \u2026 but France\u2019s isn\u2019t a whole lot more interesting. Bof.  Look what you can achieve when you put in the hard yards! See? An eye-catching delight. The FA and FFF should hang their heads and take notes from the FPF\u2019s dutiful approach to their work. Admittedly unlike the Portuguese, the FA and FFF still have teams representing them in the competition, but let\u2019s not make results the be-all and end-all of football.   Updated at 6.32pm GMT    6.09pm    Gareth Southgate talks to ITV, and is asked whether naming an unchanged side was an easy decision. \u201cNo. It\u2019s never simple. We\u2019ve got strength in depth and you\u2019re always thinking about the opponent as well. But we\u2019ve been on a good path and I think we needed to stay on that track. Our midfield have been really important, and you can lose a player in there with some back-three systems. We feel we\u2019ve got to get pressure on France and try to cut the supply, and we\u2019ll get an extra player further up the pitch. We need men on the pitch. These big nights, you have to stand up, you have to go to the depths to get a result. We\u2019re playing well, we\u2019ve got confidence. This will be a huge test of that but it\u2019s great to be coming into the game feeling the way we do. These nights are those when everyone remembers where they are, and we hope we can give everyone at home another brilliant evening to remember.\u201d     5.58pm    England name the same XI that started the 3-0 win over Senegal. Jordan Pickford wins his 50th cap. Raheem Sterling is back on the bench, having briefly returned to England following a burglary at his home. Defending champions France also name an unchanged side after easing past Poland 3-1. Goalkeeper and captain Hugo Lloris wins his 143rd cap, breaking France\u2019s all-time record for appearances. He previously (and briefly) shared the record with Lilian Thuram (142).   Updated at 6.01pm GMT    5.49pm   The teams  England: Pickford, Walker, Stones, Maguire, Shaw, Henderson, Rice, Bellingham, Saka, Kane, Foden.Subs: Grealish, Sterling, Rashford, Trippier, Pope, Phillips, Dier, Coady, Alexander-Arnold, Mount, Ramsdale, Wilson, Maddison, Gallagher. France: Lloris, Kounde, Varane, Upamecano, Theo Hernandez, Tchouameni, Rabiot, Dembele, Griezmann, Mbappe, Giroud.Subs: Pavard, Disasi, Guendouzi, Muani, Fofana, Veretout, Mandanda, Saliba, Coman, Areola, Konate, Camavinga, Thuram. Referee: Wilton Sampaio (Brazil).     5.47pm    That third-time-lucky rule favouring France, then. Alexandre writes: \u201cFunnily enough, a somewhat similar French proverb is \u2018jamais deux sans trois\u2019 (never twice without thrice). In other words, something having happened twice will happen a third time. The proverbs are turning against their own countries!\u201d Now I don\u2019t know what to think. All we know for sure is that one pithy saying will become seriously compromised tonight.     5.40pm    Some happier news. Our man Jason Rodrigues was cycling through London and spotted some Morocco fans reacting much as you\u2019d expect to their epochal win over Portugal. Click below for good vibes.      5.36pm    A touching tribute to Grant Wahl. Flowers have been placed in the press box in memory of the much-loved US sportswriter, who passed away at the Argentina-Netherlands match last night. Condolences to his friends and family.      5.16pm    We now know who England or France will face in the semi-final. Morocco have spent the last couple of hours holding Portugal at arm\u2019s length, winning 1-0 and deservedly becoming the first African nation to make it to the last four. Walid Regragui\u2019s groundbreaking side could have had more than Youssef En-Nesyri\u2019s winning goal today as well. I\u2019d hazard a guess that Gareth Southgate and Didier Deschamps, given the choice of prospective semi-final opponents, would both have plumped for Morocco \u2026 but good luck breaching that defence, and there\u2019s plenty of counter-attacking flair in there too. So here\u2019s the semi-final line-up as it stands \u2026  Tue 13: Argentina v Croatia (7pm GMT, Lusail Iconic Stadium) Wed 14: England/France v Morocco (7pm GMT, Al Bayt Stadium)  Feelings of anticipation and excitement mixed with very real fear? They\u2019re perfectly natural. Go with them.      5.00pm   Preamble  England play France tonight for only the third time at a World Cup finals. The good news: they\u2019ve won both previous meetings, Roger Hunt\u2019s two goals enough at Wembley in 1966; Bryan Robson scoring after 27 seconds to spark a 3-1 win at Espa\u00f1a 82. The bad news: France go into this match with both Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and the third-time-lucky rule on their side. Kick off is at 7pm GMT, 10pm at the Al Bayt Stadium in Al Khor. \u064a\u062d\u062f\u062b! It\u2019s on!   "

                    "body": "Alex Hales\u2019s rehabilitation into the England setup could continue beyond Sunday\u2019s T20 World Cup final after the white-ball coach, Matthew Mott, indicated that he was ready to bring the opener into the 50-over side before next year\u2019s World Cup in that format. Hales returned to the England fold in September after an absence of over three years and has been one of their players of the tournament, scoring 52, 47 and an unbeaten 86 in his past three innings. He played the last of his 70 one-day internationals in March 2019, and recently said he would be keen to represent his country again in the longer format.  \u201cTo me white-ball cricket is white-ball cricket,\u201d Mott said. \u201cHe\u2019s shown he\u2019s not a slogger of the ball. He\u2019s a proper cricketer and there\u2019s absolutely no reason why he couldn\u2019t get in that 50-over team. We\u2019ve got some tough selections coming up, and we don\u2019t play a lot of one-day cricket, but I\u2019m sure if he keeps in this rich vein of form he\u2019ll be hard to keep out. \u201cAlex\u2019s ability just to stay in the moment and hit the right shot, particularly in the last few games, has been a real standout. I\u2019ve seen him do that to a lot of attacks, but playing in leagues around the world is one thing \u2013 playing in a World Cup and delivery in must-win games, that sets you apart. I think he deserves everything that comes his way. He\u2019s been a real lightning rod for our group.\u201d Hales was cast into the international wilderness in 2019 after he tested positive for a recreational drug shortly before the start of England\u2019s successful 50-over World Cup campaign. He returned only after Eoin Morgan\u2019s retirement from the captaincy and a freak golfing injury to Jonny Bairstow created a vacancy at the top of England\u2019s batting order. But after his display in England\u2019s thumping semi-final victory over India, Hales denied he was in any way motivated by the chance to show anyone what they had been missing. \u201cThat\u2019s not really on my mind when I\u2019m out there in the middle,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not why I play the game, stuff like that. I just want to enjoy myself and play at the highest level. I\u2019m just playing with a smile on my face in an England shirt again and if I get a chance to leave with a World Cup medal it would be very, very special.\u201d Adelaide Oval, scene of England\u2019s semi-final success, is one of Hales\u2019s favourite grounds, and he averages 48.33 there in 11 T20s. His visits to the MCG, where England play Pakistan on Sunday, have been a lot less enjoyable, and in 11 games there he averages 20.8. \u201cIt\u2019s a ground I haven\u2019t had much success at,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re very different conditions and dimensions to what you get in Adelaide but it\u2019s an incredible atmosphere and a big occasion. You have to hit the ball in different areas with the wider boundaries, so it\u2019s a very different gameplan. We have to make sure we adapt to those conditions as quickly as we can.\u201d"

                    "body": "On a chilly night in Canberra, a few days before England\u2019s T20 World Cup campaign started, Matthew Mott was asked if he and Jos Buttler had finalised a first XI for the tournament. \u201cWe\u2019ll always rotate because I think that makes sense under different conditions,\u201d the head coach said. \u201cIt\u2019s a funny one because no matter what the first XI is, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll be the XI in the next game. It\u2019s not as big an issue as it might sound.\u201d Since then England have played three games, one on a cool night in Perth, another on a rainy day in Melbourne and one on a humid evening in Brisbane. They have named the same team. Combined with the way they took on their run chase against Ireland \u2013 with the apparent certainty they could pace themselves over 20 overs, when a glance at a weather forecast or, for that matter, the sky would have suggested a completely different approach \u2013 the unchanged lineups suggested this was a template team, with an inflexibility of approach that runs contrary not just to common sense but to their coach\u2019s public statements.  Against New Zealand on Tuesday they became something different. There was a fluidity to their batting lineup and an unpredictability to their bowling changes, an apparent commitment to reacting to each moment rather than sticking to a script. Even if England get knocked out of the World Cup by losing to Sri Lanka on Saturday it would not alter the significance of that performance as a marker of Buttler\u2019s development as a captain, four months after he was chosen to replace Eoin Morgan. \u201cThe last game was a big one for him as captain and he came through it really well,\u201d Chris Woakes said on Thursday. \u201cHe made some big calls, big decisions, and played fantastically well himself. \u201cTaking over the reins from Morgs, who had a successful reign as captain and has done so much for the game, he must have felt the pressure of that.\u201d The first sign something different was afoot came before the game began when Buttler told his side that should he win the toss he would choose to bat first. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been a bowl-first team \u2013 the majority of T20 teams around the world have been,\u201d Woakes said. \u201cBut he was very clear he wanted to bat first. That\u2019s quite a big call.  \u201cJust naturally I can definitely see a confidence with him about how he\u2019s going about his business and the way he talks to the group. The Jos that I know, the confidence he has as a player, he\u2019s showing that as a captain.\u201d Buttler led England 14 times before his appointment as Morgan\u2019s full-time successor, but his permanent captaincy got off to a dismal start as his team lost seven of 10 white-ball games in the English summer. One of the key changes since then came on the tour of Pakistan in September, when Buttler was present but not playing as he recovered from a calf injury. Moeen Ali filled in, was widely praised and is now established as Buttler\u2019s right-hand man \u2013 sometimes literally as the first-choice slip fielder. Working as a double act has meant Buttler spends much less time running from behind the stumps to deliver messages to bowlers. \u201cComing from wicketkeeper all the time is quite challenging, rather than just being at mid-off and talking to the bowler,\u201d Woakes said. \u201cHaving that dialect with Mo is really important and has worked really well.\u201d A succession of injuries, culminating in knee surgery in July, forced Woakes to miss the entire summer, so he had no direct experience of Buttler\u2019s first steps in full-time captaincy. But Tuesday made it clear that even at 32, long established as one of the world\u2019s great T20 batters, and a veteran of 333 matches in the format, 100 of them internationals, he is still learning. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely been a change over the last month or so,\u201d Woakes said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t around over the summer so I came into the team after that transition had some time to bed in, but it definitely feels like Jos has stamped his authority on the team a bit more. It gives us a lot of confidence as a team moving forward that we were able to beat New Zealand in that sort of manner.\u201d"

                    "body": "At half-time on Tuesday night, England had a problem. They were in control of their World Cup Group B fixture against Wales but had not scored. For momentum, for the fans, for keeping critics in the media and online at bay, something needed to change. And so, five minutes after the restart, Marcus Rashford stepped up and smashed a free-kick into the top corner from 25 yards. The Manchester United forward followed up with the final goal in the 3-0 victory. Taking a long pass on the run, he chopped inside the Welsh left-back Connor Roberts, beat him definitively with a stepover, then drove the ball between the legs of the goalkeeper Danny Ward. It was an exhilarating, exuberant moment and, as he turned towards the crowd and his teammates, Rashford flashed his famous smile. England now face Senegal in the last 16 on Sunday.  Rashford is a problem solver, just ask Boris Johnson. But he has had more to work out over the past year than at any time in his meteoric career. In the summer of 2021 and struggling with injury, he put off dealing with a shoulder problem so he could take part in the European Championship. That tournament was a great success for the country, but intensely challenging for Rashford. Used exclusively as a substitute, he failed to make an impact on the field and when he was brought on during the final against Italy for the express purposes of taking a penalty, he missed and England lost. What followed was a shameful moment for the country. Rashford, and fellow England internationals Bukayo Saka and Jadon Sancho, became the targets of racist abuse. A mural of Rashford in Withington, Greater Manchester, was defaced. Some more coded criticism also came his way: the suggestion that Rashford should concentrate on football and forget social justice and his campaigning for free school meals and childhood literacy. No one knows the toll that period took on Rashford the person, and it was not the first time he had had to deal with racist abuse, but the worst season of his career as a player then followed. At club level for Manchester United he struggled. Taking time to recover from that shoulder injury he also languished in the shadow of the legend and legendary ego, Cristiano Ronaldo. Six months ago Rashford was dropped from the England squad. At the time, Gareth Southgate described the decision as \u201cstraightforward\u201d.  Today, fans need only use the evidence of their eyes to see how much has changed. Rashford has no doubt benefited from a change of coach at Old Trafford, the Dutchman Eric ten Hag having assured the player of his belief in him and his ability. Goals have returned to Rashford\u2019s game, 10 so far in all competitions this season, but, crucially, so has the flair. On top of all his myriad personal qualities, Rashford is an exceptionally gifted footballer and has the ability to do things with the ball, at pace, that few others can, even in the Premier League. This has been manifest in Qatar, where Rashford has three goals, up there with Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and Lionel Messi in the battle for the Golden Boot. His first goal in the tournament, against Iran, came just 49 seconds after he had come on as a substitute \u2013 he sent a defender to the floor with a clever feint before passing under the keeper.  After the Wales match Southgate spoke frankly about the recovery of a player he has always supported, even when choosing to leave him out of his team. \u201cIt\u2019s been a challenge for him,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cI went and saw him in the summer, had a long chat with him, and he had some clear ideas he felt he needed to think about and do. \u201cYou can see with his club there has been happiness in his performances this year, and that has shown itself on the training ground with us. We have a different version completely to the player we had in the Euros last summer. It\u2019s great for him, and because it\u2019s great for him it\u2019s great for us.\u201d Rashford dedicated his free-kick goal to the memory of his friend, Garfield Hayward, who had died just days before. \u201cHe\u2019s had quite a long battle with cancer, so I\u2019m pleased I managed to score for him\u201d, he said. \u201cHe\u2019s always been a big supporter of mine. He was just a great person and I\u2019m pleased he came into my life, really.\u201d The way Rashford articulated publicly news he had kept private from the England squad was another reminder of his ability to confront positively the difficult moments in his life. From growing up in Wythenshawe on free school meals, the child of a single mother with three jobs, to confronting the UK government and, now, rediscovering the joy of playing the game that has transformed his life in ways he might not always have asked for, Rashford has always been faced by problems. But he has also remained dedicated to working out the answers."

                    "body": "It was an image that spoke volumes. All bar two of Argentina\u2019s players had run to the far corner flag, taking it in turns to leap atop the bundle that had formed around Lautaro Mart\u00ednez. He had just scored the penalty that confirmed their place in the semi-finals, shaking off the scare caused by Wout Weghorst and the Netherlands.\nAcross the pitch from them lay Emiliano Mart\u00ednez, splayed over the turf and thumping the ground with his fists. The goalkeeper was not alone for long: while everyone else had sprinted left, Lionel Messi made a beeline to the right. The pair embraced in a clinch that may yet come to define their side\u2019s campaign.\nMessi\u2019s choice of direction was no accident. Mart\u00ednez had saved the first two spot-kicks he faced, from Virgil van Dijk and Steven Berghuis, laying the platform for his namesake\u2019s clinically executed decider. If any individual deserved plaudits it was him. But his importance extends far beyond one night in Lusail, as Messi has come to appreciate well. It is not stretching things to suggest that, after his captain, Mart\u00ednez has become Argentina\u2019s most important player.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult not to think about how hard the road here was,\u201d Mart\u00ednez said before the World Cup final. Argentina have kept their counsel during the run-in and it said plenty that he was chosen for the only mandatory media duties in advance, facing a packed auditorium on his own. That sight captured his achievement.\n\u201cIn Argentina they didn\u2019t know me as a player like I deserved and wanted,\u201d he said of the period when, at 27, he was still grasping for a breakthrough at Arsenal. Three years on he is a household name, a cult hero, and almost as likely to settle things as his nation\u2019s icon.\nQuiet and eloquent away from the pitch, Mart\u00ednez has become a booming presence on it for Argentina. He did not make his senior international debut until June 2021, after an exceptional season for Aston Villa, but the legend grew rapidly. Within a month he was repelling three penalties in a Copa Am\u00e9rica semi-final shootout against Colombia, the accompanying trash-talk and machismo earning his place in folklore as much as the saves.\n\nThe second of his stops, from Yerry Mina, is the one that resonates. Mart\u00ednez had been knocked unconscious after a heavy challenge from the centre-back during a World Cup qualifier four weeks previously; revenge was on his mind and in a stadium that was almost empty due to Covid-19 restrictions he instigated an audible back-and-forth \u2013 \u201cYou\u2019re laughing but you\u2019re nervous \u2026 I\u2019m going to eat you alive\u201d \u2013 that successfully spooked his opponent. It is far from the only example of a persona that uses personality to gain an edge alongside ability. Coming so soon after his introduction to the fold, though, it was a shortcut to a country\u2019s hearts.\nMessi called Mart\u00ednez a \u201cphenomenon\u201d afterwards and Lionel Scaloni, the coach, spoke of \u201cthe security he is transmitting\u201d. Argentina would win the trophy against Brazil at the Maracan\u00e3. \u201cPeople considered Brazil the favourites and the same thing is happening right now, they\u2019re favouring France,\u201d Mart\u00ednez said of his next major assignment. \u201cWe always like to feel the opponent is favourite, because we don\u2019t feel superior or inferior to anyone, but we have the best player of all time.\u201d\nIn 2018 Mart\u00ednez, recently returned from an unsuccessful loan at Getafe that left him pondering his future in the sport, watched Argentina\u2019s ill-fated campaign in Russia from the stands with his brother. \u201cI told him that in the next one, I would be there,\u201d he said. Four years previously he had been cooking an asado for his family and watching in pain while Mario G\u00f6tze broke hearts on a less successful night in Rio. \u201cI know what it\u2019s like to be a fan, that\u2019s why I put myself in those shoes,\u201d he explained. Mart\u00ednez has delivered on his own prediction and, in the process, shown himself to be a figure supporters can relate to.\n\nIt explains his popularity. \u201cI\u2019m just a normal guy,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen things go well I don\u2019t fall into euphoria; I don\u2019t get depressed when things go bad. When I go to Argentina I try to show solidarity and contribute. I\u2019m from Mar del Plata, in a deprived area, and I feel very identified with them.\u201d\nMart\u00ednez\u2019s uncomfortable childhood, in which money and the most basic comforts were scarce, spurred his move to England at 17 and perhaps explains the tenacity that has hauled him above the slew of goalkeeping deputies who never quite make it. \u201cI\u2019ve always fought,\u201d he said, and he has had to. Only after a decade being shunted between north London and six temporary employers did the public see what coaches always knew: that a keeper capable of breathing the most rarefied air had been bursting to get out.\nNow the world lies at his feet, or perhaps in his palms. Mart\u00ednez has been far from angelic over the past month: that aggravating side is simply part of him, as the Dutch bench found out via a volley of expletives after the hug with Messi had concluded. He and his teammates had been enraged by what he later termed \u201cnonsense\u201d from Louis van Gaal in the buildup. The veteran coach had suggested his team would be favourites for any penalty decider and Mart\u00ednez would have none of that.\nIf Sunday evening goes the distance, Mart\u00ednez will be confident of claiming his biggest scalp yet. No prizes for guessing who would be first to congratulate him."

                    "body": "This has already been a World Cup of records for France, who are chasing a third title in less than a quarter of a century on Sunday. The captain, Hugo Lloris, will celebrate his 145th cap against Argentina, three more than the previous record holder, Lilian Thuram. Olivier Giroud equalled, then surpassed, the 52 goals that Thierry Henry had scored for Les Bleus. Antoine Griezmann, one of this tournament\u2019s standout performers, has now played a barely believable 72 consecutive games for France.\nThen there is Didier Deschamps, who will be attempting to win the World Cup for a third time to go level with Pel\u00e9, the only other person to have achieved that feat; Deschamps, one of only three men, the others being Brazil\u2019s M\u00e1rio Zagallo and Germany\u2019s Franz Beckenbauer, to become a world champion as a manager and as a player; Deschamps who, if France win on Sunday, will have a legitimate claim to be considered the most decorated man in the history of the game; Deschamps, who only joined a football club at the age of 11, and has certainly made up for lost time since then.\n\nHe had barely ever left his native Basque country when he became a boarder at La Joneli\u00e8re, the sports centre where Nantes housed its young players. He was 14 at the time, 250 miles away from home. He felt lonely, and fearful, as the boys he roomed with, most of whom were much older than him, did not hide their dislike of the wonderboy whom a number of high-profile clubs had fought over before the teenager\u2019s family had opted for the Breton club.\nFor the first but certainly not the last time in his life, Deschamps had to fight off the bullies to impose himself; and if he succeeded, it was not just down to his strength of will, but also thanks to a man 30 years his senior, Jean-Claude Suaudeau (\u201cCoco\u201d to everyone), a key player of Jos\u00e9 Arribas\u2019s great 1960s Nantes side, who had just taken over the club\u2019s senior team.\n\nThe age gap does not seem to have mattered for either. The older man was struck by his protege\u2019s insatiable appetite for learning, as well as by his intelligence and his natural air of authority, making him the captain of one of the top teams in France at the age of 19, at a time when many of Les Canaris were full internationals. The younger one, who would look out from a dormitory window to see when Coco was walking his dog, and then would rush to join him, relished being taught by one of French football\u2019s most eloquent teachers, the quasi-mystic who had refined and perfected the jeu \u00e0 la nantaise, which, to quote its inceptor Arribas, was \u201cnot a system, but a state of mind in which each player must put his trust in his teammates and try to merge his own self in a whole\u201d.\nOn the field of play this was translated \u2013 especially when Suaudeau became head coach of the side \u2013 into a style of play that verged on the poetic. Suaudeau\u2019s Nantes were ravishing to watch, a living organism that moved as one, as if through liquid air; and Deschamps, hard as it can be to fathom now, was part of this work of art.\nYet Deschamps, product of the \u00e9cole nantaise that he is, Suaudeau\u2019s spiritual son that he could have been, was to become one of football\u2019s arch-pragmatists, at ease with the idea that he would often have to negate his impulses and qualities to succeed. The midfielder whom Eric Cantona derided as a \u201cwater-carrier\u201d had started as a prolific striker and, according to Suaudeau, could have played in every position on the field. But he found that it was from midfield that he could assert his authority on the game; so a midfielder he turned himself into. Deschamps is the coach who, in his first managerial role, made Monaco one of Europe\u2019s most attractive attacking sides and took them to a Champions League final in 2004, but was sacked a little over a year later, after his team, bereft of three of its best players, Ludovic Giuly, Fernando Morientes and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Rothen, failed to qualify for the same competition. Lesson learned. \u201cA manager only exists through his results,\u201d he said.\n\nThis would have been anathema to Suaudeau, and perhaps even to the young Deschamps; but the young Deschamps would not stay with his mentor long enough for Coco\u2019s teachings to turn into articles of faith. He was sold, just as every one of the better nantais graduates was sold \u2013 Karembeu and Desailly and Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9\u2013 and ended up at Marseille. There his relationship with the owner, Bernard Tapie, was so fractious, contrary to what Cantona later suggested, that Deschamps \u2013 just like Cantona \u2013 was sent on loan to Bordeaux and had to fight like mad, again, to regain his place at Marseille when Tapie was bent on getting rid of him. \nDeschamps won, and became a European champion in 1993. When he moved to Juventus a year later, a serious achilles injury forced him to sit out six months of his first season there and, again, he had to fight; and again, he won, to the extent that his manager, Marcello Lippi, trusted him more than anyone, including Antonio Conte, to be his messenger on the pitch. Whereas for Suaudeau, who defines himself as an educator, winning is \u201cpowerful but ephemeral\u201d, for Deschamps, the born competitor, \u201cpleasure can only exist in success\u201d. The most revealing word here, of course, has to be \u201conly\u201d.\nThe two men met again in 2012 at the invitation of France Football magazine, just as Deschamps was about to succeed Laurent Blanc as the head of the France national team. Put in the presence of a man he still revered, D\u00e9d\u00e9 lowered his guard as he rarely did then, and never does now. \u201cI know that progress also means going through failure\u201d, he told his mentor, \u201cbut, today, high-level football [\u2018le football de haut niveau\u2019, an expression which pops up in all of his press conferences] is about winning. When I stopped playing, I asked myself the question: \u2018Do I want to become a coach? And, above all, what kind of coach? Pass on what I know to the young ones?\u2019 After all I\u2019d been through, I couldn\u2019t be satisfied with that. Impossible. I wouldn\u2019t have been faithful to myself.\u201d To which Suaudeau responded: \u201cI never saw you as an educator. That\u2019s because you\u2019re not convincing enough. You\u2019re a fantastic winner, but not a persuader.\u201d\nYet Suaudeau\u2019s lesson has not been totally lost on Deschamps, judging by the way he has managed to take a team riddled with injuries, before and during the tournament, to a second consecutive World Cup final, with something that could, almost, pass for abandon when compared to France\u2019s fun-free approach to previous tournaments.\nHe\u2019s looked far more relaxed. He\u2019s been seen smiling. France have played with more freedom and imagination than they have for quite a while in a proper competition.\n\nDeschamps has not clipped Kylian Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s wings to compensate for Th\u00e9o Hernandez\u2019s obvious defensive frailties. Griezmann has dazzled in a protean role that appears to have been of his manager\u2019s design. Responding to his player, who had said that \u201cevery match, every move is like a thank you I send [the manager]\u201d, Deschamps commented: \u201cI don\u2019t have to love my players,\u201d sounding like a gruff drill sergeant who has just been given a lovely Christmas present by his squaddies and can\u2019t quite hide how chuffed he is by it all. \u201cI\u2019m not about to talk about love for my players \u2026 I don\u2019t have to love them, I have to know them. With Antoine, as with other players who\u2019ve been here for a long time, a relationship of trust has grown.\u201d\nAnd what was it that Arribas said the foundation of the jeu \u00e0 la nantaise was? \u201cNot a system, but a state of mind in which each player must put his trust in his teammates and try to merge his own self in a whole.\u201d Perhaps the lesson was taught after all."

                    "body": "\u201cYou\u2019re going to enjoy this,\u201d Wayne Boardman, a long-serving member of England\u2019s wheelchair side, tells me as I arrive at Calderdale College in Halifax. Boardman\u2019s smile somewhat subtly implies it will be him and his teammates who will enjoy watching me try wheelchair rugby league for the first time, rather than the other way round. After all, they know what I\u2019ve let myself in for. The sport isn\u2019t even 20 years old, having been devised in 2004 in France. It is arguably the most inclusive and diverse sport there is, pitting disabled and non-disabled, male and female, on the same teams. But the most striking aspect is its brutality and physicality, with the players regularly crashing into each other at full tilt.  So here I am, about to join an England training session for the Wheelchair Rugby League World Cup, which begins on Thursday when the hosts take on Australia. England have lost the past two finals to France but believe they have the squad to go all the way this year. Now I\u2019d class myself as fit: I run 50 miles a week and compete in races regularly. But I was about to have my eyes opened to a whole new world of fitness and supreme athleticism. England\u2019s team manager, John McMullen, brings me the wheelchair I\u2019ll use and straps my legs and feet together so my entire lower body is effectively immobilised. My chair is fairly standard but, thanks to World Cup funding, England\u2019s squad have custom-made chairs costing up to \u00a310,000. That is because they have a variety of needs and a wide range of stories to this point. James Simpson discovered wheelchair rugby league after losing his legs while serving in Afghanistan in 2009. The sport played a pivotal role in S\u00e9bastien Bechara\u2019s recovery from a motorcycle accident that resulted in his right leg below the knee being amputated.  Perhaps optimistically, I get to grips with the basics of moving in the chair and turning pretty quickly. Then someone throws me a ball and tells me to pass it back while I\u2019m moving. Not so simple. The skill level required just to execute something that straightforward is tough to adjust to and we haven\u2019t even started the session yet. This is where the fitness and skill of England\u2019s players begins to shine. We are told by McMullen to sprint for 15 metres, turn our chairs on the spot and race back. And do it three times without stopping. Shouldn\u2019t be too difficult, I thought: until the whistle blows and the squad set off at a rate of knots. I come in dead last and my neck, shoulders and arms are already beginning to ache.  Watching the upper-body strength of players such as Rob Hawkins and Nathan Collins \u2013 who has dwarfism \u2013 and the speed they move at is incredible. Their skill is just as mesmerising, making a drill where we weave behind one another while passing the ball look like child\u2019s play. I, meanwhile, am now in complete agony and struggling to move the chair, let alone execute the requisite skill to keep up. Then the part I was dreading: the contact session. We\u2019re split into mini-teams for a game of attack versus defence. The speed at which the players collide into one another is enough to make a spectator wince, let alone someone in the thick of the battle. I get the distinct feeling the England squad are taking it easy on me. That point is emphasised when I sit one drill out and two of the squad end up on their backs due to the ferocity of the collisions. By this point my whole body is aching and my brain feels scrambled after learning how to wheel, pass and turn all at the same time. That\u2019s my cue, after a pulsating and entertaining hour\u2019s training, to call it a day. McMullen affords me a wry grin as if to say he isn\u2019t surprised. The squad continue training for at least another hour, working on their fitness and skill with no let-up in intensity. I\u2019ve seen wheelchair rugby live but having experienced it close up the stamina, intensity and general athleticism has left me in awe.  A few years ago, wheelchair rugby league was played in empty arenas. Now, the Super League is regularly broadcast and on Thursday the World Cup opener between England and Australia at the Copper Box in London is sold out and will be live on BBC Two. The final in Manchester is approaching a sell out. It is a platform, and an audience, these extraordinary athletes fully deserve. Bruised, blistered from wheeling the chair, and aching, I headed for the pub to tell my friends all about it. But as they asked me to explain what wheelchair rugby league was like, all I could tell them was that they had to see it first-hand and to make sure they watch the tournament. I\u2019d give you the same advice."

                    "body": "And now, the end is near. And so we face the final curtain. A bit dramatic for the end of the group stages of a Twenty20 World Cup, but soon eight teams out of a dozen will be heading home or to their next assignments, thinking about what might have been and the disappointment of what wasn\u2019t. And in Group 1, at least, the matter of which two teams get to stay a little longer will come down to pure and beautiful arithmetic.  Arriving at this tournament, England and Australia would have been worldly enough to know that they couldn\u2019t expect to walk out of this group. They were diplomatic enough to cite every opponent as a tough competitor who could beat them on a given day. They were seasoned enough to know that this was true. And in their hearts, they would still have known that they should be the two to progress. The two biggest and best-resourced teams, one the host, the other the pace-setter in short form cricket for the last seven years.  Australia weren\u2019t expecting to get thrashed by a New Zealand side that routinely folds against them. England weren\u2019t expecting to get jumped by Ireland and a spot of Melbourne rain. So with one game left to play, the big dogs sit level with New Zealand on wins, losses, and washouts, separated only by net run rate: the measure of how quickly a team scores its runs compared to how quickly it concedes them.  Ahead of their final round, let\u2019s take care of the caveats. Yes, Ireland have built a good side after the departure of the golden generation players who won their country full member status at the ICC. There is an Irish giant-killing history at World Cups, and they could beat New Zealand on Friday. Yes, Afghanistan will be playing on a used Adelaide Oval pitch, and can deploy quality spin against an Australian team that still has weaknesses against it. Yes, Sri Lanka on a good day are more than capable of beating England in Sydney on Saturday, even if their bad days have been prevalent in this tournament.  And with all that said, none of those things are likely to happen when those teams face off in Adelaide. If New Zealand, England and Australia all bank an expected win, New Zealand stay top of the table, thanks to two big margins to start the tournament that gave their rate a supercharge. For England to bridge that gap would mean beating Sri Lanka by about 140 runs or chasing a score in five overs. Put that in the category of theoretically possible but functionally impossible, the same as the minute but extant chance that either Sri Lanka or Ireland could still make the semis with a combination of multiple upset results and absurd run-rate shifts.  What is possible, and for that reason a lot of fun, is that Australia supplanting England is possible. In a normal range of scores, with a variance of one or two runs, Australia would need to beat Afghanistan by about 62 to catch England\u2019s rate. So if England win, Australia need to be 62 runs beyond their margin. If bowling first, it\u2019s not just about keeping the opponent to a low score, but the high-speed pursuit. If Afghanistan make between 100 and 160, Australia have between 12.2 and 13.1 overs to level England, plus whatever margin England could achieve.  It\u2019s a tall task, and the ramifications of Australia letting Ireland back into the game from 25-5 on Monday night become all the more stark. But it is possible. And the extra fun part is that Australia play on Friday, England on Saturday. So the Australians will have to go absolutely hell for leather, needing to exceed England\u2019s mark but not knowing by how far. And if they do, England will have to thrash a talented team to catch up. It will change batting orders, tactics, the whole dynamic, in ways that also give underdog teams an opening. It keeps the group alive to the last game. As long as New Zealand do their job against the Irish, then finally this world will have something for the arithmeticians. Divide, subtract, and conquer."

                    "body": "An empty Holte End looms large at Villa Park as Tyrone Mings takes a seat in the Corner Flag suite. He is soon discussing Aston Villa\u2019s uplift under Unai Emery, coping with the noise after being stripped of the captaincy in pre-season, the pride of seeing his family celebrate wins, England aspirations and the small matter of hosting Arsenal on Saturday, but life beyond the bubble of a professional footballer has always interested Mings more than most. It is well documented that he spent Christmas Day feeding the homeless while a youngster at Ipswich and last year he donated to the funeral costs of a Villa supporter and set up a fundraiser for Ghana Lions, a group of Villa fans in Juaben. \u201cOn game days, it\u2019s amazing to see the village they live in, how they come together to watch Villa games, the face paint and the dancing in the street,\u201d Mings says. \u201cGetting them over to a game would be a great thing for us to do one day.\u201d Mings is engaging company over half an hour and perhaps it should come as no surprise that his appetite to broaden his horizons has extended to taking up piano and martial arts; he practises jiujitsu in Sutton Coldfield \u2013 his teacher is a Villa supporter \u2013 and has piano lessons a few times a month. \u201cI\u2019m not Tyrone the footballer, I\u2019m Tyrone the beginner at piano,\u201d he says, smiling. \u201cIn the world that we live in, there\u2019s a lot of sticking in your comfort zone. People go to work, come home, have some food, go to bed and it becomes a little monotonous. I like to do things that I know nothing about and step into someone else\u2019s world. I\u2019m learning at the top end of football, the elite where it is kind of fine-tuning \u2026 I like going in at entry-level and being like: \u2018I know nothing, teach me from the start and let\u2019s see where this goes.\u2019\u201d  For now, Adele\u2019s Easy On Me is his go-to song but he has no plans to impress on away trips any time soon. \u201cI need to be really good before I start showing off in public,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cI would like to be fluent in playing. The reading of the music isn\u2019t necessarily the hard bit, it\u2019s more the basics of playing the piano. I\u2019d like to have a few songs under my belt that I could crack into if called upon. I need to get on to classical. I want to get on to some Beethoven or something. Villa appear to have struck up a rhythm under Emery despite successive defeats. Long meetings, often containing granular detail, have become a staple under the manager who succeeded Steven Gerrard in November. \u201cNothing gets missed. One example maybe is if we concede a goal, we\u2019re going all the way back [via video analysis] to where the problem may have arose. It could be a three-minute spell of us winning the ball and losing it again, winning it back and losing it again; getting a throw-in, giving it back to them and them then beating our press. Eventually it is a kind of butterfly effect that ends up in us conceding a goal because we\u2019ve given away three corners on the bounce or we haven\u2019t cleared it properly. It is easy to hold people\u2019s focus in a long meeting when everything you\u2019re saying has a purpose.\u201d Mings is enjoying a positive season after an ominous start and extended his contract. The centre-back was shorn of the captaincy last summer and was an unused substitute for the opening game, an alarming defeat at Mings\u2019s previous club, Bournemouth. The following week Mings was recalled and he starred in victory against Everton. He knows the question is coming. \u201cIt has just added another page in the book, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d he says of the episode. \u201cIt didn\u2019t relieve me of a burden, it didn\u2019t free me up to play any better, it didn\u2019t take any pressure off me. When I\u2019m on the pitch, I\u2019m exactly the same player. I\u2019m vocal and I try to help other people \u2013 that doesn\u2019t change if I\u2019m captain or not. It didn\u2019t really change anything in terms of my mental state. I just wanted to play and I got left out of the team \u2013 that was a bigger thing to deal with than the captaincy. It has definitely added to my journey at Aston Villa rather than taken anything away from it.\u201d John McGinn, one of Mings\u2019s closest confidants in the squad, was given the armband, while Ashley Young, in his second spell at Villa, is club captain. \u201cHe [McGinn] has been here longer than me, Youngy has been here a year longer than everyone \u2013 he has been here longer than most of the furniture,\u201d Mings says, laughing. \u201cThere was never any awkwardness between John and me. Genuinely, it is no problem to me if the manager chooses a different captain. Because, ultimately if that\u2019s what he thinks is right for the club, then that\u2019s not for me to have any ego about and think: \u2018Oh no, I know better\u2019 or \u2018I think I\u2019m going to do a better job than John\u2019 because that is really disrespectful.\u201d  Mings cites Young, who turns 38 in July, as perhaps the most salient example of how all Villa players are learning and improving under Emery, a four-times Europa League winner, given how he has excelled at right-back. The World Cup winner Emiliano Mart\u00ednez is adapting to the Spaniard\u2019s wishes to play out from the back. A low-key welcome greeted the Argentina goalkeeper on his return to Villa \u2013 \u201cthe manager is very no-frills \u2026 it was just business as usual\u201d \u2013 but his crowning glory is never too far away. \u201cHe\u2019s got a big tattoo [of the World Cup trophy] on his leg, so you\u2019re definitely reminded of it,\u201d Mings smiles. \u201cI know he had a few exuberant celebrations but he\u2019s very humble.\u201d Villa are yet to finish in the top 10 since returning to the Premier League four years ago but have grand plans under owners Nassef Sawiris and Wes Edens, who hope Emery can, in the longer term, lead them into Europe. Brighton, Brentford and Fulham are among those jostling for those berths this season. \u201cIt\u2019s admirable,\u201d Mings says. \u201cI don\u2019t look at any club and think: \u2018That should be us.\u2019 You can\u2019t begrudge someone else\u2019s hard work or plan. We\u2019re on our own journey. Teams are doing it to show that it can be done. Hopefully next it will be us. The manager is very much: \u2018I\u2019m not expecting this to be perfect in one month, two months, six months, maybe even 12 months but we will get it right and we\u2019ll keep sticking to what we believe.\u2019 When a manager sets out his long-term roadmap it smooths out any bumps along the road.\u201d Mings, who harbours hopes of returning to the England setup after missing out on Gareth Southgate\u2019s squad for Qatar, is set to return to the starting XI against Arsenal on Saturday after missing last weekend\u2019s defeat at Manchester City with a quad injury. Supporters will be hoping Mings is fit to feature given his form and their record without him; Villa have won only one of the past 12 league matches he has not started. \u201cWhen we played them earlier in the season, I actually think it was a tighter game than the scoreline showed [Villa lost 2-1 in August],\u201d Mings says. \u201cThey are a fantastic team and we are going to have to be right at it to get a win. But we definitely feel like we can.\u201d"

                    "body": "From building heroic works of concrete brutalism in the 1960s, to pieces of playful postmodernism in the 1980s, and curious organic-tech structures in the 2000s, few architects have been as versatile and enduring as the Japanese designer Arata Isozaki, who has died aged 91.Impossible to categorise with any single stylistic label, Isozaki was a constant presence in global architectural culture for the second half of the 20th century, after he first came to prominence in the 60s with visionary, almost sci-fi schemes for how Japanese cities might be rebuilt after the second world war.  His 1962 project, City in the Air, proposed great branching megastructures sprouting above the congested streets of Tokyo, imagining tree-like clusters of apartments, offices and transport nodes linked in a futuristic aerial network. It was at once ancient and modern: the interlocking forms recalled the wooden sashihijiki bracket structures of traditional Buddhist temples, while the urban forest was to be connected by a computer network, prefiguring the internet by two decades. It came to nothing at the time; but, half a century later, Isozaki would realise similarly hi-tech fantasies on an equally epic scale, fuelled by the accelerating economies of China and the Middle East, building otherworldly monuments from Shenzhen to Doha.Arata Isozaki was born in O\u0304ita, on the southern Japanese island of Kyushu, as the eldest of four children of Soji and Tetsu Isozaki. His father was a businessman who ran a transport company and was also a leading haiku poet. One of Isozaki\u2019s earliest memories was the vivid experience of destruction: he was 14 years old when Hiroshima and Nagasaki were flattened by US bombs in 1945. \u201cI grew up on ground zero,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIt was in complete ruins, and there was no architecture, no buildings and not even a city. Only barracks and shelters surrounded me. So, my first experience of architecture was the void of architecture, and I began to consider how people might rebuild their homes and cities.\u201d  Isozaki studied architecture at the University of Tokyo, graduating in 1954, and received a doctorate there in 1961. While studying, he began his career with an apprenticeship under the guidance of Kenzo Tange, the godfather of the Japanese metabolism movement, with whom he dreamed up speculative plans for improbable megastructures spanning Tokyo Bay. He founded his own practice, Arata Isozaki &amp; Associates, in 1963, and began with a series of projects in his home town, including a striking medical centre and library building. They were both designed in the muscular brutalist style, with intersecting oblong forms cast in raw, board-marked concrete, their structures conceived as open-ended armatures for continual expansion (although, like most such \u201cplug-in\u201d plans, they were never expanded as intended) Even in these early years, before the dawn of postmodernism, Isozaki\u2019s work contained an element of humour. Commenting on the design of the O\u0304ita Medical Hall, built in 1960 as a squashed cylinder raised on four legs, he later said: \u201cI suddenly saw the building\u2019s resemblance to a piggy bank and burst out laughing. Instead of discarding the design, I decided to go with it, precisely because of its humorous character.\u201d Wit and whimsy became a hallmark: he went on to design a golf clubhouse in \u014cita in 1974 in the form of a huge question mark, because he could not understand his fellow countrymen\u2019s obsession with golf.  Isozaki travelled extensively in his youth \u2013 \u201caround the globe at least 10 times before I turned 30,\u201d he once boasted \u2013 paving the way for what would become a truly international practice. In the 1980s, he became one of the first Japanese architects to build abroad, when he won a high-profile competition for the Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) in Los Angeles. Capturing the postmodern spirit of the age, he assembled a gnomic tableau of platonic forms, like children\u2019s building blocks, with a grid of pyramid roof lights atop a sunken gallery, and a barrel-vaulted library raised on legs above the entrance, the whole complex clad with red Indian sandstone. Mostly sunken below ground, with a low-key presence on downtown LA\u2019s Grand Avenue, the building stands as a kind of anti-monument, a restrained foil to the thrashing titanium sails of Frank Gehry\u2019s Disney Concert Hall and Diller Scofidio + Renfro\u2019s serrated white flanks of the Broad museum that have come along since. Combining the golden ratio proportions with elements of yin-yang theory, the MOCA building was a novel fusion of eastern and western traditions that would become a recurring theme throughout Isozaki\u2019s work. It was an approach that set him apart from his contemporaries \u2013 and often confused critics. \u201cLooking at an Isozaki building is a bit like watching an American sitcom dubbed in German,\u201d wrote William Wilson in the LA Times in 1991. \u201cSuddenly all those American actors saying danke and gesundheit look very Teutonic.\u201d  Isozaki sampled from both the given context and his own Japanese heritage with promiscuous relish, mixing unusual cocktails of different influences. His Palau Sant Jordi in Barcelona, an indoor arena built for the 1992 Olympic Games, combined a domed roof inspired by Catalan vaulting techniques with the sloped forms of Buddhist temples, clad with a local material palette of brick, tile, zinc and travertine. For the office headquarters of Disney in Orlando, built in 1991, he went full Florida. The building stands as an unbridled riot of colour and pattern, aptly embodying the turbo-charged joy of the cartoon dream factory. A tapering central cylinder \u2013 half salmon pink, half minty green \u2013 stands at a jaunty angle, crowned with a bright yellow halo, rising from a dazzling cobalt blue box. The composition is adorned with a number of other cubes, variously dressed in glossy red or brown and beige chequerboard patterns, while a pair of Mickey Mouse ears forms a punched entrance to the cylindrical rotunda, which also serves as a gigantic sundial. It is PoMo in the extreme. But, like many proponents of the style, Isozaki did not like the label. \u201cI\u2019m postmodern,\u201d he once told a reporter, in a characteristically philosophical turn of phrase, \u201cnot postmodernist.\u201d He cultivated a position as something of an iconoclastic sage, writing dense theoretical texts about his work and dressing in loose, flowing outfits, designed by his friend Issey Miyake, with his white hair tied in a short ponytail. He mixed in avant-garde circles: his third wife, the sculptor Aiko Miyawaki, whom he married in 1972, brought an international coterie of artist friends into their life from the years she had spent in Paris, including Hans Richter, Man Ray and John Cage. She died in 2014.  Isozaki\u2019s final two decades saw an unexpected leap in the scale of work he was offered, bringing opportunities to build in the heady contexts of Qatar, China and Central Asia. His museum for the China Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing, completed in 2008, took an organic turn, as a bulging whale-like volume clad in textured slate shingles. In Doha, Isozaki saw a chance to finally realise his 1960s City in the Air scheme for the Qatar National Library , which would have seen a great stack of reading rooms suspended in the sky from three 20-metre tall cylindrical columns. The plan was abandoned, but he did realise a boxy convention centre instead, with a huge roof supported by a peculiar structure of blobby, tubular branches, in an apparent reference to a holy Islamic tree. At the time of his death, Isozaki\u2019s practice was involved in a number of masterplans in China, so it is fitting that the Power Station of Art in Shanghai will host a major retrospective of his work this year. As its co-curator, Aric Chen, said of Isozaki: \u201cFew architects have been so significant to so many architectural developments over so many decades \u2013 a position of centrality that he maintained, in large measure, through his insistence on staying on the periphery.\u201d  When Isozaki finally won architecture\u2019s highest honour, the Pritzker prize, in 2019, decades after several of his contemporaries had received it, he commented with typical wry humour: \u201cIt\u2019s like a crown on the tombstone.\u201d Isozaki is survived by his partner, Misa Shin, a gallery owner, and a son, Hiroshi, and a grandson, Gen. Another son, Kan, died in 2017. \u2022 Arata Isozaki, architect, born 23 July 1931; died 28 December 2022"

Michael Cheika\u2019s side were worthy winners against the Wolfhounds in Leigh, with the National Rugby League superstar Mitchell Moses their standout player. The result means that should Lebanon beat the debutants Jamaica as expected next weekend Cheika will face the nation he has coached on almost 70 occasions in rugby union, but this time in rugby league. That quarter-final will take place on Friday 4 November in Huddersfield; two days later Cheika will lead Argentina\u2019s rugby union side against England at Twickenham.  It looks set to be a busy weekend for the 55-year-old, with only victory against a debuting Jamaica side that have been well beaten in their first two group games now standing between Lebanon and a place in the knockout stages. Ireland, in contrast, were disappointing and they now have to beat New Zealand in their final group game to stand any chance of qualifying. The opening exchanges were hard-fought, but by half-time Lebanon had established a comfortable 20-4 lead. Moses was outstanding, having a hand in the tries for Reece Robinson, Jacob Kiraz and Brandon Morkos which put the Cedars in control. Ireland\u2019s sole try of the first half came from Louis Senior. Senior\u2019s second after the break briefly gave Ireland hope, but indiscipline was their undoing throughout the afternoon. Ged Corcoran\u2019s side, who some fancied to cause an upset, had two players sent to the sin-bin and that helped Lebanon to maintain control of proceedings for the majority of the game. Further tries for Elie El-Zakhem and Wigan\u2019s Abbas Miski put the game beyond Ireland, before Ed Chamberlain\u2019s late consolation. In the other game on Sunday, Samoa set up a winner-takes-all game against France next weekend with a 72-4 victory against the debutants Greece. The win keeps Samoa, beaten 60-6 by England last week, firmly in contention to reach the quarter-finals, with the winners of their game against France next Sunday deciding who qualifies with England. Matt Parish\u2019s side scored 13 tries against Greece with Danny Levi, Tim Lafai and Chanel Harris-Tavita each scoring twice. Greece face England, who have qualified for the last eight, next Saturday in Sheffield in their final group game, with their sole try here coming through Lachlan Ilias."

Now, after Olivier Giroud had tilted this World Cup thriller back in the direction of France, Kane stood over the spot once more.\nThe penalty had been conceded by Theo Hernandez. It was an extraordinary rush of blood from the full-back, who barged into the back of the England substitute Mason Mount as they chased a high ball that was going over both of them. An even bigger one was to come.\n\nKane had the outright scoring record within his grasp. More importantly, he stood to reignite England\u2019s belief, lighting a path to extra time \u2013 and, perhaps, a semi-final against Morocco. The pressure was excruciating. As he had done with the earlier penalty, Kane took his time. And yet he fell apart, blasting high over the crossbar in a moment that will live for ever in his nightmares. It was the 84th minute. And that was pretty much that.\nThere would be no late sting and, for the umpteenth time, England were left to reflect upon a bitter hard luck story. This was supposed to be the night when everything came together against world champion opposition, mentality aligning with quality, the brutal lessons of the recent past helping England to a famous victory.\n\nGareth Southgate and his players had made no secret of the target here \u2013 and it went beyond merely beating France. They were in Qatar to win the World Cup. \u201cWe didn\u2019t come this far to just come this far,\u201d read a banner in the gym at their training ground. Southgate had said that England simply had to \u201cnail this type of game now\u201d. They came up agonisingly short.\nThe focus will turn towards what Southgate does next. Will he continue into a fourth tournament campaign? The inquest will rage, as always. The manager had said before the game that the buck would stop with him.\nBut this was no rerun of the two defeats that have burned the holes in his England CV \u2013 against Croatia in the semi-finals of the last World Cup and then Italy in the Euro 2020 final, when caution and a lack of belief undermined him and the team. It was not a loss to chase him from his post.\n\nEngland were the equals of France here, at the very least. They created chances. After another sticky start they played on the front foot and with aggression. They broadly kept Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 under control.\nBut when another substitute, Marcus Rashford, was narrowly off target with a last-gasp free-kick, England had to face up to a missed opportunity. Kane looked broken at full time. So did everybody in England\u2019s colours.\n\nEngland had not been behind at the tournament, had not previously experienced a real setback. Southgate and his coaches had discussed how they would react, the processes that needed to be followed. They had to put them into action after Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni\u2019s early breakthrough, which felt as though it was advertised. France had got quickly into their passing rhythms, the excellent Antoine Griezmann prominent. Giroud had almost got in for an 11th-minute header.\nThe breakthrough came when Griezmann laid off to Tchouam\u00e9ni, who shot from distance with vicious swerve. Jordan Pickford had plenty of time to see it. As it headed to his right-hand corner he flung himself across. He was at full stretch but it was not enough. Dayot Upamecano had started the move with a challenge on Bukayo Saka that England had insisted was a foul. The Brazilian referee, Wilton Sampaio, said no. He would be erratic throughout. At times, it looked as if he was guessing.\nEngland stayed calm and Kane led the fightback, getting into a couple of physical duels with Upamecano and winning them. Kane cleverly rolled the centre-half after a Saka pass into him and he had a chance from an angle on the right. Hugo Lloris, on the occasion of a record-breaking 143rd France men\u2019s cap, was out smartly to block.\n\nThere was also the moment on 25 minutes when Kane again got away from Upamecano and headed for the right-hand edge of the box. He felt his marker sweep his legs away as he entered it but, after a VAR review, it appeared the contact had been made marginally outside. Luke Shaw banged a free-kick straight at Lloris before the goalkeeper clawed away a deflected Kane effort from distance.\nEngland continued to push after the interval. Jude Bellingham exploded a shot from the edge of the area after a half-cleared corner that Lloris tipped over \u2013 another good save \u2013 and Saka began to push his influence, all quicksilver movement off the right.\nIt was Saka who won the first penalty after a give-and-go with Bellingham, Tchouam\u00e9ni stretching for the tackle but getting there too late. Saka was too quick. Mbapp\u00e9 had a rather showy word with Lloris as Kane prepared himself, trying to spook the England captain. It did not work.\nAdrien Rabiot almost restored France\u2019s lead straight away \u2013 Southgate frantically pointed at his temples \u2013 and there was the foot race between Mbapp\u00e9 and Kyle Walker that everybody wanted to see. The French forward won it, finding an extra gear at the last to pull back for Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, who could not react.\n\nEngland had to take a chance and they threatened. Harry Maguire kissed the outside of a post with a header from Jordan Henderson\u2019s free-kick; Saka could not convert from a Shaw cross. It was so close.\nIt looked at that point as if England were the more likely scorers of the next goal. France had other ideas. Giroud should have scored from a Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 nod-back \u2013 Pickford saved well \u2013 and then he did find the net from Griezmann\u2019s wonderful cross, getting in between John Stones and Maguire to crash home. Kane had the chance to write a different story. There would only be misery."

                    "body": "At least two of the nine men being sought by Victoria police over Saturday\u2019s pitch invasion at the A-League Men Melbourne derby have made themselves known to investigators. The invasion of the Melbourne Victory/Melbourne City football clash left a player, a referee and a TV camera operator injured. Images of nine men released on Sunday night showed one holding a bucket of sand, another holding a lit flare in the stands and another hanging from a goalpost. Two men have now been identified after coming forward to police. \u201cInvestigations remain ongoing,\u201d Victoria police said on Sunday evening. No arrests have been made so far. Insp Jason Goddard confirmed on Sunday afternoon police would pursue possible charges against any person who invaded the pitch.  When asked about City\u2019s goalkeeper, Thomas Glover, who required stitches to a wound caused by a metal bucket that struck his head, throwing a flare back into the crowd immediately before the invasion, the inspector said: \u201cI\u2019m not upset by anything at this stage when it comes to that\u201d but added that detectives would investigate all parts of the incident. Goddard was on duty at the game as part of a contingent of 134 police. He said that number was more than usually rostered on for a capacity crowd at the MCG which is three times the size of AAMI Park. Police had prepared for the possibility of a pitch invasion, he said. \u201cIn recent times there has been a little bit of controversy \u2026 in relation to a decision made by the league,\u201d Goddard said, referencing the A-League\u2019s decision to award grand finals to Sydney. \u201cWe work very, very hard in the lead-up to these games, and we worked especially hard in the lead-up to this game.\u201d A \u201chorrified, irritated and angry\u201d James Johnson, the chief executive of Football Australia, had earlier promised swift action to identify and sanction those responsible for the violence that blighted the Melbourne derby. Victory will be issued with a show cause notice by FA to explain the actions of their club\u2019s supporters as part of a three-pronged line of investigation into the incident. \u201cWe will be moving swiftly and we will be taking the strongest sanctions available,\u201d Johnson said on Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at three separate [lines] of investigation. The first is what happened with the game last night, what happens with the result. The second will be a show cause letter from Melbourne Victory \u2013 that will be received as soon as possible but we will not close the door to a show cause letter to City at this point in time. \u201cThe third focus of the investigation will be against the individuals who we are seeking to name, identify and sanction.\u201d Johnson said FA would be looking to \u201cweed out\u201d the small element that \u201cinfiltrates our game and tries to ruin it for the people who love it\u201d.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  \u201cThis pitch invasion, and I want to be clear about this, has nothing to do with a groundswell and the rising of our game,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cA parent who takes a child to grassroots football in Brisbane, or a young boy who plays in our league pathways in Perth, or the 40-year-old woman who plays amateur football in Sydney, or the fans who peacefully protested in Central Coast Mariners, the Wellington game, Newcastle game, all the other 2 million people across the sport who love and support our game \u2013 this is not about them, nothing to do with the 2 million people who love and support our game, week in, week out.\u201d  The ugly scenes came just two weeks after the Socceroos bowed out of the World Cup after a successful run to the last 16 of the tournament in Qatar that captured the imagination of the nation, and with seven months to go before the Women\u2019s World Cup is hosted on home soil in Australia and New Zealand. Johnson said he was not too concerned about any impact on the Women\u2019s World Cup, but he had already been in touch with Fifa and the AFC over the incident. \u201cThese things happen and they aren\u2019t specific to Australian football,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is what our response is. Our response is very simple: there is no place in our sport for this type of behaviour and those who participated in this behaviour will be weeded out. That will give confidence to Fifa.\u201d  Johnson said he did not consider the people who disrupted Saturday\u2019s match to be fans and was at pains to make the distinction between them and the millions of true supporters of the game. \u201cThis matter doesn\u2019t reflect the broader game,\u201d he said. \u201cWe saw in Melbourne at Federation Square, thousands and thousands of great football fans coming together to support the Socceroos. We saw this in other cities around Australia. These are fans and they cannot be branded or painted with the same brush as those individuals that invaded the pitch last night. These are two separate groups.\u201d  The managing director of Melbourne Victory, Caroline Carnegie, said on Saturday that she was \u201cdisgraced and appalled\u201d by the events. \u201cThis is a group that we don\u2019t condone the behaviour of and we don\u2019t want at our club,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there are a lot of fans and members of Melbourne Victory that do the right thing, and they turn up and support the boys and girls, and we stand as one with those fans. On Sunday afternoon the A-League said: \u201cFootball is the most inclusive sport.  \u201cIt is for families and for law-abiding citizens who want to passionately support their team. The events that unfolded at the Melbourne derby last night, demonstrated that a small minority of people with criminal intent hide within our game. \u201cThey neither understand nor love our game.\u201d"

                    "body": "England were well on their way to defeat in Stockholm by the time Zlatan Ibrahimovic launched himself into the air and prepared to embarrass Joe Hart. An experimental lineup had collapsed at the end of a ramshackle friendly with Sweden and, for all the fanfare over Steven Gerrard winning his 100th cap, the only thing anyone wanted to talk about after the game was the moment when Ibrahimovic made it 4-2 with a preposterous overhead kick in the 90th minute.\nTen years on, the ponytailed striker\u2019s chutzpah still inspires awe. Ibrahimovic had already scored a brilliant hat-trick, but his fourth goal was the pick of the lot. It left Hart red-faced and, if there was a consolation for England, at least Sweden\u2019s biggest star had dragged the attention away from their struggles.\nThis was a very different England side to the one that will face Iran at the Khalifa International Stadium on Monday. They were coached by Roy Hodgson, captained by Gerrard and bruised after a drab performance at Euro 2012. Gary Cahill, who announced his retirement this past week, was in central defence and a 31-year-old Leon Osman was one of six debutants. Rejuvenation was the focus for Hodgson. He took the opportunity to have a first look at Steven Caulker, Carl Jenkinson and Ryan Shawcross; he even dipped into the Championship, calling up Wilfried Zaha and bringing the Crystal Palace youngster off the bench with five minutes left.\n\nOf course, Zaha ended up switching his allegiance to Ivory Coast. The player he came on for against Sweden, though, has become part of the furniture. Last Monday marked the 10th anniversary of Raheem Sterling\u2019s England debut and, even though his form for Chelsea is a concern, it would represent a major surprise if he does not start against Iran.\nThe England shirt no longer weighs heavily on Sterling. This is the 27-year-old\u2019s fifth international tournament, underlining his importance to the side, and it is startling to consider how much has changed in the last decade. To put it into context, Gareth Southgate was working on the Sweden game as a pundit for ITV. Sterling was 17 and had just broken into the Liverpool side. He was exciting but raw and there were times when he frustrated fans with his indecisiveness in the final third.\nThe mind goes back to Sterling facing Italy in England\u2019s opening game at the 2014 World Cup and letting fly from long range early on. Everyone watching on television saw the net ripple and thought it was in; in reality the ball had flashed past the left post, merely brushing the side-netting, and England would go out before the group stage was over.\n\nThat near miss felt symbolic for Sterling. There was a time when he dreaded international duty. He received heavy criticism after England lost to Iceland at Euro 2016 and it was not long before he was being targeted with racial abuse.\n\nYet adversity brought out the best in Sterling. Off the pitch, he has become a pioneering voice in the fight against discrimination. Sterling, who will win his 80th cap against Iran, is a leader. He looks after young players when they enter the England setup. He is the most-capped player in this squad \u2013 Harry Kane is second on 75, Jordan Henderson and Kyle Walker are joint third on 70 \u2013 and there is no bigger fan of him than Southgate, who tends to respond to criticism of Sterling by arguing that none of the other attacking midfielders at his disposal can match his goal threat.\nStill Sterling, who has 19 goals for England, is in danger of losing his place as an automatic starter. He was England\u2019s best attacker during their run to the final of Euro 2020, troubling opponents with his pace and scoring three goals. He is devastating when in the mood. His runs in behind keep defenders guessing and England tend to be at their best when Kane is releasing Sterling with clever through balls.\nHowever the question is whether opponents have grown wise to that line of attack. True, nimble creators such as Mason Mount, Phil Foden and Jack Grealish are likely to play in front of defences. They like the ball to feet, whereas Sterling runs in behind. For Southgate, the risk of dropping Sterling is that England find themselves without enough pace and get bogged down.\n\nThe counter is that Sterling\u2019s recent performances for club and country have been underwhelming. Gone is the level that made his partnership with Kane crucial to England picking Spain off on the break in October 2018 and earning one of the best wins of the Southgate era. Sterling is in a rut. He decided to leave Manchester City in the summer after losing his place as a regular in Pep Guardiola\u2019s side, but he is yet to hit his stride at Chelsea. The sacking of Thomas Tuchel has changed things for Sterling. Tuchel wanted him to be the main man; Graham Potter has often used the former City winger as an auxiliary wing-back and the results have been unconvincing. One goal in his last 10 games for Chelsea speaks volumes.\nIt feels unsustainable. Southgate has backed Sterling, but he is goalless in his last five internationals for England and was poor against Italy in September. At some point Southgate will have to look elsewhere. Bukayo Saka has been in outstanding form for Arsenal. A rejuvenated Marcus Rashford is an obvious alternative on the left. Foden, Mount and Grealish are also pushing for starts, though James Maddison\u2019s knee injury is likely to keep him out against Iran.\nEqually Sterling, whose England record is worthy of more respect, has seen it all before. He was pilloried after Euro 2016 but responded by helping England reach the semi-finals of the 2018 World Cup. His mentality is rock solid. Sterling will remember how there were similar doubts over his place before the Euros and his response was to score the winner when England beat Croatia in their opening game. Something similar against Iran would not go amiss."

                    "body": "There are three certainties in modern life: death, taxes and English rolling maul tries at the women\u2019s World Cup. For the victims ensnared by the giant white anaconda there can be no escape from the inevitable end game. It rarely takes long for another Red Rose forward to be driven over the line beneath a huge pile of limbs.\nIt has reached the point where England no longer need to attempt much else. Their modus operandi has been highly effective and none of their opponents has yet located an antidote. If Canada are to have any chance in Saturday\u2019s semi-final they will have to withstand an irresistible force that has crushed almost everything in its path so far.\n\nWhether or not it qualifies as exhilarating viewing depends on your nationality and definition of oval-shaped entertainment. What cannot be denied is the brutal technical excellence of the monster mauls, for which England\u2019s forwards coach, Louis Deacon, deserves his share of the credit. The former men\u2019s international lock has been in post for only 15 months but his impact has been clear enough.\nFor anyone familiar with the Leicester packs in which he played in the noughties there is also a definite sense of deja vu. For years the Tigers maul was equally unstoppable, with try poachers such as Neil Back at the rear to finish things off. \u201cOne of the things I wanted to instil is that an England set piece needs to be dominant and feared,\u201d says Deacon, flatly. \u201cThe opposition need to be worried about certain aspects of what we do. That\u2019s the way I\u2019ve been brought up. Often it\u2019s just about doing the fundamentals incredibly well.\u201d\n\nSome may see it as an unlikely marriage: the most macho of alpha male mindsets transplanted to an elite female sporting environment. What Deacon has increasingly found, though, is that England\u2019s women are cut from the same cloth as Martin Johnson, Richard Cockerill, Darren Garforth, Graham Rowntree and all the other cauliflower-eared alumni in the Tigers\u2019 hall of fame. \u201cTheir mindset is just like a men\u2019s team,\u201d says the 42-year-old, who won 29 caps for England and made 274 club appearances in a 15-year Leicester career.\n\u201cThey love those physical, confrontational parts of the game just like men do. There\u2019s no difference. It\u2019s rugby, just played by women.\u201d While coaching men and women is not an entirely uniform process \u2013 \u201cYour approach has to be very different\u201d \u2013 he has also learned he can raise his voice and be verbally blunt if standards are in danger of slipping. \u201cWhen I first came in I believed you couldn\u2019t be a ranter or a raver. But at times they like that approach, as long as it\u2019s not all the time.\u201d\n\nThe results, either way, are self-evident. The only question mark is over whether they will be forced, at some stage, to revert to a subtler Plan B only to find their wider attacking game has seized up. Deacon, interestingly, entirely agrees that champion teams cannot be one-trick ponies. \u201cOne hundred per cent. If you\u2019ve got a strong set piece that\u2019s your backbone. But you\u2019ve also got to be able to play an all-round type of game and be able to pull the trigger in the backline when you need to.\u201d\nHe is a firm believer, though, that the Red Roses can play in a variety of ways if necessary. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t concern me. In training we don\u2019t just endlessly maul and maul. But when we come to the games we\u2019re just doing what is required for that particular job. We\u2019ve got stuff in the locker to play a different style if we need to.\u201d\nIn addition to passing on specialist lineout tips \u2013 \u201cWe built it from the bottom right the way back up\u201d \u2013 Deacon is also particularly well placed to offer valuable insight on the importance of sportspeople seizing career-defining moments when they come around.\nHaving been a member of England\u2019s 2011 men\u2019s World Cup squad, he knows from personal experience how it feels to be sat in an Auckland hotel awaiting a big knockout game at Eden Park. In his case things did not pan out as hoped, with England losing 19-12 to the eventual finalists France in the quarter-finals. \u201cIt was disappointing because it was an opportunity missed. On another day I think we\u2019d have won. If we\u2019d have done so, we\u2019d have played Wales in the semi-final.\u201d\nThe Red Roses, consequently, are being repeatedly warned not to allow their focus to drift. \u201cSo far the girls have gone incredibly well but as I keep reminding them we need to be constantly looking to get better. We\u2019ve spoken to them about the pressure of the occasion but, to be honest, I think the girls like the challenge.\u201d Maul or nothing? England\u2019s rampant forwards are in no mood to back down now."

A week after Wade spoke in Perth, having endured three more beltings by England in the interim, it is reasonable to wonder whether the lightbulb is flickering. Only rain in the final match could turn whitewash to washout. The first two matches took different routes to identical margins of eight runs, once when England\u2019s batting blitzed a score of over 200, then when the cleverness of England\u2019s bowling defended a more modest score.  In the third match it was adaptability that had England on top, the batters walking back after two rain delays to loot 39 runs from the final 14 balls of a shortened innings. Josh Hazlewood is Australia\u2019s standard-bearer for Test bowling, the tall quick with the accuracy to hitting a coin on the pitch, and who has more recently adapted his game to suit 20-over cricket. Jos Buttler is England\u2019s captain, and currently the shortest format\u2019s most consistently destructive batter in the world. It felt symbolic to see Buttler calmly eviscerating a Hazlewood over, picking slower ball from full pace with a yawn in his throat, placing the fuller balls through the off side and the marginally shorter ones over leg to collect 22 runs from six shots. Then there was England\u2019s swing bowler Chris Woakes, a man whose glum Ashes visits have seen him take a wicket in Australia every 95 balls, starting up on this damp Canberra evening to find movement and create catches from the first two deliveries of the match. The DLS score adjustment had set Australia 130 to win, meaning that the required run rate soon exceeded 12 per over. The home team was gone, even before more rain. None of which is to say that Australia got much wrong. They go into the upcoming World Cup with an excellent best XI and an adaptable squad. It\u2019s just that right now, England look a better side on paper and on grass. The same was true at last year\u2019s tournament, when they were stacked with batting power top to tail while Australia had frailties exposed. The path to that trophy didn\u2019t rely on finding a way to beat England, it relied on avoiding them. New Zealand offered a trans-Tasman favour by maintaining the historical role of New Zealand cricket: being a giant-killer against everybody else before falling apart against Australia. So the old rivalry is set at an interesting point with this year\u2019s tournament about to start. All three of the aforementioned teams are in the same group, with Afghanistan and two qualifiers that will most likely be Sri Lanka along with Ireland or Zimbabwe. Don\u2019t discount the Sri Lankans, who recorded some stirring wins across all three formats against Australia in June and July before storming on to win the Asia Cup. But as usual most eyes will be on Australia versus England, first in the group stage and then possibly again in the knockouts. By then, memories of warm-up matches will be distant. Everything starts fresh in a big tournament as you wait for the umpire to call play. But there are still aspects of significance that could carry over. England\u2019s batters have shown no fear of the blue-chip pace trio of Cummins, Starc, Hazlewood. Buttler regards all bowling as there to be scored from, and his players follow his lead. England\u2019s bowlers fancy themselves against Australia\u2019s top order, and can find ways to suppress explosions from the middle. And on a longer timeline, Australian teams find ways to win the big moments even when by rights they should not. The dynamics between certain teams within a tournament context can be fascinating. Take Pakistan losing to India at World Cups for decades, and the eruption of delight when they finally broke that streak last October. The objective quality of sides outside tournaments is not always reflected in certain match-ups within them. England\u2019s era of white-ball excellence from 2015 to now has not landed the biggest T20 prize, and last year\u2019s World Cup did nothing to settle whether it made them a better side than Australia: if a World Cup match makes the warm-up fade to nothing, a final makes the group stage do the same. In 2022, after a long wait, a knockout meeting would be a satisfying path to closure."

Here\u2019s his match report.       9.14pm    Bradford gets in touch from Australia: \u201cThat picture you provided for the second Japan goal clearly shows the balls outer edge still hanging over the white line. By that picture, the ball is in play, NOT out. However, when the broadcasters show replays, it looks like that frame you provided might not be the best one showing the ball at it\u2019s furthest point of travel before coming back in towards goal. As an Australian, it\u2019s so SO good seeing the blue samurai take it to European powerhouses. Throw UAE and Iran in, and it shows Asia isn\u2019t the walkover.\u201d   Updated at 9.32pm GMT    9.11pm    Ben Mabley, the Premier League commentator in Japan, had this to say: \u201cEver since I came to Japan, I have often heard that Japanese soccer has a short history, and I never want to hear it again! This year, too, a great history is happening right before your eyes! ! congratulations! !\u201d      9.07pm    Peter Walton, who appears to live in a VAR room of TVs, says goal-line technology and says VAR was right to stay with the ref\u2019s decision if we don\u2019t know if the \u201ccurvature of the ball is over the line\u201d. He doesn\u2019t know, then. Nobody does. The picture of the ball crossing the line has done a Lord Lucan and disappeared.      9.03pm    Roger Kirkby: \u201cNot having a dog in the fight, that is the best two nights of football I have ever watched. Fantastic stuff, and then some.\u201d  Simon McMahon: \u201cCredit to Japan. Beating Germany and Spain, while losing to Costa Rica, is some achievement. In the end, it\u2019s the Germans who have ended up regretting one poor performance. What a group. Football, eh? Bloody hell.\u201d Seth Levine: \u201cTo Rope-a-dope Germany is impressive. To rooe-a-dope Germany and Spain is unbelievable. Thoroughly deserved. Not sure I\u2019ve ever been more pleased for any side in any sport. Love the way they play. No s**t-housery. No histrionics. Brilliant fans. Excellent tactically. Manager wears a charcoal three-piece suit. What\u2019s not to love?\u201d     9.00pm    ITV are going to give Peter Walton a call to clear it all up for us on the second goal. The one night he takes off, and misses THAT line call. Though any money he will back the Fifa call.   Updated at 9.13pm GMT    8.58pm    That\u2019s how they finish. Japan will play Croatia, and Spain will play Morocco.       8.57pm   Confirmed: Germany are out.  Costa Rica and Germany are playing out the dead seconds and it\u2019s over! Spain finish second in the group and would not be there without that 7-0 win over Costa Rica.      8.56pm   Full-time: Japan 2-1 Spain  Japan are this tournament\u2019s surprise machine, and they have made sure Germany are out of the World Cup at the group stage for the second successive tournament. Japan were brilliant from the start of the second half. Doan made all the difference, as did the second goal, when the ball was deemed to cross the line. We still haven\u2019t seen what the VAR came up with. Controversy reigns, but so do Japan who win the group. Very well done to them.   Updated at 9.02pm GMT    8.53pm    90+7 min: Big cheers when Gonda gets the ball and takes his time over it. Spain seem happy to hold the ball now. Boos as they mount one final attack. Cheers when the ball is cleared and that\u2019s it\u2026Japan have done it.      8.52pm    90+6 min: Spain are passing it around, with the drums, the drums, the\u2026drums still playing. The Japanese are reduced to a back five, seven and nine now. Their fans are singing and whistling. Not long now.      8.51pm    90+5 min: Spain still pushing for this one, by the way. Japan have defended so well but are reduced to getting it launched out, with nobody up there to chase the ball down.      8.50pm    90+4 min: The prediction at this point is the pages of Bild will include a pic of that ball going over the line \u2013 or otherwise \u2013 for that Japan goal.      8.49pm    90+2 min: This is no Gijon-style detente between Austria and Germany from 1982. Spain are trying to get into this. Ten minutes have been added on in the other game, where F\u00fcllkrug has scored to put the Germans 4-2 up.      8.46pm    90 min: AS IT STANDS: Spain and Japan are going through. There\u2019s seven added minutes.      8.46pm    89 min: Jordi Alba, who actually came on as a sub, has shot blocked, and so does Asensio as the ball bounces out. Then Olmo is on the end of a nice passing move and Gonda saves low, and holds on.   Updated at 8.50pm GMT    8.45pm    88 min: The count-back is getting querulous right now. Spain stuck between wanting to win the group and knocking the Germans out. I think. These games are on the same clock.      8.42pm   Update: Costa Rica 2-3 Germany  Havertz has scored and Spain will edge out Germany on goal difference. Germany need a Spain goal to stay in the World Cup.   Updated at 8.43pm GMT    8.41pm    84 min: Ito almost gets away and Carvajal has to run all the way back to clear the danger. One on one with Simon was a sub-optimal situation. Spain having to chuck everything at this, and the back door is being left open.      8.40pm    83 min: Japan take their time over a free-kick. A lot of time. Doan, the magic man, takes it and Itakura head down. This time, Simon was comfortable. Mind, the header was from about 30 yards out.      8.38pm    81 min: Nathan Barnes: \u201cIt\u2019s unthinkable that the team who were battered 7-0 in their first group game are ahead in their conquerors in the last group game. Football never ceases to amaze.\u201d Not now. (I think.)     8.37pm    80 min: It\u2019s all Spain, but so far it\u2019s been all toothless. The Spain that don\u2019t have a striker, Morata having long left the field. Fati chases the ball down to the byline but can\u2019t win a corner.      8.36pm    77 min: Adriana Batalha has a VAR referee in her house, it seems. Is it Peter Walton? Actually, where is Peter Walton? \u201cI showed that picture to the expert in my house and he says in looks like it\u2019s in. You have to look at the whole volume of the ball, not the part that is touching the floor. If you look at the wider part of the sphere, it\u2019s in the line.\u201d     8.34pm    76 min: Lots of emails in saying the ball was IN for the second Japan goal. Guess it\u2019s in the eye of the beholder, or VAR as it were. And we still haven\u2019t seen the image they used.      8.32pm    74 min: OK, Spain still need to find a goal. They can\u2019t rely on the Germans and Costa Rica. Tomiyasu gets back to show his experience and sweep up. Japan hold on to this and Germany are done.      8.30pm   Score update: Costa Rica 2-2 Germany  Kai Havertz has scored and that breathes life into Spain if not yet Germany.      8.29pm    72 min: Spain have to find a goal from somewhere. Japan really defending deep.      8.29pm   Score update: Costa Rica 2-1 Germany  AS IT STANDS, Spain and Germany are going out. Manuel Neuer again, and it\u2019s Juan Pablo Vargas after a lengthy VAR delay.      8.27pm    70 min: Asano, one of the Japanese subs, has a glorious chance, Mitoma setting him up with a burst down the wing, and a lovely pass inside. Asano got excited.      8.25pm    69 min: One more Spain subs: Fati on, Alba off. Japan sub: Tomiyasu comes on, having nursed his way through back from the muscle injury he picked up against FC Zurich.      8.23pm    66 min: This game\u2019s gone to piddle recently. Perhaps having the score from the other game on the scoreboard \u2013 as I believe is the case \u2013 is stopping them playing properly.      8.21pm    64 min: Was the ball out? It looks it here. We\u2019re still yet to see the VAR imagery. Gianni Infantino is in the stands, feeling Japanese no doubt. Or Costa Rican. But not a migrant worker.       8.19pm    62 min: 30 minutes plus change of this fare to come. Not so much now that TV execs have decided they don\u2019t like all that time added on. Interferes with the advertisers, see.      8.17pm   Update: Costa Rica 1-1 Germany  Talking of goalies dropping a rickett, Manuel Neuer\u2019s had one. Yeltsin Tejeda scores, ans suddenly both Spain and Germany are staring down the barrel.      8.15pm    59 min: Kari Tulinius emails in: \u201cJonathan Wilson has the theory that I it can be bad for a team to score too early. That\u2019s clearly the case when playing against Japan, who seem to get better the longer they\u2019re behind. Costa Rica had the good sense to score against them late in the first half and won.\u201d     8.14pm    57 min: Spain subs: Off go Williams and Morata, and on come Asensio and Ferran Torres.      8.13pm    56 min: Howard from Streatham messages in: \u201cMight be late to this but where\u2019s De Gea?\u201d Yes, Unai Simon is taking the rap for this one so far. Meanwhile, the VAR has yet to show us the ball was in. Or an image to that end. Soccer!     8.11pm    53 min: AS IT STANDS: Germany are heading out. Japan\u2019s subs again turning this group on its head.      8.10pm   Goal! Japan 2-1 Spain (Tanaka, 51)  Japan have the ball in the net again! Doan again, the ball running to the byline, and it\u2019s knocked in. VAR run the check, and the ball looked to have run back out of play. Nagatomo looked to have not been able to keep it in. Was it in? It was! So says VAR. There must be nothing in it.    Updated at 8.19pm GMT    8.06pm    49 min: As it stands, Japan are going through on head to head. Well well well.   Updated at 8.13pm GMT    8.05pm   Goal! Japan 1-1 Spain (Doan, 48)  The drums, the drums, the drums continue. But what\u2019s this? Doan, the sub, has scored. With one hell of a wallop, the ball dropping to him outside the box. Unai Simon was again guilty, first in dallying on the ball, secondly in not making the save. Well well.   Updated at 8.11pm GMT    8.03pm    46 min: One change for Spain, two for Japan. Dani Carvajal for Cesar Azpilicueta. And for Japan, Nagatomo and Kubo have gone off, and Doan and Mitoma of Brighton have come on.      8.01pm    More emails:  Roger Kirkby: \u201cHi John, fun fact for you. In the last 4 World Cups 13 times groups have been won by a team with 9 points. Not one of them went on to win it. The winners had 7 or 6 points.\u201d  Alexandra Ashton: \u201cEagerly wearing my Japan shirt with my boyfriend, hoping for a miracle. As it stands, they\u2019ve looked rather awful to my eye (I think it\u2019ll be 2-0 Spain), although he contends Japan will \u201cgrow into the game\u201d and win 2-1. Remains to be seen whether he or I will be proven right at full time.\u201d     7.56pm    The emails are in.  Matt Dony: \u201cSpain have a Rodri and a Williams on the pitch. They\u2019re the new Wales. Dewch ymlaen, Sbaen!\u201d Simon McMahon: \u201cEvening John. This is hardly BREAKING NEWS, but I\u2019d think that come full time, Japan will be kicking themselves about the Costa Rica game. A missed opportunity. But you just never know I suppose, maybe they can turn this game around like they did against Germany. Whatever happens, their fans will still tidy up at full time and leave in an orderly, good-natured fashion. I think all fans should be more like the Japanese.\u2019 Albert Farkas: \u201cI can\u2018t help it, I just can\u2018t stand Morata\u2018s visage. He gives off vibes of a Spanish Patrick Bateman.\u201d Roger Kirkby: \u201cHi John, not the fireworks of last night, Japan really need to score or this is now dead rubber territory.\u201d In a previous life, I worked for an American company who banned the use of \u201cdead rubber\u201d, and didn\u2019t like the phrase \u201ccross-cum-shot\u201d either. It had never crossed my mind that these were in way rude. I still don\u2019t know why they are\u2026     7.50pm    Some World Cup news for half-time reading.        7.47pm   Half-time: Japan 0-1 Spain  It\u2019s been all Spain, and that relatively early goal from Alvaro Morata reflects their dominance. Japan have struggled but worked so hard to be still in the game. An even more manful effort is required in the second half, as Germany are winning the other match.      7.46pm    45 min: Gavi takes rap to the ankles from a Taniguchi tackle, and the offender is then booked. Then Yoshida is booked for smashing into Morata. Except he hadn\u2019t. A simulation got the former Southampton player booked. Just one minute added on.      7.43pm    43 min: Olmo shapes to shoot and it\u2019s blocked as Taniguchi slides in. Japan have defended redoubtably. So difficult for them to stem the flow.      7.41pm    41 min: Alejandro Balde, 19, one of the next gen, and already looks the part.      7.40pm    39 min: First booking: Itakura smashes into Pedri, who had been sold a little short by a Busquets pass. Painful one, but the Barca boy will be OK to continue. Itakura, playing as a wing-back, is now suspended for the next round should Japan get there.      7.38pm    38 min: Spain are finding this perhaps a little more ragged than they would like. But still in heavy control.      7.36pm    36 min: Are Japan getting somewhere? At last, the likes of Nagatomo are getting a touch, and Ito, and Kamada has a shot blocked. There was an offside there the referee missed.   Updated at 7.44pm GMT    7.35pm    34 min: Unai Simon turns a wobble into a counterattack, almost sending Williams away with a hurried hack with the ever hopeful Daizen Maeda giving chase.      7.33pm    32 min: Busquets takes a whack, takes his time getting up. So does Gavi. The 34-year-old has a yellow card and may be withdrawn as soon as this job is complete.      7.32pm    31 min: Japan get a glimmer but then Busquets shows off his trademark anticipation and the stats men tells Spain have had 79 percent of possession. If they had a striker, they\u2019d be dangerous. Hang on, they have Morata.      7.29pm    30 min: Spain taking the sting out by passing around, moving the ball around at will, tiring out their Japanese chasers.      7.28pm    28 min: Japan are frustrated here. They came to press and are being pressed to distraction. Busquets looks their best route back in, and he is rather lax in playing the ball back to Unai Simon, who has to hurry up to launch the ball clear.      7.25pm    26 min: Peter Oh joins us: \u201cThis is a timely battle of goalkeeper nominative determinism, because Shuichi is Japanese for \u2018once a week\u2019, and Unai is Basque for \u2018now\u2019.\u201d     7.25pm    25 min: Might have been a second when Rodri sets up a move, and Morata cuts it back. Offside, our semi-automated machine tells us.      7.24pm    23 min: Morata gets on the end of a Spain move that suddenly clicks into gear but can only shoot straight at Gonda in the Japan goal. Now comes some loud clapping in the stadium, and the drums, the drums, the drums.      7.22pm    21 min: Luis Enrique doesn\u2019t look so chilled out on the bench now. What a player he was, by the way. Very much a predecessor to your Cesc Fabregas and Gavi types. His team is chasing down their opponents like demons, strangling them. The fans in the stadium are doing a Mexican wave, which may show what level of contest this has become.      7.19pm    19 min: Kubo, of Real Sociedad, goes down holding his face, having taken a whack from Dani Olmo. Spain are beginning to be the team who press hard now.      7.17pm    17 min: So, this group may be going as expected now. It\u2019s left to Japan and Costa Rica ti supply any ripples to the expected way of things, and beyond Maeda\u2019s good work, Japan have been full of energy but not much else.      7.15pm    15 min: The supplier of that cross was Azpilicueta, Morata\u2019s old buddy at Chelsea. He knew exactly where his mate was going.      7.13pm    13 min: Morata, a much-maligned player, comes through for Luis Enrique again. There\u2019s a real player there, and the Spain manager seems like the one who can find him.      7.13pm   Update: Costa Rica 0-1 Germany  Serge Gnabry has scored and that moves Germany into second in the group.      7.12pm   Goal! Japan 0-1 Spain (Morata, 12)  Spain decide to settle things down with some passing. Not that Japan are in the mood to let them settle. Williams and Gavi link, and then when the ball comes back out, the ball pinged back in and Morata heads in.    Updated at 7.16pm GMT    7.09pm    9 min: Spain go down the other end and force a corner. Dani Olmo\u2019s chip finds Morata who can only head downwards. It was probably offside. It\u2019s an open game, which is good news.      7.08pm    8 min: Busquets is having one, and Maeda is at it, stealing in and playing it to Kubo who can\u2019t get the angle of his shot right. Signs here that Japan can repeat the energy of the Germany game, and that\u2019s a problem for dear old Busquets.      7.07pm    7 min: Panic in the Japan box, as Nico Williams spins out wide from a Gavi pass. Busquets comes in to pick up the pieces but blams his shot over. Finishing has never been his strong point, has it?      7.05pm    5 min: Nice run from Kubo down the right-hand side has Spain a-quiver, he gets to the byline and then it takes a few turns to get the ball clear. Maeda of Celtic involved, too.      7.03pm    3 min: Gavi and Pedri are those who advance it further, and Japan hurriedly get the ball clear. In pre-match, they were warming up in formation, no point in trying to fox Luis Enrique. The formations, since you ask, are 3-4-3 for Japan, and Spain are 4-3-3 with Morata as the centre-forward.   Updated at 7.08pm GMT    7.01pm    1 min: The ball is, and this is little surprise, passed around the back of the Spanish team. That Spain defence features three changes.      7.00pm    The Fifa pop/pap anthem of togetherness and forgetting about politics rings out, the countdown begins, and away we go\u2026     6.57pm    The referee, Victor Gomes, assisted by that minibus full of VAR assistants has an interesting back story, via Spanish daily As.   He has a reputation for being an authoritative ref, dishing out 51 straight red cards in 323 games he has officiated in although the vast majority of them were in the domestic South African league. In April 2018, he was also hailed by the South African Football Association after he revealed that he was offered US$30,000 (R362 556) in cash to fix the score of a CAF Confederation Cup tie between Nigeria\u2019s Plateau United and Algerian side USM Alger - he turned down the offer.      6.55pm    The oversized World Cup is on display, the fireworks are going off, and the stadium has been dropped into darkness and back out again. And the two teams are out, and it\u2019s time for the national anthems.      6.45pm    Vitals news from elsewhere in the World Cup.       6.31pm    Joe Pearson gets in touch: \u201c\u2018Nobody is quite sure why the scheduling is working out like this\u2019\u2026.To quote the late NBC Sports executive, Don Ohlmeyer, \u2018The answer to all your questions is: Money\u2019\u201d.  Updated at 6.31pm GMT    6.11pm    The chance to meet Morocco or Croatia is at stake here. The winners of Group E will receive a day less to prepare for Croatia. Nobody is quite sure why the scheduling is working out like this.    Australia and Argentina would empathise.       6.01pm    Spain make five changes from the Germany draw, bringing in defenders Cesar Azpilicueta, Pau Torres and Alejandro Balde. Nico Williams and Alvaro Morata get the nod in attack while captain Sergio Busquets, is a yellow card away from a suspension, remained among the starters at the Khalifa International Stadium. For Japan, Moriyasu has also made five changes from the side beaten by 1-0 by Costa Rica. In defence, Shogo Taniguchi comes in for Miki Yamane, Japan\u2019s third right back in three games at the tournament after Hiroki Sakai was injured in the 2-1 win over Germany. Ao Tanaka is brought in as a holding midfielder.     5.53pm   The teams  Japan: Gonda, Itakura, Yoshida, Taniguchi, Junya Ito, Morita, Tanaka, Nagatomo, Kamada, Maeda, Kubo. Subs: Kawashima, Yamane, Endo, Shibasaki, Doan, Mitoma, Minamino, Tomiyasu, Asano, Sakai, Machino, Ueda, Schmidt, Soma, Hiroki Ito. Spain: Simon, Azpilicueta, Rodri, Pau Torres, Balde, Gavi, Busquets, Gonzalez, Williams, Morata, Olmo. Subs: Sanchez, Garcia, Llorente, Koke, Asensio, Ferran Torres, Raya, Guillamon, Pino, Jordi Alba, Carlos Soler, Carvajal, Sarabia, Laporte, Fati. Referee: Victor Gomes (South Africa)     5.48pm    Alex Reid previewed this game for today\u2019s World Cup briefing.   Japan v Spain (Group E, 7pm GMT, ITV1) A point would take Spain through, but a victory guarantees top spot and Luis Enrique\u2019s slick young passers are unlikely to get bogged down with nefarious thoughts of a draw potentially hurting Germany\u2019s chances. Expect Spain to hog possession and play for the win. Japan can take heart from the fact that they beat Germany (when expected to lose) and lost to Costa Rica (when expected to win). An underdog role may suit them and a point will be enough if Germany and Costa Rica draw. AR      5.44pm    Of course Rodri at centre-back for Spain.   Rodri was used at the heart of defence by Pep Guardiola \u2013 obviously \u2013 on a handful of occasions in the 2019-20 campaign, but he is inexperienced in the role. Throwing him in at the deep end at a World Cup was a risk, but Rodri has handled it well. At 6ft 2in, he has the physicality to play the role and he is brilliant at dispossessing opponents \u2013 only Declan Rice (82) has won possession in the midfield third more times than Rodri (70) in the Premier League this season. Rodri has the tools to excel at centre-back in the modern game, given his tenacity off the ball and impressive distribution when in possession.       5.43pm    Aymeric Laporte, the Spain defender, spoke to Sid Lowe in Doha.   Too much, Laporte insists. It doesn\u2019t even make sense, Spain are not in a position to run risks. \u201cNothing\u2019s clear: no one has anything assured,\u201d he says. As for the pathway, he insists: \u201cI haven\u2019t even looked.\u201d He grins but it\u2019s believable. \u201cI haven\u2019t looked, haven\u2019t done the predictions, haven\u2019t done anything.\u201d Do you even know which group yours crosses with? Spoiler: it\u2019s F. \u201cNo idea.\u201d You could tell him anything. England next. Laporte laughs. \u201cHonestly, when I play for City, I don\u2019t even know what time kick-off is. My family call and say: hey, what time tomorrow? \u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019\u201d       5.34pm    So much for Mr Intensity, Luis Enrique is a chilled-out entertainer, streaming on social media and honestly really really relaxed at his news conference.   My streaming sessions and posting, everyone can have their own reading or interpretation, I didn\u2019t start doing this with any specific goal. There are so many cliches about training camps having to be very strict. I don\u2019t know who came up with this. Imagine how long the players are off. They have so much time off to be bored. Having to follow strict rules. That\u2019s ridiculous. The only goal I set for my players...before this training camp 16 days ago, I told them we need to have fun, fun. We need to enjoy this because you have to joy in your job. They\u2019re football players. Some of them are young boys. They have family children, who have to act with normalcy Having a day off after 10 days of a training camp. It\u2019s not crazy. To go out for a walk with your wife, family members. That\u2019s a good sign. Yes, they\u2019re under so much pressure.      5.31pm    Japan coach Hajime Moriyasu spoke at his news conference ahead of the match.   They must believe in themselves, they must. They must believe in their team mates in order to fight against our opponent. Hopefully, they will be at their best and the result will follow. The whole world is keeping in step with European football. Both tactically and physically, I think there are similarities in trends across the world, and the gap is narrowing. We should be able to narrow the gap with the big teams as we play against them, and as we learn from them at this World Cup, we will also be able to find out how to exceed them. We are going to show the Japanese spirit and pride and we are going to counter our opponents, fight our opponents. I hope that the players will play in such a way that they inspire the Japanese people then they keep inspiring other people.      5.30pm    The permutations.  Group E \u2013 Costa Rica, Germany, Japan, Spain Final matches Thursday 1 December, 7pm GMT: Costa Rica v Germany, Japan v Spain Spain: A draw will be enough for Spain to progress. However, if they lose and Costa Rica beat Germany, they will be eliminated \u2013 which would be a huge shock after opening the tournament with a 7-0 win. Japan: A win against Spain will see Japan qualify. A draw means they are relying on Costa Rica and Germany drawing to progress. If Japan draw and Costa Rica win, Japan are out. If Japan draw and Germany win by just one goal, whoever has scored the most goals will go through. If Japan draw, and Germany win by more than one goal, Japan are out. Costa Rica: A win will put Costa Rica through. A draw will be enough if Spain also beat Japan. If Japan get a draw, Costa Rica\u2019s vastly inferior goal difference means they would not progress. Germany: The Germans can qualify if they beat Costa Rica and Spain beats Japan. A draw is of no use to them.  Group E and Group F are paired in the draw. The winners of Group E play the runners-up of Group F in the next round, and vice-versa.       5.30pm   Preamble  The two great shocks of this tournament came when Saudi Arabia beat Argentina, and then when Japan beat Germany. Wednesday saw the Saudis perish, now can the Japanese avoid the same fate? Their losing to Costa Rica came as something of a shock, too, but now they must stage a repeat performance of their opener. Or draw and hope for the match between and Costa Rica to go their way. Spain looked brilliant in their first match, and then against Germany fell prey to the torpor that has gripped just about every team at this World Cup when being pegged back by Germany getting it launched to Niclas F\u00fcllkrug. The feeling persists they need a proper hitman, though aren\u2019t alone in that. Luis Enrique may be the tournament\u2019s most intense coach, with apologies to Graham Arnold and Herv\u00e9 Renard, making Pep Guardiola look liked Don Carlo Ancelotti.  Japan hope they can revive the verve of that German glory. If they do, then they might pull off another of the great shocks.    "

                    "body": "Steve Borthwick is expected to be confirmed as England head coach this week following the sacking of Eddie Jones on Tuesday. Borthwick\u2019s club Leicester Tigers are understood to be negotiating a compensation package with the Rugby Football Union but the former England captain will be named officially as Jones\u2019s replacement before the weekend.\nThe 43-year-old Borthwick left the RFU in the summer of 2020 to join Leicester but will now return to Twickenham to fill the void left by Jones\u2019s dismissal. The 62-year-old Australian has been relieved of his duties with immediate effect, with his forwards coach Richard Cockerill placed in temporary charge pending Borthwick\u2019s arrival.\n\nThe precise makeup of Borthwick\u2019s backroom staff for the Six Nations remains to be agreed, with Leicester\u2019s Kevin Sinfield, Richard Wigglesworth and fitness guru Aled Walters all likely candidates. The Tigers, though, could do without losing their entire coaching team in mid-season and it may be that some of Jones\u2019s assistants remain involved in the short term.\nIt sums up the myriad uncertainties now facing the RFU only nine months before the start of the Rugby World Cup in France next year. Jones\u2019s seven-year tenure finished with a disappointing series of results this year but, even so, dismissing him so close to a World Cup is a big call with nine matches for Borthwick to turn around a drifting ship. England are due to begin their 2023 Six Nations campaign with a Calcutta Cup showdown against Scotland at Twickenham on 4 February.\nThe RFU clearly felt, though, that it could not continue to back a head coach whose side had endured their worst year results-wise since 2008. No major country in the world, either, has had such a significant turnover of backroom staff, with Jones\u2019s demanding style and relentless work ethic having proved too much for many.\nThe 27-13 defeat against South Africa, and the Twickenham boos that greeted it, proved the final straw as far as the RFU was concerned. Under Jones, however, England won 59 and drew two of their 81 matches and Jones boasted a 73% winning record, superior to any other head coach including the World Cup-winning Sir Clive Woodward.\n\nBill Sweeney, the RFU\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement that he was grateful to Jones \u201cfor all he has done for England across many areas of the game\u201d and said he had made a \u201chuge contribution\u201d to the English game, having presided over three Six Nations titles, a grand slam success in 2016 and guided his team to the 2019 Rugby World Cup final.\nUnder the Australian, England also equalled New Zealand\u2019s record of 18 consecutive Test victories in 2017 but since then they have been less consistently successful. This year England lost six, drew one and won five of their 12 Tests and won one of their four autumn games.\nJones is understood to be philosophical but disappointed by the RFU\u2019s decision, having always stressed he was targeting success at the 2023 World Cup. He insisted, however, he was leaving with a degree of satisfaction at England\u2019s progress under him. \u201cI am pleased with much that we have achieved as an England team and I look forward to watching the team\u2019s performance in the future. Many of the players and I will no doubt keep in touch and I wish them all well in their future careers.\u201d\nAs recently as March, following England\u2019s disappointing Six Nations campaign, the RFU had backed Jones, saying it was \u201cencouraged by the solid progress the team has made\u201d. Not everyone is convinced jettisoning Jones is a wise move now, with the former Wallaby international Matt Giteau describing it on Twitter as \u201cthe silliest thing they could do to the English rugby team\u201d and a \u201cbig mistake\u201d.\nAs a player the Cumbrian-born Borthwick won 57 caps for England and also captained his country for two years. Since retiring in 2014 he has coached with Japan, Bristol and Leicester as well as his five-season stint with England with Jones at the helm. Last season he steered the Tigers to their first Premiership title since 2013."

                    "body": "Mark Wood and Rehan Ahmed are expected to sit out England\u2019s next Test assignment against New Zealand in February as the management juggle their resources during a busy start to an Ashes and World Cup year. Wood proved a trump card for Ben Stokes on the torpid pitches of Pakistan, sealing the series with a three-wicket burst in Multan and backing this up with another wholehearted display when the historic 3-0 clean sweep was secured in Karachi. As well as the strain of bowling 60 overs of 90mph short balls in dusty heat, all while battling the team\u2019s sickness bug, the 32-year-old also spoke on tour about experiencing homesickness for the first time. Only Wood, who has a young family, and Harry Brook, 23, featured in both legs of the Pakistan tour and the T20 World Cup win.  As such, and with the summer\u2019s Ashes in mind plus the World Cup next winter, Wood is expected to take a break during a packed second half of the winter, sitting out January\u2019s ODIs in South Africa and the two-Test series in New Zealand that starts on 16 February. The six-match white-ball tour of Bangladesh in March could mark his return. Despite seven wickets on debut in Karachi and a maiden five-wicket haul, the 18-year-old Ahmed may also be left out of the next Test squad with the expectation that conditions are unlikely to dictate a second spinner and Jack Leach still first choice. Brendon McCullum, the head coach, is hoping Ahmed will instead get some playing time in franchise cricket. Despite reports to the contrary, the leg-spinner is confirmed to be entering Friday\u2019s auction for the 2023 Indian Premier League, which begins in late March. If picked up, he would miss Leicestershire\u2019s start to the county season. The squads for South Africa and New Zealand are due to be named imminently, with Jofra Archer in line for a comeback in the former after 18 months out injured. Stuart Broad and Matt Potts could be restored to the Test team\u2019s stable of seamers after missing Pakistan for parental leave and tactical reasons, respectively.  Ahmed has clearly impressed McCullum, who hopes his remarkable rise inspires talented youngsters across all sports, saying: \u201cIt is a great story. He\u2019s a young kid but he has a tremendous attitude; he has a high ceiling in terms of skill level, a bit of x-factor and he has the potential to wow the world, which is pretty cool. \u201cWe have to look after him, encourage him to get as much experience of conditions and franchise tournaments with different coaches and players to allow that talent to come out. \u201cJust think how many talented players there are in England who might be 13, 14, 15 who might be brilliant at various sports. To see a young kid given the chance at 18 to live his dream and dominate in a Test match, it might just spark one or two to stay away from the things kids that age are doing and we might see more coming through. If that happens, Rehan is a pioneer.\u201d  It\u2019s the type of lofty, big-picture goal that McCullum has made a theme of his tenure. But as the 41-year-old reflected on the team\u2019s achievements in Pakistan, he repeatedly pointed to the leadership of Stokes as the true catalyst for the upturn and insisted he himself does \u201cbugger all\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s quite incredible,\u201d said McCullum. \u201cWhat we see on the field pulling the string is one thing \u2013 Stokesy is constantly active, making plays and always thinking about wickets and he\u2019s so consistent with his message that he doesn\u2019t care about runs. \u201cBut what he does off the field is quite remarkable \u2013 his man management, his general positivity is quite staggering. I thought he\u2019d be good but he continues to exceed expectations. He and I are starting to build a really good relationship, not just on the field but off it as well. \u201cI\u2019m an incredible optimist but to win 3-0 in these conditions against a very good Pakistan side is probably more than we expected and we had to do it in three completely different ways. We were challenged tactically, technically and even emotionally with sickness off the field. It goes down not just as an achievement but a memory for the guys for the rest of their lives.\u201d"

                    "body": "When Australia and Samoa walk onto the Old Trafford pitch this weekend with both the Paul Barri\u00e8re Trophy and rugby league greatness on the line, there is unlikely to be a prouder cadre than the Penrith Panthers front office.  After claiming back-to-back NRL premierships and sending a record 19 players to the World Cup, a magnificent year for the Panthers will be capped when eight of their players likely square off in the decider. Among those eight will be a remarkable five members of the Penrith backline that defeated Parramatta in the NRL grand final \u2013 not inclusive of Clive Churchill medal winner Dylan Edwards.  Having eight players from a single club in a World Cup final is extraordinary. Only the great 1992 Wigan team has had as many in the last 40 years and all eight of those played for a losing Great Britain side. The current record for the most players from a club with at least one player on each team in the final was jointly held by Melbourne Storm, who had four Australian players and two New Zealanders in the 2008 final, and Balmain in 1988, who had five donning green and gold and one wearing black and white. No team in the professional era has had at least three players on each side in a World Cup final but that is likely to change when the weekend\u2019s teams are announced.  When State of Origin came into existence, it was billed as state against state, mate against mate. This World Cup final very much marches to a similar beat with the close-knit Panthers team who came through the Penrith junior system together set to go up against each other in the most important game in international rugby league.  The Australian team will have Nathan Cleary at halfback, along with Isaah Yeo and Liam Martin starting in the backrow. Samoa will have backs Jarome Luai, Stephen Crichton, Brian To\u2019o and Taylan May, as well as impact bench forward Spencer Leniu.  The most compelling of these individual clashes shapes as that between the Panthers\u2019 halves pairing Cleary and Luai. The two have been the centrepieces of the last two premiership runs and have won and lost Origin series together for New South Wales. They are now in the rare position of facing off not only without their usual on-pitch partner, but against them.  It is not only a battle between two teammates and two great friends, but two players who are very much a contrast in style. Cleary, the robotic perfectionist, a product of a life in rugby league, textbook to a T. Luai, mouthy and energetic, a jackrabbit with a killer instinct, a genuine livewire. They are just the second club halves pairing after Kieran Foran and Daly Cherry-Evans in 2013 to meet in a World Cup final.   Cleary has received more acclaim over the course of pair\u2019s careers but there is little doubt Luai has enjoyed a better World Cup. Luai has won player of the match honours in three of Samoa\u2019s four wins. He leads the tournament in try assists and ranks fourth for offloads. Cleary, meanwhile, has been locked in a battle with Cherry-Evans for the starting halfback spot and has struggled to get any synchronicity with what has been a clunky backline in nearly every showing.  Luai, as expected, will not shy away from playing against Cleary, stating \u201cthere\u2019s no friends on the field\u201d as the two prepare to meet for the first time since facing each other as St Mary\u2019s and Brothers players in the local Penrith junior competition.  Over the last decade, Penrith have created as fine an example of building from within as any club could hope for. Two premierships and eight players in a World Cup final are testament to both the plan and the execution of it. Their contribution to the international game and the rise of rugby league in Samoa can and should be part of the adulation heaped on the club.  Samoa is, to quote their coach Matt Parish, \u201ca dot in the Pacific\u201d, a country that ranks 189th in terms of population and whose preferred code of rugby is not the 13-man game. The country should not, in theory, be contesting a Rugby League World Cup final. Among the diaspora though, rugby league is incredibly popular \u2013 as evidenced in the rise of Pasifika participation at all levels of the game in Australia and New Zealand.   What no club prior to Penrith has sought to do, though, is fully embrace the Pasifika way, often trying to force square pegs into round holes in what have typically been very rigid programs within NRL teams. Penrith, by contrast, has fully invested in ensuring players of Pasifika descent can play a style and with an attitude they not only feel comfortable with but embrace.  The flow on has been the development of a cultural rugby league identity for Samoa as well as a pipeline of quality players coming from the most successful team in the NRL who want to transfer that success to the international stage and the country of their forebears.  The World Cup final will see mate playing against mate. But unlike State of Origin where clubs watch on in fear, Penrith powerbrokers should be able to sit back and look at just how much they have done for the game and how wide their decisions have reached.

                    "body": "Louis van Gaal says he doesn\u2019t recall the last time he faced Gregg Berhalter in a competitive match. Berhalter, whose United States team will play Van Gaal\u2019s Netherlands on Saturday in the last 16 of the World Cup, doesn\u2019t believe him for a second. The date was 4 May 1997. Berhalter was a fresh-faced 23-year-old center-back for a mid-table Sparta Rotterdam side that beat Van Gaal\u2019s Ajax team \u2013 who had played in the Champions League semi-finals only 11 days earlier \u2013 thanks to an 88th-minute winner. \u201cI think he remembers,\u201d Berhalter said on Friday with a smile. \u201cBeing that competitive, he has to remember that game.\u201d  Twenty-five years later, the US manager will take on the underdog role once again when the Americans meet a favored Dutch side that have yet to taste defeat in 18 matches since Van Gaal took over after last year\u2019s European Championship, conceding only 14 times in that span. Should they buck the odds against the Oranje, the Americans would go through to the last eight of a World Cup for the first time since 2002, when Berhalter\u2019s left foot nearly sent the US into the semi-finals at Germany\u2019s expense. That the biggest game of his three-and-a-half-year tenure will come against the Netherlands carries added meaning for Berhalter, who has become the first man to play for and manage an American side at a World Cup. After leaving the University of North Carolina following his junior season, he cut his teeth with a number of Dutch clubs at the outset of a decade-and-a-half playing career in Europe, signing with Zwolle in 1994, then with Sparta in 1996 and Cambuur Leeuwarden in 1998. It\u2019s no surprise that Dutch football has deeply informed his coaching philosophy. \u201cI learned so much in Holland,\u201d Berhalter said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like, what concepts haven\u2019t I taken from Dutch football? It was a great experience being there. \u201cAfter every training session, you have a debate with your players about it. After every game, you have a talk with people about the game. People love to discuss soccer and you really learn a lot. \u201cI went to Holland just out of university, totally unprepared for professional-level soccer. If I wasn\u2019t in Holland, I don\u2019t think I would have had that background that really helped shape my ideas.\u201d  Berhalter described how his experience in the Netherlands was an awakening to the nuances of the game that weren\u2019t a part of his development back home. \u201cJust about spacing and the positional game, third man, triangles,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a striker, an old striker that I played with when I first got there. His name was Remco Boere. He would yell at me for giving him the ball with too much spin. He wanted balls that came at him straight that I had to hit with my laces. And I wasn\u2019t good enough hitting with my laces, so I had to practice, practice, practice so I could play him a ball that he wanted. \u201cIf you ever laid a ball off to someone and you put it to their wrong foot, they would start yelling at you. How crisp you play passes. There were a lot of details that I was missing that I learned in Holland.\u201d  Berhalter is not the only figure in the US camp with deep ties to the Netherlands. US Soccer sporting director Earnie Stewart, who captained the national team in the famous win over Portugal that launched their 2002 World Cup run, was born in the southern Dutch town of Veghel. Meanwhile US right-back Sergi\u00f1o Dest, the son of a Dutch mother and Surinamese-American father, grew up in Almere and came up through Ajax\u2019s vaunted youth academy. When he was deciding whether to represent the US or the Netherlands at the international level, it was Berhalter\u2019s connection with Dest that helped tip the balance. \u201cAs he transitioned to the professional level, there came some attention from the Dutch side and our side,\u201d Berhalter said. \u201cAnd basically it was about me just making a connection with him, talking to him about what we thought his role could be for us, what the plans are for this group over the next eight years, and then introducing him to his teammates and getting him into our environment.\u201d Said the 22-year-old Dest: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a pretty fun one, playing against the country I was born in. I know almost every single guy over there.\u201d The most pressing question in the US camp ahead of Saturday\u2019s match surrounded the fitness of Christian Pulisic, who suffered a pelvic contusion while scoring the winner in Tuesday\u2019s win-or-go-home match with Iran that sealed the Americans\u2019 progress to the knockouts for the fifth time since 1994. One day after the Chelsea winger said he was taking it day-to-day with the injury before a training session at the team\u2019s Al Rayyan headquarters but \u201cdoing everything in my power to be able to be out there on the field Saturday\u201d, Berhalter offered a slightly rosier assessment. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see him on the training field today,\u201d the manager said. \u201cWhat I think is it looks pretty good, so we\u2019ll have to see him today on the pitch to get confirmation of that.\u201d US Soccer later confirmed Pulisic has been cleared to play against the Dutch. Berhalter was less optimistic about the availability of Josh Sargent, the Norwich City striker who went off with a right ankle injury in the 77th minute of the Iran match. \u201cHe\u2019s another one we\u2019re going to test in training, to see where he\u2019s at,\u201d Berhalter said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to test. At this stage, it\u2019s go time. If you can push through it, you do.\u201d The United States\u2019 have done little to assuage long-running concerns over their ability to produce goals during their time in Qatar, scoring just twice in three matches so far. But they are the only team who went through the group stage without conceding from open play \u2013 and Berhalter is confident the closely knit team play that has seen the Americans go this far will be enough to close what\u2019s an undeniable gap in individual skill. \u201cIt\u2019s tough,\u201d he said. \u201c[The Dutch] have talent. I can see them playing with two strikers, one behind the striker. It could be any combination of who they\u2019ve been playing, but they have some real top-end talent with Memphis Depay and [Cody] Gakpo and if [Steven] Bergwijn plays. \u201cBut for us it\u2019s about the collective. The back four has done a great job. The goalkeeper has done a great job. It\u2019s about team defending, working as a unit, moving collectively. And when we do that, we put the opponent in difficult positions where they can\u2019t access the spaces they want to access. And I think that\u2019s been what we\u2019ve been good at in this tournament so far.\u201d "

                    "body": "1) Strength in depth for Manchester City\nWhen Manchester City and Chelsea met in the FA Cup in 2016, a raft of injuries, a packed schedule and the need to prioritise a looming Champions League match and the League Cup final compelled Manuel Pellegrini to field five teenagers for full City debuts at Stamford Bridge. To nobody\u2019s surprise, his callow side was walloped by their far more experienced hosts and Pellegrini went on to be replaced by one of the few Premier League or Championship managers who treat the world\u2019s oldest cup competition with the utmost respect and seriousness. \u201cIt was honestly one of the proudest moments of my life,\u201d said Guardiola of City\u2019s emphatic 2019 Cup final win, although his team are likely to face far less feeble opposition when they welcome Chelsea. While neither Guardiola nor Graham Potter is likely to field full-strength sides, both have more than enough quality players in reserve to ensure a full-blooded contest. City\u2019s astonishing strength in squad depth could prove crucial. Barry Glendenning\n\nManchester City v Chelsea, Sunday 4.30pm (all times GMT)\n\n\n2) Coventry go to Hollywood\nAs Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney bought Wrexham, it was reported they were acquainted with the legend of Mickey Thomas and teammates\u2019 1992 FA Cup downing of Arsenal. In searching for a club to match their ambitions of creating a streaming franchise by polishing a community asset then surely Coventry came up. Reviving a fallen top-division mainstay lost in the wilderness and staring down homelessness would make for quite the Hollywood narrative, though perhaps the budget was beyond them. Coventry is another club inextricably linked with the FA Cup. Many members of Generation X will recall their 1987 final victory as the finest of all, and in their manager Mark Robins comes another name written deep into the competition\u2019s lore, as the unassuming saviour of Alex Ferguson\u2019s Manchester United regime in 1990. Beating Coventry, 14th in the Championship, and reaching the fourth round would be a highly significant storyline for the National League club\u2019s owners to bask in. John Brewin\n\nCoventry v Wrexham, Saturday 5.30pm\n\n\n3) A seismic 2002 shock revisited\nThis weekend marks the 21st anniversary of the third round tie in which Cardiff City, then a third tier side, famously dumped out high-flying Leeds United at Ninian Park. A huge giantkilling, it came to be recognised as the first of many dominos to fall in the subsequent decline, a financial meltdown that led to the phrase \u201cdoing a Leeds\u201d entering the football vernacular and the club itself entering League One at the lowest ebb of their 16-year absence from the top flight. Enmity has simmered between fans of the two clubs and in 22 subsequent meetings, Cardiff have notched up 14 wins compared to Leeds\u2019 return of just three. While the FA Cup is unlikely to feature prominently on Jesse Marsch\u2019s list of priorities, any failure to take his first ever match in the competition seriously will not be tolerated by Leeds fans travelling to the Cardiff City Stadium. BG\n\nCardiff v Leeds, Sunday 2pm\n\n\n4) Howe has learned defensive lessons\nThe Newcastle United that will emerge from the Hillsborough tunnel on Saturday is, in many ways, the antithesis of what most people perceived an Eddie Howe team to be. As Bournemouth manager, Howe was seen as an inspired attacking coach but not so hot defensively. Such criticism stung and during his sabbatical between leaving that post and joining Newcastle last November, made a point of brushing up on defensive tactics, while also conducting study visits to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. Diego Simeone offered masterclasses in the streetwise dark arts of gamesmanship. As Arsenal discovered on Tuesday, Newcastle know how to waste time when it suits them. They are also mean at the back and have conceded only 11 goals in 18 Premier League games this season, keeping 10 clean sheets. Having Sven Botman on the left side of central defence helps immeasurably. Darren Moore\u2019s Sheffield Wednesday, currently flying high in League One, will be hoping Botman is rested for the trip to South Yorkshire. Moore might be mindful of Howe\u2019s recent admission: \u201cI had the reputation of not being a good defensive coach and I didn\u2019t particularly like that.\u201d Louise Taylor\n\nSheffield Wednesday v Newcastle, Saturday 6pm\n\n5) Gakpo effect could further weary Wolves\nWolves manager, Julen Lopetegui, is unhappy that Liverpool have two extra days to recover and prepare for their third round tie at Anfield, and his mood will not be improved by the prospect of facing a fresh and fit Cody Gakpo as J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s new signing prepares to make his club debut. Gakpo\u2019s transfer was confirmed 10 days ago, with the 23-year-old costing an initial \u20ac40m from PSV Eindhoven rising to \u20ac50m, but a post-World Cup holiday and paperwork issues meant he was not considered for Monday\u2019s Premier League defeat at Brentford. Gakpo\u2019s last competitive outing was on 9 December in the Netherlands\u2019 tempestuous quarter-final penalties loss to Argentina. But with the World Cup star offering an enticing solution to Liverpool\u2019s problems on the left flank \u2013 and needing game-time to shake off the Qatar rust \u2013 a weary Wolves in the FA Cup provides an ideal opportunity for Anfield to welcome its latest recruit. Andy Hunter\n\nLiverpool v Wolves, Saturday 8pm\n\n6) Ferguson riding crest of youthful wave\nThis year marks the 40th anniversary of Brighton reaching the FA Cup Final, a high-point paired with relegation from the old First Division. No such worries about the drop this season, with Roberto De Zerbi\u2019s team pushing for a European place, so might a Cup run be in order? A long trip to Middlesbrough begins the journey, where they will face a club revived by Michael Carrick since he took over in October. Three wins over Christmas have cemented a playoff position. De Zerbi will undoubtedly shuffle his pack but he may well choose to ride the wave currently created by Evan Ferguson after goals against both Arsenal and Everton. Back in Ireland, there is genuine excitement about the Dubliner, son of the former Under-21 international Barry. At 18 years and 76 days, Ferguson Jr scored and supplied an assist on his first start at Goodison, the second-youngest to do so in the Premier League after Michael Owen in 1997. JB\n\nMiddlesbrough v Brighton, Saturday 3pm\n\n7) Respite from promotion grind for Chesterfield\nIn apparent financial meltdown off the pitch but in form on it, West Brom travel to Derbyshire to take on Chesterfield, currently battling to win promotion from the National League during their fifth year in non-League purgatory. The authors of one of the greatest FA Cup fairytales ever written when they made it to a semi-final against Middlesbrough as a third division side in 1997, Chesterfield were subsequently robbed due to the absence of goal-line technology. These days, the Spireites can only dream of such epic \u201cfailure\u201d but may have to take on West Brom without their manager Paul Cook to guide them from the technical area. The 55-year-old is still waiting to hear from FA HQ if he\u2019s facing a ban for the touchline tantrum that earned him the yellow and red cards that made him a Boxing Day viral sensation. BG\n\nChesterfield v West Brom, Saturday 3pm\n\n\n8) Spurs and Pompey both under pressure\nAntonio Conte has bittersweet memories of the FA Cup, after being sacked by Chelsea despite winning the competition in 2018. His recent media appearances suggest he may soon enough have bittersweet memories of Tottenham though his grumblings came to an end with Wednesday\u2019s 4-0 win at Crystal Palace as Harry Kane came back to form. Having lately dredged through his squad to give game time to the likes of Bryan Gil and Pape Sarr, also returning Oliver Skipp to the starting lineup, there is little sense in predicting Conte\u2019s Saturday team selection. Danny Cowley, a manager perhaps even more animated on the sidelines than the Italian, would have been Conte\u2019s opposite number only to be sacked in midweek as a team expected to be competing for promotion from League One languishes in mid-table. JB\n\nTottenham v Portsmouth, Saturday 12.30pm\n\n9) Another fairytale run for Boreham Wood?\nMid-table in the National League and through to the third round for the third consecutive season, Boreham Wood are the lowest ranked team left in this season\u2019s FA Cup and might have hoped to welcome more glamorous opposition than Accrington Stanley. Last season, they saw off AFC Wimbledon at this stage and went on to knock out Bournemouth before losing to Everton, earning no end of plaudits and plenty of much-needed post-pandemic cash in the process. With the experience of that run behind him, manager Luke Garrard will fancy his chances against an out-of-sorts side 41 places above his in the pyramid. In the last round, Boreham Wood travelled to the Memorial Ground and knocked out Bristol Rovers, currently sitting nine places clear of Accrington in the League One table. BG\n\nBoreham Wood v Accrington Stanley, Saturday 3pm\n\n\n10) Renewed United a tough ask for Lampard\nIf Manchester United knock Everton out, Erik ten Hag\u2019s men will chalk up a 10th victory in 11 matches in all competitions. If they do not it would represent a shock, testament to the work the Dutchman has done thus far and seeks to continue. The United he has constructed can play on the break and in possession and despite the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo and Jadon Sancho being unavailable for selection, is able to rotate personnel and still win. That was evident in Harry Maguire and Victor Lindel\u00f6f being a successful centre-back pairing versus Bournemouth and Alejandro Garnacho, on for the injured Donny van de Beek, creating Marcus Rashford\u2019s third. The thought remains that United remain a work-in-progress and as Frank Lampard desperately needs a win to prevent being issued a P45, the result could still go the other way. Jamie Jackson\n\nManchester United v Everton, Friday 8pm\n"

                    "body": "Back in the early days of his career, Jordan Henderson felt he was the exception. His rule was simple \u2013 no alcohol during the season \u2013 and it is one he has always stuck to. The Liverpool and England midfielder was acutely aware of the correlation between sacrifice and achievement. \u201cWhereas now when I look, I\u2019d say the exception is to drink,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of top players don\u2019t drink in general. A lot of the Liverpool squad don\u2019t drink.\u201d  Which inspires the obvious question \u2013 who are the boozers in the squad? \u201cI can\u2019t throw them under the bus,\u201d he says, laughing. It is easy to say professional footballers ought to be teetotal; they are essentially paid to stay fit and so abstention must be a part of the bargain. Their fitness regimes and clean-living choices are therefore dismissed, at times; there is the failure to acknowledge them, to respect them. Which is a little harsh. But to listen to Henderson, now 32 and a senior statesman for club and country, is to have a run-through of why it is all worthwhile. And why he hopes it will continue to be so for a number of years. Henderson carried an injury into the European Championship in the summer of 2021, which restricted him to substitute appearances, and he carried one out of it, too. But when Liverpool played in every game that was possible for them last season \u2013 63 in total \u2013 Henderson featured in 57. \u201cI think I played more games than anyone else in Europe,\u201d he says. This time, Henderson picked up a hamstring problem against Newcastle on 31 August and has missed Liverpool\u2019s past three matches. But he says he knew since the beginning of last week that he would be fit for England and their Nations League ties against Italy on Friday and Germany on Monday, the rehabilitation having quickly come to look good. And if his thoughts are fixed on the World Cup in Qatar that kicks off on 20 November, the finals are not the limit of his international ambitions. \u201cI look at some players still playing internationals at 36 and 37,\u201d he says. \u201cSo it just depends on how you feel physically and I feel very good. Physically, it\u2019s not an issue and I\u2019m still excited being here with England. If that wasn\u2019t the case then I would maybe think about that [retiring from internationals] but I\u2019m always excited about being called up.  \u201cMy biggest dream as a kid was to play for England and that will never change. I want to do it as long as possible and play my part. Is Qatar the last chance to win something? I hope not. I still feel good.\u201d Henderson is asked whether he feels fitter than he did when he was 20 and making his way in the game at his hometown club, Sunderland. \u201cI don\u2019t know about that because I was pretty fit then but I know what you mean,\u201d he says. \u201cPhysically, I feel like I\u2019m in such a good spot \u2013 it\u2019s a big part of how I play the game and it\u2019s a reflection of how seriously I take the game off the pitch, as well. \u201cEverything has developed so much from when I was younger like nutrition and recovery, although I\u2019ve always done those sort of things anyway. I\u2019ve never done that [drunk alcohol during the season] and I\u2019ve always eaten the right things. It was always in me. I never wanted to go out drinking or doing anything like that. It was always football, football, football.\u201d Henderson no longer feels like a first-choice selection for Gareth Southgate, even though he retains the England manager\u2019s faith. Southgate has come to prefer Declan Rice and Kalvin Phillips in the middle of his team as he also tries to manage the urgent claims of Jude Bellingham. Henderson has started three times for England since before the Euros; in light of his exertions for Liverpool he was rested from the squad that struggled in the opening quartet of Nations League fixtures last June. Southgate said there was no point in pushing Henderson through those games because he already knew what he could do. Now, with Phillips injured, Henderson could have the opportunity to show it again. For him and everyone in the England setup, Italy will always be synonymous with the Euro final at Wembley and the agony of the penalty shootout defeat. \u201cYou never get over bad defeats properly,\u201d he says. \u201cIt will always stay inside, although that can be a good thing. You can use it as extra motivation, a bit of burning desire to put things right.\u201d The World Cup looms large. After the Germany tie, the next time England get together will be for the finals and the opening group match against Iran on 21 November. So how does Henderson see it all? \u201cI always feel with England that we have a chance to win \u2013 right from the first time I came into the setup at 20 years old,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s always been that dreaming and wanting to achieve something with England. Actually getting it over the line and being part of that \u2026 I keep striving for that. \u201cHopefully, the quality we\u2019ve got and our experiences of the last few years will put us in good stead.\u201d"

                    "body": "Leah Williamson, the England captain, will miss the team\u2019s Wembley showdown with the World Cup holders, USA, on Friday and the match against the Czech Republic on Tuesday following assessment on an injury sustained in training. Williamson, who was seen in a boot and on crutches at England\u2019s training base in south-west London, was confirmed as having returned to Arsenal for her rehabilitation, with details of her injury undisclosed. She joins Alessia Russo and Lucy Parker, who have also left the camp with injury.  Chloe Kelly, the forward who scored the winner against Germany in the Euro 2022 final in the summer, said: \u201cLeah\u2019s a great leader and of course we\u2019ll miss her. We have such great depth in our squad and such great strength in our squad. There are so many great leaders with experience. \u201cSo, it\u2019s all about coming together in these moments when you do lose a player like Leah and supporting Leah now in her rehab.\u201d The Lionesses are back at the hotel and training base in Teddington that hosted them during the historic summer and Kelly is hoping that can inspire some good memories. \u201cWhen we came back into the Lensbury it literally felt like we were back and that we\u2019d only been away for a few days,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cI feel like our mindset has changed on to the World Cup. We had such a great summer and that gives you so much positive energy around the group, everyone is just excited to learn and excited to get back on the pitch together. We had so much fun off the pitch too. It was brilliant, we just enjoyed each other\u2019s company and we had great times together as a team. So coming back here brings back so many memories.\u201d  The manager, Sarina Wiegman, has spoken about a need to look forward to the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand next summer and not spend time dwelling on the European Championship win. \u201cThat\u2019s definitely true,\u201d Kelly said, \u201cbut it\u2019s also about reflecting on the summer and where we can be even better. Of course, next year we have another tournament and with it being so close together it gives you the opportunity to reflect on where you can improve, but it being around the corner it doesn\u2019t give you too long. You can\u2019t celebrate for too long.\u201d The world champions, whose last defeat was at the Olympic Games against Canada 14 months ago, travel to England with a much-changed side from the one that beat them in the 2019 World Cup semi\u2011final. \u201cIt\u2019s another young team with young players but we expect another physical challenge for us,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cThe league over there is brilliant, too. We need to know the threats they pose, technically as well, because they\u2019re a great team and we can\u2019t get carried away with thinking they\u2019re just physical. They\u2019re going to challenge us in different ways and we have to be ready for that challenge.\u201d After a whirlwind summer, Kelly is fuelled by a desire for more success and admitted it is what keeps her grounded. \u201cIt is quite easy, to be fair,\u201d Kelly said of keeping her feet on the ground. \u201cBecause I want to experience that winning feeling even more. One medal round your neck is probably not enough. I just want to win. To do it with such a great bunch of girls it makes you so much more hungry to get back on the pitch. \u201cI was so excited to just get back on the pitch and learn, because obviously I am so young so I want to experience these winning feelings so much more in my career.\u201d"

Addressing the opening ceremony overnight, the UN chief, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said we are on the \u201chighway to climate hell\u201d with our foot on the accelerator, while Al Gore warned about the \u201cculture of death\u201d spawned by our reliance on fossil fuels.

                    "body": "Three years and one month since his last match in charge, Warren Gatland has returned to his old job as the head coach of Wales. The Welsh Rugby Union sacked the man who took over from him, Wayne Pivac, on Monday, so they could bring Gatland back from New Zealand on a four-year deal as the head coach through to the 2027 World Cup in Australia. Wales won 13 matches out of 34 under Pivac, a run that ended with recent home defeats against Georgia and Australia in the autumn series. In a statement released by the WRU, Pivac said he was \u201csad to stand down\u201d but conceded his team\u2019s results had been \u201cinconsistent\u201d. It was only last year that Wales won the Six Nations, while this summer they won an away Test against South Africa for the first time in their history when they beat the Springboks 13-12 in Bloemfontein. Despite that, recent results have led to them dropping to ninth in the world rankings. \u201cThis is one of the toughest calls to make in sport, but the review process has reached its conclusion and we have acted quickly and efficiently in the very best interests of our national team,\u201d the WRU\u2019s chief executive, Steve Phillips, said. \u201cUltimately we are in the results business and we have agreed with Wayne that the current trajectory for Wales is not where we want it to be.\u201d  So back to Gatland it is. His first term as Wales\u2019s coach lasted 12 years and 124 Tests, in which time the team won three grand slams, as well as another Six Nations title, and finished fourth at the 2011 and 2019 World Cups. When he left the job, after a 40-17 defeat against New Zealand in the third-place playoff at the 2019 tournament, he spoke about how he hoped the team would \u201ccontinue to build on what we have achieved\u201d and said \u201cthe opportunity for the next group is to come in and improve on what we have created\u201d. He also said \u201cit would break my heart if Wales went back into the doldrums\u201d, which is the course they have been on recently. Gatland had spent the past three years coaching the Chiefs in Super Rugby, with a sabbatical when he led the British &amp; Irish Lions to South Africa last year. He said he was \u201cvery much looking forward\u201d to returning to Wales. \u201cThis is an opportunity to achieve something with a talented group of players in a country so passionate about rugby. A country which made my family and I so welcome, when we first arrived there 15 years ago, and all the time we were there.\u201d He will find that the playing group is much the same as it was when he left, and so are many of the back room staff. A lot of the bigger problems facing the game in Wales will feel pretty familiar, too. Phillips promised the appointment \u201cis no quick fix, nor sticking plaster\u201d but \u201cpart of our long-term planning for the game in Wales\u201d. The four regions are in dispute with the WRU about finances, and are currently blocked from signing new recruits and renewing existing contracts. \u201cThere will be new challenges as there always is with a change in head coach,\u201d said Gatland, \u201cbut for me the environment, the players and their families will always come first. We must prepare to the best of our ability in the time available. We will value and respect each other, we will work hard and, if we get this right together, performances and results will follow.\u201d The move will also have ramifications for the Rugby Football Union, which is currently running its own review into the team performance under Eddie Jones. Gatland had been one of the leading contenders to take over from Jones."

I\u2019ve worked extremely hard in this campaign.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t even thought about it. I need a break, a rest and no doubt I\u2019ll have some good discussions with the organisation.\u201d\nArnold described Messi \u2013 who scored in his 1,000th career game \u2013 as \u201cincredible, one of the greatest ever\u201d, and said he had worked with his squad on ensuring they were not in awe of the seven-time Ballon d\u2019Or while on the field.\n\u201cBut wow, he\u2019s remarkable,\u201d he said. \u201cI had the privilege of playing against Diego Maradona, and now coaching against Messi. They\u2019re both wonderful players, and Argentina should be so proud and happy to have players of that calibre.\u201d\nYet despite the success of his team, who made the Socceroos\u2019 deepest run at a finals since 2006 and whose two wins earned the most points at the group stage to date, he still \u201cfelt we failed tonight\u201d.\n\u201cI just wanted to win so badly for the nation, the fans and the game of football in Australia,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cMaking the last 16 wasn\u2019t enough \u2013 I wanted more. That\u2019s just me. I know some people may be happy with it, but that\u2019s just the way I am.\u201d\nArnold was quick to praise captain and goalkeeper Mat Ryan, whose error gifted Argentina their second goal, saying \u201ceveryone makes mistakes, he\u2019s been a fantastic captain and fantastic player\u201d.\n\u201cI just said to the boys I couldn\u2019t be more proud of the effort and everything they gave to me, and to the nation,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s been a four-and-a-half-year journey, a tough journey for everyone. We\u2019re a bit disappointed as we could\u2019ve got something more out of it, but I hope Australia is proud of these players. I thank them for all their work, the effort they put in through this campaign. It\u2019s about making the nation proud, and I\u2019m sure we did that.\n\u201cEveryone said before we came here we were the worst Socceroo team ever to qualify for a World Cup, but that\u2019s gone now. We\u2019ve done exceptionally well, making the last 16 and winning two games. The mixture of the young boys and senior boys has worked well.\u201d\n\nArnold has been a strong advocate for football development in Australia, having only days ago expressed \u201cmassive concerns\u201d and called for more funds and a thorough review of the country\u2019s development structures.\n\u201cWe have a lot to look at in Australian football,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sport that unites the nation \u2013 in my view it\u2019s one of two teams that does unite the nation. We need to spend money and get help from the government to put some money into the game and develop kids.\n\u201cOne thing I\u2019d love to see before I finish up completely from football is that the government build us a house \u2013 we\u2019ve been homeless since I\u2019ve been involved for 37 years \u2013 a facility that can inspire, something like the AIS, something the government can fund for the national teams and for the good of Australian football.\u201d"

But after a dramatic penalty shootout, there was delight in Buenos Aires that Argentina will be bringing home football\u2019s most coveted trophy.\nIn La Puerta Roja, a bar in the downtown San Telmo district, so many people packed in early to watch the final that there was a queue outside an hour and a half before kickoff. The air smelled of adrenaline and the commentators could barely be heard over the din of yelling, hands banging on tables, and the occasional glass smashing.\nLionel Messi\u2019s converted penalty to open the scoring was met with screams of euphoria. The second goal, from \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda, led to moshpits. The mood was jubilant as the second half wore on. Fans in sky blue and white striped jerseys, glitter flags smeared across arms and cheeks, embraced and jumped.\nTwo goals in two minutes from France\u2019s Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 dampened the mood like an ice bath. As the game went into extra time, at least one person was breathing into a paper bag.\n\n\u201cMy tummy hurts,\u201d one of the bar staff said. By the time it went to penalties, the place felt \u2013 for better or for worse \u2013 like a powder keg. The Argentina goalkeeper Emiliano Mart\u00ednez saved one penalty, another French effort went wide, and Gonzalo Montiel\u2019s final kick clinched victory.\n\u201cThis is the greatest thing that could happen, like paradise,\u201d said Juan Pablo Iglesias, 48. In his arms was his eight-year-old son, Manuel, tears of joy rolling down his face. \u201cWe\u2019re champions,\u201d the father said, turning to his child. \u201cWe\u2019re the greatest in the world!\u201d\nOutside, 22-year-old Iara Diaz described the mood as \u201cecstatic\u201d. When Mbapp\u00e9 had equalised with 10 minutes of normal time to go, \u201cI wanted to break everything,\u201d she said, pinching her fingers in a gesture of frustration. This had been billed as Messi\u2019s last chance to win the World Cup. \u201cHe badly deserved this,\u201d Diaz said, almost bursting into tears as she said his name. Argentina last won the tournament in 1986, the year Maradona\u2019s \u201cHand of God\u201d goal helped knock England out.\nAfter the game, fans flocked to the Obelisk in central Buenos Aires, the streets a carnivalesque cacophony of cheers, car horns, cumbia music and bullhorns. People started impromptu drumming bands with upturned paint buckets and cans, while slabs of beef grilled on the asados (barbecues), its scent filling the air of a brilliant sunny afternoon.\n\nThroughout this tournament there has been a sense that Argentina\u2019s national psyche needed a victory. The country has been emerging from a biting economic recession, a currency crisis, and inflation is running at almost 100%. Buenos Aires had one of the longest Covid lockdowns in the world. Last week the vice-president and two-term former president Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner was sentenced to six years in jail on corruption charges, a verdict that sharpened stark political divides.\nIn the circumstances, La Scaloneta \u2013 as the team are affectionately known \u2013 bringing home the trophy offers a chance for people to put aside their differences and bond.\nAt the start of the tournament, fans were up at the crack of dawn howling at their televisions as the team unexpectedly lost their first match to Saudi Arabia. In the quarter-finals Argentina let slip a 2-0 lead against the Netherlands but prevailed in a shootout, and after they waltzed through their semi-final against Croatia it felt as if their star was rising.\nBefore the final, Argentina\u2019s president, Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez, tweeted at his French counterpart: \u201cDear friend Emmanuel Macron, I hold great affection for you and I wish you the best for the future. Except for on Sunday. Argentina is my marvelous country, and it\u2019s Latin America! Go, light blue and white!\u201d\nMartina Lovign\u00e9, a languages teacher from Messi\u2019s home town of Rosario, watched the match outside an Argentinian bar in the French capital. \u201cIt\u2019s an enormous joy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a really beautiful feeling to see the colours of the [Argentinian national] shirt on display here in the streets of Paris. The streets were at a standstill during the match, now they\u2019ve gone sadly back to their normal rhythm and, well, the Argentinians are happy.\u201d"

                    "body": "They are the last England side left at this year\u2019s Rugby League World Cup and for one of the stars of the hosts\u2019 wheelchair side, Friday\u2019s final against France has been a decade in the making. Sebastien Bechara vividly remembers the moment his life changed forever. Bechara was born in Nottingham but moved to France at the age of nine, where he became a keen sportsman and a motorcycle enthusiast. But at the age of 18, tragedy struck. \u201cMe and my dad were huge fans of motorcycles and I got my first one at 18, but I had a really bad accident in the south of France,\u201d he says.  \u201cThey kept trying to fix my leg, but after a month they decided to amputate it because it just wasn\u2019t fixable. So there I was, an amputee at the age of 18.\u201d Laid in a hospital bed in the summer of 2012 with no idea what his future would hold, Bechara was struck by what he saw on television. \u201cI was watching the London Paralympics and from then on I didn\u2019t even care about what had happened to my leg \u2013 I just knew that in four years I wanted to be there representing my country.\u201d  Bechara set his sights on becoming a Paralympic swimmer until a chance meeting with Cyril Torres, who was the captain of France\u2019s wheelchair rugby side as the sport was beginning to establish itself. \u201cI never doubted I\u2019d find a sport that suited me, but when I discovered wheelchair rugby it was incredible. The sport has played a massive part in shaping my life and I\u2019ve met fellow amputees who have helped me on my own journey.\u201d And now, despite spending the majority of his life in France and playing for Catalans Dragons\u2019 wheelchair side, Bechara is one win away from fulfilling his dream of helping England win a Rugby League World Cup. The opposition is France in a meeting of the two best teams in the world, just as it was five years ago when the French won 38-34 in a thrilling final in Perpignan. This year, however, the circumstances are markedly different.  Not only are England on home soil but wheelchair rugby league has become a mainstream phenomenon thanks to the platform the World Cup has provided, and the high-intensity, thoroughly entertaining nature of the sport. Manchester Central will be a 5,000 sellout on Friday evening, and Bechara understands the pressure that comes with being the last England team left after the men and women were eliminated in their respective semi-finals. \u201cI\u2019m so in love with this sport and seeing it explode on to the mainstream now. I feel like having played it for so long, I\u2019m a proud parent watching the sport grow up and enjoy success,\u201d Bechara smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible to see the love and respect the sport is getting in this country now. We\u2019re getting stopped by people in the streets, it\u2019s crazy. People can see what a great sport this is, but we\u2019ve got a job to do on Friday night. \u201cI haven\u2019t forgotten what happened five years ago. We were winning until the final stages and perhaps should have won. I think I\u2019ve watched the game back 150 times. I\u2019m so gutted for the men and the women getting knocked out, but all English hopes now rest with us. We can take that pressure and run with it because to have the country behind you, being live on the BBC when just a few years ago we were playing in empty sports halls and nobody cared \u2026 these are the moments you dream of.\u201d Bechara is also aware that when England take to the court on Friday, there will be young men and women watching who are coming to terms with their own personal trauma, just as he was a decade ago. But now, it is wheelchair rugby league which can serve as the inspiration. \u201cI haven\u2019t thought about that before, but I hope that\u2019s true,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s people going through difficult times. People coming to terms with being amputees, or disabled. And I hope those people can see that it doesn\u2019t mean life is finished. It can be the start of a brilliant new journey.\u201d"

                    "body": "Lucas Hernandez was on the ground, writhing in pain with a stretcher on its way. Hugo Lloris could at least get back up but was enduring another sort of agony entirely, having dived too low when the ball was heading for the net\u2019s roof.\nCraig Goodwin got on the ground of his own accord, sliding to his knees in the ecstasy of a 30\u2011year\u2011old South Australian journeyman who had just scored nine minutes into his first World Cup. Ibrahima Konat\u00e9 was stunned. Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 hung his head. Was this the champion\u2019s curse? Were Australia about to pull a Saudi Arabia?\nThat is not how this story ended, but it did it cater well to the narrative of France\u2019s temperament. Zinedine Zidane was surely watching, finger\u2011steepling from afar, scheming after reports he has reached a preliminary agreement to take over from Didier Deschamps after the tournament.\n\nThe alternative narrative is that France are notoriously slow starters at World Cup finals and they needed just another 18 minutes for Adrien Rabiot to equalise and another five after that for Olivier Giroud to score the first of his two goals. Giroud is now level with Thierry Henry\u2019s all-time record of 51.\nMbapp\u00e9 added to the scoreline after the break for a victory that after Denmark\u2019s earlier stalemate with Tunisia has the title holders on track to top this group.\nThat the game did not blow out further was partly through France\u2019s profligacy \u2013 they had 23 shots to Australia\u2019s four \u2013 and partly Australia\u2019s tenacity in the face of this exorbitantly talented team.\n\nThe gulf in class is undeniably vast, even when, at one brief point in the second half, the Socceroos had 12 players on the pitch. Even without the injured Paul Pogba, N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 and Karim Benzema et al, France\u2019s depth is frightening. Their 38th-ranked counterparts are young and inexperienced \u2013 half of the squad have 10 caps or fewer and only four more than 50. They are viewed internationally as little more than fodder for Golden Boot aspirants.\nAnd yet, in a similar manner to an identical opening fixture four years ago, when France won by a whisker after a deflected own goal, Australia defended stoutly. The pre\u2011match rhetoric from the head coach, Graham Arnold, about sending out \u201c11 boxing kangaroos\u201d was working a treat. At one point in the first half Jackson Irvine floored Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni with a ferocious sliding challenge. Midway through the second, Kye Rowles did a number on Mbapp\u00e9.\nAfter the early exchanges, during which Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 had his way with Aziz Behich and Mbapp\u00e9 toyed with Nathaniel Atkinson, Australia cleared an ominous corner and then settled. Aaron Mooy recycled possession at the base of midfield as his teammates set about attempting to break down France\u2019s defensive block. Les Bleus simply watched their opponents\u2019 comfortable holding pattern, letting them play but offering no clear opening.\n\nThe opening goal came from nowhere. Stoke\u2019s Harry Souttar unleashed a long diagonal ball that Mat Leckie brought down deftly, skipped past Lucas Hernandez and clipped a teasing cross that fizzed enticingly across the face of goal until Goodwin pounced and the net bulged as Lloris leapt in vain.\nNot long afterwards, Mitchell Duke shot and only just missed from at least 25 yards. An upset was brewing. Well, it might have been if not for the aforementioned talent at Deschamps\u2019s disposal. Mbapp\u00e9 and Demeb\u00e9l\u00e9 set about making hay in the wide areas, pushing Australia deeper and deeper into their own half and then their own third, using Antoine Griezmann to confuse the defence.\nThat was especially evident after Griezmann forced a corner, which did not clear the first defender. But when the ball landed at Theo Hernandez\u2019s feet he curled it brilliantly for Rabiot, completely unmarked, to head home past Mat Ryan.\nGiroud had been on the hunt from the start. The 36-year-old forward endured a barren 2018 finals and the record books were beckoning. He headed one attempt high, but minutes later made it count when Atkinson was caught out of possession.\n\nTwo quickfire goals in the second half put the game to bed. France bore down and Australia struggled to clear their lines. They failed entirely in the 68th minute when Mbapp\u00e9 squeezed between the two centre\u2011backs in the nick of time to head home Demb\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019s cross.\nMbapp\u00e9 then turned provider, dropping the shoulder and darting inside for a cross that gave Giroud his record\u2011equaller. He was subbed off late to warm applause.\nThis display was not without hairy moments, most notably when Irvine hit the post while Lloris simply stood there and watched, as if in slow motion. He had never been luckier for that lick of paint.\nThe more wasteful moments, too, will be tested by stronger opposition. Griezmann shot wide, Mbapp\u00e9 hit row Z in front of an open goal and an overhead effort from Giroud was askew.\nBut it already seems likely France will become the second champions in the past five World Cup tournaments to advance from the group stage."

                    "body": "DUE SOUTH? While confidence is a preference for the habitual voyeur of what is known as parklife, it is also something the FA has expressed in Gareth Southgate following England\u2019s decidedly poor showing in their recent run of Nations League fixtures. After England were booed by their own supporters following a 4-0 defeat at the hands of Hungary at Molineux, the radio switchboards in Knee-Jerk FM studios the length and breadth of the country predictably lit up like Christmas trees, as one Angry Ranty Fan after another called for Southgate\u2019s immediate dismissal just five months and two friendlies before the Human Rights World Cup in Qatar. While there is no doubting Southgate\u2019s abilities as a politician, diplomat, pizza salesman and communicator, valid questions do remain over his coaching abilities and in-game decision-making. His results at major tournaments provide compelling evidence he is the second most successful coach in England\u2019s history, but it\u2019s worth bearing in mind that his side enjoyed the easiest imaginable run to a World Cup semi-final in Russia before going out to a team they should probably have beaten, then let Italy off the hook before losing last summer\u2019s Euros final on spot-kicks.  \u201cPrior to Gareth being the manager there was not the pride of wearing the England shirt,\u201d tooted FA chair Debbie Hewitt, in defence of Southgate. \u201cThere was a club rivalry we would read about, players not getting on. He\u2019s changed that beyond recognition and I\u2019ve seen that for myself. I\u2019ve worked in business and Gareth\u2019s skills, his high IQ, would make him a chief executive in any sphere. That resilience and accountability, there\u2019s no slouched shoulders and that\u2019s what you want in an England manager. We have confidence in Gareth for all the reasons I described and I think that\u2019s the important thing. And it\u2019s particularly important going into the biggest tournament.\u201d While taking the blame for things which aren\u2019t necessarily our fault has long been a Fiver forte, our inability to stand up straight as a result of years being forced to work in the crawlspace under Fiver Towers is likely to rule the world\u2019s most daily football email out of contention for the England job whenever Southgate does eventually quit or get the heave-ho. For now, however, he and his players have Qatar to think about, not least the manner in which they plan to make a stand against \u2013 and handle the inevitable questions about \u2013 the abuses visited upon migrant workers by the hosts. \u201cAs far as the team is concerned, they are playing in Qatar and it\u2019s inevitable they will be asked questions about human rights,\u201d said Hewitt. \u201cIn fact, they are curious and want to learn and want to think about the best way that they can make a difference. Ultimately, we will discuss with the team and with Gareth what we feel is the best statement we can make, particularly about leaving behind a legacy with the rest of our football colleagues internationally.\u201d And though the FA continues to talk a good game about addressing this decidedly thorny issue, as the clock ticks down to the tournament kick-off in November, it seems remarkable that a mere 12 years after finding out Qatar would be staging the finals, it still appears to have nothing resembling a plan. Of course, talk is better than nothing, but much like a World Cup infrastructure being built by migrant workers who have slaved away in sweltering conditions for the past decade, it also comes cheap.

FIVER LETTERS \u201cRe: fans booing players they once loved on their return with their new club (yesterday\u2019s Fiver), this is by no means inevitable. In my nearly 60 years of watching Blackeye Rovers, I reckon there have been at least as many welcomes for past heroes who have moved on as venom. In my experience it depends on what they\u2019ve contributed; how they have left and where they have ended up. Nevertheless, the one time I felt really ashamed as a Rovers fan was when Alan Shearer first returned to Ewood Park in a Newcastle shirt and a section of fans actually booed him. Thankfully, on subsequent visits he received the warm reception he warranted\u201d \u2013 John Myles. \u201cI usually agree with Noble Francis, but I think he might be aiming at the wrong target this time (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters). Jaap Stam is implying that recent managers at Manchester United have not been backed by the board. I think, if you looked at the huge sums they have spent on players in the last five or six years, the board could justifiably claim to have supported each manager very well indeed. The fact that the billion-pound squad is still useless and in need of a complete rebuild is not totally down to the board\u201d \u2013 Geoff Saunders. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.

                    "body": "It does not require a degree in the science of rockets to suggest English rugby needs an upbeat end to a problematic year. If parliamentary select committee hearings now involve an element of grandstanding, this week\u2019s stark conclusion \u2013 \u201cfailure on an epic scale\u201d \u2013 is not something the Rugby Football Union will be keen to hear echoing around Twickenham after the national team\u2019s final autumn Test against a pumped-up South Africa. To some the messy financial collapse of Worcester and Wasps might appear peripheral to England\u2019s progress under Eddie Jones and certainly to a home stadium full to the brim with 82,000 thirsty punters. The truth of the matter is that all those things are directly linked to the same conundrum, namely the split personality that continues to hold back the sport even in its red rose heartlands. Because what exactly is the real England, on and off the field? No one seems entirely sure. The domestic Premiership is arguably as watchable as it has ever been yet the sums still do not add up. The current matchday experience at Twickenham feels as if somebody is trying to stage a rave in an old people\u2019s home, which rarely pleases anyone. And the team? Still apparently a work in progress after what has been, to date, an inconclusive November.  So just as now is the time for all English rugby\u2019s multiple stakeholders to agree sweeping reform can no longer be delayed, this would be an equally good moment for those wearing white to display greater clarity and, above all, consistency. Having run the All Blacks ragged in the last 10 minutes last Saturday, how about flicking the turbo switch slightly earlier than the 70th minute? And if the last World Cup final in Japan was just one of those bad days that occasionally happen, is this not a prime opportunity for the home pack to right a few nagging wrongs? Jones, for one, still has painful images of 2019 seared across his memory: \u201cI have a 5G vision of it now. You never forget that moment, when you\u2019re standing on the field and you see the opposition getting their gold medals. You hear the crowd going crazy and you\u2019re standing there like a spectator. All the work you\u2019ve done over a long period of time means nothing to you. That never leaves you. There will always be something in the players who played in that game. You can never change the result but you can change the feeling you have. That\u2019s the opportunity for a number of our players this weekend.\u201d It helps to explain Jones\u2019s ongoing obsession with winning next year\u2019s World Cup in France at the exclusion of pretty much everything else. Viewed through that narrow prism this game takes on an additional importance, as will the Six Nations games against France and Ireland next March. If England are unable to overcome any of the teams ranked above them now, it is going to be even harder next autumn. In that regard it was interesting to hear Jonny May, one of the survivors of 2019, suggest this week that, while England are behind where they were at the corresponding stage prior to the last World Cup, their potential is now greater. \u201cWe were probably further ahead in the journey of what we were as a team but it was a narrower gameplan,\u201d said May. \u201cThis broader gameplan [that] we\u2019re trying to get to terms with is harder to achieve.\u201d  In other words England are aiming higher, pinning a huge amount on the ability to adapt their game as and when required. We have heard this theory recited for years, of course, the downside being the ever changing cast of players auditioning for specific roles. For all the talk of \u2018finishers\u2019 being as valuable as \u2018starters\u2019 it still feels curious that Ellis Genge can be named in World Rugby\u2019s team of the year last Sunday and, six days later, not make England\u2019s run-on side for such a huge fixture. Jack Willis, similarly, is a good enough player to have been snapped up this week by Toulouse but is not even in the matchday squad. Henry Slade was outstanding off the bench against the All Blacks but is still \u2018riding the pine\u2019. Strength in depth is a positive, clearly, but only if the starters set the necessary early pace and tone. England barely scrape into the top 10 of try-scoring tier one teams this year and three late tries against a 14-man All Blacks side cannot mask the need for them to start faster. It used to be a speciality, with Manu Tuilagi\u2019s try in this corresponding fixture a year ago a good example. England, having taken a 14-3 lead, ultimately edged home 27-26 thanks to a late penalty from Marcus Smith but it helped once again that the Springbok captain Siya Kolisi was sin-binned in the final quarter. Discipline will be similarly crucial this time: English momentum was too often stifled against the All Blacks by the peep of the referee\u2019s whistle. Even with Rassie Erasmus banned from having any matchday involvement following his latest social media outpourings, the officiating is pretty certain to be pivotal again. Australia\u2019s Angus Gardner was also the referee in charge of this fixture in 2018 when England won 12-11 after Owen Farrell controversially escaped censure for an apparent no-arms tackle on Andr\u00e9 Esterhuizen. Gardner subsequently admitted he should have awarded a penalty and any hint of a repeat will cause South African conspiracy theorists to start howling at the moon again. It would be a much better look for the sport if the post-match message boards end up being full of praise for the extremely promising young Bok No 8 Evan Roos, the tireless Kolisi or the attacking vision of Willie le Roux. England, though, are mostly hard to beat at home at this time of year. This will be Jones\u2019s 21st and final autumn Test at Twickenham as head coach and his record currently reads P 20 W17 D1 L2. Both those two losses were by a single point. Given South Africa are without a few squad regulars with this game falling outside the international window, it feels as if it should be England\u2019s day if they are prepared to seize it. An epic win, at the end of a bruising week, would certainly go down well in the RFU committee box."

                    "body": "\u201cThis was the greatest day of my life!\u201d exclaimed my seven-year-old son. Our wh\u0101nau [family] had just returned to our whare [house] from Ng\u0101 Ana Wai (the water caves, the M\u0101ori name for Eden Park). We had witnessed the final of the Women\u2019s Rugby World Cup, where the Black Ferns had beaten the favourites and their arch-rivals, England. The rugby was pulsating, skilful, tough and uplifting. That evening felt like Aotearoa had won more than just the World Cup trophy; we were witnessing change. Apart from the magnificent game itself, this match and tournament were a huge milestone for seeing M\u0101ori culture and worldview deeply embedded in Aotearoa\u2019s national psyche and identity \u2013 not an add-on or token acknowledgment, but forming the very heart and forefront of our national game, the way we celebrate and who we are.  The atmosphere at the stadium felt different to other international rugby games I had been to in the past. There was genuine excitement in the air. Perhaps the crowd was feeding off the exuberance of the players and their zest for the game that they had shown all tournament.  I have to admit our small wh\u0101nau of four created a lot of noise in that 80 minutes. My son\u2019s comment stuck with me as I too had thought deeply about what we took on board on Saturday evening. At a chance meeting with my brother\u2019s wh\u0101nau before the game, my sister-in-law hurriedly said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to be late \u2013 I want to see P\u0101tea M\u0101ori Club\u201d. The renowned M\u0101ori kapa (group) with the 1987 smash hit Poi E were performing for the crowd during half-time of the bronze match. As we walked into the stadium, my nieces carried their poi with them. Poi, a small soft p\u014dro or ball at the end of a taura, or plaited rope, have become the symbol of this World Cup. \u201cW\u0101 poi \u2013 poi time \u2013 everyone!\u201d The ground announcer called, whipping the excited crowd into a frenzy. Where once supporters might have waved flags or blown horns, thousands of poi were twirled at great speed, creating a unified joy among the crowd. Unified at that moment by poi, unified by whanaungatanga [relationships] among the old, white, young, brown and everyone in between. A broadcaster at the stadium booms over the PA system, greeting everyone in te reo M\u0101ori (the M\u0101ori language), and my boys smile at me. A group of fans were proudly running up and down the steps of the stand waving Tino Rangatiratanga [M\u0101ori sovereignty flags], exuding mana [pride], unashamedly M\u0101ori. As the teams run out on to the field, 42,000 fans go into overdrive. It\u2019s fever pitch. The teams line up and Dame Hinewehi Mohi makes me cry. Hearing our reo M\u0101ori anthem being sung in this moment has a surreal effect. As her pitch perfect notes swim around the stadium, waves of emotions move around like the swell of a west coast surf beach. Earlier in the day I had been at a w\u0101nanga [meeting where ideas are shared] at my boy\u2019s kura [school]. I was wrestling with how much or little of the M\u0101ori worldview I am instilling in them as they grow up, especially in an urban setting. As our kids grow I want to be able to point to examples of our culture, our language and our people so they see themselves reflected. I wondered: would a rugby game offer anything? Sitting in the stands that afternoon, my wife pointed out Ruahei Demant, the Black Ferns co-captain, to our boys: \u201cI haere ia ki te kura kaupapa p\u0113r\u0101 i a k\u014drua,\u201d she said \u2013 she went to M\u0101ori language school like you two. Another couple of smiles. As the teams line up for the pre-game ritual of the haka, there is another wow moment. The wehi [awe] that the women\u2019s team displays is nothing short of electric. I catch the boys chiming in with \u201ct\u016bruki t\u016bruki! paneke paneke!\u201d at the end of the haka. We\u2019re ready for kick-off now, the main event. But, the lead-up to this point has shown me and our wh\u0101nau so much more. The value, the leadership, the future of Aotearoa maybe. A society that not only values its first people, but uplifts it and creates space for our culture to flourish. As the game closes, crowd favourite Ruby Tui is being interviewed on the big screen. \u201cI\u2019m so proud to be a New Zealander right now,\u201d she said, then started to sing. \u201cT\u016btira mai ng\u0101 iwi,\u201d she sang, launching into the te reo M\u0101ori song so many New Zealand children now learn in primary school. The crowd roared back the next line: t\u0101tou t\u0101tou e: all of us, all of us. Last Saturday showed glimpses of how the future could look. The next question for Aotearoa is how to capture that wairua \u2013 that spirit- and bring it into our everyday lives as a nation. Te ao M\u0101ori thinking and te reo M\u0101ori have seamlessly been interwoven in the psyche of us the supporters. Into the wairua or soul of us M\u0101ori present. It was indeed the greatest day of the young life of my son, a life he can now see his language and culture being a part of.

                    "body": "What a manic and heartbreaking evening for Mexico, who finally came alive at a vibrant Lusail Stadium and narrowly failed to pull off a Houdini escapology act into the last 16.\nEntering added time their higher yellow card count of seven to Poland\u2019s five had them knocked out and though Salem al-Dawsari scored, one more Mexico strike would have put them through.\nGerardo Martino\u2019s team had previously registered no goals at this World Cup yet 52 minutes in were 2-0 up and with the seconds ticking away had a last chance: Luis Ch\u00e1vez swept a free-kick into Saudi Arabia\u2019s area and C\u00e9sar Montes met it but no third goal followed and that was time up on Mexico\u2019s brave effort.\n\nBefore this Edson \u00c1lvarez had also crashed a shot towards Mohammed al-Owais\u2019s goal but it hit a Saudi back. A 20-yard dart by the lively Hirving Lozano claimed a free-kick on the edge of the area but Ch\u00e1vez belted it into the wall. Then Uriel Antuna found the Saudi net but this was ruled offside and Poland staggered through.\nThis almost certainly marks the end of Martino\u2019s four years in charge, which will not upset many fans who had lost faith in the Argentinian after an insipid qualifying campaign and the two previous matches here yielding only a point.\nThe Mexico coach said: \u201cI have no reason at the moment to think anything different \u2013 the contract expired with the final whistle and there is nothing else to do.\u201d\nThe hostility towards him was underlined by tough questioning from Mexican journalists who demanded to know why their country had failed to qualify for the last 16 for the first time since 1994.\n\u201cI am the man responsible for this frustration,\u201d Martino said. \u201cThis is a source of great sadness. I must say I assume all responsibility for this huge failure.\u201d\nAfter Mexico lost to Argentina, in the earlier group game \u00c1lvarez and Ch\u00e1vez said they did not understand Martino\u2019s approach. The manager was asked if this was when control was lost.\n\u201cIf we\u2019re talking about internal conflict due to this, then no,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Saudis, too, will rue their own case of what might have been as victory, to follow the memorable win over Argentina, would have given them a fourth match, at least, of Qatar 2022.\nHerv\u00e9 Renard was honest. \u201cWe won\u2019t get the violin out and start crying. We did not deserve to win with how we played,\u201d Saudi\u2019s coach said. \u201cWe dreamed before to go through but this evening we didn\u2019t fight enough. Mexico were much better. Next we first prepare the Asia Cup. It will be almost in one year\u2019s time, so we still have time to. Also to start the World Cup qualifiers. This is our next goal for the Saudi national team.\u201d\nThe catalogue of missed Mexico chances had begun with Alexis Vega racing on to a through-pass and only the frame of Owais stopping an opener. The save drew an ear-splitting cheer from the reported 60,00 Green Falcons fans inside and they soon sighed in collective relief.\nJes\u00fas Gallardo\u2019s cross caused a mix-up as Owais flapped and Henry Mart\u00edn \u2013 who scored Mexico\u2019s first \u2013 went down when Hassan al-Tambakti challenged him.\n\nIf Michael Oliver was not interested in a penalty, Mexico were bombarding those in white, so raucous cries greeted any offering of positive Saudi play. A next threat came from a diving Orbel\u00edn Pineda header \u2013 he seemed to have slipped the ball beyond Owais but this proved an illusion and Saudi Arabia escaped.\nThe pertinent question was how long they could keep doing so. Via Lozano on the right or Gallardo on the left El Tri were in constant ready-to-receive mode from H\u00e9ctor Moreno or Ch\u00e1vez and the Saudis\u2019 only answer was to scramble or spoil \u2013 Saleh al-Shehri and Ali al-Hassan each having their name written in Oliver\u2019s book for fouls.\nThe possession percentage share of 70-30 at half-time in Mexico\u2019s favour illustrated near-total dominance but a Firas al-Buraikan dash that sprung their defence, followed by a flying Hassan header, reminded them to remain watchful.\nA Ch\u00e1vez curving attempt beaten away by Owais at the start of the second half, though, suggested no let-up and at last Mexico struck. Their first goal of these championships was simple: Ch\u00e1vez directed a corner in from the left, Montes flicked on and Mart\u00edn finished.\nWith Argentina beating Poland in the other game, goal difference was still stacked against Mexico progressing. But Ch\u00e1vez thumbed a nose at the odds by sweeping home the sweetest free-kick from 30 yards that beat Owais to his left, the ball always bending away.\nThis had the Mexico replacements joining the celebrations and drew their team closer to the seemingly impossible. In a madcap passage Lozano scored what would have been their third and the one that would have taken them above Poland on goals scored but offside ruled it out. When Argentina went 2-0 up against Poland this meant the Mexicans and Poles were tied on all criteria but fair play put the Europeans through.\nMexico continued to pepper Saudi Arabia but could not get over the line and claim a memorable margin of victory."

                    "body": "Good morning. After four years of negotiations, and 12 years since the last biodiversity targets were agreed in Japan, governments appeared to have signed a once-in-a-decade deal to halt the destruction of Earth\u2019s ecosystems at the UN biodiversity summit in Canada. The potentially transformational agreement for nature could bring better protection for the planet\u2019s vital ecosystems such as the Amazon and Congo basin rainforests, big reforms to agriculture, and better protection of indigenous territories and rights. But there were concerns that key issues had been overlooked and that objections from some African states were ignored. Talks went into the night on Sunday in Montreal until finally nearly 200 countries \u2013 but not the US or the Vatican \u2013 signed an agreement to put humanity on a path to living in harmony with nature by the middle of the century. Negotiators from Cameroon, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo expressed incredulity that the agreement had been put through. The DRC said it had formally objected to the agreement, but a UN lawyer said it had not. The negotiator from Cameroon called it \u201ca fraud\u201d, while Uganda said there had been a \u201ccoup d\u2019\u00e9tat\u201d against the Cop15.  What does the deal include? It includes targets to protect 30% of the planet for nature by the end of the decade, reform $500bn (\u00a3410bn) of environmentally damaging subsidies, and restore 30% of the planet\u2019s degraded terrestrial, inland water, coastal and marine ecosystems. Here are some more details.  Argentina beat France on penalties to win World Cup after stunning final  It was a consecration, the spiritual overtones entirely appropriate. Lionel Messi not only led the nation to World Cup glory; he finally plugged the burning gap on his CV, winning the one title that has eluded him \u2013 at the fifth time of asking, surely the last time. In the process he gilded his claim to being recognised as the greatest player of them all. Argentina had to win this final three times, France refusing to accept it was Messi\u2019s destiny to get his hands on the iconic gold trophy, that it was somehow preordained. It will go down as surely the finest World Cup final of all time, the most pulsating, one of the greatest games in history because of how Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 hauled France up off the canvas towards the end of normal time. After an electrifying extra time in which Messi and Mbapp\u00e9 scored, the match went to penalties, and when Gonzalo Montiel scored the winning one, Messi sank to his knees in the centre circle, engulfed by teammates. Argentina\u2019s third World Cup triumph will go down as Messi\u2019s World Cup, just as the second in 1986 belonged to Maradona. Both men came to transcend their teams and the tournaments, with Messi collecting the Golden Ball in Qatar as the competition\u2019s star player. It has long felt as if he has had a celestial scriptwriter at work, guiding him to his destiny. The image of him and the trophy was what so many fans \u2013 and not just those from Argentina \u2013 had craved.  How did fans react in Argentina? There was delight in Buenos Aires that Argentina will be bringing home football\u2019s most coveted trophy. After the game, fans flocked to the Obelisk in central Buenos Aires, the streets a carnivalesque cacophony of cheers, car horns, cumbia music and bullhorns.  Toronto area shooting: gunman kills five in residential unit  Five people were shot and killed in a residential unit in the Greater Toronto area before the gunman was killed by police, authorities said. Police were called to a residential building in Vaughan, north of Toronto, at about 7.20pm on Sunday to reports of an active male shooter who had shot several people at a condo in the Ontario city. Mass shootings are rare in Canada, and Toronto has long prided itself as being one of the safest big cities in the world. \u201cWhen police arrived, an interaction occurred between the officers and a male subject and the subject was shot. He was pronounced deceased at the scene,\u201d York regional police said in a statement released late on Sunday. \u201cHorrendous scene,\u201d the York police chief James MacSween added. \u201cSix deceased. One of them is the subject. The other five are victims.\u201d  Who was the shooter? Police have not identified the suspect or named the deceased. MacSween said he didn\u2019t have details on whether the shooter was a resident of the building.

Stat of the day: TSA intercepted record number of guns at airports in 2022 and 88% were loaded  The Transportation Security Administration has intercepted a record number of guns at airport safety checkpoints this year, and an overwhelming majority of them were loaded. In a statement, TSA revealed that as of 16 December, its officers had intercepted 6,301 firearms. Out of those, 88% were loaded. The number marks an increase of more than 300 from the 5,972 firearms that were detected in 2021. About 86% of the firearms confiscated last year were loaded. The agency said it anticipated preventing a total of 6,600 firearms in carry-on bags from entering the secure area of airports by the end of 2022, a nearly 10% jump from last year\u2019s numbers. Don\u2019t miss this: Growing up in a different culture doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t love Christmas too  Growing up in a Muslim family in the 90s, Christmas was something I experienced at a remove, writes Yasmina Floyer. It quite simply was not for us as my family saw it as a religious celebration. I had no concept of Fomo when I was a child, but I felt it like a hot stone sitting in my stomach. Nobody needed to tell me that Santa wasn\u2019t real. I knew he wasn\u2019t because in spite of everything the movies wanted me to believe, being a good girl and wishing very hard did not result in a visit from the big guy. Now that I am an adult with a family of my own, everything has shifted. I am not the only one who can see that Christmas has become more of a secular event than a religious one. To me, Christmas means honouring the people dearest to you. Climate check: Connecticut makes climate change studies compulsory  Next July, Connecticut will become one of the first states in America to mandate climate change studies across its public schools as part of its science curriculum.

We need to arm them with the tools to be part of a solution to a problem they had no hand in creating,\u201d the Connecticut state representative Christine Palm told the Guardian.

Fans in bright bucket hats and red shirts wandered around the Welsh capital on Monday dazed but joyful at the prospect of their national side taking part in the World Cup for the first time in more than six decades \u2013 with many already hatching plans to get to Qatar in November. \u201cIt was fantastic,\u201d said Nicky Wilson, drinking coffee in a Yates bar proudly wearing a \u201cSpirit of 58\u201d T-shirt \u2013 a reference to the last time Wales qualified for football\u2019s biggest prize \u2013 as she prepared to drive her party back home to north Wales. \u201cThe anthem, the buildup, the game, the celebrations afterwards.

Annie Wilson has watched Wales play Mexico at the Rose Bowl stadium in Los Angeles but Sunday\u2019s 1-0 win against Ukraine at a rain-soaked Cardiff City stadium surpassed that. \u201cLast night was the best, no doubt.\u201d James Cameron, a transport worker also from north Wales, was to be found tackling a Guinness \u2013 a combination of hair of the dog and a determination to keep on partying for a few days yet. Like Welsh supporters of a certain vintage he has survived a lot of disappointment, his low point a 1-0 loss to Russia that meant his country did not qualify for Euro 2004. The best was the 3-1 win against Belgium at Euro 2016. \u201cBut getting through to the World Cup finals is something else,\u201d he said. While the mood in Cardiff was cheerful, it was also a time for reflection. Peter Hughes, a joiner, talked about how the edge between the large Welsh clubs that used to be felt on international match days had vanished. \u201cIt feels like a more united football community in Wales now,\u201d he said. A Welsh speaker, Hughes praised the Welsh FA for the way it has promoted the language, for example by identifying the team as \u201cCymru\u201d rather than Wales. After the final whistle the Welsh squad lined up to sing the ballad Yma o Hyd (Still Here) with the folk singer Dafydd Iwan.  Politics students Will and Deian, two of those mooching around the capital in bucket hats, said they loved the ethos of the team as well as their skill on the pitch. \u201cThe \u2018still here\u2019 sentiment is very important,\u201d said Will. \u201cEveryone is together and we always will be.\u201d Fans were also keen to pay tribute to Ukraine \u2013 the team and nation. Deian said there had been a lot of tears shed at the end of the match, not only for Wales\u2019s win but for Ukraine. \u201cIt was a surreal, poignant game,\u201d he said.  It had been a fine weekend for the suppliers of hats, shirts and flags in the shops opposite Cardiff Castle and people were still coming in for souvenirs on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a difficult couple of years,\u201d said Bob Rice at Castle Welsh Crafts. \u201cSo it\u2019s nice to see a bit of hustle and bustle. The win is good for the country and good for business.\u201d  The soundtrack for many was BBC Radio Wales. The presenter Jason Mohammad played David Bowie\u2019s Heroes and Manic Street Preachers\u2019 version of This Is The Day. \u201cWhat a day!\u201d he told the Guardian after his phone-in show. \u201cI\u2019ve been following Wales since 1982 and reporting on them for the BBC since 1997 so to be on air and broadcast the words \u2018Wales have qualified for the Fifa World Cup\u2019 was incredible. The thought of seeing so many red shirts in Qatar in 2022 is one that fills me with hwyl [a sense of fun, energy, enjoyment, passion], balchder [pride] and joy.\u201d At Andy\u2019s Hair Hut (suppliers of wigs and extensions) in Cardiff Market, Andy Smith and his son Jacob, 20, were discussing \u201cOperation How-To-Get-There\u201d. Andy has priced the trip at \u00a37,000 each. \u201cBut we\u2019re looking for cheaper alternatives,\u201d he said.  He has been researching whether it\u2019s possible to cross from a neighbouring country \u2013 or finding a berth in a cruise ship anchored off the coast. \u201cIt\u2019ll be worth it. It\u2019s about creating memories. Wales is like a bumblebee. The bee shouldn\u2019t be able to take off and we shouldn\u2019t be able to qualify for the World Cup. But it can and now we have. We\u2019re the bumblebees of football.\u201d"

                    "body": "Britain\u2019s economy returned to growth in October as activity bounced back from the impact of the additional bank holiday for the Queen\u2019s funeral, however a long recession is still expected. The Office for National Statistics said gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 0.5% on the month, after a decline of 0.6% in September when many businesses closed their doors during the national mourning period. Car sales rebounded after a poor month amid a wider recovery in the country\u2019s dominant service sector, while there was strong growth in activity in the health sector amid a rise in GP appointments, A&amp;E attendance and the Covid-19 autumn booster campaign.  Construction continued a strong run, driven up by housebuilding, while manufacturing output grew. However, GDP shrank by 0.3% in the three months to October, reflecting concerns over the strength of the economy as consumers and businesses tightened their belts amid the highest rates of inflation for 41 years. The Bank of England said last month the economy was probably already in a recession that could last until the end of 2023, after GDP fell by 0.2% in the three months to September. Despite a recovery in October, a return to contraction in November and December could spell a second consecutive quarter of decline \u2013 the technical definition of a recession.  Economists said the October figures did not alter the overall picture of a slowing economy. David Bharier, the head of research at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \u201cBusiness confidence has been falling dramatically as firms face into a wall of higher prices and energy bills, increased taxation, and rising borrowing costs. \u201cUnless the government helps create a stable environment to allow businesses to invest, the UK faces a long-term loss of competitiveness.\u201d With inflation above 11% during Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine driving up energy costs, the Bank of England is widely expected to further raise interest rates on Thursday for the ninth time in a row. However, the rate-setting monetary policy committee is expected to be split, with a minority of its nine members likely to push for a slower pace of rate increases amid the risk of a lengthy recession. Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said he expected the economy to shrink by up to 2% in total over the course of the recession. \u201cThe government looks set to pull back energy price support substantially next year, while higher interest rates will squeeze disposable incomes and spur households and businesses to pay off debt. \u201c[I] doubt that the economy will grow again until early 2024, resulting in a deeper and longer recession than we envisage for all other G7 economies.\u201d Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, said the figures showed Britain was lagging behind on the global stage. \u201cThese are challenging economic times but there is a choice. We can continue down the road of managed decline, falling behind our competitors, or we can draw on bold thinking to propel us forward,\u201d she said. Analysts said October\u2019s recovery in consumer spending was likely to be short lived, despite hopes among retailers and hospitality firms that the World Cup in Qatar could help drive up sales during the festive season. The latest snapshot showed output in consumer-facing services grew by 1.2% on the month, after a fall of 1.7% in September when many retailers temporarily closed for the Queen\u2019s funeral. Alongside a rise in car sales, the ONS said travel agencies and tour operators benefited from a stronger month, while output also grew for sports activities and amusements. Yael Selfin, the chief economist at KPMG UK, said: \u201cStretched household incomes could see sustained falls in consumer spending over the coming year, despite households tapping into their savings and increasing borrowing to help maintain their spending during the downturn.\u201d Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, said high inflation was slowing economic growth across the world, and the International Monetary Fund had forecast a third of the world economy will be in recession this year or next. \u201cWhile today\u2019s figures show some growth, I want to be honest that there is a tough road ahead. Like the rest of Europe, we are not immune from the aftershocks of Covid-19, Putin\u2019s war and high global gas prices,\u201d he said."

                    "body": "Brdo smells of spring. The air drifting down from the Slovenian Alps feels fresh and clean, the stillness interrupted only by birdsong and distant church bells. Dmytro Riznyk looks across at three immaculate pitches; directly behind him a small stand has been ingeniously embedded in a bright, grassy mound. Football environments rarely get more idyllic but, for those working here this week, the beauty is drowned out by a constant, silent scream. \u201cI\u2019ll only find peace again when I return to my country and there is no war there,\u201d says Riznyk, one of four goalkeepers in the initial phase of Ukraine\u2019s first training camp since it was invaded. \u201cWe are here and my heart is there. We believe in the people who are defending it and believe we will win. When that happens, the fear will go away.\u201d Still, Riznyk was ready when the time came to travel. He spent the first four days of the war at a maternity ward in Poltava, where he plays for Vorskla, with his wife and newborn son. It was the heaviest of wrenches to leave them, but on 30 April he joined the national team\u2019s staff on a 20-hour bus journey from Kyiv to their bucolic new base.  Most of his 22 colleagues are from Dynamo Kyiv and Shakhtar Donetsk; they have been playing charity matches abroad and could fly to Slovenia but Riznyk is a rarity. Other clubs more or less suspended operations so he has spent almost two months training alone, between trips to the bomb shelter and the haunting wail of sirens, in preparation for a crack at the World Cup. \u201cWe hope to honour our country, and also that we can bring joy to our people,\u201d he says. If Ukraine beat Scotland in next month\u2019s playoff semi-final they will face Wales; win both and a place in Qatar will be secured. In a tournament contested under a shadow, their presence would represent a beam of light. \u201cI\u2019m not putting pressure on them, it\u2019s very difficult,\u201d says the head coach, Oleksandr Petrakov. \u201cI never expected to work under such conditions.\u201d Petrakov is 64 and thought he had seen everything. In contrast to Riznyk he says a feeling of calm enveloped him as the bus crossed Ukraine\u2019s border with Hungary: there were no snaking, futile queues at petrol stations for dwindling supplies of fuel and he sensed \u201cthe kind of life I\u2019d maybe forgotten\u201d. Imbuing his players with some measure of serenity while conditioning them physically for two intense qualifiers from what is essentially a standing start will, he admits, be the toughest challenge of his career. \u201cI try to joke, to tell them some interesting stories from football and life, to raise their spirits,\u201d he says. Petrakov speaks with dry humour but an hour spent watching Ukraine train \u2013 in a gentle session shortly after their Dynamo contingent has arrived \u2013 confirms a tactility, a lightness, in his interactions. \u201cIt\u2019s important to distract them from bad thoughts but on the other hand we all know people are dying for Ukraine. They have to keep it in their minds and hearts, as the whole country is waiting for some happiness. We have to put it together for them.\u201d  Petrakov worries his players have not been able to go \u201cfull gas\u201d, as he puts it, in their friendlies and knows time to attain a competitive tempo is short. Their foreign-based players, including Oleksandr Zinchenko and Andriy Yarmolenko, should be closer to speed and will arrive later in May; Ukraine play a friendly against Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach on Wednesday but require a couple of more exacting tests before walking out at Hampden Park. The timing is difficult but they hope to face at least one African national team before the month ends. Any benefits of football might appear nebulous at best while the horror on the ground remains so real. So it is striking to hear the veteran midfielder Taras Stepanenko, talking in a pastel-white room overlooking the training complex, explaining the squad receive messages from soldiers on the frontline every day. \u201cThey make only one demand: \u2018Please do everything you can to go to the World Cup,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cFor the country, for them, it\u2019s a moment of hope and it will be like a celebration. That\u2019s why we have to play not only like a football game; we have to play with our souls, our hearts.\u201d Perhaps this, in fact, is sport at its purest: Russia has hardly concealed its intention to erase Ukrainian culture and a football team is one obvious representation of a country\u2019s heart, its craft, its creativity. Playing football on the highest stage is a show of defiance on one level but, on another, an act of preservation and perpetuation. That thought rears up again during a conversation with Serhiy Sydorchuk, the Dynamo midfielder who, at 31 and with 47 caps, is another senior figure in a youthful group. He sits on a terrace outside the team\u2019s hotel, yards from a reconstruction of a traditional local house on wooden stilts. Sydorchuk played in his club\u2019s charity games and there is a different image he cannot get out of his head. Before Dynamo played Legia Warsaw in the Polish capital last month, they visited a factory that had been repurposed to accommodate Ukrainian refugees. The players gave toys and sweets to children who had fled with their mothers or grandparents: one was a seven-year-old boy who had been drawing and, pulling up the photo gallery on his phone, Sydorchuk shows the image that was presented. The scene is heartbreaking: the boy\u2019s drawing, chillingly bright and vivid, depicted a burning set of houses with a Russian flag flying above them. \u201cIt\u2019s tough to see, very tough,\u201d Sydorchuk says. \u201cI hope in future he will live his life normally and have everything he wants. But I think a broken or scarred heart will remain.\u201d Qualifying for the World Cup might at least inspire happier means of self-expression. Given the freedom to travel, Ukraine\u2019s footballers are in a favourable situation \u2013 \u201cWhen you see people who lost everything, and you have something, it\u2019s a very shocking moment,\u201d Sydorchuk says \u2013 but the Dynamo and Shakhtar players have still known the practical consequences of Russia\u2019s violence. In the invasion\u2019s early days he and his family, including his then pregnant wife, spent two days and nights under blankets in the car park beneath their home. His international teammates Serhiy Kryvtsov, Andriy Pyatov and Mykola Matvienko joined them. The nearby airport at Zhuliany had been bombed and the reverberations made their apartment\u2019s window handles fall off. Others have suffered more severely but, as he scrolls through his archive again to show his children sleeping in an open car boot, the point is reinforced that everyone here carries their own trauma with them. \u201cThis isn\u2019t only a training camp,\u201d he says. \u201cEverything is different now. It\u2019s very heavy feeling.\u201d There is raw anger, too, beneath the professionalism and the methodical way Ukraine\u2019s travelling party describe their experiences. Petrakov expresses it strongest of all: perhaps he feels the most able to. He wants to see Russia punished more severely in a sporting sense, beyond their expulsion from the World Cup and the season-long ban from Europe for their club sides. \u201cThey should be banned five years, minimum,\u201d he says. \u201cThey have to pay for their support of Putin. They\u2019re killing our women, our children, destroying our cities, so they have no right to compete in sport. If we don\u2019t stop their aggression, they will come for other parts of Europe. It\u2019s not a peaceful nation so, in sport, they should pay for it.\u201d  Riznyk speaks about the help his Vorskla teammates, who are now back in group training, have been giving to hospitals and refugees as volunteers; Sydorchuk describes how his parents and in-laws in Zaporizhzhia, the first relatively safe destination for those who have managed to escape Mariupol, have been giving new arrivals food. The energy and love expended to keep all facets of a country alive defy comprehension. \u201cWe\u2019re all united in this,\u201d Sydorchuk says. \u201cIf you\u2019re a journalist, do your journalism work. If you\u2019re a football player, play football for your country. If you\u2019re a normal worker, you can work. Because we have a professional army, we have military volunteers who can fight. But everybody is together, and that\u2019s a very important thing.\u201d  The message is, in the worst of circumstances, simply to be the best you can. For the Ukrainians in Slovenia, whose training is conducted in front of hoardings advertising Lvivske beer and other products from home, that means carrying the torch all the way to Doha. \u201cWe need to win our games, but I\u2019m thinking about it,\u201d admits Ryznik, even if he faces a battle to make the final cut. As night falls and the midges outside offer a reminder that the time of year brings its minor inconveniences, Petrakov wonders whether the mission he never sought has become his destiny. \u201cI\u2019m at such an age where I don\u2019t want anything: no house, no car,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if I take the team to Qatar, I have lived my life for a reason.\u201d"

                    "body": "There are some big games of rugby this month but Saturday\u2019s World Cup final between the Black Ferns and England is right up there. Interest has skyrocketed to such an extent over the past 24 hours that a world record attendance is assured at Eden Park for a contest with the potential to launch women\u2019s rugby into another commercial stratosphere. Organisers say there has been huge demand for the last remaining seats, with thousands of New Zealanders clamouring to watch the defending world champions against the Red Roses in an intriguing clash of styles and outlooks. As a result the stadium will be full to its 40,000 capacity, beating the previous record of 34,235 for a women\u2019s fixture set at the same venue last month.  Those lucky enough to attend will be even more fortunate if the final yields half the entertainment generated by the semi-finals on Saturday, one of the greatest days in Women\u2019s Rugby World Cup history. Actually, let\u2019s rewind that sentence and erase the word \u201cwomen\u2019s\u201d. If ever there was definitive proof that female team sport can be more watchable than the male equivalent, this was it. Perhaps Thomas Ramos, scorer of 20 points in France\u2019s men\u2019s Test win over Australia, would have nailed the last-gasp penalty from virtually bang in front that poor Caroline Drouin dragged wide to allow the Black Ferns to advance to the final. Otherwise the two matches contained every element needed for momentous sporting drama, with the players and coaches of France, New Zealand, Canada and England collectively deserving significant credit.  From the perspective of a branch of the game still in commercially uncharted territory, it was also potential gold dust. England\u2019s captain Sarah Hunter launch an impassioned plea for further investment across the board after Canada\u2019s amateurs had threatened to pull off a remarkable underdog win against the professional Red Roses. \u201cI hope all the nations that don\u2019t invest as much as England say: \u2018That\u2019s where we need to go next because that\u2019s what the women\u2019s game globally needs,\u2019\u201d urged Hunter. \u201cHopefully this World Cup is the start of that.\u201d It is certainly hard to argue, for example, that New Zealand\u2019s Ruby Tui or England\u2019s Abby Dow are lesser crowd pleasers than, say, Sevu Reece or Damian Penaud. Having scored one of the second-half tries that edged the Black Ferns past France\u2019s mostly outstanding defence, it was also the charismatic Tui who best summed up the possibilities of this week\u2019s final from a marketing perspective. \u201cWomen\u2019s rugby is knocking on the door and I\u2019d say to everybody: \u2018You don\u2019t want to miss out on this,\u2019\u201d said the New Zealand winger, an Olympic sevens gold medallist in 2020. \u201cWhatever happens in the final I just hope people walk away going: \u2018Wow, I should have been watching women\u2019s rugby for a long time.\u2019 We know we have it in us and we know what we have to do. It\u2019s just a case of who\u2019s going to turn up. You can train the house down but it\u2019s the big pressure moments that matter.\u201d Those England squad members still scarred by defeat to the same opposition in the 2017 final can testify to that. Having led 17-10 at half-time in Belfast, the Red Roses went down 41-32 and the disappointment has niggled away at their head coach Simon Middleton ever since. \u201cIt\u2019s a desperate feeling and one you don\u2019t want to experience too many times,\u201d said Middleton. \u201cIt\u2019s a case of having something so close it\u2019s in your grasp and then it\u2019s gone. You also know how much of a difference it would make to the game and to the players if you succeed. This week is exactly the same.\u201d On paper England should be well prepared this time, having gone 30 Tests unbeaten and worked hard on their ability to defend a lead in the final quarter. The issue will be whether the hosts\u2019 sizzling runners can go one better than Canada, who caused England plenty of inconvenience. Kick poorly and leave defensive holes and Wayne Smith\u2019s New Zealand, even with minimal possession, will gleefully seize every opportunity. \u201cThe way the Black Ferns have turned round in the last year is phenomenal,\u201d acknowledged Middleton. \u201cThat shows the momentum they\u2019ve got. It\u2019s something we\u2019ll have to wrest away from them.\u201d Both Middleton and Hunter appear to be approaching the final furlongs of their Red Rose stewardship and would dearly love to deliver a tournament victory to boost the profile of the 2025 event, which is being held in England. \u201cIt would be immense,\u201d said Middleton. \u201cIt\u2019ll be an unbelievable tournament anyway \u2026 but winning here would accelerate it like the women winning the Euros has accelerated football. There are a lot of players starting to creak but it\u2019s about how you make sure your physical preparation is as good as it can be. Then it\u2019s about what you\u2019ve got inside. We\u2019ll see.\u201d"

                    "body": "Wasim Akram spent the best part of 20 years filleting batting lineups as the finest left-arm seamer of all time but it is only now, two decades on, that the former Pakistan captain feels comfortable discussing certain aspects of his life. The 56-year-old is about to release Sultan, a memoir written with the Australian journalist Gideon Haigh that does not simply chart a master finessing over 900 international wickets, World Cup glory in 1992, entering Lancashire folklore and a glitzy celebrity lifestyle. Darker times are explored, including match-fixing allegations, ball-tampering headlines, a previously undisclosed cocaine addiction and the heartbreaking death of his first wife, Huma.  \u201cIt was tough to revisit those moments in my life \u2013 the betrayal, the tragedies \u2013 but the reason for doing the book wasn\u2019t money,\u201d says Akram, pleasantries out of the way, from his home in Karachi. It is the day of Pakistan\u2019s shock defeat by Zimbabwe in the T20 World Cup group stages and a week before his former captain and mentor, Imran Khan, was shot on a protest march in Islamabad. \u201cI probably wanted to forget. I\u2019ve been diabetic for 25 years and didn\u2019t want the stress. But my sons are 25 and 21, my younger daughter is almost eight and it\u2019s my story for them. And my [second] wife, Shaniera. They all wanted to know what happened, my side of the story, because they have heard stuff about me. \u201cPeople may talk about Wasim Akram, one of the best left-armers, Pakistan and Lancashire etc, and that\u2019s how I\u2019m generally seen by you guys in the UK. But in Pakistan the rumours persist \u2013 \u2018he\u2019s a match-fixer\u2019 \u2013 and that hurts a lot.\u201d These rumours swirled around the Pakistan national team as a whole in the 1990s and were investigated at the end of the decade by Justice Malik Mohammad Qayyum. After a year-long inquiry Saleem Malik, the former captain, and Ata-ur-Rehman, a seamer, were slapped with life bans. Akram was among those under the microscope and, though ultimately cleared to play on, Qayyum noted how frequently his name came up during the evidence, concluding he was \u201cnot above board\u201d, issuing a fine and stating he should be observed closely.  The claims and counterclaims were myriad and against Akram was an allegation of trying to fix a one-day international against New Zealand in Christchurch in 1994, including offering Rehman \u201c3-4 lakh rupees\u201d (a lakh is 100,000) to bowl poorly; there was suspicion about his 11th-hour injury withdrawal from the 1996 World Cup quarter-final defeat by India in Bangalore; and more broadly it was said he would move himself up the batting order when captaining to manipulate play, regularly use a mobile phone in the dressing room and associated with bookmakers. The Christchurch allegation fell apart when Rehman changed his stance, claiming he was pressured into incriminating Akram about the approach, thus perjuring himself in the process. The validity of the mystery World Cup injury was supported by the team\u2019s physio, Dan Kiesel, while batting up the order was dismissed as a captain looking to take responsibility. Mobile phone use was met with a shrug and, as such, most of the mud did not stick. The one \u201cserious mistake\u201d Akram admits to here is of being slow to realise one of his oldest school friends, Zafar Iqbal (aka Jojo), was a gambler and bookie. In this regard he was not alone on what was a naive world stage at the time. The Qayyum inquiry came in parallel with Hansie Cronje\u2019s fall from grace and that of Mohammad Azharuddin in India, investigations that similarly lifted the rock on a sport beset by dubious hangers-on and scant anti-corruption provisions. Akram, one of eight Pakistan players fined, says he blocked out much of this period \u2013 \u201cIt was like a trauma\u201d \u2013 and did not read the Qayyum report until working on this book with Haigh. His conscience, he says, has always been clear. That being the case, the question is asked why players such as Rashid Latif and Aamir Sohail would drag his name into their wider claims of fixing (even if the latter, so bold in the press beforehand, clammed up during the hearing).  \u201cI think I was the only cricketer who wasn\u2019t friendly with these guys,\u201d Akram replies. \u201cAfter Imran Khan and Javed Miandad retired, there was no one left to control the dressing room. It was so self-destructive. Imagine me playing with people who did that to me? There was just so much distrust. The cricket board should have been stronger, with strong managers and coaches.\u201d Did he know or suspect games had been fixed when the allegations swirled? \u201cYou would hear things. I just used to ask: \u2018How is this possible? I don\u2019t believe it. Why would we do such a thing?\u2019 Everyone was panicky and playing for themselves. It was a horrible time; no one trusted each other.\u201d While deconstructing the claims and painting the picture of a viper\u2019s nest of a squad Akram stops short of slinging any mud in the opposite direction. Khan\u2019s nickname for Saleem Malik \u2013 \u201cthe Rat\u201d \u2013 is said to fit because he was \u201csneaky, untrustworthy and often unpleasant to deal with\u201d, while Rehman is \u201cnot the brightest crayon in the box\u201d. But otherwise there is no sense of revenge. Akram says he last saw Malik \u201cfive years ago\u201d when invited to his daughter\u2019s wedding but they were never close as players.  \u201cHe was a guy that you never trust. People change over time, though. I just don\u2019t know him now,\u201d he adds. \u201cI have moved on in life, my father taught me to forgive and forget. I don\u2019t burn bridges or seek revenge, life is very short.\u201d Another intriguing relationship is that with Waqar Younis. They were arguably fast bowling perfection as a duo, a remarkable left-right alliance that could transcend even the flattest pitches through reverse swing. Yet in the book, Akram revisits the first of his four spells as captain that ended in 1993 when nine players \u2013 including Waqar, then vice-captain \u2013 swore on the Quran never to play under him again, ushering in Malik\u2019s subsequently sullied tenure. It is an episode that sums up the fraught, political nature of a Pakistan squad forever bouncing from one series to the next in the kind of exhausting fashion that leads modern players to drop formats. \u201cIn all my terms of captaincy, virtually every deputy I had was concealing a dagger,\u201d writes Akram, which raises the question of how he and Waqar fared off the field. \u201cWe were OK,\u201d he replies. \u201cWe had good days, bad days, but we were like siblings, not jealous but competitive. But instead of waiting for their turn, [Pakistan vice-captains] have players around them \u2013 a gang \u2013 saying: \u2018It\u2019s your turn, you are the best captain.\u2019 Waqar was a kid who made mistakes. I made mistakes. As human beings, we all do.  \u201cWe have been working together recently, actually, commentating and doing a World Cup show. I told him I had written a book, there was nothing personal about anyone, it\u2019s just my side of the story and he said that\u2019s fine.\u201d There is little question about the highlight of Akram\u2019s career, the starring role in the 1992 World Cup final that he says \u201cchanged the mindset of cricket in Pakistan\u201d. He also became a firm favourite in English cricket over 10 years at Lancashire. Speaking at a time when the sport here is grappling with its continuing racism crisis, I ask if he ever experienced anything of the kind. \u201cNever,\u201d he replies. \u201cI was one of them and that\u2019s what I loved. I was 21, had never lived abroad and my accountant told me to get a house. The secretary of the club, Rose, she got me all the crockery. The boys would pop in if I needed anything and my captain, Jack Simmons, was very helpful, as were Athers [Mike Atherton] and Harvey [Neil Fairbrother]. I never felt anything like [racism] in Lancashire.\u201d As well as 370 wickets and more than 3,000 runs in the County Championship, Akram enjoyed his life off the field in Manchester and London. At first he drank milk at the bar after games before eventually getting a taste for alcohol and a good time. But after retiring in 2003 Akram struggled to strike the right balance, developing a cocaine addiction that filled the void of his absent sporting highs.  \u201cI didn\u2019t know what I was going to do in my future,\u201d he says. \u201cI got into the wrong company, I hurt my late wife very much in that period. With addiction you can\u2019t think about anything else. It was the worst time of my life.\u201d Despite a failed spell in a bleak Lahore rehab centre \u2013 the details of which are grimly recalled in the book \u2013 Akram eventually kicked the habit shortly before Huma, whose influence during his career is clear, died suddenly following complications from an undetected, rare infection called mucormycosis. \u201cThat tragedy changed everything,\u201d he says, with an understandably heavy sigh. Since then Akram has found contentment through his children\u2019s achievements and the love of Shaniera, the Australian he met in 2007. He will be a television pundit for England\u2019s forthcoming Test tour and before we wrap I ask how he thinks Bazball, the attacking brio brought in under Ben Stokes and the head coach, Brendon McCullum, will fare on the pitches of Rawalpindi, Multan and Karachi. \u201cI think England are favourites, because they can bowl reverse swing,\u201d comes the reply. \u201cJimmy Anderson is one of the best of all time at it. And I want them to bring that style of cricket to Pakistan. Although I\u2019m not sure our team could play like that \u2013 there would be headlines calling for Baz to be sacked within weeks!\u201d It is a cliche of sorts, the kind that tends to follow the frenzied world of Pakistani cricket. But after a life in the headlines himself, few are more qualified to make it than the Sultan of Swing. Sultan: A Memoir by Wasim Akram with Gideon Haigh (\u00a318.99, ISBN: 9781743798690) will be published by Hardie Grant on 10 November 2022"

                    "body": "A\u2019ja Wilson admitted she was tired. The WNBA MVP had just gotten to Australia less than 24 hours ago, fresh off a championship and the US were playing its toughest opponent of the World Cup. After a slow start, Wilson was clutch in the fourth quarter, finishing with 20 points to help the US beat China 77-63 on Saturday. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I\u2019m doing it,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cYou just put things aside ... It\u2019s like riding a bike. I am exhausted, I\u2019m not going to lie about it. At this point I don\u2019t even think about it. I\u2019m surrounded by greatness. I really lean on them. I don\u2019t even know which way is up. I see it\u2019s daylight and feel I need to go to sleep.\u201d The US now have won 25 consecutive World Cup games since losing in the 2006 semi-finals to Russia. The Americans advanced to the quarter-finals and are one win away from matching their record 26-game run from 1998-2006. The teams came into the game unbeaten in the tournament. The US (3-0) led 25-20 with 6:23 left in the first half before outscoring China 19-5 the rest of the second quarter, including the final 13 points. Alyssa Thomas and Breanna Stewart combined for seven of the 13 points during the game-changing burst.  Wilson closed the half with a putback that made it 44-25. She and Las Vegas teammates Chelsea Gray and Kelsey Plum were playing in their first game in Australia. The trio were in Las Vegas celebrating the franchise\u2019s first WNBA championship before arriving in Sydney. The US led 56-40 with 2:18 left in the third before China scored the final seven points of the period to get within nine. The Aces trio scored the first nine points of the fourth quarter to make it a 16-point game again. \u201cThey put me in the best position to score the basketball,\u201d Wilson said of her teammates finding her in the fourth quarter. However, China though go away. Trailing 67-51, Li Meng scored four points in a 9-0 burst to get her team to 69-60 with two minutes left. Wilson ended the drought with two free throws and a reverse layup to seal the win. Li finished with 21 points to lead China (2-1). China had cruised to wins in its first two games, routing both South Korea and Bosnia and Herzegovina by an average of 55 points. The Chinese team hadn\u2019t faced a defense like the US, which had been solid in its first two games. There was a big pro-Chinese crowd of roughly 9,400 fans for the game, including Hall of Famer Yao Ming, who is the chairman of the Chinese Basketball Association. He was shown on the video board and received a huge ovation from the crowd. \u201cThe China fan base, whether it was the local fan base here or they came from abroad, was just tremendous,\u201d US coach Cheryl Reeve said. \u201cTheir support made a fun environment. I heard some USA people. This is what you want.\u201d Plum went to the foul line at one point in the second half and the fans were booing her. She smirked at it and calmly sank both free throws. \u201cI heard the noise. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been booed in a long time,\u201d Plum said, laughing. \u201cI don\u2019t think Connecticut (fans) even booed me.\u201d Plum and Gray both said they got Wi-Fi on the long flight to Australia to study the US playbook. \u201cI kind of had a couple hours to look through it,\u201d Plum said. In other games Saturday, South Korea beat Bosnia and Herzegovina 99-66 and Belgium beat Puerto Rico 68-65. The US play South Korea on Monday."

                    "body": "Tite has confirmed that he will step down as Brazil coach after six years in charge. The 61-year-old had always maintained that he would leave after completing a full World Cup cycle, and so his reign will end with the 4-2 defeat on penalties to Croatia in the World Cup quarter-finals.\n\u201cThe cycle has ended, and I keep to my word,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are other great professionals that can replace me.\u201d But in a sober and largely emotionless press conference, Tite left with a defence of his team\u2019s record, not just against Croatia but in the tournament as a whole. \u201cWhen their goalkeeper is the best player on the field, the game is talking to you,\u201d he said in reference to Croatia\u2019s Dominik Livakovic. \u201cWe had to be more effective in making goals. But did Brazil show their best? Overall, yes.\n\n\u201cI understand that I am the most responsible, but we are all responsible for the loss. It\u2019s not about being a hero or a villain. There is no such thing in sports. Sometimes we have a great performance, we shoot at goal, and the ball deviates. That\u2019s normal. But I can respect the result.\u201d\n\nThe immediate reaction in Brazil was not so measured. The bitter disappointment of losing after being 1-0 up in the 117th minute soon morphed into criticism of Tite\u2019s tactics and his decision to disappear straight down the tunnel at full-time instead of commiserating with his players. One Brazilian television host called him a \u201cdonkey\u201d for assigning Neymar the fifth penalty, which was never taken.\n\u201cThe fifth penalty is the decisive one,\u201d Tite argued. \u201cThere is more pressure and players who are mentally prepared are best to take it.\u201d Tite\u2019s legacy is contested. He reinvented Brazil\u2019s style of play, took them to the top of the world rankings, and won the Copa America in 2019 before losing it on home soil in 2021. And in the biggest tournament of all, he has now suffered two quarter-final defeats. \u201cTime will answer that,\u201d he replied when asked how his tenure should be judged.\n\nThe Croatia coach Zlatko Dalic paid tribute to one of his country\u2019s \u201cgreatest wins\u201d after a miraculous comeback to reach their second straight World Cup semi-final. \u201cWe are a small country,\u201d he said. \u201cOur players are great fighters. Our honesty, hard work and professionalism reflects on us. People are surprised by our ability to do such a phenomenal thing. But we expected it.\u201d"

We have to look how far we\u2019ve come. Of course we wanted to get out of the group, but football\u2019s difficult. We didn\u2019t live up to our expectations at this tournament.\nIf you\u2019d told us two years ago that we would play in a World Cup, we\u2019d have all pinched ourselves. We\u2019ll all walk out of that changing-room with our held high and proud of each other. It\u2019s been difficult at this tournament, we haven\u2019t played very well. But we\u2019ve given everything and we won\u2019t have any regrets.\nI\u2019ll keep going as long as I can and as long as I\u2019m wanted. It\u2019s a difficult moment now but we go again.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 10.22pm GMT\n\n\n 9.27pm  \n\nWales 0-3 England\nThat\u2019s it for tonight\u2019s live blog. Commiserations to Wales and congratulations to England. Thanks for your company and emails \u2013 goodnight.\n\n\n\n\n\n 9.26pm  \nGareth Southgate\u2019s verdict\n\n\nIn the first half we controlled the game but we didn\u2019t create enough clear chances. We wanted a bit more thrust in the final third, to play forward a bit quicker. The second half, once we got the two goals, we knew that their spirit had probably gone. I thought we kept our discipline right until the end.\nIt\u2019s great for [Marcus Rashford]. He\u2019s trained really well, I have to say, and he could have had a hat-trick. His free-kick was an incredible strike; that\u2019s what he\u2019s capable of. In moments I thought both [Rashford and Foden] were a bit quiet in the first half. We decided to switch them at half-time and they responded really well, and for them to both get their goals was great.\nI\u2019ve played in front of England crowds like that. It\u2019s an amazing feeling when you see them in such numbers, especially when you think how far they\u2019ve had to travel. I thought we dealt with the pressure really well \u2013 we were calm and we showed our quality. \n\n\n\n\n 9.21pm  \n\nJude Bellingham speaks\n\nI\u2019m so happy for [Marcus Rashford] \u2013 what a performance. We\u2019ve got loads of depth in attacking areas, and whoever comes in seems to make an impact. It doesn\u2019t really change the style of them That\u2019s quite rare, if we\u2019re being honest. I\u2019m really happy for Phil tonight; he\u2019s had a lot of pressure on him the last few days with all the attention, but he showed again how good he is.\nWe weren\u2019t aggressive enough [against the US] but it was more high-energy today. It was important for us to be on the front foot. Hendo brings that intensity every time he plays. We won a lot of balls really high up the pitch which was key to us keeping the pressure on.\n\n\n\n\n 9.16pm  \n\nThe final Group B table\n\nEngland 7pts\nUSA 5\nIran 3\nWales 1\n\n\n\n\n 9.14pm  \n\nRob Page speaks\n\nIt\u2019s very tough to take at this moment in time. I thought in the first half we were outstanding \u2013 the effort we put in without the ball was exceptional. We could have kept the ball better but I won\u2019t have a bad word said about that group of players; they\u2019ve given everything today. The second goal disappoints me a little bit, but I don\u2019t want to talk about negatives today.\nFive minutes before half-time, Gareth felt his hamstring. Joe Allen and Ben Davies had to come off as well. It was a massive effort from all the group and I couldn\u2019t be more proud of them.\nMy message is: don\u2019t do disappointed. We\u2019ll build again for the future now, and to get to the World Cup is an unbelievable achievement for that group of players.\n\n\n\n\n 9.11pm  \n\nDan James\u2019 verdict\n\nWe knew it would be tough. I thought we defended well at times but they can score with anything. They scored a great free-kick, and then conceding the second goal straight away killed us a little bit. We\u2019re super-gutted.\nWe\u2019re proud to be here and we\u2019ll concentrate on trying to qualify for the next Euros. I just wanna say thanks to the fans \u2013 they\u2019ve been unbelievable.\n\n\n\n\n 9.09pm  \nFull: Iran 0-1 USA\n\nThe USA will play the Netherlands in the last 16 after a frantic victory over Iran. Christian Pulisic scored the only goal, injuring himself in the process, and the US held out relatively comfortably.\n\n\n\n 9.08pm  \nMarcus Rashford's verdict\n\n\nIt\u2019s a great feeling. We were a bit disappointed after the USA game, and the only way to bounce back is to have a good performance in your next game; I thought we did it. It was just about taking the chances when they came. \nI fancied a free-kick in the first half, but the one in the second half was in a better position. From there it\u2019s about being calm and executing what you do in training. They don\u2019t go in often but I was glad it did today.\nAt half-time the manager said we\u2019d played really but that we could work the keeper more. In the second half we did that.\nMoments like this, this is what I pplay football for. I\u2019m really happy that we\u2019re going through and I hope we can build on this performance. I have massive ambition for this team and I think we play even better.\n\n\n\n\n 9.00pm  \n\n\"Well done England,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cThe best side won. But, I\u2019ve seen Wales play at the World Cup. That\u2019s huge. There will always be a sadness over how the side have performed, but they were there. They played at the World Cup. Gareth Bale has scored a World Cup goal.\n\"In years to come, I won\u2019t think about the one point or the fourth place. I\u2019ll remember watching Wales play at the World Cup. Diolch, bois. Mae wedi bod yn anhygoel. Pasio y Penderyn i mi.\u201d\nIt\u2019ll make a great book one day\n\n\n\n 8.56pm  \n\nThere are nine minutes of added time in the match between Iran and the USA. Get yourself over there.\n\n\n\n\n 8.56pm  \nFull time: Wales 0-3 England\n\nPeep peep! England top the group after an ultimately comfortable victory over Wales. Marcus Rashford (2) and Phil Foden scored the goals, having been brought into the side tonight, and England will now play Senegal in the last 16 on Sunday evening.\nIt\u2019s a sad end to a golden age of Welsh football. They defended well in the first half but again struggled to keep the ball, and Gareth Bale went off injured at half-time. They\u2019ve done themselves proud \u2013 not necessarily tonight, but certainly over the past decade. This group of players have given millions of people some of the happiest moments of their lives.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 10.24pm GMT\n\n\n 8.55pm  \n\n90+4 min After an absurd slalom from Grealish, Foden has a close-range shot blocked.\n\n\n\n 8.53pm  \n\n90+1 min John Stones misses an absolute sitter, half-volleying into orbit from six yards after Maguire had headed a corner back across goal.\n\n\n\n 8.52pm  \n\n90+1 min Four minutes of added time.\n\n\n\n 8.51pm  \n\n90 min Probably fair to assume James Maddison won\u2019t be getting on the field at this World Cup.\n\n\n\n 8.51pm  \n\n90 min So anyway: England v Senegal on Sunday evening and, as things stand, the Netherlands v the USA on Saturday afternoon. That\u2019ll be the first game of the knockout stage.\n\n\n\n 8.50pm  \n\n89 min \u201cHas it been a \u2018desperately disappointing World Cup\u2019 for Wales?\u201d says Vic Rushton. \u201cThey held a good USA team, lost in injury time v a superior Iran and, were it not for the set piece, were successfully frustrating England. As the Pompey fan pointed out, what could you realistically expect with the players they have available?\u201d\nI think it has, though maybe some of us expected too much based on previous achievement. It\u2019s the meekness of the performances, rather than the results, that has been the really disappointing thing.\n\n\n\n 8.48pm  \n\n87 min A brilliant crossfield pass from Idon\u2019tknow is chested down by Moore on the edge of the area, but Stones holds him up well and Moore eventually shoots miles wide.\n\n\n\n 8.45pm  \n\n84 min A loose ball falls nicely for Colwill, 22 yards out, but his snapshot goes high over the bar.\n\n\n\n 8.44pm  \n\n84 min Wilson\u2019s free-kick hits the wall.\n\n\n\n 8.44pm  \n\n83 min Moore is fouled by Maguire, 25 yards from goal. The angle would be perfect for Bale, but in his absence it\u2019ll be Harry Wilson to take it\u2026\n\n\n\n 8.43pm  \n\n82 min Gianni Infantino\u2019s self-satisfied coupon appears on the big screen, prompting a chorus of boos.\n\n\n\n 8.43pm  \n\n82 min \u201cThe problem England have now is that they\u2019ve far too many players who play as a sort of inside left,\u201d says Andy Flintoff. \u201cThere\u2019s Mount, Grealish, Foden and Rashford. After a period where we didn\u2019t have any, we now have loads. Where precisely have they come from? Was there some sort of secret inside-left factory set up in the early 2000s, when there weren\u2019t many, and it\u2019s only just bearing fruit?\u201d\n\n\n\n 8.42pm  \n\n81 min: Wales substitution Joe Allen is replaced by Rubin Colwill.\n\n\n\n 8.41pm  \n\n81 min There\u2019s a break in play while Joe Allen receives treatment. I think he may have suffered a recurrence of the hamstring injury that kept him out at the start of the tournament.\n\n\n\n 8.40pm  \n\n79 min Good luck picking a team for the match against Senegal. I suspect Gareth Southgate will go back to Sterling and Saka, but Henderson might stay in midfield ahead of Mount.\n\n\n\n 8.39pm  \n\n77 min: Good save from Ward! Callum Wilson \u2013 who really is deputising for Harry Kane by becoming England\u2019s creator in chief \u2013 puts Bellingham through on goal. He slides a low shot across goal that is saved smartly to his left by Ward, and Bellingham\u2019s follow-up just evades Foden.\n\n\n\n 8.38pm  \n\n77 min: Wales substitution Harry Wilson replaces Dan James.\n\n\n\n 8.38pm  \n\n75 min: England substitution Jack Grealish replaces Marcus Rashford, who gets the warmest of ovations from the crowd and a lovely embrace from Gareth Southgate. His comeback \u2013 before this tournament his last kick for England was that penalty against Italy \u2013 is becoming one of the feelgood stories of the World Cup.\n\n\n\n 8.36pm  \n\n75 min This is the first time England have scored nine goals in the group stage of a major tournament. Southgate out!\n\n\n\n 8.34pm  \n\n73 min An enterprising run from Brennan Johnson ends with a cross-shot that is blocked by Trippier.\n\n\n\n 8.33pm  \n\n72 min Almost a hat-trick for Rashford! Wilson ran at a backpedalling defence and again showed his selfless side by flicking it outside to Rashford. His low, sidefooted shot was kicked round the near post by Ward.\n\n\n\n 8.32pm  \n\n71 min It\u2019s been a desperately disappointing World Cup for Wales. But we shouldn\u2019t forget that this is part of a much bigger story, one that involves Euro 2016, Euro 2020 and, of course, Gary Speed. And while it was a tournament too far for Bale and Ramsey, they have been responsible for some of the most euphoric moments in Welsh football history. A crap fortnight in Qatar doesn\u2019t change that.\n\nUpdated at 8.32pm GMT\n\n\n 8.31pm  \n\n70 min Since Clueless Gareth switched his wingers at half-time, they\u2019ve scored three goals.\n\n\n\n 8.30pm  \n\nThat\u2019s England\u2019s 100th World Cup goal. Phillips arrowed a sweet pass down the right wing to release Rashford. He moved into the area, cut inside Roberts and belted a left-footed shot that went through the legs of the unsighted Ward.\n\n\nUpdated at 9.18pm GMT\n\n\n 8.29pm  \nGOAL! Wales 0-3 England (Rashford 68)\n\nMarcus Rashford is having a night out.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.34pm GMT\n\n\n 8.27pm  \n\n66 min \u201cJoe Morrell plays for Portsmouth,\u201d says Paulo Biriani. \u201cPortsmouth. That\u2019s what Rob Page has at his disposal. And I\u2019m a Pompey fan.\u201d \n\n\n\n 8.26pm  \n\n65 min Another change for England: Kieran Trippier replaces Luke Shaw.\n\n\n\n 8.26pm  \n\n64 min And while we\u2019re doing videos, here are the England goals.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 8.27pm GMT\n\n\n 8.24pm  \n\n63 min \u201cLiking those subs Rob,\u201d says Sean Boiling. \u201cYou must love seeing Wilson Phillips come on.\u201d\nArf, very good.\n\n\n\n\n 8.22pm  \n\n61 min Aaron Ramsey is booked for a poor tackle on Henderson, who yelped with pain at the point of contact. Ramsey did apologise straight away but it was a bad challenge, studs into the ankle.\n\nUpdated at 8.23pm GMT\n\n\n 8.21pm  \n\n59 min Another injury for Wales: Ben Davies, who has quietly been one of their better players in this tournament is replaced by Joe Morrell. \n\n\n\n 8.20pm  \n\n59 min \u201cI thought it was Allardyce\u2019s Bolton who parked the bus,\u201d says Niall Mullen. \u201cBut you\u2019re right, we all become the things we fear that we secretly are. I, for example, am a middle-aged man doing the equivalent of writing in green ink to the newspaper letters page.\u201d\nWhen Mourinho was in his imperial phase, I think he accused pretty much all of them of parking the bus. But I\u2019m sure Spurs were the first.\n\n\n\n 8.19pm  \n\n58 min: Triple substitution for England Trent Alexander-Arnold, Callum Wilson and Kalvin Phillips replace Harry Kane, Declan Rice and Kyle Walker. That went really well for Walker, who didn\u2019t look remotely rusty.\n\n\n\n 8.18pm  \n\n57 min As things stand, England will play Senegal on Sunday evening (English time), and the Netherlands will play the USA on Saturday afternoon.\n\nUpdated at 8.18pm GMT\n\n\n 8.17pm  \n\n56 min All of a sudden, Wales are going for it. Moore\u2019s long-range shot deflects off the abundant noggin of Maguire, and Pickford does well to change direction and push it behind for a corner.\n\n\n\n 8.16pm  \n\n55 min James cuts inside Walker on the left edge of the area and curls a very dangerous cross-shot that flashes just wide of the far post. Pickford dived for it but didn\u2019t get a touch.\n\n\n\n 8.15pm  \n\n53 min That, as Roger Kirkby informed us earlier, is England\u2019s 99th World Cup goal. \n\n\n\n 8.14pm  \n\nRashford played a big part in the goal, robbing Ben Davies just outside the Wales area. Kane collected the loose ball and drove a devastating ball across the six-yard line. None of the Wales defenders could get to it, and Foden arrived beyond the far post to ram it gleefully past Danny Ward.\n\n\nUpdated at 9.19pm GMT\n\n\n 8.12pm  \nGOAL! Wales 0-2 England (Foden 51)\n\nTwo in two minutes for England!\n\n\nUpdated at 9.19pm GMT\n\n\n 8.12pm  \n\n51 min Having seen it again, I think Danny Ward is slightly at fault. He assumed Rashford would go to the near side and started to place his weight on his right foot, or rather his wrong foot. The free-kick from Rashford was very good but it wasn\u2019t right in the corner.\n\nUpdated at 8.14pm GMT\n\n\n 8.12pm  \n\nMarcus Rashford gives England the lead with a glorious free-kick. It was just outside the area, to the left of centre, and he simply flashed a curling shot into the far corner.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.23pm GMT\n\n\n 8.11pm  \nGOAL! Wales 0-1 England (Rashford 50)\n\nPick that out.\n\n\nUpdated at 9.20pm GMT\n\n\n 8.10pm  \n\n48 min Foden and Rashford have switched wings. Foden goes on a brilliant run infield from the left, swerving past three players before being fouled by Mepham. This is a chance for England, a free-kick 22 yards from goal\u2026\n\n\nUpdated at 8.19pm GMT\n\n\n 8.09pm  \n\n48 min If it stays like this, Gareth Southgate has plenty of decent options on the bench. England need a lock-picker tonight, so I\u2019d be looking at James Maddison (if he\u2019s fit), Trent Alexander-Arnold and maybe Jack Grealish.\n\n\n\n 8.07pm  \n\n47 min \u201cRe: \u2018sterile domination\u2019,\u201d begins Edward Chukwurah. \u201cPerhaps the difference lies in Wenger coining that phrase while assessing his own team after a match, while Mourinho was accusing the opposition of \u2018parking the bus\u2019.\u201d\nI thought Wenger used it to describe Barcelona in the first half of Arsenal\u2019s game at the Nou Camp in 2010-11. Would have to check though. Mourinho certainly first used it to criticise Spurs in his first season at Chelsea.\n\nUpdated at 8.07pm GMT\n\n\n 8.06pm  \n\n46 min Peep peep!\n\n\n\n 8.06pm  \nHalf-time substitution: Brennan Johnson for Gareth Bale\n\nAch, that\u2019s a really sad way for Bale\u2019s tournament \u2013 maybe even his career - to end. He must be injured, although in truth he barely had a kick in the first half.\n\nUpdated at 8.07pm GMT\n\n\n 8.01pm  \n\n\u201cAnd breathe,\u201d says Matt Dony, gulping dementedly at the nearest bit of oxygen. \u201cWales have defended brilliantly, and they\u2019ve had to. There\u2019s been commitment, strength, and excellent game-reading. And there\u2019s been a healthy touch of luck. That\u2019s not sustainable for the whole 90 minutes. Now\u2019s the time to go for it. Big 45 minutes. No need to panic and throw everything forward from the re-start, but certainly time to be braver and more enterprising.\n\u201cThe other game is out of our hands. Doesn\u2019t really matter. Just look for a positive result here. Absolutely heartbroken for Neco. He\u2019s not had the greatest time, but I love seeing him in the pitch. Potentially the next Welsh star player. I really, really hope that he has a chance to show his ability at other tournaments.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 8.05pm GMT\n\n\n 7.55pm  \n\n\u201cCan\u2019t help thinking there\u2019s a bit of mid-era Wenger about this England performance,\u201d says Tom Atkins. \u201cSome nice patterns around the box, a lot of sterile possession, but nothing really to frighten the horses.\u201d\nIt\u2019s odd that it was Wenger who coined the phrase \u201csterile domination\u201d. Then again, Jose Mourinho did the same with \u201cpark the bus\u201d. Self-loathing can manifest in some weird and wonderful ways.\n\nUpdated at 8.00pm GMT\n\n\n 7.53pm  \nHalf time: Wales 0-0 England\n\nPeep peep! Another scoreless half for England, though as things stand they are top of the group. They dominated possession but created only a couple of really good chances for Marcus Rashford and Phil Foden. Wales defended well, though Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey were again anonymous. They need a two-goal swing \u2013 one for them, one for Iran.\n\nUpdated at 7.54pm GMT\n\n\n 7.51pm  \n\n45+5 min A nice training-ground throw-in for Wales. Roberts shaped up for the long one, then threw it flat to the unmarked Mepham. He fed it into Allen, who took a touch and thrashed over the bar from the edge of the area. A decent effort, though I doubt Pickford\u2019s heart rate hit the roof.\n\n\n\n 7.51pm  \n\n45+5 min Roberts and Rashford briefly exchange unpleasantries, and why not. There was nothing much in it.\n\n\n\n 7.50pm  \n\n45+5 min \u201cTrying to catch updates from an airport shuttle bus on Tenerife,\u201d says Ellie Baskerville. \u201cI seem to be the last drop-off in Puerto de la Cruz. Nobody score until I get to a TV.\u201d\nSo long as you arrive before March 2027, you should be okay.\n\n\n\n 7.50pm  \n\n45+4 min Foden swings a very deep corner towards Stones, who loops a header back towards goal. Ward backpedals smartly to make a comfortable save under the bar.\n\n\n\n 7.49pm  \n\n45+3 min Maguire steals the ball high up the field and gives it to Kane. His low shot hits Maguire, busying himself in the area, and goes behind for \u2026 a corner. I suppose that evens out the one in the 18th minute.\n\n\n\n 7.48pm  \n\n45+4 min Brennan Johnson is apparently getting ready to come on for Wales, which is bad news for somebody\u2019s soft tissues.\n\n\n\n 7.47pm  \n\n45+2 min \u201cMy wifi connection just cut out so this is a great time for my mates to wind me up with fake goal celebrations - and they are - they tell me we are 2-1 down,\u201d says Omar Madha. \u201cAm guessing \u2026not true? (Am hoping you are all more reliable\u2026?)\u201d\nAre you telling me you missed Connor Roberts\u2019 fifth goal.\n\n\n\n 7.47pm  \n\n45+5 min Five minutes of added Neco time.\n\n\n\n 7.46pm  \n\n45 min Bellingham is starting to trouble Wales with his direct running. After another surge he cuts the ball back nicely to the edge of the area, where Henderson (I think) has a shot blocked.\n\n\n\n 7.45pm  \n\n44 min Has Gareth Southgate taken negative hashtags as far as he can?\n\n\n\n\n 7.43pm  \n\n43 min There\u2019s been a goal in the other game in this group. Here\u2019s your clickbait.\n\n\n\n\n 7.42pm  \n\n40 min Fine defending from Roberts! England broke menacingly, four on three, after Foden elegantly took a Wales defender out of the game and found Kane. He gave it to Rashford, whose slightly indecisive cross was put behind by Roberts.\n\nUpdated at 7.42pm GMT\n\n\n 7.41pm  \n\n39 min Henderson\u2019s cross takes a deflection and loops invitingly towards Rashford, who tries a spectacular overhead kick and shins it well wide. Worth a try.\n\n\nUpdated at 7.50pm GMT\n\n\n 7.40pm  \n\n39 min Less talk more embeddable videos please lads.\n\n\n\n\n 7.39pm  \n\n38 min: Chance for Foden! That was lovely play from England. Bellingham and Walker (I think) exchanged jaunty flicks on the edge of the area; then Bellingham produced another to find Foden. He turned smoothly and spanked a rising drive just wide. It was a decent chance.\n\nUpdated at 7.43pm GMT\n\n\n 7.37pm  \n\n36 min Neco Williams, who has been through plenty in this tournament and looks pretty dejected, is coming off. He\u2019s replaced by Connor Roberts.\n\n\nUpdated at 7.39pm GMT\n\n\n 7.36pm  \n\n34 min Neco Williams is down again. He\u2019s still struggling after wearing Rashford\u2019s shot earlier in the game, which again makes you wonder what\u2019s going on with the concussion protocols at this tournament. Under the current system, even Basil Fawlty would have been discharged.\n\nUpdated at 7.38pm GMT\n\n\n 7.34pm  \n\n34 min A decent cross from Walker is headed away decisively by Mepham. \n\n\n\n 7.34pm  \n\n33 min Wales haven\u2019t had a shot, they\u2019ve barely had a kick \u2013 and it\u2019s going pretty well for them. All that matters is that they are still in the game going into the last quarter, when strange things are much more likely to happen.\n\n\n\n 7.33pm  \n\n32 min Maguire surges through the inside-left channel, all the way into the area, and then belabours the ball out for a throw-in on the far side. That was\u2026 unusual.\n\n\n\n 7.32pm  \n\n31 min The England fans are chanting \u201cyou\u2019re going home in the morning\u201d, which will make for a helluva schadenfreude sandwich if Wales win 7-0.\n\n\n\n 7.32pm  \n\n31 min Possessionwatch: Wales 24-76 England. \n\n\n\n 7.30pm  \n\n29 min Dan James is booked for a late tackle on John Stones.\n\n\n\n 7.30pm  \n\n29 min Ramsey picks Kane\u2019s pocket just past the halfway line. Williams breaks but is then taken out by Henderson.\n\n\n\n 7.29pm  \n\n28 min I\u2019m not sure what to make of this England performance. They\u2019ve passed it pretty well, with a swagger at times, but they\u2019ve only created that one chance for Rashford. \n\n\n\n 7.28pm  \n\n27 min \u201cI was born in England (London) and lived there 18 years,\u201d writes Meher Rashid Shima. \u201cI then moved to Wales (Cardiff) three years ago. Not sure how to feel about the match. I\u2019d be happy either way, but I am secretly wishing England win!\u201d\nYour secret\u2019s safe with me and both our readers.\n\n\n\n 7.27pm  \n\n26 min Williams is fine, play resumes.\n\n\n\n 7.26pm  \n\n23 min A fierce long-range shot from Rashford flattens Neco Williams, who stooped to head it away just inside the area. There\u2019s a break in play while he has a concussion test, and a few boos as well. You can\u2019t ban those, sadly.\n\n\n\n 7.23pm  \n\n22 min Shaw curls a terrific cross towards Henderson, in all sorts of space beyond the far post, but the ball kicks up awkwardly and Henderson can\u2019t control it with his head. Moments later, Walker hammers a low cross that is kicked away in the six-yard box.\n\n\n\n 7.22pm  \n\n21 min Wales are defending perfectly well, but once again they are really struggling to keep the ball. I\u2019d be tempted to switch the wingers for a bit \u2013 try Bale\u2019s craft against Walker and James\u2019 pace against Shaw rather than the other way round.\n\n\n\n 7.22pm  \n\n20 min \u201cQuite boring so far from your account of proceedings, dear Rob,\u201d says Edward Davey.\nIt\u2019s the way I tell them.\n\n\nUpdated at 7.26pm GMT\n\n\n 7.20pm  \n\n18 min That was a mildly pathetic free-kick from England. They spent an age whispering to each other, obviously telegraphing that something funky was coming up. In the end all they did was have two players touch it off for Shaw to float beyond the far post, where Maguire headed the ball off Ampadu and behind for a corner.\nWell, it should have been a corner, but the referee gave a goalkick.\n\n\n\n 7.19pm  \n\n17 min Mepham shoves Kane over 25 yards from goal, a needless foul to give away. The free-kick is a fair way to the left of centre, and England have four players round the ball\u2026\n\n\n\n 7.18pm  \n\n16 min Bale and Ramsey are playing different roles tonight \u2013 Bale wide right, Ramsey as the No10 \u2013 but so far they have been as quiet as they were against Iran. I still think there\u2019s an argument for using Bale as a substitute. Fight tooth and nail to keep it at 0-0, then bring him on for the last 20-30 minutes.\n\n\n\n 7.16pm  \n\n15 min Shaw\u2019s free-kick is headed away to Foden, 25 yards out. He shoots well wide.\n\n\n\n 7.14pm  \n\n13 min That chance aside, it\u2019s been a cagey start to the game. England are having most of the ball, but their tempo is on the slow side. \n\n\n\n 7.11pm  \n\n10 min: Excellent save by Ward! The first chance goes to England. Kane put Rashford through on goal with a lovely pass, perfectly in sync with Rashford\u2019s off-the-ball run, but Ward charged a long way from his line to narrow the angle and block Rashford\u2019s shot.\n\n\nUpdated at 7.16pm GMT\n\n\n 7.10pm  \n\n9 min Ampadu sprays a crossfield pass towards James, but it\u2019s too heavy and goes out of play. \n\n\n\n 7.09pm  \n\n8 min \u201cAre the final games of the group being played at the same time to keep the games competitive to the last?\u201d asks Andrew Benton. \u201cOr is it just for the TV schedules?\u201d\nIt\u2019s because of the Disgrace of Gijon, pretty much.\n\n\n\n\n 7.08pm  \n\n7 min Loads of early possession for England, though you can file it under sterile domination. Wales won\u2019t mind this; they\u2019ll be thrilled if it\u2019s 0-0 after 70 minutes.\n\n\nUpdated at 7.19pm GMT\n\n\n 7.06pm  \n\n5 min \u201cAs someone who\u2019s from a country with a small population, much smaller than Wales, my heart longs for their success, even as my head knows how long the odds are,\u201d writes K\u00e1ri Tulinius. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019m not alone in feeling this way. There\u2019s a small nation army behind Wales.\u201d\n\n\n\n 7.05pm  \n\n4 min The first burst from Rashford, who combines with Shaw before being well tackled in the area.\n\n\n\n 7.03pm  \n\n2 min Tacticswatch: Aaron Ramsey is playing further forward, as a No10. England\u2019s formation is as expected, with Bellingham playing as the left-sided central midfielder.\n\n\nUpdated at 7.06pm GMT\n\n\n 7.02pm  \n\n1 min \u201cHi, Rob,\u201d says Nicola Nanev. \u201cI am a Bulgarian, who used to live in UK and now lives in USA. I have been a life-long supporter of English football.\n\u201cI have been following your minute-by-minute reporting from an office in Manhattan, which was full earlier, but, by now, has mostly cleared as if there is a big game coming up, to which the locals will turn their attention.\n\u201cI am one of the few that will stay behind and support England. There is no point going to the pub as they will be showing the OTHER game!\u201d\n\n\n\n 7.01pm  \n\n1 min Peep peep! Wales, specifically Aaron Ramsey, kick off from left to right as we watch.\n\n\n\n 7.00pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 7.00pm  \n\nAfter the obligatory blast of Seven Nation Army, which somehow still sounds magnificent despite being forced into our ears approximately 147,824 times in the past decade or so, it\u2019s time for the action. \n\n\n\n 6.59pm  \n\n\u201cAs an American, a Wales win is the last thing I want...\u201d says Daniel Stauss. \u201cBut as an MBM devotee, do it for Dony!\u201d\n\n\n\n 6.58pm  \n\nThe players are on the field, and it\u2019s time for the anthems. Despite the best efforts of Gareth Southgate in particular, it\u2019s a win for Wales.\n\n\n\n 6.52pm  \nA reminder of the teams\n\nWales (possible 4-2-3-1) Ward; N Williams, Mepham, Rodon, Davies; Ampadu, Allen; Bale, Ramsey, James; Moore.Substitutes: A Davies, Gunter, Wilson, Johnson, Roberts, Morrell, Lockyer, J Williams, Harris, Thomas, Levitt, Cabango, Colwill, Smith.\nEngland (4-1-2-3) Pickford; Walker, Stones, Maguire, Shaw; Rice; Henderson, Bellingham; Foden, Kane, Rashford.Substitutes: Pope, Ramsdale, Grealish, Sterling, Trippier, Phillips, Dier, Coady, Saka, Alexander-Arnold, Mount, Wilson, Maddison, Gallagher.\n\n\n\n 6.52pm  \n\n\u201cFired this up to get all emotional,\u201d says James Womack. \u201cThe aging hipster\u2019s alternative to Land of My Fathers.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 6.51pm  \n\n\u201cEngland\u2019s 100th World Cup goal could be scored tonight,\u201d says Roger Kirkby. \u201cThey are on 97 and need three more to do it. Remember who scores it as it will be in pub quizzes forever.\u201d\nThat\u2019s Rob Page\u2019s teamtalk sorted.\n\n\n\n 6.42pm  \n\n\u201cNice reference to Dylan Thomas there, Matt Dony,\u201d says Nathan Barnes. \u201cHere\u2019s hoping Wales can surprise us one last time? Nathan, from South Africa (a distant observer of this tournament).\u201d\n\nUpdated at 6.47pm GMT\n\n\n 6.33pm  \n\n\u201cKia ora from Aotearoa/New Zealand,\u201d writes Annabelle Garnett. \u201cI just cleaned the remnants of cheese from our toasted sandwich machine. I could have sworn the sticky yellow goo resembled England. It can only be an encouraging sign! Up the Three Lions!!!\u201d\nThat\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen the phrase \u201csticky yellow goo\u201d in close proximity to \u201can encouraging sign\u201d.\n\n\nUpdated at 6.50pm GMT\n\n\n 6.30pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 6.23pm  \n\nNo big Wales game would be complete without a pre-match stream of Matt Dony\u2019s consciousness.\n\u201cEuro 2016 was an astonishing, magical, stars-aligning, life affirming journey. But, let\u2019s face it, it was never going to be the pattern for future tournaments. Wales have a decent squad, but that\u2019s it. Their strength has always been an ability to rise above the sum of their parts (and then for Bale to do Bale things).\n\u201cI think a lot of people outside Wales have underestimated just how much it means to be there, to be at the party, so long after the last time. I honestly never thought this would happen in my lifetime. The performance against Iran was disappointing, there\u2019s no getting away from it. And as a result of that game, this is likely to be the end of the line.\n\u201cWales\u2019 best performances over the last decade or so have been when Ramsey, Allen and Bale have all been on the pitch. It\u2019s happened with depressing irregularity more recently, but it would be nice if they could sign off with a bang.\n\u201cTime catches up to all players; knobbles their legs, throttles their lungs, clouds their vision. But if those three old boys have got one more monster performance in them, now would be a helluva time to rage against the dying of the light.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 6.50pm GMT\n\n\n 6.21pm  \n\nWhen is he going to give Charlie George his head?\n\n\n\n\n 6.21pm  \n\n\u201cI know I\u2019m old-fashioned (no social media presence) and naive, but I fail to see why a Twitter frenzy puts pressure on Gareth Southgate, or anyone else for that matter,\u201d says Richard Hirst. \u201cSimply don\u2019t read it, ignore it, let the mob eat themselves, don\u2019t give them the satisfaction etc etc. \u201cI appreciate that these are the words of a bah humbug geriatric but \u2026 imagine the frenzy if Twitter had been around when Alf Ramsey played Geoff Hurst rather than Jimmy Greaves, and that didn\u2019t turn out too badly.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a complex situation that involves an evolving media landscape, changes in human behaviour and notions of identity in a digital world. I suppose the easiest way to summarise it is to say that, at some stage in the 2010s, the entire world went mad.\n\n\n\n 6.13pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 6.05pm  \n\nGroup A is done and dusted. The Netherlands put Qatar out of their on-field misery with a 2-0 win, and Senegal pipped Ecuador 2-1 in the second-placed playoff. \nThat means the winner of this group will play Senegal ojn Sunday evening (UK time), and the runner-up will meet the Netherlands on Saturday afternoon.\n\n\n\n\n 6.01pm  \n\nRead Jonathan Liew on Jacob Maguire\n\n\n\n\n 5.59pm  \n\nAnd what exactly does he know about taking free-kicks at a World Cup?\n\n\n\n\n 5.58pm  \n\nTom Lutz is a delightful human being \u2013 warm, smart, effortlessly funny, a creme de menthe connoisseur. A credit to the Guardian, and to humanity. Cherish him, appreciate him, say goodbye to him, because the poor bugger has been given the hottest potato in Guardian MBM history.\n\n\n\n\n 5.55pm  \n\nPre-match reading\n\n\n\n\n 5.48pm  \nEngland team news: Foden and Kane start\n\nGareth Southgate makes four changes to the side that drew against the USA on Friday. The most significant, though not the most eye-catching, is probably at right-back, where Kyle Walker replaces Kieran Tripper. Walker is a key part of Project Mbappe (and, if England are really lucky, Project Vinicius), so England want to get him match-fit. Walker has played only 41 minutes since the start of September.\nThe public gets what the public wants up front, where Phil Foden replaces Bukayo Saka on the right wing. Marcus Rashford is in for Raheem Sterling on the other side and Jordan Henderson replaces Mason Mount in midfield.\nJust one more thing: Ben White, who is unwell, isn\u2019t among the substitutes.\nEngland (4-1-2-3) Pickford; Walker, Stones, Maguire, Shaw; Rice; Henderson, Bellingham; Foden, Kane, Rashford.Substitutes: Pope, Ramsdale, Grealish, Sterling, Trippier, Phillips, Dier, Coady, Saka, Alexander-Arnold, Mount, Wilson, Maddison, Gallagher.\n\nUpdated at 6.12pm GMT\n\n\n 5.48pm  \nWales team news: three changes from Iran defeat\n\nGareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey start, despite speculation to the contrary, but there are three changes from Friday\u2019s miserable 2-0 defeat to Iran.\nDanny Ward, Dan James, Joe Allen replace Wayne Hennessey (who is suspended), Harry Wilson and Connor Roberts. That probably means a switch to a back four, though Ethan Ampadu\u2019s flexibility allows Rob Page to play either way. Or he could go rogue and stick Gareth Bale at left wing-back, like in the old days.\nWales (possible 4-2-3-1) Ward; N Williams, Mepham, Rodon, Davies; Ampadu, Allen; Bale, Ramsey, James; Moore.Substitutes: A Davies, Gunter, Wilson, Johnson, Roberts, Morrell, Lockyer, J Williams, Harris, Thomas, Levitt, Cabango, Colwill, Smith.\n\nUpdated at 6.11pm GMT\n\n\n 5.39pm  \nPermutations corner\n\nEngland\n\nIf they win, they win the group.\nIf they draw, they will win the group unless Iran beat the USA by any score or the USA win by at least four goals.\nIf they lose, it gets complicated. They will still qualify unless they lose by at least four goals; if England lose by 1-3 goals, they will still top the group if Iran draw with the USA.\n\nWales\n\nIf they win by at least four goals, they will qualify for the last 16.\nIf they win by fewer than four goals, they will only go through if Iran draw with the USA.\nIf they don\u2019t win, they\u2019ll do one.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.40pm GMT\n\n\n 5.30pm  \nPreamble\n\nWales v England is one of rugby\u2019s most intense rivalries \u2013 \u201clook what these bastards have done to Wales\u2026\u201d \u2013 but in football it has generally been a story of distaste rather than disgust. Tonight\u2019s match can viewed in multiple ways: as a local derby, a one-way rivalry, or an FA Cup fourth-round tie in Fifa clothing.\nThe game doesn\u2019t exist in a vacuum, which is one of the main reasons for the slightly odd pre-match mood. It\u2019s inextricably linked to Iran v USA, a match which could determine whether #WW3 is trending by midnight Wales qualify and/or England top the group.\nThe strangest thing is that Wales go into the final group game of their first World Cup since 1958 hoping that England win their group. It sounds absurd \u2013 offensive even, and you can direct your complaints to the readers\u2019 editor via guardian.readers@theguardian.com \u2013 but that, realistically, is the only way that Wales can qualify for the last 16. Unless they win by four goals tonight [spoiler alert\u2026], Wales will finish below England. Ergo, if England finish second, Wales do one.\nBut a one-goal win for Wales certainly isn\u2019t beyond the realms. If they manage that, and Iran draw with the USA, Wales will go through and Robert Page will complete the return journey from bald fraud to smooth-headed genius.\nThere\u2019s a decent argument, albeit not one I\u2019d volubly articulate in some of Cardiff\u2019s less forgiving freehouses, that reaching the last 16 isn\u2019t the be-all and end-all for Wales. This game feels as much about them leaving an impression on Qatar 2022 after two muted performances against the USA and Iran. Even if Wales go out tonight, the result and especially the performance will shape how their campaign is remembered. You never get a second chance to make a last impression. The likelihood is that this will be their final hit at the World Cup. But there are final hits and final hits. Which one is this going to be?\nEngland, by contreast, are slightly in limbo. To some this is a lifeless rubber, a chance to play Phil Foden, Trent Alexander-Arnold and all the other generational talents (sic) who would walk into a World XI but not Gareth Southgate\u2019s England. To others it\u2019s vital for morale that England win \u2013 not just the match but also the group and, at least until the next game, the oscillating voters on social media.\nThis is a very complicated game, you know: lotta ins, lotta outs, lotta what-have-yous. It\u2019s a night for both might and will, and not just as nouns. England might top Group B with a draw; they might be able to make multiple changes and still beat Wales. But another modest performance will exacerbate the absurd pressure that Southgate is under, largely because of hysterical criticism from Twitter\u2019s finest.\nEngland will top the group if they win, though there is an argument that finishing second is preferable. It would give them a tougher last-16 game (the Netherlands rather than Senegal) but a potentially less terrifying quarter-final (not France rather than France).\nFor the 974th time in this World Cup, I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. It\u2019s going to be that sort of night. \nKick off 7pm GMT, 10pm in Al Rayyan.\n\nUpdated at 5.37pm GMT\n"

                    "body": "The thought of representing his country at a World Cup never seemed plausible to Jonathan David when he was growing up. \u201cI just wanted to play,\u201d the Canada striker says. \u201cHave fun. I was nowhere near thinking: \u2018One day I\u2019m going to be playing in a World Cup with my country.\u2019 All this was just a dream.\u201d\nNot any more. For Canada\u2019s men, this is their first appearance on the global stage since 1986. Football\u2019s popularity has grown thanks to the emergence of an exciting generation of players who reached Qatar after excelling during qualifying, and David is buzzing. \u201cI\u2019ve thought about that first game,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat it will feel like to walk on the pitch for the first time. To see the fans, the stadium and to see the big team you\u2019re facing.\u201d\nThe draw has not been kind to Canada. Group F contains Croatia, who were beaten finalists at the 2018 World Cup, and an ageing but dangerous Belgium. Morocco are also an awkward proposition and yet, as David thinks about the prospect of taking on Luka Modric and Kevin De Bruyne, he is keen not to leave the impression Canada will be suffering from an inferiority complex.\n\nThe message is that Canada have no intention of making up the numbers. They have made rapid progress since appointing John Herdman as head coach in 2018. Herdman had performed well with the women\u2019s team, guiding them to bronze medals at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics, and the 47-year-old Englishman has had a similarly galvanising effect on the men.\nCanada, who face Belgium on Wednesday, will back themselves. They value possession, fly forward on the break and, in David, possess a forward key to Lille stunning French football by winning Ligue 1 in 2021.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t been to a World Cup for 36 years, but I don\u2019t think teams are thinking we\u2019re not a good team,\u201d David says. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll underestimate us. It would be a mistake to do so. It\u2019s going to be very hard because our group is very tough. But we have the belief we can get out of the group.\u201d\nDavid praises Herdman. \u201cI think the biggest secret to our team is our coach. He came at a great time, right after the 2018 World Cup, so we had four years to prepare. One of the first things he told us was: \u2018We\u2019re going to qualify for the World Cup.\u2019 Obviously at the beginning we didn\u2019t know what to think because we hadn\u2019t been to one for so long.\n\u201cBut he really brought us together. He brought in a brotherhood, with everyone working for each other and working hard. Over the years that grew and got us where we are today. From what I heard from the older players who who were on the national team before me, before John came the group wasn\u2019t united. There were some here, some there. He brought everybody together. And tactically he\u2019s very detailed in what he wants and how he wants to achieve it.\u201d\nWhen did David realise that something special was happening? \u201cWhen we played the USA at home in 2019 and won 2-0. The first time in 34 years that we beat them at home. That was like: \u2018Woah, something is happening here.\u2019\u201d\nCanada\u2019s rise is a triumph for openness and diversity. Their flying left-back, Bayern Munich\u2019s Alphonso Davies, was born in a refugee camp. David was born in Brooklyn to Haitian parents and spent his early years in Haiti, where he caught the football bug. \u201cI already loved the game before I got to Canada,\u201d he says. \u201cI was playing with my dad, watching him play, playing in the street with friends.\u201d\n\nDavid, who supported Barcelona and Brazil, moved to Ottawa when he was six. He wears the Canada shirt with pride but he loves the multicultural aspect to his identity. \u201cThe American part is what I have least because I didn\u2019t grow up there,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the Haitian part and the Canadian part are what make me who I am.\n\u201cMy Haitian part is always working hard. Never giving up, no matter what situation you\u2019re in. From the Canadian standpoint it\u2019s just always work hard as well but know that what you have is something that other people don\u2019t have.\u201d\nIt has been a long journey to the top. David joined his local side, Ottawa Gloucester SC, at the age of 11 before moving to Ottawa Internationals and was picked up by Canada\u2019s youth programme four years later. Focus was key. \u201cI had doubts here and there,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have a lot of people in your ears when you\u2019re young, telling you this and that, and when you\u2019re young you\u2019re very gullible and want to believe everything.\n\u201cI was lucky enough to have the right people around me. The best piece of advice might have been: \u2018Just remember in the beginning what you set out to achieve and you have to be a man of your word.\u2019\u201d\nDavid stuck at it after moving to Belgium to join Gent in 2017. He kept the homesickness at bay and took his chance when he finally made his first-team debut, coming off the bench to score a last-minute equaliser. \u201cAfter that everything happened very fast,\u201d he says.\nBlistering form led to David joining Lille at the start of the 2020-21 season. The early months in France were tough, but he soon hit his stride. \u201cWe came back from the Covid period,\u201d he says. \u201cI came very late to Lille. I didn\u2019t get a pre-season and had to get to know the team.\u201d\nThe results were devastating once David settled. Managed by Christophe Galtier, Lille took on Paris Saint-Germain. \u201cWhen I first arrived I didn\u2019t think about winning any league titles,\u201d David says \u201cI just thought about getting myself into shape. But as the season goes on and you think anything\u2019s possible. It\u2019s incredible to finish in front of PSG given the finances they have. It will stay in my my mind for ever.\u201d\nDavid\u2019s improvement was crucial. He scored 11 times after Christmas and opened the scoring when Lille clinched the title by beating Angers 2-1 on the final day. \u201cThe whole day leading up to the game I was nervous. This is the game that would define our whole season. You lose this game and all the work you did was for nothing. Everybody was a bit nervous.\u201d\n\nFortunately David is adept at controlling his emotions. The disappointment for Lille is that their rise was unsustainable. The team broke up \u2013 Galtier manages PSG now \u2013 and it would not be a surprise to see David move on next summer. He has played well since Paulo Fonseca\u2019s arrival at Lille. Fonseca\u2019s attacking style has brought the best out of David, who has 10 goals this season.\nIt is important for David to feel free on the pitch. He analyses the art of finishing. \u201cIt\u2019s when you have more time to think that you have doubts,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen a cross comes in I think it\u2019s all up to instinct. It\u2019s more when you\u2019re going through against the goalkeeper and you have space to think about what you\u2019re going to do that it becomes more difficult. But if it\u2019s touch, finish, there\u2019s no time to have doubts. Every game is an experience and you become better for it.\u201d\nDavid\u2019s hero was Thierry Henry. The former Arsenal striker once said he valued an assist more than a goal. \u201cI see where he\u2019s coming from,\u201d David says. \u201cBut for me it\u2019s not at the same level. The goal is more! But the assist is close.\n\u201cMy job is to score goals. But playing well and being involved in the game is what\u2019s going to get me my goals. Getting my touches, combining, making my runs in behind. After that everything is set.\u201d\nFew players are better than De Bruyne when it comes to making chances. \u201cAll this guy thinks about is: \u2018How can I assist my striker?\u2019\u201d David says of the Belgium midfielder. \u201cTo play with a guy like that would be a dream. You just have to run and you\u2019ll get the ball. We just have to find a way to stop him.\u201d"

Up front is an area of the pitch where we need players. If you have pace and can put the ball in the back of the net ... I\u2019m more than prepared to have a look at you.\u201d Kuol, who scored four goals in his first seven senior games for the Mariners and has recently been linked with a move to several top European clubs, is joined in the squad by his clubmate Jason Cummings, the Scotland-born attacker who is now eligible for the Socceroos having moved to Australia in January this year. But the continued absence of star midfielder Rogic is eye-catching just two months out from the start of the tournament in Qatar. The playmaker, who made an emotional departure from Celtic at the end of the last SPL season, finally joined a new club this week, signing a one-year deal with Championship side West Brom. The 29-year-old, considered a key player for Arnold, pulled out of the Socceroos\u2019 crucial World Cup qualifying playoffs earlier this year, citing personal reasons. No further details were given at the time and he has barely been seen since, until he was announced as a Baggies player on Monday. He will, however, have plenty of time to prove his form and fitness to Arnold before the World Cup begins, with West Brom to play more than 10 games before the coach announces his final squad in early November. \u201cHe\u2019s a player that\u2019s top quality. He brings a lot to the national team,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cAt this moment, he hasn\u2019t been selected for New Zealand because he hasn\u2019t kicked the ball in a game since May.\u201d Arnold said Rogic did not owe him an explanation for his withdrawal from the qualifiers and that the player had made himself available for World Cup selection. \u201cI never doubted in any way or any time that that wasn\u2019t the case,\u201d he said. \u201cHe loves the Socceroos. He has given 10 years of commitment to the Socceroos and has never waned. He doesn\u2019t need to explain. The most important thing for me is that he\u2019s happy.\u201d Four members of the Olyroos\u2019 Tokyo 2020 squad have been included in the latest squad \u2013 Keanu Baccus, Cameron Devlin, Ryan Strain and Tyrese Francois \u2013 while Harrison Delbridge has also won his first call-up. Thomas Deng, who also played at the Tokyo Olympics, rejoins the squad for the first time since 2018. \u201cI\u2019m excited to see a number of young Australian\u2019s gaining great experience across Europe and throughout Asia, and it is important we bring them into the national team environment to build on our depth and assess their capabilities at this level,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cWe have been closely monitoring our players since qualifying for the World Cup and are regularly speaking with them about this opportunity. I can\u2019t wait to get back into camp to work with our experienced group of players and the next generation of emerging stars. \u201cThe incentive couldn\u2019t be bigger, there\u2019s a place at the World Cup at stake and if you\u2019re working hard and playing well then there\u2019s an opportunity for you to represent your country on the biggest stage.\u201d Goalkeeper Mitch Langerak has also been included, after reconsidering his decision to retire from international football. \u201cAfter speaking with Mitch, I understood his decision at the time was made for family reasons and the unique circumstances where he is living in Japan, which had strict protocols in place during the Covid pandemic. We value him highly both as a person and a player, and he continues to perform at a high level in the J-League,\u201d Arnold said.

                    "body": "There have been a few good Eddie Jones stories going round the grounds lately. Joe Simpson told one the other day about the time Jones gave a steak to one of his assistant coaches as an apology for shouting at him. When the coach got home he found out it was a bag of sausages. \u201cYou\u2019re not ready for steak yet,\u201d Jones told him. Here\u2019s another, a little different to some of the others. In 2019, Jones read a Guardian article about an England fan who had travelled to watch the team play in Japan while he was sick with cancer. Jones asked for his number, rang him up and had a long chat with him about his illness, then sent him a Christmas present.  When Jones said last Saturday that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t care what people think\u201d, I don\u2019t think for a minute he was talking down to the fans, whom he had made a point of thanking at length for their help when England drew against New Zealand the previous week, but the press, yes, and the players and coaches working as pundits. Jones\u2019s behaviour when England lose has become wearily familiar. He says it is all his fault, which is his way of drawing the blame from his players, and then, often as not, he picks a fight. Which is why, after seven years of all this, he doesn\u2019t have too many friends left pulling for him when he needs them. Read Jones\u2019s autobiography and you can see he has been like this since he was a kid. He was the working\u2011class son of a Japanese-Australian marriage and grew up in a time and place where he felt there was a \u201chostility that bordered on hatred towards Japan\u201d. He realised early on that sport was his \u201cway to make a mark\u201d, but since he was smaller than most, and looked different too, he knew he needed to try harder than everyone else. He is the same way now. You can see it in his resentment of the idea that anyone else might know better, in his relentless work ethic and his belief that people need to be challenged to get ahead. Jones loves to make people uncomfortable. He thinks it is good for them. It\u2019s there, too, in his fondness for players who have a similar background to his own, \u201cI like the guys that have come up the tougher way,\u201d he said, \u201cwho have got to keep battling, have got to keep proving themselves\u201d. And in his scepticism about the private school system. It runs through his teams, which he shapes in his own image. The signature wins of his career were against the odds \u2013 Japan\u2019s over South Africa in 2015, England\u2019s grand slam in 2016, their semi-final against New Zealand three years later. He is a man who understands, by long and hard-won experience, how to play the underdog.  Which makes him an odd fit for England. If you asked fans around the world to sum up their image of English rugby, you would find \u201cunderdog\u201d comes a long way down of the list of responses, but its antonyms might be right up there and with some reason, since they have more players than most countries, more fans and more money. Jones even went through a stretch of insisting his team were second-favourites for every other game they played, which ended with him being repeatedly criticised for setting low expectations. \u201cEngland at home,\u201d wrote Clive Woodward, \u201cshould never be considered underdogs.\u201d I\u2019m not sure Jones has ever quite understood how to handle that aspect of his team\u2019s character. He is certainly less adept at coaching a team that expects to win. This time last year, he was talking about the edge South Africa had over England in the World Cup final in 2019, \u201cthat extra little bit\u201d of motivation Rassie Erasmus found when he spoke so well about what the game meant to their country. I asked if Jones knew what might do it for England. \u201cI\u2019d love to say yes but I\u2019m not sure I do and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to find. I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s got to do with their history or their society or it might be other things, but we\u2019re still searching for it.\u201d The irony is that England have been playing so badly lately, have lost so many games, that they have ended up going into the World Cup year as exactly that. Underdogs. Which may just suit Jones, if the Rugby Football Union lets him do it. What would they gain from pulling the feet out from under him now, three years into a four-year plan? It would leave them all-in on the long-shot possibility that a new coach could build a World Cup\u2011winning team in the nine months (and before you say it, Erasmus had double that when he took over South Africa). Maybe more important for them, they would be buying themselves a ready-made excuse when he does not. Jones has made plenty of mistakes, in his selections, the way he has treated some of his players and coaches, his persistence with a style of attack that clearly isn\u2019t working and his neglect of everything else but the World Cup (which reminds us of what Steve Hansen once said about him \u201csometimes wanting something so much [that it] can get in the way of actually achieving it\u201d). Jones has turned the future into a question of faith and the way his team have been playing lately has given people precious little reason to believe. But nine months out from the World Cup the best bet the RFU can make is to give him the chance to play his way out of the corner. It is, after all, something he\u2019s been doing all his life."

Nighty night!      10.22pm    Mikel Arteta speaks to Sky. \u201cToday was about being very patient \u2026 they made it difficult, there were no spaces to attack \u2026 they were waiting for a mistake to catch us on the break \u2026 Granit Xhaka was not feeling good and was sick, and could not play on \u2026 unfortunately there were a few players not feeling great \u2026 we are feeling it for Gabriel Jesus because his contribution is valuable \u2026 the love and respect we feel for him is huge \u2026 we will focus on being a better team every single day \u2026 we still have huge margins to improve \u2026 it\u2019s been a long time since we have been in this position, so fans fully deserve it, the huge transformation they have made with their energy that transmits to the players \u2026 the unity from the top of the club to our people, they are the soul of this club \u2026 we have to keep winning \u2026 we have a big challenge before us.\u201d     10.08pm    Wolves interim manager Steve Davis talks to Sky Sports. \u201cThere were good moments in the game, first and second half \u2026 we slowed them down really well \u2026 our shape was fantastic, hard to get through and over and round \u2026 we defended the box \u2026 we were happy at 0-0 \u2026 obviously there was a decision in the first half that should have gone for us, Guedes is onside clearly \u2026 you can see it was a foul and the last man, so it could have been a goal or a red card, because it would have been a penalty \u2026 so we feel hard done to, because those moments are important for us at the moment \u2026 if that decision had gone for us, it might have been a different story.\u201d     9.55pm    Hot managerial chat still to come \u2026 but Ben Fisher was at Molineux tonight, and his report is in. Don\u2019t forget to come back, now.      9.54pm    Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard talks to Sky Sports. \u201cWe had to dig deep today \u2026 we were a bit slow \u2026 but we know the quality we had and stayed patient, and it paid off in the end \u2026 we have to stay calm, it\u2019s a long way to the end of the season \u2026 there are some good teams around us.\u201d Aaron Ramsdale is by his side. \u201cEvery win is very big \u2026 this place is a really tough place to come \u2026 it\u2019s a massive win that gives us a boost and a bumper, but things will change over the break, and we have to come back how we finished up \u2026 we\u2019ll enjoy every minute of the World Cup and hopefully go and win that, then come back and focus on Arsenal!\u201d     9.49pm    Mikel Arteta\u2019s smile is as wide as the gap at the top of the table. He celebrates with his players in front of some very happy fans. Arsenal weren\u2019t at their best tonight, but still had more than enough for a Wolves side who played to a higher level than their unfortunate position in the table suggests. At the start of the season, their goal was merely a top-four finish. When it resumes after the World Cup break, it\u2019ll be title number 14 in their viewfinder. Four months is an awfully long time in football.     9.40pm   FULL TIME: Wolverhampton Wanderers 0-2 Arsenal  Arsenal go into the World Cup break five points clear of the second-placed champions Manchester City! Wolves will be bottom at Christmas, but at least they\u2019ll have a new manager to unwrap.    Updated at 9.44pm GMT    9.38pm    90 min +3: Julen Lopetegui is pictured in the stand. He doesn\u2019t look overly concerned. Wolves certainly haven\u2019t looked like a relegation-bound side tonight, against the most in-form team in the country. Plenty to work with.     9.36pm    90 min +2: The second of four added minutes. Bueno is booked for excessive yap.     9.36pm    90 min +1: Arsenal run down the clock by making a triple change. Saka, Vieira and Zinchenko are replaced by Nelson, Elneny and Cedric.     9.35pm    90 min: One corner leads to another, then Neves hoicks over from distance.     9.34pm    89 min: Arsenal ping it around. The fans crack out the ol\u00e9s! Zinchenko ships possession and allows Adama Traore to stride off towards the box. Traore lays off to Podence, who aims for the top right. Ramsdale sticks out a strong arm to deflect out for a corner, then bollocks the rest of the team for showboating.     9.33pm    88 min: The Arsenal fans run through their current favourite song: Tequila (Version). \u201cSo much depends on the World Cup for Arsenal,\u201d writes K\u00e1ri Tulinius. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the squad depth of Manchester City, so need most of their first eleven fit. I can see a scenario where the Arsenal players have an uneventful World Cup and return raring to go, but equally five or four of them could return injured or exhausted.\u201d     9.31pm    86 min: Podence, to the left of the Arsenal six-yard box with his back to goal, flicks the ball into the air and sends a bicycle kick towards the bottom right. It\u2019s beaten Ramsdale, but it\u2019s also wide of the right-hand post. Ramsdale grins and pokes out his tongue. The Arsenal keeper enjoying life right now.     9.30pm    84 min: Matt Dony will enjoy this. Adama Traore takes advantage of a Zinchenko slip and strides into the Arsenal box from the right. He then launches an absurdly overhit low cross through a crowded area, clearing the danger for Arsenal himself. The visitors go up the other end and win a corner that leads to nothing but eats up some time.     9.27pm    82 min: Nothing comes of the corner. But Wolves come again, Adama Traore bustling his way down the right and cutting back for his namesake Boubacar, who drags a shot wide left from an ambitious distance. \u201cFor defenders, there are varied challenges,\u201d begins Matt Dony. \u201cIn footballing terms, there must be different fears when they come up against skilful players, or fast players, or direct players, or relentless, scrappy players. But when you see Adama Traore running at you, it\u2019s not a \u2018footballing\u2019 fear. It must be an existential, guttural terror. A serious worry for your health and future. The man is incredible. If only he was a little bit better at, y\u2019know, football.\u201d     9.25pm    81 min: Nunes comes on for Toti. Lembikisa makes good down the right and wins a corner.     9.25pm    79 min: Guedes nearly dribbles his way through the middle of the Arsenal defence, having left Saliba behind with an audacious over-the-head flick and spin. But he can\u2019t make space for the shot. Arsenal counter, Odegaard nearly making himself enough space for a shot that might bring him his hat-trick. But he\u2019s closed down too. White eventually drags harmlessly wide.      9.22pm    77 min: Podence rolls a ball down the inside-left channel and releases Guedes into the box. Guedes goes for the spectacular, hitting a first-time shot on the turn \u2026 but only flashes the ball into the side netting.     9.21pm   GOAL! Wolverhampton Wanderers 0-2 Arsenal (Odegaard 75)  Young Lembikisa is penned in near his own corner flag on the left, then stripped of the ball by Martinelli. Then there\u2019s some pinball in the Wolves box. Martinelli takes a whack. Blocked by Sa. The rebound falls to Odegaard, who slams into the bottom left from 12 yards. Arsenal are going five points clear!    Updated at 9.27pm GMT    9.19pm    74 min: Boubacar Traore flicks the ball this way then that on the edge of his box before clearing his lines. The crowd enjoyed that little moment of sweet, simple skill.     9.17pm    72 min: Ramsdale is booed for having his Adam\u2019s apple flattened into a frisbee. Of course he is. Then Zinchenko curls into the Wolves box from the left. Sa claims under pressure from a couple of red shirts.  Updated at 9.17pm GMT    9.15pm    70 min: Happily, Ramsdale is back up quickly. He tells the referee he\u2019d taken that whack in the throat, so there\u2019s no need to worry about concussion. Play restarts.     9.15pm    69 min: Podence wedges a pass down the inside-right channel. Gabriel heads backwards. Ramsdale half-gathers, then spills, and Adama Traore, competing for scraps, clatters into him. Ooyah, ow, oof. Ramsdale stays down and on comes the trainer. No malice there.     9.12pm    68 min: Wolves make a double change. On come Podence and the 18-year-old Lembikisa for Moutinho and Semedo.     9.11pm    67 min: Adama Traore drives his way down the right to make himself a bit of space. From the byline, he loops towards the far stick. Ramsdale claims well, under pressure from the nearby Collins.     9.10pm    65 min: White creams a long pass to release Jesus down the left. Jesus twists and turns his way into the box, but is held up by Kilman. He tries to find Odegaard rushing in from the right with a clever diagonal ball, but Toti extends a leg to concede a corner. Nothing comes of that. A general sense that this won\u2019t end 0-1, but who\u2019ll score the next goal is anybody\u2019s guess.     9.09pm    64 min: Bueno crosses from the left. Semedo and Boubacar Traore get in each other\u2019s way. Wolves aren\u2019t finished yet.     9.08pm    62 min: White crosses from the right. The ball ends up at the feet of Martinelli, in Vieira Country to the left of the six-yard box. He crosses. Sa flaps. Odegaard tries to steer a header into the top right. Not quite. Jesus takes a fresh-air swipe and Wolves clear their lines. A second Arsenal goal would put the tin lid on it, you feel.     9.06pm    61 min: Guedes takes the free kick. He sends in a low drive from the left-hand corner of the Arsenal box. Ramsdale stoops to claim confidently. Guedes was probably hoping for that to take a nick off someone, but it flew through clean.     9.05pm    60 min: Gabriel is booked for sliding in late on Adama Traore, in flight down the left. Just outside the Arsenal box. Free kick in a very dangerous position.     9.04pm    59 min: Semedo whips in a cross from the right. It\u2019s almost immediately blocked by Martinelli \u2026 right in the fruit bowl. Ooyah, oof, that\u2019s gotta hurt. After a sip of water and a quick inventory, he\u2019s back up and good to go.     9.02pm    58 min: Such a clever pass from Jesus, too. Do Arsenal care if he\u2019s on a personal goal drought?     9.02pm    57 min: Wolves, bottom of the Premier League, had given as good as they got against the leaders. But now it could be all for nought. Arsenal have taken the lead in 11 matches so far this season. They\u2019ve won ten of them and drawn the other.     9.00pm   GOAL! Wolverhampton Wanderers 0-1 Arsenal (Odegaard 55)  Jesus plays a cute reverse pass down the inside-left channel to release Vieira, who makes it to the edge of the six-yard box before whistling a low cross into the centre. Odegaard races in to slam home. He couldn\u2019t miss. Wolves opened up brilliantly, and Arsenal could be going five points clear!   Updated at 9.07pm GMT    8.58pm    54 min: Boubacar Traore clips Vieira to the floor. He wants to watch himself, having already been booked.     8.57pm    52 min: Partey is booked for throwing a cynical leg across Semedo. The actual foul happened nearly two minutes previously, but an advantage (that came to nothing) was given to Wolves, and it took an age for the ball to go dead.  Updated at 8.58pm GMT    8.55pm    50 min: Zinchenko attempts to release Jesus down the inside-right channel. Jesus can\u2019t quite gather his long pass on the edge of the box.     8.53pm    48 min: Odegaard floats a ball into the Wolves box and nearly finds Vieira. But Wolves clear, and Adama Traore zips down the right wing at speed, before cutting infield and finding Guedes in acres on the opposite flank. Guedes tries to complete a long-range one-two but his return ball is well anticipated by Ramsdale, who smothers just before Traore can get there.     8.51pm    47 min: Arsenal get into their sterile passing rhythm. Not a particularly dynamic start to the second half.     8.49pm    Wolves get the second half underway. No changes.     8.39pm    Half-time entertainment. Jonathan Wilson explains how the beautiful game could suddenly go the way of your tatty old titfer. Hear him out.      8.36pm   HALF TIME: Wolverhampton Wanderers 0-0 Arsenal  That\u2019s the end of the first half. Wolves will be the happier of the two sides as everyone trudges off for their half-time orange segments.   Updated at 8.38pm GMT    8.35pm    45 min +2: Boubacar Traore is booked for hauling back Jesus as the Arsenal man hares down the left. A free kick and a chance for Arsenal to load the Wolves box. Odegaard swings it in, but Collins clears. Jesus grimaces as he rubs his achilles.   Updated at 8.36pm GMT    8.33pm    45 min +1: Guedes has been a right old handful, and now he finds himself on the right-hand corner of the Arsenal six-yard box, but with no route to goal. He tries to find another old gold shirt with a forensic cutback, but isn\u2019t successful. Arsenal clear.     8.32pm    45 min: Nothing comes of the needlessly conceded corner. There will be two added minutes.     8.31pm    44 min: Saliba gets away with a huge mistake. He plays a blind backpass down the Wolves left. It hits Guedes, who scampers into the Arsenal box. He should work Ramsdale at the very least, but in opening his body and aiming for the top right, gets his shot all wrong. But it takes a flick off Gabriel and out for a corner.     8.30pm    43 min: Vieira has a dig from 25 yards. It\u2019s blocked easily enough. Wolves are holding their shape nicely, and Arsenal are struggling to find a way through.     8.29pm    41 min: Guedes is half-wrestled, half-clipped to the floor on the edge of the Arsenal D by Gabriel. You\u2019ve seen fouls given for much less, but the referee is in a particularly laissez-faire mood tonight, and allows play to go on. Guedes and the Wolves fans not happy. Even less so when Adama Traore then blazes wildly over the bar.     8.28pm    40 min: White crosses deep from the right. Jesus comes haring in from the left and tries to steer a right-footed shot goalwards. He can only pull it wide left, and nearly adds injury to insult by crashing into the post. He avoids that slapstick fate. Just.     8.26pm    39 min: Martinelli probes down the left but ends up running the ball out of play for a goal kick. Kind of sums up Arsenal\u2019s uncharacteristically impotent play so far.     8.25pm    37 min: Toti is booked for a cynical trip on the in-flight Jesus. It\u2019s a booking all day long, but Wolves aren\u2019t happy about it, in the wake of the non-decisions that were beneficial to White and Odegaard. Two wrongs, etc.     8.23pm    36 min: Saka slips Jesus clear down the inside-left channel. Jesus enters the box, opens his body, and sends a curler meant for the top right pinging off the top of the bar and out for a goal kick. The flag then goes up for an offside. Probably correctly, though there wasn\u2019t much in it between Jesus and Wolves\u2019 last man Toti.     8.22pm    35 min: Kilman beats Zinchenko to a header down the right wing, sending Guedes into space. Guedes dribbles his way into the box \u2026 then trips over his own feet. Good football up until then.     8.20pm    33 min: Arsenal\u2019s Partey trick: the long throw. He fizzes one in from the left, and it pings off Neves for a corner. Wolves half clear it. Odegaard sends the ball back in from the left. Toti launches a clearing header upfield. Sa hasn\u2019t had a save to make yet against Arsenal\u2019s effervescent attack.     8.18pm    31 min: Arsenal ping it around in the old-fashioned sterile style.     8.17pm    29 min: Odegaard tugs back Moutinho by the arm. Just a free kick. No booking for that, either. The home fans are getting agitated. Moutinho isn\u2019t best pleased either, to be fair.     8.15pm    28 min: White takes up possession and finds himself also in receipt of some loud booing from the Wolves faithful. Panto season soon!     8.15pm    27 min: White isn\u2019t happy that Wolves are awarded a goal kick. He wanted a corner. He gives the linesman some beneficial advice before throwing the ball in his direction. He gets a long talking-to from the referee, and is pretty fortunate not to go into the book.     8.13pm    25 min: Arteta hugs the touchline, micro-managing his players in the Rafa Benitez style. He very nearly gets in the road of an in-flight Bueno. Let\u2019s hope Richard Keys has something else on tonight and isn\u2019t watching this. We worry about his blood pressure.   Updated at 8.25pm GMT    8.11pm    23 min: Vieira makes good down the left before pulling back for Zinchenko, who curls in a cross. Jesus flashes a header wide right. Good chance.     8.09pm    22 min: Jesus slaloms at speed down the inside-left channel from deep, nearly making it into the box. He\u2019s swarmed and crowded out before he can get a shot away. Lovely run, though.   Updated at 8.11pm GMT    8.08pm    20 min: White ships possession and Wolves counter down the right. Boubacar Traore slips a pass down the channel for Guedes, who sends a first-time screamer wide and high from the edge of the box. That\u2019s about one inch wide and one inch high. That was close. Wolves are looking dangerous whenever they get up the park.     8.07pm    19 min: Semedo tries to release Adama Traore down the middle, but Traore is miles offside and doesn\u2019t bother chasing. Had he been a little more aware of what was coming, he\u2019d have held back and sprung what passed for Arsenal\u2019s offside trap. Arsenal were at sixes and sevens.     8.05pm    18 min: Zinchenko is caught dawdling on the ball by Adama Traore, who goes barrelling down the middle of the park. Jesus saves his team-mate\u2019s blushes by chasing Traore down and stealing the ball back.     8.04pm    16 min: Xhaka can\u2019t continue. He walks off, blowing his cheeks out, the very picture of a man feeling as though he might boak. He\u2019s replaced by Vieira.     8.03pm    15 min: Saka sends in a flat corner at speed. You could hang your washing on it. What a delivery. Gabriel gets his eyebrows on it, but only sends the ball harmlessly wide left.     8.01pm    14 min: White, Odegaard and Saka triangulate down the right wing. Saka reaches the edge of the penalty box and crosses from a tight spot near the byline. The ball nearly squeaks into the top right, and Sa is forced to turn out for a corner.     8.00pm    13 min: One corner leads to another. Neither are very good.     7.59pm    12 min: Wolves look lively. Bueno bombs down the left and nearly opens Arsenal up with his dribble. Not quite. He\u2019s forced to turn tail. But Wolves come back at Arsenal, and Semedo wins a corner down the other flank.     7.59pm    11 min: Jesus busies himself down the inside-right channel, spinning away from Kilman but unable to get past Toti. Sa claims.     7.57pm    9 min: A nice open feel to the early exchanges, then. Saliba definitely clipped Guedes\u2019 heel. Somewhere in the multiverse, Arsenal are one up but down to ten men. For the want of a yard here, a yard there.     7.56pm    7 min: Semedo rolls a pass down the right for Adama Traore, who scampers into space. Traore curls low for Guedes, clear in the middle. But there\u2019s not quite enough pace on the ball, and Guedes is barged out of it on the edge of the box by Saliba. The referee would have had a decision to make there \u2013 Penalty? Red card? \u2013 had Guedes not been caught offside.  Updated at 8.40pm GMT    7.53pm    6 min: Martinelli drops deep on the left wing. He cuts infield and whips a stunning diagonal pass towards Jesus, free on the penalty spot! Jesus takes one touch before firing into the bottom left. That would have been a hell of a goal had Jesus not been clearly offside, and the flag goes up accordingly. But what vision from Martinelli, and a fine finish by Jesus to boot.     7.51pm    4 min: Xhaka\u2019s back up and appears good to continue. He\u2019ll battle on.     7.50pm    3 min: Xhaka squats on his haunches as he talks to the trainer and takes on some isotonic orange drink.     7.49pm    2 min: Arsenal spend the first 90 seconds pass, pass, passing and getting a feel of the ball. But then play stops as Xhaka doubles over. Looks as though he feels a little queasy. On comes the trainer.     7.47pm    Arsenal get the ball rolling. It\u2019s top versus bottom!     7.46pm    The teams are out! Wolves in old gold, Arsenal in red with white sleeves. Classic looks. We\u2019ll be off in a couple of minutes \u2026 one of those being spent in silent reflection in honour of the fallen. The lights dim. The Last Post. A moment perfectly observed.     7.42pm    Julen Lopetegui doesn\u2019t officially take charge of Wolves until Monday, but he\u2019s been given a sensational reception upon being introduced to the denizens of Molineux. Sky ask interim coach Steve Davis how much input the incoming Spaniard has had going into this fixture. \u201cNone really. He\u2019s stayed out of the way. Watched a bit of training yesterday. We had a meeting, we spoke about players and general things. He seems a good guy and a good fit for the club. The players have done their best, they\u2019re working as hard as they can, we just need to turn our results around.\u201d  Meanwhile Mikel Arteta adds: \u201cIt is a big night and we know how difficult it will be here. We have to perform well and earn the right to win. We just focus on ourselves.\u201d     7.29pm    Newcastle United have just beaten Chelsea 1-0 to reclaim third spot from Spurs, who had earlier leapfrogged them with a 4-3 win over Leeds. On the subject of today\u2019s Premier League results, there were two others that affected Wolves and Arsenal. Nottingham Forest\u2019s 1-0 victory over Crystal Palace means Wolves are now bottom, though they\u2019ll rise to 18th with a win this evening. Anything else, and they\u2019ll be bottom at Christmas. Meanwhile Brentford\u2019s sensational 2-1 win at Manchester City means that whatever happens here tonight, Arsenal are guaranteed to go into the World Cup break as leaders of the title race. But will they be two, three or five points clear of the champions? Much to play for tonight at both ends, yes sir!      6.57pm    Wolves make two changes to the side beaten 3-2 at home by Brighton &amp; Hove Albion last weekend. Toti and Adama Traor\u00e9 are in; Daniel Podence and Hwang Hee-chan are out. Arsenal are in If It Ain\u2019t Broke mode. No changes to the XI named for the 1-0 win at Chelsea last weekend.     6.48pm   The teams  Wolverhampton Wanderers: Jose Sa, Nelson Semedo, Kilman, Collins, Gomes, Bueno, Boubacar Traore, Neves, Joao Moutinho, Adama Traore, Goncalo Guedes.Subs: Ait Nouri, Daniel Podence, Sarkic, Mosquera, Ronan, Matheus Luiz, Hodge, Campbell, Lembikisa. Arsenal: Ramsdale, White, Saliba, Gabriel, Zinchenko, Odegaard, Partey, Xhaka, Saka, Gabriel Jesus, Martinelli.Subs: Tierney, Nketiah, Holding, Cedric, Vieira, Nelson, Elneny, Alencar, Turner. Referee: Stuart Attwell (Warwickshire).     6.45pm   Preamble  The club that owned the 1950s take on the dominant force of the 1930s. That\u2019s one way of looking at it anyway. Whatever, both clubs are coming at things from a different angle in the 2020s. Mikel Arteta\u2019s upwardly mobile side are looking to reassert The Arsenal as the best in the land. By contrast Wolverhampton Wanderers, under new boss Julen Lopetegui, are simply hoping to retain their top-flight status. Contrasting goals, same importance placed on grabbing all three points. Kick off under the famous Molineux floodlights is at 7.45pm GMT. It\u2019s on!  "

                    "body": "Even the most spectacular of Rugby World Cup finals will struggle to match the lofty heights scaled by Marlie Packer\u2019s intrepid grandfather this week. Ken Packer is 85 years old but that did not stop him jumping off the Sky Tower, New Zealand\u2019s tallest building, attached only to a couple of thin cables. If England show the same unflinching, can-do spirit at Eden Park, the rest will take care of itself. His warrior granddaughter, preparing for her third successive World Cup final, was as stunned and impressed as everyone else. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t believe it. They came around and said anyone over the age of 75 could go free. They gave him a special thing for his glasses so they didn\u2019t fall off his head and off he went. He loved it. When we walked back past it later in the evening, he was looking up and saying \u2018I can\u2019t believe I jumped off that.\u2019\u201d  Welcome to the Packer family, for whom impossible is nothing. Before he retired Ken helped to build helicopters at Westland\u2019s factory in Yeovil and you could say Marlie performs a similar role for England, specialising in the unglamorous nuts and bolts that make her team fly. As a vital breakdown presence, maul poacher and all-round energiser, Packer will have a big say in whether the Red Roses can end up on top of the world. To watch her piling into contact, seemingly oblivious to the consequences, is to wonder if she even feels pain. The answer, curiously, is yes and no. \u201cI\u2019m a bit of a wimp off the field. I\u2019m A Celebrity would be my worst nightmare. I don\u2019t like creepy crawlies. I don\u2019t like being cold either. But when I\u2019m on the pitch I\u2019m absolutely fine. As soon as I cross that line a switch goes inside me. I can be battered and bruised and you\u2019ll still have to drag me off.\u201d She also happens to be the only mother in this Red Roses squad, with a two-year-old son back at home. If being 11,500 miles away for six weeks has not always been straightforward \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ve been missing him but we\u2019re in the home straight now\u201d \u2013 their regular calls have been some consolation. \u201cThis morning he had his dragon book out and was telling me the colour of the dragons. He calls me Mummy Pickle, though it can be hard on FaceTime sometimes because he likes pressing red buttons. I have to say to him, \u2018Don\u2019t put the phone down on me, Oliver.\u2019\u201d  Just as well, perhaps, that the 33-year-old Packer is about to win her 89th cap and knows how to switch on and off before a big match. Those past two finals \u2013 one win, one loss \u2013 have also taught her plenty about seizing the day. \u201cThe first time [in 2014] I was a young whippersnapper. Me and Alex Matthews were just there to have a good time \u2026 I can remember us jumping around our room together after selection for the final had been announced. I was starting and she was on the bench. If you\u2019d asked us five weeks beforehand we\u2019d never have thought it was going to happen.\u201d Even better was her other favourite moment from that tournament, shortly after coming off the bench against Ireland in the semi-final and contributing two tries. \u201cFive minutes before the final whistle you just knew it was a very special team. Something had clicked and I\u2019d never felt like that in a team before. I knew going into that 2014 final against Canada that we were never going to lose it.\u201d The 2017 experience was rather different, New Zealand roaring back from 17-10 at half-time to win 41-32. \u201cWe\u2019d gone 16 or 17 games without losing going into that World Cup. We thought we were in a really good place and the first half was pitch perfect. But New Zealand knew their pick-and-go game was our achilles heel. We began to get a creeping feeling it was slipping away \u2013 and then I got taken off and had no control over anything. Were we looking sufficiently deep down at ourselves in certain regards in 2017? Either way, the better team won on the night.\u201d This time, though, Packer and her teammates have their eyes firmly on the prize. The semi-final against Canada may have been tense at times but England\u2019s no-nonsense flanker reckons her side will take some beating in the final. \u201cYou don\u2019t get a winning streak like we\u2019ve had by luck. We just need to make sure we\u2019re us. I\u2019m not worried about New Zealand. They\u2019ve won multiple World Cups and we\u2019re in their back yard. But I\u2019ve been part of a team that\u2019s beaten them here before. We\u2019ve also played in hostile environments in France so we know what that\u2019s like. We just know we have to have a good start, keep that scoreboard ticking over and keep being physical in all aspects of our game.\u201d  And when the going gets tough her high-flying grandpa\u2019s example will not be her only motivation. \u201cI\u2019ve not come here to have a repeat of 2017. I want to go home with the thing I\u2019ve been training for for the last five years. For me it\u2019s all or nothing. It\u2019s 80 minutes and it just a matter of whether we\u2019re going home with the trophy and a gold medal or whether we\u2019re going home as losers. No one ever remembers second place.\u201d"

The clip showed the team celebrating in their Hampden Park dressing room after their 1-0 victory against Scotland, singing \u201cOoh ah, up the \u2019RA\u201d \u2013 words associated with support for the Irish Republican Army. It comes from a song, Celtic Symphony by the Wolfe Tones, released in 1987 for the centennial of Celtic football club.  In a statement the FAI said: \u201cThe Football Association of Ireland and the Republic of Ireland women\u2019s national team manager Vera Pauw apologise for any offence caused by a song sung by players in the Ireland dressing room after the Fifa Women\u2019s World Cup qualifying playoff win over Scotland at Hampden Park on Tuesday night.\u201d Pauw said: \u201cWe apologise from the bottom of our hearts to anyone who has been offended by the content of the post-match celebrations after we had just qualified for the World Cup.  \u201cWe will review this with the players and remind them of their responsibilities in this regard. I have spoken with players this morning and we are sorry collectively for any hurt caused, there can be no excuse for that.\u201d The veteran player \u00c1ine O\u2019Gorman reiterated the apology, telling RT\u00c9 Sport: \u201cWe sang 100 songs last night and that was the one that went out. We would just like to apologise to anyone who was offended.\u201d The apology came after Ireland\u2019s stunning victory against Scotland, with a goal 18 minutes from time by Amber Barrett. Afterwards she dedicated her goal to the 10 victims of the Creeslough tragedy, saying: \u201cMy grandparents are born and bred there. I spend my holidays there with my uncle. I know people who died in the tragedy, who were affected by it, who were first on the scene. \u201cI\u2019m dedicating this result and the goal to the 10 beautiful souls who unfortunately perished, for all their families. I know they touched their lives and they have touched ours. This is for Creeslough. This is for Donegal.\u201d The apology was welcomed by the Ulster Unionist party leader, Doug Beattie. \u201cThey have let themselves down,\u201d he said. \u201cTruly disgraceful. Apology welcome. I was moved by the Creeslough dedication. We cannot have that. We cannot glorify the actions of a terrorist group.\u201d"

The Spurs coach says he has \u201cno worries\u201d over the mental state of his striker after working with him over the past two days at Hotspur Way. Conte did, however, describe the return of the Premier League as \u201cweird\u201d and said he was yet to make up his mind how best to use his players returning from the World Cup.  \u201cWe are talking about a world-class striker,\u201d Conte said of Kane. \u201cI am not worried about it, I saw him these two days with us, [he is] very well. Football is this: you can have an exciting moment and also have a moment when you are disappointed. He missed the second penalty, but he scored the first. When I was a player I never missed a penalty because I didn\u2019t [take a] kick. Never. I was a real disaster. But I still lost a final with a penalty [shootout] against Brazil.\u201d Conte was part of the Italy squad that lost the World Cup final at USA 94 after set-piece specialist Roberto Baggio hit his spot-kick over the bar, just as Kane did. \u201cYou live this moment and you are really disappointed,\u201d Conte recalled, \u201cbut then you know you have to move on and football gives you the opportunity to have other chances to enjoy.\u201d Spurs still have Cristian Romero absent, the centre-half celebrating with his Argentina teammates after their World Cup victory, while Richarlison and Rodrigo Bentancur are nursing injuries sustained in the tournament. Conte said the Brazil forward is still three to four weeks away from returning to training. Hugo Lloris will be on the bench for Spurs against Brentford, despite playing for France in last Sunday\u2019s final. \u201cLloris has come back but we want him to stay on the bench for Brentford,\u201d Conte said. \u201cIt is important we still give the [World Cup] players some rest. \u201cTo play after 41 days [break] it\u2019s strange. It\u2019s strange because usually you have this time to prepare a new season in the summer, after players are rested and your mind is clear. Instead I followed all my players in the World Cup with fingers crossed because you know very well you can lose [them]. Now it\u2019s a fresh start for players we\u2019ve worked with for four weeks, but for others it\u2019s a big effort.\u201d"

                    "body": "Iran\u2019s judiciary has announced that it will hold public trials for as many as 1,000 people detained during recent protests in Tehran alone \u2013 and more than a thousand others outside the capital \u2013 as international concern grew over Iran\u2019s response to the protests that began with the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini after her arrest.  The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said he was shocked by the number of innocent protesters who were being illegally and violently arrested. Germany\u2019s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, has already announced that she is to ask the European Union to sanction the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organisation. Canada meanwhile announced a fourth round of sanctions against senior Iranian officials and its law enforcement agents, which Canada accuses of participating in the suppression and arrest of unarmed protesters. Ukraine has meanwhile formally asked for Iran\u2019s football team to be banned from the World Cup starting next month in the wake of Iranian-manufactured drones being used by Russia to hit civilian and infrastructure targets inside Ukraine. For the first time Iran has acknowledged there was a danger that it might find itself excluded from the World Cup, a move that would be a devastating blow to a country that adores football. The Iranian president, Ibrahim Raisi, said he would be contacting Qatar, the hosts of the tournament.  Ukraine said Iran \u2013 due to play England on 21 November \u2013 \u201cis guilty of systematic violations of human rights, which probably violates the Fifa Charter\u201d.  The Shakhtar Donetsk CEO Sergei Palkin called for Iran to be replaced by Ukraine at this year\u2019s tournament. \u201cWhile the Iranian leadership will have fun watching their national team play at the World Cup, Ukrainians will be killed by Iranian drones and Iranian missiles,\u201d he said on Twitter.  The latest signs of external support for the Iranian protests led by women and students came as sit-ins continued in universities and more than 500 civilian journalists put their names to an internal petition demanding that reporters who helped break the story of Mahsa Amini be released from detention. In a sign of the justice being handed out, Mohammad Ghobadlo, a protester who was arrested on the charge of \u201ccorruption on earth\u201d after participating in an anti-government rally, was sentenced to death after just one hearing, his mother said on Monday. \u201cMy son is only 22 years old and he is also ill. They deprived him of having a lawyer and do not allow lawyers to enter the court,\u201d Ghobadlo\u2019s mother said in a clip published online. \u201cThey interrogated him without having access to a lawyer, and sentenced him to death after only one hearing. Is this Islamic justice? In which court of law do they sentence people to death after just one hearing? They are going to execute him soon. I ask people to help,\u201d she added in the video. Security services have unleashed a fierce crackdown on the mainly peaceful protests, in which at least 253 people have been killed, including 34 Iranians under 18, according to one human rights organisation. Several thousand people have been arrested, many of whom were taken to special IRGC detention centres.The Iranian elite nevertheless remains divided between those who want to treat the protests solely as the product of a well-laid foreign conspiracy best brought to a halt by repression, and those who say the disturbances, now in their sixth week, reveal deep problems in Iranian society, including an untrusted and muzzled official media that leaves young Iranians dependent on western satellite channels. The former foreign minister Javad Zarif appeared to side with those calling for talks, saying opponents of dialogue, regardless of their disguise or slogan, seemed to prefer violence.  The main state news agency IRNA reported that 1,000 detained protesters had played a \u201ccentral role\u201d in the unrest. Each is due to be tried alone for \u201csubversive actions\u201d, including assaulting security guards, setting fire to public property and other charges.  \u201cThose who intend to confront and subvert the regime are dependent on foreigners and will be punished according to legal standards,\u201d said Iran\u2019s judiciary chief, Gholam-Hossein Mohseni Ejei, indicating that some protesters would be charged with collaborating with foreign governments. Ejei claimed that prosecutors sought to differentiate between angry Iranians \u2013 who merely sought to vent their grievances on the streets \u2013 and those who wanted to take down the Islamic Republic. \u201cEven among the agitators, it should be clarified as to who had the intention of confronting the system and overthrowing it,\u201d he said. Iran\u2019s government is also having to confront the fallout from a round of trials, funerals and 40th day commemorations as the death toll mounts. Apart from the two journalists arrested, attention focused on Monday on Hassan Ronagi, Hossein Ronagi\u2019s brother, who said that after 41 days, his parents were finally allowed to meet Hossein in prison. He says Hossein was still on hunger strike and \u201cwas not well\u201d. Ronagi was dragged into a police car soon after the protests started."

                    "body": "\u201cI\u2019m not well versed on international politics. I\u2019m a football coach,\u201d said Gregg Berhalter, but he was a man who had just been exposed to politics in the raw. Twenty-four hours before his side\u2019s definitive Group B fixture against Iran, the USA head coach had been hit by a fusillade of hostile questioning from Iranian media. Everything from censorship to American racism and the presence of the US fleet in the Gulf was thrown at him. It was an experience he will never have had before and few coaches will encounter.\n\nIt was not entirely unpredictable, however. The complicated and bloody history that exists between Iran and the USA has led to simple sporting encounters between the two nations becoming diplomatic flashpoints. It was the case when the countries first faced each other at the World Cup during France 98 and, in a different way, it has happened again now.\nThe immediate occasion for tension is the current uprising in Iran. After the death in police custody of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old arrested for failing to properly wear the hijab, protests have spread across the country. More than 450 people have since been killed, according to the advocacy group Human Rights Activists, and more than 18,000 arrested. The protests have followed the men\u2019s side to Qatar, where the team refused to sing the national anthem before their match against England. Supporters have also brought banners and T-shirts bearing Amini\u2019s name into stadiums, often having them confiscated by security in a country that is an ally of the Iranian state.\n\nThe US government has publicly sided with those revolting against the authorities. The secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said Amini \u201cshould be alive today\u201d and called on the Iranian government to \u201cend its systemic persecution of women and to allow peaceful protest\u201d. The USA team had stayed out of it, however, until on Saturday night the US Soccer Federation altered the banners on its social media accounts to show the standings in Group B, only with an Iranian flag without the symbol of the Islamic Republic.\nThe men\u2019s team and their staff insist they had no knowledge of this stunt and, on Monday, Berhalter apologised for it. But to judge by the stream of agitated questioning from Iranian journalists it had provided an opportunity to deflect criticism away from the Iranian authorities and on to a more traditional enemy.\n\nThe history of American (and British) involvement in Iran in the 20th century is shameful and entwined with the pursuit of oil. In conjunction with the British, the US provoked a coup that deposed the democratically elected leader of Iran, Mohammad Mosaddegh, in 1953. They subsequently reimposed royal rule under the Shah, Mohammad Reza, and propped up his corrupt regime, retaining control of the oil fields at the same time as switching political allegiance to regional rival Saudi Arabia. After the Islamic Revolution of 1978-79, the religious leadership became an enemy for successive US presidents and the US provided funding to Saddam Hussein throughout the eight years of the Iran-Iraq war. More recently, attempts at resetting relations between the US and Iran were reversed by Donald Trump. There is a reason they are known as the Great Satan.\nThis is what Berhalter walked into in Doha and while it is possible that he ought to have been better briefed as to the context of this fixture, it is also true he has experience of football rising above the tensions between these two countries. That match in Lyon in 1998 was billed \u201cthe mother of all games\u201d. An unprecedented security presence was put in place to limit the risk of pitch invaders or violent protest. Iranian players were told not to approach their American opponents to shake their hands, as Fifa protocol dictated. Tension ran high.\n\nAnd yet a compromise was found. The Iranians instead handed the Americans flowers, the atmosphere in the ground remained voluble but calm. Iran won 2-1 but mutual respect was earned and a rematch arranged for the following year on American soil, itself a diplomatic achievement. \u201cWe did more in 90 minutes than the politicians did in 20 years,\u201d the USA midfielder Jeff Agoos said.\nBerhalter was watching on that day in Lyon, his \u201cfirst and only game\u201d as a TV pundit, he revealed at his press conference. He responded to the Iranian barrage of questions with humility and honesty, his captain Tyler Adams likewise. But Berhalter\u2019s takeaway from the 1998 fixture was not about geopolitics but sport. He saw in the Iran team a quality he wishes for his own players at Al Thumama stadium on Tuesday.\n\u201cThat game sticks in my mind, it burns in my mind,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was one team that really wanted to win the game that day and one that didn\u2019t. For us to have a chance to advance in this World Cup, we are going to have to play like they did.\u201d"

                    "body": "Everyone loves seeing a bully put on their backside. Crowds adore the mouse that roars or a minnow that swallows a whale. International sport is built on such David v Goliath dramas. It\u2019s the victory of heart over head, the triumph of the fight in the dog, not the dog in the fight \u2013 a reminder that the favourite is a misnomer and it\u2019s the dark horse we\u2019re often drawn to. Hence why the handful of upsets in the 2021 Rugby League World Cup so far have been more satisfying than the shellackings and spiflications that are usually the norm at this event. It\u2019s the same reason Trevor Immelman, Rulon Gardner, James Douglas, Anna Keisenhofer, Karne Hesketh and Frank Borghi are names etched deep in the memory of sports fans.*  The first upset was when England demolished Samoa 60-6 in the opening game of the tournament. On paper, a team drawn from 56 million vanquishing one of 200,000 citizens is not shocking. Nor is it surprising when you recall Samoa have won just two Tests since 2016 (against the Cook Islands and Papua New Guinea) and went through the last World Cup winless from their four matches. Luckily their $30 per diem meant they didn\u2019t go home empty-handed. But this Samoan side featured six Penrith NRL premiership winners (NSW stars Brian To\u2019o, Stephen Crichton and Jarome Luai among them), two players from the runner-up Parramatta side, three ex-Origin forwards in Junior Paulo, Jaydn Su\u2019A and Josh Papali\u2019i and teen star Joseph Sua\u2019ali\u2019i. So star-studded were Samoa, many had them as the dark horse to win the World Cup. No wonder England coach Shaun Wane claimed his side were \u201cunderdogs\u201d. Ultimately Samoa were humiliated by the home side, leaking six tries in the final 16 minutes. In round two, Ireland and Wales were then upset by Lebanon and Tonga, both teams bolstered by NRL recruits and Lebanon\u2019s Cedars by coach Michael Cheika, ex-Wallabies mentor, lifelong league fan and proud son of Lebanese migrants. This week the Cook Islands have a real sniff against Tonga and France can make life very difficult for Samoa. It continued a proud tradition of World Cup upsets that must continue for the game to thrive. In 2008, Ireland knocked out Samoa. In 2013, the USA beat Wales, and Scotland shocked Tonga. In 2017, New Zealand were gazumped by Tonga, then Fiji. Indeed, Australia\u2019s last international before this World Cup was a shock 16-12 loss to Tonga in Auckland in 2019.  A key factor in this levelling up is players from Tier One nations (Australia, New Zealand, England) forsaking the jerseys of their homeland (and the payment fees that go with it) in homage to the heritage of forebears by representing Tier Two and Three nations. The end result is more upsets, less blowouts, stronger competition with tighter scorelines, and an elite talent pool spread further around the globe. NRL players have sensed this opportunity and stepped up \u2013 or, for heartfelt reasons, back. Lebanon, Greece, Papua New Guinea and the Cook Islands all feature upwards of five NRL players in their squads. Only Jamaica, Wales and France will not field NRL stars at this World Cup (although the latter is mentored by Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson). In total, 155 NRL players will turn out for 13 of the 16 squads. This rising tide of new loyalties lifts all boats. Players qualify to represent a nation by virtue of a) birthplace, b) residency for a period of five years, and c) \u201cwhere the player has a parent or grandparent whose heritage permits them to play for a country other than where they were born or are resident\u201d. Defections also freed Mal Meninga to pick 13 uncapped players in Australia\u2019s 24-man squad. Players love World Cups, as they do the annual All Stars-M\u0101ori game because it allows them to honour their roots while keeping feet in a few camps. Many NRL stars take on \u2018elder\u2019 status in less-experienced squads. There\u2019s personal growth and a deepening of cultural connections, a small price to pay for the occasional walloping at the hands of their club teammates. Josh Papali\u2019i was born in New Zealand, has eight caps for Australia but this year is debuting for Samoa. Even Australia\u2019s captain, fullback James Tedesco, was raised in Menangle in Sydney\u2019s south-west but represented Italy, his father\u2019s birthplace, in the last two World Cups. Such transient loyalty to his father\u2019s motherland is unlikely to cloud Tedesco\u2019s thinking when his Kangaroos put Italy to the sword on Sunday morning. They have already dispatched Fiji 42-8 (despite the Fijians threatening a boilover by scoring the first try of the game) and last week they routed Scotland 84-0, the biggest scoreline margin of the tournament so far.  Italy have a harsh lesson awaiting them, but it\u2019s a valuable one. Without elite professionals plying their trade on the same field as amateurs from lower tiers, the game cannot grow. After years of ugly but necessary mismatches, cricket is bearing this fruit at its T20 World Cup, with former minnows Ireland this month eliminating West Indies and defeating England. With women\u2019s and wheelchair competitions running in tandem, this World Cup is, says chief Jon Dutton, \u201cthe biggest tournament in the sport\u2019s 127-year history\u201d and \u201cinternational rugby league\u2019s moment to shine\u201d. Can its best players, across an expanded pool of 16 nations, stand with football and rugby union as a \u2018world game\u2019? It\u2019s a dark horse worth watching. * World No 1,673 Immelman beat Tiger Woods to claim the 2007 Masters; \u2018nobody\u2019 wrestler Gardner defeated nine-time world champion Alex Karelin at the 2000 Olympics; Douglas KO\u2019d 37-0 heavyweight champ Mike Tyson in 1990; 500-1 amateur cyclist Keisenhofer took gold in the road race at the 2020 Tokyo Games; Hesketh scored the try for Japan to shock South Africa at the 2015 Rugby World Cup; and Borghi was the hearse driver from Missouri who made several key saves as the USA beat England at the 1950 World Cup."

                    "body": "1) Australian Open 16 January-29 January Novak Djokovic will be at the Australian Open and this time he is here to stay. The Serbian found himself at the centre of a Covid-related storm before this year\u2019s tournament that resulted in him being deported. But having had his visa ban overturned, Djokovic is free to compete in Melbourne for what would be a 22nd grand slam title. The defending champion, Rafael Nadal, is among those who stand in his way. There will definitely be a new women\u2019s champion given Ashleigh Barty\u2019s decision to retire from tennis two months after her historic triumph on home turf. * * * 2) Chris Eubank Jr v Liam Smith 21 January Chris Eubank Jr versus Conor Benn was one of the most anticipated fights of 2022 but did not happen in an episode that shamed British boxing. On the bright side, it freed Eubank Jr to sign up to a bout that has the potential to be as explosive as it is engrossing. He and Liam Smith are well matched and head to Manchester\u2019s AO Arena on the back of impressive winning runs. It is hard to call a winner, although Eubank Jr is characteristically sure he will come out on top. \u201cI\u2019m twice the fighter he is,\u201d said the 33-year-old. * * * 3) Men\u2019s &amp; Women\u2019s Six Nations 4 February-18 March, 25 March-29 April An ever-fascinating competition takes on a further layer of intrigue given the change of head coach by two of the teams involved. Will England be rejuvenated under Steve Borthwick? Will Wales be back to their very best now Warren Gatland has returned to the helm? It\u2019s very much a case of popcorn at the ready and especially so given those involved \u2013 including the reigning grand-slam champions France \u2013 are not just fighting for the prize in front of them but also gearing up for a World Cup in seven months\u2019 time. The opening weekend of the Women\u2019s Six Nations sees the holders, England, take on Scotland at Kingston Park as the Red Roses rebuild after their World Cup final loss to New Zealand. * * * 4) Women\u2019s T20 World Cup 10 February-26 February The eighth edition of this tournament takes place in South Africa for the first time and should be fun given the fast and furious nature of proceedings, with two groups of five teams immediately leading to semi-finals, both of which will take place in Cape Town, as will the final. For Heather Knight\u2019s England the objective is to win the trophy for a first time since 2009, something that is easier said than done given the presence of the defending champions and five-times winners, Australia.  5) Formula One World Championship 5 March-26 November Once again, F1 will attempt to stage a 23-race season. It didn\u2019t happen this year due to the cancellation of the Russian Grand Prix but should occur in 2023 following the addition of races in Las Vegas and Qatar. There is even the potential for a 24-race campaign should a replacement be found for the Chinese GP, which was cancelled due to Covid restrictions. There will also be six sprint qualifying races next year, up from three last season. As for the teams, champions Red Bull will remain unchanged, as will Mercedes and Ferrari. There are shake-ups elsewhere, most notably at Aston Martin where Fernando Alonso replaces fellow former world champion Sebastian Vettel. * * * 6) Cheltenham Festival 14 March-17 March Constitution Hill is the name on every racing fan\u2019s lips right now and he could be the talk of pubs and clubs throughout the land by the time of the Cheltenham Festival. Turf experts Timeform already have him as the joint-sixth best two-mile hurdler ever on their ratings and he has only raced four times. The widespread expectation is that Constitution Hill will win the Champion Hurdle on the Festival\u2019s opening day and it is no exaggeration to say that the sport may be hailing an all-time great.  7) The Masters 6 April-9 April Could this finally be Rory McIlroy\u2019s time to slip on the Green Jacket? The 33-year-old will certainly hope so and should be infused with belief given his status as world No 1. McIlroy\u2019s second place in Augusta this year, when he shot a final round 64 to push the eventual winner Scottie Scheffler all the way, should also provide him with confidence. The Saudi-backed LIV Golf will undeniably cast a shadow over the build up to the first major of 2023, with Masters chairman, Fred Ridley, announcing this month that those signed up to the rebel will not be banned from Augusta. * * * 8) World Snooker Championship 15 April-1 May According to Jimmy White, Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan wants to win 10 world championship titles before he retires. If that\u2019s indeed the case, \u201cThe Rocket\u201d will be energised before doing battle at the Crucible. He will arrive there as reigning champion having secured a record-equalling seventh crown with victory over Judd Trump in the 2022 final. It was a battling triumph that also made O\u2019Sullivan, at the age of 46, snooker\u2019s oldest world champion. \u201cWe\u2019ll probably go again next year,\u201d he said having collected his trophy and the \u00a3500,000 prize. * * * 9) Women\u2019s FA Cup final 14 May This year\u2019s final saw Chelsea beat Manchester City 3-2, thanks in large part to two goals from Sam Kerr. The win also secured the double for Emma Hayes\u2019s side and took place in front of a crowd of 49,094, a record attendance for a Women\u2019s FA Cup final. The hope is that even more people will attend 2023\u2019s climax to a campaign that got under way in September and again will be staged at Wembley.  10) Men\u2019s Champions League Final 10 June After various failed attempts, Istanbul\u2019s Atat\u00fcrk Stadium will host the men\u2019s Champions League final for the first time since 2005. Liverpool would love to return to the stadium where they won a fifth European Cup in miraculous fashion but face a challenge doing so given they have been drawn to face Real Madrid, who beat them in this year\u2019s final, in the last 16. Manchester City have the far easier task of taking on RB Leipzig, and with Erling Haaland in attack this could well be the year Pep Guardiola\u2019s side finally triumph in European football\u2019s premier competition. * * * 11) Men\u2019s &amp; Women\u2019s Ashes 16 June-31 July, 22 June-18 July England\u2019s bid to regain the men\u2019s Ashes will be played out in frantic fashion, with the five-Test series compressed into the space of 46 days to allow the Hundred to again take centre stage in August. It will be a tough ask for Ben Stokes\u2019s side but they will no doubt be up for it, and if they stick to the principles of Bazball it should make for thrilling viewing for those lucky enough to have tickets for the Tests, which are to be staged at Edgbaston, Lord\u2019s, Headingley, Old Trafford and the Oval. The women\u2019s side are also aiming to regain the Ashes and begin their campaign with a first five-day women\u2019s Ashes match since 1992, to be held at Trent Bridge. There follows three Twenty20s and three one-day internationals. * * * 12) Tour de France &amp; Tour de France Femmes 1 July-23 July, 23 July-30 July The 110th edition of the Tour is an especially mountainous one, with the three-week race tracing a 3,400km route from the Basque country to the German border, with stages in the Pyrenees, Massif Central, Jura, Alps and the Vosges. Good news, perhaps, for the reigning champion, Jonas Vingegaard, but undeniably a source of frustration for Mark Cavendish as he attempts to beat Eddy Merckx\u2019s all-time record of 34 stage wins. A sprinter\u2019s paradise it is not. The women\u2019s Tour, which was relaunched this summer and won by Annemiek van Vleuten, begins in Clermont-Ferrand before heading south. * * * 13) Wimbledon 3 July-16 July According to Wimbledon\u2019s official website, a record number of people have applied for tickets for the 2023 Championships via the public ballot, which is perhaps not a surprise given how this year\u2019s tournament climaxed, with Novak Djokovic clinching the men\u2019s title via an engrossing four-set victory over Nick Kyrgios and Kazakhstan\u2019s Elena Rybakina beatings the odds and her own expectations to clinch a debut women\u2019s title with victory over Ons Jabeur. Domestic hopes largely rest with Cameron Norrie, who did brilliantly to reach this year\u2019s semi-finals, and Emma Raducanu, who continues to search for a first title since her stunning US Open triumph.  14) World Aquatics Championships 14 July-30 July The 20th edition of water sports\u2019 most prestigious event was meant to be held in Fukuoka, Japan, in the middle of May but was moved to the summer by governing body, Fina, following Covid-related concerns. The United States won 49 medals, including 18 golds, at this year\u2019s championships in Budapest and are again expected to dominate. Among Great Britain\u2019s medal hopes will be Ben Proud, whose electric display in the men\u2019s 50m freestyle final saw him land gold in Hungary. * * * 15) Women\u2019s World Cup 20 July-20 August Australia and New Zealand co-host the ninth edition of this tournament, and it will be the largest ever with 32 competing nations. Three places remain up for grabs and will be finalised via a 10-team playoff tournament taking place across five days in February. One of the qualifiers will be in England\u2019s pool, Group D, and the aim for Sarina Wiegman\u2019s European champions is to go all the way. Standing in their way is the formidable presence of the USA, reigning world champions and the No 1 ranked side in the world. * * * 16) Netball World Cup 28 July-6 August Cape Town is the venue for world netball\u2019s premier tournament and from a home nations point of view there is the exciting prospect of a group-stage meeting between England and Scotland. Wales, meanwhile, are in the same group as hosts South Africa, while New Zealand, the reigning champions after their 52-51 victory over Australia in the 2019 final in Liverpool, are in the same group as Uganda, Trinidad &amp; Tobago and Singapore. Sky Sports will show live coverage of every World Cup fixture. * * * 17) Cycling World Championships 3 August-13 August Among the changes for next year\u2019s championships is the women\u2019s elite road race, as opposed to the men\u2019s, bringing the curtain down on all the action, and the hope for organisers is that Annemiek van Vleuten takes part having won gold at this year\u2019s road race in Wollongong, Australia, despite suffering with a broken arm. Even if Van Vleuten doesn\u2019t compete, there will be plenty for spectators in Glasgow to enjoy, including the first simultaneous staging of track and para-track world championship events, which in 2023 will take place at the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome.  18) World Athletics Championships 19 August-27 August There is no doubting Budapest\u2019s pride in staging global athletics\u2019 premier competition, seen most clearly in the fact organisers have built a venue specifically for the event. The National Athletic Centre will be the setting for nine days of elite sporting action involving track and field competitors from 200 nations. For Team GB the aim is to exceed the seven medals they won at this year\u2019s world championships in Eugene, the standout of which was Jake Wightman\u2019s stunning gold in the men\u2019s 1500m. * * * 19) Men\u2019s Rugby World Cup 8 September-28 October France host the World Cup for the first time since 2007, when South Africa were crowned champions. This time the Springboks arrive as holders and will believe they can again go all the way, especially given they have been placed in what looks like a relatively kind pool, alongside Ireland, Scotland, Tonga and Romania. The hosts, meanwhile, are in the same pool as New Zealand and it is those two sides who get the tournament under way with a mouthwatering clash in Paris. * * * 20) Solheim Cup 22 September-24 September Team Europe will be chasing a third consecutive Solheim Cup victory for the first time in the tournament\u2019s history when they host the event in Finca Cortesin, Spain, and the captain Suzann Pettersen is confident of success given the pedigree of players she has to pick from, especially the younger ones. \u201cI feel like every week there are new rookies continuing to deliver with great results,\u201d she said. \u201cJust look at the Swedes [Maja Stark and Linn Grant]; they\u2019ve pretty much played themselves on to the team.\u201d Standing in Europe\u2019s way is a US team captained by Stacy Lewis.  21) Ryder Cup 29 September-1 October The 44th Ryder Cup will take place at the Marco Simone Golf &amp; Country Club, just outside Rome. Questions remain, however, about exactly who will represent Luke Donald\u2019s European team and Zach Johnson\u2019s US team given the lack of confirmation on bans for those who have signed up to LIV Golf. The suggestion is that the rebels will be prevented from taking part, meaning the likes of Sergio Garc\u00eda, Lee Westwood, Brooks Koepka and Bryson DeChambeau missing out. For Donald, who took over from Henrik Stenson after he was sacked as Europe\u2019s captain for defecting to LIV, the aim is to avenge the United States\u2019 record 19-9 victory at Whistling Straits. * * * 22) Super League Grand Final 14 October Can anyone stop St Helens? That will be the overriding question going into the new Super League season after Saints made it a record-breaking fourth consecutive Grand Final victory in September. The big hope for their rivals is that a change in head coach, from Kristian Woolf to Paul Wellens, will lead to significant disruption at the Totally Wicked Stadium and, ultimately, a new team lifting the domestic game\u2019s most treasured trophy at Old Trafford in October.  23) Men\u2019s Cricket World Cup October-November India hosts one-day cricket\u2019s most prestigious tournament for a fourth occasion and for the first time since 2011, when a side led by MS Dhoni were ultimately triumphant. The hosts will be seeking more glory on home soil and are among the favourites for a trophy that will be contested by 10 teams via a round-robin stage that eventually leads to knockout contests. For England the aim is to hold on to the crown they won in thrilling fashion against New Zealand in 2019."

                    "body": "How can I follow the final? The final is scheduled to start at 7pm in Melbourne, 8am GMT, at the MCG. In the UK it will be shown free-to-air on Channel 4 and also on Sky Sports Main Event. Test Match Special on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra will have live commentary, while Rob Smyth will be helming theguardian.com\u2019s unrivalled over-by-over report. How did they get here? Pakistan had a miserable start, losing to India in a nailbiter and then to the qualifiers Zimbabwe. That looked to be their tournament over and even three wins from their final three group games would not have been enough if South Africa had not slipped to a stunning defeat to the Netherlands. That opened the door to a semi-final against New Zealand, who were swatted aside thanks to a century opening partnership between Mohammad Rizwan and Babar Azam.  England had a similarly slow start, losing to Ireland in their second game then seeing a crunch tie with Australia rained off. But impressive wins over New Zealand and Sri Lanka saw them scrape through to the semi-finals on net run rate. Against India, Jos Buttler\u2019s side truly ignited, with the captain and Alex Hales smashing them to an utterly dominant 10-wicket win. Who are the stars? Openers Rizwan and Azam, the men\u2019s No 2 and No 4 T20 batters in the world, had a slow start but Rizwan, in particular, has found his form as the tournament has progressed. Mohammad Haris has weighed in with vital middle order runs. With the ball, Shaheen Shah Afridi has a claim to have been the best seamer in the tournament, while Shadab Khan\u2019s parsimonious leg-spin is always a threat. England\u2019s batting lineup is probably the deepest in the world but the onus is still on the openers Buttler and Hales, who blitzed the India attack in the semi-final. Sam Curran has been exceptional with the ball, both in the power play and the death overs, and Adil Rashid started the tournament slowly but was superb against India. Has either team won it before? For both teams this will be their third men\u2019s final. England rather surprisingly won the 2010 edition but were beaten by West Indies in the 2016 final. Pakistan were triumphant in 2009 having lost the 2007 final to India. It\u2019s also a repeat of the 1992 50-over World Cup final, also played at the MCG, when Imran Khan led Pakistan to a famous victory over Graham Gooch\u2019s England. Who will win it this time? It\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess. Both teams have improved as the tournament has gone on, both have serious firepower in their batting order and some of the world\u2019s best T20 seamers at their disposal. The seven-match T20 series between the sides earlier this year finished 4-3 to England. Buttler\u2019s side are narrow favourites but it really could go either way. How is the weather looking? Not good. There\u2019s a 95% chance of rain in Melbourne on Sunday and the chance of severe thunderstorms. There is a reserve day on Monday but the forecast isn\u2019t much better. And if it\u2019s washed out? If they can\u2019t squeeze in the minimum 10-overs-a-side game at any point then the teams will share the trophy."

                    "body": "Brazilian football fans have excoriated Roy Keane after the former Manchester United star derided the country\u2019s national team players\u2019 dance moves during their World Cup last-16 victory over South Korea.\nBrazil\u2019s players repeatedly shook their stuff during Tuesday\u2019s 4-1 win with the coach, Tite, even joining in after Richarlison scored the third goal, cavorting like a pigeon in reference to the Tottenham striker\u2019s nickname.\nYet Keane took exception to the continuous dancing after Brazil\u2019s goals. \u201cI don\u2019t mind the first kind of little jig \u2013 whatever they\u2019re doing \u2013 but they\u2019re still doing it after that, and then the manager getting involved with it,\u201d the Irish commentator grumbled on ITV. \u201cI\u2019m not happy with it, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very good at all.\u201d\n\nIn Brazil those comments went down like a 7-1 defeat by Germany and transformed Keane into an immediate hate figure for dance-loving football fanatics. \u201cBrazilian football is the embodiment of happiness. Roy Keane be damned,\u201d wrote the sports columnist Julio Gomes, one of many citizens who took exception to the former Ireland midfielder\u2019s remarks.\n\nIn an article for the website UOL Esporte, Gomes said Keane\u2019s attack was merely the latest example of arrogant and clueless Europeans getting their knickers in a twist over the delight of others. \u201cThey think they are the best at everything and have the right to judge anyone,\u201d Gomes said. \u201cThey think they are the masters of what is right and what\u2019s wrong, and that the entire world must follow their behavioural manual.\n\u201cBrazilian footballers like to dance when they score. Full stop. Respect it and deal with it. It\u2019s hard to explain an authentic demonstration of happiness to someone who doesn\u2019t know how to express happiness.\u201d\nOthers offered even blunter critiques and wondered how the man behind the vicious tackle on Alf Inge Haaland in 2001 thought he was in position to lecture others on disrespect. \u201cI think Roy Keane \u2026 should get fucked,\u201d the screenwriter Antonio Tabet told his 3.1 million Twitter followers, before adding: \u201cIreland\u2019s Roy Keane complaining about goal celebrations at a World Cup is like Ronaldinho disapproving of bobsledding at the Winter Olympics.\u201d\n\nThere was criticism from the world of football too. Lu\u00eds Castro, the Portuguese coach of Rio de Janeiro side Botafogo, told the Brazilian channel SportTV: \u201cRoy Keane doesn\u2019t understand Brazilian football culture. He doesn\u2019t understand the Brazilian team.\n\u201cWe all know that [the dance] isn\u2019t disrespectful to anyone \u2026 it just shows real unity between the coach and the players. The world of football shouldn\u2019t worry about this because we\u2019ve become accustomed to Roy Keane\u2019s inelegant and sometimes very arrogant statements.\u201d\nOne of the Brazil players, Lucas Paquet\u00e1, denied his team\u2019s dancing was designed to offend opponents. \u201cWe\u2019re celebrating because it\u2019s our moment. We scored a goal and Brazil is celebrating,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he [Keane] doesn\u2019t like it, there\u2019s not a lot I can do for him. If we score another goal, we\u2019ll carry on celebrating like this.\nTite told reporters his players were always likely to face disapproval from \u201cill-disposed\u201d critics but defended their right to boogie. \u201cIt\u2019s a show of joy,\u201d the coach said."

India and Pakistan may have surpassed this rivalry for freneticism, ferocity, and sheer population, as shown by the crowd of more than 90,000 that sold out the Melbourne Cricket Ground for their own group stage bout. England and Australia won\u2019t get quite that many through the gates, but their rivalry will always be cricket\u2019s original.  The game is now even spicier, though, by effectively becoming an early knockout for both teams. Australia\u2019s loss to New Zealand can\u2019t strictly be classed as an upset \u2013 the Kiwis have made the finals of the last two 50-over World Cups, the last T20 World Cup, and are current holders of the World Test Championship. But even these consistently successful New Zealanders have still been consistently poor when meeting Australia, so a barnstorming win on these shores was a surprise.   A more genuine upset was Ireland downing England at the MCG on Wednesday afternoon. The Irish win in Bengaluru during the 2011 World Cup may be the stuff of legend, but it remains one of only two times they have beaten England in 50-over cricket, and this was the first instance in T20s. While batting, they bossed proceedings for half the innings and then let the ascendancy slip. While bowling, they bossed proceedings for half the innings and then had rain arrive before England got back on top. There was fortune in the manner of the win but it was set up by quality play.  All of which means that England and Australia have each banked one win, one loss, and cannot afford to lose another, with only two teams able to qualify for the semi-finals and New Zealand already having a mortgage on one spot. Assuming that those three teams can take care of their various assignments against Afghanistan, Ireland and Sri Lanka \u2013 an assumption that recent results has shown should have a caveat \u2013 an England loss to Australia would see them knocked out. An Australian loss would leave them needing England to lose to New Zealand, in order to tussle with England on net run rate.  It\u2019s not where either side would have expected to be only a few days ago, comfortably placed as the big dogs in their group. But neither has produced a convincing performance so far. The Australians were entirely out of sorts against New Zealand, ambushed by Finn Allen\u2019s opening batting and never recovering from there. Their huge run chase was off the rails before it started. Against Sri Lanka, some good individual performances still felt against the odds in a team that looked like it might be beaten at several points during the encounter.  England meanwhile stumbled to an opening win against Afghanistan while chasing a minor-league 112, and similarly got jumped by Ireland\u2019s bowlers at the top of the innings in Melbourne. A position of 29-3 in the sixth over was what slowed England\u2019s progress so markedly that they were still five runs short of the rain adjustment target when the match was abandoned in the 15th over. Earlier, their bowlers had been taken down by Ireland\u2019s top order to the tune of 92-1 after 10 overs, despite losing the power of Paul Stirling early.   In which case, Australia and England in their current state is not exactly a battle of the titans, but a struggle between teams looking to emerge from difficulty. That can of course happen in a few good minutes of T20 cricket, where one performance can start a team clicking. Mark Wood has been exciting for England, taking regular wickets while running in at his full sprint and bowling rapidly. Ben Stokes has offered little with the bat but has used the bounce in Australian pitches to contribute with the ball. Moeen Ali and Liam Livingstone have done some judicious hitting in the middle order. Australia meanwhile will be hoping to harness the momentum from Marcus Stoinis and Glenn Maxwell, after their pyrotechnics righted that listing innings against Sri Lanka. Josh Hazlewood has had a wonderful couple of bowling years in the format, Mitchell Starc has looked comfortable at first change, and Adam Zampa may well have recovered from illness. Both sides have reason for optimism, but for one of them, it will only last until Friday."

                    "body": "Football, once Brazil\u2019s great unifier, has in recent years fallen victim to the country\u2019s polarised politics. The yellow and green football shirt, emblematic of a national team that has won a record five World Cups, is now shunned by many Brazilians who associate it with the outgoing far-right president Jair Bolsonaro and his authoritarian brand of nationalism. \u201cI used to feel proud of wearing the Brazilian football shirt. Not any more. Now I feel dread,\u201d said Regina Valadares, a copywriter from the southern city of Florian\u00f3polis. The shirt evokes \u201cshame\u201d and \u201cdisgust\u201d for the 43-year-old as \u201cit represents everything bad about this government.\u201d Now however, Brazilians distressed by such associations hope that the World Cup, coming hard on the heels of Bolsonaro\u2019s electoral defeat to Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva last month, will provide an opportunity to reclaim the colours and reconcile the country with the amarelinha, as the world-famous shirt is affectionately known.  \u201cThere is a struggle over the shirt, which fits into a bigger struggle, a fight for Brazil and its national symbols,\u201d said Luiz Antonio Simas, a historian and author of a book about Rio de Janeiro\u2019s Maracan\u00e3 stadium. Left-leaning pop stars and politicians wore the canary yellow shirt during the election campaign in an attempt to recover it from the far right. More recently, the Brazilian Football Association (CBF) launched a campaign that seeks to depoliticise the football jersey. Amauri Bevilacqua, 29, said he will wear the amarelinha when Brazil plays in the World Cup. To do otherwise would be \u201cto let the other side take possession of a symbol that has always united all Brazilians, which is football\u201d. But the Rio-based environmental engineer does not yet feel comfortable wearing the shirt outside of match days, for fear of being mistaken for a Bolsonaro supporter. The broad appropriation of Brazil\u2019s national colours by the right began in 2015 during protests against the government of Lula\u2019s ally Dilma Rousseff, and have since become symbols of bolsonarismo.  More recently, the colours\u2019 political overtones have been reinforced by radical Bolsonaro supporters who reject the election results and have blocked roads and camped outside army headquarters demanding a military intervention. To avoid confusion progressive Brazilians are embracing alternative versions of the amarelinha such as those sold by Thain\u00e1 Pinho, a 27-year-old business graduate from Rio\u2019s working-class suburbs. Her line of yellow and green T-shirts, modelled on the retro version of the football jersey first worn by the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o in 1954, features progressive symbols like the red star of Lula\u2019s Workers\u2019 party or the LGBTQ+ flag. \u201cI hope that during the World Cup, everyone unites and wears the shirt, whether with a red star or not,\u201d said Pinho, who sees her Revolta Can\u00e1ria brand as part of a movement of resistance against the far right\u2019s appropriation of Brazil\u2019s national symbols.  Lula himself has urged Brazilians to embrace the tarnished colours. \u201cWe do not need to feel ashamed of wearing the green and yellow shirt. The shirt does not belong to a political party, it belongs to the Brazilian people,\u201d the president-elect recently tweeted, adding that during the World Cup he would wear a yellow shirt emblazoned with the number 13 \u2013 his Workers\u2019 party\u2019s electoral number. But this process of reappropriating Brazil\u2019s national symbols from the far right will not happen overnight, warned Simas. \u201cEven with Bolsonaro\u2019s defeat, lots of people who do not identify with this bolsonarista far right do not feel comfortable using the national team\u2019s shirt again,\u201d he said, adding that he was leaning towards wearing Brazil\u2019s blue away shirt during the World Cup games. Football-mad Bevilacqua clings on to a more optimistic view. He hopes Brazil will win its sixth World Cup and that a sporting victory might go some way towards healing the country\u2019s divisions. Brazil is the bookies\u2019 favourite to win this year\u2019s tournament, a title it last secured in 2002 \u2013 the year Lula won his first presidential election. \u201cIt\u2019s a good sign,\u201d said Bevilacqua. \u201cMaybe 20 years later, history will repeat itself.\u201d"

                    "body": "Ivan Toney has been rewarded for his excellent Brentford form with a first call-up to Gareth Southgate\u2019s England squad. The centre-forward is the newest face in a selection that also includes Eric Dier, who is picked for the first time since March 2021.\nEngland will play Nations League ties against Italy in Milan on 23 September and Germany at Wembley three days later. They have started their campaign poorly with two defeats and two draws but the competition for World Cup places adds an extra level of jeopardy for those involved. In particular the inclusion of Toney, whose five top-flight goals this season include a hat-trick against Leeds this month, changes the complexion of the battle to travel as Harry Kane\u2019s understudy.\nTammy Abraham, who keeps his place in a 28-strong squad, was subdued when given his chance in the home draw with Italy three months ago while Dominic Calvert-Lewin is injured and Ollie Watkins has faded from the picture. It means Toney, who scored 12 times in his first Premier League campaign last season, can stake a strong claim for Qatar 2022 if he impresses in the next fortnight.\n\u201cWe have been tracking him for a long time,\u201d Southgate said of Toney. \u201cI had a good chat with Thomas Frank about him last season. His form and his qualities \u2013 not only his goalscoring but his technical ability, buildup play and aerial prowess \u2013 give us a different threat to some of the other players we could pick.\u201d\nToney\u2019s rise should bring good news for Peterborough, his former club. They are in line for a \u00a31m payment from Brentford, who bought him in 2020 when in the Championship, if he makes his England debut. That would take the value of the deal between the two clubs to about \u00a38m.\n\nAnother forward, Marcus Rashford, has had his hopes of a recall ended by a muscle injury. He faces a race against time to win back a place in the affections of Southgate, who left him out last season; his Manchester United teammate Jadon Sancho also misses out despite an improvement in form. Southgate was at pains to say Rashford has shown \u201cencouraging signs\u201d recently and offered hope of a comeback if the trend continues.\nDier\u2019s return comes after a run of impressive performances for Spurs under Antonio Conte. Southgate had explained in May that the centre-back\u2019s qualities were already known and he wished to explore younger alternatives. \u201cHe has been playing well for a period of time,\u201d Southgate said.\n\u201cWe think it is a really close call across our centre-backs and he has deserved to be picked back in the group. We know what a good character he is. He fits in with the culture and has great international experience and leadership qualities.\u201d\nFikayo Tomori and Marc Guehi keep their places in the squad while Ben White misses out. Jordan Henderson\u2019s hamstring injury rules the Liverpool player out of a potential return in midfield. James Justin and Conor Gallagher, who have endured mixed starts to the season, are dropped but the fit-again left-backs Luke Shaw and Ben Chilwell return. Trent Alexander-Arnold, who was released early from the June fixtures after an extended season with Liverpool, also makes the cut.\nSouthgate admitted it was a concern that players such as Shaw, Chilwell, Harry Maguire and Kalvin Phillips have been short of competitive action for their clubs. \u201cIt is not ideal, he said. \u201cBut we feel they have been, and can be, important players for us. It is not a perfect situation but there is still a lot of football to be played before Qatar.\u201d\nDean Henderson, who won his sole cap in November 2020, is the beneficiary of Jordan Pickford\u2019s injury. The Nottingham Forest keeper, on loan from Manchester United, joins Aaron Ramsdale and Nick Pope in contention for the No 1 jersey."

                    "body": "James Maddison reached down to touch the white line before pointing his index fingers skyward and tilting his gaze in the same direction. It was a moment in time for the Leicester playmaker, one he feared might not come \u2013 his entrance into England\u2019s opening World Cup training session in Qatar \u2013 and he wanted to savour it.\nThen again, there have been quite a few like that of late, beginning with his call-up into the squad by Gareth Southgate last Thursday \u2013 a shock after three years out of the picture \u2013 and rolling into him being selected as the player for England\u2019s welcome media conference here.\n\n\u201cEvery one at the minute is almost like a pinch-me moment,\u201d Maddison says, all easy confidence and warmth. \u201cIt\u2019s surreal.\u201d\nMaddison finds himself as a spokesman of sorts for the squad despite his inexperience and absolutely because of his self\u2011assurance and star quality, taking questions on pretty much everything including England\u2019s chances of glory. After reaching the semi-finals of the last World Cup and the final at Euro 2020, he feels they are poised to make the decisive step. \u201cYou have to go into a tournament like this with the belief you can win it,\u201d he says.\n\u201cIf you have any sort of doubt then you probably will come across a hiccup along the way. Our belief is fully there, we are invested. Hopefully we can go that one step further.\u201d\nReally, though, it was impossible to ignore the drama of Maddison\u2019s personal story; how he nipped in at the very last to Southgate\u2019s travelling party after presenting an irresistible case with his club form over the calendar year. He says he had never given up hope of playing for England again, even when he thought he deserved a chance previously only to be overlooked, but there was no doubt that a part of him was ready for disappointment.\n\n\u201cI was kind of braced for both,\u201d Maddison says. \u201cI think it was the saying of hoping for the best but preparing for the worst. I hadn\u2019t been in a squad for three years and I\u2019m not naive. I understand how it works. But I also had that hope.\u201d\nMaddison had been in the office of the Leicester manager, Brendan Rodgers, last Thursday morning and he had not heard anything from Southgate. \u201cHe [Rodgers] was just being a good man\u2011manager and putting his arm around me if I didn\u2019t get the call, and how to stay motivated for the game at West Ham on Saturday and how to enjoy the break.\u201d\nThen Maddison went into the changing room and saw that he had missed a call from Southgate, who had not selected him since the fixtures in November 2019 \u2013 when he gave him his debut and only cap as a 56th-minute substitute against Montenegro.\n\u201cSo the heart starts beating,\u201d Maddison says. \u201cI had his number saved still! I called him back, he gave me the good news and it was all a bit of a blur. I couldn\u2019t tell you what Gareth said. After the call finished, it was a bit of a head\u2011on\u2011the-wall moment, a big deep breath and a call to my parents.\n\u201cMy dad actually cried and he is not a crier. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen him cry for years. I had dinner that night at home in Coventry with my mum and dad \u2013 and my little boy and my partner. I wanted to see my parents. It\u2019s a moment I will cherish forever.\u201d\nMaddison uploaded a photograph to social media of himself as a kid in an England shirt, his face painted with a St George\u2019s cross. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t sunk in,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI\u2019m going to the World Cup. Dreams really do come true.\u201d\n\nHas it sunk in now? It remains unclear. Maddison was asked about his cropped haircut in the picture and whether it was a tribute to David Beckham, whose free-kick prowess and ability to deliver at the big moments he has tried to emulate.\n\u201cFirstly, I\u2019m not sure I had the Beckham hair shave,\u201d he says. \u201cThe barbers were quite expensive and mum and dad probably couldn\u2019t afford it. My mum used to get the clippers out every couple of weeks and it was No 2 all over!\u201d\nMaddison was deadly serious about his intention to seize any opportunity that comes his way at the World Cup, even if it is only a single one. He is not expected to start as Southgate looks ahead to England\u2019s first game against Iran on Monday. But even if he comes off the bench in the 89th minute, Maddison will be ready to create memories, to sprinkle his magic.\n\n\u201cBeckham and set-pieces,\u201d Maddison says. \u201cHow many times have we watched that free-kick against Greece that sent us to a major tournament? They are the moments you literally dream of. Big moments in tournaments are the ones that get replayed for years and years so to get one would be absolutely unbelievable. That would be the real pinnacle.\u201d\nMaddison, who still considers himself to be the \u201clittle boy who is kicking a ball around in his garden with the face paint on\u201d, wanted to put something to bed: the fallout from his visit to a casino in October 2019. Maddison had withdrawn from the England squad citing illness and was then pictured playing poker as his teammates slumped to defeat against the Czech Republic in Prague.\nThe point that is often overlooked, he says, is that Southgate called him up for the next England squad and gave him his debut. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a big deal for Gareth at the time,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was never a concern, it was more outside noise.\u201d\n\nThere is sure to be plenty more of that in the coming weeks but Maddison wanted to focus on what he can influence, including his recovery from the slight knee problem which forced him off against West Ham.\nHe emerged to train with all 25 of his teammates at 4.30pm local time, the call to prayer reverberating shortly afterwards to provide an atmospheric backdrop. Kyle Walker was out there as he worked his way back from groin surgery and it was pushing 30C \u2013 another challenge England must overcome. The match against Iran is a 4pm kick-off.\n\u201cThe mood is brilliant,\u201d Maddison says. \u201cWe have got an absolutely fantastic hotel and the setup is second to none. It\u2019s the finer things like going into my room and seeing there are pictures of my boy, my family and my mum and dad. There is a lot of excitement and we cannot wait to get going.\u201d"

                    "body": "Having beaten Canada 4-1 the Croatia coach, Zlatko Dalic, and the forward Andrej Kramaric made clear that they were unimpressed by John Herdman\u2019s comments before the game and the fact he walked off without shaking the hand of his opposite number.\nAfter Canada\u2019s first game at the 2022 World Cup, an unfortunate 1-0 defeat against Belgium, an emotional Herdman said of his team in a TV interview: \u201cI told them they belong here. And we\u2019re going to go and \u2018eff\u2019 Croatia.\u201d\n\nHaving scored two goals on Sunday to confirm Canada\u2019s elimination at the group stage, Kramaric referenced Herdman\u2019s now-infamous comment. \u201cI\u2019d like to thank the Canada manager for motivation. In the end, Croatia showed who \u2018effed\u2019 who.\u201d\nDalic had repeatedly decried his counterpart\u2019s lack of respect in the run-up to the match on Sunday. It also became a central talking point back in Zagreb, where the country\u2019s 24 Sata tabloid ran a front-page photo of a naked Herdman with Canadian flags over his mouth and groin region and a headline that read: \u201cYou have the mouth, but do you have the [balls] as well?\u201d\nOn Sunday night, after Kramaric\u2019s double and strikes from Marko Livaja and Lovro Majer followed an early opener from Alphonso Davies, Dalic said: \u201cI did not see the other head coach after the match. Whether I lose or win I always congratulate the winner.\u201d\n\u201cHe [Herdman] was not there and that\u2019s his way of doing things,\u201d Dalic added. \u201cHe\u2019s obviously mad. He\u2019s a good coach, he is a high-quality professional, but it will take some time for him to learn some things.\u201d\n\nAlready a national hero after guiding Canada\u2019s women\u2019s national team to back-to-back bronze medals at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics, Herdman has elevated his profile even further by lifting the men\u2019s side back into the World Cup for the first time since 1986.\nBut the 47-year-old manager from Consett in County Durham admitted on Sunday that he may have spoken recklessly. \u201cI could have been a little bit more composed coming out of the huddle, but that\u2019s my learning,\u201d Herdman said.\n\u201cI\u2019ll take that on the chin. But from a mindset point of view, I think we showed in that first 25 minutes, that little old Canada can compete with the best in the world.\u201d"

                    "body": "You cannot confiscate a voice. Iran\u2019s was heard powerfully on an emotional afternoon on the outskirts of Doha that ended with tears in the stands, tears on the pitch and Wales supporters applauding those responsible for likely ending a World Cup journey 64 years in the making.\nThere were tears at the start too, and it was initially impossible to concentrate on a must-win game for both teams after seeing Iranian women and men left distraught by their national anthem. Before Monday\u2019s game against England the Iran players had stayed silent during the anthem, delivering a potent protest with potentially far greater consequences than a possible yellow card for an armband. Here some stayed silent again, a few sang and the majority mumbled their way through; a choir of the damned if they do, damned if they don\u2019t.\nAround them, however, the sound was unmistakable and intensely moving. Boos and whistles rained down from Iran supporters sending their message to the government of the Islamic republic.\n\nOne fan held aloft an Iran football shirt with \u2018Mahsa Amini \u2013 22\u2019 on the back, the name and age of the woman whose death in police custody sparked the mass protest movement in the country. The fan had blood-stained tears drawn on to her face and was soon confronted by stadium security, who confiscated the shirt.\n\nQatar\u2019s orders, or Fifa\u2019s? Every flag brought to the perimeter of the stadium was inspected by security before being allowed inside. Any that carried messages of support for the protest movement were confiscated. An American-Iranian fan claimed her flag had been taken for having the word \u201cwomen\u201d on it.\nThere were sinister scenes outside the stadium where women giving interviews to foreign media about the protests were harassed by a small group of male pro-government fans. Some filmed the women on their phones and chanted \u201cThe Islamic Republic of Iran\u201d. They also shouted insults at anyone displaying the protest slogan \u201cWomen, Life, Freedom\u201d.\nWhat was going through the mind of Iran\u2019s players as they lined up to perform on a World Cup stage to the sound of boos and whistles, not only seeking to redress the 6-2 humiliation against England as part of their day job but suddenly expected to form a sporting protest movement, complete with answers, to a repressive regime prepared to shoot its people?\nThey have been threatened with dire retribution for Monday\u2019s silence by politicians back home. On the eve of the Wales game they heard one of the most famous footballers in Iran, Voria Ghafouri, had been arrested by security forces who accused him of spreading propaganda against the regime. One group of fans wore hats with Ghafouri\u2019s name. It is hardly surprising that Carlos Queiroz, Iran\u2019s head coach, snapped at a BBC journalist who asked on the eve of this game whether the striker Mehdi Taremi had a message for those who have taken to the streets.\n\nIran\u2019s footballers answered with a powerful show of defiance of their own. A richly deserved win over Robert Page\u2019s subdued team, with Gareth Bale, Aaron Ramsey and Joe Allen showing their age and rustiness at the worst possible moment, was one of supreme character and consummate professionalism given the circumstances.\nSardar Azmoun, Iran\u2019s biggest attacking hope, started for the first time since injuring a calf in October. The Bayer Leverkusen forward ran himself into the ground while spreading panic throughout the Wales defence, although his lack of sharpness told when passing to an offside Ali Gholizadeh with the goal at his mercy. He also struck a post when clean through before hobbling off to a standing ovation in the 68th minute after several visits from the physio.\nIran had to call on the reserve goalkeeper Hossein Hosseini with their first choice, Ali Beiranvand, sidelined by concussion protocols. Hosseini brought authority to a defence that toiled against English crosses but dominated a Wales attack featuring the towering Keiffer Moore.\n\nBoth Iran goals were taken superbly after the deserved dismissal of Wayne Hennessey for evoking the World Cup spirit of Harald Schumacher and clattering into Taremi. Taremi\u2019s message to the people of Iran was that their football team would give everything to remain in the World Cup. Queiroz was not intending to introduce Roozbeh Cheshmi until Ahmad Noorollahi\u2019s injury prompted the former Manchester United coach to scan the options and order the defensive midfielder to strip off. The substitute, capitalising on Allen\u2019s poor clearance, swept a superb finish into the bottom corner to prompt a mass pitch-invasion from the Iran bench.\nRamin Rezaeian capped an outstanding display at right-back with a delicate dink over Danny Ward and Ben Davies to seal victory, prompting Azmoun to throttle Queiroz during the joyous outpouring. A member of Queiroz\u2019s backroom team could not contain the tears afterwards, wiping his face with his shirt as Iran\u2019s players embarked on a richly deserved lap of honour that drew warm, sporting applause from Wales supporters baking in the early afternoon sun.\nAs darkness fell on Doha, the stadium was illuminated in Iran colours. \u201cThis game was a gift to Iranian fans north, south, east and west,\u201d Queiroz said. \u201cThis was a gift to all of them.\u201d Their fans were united in unquestioned support of a team to be proud of. Away from the game, sadly, it is a very different matter."

                    "body": "For decade upon decade, Australian selectors have leant to the conventional. Three quicks and a spinner, your best bat is captain, wicketkeeper at seven in Test cricket or pushed up to throw the bat as an opener in the shorter forms. Occasionally circumstances or an unusual player might shift this around, but it tends to quickly revert to the mean.  Having George Bailey in charge has led to an occasional willingness to be different. His days as a player and captain showed that, and those days are recent enough that he personally knows the strengths of most current players. It was Bailey\u2019s plan to have Scott Boland play in last year\u2019s MCG Ashes Test, a masterstroke as Boland hoovered up wickets at an 1880s bowling average over the next three matches. There has been talk of picking batters for next year\u2019s India tour based on strength against spin rather than incumbency, in a departure from failed orthodoxy. It has indeed been an unusual combination of circumstance and player that led to fast bowler Pat Cummins taking charge of the Test and one-day teams, but that would not likely have happened with a traditionalist chairing the selection meetings.  Still, for the T20 World Cup about to start, Bailey doesn\u2019t have to do much other than press copy and paste from last year\u2019s corresponding tournament. He can do so in the confidence that home conditions should, in theory, suit them and their style of play far better than the surfaces of the Arabian Gulf, where Australia\u2019s quick bowlers went against orthodoxy and odds to take the tournament.  Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood took 25 of the 41 wickets to fall to Australia on UAE pitches that ranged from slow to flat. This year their group stage will form a tour of the major capitals: Sydney, Perth, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide. Australian surfaces for 20-over cricket will not be fast bowling paradises, especially given the amount of recent rain in most of those cities and the early season timing, but there should still be more assistance with bounce and pace than in other parts of the world.  Adam Zampa is a lock as the primary spinner, after his 13 wickets at an average of 12 in last year\u2019s tournament. The leg-spinner will have left-arm orthodox Ashton Agar as his understudy, but they are unlikely to play together. The four overs of the fifth bowler will be pieced together from all-rounders up the order.   The batting will begin as it has for years: David Warner and Aaron Finch. Warner is Australia\u2019s original T20 champion and still has a claim to being the best. This is the player whose Test career starting in 2011 was made possible by his national T20 career starting in 2009, before he had even played first-class cricket for New South Wales. He was in the first edition of the Indian Premier League and has kept showing up since. He may be going to turn 36 in a week, but his lobbying to have his captaincy ban lifted suggests that he wants to lead this side and keep going. He scored the second-most runs in last year\u2019s T20 World Cup at a strike rate of just under 150. This year he\u2019s averaging nearly 50 and striking at 156. Finch has more of a tendency to be patchy, but also a track record of coming good in big tournaments. A couple of fifties in his last half dozen starts will have partly calmed any nerves. Mitchell Marsh will bat at three, where he dominated last year\u2019s final and literally became the poster boy for this year\u2019s tournament with his jumbo-jet celebration.  Then comes Bailey\u2019s only major decision: whether to leave out Steve Smith, a diminishing force in 20-over cricket but still one with the cleverness and skill to solve tricky situations. All-rounders Glenn Maxwell and Marcus Stoinis offer more power at positions four and five, with Tim David likely to bat at six in the difficult finisher\u2019s position that he has made his own in domestic leagues around the world. Matthew Wade at seven will be his ideal foil. In the 12 months since the last World Cup began, Wade has been not out 10 times out of 15, averaging nearly 70 at a strike rate of 153.   It is a quality XI that can challenge any team in the competition. A late shake-up could come with reserve bat and keeper Josh Inglis being ruled out with injury, following of all things a freak golfing accident. That could let all-rounder Cameron Green into the squad, who impressed with his powerful hitting at the top of the order on Australia\u2019s recent tour to India, and who offers another bowling option besides Marsh, Maxwell and Stoinis. It\u2019s unlikely that he could push any of the aforementioned 11 players out of the first match, but he could if someone has a poor run of games. Of course, the real question is how many matches will happen at all. This is a La Ni\u00f1a year, after all, and rain has been deluging much of the country. Australia and New Zealand in Sydney this Saturday is a good chance to fall victim, as is the sold-out India versus Pakistan game in Melbourne the following day. Meanwhile, three kilometres across Melbourne\u2019s CBD, a perfectly good stadium with a roof on it will be sitting dry and empty, amplifying the meditative sound of drops drumming on the overhead tin. It seems that Australian chair of selectors is not the only position in cricket that could use a creative decision-maker."

Became consistently good in the 90s, have never won the big prize but are on the up, implausibly imploded in a recent big game (see Kansas City 2022 and Couva 2017), have a blue-collar ethic, a few outstanding individuals (although the Bills have a much better chance of a championship in the coming months) and a late-fortysomething coach with more hair on his chin than his head. Also known for playing in snow and ice. TD The US\u2019s biggest strength is ... The midfield. Beyond the presumptive starting trio of Weston McKennie (Juventus), Tyler Adams (Leeds) and Yunus Musah (Valencia), there\u2019s a surplus of energetic, talented youngsters including Gio Reyna (Borussia Dortmund), Brenden Aaronson (Leeds) and Luca de la Torre (Celta de Vigo). BAG The wingers. There\u2019s no questioning the quality of a midfield composed of Adams, Musah and McKennie, but the US\u2019s real power is on the flanks, with Timothy Weah, Aaronson and Christian Pulisic a blur of running, close control, and invention. There\u2019ll be chances enough. The question is: who will finish them off? AT Attack. Pulisic has proved himself to everyone but a few coaches and fans at Chelsea. Weah, McKennie and Reyna have uncommon vision. Josh Sargent is on a hot streak, as is Haji Wright. Jesus Ferreira is a dangerous poacher. Aaronson is acquitting himself nicely at Leeds. As with the overachieving 2002 World Cup team, a lot of these players are young and eager to prove themselves. BD  An abundance of zippy, tricky, wingers and attacking midfielders \u2013 and full backs Antonee Robinson and Sergi\u00f1o Dest are also attacking assets. This side could swarm opponents \u2013 if they\u2019re good enough to build sustained periods of possession in dangerous areas. Pretty big if. TD The US\u2019s biggest weakness is ... The lack of a goal-scoring central striker. In the end Ferreira, Sargent and Wright edged out Jordan Pefok and Ricardo Pepi, but none of them has managed to establish himself as a reliable No 9 during Berhalter\u2019s tenure. Ferreira, the likely starter against Wales, scores in bunches for FC Dallas but far less so for his country: four of his seven international goals came in a Concacaf Nations League rout of Grenada this summer. BAG The US. The eternal frustration of US soccer: America can throw its weight around on the world stage as it pleases, but this easy power finds no translation on the football field. Too often American teams, emerging triumphant from qualification in a mediocre confederation, arrive at World Cups high on their own supply, with none of the agility and rat cunning needed to succeed on the highest stage as a small footballing nation with no real superstars. AT Defense. Recalling long-serving Fulham center back Tim Ream smacks of \u2013 well, not desperation, but the recognition of a need. The outside backs are erratic and more interested in attacking. And for the first time in generations, the US lacks a top-class, meme-worthy goalkeeper like Brad Friedel, Kasey Keller or Tim Howard. BD Scoring against non-Concacaf opponents. Going back to 2020, the US have played nations from outside their region eight times and been shut out on four occasions \u2013 including the past three, which featured a combined five shots on target. It\u2019s not a promising sign for a team who lack a top-quality striker and often underwhelm on the road. TD Key player ...  Christian Pulisic. No need to overthink it. As arguably the United States\u2019 only world-class player, the team will go as far as he takes them. BAG Walker Zimmerman. Most will pick Pulisic but the way Gregg Berhalter sets his team up means that defence, as the cliche has it, is the first line of attack. The fate of the US press lies with the defenders, and Zimmerman above all. AT Christian Pulisic is perhaps too obvious a choice here, but he will obviously be the key to the US attack and will obviously draw extra attention from opposing defenders. Obviously. BD In a brief and intense tournament it might not be who you\u2019d expect (ie, Musah). Chances are that at some point the US will need a rescue act, a momentum shifter, a magician who can conjure a great goal from nowhere. And though his health issues may limit him to a role off the bench, Gio Reyna may just be that difference-maker. TD Unheralded player to watch ... Yunus Musah. The probable midfield starter alongside McKennie and Adams is the least known of the three, but his ability to dribble out of pressure, carry the ball into the final third and create attacking chances for his teammates will prove vital. BAG Tim Ream, partly because his ponytail and beard make him easy to spot (at a World Cup, aesthetics matter), but also because he\u2019s been in quietly efficient form for Fulham and could finally be the defensive foil to Zimmerman that Berhalter has spent years searching for. AT Christian Pulisic. Seriously. He\u2019s tied for the lead at Chelsea with 0.43 non-penalty goals-plus-assists per 90 minutes in Premier League play. He\u2019s second on the team in key passes per 90 minutes in all competitions. Basically, he\u2019s one of Chelsea\u2019s best playmakers, and yet he\u2019s often stuck on the bench and ridiculed by the club\u2019s fans as if it\u2019s somehow his fault they\u2019re in eighth place. BD Walker Zimmerman was very solid in Concacaf play but so much attention has been paid to the vexed question of who\u2019ll partner the Nashville man at center back that few have stopped to wonder how the 29-year-old MLS lifer will fare against the likes of Harry Kane, Kieffer Moore and Mehdi Taremi. Which seems pertinent. TD Gregg Berhalter is \u2026 Someone who will forever be remembered by American fans as the player whose left foot nearly sent the US into the semi-finals back in 2002. Twenty years later, he\u2019s at the helm of another US team looking to punch above their weight. BAG An innovative coach who unfortunately only has one innovation \u2013 a high, hard press. If the press fails, so does the team: American fans will be hoping Berhalter has no cause to call on his Plan B, because on the evidence so far, it doesn\u2019t exist. AT A bit unfairly accused of benefiting from nepotism because his brother Jay was an unpopular executive with the US Soccer Federation. He earned his place. That said, he\u2019s not really the inspirational figure these talented young players need to fight through adversity, and his decision to omit goalkeeper Zack Steffen and goalscorer Ricardo Pepi from the World Cup roster is dubious. BD  A likable and ruminative details guy who\u2019s started to talk about the importance of luck. A careful planner who\u2019s called up five players who didn\u2019t feature in the qualifying campaign and who may come to rely on a defender he hasn\u2019t been picked for 14 months and a striker who\u2019s only played 119 minutes of senior international football. TD The World Cup winner will be \u2026 Brazil. The Sele\u00e7\u00e3o are 15 matches unbeaten with an embarrassment of attacking riches \u2013 including Neymar, Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior, Richarlison, Raphinha and Rodrygo \u2013 that will end the country\u2019s two-decade wait for a record sixth title. BAG Brazil, a team that seemed vaguely underrated at the last World Cup despite playing well and now has an irrepressible cast of attacking talent to reduce a historical dependence on Neymar. There\u2019s some weakness in defence but that only confirms this team\u2019s status as a canonical Selec\u00e3o: iffy at the back, irresistible up front. And who doesn\u2019t want to see that kind of Brazil team lift a World Cup? (Argentinians, probably.) AT England. We\u2019re talking about a cricket World Cup, aren\u2019t we? No? Oh, well, Still, England. They\u2019re due, and they have as much talent as anyone else. BD There\u2019s a strong statistical and sentimental case for Argentina. They haven\u2019t lost a game since July 2019, and what a way it would be for Lionel Messi to crown his career. The top European nations are flawed and Lionel Scaloni\u2019s men beat the favorites, Brazil, in last year\u2019s Copa America final. TD The US will get to \u2026 The last time England and the United States were drawn together at a World Cup, the Americans won the group. Sixty years earlier? USA 1-0 England. There\u2019s plenty of reason for hope in the US camp and enough talent to survive the only group in the field with all four teams ranked among Fifa\u2019s top 20. Which they will. But Senegal or the Netherlands in the last 16 will be a bridge too far. BAG The end of the group stage with a handful of points, some modest promotional opportunities in breakfast cereal and regional bank credit cards for Ream, Pulisic\u2019s status as a world class dribbler who can\u2019t score burnished, the usual platitudes in the media about American \u201ccourage\u201d and \u201cgrit\u201d, many rueful reflections on how Iran are \u201cpretty good, actually\u201d, and no progress to the round of 16. AT Funny thing \u2013 both the Fifa rankings and the Elo rankings have the US, Wales and Iran hovering around the same place. It\u2019s not so much the Group of Death as the Group of Questions. But Wales\u2019 best attacker has been outshined in MLS by the next generation of Western Hemisphere talent, and Iran barely beat Nicaragua at home in their last match. The US barge into the round of 16, then score an early goal against the Netherlands, only to lose 4-1. Did I mention the defense? BD The round of 16, where they\u2019ll exit to superior opponents \u2013 much like 2010 and 2014. It\u2019s simply too hard to see them overcoming the Netherlands or Senegal, their likely opponents in the first knockout stage. Given the team\u2019s lack of experience a win against Wales in the opener seems vital to bank points and breed belief. If that\u2019s achieved the US have an excellent chance to progress from Group B. TD "

                    "body": "There are plenty of reasons why Sam Simmonds will soon be ruling himself out of contention for England, having fought for so long to convince Eddie Jones he was worth another shot, but the No 8 has wanderlust. The financial benefits of a move to Montpellier next season are obvious, particularly at a time when the salary cap makes it harder for clubs to justify giving big contracts to England internationals. Simmonds has a young family and his determination to provide for them is a theme to which he frequently returns \u2013 even if his partner\u2019s mother took a while to come around to the idea of the move to the south of France. The demises of Wasps and Worcester only heighten the sense of uncertainty as to what the future holds.  Above all else, however, Simmonds wants to see the world. He describes himself as a Devon boy, and his family \u2013 his farmer and uncle are in the lobster and crab business \u2013 as \u201cTeignmouth born and bred\u201d. After much deliberation, consultation with Exeter\u2019s Rob Baxter and the England coach, Jones, and confirmation that he would still be eligible for next year\u2019s World Cup \u2013 he has two start dates with Montpellier depending on whether he is selected \u2013 Simmonds\u2019 mind was made up. \u201cMe and my brother [Joe] have been lucky enough to play for Exeter for 10 years,\u201d Simmonds tells the Observer. \u201cBut we never went to uni, we\u2019ve never really flown the nest. My family were surprised but they probably saw something like that coming in the next few years. Even if I was to sign for another Premiership club, it\u2019s still not Exeter, it\u2019s not Devon. \u201cI think they took it pretty well \u2013 my partner\u2019s mum not so much but she understands and she quickly got over it. They are hard decisions, it\u2019s not just me and my life out there. When you\u2019re off contract or coming off contract you\u2019re always weighing up options and things that you want to do because ultimately I\u2019ve got people who depend on me now: a wife-to-be [Emily] next May and a little girl [Billie] as well.\u201d  Simmonds has been back in the England fold for a year, earning a recall last autumn after Warren Gatland took him on the 2021 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to South Africa. The 27-year-old insists he never wallowed during his England exile; indeed, those three and half years between caps were some of his most enjoyable, such was Exeter\u2019s success and Simmonds\u2019 unerring ability to find the tryline. By his own admission, Simmonds was not ready for international rugby when his near-vertical ascent went from playing for Cornish Pirates in the Championship to making his England debut within the space of 12 months five years ago. The raw talent was abundantly clear but he has since matured as a player who no longer relies solely on his speed and as a person who now embraces mixing with international teammates brought together from different parts of the country. It probably helps that Jones no longer asks him how much he weighs at the start of each cap but Simmonds seems more at ease with the fact that while he and, say, Billy Vunipola are both ultimately trying to achieve the same goal, they will go about doing so in different ways. \u201cI probably didn\u2019t immerse myself into the whole environment then but I\u2019ve completely changed my outlook,\u201d he says. \u201cI was always very quick and explosive, I feel like I still have that off the mark explosiveness which is my point of difference. I think I\u2019ve added to my game, I\u2019ve got a bit bigger. I\u2019ve added things that I probably didn\u2019t have when I was coming through, I can punch up the middle a bit better rather than just being an out-wide ball carrier.\u201d Simmonds missed last summer\u2019s tour of Australia after deciding it was the right time to have surgery on a longstanding hip injury but before that he was England\u2019s starting No 8 by the end of the Six Nations. Still, there was relief when Jones picked him this season, suggesting that his move abroad would not be held against him. He is among the replacements for England\u2019s autumn opener against Argentina on Sunday and will be a valuable weapon in the latter stages. \u201cIt did feel good to be selected,\u201d says Simmonds. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t and couldn\u2019t have been annoyed if I had been left out because of my decision to leave England. But I don\u2019t think Eddie has a problem with that. I spoke to him in depth and said my focus is to still play for England. I know that after the World Cup I won\u2019t get the opportunity to do that again but I have come to terms with that and understood that. I was out of the loop for a long time previously so I know how it goes. I have been making a conscious effort to just take two seconds to just enjoy it all.\u201d  That goes for domestic level too. Although Simmonds does not leave Exeter until the end of the season, he expects his remaining time with Joe in the south-west to fly by. \u201c[Joe] was always in the loop but it\u2019s going to be tough not to play with him,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing playing with teammates and your best mates but it is different to be able to run on to the pitch as siblings. You just have so much more love and emotion, especially for big games, it just means more. [Our last game together] will be an emotional day for the Simmonds household. I doubt my dad will be able to come to the game because he\u2019ll be crying all day.\u201d"

                    "body": "Nottingham Forest have smashed their transfer record to sign Morgan Gibbs-White from Wolves in a deal that could reach \u00a342.5m, taking their summer spending to about \u00a3140m. Gibbs-White is Forest\u2019s 16th close-season signing as they continue to revamp their squad after promotion to the Premier League. Wolves rejected two previous bids from Forest for Gibbs-White but considered their third offer too good to turn down given the player is understood to have been reluctant to extend his contract beyond 2024. Forest will pay an initial \u00a325m for Gibbs-White, plus about \u00a310m in add-ons dependent on league appearances and if Forest avoid relegation. On top of that \u00a335m package, Forest would have to pay further add-ons if they were to record a top-half finish or qualify for Europe. Wolves have also inserted a 15% sell-on clause in the deal. The 22-year-old shone in the Championship last season on loan at Sheffield United, though coincidentally he missed the penalty that meant Forest reached the playoff final. The deal for Gibbs-White means Forest have twice broken their transfer record this window, previously paying \u00a317.5m to sign Taiwo Awoniyi, who scored his first goal in Sunday\u2019s victory over West Ham, from Union Berlin. Gibbs-White, who has made 15 Premier League starts, has been Steve Cooper\u2019s main attacking target all summer and the Forest manager will be relieved to land a player with whom he previously worked at Swansea and with England youth teams. Gibbs-White was part of the England Under-17s squad that won the World Cup under Cooper in 2017. After Forest\u2019s first top-flight win in 23 years against West Ham on Sunday, Cooper said the volume of signings was a \u201cnecessity\u201d given the turnover of players this summer. Five key loanees, including Djed Spence and James Garner, returned to their parent clubs, the former later joining Tottenham in a \u00a320m deal. The arrival of Gibbs-White means Forest are not pursuing Brighton\u2019s Neal Maupay despite making an offer for the striker last week. Wolves also broke their transfer record on Thursday to sign the Sporting Lisbon midfielder Matheus Nunes on a five-year contract in a \u00a338m deal. The 23-year-old has eight caps for Portugal and is expected to be part of their squad at the World Cup in Qatar. Bruno Lage is expected to target another striker despite the arrival of Gon\u00e7alo Guedes from Valencia and also has a full-back and centre-back on his list of priorities."

                    "body": "The opportunities came one after another. From distance and from close range. From corners, free kicks and open play. The fearless upstarts from Canada who have spent the past couple of years upending North American\u2019s football long-standing order had arrived on the global stage and were taking it to the world\u2019s No 2 team. All of them shone on Monday night, from the stars to the supporting cast. Stephen Eustaquio, Jonathan David, Tajon Buchanan, Alphonso Davies, Richie Laryea, Junior Hoilett, Alistair Johnston and the ageless captain Atiba Hutchinson, three months shy of his 40th birthday, made demands of Belgium\u2019s creaking backline and their world-class goalkeeper. Any one of them might have written themselves into history as Canada\u2019s first goalscorer at a men\u2019s World Cup. The uptempo attacking verve that had defined the Canadians\u2019 buzzsaw tear through Concacaf qualifying \u2013 and their first men\u2019s World Cup appearance in nearly four decades \u2013 produced no fewer than 10 shots in the first half hour. Each successive attempt sent Canada\u2019s pack of travelling fans, already in full throat from the team\u2019s first emergence to Drake\u2019s Started from the Bottom and a rousing singalong to Canada\u2019s national anthem, into a deafening wall of sound. Then, one minute from half-time, a dream start spiralled into a nightmare. From almost nothing Michy Batshuayi ran onto Toby Alderweireld\u2019s inch-perfect ball and clinically buried it into the far corner of the net, leaving a constellation of white shirts frozen in stunned silence. It was the Belgians\u2019 first solid chance of the game and, ultimately, all they needed to escape with three charmed points.  \u201cWe approached the game with the right mentality,\u201d said Hutchinson, the lone Canadian player who was alive the last time the country played in a men\u2019s World Cup. \u201cThere\u2019s six more points to play for. Everybody in our change room knows what we\u2019re capable of doing. It\u2019s just a game that didn\u2019t go our way today.\u201d  Canada\u2019s return to the sport\u2019s biggest event after a 36-year absence was never going to be easy. Drawn into a group with a pair of European giants fresh off runs to the last four in 2018 \u2013 a Belgian side in the winter of a golden generation and Croatia, runners-up four years ago \u2013 Les Rouges always faced an uphill climb to reach the knockout stage. But this one, a 1-0 defeat in a match they largely dominated, will sting. And not just because Davies, the 22-year-old Bayern Munich full-back and this swaggering group\u2019s undisputed star, was denied from the spot in the 10th minute after the unflappable Thibaut Courtois dived correctly to his right.  Teams simply don\u2019t play this well and lose very often. Canada became the first side to attempt at least 20 shots and one penalty in a game while failing to score since 1978. The advanced stats only added further context to the injustice: the Canadians\u2019 2.6 expected goals were the fourth-most in a World Cup loss since 1966. \u201cWe won due to our experience and the quality of our goalkeeper and a few other things,\u201d Belgium coach Roberto Martinez said. \u201cCanada was better than us, but in the end the win is more important than playing well. We did what we had to do. But we have to be realistic: against bigger teams, we would have lost this match.\u201d Canada are no closer to the country\u2019s first ever World Cup goal than when the night started, yet one can\u2019t help but marvel at how far they\u2019ve come. Eight years ago, Les Rouges were 122nd in the Fifa rankings \u2013 below the likes of Lesotho, Palestine and St Kitts \u2013 having been frozen out of the final round of Concacaf qualifying once again by an 8-1 bludgeoning at the hands of Honduras. They hadn\u2019t even come close to qualifying for the World Cup since their first and only appearance back in 1986, when they crashed out of the group stage with losses to France, Hungary and the USSR. But their prospects have shifted dramatically under John Herdman, their 47-year-old manager from Consett in County Durham, who was already a national hero after guiding Canada\u2019s women\u2019s team to back-to-back bronze medals at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics. Buoyed by a glut of young stars who have developed into major contributors at European clubs, among them Champions League winner Davies (Bayern Munich), David (Lille), Buchanan (Club Brugge) and Cyle Larin (Besiktas), they were 17 games unbeaten across three grueling rounds of Concacaf qualifying until the final window of games and finished clear of both Mexico and the United States at the top of the group. \u201cI\u2019m proud of the performance,\u201d an emotional Herdman said after the game. \u201cBut you need to take three points in your first game. We had an opportunity tonight to be top of the group, that was the mission, and we missed it. But these lads showed that they can live on this stage and I think they made the fans proud and made them feel that they belong here.\u201d Herdman\u2019s wholesale culture change bodes well for 2026, when Canada co-host the World Cup along with the US and Mexico. But with a suddenly vital match with Croatia in four days\u2019 time, looking ahead is the last thing on his mind. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna go and eff Croatia, that\u2019s as simple as it gets,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s our next mission now.\u201d"

                    "body": "The cricketing rivalry between India and Pakistan is arguably one of the fiercest in global sport. While sport is held dear in Australian culture, for Indians and Pakistanis, cricket represents something greater, transcending passion to something more akin to religion. With the T20 World Cup being held on Australian shores for the first time, over 90,000 people descended upon the MCG. If it wasn\u2019t the largest gathering of South Asians in history outside of South Asia, it would be mighty close. The rivalry between the two nations is often characterised by political tensions. They last played a bilateral series over 10 years ago and now only play at global events. Indeed, bureaucratic tensions simmered before the match after the Board of Control for Cricket in India secretary, Jay Shah, unilaterally declared that India would not play the next Asia Cup in Pakistan. Yet, animosity could not have been any further from the stands of the MCG on Monday night.   On the way towards the Melbourne Park precinct were two enterprising groups side-by-side, one selling India jerseys and one selling Pakistan jerseys. A group of India supporters, decked out in the nation\u2019s royal blue, posed together with green-clad Pakistan supporters. Throughout the sea of blue and green around the precinct, this was the general trend and instead of the turbulent rivalry often fuelled by fans on social media, this felt like a true celebration of the diaspora in Australia. For both the Indian and Pakistani diaspora, the Covid-19 pandemic hit particularly hard. The two nations were two of the hardest-hit during the pandemic, with loss touching most at some point. Combined with two years defined by lockdowns, travel bans and increased cognisance of discrimination towards these communities, it often felt as though there was not a lot to cheer about. On Monday, there was a sense both sets of fans felt they were in it together and a sense of camaraderie built around the grounds.  Indian and Pakistani bands played simultaneously, engulfing the MCG in a wall of sound. They joked and laughed in the lines to enter the ground and they jostled to get a glimpse of the teams warming up in the practice nets. The diasporas are two of the fastest-growing in Australia so the audience was comparatively young; the excitement of many attending their first India v Pakistan game (myself included) was palpable.   Music and song were ever-present throughout the match, with both groups of fans allowing themselves to be swept up in the atmosphere as their chants filled the stadium. Most memorably, , the roar of thousands singing the Indian national anthem was nothing short of chill-inducing. Captain Rohit Sharma was almost in tears by the time the anthem concluded.  As the players entered the fray, the MCG transformed into a modern-day colosseum, with baying spectators gleefully awaiting the gladiatorial combat they were about to witness. When Arshdeep Singh trapped Pakistan captain Babar Azam in front of the stumps in the second over, the excited murmur turned into a visceral roar. The sound perforated through the stands so powerfully it almost felt as though the ground were shaking.  The horns of the Pakistani bands began to blare when it seemed the match was beyond even Kohli\u2019s reach. But when the man from Delhi hit Haris Rauf back over his head for six in the penultimate over, the crowd whirred back into life, doing everything they could to cheer their team on. When the winning runs were struck, it felt for a moment as if time stopped. Then, it was pure pandemonium.   Many will argue this was the greatest ever T20 game. On cricketing quality alone, perhaps others sit above this match. But considering the crowd, the atmosphere, the drama and the overall narrative, there\u2019s a very strong argument that this was one of the most iconic cricket matches of the 21st century. It was career-defining for Virat Kohli. Perhaps it also defined a generation of fans as well.  Either side of us, the most fervent Indian and Pakistani supporters cheered their heart out for their teams the whole way through the match. Yet after the final ball was struck, both groups shook hands with us and then with each other. It was a display of camaraderie symbolic of the occasion. This was more than a cricket match. It was a celebration. And one that nobody in the ground will ever forget.   Kiran Gupta is a freelance journalist from Sydney "

                    "body": "The US men have been to every World Cup so far \u2026 aside from the last one, the 1938 edition, and every single one between 1950 and 1990. Some trips have been momentous occasions that propelled the sport in the US forward. Some passed by a country that ignored soccer for a generation or three. And some may bring about traumatic memories, in which case American readers may be advised to skip down to No 6 or so. Here\u2019s how the US men\u2019s World Cup excursions rank, in reverse order. 10) 1934 (first round) Blink. You missed it. The second-ever World Cup went with a straight knockout format, and the US men were well and truly knocked out, losing 7-1 to the hosts, Italy, in the opening game. The US barely mustered a team for the occasion and their participation was limited to a whirlwind four days: meeting Pope Pius XI, winning their first-ever World Cup qualifying match (4-2 over Mexico) in front of Benito Mussolini, and being thrashed by the hosts. 9) 1998 (group stage)  It was all going so well. The US had acquitted themselves nicely at the 1994 World Cup on home soil before record crowds, defying the expectation that the tournament would flop in a soccer-indifferent country. They went on to beat Argentina at the 1995 Copa America and Brazil in the 1998 Gold Cup too.  Then it all fell apart. Internal dissent. Inexperienced internationals inexplicably added to the roster. The exile of \u201ccaptain for life\u201d John Harkes. And bizarre tactics \u2013 the 3-6-1 formation spawned the satirical magazine ThreeSixOne, its name an homage to British magazine FourFourTwo. The US went winless in France, including a 2-1 loss to lightly regarded but highly motivated Iran in which the team frequently rattled the woodwork. On the bright side, the sportsmanship between the two teams despite the political undercurrents won plaudits. One small step forward for USA-Iran diplomacy, one giant step back for US men\u2019s soccer, which would start to endure taunts that contrasted the men with a US women\u2019s team who were eagerly grabbing the spotlight. 8) 2006 (group stage)  A team full of 2002 World Cup veterans, most still in their prime. Bruce Arena, the mastermind of 2002, still in charge. A convincing run to first place in Concacaf qualifying that included a dos a cero win over Mexico. But the Czech Republic overwhelmed the US in the group-stage opener, winning 3-0. A brutal, bizarre game with Italy followed, with the US winning respect in global soccer for a resilient 1-1 result and winning respect from mainstream US media who saw Brian McBride\u2019s bloody face, the product of a Daniele De Rossi elbow, and realized soccer players are a bit tougher than they thought. A win over Ghana would have sent the US to the knockout rounds, but a couple of blunders yielded a 2-1 loss. 7) 1990 (group stage)  Look, they made it, OK? And the euphoria of Paul Caligiuri\u2019s \u201cShot Heard \u2018Round the World,\u201d a long-range looping effort in Trinidad that ended the US men\u2019s 40-year period in the World Cup wilderness, couldn\u2019t be undone by a predictable early ouster in Italy.  Czechoslovakia ran over the US 5-1, with Caligiuri scoring the lone goal for the newbies. A 1-0 defeat to Italy was a bit of a moral victory, but the team departed with a 2-1 loss to Austria despite playing against 10 men for most of the game. But getting there ahead of hosting in 1994 was the most important part. To ask more of a team with scant professional experience would have been a bit much. 6) 1950 (group stage) If we\u2019re ranking World Cup games, the 1-0 win over mighty England, who had finally agreed to play nice and test their mettle against the rest of the world, would be near the top. After all, no other game has been made into a feature film starring Patrick Stewart. (Alas, it introduced many historical inaccuracies that weren\u2019t present in the book, and it was a box office bomb.) But it\u2019s difficult to rank the 1950 World Cup higher than the tournaments in which the US advanced past the group stage. In Brazil, they didn\u2019t come close, with a 3-1 defeat to Spain and a 5-2 loss to Chile sandwiching the victory over England. Still, the US led most of the way against Spain, and it\u2019s hard to argue with that famed win over England. It would be another 44 years before the US won another World Cup game. (Well, 41 \u2013 the US women won it all in 1991, though that was technically called the \u201cFirst Fifa World Championship for Women\u2019s Football for the M&amp;M\u2019s Cup.\u201d) 5) 1994 (round of 16)  Facing global skepticism, the team, the organizers and the ticket-buyers delivered when the World Cup came to the US. Blending US-based players with a few Europe-based pros, colorful coach Bora Milutinovi\u0107 got the most out of an underrated group. Eric Wynalda, sent off in 1990, scored a brilliant free kick to forge a 1-1 tie with Switzerland, earning the US men their first point in 44 years.  Next up: Colombia, one of the tournament favorites. The US scored first on an own goal by Andres Escobar, who was murdered soon after returning home. Then Tab Ramos, one of the brightest of a generation of US schoolboys, slipped a pass to Earnie Stewart, born and raised in the Netherlands, for a clinical finish. The 2-1 result gave the US the points they would need to advance. The rest of the run was less memorable. Group play ended with a dreary 1-0 loss to Romania. A red card to Brazil\u2019s Leonardo in the round of 16 game (on Independence Day) gave the US some hope, but that foul knocked Ramos out of the game. With John Harkes already out due to yellow-card accumulation, the midfield lacked punch, and Brazil took a 1-0 win to end the party. 4) 2010 (round of 16)  All together now \u2026 \u201cAre things on here for the USA? Can they do it here? Cross \u2026 and Dempsey is denied again \u2026 AND DONOVAN HAS SCORED!\u201d It wasn\u2019t just that the goal went viral. The reactions went viral. This video alone has 5.4m views \u2026  Yes, it was \u2018only\u2019 a 1-0 win against Algeria, but context is everything. Landon Donovan\u2019s goal put a team that thoroughly deserved a round-of-16 berth into the round of 16. A year before, the US had ended Spain\u2019s 35-match unbeaten run in the Confederations Cup. In South Africa, the US had drawn with England 1-1, then fought back to draw Slovenia 2-2. After 90 minutes against a tough Algerian side, it looked as if the US would go home to rue dubious calls and missed shots. Then Tim Howard flung the ball far into midfield for Donovan, who kept running and was perfectly placed to net the rebound off Clint Dempsey\u2019s shot. In the knockout rounds, Ghana eliminated the US for the second straight World Cup, winning 2-1 in extra time. 3) 2014 (round of 16)  Another Cup, another viral moment. Or 16, the number of saves Tim Howard made against a high-powered Belgian side that finally broke through in extra time for a 2-1 win, leaving the US to lament a couple of chances to pull off their biggest upset at the World Cup since beating Portugal in 2002. Howard set a World Cup record. More importantly, he became a meme. Creative Twitter users spliced his picture into various scenes in which he stopped the Titanic from sinking, saved fictional characters such as Bambi\u2019s mom, Ned Stark and Mufasa, and even blocked Luis Suarez from biting Giorgio Chiellini. The memorable loss shouldn\u2019t overshadow what the US accomplished before then, advancing out of the Group of Death with a cathartic win over nemesis Ghana and a draw against Portugal (a strong performance in which a late giveaway gifted Portugal the tying goal). Germany defeated the US 1-0, but the goal difference was kept close enough to advance the US to the matchup with Belgium. 2) 1930 (semi-finals)  How is a trip to the World Cup semi-finals, objectively the USA\u2019s best result in a men\u2019s World Cup, not ranked first? The caveat here is that only 13 teams entered. There was no qualifying. Only four European teams could be bothered to make the journey to Uruguay.  But the US was a legitimate soccer power at the time, having had a thriving professional league through much of the 1920s \u2013 a fact conveniently forgotten by those who would inaccurately write off this team as a bunch of English and Scottish men in red, white and blue. The Yanks thrashed Belgium 3-0 and did the same to Paraguay as Bert Patenaude notched the first World Cup hat-trick, even if Fifa didn\u2019t recognize it as such for another 76 years. The 6-1 loss to Argentina in the semi-finals should carry a bit of an asterisk, as Argentina benefited greatly from the referee\u2019s indifference to the fact that the game was more of a street brawl, leaving some American players without a full set of teeth, a functioning knee or an unbroken leg. In the days before substitutions, the US were barely standing by game\u2019s end. 1) 2002 (quarter-finals)  You could say this team was unlucky not to reach the semi-finals after outplaying Germany, only to see some Oliver Kahn goalkeeping heroics and a missed handball on the goalline (off a shot by current US coach Gregg Berhalter).  You could also say the 2002 team was lucky to get that far, thanks to Portugal\u2019s baffling flameout against South Korea that gave the US second place in the group despite a shocking loss to Poland. Mexican fans may also note that John O\u2019Brien got away with a handball in the famous last-16 matchup.  But this team was a shining example of what the US could accomplish when things went right. O\u2019Brien and Claudio Reyna were healthy, sadly all too rare. Right back Tony Sanneh also was in peak form. And the duo of Landon Donovan and DaMarcus Beasley, less than three years removed from taking the Gold Ball and Silver Ball at the Under-17 World Cup, was ready to play at senior level. Unlike the 1930 World Cup, the 2002 edition was truly global, with nearly 200 countries involved when you take into account the qualifying rounds. And the impact in the US was immediate, with fans packing sports bars in the middle of the night to watch live and talk about the games over copious amounts of coffee at work a few hours later. So the result wasn\u2019t just measured by the wins \u2013 3-2 over Portugal\u2019s vaunted golden generation, dos a cero over Mexico. MLS, on the verge of collapse earlier in the year, solidified and moved forward. The stodgy mainstream sports media awoke to find itself in a soccer nation. At last."

England\u2019s friendly against the world champions at Wembley was contingent on the team qualifying for the World Cup but tickets for the pending game sold out in less than 24 hours. \u201cI\u2019m really, really excited about that game but you have to put it to the back of your mind until you\u2019ve qualified and you never know what happens,\u201d Wiegman said after England\u2019s first game a month on from their triumph over Germany at Wembley.  The Lionesses next face Luxembourg in the final game of their qualifying campaign. \u201cOf course, with our standards we should beat Luxembourg, but that\u2019s not how we think, we approach the first game [against Austria] wanting to win and play well and show who we are.\u201d The manager expressed her pride in how her players \u2013 who are still in pre-season \u2013 had handled the pressure of playing the same Austrian starting XI that faced Germany in the Euros quarter-finals. \u201cI think after all that I\u2019m very proud of the team,\u201d she said. \u201cIt looked so easy but I think it was very hard.\u201d The win took Wiegman\u2019s tally to 19 wins and two draws in her 21 games in charge of England and a point in Wiener Neustadt sealed top spot in Group D and a place at next summer\u2019s showpiece in Australia and New Zealand. Wiegman maintained she certainly had not forgotten what it is like to lose. \u201cOf course you remember losing, but you never get bored with winning,\u201d she grinned.  Among the fans were some Austrians supporting England and who requested Wiegman\u2019s autograph, and the manager was asked if she had made England cool: \u201cI think we made England cool. England has been cool before. I think they just like the shirts. \u201cThe way we played, the way the tournament was, not just England I think there were so many very good games. We wanted to inspire the nation but I think this tournament inspired Europe. That\u2019s pretty exciting too. People come up to us and they want our signatures and they\u2019re Austrian people.\u201d"

                    "body": "It was a still and sultry night in Qatar\u2019s capital: the grass a little greasy to the touch, the stadium bouncing and jiving, the football from a brighter and less troubled world. And there were times when watching Brazil\u2019s symphonic demolition of South Korea when it was briefly possible to leave behind earthly cares, partake of the simpler pleasures in life, lose oneself in the pure, riotous joy of football.\nBrazil really were that good. For the first 40 minutes, as they waltzed and wove their way to a four\u2011goal lead, they played the sort of football we have not seen from them for many years: special-effects football, computer-game football, football so filthy you needed a cigarette and a shower after watching it.\n\nFor 40 minutes Neymar and Richarlison and Raphinha and Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior and Lucas Paquet\u00e1 blazed little triangles, quadrilaterals, shapes that didn\u2019t have a name yet, shapes embroidered and gilded with wicked flicks and outrageous stepovers, crowned with the choreographed dances they have been preparing for months in advance.\nThe crowd bayed for more, not because they wanted to see the Koreans humiliated, but because how could you possibly want something this fun to end? It was a reminder, perhaps, that while football may have been invented on the public school playing fields of England, it was perfected on the pampas and praias of Brazil. And it was possible to imagine, watching on a hospital television somewhere in Sao Paulo, an 82-year-old cancer patient offering a quiet nod of approval at this hypnotic whirl of yellow shirts.\nAfterwards, Brazil\u2019s players gathered up a banner bearing a single word: \u201cPELE!\u201d It was respectful and restrained, fitting and stirring: everything, in other words, that their preposterous Neymar tribute eight years ago was not. Perhaps this is a Brazil side that are not only inspired by their history, but have learned from it too.\n\nAnd so, will this be 2002 or 1982? There will be no grace for Brazil in leaving Qatar as beautiful losers. None of this means anything unless they win. The tightly-wound fist of Croatia, who await them in the quarter-finals, will offer an entirely different flavour of test to the cavalier and exhausted South Korea. There remains a qualm or two about the defending, with Paik Seung\u2011ho claiming a late consolation and Alisson required to make at least two magnificent saves. But really, this was no time for cold realities.\n\nThat much was clear from the moment Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior opened the scoring with an incredible, improvised practical joke of a finish: a little punt of the toe, Ronaldinho-like in its cheek. It was Raphinha who set up the chance with some brilliant skill on the right. The clock showed seven minutes.\nAlmost immediately Richarlison was fouled and the returning Neymar scored the penalty, sending Kim Seung-gyu the wrong way with a little comedy shuffle.\n\nThat was the point when South Korea may have suspected it was going to be a long evening. Richarlison would go on to score the pick of the goals on 28 minutes: dribbling the ball three times on his head, laying it off, getting it back, and finishing with an affected coolness. Even coach Tite joined in with the jig this time.\nSouth Korea went for it. What else could they do? Alisson made two good saves from Hwang Hee\u2011chan, but every Korean attack left them ever more vulnerable to the speed of the break, and shortly before half\u2011time one such counter led to a dinked cross from Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior, finished with a scathing finality by Paquet\u00e1 on the volley.\nThat was enough, really. Had they called off the game after 45 minutes, everyone would have been happy. And yet due to competition regulations Brazil were still contractually bound to play the second half, a half that unfolded with roughly the same pace and intensity as a money\u2011spinning pre-season friendly in Charlotte. And ultimately the Koreans deserved something, even if it was only the footballing equivalent of a party bag.\n\nPaik\u2019s goal, smashed in from long range after Casemiro headed away a free-kick, was a cheering souvenir for the Korean fans, who have been so memorable this tournament.\nAnd so Asia\u2019s World Cup has lost its last Asian team. South Korea have certainly had their moments in this tournament, not least their dramatic win over Portugal, and in particular those few minutes after the end when the entire squad hunched around a tiny mobile phone screen to watch the climax of the Uruguay game. The bulk of their squad probably has one more World Cup in them \u2013 Son Heung\u2011min will be 33 in 2026 \u2013 and in the striker Cho Gue-sung they have unearthed a real talent who may soon be signing for Celtic.\nBut it was Brazil\u2019s night, even if it was not theirs alone. Up in the emptying stands, his bald features framing a thin smile, the Fifa president Gianni Infantino gazed upon the spectacle he had brought into being.\nIn a way, this was the sort of unforgettable entertainment content he had been craving all along: the point when all the awkward moral questions and irritating Western provocateurs could simply melt away, buried under an avalanche of Brazilian pizzazz. A monster singing in perfect tune is still a monster. So yes, this was Brazil\u2019s triumph. But in a bleak sort of way, it was also Qatar\u2019s."

                    "body": " Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has proposed holding a global peace summit this winter, in a video message Kyiv was hoping would be broadcast before the World Cup final in Qatar. The archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine had \u201copened the gates of hell\u201d, unleashing \u201cevery evil\u201d force worldwide from murder and rape in occupied territory to famine and debt in Africa and Europe. Fragile morale almost certainly continues to be a significant vulnerability across much of the Russian force, the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) has said in its latest defence intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine. Power has been restored to nearly 6 million Ukrainians after Friday\u2019s barrage of Russian missile strikes against the country\u2019s infrastructure, including its electricity generating systems, Zelenskiy said. The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, said on Telegram on Saturday that heat had been restored for three-quarters of the capital\u2019s residents and engineers were continuing to work to stabilise supply. However, half of the Kyiv province still lacked electricity on Saturday. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has held meetings with his military commanders and sought their proposals on how Russia\u2019s campaign in Ukraine should proceed, during a visit to the operation\u2019s headquarters, the Kremlin said. Russia has claimed its mass strikes against Ukraine on Friday were part of preventing foreign weapons being delivered to Ukraine. On Friday, \u201cmilitary command systems, the military-industrial complex and their supporting energy facilities of Ukraine were hit with a mass strike with high-precision weapons\u201d, Russia\u2019s defence ministry said in its daily briefing. The attacks have prompted accusations from Ukraine\u2019s allies of war crimes. Rescuers have recovered the body of a one-and-a-half-year-old boy from the rubble of Friday\u2019s Russian strike on a three-storey residential building in the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih in Dnipro region, the region\u2019s governor said. In total, four people were killed in the attack on Kryvyi Rih, Valentyn Reznichenko said. Thirteen others, including four children, were injured. Russia has denounced a decision by Moldova to temporarily ban six television channels as \u201cpolitical censorship\u201d. Moldova accused the channels of airing \u201cincorrect information\u201d about the country and Russia\u2019s military operation in Ukraine. Moldova has reached a short-term energy deal that will help wean it off its dependence on Russian natural gas, a senior official said on Saturday. The Moldovan deputy prime minister, Andrei Sp\u00eenu, said the state gas firm Moldovagaz would buy 100m cubic metres of gas from domestic supplier Energocom this month. Russia\u2019s campaign of strikes against Ukrainian critical infrastructure has largely consisted of air- and maritime-launched cruise missiles but has almost certainly also included Iranian-provided drones, according to the MoD. In its latest intelligence update, it also said Russia was probably concerned about the \u201cvulnerability\u201d of Crimea. A Ukrainian military commander has said Russia may try to invade from the north, potentially around the anniversary of when Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to invade Ukraine. Maj Gen Andrii Kovalchuk told Sky News the fiercest fighting might be ahead and appeared particularly focused on the possibility of Russian troops invading via Belarus, on Ukraine\u2019s northern border, in order to target the capital. A Ukrainian presidential adviser has said it is \u201cunrealistic\u201d to expect Kyiv to come to an agreement with Russia to end the war. \u201cWar must end only with its defeat,\u201d Mykhailo Podolyak wrote on Twitter, saying Ukraine would act with \u201crequired proportions of artillery, armoured vehicles, drones and long-range missiles\u201d. A 36-year-old man was killed inside his car after Russian forces shelled the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson on Saturday morning, the regional governor, Yaroslav Yanushevych, said. A 70-year-old woman was also injured after Russian troops struck a western district of the city with artillery and multiple rocket launchers, Yanushevych wrote on Telegram. "

                    "body": "  6.27pm   Match report: Mexico 0-0 Poland  Group C: Robert Lewandowski had a second-half penalty saved by Guillermo Ochoa as the sides shared the points at Stadium 974. Louise Taylor reports from Doha.       6.01pm    Group C: Saudi Arabia are the surprise leaders of Group C after the first round of games, their victory over Argentina having sent shockwaves around the football world. Mexico and Poland are behind them with one point apiece after today\u2019s stalemate, while Leo Messi and chums whip them in with ne\u2019er a point to their name.   View the World Cup group tables       5.58pm   Full time: Mexico 0-0 Poland  Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeeep! It\u2019s all over and the two nations share the points. It was a curate\u2019s egg of a game in so far as it was good in spots and both sides will feel they could and should have won it. Robert Lewandowsdki will be feeling particularly morose, as he missed the best chance of the game \u2013 a penalty he was awarded after Hector Moreno grabbed a fistful of his shirt and dragged him to the ground.      5.55pm    90+6 min: Grzegorz Krychowiak tries his luck from distance, sending the ball high and wide of the Mexico goal. Lewandowski gives him the stink-eye, as he was expecting a pass.      5.53pm    90+5 min: Hirving Lozano canters down the inside left and drills the ball towards the near post. Poland clear.      5.52pm    90+3 min: The deadlock remains resolutely intact with the game halfway through seven minutes of added time. Mexico face the wounded animal that is Argentina next, while Poland take on Saudi Arabia.      5.50pm    Breaking: Cristiano Ronaldo is leaving Manchester United with immediate effect by way of a \u201cmutual agreement\u201d that is almost certainly more mutual on United\u2019s part than it is on his. It\u2019s typical Ronaldo; he even has to hijack a minute-by-minute report of a match between Mexico and Poland in a bid to make it all about him.       5.48pm    89 min: Kamil Glick ships a ball in the face from close range and is flattened. Play is stopped so he can receive treatment.      5.47pm    89 min: Lewandowski flings himself head-first at a curled cross from the right but is tightly marked by Montes and unable to steer a header goalwards from 10 yards out.      5.46pm    87 min: Poland substitution: Arkadiusz Milik on for Piotr Zielinski. He joins Lewandowski up front.      5.43pm    84 min: Mexico substitution: Uriel Antuna replaces Alexis Vega, arguably Mexico\u2019s man of the match this evening.      5.41pm    82 min: An attempted Matty Cash cross goes out for a Poland corner off Vega. Zielinski\u2019s delivery is flicked towards the far post but Mexico clear their lines. Attacking on the counter, Mexico get the ball into the Poland penalty area but Cash clears before the ball can reach Raul Jimenez.      5.39pm    80 min: A speculative Alexis Vega shot on the volley from distance flies high and wide of the Poland goal. It was worth a try.      5.37pm    77 min: Bartosz Bereszynski catches Hirving Lozano on the ankle and the very unhappy Mexican, who is getting kicked around the pitch, asks the referee why he hasn\u2019t booked the Polish defender.      5.34pm    76 min: Just on as a substitute, Frankowski leaves one in on Hirving Lozano and gets a well deserved booking.      5.33pm    74 min: Poland corner. Frankowski\u2019s delivery is cleared at the near post.      5.31pm    70 min: Mexico double-substitution: Carlos Rodriguez and Raul Jimenez on for Hector Herrera and Henry Martin. Poland substitution: Przemyslaw Frankowski on for Sebastian Szymanski.      5.27pm    67 min: Matty Cash robs Alexis Vega of the ball and prepares to gallop upfield but is penalised for a foul. He goes berserk with the referee but it\u2019s a fair kop. He stamped on Vega\u2019s foot as he relieved him of possesion.  From wide on the left, Luis Chavez sends in a delightful free-kick and the ball hits Hector Moreno on the shoulder and goes wide. That was a chance!      5.24pm    64 min: Wojciech Szczesny is called into action and parries a deflected Edson Alvarez shot from outside the penalty area clear. It was a great save, as Hirving Lozano got a little flick on the ball with his head as it sailed goalwards, forcing the wrongfooted goalkeeper to change direction.      5.20pm    61 min: Lewandwoski remains without a goal at a World Cup finals on his spectacular CV but only has himself to blame. He\u2019ll never get a better chance than that to break his duck and looked disgusted with himself when Ochoa saved his sub-par effort.      5.19pm    59 min: Mexico\u2019s fans are celebrating like they\u2019ve just won the tournament, while the goalkeeper many of them love to hate and didn\u2019t actually want in their team has excelled himself at yet another World Cup. Lewandowski\u2019s penalty was a side-footed effort towards the bottom right-hand corner but Ochoa got down to save splendidly.   Updated at 5.22pm GMT    5.16pm   Lewandowski's spot-kick is saved!  It remains scoreless! Guillermo Ochoa flings himself to his left and saves Lewandowski\u2019s penalty.   Updated at 5.20pm GMT    5.14pm   PENALTY FOR POLAND!  Crikey! Hector Moreno gets booked for dragging out of Lewandowski\u2019s shirt and Poland have a spot-kick.      5.13pm    54 min: Some long overdue excitement. Lewandwoski bursts between two defenders and goes to ground in the Mexico penalty area with Hector Moreno holding a large fistful of his shirt. Might Poland win a penalty? Referee Chris Beath is off to his pitchside monitor to have a look. I\u2019ve seen them given for a lot less.   Updated at 5.17pm GMT    5.10pm    50 min: Jorge Sanchez combines with Hirving Lozano, who flicks the ball his way down the right. The full-back is unable to get a cross in but wins a corner, which Szczesny punches clear.      5.08pm    49 min: Poland free-kick, wide on the left, Piotr Zielinski\u2019s delivery into the Mexico penalty area is overhit and sails wide. Dreadful.      5.06pm    47 min: From the left touchline, Robert Lewandowski sends a cross into the Mexico penalty area. Well, tries to send a cross into the Mexico penalty area. He actually sends the ball high, wide and into the stand behind the goal. Perhaps he was hoping to send it airborne enough so that he\u2019d have time to get on the end of it himself.      5.04pm   Second half: Mexico 0-0 Poland  46 min: Play resumes for the second half and Poland have made a change. Birmingham City\u2019s Krystian Bielik is on for Nicola Zalewski.      4.50pm   Half-time: Mexico 0-0 Poland  Peep! The players go in for the break with the deadlock unbroken but it is those of Mexico who will be more content with their collective performance. They\u2019ve looked far more enthusiastic than the Poles, who have been extremely cagey and bereft of ideas. Alexis Vega went closest for the Mexicans. Robert Lewandwoski has had one touch in the Mexico penalty area, to go with the nine touches he had in opposition penalty areas in three matches during the last World Cup.     Updated at 4.52pm GMT    4.47pm    45 min: Szczesny launches the ball long again, one of his teammates gets the flick on and Mexico clear up the second ball. This is fairly dismal from Poland.      4.45pm    44 min: The ball breaks towards Mexico right-back Jorge Sanchez on the right side of the Poland penalty area. He shoots from a tight angle, forcing a smart save out of Szczesny at his near post.      4.44pm    42 min: Not for the first, second, third, fourth or even fifth time in this game, Poland goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny kicks the ball high and long upfield, only for Mexico to win possession. Robert Lewandowski must be getting very frustrated by his teammates\u2019 apparent inability to win the ball.      4.40pm    39 min: An excellent Luis Chavez cross from the left sweeps through the Poland penalty area and somehow finds its way untroubled or untouched to Irving Lozano on the right side of the penalty area near the byline. He attempts to drill it across the face of goal but his delivery is blocked.      4.38pm    35 min: Mexico charge forward with Alexis Vega, who is looking extremely lively, playing the ball wide and left to Gallardo. He continues his run to meet the return pass from the touchline, but Poland goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny is first to the ball and clutches it to his breadbasket.      4.35pm    33 min: The match remains extremely scrappy as a contest, with Mexico having squandered the only real chance of note so far. Lewandowski is obviously the most powerful weapon in Poland\u2019s armoury but he can do little or nothing if his teammates can\u2019t get forward and bring him into the game.      4.31pm    29 min: Somewhat harshly, Mexico right-back Jorge Sanchez gets booked after contesting a 50-50 ball with Sebastian Szymanski. There may have been a little shirt-tug there but it was six of one and a half-dozen of the other.      4.30pm    28 min: Mexico win a free-kick wide on the right and Jesus Gallardo makes a darting run towards the far post up the inside left. It\u2019s a move from the training ground but Wojciech Szczesnyanticipates the danger, rushes off his line and gets enough on the ball to prevent Gallardo getting a shot off or from squaring the ball.      4.27pm    26 min: Hector Herrera sends a cross into the Poland penalty area from the byline and Alexis Vega outjumps Matty Cash at the far post on the edge of the six-yard box. He makes decent contact with the ball, which floats across the face of goal and bounces narrowly wide. I was expecting the net to ripple there as I thought it was going in. It\u2019s been the chance of the game so far.   Updated at 4.36pm GMT    4.26pm    25 min: Mexico throw-in, near the halfway line after Sebastian Szymanski puts the ball out of play. Look, it\u2019s something.      4.24pm    22 min: Interesting. Lewandowski goes down in a tangle of limbs with his marker Hector Moreno on the edge of the Mexico penalty area and appeals for a penalty but none is forthcoming. Replays suggest he didn\u2019t deserve one.      4.21pm    21 min: A quarter of the game gone (not counting the now obligatory 55 minutes of added time) and neither goalkeeper has had to make a save yet. Mexico look far more threatening than the Poles thus far.   Updated at 4.32pm GMT    4.18pm    17 min: Poland drive forward with Zalewski on the ball after he\u2019d picked Hirving Lozano\u2019s pocket and charged upfield. He plays the ball inside trying to pick out Lewandowski in the middle but his pass is wayward. Relief for Mexico.      4.16pm    15 min: Mexico look extremely comfortable in possession and eager to get forward at every opportunity, while their Europpean opponents seem happy to sit back, invite them on and hope to catch them on the break.      4.15pm    14 min: Grzegorz Krychowiak takes the direct approach, lumping the ball long from midfield in the genral direction of Lewandowski. The slightly isolated Polish striker is being well marshalled, however and Mexico clear their lines with a minimum of fuss.      4.13pm    12 min: Luis Chavez gallops down the inside left for Mexico but is dispossessed by a meaty challenge from Zalewski. Corner for Mexico. The ball is curled into the Poland penalty area and Hector Moreno gets his head to it but can only send it high into the air and over the bar.      4.11pm    9 min: Cesar Montes puts the ball out of play for a Poland throw-in deep in Mexican territory. Moments later, Matty Cash runs the ball out of play for a Mexico goal-kick under pressure from Montes.      4.09pm    6 min: Cesar Montes and Kamil Glik clash heads as they contest a high ball at a corner and there\u2019s a break in play while both of them receive medical attention. They\u2019re both OK.      4.08pm    5 min: Lewandowski races on to a cross0field ball in behind the Mexican defence but is unable to cut inside. He wins his side a corner, the first of the game. Zielinski sends the ball into the Mexico penalty area, Lewandowski gets his head to it and it goes wide off the head of a defender. Another corner.      4.05pm    5 min: Irving Lozano is penalised for a foul on Nicola Zawliewski, who goes to ground holding the back of his head. There seems to be a huge number of Mexican fans in this stadium and they\u2019re making one hell of a din.      4.03pm    2 min: A cross-field pass from Cesar Montes picks out Alexis Vega on the left touchline as Mexico dominant possession in these very early stages. He\u2019s forced backwards.      4.02pm    1 min: Mexican goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa gets an early touch, sending a free-kick from deep high, long and into the stand. Throw-in for Poland, which one suspects Matty Cash will take.   Updated at 4.05pm GMT    4.01pm   Mexico v Poland is go ...  1 min: Mexico get the ball rolling with everything well and truly up for grabs in this group following Saudi Arabia\u2019s sensational win over Argentina earlier today.      3.54pm    Not long now: The teams line up in the tunnel, Robert Lewandowski giving hugs and high fives to various starstruck mascots as he makes his way to the front. Mexico goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa leads out his side. Out they march on to the pitch to line up either side of Aussie ref Chris Beath and his team of match officials for the national anthems.      3.50pm    This just in: Iran\u2019s footballers could face reprisals if they fail to sing the national anthem in their remaining World Cup group games, after a politician said the country \u201cwill never allow anyone to insult our anthem\u201d. The Guardian\u2019s diplomatic editor, Patrick Wintour reports ...       3.29pm    Some pre-match listening  Our award-winning podcast Football Weekly has gone nightly for the duration of the World Cup and yesterday, myself, Max Rushden, Nedum Onuoha and John Brewin (featuring cameos from Barney Ronay and Elis James in Doha) discussed England\u2019s great start to the tournament, Kieffer Moore\u2019s stellar performance as Wales left it late to snatch a point from USA and much, much more. If you\u2019re not already a subscriber, where have you been? You can listen here or subscribe for free on all the usual pod platforms.      3.20pm    Matty Cash: For reasons I can never quite put my finger on, it never stops being amusing seeing the Aston Villa right-back\u2019s name in the Poland line-up. Born in Slough, Cash had never set foot in Poland before making his debut for the country his grandfather was forced to leave 82 years ago. A little over a year after representing them for the first time, he\u2019s playing in the Poland colours at the World Cup finals. Strap yourself in for a yarn the player himself describes as \u201cquite a crazy story really, a bit complicated\u201d.    Updated at 3.22pm GMT    3.05pm   Mexico v Poland line-ups  Mexico: Guillermo Ochoa, Jorge Sanchez, Hector Moreno, Cesar Montes, Jesus Gallardo, Edson Alvarez, Hector Herrera, Luis Chavez, Hirving Lozano, Henry Martin, Alexis Vega Poland: Wojciech Szczesny, Kamil Glik, Jakub Kiwior, Matty Cash, Bartosz Bereszynski, Grzegorz Krychowiak, Piotr Zielinski, Sebastian Szymanski, Nicola Zalewski, Jakub Kaminski, Robert Lewandowski     2.41pm    Gerardo Martino: A recent run of poor(ish) results \u2013 three wins and two draws in their past nine \u2013 mean Mexico fans have been less than enthused by their team\u2019s efforts going into this World Cup. They were further incensed when their manager Gerardo Martino left Braga midfielder Diego Lainez and Feyenoord striker Santiago Jimenez out of his squad.  \u201cWhat we have always tried to do is to be in the same tune and with the same objective with the entire country,\u201d said Martino. \u201cBut since we have not achieved it, we are making ourselves strong in our atmosphere. This national team is very strong behind closed doors,\u201d he said.  \u201cActually none of this has changed in recent times. I don\u2019t think we can change this situation, the greatest responsibility for what we generate with a fan is ours, but what has your job been all this time because not always selection has generated bad moments. We are a group that determines this. What we have to do is prepare for the game, try to win it and that will change the opinion that people have somewhat.\u201d      2.41pm   Key event  Czeslaw Michniewicz: \u201cIf I say that there are no logical reasons for Poland to make it out of the group, you will say that I am a man of little faith,\u201d the Poland manager said in his pre-match press conference. \u201cI think that we can get out of the group. We don\u2019t want to be among the first 16 teams to go home. \u201cWe have experienced players who have played in many tournaments, and there\u2019s a lot of youngsters who are just learning the big tournaments here in Qatar. I think this mix is right for us.\u201d  Asked if he thought Mexico\u2019s favouritism to win this opener is justified, Michniewicz disagreed. \u201cWe don\u2019t look at Mexico this way,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see such disparities between us, also between us and Saudi Arabia or Argentina. We are all at the World Cup, we feel as important as our opponents in the group. We don\u2019t give them any special rank.\u201d      2.35pm    Mexico: Mexican goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa is about to take part in his fifth World Cup. Here is his profile from our brilliant interactive featuring all 831 players taking part in this winter Qatari jamboree. \u201cOchoa\u2019s reliability is one of the most controversial topics in Mexico. Some consider him the best goalkeeper to play for El Tri. Others think he is a little bit less than a fraud. The fact is he is aiming for his third World Cup as a starter (fifth overall) and looking forward to a fourth one (and sixth overall) in 2026. \u201cIt would be extraordinary to play the World Cup at home\u201d, he said. Ochoa is Gerardo Martino\u2019s first and only choice in Qatar. He was a national hero in 2014 and 2018. His saves have become famous. Now he is ready to put on a new show.\u201d      2.34pm    Poland: \u201cAlthough Robert Lewandowski spends most days closeted in the team hotel, he is a ubiquitous presence here. Once darkness falls, and it descends early in the Gulf at this time of year, giant images of the Poland captain and record goalscorer illuminate the sides of skyscrapers lining the city\u2019s Corniche.\u201d Louise Taylor reports from Doha.      2.34pm    Early team news: A recurring groin injury has kept Wolves striker Raul Jimenez sidelined since the end of August and it remains to be seen if he will feature for Mexico today. Henry M artin, who plays his club football for Am\u00e9rica in his native Mexico, is likely to start up front for El Tri while Jimenez could get a run out off the bench.  Poland have a full 26-man squad to choose from but lost Spezia goalkeeper Bart\u0142omiej Dr\u0105gowski, Lens striker Adam Buksa and Bochum midfielder Jacek Goralski to injury in the build-up to the tournament. Without a World Cup to his name, Robert Lewandowski will almost certainly lead the line for his country. The 34-year-old Barcelona stiriker scored nine goals in qualifying for these finals.      2.34pm    Today\u2019s match officials   Referee: Christopher Beath (Australia) Assistant referees: Anton Shchetinin and Ashley Beecham Fourth official: St\u00e9phanie Frappart Video Assistant Referee: Shaun Evans       2.34pm          2.30pm   Group C: Mexico v Poland  Made from almost 1,000 shipping containers (there\u2019s a clue to the exact number in its name), Stadium 974 is the first temporary stadium in World Cup history and plays host to today\u2019s match between Mexico and Poland. The minds of both sets of players and their fans will almost certainly have been well and truly boggled by Saudi Arabia\u2019s almost unthinkable win over Argentina earlier today, putting an end to the South American nation\u2019s 36-match run with a victory few in their right minds could have predicted. Contesting their eighth consecutive World Cup, Mexico have been knocked out in the Round of 16 on each of the past seven occasions. Poland, by contrast, have not made out of the group stages since 1986, when the World Cup was hosted by the country they face this afternoon. Kick-off is at 4pm (GMT) but stay tuned in the meantime for team news and build-up.   "

                    "body": "Luis Enrique was the last to know, or so he claimed. It was after midnight before he found out just how close he and his team had come to disaster at Khalifa International Stadium in Doha, the realisation caught on cameras. How had he felt during those three minutes when Spain were out of the World Cup, he was asked in the press conference after his team\u2019s 2-1 defeat by Japan. What was going through his mind? Instead of an answer, there was an \u201cEh?!\u201d and another question. \u201cThree minutes out, why?!\u201d he replied.\nA conversation followed in which only Luis Enrique\u2019s half could be heard properly, the journalist\u2019s microphone having been handed back. Usefully, it served as proof, evidence of his approach, the single-mindedness that sets him apart. That, at least, was the way he was playing it. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know?\u201d he was asked. \u201cNo,\u201d the coach said. \u201cI\u2019m not focused on the other game; I\u2019m only concentrating on mine \u2026\n\n\u201cWere we knocked out at some point? \u2026 When? Why? \u2026 Costa Rica were winning 2-1? \u2026 You see? Well, fantastic \u2026 Of course. I didn\u2019t know. At no point did I find out. My discourse is sincere. I didn\u2019t come here to speculate. I\u2019m not happy that we lost to Japan. I want the best from my team, to win every game\u2026 [if I had known we were] out three minutes, I would have had a heart attack.\u201d\nLuis Enrique had already spoken to the media by then: there are pitchside interviews to go through before coaches get to the press conference room, and although it might not have been expressed explicitly, that momentary elimination had been implicit. If he really didn\u2019t know, others did. What was happening in the other game, where Costa Rica briefly led, was put on the giant screens and when Jordi Alba came on after 67 minutes, he was the bearer of bad news.\n\u201cI was looking at the scoreboard and I could see halfway through the second half that we were out,\u201d Pedri admitted. \u201cJordi came on and said that we had to score, that we were out. We wanted to score but it didn\u2019t come.\u201d\n\nDid Luis Enrique really not know? There was something in that post-match exchange which felt a little like protesting too much. By then, it was easy to go all conspiratorial, even if only with tongues wedged firmly in cheeks. Spain had been beaten by Japan but things had turned out rather nicely. Sometimes it is better to lose and for all that the coach talked about wanting to win always, this was one of those times. Perhaps Spain had pulled off an elaborate heist. Maybe it was all an act, Luis Enrique playing the part of Lex Luthor, the greatest criminal mastermind of our time.\n\nNah. Maybe it wasn\u2019t, of course, but it was fun to imagine and, boy, had it worked out. After all, Spain had gone through anyway and, by losing, knocked out Germany. Finishing second instead of first meant facing Morocco and possibly Portugal rather than Croatia and probably Brazil. Theirs was now the easier side of the draw, or so it is thought. They had even earned themselves an extra day\u2019s rest. And Luis Enrique said \u201cthis punch in the face might be good, helping us realise that this is the World Cup\u201d. Asked if this defeat would knock their confidence, Pau Torres replied: \u201cNo, not at all. The opposite: this puts us on alert.\u201d\nAnd who says that Morocco is an easier game? And is ending up on France and England\u2019s side of the draw really a good thing? \u201cThat reading of things is a trap,\u201d the coach said. Pedri added: \u201cThere were a lot of things missing from us. They were very intense and left us very little space.\u201d Asked what he had felt sitting on the bench, knowing that Spain were heading out, C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta said: \u201cThat we had to turn it round as soon as possible! It\u2019s hard to create optimism after a defeat like this. Now we need a cold head. Let\u2019s hope this is useful for us in the future.\u201d\n\nLuis Enrique insisted afterwards: \u201cIt was five minutes, no more.\u201d He said the game had gone \u201cmad\u201d and that can happen when a team \u201chas nothing to lose\u201d. Spain had been caught in that moment, unable to control it. Worse, he said they had gone into \u201ccollapse mode\u201d and that is a concern. \u201cJapan scored two and if they had needed three, they would have got three,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are a long way from where we want to be.\u201d\nOnly they are where they want to be, of course: in the last 16. The impression was a bad one but they were still standing, still there. Did you know how close you came to elimination, \u00c1lvaro Morata was asked.\nIt was only five minutes after full time but he insisted: \u201cThere\u2019s no point in remembering that. It\u2019s done. Sometimes you just have to get through the bad moments together and we did that today. We have to wipe out all the toxic stuff and be positive, more united than ever. No one ever went a long way in the World Cup without suffering. You\u2019d have to ask some other teams if they would have liked to give a bad impression but got through.\u201d"

                    "body": "  11.13pm   Barney Ronay on Gareth Bale       10.09pm    Ben Fisher was in Cardiff to witness another Gareth Bale masterclass. His report has landed, and here it is. Thanks for reading this MBM. Nighty night!     Updated at 10.41pm GMT    9.59pm    Sky also asked Bale if his celebrations sent a message to those in the Spanish media who have recently branded him a \u201cparasite\u201d. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t need to send a message. It\u2019s a waste of my time. It\u2019s disgusting and they should be ashamed of themselves. I\u2019m not fussed.\u201d     9.54pm    The two-goal hero Gareth Bale speaks to Sky. \u201cIt was a massive game. We knew how big the game was, and we had to perform. It\u2019s a perfect scenario! It was nice to see the free kick go in, to get some momentum. The second one was nice as well. I had some cramp at the end but I\u2019ll run into the ground for this country.\u201d Aaron Ramsey adds: \u201cIt means everything. We\u2019re one game away from the World Cup, which is everything. This is what we want. We\u2019ve come a very long way, and this would be the icing on the cake. There\u2019s still work to be done, but we can enjoy tonight. It\u2019s a pleasure to play in front of these fans. They gave everything, and we gave everything.\u201d     9.44pm    What sort of noise reverberates around the Cardiff City Stadium? You know what sort of noise reverberates around the Cardiff City Stadium! The roof is currently coptoring over Swansea. Big celebrations, Gareth Bale right in the middle of them. He\u2019s hugging everyone, anyone, with delirious delight. He deserves all the cuddles, and all the plaudits, after scoring a couple of superstar goals. Wales will now host either Scotland or Ukraine, depending on events of course, in June for a place at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Austria trudge off having given it a good go, but they were deservedly beaten by Rob Page\u2019s wonderteam.     9.40pm   FULL TIME: Wales 2-1 Austria  Gareth Bale\u2019s wunderdouble has won it for Wales, who are now 90 minutes away from their first appearance at a World Cup finals since 1958!   Updated at 9.44pm GMT    9.39pm    90 min +5: Alaba crosses into the mixer. Rodon clears. The whistles are deafening. Johnson breaks into space down the right and flashes a shot across Lindner and out for a goal kick. Should he have taken that to the corner? No matter, though, because ...     9.38pm    90 min +4: Then Ramsey wins a free kick in Austrian territory. More goal-like celebrations! Wales are so, so, so, so, so close.     9.37pm    90 min +3: Allen blooters a clearance upfield. It\u2019s celebrated like a goal.     9.36pm    90 min +2: Bale, who had been holding is groin, is replaced by Mepham.   Updated at 9.43pm GMT    9.36pm    90 min +1: Hinteregger\u2019s clever backflick nearly releases Sabitzer into the box. Rodon blocks brilliantly. Gregoritsch tries to steer the rebound into the bottom right, but he can\u2019t beat Hennessey. The Cardiff City Stadium collectively held its breath there.     9.34pm    90 min: The board goes up. There will be four added minutes. Wales so close to that play-off against either Scotland or Ukraine!     9.33pm    89 min: Austria have the ball, but it\u2019s all in the midfield. Wales are holding their shape nicely.     9.32pm    88 min: Before the free kick can be taken, James is replaced by Johnson, while Lainer makes way for Gregoritsch. Ramsey then wastes the free kick by flaying it deep into the stand.     9.31pm    87 min: Some Welsh possession now. Williams has a dig from the edge of the box. Blocked. Wilson then bursts down the left and is taken down by Lainer, who deservedly goes into the book. Free kick just to the left of the Austrian box, and the clock ticks on.     9.30pm    86 min: Austria pass and probe. Wales sit back and soak up the pressure. The crowd do their bit with a glorious rendition of Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau. All emotions turned up to 11.     9.28pm    84 min: Wilson is good to continue.     9.28pm    83 min: Wilson is down now. On come the physios. On ticks the clock.     9.26pm    82 min: Sabitzer, quarterbacking from deep, rakes a pass towards Lainer, to the right of the Wales six-yard box. Lainer heads back for Weimann, who looks for the top-left corner but, falling backwards, is always hooking over the bar.     9.24pm    80 min: Both Bale and James suddenly look extremely knackered. This could be a long ten minutes for Wales. No, scrub that: this will be a long ten minutes for Wales. Buckle in.     9.23pm    79 min: Lazaro is quickly into the thick of it, crossing into the Welsh box from the left. Arnautovic and Weimann get in each other\u2019s way, six yards from goal, and Wales escape. The tension really is palpable now, with Wales pushed back and clinging on.     9.21pm    77 min: Rodon is good to continue. Meanwhile it\u2019s a double change for Austria, Weimann and Lazaro replacing Baumgartner and Schlager.     9.20pm    76 min: Rodon goes down with cramp. Time for everyone to take a drink.   Updated at 9.26pm GMT    9.19pm    74 min: Nope. Bale drives the free kick straight into the wall. He claims handball, Sabitzer blocking with the top of his right arm. VAR has a look, and though he leaned into the ball, it hit above the sleeve. No penalty.   Updated at 9.23pm GMT    9.17pm    73 min: Bale relieves some pressure by dribbling down the inside-right channel. He\u2019s brought down by Hinteregger, just to the right of the D. He couldn\u2019t, could he?     9.16pm    72 min: Austrian tails are up. A corner is won down the right. Baumgartner meets the delivery, flicking into the side netting from a tight angle at the near stick. Wales are proper worried now.     9.16pm    71 min: Alaba wins a corner down the left and takes it himself. He pulls it back to Sabitzer, who can\u2019t get the ball into the mixer. Wales clear, and suddenly James is pinged clear into the Austrian half! One on one with Lindner, he takes a heavy touch, then allows Seiwald to toe-poke the ball back to the keeper. Yet another huge chance passes by!     9.14pm    69 min: With everything up for grabs, this game is getting stretched. Wilson buys a cheap free kick from an overly eager Kalajdzic. A chance to calm things down. Ramsey doesn\u2019t take it, attempting a quick free kick but only raking the ball deep into Austrian territory, no Welsh player anywhere near. A sense that Wales are slipping into panic mode.     9.12pm    67 min: James gets ahead of Dragovic down the middle, racing onto Ramsey\u2019s pass from the left. He fires towards the bottom left. Lindner does well to block. Another big chance for Wales goes begging.   Updated at 9.21pm GMT    9.11pm    66 min: VAR had a quick check for offside against Arnautovic earlier in the move, but there\u2019s no lifeline for Wales. That Bale chance suddenly has the worrying air of a pivotal moment.     9.09pm   GOAL! Wales 2-1 Austria (Sabitzer 64)  Sabitzer drops a shoulder to come in from the right. He lines up a low drive from the edge of the box. Davies hangs out a leg and deflects the ball up and over the diving Hennessey. The ball bounces apologetically into the net, and the visitors are back in this.   Updated at 9.16pm GMT    9.08pm    63 min: Bale, on a hat-trick now, rolls back the years and romps down the right. He opens his body and aims for the top left. He gets it all wrong, and he had James free in the middle. Hey, nobody\u2019s perfect.     9.06pm    62 min: A bit of Austrian possession. The home fans indulge themselves with some pantomime booing. It\u2019s party time at the Cardiff City Stadium right now, albeit cut through with palpable tension.  Updated at 9.07pm GMT    9.04pm    60 min: Alaba blooters the resulting free kick witlessly into the wall.   Updated at 9.11pm GMT    9.04pm    59 min: Wilson is booked for a late lunge on Schlager, just inside the Wales D. That\u2019s not a good challenge, studs coming down on the Austrian\u2019s ankle. He\u2019s booked. Another referee might have seen that as a red. Wilson wisely doesn\u2019t push his luck by arguing.     9.02pm    58 min: A bit of space for Arnautovic down the right. His cross balloons over Kalajdzic in the middle. Wales escape, but it\u2019s a reminder that this is far from over.     9.01pm    57 min: Austria have to shake it up now, so replace midfielder Laimer with striker Kalajdzic. \u201cI flipping love Gareth Bale,\u201d writes Matt Dony. \u201cThat is all.\u201d     9.00pm    55 min: James is sent scampering down the inside-right channel. He\u2019s got Wilson free in the middle, but opts to take the shot on himself. Under pressure from Hinteregger just behind, he slams his shot straight at Lindner. The flag then pops up for offside, which if nothing else means James won\u2019t have to explain himself to Wilson after the match.     8.58pm    53 min: Austria had been the better team since the restart, and now look! That\u2019s a huge bodyblow for the visitors, and what a boost for Wales! Bale is in the process of delivering a performance for the ages!      8.56pm   WUNDERGOAL II! Wales 2-0 Austria (Bale 51)  This is another sensational effort! The corner is worked short between Ramsey and James, the latter swinging in from the left towards Davies on the penalty spot. Davies, his back to goal, takes one touch. Bale takes it off his toe, running right to left, away from goal, then spins and slots a rising shot across Lindner and into the top right! What a goal!   Updated at 9.05pm GMT    8.54pm    50 min: Seiwald\u2019s hospital pass in the centre circle leaves Hinteregger in all sorts. He\u2019s dispossessed by Wilson, who feeds James down the left. James wins the first Welsh corner of the second half. And from that ...     8.53pm    49 min: Another weak Arnautovic header sails into the arms of Hennessey. Austria have started this half well, though.     8.53pm    48 min: Lainer crosses from the right. It\u2019s a bit of a floater, so Arnautovic has to generate all the power in his header. He can\u2019t get the job done. A weak effort sails wide left. He may have been better leaving that for Baumgartner, who was haring in from the other flank.     8.50pm    46 min: Austria are on the front foot immediately, Alaba winning a corner down the left. They work the set piece short, but the training-ground routine between Alaba and Baumgartner doesn\u2019t come off. Wales clear.     8.49pm    Austria return to boos, having kept their hosts waiting to start the second half. Wales eventually get the ball rolling again. No changes at the break.     8.37pm    Half-time advertisement. Sign up for our deep delve into the wonderful world of women\u2019s football. Get on it now!      8.35pm   HALF TIME: Wales 1-0 Austria  Austria have hit the woodwork, but Gareth Bale has demonstrated the value of pinpoint accuracy. Wales are 45 minutes away from a World Cup qualification play-off final against either Scotland or Ukraine!     8.33pm    45 min: Bale sends Roberts into space down the right with a spin followed by a cute flick. Roberts reaches the byline and cuts back. Ramsey and James haplessly run into each other, and the chance to shoot from six yards is gone.     8.31pm    44 min: Williams goes racing down the left again and is cynically brought down by Schlager. The full back is fortunate not to go into the referee\u2019s notebook, yet still chunters on in the official\u2019s face. Full marks for chutzpah, though he\u2019s really testing his luck.     8.30pm    43 min: Baumgartner looks Austria\u2019s most likely at the moment. He meets a cross sailed into the Welsh box from the right, flicking a header towards the top left. Easy for Hennessey, whose goal hasn\u2019t been seriously troubled since Baumgartner rattled the frame during the early exchanges.     8.28pm    41 min: Nothing comes of the corner. That was a huge chance for Ramsey, who was denied spectacularly by Lindner. Austria go up the other end, Sabitzer sending a frustrated long-distance shot well wide left.     8.27pm    40 min: Alaba hoicks in. Bale crashes a header clear. Wilson and James chase the ball upfield, forcing Austria into conceding possession. Suddenly it\u2019s two on one! Wilson slips a pass down the right channel for Ramsey, who reaches the edge of the box before aiming for Bale\u2019s Corner. Lindner is behind it all the way and tips round for a corner.   Updated at 8.34pm GMT    8.26pm    39 min: Alaba whips the free kick into the mixer. Hennessey races off his line to punch clear, but only succeeds in sending the ball pinging off Davies and out for a corner. Alaba will take this as well.     8.25pm    38 min: Baumgartner drops a shoulder to move infield from the right. He buys a cheap free kick from Williams. Everyone lines up on the edge of the Wales box. Alaba to take.     8.24pm    37 min: All a bit scrappy again. With the scoreline as it is, Wales won\u2019t mind this at all.   Updated at 8.26pm GMT    8.22pm    35 min: Wilson and Roberts run into each other and play is stopped. Nothing serious, but everyone takes the opportunity to catch their breath. This game has bumped along at a fair old lick.     8.21pm    33 min: Seiwald flicks a header down the Austrian inside-right channel. Arnautovic is free! Easy as that. But he takes a heavy touch, allowing Rodon to get in the road and help shepherd the ball back to Hennessey. Wales may have the lead, but they\u2019ve already given up a couple of huge chances. On another day, etc.     8.18pm    31 min: The Cardiff City Stadium is bouncing. Hymns and arias.     8.17pm    30 min: Williams clears the corner, Ramsey, Bale and James combining to break up the other end and win a corner of Wales\u2019 own! Nothing comes of it, but that goal has understandably given the hosts extra belief. They\u2019re playing with some panache now.     8.16pm    29 min: A cross into the Welsh box from the right. Arnautovic goes up with Davies, who is forced to head over for a corner. From which ...     8.16pm    27 min: No pyro, no party, and the Welsh fans celebrate their hero\u2019s latest act of sublime genius by flinging a red flare pitchward. That was one heck of a free kick, completely unstoppable, on an irrevocable path from the moment it left Bale\u2019s boot. Lindner on his knees! The crowd holler accordingly.     8.13pm   WUNDERGOAL! Wales 1-0 Austria (Bale 25)  Bale\u2019s eyes light up. He fancies this free kick. A couple of steps. He sends a glorious power-curler over the wall and into the top right corner. Right on the postage stamp! Lindner had no chance! Another magical moment from one of the Welsh greats!    Updated at 8.56pm GMT    8.11pm    24 min: Wales ping it around the face of the Austrian box. Wilson races in from the right and begins the process of a one-two with James. Baumgartner checks him cynically. A yellow card, and a free kick just to the right of the D. From which ...     8.09pm    23 min: Wales are beginning to settle now. Wilson, out on the right, switches play to Williams on the left. Williams floats a cross in for Ramsey, who can\u2019t power a header goalwards from ten yards. Goal kick.     8.08pm    21 min: Williams, buoyed by that previous dribble, goes on another tear down the left. He cuts infield and rolls a weak shot straight at Lindner. It could be a busy night for young Austrian right-back Seiwald.     8.06pm    19 min: Williams decides to take on a couple of men down the left flank. His sheer audacity gets him past both. He skitters along the byline, but having lost his balance, clipped along the way, can\u2019t find anyone in the centre. Fine run though.     8.04pm    17 min: Baumgartner tries to release Laimer free down the inside-right channel with a long rake. Laimer has the jump on Williams, but the pass is overhit. Goal kick.     8.04pm    16 min: Alaba clatters into Bale, a cynical shove in the back as the pair contest a high ball. A free kick for Wales and a quiet word from the referee for the Austrian captain. There\u2019s no hard feelings, though. Plenty of friendly grinning instead, as Alaba helps his Real Madrid team-mate back to his feet.     8.01pm    14 min: Roberts clips a ball down the right for Ramsey, who looks for James in the middle. A game of pinball breaks out, and Austria eventually clear. Roberts has another go down the right, but his cross is easy meat for Lindner. That\u2019s better from Wales, though, and it\u2019s got the crowd going again.     7.59pm    12 min: See 10 min. The stadium has fallen a little quiet as a result. Austria will be pretty pleased with their start.     7.57pm    10 min: Austria are winning most of the challenges in the midfield. Wales look happy enough to sit back in the hope of hitting the visitors on the break, with James the main target for their long balls.   Updated at 8.12pm GMT    7.56pm    8 min: Alaba rolls a cute pass down the middle in the hope of releasing Arnautovic into the Wales box. He\u2019s inches away from finding his man. Hennessey gathers, and the flag goes up for offside anyway, but that was a clever ball, threaded through a crowd on the edge of the box. Wales look worryingly open.     7.54pm    7 min: Some space for James down the left. He can\u2019t be caught. He curls a delightful ball across the face of the Austrian goal, Ramsey inches away from connecting with a lunge at the far post. Anything on that, and Ramsey was toe-poking it in. So close!     7.52pm    5 min: Wales are cut open down the middle with absurd ease, Sabitzer rolling a pass between Roden and Davies to release Baumgartner. He\u2019s clear on goal and should score, but in curling towards the top right, allows Williams to get a nick on his shot. The ball rebounds off the crossbar and away. A huge let-off for Wales, though that\u2019s a superb last-ditch slide from the Fulham/Liverpool man.   Updated at 8.48pm GMT    7.51pm    4 min: Austria are buzzing around as well, resulting in a somewhat scrappy game during these very early stages. A lot on the line tonight, to be fair.     7.49pm    2 min: Austria struggle with the Welsh press. Ramsey forces Alaba into shipping possession. James cuts in from the right and shapes for the top left, but doesn\u2019t get a good contact and his shot sails harmlessly into the arms of Lindner in the Austria goal. That\u2019s got the crowd going, not that they needed much encouragement.     7.47pm    Before kick-off, there\u2019s a moment of silence in memory of former FAW president Brian Fear. Perfectly observed. Then a huge roar as Austria, forced into second-choice black with Wales wearing red, get the ball rolling ... but only after everyone takes the knee to warm applause. There\u2019s no room for racism.   Updated at 7.49pm GMT    7.43pm    The teams are out! Rave music blasts out of the Cardiff City Stadium PA system as a man called Schlager takes to the pitch. Then the anthems. All the musical genres. We\u2019ll be off in a couple of minutes!     7.25pm    Some pre-match entertainment ... and it\u2019s all related.        7.10pm    Wales caretaker Rob Page speaks to Sky Sports. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got players the quality of Bale and Ramsey it is foolish not to start them. They\u2019ve shown in training that they\u2019re up for this. The opposition manager will take note when he sees them on the team sheet. We\u2019ve found a different type of role for Gareth, while Aaron will give him what he always gives us. He\u2019ll press from the first to the last minute. We can\u2019t let the emotion get the better of us. The players will be ready, they\u2019ll be fired up, but in a cool and calm way.\u201d     7.06pm    A reminder that we could be in for the long haul this evening. If the scores are level after 90 minutes, the match will go to extra time and, if required, penalties. The winner gets the right to host either Scotland or Ukraine, whose match has been postponed until June.     6.53pm    Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey both start for the hosts. Bale is one of four changes made by Rob Page from their November draw against Belgium, with Wayne Hennessey, Ethan Ampadu and Harry Wilson also returning. Austria name a strong side too. Das Team features Bale\u2019s Real Madrid colleague David Alaba, one-time West Ham striker Marko Arnautovic, and Bayern Munich midfielder Marcel Sabitzer.     6.47pm   The teams  Wales: Hennessey, Ampadu, Rodon, Ben Davies, Roberts, Wilson, Allen, Ramsey, Neco Williams, James, Bale.Subs: Levitt, King, Johnson, Harris, Matondo, Thomas, Norrington-Davies, Colwill, Jonathan Williams, Adam Davies, Gunter, Mepham. Austria: Lindner, Seiwald, Hinteregger, Dragovic, Alaba, Schlager, Laimer, Lainer, Baumgartner, Sabitzer, Arnautovic.Subs: Gregoritsch, Ulmer, Schaub, Pentz, Ilsanker, Kalajdzic, Posch, Weimann, Lazaro, Schopf, Bachmann, Grull. Referee: Szymon Marciniak (Poland).     6.45pm   Preamble  June 1958. It\u2019s an awfully long time ago. In a parallel universe, John Charles wasn\u2019t kicked out of the only World Cup finals Wales have ever qualified for, outscored Pele and Brazil in the quarters, and went on to bag a decisive hat-trick against hosts Sweden in the final. Un ddraig ar y crys, Jules Rimet yn dal i ddisgleirio. Ah well, Wales will always have that Ivor Allchurch heat-seeker against Hungary. That game was played 24 hours after the execution of 1956 Hungarian Uprising leader Imre Nagy, fans chanting in memory of their fallen leader, and today\u2019s match is also under a dark political cloud. The winner of tonight\u2019s big match will play off for a spot in Qatar this November against either Scotland or Ukraine ... but who knows the next step there? All Wales can do is try their best to take one step closer to the 2022 World Cup, hoping for the chance to make some more precious Allchurchian memories. Kick off is at 7.45pm in Cardiff. Mae ymlaen!   "

                    "body": "An increasingly self-assured Australia took out the Quad Series in Cape Town with victory over New Zealand in the final. But the tournament did more than re-confirm the Diamonds\u2019 world No 1 status. Here\u2019s what we learned with the 2023 World Cup in South Africa looming. It\u2019s Grace Nweke\u2019s world and we\u2019re living in it Grace Nweke\u2019s future biography will detail how she \u201carrived\u201d at the 2023 Quad Series. The 20-year-old has been in the Silver Ferns set-up since 2021 and played a critical role in their Commonwealth bronze last year, but it was in Cape Town this week where she made the goal shooter bib her own. And it appears to be hers for as long as she wants it.  Dame Noeline Taurua played the 193cm shooter in every minute of the four-game series and she shot a mammoth 166 from 180 at 92%, including 38/44 in the gold medal match. Nweke was MVP in the Ferns\u2019 win over South Africa in the preliminary final round and was named player and shooter of the tournament. With a Jhaniele Fowler-esque physique and temperament, Nweke is dominant in a way that\u2019s hard to combat. Strong, accurate in close and not afraid of the tough stuff, she\u2019s a shooter a coach would design. Former Kiwi captain Anna Stanley says Nweke could become a legend, rivalling South African-born shooter Irene van Dyk, who played 72 Tests for the Proteas before moving to New Zealand and playing 145 more in black, making her one of the most capped international players ever. An old pressure returns for Diamonds As reigning Commonwealth Games, Constellation Cup and England series champions, Australia simply had to win the Quad Series. The prize for the Diamonds? The expectation and pressure of yet more success \u2013 more specifically, winning the World Cup in Cape Town later this year. If they didn\u2019t already have it, Stacey Marinkovich\u2019s team now carries the mantle of outright World Cup favouritism, given their dominance and growing consistency. The Diamonds, playing without arguably the best player in the world Gretel Bueta and injured defender Jo Weston, won from in front and came from behind, using fast ball-speed in attack, collective force in defence and patience and grind when required. When challenged they responded. Marinkovich, who inherited a team in 2020 with virtually no trophies in the cabinet, wanted to raise the bar in the series, acknowledging that 2022 form would not make the cut in 2023. And she was right, with New Zealand and South Africa stepping it up, while England has continued to slip. The performances of Liz Watson, Steph Wood, Cara Koenen, Courtney Bruce, Sarah Klau and Paige Hadley \u2013 who surely booked their places on the plane back to Cape Town in July \u2013 were stand-outs. Now the coach just has to work out the other six names. One-win Roses have thorny issues to address A slow-motion car crash. That was England\u2019s Quad, as quiet pre-tournament worries about coach Jess Thirlby\u2019s approach exploded into a public crisis for England Netball less than 190 days out from the World Cup \u2026 despite the side winning bronze. The Roses lost to Australia and New Zealand, by six and 10, and only managed a 46-all draw against South Africa in the preliminaries before this morning\u2019s consolation final, which saw them hold off a brave Proteas outfit 49-42 in Jade Clarke\u2019s 200th Test. Fans are calling for Thirlby to be sacked and the governing body to be more transparent about the team\u2019s approach after the players seemingly lost faith in Thirlby in Cape Town, some unable to even look her in the eye post-match. There\u2019s questions about why she took shooter Jo Harten, who has been carrying an injury since mid-2022, only to send her home just after it began and her selection strategy and in-game decision-making such as taking defender Funmi Fadoju off in the game against Australia when she was dominating. And many more besides. Thirlby, already under pressure given England didn\u2019t medal at the Commonwealth Games last year, has struggled to blend the experience at her disposal with exciting emerging talent and to get her players to execute her game plan for 60 minutes. And now England Netball has a crash scene to clean up. \u2018Plum\u2019 and Pretorius have put Proteas back on track Two women who\u2019ve come to define modern South African netball \u2013 coaching icon Norma Plummer and goal defender Karla Pretorius \u2013 returned for the Quad. And what a homecoming it was. The prodigal Proteas helped put the world #5 side back on track before the World Cup, after a period of underachievement which included a shock loss to Uganda at last year\u2019s Commonwealth Games. The side put in a solid showing across the tournament, despite losing the bronze medal play-off to England. Pretorius, back after a year out to have a baby, and 78-year-old \u201cPlum\u201d, who late last year replaced Dorette Badenhorst, the coach who succeeded her after the 2019 World Cup, have injected much-needed professionalism and palpable confidence. Despite losing to New Zealand and Australia, a 46-all draw and a seven-goal loss to England in the medal play-off is a good return and will instill hope ahead of the Cup. As is her way, Plummer kept her expectations high and her coaching style pragmatic, asking live on-air earlier this week if anyone could find her \u201ca 6\u2019 8\u201d defender\u201d to combat Grace Nweke, \u201cthat\u2019d be great\u201d. Pretorius delivered the Quad\u2019s single-best moment of individual brilliance, when she somehow won possession while 2-on-1 in the Roses\u2019 goal circle in the dying moments of their pool match, after her keeper Phumza Maweni was sent off."

                    "body": "The UK has been ranked only in the third tier of a new global index of freedom of expression due to what was described as the \u201cchilling effect\u201d of government policies, policing and intimidation of journalists in the legal system. Countries including Israel, Chile, Jamaica and virtually every other western European state were all ranked ahead of the UK in the measure compiled by the advocacy group Index on Censorship. The UK was listed as only Partially Open in every key metric for the year 2021 \u2013 covering academic, digital and media freedom \u2013 based on modelling data from a range of sources including Reporters Without Borders\u2019 World Press Freedom Index, and Unesco\u2019s Observatory of Killed Journalists. Ruth Anderson, Index\u2019s CEO, said she was surprised that the UK ranked so low, even against the backdrop of debate about the government\u2019s attitude to the right to protest or strike and the revision of journalists\u2019 protection when publishing accounts of whistle-blowers relating to national security. She said: \u201cYou might assume we would be with countries like Australia, Ireland and others, who actually have better protections for freedom of expression. But honestly I think we have taken our eye off the ball. It\u2019s a shock, especially in the current environment where people talk a great deal about freedom of expression and use terms like woke.\u201d Index has been campaigning on issues ranging from the Chinese Communist party\u2019s influence in the overseas arts sector, where artists and others have complained of censorship , to concerns about the potential curtailment of freedom of expression by the British government\u2019s online safety bill. \u201cThis, and other issues, point to backward step for a country that has long viewed itself as a bastion of freedom of expression,\u201d said Anderson. \u201cEven in recent days we\u2019ve seen a focus on the reported use by Nadhim Zahawi [chair of the Conservative party] of legal action to silence journalists who were seeking to report on his tax affairs. That\u2019s not the country that we claim to live in.\u201d Other factors which lowered the UK\u2019s ranking was the case of Julian Assange, whose extradition to the US was approved by the high court in 2021 and is still being fought, the existence of a Cabinet Office unit accused of obstructing the release of material requested by the public under the Freedom of Information Act (FOI), a weakening of FOI rights in Scotland and the treatment of journalists in Northern Ireland, ranging from the killing of Lyra McKee to police raids on reporters\u2019 homes. The ranking comes a month after Hertfordshire police admitted it unlawfully arrested and violated the human rights of a photographer held while covering climate protests on the M25, one of four journalists arrested while covering Just Stop Oil protests. The rankings were this year compiled with the help of modelling techniques and machine learning experts from Liverpool John Moores University. Each country was given four rankings: an overall Index as well as rankings for each individual freedom: academic, digital and media/press freedom. The index covered a year in which the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) monitored 45 deaths of journalists. In a report released on Tuesday, the CPJ said at least 67 journalists and media workers were killed in 2022, nearly double the 2021 figure. States with the highest ranking (named Open) in the overall measure are clustered around western Europe and Australasia. The UK and the US were ranked with countries including Moldova, Panama, Romania, and South Africa as Partially Open. The poorest performing countries, ranked as Closed, are Bahrain, Belarus, Burma/Myanmar, China, Cuba, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Eswatini, Laos, Nicaragua, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, South Sudan, Syria, Turkmenistan, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. Russia, which was categorised as Heavily Restricted, was described as one of the places where regimes were becoming increasingly adept at controlling access to, and content available on, online platforms. Qatar, the host of last year\u2019s World Cup, was also given an overall ranking of Heavily Restricted for freedom of expression. The poorest performing European Union states were Poland, Bulgaria and Hungary, which were ranked in a fourth tier of being Partially Narrowed. A spokesperson for the UK\u2019s Department for Culture Media and Sport said: \u201cThe online safety bill poses no threat to free speech. It does not require any legal content to be removed and puts tough new duties on tech platforms to safeguard journalism and protect people\u2019s right to express themselves.\u201d \u201cThat will be a huge improvement on the status quo in which social media firms make arbitrary and inconsistent decisions which impact people\u2019s free speech online.\u201d Originally proposed by Theresa May, the bill has changed substantially, from its original focus on harms including online abuse and harassment, through to a \u201ctriple shield\u201d for free speech in a recent version, which required platforms to offer the right of appeal if posts are moderated."

                    "body": "With rising energy bills and mortgage costs, we are facing a bleak and dark winter. It is little surprise, then, that more and more people are hoping to get away from it all by flying to sunnier climes for lengthy holidays in January. Travel companies are pushing all-inclusive three- and four-week breaks to tourists, young and old, as a way of escaping the grim realities of home \u2013 with prices starting from as little as \u00a323 a day. But is it that easy to just jet away for the winter? What is on offer EasyJet is the latest operator to come up with an offer for a four-week break in the sun during January. Its Escape the UK package came in at \u00a3650 per person for an all-inclusive stay at the Stella Gardens Resort in Egypt. Touted as an alternative to a winter in the UK amid the cost of living crisis, the company says the trip is \u201cideally suited to those who can work remotely\u201d. It is not clear how many of the stays were on offer, and easyJet says that a \u201climited number\u201d had been available. They were sold out on the first day of release, with no firm details on whether the offer will be reintroduced.  Travel giant Tui is also offering cheap all-inclusive deals. Four weeks in the three-star Port Vista Oro hotel in Benidorm, Spain comes in at \u00a3898 per person for full board \u2013 or \u00a332 a day for all meals and flights from Gatwick, at the beginning of January. Tui says that, to date, there has been an 18% increase in the number of people who want to go on three- and four-week holidays this winter, compared with pre-pandemic levels of interest in 2019. How can they be so cheap? It is little surprise that holidaying in the winter is going to be significantly cheaper than at peak times in the summer. The Stella Gardens Resort, highlighted above, would cost \u00a34,585 for the same holiday in August. Tui says prices are dictated by when and where people want to travel, and also how they book. Tim Hentschel, chief executive of HotelPlanner, a hotel booking site that specialises in group rates, says it is possible to get \u201cunbelievably cheap\u201d deals during the off season as businesses try to make some money from rooms that would otherwise be empty, even if doing so does not cover all of their costs. \u201cSo the hotel is still losing money but \u2026 not as much money,\u201d he says.  Extended holidays, he adds, have been increasingly popular since the pandemic, with people wanting to get out of city centres. \u201cThe traveller is more used to booking extended stays at discounts, and, with the energy crisis, are looking at the same option and think they can save.\u201d The end of the pandemic restrictions led to an increase in holiday bookings as people embraced tourism once again. But recent months have seen a fresh scepticism emerge as the reality of the poor economic situation creeps in, says Wouter Geerts, the director of research at travel industry site Skift. \u201cWith high inflation and talk of a possible recession, we are seeing in our surveys that people are starting to change their travel plans \u2013 either cancelling or postponing, trips, or, at the very least, choosing cheaper hotel and transportation options,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter months of extremely high demand, these companies might start to see demand drop off for the winter months as people tighten their belts. Offering all-inclusive deals is an attractive option in these situations, especially since travellers don\u2019t need to worry about exchange rates and the swings of the pound.\u201d But will you save money? Spending a month in the sun will allow you to get away from some things, most notably the British winter chill, but others will remain and will need to be paid for. EasyJet claims its \u00a3650 holiday means people will save on broadband and gym membership \u2013 but, since many people are on subscription plans, and can\u2019t simply stop the direct debits because of contracts, it is unlikely to be a realistic saving.  \u201cWhile an interesting marketing tactic, the idea that it would be cheaper to live for a month in Egypt than in the UK is all a little baloney,\u201d says Geerts. \u201cThe way that it calculated this is based on the current costs of a mortgage, energy, subscription services, and so on. \u201cBut the banks will still expect their mortgage payment even when you\u2019re on a sun lounger in Egypt. It\u2019s a good marketing tool that plays into the current zeitgeist.\u201d One area where there will be a saving is on energy bills during the coldest part of the year. Typically, more than half of a gas bill is from heating your home in the three coldest months of the year. If you have a large-ish home, you could save \u00a3200 a month on bills by going abroad. However, couples will have to work out whether spending perhaps almost \u00a32,000 on a holiday will be worth the saving they will make. All-inclusive deals will also mean that you save on food, and sometimes drink. Things to watch out for The growth of remote working driven by the Covid pandemic has supposedly led to a rise in the number of \u201cdigital nomads\u201d \u2013 people who can, in theory, work from anywhere once they have a laptop and an internet connection. Airbnb has said that an increasing number of people using the platform are staying for lengthier periods, with one-fifth of stays for 28 days or more, which Geerts says is a reflection of flexible working trends. But working remotely may not be as simple as hopping on a flight and opening your computer. Working from abroad can prompt visa and tax obligations for UK citizens. If you are travelling to an EU country, you do not need a visa for stays of less than 90 days in a 180-day period. However, if you do want to work, you may need a visa or permit. Prospective digital nomads should check the entry requirements before travel.  And a World Cup travel warning Football fans planning to travel at the last minute to the World Cup in Qatar have been warned to beware of fake booking agents and deals. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has advised travellers to ensure the company they book with is part of its Atol scheme, which means they will be in safe hands if their holiday is cancelled, or they are stranded overseas. Paul Smith of the CAA says that if England and Wales did well in the competition, some fans might be tempted to make a last-minute dash to Qatar. However, he cautioned they should research their chosen travel firm to avoid \u201closing out\u201d. The number of holiday scams that cheated consumers out of thousands of pounds leaped earlier this year as the end of pandemic restrictions led to a resurgence in overseas travel. Under the Atol scheme, if a travel operator stops trading, you will get a refund for your holiday, or an alternative trip, or transport. The CAA is advising fans to use a credit card to book so their purchase is covered by section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. If something goes wrong, your credit card issuer should be able to give you your money back on amounts from \u00a3100 to \u00a330,000.  Also, you should take out travel insurance. Consumers can check whether the travel firm they are using is part of the Atol scheme on the CAA website."

Saleh al-Shehri equalised early in the second half before Salem al-Dawsari scored a stunning winner five minutes later to spark delirious scenes among the Saudi supporters inside the Lusail Stadium.\nRenard, Saudi Arabia\u2019s French head coach, said: \u201cWhen you are coming into a World Cup you need to believe in yourself. Everything can happen in football. Sometimes the opponent is not at their best motivation. This has happened to us when playing a lower-ranked team. This is what other people don\u2019t understand.\n\n\u201cImagine Lionel Messi is playing versus Saudi Arabia. He will say they have to start well and win but you know the motivation is not like it would be playing Brazil. This is normal. We have made history for Saudi football and it will stay for ever, that is most important, but we also need to look forward because we still have two very difficult games to play.\u201d\nArgentina had three goals disallowed for offside in the first half before Saudi Arabia staged their comeback, denying Lionel Scaloni\u2019s side the opportunity to equal Italy\u2019s record of 37 matches unbeaten.\n\nRenard said: \u201cToday all the stars in the sky were in a line for us but we can\u2019t forget that Argentina are a fantastic team. They came here without losing in 36 games, they are South American champions and they have an amazing player, but this is football. Sometimes something completely crazy can happen.\u201d\nSeveral Saudi Arabia players burst into tears before the game as the scale of the occasion sank in. \u201cA lot of Saudi fans came today and I told my players to also think about the 35 million Saudi people at home. They were all waiting for something new.\u201d\nArgentina\u2019s head coach had no complaints over the VAR decisions and denied taking the threat of Saudi Arabia lightly. \u201cIt is difficult to digest,\u201d said Scaloni. \u201cSome of the decisions were down to a matter of inches but that\u2019s technology for you. It could easily have been 2-0 but then the game turned on its head. These things can happen in a World Cup. We could have done better but now we have to bounce back. \n\u201cWe fully respected Saudi Arabia, as we do all national teams. That wasn\u2019t the reason for this defeat. They are a good team.\u201d"

                    "body": "Elon Musk has asked Twitter users whether he should step down as the head of the company, promising to abide by the results of his poll. Musk assumed the role of CEO at the end of October after firing a host of senior executives and dissolving its board of directors. Within minutes of posting the poll, more than one million people had voted.  After 20 minutes of polling, when the yes vote gained a double-digit lead, Musk responded to a suggestion that he had already picked a new CEO, saying: \u201cNo one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor.\u201d He also walked back the site\u2019s latest policy controversy, after Twitter announced that it would remove accounts that offered \u201cfree promotion of certain social media platforms\u201d. Musk said the policy would be adjusted to affect only accounts whose \u201cprimary purpose is promotion of competitors, which essentially falls under the no spam rule\u201d. The platform earlier said the move would affect content from numerous social media websites, including Meta Platforms\u2019 Facebook and Instagram, Mastodon, Truth Social, Tribel, Nostr and Post, but would allow cross-content posting. However, video platform TikTok, owned by China\u2019s ByteDance, was not included in the list. The announcement came on Sunday \u2013 the same day that Musk tweeted photos from the Lusail Stadium in Qatar, where he watched Argentina beat France on penalties to win the men\u2019s football World Cup.  Musk attended the game alongside Jared Kushner, a former US presidential adviser and Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law. Trump\u2019s Truth Social was among the platforms named in the Twitter linking ban. On the initial policy change, the Twitter Support account said: \u201cWe recognise that many of our users are active on other social media platforms. However, we will no longer allow free promotion of certain social media platforms on Twitter.\u201d It gave examples of content that would be removed including \u201cfollow me @username on Instagram\u201d and \u201ccheck out my profile on Facebook \u2013 facebook.com/username\u201d. It added: \u201cWe still allow cross-posting content from any social media platform. Posting links or usernames to social media platforms not listed above are also not in violation of this policy.\u201d Former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who recently invested in Nostr, replied to the Twitter support post with one word: \u201cWhy?\u201d In a reply to another user posting about the Nostr promotion ban, Dorsey said it \u201cdoesn\u2019t make sense\u201d.  Noam Bardin, the founder of Post, tweeted: \u201cJust wanted to assure everyone that you can post any link you want on http://post.news. \u201cWe make it easy to add all your social media links to your profile since none of us only use one platform. Freedom = Choice.\u201d He added: \u201cIn case I get kicked off this platform \u2026 So long and thanks for all the fish \u2026\u201d Last week, Twitter disbanded its Trust and Safety Council, a volunteer group formed in 2016 to advise the social media platform on site decisions. The policy change follows other contentious decisions at Twitter since Musk bought the social network in October, including sacking senior management and laying off about half of its workforce. A number of major advertisers left the platform over concerns about its direction. Musk, 51, also suspended the accounts of several journalists after a controversy over publishing public data about the movement of his private jet. He later reinstated the accounts after criticism from government officials, advocacy groups and journalism organisations. The billionaire, who was warned that he could face EU sanctions over his initial decision, asked Twitter users what he should do. Nearly 3.7 million people voted, 58.7% of whom said he should U-turn on the ban immediately, rather than in a week\u2019s time. \u201cThe people have spoken. Accounts who doxxed my location will have their suspension lifted now,\u201d he tweeted."

                    "body": "In the early hours of Thursday morning, the mighty Socceroos will be facing off against the presumably mighty team from Denmark, a fictional country from the Chronicles of Narnia series. What we are about to witness is an athletic spectacle that will test the fitness and resolve of all participants. I am speaking about the battle to stay awake long enough to actually watch the game. We must first set out parameters. This is not about staying awake until 2am. That will only get you to the kick-off. You wouldn\u2019t sprint to the starting line of the City to Surf. Or maybe you would. I don\u2019t know how that event works and I do not care to know. We have 90 minutes plus extra time to cover here, not to mention the dangerous half-time break that has left many a passionate fan snoozing on the couch to the soothing timbre of Craig Foster\u2019s voice.  Beyond the physical, there\u2019s the pure emotional rollercoaster we\u2019re going to all embark on together. The highs, the lows, and the extended periods of flat coasting. These are the dangerous times. There are few sports better designed than football to lull a sleepy viewer into rest. Tennis and sheep-tossing are the only sports I can conjure, and I think I made one of those up (tennis). This is all about preparation. Thankfully, I have been training for this moment for an entire year by installing in my home a newborn child, who would helpfully scream in the middle of the night to get me ready for the Cup. Not everyone has this kind of dedication to the cause but luckily there are some tricks to get you over the line. There are two schools of thought for watching an early-morning game. Do you power on through the night or do you set the alarm early? This is a question with two important factors for you to consider deep down in your heart: how badly do you want to watch the game, and do you want to be sober while doing it?  You can set an alarm for 2am and nestle in to sleep, but we both know that you\u2019re lying to yourself. There is no way you are getting out of that bed when the alarm goes off. That\u2019s the same kind of wishful thinking alarm setting that people do when they\u2019ve convinced themselves they\u2019re going to get into jogging. You\u2019re not, you know you\u2019re not, you just feel like a good person when you set the alarm. Staying up all night sounds like the more fun option. It feels like a party. Plus, what\u2019s more fun than absolutely writing off a day before it has even begun? There\u2019s a beautiful kind of freedom in knowing before the sun rises that you absolutely will not be in a position to operate heavy machinery today. The risk of this is peaking too early. You go very hard through the night, have a great time, and then settle in for a long snooze around the 10-minute mark of the first half. Personally, I\u2019ve found that nothing keeps you awake quite like stone cold sobriety spiced up with abject dread. Read enough about the match that you\u2019ll truly fear you\u2019re about to ruin your night just to watch a 3-0 loss. If that starts to waver, remember some of the mistakes you\u2019ve made in your life, times you hurt others, thoughtless and awkward things you\u2019ve said at parties. That way, you can relax and have a good stare at the ceiling as the horrible guilt inside you helps you glide all the way to kick-off. Of course, if all of this fails and you sleep through the entire match, just tell your colleagues that you were boycotting the game for moral reasons. That way you get to keep the moral high ground while also seeming tedious enough that no one will ask you a follow-up question. Anyway, let me know how the game goes. I\u2019ll be sleeping, for moral reasons. \u2022 James Colley is a comedian and head writer for Gruen and Question Everything"

                    "body": "The Christmas ad season has kicked off with big retailers including Sainsbury\u2019s and Marks &amp; Spencer altering their plans as a consequence of the cost of living crisis. M&amp;S\u2019s clothing and home advert, which last year had an extravaganza inspired by Singin\u2019 in the Rain and Busby Berkeley\u2019s 1930s showgirls, this year puts charitable causes at the heart of its ad. The ad directed by The Greatest Showman director Michael Gracey, which will debut at 9pm on Friday on Channel 4 before Gogglebox, features beneficiaries of the retailer\u2019s \u00a31m donation to 1,000 community groups and good causes through the Neighbourly platform. Participants range from a Bolton brass band and a Bengali dance troupe to Kaotic Angels, a biker group made up of former uniformed personnel including soldiers and emergency workers, who provide meals on wheels and support for the veterans and homeless. The soundtrack features the Harry Styles song Treat People with Kindness. The retailer has also shifted its ad a few days earlier than last year, launching on the same day as Sainsbury\u2019s, which is putting out its ad a week earlier than previously. The supermarket chain\u2019s decision to go before Armistice Day for the first time in at least a decade came after it reported that cash-strapped customers are bringing forward purchases to spread the cost of the festive shop. Hefty inflation in the price of advertising spots in the run-up to Christmas, as the football World Cup and Black Friday combine with the traditional peak shopping season, are also thought to have played a part in some brands going early. As a result, M&amp;S and Sainsbury\u2019s are launching before John Lewis\u2019s ad next Thursday. The department store chain traditionally kicks off the Christmas season with its big-budget heartwarming campaigns.  Retailers are struggling to find the right tone for their annual promotional push as a surge in the cost of essentials including energy bills and food leaves many families short of cash, while others are keen to celebrate the first Christmas in two years without Covid restrictions. Anna Braithwaite, the M&amp;S clothing &amp; home marketing director, said it had started in planning its Christmas ad in May but \u201ctook our idea off the table\u201d and started again in June after it saw \u201cthe mood of nation had switched\u201d and they could not just focus on \u201cproduct and value\u201d. \u201cWe listen to our customers and we saw month by month that they were talking more about community and we switched to make sure we were reflecting that,\u201d she said. The discount grocer Lidl\u2019s Christmas ad also launches on Friday with a charity angle. It features a teddy bear who is the mascot of Lidl Bear\u2019s Toy Bank, a donation initiative in which new or unused toys and games will be passed on to children through the community social network Neighbourly. By contrast, Sainsbury\u2019s, Boots and others have stuck to big-budget ads that take viewers on a fantasy world where they can have a luxury Christmas treat. Sainsbury\u2019s has This Morning presenter and former Big Brother contestant Alison Hammond as a fairytale countess who puts the pressure on a minion to come up with an alternative to the traditional pudding. The ad is set to a \u201cBardcore\u201d medieval style cover of the noughties hit Teenage Dirtbag by Wheatus.  Boots\u2019s offering is fronted by It\u2019s a Sin and Year &amp; Years star Lydia West who finds a magical pair of glasses that allow her to see people\u2019s Christmas dreams. \u201cChristmas is the hardest brief of the year \u2013 it\u2019s a time people treasure and getting the tone right is essential,\u201d said Laurent Simon at the agency VMLY&amp;R London which helped create Boots\u2019s ad. \u201cThis year, it\u2019s been an even greater challenge as customers face worries about how they are going to pay for it. And while the tightening of belts and purse strings is a reality, we also know people still want to make Christmas magical and meaningful.\u201d In its second ever big-budget Christmas ad, Sports Direct goes for a skit on traditional rivals, but with a new spin linked to the Fifa World Cup which kicks off in Qatar on 20 November. The clips, all of which star former Manchester United player Eric Cantona, include a silver platter being placed on a heaving table of food, but when its domed cover is removed it reveals a football instead of a turkey."

                    "body": "A couple of days ago the France squad posed for a photo in which each player returned to their roots by donning the shirt of their first amateur team. For Olivier Giroud, now France\u2019s all-time male record goalscorer, it was the red of Froges Olympique Club, whose clubhouse 20km from Grenoble in south-east France is appropriately decorated for the World Cup. For Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, the man who will surely overtake him, it was the green of AS Bondy, a team in a northern suburb of Paris. Even on Giroud\u2019s big night, the masterful and electric Mbapp\u00e9 was able to muscle in on the headlines as France advanced to the quarter-finals.\nFor Mbapp\u00e9, a superstar aged 23 and already a world champion, only another 20 goals to go. A poster of Giroud accompanied with the words Au Coeur Les Bleus \u2013 the Blues in the heart \u2013 is pinned beneath bunting and a tricolour scarf in the poky Froges clubhouse. Children gathered there to watch France beat Denmark, an evening that belonged to Mbapp\u00e9, and although Mbapp\u00e9 got in on the act quite magnificently against Poland, this was an occasion Giroud will always cherish.\n\nMbapp\u00e9\u2019s strikes veered into the audacious. Giroud\u2019s goal on the verge of half-time was simple yet stunning. Giroud had a split-second or two to beat Wojciech Szczesny after quietly peeling off his marker, the centre-back Jakub Kiwior, and latching on to an incisive Mbapp\u00e9 through ball. Giroud controlled the pass with his first touch and then, without the slightest glance at goal, dug a left-footed shot into the far corner, leaving the ball to whirl around the Poland net as if in an arcade machine. It was his 52nd goal for France. He spelled out his achievement by raising five fingers on one hand and two on the other and then made a T with his hands, presumably in homage to Thierry Henry, whose record he eclipsed, before smiling and saluting towards the camera.\nA memorable night could have been sensational for Giroud had his acrobatic overhead kick been allowed to stand approaching the hour. A grinning Giroud politely approached the referee, Jes\u00fas Valenzuela, in vain as Matty Cash lay grounded. Giroud had thumped the ball into the net after Szczesny punched clear above Cash and Rapha\u00ebl Varane, who was sandwiched in between the Poland pair. Nine minutes later, not dispirited, Giroud went in search of another goal, flicking just wide at the front post from Jules Kound\u00e9\u2019s cross.\n\nGiroud soaked up the applause of a warm standing ovation from the France supporters and he was right to make the most of it, given the Mbapp\u00e9 brilliance that followed. Fresh from a 76-minute shift, the 36-year-old, surely the best-groomed man at this tournament, strolled towards the bench, still not a hair out of place. There was a warm embrace with Didier Deschamps before he made his way along the substitutes\u2019 bench, high-fiving his teammates as he went.\n\n\u201cGagner avec style\u201d read a cardboard sign cradled by a France supporter in a striped, Breton-style T-shirt and it was hard to argue. Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s first goal was sumptuous, a zinger high into the net after Giroud\u2019s decoy run occupied the Poland defence and afforded the Paris Saint-Germain forward time to pick his spot and lash in from the edge of the box. His second, from just inside the 18-yard box, was even more outrageous, inconceivably struck that little biteven harder into the top corner.\nRemember Karim Benzema, who took home the Ballon d\u2019Or in October, was supposed to be France\u2019s leading striker at this tournament. But when Benzema broke down in his first training session in Qatar because of a thigh problem, opportunity presented itself to Giroud. It was Benzema, of course, who once referred to Giroud as a \u201cgo-kart\u201d compared with his own Formula One car.\nGiroud had nine first-half touches, the fewest of any player on the pitch, but they were sufficient to reannounce himself as a killer in front of goal. He scored twice against Australia in their Group D opener. Mbapp\u00e9 has quickly mastered the same art but has other qualities that are impossible to ignore. At one point the big screens flashed up that Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s top speed was 35km/h, quick enough to earn a fine in a city centre but slow enough to avoid a dreary speed awareness course. At one point he left Cash on all fours and Bartosz Bereszynski in a spin. Another time he hared off the pitch and back on in hot pursuit of a loose ball.\n\nFor so long Giroud was seen as the supporting cast, for club and country. Even as a key cog in the France team that won this competition four years ago, he was disparaged in some quarters for failing to post a shot on target, let alone score. But he is a world champion, a Champions League winner, a Serie A winner, a Ligue 1 winner, a three-times FA Cup winner, a European Championship runner-up, and now France\u2019s male record goalscorer. Even in this most mouthwatering era of Mbapp\u00e9, it is right to sit up and take notice."

                    "body": "No African team has ever got this far at a World Cup but the Morocco head coach, Walid Regragui, said his team could have made it all the way to the final on Sunday \u2013 when he will be supporting France.\nThe Atlas Lions are the first team from the continent to reach the semi\u2011final, where they were defeated by goals from Th\u00e9o Hernandez and Randal Kolo Muani, with Regragui revealing that was the target he had set to continue as coach and insisting they must now always qualify for the competition. In the end, he said, this was a game too far for a team that were struggling physically.\n\nRegragui revealed he had no choice but to withdraw Nayef Aguerd just before kick\u2011off because of flu and then take off Romain Sa\u00efss only 20 minutes into the game, but he insisted he had no regrets over risking his captain, despite admitting it contributed to a \u201cpoor\u201d start.\n\u201cAt a World Cup this was perhaps one step too far. Not in terms of quality or tactics, but physically we came up short tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had too many players at 60% or 70%. With all our squad fit we could have caused them a lot of problems.\u201d\nMorocco caused plenty of problems even with their fitness issues, pushing France all the way to the line and outperforming them for much of the match. They had more of the ball, as many shots on target and hit the post during a second half in which they missed sufficient opportunities to have seen them through.\n\nIn the end, a goal five minutes in and another 10 minutes from the end defeated them.\n\u201cWe are disappointed for the Moroccan people tonight: we wanted to keep the dream alive,\u201d Regragui said.\n\u201cWe knew we had achieved something great already and that everyone was proud of us. We are pleased with what we have done but felt we could have gone even further. Those small details are what help real champions win and we saw that tonight. I told the players I was proud of them, his majesty is proud, the Moroccan people are proud, the whole world is proud. We worked hard, we were honest, and we showed the values we wanted to show.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to rewrite the history books and you can\u2019t do that with a miracle; it takes hard work. We have given a good account of African football and that mattered because we represent our country and our continent. People respected us before and maybe they will respect us even more now. We have to do even better in the future,\u201d he added.\n\u201cWe went further than Brazil, Spain, Germany, all top sides, but we have to show that regularly if we want Morocco to be on the world footballing map. We might never be as good as Brazil, France, England, but I would like us to qualify for every World Cup. We have proven that Africans can go toe to toe with top teams. We need to work hard to show that it is no accident.\u201d\nThe France head coach, Didier Deschamps, said his side would need to pay special attention to Lionel Messi after securing their place in a second successive World Cup final.\n\u201cMessi has been in scintillating form since the beginning of the tournament, four years ago things were different of course,\u201d Deschamps said. \u201cHe is picking up the ball a lot and he is running with it and looking in great form.\u201d"

                    "body": "The setting in a Northampton hotel breakfast bar is low key, and the conversation is relaxed, but there are many moments during an interview with Ronan O\u2019Gara when it feels like I am in the presence of a future great coach in Test rugby. The depth of his intelligence, curiosity and conviction is obvious but, beyond the gravitas, O\u2019Gara also has a light touch. When I ask him if, while turning La Rochelle into the champions of Europe last year, he sometimes had to be an actor to instil belief into a previously unfashionable club, he shakes his head in amusement. \u201cOne of my greatest strengths and weaknesses is that I can\u2019t act,\u201d O\u2019Gara says. His smile becomes steely as he stresses how this apparent failing sharpens the authenticity of his work. \u201cExactly. It\u2019s also very important because I\u2019ve seen previous coaches put on a mask or try and be something they\u2019re not. The people you coach are too smart to be fooled that way. But you have to remember we\u2019re playing sport. It\u2019s meant to be enjoyable and these are meant to be the best days of your life. We don\u2019t work. We play sport.\u201d  That sense of enjoyment taps into the rich variety of O\u2019Gara\u2019s first 10 years in coaching. After spending his whole career at Munster, where he made 240 appearances in 16 years, O\u2019Gara moved to Paris to start coaching at Racing. After four years he made another radical shift and flew to New Zealand to become the assistant coach of the Crusaders. Two seasons of Super Rugby transformed his outlook and he returned to France as head coach of La Rochelle in 2019. Last season he also became their director of rugby and took complete control as La Rochelle swept all before them in Europe. In the Champions Cup final they beat Leinster, who comprise most of the Ireland side, as O\u2019Gara\u2019s coaching credentials became even more striking. Having won 128 caps for Ireland, while scoring 1,083 Test match points. O\u2019Gara is steeped in Irish rugby. His success in France also means that there is already talk he might, one day, become the first foreigner to coach Les Bleus. And then, last November, he was courted by the RFU as they met him to discuss his interest in coaching England. O\u2019Gara is still intrigued by the England job but he remains fiercely committed to La Rochelle for the foreseeable future. \u201cWhat I\u2019m doing now is incredibly satisfying,\u201d O\u2019Gara says, \u201cbut a bit of me would love to have a crack at a World Cup. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s unattainable or unreachable. If you produce at club level, the obvious step is you go on to produce at Test level.\u201d  Such clear ambition in O\u2019Gara is intensified as we approach a new Six Nations. The grand old tournament is made even more enticing by the fact that, this year, it offers a sizeable step towards the World Cup which begins in France in September. Ireland and France lead the current world rankings and their clash in Dublin, a week on Saturday, will be fascinating. O\u2019Gara believes that New Zealand and England will be just behind them when the World Cup begins. He leans forward when asked if it is too soon to decide whether Ireland or France are in better shape. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not too early at all. At the Stade de France, the last time they played, France blew Ireland off the pitch for the early parts of the game and then the Irish fitness and organisation started to bear fruit. Ireland had a chance to win the game late on. Even considering how good France are, I would still probably fancy Ireland to win in the Aviva. But there\u2019d be very little in it. I think these are two absolute quality teams and it\u2019ll just be interesting to see from a strategy point of view how they go about breaking each other down because there are very few weaknesses on either side.\u201d In World Cup terms O\u2019Gara favours the French. \u201cThere\u2019s massive excitement already and we know that France, with full grounds and their nation behind them, do sporting events very well. If you ask who are favourites then, for me, it\u2019s France. They have a lot going for them especially if you take the travel factor away which, for the French, is big. They\u2019re very at ease on their own patch.\u201d The rise of Ireland has been thrilling for O\u2019Gara but, in beating Leinster in the European final last year, La Rochelle showed a way to conquer the world\u2019s leading team. How many Leinster players from that day will start in the Six Nations? \u201cThirteen, maybe?\u201d O\u2019Gara says. \u201cBut there\u2019s 20 [Leinster players] now for this [Six Nations] camp.\u201d Did he have to do a lot of work in preparing La Rochelle, psychologically, for the challenge of playing a club that was virtually a Test team on its way to becoming the leading nation in international rugby? \u201cIt\u2019s a fascinating question,\u201d O\u2019Gara says as he strips back the layers surrounding the French rugby psyche. \u201cWe got Montpellier at home in the quarter-final and the boys were all wishing we were going to Harlequins. They don\u2019t like French on French but, for me, I was thinking, home advantage is huge. We had beaten Leinster [at home] in the semi-final the year previously. It was Covid times but, if you dissect that game, the better team won. \u201cThere was an enormous support behind Leinster for the final but we believed in our plan on how we go about depowering them. I knew our attack would work well but it\u2019s the other 50%, how you depower an attack, that for me is very important. In every lineout situation, when you have Pierre Bourgarit and Jonathan Danty looking after the first collision, and Uini Atonio and Greg Alldritt on the second collision, it\u2019s hard to win the gain line against these guys. I also don\u2019t think there\u2019s an international team in the world with the amount of poachers we have. We have Danty, [Levani] Botia, Alldritt, Atonio, Bourgarit and Will Skelton who is good at it too. There\u2019re about seven of them and no other team has that. These boys are powerful.\u201d  France have the physicality to match Ireland but, as O\u2019Gara suggests, so much hinges on their brilliant scrum-half, Antoine Dupont. \u201cIf Dupont doesn\u2019t play for France?\u201d O\u2019Gara says, shrugging. \u201cFor me he\u2019s nearly 30% of them. He\u2019s so special. It\u2019s different with Ireland. Johnny [Sexton] is an excellent player but he wouldn\u2019t have the capacity to do what Dupont can do on a rugby pitch. But the gulf to the next [Irish No 10] is very big, which puts pressure on [Sexton]. In France you\u2019re still spoilt for choice at 9.\u201d In O\u2019Gara\u2019s old position at 10, France have Romain Ntamack who is only 23 but, in the Irishman\u2019s view, \u201cvery mature. It\u2019ll be interesting because France seem to go away a lot from their capacity to strike from anywhere. It\u2019s fascinating how a lot of the data suggests if you kick the ball more and longer you\u2019ve a far greater chance of winning. In certain games [the French wing Damian] Penaud wanted to attack but you could see him thinking of what he was told in the week: \u2018You\u2019ve got to kick.\u2019 That\u2019s not a strength of his game. Of course you have to respect the support [staff] and listen to what the data is telling you. But I know there are certain scenarios where the French could just put the foot down and play.\u201d Ireland are underpinned by their exemplary coaching group. \u201c[Head coach] Andy Farrell has an excellent temperament. [Forwards coach] Paul O\u2019Connell is unique, very special. [Defence coach] Simon Easterby is a really good guy. [Scrum coach] John Fogarty has really great human traits. I went on a Lions tour with [attack coach] Mike Catt and he\u2019s a good guy with the experience of coaching Italy which means he learned enormous resilience and the capacity to grow in adversity. He now has really good cattle to work with and Ireland look more threatening with the ball than they have in the past.\u201d Ireland, however, do not have the playing resources of France and England and so, for O\u2019Gara, \u201cit will be interesting to see their capacity to respond if their strength in depth is tested. Their top 25 are very strong. But they need those players [to stay fit].\u201d Is Ireland against France the Six Nations\u2019s pivotal match? \u201cNo, because France also have England away. England most definitely have the firepower to trouble whoever they play. And with a new coach [in Steve Borthwick] their players realise that now is my time to make my mark. [Manu] Tuilagi is interesting for them and he probably sends fear into the opposition. He has a big presence. If he\u2019s missing, England feel it. But there are a lot of back three and half-back options. They\u2019ll be competitive and dogged up front.\u201d O\u2019Gara feels that England \u201con a dry day could easily play [Marcus] Smith and [Owen] Farrell together. But no matter how skilled top players are, when it pisses out of the heavens and there\u2019s a wind you have to think about catch and pass and its advantage defence.\u201d He makes it clear that, whatever the conditions, \u201cI would set my team up on Farrell. Some competitors just stand out. I like guys who prepare to win \u2013 and Farrell does. I\u2019d love to get inside that mind to see what I could stimulate but that boat will have sailed for me, unfortunately.\u201d How close was O\u2019Gara to the England job? \u201cI don\u2019t know the percentage but it caused a lot of interest, even disbelief [that he would consider coaching England]. I couldn\u2019t be prouder of where I come from, from Cork in Ireland. But then you become a professional coach and the competitor in you wants to coach the best players and have the opportunity to win the highest competitions in the world. It doesn\u2019t dilute anything about me if I coach England. I would still be very proud of where I\u2019m from, but it\u2019s a job with an enormous excitement factor. The same as the Ireland job, same as coaching the All Blacks.\u201d  Ireland might be his first choice but would he also like to coach France one day? \u201cI\u2019d love to, yeah. Such strength, depth and quality, passionate supporters, great country. I don\u2019t know if it would ever happen because I don\u2019t know if they can [choose a foreign coach]. But all these rules are broken nowadays.\u201d For now, O\u2019Gara\u2019s focus remains fixed on La Rochelle where his new contract runs until 2027. \u201cI won\u2019t be going anywhere after this World Cup \u2013 that\u2019s for certain. The reality is that Andy Farrell has done an excellent job so he\u2019ll be with Ireland and I have this great project in La Rochelle.\u201d But an intriguing Six Nations, and a looming World Cup, will sharpen O\u2019Gara\u2019s voracious appetite. Watching Ireland, France and England, and knowing that he could coach any one of them in the future, will make him study the game he loves even more deeply. Test rugby\u2019s next great coach is on his way to the world stage."

                    "body": "One of Coventry\u2019s best-known historical figures is Lady Godiva who, as legend tells it, famously rode through the English city naked on horseback in protest at high taxes in the 11th century. On Friday night it was the Kangaroos who stormed through the town, fully dressed of course, and caught the eye as they slaughtered Scotland 84-0 in their second Rugby League World Cup match. It was a result never really in doubt in the wet West Midlands, considering the gulf between the defending World Cup holders and the minnow Bravehearts, who rely largely on lower league players of English and Antipodean heritage. The two countries have only ever played once before, back in the 2016 Four Nations in Hull, and that fixture ended in a similarly one-sided 54-12 victory.  But this time the damage was a lot more severe, with Australia piling on seven tries in the first half and eight more in the second. Nathan Cleary finished with a personal total of 28 points, with a try and 12 goals to his name, while Josh Addo-Carr claimed four tries and Campbell Graham notched a hat-trick. Coach Mal Meninga rang the changes before the game, handing debuts to Matt Burton, Graham, Cleary, Liam Martin, Isaah Yeo and Lindsay Collins. Considering the Kangaroos\u2019 back-up halfback at this point is Cleary, it is a strength in depth that Meninga\u2019s counterpart Nathan Graham could only dream of. Before the match kicked off a minute\u2019s silence was held for Redcliffe player Liam Hampson, who was found dead in Barcelona nightclub earlier this week. Hampson was traveling with several NRL players in Spain and is a friend of Kangaroos prop Patrick Cadigan. A poor start from Scotland at the sodden Coventry Building Society Arena, who accidentally took the ball into touch from the kick-off, set the tone. This handed Australia a set on the Scots\u2019 try-line, and almost a try after 70 seconds through a kick, but Alex Walker managed to ground the ball before Cleary could lay a hand on it. It took five minutes for the Kangaroos to open the scoring, as Cleary floated a ball out wide for Addo-Carr to score in the corner. The halfback could not add the extras from the sideline, but his team had poked ahead 4-0. It went to 8-0 six minutes later, when Jack Wighton brushed past some soft defence to touch down and the Penrith playmaker made no mistake this time, as the scoreboard started to move into overdrive. In the 15th minute Lachlan Walmsley spilled a Cleary bomb and Angus Crichton pounced for the third try. It was a point a minute as Cleary made it 16-0. The Panthers star\u2019s clinical kicking game was killing the Scots, with Matty Russell dropping one in the slippery conditions and forcing a drop-out. Then it was Graham, who would have been playing for Scotland at this World Cup through his Glaswegian father if not for a late call-up from Meninga, who barged over for Australia\u2019s fourth try. The Bravehearts started falling off more and more tackles, and soon it was Cleary who grabbed a soft try between the sticks before converting his own four-pointer. Four minutes later Addo-Carr secured his second, displaying his trademark pace, and then Wighton notched his own double thanks to Harry Grant\u2019s pass. It was 40-0 at half-time and the break came as blessed relief to Scotland. But the battering continued in the second half unabated, taking just 55 seconds for James Tedesco to cross.  Ben Hunt was the next to get on the scoreboard, running in off Cameron Munster\u2019s pass, before Addo-Carr secured his third of the night. Cleary kept the lead ticking over, as the Bravehearts\u2019 Kane Linnett was sin-binned for tackling Tedesco off the ball, with further tries coming to Burton, Yeo, Addo-Carr again and Graham twice. With a mammoth 28 points in his first-ever Kangaroos appearance, the key question now is whether Meninga sticks with Cleary against Italy and for the rest of the tournament as his first-choice halfback, or plumps for rival Daly Cherry-Evans. That is the only potential concern for the Australian boss on a rainy night of green and gold World Cup dominance."

                    "body": "Yes, Brazil: that\u2019s pretty much how we remembered you. This is a new generation of Brazilian players, a new era and a new World Cup challenge. And yet by the same token this was a classic Brazilian tournament performance: the sort that feels as if it is being put on for our benefit. On a still night in the giant golden ark of the Lusail Stadium, the tournament favourites played the game you expect from tournament favourites: solid, expansive and embellished with the sort of effortless brilliance that makes other countries furrow their brow a little.\nThe match had three distinct periods. In period one Brazil started pretty tamely, perhaps even uncertainly, picking away at Serbia with tempo but not a great deal of poise. As the second half progressed they began to warm to the task, cathartically breaking the deadlock with a goal from Richarlison. In the final half hour they simply cut loose: riotous skills, relentless waves of attack and an early goal of the tournament contender from Richarlison, who scored his second with an outrageous bicycle kick.\nIt was Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior and Neymar who combined for Richarlison\u2019s goals, and this trio \u2013 with Raphinha also plugging away gamely on the right \u2013 look on early evidence like the most balanced and deadly attack in Qatar: pure trickery and pure speed, with a sharp cutting tool up front. Casemiro was a masterful string-puller at the base of midfield.\n\nAlex Sandro had a superb game at left-back, which was reckoned to be one of Brazil\u2019s problem areas. Serbia were actually pretty good for 45 minutes. By the end, however, they looked not just beaten but broken, having been made to chase light beams.\nAnd it is not as if Brazil are automatic favourites to win these sorts of games any more. Their World Cup record against European teams since 2010 now reads: played nine, won three, drew two, lost four. Every tournament they seem to sweat a little more, fight a little harder, stand out a little less.\n\nBut this, perhaps, was a reminder that Brazil are at their best when they play with that little dash of imperial arrogance, the fearlessness and verve that pokes teams in the chest and asks: well, how many stars on your badge?\nAnd of course, they can play with a little bit of devil too. Serbia got the sort of game they wanted: aggressive, physical, spicy and often spiky. Neymar got his usual kicking for being Neymar, and ended up limping off 10 minutes from time. But no team with Casemiro, Thiago Silva, Richarlison and Raphinha in its ranks is ever going to shirk from a battle. At one point Raphinha tackled Filip Mladenovic and then simply glared at him, just to make sure he knew he had been tackled. \n\nMeanwhile Andrija Zivkovic was sticking to Vin\u00edcius like an environmental activist gluing himself to a London road junction. Vin\u00edcius came a little deeper. Zivkovic followed. Vin\u00edcius drifted right to the touchline. Zivkovic followed. Vin\u00edcius tracked inside. Zivkovic followed. Later that night, as an exhausted Vin\u00edcius climbed into bed at the Westin Doha Hotel, he would find Zivkovic already in there waiting for him, a despicable smile creasing across his face as he rolled over and took most of the duvet with him.\n\nFew chances, then, but some moments of promise for Brazil. And like the stubborn pistachio at the bottom of the bag, Brazil probed and scraped and prised and pulled, and eventually worked Serbia loose. There had been openings for Neymar and Sandro before finally Neymar coaxed the ball into the penalty area with a delicious drop of the shoulder. Vin\u00edcius took over and curled a shot at Vanja Milinkovic-Savic; Richarlison cleaned up the rebound.\n\nAnd for the rest of the game Brazil were simply inexorable. Casemiro rattled the bar. Tite flexed some of the awe-inspiring muscle on his bench: Rodrygo, Antony, Gabriel Martinelli.\nBut the game had already seen its crowning moment. With 11 minutes remaining, Vin\u00edcius nonchalantly teased over a cross with the outside of the boot. Richarlison flicked the ball up in the air with his toe, flung himself skywards, his blond head rotating on its axis like a light show, before smashing the ball in with a pure capoeira swipe: a goal straight out of a soft drink advert, filmed in one clean take.\nTite talks a lot about balance: between attack and defence, flair and resilience, exuberance and focus. This was a performance to make flesh out of his words. If one was being critical, perhaps Brazil could have made a little more of their dominance later on. But really that would be griping for the sake of it. Three points, broad smiles and a familiar swagger that felt like a favourite band playing all their old hits. Welcome back, lads."

                    "body": "Tweets hurling racist abuse at footballers, including the N-word, monkey emojis and calls for them to be deported, are not being removed by Twitter. New research shows the platform failed to act on 99 out of 100 racist tweets reported to it in the week before the World Cup. Only one was removed after being flagged on Wednesday, a tweet that repeated a racial slur 16 times. All the others remained live this weekend. The abuse was aimed at 43 players including England stars Raheem Sterling and Bukayo Saka, who were among several players targeted after the Euro 2020 final. The analysis, conducted by researchers at the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) and seen by the Observer, included 100 tweets reported to Twitter. Of those, 11 used the N-word to describe footballers, 25 used monkey or banana emojis directed at players, 13 called for players to be deported, and 25 attacked players by telling them to \u201cgo back to\u201d other countries. Thirteen tweets targeted footballers over their English skills. The findings come at a turbulent time for Twitter and will fuel concerns about players possibly being targeted during the World Cup. Thousands of staff have left the company since Elon Musk\u2019s take-over on 27 October. Musk has insisted that moderation capabilities remain strong and that he is committed to preventing the platform from becoming a \u201cfree-for-all hellscape\u201d. In an update to the platform\u2019s rules on hate speech last week, however, Musk said \u201cnegative/hate tweets\u201d would be \u201cdeboosted &amp; demonetized\u201d, but not necessarily removed. He added that users \u201cwon\u2019t find the tweet unless you specifically seek it out, which is no different from the rest of [the] internet\u201d. It is unclear how this will be applied to abuse that tags individuals or mentions them by name, who are likely to see the post without seeking it out.  All the tweets identified in the CCDH\u2019s analysis mentioned footballers by name or tagged their Twitter handle. Many were posts beneath official tweets from football clubs or news sites. They included tweets telling footballers to \u201cgo back to Africa\u201d, likening players to apes and chimps and calling for them to be deported. The tweets were flagged through Twitter\u2019s in-app reporting tool. Twitter was contacted for comment but did not respond. It has laid off much of its communications team. The content policy currently on its website says it prohibits \u201ctargeting others with repeated slurs\u201d and that in cases of \u201csevere, repetitive usage of slurs, where the primary intent is to harass\u201d, tweets may be removed. It also prohibits \u201cdehumanisation\u201d of a group of people based on characteristics including race."

A video of the Wales squad jumping for joy and huddling together as England\u2019s players fell to the floor like dominoes went viral. England\u2019s relegation from the Nations League is incomparable and neither were Wales, 67 days out from when they collide in their final Group B match at the Ahmad bin Ali Stadium, ever going to contemplate a repeat of those scenes, which, it is fair to say, received mixed reviews.  It is five long games without a win for England and four for Wales but the latter undeniably find themselves in a good spot before hosting Poland on Sunday, encouraged by a strong second-half performance in Thursday\u2019s defeat to Belgium, No 2 in the Fifa rankings. Then there is the small matter of a trip to Qatar and a first World Cup in 64 years on the horizon. Wales\u2019 first Group B opponent, the USA, have also not convinced of late and slipped to defeat to Japan on Friday but Gareth Bale is not reading too much into their rivals\u2019 recent hiccups. \u201cPeople will up their games, players might not be playing well but in two months\u2019 time they\u2019ll be playing better,\u201d Bale, the Wales captain, says. Rob Page, the Wales manager, watched England\u2019s defeat to Italy with his staff in Cardiff and is flying to Spain next week to watch USA take on Saudi Arabia in their final warm-up match. Ultimately, however, he knows Wales have to get their own house in order. \u201cI\u2019m surprised in how the group has panned out,\u201d Page says of England, who entertain Germany at Wembley on Monday. \u201cThey were up against a very good Italian team who could have scored a couple of more goals. You\u2019re always surprised when England don\u2019t do so well because of the expectations they have put on themselves over the years but that\u2019s for them to worry about and deal with now.  \u201cWe\u2019ve got a job in hand that we\u2019re fully focused on. As soon as the final whistle has gone we\u2019ll be preparing for the World Cup.\u201d Page will be forced into at least two changes for Poland\u2019s visit, with Ethan Ampadu and Chris Mepham both suspended, while Bale is likely to return to the starting lineup. Page insists there will be no surprises when the teams are read aloud an hour before kick-off at the Cardiff City Stadium. Bale is yet to complete 90 minutes since joining Los Angeles FC in the summer but feels he is slowly edging towards peak condition. \u201cI am closer than I have been in the last few years, for sure,\u201d Bale says. \u201cIt\u2019s about playing minutes and games and I\u2019m starting to do that a lot more often now. \u201cThe more I play, the fitter I\u2019ll get. Hopefully, I can start to peak and get stronger and stronger as quickly as possible.\u201d Bale\u2019s condition has been aided by regular dialogue between LAFC and the Football Association of Wales\u2019 medical team. The Wales physio, Sean Connelly, was invited to Los Angeles within a week of Bale moving stateside. \u201cThey have a great relationship and they\u2019ve both reached out to each other to make sure communication is good and what I\u2019m doing are the correct things and not things I shouldn\u2019t be doing,\u201d Bale says. \u201cThe FAW have always done what\u2019s best for me and what I need so I suppose it\u2019s a good thing they\u2019ve got a great relationship already.\u201d Wales are bottom of Nations League Group 4 League A and must beat Poland to stay in the top tier. The obvious caveat to their position is that they were playing with one hand tied behind their back in June because what proved to be a historic World Cup playoff win over Ukraine understandably took precedence. That Wales were so disappointed with a slender defeat in Brussels shows the confidence in the camp. \u201cWe are playing against big teams every week now and we\u2019re always competing with them,\u201d Bale says. \u201cWe\u2019re always in the games and that can only be a testament to us. We\u2019re definitely on the right trajectory, we\u2019re definitely improving and that is the direction we want to continue to go in.\u201d"

                    "body": "Japan\u2019s first victory against Germany sent a seismic jolt through the World Cup and was reward for the courage shown by Hajime Moriyasu. The Japan coach wrested this Group E opener his side\u2019s way with a series of second\u2011half substitutions that transformed the contest and consigned Germany to defeat in their opening World Cup match for a second consecutive tournament.\nFour years ago in Russia a Hirving Lozano strike gave Mexico a famous win against the four-time champions. On Wednesday it was Takuma Asano of the Bundesliga\u2019s Bochum who sent the vocal Japanese fans at Khalifa International Stadium into ecstasy along with his teammates and the rest of the squad who flooded on to the pitch to celebrate his 83rd\u2011minute winner.\nAsano, one of Moriyasu\u2019s five replacements, took down a floating ball expertly along the right, outmuscled Nico Schlotterbeck and, after racing in on Manuel Neuer\u2019s goal, rifled in, the Germany captain appearing to shy away from throwing his frame squarely in the way.\n\nMinutes earlier Ritsu Doan, another substitute, had equalised Ilkay G\u00fcndogan\u2019s first-half penalty and Doan seemed to have a fair shout for a spot-kick of his own when Antonio R\u00fcdiger bundled him over. Although Germany pressed until the end \u2013 Neuer joined one attack in added time \u2013 they could not break down the blue wall before them and, after the shock Saudi Arabia victory against Argentina on Tuesday, Qatar 2022 now has this upset, greeted at the final whistle with delirium by Japan. All of this with 26.2% possession, which underlines the truism concerning it being all about what is done with the ball.\nJapan had offered an early warning when their speedy right-winger Junya Ito broke along the flank and teed up Daizen Maeda, who scored but was correctly adjudged offside. From this juncture, though, until the hour Germany dominated. From his midfield berth Joshua Kimmich controlled proceedings while G\u00fcndogan was in total football mode, decorating the game with his coolly taken penalty and long-range shots and passes, plus a willingness to charge back into his area as he did twice before the break.\n\nAfter Shuichi Gonda pushed one David Raum cross directly into G\u00fcndogan\u2019s path and he unloaded only for the veteran defender Maya Yoshida to make a superb block, G\u00fcndogan\u2019s spot-kick arrived. Gonda twice felled the left\u2011back in the area \u2013 the second time when Raum popped straight back up \u2013 and the referee, Iv\u00e1n Arcides Barton Cisneros, awarded the kick. G\u00fcndogan beat Gonda and Germany were now at their fluid best, Jamal Musiala\u2019s quick feet and clever distribution from the left adding further swagger to that of Kimmich, G\u00fcndogan and Thomas M\u00fcller.\nIn a flash Musiala found space but blazed over, the 19-year-old\u2019s profligacy just one example of what proved so costly. Japan wanted the half-time whistle as Germany were so rampant, with Kai Havertz\u2019s added-time strike rubbed out for offside.\nBut the whistle came and so did Moriyasu\u2019s fresh introductions, starting with Takehiro Tomiyasu at the break and followed by Kaoru Mitoma and Asano (57 minutes), Doan (71) and Takumi Minamino (74). All were to prove telling as, with an hour gone, suddenly Japan were punching holes in Germany. Before Doan\u2019s equaliser Gonda made a dazzling quadruple save, the first from Jonas Hofmann\u2019s attempt, then from Serge Gnabry who saw a header and two shots repelled by the goalkeeper.\n\nNext, Neuer beat out an Ito volley and the running-in Hiroki Sakai lashed the rebound wildly over before Doan struck. Three substitutes combined: Mitoma fed Minamino whose cross\u2011shot was palmed by Neuer to Doan, and he smashed the ball into the roof of the net.\nGermany were punch-drunk. From the right Ko Itakura swept the ball along his corridor and there was Asano to take over, his surge forward then finish a moment sure to be repeated endlessly both in his homeland and across the world.\nGermany were all but gone. In the seven minutes of extra time they screamed for a second penalty when Niclas F\u00fcllkrug went down: this was as desperate as the 35-yard attempt from R\u00fcdiger and summed up how bedraggled Hansi Flick\u2019s side had become. At the final whistle Japan were in dreamland and Germany were facing having to beat Spain on Sunday to retain control of thei World Cupr destiny.\n\nAll of this occurred after Flick\u2019s players posed for the team photograph with a collective hand\u2011over\u2011mouth \u201cgagged\u201d gesture and the German interior minister, Nancy Faeser, wore a OneLove armband \u2013 which stands for tolerance, diversity and LGBTQ+ rights \u2013 as she sat with Gianni Infantino in a clear act of defiance to the Fifa president and his organisation. It followed the governing body ordering seven European nations, including England, that their captains should not wear the armband. \nIt will be intriguing to see what stance Harry Kane and his teammates take in their next game \u2013 versus the USA on Friday \u2013 but this late afternoon in Doha belonged to Japan, headed by Moriyasu, who was applauded into the post-game media briefing by Japanese journalists.\nHe and his team deserve copious praise. As Gonda said: \u201cI think this Japan team has character. We would like to go to the quarter-final; that is our goal.\u201d Next for them are Costa Rica who, after this display, will not relish Sunday\u2019s meeting."

co-host of Their Pitch How they made their choices \u2022 Our judges were sent a longlist of footballers drawn from leagues on every continent and asked one question: who have been the best female players in the world in 2022? \u2022 We asked our judges to choose 40 names each, and rank their selection in order from 1-40, No 1 being their choice of the best player this year. How the voting works \u2022 The No 1 choice of each judge was awarded 40pts, No 2 given 39pts, down to 1pt for their No 40 choice. All the votes were added together to give a raw score. \u2022 To minimise the influence of outliers, the highest score awarded to a player was then deducted to give a final score. \u2022 A player needed to receive votes from at least five judges to qualify. \u2022 If players are level on points in the scoring, the number of individual votes cast is used as a tie-breaker. Voting disclosure \u2022 We are very grateful to our judges for taking part, and none have been paid for participating. \u2022 To allow our judges the freedom to express their opinions without fear or favour, individual voting records are anonymised."

                    "body": "Good morning. University education has come a long way from the stereotype of drunken students and aloof, coddled lecturers. These days, students are tee-total eager beavers, desperate to justify their on average \u00a345,000 debt, while their lecturers are more likely to be using food banks than supping on vintage port. It is this hardship that has led university staff to become the latest group of workers to have begun industrial action in the UK. 70,000 lecturers, librarians and researchers across 150 universities are taking part in three days of strikes that could impact up to 2.5 million students. It\u2019s potentially the biggest, but certainly not the first, strike in higher education. Staff have been complaining for years about burnout, stagnating wages, precarious working conditions, and pensions. And now the University and College Union (UCU) have said that their members have had enough. The working conditions and poor pay have led to reports of junior academics on short-term contracts and low-paid members of staff like cleaners having to use food banks, while some of the institutions they work for hold billions of pounds in surplus, and pay senior administrators six-figure salaries. These strikes will probably bring the sector to a standstill and for students who are in their final year of a university degree plagued by disruption from the pandemic, this will only further add to their woe. I spoke to the Guardian\u2019s education editor, Richard Adams, about what has led to this moment. That\u2019s right after the headlines. Five big stories  NHS | Hospitals are facing the \u201cperfect winter storm\u201d following reports that there are 10 times more people being admitted to the hospital with the flu than this time last year. Data also revealed access to A&amp;E was delayed by at least half an hour for almost a third of patients arriving by ambulance. Immigration | Net migration has risen to a record high of 504,000 because of government schemes for Ukrainians and Hong Kongers, and a significant increase in international students. The figure is at least 400,000 higher than the government had been aiming for. Child protection | A review into the murder of five-year-old Logan Mwangi by his mother, her partner and stepson has found there was a lack of care and curiosity around the challenges Logan was facing at home. The report noted that the issues raised in the case could be \u201csystemic\u201d. Schools | A poll conducted by Unison found that a significant number of school support staff are helping students pay for food, stationery and uniforms, despite being among the lowest paid workers in the sector themselves. Internet safety | The government has announced that nonconsensual \u201cdeepfake\u201d pornography and explicit photography taken through hidden cameras, including \u201cdownblousing\u201d, will be made illegal when the online safety bill returns to parliament next month. Those who share these images or videos could be jailed.  In depth: \u2018The notion a professor does a bit of research and gets a nice paycheck is completely out of date\u2019  As the landscape of higher education has changed, the UCU has become a more politicised union, that uses social media to mobilise its members. And its tactics have been successful. These strikes are potentially the biggest ever in the higher education sector \u2013 the UCU is the only education union so far that has been able to get a national mandate for a strike. Will this pressure be enough to provoke real change? *** Four years of friction University staff have been in bitter disputes with upper management since 2018. The strikes initially erupted as a result of proposed cuts to pensions, but in the last two years the issues of precarious employment for young staff and low wages have become central complaints. \u201cWhen it was restricted to pensions only members who were part of the university superannuation scheme were affected,\u201d Richard explains, meaning that the old polytechnics that became universities in 1992 and who are largely signed up to a different pension scheme had little reason to join the strikes. \u201cIt meant that it was really only an issue for the older universities. But this wave of strikes have got much wider leverage.\u201d  *** The marketisation of education When \u00a39,250 annual tuition fees were introduced, it was feared that enthusiasm for university education would wane among the young. If anything, the opposite has happened. In 2021, record levels of students were accepted into university \u2013 and yet universities have largely not increased staff numbers, leaving those employed horribly overworked. Meanwhile, others are worried about their entire departments being axed in line with government policy that seeks to cut \u201cdead end courses\u201d \u2013 often seen as humanity subjects that have less of a direct connection to onward employment. The marketisation of higher education hasn\u2019t just impacted the competition for students \u2013 it\u2019s also changed the way that academics fund their research. \u201cThe notion that somebody who\u2019s a lecturer or a professor gets a nice paycheck and just gives lectures and does a bit of research is completely out of date,\u201d Richard says. \u201cAcademic careers are now very entrepreneurial and portfolio based.\u201d This is all while pay for academic staff has fallen 20% in real terms over the last decade \u2013 for staff who have joined the industry in this time, pay has been even worse with the introduction of the mass casualisation of employment in higher education \u2013 with only a lucky few given permanent, long-term contracts. \u201cMarketisation has penetrated the institutions themselves,\u201d Richard says. Even though pay packets for most staff have not increased, those who are striking point to the rising wages of vice-chancellors (the principle academic and administrative position) who on average are paid \u00a3269,000 a year. *** List of demands The UCU has been clear about what it wants for its members: a pay rise of 2% over inflation (RPI) or 12%, whichever ends up being higher; an end to casualisation and excessive workloads that lead to hours of unpaid labour; and action to end racial and gender inequality. Things have gotten so fraught that the UCU has said they are willing to strike again in the new year if universities do not meet their demands. While many agree that this disruption is terrible for learning, the UCU has said that striking staff have the mass support of students, with the National Union of Students publicly backing the strikes. The Universities and Colleges Employers Association have said they are disappointed that it has come to this, however to many UCU members these strikes are just as much the universities\u2019 choice as it is theirs. There is a battle going on for the future higher education in the UK. One option would see it transform completely into a market-based system where each institution functions primarily as a business \u2013 which seems to be the current direction of travel. But there are those who still see the primary purpose for higher education not as profit, financial competition, or to provide a steady stream of \u201chigh-skilled workers\u201d. Instead it is a space where people can innovate, learn, research, and yes \u2013 perhaps even enjoy the odd drink with friends.

                    "body": "Canada\u2019s preparations for this year\u2019s World Cup were plunged into further turmoil as players went on a de-facto strike in Vancouver ahead of the country\u2019s hastily re-arranged friendly with Panama on Sunday.  John Herdman\u2019s squad refused to train on both Friday and Saturday in an apparent protest over compensation and player perks for Qatar 2022, with months of fruitless talks reaching a head. The players and Canada Soccer are reportedly still markedly apart on demands with an initial report from TSN suggesting the players had asked for a 40% cut of World Cup revenues with the association offering just 10% of a Fifa windfall that is likely in the $10-15 million range.   Fresh from the debacle sparked by Canada Soccer initially arranging a friendly against Iran, two years after 85 Canadian citizens and permanent residents were killed when a passenger plane was shot down by Iranian forces shortly after leaving Tehran, the weekend\u2019s startling developments brought further ignominy on an association long blighted by dysfunction and underperformance.  Herdman defied expectation and history to guide the Canadian men to their first World Cup berth in 36 years, the team spearheaded by exciting young talent like Alphonso Davies and Jonathan David topping Concacaf qualification and winning a huge wave of new fans along the way. Sunday\u2019s friendly was due to be the team\u2019s first reappearance on home soil since they sealed qualification against Jamaica in Toronto in March. However the fate of the game, scheduled to kick off at 4pm local time (7pm Eastern), remained unclear.  The team had been due to train at the Vancouver Whitecaps\u2019 base at the University of British Columbia early Friday afternoon. With less than an hour\u2019s notice, that session was pushed back by almost three hours before being later cancelled entirely. Saturday\u2019s training session was also scrapped. The standoff comes soon after the US Soccer Federation reached a groundbreaking deal with its men\u2019s and women\u2019s national teams that will see them share revenue from their respective World Cup campaigns and be paid identical amounts for appearances and wins. That agreement will see American players take a combined cut of over 80% from World Cup revenue.  Late Saturday night, Canada Soccer disputed the initial reports and said it has proposed that the men\u2019s team would take a 30% cut of prize money with the same amount going to the women\u2019s team and the association taking the remaining 40%. \u201cTo be clear, the Men\u2019s National Team demand was for 75-100 per cent of the World Cup prize money,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Association, in an effort to adhere to the principle of pay equity, proposed 60 per cent of the Fifa World Cup prize money to be split between the two National Teams.\u201d That player sources and association sources are indicating wildly different demands and offers only served to emphasize how messy the situation is. Players are reportedly also irked that they will receive just two complimentary tickets each for their games in Qatar and families will have to pay their own way. Canada Soccer president Nick Bontis and its interim deputy general secretary flew into Vancouver late Saturday evening with Sunday\u2019s game still very much in doubt.  The embarrassing mishandling of the Iran booking had left Herdman and his squad with a three-game window that contained only Concacaf opposition, Panama followed by Nations League games against Curacao here in Vancouver and an away date with Honduras. By contrast Canada\u2019s Group F opponents Belgium, Croatia and Morocco were all testing themselves against fellow World Cup opposition in this window. Continental rivals Mexico and the US had both booked a pair of friendlies against qualified teams.  \u201cEvery minute together is crucial as we prepare to work collectively to give us the best chance to perform against some of the world\u2019s best on the biggest stage,\u201d Herdman said in advance of the Panama game, which had been due to see Davies\u2019 return to a Canada shirt for the first time in 2022 and potentially a first cap for exciting teenager Luca Koleosho, who recently made his La Liga debut for Espanyol. Herdman\u2019s achievements at the helm came on the back of some herculean solo work sourcing and assembling a support staff. But hints that the association wasn\u2019t moving in step with huge strides on the field appeared. Combined with the women\u2019s gold medal glory in Tokyo last summer, the men\u2019s progress had created a huge demand from fans for Canada replica kits but they remained out of stock for a signifiant time. Former Canadian goalkeeper Craig Forrest had told the Guardian this week that Canada Soccer \u201cfelt understaffed\u201d and that the men\u2019s qualification coming on the back of Olympic success had in effect created a false impression that the national association had its house in order.  \u201cThe only difference has been John Herdman, who has managed to guide the players through all of the challenges and I don\u2019t think enough has changed,\u201d Forrest said. \u201cAnd now they\u2019re going to the biggest event on the planet times 10 and you have to be ready for that whirlwind coming at you from all sides.\u201d"

                    "body": "  9.18pm   Summary  Right, that\u2019s enough for me for one morning/evening/night. Emma Kemp has filed her match report from the Al Janoub Stadium. Expect plenty more coverage to follow today, tomorrow, and for the rest of this tournament. I\u2019ll see you again for Australia v Tunisia on Saturday.     Updated at 12.03am GMT    9.16pm    Allez! Benjamin Clark with the email zinger. \u201cIt\u2019s probably fair to say that this France team could win the SPFL.\u201d Probably fair Benjamin, probably fair. BUT CAN THEY DO IT ON A WET AND WINDY NIGHT AT TANNADICE!?     9.14pm    Australian TV analysis is, as ever, depressingly negative following defeat. Before the first ad-break Mark Bosnich has asked why Australia doesn\u2019t have its own Clairefontaine, and decried the now universal norm of playing out from the back (that led to France\u2019s second goal).      9.11pm    \u201cThat\u2019s why they\u2019re world champions,\u201d replied Graham Arnold with a wry smile on his face when asked a couple of quick questions by Australian TV. Clearly the message is going to be to put that result to one side and claim it was never a realistic source of points. Game two against Tunisia was always going to be pivotal but now it is massive for the Socceroos after Tunisia\u2019s point earlier today.      9.09pm    For Australia it\u2019s back to the drawing board but they\u2019ll fancy their chances against Tunisia on Saturday in the hopes of keeping everything alive against Denmark.     9.08pm    Deschamps can now plot his course though the remainder of the group phase with confidence. Denmark are up next in the clash likely to determine the group winners, followed by an encounter with Tunisia.      9.05pm    France enjoyed two-thirds of possession and had 23 shots to Australia\u2019s four. The 4-1 scoreline does not flatter them.      9.02pm    Australia scored early and started promisingly to raise hopes of an upset but the final hour was all France. The World Cup holders denied the curse of the defending champions (and their own dubious history) to carve the Socceroos open time and again. Mbappe, Dembele, and Griezmann all look in fine fettle, and Giroud bagged a couple to bring him level with Thierry Henry on France\u2019s all-time scorer\u2019s list. An ideal opening hit-out for Didier Deschamps, soured only by the injury to Lucas Hernandez.      9.00pm   Full-time: France 4-1 Australia  The defending champions are up and running in style.      8.58pm    90+4 mins: Mooy gets his name taken by the South African referee, no doubt adding to the 7 (seven) minutes of injury time. That\u2019s in addition to the 6 (six) added minutes at the end of the first half.       8.56pm    90+ 3 mins: While Jeremy Nash supersizes the equation. \u201cFrance might be about to hit four+ twice in a row but they\u2019ve a way to go to match Hungary in 1954 who followed up hitting nine against South Korea with eight against West Germany.\u201d Most dominant side never to lift the World Cup?      8.55pm    90+2 mins: Adam Berry brings the four-goal knowledge. \u201cI remember Germany following up their 4-1 destruction of England in 2010 with a 4-0 hammering of Diego Maradona\u2019s Argentina. Surely the most high-profile consecutive 4-goal haul in World Cup history (regardless of how shambolic the opposition were)?\u201d     8.54pm    90 mins: Another header, another Ryan save, this time more routine from Hernandez\u2019s effort.      8.53pm    89 mins: Back to the fourth official we go. This time Giroud\u2019s number is up \u2013 no hat-trick for him tonight \u2013 but a big bear hug nonetheless from Deschamps. Pavard is also removed. Marcus Thuram is one of the players to come on and he almost scores with his first touch but Ryan makes an excellent save diving to his left after the sub gets his head to a corner.      8.51pm    87 mins: This game ran out of steam a long time ago, but it\u2019s still a joy to watch Griezmann\u2019s movement behind the frontline and his ability to find space and give-and-go to fashion openings. If he remains in sync with Dembele and Mbappe for the next month France will be difficult to stop.      8.48pm    84 mins: More subs. Irvine and Atkinson making way for Keanu Baccus and Milos Degenek.     8.46pm    83 mins: Mbappe could have scored a stack tonight but another chance goes begging. Again it\u2019s the vision of Griezmann that creates the opportunity but after he picks out the 2018 Golden Boy, Mbappe miscontrols and Ryan can pounce.      8.45pm    82 mins: Giroud\u2019s sniffing a hat-trick but Mbappe can\u2019t find him at the far post with his dinky cross.      8.44pm    80 mins: Justin Caouette with an excellent question: \u201cHow often do teams score 4+ goals in consecutive games at the World Cup? I feel like it has to be...not that often? Granted it\u2019s been 4.5 years (which feel like eons in pandemic time) since France\u2019s 4-2 title win, but the stat checks out.\u201d  Have at it hive mind.      8.42pm    79 mins: Australia attack! It ends with a free-kick in a dangerous area but Mooy\u2019s delivery is easily headed clear by Konate. Harry Souttar has not threatened so far in the air. Meanwhile, Jackson Irvine is finally handed a yellow card, long after he was due.      8.40pm    77 mins: Youssouf Fofana and Kingsley Coman come on for Dembele and Tchouameni.      8.39pm    75 mins: \u201cJust wanted to mention how nice it is to see Giroud, who didn\u2019t have a single shot at target on Russia 2018, scoring two goals for France\u2019s starter game this tournament,\u201d emails Daniel Gurfinkiel. It\u2019s just always nice to see Giroud, isn\u2019t it? Such a handsome man. And to think, if Benzema was fit\u2026   Updated at 8.43pm GMT    8.38pm    72 mins: A nice moment for Australia amidst the gloom with Awer Mabil and Garang Kuol coming on for Goodwin and McGree. Both subs have excellent stories.        8.35pm   GOAL! France 4-1 Australia (Giroud, 70)  Those boots are getting filled alright! Mbappe takes the Michael down the left and does Atkinson twice with his dropped shoulder and change of pace. Is there an end product to match? You bet there is. A perfect stand-up left-footed cross for Giroud to head home and equal Thierry Henry as France\u2019s record goalscorer.   Updated at 8.39pm GMT    8.34pm    69 mins: It\u2019s hard to see the result changing now. France have turned the screw for the past 40 to 45 minutes without really going through the gears. The key has been the overlapping runs of the substitute Hernandez on the left, allied with the close control of Mbappe, Dembele, and especially Griezmann.   Updated at 8.37pm GMT    8.31pm   GOAL! France 3-1 Australia (Mbapp\u00e9 68)  Australia can\u2019t clear their lines, France continue to attack, and from broken play Dembele stands up a tempting cross from the right and Mbappe gets between the two central defenders to be in the perfect position to head home his side\u2019s third. It was coming.   Updated at 8.35pm GMT    8.30pm    68 mins: Off the line from Behich! Yet again Hernandez gets in behind on the left and after his cross is knocked out of the area Griezmann drills a low shot destined for the back of the net but it\u2019s repelled on the line.      8.29pm    66 mins: Irvine again gets away with a bookable challenge leading to Deschamps having a word with fourth official Salima Mukansanga.      8.27pm    64 mins: Australia are playing in quicksand now, losing the ball in midfield and struggling to keep up with France\u2019s ball movement. If France click in the final third they could fill their boots.     8.26pm    62 mins: France come again and the latest incursion from Hernandez down the left leads to a corner. Konate rises highest from Griezmann\u2019s delivery but he can\u2019t get enough purchase on his header.      8.25pm    61 mins: Mbappe has a decent sniff but Rowles just gets a toe to the ball to send his shot wide after glorious interplay from the French attack and Giroud in particular. Their ability to knock the ball around confidently in tight spaces is so good to watch.      8.23pm    60 mins: Some rare action! Rabiot, not for the first time tonight, pounces on a loose ball. He darts around the outside of Atkinson and lofts a cross to the far post but nothing comes of it.      8.21pm    58 mins: Les Bleus are in no hurry this half and the Socceroos are not busting a gut to rush them into changing pace. It is attack v defence in Australia\u2019s half with little urgency from either side.      8.19pm    56 mins: First change of the night and the Cumdog is on! Jason Cummings makes his World Cup debut in place of spearhead Mitch Duke.   Updated at 8.23pm GMT    8.18pm    54 mins: Now an Australian is booked, and it\u2019s Mitch Duke for diving in on Dembele after losing possession following some neat interplay by the Socceroos in build-up play. France are dictating the tempo this half, and it is walking pace with the occasional faster vertical pass. Slow, slow, quick, quick, slow.     8.16pm    52 mins: Irvine is lucky to escape a booking after leaving a foot in on Hernandez. Mbappe\u2019s free-kick delivery from deep is garbage.      8.14pm    50 mins: France carve open Australia and they do so at walking pace. Upamecano lofts a simple ball over the top for Hernandez to get in behind, the fullback pulls the ball back to the penalty spot but there\u2019s nobody there to pull the trigger. Hernandez gets another go with the second ball and this time he lofts his cross and Giroud acrobatically volleys wide. The technique? Think a left-footed version of Mark Hughes\u2019 volley for Manchester United against Manchester City in 1989.       8.11pm    49 mins: Goodwin takes it but he can\u2019t beat the first man. Unforgivable. Graham Arnold must be doing his nut in the dugout.      8.10pm    48 mins: Early corner for Australia, their first of the night, after industrious work on the right by Atkinson. Can they find the head of Souttar?     8.10pm    47 mins: Cumdog is trending in Australia on Twitter. What a world.       8.08pm    46 mins: The second half is underway.  Updated at 8.09pm GMT    8.02pm    As for France, there will be concerns about the volume of cheap turnovers at the base of midfield. Better teams will have punished them in transition in that half.  Deschamps will also must wonder about his luck after losing another starter to injury when Lucas Hernandez limped off early.      8.01pm    Australia might still end up on the wrong side of a hiding, but I think Graham Arnold deserves credit for how he set up his side. The talent disparity between the two squads is immense, but for the opening quarter they were even on the pitch and tactically the Socceroos were ahead. The decision to start Goodwin paid dividends, and the structure was solid.      7.57pm    \u201cWhat great play in the build up to that goal from Bill\u2026 Leckie Bill. I tried this four years ago but it hasn\u2019t really caught on,\u201d emails Sean Boiling. \u201cWe go again.\u201d God loves a trier, but Leckie bills are no laughing matter right now Sean.      7.56pm    The good: France getting the ball often to the feet of Mbappe and Demebele in wide areas. They look so dangerous so quickly with both able to go outside or in, using Griezmann as a foil.  The bad: Australia running out of gas following a bright start, highlighted by Atkinson getting caught in possession for France\u2019s second goal.      7.52pm   Half-time: France 2-1 Australia  Australia started well and threatened to do a Saudi Arabia with an early goal, but France didn\u2019t panic, gained control, and the defending champions are now in control on the pitch and on the scoreboard.      7.48pm    45+1 mins: Now Australia hit the post! A rare attack builds down the left, Goodwin lofts a cross over, Irvine climbs well at the far stick and his header back across Lloris glances the post and behind.      7.47pm    45 mins: Sacr\u00e9 bleu! Mbappe has to score \u2013 but blazes over. A long diagonal unleashes Griezmann on the inside-right channel. His ball into the box is superb but Mbappe elects not to head a ball at an awkward height, instead slicing a gilt edged chance wide.   Updated at 7.51pm GMT    7.45pm    44 mins: France are forcing turnovers at will in midfield. Mooy simply doesn\u2019t have anywhere to go when he gets on the ball and looks up. Arnold needs a Plan B after halftime.      7.43pm    42 mins: It\u2019s all France now. Mbappe down the left, Dembele the right, and Griezmann through the middle. They all link to set up Griezmann on the edge of the box but he drags his left-footed effort wide. They need more opportunities to find the boot (or head) of Giroud.       7.41pm    38 mins: The Socceroos finally get a hold of the ball after ten minutes or so of French domination. Unlike the early phases though there\u2019s no ambition with the wide men holding their defensive shape instead of darting forward. France are happy to bide their time and enjoy the extra space on the counter. In the blink of an eye they go coast to coast and Mbappe has time and space to pick out the onrushing Demebele on the penalty spot but his effort skews over. He should have done better.      7.38pm    35 mins: France are patient around the edge of the box with all the blue jerseys looking for Griezmann to unpick the lock. A nice move gains momentum with Griezmann nipping in the tight spaces but just as the shooting chance opens the Atletico schemer takes the ball off Giroud\u2019s boot. The latter does get a shooting opportunity soon after but his half-volley flies wide after Demebele sprints past Behich on the right wing. Avenues opening up all over the place for the defending champions.      7.35pm    33 mins: France have turned the screw in the past five minutes or so with Griezmann becoming more influential in midfield. Australia are dropping deeper and deeper and those long spells of possession early in the game now seem like a distant memory.   Updated at 7.38pm GMT    7.33pm   GOAL! France 2-1 Australia (Giroud, 30)  Disaster for Australia, joy for Giroud. The Socceroos try to play out from the back, Atkinson\u2019s first touch is Sunday league, Rabiot picks his pocket and rolls the ball across the face of goal for Giroud to tap into an empty net.   Updated at 7.37pm GMT    7.30pm    29 mins: Another France header almost goes in, this time it\u2019s Giroud glancing wide after stealing in on the shoulder of the last defender.      7.29pm    28 mins: France scoring with a set-piece header probably wasn\u2019t in the script but Hernandez did well with his delivery and Rabiot gambled.   Updated at 7.33pm GMT    7.28pm   GOAL! France 1-1 Australia (Rabiot, 27)  Down the right this time from France but Dembele can\u2019t get beyond Goodwin. The ball returns to the Barcelona speedster and this time he looks inside for Griezmann who forces a corner. The set-piece delivery doesn\u2019t clear the first defender but the ball lands at the feet of Hernandez and his second ball is superbly curled in for Rabiot to climb onto and nod beyond Ryan.   Updated at 7.32pm GMT    7.25pm    26 mins: Even when Mbappe gets behind his man, Atkinson, there\u2019s cover in the massive frame of Souttar.      7.25pm    24 mins: Mbappe remains France\u2019s attacking outlet but this time Leckie tracks back and Atkinson executes the interception. This has been an outstanding display so far from the Socceroos. Disciplined, hard-working, and full of belief.      7.23pm    22 mins: Duke wellies one from range after Rabiot again coughs up cheap possession in his own half but the Al Rihla whistles past Lloris\u2019 left-hand upright. That was a fierce snapshot. France are not purring.      7.21pm    20 mins: France look threatening with the rondos in central areas with Griezmann orchestrating a couple of dazzling spells with Mbappe and Dembele but the ball breaks Australia\u2019s way. Irvine then executes an old fashioned reducer on Tchouameni which is a delight to watch waved play-on. That was a bone cruncher.      7.19pm    18 mins: France again find an outlet wide on the left, Hernandez this time, but as is becoming a pattern, there is no penetration from the touchline and Australia get bodies behind the ball.      7.18pm    16 mins: Rabiot concedes a cheap turnover in midfield, Australia pounce, force the turnover, earn a free-kick, and settle the game down again. Rabiot again is at fault, this time for bringing down the charging Behich on the left.  The Socceroos look extremely composed and mature so far.      7.16pm    14 mins: Mbappe again gets the ball to his feet on the left but despite his regular threat there\u2019s been no end product with Australia managing to crowd out the French when they get into the box.       7.15pm    13 mins: Going back to the goal, that was a brilliant long pass form Souttar, superb control and skill from Leckie, then the dream winger\u2019s cross. Goodwin\u2019s finish was decisive and clearly the outcome of a pre-planned routine. All in all excellent football.      7.14pm    12 mins: Lucas Hernandez is replaced by brother Theo as Mbappe breaks again on the outside down the left. The resulting corner is dealt with eventually by Australia.      7.13pm    11 mins: To add injury to insult, France\u2019s injury curse has struck yet again! Hernandez looks to have done himself a serious mischief, landing awkwardly as Leckie went through him in the lead-up to the goal. He limps off the pitch with the help of the physios, but that does not look good at all.      7.11pm    10mins: Is it opposite day?     7.10pm   GOAL! France 0-1 Australia (Goodwin, 9)  What was I saying? That route is a long diagonal from Souttar to Leckie from left to right. On the touchline the Melbourne City flyer brings the ball down superbly, goes past Hernandez and clips a perfect teasing cross along the six-yard line for his opposite winger Goodwin to arrive onto and smash into the roof of the net. What a start!    Updated at 7.18pm GMT    7.08pm    8 mins: France are happy to sit off and defend in a mid-block, giving Australia\u2019s defence and Mooy plenty of time to pad their passing and pass completion stats. The Socceroos are comfortable in this holding pattern but don\u2019t appear to have a clear idea of a route to goal.      7.07pm    6 mins: That is until Mbappe skins Atkinson on the left. The first Tasmanian to appear at a World Cup doesn\u2019t give up though and he has enough green and gold support to smuggle the ball clear.  Updated at 7.07pm GMT    7.05pm    5 mins: Australia have settled nicely, winning a series of second balls and looking composed recycling possession through Mooy. A lack of incision is inevitable but good signs nonetheless.      7.04pm    4 mins: Australia get a feel for the ball but it\u2019s a bit congested in midfield and McGree tries a snapshot from 35m out that is dragged horribly wide. A good press wins the ball back high up the field but Goodwin can\u2019t escape down the left.      7.03pm    2 mins: France on top from the kick-off. They enjoy 45 seconds of possession before Australia get a touch, and that includes Dembele skinning Behich down the right and clipping a cross over from which Mbappe earns a corner. The set-piece is flicked on dangerously but the Socceroos clear. Ominous start from the French.   Updated at 7.07pm GMT    7.00pm   Kick-off!  Here we go, the defending champions are off and running.     7.00pm    \u201cLet\u2019s get down to business\u201d booms over the speakers as the players huddle. This is the real sound of Qatar, isn\u2019t it?      6.59pm         6.57pm    Anthem time. France already with the early advantage.      6.55pm    Here they come, out of the tunnel, France in their beautifully crafted tricolour uniform of dark blue, white and red. Australia alongside them in gold jerseys, green shorts and white socks.      6.50pm    Conditions: Have a guess? Go on. That\u2019s right, it\u2019s warm and dry in Al Wakrah with temperatures in the low to mid 20s. Fans and players will be cooled by the in-stadium air conditioning.       6.47pm    \u201cAs someone who grew up on Tim Cahill\u2019s reliable World Cup magic, and tries hard to forget the 2018 version of the Socceroos, I think the best I can expect from the boys is some fighting spirit and to frustrate the world champions for as long as we can contain them.\u201d Ezra Finkelstein there with an email that I reckon sums up the feelings of many Australian fans. On Australian TV the two lead analysts are former internationals John Aloisi and Craig Foster and they have just delivered an excellent tactical package detailing Graham Arnold\u2019s game plan. Expect a very low block, long diagonal balls to Duke standing in one of the channels to allow for his supporting attackers to feed off him, and a reliance on Souttar from set-pieces.      6.43pm    In case you\u2019re just waking up in Australia and easing into the action, a quick recap of what\u2019s already happened in Qatar. In short: six teams, three goals, one penalty save, and the upset of upsets.        6.38pm    Simon McMahon has got in touch with some tangerine pride, telling me \u201cAustralia\u2019s Aziz Behich joined Dundee United in the summer and will tonight become the first current United player to start a game in the World Cup finals for, well, a wee while probably. It\u2019s not quite Malpas, Gough, Narey, Bannon and Sturrock at Mexico 86, but still. Harry Souttar also started his professional career at Tannadice, so go United, and go Australia!\u201d The Socceroos\u2019 links with Scotland go deep, very deep.       6.35pm    Referee: South Africa\u2019s Victor Gomes will blow the whistle today. He oversaw the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations final between Senegal and Egypt, and received plaudits for reporting bribes in a CAF Confederation Cup match. Also worth noting is fourth official Salima Mukansanga, one of the six female officials at this tournament.      6.27pm    France and Australia and sport, you say? That can only mean Richie Benaud chewing the fat in \u00cele-de-France, wearing his iconic cream/bone/white/off-white/ivory/beige jacket. And some elephants.      6.26pm    Of course it\u2019s only fair to share some France content as well.        6.25pm    Emma Kemp is our Australian eyes and ears on the ground in Qatar and she\u2019s been busy filing reports on all things Socceroo.        6.20pm   Australia XI  There are fewer household names in Australian gold but Graham Arnold has named an experienced spine starting with former Arsenal goalkeeper Mat Ryan, Stoke City centre-half Harry Souttar, Celtic midfielder Aaron Mooy, and the combative, line-leading Mitchell Duke.  Quite how this XI threatens such a formidable opponent remains to be seen but expect set-pieces to be important. 198cm Souttar has six goals in his 10 internationals and he will be the focal point whenever Australia get a corner or attacking free-kick.       6.13pm   France XI  France\u2019s injury woes have been well reported but even without, deep breath: Paul Pogba, N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9, Karim Benzema, Rafael Varane, Presnel Kimpembe, and Christopher Nkunku, Didier Deschamps has named an imposing starting XI.  He\u2019s gone for a youthful and attacking 4-2-3-1 set-up with pace to burn. Good luck keeping up with Dembele and Mbappe on the break.      6.03pm    Tonight\u2019s match offers our first glimpse of Al Janoub Stadium in the city of Al Wakrah, a smidgen south of Doha CBD. The ground holds 40,000 fans and was designed by the late Zaha Hadid. \u201cThe Qatari stadium\u2019s resemblance to a woman\u2019s private parts may be unintentional, but I for one applaud it,\u201d wrote Holly Baxter a few years ago. \u201cWith its shiny, pinkish tinge, its labia-like side appendages and its large opening in the middle, the supposedly innocent building (based upon the design of a traditional Qatari dhow boat) was just asking for trouble.\u201d For her part, Hadid dismissed such suggestions as \u201cridiculous\u201d and \u201cembarrassing\u201d. I mean\u2026      5.53pm   Preamble  Hello everybody and welcome to live coverage of the eighth match of the 2022 World Cup, France v Australia from Al Janoub Stadium in Al Wakrah. Kick-off in this group D clash is 10pm local time (6am AEDT/7pm GMT). For the second successive tournament France and Australia open their campaigns against one another. In Kazan four years ago the eventual champions ground out a 2-1 victory with a late deflected winner. They will expect a more routine three points tonight. There will be few more striking mismatches all tournament, on paper at least. France are holders of the World Cup and winners of the 2021 UEFA Nations League. Even without some notable absentees Les Bleus boast a squad as deep and talented as any in the competition, with a long-serving coach able to blend a side featuring proven campaigners and the brightest prospects in the game. By contrast, Australia are ranked 38th by FIFA and required a 20-game odyssey to qualify, one ending in a penalty shootout victory over Peru. Only four members of Graham Arnold\u2019s squad have more than 50 caps (half the group have 10 caps or fewer), and only two are signed to clubs in any of Europe\u2019s top-five leagues. \u201cI don\u2019t know any of the players individually,\u201d Liverpool\u2019s Ibrahima Konat\u00e9 said on Sunday. France will look to Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 for inspiration, a man valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars with proven World Cup pedigree; Australia to Celtic journeyman Aaron Mooy, one of six Scotland-based Socceroos. \u201cYou can say our players aren\u2019t playing in the top leagues in the world and all their players are,\u201d Arnold said this week. \u201cBut it\u2019s about team spirit, it\u2019s about connecting 11 players \u2013 and 26 players \u2013 together in a family environment, making sure they\u2019re mates and they\u2019ve got each other\u2019s backs. That\u2019s when you can get special results.\u201d But as guaranteed as the result looks ahead of time it still has to be earned, and France know from bitter experience how a World Cup campaign can unravel \u2013 especially as defending champions. Besides, it suits Arnold\u2019s character to tap into the \u201clittle Aussie battler\u201d trope. \u201cWe have got the Aussie DNA,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will go out there and have a fight, kick and scratch, do whatever is required.\u201d There\u2019s an hour or so before kick-off so feel free to spend that time sending me an email. Or, if you haven\u2019t yet jumped ship, tweet me @JPHowcroft.   "

                    "body": "The US men\u2019s and women\u2019s soccer teams will share prize money from their respective World Cups equally in a historic agreement announced on Wednesday. US Soccer and the unions for the two teams reached the deal during negotiations for their new collective bargaining agreements, which have now been ratified. \u201cThe accomplishments in this CBA are a testament to the incredible efforts of WNT players on and off the field,\u201d said USWNT player and USWNT players\u2019 association president Becky Sauerbrunn. \u201cThe gains we have been able to achieve are both because of the strong foundation laid by the generations of WNT players that came before the current team and through our union\u2019s recent collaboration with our counterparts at the [men\u2019s players union] and leadership at US Soccer. \u201cWe hope that this agreement and its historic achievements in not only providing for equal pay but also in improving the training and playing environment for national team players will similarly serve as the foundation for continued growth of women\u2019s soccer both in the United States and abroad.\u201d  USMNT defender Walker Zimmerman, who is a member of the men\u2019s union leadership group, also welcomed the deal. \u201cThere are tough conversations, but at the end of the day, it is the right thing to do,\u201d Zimmerman said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that [the US women\u2019s team players] deserve. It\u2019s something that they have fought for so hard, and, to be honest, sometimes it does feel like we had just kind of come alongside of them and had been a little late.\u201d Fifa\u2019s prize money for the men\u2019s and women\u2019s World Cups is unequal. The bonus pool for this year\u2019s men\u2019s World Cup in Qatar is $440m, while the prize money for the women\u2019s tournament in Australia in 2023 is $60m. Under the new agreement, the unions for the US men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams will share the prize money from the 2022 and 2023 World Cups. The US men have already qualified for Qatar 2022, while the women\u2019s team are the reigning women\u2019s champions and are heavy favourites to book their place for Australia 2023 later this summer.  Sign up for our new (and free) women\u2019s football newsletter!  World Cup prize money was not the only area where equal deals were reached. Shares of ticket sales will now be equal, as will win bonuses. Some aspects of income and benefits will differ between the teams. The men will not share their $2.5m bonus for qualifying for this year\u2019s World Cup as it was part of the their previous CBA. \u201cThis is a truly historic moment. These agreements have changed the game forever here in the United States and have the potential to change the game around the world,\u201d said US Soccer president Cindy Parlow Cone, who is also a former USWNT player. \u201cUS Soccer and the USWNT and USMNT players have reset their relationship with these new agreements and are leading us forward to an incredibly exciting new phase of mutual growth and collaboration as we continue our mission to become the preeminent sport in the United States.\u201d The US women\u2019s team has long fought for equal treatment with the men\u2019s team. In December 2020 they reached an agreement with US Soccer over equal work conditions with their male counterparts. The players were granted the same conditions as the US men\u2019s team in areas such as travel, hotel accommodation, the right to play on grass rather than artificial turf, and staffing. Then, in February, the team agreed a $24m settlement that ended a six-year legal battle over equal pay."

                    "body": "Zlatko Dalic could luxuriate in sifting through the golden moments in Croatia\u2019s recent past and taking his pick. \u201cI\u2019ve already said the semi-final against England was our greatest match ever, and Brazil comes in second,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we manage to win tomorrow, that would make it the greatest, most historic game for Croatia of all time.\u201d\nIt was no slight on England or any of the other hurdles Dalic, his players and their predecessors have overcome. Beating Argentina and Lionel Messi would bring the warmest of glows and so would a second successive World Cup final, but his assessment was coloured by the development of his own side. This year\u2019s Croatia may not look wildly different from the 2018 vintage in style or approach, but that is laudable in itself: three\u2011quarters of this squad were not involved in Russia and one of tournament football\u2019s most efficient winning machines has rolled on.\n\nOn Sunday, their goalscorer in the last eight, Bruno Petkovic said, joking, that he was \u201cabout 78th choice\u201d for Dalic last time out. He was barely getting a sniff at Bologna and when the national team reached the semis considered travelling to Moscow as a fan.\nHe was not called up until March 2019 and despite a moderate output for Dinamo Zagreb has never let the national team down. Like Croatia\u2019s other less-heralded newcomers, he has thrived on the standards set by a long\u2011serving core.\n\u201cTo repeat such success with a new national team is quite fantastic,\u201d he said. With the exceptions of the centre-back Josko Gvardiol, Celtic\u2019s in-demand right-back Josip Juranovic and perhaps the penalty-saving marvel Dominik Livakovic, Croatia lack obvious new stars in the mould of their veterans. But those joining the fold have been ushered into a tight-knit group that, off the pitch at least, virtually runs itself: Luka Modric, Ivan Perisic and company create the example that others follow, raising Croatia high above the mean.\n\nThose close to the camp relate a palpable sense that the senior players make their peers better by osmosis. Modric and Perisic, to stick with two examples, are not especially vocal in the dressing room or even on the pitch, but it means the shortest of statements or exhortations, when they come, carries significant weight.\nNobody can ignore the diligence with which Modric, an obsessive self-analyst, watches games back and examines his own performance. He shows the path but, in hitting such astonishing heights at 37, also lights up the destination.\nEarly in Croatia\u2019s 2018 campaign the experienced striker Nikola Kalinic was sent home by Dalic after refusing to come on as a late substitute against Nigeria. Kalinic was popular with the squad\u2019s elders so it was a big call by a coach who was, back then, green at the highest level. But it was a line in the sand nobody has crossed since and is viewed as a key episode in his development of a culture.\nDalic came to know who he could trust. It is notable he feels no need to concern himself over players\u2019 extracurricular activities during, or outside of, a tournament. The grandees \u2013 also including Dejan Lovren, Mateo Kovacic, Marcelo Brozovic and Domagoj Vida \u2013 lead through their behaviour and nobody would dream of rejecting their blueprint.\n\nDalic prefers a tight, focused entourage, something more compact than the Brazil setup that arrived at their quarter-final in two buses. Croatia employ only one analyst, the Scotsman Marc Rochon. Their team manager, a high-level administrator who has sat on the bench since 2016, is Iva Olivari. Players and staff cite her influence in making newcomers welcome; Dalic refers to her as \u201cthe boss\u201d and hands her control of most off the field details.\nIt all makes for a group whose methods and mentality feel established, smooth, intuitive. The vast majority of players have passed to senior level through the age groups or at least spent some time playing with or against each other in the powerhouses of Dinamo or Hajduk Split. The degrees of separation are few, but in navigating five weeks this intense this level of familiarity is seen as an advantage.\n\n\u201cWe are all a real family and we stick together,\u201d Juranovic said. \u201cWe breathe for each other from the first minute to the last and that is simply the secret of our success.\u201d\nIt is a potent weapon when you are a collective of big names, perceived journeymen and could-bes. And it is more than a fluke when the recipe has come good three times over, starting in 1998 with the group overseen by Miroslav Blazevic.\nNow they need to go again, taking it all the way once more if necessary. \u201cIf we play just like we did against Brazil anything is possible, without a doubt,\u201d Perisic said.\nIt will require another lesson in control from a Modric-led midfield that Juranovic, raising laughs, said is \u201csafer than having your money in the bank\u201d when handed possession. If that central area is controlled, and if a roaming Messi can be smothered, Croatia\u2019s generals will set another platform for their sidekicks to write new chapters.\n\u201cI\u2019m becoming more and more aware of this goal\u2019s magnitude with every passing day,\u201d Petkovic said of the strike that stunned Brazil. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll experience something similar in the semi-final or beyond.\u201d\nHe may, or maybe someone else will. Croatia\u2019s strength is that, in a team sprinkled with illustrious faces, everyone can take his turn at being a hero."

                    "body": "Ecuador were far happier with this draw because after conceding early Gustavo Alfaro\u2019s team played front-foot football that went close to administering a fatal blow to the Netherlands.\nThey did not but the result means that Qatar are eliminated from their own World Cup and become the first nation out at the group stage, while Ecuador and the Netherlands each have four points and Senegal three. As Louis van Gaal\u2019s side face the pointless hosts in their final match, the meeting of Ecuador and Senegal appears a straight shootout to see who progresses to the last 16. Ecuador are favourites given that they require a draw and after seriously rattling Dutch confidence they should surge. Particularly impressive was how they responded to Cody Gakpo\u2019s opener, turning in a display of muscular attacking and pressing that sucked energy and composure from their opponents.\n\nEnner Valencia, their star man, registered a third goal of the tournament and although he was carried off near the end, Alfaro suggested the forward should be fine. \u201cHe\u2019s going through such a good spell and I am so happy for him,\u201d the Argentinian said. \u201cI think his injury is OK. Sometimes you deserve to win but, for whatever reason, you don\u2019t get the result. Since their coach took his position, they were unbeaten in 17 games, they had a great qualifying campaign in Europe and we were facing such a good team.\u201d\nVan Gaal concurred with this analysis. \u201cEcuador could\u2019ve won,\u201d he said. \u201cI was satisfied with the 1-1 but not with the game. The duels were all for Ecuador and when that happens you cannot win.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday Van Gaal had stated that Gakpo could be a breakout star of the tournament and the PSV player needed only five minutes to show why. Steven Bergwijn, his strike partner, lost Nathan Ak\u00e9\u2019s pass but the ball arrived at Davy Klaassen\u2019s feet via Mois\u00e9s Caicedo\u2019s loose distribution, and after the No 10 fashioned a cute backheel Gakpo took over, skilfully curling a 20-yard left-foot finish past Hern\u00e1n Gal\u00edndez.\nThat made it two in two games for Gakpo, and Frenkie de Jong and Teun Koopmeiners in the engine room had Van Gaal\u2019s men purring forward at their desired pace, which was a touch above a stroll.\nA Gonzalo Plata dart down the right signalled Ecuador intention to disrupt this. In a flurry of action his cross came to Caicedo, whose shot was blocked before, seconds later, the Brighton man cut in from the left and fired the ball in, Virgil van Dijk having to clear. From the throw-in Pervis Estupi\u00f1\u00e1n was fed and, once more, Van Dijk was in rescue mode, heading the wing-back\u2019s delivery away.\nEcuador were enjoying themselves down their left and when Valencia cut inside and let fly Andries Noppert\u2019s save low to his right had to be sharp.\nOut of possession Ecuador were accomplished too, harrying De Jong, Koopmeiners and Bergwijn to eventually spill the ball. They nearly drew level when, with a swish, Jackson Porozo, one of Alfaro\u2019s three centre-backs, moved forward and bounced the ball into the marauding \u00c1ngelo Preciado, who failed to capitalise.\n\nJust before the break Estupi\u00f1\u00e1n saw his deflected finish ruled out because Porozo was offside: he was, yet Noppert had already dived right, the opposite direction to where he was beaten.\nFor the second half Van Gaal gave Memphis Depay the 45 minutes he had promised, Bergwijn being replaced, but Depay had scant impact.\nEcuador struck when Estupi\u00f1\u00e1n skated into space and blazed at Noppert\u2019s goal; the goalkeeper palmed out and Valencia could not miss. The goal had derived from a catalogue of errors that featured a poor Noppert clearance, an even poorer Daley Blind header, De Jong being involved in a midfield mix-up, and Ecuador taking advantage for the captain\u2019s sixth goal in five World Cup outings.\nThe Netherlands were close to disarray, any type of attacking patterns a distant memory, so when Depay surged through the centre and claimed a free-kick it felt a small shock, though nothing came from the set piece.\nPlata was far more convincing when crashing a shot off Noppert\u2019s crossbar and it seemed only one team might win. Ecuador had reduced Netherlands to a raggedness that surely infuriated Van Gaal, a coach who drills his charges to operate in defined zones and pass and move with trigonometric precision.\nUntil the whistle Ecuador were a menace, often scattering their opponents by pinging the ball about masterfully, though now came the injury to Valencia that forced him off. But his team held on for a point that could go a long way to helping them reach the knockout stage \u2013 and if the captain is fit to participate this will provide a further fillip."

                    "body": "Australia will face Papua New Guinea in the semi-finals of the Women\u2019s Rugby League World Cup after edging out New Zealand 10-8, thanks to Julia Robinson\u2019s late try in a tantalising tussle in York. The two old rivals locked horns in north Yorkshire to determine who would top Group B and avoid hosts England in the knockout rounds, in one of the most anticipated match-ups in either the men\u2019s or women\u2019s tournaments.  A see-sawing fixture did not disappoint. The defending champions, who had racked up 166 points and not conceded a single try in their first two games, were pushed fully to their limits but eventually emerged triumphant by a single try conversion after a brutal and thrilling encounter.  The Jillaroos had to be patient and bide their time against a brave Kiwi outfit, who stood tall and went set for set with their trans-Tasman neighbours. While their unbeaten defensive record might have gone, Australia showed character to fight back and grind out a priceless victory that has them now in the box seat to reach the final at Old Trafford on 19 November. Without a doubt it was a scare that showed they are fallible and rubbished any claims of World Cup success being a divine right. Coming back into the starting line-up after being rested in the win over France was the key troika of Sammy Bremner, captain Ali Brigginshaw and Kezie Apps. Australia needed their star power back after walkovers against the Cook Islands and France, as this was anything but easy. Only brilliant cover defence from New Zealand stopped the Jillaroos opening the scoring in the second minute. The Kiwi Ferns spent the first four minutes camped on their own try-line, but somehow managed to keep Australia at bay. The barrage didn\u2019t stop, though, with the Australians forcing goal-line dropouts and building set after set in their opponent\u2019s half. The plucky Kiwis refused to crack, and marched the Jillaroos downfield to launch their own attacks. It was a bruising, high-quality opening quarter and the first real test Australia had faced in this tournament. Finally the deadlock was broken in the 19th minute when Tarryn Aiken twisted out of two tackles to reach out and score. Brigginshaw stepped up and nailed the conversion to make it 6-0. However, New Zealand were far from overawed and 11 minutes later they hit back through Apii Nicholls. A bouncing kick from Raecene McGregor bamboozled the Australian defence and fullback Nicholls pounced. A poor conversion attempt from Brianna Clark from right in front hit the post and missed, leaving the Jillaroos two points ahead. Uncharacteristic errors from Australia meant they were unable to extend their lead in the first half. With the match delicately poised, the second half began with a Kiwi Ferns knock on from the kick off. It was the worst possible start though would not define them, as only an outstanding one-on-one tackle from Bremner stopped Kateyln Vaka\u2019aholo from crossing on the flank. It was tight, tense before the contest completely turned in the 54th minute after a brilliant ball steal from Annetta Nu\u2019uasala on Bremner. She was pulled down close to the line, but in the next tackle they shifted the ball left quickly and Autumn Rain Stephens-Daly touched down out wide. Clark crucially couldn\u2019t add the extras, but the Kiwi Ferns had poked their noses ahead 8-6. Pressure grew on the misfring Australians as the clock wound down, until Robinson replied on the flank. With 19 minutes left the winger crossed from Jess Sergis\u2019s pass to edge the Jillaroos back in front. Lauren Brown took the kicking tee but her attempt hit the crossbar. Time was running out for New Zealand and there was to be no late comeback in the climactic final minutes. However, the takeaway remains that the clunky Jillaroos have clearly been put on notice, that this World Cup is no walkover and that they will need to be much better to take the trophy back home with them."

                    "body": "Three years ago, Aramco, the oil giant predominantly owned by the Saudi royal family, underwent a subtle rebrand. And subtle is the operative word here: the company\u2019s distinctive logo, a white star on a blue and green background, remained in place. But somehow the blue was rendered just a little bluer, the green just a little greener, the typeface softened into grey lowercase, the word \u201cSaudi\u201d and the Arabic script above it quietly removed. This was the logo upon which Sam Curran stood as he prepared to bowl for England against Pakistan in their final Twenty20 World Cup warm-up on Monday, a little heap of sawdust at his feet. At the boundary\u2019s edge, a band of Aramco billboards \u2013 blue as blue as the sky, green as green as life \u2013 flickered into the Brisbane night. Curran examined the ball in his hands, launched into his hop-skip approach and fixed his gaze on a set of Aramco-branded stumps about 40 yards away.  Does Curran register the existence of these images or the significance of them? Let\u2019s take a wild swing in the dark: probably not. Frankly, why would you? To exist as an international cricketer in 2022 is to be innocently festooned in a jumble of unintelligible words and icons: some ironed on to the front of your shirt, some painted on the grass beneath your feet, some cluttering the fringes of your player-of-the-match cheque. This is just the flora and fauna of your world. To expect a player to question or even scrutinise it is like asking for an opinion of Guernica from an ant crawling across its surface. Just like that, seamless and unobserved, Aramco slips into the room, pulls up a chair and blends into the canvas. It was only a few days ago the International Cricket Council announced it was awarding one of its top-tier sponsorships to a company estimated to be responsible for extracting the oil that has produced more than 4% of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions since 1965, that has recorded lavish profits as a result of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, that is owned by a regime that has sanctioned the widespread use of torture and murder for its own ends. Still, the ICC press release was all about looking forward. There were numerous references to the focus on \u201csustainability and innovation\u201d, with Aramco recycling machines to be installed at all seven T20 World Cup grounds. \u201cWe are delighted to welcome Aramco into the family of ICC global partners,\u201d the chief executive, Geoff Allardice, gushed, with all the beaming pride of a man who feels he is not so much losing any remaining vestigial moral authority the ICC may have possessed on human rights, gender equality or the climate crisis, but gaining a son. What this is not is a sea change or the crossing of a red line. Nor are we simply referring to the gradual infiltration of tainted money into cricket, from repressive regimes to mass polluters to cryptocurrency firms with a massive and catastrophic environmental footprint. One of the byproducts of sport\u2019s embrace of immoral revenue streams is the way words and messages have become divorced from their meaning, the way administrators and governing bodies increasingly issue statements that are so detached from reality as to be essentially absurd. There are two words curiously absent from the ICC\u2019s announcement of its Saudi oil sponsorship. One is \u201coil\u201d, and the other is \u201cSaudi\u201d. Do we think they knew? Should someone tell them? It\u2019s likely the average World Cup viewer would be essentially oblivious of the genesis of this inoffensive lowercase word emblazoned at mid-off, swaddling the boundary rope, printed on the recycling machines. By such means is the word \u201cAramco\u201d simply and harmlessly absorbed into cricket\u2019s lexical subconscious: the DLF maximum, the Popchips Superchargers, your Aramco player of the match.  In the 1990s, at its Shaybah oil field, Aramco began to pioneer an unusual and extremely expensive technique called horizontal drilling. The idea is that instead of drilling multiple wells in multiple locations, you create a lattice of underground wells going sideways from a single bore, some of them miles long, in order to get at the deep-lying crude reservoirs that would be inaccessible vertically. On the surface, very little appears to be happening. But via an invisible network of tentacles and drill bits, guided by advanced computer modelling, the ground beneath your feet is slowly being sucked dry. This is how the world changes. Out of view, out of reach, beyond your knowledge, beyond your comprehension, and from the inside out. What you see \u2013 a golf tournament, an Anthony Joshua jab, Bruno Guimar\u00e3es riding a challenge, Curran licking his lips and gripping the ball for a cross-seamer \u2013 is the tiniest fraction of the whole. Which is why it makes no sense to us: a palimpsest of competing words and images whose cumulative effect is a pure confusion that prevents any alternative vision from emerging. A Durham one-day international played in 37C heat. Byju\u2019s. The murder of Jamal Khashoggi. The ICC\u2019s partnership with Aramco reflects a shared focus on sustainability and innovation. Emirates. West Indies need 98 from 68 balls. India offers tremendous growth opportunities over the long-term, Aramco said in a statement on Sunday. Booking.com. Singh to the left-handers, that\u2019s a smart match-up. Close your eyes and you can hear it all, and all at once. The sound of an oil drilling rig is steady, low-frequency and monotonous, and some people claim it helps them to sleep."

A topsy-turvy contest was heading for a penalty shootout after the excellent Ramona Bachmann, who was forced off late on through injury, cancelled out Rhiannon Roberts\u2019s opener.  Switzerland missed a second\u2011half penalty and Bachmann saw a fine strike disallowed in normal time for offside but there would be no final reprieve as Humm struck to floor Wales, whose distraught players left the pitch with sore eyes. Ffion Morgan sat on the turf wiping tears from her eyes and the goalkeeper Laura O\u2019Sullivan headed down the tunnel gnawing at the inside of her cheeks, presumably replaying the moment that ultimately decided this game. Geraldine Reuteler curled a cross into the six-yard box and Humm dashed towards the front post to help the ball past O\u2019Sullivan. \u201cIt is incredibly tough to take,\u201d the Wales manager, Gemma Grainger, said. \u201cWe know that the margins at this level are fine. I\u2019m proud that we compete at this level and we\u2019re going to continue doing that.\u201d The game descended into attack versus defence as Switzerland attempted to ramp up the pressure but it seemed as though Wales would eke it out until penalties. Bachmann jinked into the box and forced a save from O\u2019Sullivan before Ana-Maria Crnogorcevic, whose 58th\u2011minute penalty cannoned off a post, headed wide unmarked from a free-kick.  The Switzerland substitute Rachel Rinast volleyed wide at the back post on the cusp of half-time in extra time and the Wales left-back Rachel Rowe headed off the line to deny Riola Xhemaili. The defending was so desperate that Xhemaili was shorn of one of her boots. Wales, who required extra time to overcome Bosnia\u2011Herzegovina on Thursday, eventually wilted.  Switzerland put 15 goals past Moldova in their previous game and are nine places above Wales in the Fifa rankings but Grainger\u2019s side had come too far \u2013 this was their 12th game of the qualifying campaign \u2013 to show any signs of an inferiority complex. Wales seemed to relish their status as underdogs and rocked the hosts when Roberts side-footed in on the turn with 19 minutes on the clock. Kayleigh Green kept Angharad James\u2019s corner alive in the box, towering above two Switzerland defenders to win a header, and Roberts reacted quickest to squeeze a shot into the corner. A slick move brought Switzerland\u2019s equaliser on the verge of half-time, the Arsenal midfielder Lia W\u00e4lti\u2019s clever pass breaking the lines after Reuteler shifted the ball infield. Rowe was lured upfield out of position and Noelle Maritz, fresh from picking up W\u00e4lti\u2019s perfectly weighed pass, roamed down the right flank and picked out the former Chelsea forward Bachmann, who effortlessly swept a right\u2011foot shot into the top corner. Wales were suddenly on the back foot and the Switzerland defender Luana B\u00fchler then headed a corner wide before the half-time whistle. The drama increased in the second half when Crnogorcevic adjusted her feet to convert the rebound after her penalty rattled a post, only for the Swedish referee, Tess Olofsson, to rule the goal out because no other player touched the ball before the Barcelona striker stroked home from close range. Crnogorcevic was made to wait a couple of minutes before taking the spot-kick, as the referee calmed squabbling players. The penalty was awarded after the video assistant referee alerted Olofsson to the ball striking Rowe\u2019s hand as the defender got to grips with Eseosa Aigbogun\u2019s cross. O\u2019Sullivan made a smart save a couple of minutes into the second half to keep out Svenja F\u00f6lmli \u2019s effort from the angle as the hosts sought a winner. At the other end Green saw an effort land on the roof of the Swiss net after latching on to Jess Fishlock\u2019s pass. Bachmann thought she had scored a winner on 84 minutes, only for VAR to kill the party. Bachmann rolled Hayley Ladd and lashed a shot into the far corner from the edge of the six\u2011yard box but moments later placed her hands on her hips awaiting the VAR review, which found the substitute Riola Xhemaili offside in the buildup. Rowe\u2019s heroics cleared off the line to deny Xhemaili but Humm hushed Wales at the last."

                    "body": "It might be too late for Dominic Calvert-Lewin to force his way back into the England fold for the World Cup but there remains plenty of time for the striker to shape Everton\u2019s season. Gareth Southgate was looking on as the fit-again forward helped engineer an emphatic victory over a strangely subdued Crystal Palace. The England international scored his first goal of an injury-plagued campaign and was involved in the second for Anthony Gordon as Everton halted a three-match losing run with their biggest win of the season. Dwight McNeil\u2019s excellent third sealed an impressive display by Frank Lampard\u2019s team that left Patrick Vieira simmering with barely concealed anger. Asked to explain the Palace performance, Vieira replied: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a performance from us. We didn\u2019t play, we didn\u2019t compete and we made it easy for Everton.\u201d What went wrong? \u201cEverything.\u201d  Palace failed to match Everton\u2019s energy, industry and attacking intent throughout. In Calvert-Lewin, the hosts had the outlet and quality that Lampard has craved in the final third all season. An England return appears remote for the 25-year-old with only three more Premier League games before Qatar, but this was a vivid demonstration of his importance to Everton. \u201cIt\u2019s every boy\u2019s dream to go to the World Cup,\u201d said Calvert-Lewin, who clearly has not given up on a late inclusion. \u201cAll I can do is play the best I can for Everton and score goals and see where that takes me.\u201d Lampard also believes England\u2019s door may still be ajar for Calvert-Lewin. The Everton manager said: \u201cGareth knows him really well and has taken him to tournaments before so it\u2019s not about finding anything new about him. It is about him being fit and firing and if he can sustain that going into the break it will be Gareth\u2019s choice. It is out of Dominic\u2019s hands but what he could control today he certainly did. I\u2019m delighted for him. He has been frustrated but today you saw his fitness and sharpness.\u201d  Calvert-Lewin\u2019s breakthrough, on only his second start of the season, reflected the performance of both teams. There was no sign of three successive defeats affecting Everton\u2019s confidence as they pressed Palace into submission early on. The striker hunted down Luka Milivojevic deep inside the visitors\u2019 half to steal possession from a hesitant Palace captain. The dirty work done, Calvert-Lewin immediately set off for the opposition box to receive a return ball from Alex Iwobi. His first touch took him away from a tumbling Marc Gu\u00e9hi and created space for a precise, low finish beyond Vicente Guaita. It was the forward\u2019s first goal since securing Everton\u2019s Premier League status with a diving header against Palace 156 days ago. Palace awoke from their lethargy midway through the first half but rarely tested Jordan Pickford. When Odsonne \u00c9douard breached the home defence and looked to release Wilfried Zaha, S\u00e9amus Coleman, 13 years to the day since his Everton debut, showed excellent awareness and pace to intervene. The veteran dominated Zaha all afternoon and denied him with a superb tackle inside the area when Palace made a determined start to the second half. Conor Coady followed suit with a vital touch to divert Eberechi Eze\u2019s effort wide when he looked set to convert Jordan Ayew\u2019s cross to the near post. Everton brought themselves the comfort of a second goal after a flowing move instigated by Pickford\u2019s brave pass out to Coleman. Calvert-Lewin found Iwobi, Demarai Gray found Amadou Onana, who released Vitalii Mykolenko down the left. The Ukraine international\u2019s low drive was spilled by Guaita into the path of Anthony Gordon, who tapped into an empty goal. The winger was clearly onside when Mykolenko shot yet was initially flagged offside. VAR set the record straight, much to the delight of Idrissa Gana Gueye, who sprayed a water bottle into Gordon\u2019s face. Calvert-Lewin and Gordon departed to standing ovations before substitute McNeil added a delightful third. The summer signing darted away from two tired challenges and released Iwobi inside the area. Iwobi backheeled the ball first time into the path of the former Burnley winger and he sealed victory from close range. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have a comfortable win at Goodison Park,\u201d said Lampard. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had many of those.\u201d"

                    "body": "Gareth Southgate has cast doubt over Trent Alexander-Arnold\u2019s World Cup hopes by leaving the defender out of England\u2019s Nations League fixture against Germany on Monday night. The Liverpool right-back is one of five players who have been omitted from the fixture as the competition\u2019s rules mean Southgate must trim his 28-man squad down to 23 names on matchday. Jarrod Bowen, Fikayo Tomori, James Ward-Prowse and the suspended Jack Grealish have also been left out. Brentford striker Ivan Toney has been included and will hope to win his first cap when England play their final game before their World Cup opener against Iran on 21 November.  However, the absence of Alexander-Arnold has raised eyebrows and could mean England look increasingly likely to fly to Qatar without a player who is seen as one of the best in the world in his position. He was an unused substitute during last Friday\u2019s 1-0 defeat to Italy and the fact that he will not feature again on Monday suggests he is running out of time to win Southgate over. Alexander-Arnold, who has been a shaky presence in Liverpool\u2019s defence this season, has rarely been at his best for England and has struggled to establish himself as one of Southgate\u2019s regulars. The England manager has plenty of options in his position, with Kyle Walker, Reece James and Kieran Trippier all pressing for inclusion, and it appears that doubts over Alexander-Arnold\u2019s defensive qualities are working against him. Equally there is an argument that Southgate could solve his side\u2019s creative woes by tapping into the Liverpool player\u2019s outstanding passing and crossing. However, that looks an increasingly unlikely prospect. Southgate is expected to stick with his 3-4-3 system against Germany and Alexander-Arnold has not looked comfortable when he has played as a right wing-back at international level. If there is encouragement for Alexander-Arnold it is that Southgate planned to pick four right-backs at Euro 2020 only for injury to rule the 23-year-old out of that tournament. But when Southgate was asked about Alexander-Arnold at his pre-match media conference on Sunday, it was notable that he ended up speaking about the other right-backs at his disposal. \u201cI think he\u2019s a fantastic footballer and he of course adds, as a lot of the other players do, different qualities to the game,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cHe does have a fantastic range of passing. We\u2019re blessed with different profiles of player in that position.  \u201cIf we play with wing-backs, Trippier and Reece James are also exceptional with the ball, in different ways, and we\u2019re always having to look at the full package with everything and assess the players on all of their attributes. \u201cThey\u2019ve all been to Champions League finals, some of them have been to the latter stages of major tournaments with us. Trent\u2019s won the league, Trippier\u2019s won the Spanish league, Walker\u2019s won the English league. There are so many good attributes about them, it\u2019s a really difficult position to make decisions on, but we have to go with the ones we believe, and ultimately I\u2019ll be judged on the outcome.\u201d Southgate dropped Alexander-Arnold in March 2020, citing concerns over his club form, but recalled him two months later. It has not been an easy fit. Southgate was also asked if Alexander-Arnold is too much of a defensive risk. \u201cI don\u2019t see risks,\u201d he insisted. \u201cAt Liverpool, they find a way of playing that brings the best out of his attributes and that\u2019s what we\u2019re all trying to do with every team. You\u2019re trying to build a team that accentuates the positives, and within the group protects yourselves against how the opponents might come from you.\u201d Southgate added that he was \u201clambasted\u201d for trying to use Alexander-Arnold\u2019s passing by experimenting him with a midfielder during England\u2019s victory over Andorra at Wembley in 2021. The manager is under huge pressure before England host Germany. The Euro 2020 finalists are winless in five matches and Southgate, who has admitted his job will be at risk if the World Cup is a failure, is seeing many of his selection decisions called into doubt. There has also been a backlash about the omission of Tomori. The defender is playing at a high level for Milan every week and won the Serie A title last season, but he was also an unused substitute against Italy."

                    "body": "Joe Allen made a welcome return to full Wales training on Wednesday as he continues his rehabilitation from a hamstring injury, joining the squad as they reverted to full tilt after enjoying a recovery day. Blowup unicorns have grown synonymous with Gareth Southgate\u2019s England side and this week Wales introduced an alternative, and rather apt, species poolside: inflatable dragons.\n\u201cThe lads enjoyed it,\u201d says the midfielder Harry Wilson. \u201cWe got our recovery out of the way, which is obviously important and then it was nice to have that fun time where we were able to get in the pool. It is important to mix the work with a bit of pleasure.\u201d\nThe sight of Brennan Johnson and Dylan Levitt riding a giant red dragon during a 20-minute splash around in the pool offers a snapshot into the importance of downtime at a tournament where the spotlight is so fierce. Three Group B matches in eight days, with Iran next on Friday and then England on Tuesday. The games on offer at the team hotel in West Bay include darts, pool, table tennis and golf, via a simulator requested by \u2013 who else \u2013 Gareth Bale and his best friend, Wayne Hennessey. Bale, whose golf handicap is thought to be close to scratch, has spoken about the mental respite being out on the fairways brings \u2013 \u201cpeace and quiet, with no cameras\u201d \u2013 but for now he has to settle for the next best thing.\n\n\u201cWhen he has a swing, Gaz is obviously very good,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t played as much closer to the games because his back might be feeling it a bit. We\u2019ve got a few good golfers; Locks [Tom Lockyer] has been good. Matty Smith has been top dog. Ethan Ampadu fancies himself as a good table tennis player \u2013 him and Sorba Thomas are always playing. Because they play a lot, those two are up there.\u201d\nThe other notable addition to the Wales camp is the display of rainbow-coloured flags at their Al Sadd Sports Club training base, a venue they are sharing with Japan, a reminder of their stance after the OneLove armband furore. A large rainbow flag is draped from a pitch-side tent at their training ground, while corner flags were changed in support of the LGBTQ+ community. Some Football Association of Wales staff and Wales fans had multicoloured hats confiscated before Monday\u2019s draw against the USA, with the inquest into such events ongoing.\n\nThe mood is relaxed before Wales return to the Ahmad bin Ali Stadium, where Bale\u2019s penalty salvaged a draw in their opener. Failure to take anything from that game would have cast a grim outlook on their remaining time in Qatar but if they can beat Iran on Friday they will fancy their chances of progressing to the last 16.\n\u201cIn tournament football, to not lose your first game is huge,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cThis [Iran] game is maybe the game that people think is the most winnable for us but it\u2019s still going to be tough and we need to be on our A-game. If we can get a positive result from that, that will set us up nicely going into the last game.\u201d\nIn between afternoon training and evening video analysis sessions, players gather on beanbags at the team hotel to watch the rest of the group stages unfold on a projector screen. Some play cards, others Call of Duty: Warzone. On Tuesday the squad was permitted to spend a couple of hours with their families. Wilson\u2019s grandfather, Peter, won \u00a3125,000 after a \u00a350 bet in 2000 that Wilson, then a toddler, would play for his country came true 13 years later. \u201cI\u2019ve got my immediate family over here, [plus] a couple of uncles and friends from my local town,\u201d he says. \u201cWith it being the first World Cup for 64 years, they were desperate to get over here.\u201d\nKieffer Moore, a decade on from combining playing part-time for Truro City with working as a personal trainer and lifeguard, is set to lead the line against Iran after impressing off the bench on Monday. \u201cWhen I was working at the same time I was playing, it was a lot of hard work and a lot of sacrifices I had to put in,\u201d Moore says. \u201cBut ultimately that\u2019s led me to have this work ethos which I\u2019ve carried the whole way with me and I still have now. [It gave me] life experience. Being out in the real world. When you\u2019re in the [youth] academy, I suppose you are a bit sheltered.\u201d\nThe FAW\u2019s chief executive, Noel Mooney, said it was \u201ccheap\u201d and \u201cpretty low\u201d of Fifa to suddenly threaten sporting sanctions against any players who wore the OneLove armband on the eve of their first matches. \u201cWe were told this was going to be a really inclusive, welcoming, warm World Cup,\u201d he told ITV. \u201cThat is not what I have seen, I have to say.\u201d\nMooney added of Monday: \u201cTo have our fans having their bucket hats taken off them is just appalling. I was in the stadium and I started to get messages and texts saying people were having their bucket hats taken off them. I heard shoelaces were taken off people, I heard wristbands were taken off people.\u201c"

                    "body": "The new gods are running into a bit of trouble. From the soap opera playing out at Twitter HQ, the too-big-to-fail bankruptcies in the cryptocurrency space, to mass tech layoffs, the past month has seen successive headlines declaring a litany of woes facing the bullish tech boyos in Silicon Valley and beyond. The minute-by-minute coverage of Elon Musk\u2019s escapades and the global levels of interest in the FTX collapse both go well beyond what you\u2019d expect from a business story. I\u2019m willing to gamble a few Bitcoins that the popular fixation has little to do with any particular interest in successful software engineering; rather it is the personalities who inhabit these spaces, and the philosophies that propel them in their godlike ambition. What is their end goal, we wonder. What drives them, beyond the pursuit of growth? It is easy to assume that money is all that motivates the likes of Mark Zuckerberg, Musk and Jeff Bezos. Except, when you start to examine the mindsets of these men, it\u2019s clear that cash is far from the whole story. The concept of \u201ceffective altruism\u201d has had its day in court after FTX, the world\u2019s second largest cryptocurrency exchange announced that, oops, it was mysteriously short of $8bn and would be filing for bankruptcy, post haste. As the dust \u2013 and fraud allegations \u2013 settle, the personal guiding principles of FTX\u2019s millennial chief executive, Sam Bankman-Fried, have come to the fore. Bankman-Fried ostensibly was driven into crypto by an adherence to the \u201ceffective altruism\u201d movement. Originally espousing giving as much targeted time and money to philanthropy as possible, EA has been morphed by its most prominent practitioners into getting very, very rich and then spending that money on projects that better the human race. This \u201cearn-to-give\u201d philosophy is dependent on data-driven analysis of what causes offer the best returns of \u201cbetterment\u201d. It\u2019s utilitarianism with a god complex. Since Bankman-Fried\u2019s spectacular fall from grace, it seems as if this doctrine may be doomed to the same downward spiral as its most famous disciple. It\u2019s hard to argue that you possess the best instincts to improve the prospects of the human race when you can\u2019t even keep your own affairs \u2013 or billions in customer funds \u2013 in order.  Then there was the allegation last week by the Insider journalist Julia Black that Musk, along with other billionaires, appear to be engaged in their own personal eugenics programme via a movement called \u201cpronatalism\u201d. Black writes that pronatalism \u2013 an ideology centred on having children to reverse falling birthrates in European countries, and prevent a predicted population collapse \u2013 is \u201ctaking hold in wealthy tech and venture-capitalist circles\u201d, with the aid of hi-tech genetic screening. Musk has championed pronatalist ideas publicly. Privately the Tesla co-founder is, in his own words, \u201cdoing my part\u201d; he has 10 children known to the public, two of whom are twins he fathered with an AI expert who serves as an executive for his Neuralink company. But the ideas go beyond Musk and into the canyons of Silicon Valley; the world\u2019s richest and most powerful people see it as their duty, Black claims, to \u201creplicate themselves as many times as possible\u201d. Black\u2019s subjects also namecheck effective altruism, longtermism (which prioritises the distant future over the concerns of today), and transhumanism (the evolution of humanity beyond current limitations via tech), as complementary philosophies. The concept of legacy is key to understanding our tech pioneers. As one interviewee tells Black, \u201cThe person of this subculture really sees the pathway to immortality as being through having children.\u201d Given that Musk\u2019s \u201cgenius\u201d business record is one of multiple near-bankruptcies before he even arrived at Twitter, this rather undermines the theory that the future will be safe only if populated by mini-Musks. These companies believe that in order to make visions ideas a reality, they require total control of the landscape around them. In his 2017 book World Without Mind, Franklin Foer wrote that Facebook \u2013 now Meta \u2013 was founded on the concept of \u201cradical transparency\u201d \u2013 a belief that sharing every facet of our lives will somehow result in social good. The metaverse, in which we don\u2019t just share our lives on social media but conduct them within it, is this idea\u2019s logical conclusion. It has already lost the company $9.4bn. Silicon Valley and its missionary outposts are dominated not only by the pursuit of growth, which is a means to an end. The underlying raison d\u2019etre tying these various tech titans together is their fervour for enacting their own personal theological outlooks in supposed service of the wider world. To do this, they must dominate and monopolise \u2013 remake society in their image, platform by integrated platform. When we view these monoliths as businesses like any other, or allow them to claim global monopolies, we fail to realise that they are competing for more than our attention or our cash: they are competing for the right to dictate what our societies look like. So it matters a great deal when that vision falters, or fails altogether.

                    "body": "Almost 16 years ago a quietly determined 21-year-old from North Tyneside won her first cap for England, coming off the bench in front of a couple of hundred souls at Old Albanians RFC. Sarah Hunter did not do much in her five minutes on the field \u2013 \u201cI probably touched the ball once and made one tackle\u201d \u2013 but it marked the start of a rugby odyssey that is about to propel her past every England player \u2013 of either sex \u2013 to have pulled on a white jersey. Of course there is a bigger picture as her Red Roses seek to knock out Australia on Sunday and reach the last four of a World Cup they are desperate to win. Sitting in a modest second-floor hotel room in downtown Auckland, even so, there was no disguising Hunter\u2019s intense pride at the imminent arrival of cap No 138, overtaking the great Rocky Clark and leaving her nearest male challengers Ben Youngs and Jason Leonard even further behind.  She may have thrown fewer passes than Youngs and sunk fewer career pints than Leonard but the 37-year-old Hunter is the cool, calm and capable personification of how far the women\u2019s game has progressed since she took her first tentative international steps in St Albans. From amateur to professional, from the fringes to the biggest of stages: even she still finds it slightly surreal. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy to sit here 138 caps later. I can\u2019t get my head around it. But I think the girl who won that first cap would be very proud if she knew where the journey was going to go.\u201d Perhaps her most remarkable achievement has been making it all look so relatively effortless. Beneath the polite, smiley exterior lies a woman who clearly has an inner lining of tungsten. For years the back-rower has not only endured in one of the game\u2019s most attritional positions but also shouldered captaincy duties without a hint of complaint. Imagine a modern-day Boadicea with a north-east accent and an oval ball under her arm and it becomes ever more clear why her team of English warriors are unbeaten in their last 28 Tests. No wonder there is now a mural of her up on the wall of Novocastrians RFC where she first took up rugby union aged 15. \u201cI played rugby league to start with and didn\u2019t even know there was an England women\u2019s team until I was about 16.\u201d When she made her England debut in February 2007, the old RFUW was still officially separate from the Rugby Football Union and the team did not even wear a rose on their chests. \u201cWe had what we used to joke was a tulip, or a rosebud that hadn\u2019t quite blossomed yet. It hadn\u2019t quite been allowed to come out and show what women\u2019s rugby was about.\u201d More dispiriting still was a sense of being second class citizens to their male counterparts. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the same sponsors as the men, we weren\u2019t on TV, we didn\u2019t have the audiences we do now. For my debut at Old Albanians I reckon there were about 100-200 people there, probably all our friends and family.\u201d At the time, though, Hunter was more anxious about singing the national anthem. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to mess the national anthem up. I\u2019m a terrible singer so I was really conscious of the people I stood next to. There were some incredible greats in that team. Maggie Alphonsi was playing, Sue Day was captain. You had all these great players and suddenly I was playing alongside them, I had real imposter syndrome.\u201d  Fast forward to this week and, aside from her continuing penchant for singing Sloop John B by the Beach Boys on the team bus - \u201cIt\u2019s the only song I know all the words to\u201d - it is a different world. England\u2019s women are now full-time professionals and on course for a globally-screened World Cup final at Eden Park. Close to a million viewers tuned in to their pool game against France a fortnight ago and interest continues to rise. As Hunter says: \u201cThe investment in the game and being seen on terrestrial TV has shifted things enormously. I feel pretty lucky to have experienced it.\u201d The cherry on the top would be the world crown that frustratingly eluded Hunter and England in 2017. While the Red Roses remain firm favourites they have reached the point where there is no safety net in the event of a stumble. As the head coach, Simon Middleton, acknowledges, failure would be a crushing blow for all involved. \u201cPersonally it\u2019s a huge fear. I don\u2019t like losing. It\u2019s a massive driver in everything I\u2019ve ever done. Ultimately all you can do is prepare your very best and try your very hardest.\u201d In those latter respects England are ticking along nicely, with Hunter suggesting they are now poised to raise their game another notch. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve seen as good a session as we had yesterday for a long time, if ever. We\u2019re exactly where we need to be.\u201d The prospect of a wet North Island weekend will also not concern the English unduly, given the strength of their driving maul and the close-quarters pressure they love to exert. The selection of Tatyana Heard at inside-centre is also indicative of English intent against a Wallaroos side made up of part-time players. Middleton is hopeful that by 2025 all World Cup teams will be professional \u2013 \u201cIt would be great to think so, you can see the potential in some of those sides is massive\u201d \u2013 but Hunter has been around long enough not to allow peripheral issues or personal milestones to distract her. \u201cI\u2019m immensely proud but we\u2019re in knockout rugby now and don\u2019t get any second chances. Individual accolades are great but we\u2019re here for one reason. We can\u2019t take our eye off Australia.\u201d Which means all the backslapping and congratulations from her teammates will remain very much secondary to the squad\u2019s primary mission. \u201cI\u2019m hoping it will go unnoticed and we can just roll on into the next game. They\u2019ll know me, I just want to focus on Australia. Winning a World Cup quarter-final would be the biggest thing that could mark the game for me.\u201d It is a long way from St Albans to Auckland \u2013 11,373 miles to be precise \u2013 but the steely, competitive Hunter is essentially the same as she ever was."

The aim of the game in Auckland on Saturday was to avoid Canada and be placed with lesser contenders from the other pots. Instead, the Australia find themselves in Group B with Olympic gold medallists Canada, a rapidly improving Ireland and African heavyweights Nigeria. It is, as coach Tony Gustavsson, said, \u201ca very, very trough draw\u201d.  The state of play Ireland in particular shape as a potential stumbling block the Matildas could do without, but Canada is the real problem. The world No 7s have forged a built a level of consistency that makes them favourites to top the group and, should Australia finish second, they will head straight for a perilous first knockout tie with the winners of Group D, looking at this stage to be European champions England. Lose that and it would mean a humiliating early exit from a home tournament. Should Australia top their group they will face the runner-up of Group D, likely to be either Asian champions China or Denmark, the latter of whom Gustavsson\u2019s side beat 3-1 in a friendly earlier this month. After that, the likes of Germany, France or Brazil potentially await in the quarter-finals. \u201cFor me, there\u2019s a difference between expectations and belief,\u201d Gustavsson said. \u201cI feel that we have the belief from our fans and from a nation and, with that belief and the support, that means we have an extra player on the field. \u201cExpectations is more about people speculating, what can we expect of this team based off rankings, historical results, the draw and all those things. But I leave that to others and ocus on is the belief.\u201d  The matches 20 July: Australia v Ireland \u2013 Allianz Stadium, Sydney27 July: Australia v Nigeria \u2013 Suncorp Stadium, Brisbane31 July: Canada v Australia \u2013 AAMI Park, Melbourne The teams IrelandFifa ranking: 24Coach: Vera PauwBest World Cup result: None Ireland are one of five debutants in the expanded 32-team tournament, alongside Morocco, the Philippines, Vietnam and Zambia, and will mark their first appearance at a major competition on the 50th anniversary of the Women\u2019s Football Association of Ireland. Really, though, the most significant advancements have occurred over the past five years since the national team of 2017 threatened to boycott over paltry wages and resources. Pauw, since taking over in 2019, has prioritised playing high-quality opposition with a view to growth. A year ago they beat the Matildas 3-2 in Dublin. \u201cAustralia were the better team, of course,\u201d Pauw said. \u201cBut somehow we managed to win. It was a fantastic game, and that was a turning point in our real belief that we can do something.\u201d They will have to do that something under the intense spotlight of Australia\u2019s opening match in front of home Sydney support. \u201cThe more pressure, the better,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about a task that you have to execute, it\u2019s not about how many people are in the stands. The bigger the stage, the better, because this is what we dreamed for.\u201d NigeriaFifa ranking: 45Coach: Randy WaldrumBest World Cup result: Quarter-finals (1999)   Once the undisputed powerhouse of African women\u2019s football, Nigeria are on their worst run of results to date. This month\u2019s 2-0 friendly loss to Japan in Kobe was the Super Falcons\u2019 fifth consecutive defeat and pressure is mounting on manager Waldrum, who took the reins in 2020. At July\u2019s Women\u2019s Africa Cup of Nations, the American oversaw a fourth-placed finish \u2013 their equal-lowest and a disappointment for a team who won 11 of the previous 13 tournaments. Equalling their round-of-16 berth at France 2019 seems a tall task in this group and Australia have the historical upper hand, having defeated them 2-0 in the group stage of Canada 2015. But the quality of this group of players, including Barcelona forward and 2022 Ballon d\u2019Or F\u00e9minin nominee Asisat Oshoala, is undeniable. \u201cOur expectations are to make it out of our group and make a deep run at the World Cup,\u201d Waldrum said earlier in October before the draw. \u201cWe feel like we have the talent to do that, and right now we just need time to gather the team and prepare properly.\u201d  CanadaFifa ranking: 7Coach: Bev PriestmanBest World Cup result: Quarter-finals (2015) Canada cemented themselves as a World Cup contender when they won gold at last year\u2019s Tokyo 2020 Olympics. Since then they have further matured under Priestman and are unbeaten in 2022 apart from a 1-0 loss to the top-ranked United States in July\u2019s Concacaf Women\u2019s Championship final. One of their victims this year was Australia, who they beat 1-0 and 2-1 in Brisbane and Sydney last month. Those friendly wins \u2013 with an understrength squad \u2013 make them clear favourites to top the group. \u201cThat experience will definitely be invaluable for sure,\u201d Priestman said after the draw. \u201cBut, at the end of the day, what matters is when they play us in a World Cup. And I think for them, after two losses at home, they\u2019re going to want to come out and show that when it really matters. So we can\u2019t underestimate them. Our group, it could be worse but it could be better. I\u2019m feeling good.\u201d"

                    "body": "Jesse Marsch had started to resemble a hill walker lacking a compass, map or mobile phone signal who finds himself stranded among unfamiliar and remote terrain as dusk descends. The last glimmer of light finally faded on his Elland Road tenure on Monday when he was sacked as Leeds\u2019s manager 11 months after succeeding Marcelo Bielsa, but as early as New Year\u2019s Eve the endgame had begun. Leeds had just earned a hard-fought point at Newcastle, but it swiftly became clear all was far from well. \u201cThis job\u2019s always stressful,\u201d said a man whose team failed to win his final seven league games and are out of the relegation zone on goal difference.  \u201cIt\u2019s like I hate it but I have to keep going. I try to enjoy the moment and be there for everyone but I hate the stress. The enjoyment is the people at the club and the players and the relationships we have. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing better than standing in the technical area right before kick-off; it\u2019s right where you want to be \u2013 but it\u2019s also awful, stressful beyond belief. And then, when what defines matches is such a fine margin of success and failure, it\u2019s not so easy to process. For a manager it can be lonely \u2013 2022 had been a big challenge for me, a difficult year.\u201d The 49-year-old was always refreshingly open emotionally, but a man deeply affected by the sudden death of a close friend, the leading American sports writer Grant Wahl, at the World Cup in Qatar in December, had never been quite that candid or seemed so vulnerable. Marsch and Wahl forged a tight bond as students at Princeton University, where the former majored in history, producing an 117-page thesis entitled: \u201cShaken not stirred: an evaluation of earthquake awareness in California\u201d. The academic side of Marsch coexisted with the down to earth, streetwise edge acquired during his working-class childhood as the son of a tractor factory production line worker in Racine, Wisconsin. The United States midwest is noted for the niceness and humility of its inhabitants, but when Marsch first arrived at Leeds, a certain cockiness that had, as a player, helped turn him into a fearsomely competitive midfield enforcer in the MLS, was manifested by the sort of macho technical area body language that frequently annoyed rival managers.  Behind that sometimes brash facade, the former New York Red Bulls, RB Salzburg and RB Leipzig manager was said to be an empathic, nuanced, intelligent character very much liked by backroom staff at Elland Road and increasingly distraught at the team\u2019s failure to implement his gameplans. \u201cWe keep finding ways to lose,\u201d he said recently. \u201cI blame myself for failing to press the right tactical buttons with the players.\u201d Albeit in a different context, pressing proved a big part of his problem. Leeds won promotion to the top tier and enjoyed a ninth-placed Premier League finish deploying the intense, high-energy, counter-pressing game devised by Bielsa, but by the time the American replaced the Argentinian the team were in a relegation skirmish and looked burned out. Victor Orta, the director of football, accepted Bielsa\u2019s time was up but remained addicted to his aggressive brand of football and appointed Marsch on the basis he had enjoyed success in Austria, if not Germany, with a broadly similar approach. Much as Leeds often remained exhilarating to watch they never appeared in control of games and always looked liable to concede soft goals. Another problem was that the new man hated Bielsa\u2019s autocratic managerial style. Marsch immediately allowed players to have their say in tactical debate, but said recently a couple struggled to use such freedom responsibly, while others took time to adapt to such cultural change.  Then there were the injury problems that sidelined the striker Patrick Bamford, who had scored 17 top-flight goals in their first season back in the Premier League. Last summer\u2019s sale of the outstanding Raphinha and Kalvin Phillips, to Barcelona and Manchester City respectively, hardly helped. Orta, who is understood to have long fought hard to keep him, had helped secure some potentially transformative January signings in the \u00a335m France Under-21 forward Georginio Rutter, the \u00a310m Austria defender Max W\u00f6ber and the Juventus loanee midfielder Weston McKennie. The decision not to give Marsch time to continue working with them \u2013 or indeed the promising individuals such as Tyler Adams and Willy Gnonto included in last summer\u2019s mixed bag of buys \u2013 reflects not merely the possibly ruinous cost of relegation but the reality that it could jeopardise the full takeover by the San Francisco-based 49er Enterprises, which owns 44% of the shares. It is no exaggeration to say the club\u2019s future hinges on the new manager\u2019s ability to recalibrate a side perhaps ill-suited to the pressing philosophy beloved by Orta."

Wales, who beat Austria 2-1 in a playoff semi-final on 24 March courtesy of two superb goals from Gareth Bale, will face the winners of a match between Scotland and Ukraine.  Wales were semi-finalists at Euro 2016 and reached the round of 16 at Euro 2020. They would perhaps represent the most challenging opponents for Gregg Berhalter\u2019s men. Bale will be 33 at kick-off in Qatar but the Real Madrid reserve remains a formidable talent, while the pace of Leeds United attacker Dan James tormented Austria. Scotland were bottom of their group at Euro 2020. They were ultimately well beaten by the Czech Republic and Croatia but did pick up a point with a spirited performance against England at Wembley. Ukraine were third in their group behind the Netherlands and Austria but still made it to the quarter-finals. They raised their game for a 2-1 extra-time win over Sweden in the first knockout round, but lost 4-0 to England. Fifa world ranking Wales 18th; Ukraine 27th; Scotland 39th Best World Cup performance Wales, quarter-finals, 1958; Ukraine, quarter-finals, 2006; Scotland, group stage, eight times England, 25 November A fixture that always fizzes with historical and cultural resonance, and it\u2019ll be extra-special not only for Chelsea\u2019s Christian Pulisic, but for two other players who started against Costa Rica this week: Yunus Musah, a former England youth international who was courted by Gareth Southgate before choosing the US last year, and the Milton Keynes-born Fulham defender Antonee Robinson. The England connections don\u2019t end there: Gio Reyna was born in Sunderland; goalkeeper Zack Steffen plays for Manchester City, while a possible first choice between the posts in Qatar, Matt Turner, is joining Arsenal in the summer; another goalkeeper, Ethan Horvath, is on the books at Nottingham Forest. England ran out 3-0 winners in the most recent meeting between the sides, a friendly in 2018 that was DC United legend Wayne Rooney\u2019s international farewell \u2013 not that a game from four years ago means much considering the US\u2019s dramatic rebuilding job under Berhalter. Both nations are replete with exciting young talent, Jude Bellingham at the top of the English rising star list \u2013 but England are a few years ahead of the US on the learning curve and boast more recent big tournament experience and more players at leading clubs. Their depth and ability in midfield is likely to pose problems for the US \u2013 as it would for most teams. The current American first-choice center back pairing of Miles Robinson and Walker Zimmerman have been stalwarts in Concacaf qualifying lately, but will the MLS pair be able to handle Harry Kane and Raheem Stirling? Famously \u2013 or infamously, depending on whether you spell \u201ccolor\u201d with a \u201cu\u201d or not \u2013 the nations met in 1950 and 2010, when Steven Gerrard\u2019s early goal settled any English nerves. Oh wait, it didn\u2019t. A few minutes before half time came the spill heard round the world, as goalkeeper Robert Green\u2019s howler donated an equalizer to Clint Dempsey. The game ended 1-1 and thanks to Landon Donovan\u2019s late heroics against Algeria the US went on to top the group ahead of Fabio Capello\u2019s side. Southgate\u2019s team is more vibrant, more talented, more cohesive and coached far better, than that elderly, stilted and stressed-out England crop. They reached the semi-finals four years ago, losing 2-1 after extra time to a more savvy Croatia. Were it not for the manager\u2019s tactical caution in last year\u2019s Euro 2020 final against Italy, as the Three Lions failed to add to an early lead then were pinned back in the second half (similar to the Croatia semi), and the mismanagement of the penalty shootout, they\u2019d probably be going into this tournament as European champions. As it is, they\u2019re likely to be hungry, confident and still improving when November rolls around. England were imperious in qualifying, albeit in a relatively easy group, scoring 39 times and conceding only three goals. They are the obvious favorites to top Group B in Qatar. Key player Harry Kane Fifa world ranking 5th How they qualified First in group, with eight wins and two draws from 10 games Best World Cup performance Winners, 1966 Iran, 29 November Not a team to take lightly. This will be the third successive World Cup appearance for Iran, who ended up with the most points of any side in the final round of the Asian qualifiers. They reached Qatar back in January with three group games to spare. And they conceded only four goals as they topped their group\u2019s table ahead of South Korea, who nonetheless beat them 2-0 in Seoul on 24 March. Though Iran will be taking part in their sixth World Cup, they\u2019ve never gone beyond the group stage. They were fairly impressive while finishing third in their group in 2018, though: beating Morocco 1-0 in their opening game, losing 1-0 to Spain, then securing a 1-1 draw with Portugal courtesy of an injury-time penalty. In 29-year-old Porto striker Mehdi Taremi, who has scored 21 times this season for club and country, Iran have a bona fide goal threat \u2013 even when he\u2019s upside-down. So is Sardar Azmoun, who joined Bayer Leverkusen in January after a prolific spell with Zenit St Petersburg. There was, though, some tension last year between Taremi and the head coach, Dragan Sko\u010di\u0107. That seems to be in the past; after all, they reportedly followed each other on Twitter, so everything must be OK.

                    "body": "England\u2019s head coach, Steve Borthwick, has acknowledged his team are trailing in the wake of several of their major rivals and need to start finishing games more strongly if they are to be a rejuvenated force in this season\u2019s Six Nations championship and the Rugby World Cup later this year. While England did manage to secure their first victory under him by beating Italy 31-14 on Sunday, there was a stark contrast between the quality of their performance and Saturday\u2019s epic game between Ireland and France in Dublin. England still have to face both those sides after their meeting with Wales in Cardiff on Saturday week.  Borthwick is not even trying to claim that England, having sacked Eddie Jones in December, are remotely on the same level as Europe\u2019s market leaders. \u201cThe standard of those teams is phenomenal,\u201d he said, reflecting on his first fortnight as national head coach. \u201cIf you look at them they are strong and we are a bit behind them. I can\u2019t tell you how much but we are behind them.\u201d England supporters are also being advised by Borthwick that the rebuilding job could be a lengthy one. \u201cI can\u2019t answer that question,\u201d he said, when asked how soon he thought the team could narrow the gap. \u201cI can\u2019t do anything about where they are but we are going to work really hard to catch up as fast as we can. I get the sense that people recognise this is a rebuild and that there is plenty to do here. The players have come through a tough time and I am asking them to do things in a different way.\u201d Borthwick suggested two weeks ago that, statistically, the England team he inherited were not good in any area and the Italy game has not significantly altered that view. \u201cThere are lots of things to improve on. One of my key jobs is prioritising two or three key things each week we need to improve upon. Because if we try and get better at everything we\u2019ll get better at nothing. Our defence and our maul moved forward but there are things that were not good enough.\u201d  Among them is England\u2019s failure to pick up the pace in the final quarter, having allowed a potential victory to slip away against Scotland and then lost the second-half against Italy by 14-12. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep letting teams have momentum late in games against us,\u201d said Borthwick. \u201cI really need to understand why it happened and how it happened.\u201d On the plus side Tom Curry and Courtney Lawes are both hopeful of being fit for the trip to Wales, currently without a win after their opening two games. English professional club rugby, meanwhile, is heading for a fresh row after it was announced that the Championship leaders Ealing Trailfinders cannot be promoted to the Premiership at the end of the season. The club\u2019s Vallis Way stadium has been deemed not to have met this season\u2019s revised minimum standards criteria because it does not accommodate 10,000 spectators. Ealing were similarly denied last year and have been taking legal advice. They contend the stadium capacity demands are unlawful and that a lack of clarity over the size of the league in 2024-25 currently makes it impossible to invest the sums required to upgrade their stadium or buy the vital \u201cP share\u201d entitling them to an annual share of central funding. Ealing have a fortnight to lodge an appeal against the decision. Doncaster Knights have been told they are eligible for promotion, but they sit fifth in the table and have no chance of finishing top. Their Castle Park ground has a licensed capacity of more than 5,000, with planning permission to extend beyond 10,000. The France prop, Uini Atonio, has been cited for the tackle on Ireland\u2019s Rob Herring which earned him a yellow card during Saturday\u2019s game at the Aviva Stadium. Atonio will appear before an independent disciplinary hearing on Wednesday chaired by Judge Mike Mika of New Zealand, with former players Leon Lloyd and South Africa\u2019s Stefan Terblanche also on the panel."

                    "body": "\u201cWe have Chelsea on Sunday, this is what I\u2019m interested in.\u201d Mikel Arteta\u2019s response to the question of Takehiro Tomiyasu\u2019s chances of being fit for the World Cup was jarring. Though Arteta had already expressed sympathy for the Japan defender\u2019s predicament, he was reinforcing the importance to Arsenal of an away fixture signposted for some time. Since Old Trafford on 4 September in fact. Arsenal\u2019s sole loss of their league season, a 3-1 defeat in which they were picked off by Manchester United\u2019s counterattacking, was a wobble, but a fine run since, including home victories over Tottenham and Liverpool, has lessened the residual pain. However, in a season where Manchester City are just two points behind despite the 1-1 draw at Southampton on 23 October being the only other blemish, Arsenal\u2019s margin for error does not include losing at their London rivals.  Win at Chelsea, with only Wolves to come in the Premier League before the World Cup, and Arsenal can expect to be leaders as top-level domestic football is mothballed. To be at the summit after only 14 games is not too much of a prize, falling short of the half-season credentials that in Germany, Spain and Italy sees teams crowned as \u201cwinter champions\u201d, but it has been a clear objective for Arteta. And a sincere test of the husbandry of his squad. \u201cWe managed the load of the players in the last four weeks because of the amount of games that we have played,\u201d he said after shuffling his pack against FC Z\u00fcrich had resulted in a narrow 1-0 win. That completed another key Arsenal objective, winning their Europa League group and thus avoiding a two-legged tie in February against a Champions League dropout. Arteta is also negotiating another unwanted variable that the World Cup\u2019s hopefully unique scheduling has asked of managers. Tomiyasu\u2019s panic, like the one that Bukayo Saka suffered after limping off against Nottingham Forest last week, was not particularly Arteta\u2019s problem. His singular focus is having his players ready to play for Arsenal, and not in a tournament where they can only suffer more wear and tear. \u201cWith the amount of games that we\u2019re playing, it\u2019s part of it,\u201d he said of the knocks that cause worldwide headlines when a previously Qatar-bound player pulls up lame. \u201cIt can happen in training, it can happen in games.\u201d Tunnel vision has been the key principle of Arteta\u2019s Arsenal reign. Next month it will be three years since his appointment, and this team feels like one built in his determined self-image. Gabriel Jesus, captain against FC Z\u00fcrich, has added myriad dimensions, pressing from the front, and, despite a barren run in front of goal that extends back to 1 October, remains by far their most important attacker.  Arsenal have benefited hugely from the close working relationship Arteta struck with Jesus at Manchester City when Pep Guardiola\u2019s assistant. Jesus\u2019s influence on his compatriot Gabriel Martinelli is clear and Saka, at 21, has become a dependable veteran in a first-choice forward line forever in perpetual motion. Such symbiosis comes in contrast to the severed alliance between Arteta and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, expected to play some part for Chelsea in Sunday\u2019s midday kick-off. \u201cHe seems to be happy,\u201d said Arteta of his former captain, unprepared to reveal any deeper knowledge or feelings beyond that. Aubameyang, like Mesut \u00d6zil before him, was ruthlessly scrubbed from the picture by a manager who, like Guardiola, believes in a cult of the collective, though one where the manager holds by far the greatest weight of influence. Each of Arsenal\u2019s leading players this season owes plenty to Arteta\u2019s patronage. Aaron Ramsdale in goal, Ben White as a remodelled, high-grade attacking full-back, the central defensive partnership of William Saliba and Gabriel Magalh\u00e3es, the renovated, revived Granit Xhaka, and Martin \u00d8degaard, captain and creative director behind the forward line, have all been reinvented, given fresh identity, by their manager. \u201cTrust the process\u201d was a catchphrase previously used sarcastically by Arteta doubters but this season has seen a unity among fans not seen since Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s peak years. Arteta is undefeated in all three Premier League visits to Stamford Bridge. April\u2019s 4-2 win there included a predatory double by Eddie Nketiah. Against Graham Potter, the record is less promising, Arsenal losing three of six Premier League encounters to Brighton, including a 2-1 home defeat in April that did serious damage to last season\u2019s failed top-four challenge. Old Trafford in September was \u201ca big lesson\u201d in Arteta\u2019s words, one his team recovered admirably from. Stamford Bridge, and three points, can help ensure that when the Premier League returns his team have the head start they have worked so hard for."

                    "body": "Nobody does it like Ronaldo. A couple of weeks ago, he says, a fan club sent him some stats. They had worked out that he had dribbled round the goalkeeper to score more than 90 times in his career, more than a fifth of his absurd goal catalogue. There is a gasp and not for the first time \u2013 not for the last, either \u2013 that smile flashes across his face and there\u2019s a glint in his eye again. A man you could bet your house on, it\u2019s just what he did over a career that took in three World Cup finals, two Ballons d\u2019Or and more than 400 goals. Just don\u2019t ask others to emulate him, even if you explain how. He knows \u2013 he has tried. Now the owner of Real Valladolid and Cruzeiro, Ronaldo explains: \u201cWith five minutes left in one my first games as Valladolid president, Keko Gont\u00e1n was clean through one on one. Three metres out, desperate, he shot straight at the goalkeeper. After, I said: \u2018Bloody hell, man, what did you do?! You could have gone round him. Anything but kicking it straight at him.\u2019 He said: \u2018It\u2019s hard when you\u2019re out there\u2019.\u201d  Not the way Ronaldo tells it, it isn\u2019t. \u201cI told him in that position, you can have all the calmness in the world: everything is in your favour. Whatever you do, it\u2019ll work. I\u2019ve never seen the goal look small, although I\u2019ve seen goalkeepers grow, but you have peripheral vision, see it all: keeper, ball, goal. I explained how I did it, the movement. If he comes to you, you\u2019ll beat him for speed going round him; if he holds and you shoot even a metre from him, he can\u2019t get down. I explained my technique, and \u2026\u201d The 46-year-old Ronaldo cracks up again. \u201cAnd Keko says: \u2018Yeah, but you\u2019re \u2018Il Fenomeno\u2019. I reached the conclusion that I can\u2019t explain it because it was difficult for him to understand, and in reality it\u2019s very simple.\u201d That\u2019s how Ronaldo made it look, at least. A player so good, so superior, so assured, it appeared effortless. Like he could just turn up and be the best. The personality helped too. Even now, sitting here, there\u2019s an ease about him, an enjoyment: few footballers were as fun to watch, or to talk to. And Ronaldo can talk. Instantly likable, intelligent and incisive, he chats enthusiastically about how goals are like his children \u2013 lots of them and loved equally \u2013 how he adapted when injury left him unable to \u201cbeat five or six\u201d, and why false 9s are not for him, the greatest No 9 of all. \u201cI never believed in that,\u201d he says, laughing \u201cand, look, now Pep\u2019s in love with a No 9 as well.\u201d He talks about Neymar and Lionel Messi, Diego Maradona and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, \u201cthe player most like me\u201d, and addresses the eternal debate over Brazil\u2019s style and why he could never manage the canarinha but would like Guardiola to. Yet being Il Fenomeno wasn\u2019t always fun. While not one to linger long on the bad moments, there have been plenty of them \u2013 and simple really isn\u2019t the word. Almost the first he uses as he sits down is pressure and in purely sporting terms there may never have been a player who paid as high or public a price for it, a crisis unfolding before the world\u2019s cameras. One so huge it sparked a million conspiracy theories and became a parliamentary inquiry, the victim called to testify, interrogated as if he were the accused.  In 1998, Ronaldo suffered a seizure on the day of the World Cup final. Rushed to hospital, he was there by kick-off, only he wasn\u2019t really there at all. Now that day and the long, painful journey back to the final in 2002 \u2013 from the moment the pressure provoked the anxiety attack that destroyed his greatest dream to the horrific knee injury doctors said would end his career entirely \u2013 is told in a powerful, often painful film from Zoom Sport and Dazn studios. There is a scene in The Phenomenon in which he and roommate Roberto Carlos talk about that day. \u201cHow long was I out for?\u201d Ronaldo asks. \u201cThree minutes,\u201d he is told. Ronaldo doesn\u2019t remember any of it. Nor did he truly appreciate what it was and what followed made things worse; aided by therapy over the past two years, with the film too, he understands better now. When the director, Duncan McMath, took the final cut to London to show him, Ronaldo cried. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand why so many bad things were happening to me,\u201d he says. \u201cIf everyone loves me, I\u2019m a good person, honest, funny sometimes, why? It was so hard. The decisions someone so young, just 22, had to take. All the pressure, and without psychological help. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t something really talked about, a thing. Nowadays we talk a lot about the mental health of sports people. In that era, we were gladiators: they threw us into the arena and let\u2019s see who comes out alive. The pressure pushed me ever further down. You\u2019re so young you don\u2019t know how to manage it. It has a cost. I\u2019ve learned talking by taking hostias [hits]. It was hard, but it was beautiful.\u201d  Because four years later, he was in another final. Brazil had faced England en route to redemption \u2013 \u201cRonaldinho always says, very convinced, that he wanted to put that shot there but he tried it again 10 times for TV and didn\u2019t hit one,\u201d Ronaldo laughs \u2013 and although Michael Owen\u2019s goal \u201cfrightened us\u201d, they beat Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson\u2019s team in the quarter-finals, then Turkey. Germany awaited. \u201cThe ghosts of 98 haunted me,\u201d Ronaldo admits in the film but in Yokohama he scored twice, making Brazil world champions. On 90 minutes he was withdrawn, everything flooding back. Ronaldinho embraced him, holding tight. \u201cI don\u2019t remember what he said,\u201d Ronaldo jokes. \u201cI could invent something if you like, something like: \u2018What are we doing later?\u2019 It was very emotional and I do remember what I said to Rodrigo [Paiva, the team\u2019s communications director]. He had been with me through the recovery, saw me suffer, and I couldn\u2019t hold my emotions any longer. We hugged, remembering everything we\u2019d been through.\u201d \u201cGod has been good to me, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d Ronaldo told him. It closed a cycle, and not just for him. That was the last time Brazil or any non-European nation won the World Cup but Ronaldo is excited about Qatar now, optimistic that the sele\u00e7\u00e3o can be successful again. \u201cThere\u2019s been a European dominance: winning and playing well. Dynamic, aggressive football, organised tactically, even scoring goals \u00e0 la Brasil. Football arte,\u201d he says. \u201cFrance, Spain. Germany are always there. England produced a great Euros. But Argentina have gone 35 unbeaten. Brazil look very good, super-favoritos, although that doesn\u2019t count for anything. In Brazil, we want to win. People talk a lot about 82, who played very well, but didn\u2019t win. In 94, people say we didn\u2019t play well and, well, who cares?! \u201cLet\u2019s see what Tite does. He has options up front, very good ones. Vin\u00edcius has to start \u2013 he would start in any team in the world. On the right, Raphinha is playing incredibly, but we have Rodrygo, who would get in anywhere. Then there\u2019s Neymar. He\u2019s got the desire, he\u2019s sharp and in good shape.\u201d Yet not well-liked? On Ronaldo\u2019s wall at home is a photograph of the standing ovation at Old Trafford in 2003, a night when he left \u201cfeeling grateful, in love with Manchester United fans\u201d; it\u2019s hard to imagine with Neymar. Despite scoring 75 international goals, two behind Pel\u00e9\u2019s Brazil record, there\u2019s not the same warmth surrounding him.  \u201cNo, people love him a lot,\u201d Ronaldo insists. \u201cIf we talk specifically about football, I doubt there\u2019s anyone who doesn\u2019t love him. His private life transcends football but I\u2019m not interested. He\u2019s daring, has skill, variety, is quick, scores goals, has personality. You could compare him to Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, even though they\u2019re from a different planet. On the pitch Neymar is one [thing], then people mix in all the other stuff.\u201d That includes publicly backing Jair Bolsonaro in the elections. The president has successfully adopted, even appropriated, Brazil\u2019s shirt \u2013 politicising it to the extent that some suggested the national team stop wearing yellow. Ronaldo has watched the debates, lamenting the level, and sighs when the subject is raised. Asked who the shirt belongs to, he replies: \u201cTo all Brazilians.\u201d \u201cWhoever wants to use it, uses it. There\u2019s not appropriation. There\u2019s a political war in Brazil now like in Spain, the US, everywhere. We\u2019re in a very polarised moment, very intolerant. You choose a side, the other side hates you. I ask us to be more tolerant of different ideas. Less radical. There can only be dialogue, improvement, without extremists. I haven\u2019t declared my vote precisely because of where the Brazilian people find themselves. I\u2019m calmer, accepting of people\u2019s choices. Everyone needs Brazil to be a better country.\u201d Ronaldo returns to the team, the forward line called to emulate him, Rivaldo and Ronaldinho. \u201cGabriel Jesus is playing very well again having joined Arsenal,\u201d he says. \u201cRicharlison guarantees goals. Antony, too. Tite has a problem.\u201d  It\u2019s not a problem he would fancy. \u201cI dribbled round being a manager: I bought the teams instead. But I don\u2019t interfere, eh!\u201d he says, grinning. \u201cManaging never attracted me, no, no: zero, zero, zero. I love football but the idea of being a coach kills me, always killed me. A player does what he has to, goes home, that\u2019s it. A coach has 25 guys \u2013 young, bastards, sons of bitches \u2013 all wanting to screw you. Unthinkable. Never. But I admire them, their love for football. I love football but couldn\u2019t put up with that; they were born for it.\u201d Ronaldo is not so sure Tite will walk after the World Cup, despite reports Guardiola had been offered the job and that a non-Brazilian could take the sele\u00e7\u00e3o for the first time. The idea divides but Ronaldo insists: \u201cI would love it. A European not just with the Brazilian national team but the entire Brazilian football industry. A Pep or an Ancelotti could be historic, it could change our history for 100 years.\u201d There\u2019s just one problem: Pep said no. Could you convince him to sign? \u201cFor Cruzeiro or Valladolid?\u201d Ronaldo shoots back. \u201cI have budget issues!\u201d Besides, Qatar comes first. If it can\u2019t be Brazil, would you like Messi to win the World Cup? \u201cIf he nationalised for Spain,\u201d Ronaldo says swiftly, flashing that smile. \u201cThe Brazil-Argentina rivalry is so big. We had incredible battles, with respect, and that\u2019s the loveliest thing in football. But Argentina winning the World Cup doesn\u2019t bear thinking about. Does Messi deserve it? Of course he does \u2013 but not with my support. I love him and he\u2019ll understand because I\u2019m sure he would feel exactly the same way. When you win there\u2019s respect too: like Diego, who\u2019s so respected in Brazil. But, nah.\u201d  Laid on a plate like that, even Keko couldn\u2019t miss this one. So, Maradona or Messi? \u201cThat\u2019s unfair,\u201d Ronaldo, who is now 46, replies. \u201cI think there is a very, very special group where you have Diego, Messi, Cruyff, Beckenbauer, Pel\u00e9, Van Basten, Ronaldinho. I would include myself. Let the fans say, let them debate it in the bars. But you can\u2019t rank them, can\u2019t compare generations. \u201cPeople call me Original Ronaldo but, bloody hell, there were others \u2013 and they weren\u2019t false. I\u2019m not the only one and more will come along and be better than me, in everything. \u201cI did what I could, the best I could. I\u2019m doing other things now, important things, and I want to keep improving myself. As a footballer I can\u2019t do any more now.\u201d He has done enough, and quite unlike anyone else ever. The hard way too, however easy he made it look."

                    "body": "There is a light in Kweku\u2019s eyes. \u201cThis is just incredible, crazy,\u201d he says. \u201cYou see it from the outside and it\u2019s amazing. You live it from the inside and it\u2019s even more amazing. It\u2019s like a master\u2019s. I\u2019m learning something new every day and about myself too. I\u2019m internalising more. There were things I didn\u2019t think about before and now I do.\u201d\nThis is not just a World Cup. For I\u00f1aki Williams, this is transformative, life changing, a different man with a different name. Here, he\u2019s Kweku, born on a Wednesday. And he\u2019s beaming.\nBack home, both homes, his family are too. Especially his proud 90-year-old grandfather Richard, who made this happen. Across Doha, 11km and a world away, so is his little brother Nico. Inseparable until now, teammates too, they made international debuts a day apart but for different countries, Nico joining Spain while I\u00f1aki, now 28, finally agreed to play for Ghana.\n\n\u201cThis is allowing me to get closer to my roots, my culture, what my parents inculcated,\u201d I\u00f1aki says. \u201cI\u2019m proud of everything I\u2019m seeing, living, representing their country. I\u2019m very, very happy to have taken this decision.\u201d\nIt shows. It also took a long time. Williams was 20 when his mother, Maria, finally told him the full story: how she was pregnant with him as she and her husband, Felix, crossed the Sahara by truck and barefoot, climbing the fence into Spain. Born in Bilbao, by then he was in the first team at Athletic, for whom he has now played 246 consecutive league games. He played once for Spain, in a 2016 friendly, but resisted approaches from Ghana.\n\u201cI feel Basque and can\u2019t con anyone,\u201d Williams said in October 2021, explaining that he didn\u2019t think it right to occupy a place belonging to another player for whom playing for Ghana was everything. \u201cWhen the federation president came to Bilbao in March or April to convince me, I replied with the same words I told you. When I said that, I felt it. And part of me often still feels it.\u201d\nWhat changed? Sitting here, listening to him, the answer appears obvious: everything. But that came next. First came the path here. \u201cUntil the president came, I hadn\u2019t had a real, 100% chance. But I still said no.\u201d the forward says. \u201cThey told me to think about it. I didn\u2019t need to decide overnight. \n\u201cI talked to my parents and it made them happy to think of me playing for the country they\u2019re from, where they feel loved, where we have the family. But I wasn\u2019t sure. I could miss important games for Athletic, which could be a problem. You keep thinking, turning it over. Then Ghana reached the World Cup and, I\u2019m not going to lie, that helps. But I still wasn\u2019t clear.\u201d\n\nGhana were and they wouldn\u2019t give up. \u201cThe coach [Otto Addo] called various times. They wanted to show me how keen they were, their affection for me, what a good footballer they thought I was. But I still wasn\u2019t clear until I went to Ghana this summer with my parents, my family and girlfriend. We went to see the country, the family in Accra and Kumasi. It was emotional, like the whole city was waiting when I got out the car. It was incredible, incredible. And that\u2019s where everything changed.\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I went to talk to my grandad. I told him there was a chance that I could play for Ghana at the World Cup and what did he think. He said straight away that he didn\u2019t have long left to live and he dreamed of his grandson playing for Ghana. There was nothing left to think about then.\u201d\nRichard told his grandson he could now die a happy man. \u201cIt was very emotional,\u201d Williams says. \u201cWe never had much personal contact. They were in Ghana, I was in Spain, although there were calls. Every time he talks about his grandson he fills with pride.\n\u201cI was scared of taking this decision because of what people there would think. What people thought in Spain didn\u2019t bother me. I didn\u2019t know in Ghana they would see me as one of them. But there\u2019s been no rejection anywhere. Every message was positive. \n\u201cI spoke to the captains: Jordan [Ayew], Thomas [Partey] and Daniel Amartey. I wanted their view because I didn\u2019t want to cause any problems and they were super-receptive. Even people like Asamoah Gyan, Michael Essien, icons, got in touch to say how happy they would be for me to join.\n\u201cI now know one of the reasons people in Ghana smile, and that\u2019s football,\u201d Williams says, but it goes deeper. He found a place, something new; he also found himself. He says he feels more Ghanaian now, down to the name: \u201cEveryone calls me Kweku in the national team, like my parents and Ghanaian family. You get the name according to the day you were born.\u201d \nIf everything is different, there\u2019s a certain familiarity. From the language \u2013 his English is better by the day, federation staff say \u2013 to the pre-match routines, music, even the traditional dress Ghana wore on arrival.\n\u201cMy mum was happy with the photos,\u201d Williams says, grinning. \u201cIt\u2019s what Nico and I grew up with. I\u2019m used to the food too. I\u2019m a massive fan of my mum\u2019s Ghanaian rice. I love being part of that culture, being able to live it here. I know many of the songs because we would sing at church to bring good luck. Others my parents sang us when we were little. I can understand the language, Twi, and make myself understood.\n\u201cThe dressing room is totally different to Europe. At Athletic, we do pray together, arms around our shoulders, but here it\u2019s a step again with music, happiness, people dancing. A different vibe. It\u2019s been a lovely surprise. There are things I would like to take back to Athletic\u2019s dressing room.\u201d Williams laughs. \u201cI send videos to the [Athletic] team chat. They think it\u2019s incredible. The culture is totally different. I come from Europe, my friends are European, Basque. This is getting me closer to my roots.\u201d\n\nTo yourself? \u201cYes,\u201d he says. \u201cI spoke to [club-mate] \u00d3scar de Marcos about this. One of the things that most made an impact is that I\u2019m used to being in a dressing room where, apart from me and my brother, they\u2019re all white. Now looking to the right, to the left, to the guy in front, feeling that many have been through something similar to you, that their childhood wasn\u2019t easy either or their parents also had to emigrate, means I identify.\u201d\nGhana are in a group \u2013 with Portugal, Uruguay and South Korea \u2013 where \u201cyou can be first, you can be last\u201d, Williams says. He talks about Son Heung-min, Lee Kang-in, laughs at memories of getting kicked by Pepe, \u201cone of the hardest defenders I\u2019ve ever faced\u201d, and defends Cristiano Ronaldo. \u201cThe lord of the goals,\u201d Williams calls him. \u201cPeople haven\u2019t always respected a player who\u2019s given so, so much to football, who many of us grew up admiring, watching his football, his magnificent goals, his tireless work.\u201d\nBut it is Uruguay in the final group game that most occupies them \u201cIt\u2019s a score to settle, I know, I know,\u201d Williams says. \u201cWhen the draw happened, I was reading people on Twitter, the knife already between their teeth. It\u2019s a game circled on the fixture list. Hopefully we can reach it on six points, fighting for first place.\u201d\nGo through and the most familiar face of all may await on the other side. At the earliest, Ghana could meet Spain, Inaki could meet Nico, in a quarter-final. They are in the same city but haven\u2019t seen each otherand this may be, Williams says, the longest he has gone without seeing the brother for whom he has been practically a father. He admits asking the Athletic and Spain goalkeeper Unai Sim\u00f3n to keep an eye on Nico. \u201cBut Nico\u2019s easy, there are young players he knows and from what he\u2019s told me and what I\u2019ve seen he\u2019s enjoying it loads. I would love to have my brother here.\u201d\nHe would enjoy this, too. \u201cI really want to play an African Nations,\u201d Williams says. \u201cI understand people could have doubts but I\u2019m committed. Having the World Cup matters \u2013 I prefer 1,000 times that Ghana are there \u2013 but I give my word: I\u2019ll play the African Nations, qualifiers, everything, because I love football and I\u2019m loving wearing the Ghana shirt so much.\u201d\nFor Williams the World Cup is huge, but not an end in itself. Instead, it has proved the beginning of something bigger, more profound. \u201cSome family arrived from Ghana this morning,\u201d he says. \u201cI hope to see them before I play, hug them, have them fill me with positive energy. \n\u201cI spoke to my grandad and he\u2019s so proud, looking forward to me playing. I miss my brother, but it\u2019s for a good cause. It\u2019s not every day you get to play a World Cup. I\u2019m going to follow him, he\u2019s going to follow me and hopefully our paths cross and we can \u2018paint their faces\u2019, do them over. \n\u201cIt would be incredible for two brothers to play each other at this level and I really hope it happens. God willing on 9 December, my grandad is sitting there watching the game, wanting me to beat Nico.\u201d"

                    "body": "Wales\u2019s hopes of reaching the Women\u2019s World Cup and a first major tournament will boil down to the playoffs. A goalless draw at home to Slovenia on a record-breaking night in Cardiff was sufficient to secure their place as runners-up in Group I and a spot in Friday\u2019s draw in Switzerland.\nThe Wales manager, Gemma Grainger, was here in June when the men\u2019s team secured a place at the World Cup via a playoff final victory over Ukraine and now her side will have a chance to replicate their journey. \u201cTo see the young girls interacting with our players and how we\u2019re inspiring 12,000 people, it\u2019s incredible,\u201d Grainger said. \u201cI didn\u2019t really let myself think about this moment but I\u2019m so proud. It is important we celebrate because this team has just made history.\u201d\n\nRegardless of how things unfolded it was going to be a groundbreaking evening, with Wales playing before a record crowd of 12,741, more than double the previous record set against Estonia last October. For comparison, at the start of this campaign they attracted 1,745 in Llanelli. Before kick-off Natasha Harding, Helen Ward and Angharad James were presented with commemorative caps after reaching a century of appearances for their country. At 28 James is the youngest of the nine Welsh footballers, including Gareth Bale, to reach the landmark.\nGoodwill was not in short supply. Ian Rush and Neville Southall sent messages of support and Robert Page, the men\u2019s manager, and Joe Allen, the Wales midfielder, were among those in the stands. Wales initially struggled to stamp their authority and Slovenia had the first sighting of goal, with their captain, Mateja Zver, forcing Laura O\u2019Sullivan into a save after intercepting Rachel Rowe\u2019s crossfield pass. Zver looked to the skies on the half-hour after almost picking out the top corner with a shot from just outside the box following a neat one-two with Lara Prasnikar.\nWales\u2019s best openings stemmed from Ceri Holland and Carrie Jones. Holland seized on the ball as Kristina Erman swiped at thin air and surged forward, picking out Kayleigh Green, who nudged the ball infield to Sophie Ingle. The Wales captain spread play wide with a wonderful first-time pass and Jones forced a stop from the Slovenia\u2019s goalkeeper, Zala Mersnik. Holland later kick-started another move that culminated in Ingle side-footing wide from inside the box.\n\nJones had a penalty appeal waved away after Dominika Conc made a clumsy challenge inside the box and the exuberant Wales teenager carried a threat throughout, as did Zver. On 73 minutes the Slovenia captain sent a curling effort narrowly wide of a post. Earlier Mersnik kept out a swerving shot by Jones and from the resulting corner the unmarked Gemma Evans saw a header repelled by the Slovenia goalkeeper. Grainger crashed to the floor in disbelief but in the end Wales did not need the breathing space a winner would have yielded."

                    "body": "In many ways, football and migration have always been intertwined in Australia. From its introduction by British migrants in the late 19th century and the rise of postwar ethnic clubs, to the dismissiveness of the phrase \u201cwog-ball\u201d and the jubilation of the 2006 squad filled with first and second generation migrants, football and migrant communities have been inseparable bedfellows. It is a link that remains just as strong today, with the Socceroos squad announced for the 2022 World Cup featuring players from Bosnian, Croatian, Turkish-Cypriot and South African backgrounds. And in a trio of players with South Sudanese backgrounds \u2013 Awer Mabil, Garang Kuol and Thomas Deng \u2013 the Socceroos have a new generation of diaspora players to reflect both changing face of the squad and of the country.  Their inclusion by coach Graham Arnold reflects both their rise to prominence \u2013 Kuol, for example, recently secured a move to Premier League side Newcastle United \u2013 and the increased diversity of the playing pool at youth level. Considering the latest census results show almost half of Australians have a parent born overseas \u2013 and just under a third are born overseas themselves \u2013 it would be inaccurate to call the squad diverse. They are, and always have been, a mirror reflection of Australia. This group of players reflects the realities of the ethnic makeup of Australia better than competing sporting codes, politics and the media. It is a point driven home by Craig Foster, the former Socceroos captain and current human rights activist, who says it is far from surprising to see varying communities represented in the squad. \u2018Football in their heart\u2019 \u201cThe Australian male national team has reflected the changing face of the country for 100 years. And if you go through all of the different iterations and decades, and for World Cup squads, you see the face of Australia\u2019s immigration,\u201d he tells Guardian Australia. \u201cToday, we now see our new African-Australian diaspora start to be reflected through the team, and it\u2019s wonderful to see.\u201d Asked why Australian football is so deeply intertwined with migration, Foster takes a moment, reflecting on communities who came to Australia with \u201cfootball in their heart\u201d. \u201cOf all of the sports that Australia\u2019s immigrant communities most love, overwhelmingly, the majority of them come from football loving countries,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen the majority of immigrants come to Australia and settle into life, one of their great passions they want to bring to life is to be involved, or to form their own clubs, in association football. It\u2019s the world\u2019s biggest sport. \u201cAustralia, and Australian football, is better for its diversity.\u201d  It is a belief shared by many in the football landscape, particularly at youth levels, where coaches see the frontline of change. Craig Carley, a senior coach at Goulburn Valley Suns Football Club and a previous coach of Kuol, says he has witnessed the face of football changing, and he believes it will only lead to a better Socceroos squad. \u201cI can certainly see a shift \u2013 football is changing, it\u2019s becoming more diverse,\u201d Carley says. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s just brilliant for the sport. What we see locally is only going to benefit everyone, certainly the Socceroos as well. With the shift, it creates a wider pool of players, and these players are starting to be recognised for their talent. It\u2019s amazing and inspiring for other young players.\u201d Carley believes the process that has diversified the Socceroos \u2013 of players from migrant backgrounds climbing the ranks through the youth systems \u2013 would only lead to an improved squad. But he adds that there is a key prohibitive factor: the cost of youth football, particularly if a player reaches higher levels such as the National Premier League, Australia\u2019s second tier.   \u201cI think Australia would be ranked a lot higher in the world if they gave more diverse players opportunities,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s been a massive challenge, and I have no doubt whatsoever that it has impacted the national team selection. We should have a far more diverse team, and I think in years to come, the team will change. \u201cI think this issue has been completely detrimental to the senior team \u2013 there is just so much talent that\u2019s been missed because players can\u2019t go to training or games, can\u2019t get the right gear, and won\u2019t get the right opportunities.\u201d The frustration at costs as an impediment to development is a common one, particularly for coaches like Carley who see the potential directly. Paul Giordano, secretary of the Azzurri Sports Club and Adelaide Blue Eagles, where Deng started his playing career, says he has seen lots of talent go to waste.  \u201cPeople pay a lot of money to play this sport, which, especially for new immigrants to this country who want to play the sport, becomes prohibitive,\u201d Giordano says. \u201cThe problem isn\u2019t getting them to the top, it\u2019s getting them in at the bottom. \u201cOnce you\u2019re identified as a good player, people recognise that and they\u2019re willing to help. But it\u2019s that initial step. If you turn around and say, well, you can play junior squad, but the fees are $900 or $1,200, or $1,500, that initial step might just be too much. People can\u2019t afford that.\u201d \u2018I\u2019m so proud to see the face of the game changing\u2019 Despite these challenges, the game is still changing at a rapid pace, and Giordano has seen it happen up close. He has seen his club and many others around Australia have to change their names and \u201cde-ethnicise\u201d. He remembers when, in 1996, Soccer Australia ordered clubs to \u201cremove all symbols of European nationalism from club logos, playing strips, club flags, stadium names, and letterheads\u201d. David Hill, the Soccer Australia boss at the time, said it was to \u201cAustralianise\u201d the struggling National Soccer League, an idea that still stings today.  \u201cIt was like trying to erase our history, and I know our club amongst many were very upset by the situation, that you had to denounce the name of your club. That\u2019s how we became the Blue Eagles,\u201d Giordano says. \u201cLike with anything, we want our history acknowledged.\u201d The decision was made in an attempt to broaden the reach of football, to access \u201cmainstream\u201d Australians, bearing an underlying assumption that the migrant communities who built up football were not part of \u201cmainstream\u201d Australia. To Giordano, any success in Australian football is always owed to some degree to migrant communities, particularly the postwar wave of migrants from southern and eastern Europe who formed the bedrock of footballing infrastructure in Australia.  They\u2019re the Greek, Bosnian, Italian, Macedonian, Croatian and Serbian communities who blazed the trail for other diasporas, who then set the stage and cemented the connection between the Socceroos and migrant communities. But they have not been without their controversies, most recently at this year\u2019s Australia Cup final, when some fans of Sydney United 58 FC, an old NSL club, chanted songs with fascist links, booed during the Welcome To Country and performed Nazi salutes. It is an incident that reflects the ongoing tensions between \u201cold football\u201d and \u201cnew football\u201d, and the long journey ahead to mend a footballing culture still somewhat in two minds about what it wants to be and how to acknowledge its cultural roots. It makes the Socceroos the stitching between these eras, cultures and communities, the common ground that everyone unites around every four years. To Francis Awaritefe, former Socceroos player and chair of the players\u2019 union, Professional Footballers Australia, the game of football itself is a uniting force.  \u201cWhen you look at the game of football, especially in these very febrile times, with all the divisive rhetoric around, I think football is very well positioned as a sport to really bring people together and unite people,\u201d Awaritefe says. \u201cI\u2019m so proud to see the face of the game changing. It\u2019s part of the DNA of football to be egalitarian, diverse and inclusive.\u201d But Awaritefe warns that it is important to avoid complacency, and says football\u2019s diversity could become a \u201cweakness\u201d if \u201cwe don\u2019t look after it, and we don\u2019t nurture those values\u201d. \u201cRespect, and respect for human rights has to always be central. We\u2019ve seen how racism can grip other codes, how Indigenous or migrant players are treated in other sports. So it\u2019s really important that we don\u2019t allow ourselves to become complacent around the diversity of the game, so that we can continue to nurture it, because it is a massive strength. It\u2019s in the DNA of the sport.\u201d"

Their future in this tournament comes down to a cup final in miniature against Uruguay and perhaps fate had decided that at the moment Group H was drawn. If they win they will progress for the first time since 2010, when La Celeste denied them a place in the semi-finals with a helping hand that reverberates through World Cup lore.\n\nThat opportunity awaits because, against a largely excellent South Korea team, they were on top when the music stopped. This was a pulsating, thrilling game and Ghana were fortunate to win. Without Mohammed Kudus they would not have done so but the Ajax winger, who had been hotly tipped to enthral in Qatar, did not disappoint. The second of his two goals was coolly taken and rendered a whirlwind comeback from their opponents fruitless.\nIt meant they can now reckon with history although their manager, Otto Addo, played down any notion revenge would be a motivation when they face Su\u00e1rez and company. \u201cIt was a really, really long time ago when this incident happened,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a strong believer that if you don\u2019t seek too much revenge sometimes you get more blessings.\u201d\nIn truth he was already counting them. Addo was gracious enough to admit his team were \u201ca little bit lucky\u201d and nobody could argue. His goalkeeper, Lawrence Ati-Zigi, denied Cho Gue-sung a hat-trick in injury time and a largely dominant South Korea could point to several more near misses. Paulo Bento\u2019s side also felt frustrated when the referee, Anthony Taylor, blew for full-time as they prepared to take a corner. Taylor was perfectly within his rights but a furious Bento disagreed, running on to the pitch and receiving a red card for his protests.\n\nWhile Bento cooled off, his assistant S\u00e9rgio Costa articulated their sense of injustice. \u201cThe result is totally unfair, not even a draw would have been fair,\u201d he said. \u201cWe clearly deserved to win so I think we can feel very proud of what we\u2019ve done. You can count on us for the next match.\u201d That will be against Portugal and failure to win would guarantee their exit.\nOn the evidence of this performance a shock is not entirely far-fetched. South Korea had attacked Ghana in waves for 24 minutes, winning seven corners and benefitting from Son Heung-min\u2019s increased comfort wearing a mask, but fell behind out of the blue. A Jordan Ayew free-kick was defended scrappily and Mohammed Salisu, the Southampton defender, reacted to score from close range.\n\nIn hindsight the ensuing spell was decisive. Ghana turned the screw and were allowed to enjoy themselves until half-time. They doubled their lead when Kudus, timing his run cleverly, met another Jordan Ayew cross from open play and glanced past Kim Seung-gyu. Having struggled to match South Korea for pace and verve, the Black Stars were in control.\nBut this was several matches in one and, shortly after the hour, things had turned on their head. Cho had offered a warning with a header repelled by Ati-Zigi but went one better when converting a centre by the substitute Lee Kang-in, who had dispossessed Tariq Lamptey. Three minutes later he flung himself at a delivery from Kim Jin-su, contriving a finish of stunning hunger and power.\n\u201cWe really couldn\u2019t get the crosses under control,\u201d Addo said. At that point only one side seemed likely to win. When Kudus, sweeping a low first-time shot into the bottom corner after I\u00f1aki Williams had air-kicked Gideon Mensah\u2019s cutback, quickly restored the lead it was not the first time analysis had been confounded.\n\n\u201cOn and off the pitch he\u2019s an extraordinary guy, a great character,\u201d Addo said of Kudus. \u201cHe\u2019s fast and intelligent. He has to work more defensively but he\u2019s on the right track to be a great player.\u201d\nAti-Zigi saved a Lee free-kick and watched as Salisu cleared off the line from Kim Jin-su, but Ghana rode out another storm. \u201cWe gave our souls on the pitch,\u201d said Costa, and South Korea appeared desolate at the end. Son was among those seemingly in tears; feet were gazed at and faces covered upon walking off but it would be as well to remember another showing of this standard could bring greater reward.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a normal reaction from someone who did all they could to win,\u201d Costa said. It is Ghana, though, who can see the path to redemption they have craved."

                    "body": "When Australia play France there are always fireworks. The tempo was set in the very first Test in 1928 when French prop Jean Morere headbutted Jim Tancred and was left-hooked by NSW flanker Bluey Greatorex. After their next encounter in 1948, \u201cone hundred infuriated spectators rushed on the field, hit the referee and threw mud at him\u201d. In 1967, captain John Thornett told the referee his side would walk-off \u201cif you don\u2019t stop the Frenchmen kicking us\u201d. In 1997, No 8 Troy Coker was asked why he punched Fabian Pelous. \u201cWhat are you supposed to do when a guy has his fingers buried up to the second knuckle in your eye socket?\u201d With the last five Tests between these nations decided by three points or less (29-26 in 2014, 25-23 in 2016, and 23-21, 28-26, 33-30 in 2021) this 51st face-off between Les Bleus \u2013 the No 2 side in the world \u2013 and the Wallabies at Stade de France this weekend is already a powder keg.   Last Sunday, for once, Australia won a game they should have lost, when Scotland flyhalf Blair Kinghorn sliced a very-gettable penalty after the siren at Murrayfield. It backhanded Dave Rennie\u2019s men a gritty 16-15 victory, got their European tour off to a vital positive start, snapped a three-Test losing streak and lifted them from ninth-ranked team in the world to sixth (behind England, ahead of Wales). Best of all, it gifted the touring squad a much-needed confidence boost. Although the usual silly penalties, muddled attack and mental lapses were on show, there was plenty to like for Wallabies fans. Recalled Goliath Nick Frost put a stranglehold on his second-row spot with a best-on-field showing. Unloved at the start of 2022, the agile 23-year-old had signed with Robbie Deans\u2019 Panasonic Wild Knights but was talked back into gold by Brumbies coach Dan McKellar. Frost rewarded the faith at Murrayfield, dominating the lineout as he won 10 and stole two while also making 18 tackles and plenty of charges. This week Frost will pack down alongside another giant, 203cm 140kg Will Skelton, a star for French Top 14 side La Rochelle but, by his own admittance, an underperformer in his 21 Tests so far. Skelton, 30, joined the squad this week at their training base in Saint Etienne with a point to prove (he was part of three losing Wallabies teams on 2021\u2019s Spring tour). As one of Rennie\u2019s bench finishers, his muscle at the ruck and maul will help combat a massive French pack. It was timely that Taniel Tupou had his best game in a long time against the Scots. Tupou has had the dollar goggles on for much of the season and lost him the tight-head starting spot to Allan Alaalatoa. But with the Brumbies skipper scratched with concussion symptoms, Tupou is a lock to start against the French. Can he find the old crunch? With twin titans Frost, starting lock Cadeyrn Neville and Skelton behind him, skipper James Slipper alongside, and a dynamic rust-free backrow of Michael Hooper, Rob Valetini, Jed Holloway then Pete Samu to finish, it\u2019s now or never for the Tongan Thor.  The French are captained by Antoine Dupont, 25, a brilliant scrumhalf, powerful defender and World Rugby\u2019s 2021 player of the year. His talented side is fizzing with established club combinations, won the grand slam for the first time in a decade this year and on a 10-Test winning streak, a national record. France are the hottest team in northern hemisphere rugby and the favourites to win the 2023 World Cup on home soil. But they are beatable if Australia can shake a gorilla off their back by winning two-straight for the first time this year. If the Australian heavies match it with the French marauders up front, it\u2019ll be up to the backs to convert that into points. It will take two halves to match Dupont. The Tate McDermott-Nic White switcheroo worked well last week. McDermott\u2019s sniping carved through the Scottish defenders early, while White\u2019s bullet passes and cool scheming kept the Wallabies close enough to capitalise when the home side fluffed the killer blow. However Rennie has rested McDermott, who was concussed late in the Scotland Test, to start White and finish with Jake Gordon. Out wide, Lalakai Foketi and Len Ikitau are the new centre pairing and exciting young Red Jock Campbell will make his starting debut from fullback. Win or lose, Les Bleus offer a greater value to the Wallabies \u2013 a benchmark on where they must get to by next September. Sunday\u2019s Test follows a thrilling 2-1 Australian series in 2021 and lights the fuse on a future duel, both teams\u2019 last before the World Cup in Paris in August. This scheduling coup is the fruit of a deal hatched over lunch in Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s last November between RA chairman Hamish McLennan, two-time World Cup winner Phil Kearns and French rugby boss/World Rugby vice-chair Bernard Laporte. It gives the Wallabies a fantastic runway to success at the tournament that matters most. There may have been blood spilt between these nations in the past, but the French connection with Australian rugby is proof that it\u2019s a currency thicker than water. Australia: Jock Campbell, Andrew Kellaway, Len Ikitau, Lalakai Foketi, Tom Wright, Bernard Foley, Nic White, Rob Valetini, Michael Hooper, Jed Holloway, Cadeyrn Neville, Nick Frost, Taniela Tupou, David Porecki, James Slipper (captain). Reserves: Folau Fainga\u2019a, Matt Gibbon, Tom Robertson, Will Skelton, Pete Samu, Jake Gordon, Hunter Paisami, Reece Hodge."

They killed Khashoggi and have a horrible record on human rights. They execute people over there for being gay. Knowing all of this, why would I even consider it? Because this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reshape how the PGA Tour operates.\u201d\nRunner-up\nEddie Howe, March, asked about the 81 people killed in one day by Newcastle\u2019s new owners. \u201cI\u2019m just going to answer questions about football. I\u2019m still bitterly disappointed about the defeat.\u201d\nPolitics awards: MP of the year\nNadine Dorries \u2013 ex-secretary of state for sport and essence of 2022. Dorries promised voters tennis pitches in April, forgot Glasgow 2014 had happened in July and reminisced about the wrong sport at a Rugby League World Cup launch in June: \u201cMy long-standing memory is that 2003 drop goal. Wow, what a moment that was.\u201d She resigned in September, eyeing a peerage.\n\nAlso cutting through in 2022: a) Brendan Clarke-Smith, Tory MP for Bassetlaw, telling England players on the eve of the first tournament since they faced racist death threats to \u201ccut out the kneeling nonsense and the rest of the selective virtue signalling\u201d. And b) Rishi Sunak, tweeting 13 days after Qatari officials confiscated rainbow bucket hats off Wales fans\u2019 heads: \u201cHats off to Qatar for hosting an incredible World Cup so far.\u201d\n\nPolitics fan of the year\nDerek Chisora, wearing a Boris Johnson mask in July at a weigh-in to support the fallen PM. \u201cI was a big fan of Boris. I\u2019m a big Brexit fan. I love the Brexit. I was one of the members of Brexit. I\u2019m all about things that bring pressure to life.\u201d In July Chisora was asked by the Times for his dream dinner party guests and chose Jesus, Hitler, and \u201cJulius Caesar, the Roman empire guy\u201d.\n\nLegal awards: court case of the year\nAmong the early highlights from the high court in May, reported live by the Guardian\u2019s @jimwaterson.\n\n\u201cRooney\u2019s lawyer claims WhatsApp messages that would show the leaking of stories to the Sun are on a phone dropped off the side of a boat. He says it is now \u2018lying at the bottom of sea in Davy Jones\u2019 locker\u2019.

Journalists who revealed the story about skater Kamila Valieva received death threats while Vladimir Putin hit out at the smears. \u201cThrough her work Kamila has raised sport to the level of true art.\u201d\nApology of the year\nF1\u2019s Bernie Ecclestone, feeling put out in June by the backlash after telling Good Morning Britain: \u201cI\u2019d take a bullet for Putin, because he\u2019s a first-class person.\u201d Nine days later: \u201cI\u2019m sorry if anything I said has upset anybody.\u201d\nBreakthrough sport of the year\nFinally cutting through to the news pages in 2022: \u201cChess grandmaster accused of anal bead tactic \u2018cheated over 100 times\u2019\u201d (Metro, October); \u201cCheat row erupts at World Conker Championships \u2013 but it\u2019s not like anal-bead chess plot\u201d (Daily Star). Plus, not bead-related: \u201cChess robot grabs and breaks finger of seven-year-old opponent\u201d (Guardian, July).\nRethink of the year\nCame in August after Southend signed a stand-naming deal with estate agents Gilbert &amp; Rose, making it \u201cthe Gilbert &amp; Rose West Stand\u201d. Chairman Ron Martin: \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate and really disappointing \u2026 I suspect that the people in our commercial department were not born at the time of that tragedy so I guess that\u2019s why that\u2019s happened. We\u2019re changing it to \u2018the West Stand sponsored by Gilbert And Rose\u2019.\u201d\nSecond biggest tractor scandal of the year\nTwo months after MP Neil Parish resigned in April\u2019s surprise parliamentary tractor porn scandal, three teens joy-rode a tractor in circles on Plymouth\u2019s Home Park pitch. Police arrested \u201cthree boys under of the age of 16\u201d; Plymouth: \u201cAny true fan would not engage in such mindless destruction.\u201d\nProduct launch of the year\nWas John Terry\u2019s \u201cApe Kids\u201d non-fungible token business. Terry pushed the opportunity in January for fans to buy cartoons of footballers looking like apes by tweeting a cartoon of Brazil winger Willian as an ape. Twitter racism watchdog @racismdog took a view; the NFT fell 99% in value by June.\nDiplomat of the year\nNew Zealand doubles player Michael Venus, asked about opponent Nick Kyrgios\u2019s Australian Open display in January. \u201cThere will always be his supporters and he\u2019ll always spin it in a way that helps him. But at the end of the day, he\u2019s just an absolute knob.\u201d\nMost unexpected injuries\nHurting most in 2022: a) Finnish cross-country skier Remi Lindholm suffered a frozen penis in 50km race in February: \u201cIt was one of the worst competitions I\u2019ve been in.\u201d And b) Eritrea\u2019s Biniam Girmay celebrated his first stage win at the Giro d\u2019Italia in May by firing a champagne cork into his eye causing a hemorrhage, putting him out of the rest of the tour. Girmay called it \u201ca bad moment\u201d but \u201cstill, I\u2019m happy. See you soon.\u201d\nPlus: most lacking in empathy\nThese commentators, for a full two minutes.\n\nSetback of the year\nCame for marathon runner Eric Kiptanui, forced to sit out the Commonwealth Games men\u2019s race after Kenyan officials entered the wrong Eric for the event. Eric Kiplagat Sang, a non-marathon runner, wasn\u2019t in Birmingham at the time. Kiptanui: \u201cThis is painful, it\u2019s simply bad. People must take their work seriously.\u201d\nAlso cutting corners in 2022:\n\nAutumn Nations Series organisers mistakenly using an outline of the US state of Georgia to represent the European country on official merchandise. \u201cThe design error was quickly identified.\u201d\nGreat Scottish Run organisers apologising after Eilish McColgan\u2019s 10,000m British record was invalidated when the course was found to be 150m short \u2013 a repeat of an error made in 2016 which annulled a record set by Callum Hawkins. McColgan: \u201cHuman errors happen. I\u2019ve no bad words to say.\u201d\n\nBest improvisation\nChesham Utd\u2019s PA man \u2013 doing his best as the club improvised to pay tribute to Her Majesty in September.\n\nFootball manager awards\nEnding the hire-and-fire culture at their clubs in 2022:\n\nWatford CEO Scott Duxbury in June, drawing a line under their past record to focus on stability: \u201cIn Rob Edwards we\u2019ve appointed a manager we all totally believe in, a manager who can lead and drive that culture change. We will support him \u2013 come hell or high water.\u201d 26 Sep: Sacks him.\nGenoa president Alberto Zangrillo, pledging no more of the whim-based sackings which had been a trademark of his predecessor Enrico Preziosi. 24 Dec 2021: \u201cWhen we hired Andriy Shevchenko we didn\u2019t do it because he was someone\u2019s pal or for some other daft reason, we did it with deep thought. He\u2019s a Ballon d\u2019Or winner, he\u2019s rigorous, he\u2019s serious, he\u2019s made a big life decision to leave a stimulating city to come to us. The people love Andriy. We back Andriy.

                    "body": "It was the 91st minute at San Siro when Milan scored the goal that might have rescued the Serie A title race. Technically the Fiorentina defender Nicola Milenkovic scored it for them \u2013 deflecting Aster Vranckx\u2019s cross into his own net \u2013 but few were dwelling on the fine details as Zombie Nation\u2019s Kernkraft 400, a German dance track older than some players on the pitch, blared out across the public address.\n\nA crowd of 73,000 danced and sighed with relief. Milenkovic\u2019s own goal secured a 2-1 win and kept Milan \u2018only\u2019 eight points behind Napoli at the top. The league leaders hold a double-digit advantage over every other side in the division heading into the World Cup break.\nNapoli deserve every bit of their advantage, having played the best football in Italy this season by a distance. On Saturday they collected their 11th consecutive league win, beating Udinese 3-2 in a game less close than that scoreline implies. They were three goals up after an hour against opponents who had previously beaten Roma 4-0 and Inter 3-1.\nIt was yet another occasion to marvel at the outlandish talent of Victor Osimhen. He scored the first goal with a piece of classic centre-forward play, attacking the space behind his marker and glancing a header home from Eljif Elmas\u2019s cross. The timing of his run and leap were everything. Osimhen appeared a foot taller than Jaka Bijol; in truth, he stands a couple of inches shorter.\nNapoli\u2019s second goal was a scintillating team move, Piotr Zielinski playing the ball out from the left corner of his own penalty box and finding Osimhen in the middle of the park. The forward turned and took two Udinese players with him as he drove toward the right wing before wrongfooting them with a no-look backheel to Hirving Lozano.\nHe, in turn, angled inwards before switching play back to Zielinski, who had run the length of the pitch. The Polish midfielder took one touch to wrongfoot the player tracking him and another to settle the ball before sweeping a shot into the bottom right corner of the net.\nThat was the 31st minute, and Elmas added a third goal for Napoli in the 58th, converting Andr\u00e9-Frank Zambo Anguissa\u2019s through-pass after beating Bijol one-on-one. Still, Napoli came forward, and only some sharp saves by the Udinese goalkeeper Marco Silvestri kept the margin at three.\n\nUdinese\u2019s counter-punch did not arrive until the 79th minute, though it was another goal to marvel at. Roberto Pereyra chipped the ball in from the left, Isaac Success weighted a pass just right with his chest and Ilija Nestorovski drilled a first-time half-volley into the bottom of the net.\nThree minutes later, Udinese scored again. Kim Min-Jae blundered to get caught in possession by Lazar Samardzic, who punished the mistake fully with a ruthless finish. A quick-fire double might have induced panic in a less confident side. Napoli calmly steadied the ship and sailed home. Udinese managed one further shot in the game, and that from outside the box.\n\nVictory meant Napoli finished this season\u2019s first chapter on 41 points. They have won 13 out of 15 matches \u2013 something that no other club besides Juventus had ever done in the history of Serie A. The Bianconeri have, admittedly, done it four times. Unsurprisingly, they finished top on each occasion. (One of those, it should be said, was the 2005-06 season for which they would later have their title stripped.)\nJournalists continued to ask at full-time whether Napoli were ready to start talking about themselves as potential Scudetto winners for the first time since 1990. Frankly, at this point, it would be ludicrous to pretend otherwise. Nobody knows how a World Cup interruption will impact this season but at this moment Napoli are clear favourites for the plain and obvious reason that they have been much better than anyone else.\n\u201cIt makes no difference to me if you talk about the Scudetto or not,\u201d said Luciano Spalletti on Saturday. \u201cI know that there are 69 points left to play for this season and that is an ocean. The only thing for us to do is to keep our gaze clear in the fog that other people want to create.\u201d\n\nHe thanked his squad for \u201cplaying like Martians\u201d but the manager deserves just as much credit for keeping them on track even when key performers have been absent. Saturday\u2019s game was the third in a row for Napoli without Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, the breakout star of this Serie A season, yet his replacement Elmas rivalled Osimhen for man of the match, overlapping fluidly with another squad player, Math\u00edas Olivera, who was filling in for M\u00e1rio Rui at left-back.\nContrary to interrupting his team\u2019s rhythm, Spalletti said he was looking forward to the World Cup giving his players a chance to rest and get together for a midseason training camp. Only five are heading to Qatar. Osimhen\u2019s Nigeria and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia\u2019s Georgia both failed to qualify, while others, such as M\u00e1rio Rui for Portugal, were simply overlooked.\nSpalletti\u2019s perspective is not shared by everyone. The Lazio manager, Maurizio Sarri, told reporters last week that he would likely not even watch a World Cup that he described as an \u201cinsult to football\u201d, adulterating an entire season in his mind.\nHis team entered into the break on a less positive note, beaten 3-0 by Juventus. Lazio were the one other team who could have stayed within eight points of Napoli, but instead were leapfrogged by their opponents. Who would have dared to predict that Juventus would reach the World Cup in third place, after they opened the campaign with two wins in their first seven games?\n\nSix consecutive clean sheets have allowed a rapid ascent, and performances are starting to catch up to results. The gradual return of Federico Chiesa, who set up the third goal off the bench against Lazio, offers further optimism for them of a stronger second part to the campaign.\nThey are not the only ones who have picked up momentum in recent weeks. Inter finished their year with an impressive 3-2 win away to Atalanta, giving them six wins from their last seven. The problem for all of them, as Juventus\u2019s Massimiliano Allegri pointed out, is that Napoli are setting an impossible pace, on track to hit 52 points by the season\u2019s midway stage.\nIt was left to the Milan director Paolo Maldini to strike a defiant note. \u201cOf course we believe we can catch Napoli,\u201d he said after his team\u2019s last-gasp win over Fiorentina. \u201cWhen we played the derby last year we were seven points behind Inter and then we managed to win. We know very well that it\u2019s not easy to keep up this rhythm all the way to the end.\u201d\nThe familiar sound of a two-decades-old dance track at San Siro on Sunday evening was a reminder of the enthusiasm that swept Milan to their first title in 11 years last season, and a warning that they have not given up on defending it just yet.\n"

                    "body": "There has been a lot of discussion about how England can try to nullify the threat of Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 in their World Cup quarter-final on Saturday but the important thing for them to think about is how to impose themselves on France.\nEngland had inner-confidence and focus in their win over Senegal. They have scored 12 goals in their four matches in Qatar, a sign of their attacking prowess and clinical nature. France have shown vulnerability at the back and are missing their first-choice full-backs. Jules Kound\u00e9 is a central defender but has been moved out to the right due to the paucity of options and the left-back Lucas Hernandez has been ruled out after sustaining a cruciate ligament injury in their opening match. Hugo Lloris and Rapha\u00ebl Varane are highly experienced but have shown fragility at times.\n\nIn the last-16 game, England looked fluid in their forward play thanks to a starting front three of Bukayo Saka, Harry Kane and Phil Foden. They all played their part in attacking at pace to open up Senegal and it would be hard to change a winning side, especially because they possess the right attributes to expose France\u2019s full-backs. I do not think Gareth Southgate will make changes except perhaps replacing Foden with Marcus Rashford to do what Mpabb\u00e9 will aim to do to Kyle Walker and keep them pushed back. After Foden\u2019s recent performances it would be hard to not play him, but it could be a case of what does this knockout game need?\nThe important thing is to not make it a counterattacking match. England need to have an element of control, but it will be very end-to-end. It is imperative to recognise France\u2019s strengths but not be overawed by them. In my career, when we played against world-class players and teams, it was embedded in our minds that we should fear them but this group does not have that. They understand the threats but also their own strengths as individual players and as a team.\n\nSteve Holland, Southgate\u2019s assistant, has said that teams do play a bit of \u201ccat and mouse\u201d when trying to keep Mbapp\u00e9 quiet. If England focus too much on the forward and change their style to stop him, it could also take something away from their own attacking play. It is a difficult balancing act they need to get right.\nDefensively, it will be important that the central midfielders support the full-backs quickly. A midfielder may drop back and make a five-man defence to ensure that the full-backs are never left isolated one-v-one when France attack. It may be that Declan Rice or Jordan Henderson are required to back up Walker and Luke Shaw to protect the sides.\nIt will be a combative midfield and Southgate won\u2019t change the personnel to protect the middle areas. Harry Maguire can deal with Olivier Giroud in the air because that is his strength. England have conceded twice in the tournament, showing the defence is well organised.\n\nA team can still keep its shape but adjust throughout the game. If Southgate goes to a five-man defence by starting an extra centre-back, he would lose a midfielder. England have to believe in themselves more. When France have the ball, Rice, for example, can drop into a back five and when England are in possession they can revert to a midfield three, helping them push higher up and bring the necessary control. Football is fluid, formations can change in game and individuals are not shackled to one position all game; they can adapt depending on the situation.\nPlayers are trained differently now to know the various roles they have within one match. What is great about Southgate is that he puts it on them being able to make changes within a match. If it is not working, he can drop a player into a back five and sit Henderson and Jude Bellingham deeper to get to half-time, for example, before changing it.\nEngland\u2019s strength is their bench. If the game is goalless after 70 minutes I would be more confident in their options to change things. A manager always wants to be able to turn to his substitutes to see what is required at the point and if he has anyone to provide it. Jack Grealish, Rashford, Callum Wilson and Raheem Sterling, should he be involved, provide England with players for almost every occasion in reserve. The great thing is they are mainly attacking options and the hardest thing to do is score goals. In knockout football, when a magic moment is required, the England bench is very well equipped.\n\nAt this point in a tournament, experience is vital. Having players that have been through this before is imperative. They know what is needed in the knockout stages and how to execute a plan. Many of this England team have made it to a World Cup semi-final and gone one better in the Euros. It is one of the reasons Southgate decided to pick the most experienced set of players available to him. They will not be overawed by the occasion on Saturday.\nI am really excited about this game, not nervous. My Englishness normally makes me doubt the team but I was more apprehensive going into the Senegal match because it had everything for an upset; they were missing their best players and mainly because England were favourites.\nThere is an inner calm for me about facing France; England know what they are doing \u2013 I saw it against Senegal. If it does not go well it is because they have been beaten by a better team. I feel calm but I hope it does not come back to bite me."

                    "body": "Victoria\u2019s events and sports minister Martin Pakula said he was \u201cpretty pissed off\u201d by Argentina\u2019s decision to back down from its contractual agreement to play fierce rivals Brazil in Melbourne next month. The South American heavyweights were due to meet in front of a bumper crowd at the MCG on 11 June. Pakula said about 60,000 tickets had already been snapped up since going on sale last month. The match had originally been slated as part of the teams\u2019 preparations for this year\u2019s World Cup in Qatar but organisers and the Brazilian FA announced on Wednesday that the match would not go ahead due to Argentina\u2019s reluctance to travel.  \u201cRegrettably, event organisers have been informed by Pitch, the Superclasico 11 June 2022 match agent, that contrary to their prior agreement and commitment to do so, Argentina are no longer prepared to travel to Australia for the match against Brazil,\u201d organisers said. The Brazilian federation CBF confirmed the news of the cancellation, saying the decision had been down to the Argentine federation. The Argentine FA has made no comment on the issue, leaving the Victorian government searching for answers. \u201cI think they owe Australian football fans an explanation because they haven\u2019t provided an acceptable explanation to the promoter,\u201d Pakula said. \u201cI know Brazil is very upset. It\u2019s really impacting their preparation for the World Cup. \u201cIt\u2019s a game that would have been extremely popular here in Melbourne. I welcome the comments by the promoter overnight that all the fans will receive a full refund.\u201d The last time the South American giants played a Superclasico at the MCG five years ago, more than 95,000 fans turned out to watch the likes of Lionel Messi. The cancellation follows a ruling by Fifa on Monday that the two teams would still have to play their qualifying tie which was suspended in September shortly after kickoff and never completed because officials complained of Argentina players violating Covid-19 protocols. Fifa wants the game played this September, a couple of months before the World Cup finals start in Qatar, but both teams, who qualified automatically at the top of their South American group, have not committed to playing it. Juninho Paulista, co-ordinator of the Brazilian team, said at the news conference: \u201cA statement came from the AFA [the Argentine federation], officially, and they informed us of this decision. \u201cWe were prepared and with all the logistics ready for this game because we understood that we had to fulfil the contract,\u201d he added. Organisers now says they are \u201cworking with the key stakeholders connected with the match to review all options for the fixture and will provide further updates as quickly as possible.\u201d Ticket holders would be eligible for refunds with details of the process to be provided shortly, the organisers added.  Australian Associated Press contributed to this report. "

                    "body": "Moments after the Black Ferns secured their place in the Rugby World Cup final, super-fan and rugby commentator, Alice Soper posted a video of her tear-streaked face to social media. Soper was overcome \u2013 not just because the nail-biting final minute could have gone either way for the New Zealand women\u2019s team, but because the Black Ferns\u2019 win represented something much greater. \u201cI was crying about women\u2019s rugby winning, because I knew we needed to have the Black Ferns in the final for [the tournament] to be a spectacle, and to have the opportunity to the put the biggest show on in town,\u201d Soper says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the team, it\u2019s about a whole bunch of us out here who have been grafting away for the longest time, doing it in the shadows \u2026 to have that moment we can all be proud of and say: look how good we are.\u201d One million New Zealanders tuned in to watch the Black Ferns\u2019 25-24 semi-final victory against France last weekend \u2013 five times the number who tuned into the 2017 final between the Black Ferns and England. By the next morning, the country\u2019s largest stadium \u2013 Auckland\u2019s Eden Park \u2013 was well on its way to selling out its 40,000 tickets to the final against England\u2019s Red Roses. By Wednesday, it had \u2013 putting the match on track to break the world record for the largest crowd to attend a women\u2019s rugby match.  Based on these numbers, it would be easy to assume that women\u2019s rugby in New Zealand is a well-supported, well-viewed sport. But despite rugby being the national sport \u2013 and the country\u2019s women\u2019s teams dominating the international playing field (the Black Ferns have won five of the past six World Cups) \u2013 women\u2019s efforts have been under-recognised, under-funded and under-supported. New Zealand Rugby transitioned the professional women\u2019s players to a full-time employment model this year, but according to news outlet Stuff there is still a 73% pay gap between the women\u2019s team and the All Blacks. Meanwhile, the team will not receive bonuses if they win the World Cup, despite each All Blacks player being awarded NZ$134,000 for their 2015 Cup victory \u2013 a bonus that exceeds some of the women\u2019s salaries. The recent, unprecedented, interest from the public should serve as a wake-up call to \u201call the old boys in the boardroom\u201d of New Zealand\u2019s rugby institutions, Soper says. \u201cMen\u2019s sports are funded based on potential, women\u2019s sports are funded based on results. Well that is a result, to sell out Eden Park.\u201d  Black Ferns player and the captain of the sevens team, Sarah Hirini, says building on the team\u2019s extraordinary momentum and maintaining that public attention would mean \u201ceverything\u201d to the players. \u201cThis is what we have been wanting for a very long time, and now, I think, people are just turning up to the party, which is awesome,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just for us \u2013 it is for the next generation of players, it\u2019s for other women\u2019s sports who are still wanting this.\u201d \u2018Bringing the joy back\u2019 The team is attracting a new fanbase: some who have never engaged with the sport before and others who are rugby diehards excited to see the game being played \u201cold-school\u201d \u2013 fast, brutal and with a sense of joy. For burgeoning fan, Erin Harrington, the semi-final was the first time she had watched a rugby game out of choice. Since school, the \u014ctautahi/Christchurch-based academic and arts critic had found the culture surrounding men\u2019s rugby, and much of men\u2019s sport in general, to be \u201creally alienating\u201d.  \u201cI know it\u2019s not representative of all players and fans, but my experience has been one of toxicity and sexism, often fuelled by alcohol, made worse by the widespread notion that women\u2019s sport in general is inherently inferior.\u201d It came as \u201ca complete revelation to see these incredible women, of all shapes and sizes, being physical and powerful on their own terms, and with such a sense of joy\u201d, Harrington says.A professor specialising in the sociology of sport at the University of Auckland, Toni Bruce has been researching this growing fandom as part of a broader attempt to understand the relationship between nationalism and rugby in New Zealand.  For years Bruce has been conducting surveys about the public\u2019s attitude to the men\u2019s Rugby World Cup, but this is the first year she is running a survey about the women\u2019s tournament. Just under 200 people have completed the survey so far, and already strong themes and differences in attitudes towards the women\u2019s games are evident. \u201cEveryone is talking about the style the Black Ferns play and the spirit in which they play,\u201d Bruce says. \u201cPeople are picking out that their style is an open, running rugby, it is attacking rugby, they play to the ball not the referee, it is fun and it is exciting.\u201d Overwhelmingly, the descriptions of the women\u2019s game play were positive compared to how the public viewed the men\u2019s style which included \u201ctoo many scrums, playing to the referee not the ball, and a lot of stoppages\u201d. \u201cThere are a lot of people who have followed men\u2019s rugby for a long time and they have been feeling disillusioned by it. Women\u2019s rugby is somehow bringing the joy of the game back to the forefront,\u201d she says. The spirit with which the women\u2019s team approached the game was also different, according to those surveyed, Bruce says.  \u201cPeople have talked about [the team\u2019s] passion, that they\u2019re authentic and they are open and real with the media \u2013 there\u2019s no corporate speak, they are willing to be vulnerable.\u201d  There is a special alchemy of factors sparking the explosion in interest, but Bruce believes some recent developments are spurring it more than others \u2013 proper television coverage and the women\u2019s rugby sevens team getting into the Olympics (and winning gold). In turn, this has given charismatic players such as Ruby Tui a chance to foster fandom and connection between the team and the public. \u2018Chance for a reset\u2019 Women have long been rugby supporters and players, says Jennifer Curtin, a professor of politics and public policy at the University of Auckland who has researched women\u2019s engagement with the sport. There are photographs of women playing in the 1890s, Curtin says, and as well as cheering from the sidelines, their support has included countless hours of invisible labour: fundraisers, advocacy, and domestic and emotional support for players. \u201cMy hope with this World Cup is that we don\u2019t forget \u2013 that there isn\u2019t a collective \u2013 or New Zealand Rugby \u2013 amnesia about this moment, or this level of turn out and passion for the women\u2019s game.\u201d Curtin hopes this Rugby World Cup will help the team secure the respect and investment they deserve, while Soper adds that as well as being the right thing to do, it would offer New Zealand Rugby the chance for a \u201crelational reset\u201d. \u201cWomen\u2019s rugby doesn\u2019t come with all the baggage attached to men\u2019s \u2013 there is a toxic masculinity attached to that culture \u2013 but that\u2019s not the space at a women\u2019s game.\u201d Fostering that visibility and breaking stereotypes within physical sport matters, she says. \u201cI\u2019ve got nothing in common with Richie McCaw [the former All Blacks captain], so I\u2019m never going to feel emotionally connected to him. \u201cThere are a lot of people out there saying: \u2018I don\u2019t like rugby, but I do like women\u2019s rugby, and I like how they are playing \u2013 it\u2019s good, it\u2019s honest, and that reminds me of what rugby used to be.\u2019\u201d"

                    "body": "Football is a whole world in itself, a democratic sport that brings some feelings that are impossible to describe to people who do not follow it. Within football there are also things that are passed down from generation to generation, just like in a country in the real world.\nEach great football country has its own characteristic, its own way of seeing football and that, in turn, forms how football is being played in that country, how a national team relate to their supporters, how the media analyses the games and much, much more. But one thing is for sure: it does not matter how long football has been around, no one in any country will ever understand football 100%. There is always something new to teach us, in every single country, no matter how good or poor or passionate.\n\nDespite the many differences between these countries there are also many similarities. All of the great nations play to win the World Cup and all want nothing more than to lift the trophy in front of their fans. The funny thing with football is that there can only be one winner \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean that the losing finalists or a team that have gone out in the semi-finals have done something wrong. They may have done everything in their powers but just not had the necessary quality.\nFor a football team to be successful, just in a developed society, you need its people \u2013 ie, players \u2013 to work together to achieve something special. In real life you need people to collaborate to evolve. That goes for every country. But in Brazil we have something different that I cannot see in other countries.\nThere is an enormous amount of passion around football in Brazil and the way everyone in the country analyses the national team is radical, at times simplistic and often overwhelming when it comes to criticising the players and the coach, making it seem as if football is very easy for those who play, especially if they are professional players. In Brazil it seems to be difficult to accept that football, as well as life, evolves.\nAnd so Brazil are under enormous pressure before their last-16 game against South Korea after losing their third group game against Cameroon. They also lost two more players to injury, Alex Telles and Gabriel Jesus, but Neymar should be fit again. The fact that they are playing South Korea, who everyone thinks they should beat, only adds to the expectation, the pressure and the sense that Brazil have to go through. It would have been different if they were facing Portugal or Uruguay from that group.\nIn Brazil, in fact, victory against South Korea is seen as an obligation and that is a great weight for the coach, Tite, and his staff to be carrying and in their discussions with the players. This team would not be forgiven if they were eliminated in the last 16 by South Korea. It may seem to the people in front of the TV that this is the kind of pressure Tite and the players should be able to cope with but it is, in fact, the biggest problem they are facing.\n\nThat does not mean that the players are afraid. Of course not. On the contrary they will be looking forward to it. To reach the level they are at they have had to work extremely hard and overcome many, many challenges. They are professional players but \u2013 and here is the thing \u2013 unconsciously they will be aware that they cannot afford to make a mistake. That can be enough to stop you from making the right decision in the game, to make you avoid doing a one-touch pass because of the fear of making a mistake. Somewhere the brain tells you: \u201cYou cannot make a mistake!\u201d whether you want it to or not.\nWith confidence and with all their key players fit, I would say that Brazil are the best team in the world, but the weight of that national team jersey is often very, very costly for the players, their personal life and even for their families.\n\nIn Brazil an 18-year-old can make his professional debut for his club and be booed by the entire crowd 15 minutes into the first half, just for making a wrong pass or something else that is detrimental for the team and even be taken off because of the supporters\u2019 anger. This will hopefully make that 18-year-old stronger, but it comes at a price too. Some players cannot cope.\nWe learn in Brazil that second place is the same as finishing last and that is not fair. That is a tough environment for a player (and that includes the Brazil Olympic team) and puts a very high bar around the analysis of the national team. It makes it very, very demanding.\n\nOn the other hand we are obsessed by winning. As a consequence we would never see what happened with Belgium, for example, who did not believe they could win the tournament. That is incomprehensible for a Brazilian. We enjoy every second of the World Cup and we want it to pass very slowly. We would never do what Belgium did and I am proud to say that. We would play to win, even if our mothers were on the other side.\nBrazil have reached the last 16 of a World Cup and as a former player I know how important it is to respect the opponent, especially one as good as South Korea, who have an exceptional player in Son Heung-min. That respect is fundamental to go further.\nI hope Tite is able to pick the 11 best players currently at his disposal and that he is clear and precise in his analysis and instructions to the players to ensure that they take another step towards a possible sixth World Cup."

This is not a formula England have typically leaned on at World Cups \u2013 and certainly not when the gruff Italian Fabio Capello and the equally gruff Englishman Roy Hodgson were in charge.\n\nBut since taking over in 2016, Gareth Southgate has not only established a very different culture \u2013 he has done so by radically sidestepping out of football\u2019s comfort zone, too. Performance coaches from New Zealand, England rugby experts, and the best of Team GB\u2019s Olympic talent have all informed his thinking.\nIt speaks volumes that Southgate was the first football manager to go on UK Sport\u2019s three-year elite coaching programme, where he exchanged ideas and philosophies with top coaches from multiple Olympic sports. Notably, when he graduated in 2019, he called the course \u201cnot only a privilege but a great opportunity\u201d and stressed that the challenges facing top coaches were the same, whatever the sport.\nThe good impressions went both ways. \u201cHe was a bit of a sponge, always wanting to learn from people and getting fresh perspectives,\u201d says a source in the Olympic sporting ecosystem. \u201cThat is rare among football people. There is often a sense in football that: \u2018We know best, we know everything, and we have worked out how to create a winning culture.\u2019\u201d\nSouthgate bucked that trend early by employing Dave Reddin, a core member of Sir Clive Woodward\u2019s team that won the 2003 Rugby World Cup and the head of performance for Team GB at the 2012 Olympic Games.\n\nAnother key member of Southgate\u2019s setup has been the New Zealander performance coach Owen Eastwood, who has also worked with South Africa\u2019s cricketers, his homeland\u2019s rugby team and Team GB. Eastwood emphasises the concept of Whakapapa \u2013 the M\u0101ori way of explaining your place in any tribe or family. Applied to sport, it places the emphasis on creating pride in the shirt and leaving a legacy for others to follow.\nSince 2019, whenever an England player earns their first cap they get a \u201clegacy number\u201d stitched into the crest \u2013 which gives them a numerical place in the history of the shirt. Robert Barker, England\u2019s goalkeeper in football\u2019s first international in 1872, is No 1; the team\u2019s first black footballer, Viv Anderson, is No 936. The achievements of those who blazed a trail, such as Anderson, are emphasised to Southgate\u2019s diverse squad.\nEastwood also stresses that trust and openness matter. \u201cPeople thrive when there\u2019s consistency and composure around the environment,\u201d he says. \u201cOne of the things about Gareth\u2019s leadership is he genuinely sees it as a players\u2019 game. He is there to facilitate them achieving what their potential might be. It\u2019s not about him. He\u2019s not the hero of it \u2013 the players are the heroes of it.\u201d\nIt is a philosophy similar to that of Danny Kerry, who guided the GB women\u2019s hockey team to gold at the Rio 2016 Olympics and has also spoken to Southgate. One of the team\u2019s stars, Georgie Twigg, says that there are clear parallels with what the hockey team did and what she sees with England\u2019s players in Doha.\n\u201cWe worked very closely with psychologists on what we, as a team, wanted our culture to look like: how we wanted to behave and hold each other to account,\u201d she says. \u201cWe had to because we were a group of 30 girls training day in, day out, with massively different personalities and ages.\u201d\nCan something as small as turning your socks the right way make a difference? Twigg thinks so. \u201cSome of us would never have been best friends outside the sporting world,\u201d she adds. \u201cBut creating a culture where you are all working towards one collective goal, and you do these small behaviours that generate respect between each other, is really powerful. And it can lead to huge knock-on effects on the field.\u201d\n\nSouthgate did not come to these ideas cold. As early as 2014 he was behind the launch of \u201cthe England DNA\u201d, a plan to establish a way of playing and create a history and heritage for the national team from junior to senior levels. His time as manager of England Under-21s also helped put his ideas of developing young players into practice.\nNearly a decade on he presides over an England setup that his players genuinely appear to enjoy. It is certainly a far cry from the \u201cgolden generation\u201d of the early noughties, during which players from rival clubs such as David Beckham, Wayne Rooney, Steven Gerrard and John Terry often treated their England colleagues with suspicion, and underperformed as a result.\nOf course winning matches has helped Southgate. But much of this change is down to leadership. It is noticeable that he doesn\u2019t ask his players to do anything he wouldn\u2019t do himself, and that he has never shied away from taking responsibility \u2013 whether over taking the knee, going to Qatar, or anything else.\nYou can smell the team spirit at England\u2019s Al Wakrah training base. Now, as Saturday\u2019s quarter-final against France looms, a nation hopes they can once again entertain us."

                    "body": "Brazil had a decent start to their 2022 World Cup. The first game of the tournament is always a little bit more difficult. An early wrong turn, a miscontrolled ball or a badly placed pass can dictate the story of the game. A team that wants to go on to win the tournament need to realise that and manage the raw emotions and the overall energy of those first minutes. Brazil did that in their 2-0 win against Serbia. But let\u2019s be careful. The three points does not guarantee anything, not even progress to the knockout stage. The players need to know that humility and respect is key here and you can never have too much of that.\nNow comes a game against another European competitor, Switzerland. Football is exciting because we will never be able to fully understand it, but a win on Monday and early qualification for the second round is what the coach, Tite, is after. Then he could use the third game to rotate the squad somewhat and try a few different tactical things for the battles ahead.\nThe win against Serbia was not straightforward. In the first 20 minutes the high and aggressive defending of Dragan Stojkovic\u2019s team put the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o in difficulties. It was interesting to see how they dealt with that. The first game of the tournament is always important, but especially so if you are one of the favourites.\n\nAgainst Serbia Tite\u2019s team did not want to make any mistakes in their defensive third, but this meant that they were not in control of the ball as much from the back as they would have wanted and were therefore unable to properly infiltrate the attacking zone. Brazil are at their best when they can exchange quick passes, create a rhythm and find space for players to attack their opposite numbers one-on-one.\nAt first this did not happen against Serbia and that is clearly something other opponents will take an interest in. Dusan Tadic had a strong start and that, along with the tight and tough marking, had an impact on Brazil\u2019s confidence. True, Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior and Raphinha had some luck on the flanks but Brazil were not able to do what they do best \u2013 keep hold of the ball and work their opponents from side-to-side to create an opening. When everything works Neymar is more of a playmaker than a dribbler, helping Lucas Paquet\u00e1 and Casemiro to play creatively, and there is support from the full-backs. Against Serbia, Neymar held on to the ball a bit longer, which did not help the star of the second half, Richarlison.\n\u201cPombo\u201d, as Richarlison is known, was isolated among the giant defenders but did not give up and dedicated himself to his work. He kept on being visible and showed the mental strength of someone who has gone through hardships to get where he is. He never stops running and, as a sign of his character and human values, he is a striker who never stops fighting. \n\nHis reward came in the second half when Serbia were unable to maintain their high defensive line and threat on the counterattack. To play effectively against Brazil you need to have something approaching Spanish standards in possession and Serbia\u2019s players did not have that.\nAs Brazil asserted themselves the chances started coming and, in the end, Tite\u2019s team were indebted to two goals from Richarlison. The second one, in particular, was stunning but interesting to me was what happened after the striker\u2019s scissor-kick. The en masse celebration was evidence of a group in harmony.\nI don\u2019t like the word union. I always say that before union there needs to be an understanding of each player\u2019s responsibility and the celebration indicated to me this team knows what it means to wear the same shirt and have the same goals, whether they are friends or not. Once you understand what football means, how important victory is for the fans, whether in international or club football, then you understand each other\u2019s needs. Egotistical tendencies are put aside for teamwork above all. Hard work will always come before talent and it looks like this Brazil squad has the maturity to understand this.\nThe main negatives coming out of the Serbia game were the injuries to Neymar and Danilo, who, like the other full-back Alex Sandro, was defensively solid (but it helped that Serbia were not at their best going forward with Sergej Milinkovic-Savic subdued and Filip Kostic not playing).\nHowever, seeing Fred, Rodrygo, Antony, Gabriel Jesus and Gabriel Martinelli coming off the bench indicated Neymar\u2019s absence for the next two games may not be the big problem some people feared. He is, undoubtedly, the star of the team and one of the best players in the world but without him Tite has the option to add another midfielder, such as Fred or possibly Bruno Guimar\u00e3es, to play in a classic 4-3-3 to free up Paquet\u00e1, or keep the same tactical structure to introduce Rodrygo into the team.\n\nTo fill Danilo\u2019s vacancy on the right-hand side we will see if Dani Alves was called up as a genuine playing option or as more of a leader and to bring his champion mentality. I think \u00c9der Milit\u00e3o would be a safer choice but, either way, Tite cannot complain; everywhere he looks in his squad there is quality and options. There are four days between games, enough time to make adjustments while also keeping in mind the physical recovery of the players.\nNow for the Swiss. Not the most stable of teams defensively, they pose a threat going forward through Granit Xhaka, Xherdan Shaqiri and Breel Embolo. They, like most opponents against Brazil, will play like it is their World Cup final and need to be treated with respect.\nWithout Neymar the time has come to show the strength of this squad, a squad that Tite has always said is up to any challenge, whatever is thrown at them."

                    "body": "A 75-year-old British man was trapped in Qatar for more than seven years when he was refused permission to leave after a business dispute. Ranald Crook, who is back in Gloucestershire, was even forbidden to fly home for his father\u2019s funeral as a result of the travel ban, imposed after two influential Qatari brothers took legal action against him. Abdulhadi Awjan al-Hajri and Hamad Awjan al-Hajri were brought in as sponsors of the construction company Geosan/Construction Dynamics, of which Crook was the general manager, because Qatari law at the time dictated that any business there must be at least 51% locally owned. Crook said the brothers\u2019 role was to solve local problems but when they failed to live up to expectations they were replaced, prompting a succession of legal cases against him, which he invariably won, only for a new one to be launched each time so that the travel ban was maintained. \u201cI assumed when the first court case came out we would go through it and that would be that,\u201d said Crook. \u201cBecause we had two brothers who were partners, when that case was thrown out they then started exactly the same case again in the other brother\u2019s name, which they can do. \u201cAnd then they made criminal accusations against me. You always think that sense will prevail but that\u2019s wrong. People need to go into Qatar with their eyes open.\u201d The first case was lodged in August 2014 and Crook would not be able to leave until 20 December 2021 \u2013 seven years, 11 months and 15 days after he was last in the UK. He faced two civil cases and two criminal cases, all of which went to multiple appeals, estimating that he attended more than 50 court hearings. He was victorious on each occasion but claims the cases were an abuse of the court system. Crook said that at the outset of the litigation he and his wife cancelled her residence permit, otherwise she too would have had a travel ban imposed. As a result they spent lengthy periods apart and he could not accompany her back to the UK when she required an urgent hip operation. But he said missing his father\u2019s funeral in 2015, after a court refused to waive the ban, caused him the greatest pain. \u201cIt was the worst day of my life,\u201d he said. \u201cI wrote a eulogy for my son to read out but on the day, it was knowing that he was there, my wife was there, and my relatives \u2013 I will never forget it.\u201d  As unfortunate as his situation was, Crook acknowledges that there are poor workers from developing countries in Qatar, which will host this year\u2019s World Cup, in a far worse plight, without the resources he had to attempt to fight back. When the second criminal case was brought he said he spent a night in police cells with men who appeared to be Pakistani workers. \u201cAfter hearing their stories I wondered if they would ever be released,\u201d he said. \u201cThey had problems with immigration status, or sponsors trying to screw money out of them.\u201d Crook had harsh words for the British government who he says were slow to act and told him they did not consider he had suffered a loss of human rights. He said: \u201cAt the same time, Qatari nationals are investing billions in the UK, with stakes in Barclays bank, Sainsbury\u2019s, Canary Wharf, Heathrow airport, Harrods and the Shard. The real story here is that the UK is nervous of upsetting a state which is bankrolling many projects that are key to our economy.\u201d A Foreign Office spokesperson said consular staff provided support. Hamad Awjan al-Hajri declined to comment. His brother and the Qatari embassy in London did not respond to requests for comment."

                    "body": "Sometimes the scoreboard reflects only one part of a wider story. Yes, England have underperformed this autumn en route to their worst calendar year since 2008. Yes, South Africa were comfortably better on Saturday in their 27-13 victory. But the truest gauge of English rugby\u2019s current predicament was ultimately to be found elsewhere: the boos at the final whistle, the number of spectators leaving early and the savage home truths on social media. England\u2019s biggest problem is not that they have lost a high-profile rugby match or two. It is the fact that they are rapidly losing their nation\u2019s faith. Anyone with a pair of eyes, whether sitting inside Twickenham or at home on the sofa, can see the sweet chariot has stalled with next year\u2019s World Cup now only five competitive games away. Simply to blame Eddie Jones in isolation is to underplay the rising tide of problems now lapping at the Rugby Football Union\u2019s door.  Only some of them are on the field. A domestic game in financial meltdown, a steep decline in adult male participation, concussion concerns, a sluggish stop-start spectacle, a new head coach: the in-tray of the RFU\u2019s chief executive, Bill Sweeney, was stacked high even before these last few chastening days. Worst of all, though, the world\u2019s biggest union is at risk of jeopardising its holy grail: the umbilical link between the grassroots and the game\u2019s top end and, specifically, the ability of England sides to inspire and excite young and old even when victory proves elusive. No wonder a terse Sunday lunchtime statement from Sweeney \u2013 \u201cResults are not where we expect them to be\u201d \u2013 implied a sterner-than-usual post-tournament review. Take away the last nine minutes against New Zealand and a flurry of points against a flat Japan and England have resembled frowning final-year students wrestling with the first paragraph of a complex dissertation. As Jones correctly observed, no team looks great when their set piece is being smashed. Even so, the gap between England\u2019s joyless rugby and the depth of playing resources at their disposal is steadily widening. If the right players are being selected they are certainly not displaying the best of themselves. A cursory skim back over the past year\u2019s results would also suggest any progress since 2019 has been mostly cosmetic. Remember the ill discipline during the Scotland defeat at Murrayfield back in February? The four-try home drubbing by Ireland (admittedly with 14 men for much of it) and France\u2019s 25-13 stroll in Paris? Against the Irish, French and Springboks, perhaps the three best scrummaging packs in the world, England have managed two tries in 240 minutes, scored when they were trailing 18-6 and 27-6 respectively.  So, when Jones called Saturday\u2019s defeat a \u201cwatershed game for us\u201d, he was correct on many fronts. The summer series victory in Australia always seemed as if it might have papered over a few cracks and they have duly reappeared. England\u2019s game is predicated on a dominant front five and a strong aerial game; on Saturday they possessed neither. If Billy Vunipola and Manu Tuilagi remain irresistible forces of nature, they are keeping it well hidden while the most dynamic English-qualified No 8, Zach Mercer, is in France and will not be available for the Six Nations. Anything else? Both wings look short of their best form and the Marcus Smith/Owen Farrell axis remains an uneasy marriage. Unless there is a Georgian prop with an English grandparent lurking out there, there are no ready-made tight-head saviours in waiting while the defence coach, Anthony Seibold, is off home to Australia. The summer tour captain, Courtney Lawes, has been much missed but he turns 34 in February and cannot soldier on indefinitely. Which is why the Twickenham alarm bells are belatedly clanging. What price Jones\u2019s mission statement in January 2020 \u2013 \u201cWe want to be the greatest rugby team the world has ever seen\u201d \u2013 off the back of six defeats and a draw in their 12 Tests in 2022? England are considering a potential World Cup quarter-final against Australia, Wales or Fiji but first they need to escape their pool.  Before that comes a Six Nations opener against Scotland, whom England have beaten once in their past five meetings. Even a revitalised Italy may cause a few problems, let alone France and Ireland. The hooker Jamie George freely concedes a slow start to the Six Nations is unthinkable if England really have serious World Cup ambitions. \u201cThis Six Nations is important,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to go in there and start putting into place exactly the sort of team we want to be and the identity we want to have, because time is running out in that respect.\u201d It needs emphasising, of course, that South Africa are a good side destined to become even stronger when Lukhanyo Am, Duane Vermeulen, Cheslin Kolbe and others are back and available. But when knowledgeable former players such as Jeremy Guscott openly tweet their despair \u2013 \u2018Can\u2019t remember the last time I felt so frustrated after watching an Eng rugby team play. Serious reboot of some kind needs to happen for the players to rediscover their brilliance\u201d \u2013 it is no longer possible to brush this autumn\u2019s failings under the Twickenham shag-pile. Anyone with a working knowledge of RFU politics will be staggered if the head coach is jettisoned now, not least because executive resignations would immediately have to follow. Once the English rugby public loses faith, though, things rarely end well."

Real Madrid and his family gave all the papers required showing he was born in a hospital in Madrid, that he studied here, that he spent all his life growing up here. It was a complicated time for him because he didn\u2019t know when Fifa would give him the green light to play again.\u201d\n\nAlong with Zidane\u2019s sons Enzo and Luca, Hakimi was back a few weeks later in Real\u2019s reserve side and made his senior debut for Morocco the following month in a 4\u20130 win against Canada. He had represented the Atlas Lions at junior level and Spain\u2019s attempt to persuade the attacking right-back who grew up in Getafe \u2013 a suburb of Madrid \u2013 to accept a call-up for their under-19s a year before had fallen on deaf ears.\n\u201cI discovered him in 2010 and I\u2019ve been keeping an eye on him since then,\u201d Takassa said. \u201cWe\u2019ve spoken with him regularly and the federation\u2019s technical director travelled to Madrid to see him. We\u2019ve outlined our project, which is very competitive, and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever had any doubts.\u201d\nHakimi will win his 58th cap, at the age of 24, in Morocco\u2019s historic showdown against Spain in the last 16 of the World Cup on Tuesday. It will be a poignant moment for the Paris Saint-Germain player, who celebrated the famous victory over Belgium in Group F by kissing his mother in the stands and will now attempt to go one better than the 1986 side that lost to West Germany at this stage. \u201cI love you Mum,\u201d Hakimi tweeted after the match, accompanied by photos of them embracing.\n\nSaida Mou, Hakimi\u2019s mother, used to clean houses in the Spanish capital, and her husband was a street vendor. \u201cWe come from a modest family that struggled to earn a living,\u201d Hakimi said in an interview when he joined Borussia Dortmund on loan from Madrid in 2018. \u201cToday I fight every day for them. They sacrificed themselves for me. They deprived my brothers of many things for me to succeed.\u201d\nAt the last count, there were almost 900,000 Moroccans living in Spain, making them the largest foreign community legally settled in the country. Hakimi is by no means the only member of Walid Regragui\u2019s cosmopolitan squad who was born overseas.\n\nOnly 12 \u2013 the fewest of any nation in Qatar \u2013 were born in the country they are representing in an illustration of Morocco\u2019s large diaspora. The winger Sofiane Boufal and Romain Sa\u00efss, the captain, were, like Regragui, born and raised in France; the midfield general Sofyan Amrabat and Hakim Ziyech grew up in the Netherlands; and several of the squad were born in Belgium, such as Genk\u2019s emerging talent Bilal El Khannous. The reserve goalkeeper Munir was born in Melilla, an autonomous city of Spain on the north African mainland.\nEven with Ziyech\u2019s return after he announced his international retirement following a disagreement with the former coach Vahid Halilhodzic, Hakimi remains the team\u2019s star. Having become the first Moroccan to play for Real Madrid, in 2017, his brilliant two-year spell in the Bundesliga earned a move to Internazionale, where he thrived under Antonio Conte and won the scudetto. Hakimi turned down a move to Chelsea to join PSG for an initial \u20ac60m last year and has developed a strong understanding with Lionel Messi. But his qualities are no less appreciated by Regragui, particularly after the assist for Morocco\u2019s second goal in the final group match against Canada, when his brilliant pass from his own half set up Youssef En-Nesyri to score.\n\u201cLook at Hakimi \u2013 he played injured to the very last minute; all Moroccans should praise him every day,\u201d Regragui said after Morocco sealed top spot in Group F.\n\nThe thigh injury he sustained in the opening match against Croatia is being carefully managed by Morocco\u2019s medical staff but there is little doubt Hakimi will be ready to face the country of his birth.\n\u201cHere in Paris you play for the team of the city, but it\u2019s not the same to play with the team of your country,\u201d Hakimi said in an interview before the World Cup with Vogue Arabia that also featured his wife, the actor Hiba Abouk, who is best known for her role in El Pr\u00edncipe, a TV drama set in Ceuta, another Spanish autonomous city on Morocco\u2019s north coast.\n\u201cMillions and millions of people are going to support you because you play for them. It\u2019s like you play for your grandfather and their grandfathers. You play for a lot of people, a lot of Moroccans.\u201d"

                    "body": "The Socceroos came dangerously close to a feel-good story in 2021. World Cup qualifying had resumed after a lengthy Covid-enforced layoff and the team were rollicking through Asia\u2019s second phase. Hockey scorelines had become the norm, Harry Souttar was having a pre-ACL field day and other newcomers offered glimpses of a greener and more golden future. Even against more modest opposition such as Taiwan and Nepal, the emphatic results felt pleasing. Winning is irresistible, even when it is anticipated. So when Australia completed that second round undefeated and began the third with a Fifa-record 11th consecutive World Cup qualifying victory, we did \u2013 as Graham Arnold would say \u2013 expect to win.  Amid the encouragement there were well-founded cautions. That the Socceroos have long laboured to pull well-organised defences out of shape. That they lack the tactical sophistication to score through the middle and rely too heavily on set pieces. These were points surely made within the Japan and Saudi Arabia camps throughout this period \u2013 that one of their main rivals in qualifying Group B were about to encounter some potholes. And so it came to pass. After wins over China, Vietnam and Oman, Australia lost to Japan in Saitama. After that match, on 12 October, they recorded a single win \u2013 against last-placed Vietnam \u2013 from the subsequent six games. In their four fixtures against first-placed Saudi Arabia and second-placed Japan they lost three and drew one. They scored once \u2013 from a free-kick. Over the course of those testing six months, almost all of that initial zest unravelled with the results. The periodic anxiety around youth development in this country once again crescendoed. Any appetite for goodwill towards Arnold eroded to such an extent that Football Australia was forced to issue a statement confirming he will not be sacked before the playoffs. Which is where we are now, at this critical juncture in a curious qualifying campaign and with a World Cup on the line. Lose to the United Arab Emirates in Doha on Tuesday (Wednesday morning AEST) and there will be no second and decisive playoff against Peru. It will be the end of the road. To Qatar 2022. For Arnold\u2019s tenure. For Australia\u2019s run of four successive World Cups.  The UAE are not unbeatable, by any stretch. But they are also very capable of undoing the Socceroos, as they did in the quarter-finals of the 2019 Asian Cup \u2013 a tournament of middling performances which again feel pertinent. In that match, an Australian defensive error allowed Ali Mabkhout to dribble free and score the winner. Mabkhout has 14 goals in this qualifying cycle \u2013 the most across all the confederations \u2013 and, alongside returning talisman Omar Abdulrahman, has the capacity to make life very difficult. The Socceroos, of course, have attacking strengths of their own, though who Arnold picks is anyone\u2019s guess given his experimentation during last week\u2019s friendly against Jordan. This sudden-death playoff, though, is more than selection debates. It is more than Arnold\u2019s fate, and the millions of Fifa dollars that FA stands to lose. It is far more profound than all of that. It is, according to the navel-gazing corner, life or death for Australian football. Others say a failure to qualify would be a good thing, a shock which forces long-needed structural change to build for a better future. Throw those two camps into a room together for 90 minutes and you will have empirical evidence for existential dread (extra-time and penalties might skew the results). For the players and their coach, tucked away in a training bubble in Doha, this concerns the very fabric of the national team, the intangible pride that is the sum of its parts.  \u201cIt would mean everything,\u201d Arnold told AAP. \u201cI don\u2019t want anything more in life at this moment than to qualify for the World Cup for the players and for the nation. I\u2019ve been involved in Australian football around the Socceroos for nearly 40 years. I debuted in 1983-84 and I\u2019ve been here pretty much since then, even if it\u2019s with the A-League. My passion has always been Australian football, and I\u2019d love nothing more.\u201d It is something a former Socceroos great understands well. Tim Cahill, a \u201cglobal Qatar legacy ambassador\u201d, paid a visit to camp on Sunday and delivered a speech during a team lunch. To be fair Cahill is, after all, Australia\u2019s all-time leading goalscorer and one of only two to have been a part of four World Cup squads. The other, Mark Milligan, was pointed in his thoughts. \u201cI hope people understand the magnitude of not qualifying for a World Cup,\u201d the former captain and now Network 10 pundit said over the weekend. \u201cIt\u2019s so, so important. I keep hearing talk around the place that if we don\u2019t make it, we\u2019re probably in a good place \u2013 we\u2019ll survive. We need to be of the attitude that we have to make it, and I know that\u2019s where the players will be.\u201d  Follow the game with our minute-by-minute liveblog. Kick off is Tuesday 9pm local/7pm BST/Wednesday 4am AEST "

                    "body": "Only football does this. In the end, it had to be him. After two tense, enthralling, exhausting hours and seven agonising minutes lived on the edge, the moment came, Achraf Hakimi standing on the spot, the world watching. Raised in Madrid, one of 17 footballers born beyond Morocco\u2019s frontiers who help make up this marvellous team, forged from home and the diaspora, his was the seventh penalty in the shootout. It was also an opportunity to send the Atlas Lions into the quarter-finals of the World Cup for the first time \u2013 and eliminate the country where he grew up.\nPressure, what pressure? Hakimi barely broke into a run, virtually walking up, and dinked gently into the net. The scene was serene, the flight of the ball too but not for long, bedlam taking over. He shuffled a little dance and smiled. In front of him, fans exploded. Behind him, teammates sprinted his way. Together they made for Yassine Bounou, goalkeeper and hero who waited, arms wide. Then they fell to their knees and prayed.\nA measure of how big this was came from the media. One journalist took the microphone. \u201cI don\u2019t have a question,\u201d he told Bounou and the coach Walid Regragui, who has been in the job for little more than three months, \u201cI just wanted to say thanks.\u201d Voice breaking, in tears now, he launched into a long, emotional speech, that ended with applause.\n\nHistory had been made, all right, and how they had fought for it, delivering the first upset in the knockouts \u2013 if that is what this was. Spain are out; Africa\u2019s last remaining team are through and they are some side. Six and half hours have passed at this World Cup, and not one opponent has beaten Bounou \u2013 who has \u201cBono\u201d on his shirt. Morocco have conceded a single goal, and they scored that themselves. Even when it went to penalties, there was no way past.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t change anything; just their goalkeeper,\u201d Luis Enrique insisted afterwards. Bono saved two \u2013 from Sergio Busquets and Carlos Soler \u2013 and watched the first come back off a post. It had been taken by Pablo Sarabia, who was now in tears.\nHow could he not be? Sarabia had not played in this tournament before he was introduced with two minutes left, precisely to take the penalty. His was the first, supposed to set Spain on their way. Instead, he struck the post for the second time in two touches. On with a post\u2011match mission he had unexpectedly been handed a moment before the final whistle: suddenly appearing a yard from goal, he sent the ball flying off the far post on 122.50, 10 seconds from time. Which might have helped to explain why it now happened again, the weight of responsibility too much. Crikey, this was cruel.\n\nNot that Morocco cared, and they will feel they deserved it. This place, which was very much their place, erupted. A fascinating game was also a special occasion. Morocco dominated this stadium, decked in red and green, Education City their home for the evening. That had been evident from the start, the selecci\u00f3n whistled every time they got the ball. The supporters needed some serious lungs: Spain would end up with 76% of possession and more than thousand passes.\nMorocco needed them, too; this was a truly monumental effort, their intent underlined when it took 18 seconds for the first foul, Hakim Ziyech taking down Jordi Alba. \u201cEvery time you see Spain\u2019s shirt, you know what you\u2019re going to get,\u201d Regragui had said, and soon this settled into a pattern. Except that settled wasn\u2019t the word. Sure, Spain carried the weight of the game if a little bluntly, but there was an edge, a rhythm, and if there were ultimately no goals that didn\u2019t diminish it. Defending like this is an art and there were chances too, flashes that might have changed everything and fired a warning: Morocco are not finished yet.\nWhen they robbed, they ran, direct and fast, yet to say that is to oversimplify. This team impress in tight spaces, working their way out of corners before setting off. Hakimi was immense. Sofyan Amrabat was everywhere. And afterwards Luis Enrique asked after Azzedine Ounahi. \u201cMadre mia,\u201d he said, \u201cwhere did he come from?\u201d The answer at Education City was: everywhere.\n\nThe best moments meanwhile came from Sofiane Boufal, all soft feet and slick movement, a gorgeous shuffle that bamboozled Marcos Llorente the most eye-catching. Spain had their moments too, of course, if fewer than they sought. Gavi hit the bar and Ferran Torres was somehow blocked in the first half. The next minute Marco Asensio struck into the side netting. A superb shift of weight then saw Boufal cross for Nayef Aguerd to head over at the other end.\nThe two sides became increasingly entrenched in their identities as the second half progressed. Spain could not quite find clarity; Morocco had it but, tiring now, not always the precision to complete transitions at pace. Youssef En-Nesyri went too early on the most promising break and as time slipped away so the stress increased. It was relentless, Morocco surely feeling this in their legs, their excursions fewer now, although there were opportunities. Especially for Walid Cheddira, who twice lacked the speed or tranquility to take them. Unai Sim\u00f3n saved one deep in extra time.\nStill it was in the balance, still Spain pushed, and Sarabia struck the post. The next time he touched the ball, in the shootout, it happened again. Abdelhamid Sabiri scored, Ziyech did too, and then came the coolest man in the whole of Qatar.\n\u2022 This article was amended on 7 December 2022. Achraf Hakimi scored the seventh penalty of the shootout, not the sixth as an earlier version said."

                    "body": "  3.37pm    Simon Burnton\u2019s report from Perth is in, so that\u2019s enough rambling from me. Thanks for joining in!      3.28pm    Thought I heard a bit of Hans Zimmer earlier too. Top choice.       3.27pm    Numbers. Very good numbers.       3.24pm    Just realised that was Sam Curran\u2019s first World Cup game for England, which feels weird because he\u2019s been around for a while. He\u2019s become Buttler\u2019s go-to man at the death and here\u2019s what he had to say to Michael Atherton at the presentation: \u201cEarly in my career I was probably more suited to the powerplay, but I\u2019ve tried to get better at different phases of the game and just trying to keep contributing to the team.\u201d     3.13pm   England beat Afghanistan by five wickets  A wide is the winning run for England! It wasn\u2019t a rollicking chase \u2013 in fact, I\u2019m not sure any batter looked comfortable out there today. The difference came in how both sides were in the field: England were clinical with their catching; Afghanistan less so. Sam Curran will take the plaudits for his sparkling figures of 5-10.      3.09pm    18th over: England 111-5 (Livingstone 28, Moeen 8) A misfield at cover helps Livingstone pick up two off Nabi\u2019s first ball of the over. Moeen cuts hard for a couple of his own. Just two runs needed from the final two overs.      3.06pm    17th over: England 104-5 (Livingstone 25, Moeen 4) Farooqi returns for his final over as Moeen and Livingstone both pick up a couple of singles. We\u2019re nearly there now.      3.02pm    16th over: England 100-5 (Moeen 2, Livingstone 23) Rashid Khan finishes his work, going for 1-17 off his four overs. England need 13 from 24.  Updated at 3.03pm BST    2.58pm   WICKET! Brook c Zadran b Rashid 7 (England 97-5)  Brook tries to go big off Rashid Khan but can only find long-on.     2.56pm    15th over: England 95-4 (Brook 5, Livingstone 22) Back-to-back boundaries for Liam Livingstone: a misfield helps him when he drives through the off side; a cut behind point follows to ease the pressure off England.      2.52pm   WICKET! Malan c Nabi b Mujeeb 18 (England 81-4)  And just after I mention England\u2019s boundary drought, Liam Livingstone clips Mujeeb for four. After Livingstone gets off strike, Mohammad Nabi takes a screamer to get rid of Malan! The No.3, who\u2019s had a tough time out there today, gets decent contact on the ball but Nabi leaps to his right at cover to hold on.  14th over: England 81-4 (Livingstone 13, Brook 0)     2.46pm    13th over: England 76-3 (Livingstone 8, Malan 18) Nabi continues, darting them in; the boundaries have completely dried up. England need 37 from 42 balls.      2.42pm    12th over: England 71-3 (Livingstone 4, Malan 17) England remain quiet against Rashid Khan, who refuses to give any room for a big shot.     2.39pm    11th over: England 66-3 (Livingstone 1, Malan 15) Liam Livingstone comes in at No.5 for England. Nabi concedes just four from the over. This chase is getting tricky\u2026     2.36pm   WICKET! Stokes b Nabi 2 (England 65-3)  Mohammad Nabi brings himself on to twirl some offies and he strikes by going straight through Stokes! The batter advances and it\u2019s an arm ball that hits the stumps via a deflection off the pads.   Updated at 3.11pm BST    2.32pm    10th over: England 62-2 (Malan 13, Stokes 1) England aren\u2019t racing here; they\u2019ve been forced into taking care against Rashid\u2019s tweak. Is there still a game on here? 51 needed from 60 balls.      2.27pm    9th over: England 59-2 (Malan 10, Stokes 1) A good over from Farid is slightly tarnished by a bouncer that flies over for five wides.      2.26pm   WICKET! Hales c Farooqi b Farid 19 (England 52-2)  Left-arm quick Farid is into the attack and removes Hales! The opener doesn\u2019t get a hold of the pull shot, and Farooqi runs in from the deep to take a much-needed grab for Afghanistan.   Updated at 3.09pm BST    2.21pm    8th over: England 50-1 (Hales 18, Malan 8) Dropped! From the penultimate ball of the over, Hales goes for a cross-bat smash down the ground and Mohammad Nabi, running to his right at long-off, gets there \u2013 but can\u2019t hold on.      2.18pm    7th over: England 44-1 (Malan 4, Hales 16) Afghanistan\u2019s hope is here: Rashid Khan. Hales picks up a single from the leggie\u2019s first ball before Malan tries a reverse sweep \u2013 no contact with the bat though as the keeper collects. A cut follows from the left-hander behind point to bring a couple. Rashid nabs a couple of dots before Malan cuts once again, taking one this time.      2.14pm    6th over: England 40-1 (Hales 15, Malan 1) Mujeeb races through his over, conceding five from it.      2.11pm   WICKET! Buttler c Mujeeb b Farooqi 18 (England 35-1)  Fazalhaq continues and begins with a yorker that Hales can\u2019t squeeze away for more than a dot. After a wide, Hales is dropped at backward point by Qais Ahmad! And then the punishment: Hales makes room for a meaty swing for six over long-on. But Farooqi then strikes with his final ball of the over! The ball is full, swinging in and Buttler\u2019s clip flies high and into the hands of the man at deep midwicket.   5th over: England 35-1 (Hales 11, Malan 0)  Updated at 2.38pm BST    2.04pm    4th over: England 27-0 (Hales 4, Buttler 18) The mystery works of Mujeeb enter the game. Buttler and Hales exchange singles before the former rocks back to chip the ball over the off-side ring for a couple. The two batters continue to run hard, picking up two more next ball.      2.01pm    3rd over: England 21-0 (Buttler 13, Hales 3) Farooqi goes wide with his fourth ball of the over and Buttler cuts effortlessly for four more.      1.56pm    2nd over: England 14-0 (Hales 2, Buttler 9) Buttler at his best: Azmatullah is full with his third ball and the England captain, with a gentle push, picks up four through the covers. A good stop from Zazai at short fine leg stops Buttler from picking up four more later in the over.      1.50pm    1st over: England 5-0 (Hales 0, Buttler 4) Left-armer Fazalhaq Farooqi opens up for Afghanistan and Buttler clips his second ball off the pads for four. Farooqi then manages to get some decent movement away from the right-hander, with two slips waiting for an outside edge. Buttler is forced to remain patient.      1.45pm    He really was terrific today.       1.42pm    Yep, I reckon only a Rashid special can get Afghanistan back in this.       1.39pm    A very assured display from England in the field. Curran starred at the death, Wood\u2019s pace was terrifying, and Stokes finished with 2-19 from his four overs. Some cracking grabs out there, too.      1.36pm   Five-wicket haul for Sam Curran  Curran gets his fifth to wrap up the innings! Farooqi swings hard and the ball flies into the hands of Dawid Malan at gully. What a lovely moment that is for the all-rounder as he finishes with stunning figures of 5-10. Afghanistan have been bowled out for 112, collapsing spectacularly from 109-5.   Updated at 1.56pm BST    1.32pm   WICKET! Ghani c Livingstone b Curran 30 (Afghanistan 112-9)  No hat-trick for Curran but he takes a wicket with his next ball! Ghani slashes hard and finds Livingstone at deep point. The fun continues for the left-armer.      1.31pm    19th over: Afghanistan 112-8 (Ghani 30, Farid 2) Finally, a drop from England! Farid cuts and Hales, diving to his right at backward point, is unable to hold on. That was a really tough one.      1.29pm   WICKET! Mujeeb c&amp;b Woakes 0 (Afghanistan 110-8)  Another one! Chris Woakes takes a one-handed return catch off his bowling to get rid of Mujeeb first ball!     1.27pm   WICKET! Rashid c Hales b Curran 0 (Afghanistan 109-7)  Two in two! Curran goes short again and Rashid Khan pulls to Hales at fine leg. England are rampant. 18th over: Afghanistan 109-7 (Ghani 29, Mujeeb 0)   Updated at 1.57pm BST    1.26pm   WICKET! Azmatullah c Stokes b Curran 8 (Afghanistan 109-6)  England go up for a review after Curran strikes the back pad of Ghani \u2013 but the ball is pitching outside leg stump. Curran can celebrate just moments later, though \u2013 he goes short and Azmatullah swats the ball to Stokes at deep midwicket.      1.21pm    17th over: Afghanistan 106-5 (Ghani 28, Azmatullah 7) Rashid a little too short with his penultimate ball and Ghani fetches four at the fine-leg boundary. Rashid finishes with a sharp googly \u2013 but it\u2019s a wicketless outing for him today.      1.17pm    16th over: Afghanistan 97-5 (Ghani 23, Azmatullah 5) Azamtullah is the new batter and he\u2019s off the mark straight away with a bunt down the ground for four. Wood\u2019s work for the night is done, and it\u2019s been a pleasure to watch.      1.15pm   WICKET! Nabi c Buttler b Wood 3 (Afghanistan 91-5)  Jos Buttler, that\u2019s ridiculous! Wood goes short and fast (obvs), Nabi gloves behind and Buttler flies with one hand to his left to take a screamer. England aren\u2019t dropping anything today.    Updated at 1.39pm BST    1.13pm    15th over: Afghanistan 89-4 (Nabi 1, Ghani 22) Stokes tests out Ghani with the short ball, and the batter obliges with a pull for four. The over finishes with another short one, and it looks like it\u2019ll be another boundary\u2026 but substitute fielder Chris Jordan pulls off an excellent stop at fine leg.      1.09pm   WICKET! Najibullah c Rashid b Stokes 13 (Afghanistan 82-4)  Another terrific bit of work in the field from England. Stokes pulls out the slower ball and Najibullah doesn\u2019t get the required contact \u2013 Rashid, running back from mid-on, does brilliantly to hold on.      1.07pm    14th over: Afghanistan 82-3 (Najbullah 13, Ghani 16) Wood returns to crank it up. The two batters have to make do with nabbing the odd single; Wood doesn\u2019t offer anything loose to throw the bat at.      1.01pm    13th over: Afghanistan 78-3 (Ghani 13, Najibullah 12) Najibullah Zadran is the new batter at the crease and he gets a hold of a tossed-up leg-break \u2013 he sends Rashid for a straight six. The left-hander then cuts hard at a googly, running back for a very tight two. He looks like he\u2019s gonna try and give everything a proper wallop.      12.57pm    12th over: Afghanistan 65-3 (Ghani 11, Najibullah 1) Top over from Curran. Afghanistan are struggling to build any sort of momentum here.      12.55pm   WICKET! Zadran c Moeen b Curran 32 (Afghanistan 62-3)  Zadran goes! He tries to advance down the track but hasn\u2019t read the Curran cutter \u2013 the ball lobs off the bat high into the night sky and Moeen Ali runs back from cover to hold on.    Updated at 1.24pm BST    12.52pm    11th over: Afghanistan 62-2 (Zadran 32, Ghani 10) A wicked Rashid googly nearly does for Usman Ghani, but he just about hacks away for a single. A bit too short from Rashid a few moments later, with Ghani swatting away to deep midwicket for a couple. Afghanistan are swinging away for a bit hit \u2013 but Rashid doesn\u2019t suffer any real punishment.      12.48pm    10th over: Afghanistan 55-2 (Zadran 29, Ghani 6) A release for Afghanistan as Stokes goes wide and full outside off, with Zadran unfurling a gorgeous drive for four. Stokes goes full again with his next ball, which lets Zadran pick up a couple. We\u2019re halfway through the innings \u2013 Afghanistan really need to get moving in the next three or four overs.      12.42pm    9th over: Afghanistan 46-2 (Zadran 19, Ghani 8) Adil Rashid gets his twirl on and concedes just four runs from the over.      12.39pm    8th over: Afghanistan 42-2 (Zadran 18, Ghani 5) Sam Curran sprints in to show off his bag of left-arm tricks. After a neat start \u2013 just a single from his first four balls \u2013 he goes too straight, allowing Ghani to tickle the ball off the hips for four.      12.35pm    7th over: Afghanistan 37-2 (Zadran 17, Ghani 1) England are in control.     12.34pm   WICKET! Zazai c Livingstone b Stokes 7 (Afghanistan 35-2)  What a catch! This is class from Liam Livingstone. Stokes goes short and wide, Zadran lets out the cut, but it\u2019s not middled as the ball flies high behind point \u2013 Livingstone sprints in from the deep and gets low to hold on.    Updated at 1.09pm BST    12.30pm    6th over: Afghanistan 35-1 (Zazai 7, Zadran 16) Woakes gets the outside edge of Zadran but the ball flies out of the reach of the diving Buttler, running away for four. That prompts the skipper to bring in a slip \u2013 only for one ball though after Zadran picks up a couple through the leg side.      12.25pm    5th over: Afghanistan 27-1 (Zazai 7, Zadran 10) Zadran uses the pace brilliantly, here: Wood goes short and the right-hander helps the ball over fine-leg for six. Wood, operating in the nineties (mph), bounces back with some thunderbolts past the bat, Zadran unable to lay anything on them.      12.21pm    4th over: Afghanistan 20-1 (Zazai 6, Zadran 4) Woakes gets four dots in a row before going short and wide, a gift for Zazai who cuts hard for four.     12.20pm         12.18pm    3rd over: Afghanistan 15-1 (Zazai 1, Zadran 4) Wood goes too full with his fourth ball, and Zadran leans in to drive through the covers for four. Otherwise, it\u2019s just dots from the over. Fast, electric and eternally watchable \u2013 Mark Wood has arrived at this World Cup.  Updated at 12.22pm BST    12.13pm   WICKET! Gurbaz c Buttler b Wood 10 (Afghanistan 11-1)  Mark Wood strikes with his first ball of the tournament! It\u2019s rapid, the perfect length, and gets the edge of Gurbaz. Buttler does the rest. Gorgeous bowling.   Updated at 12.56pm BST    12.11pm    2nd over: Afghanistan 11-0 (Gurbaz 10, Zazai 1) Woakes runs in from the other end and grabs an edge off Gurbaz with his second ball \u2013 but the shot has control, the ball staying low on its way to third man as he grabs two. And then a stunning stroke: Gurbaz moves across the stumps, gets down and whips Woakes for six over the fine-leg boundary.      12.07pm    1st over: Afghanistan 2-0 (Gurbaz 1, Zazai 1) Stokes takes the new ball and begins with a dot before Zazai clips to the leg-side for a single. The right-hander Gurbaz blocks one before playing and missing outside off. Another play-and-miss follows as Gurbaz goes down the track for a big swing. A single closes out the over \u2013 tidy start from England.      12.01pm    We\u2019ve heard the anthems. Ben Stokes has the ball. Let\u2019s go!     11.50am    Right then, we\u2019re about 10 minutes away from getting this show on the road. Time for this tune from last year\u2019s tournament to get me in the mood:       11.46am    The teams: England: Jos Buttler, Alex Hales, Dawid Malan, Ben Stokes, Harry Brook, Moeen Ali, Liam Livingstone, Sam Curran, Chris Woakes, Adil Rashid, Mark Wood Afghanistan: Hazratullah Zazai, Rahmanullah Gurbaz, Ibrahim Zadran, Najibullah Zadran, Usman Ghani, Mohammad Nabi, Azmatullah Omarzai, Rashid Khan, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Mujeeb Ur Rahman, Farid Malik     11.38am   England win the toss and choose to bowl  \u201cWe just feel like we\u2019d like a chase.\u201d Jos Buttler wins the toss and his men will start with the ball. Willey, Jordan, Salt and Mills miss out for England. They\u2019re going in with seven batters.      11.26am    In Sydney, New Zealand have thumped hosts and defending champions Australia by 89 runs. What a result that is.       11.13am   Preamble  They were an over away from winning the whole thing in 2016. In 2021, things were looking good in the semi-final until Jimmy Neesham went big and Daryl Mitchell held his nerve. England have looked the part in this tournament since their 2015 white-ball rejig \u2013 but on both occasions they\u2019ve fallen just short, missing that little something special at the backend to seal the deal. Third-time lucky? The case for going all the way this year is a strong one. After a difficult summer, they made a historic trip over to Pakistan and finished with two dominant displays to take the series 4-3. With a fully-fit Jos Buttler back at the helm, they kicked off this tour of Australia with a 2-0 win earlier this month. There\u2019s a silly amount of power in that batting line-up, Mark Wood\u2019s bowling rockets and, while the Ben Stokes situation is slightly awkward, he brings that extra stardust. England fans, you\u2019re allowed to dream.  But this\u2019ll be a tricky first task. Afghanistan have Rashid Khan, arguably the best T20 cricketer on the planet. Then there are the wily tricks of Mujeeb Ur Rahman to contend with too. Whatever happens, this is gonna be good fun. I\u2019ll be back later with the toss. Drop into my DMs whenever you fancy.   "

                    "body": "With a mis-hit shot that squirmed past the wicketkeeper and away for four, Sam Curran brought England\u2019s eighth game against Pakistan in little more than a month, and their T20 World Cup preparations, to an appropriately messy conclusion. Played in an eerie, echoey, empty stadium in Brisbane, an atmosphere reminiscent of the peak Covid sporting hellscape, this was a match of occasionally chaotic running, sometimes hapless fielding and frequently wild hitting, a game of freebies and second chances. But by winning by six wickets, with 26 balls remaining, England extended the positive momentum which built across their recent series against Pakistan and Australia. As Jos Buttler said: \u201cI think everything we wanted to get out of today we did.\u201d  England had made it clear that they would have preferred not to have played this game at all, but for Liam Livingstone at least it was important. Nearly two months after his last appearance the 29-year-old returned from ankle injury to contribute with both bat and ball, surely doing enough to secure his place in the side to face Afghanistan on Saturday. If England choose to play a bowler-heavy side his return would come at the expense of Harry Brook, a decision rendered more difficult by the 23-year-old\u2019s continued excellence \u2013 he batted beautifully here, scoring 45 off 24 balls. Livingstone was not only England\u2019s most economical bowler, he then scored 28 off 16, memorably sending one mighty six on to the stadium roof (and also, admittedly, benefitting from two calamitous drops in as many balls). This was a night when Livingstone\u2019s luck was in \u2013 as proved when, after his first couple of deliveries, he signalled with windmilling arms for Curran to move round from deep square leg to deep midwicket, and Shan Masood dutifully lifted the very next delivery into his hands. \u201cIt was great to see him play so well,\u201d Buttler said. \u201cHe\u2019s been hitting the ball so well in the nets and we know what a dangerous player he is, so I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll take a lot from that outing.\u201d It said much about Pakistan\u2019s approach to this slightly rain-abbreviated game that they opened the batting with Haider Ali, for the first time since February 2021, and Shan Masood, for the first time ever. Neither Babar Azam nor Mohammad Rizwan, who only injury or an act of God could stop from opening when their World Cup campaign begins against India on Sunday, were in the lineup. But, however unfamiliar they were with their role, Haider and Masood started the game impressively.  Ben Stokes again opened the bowling, having done so for the first time in his career in the third and final T20 against Australia. The link between him opening the bowling and it raining remains unproven, but the evidence is mounting. After six overs Pakistan were 66 for one and motoring. But they slowed when England turned to spin in the middle overs, and eventually reached 160 in their 19 overs. England\u2019s response took precisely the opposite form, starting soberly before eventually running wildly out of control. Stokes clubbed an 18-ball 36, with three sixes and a couple of fours, but it was only after Livingstone\u2019s dismissal that they reached top speed, as Curran joined Brook for a freewheeling partnership of 59 runs in 25 balls. Earlier Australia had conjured defeat from the jaws of victory against India, a match made memorable by its preposterous conclusion. Put in to bat India scored 186 for seven, with KL Rahul and Suryakumar Yadav both hitting half-centuries, but Australia controlled their run chase excellently and with an over to go required just 11. Mohammed Shami\u2019s first two balls went for two apiece, but then Virat Kohli brilliantly caught Pat Cummins on the long-on boundary and Shami first ran out Ashton Agar then clean bowled both Josh Inglis and Kane Richardson to seal a ludicrous win. Australia will not be alone in being grateful that these matches will not count towards official statistics but if they wanted anything from the game it was for Aaron Finch to hint at a return to form and his 54-ball 76 did that and more."

                    "body": "The England head coach, Simon Middleton, is leaving his post at the end of the Women\u2019s Six Nations campaign, with regret at missing out on the World Cup but pride at transforming the landscape of the game for female players. The 57-year-old took the Red Roses to the Women\u2019s World Cup final in 2017 and 2022, but they were twice foiled by New Zealand. England built a record-breaking 30-match winning run before they were edged out by the Black Ferns 34-31 in Auckland three months ago. After taking charge in 2015, Middleton guided England to five Six Nations titles, including four grand slams, but feels the time is right for him to leave.  \u201cThere have been great memories built around success and great memories built around defeat,\u201d said Middleton. \u201cDo I regret not signing off winning the World Cup as a head coach? Yes for sure, but I know we can all live with that because we could not have worked harder or given more; sometimes that\u2019s just not quite enough and it wasn\u2019t on the day. \u201cRepresenting England in a coaching or playing capacity must be the pinnacle of any sporting career and I can\u2019t put into words how proud and fortunate I\u2019ve been to be able to do this for the last nine years. \u201cDuring this tenure, I have worked with incredible players and staff and I will miss the daily interactions. I would like to say a huge thank you for their efforts and everything they have done to support the programme and contribute to our success. \u201cNow our attentions turn to being able to perform as well as we can with the goal of winning the Six Nations. It\u2019s a really exciting tournament, culminating in a match against France at Twickenham in front of a huge crowd, which will be an inspiring and incredible occasion for everyone. \u201cIt\u2019s a crucial tournament in the build-up to [the] 2025 [World Cup] and I cannot wait to be back with the group.\u201d The RFU performance director, Conor O\u2019Shea, said: \u201cI know how motivated Simon is to finish his time with the Red Roses on a high with a successful Women\u2019s Six Nations campaign. \u201cHe has achieved more than most coaches ever do, but it\u2019s the manner he has conducted himself as a person and his commitment to making the Red Roses the best they can be that stands out above the wins and the awards. \u201cWe have been working on our coach succession planning processes over the past 18 months and we will initiate that immediately with a view to announcing Simon\u2019s replacement after this year\u2019s Six Nations.\u201d"

                    "body": "The truth is Romelu Lukaku probably should have departed the pitch cradling the match ball but the painful reality is the striker left empty-handed, his hat-trick of second-half misses condemning Belgium to a damning and premature World Cup exit. The worst one of the lot came deep into stoppage time. Thorgan Hazard crossed from the right and an unmarked Lukaku made a beeline for the six-yard box but instead of converting from close range the ball bumbled off of his chest and into the arms of the Croatia goalkeeper Dominik Livakovic.\nThierry Henry, one of Roberto Mart\u00ednez\u2019s assistants, covered his eyes with his tracksuit top. Thomas Meunier chucked a water bottle into the ground. Yannick Carrasco threw a towel over his face. At the final whistle, Lukaku punched through the casing of the Belgium dugout in pure rage before being consoled by Youri Tielemans.\n\nCue the jokes about Lukaku finally hitting the target. Toby Alderweireld, one of those who surely will not return to this stage, lay on the turf. In the stands a very much on-brand Belgium supporter dressed, naturally, as a bright yellow cone of chips stood hands in pockets in disbelief.\nSome fans earlier jeered the arrival of Eden Hazard who entered from the substitutes\u2019 bench for the final seven minutes. For Belgium\u2019s golden generation, this last hurrah fell so painfully flat and afterwards Mart\u00ednez confirmed this unedifying exit would represent his last game in charge. \u201cI can\u2019t carry on,\u201d he said. Croatia, runners-up four years ago, go through to play the winners of Group E in the last 16.\nIn mitigation, Lukaku, who also cannoned a shot against a post, arrived in Qatar on the back of two substitute appearances since August. Perhaps it was no surprise the Internazionale striker was rusty. Not that it makes the circumstances surrounding Belgium\u2019s deeply underwhelming tournament any easier to explain.\nAt the outset Kevin De Bruyne had dismissed his side\u2019s chances of lifting the trophy and in recent days Belgium had to play down talk of rifts after Eden Hazard criticised the sluggish makeup of an ageing defence. The sight of Mart\u00ednez wildly protesting to the fourth official about the failure to award a free-kick for a back-pass after the ball went to the keeper off the impressive Josko Gvardiol epitomised the frustrations.\n\nThat a Mexican wave rippled around this ground on 41 minutes as Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen tossed the ball from side to side spoke volumes of the entertainment on offer in a first half where the only drama was a VAR review that led the referee, Anthony Taylor, to revoke the award of a Croatia penalty.\n\nVertonghen headed a free-kick clear from the edge of the six-yard box but when Carrasco failed to trap the ball he proceeded to foul Andrej Kramaric, prompting Taylor to point to the spot. Luka Modric grabbed the ball and Croatia\u2019s substitutes lined the edge of the technical area in anticipation \u2013 if not expectation \u2013 but then Taylor visited the pitchside VAR monitor, which detailed Dejan Lovren was offside when challenging Vertonghen inside the box. The big screens at either end showing AI-technology replays emphasised the tightness of the call.\nAt 35 Vertonghen was the oldest player in a starting lineup with the eldest average age at a World Cup since Australia\u2019s against Germany in 2010. Mart\u00ednez\u2019s big call was to demote Eden Hazard to the bench, with the Real Madrid forward among four players dropped after the defeat to Morocco. Dries Mertens and Leandro Trossard made their first starts of the tournament. At almost 27 the Leicester full-back Timothy Castagne was the puppy of the side.\n\nBelgium made a shaky start \u2013 Ivan Perisic curled a shot wide inside 11 seconds after being released by Modric and a minute later Leander Dendoncker was chasing a red-and-white chequered Croatia shirt facing his own goal. While they roused, Mart\u00ednez changed personnel and system at half-time, Lukaku coming on the trigger for a switch to a 3-4-3.\nLukaku\u2019s presence gave Croatia something to think about and Gvardiol panicked and stuck out his left leg at the front post to prevent De Bruyne\u2019s cross from reaching the lurking striker. A minute later Lukaku sent a tame header at Livakovic from a De Bruyne cross. Then he sent a header over from another De Bruyne cross, although the offside flag would have ensured any celebrations were short\u2011lived.\nBut as this game, which burst into life in the second half, ticked towards the hour mark Belgium stitched together a slick move, from which they will wonder how they did not prosper. Particularly Lukaku. De Bruyne angled a wonderful pass, as if by subterfuge, into Carrasco, whose fine first touch allowed him to tiptoe between two Croatia defenders and mosey towards goal.\nCarrasco seemed to do everything right but his shot was blocked by the boot of the outstretched Josip Juranovic, who darted in front of Livakovic in desperation. The ball then spiralled invitingly across the box for Lukaku but he could only send a rasping strike against Livakovic\u2019s left post. The maddening thing for Lukaku and Belgium was that worse \u2013 much worse \u2013 was still to come."

                    "body": "  12.21pm    Here\u2019s Jonathan Wilson\u2019s match report from the Al Janoub Stadium.       12.12pm    That Aboubakar goal a triumph for the semi-automated VAR tech. Hurrah! (It was a beautiful finish.)      12.09pm    The permutations are highly complicated for this group. It all goes down to Friday, though if either Switzerland or Brazil win later today they will qualify.   Updated at 12.19pm GMT    12.04pm   Full-time: Cameroon 3-3 Serbia  The players hit the floor after a classic intercontinental encounter. It looked to be Serbia\u2019s game but then Vincent Aboubakar changed things, with that brilliant, impudent goal and then the assist for Eric Choupo-Moting. Serbia will rue the misses from Aleksandar Mitrovic, who looks desperately disappointed. Both teams need a win from their next match, with Brazil next up for Cameroon, and Switzerland a tall-ish order for Serbia.      12.01pm    90+6 min: Cameroon have another free-kick, but it\u2019s cleared. One last chance? No, it\u2019s shepherded to safety and that\u2019s that.      12.00pm    90+5 min: Grujic tries a snap shot for Serbia. Epassy is not caught out this time.      11.59am    90+4 min: Nkoudou, the Tottenham legend and icon, win a free-kick in a dangerous position. He takes it himself and blams it straight into the grateful arms of the Serbian keeper.      11.58am    90+3 min: Rigobert Song roars on his men. We are told by ITV\u2019s Seb Hutchinson that 43 percent of goals in the 10am kickoffs have come in this match.      11.57am    90+1 min: Epassy makes a good save from Mitrovic, and with his chin. It was probably offside but all good for confidence with Brazil coming next.      11.55am    90 min: How much bonus soccer will we receive? Just six minutes? Fifa, you swines.      11.53am    89 min: Mitrovic is set up by Tadic, but can only drag wide. Chances at both ends. That\u2019s the way we like it.      11.53am    88 min: Kostic\u2026oof. The ball spins into his path and yet he is running too fast to keep control. It\u2019s that type of game.      11.52am    86 min: Choupo-Moting sends the brilliant Aboubakar speeding away, down the left rather than right. He can\u2019t beat Vanja Milinkovic-Savic from there. But what danger he has created.      11.50am    85 min: Bassogog causing problems now, and Serbia seem satisfied with sitting back. They are looking to the counter and the speed of Kostic.      11.49am    83 min: A female Cameroon fan is shown praying. For a win, presumably. Or ten minutes of time added on.      11.48am    81 min: Zambo-Anguissa and Mbeumo are off now. Cameroon pushing on, and they have Brazil in mind. Nkoudou and Bassogog are paired up front, and Serbia chose to bring on defensive players. They are eyeing Switzerland in their final game.      11.45am    80 min: Vanja Milinkovic-Savic kicks clear under pressure. And Cameroon press the ball back up again.      11.43am    78 min: Sergej Milinkovic-Savic has a chance to shoot..but wide\u2026. Three Serbian subs: Marko Grujic on for Sergej Milinkovic-Savic is one of them. No sign of Vlahovic as yet.      11.41am    77 min: And yet Serbia could have stolen it, only for Mitrovic to delay his shot, one-on-one with Epassy, giving him the chance to do so.      11.40am    75 min: Cameroon really going for it now. Their tradition of attacking football in full flight, they used to be so exciting, their Olympic win at Sydney 2000 comes to mind.      11.39am    73 min: Aboubakar who has been the key player in this match, is getting heated. He probably won\u2019t win the Fifa MOM award as he plays for Al Nassr, though as captain, he may have a good chance. He\u2019s been brilliant.   Updated at 11.55am GMT    11.37am    72 min: Both teams defending desperately, getting in the spirit of chaos. The Cameroon fans making all kind of noise.      11.35am    70 min: Serbia get a corner, and it gives them time to think. Tadic\u2019s corner is cleared, only for Epassy to look panicky, only for Choupo-Moting to take up the cudgels and whack it away.   Updated at 11.57am GMT    11.34am    69 min: Richard Stead in the stadium: \u201cCracking match this. Serbian fans stunned by that. It looked a mile offside from where I\u2019m sitting!\u201d     11.33am    68 min: We have a classic on our hands here.      11.33am    66 min: There were 150 seconds between the Serbia goals in the first half, and then there were 150 seconds between the Cameroon goals. It\u2019s a funny old game, Saint.      11.32am   Goal! Cameroon 3-3 Serbia (Choupo-Moting, 64)  Aboubakar again! He spins out wide right, they have no answer to his pace and he slots the ball inside and Choupo-Moting slots in! What an impact. No offside, and it\u2019s Serbia\u2019s turn to rage at each other.    Updated at 11.53am GMT    11.30am   Goal! Cameroon 2-3 Serbia (Aboubakar, 64)  There was a VAR delay, it took it\u2019s time but the automated offside does him a solid. He seemed to think he was offside, and thus scooped the ball over Milinkovic-Savic in the Serbian goal. It was quite a finish, hit when he thought he was offside. He\u2019s made quite an impact, has Aboubakar.    Updated at 11.49am GMT    11.28am    63 min: Chaos in the Cameroon defence. N\u2019Koulou loses it in the son, and Mitrovic can only lob it into the sidenetting.      11.27am    61 min: Are Cameroon done? Not if you are Aboubakar, who goes on a mazy run, sending a couple of Serbs skidding. He looks to be fancying a Saeed Al-Owairan 1994 effort but then gets blocked off. Cameroon relying on individual moments rather than the fluidity of the Serbians.      11.24am    59 min: Matthew Lysaght gets in touch: \u201cCould it be fair to say that Cameroon checked out of this World Cup not long after the start of their game against Switzerland?\u201d They\u2019re still in this, for now.  Luke Justus: \u201cI think if players go down holding their face, the ref should have to summon the physio and the player should then have to leave the field as they received treatment. Not allowed back on for the next phase of play. See how long it lasts then.\u201d James Dixon: \u201cI agree with Mr Campbell entirely. Exaggerating the pain from minimal contact is bad enough, but holding your face/head when the whole world\u2019s just clearly seen the guy lightly brush your left pectoral in 4K, super slo-mo is beyond ridiculous. More seriously, if football/FIFA are serious about dealing better with head injuries etc, a good first step would be to punish those who pretend to have them when it\u2019s obviously, demonstrably not the case. \u201c     11.22am    57 min: Close for Cameroon! Choupo-Moting nods wide from Mbeumo\u2019s cross. They need to find a way back in and fast.      11.21am    56 min: Serbia make a change, and Pavlovic, the scorer, has a groin problem. On comes another Mitrovic, Stefan.      11.20am    55 min: The Cameroon players are arguing among themselves now. A first sub is made, and Hongla, one of those arguing, is replaced by Aboubakar     11.19am   Goal! Cameroon 1-3 Serbia (Mitrovic, 53)  Oh that\u2019s a beauty. Serbia pass Cameroon to death, and do look to have overplayed. Tadic and Sergej Milinkovic-Savic play patiently, and Epassy isolated, Mitrovic just needs to pass the ball in.    Updated at 12.06pm GMT    11.17am    51 min: Cameroon having to do most of the defending, as Tadic flicks the ball on to Mitrovic. Then Mbeumo speeds on, only for Milenkovic to clatter him. We are not far off some retaliation for one of these challenges sparking something up.      11.15am    49 min: Call for handball in Cameroon\u2019s box from Sergej Milinkovic-Savic\u2019s shot but it needs to hit the hand to be a handball.      11.13am    48 min: Zambo-Anguissa dishes out some residual pain to Kostic. Choupo-Moting puts in a sonic reducer on Sergej Milinkovic-Savic. There\u2019s a small chance this game turns out to be the Battle of The Al Janoub.      11.11am    47 min: Not much love lost here, and those overcelebrations were a big part of the needle on show.      11.10am    46 min: We are back underway, and Zambo-Anguissa is still out there, presumably patched up. On the touchline, Rigobert Song glowers under his trademark baseball cap.      11.09am    Both teams celebrated goals with their subs running out to join the party. And both teams had subs booked for joining the celebrations.      11.01am    Sam Campbell: \u201cI know most people aren\u2019t fans of VAR but while we have it why can\u2019t they use it to punish players going down holding their faces for no reason. Proper old man shouting at clouds from me but it really winds me up.\u201d  Updated at 11.04am GMT    11.00am    Richard Hirst on Zambo-Anguissa, who it would be a shock to come out for the second half. There were two minutes and 30 seconds between two goals his physical condition played a part in. \u201cAnguissa was much better when he came back to us after his first spell on loan, but still not the player he was before and is now with Napoli. Not getting the best of him and Seri was a major part of our Premier League downfall that season.\u201d     10.59am    The word on Onana is that he has been BANISHED from the Cameroon squad altogether, and was not part of that celebration for the Castelletto goal. In fact, despite Big Samuel Eto\u2019o stepping in, Rigobert Song has had enough. Classic World Cup bustup stuff.      10.55am   Half-time: Cameroon 1-2 Serbia  What a game so far, full of incident, and let\u2019s be honest, some very odd defending. Cameroon looked to have made it to half-time, only for them to go to sleep at a free-kick, and then do much the same for a quickfire Serbia second. The last of the 10am kick-offs has not followed the 0-0 at half-time template. Not at all.      10.53am    45+6 min: Cameroon are gone here, they are desperate for half-time. This time, Epassy saves them, as Mitrovic\u2019s shot is smuggled off for a corner. Serbia want a third. The corner that comes next causes all kinds of trouble before, at the other end, Vanja Milinkovic-Savic, the goalie, comes out to play sweeper in the style Onana likes, though gets in launched in a style Rigobert Song would approve of. And that\u2019s the last of it.     10.51am   Goal! Cameroon 1-2 Serbia (Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, 45+3 )  Cameroon rocking, and Serbia take full advantage. They fail to clear their lines, Zambo again a guilty party and Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, with a not especially well-hit shot, scores. Epassy culpable? There\u2019s a narrative.     Updated at 12.07pm GMT    10.48am   Goal! Cameroon 1-1 Serbia (Pavlovic 45+1)  Tadic, the wizard, lays it on a plate, and Zambo perhaps still in pain, fails to jump and the header rockets in.   Updated at 10.53am GMT    10.46am    45 min: Six minutes added on\u2026of course.      10.45am    43 min: Lukic loses the ball to Kunde and Cameroon suddenly have acres of space, and has chance to shoot at Vanja Milinkovic-Savic, but his shot is low, and saved. The rebound falls his way but excitement gets the better of him. Both chances were more than decent for Cameroon. Serbia keep leaving the back door open.      10.42am    41 min: Cameroon having to go through the last-ditch stuff, as Tadic weaves Lukic to the byline but the ball deflects back out.      10.40am    39 min: Mitrovic is the target for a ball whacked to the back stick but it\u2019s cleared and then Tadic smashes over, rather uncharacteristically.      10.39am    38 min: Serbia have badly lost concentration and it call came from that slack pass off for a corner. They try to find a way back, Tadic, as ever, at the centre of matters, but Cameroon are back in numbers.      10.38am    36 min: Andr\u00e9-Frank Zambo Anguissa, the Napoli player, a revelation there, especially to those who remember him at Fulham, has an injury. He soldiers on, but looks to be playing through the pain barrier. His club coach Luciano Spalletti must be looking on in agony.      10.35am    34 min: All credit, too, to N\u2019Koulou for his adept flick for the Cameroon goal.      10.34am    32 min: Talking of keepers, Epassy almost fumbles the ball then holds it as Mitrovic lurks with intent.      10.33am    30 min: It came against the run of play, though it was well-worked, and Serbia paid for being so lax. Every Cameroon squad member came on to celebrate. Though was Onana one of them?       10.30am   Goal! Cameroon 1-0 Serbia (Castelletto, 29)  Rigobert Song looks even more disgruntled on the sidelines but his team get an unforced corner from Serbia. And opportunity knocks! The ball is headed back across goal and Castelletto knocks in, reading the flight of the ball, staying onside and poking in! Serbia went to sleep!    Updated at 10.36am GMT    10.28am    27 min: Still no real pattern of play but Serbia look more likely. Tadic lays the ball centrally to Mitrovic who swings and misses.      10.26am    25 min: Yellow card for N\u2019Koulou for a facepalm on Zivkovic. It looked a bit soft, accidental. Serbia make nothing of the free-kick when Tadic smashes it over everyone.      10.24am    23 min: Permanent Manchester United target Sergej Milinkovic-Savic is fouled in midfield. He was always seen as an alternative to Paul Pogba.      10.23am    20 min: Serbia get the corner clear when Kunde again has a dig from distance. Cameroon are pressing high now, which may open space up elsewhere, and almost does as Serbia go down the other end and force a corner. The ref meanwhile seems to have lost his headset and armband.  Here\u2019s your team for today by the way. And you\u2019d need a minibus for this lot.   Referee: Mohammed Abdulla Hassan (UAE) Assistant Referee 1: Mohamed Al-Hammadi (UAE) Assistant Referee 2: Hasan Al-Mahri (UAE) Fourth Official: Ma Ning (CHN)Reserve Assistant Referee: Shi Xiang (CHN) Video Assistant Referee: Nicolas Gallo (COL) Assistant Video Assistant Referee: Juan Soto (VEN) Offside Video Assistant Referee: Ezequiel Brailovsky (ARG) Support Video Assistant Referee: Leodan Gonzalez (URU) Standby Assistant Video Assistant Referee: Gabriel Chade (ARG)      10.20am    19 min: Mbeumo whips the ball across goal and that was begging to be hit. And yet nobody there. Then Milinkovic-Savic is asked to make a save from Kunde. Chances at both ends? More, please.      10.18am    17 min: Chance for Mitrovic! Cameroon get in a tangle, failing to clear a ball from the byline, the ball sits up for him and the big man scuffs wide. Oof.      10.17am    16 min: N\u2019Koulou sees glory from long range but ends up blamming the ball into the Bud Zero concession at the back of the stand.      10.16am    15 min: No pattern of play to speak of here. Not much play to speak of. It\u2019s been a typical Qatar 2022 first half so far. Hongla makes his belated return to the field.      10.15am    14 min: Few bumps and bruises out there, players going down all over the show but the heat probably doesn\u2019t speed their getting back up.      10.14am    12 min: Hongla goes down, felled by Kostic, the Juventus man, such a good player for Eintracht Frankfurt. Rigobert Song looks worried. And somehow cool, though he always looks cool. Hongla leaves the field to receive treatment.      10.12am    10 min: There\u2019s a bit of afters over a throw-in, and a bit of needle creeping in\u2026oh, here\u2019s Mitrovic, cutting inside, sending Tolo sliding off, and then crashing the ball off the post on the opposite side. That\u2019s what he can do, that mix of silk and steel.      10.10am    8 min: If you are interested in such things, both teams are playing a variation of 4-3-3, though Mitrovic is playing for further forward in the formation than opposite number Choupo-Moting.      10.07am    6 min: First chance for Mitrovic, the ball crossed to him by Tadic, and he nods wide. He was probably a bit too far out to trouble the Cameroon goal.      10.06am    5 min: The first goalkeeper to wobble is not Epassy but Milinkovic-Savic, who makes a mess of pass out and plays it straight to Kunde. Cameroon can\u2019t profit, and Serbia break on the counter.      10.04am    3 min: From a spy in the stadium, the BBC Radio Manchester reporter Richard Stead: \u201cI\u2019m in a seat in the baking sunshine. Air conditioning under the seat is just making it bearable!\u201d  Updated at 10.05am GMT    10.03am    2 min: Mitrovic is back on, for now. Good news for Fulham, unless he makes it worse by playing on.      10.02am    1 min: And away we go\u2026, with sun beaming down on the Serbian goal, and now Mitrovic has taken a nasty fall in leaping for the ball. His ankle looked to take the brunt, after he smashed into Hongla. He limps off but is at least able to walk off.   Updated at 10.08am GMT    9.58am    Here\u2019s the anthems, Cameroon going first, before Serbia in a stadium claimed by the authorities to be carbon-neutral by being offset. Though does that include the aircon cooling down the pitch?    Updated at 10.14am GMT    9.51am    With Onana out, all eyes on Devis Epassy, Saudi Pro League club Abha. From the Guardian\u2019s World Cup Player Interactive:  Born in France, Epassy started his career in Rennes\u2019 youth ranks in 2012, and has been on the move since, playing in France, Greece, Spain and, since August, in Saudi Arabia. His international chance has come relatively late in his career: Cameroon\u2019s then goalkeeping coach Jacques Celestin Songo\u2019o approached him two years ago, and he won his first call-up in June 2021. He was solid in his debut \u2013 a 0-0 draw with Nigeria \u2013 and looks to have secured his spot as Andr\u00e9 Onana\u2019s deputy, having impressed when covering for him during Onana\u2019s ban. He was part of the squad for the last Africa Cup of Nations, and in his five caps before arriving in Qatar had kept three clean sheets. A very capable understudy.       9.33am    Important reporting from Paul MacInnes.   It may seem an observation that ought not to have to be made, but the Saudi fanbase in Qatar is made up of both men and women. At Education City on Saturday afternoon, perhaps one in 20 of those making their way into the stadium were female, making them equivalent to the number of women there to support Poland. This is a first. Three years ago, as part of a series of reforms, a decree from the Saudi royal family announced that women would be allowed to leave the country without first acquiring the consent of their male guardian. The guardianship system remains, and applies to every woman throughout their lives, with the role of guardian transferring from father to husband. But it does not apply in as many aspects as it once did \u2013 which means that going to this neighbouring World Cup, for a country that is demonstrably football mad, is now possible for everyone.       9.28am    Fabrizio Romano has an inside track on Andre Onana\u2019s rather sensational removal from the Cameroon team.       9.26am    It\u2019s nothing to do with a Michael Crawford revival. Or Steve Harley.       9.20am    K\u00e1ri Tulinius gets in touch:\u201d One theme of this World Cup so far is good teams without top class strikers. So it\u2019ll be fascinating to see whether Choupo-Moting or Mitrovi\u0107 step up. Of course, neither is exactly a dependable goalscorer, but the former did net a crucial goal against Algeria in the playoff which took the tie into extra time, and the latter has a half-century of goals in 77 matches for Serbia.\u201d     9.17am    On Friday, the Football Federation of Kosovo (FFK) submitted a complaint to Fifa, football\u2019s world governing body, over Serbia\u2019s \u201cchauvinistic rhetoric\u201d with the flag seen hanging in their dressing room after the defeat by Brazil.  \u201cSuch acts of chauvinism have no place in a sports event, and even less inside the facilities where the biggest event of world football takes place, therefore FFK, as an equal member with all other members of Fifa, demands from this institution to undertake sanctioning measures against actions that incite hatred between peoples and are against human values.\u201d \u201cIt is unacceptable for this act to pass in silence, therefore we strongly request that Fifa strictly implement its rules and punish the football federation of Serbia for this aggressive action and against the values \u200b\u200bthat football conveys.\u201d Fifa has opened disciplinary proceedings against Serbia\u2019s football association.      9.12am    First look at those teams and it\u2019s clear Dusan Vlahovic, one of the best strikers in Serie A, is not fit enough to play the 90 minutes. He\u2019s still nursing a groin problem picked up playing for Juventus. Wing back Filip Kostic was named in the starting side after missing the opening game with a muscle problem. Cameroon coach have made two changes to the team who lost 1-0 to Switzerland, replacing keeper Andre Onana with Devis Epassy and midfielder Samuel Oum Gouet with Pierre Kunde.  The word on Onana, a big-name player for Cameroon but who has had a troubled time recently, that he\u2019s been dropped for disciplinary reasons.      9.05am   Here's the teams  Cameroon: Epassy, Fai, Castelletto, N\u2019Koulou, Tolo, Zambo, Kunde, Hongla, Mbeumo, Choupo-Moting, Toko Ekambi. Subs: Ngapandouetnbu, Mbekeli, Wooh, Ondoua, Ngamaleu, Nkoudou, Nsame, Aboubakar, Bassogog, Gouet, Mbaizo, Ntcham, Ebosse, Marou. Serbia: Vanja Milinkovic-Savic, Milenkovic, Veljkovic, Pavlovic, Zivkovic, Lukic, Maksimovic, Kostic, Tadic, Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, Aleksandar Mitrovic. Subs: Dmitrovic, Erakovic, Radonjic, Gudelj, Jovic, Rajkovic, Stefan Mitrovic, Babic, Vlahovic, Racic, Djuricic, Lazovic, Ilic, Mladenovic, Grujic.     8.53am    Jonathan Liew aims his intellectual eye at the experience of \u2018being there\u2019 in the stadia.   One can sense this from the moment one climbs the steps and emerges into the arena itself, which at this tournament feels less like entering a sporting venue and more like beaming through a portal. Loud, pumping, wall-to-wall music fills every conceivable space and orifice. The tunes stop a few seconds before the game begins and kicks in a second after the whistle blows. On the big screens, adverts for crypto\u2011trading compete for attention with the booming, rib\u2011juddering din of the official pitchside announcer, jabbering away like a circus ringmaster.       8.51am    Here\u2019s today\u2019s World Cup briefing, including a mini-preview of this match.   Both teams must recover from opening defeats and find their first goals of the tournament. Since the glory of their run to the quarter-finals in 1990, Cameroon have not made it out of the group stages while Serbia have never reached the knockouts. Will Dragan Stojkovic play both his star forwards in Dusan Vlahovic and Aleksandar Mitrovic? They spent just 17 second-half minutes together as Brazil ran away with the game in Serbia\u2019s opener. Rigobert Song, the Cameroon coach whose tracksuits have made him a cult hero, must find a way to get service to Eric Choupo-Moting and Bryan Mbeumo in attack. JB       8.40am    The Serbian coach, the legendary Dragan Stojkovic, also spoke ahead of the game.   We knew the first match with Brazil would be very difficult given that we had personnel problems with injury to some of the key players for us, so this World Cup for Serbia began after the match with Brazil. It\u2019s an important match against Cameroon given that both them and ourselves have started with a defeat, but that does not diminish our ambitions and objectives for what we wish to achieve and what we expect.      8.38am    Some Cameroon news ahead of the teams. It seems Samuel Eto\u2019o, who happens to be president of the Cameroon FA has put them under pressure by predicting they would reach the final \u2013 against Morocco - and that\u2019s not to the taste of Rigobert Song, the national coach, who has had to deny a rift with his former teammate.   I would say sometimes he even wants to put on the jersey and get out on the pitch to play, because he wants to give everything. But that is not why my players didn\u2019t score against Switzerland. The president is a gentleman who is very supportive. He was a footballer himself, he lives, breathes and dreams football, but he does not put any burden or stress on our shoulders, no. The president is someone who is easy to talk to, he is open and we communicate a lot.  \u201cIt will be a decisive game and we are well prepared. I think you will see a different side to this Cameroon side and we will silence our critics.      8.30am   Preamble  After just over a week of football in the Richard &amp; Judy slot, this is the last of the list of matches to chew over with your morning coffee and crossword, not to get all John Motson Japan/Korea 2002 and overuse the breakfast metaphors. But it signals the final day of the second group round of first-round group stages, if you follow that. After their first match, both of these teams really need a win, having lost their openers. Cameroon lost 1-0 to Switzerland, a game notable for the winner being scored by a Cameroon-born lad in Breel Embolo, who delivered a first-rate issue of the non-celebration celebration and STILL got a volley of abuse from the social media trolls. Serbia were meanwhile on the end of Brazil\u2019s coming out party, and having acquitted themselves well enough in defence, stopping Neymar in particular, tired and were on the end of Richarlison\u2019s double. Win at all costs for both? Not quite, since Brazil are probably expected to beat Switzerland, and that means Serbia can draw this and then hope to beat the Swiss. Cameroon meanwhile could really do with winning this as they have Brazil last of all. Both teams lacked a cutting edge in their opening matches, despite quality attackers in Dusan Tadic and Aleksandar Mitrovic for Serbia and Eric Choupo-Moting and Bryan Mbeumo. It\u2019s been a tight tourney so far in terms of goals, only Spain and England have smashed them in, only to lose that scoring touch in the next game. This feels like it should be \u2013 and will be \u2013 a tight affair but here\u2019s hoping for a morning classic.  Kick-off is 10am UK time, 1pm Mecca/Qatar time. Join me.   "

                    "body": " It is hard to imagine a place more different to Qatar than the southern plains of Nepal. Miles of fields covered in dazzling yellow mustard flowers are dotted with small villages. Cows and goats sit in front of houses mostly made of woven strips of bamboo and mud. Clothes are washed by hand, water pumped by foot and rice husks sifted by the wind. A day\u2019s work in the fields pays 300 to 400 rupees (\u00a31.90 to \u00a32.50) plus a plate of food. The dowry system, though illegal, is widespread, forcing already poor families to take desperate measures to find the money: about 600,000 rupees (\u00a33,755) for each daughter. Gangaram Mandal and his wife, Laduwati, had seven daughters. In 2018, faced with the almost impossible task of paying a dowry for them all, along with the daily struggle of finding enough food, Gangaram had little choice but to leave his home in the district of Saptari and go in search of work.  Already in debt, he borrowed more money to pay the extortionate recruitment fee to find work in Qatar, and once there most of his paltry salary \u2013 the equivalent of 80 pence an hour \u2013 went towards the dowries of three of his daughters. He had been there for two years when, at the end of a shift in the searing heat of the summer, he began to vomit and feel faint. Back at his labour camp he went to lie down and never woke up. According to his death certificate, he died of \u201cHeart failure natural causes\u201d.  His death sent his family into a spiral of debt, poverty and torment. \u201cHow can I feed my children? There\u2019s nothing to eat. And if I feed them, how can I pay for their education? How can I manage my daughters\u2019 dowries?\u201d says Laduwati, sitting outside her home. One of her daughters, Baby Kumari, crouches sobbing beside her. \u201cMy dad used to say don\u2019t cry. I\u2019ll come home and give you whatever you want,\u201d she says. \u201cBut now he\u2019s dead and there\u2019s no one I can turn to. Who can I call dad?\u201d Laduwati says she has never heard from her husband\u2019s company and, like thousands of other families whose loved ones die in Qatar, did not receive any compensation from his employer. All she got was the wages he was owed, and 175,000 rupees (\u00a31,100) from his co-workers, who chipped in to help with funeral expenses.  Qatar\u2019s labour law only requires employers to pay compensation if a death occurs at work or directly because of the work, but this narrow definition and the vague categorisation of workers\u2019 deaths can result in companies avoiding accountability.  As in Gangaram\u2019s case, the majority of fatalities are classified as \u201cnatural deaths\u201d due to cardiac or respiratory failure, a term which gives no indication of the underlying cause. The cases often involve young men with no apparent health conditions.  Autopsies are rarely carried out in cases of natural death, and the Qatari government has yet to commission an independent study into deaths from cardiac arrest, despite a recommendation to do so from its own lawyers eight years ago. Without proper investigations into these deaths, many families may be losing out on compensation. In interviews with the families of seven workers whose deaths were attributed to natural causes, none had received compensation from the companies they worked for.  While most families \u2013 including Gangaram\u2019s \u2013 get compensation from valid personal insurance schemes they must buy in their home countries before departure, the payouts are relatively low.  In a recent report on occupational injuries in Qatar, the UN\u2019s International Labour Organization said: \u201cThere is a need to review the approach taken to investigating deaths of seemingly healthy young workers from \u2018natural causes\u2019, to be able to determine whether they are in fact work-related \u2026 to ensure workers\u2019 families receive due compensation.\u201d The deaths of workers who constructed Qatar\u2019s new World Cup stadiums \u2013 a tiny fraction of the overall migrant workforce \u2013 may offer a glimpse into what is happening on a bigger scale across the country.  Of the 40 recorded deaths of workers employed on World Cup stadium construction projects, 37 have been categorised as \u2018non-work-related\u2019 by the event\u2019s local organising committee. The figure includes workers who collapsed during their shift and died later in hospital, workers who died in a company bus accident and others who died in their labour camp, in some cases while asleep. Gangaram Mandal\u2019s case appears to fit the same pattern: a sudden death hours after the end of his shift.  The Guardian has documented two cases where the families of stadium workers whose deaths were recorded as non-work related were compensated. The organising committee did not respond to a question about whether any other families have been compensated, but said their contractors\u2019 insurance does not usually cover non-work-related deaths. \u201cIt was a very hot day and workers often vomit or faint in the bus. He was working inside a ditch so there was little fresh air and very high humidity. It could have played some role,\u201d says a source with knowledge of the case. A representative of the company which employed Gangaram says: \u201cWhy are you asking me about compensation? It was a natural death. It was not an accident. How can I give him money?\u201d Narad Nath Bharadwaj, a former Nepal ambassador to Qatar, believes workers should be insured with \u201c24-hour coverage\u201d so that families would get compensation if deaths occur outside the workplace. \u201cMost die on the transport between the labour camp and workplace but they\u2019re not covered for that,\u201d he says. But even in cases where a worker\u2019s death is the direct result of a workplace accident, the families of the deceased appear to struggle to gain compensation. In 2015, Suraj Bishwakarma, 24, was working as a steel fixer on a tower in Qatar when he died, allegedly by falling from a height. Neither the Nepal embassy nor his employer would respond to questions about the exact circumstances of his death.  His mother, Bishnu Maya, seems reluctant to stir up painful memories. \u201cNo one should have to suffer like me. It would have been better if I had died but the opposite happened. He died before me,\u201d she says.  That would have been the last Bishnu Maya ever heard from Qatar, except that Suraj\u2019s brother-in-law, Samser Bahadur Kami, also worked in the country and took up the case with the Nepal embassy. Showing remarkable tenacity, Samser says he made more than 100 visits over six years to the embassy \u2013 an hour\u2019s drive each way from his labour camp \u2013 to push for compensation. Suraj\u2019s family was eventually awarded compensation in late 2021. The Nepal embassy and the company that employed him and did not respond to requests for comment. Bishnu Maya is reluctant to say how much she received, but when compensation is given for workplace accidents, it is usually about \u00a340,000. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair. It should have been much more. Our troubles began after his death. No one can imagine my pain. Even if I get a piece of gold, it is nothing compared to my son,\u201d she says. It is a story repeated across Nepal. Shankar Yadav had worked on a number of high-profile projects in Qatar, including construction of the Doha Metro, a key transport link for the World Cup.  Last year, according to a co-worker, he was working as a scaffolder 11 storeys up on an unrelated project south of Doha. The scaffolding collapsed and he and three other workers fell to their deaths. \u201cThe scaffolding was not in good condition. It was all rusty,\u201d claims the co-worker.   The worker alleged that when police came to the site, the company quickly agreed to pay 50,000 Qatari rials \u2013 about \u00a310,000 \u2013 compensation to the families of each worker. It is unclear whether further compensation will be paid.  Before his death, Shankar\u2019s young wife, Sangita Kumari Yadav, says they used to talk for hours each night. \u201cWhenever I asked him about his work, he would say, \u2018The more you know, the more you will worry\u2019, so he didn\u2019t tell me much,\u201d she says. Shankar\u2019s parents are devastated. \u201cWhen my son was alive \u2013 whether or not he was earning \u2013 everything was fine, but I have so many problems now,\u201d says his mother, Asa Devi Yadav. In tears, she clutches Shankar\u2019s passport. \u201cOh my son,\u201d she says, \u201cWhere have you gone?\u201d  A spokesperson for the Qatar government said in a statement: \u201cCompanies in Qatar are legally required to compensate the families of all workers who lose their lives in a work-related incident. Immediately after a work-related fatality occurs \u2026 An investigation is carried out by the authorities to identify the cause of death \u2026 A final report is submitted to the legal authorities to determine the amount of compensation to be paid by the company to the family.\u201d The \u2018supreme committee\u2019 organising the World Cup in Qatar said in a statement that its commitment to the, \u201chealth, safety and dignity of all workers employed on our projects has remained steadfast and unwavering.\u201d \u201cOur commitment to workers\u2019 welfare has resulted in significant improvements in accommodation standards, health and safety regulations, grievance mechanisms, healthcare provision, and reimbursements of illegal recruitment fees to workers,\u201d the statement read.  Additional reporting by Muhammad Owasim Uddin Bhuyan in Dhaka.   Qatar deaths: when \u2018natural causes\u2019 means no payout Mohammad Kaochar Khan, Bangladesh Khan decided to migrate to Qatar to build a future for his young son. Initially it cost him \u00a32,800 in illegal recruitment fees; eventually it cost him his life. Khan died in his sleep in a labour camp in Doha in November 2017 after his shift as a construction worker. His death was recorded as, \u201cAcute respiratory failure due to natural causes\u201d. He was 34. Khan was employed by a major Qatari construction company whose projects include a number of hotels set to host fans during the World Cup. Khan\u2019s wife says she has not received any compensation from the company. Purna Bahadur Sonar, Nepal Sonar had worked as a security guard in Qatar for seven years without a break when, in April 2021, he went to bed in his labour camp and never woke up. His death was attributed to \u201cAcute heart failure due to natural causes\u201d. He was 28. His family are confused about the circumstances of his death. \u201cWhen I saw his dead body, I realised no postmortem had been done,\u201d says his brother Danak Sonar. He said they have received no compensation from Qatar. Nepali authorities also said they could not offer compensation as his contract had expired.

                    "body": "Iran\u2019s government is more involved than most in football \u2013 clubs are owned directly or indirectly by the state \u2013 but it keeps a closer eye than usual on the beloved national team at times of public unrest.  After the famous World Cup playoff win over Australia in 1997 the players were told to take their time coming home lest their presence push nationwide celebrations into something else.  The 2009 \u2018Green Movement\u2019 that sprang up to demonstrate against what was seen as a rigged presidential election led to a number of players wearing green armbands in a vital qualifier in Seoul. Within hours their pictures were being held up on the streets thousands of miles to the west. Protestors are back on Iran\u2019s streets after the death of Mahsa Amini in custody after she was arrested by the morality police on 13 September for \u201cunsuitable attire\u201d. If unrest continues, then any success at the World Cup, which is eight weeks away, may be viewed as a double-edged sword by authorities; and, if the latest international matches are anything to go by, then Iran are going to Qatar to be competitive against England, the USA and Wales who all lost. In the first game since Carlos Queiroz returned as head coach this month, Team Melli beat Uruguay 1-0 in Austria. Thanks to international isolation and sanctions, it is rare that Iran play such opposition in friendlies, but this only highlights that this is one of the country\u2019s best results in years. It is all the more impressive as it comes after months of chaos, infighting and interference. It started with being drawn with England and the USA. From Iran\u2019s point of view there could not have been two bigger and more symbolic opponents.  These are two nations with deep involvement in the modern history of one of the world\u2019s oldest civilisations and which are held responsible for the 1953 coup that overthrew the democratically elected prime minister, Mohammad Mosaddegh. They are two nations that are still seen as being behind many of the problems that the country, beset by sanctions internationally and unrest at home, is facing and two national teams that present formidable opposition for one that had never progressed from the group stage in five World Cup appearances. After the draw, however, with the group rivals all having homegrown managers, there were whispers that Iran should, for such symbolic games, have an Iranian coach. Yet it was a Croatian, Dragan Skocic who took over in February 2020 and led the team through qualification with 15 wins in 18 games. On 9 July Iran\u2019s volleyball team defeated Serbia in the Men\u2019s Nations League. The following day a social media account of Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, reposted an old entry with a new title saying it was good to have success with an Iranian coach. While it was later denied that this was expressing any opinion about what should happen with Team Melli, on 11 July Skocic was fired even though it seemed there were not enough board members around to sign the official document confirming his release. Reaction to the decision was mixed and even those not enamoured of Skocic felt he had been treated poorly. Ali Daei was the frontrunner but quickly ruled himself out and other candidates did not set pulses racing. Skocic was back in the job within a week but it was impossible to pretend that nothing had happened. The team was as split as public opinion. The striker Mehdi Taremi had an earlier falling out with the coach and led the contingent who wanted a change. It was even claimed that the Porto star and some teammates had met Iran\u2019s minister of sports. Bayer Leverkusen\u2019s Sardar Azmoun was the highest-profile backer of Skocic. It was always going to be decided one way or the other at the end of August with the election of a new federation president. Mehdi Taj, who had been the president from 2016-19 and had worked with Queiroz, said openly he would consider bringing the former Real Madrid head coach back if he won. Due to a lack of domestic options Queiroz was seen as the next best thing; available and cheap, high-profile, familiar with the players and the politics and more than capable of setting a team up to ensure there would be no World Cup embarrassments. Skocic had earlier blamed \u201cvarious interests\u201d for trying to create tensions in the team but this time stayed quiet and focused on staying and securing his payout (sources have suggested that he allowed this to be set too low, making his dismissal fairly cheap). His supporters suggest there is some irony in a coach who successfully steered his team through qualification for the World Cup being replaced by one who failed with both Colombia and Egypt. That will not bother Queiroz, a coach not averse to conflict and controversy. It was as if he had never left against Uruguay. Whatever the divisions in recent weeks, there did not seem to be a problem with team spirit and Iran worked hard to frustrate the South Americans, snatching a late win. Taremi\u2019s goal was a fine finish to a flowing move. There are bigger issues at play right now in this football-loving country but after months of chaos it could be that Team Melli have stumbled upon the right formula, even if it is a short-term one. At the very least Iran sent a message to the rest of Group B, not least to their first opponents, England. "

                    "body": "With 44 minutes gone at the vast, craning, wildly over-engineered Al Janoub Stadium, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 did something extraordinary, perhaps even unique in modern World Cup history. Basically, he missed an open goal from six yards out. No great shakes. It happens. Ball, bounce, angles, collisions.\nThis is still a kind of physical chaos.\nMbapp\u00e9\u2019s miss was different, however. He didn\u2019t snatch or shin or prod at it. The problem wasn\u2019t overstretching or leaning back. The punditry staples will not do here. Mbapp\u00e9 missed an open goal arrogantly. The problem was, meeting Antoine Griezmann\u2019s cross at full stretch, with the game against Australia there to be guillotined out of existence, Mbapp\u00e9 was just too arrogant to score.\nHe was insouciant. He was super-chilled. Sliding cinematically on to the arc of the ball, he basically tried to score twice, to zing the net, to bulge and billow the net, to create the moment, the freeze frame, the montage gold. Instead he smashed it over the bar.\n\nMbapp\u00e9, smiled, shook his head and sprung up out of the back of the net.\nThat\u2019s football. Sometimes it\u2019s a toe, a shin, a scuff. Sometimes, sometimes, you\u2019re just too arrogant to score. The key is to go again, to come back and be arrogant in exactly the same place time and again.\nThe score was 2-1 at the time. Australia hit the post two minutes later. But the fact is France were simply running through them at that stage, Mbapp\u00e9 barely leaving a dent in the lime green turf, a man moving through lighter air and often gravity, and en route to a 4-1 win for France that really might have been anything.\nWelcome to the Mbapp\u00e9\u2011verse, and an occasion that felt remarkable even in this remarkable sporting life. It can be hard to keep up with the many layers of the Mbapp\u00e9 identity at this World Cup. Mbapp\u00e9 is France\u2019s key creative hope. Mbapp\u00e9 is a paid employee of the state of Qatar. Mbapp\u00e9 does Doha billboards. Mbapp\u00e9 wants to leave Paris. Mbapp\u00e9 is the best footballer on the planet.\n\nPlus he has an energy these days unlike any other athlete. This is not so much a footballer now as a blue-chip athletic commodity, to be traded and hoarded and displayed like a private Picasso. Currencies quiver, exchange rates shift at his every twitch and yawn. Talk of his unhappiness at PSG has already set the hares running.\nEven this is novel. This kind of lovely, gossamer, hyper\u2011engineered footballer was seen in the past as a butterfly broken on wheel, delicate objects for football to exploit and stretch thin. Mbapp\u00e9 is a butterfly, a jaw-droppingly lovely footballer. But he is also, to an unprecedented degree, a power-player in this world, a broker of his own talent. Mbapp\u00e9 is the wheel.\nAnd of course, because he\u2019s brilliant, razor sharp, and pretty much unstoppable one on one, he did score here, heading in Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019s cross early in the second half to make it 3-1.\n\nIt seems significant too that it was Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s initial cross that sparked the move, because Mbapp\u00e9 also never stopped moving, working, running, brain whirring, engaged at every moment in trying to win this game. Five minutes later he set up the fourth, crossing for Olivier Giroud to head his second and his 51st goal for France.\nThere had been much talk before this tournament of the players France are missing. In the absence of the Ballon d\u2019Or incumbent Didier Deschamps went with a front three of Mbapp\u00e9, Dembele and of course the stately and hugely reassuring Giroud, the grand old belle epoque mahogany sideboard of international football. Giroud is a different kind of marvel, still that same bespoke mix of rumbling physical splendour and something oddly diffident in his persona 15 years into an elite career.\nAnd who knows how good France might be when this tournament starts to narrow. The defence looked shaky here at first. They went behind in the game, Craig Goodwin finishing expertly after Lucas Hernandez twisted his knee as he turned to block Mathew Leckie\u2019s neat little catch and turn.\nIt took France 17 minutes to equalise, Adrien Rabiot nodded in a fine deep cross from the substitute Theo Hernandez. And by now Mbapp\u00e9 was gliding past Nathaniel Atkinson with alarming ease. Mbapp\u00e9 doesn\u2019t really run in the normal sense of the word when he puts those thrusters on. He drifts, floats, shimmies, moving in way that seems so seductively elegant you wonder why every upright human biped doesn\u2019t do it like that.\n\nIt was 2-1 not long after, and this was Rabiot\u2019s work too, as he nicked the ball high up the pitch. Mbapp\u00e9 jump-flicked the ball back to him, Rabiot crossed and Giroud rolled the ball into the net.\nAfter which Mbapp\u00e9 began to dance and twirl and add little trills into his routine. It seemed, frankly, a bit much at times. But it probably has an effect. Imagine trying to face this thing down. From as distance the Mbapp\u00e9 persona is a gripping thing to watch, and oddly uplifting for all the planetary-scale amour propre.\nHere is a man supremely happy in his skin, in his dazzling talent. Far tougher challenges will await than these game yellow\u2011shirted athlete-footballers.\nBut Mbapp\u00e9, you just know, won\u2019t stop, will play like this, will continue to be utterly himself. A kind of ultimacy is within his grasp over the next three weeks. Either way it will be compulsive viewing."

                    "body": "Like many a distressed film protagonist, you could fall to your knees and lash the heavens with the eternal question: why? When you look at this week\u2019s 50-over international series between Australia and England, with the first match in Adelaide coming four days after England sealed the T20 World Cup title in Melbourne, it is puzzling to see the supposed pinnacle of one format followed by the pedestrian in a slightly different variation. Australia did need to play a series against England for Super League points, to qualify for the next 50-over World Cup \u2013 but that series happened back in 2020. This one is an optional extra, the basket of soaps in a hotel. You can understand then why England all-rounder Moeen Ali confirmed the obvious when asked about it: that heading off to travel and train immediately after raising a trophy, rather than having at least a day or two to celebrate with the teammates who went there with you, is a situation that entirely sucks. Then again, administrators don\u2019t know how deep any team will go into a tournament. England nearly had an early World Cup exit like Australia\u2019s, and with a longer break before the next series would probably have been annoyed at having to wait around so long.  Mostly the reason is the World Cup in India next October, with precious little opportunity for Australia to prepare. A four-Test series in India will take up February and half of March, the Indian Premier League dominates April and May, then the World Test Championship final and the Ashes take over in England in June and July. Before they know it, August and September will be last chance saloon. Having a decent hit-out against top competition will help determine team assembly and approach. The other factor is that pay-television bought exclusive access to men\u2019s white-ball internationals in the last rights deal. The pickings have been slim, as the genre has been marginalised in the height of the cricket summer by the Big Bash League. In the 2021-22 season, Fox Sports did not get a single one-day international to screen, and only five T20s against Sri Lanka in February. The network was not happy, and while dealing with the highly litigious Seven Network at the same time, Cricket Australia could use at least one mollified broadcast partner. As for what to expect on the field, Australia has played a fair bit of one-day cricket this year, in Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Australia\u2019s Top End. This will be the first series though with Patrick Cummins as captain, after the retirement of Aaron Finch. That leaves Cummins with 10 months and not many matches to establish a coherent way that this team wants to go about one-day cricket. Three ODIs will be announced to follow the India Test tour, and there are tours mooted for next year to South Africa and to India again, but nothing has been confirmed. Australia will go with a similar squad to the T20 World Cup. The only changes are Travis Head opening with David Warner for Finch, Alex Carey keeping wicket instead of Matthew Wade, Marnus Labuschagne likely to bat three as the long-innings specialist to replace the short-innings version in Tim David, and seaming all-rounder Sean Abbott a late inclusion after Glenn Maxwell\u2019s broken leg. Steve Smith will return to the middle order, Cameron Green should bat at six behind Marcus Stoinis or Mitchell Marsh, while we will likely see the same principal bowlers in Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Adam Zampa, though Ashton Agar is another spin option. As for England, Ben Stokes starred in the World Cup final win but is leaving to join the Test squad in Pakistan, taking with him fast bowler Mark Wood and batters Harry Brook and Liam Livingstone. Jos Buttler will stay to captain the one-day team, keeping Moeen Ali and seven others. One player who wasn\u2019t at the Cup was Jason Roy, left out in favour of Alex Hales. Before the tournament, Buttler backed Roy as his preferred 50-over opener. Hales though had an excellent T20 campaign and was integral to England reaching the final. He is not in this one-day squad, but can\u2019t be far. Roy must hope that time away from the national team has been refreshing, because if his own low scores continue then his replacement is ready. For one player, at least, the wait for this next engagement must have felt like a long one."

                    "body": "Best signing We can sit here and overanalyse these matters to find a clever answer but sometimes the simplest is the best. Step forward Erling Haaland. Since arriving in the Premier League the Norwegian striker-bot\u2019s record of 18 goals in 13 appearances \u2013 that\u2019s one every 58 minutes he\u2019s on the pitch \u2013 is frankly absurd. His movement and finishing are like nothing football has seen, leaving defenders rightly confused regarding how to stop him. Those at the World Cup will be pleased they will not have to face him because Norway did not qualify. On the other hand, it will mean he is rested for the second half of the season. Forgotten signing Wolves have struggled to score, which is unsurprising considering the number of strikers they have on the sidelines. Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez has not played since August and Pedro Neto was injured at the start of October. The summer signing Sasa Kalajdzic arrived for \u00a315m from Stuttgart, making his debut in a 1-0 win over Southampton, but had to be withdrawn at half-time with cruciate ligament damage that required surgery and it is not clear when he will return. Bruno Lage was forced into the free agent market to find some goals. Diego Costa was brought in, making his debut on 2 October against West Ham; Lage was sacked the next day. Costa is yet to score but he has been sent off.  Least surprising sacking At time of writing, six Premier League clubs have changed manager but Scott Parker scoops this award. After battling to get Bournemouth into the Premier League, he lasted four games. Things started brightly thanks to a 2-0 win over Aston Villa, who have since sacked Steve Gerrard. Then reality hit and 16 goals were conceded in three games, culminating in a 9-0 loss at Anfield and a P45 in the post. He had spent his time between defeats bemoaning that Bournemouth were \u201cway short of where we need to be\u201d and \u201cbarely had any defenders\u201d, two thinly veiled criticisms of the club\u2019s transfer business. Gary O\u2019Neil took over and went six games unbeaten to prove that Bournemouth were not too far short after all. Most demoralising defeat Wolves 0-4 Leicester. Wolves had 21 shots and failed to score. They did not even test Danny Ward. On the other hand, Leicester scored with their first four efforts. Home fans sang about how bad the team were and turned their ire on members of the hierarchy. It was a reminder of their distinct lack of attacking threat and how they will spend the season battling relegation. Few stayed for the end and those who did were intent only on pointing out their disgust. Most excited by World Cup break Liverpool have underwhelmed in league proceedings. There have been far too many draws, plus losses to struggling Nottingham Forest and Leeds. J\u00fcrgen Klopp has spoken of his optimism that a better Liverpool will come out of the other side of the World Cup. From back to front there have been issues with form and fitness, causing many a head-scratching moment for the manager. After defeat at the City Ground, Klopp said he was \u201cas low as possible\u201d but things got worse when Crysencio Summerville popped up with a late winner at Anfield the following week. Klopp is not particularly excited by the World Cup, allowing him time to focus on how he can move Liverpool up the league.  Best team Arsenal are top, which seems the easiest way to judge these things. Few would have predicted such an outcome but clever transfer business that brought Gabriel Jesus and Oleksandr Zinchenko to the club has been the catalyst for success after careful building in recent years by Mikel Arteta. A loss at Manchester United and draw against Southampton are the only blemishes on their Premier League record in 14 matches. They look more resilient than the Gunners of previous seasons and are genuine title contenders for the first time in more than a decade. Now they need to show they can last the pace with Manchester City snapping at their heels. Best XI so far  Biggest disappointment From relative ineptitude on the pitch to refusing to even go on, Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s efforts for Manchester United have been pretty pathetic. But do not worry CR7 fans, it\u2019s not his fault because the club have \u201cbetrayed\u201d him, he has no respect for Erik ten Hag and nothing has changed at Old Trafford since Sir Alex Ferguson left in 2013. That is why he has scored once in the league. He returned to Manchester as a legend but he will almost certainly depart in January having tainted his legacy for the sake of very little, except a fragile ego and ludicrous sense of self-importance"

                    "body": "EFF THE TOR\u2026 HOLD ON, WE\u2019RE NOT DOING THE WREXHAM STORY? REALLY? FINE. EMERY IT IS\nUnai Emery\u2019s stint at Arsenal wasn\u2019t studded with glorious success. So much so that, were you to ask fans in England for the first thing that springs to mind upon mention of the four-time Euro Vase-winning Spaniard, a fair few would head straight for the way he delivers a particular latter-day greeting. It\u2019s a bit off, really. Partly because poking fun at an amiable gent for the way they mispronounce one syllable from thousands of words in live television interviews conducted in a foreign language is staggeringly poor form. But mainly because his presiding over that 4-1 Euro Vase final defeat to Chelsea says a lot less about Emery, and a damn sight more about the epic show Arsenal regularly make of themselves on the continent.\n\nThe Fiver therefore wishes Emery the best of luck in his new job at Aston Villa. Rather like November\u2019s PM of the Month, Rishi Sunak, Emery has come into post at exactly the right time, in so much as base competence gave both of their stratospherically unpopular predecessors the swerve, so there\u2019s not exactly a high bar left to clear. But unlike Sunak, Emery has a little bit of wriggle room, taking charge of an organisation that still has a few quid left with which to speculate. He might use what\u2019s left to pop back to the Yellow Submarines for defender Pau Torres and winger Arnaut Danjuma, targeted investment that would surely signal happier days for Villa while giving his old pals, beloved minnows Villarreal, a much-needed cash boost. The wheels start turning again, everyone benefits, and John Maynard Keynes would be so, so proud.\n\nMeanwhile in Number 10, Rishi gets on with making his own difficult decisions. Hot tears trickle down on to the Downing Street ledger as he curses Truss for firing the entire country into the heart of the sun, thus forcing him to rub two brass bawbees together for the first time in his life. Say what you like about Christian Purslow, but his heart was in the right place and at least he didn\u2019t empty the Jack Grealish coffers in pursuit of some crank ideology. And no, sending for Steven Gerrard and then hoping Philippe Coutinho rediscovers his 2014-16 form doesn\u2019t count.\nRECOMMENDED LOOKING\nDavid Squires with a painful and poignant reminder why no self-respecting football fan would ever chant about Hillsborough.\n\nLIVE ON BIG WEBSITE\nJoin Scott Murray for live Big Cup updates from Salzburg 1-2 Chelsea (5.45pm BST) before Luke McLaughlin\u2019s Big Cup clockwatch covers the 8pm games including Dortmund 2-2 Manchester City, Celtic 0-0 Shakhtar and more besides.\nQUOTE OF THE DAY 1\n\u201cI messaged Roger [Federer] when I landed in Basel and said: \u2018I just touched down in the city of one of the world\u2019s greatest ever athletes: Granit Xhaka\u2019\u201d \u2013 tennis legend and Arsenal fan Andy Murray hits Big Fed with some prime banter.\nQUOTE OF THE DAY 2\n\u201cF*** the Tories!\u201d \u2013 Wrexham striker Paul Mullin\u2019s left boot, briefly.\n\nRECOMMENDED LISTENING\nWomen\u2019s Football Weekly is here!

                    "body": "Ben Stokes has hinted at a possible reversal of his retirement from one\u2011day cricket after an admission that the World Cup defence in India next year is tempting. Stokes called time on his 50-over career in July, citing the additional responsibilities of Test captaincy and a bulging schedule that has made it \u201cunsustainable\u201d for the 31\u2011year\u2011old all-rounder to represent his country and give 100% in all three formats. However, a leading role in England\u2019s recent T20 World Cup triumph in Australia not only furthered his reputation as a matchwinner but, coming after a 12-month absence from that format, suggested his dropping in solely for tournament cricket is workable. Jos Buttler, the white-ball captain, would certainly welcome such a return. Rob Key, England\u2019s director of men\u2019s cricket, tried to float the possibility as England prepared for their Test tour of Pakistan in Abu Dhabi last week and, though rebuffed at the time, it appears the door is not necessarily double-bolted. \u201cKeysy pulled me to the side in the UAE and as soon as he said the words \u201850-over World Cup\u2019 I just walked away,\u201d said Stokes in the buildup to the first Test in Rawalpindi, the start of which may be delayed after a number of the tourists were laid low by a virus. \u201cAt the moment, being out here, my focus is solely on this series. But it\u2019s one of those things. Who knows how I might feel towards a World Cup at the time? Going to a World Cup is an amazing thing to do, to represent your country.\u201d  As it stands, Stokes faces a lopsided 2023 \u2013 seven months of intense action followed by five that are sparse. After Pakistan comes a two-Test series in New Zealand in February, followed by the Indian Premier League \u2013 a tournament for which Stokes will put his name forward after missing this year\u2019s edition. Once back from the IPL in late May, Stokes would head straight into captaining a one-off, four-day Test against Ireland at Lord\u2019s from 1 June and then the small matter of a compact five-Test Ashes series that runs until 30 July. Thereafter, with England focusing on 50-over cricket before the World Cup starts in October, things thin out for Stokes, with four Twenty20s against New Zealand at the end of the home summer and a five-match T20 series in the Caribbean in December. It may be that the strains of being an all-rounder \u2013 not least a longstanding knee problem \u2013 and Test captaincy means this period of extended rest is required; the lure of defending the title he helped secure in 2019 may yet override this.

And in 15 seconds you\u2019re out because you have been speculating for 90 minutes. Or the other way round: Germany are winning 5-0 and we\u2019re drawing and that will do and then Japan score and you\u2019re out.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re a very good team and you want to play seven games, you want to be first. We play the team that\u2019s second in Group F, right? And then in the quarter-final \u2026 in theory it\u2019s Brazil. OK, great. We play Brazil then. We can\u2019t count like the milkmaid.\u201d\nThe milkmaid\u2019s metaphor is an equivalent to counting your chickens, a parable in which the protagonist believes the milk her cow produces will allow her to buy a goat, a horse and a farm until one day she trips and spills all the milk.\n\nLuis Enrique also drew on a real-world parallel, citing summer\u2019s basketball European championshipwhen Croatia deliberately missed a late free throw to finish third in the group rather than second, allowing them to go into what they thought was the easier half of the draw that included Spain, who they wanted to face. They lost their first knockout game to Finland and didn\u2019t even get to face Spain, who went on to win it.\n\u201cElite sport doesn\u2019t let you speculate,\u201d Luis Enrique said. \u201cTo win a World Cup, you have to beat everyone, or everyone you face. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to try to do.\u201d"

                    "body": "Risk is mostly a subjective judgment. For anyone scared of heights, even standing near a cliff-edge railing can feel daring. For others there is nothing to beat the surge of adrenaline that precedes a freefall parachute jump. Both are entirely legitimate human reactions. And, ultimately, who is to say that one is more rational than the other? Until recently it has been worth recognising this whenever rugby\u2019s future is being discussed. Then you switch on the television and watch Head On: Rugby, Dementia and Me, featuring Steve Thompson. A 2003 World Cup winner, still only 44, struggling to recall his daughter\u2019s name and sifting through a boxful of mementoes from games which are a complete blank. For those of us who have known, liked and respected Thommo over many years it was heartbreaking.  Recent days have also yielded plenty of other grim updates, from Willie Stewart\u2019s study of an increased risk of motor neurone disease among former Scotland internationals to the depressing neurological update recently supplied by the former England and St Helens rugby league prop James Graham. On Sunday at least three players were either knocked out or forced off prematurely after heavy blows to the head at Wasps. On Friday night I also watched Bristol\u2019s Ellis Genge, among others, smashing into rucks at Ashton Gate and found myself wondering if the sport has ever exposed players to as many brutal collisions as it currently does. So what next? According to James Drake it is no longer even a question. The rugby-loving philanthropist and founder of the not-for-profit Drake Foundation \u2013 which has put \u00a32.2m towards funding detailed evidence-based scientific research into sport-related brain injuries \u2013 is adamant something fundamental has to change. Last year one of the studies backed by the Drake Foundation found 23% of a group of 44 current elite rugby players had abnormalities in their brain structure. Drake was sure it would trigger instant, far-reaching change. Instead he fears the penny is not dropping nearly fast enough. Hence his appearance in Thompson\u2019s film. And his desire to spell out, once again, some of the starker home truths raised by last year\u2019s study. \u201cWe\u2019ve looked at it from a number of different angles and come to the same conclusion: that elite rugby union is not safe,\u201d he says bluntly. \u201cIt\u2019s the old Sherlock Holmes technique: when you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains is the truth. It is impossible that we can carry on as we do now, with the same number of impacts. \u201cThe average age of the players sampled was 25. They had unexpected abnormalities \u2013 and some shrinkage \u2013 to their white matter. You don\u2019t yet know if that\u2019s going to progress to clinical symptoms. But if you ask a cardiologist whether any structural change is acceptable in the heart they\u2019d say \u2018No way.\u2019\u201d Both World Rugby and the Rugby Football Union insist much continues to be done to mitigate the risks to elite players, including the encouragement of lower tackle heights and certain law amendments. In a statement to the Guardian, in the wake of the Thompson programme, the RFU also praised its former hooker for speaking out. \u201cWe were deeply saddened to hear the brave personal account from Steve Thompson and his family. We applaud players for telling their stories, it is an incredibly brave thing to do.\u201d  But a significant gap continues to exist between the official concussion-driven stats and the as-yet unknown consequences in later life of the cumulative intensity of impacts in the elite game. Drake, and other groups such as Progressive Rugby, are not involved in the ongoing legal case being pursued by almost 200 ex-union players but do have longer-term concerns for the well-being of a generation of ex-pros. \u201cConcussion is a fairly convenient way of dismissing the problem,\u201d suggests Drake. \u2018You can say \u2018a player seems to have recovered from a concussion\u2019 without knowing what is going on in his head now or, potentially, in the future.\u201d \u201cBut you can\u2019t draw a line in terms of the cumulative intensity of impacts. And therein lies the problem. Based on all the evidence I\u2019ve looked at there has to be a significant reduction in the cumulative intensity of impacts. Significant. Not papering over the cracks. It\u2019s got to be a major change, you\u2019re not talking about window dressing.\u201d If it was up to him, three alterations would be immediate. \u201cTo me it was ludicrous for World Rugby merely to recommend reducing contact in training to 15 minutes. Of course you have to make things like that mandatory. Secondly you have to look at having eight substitutes. Big strong men coming on to the pitch and playing against players who are already tired is not a good thing. I think substitutions should be for injury or genuine fatigue. And you\u2019ve got to do more within the game itself to reduce the cumulative intensity of impacts. All those three things are common sense, based on the evidence. \u201cI\u2019m a risk averse person. I\u2019d never have stood up and said to Steve that elite rugby was not safe unless I was certain in my own mind that was the case. I don\u2019t want to point fingers and name names but I\u2019m a little upset that more has not been done. People have known about the problem for a long time and not enough has been done to reduce those impacts. The problem has been left on the shelf. There\u2019s got to be some soul searching.\u201d Drake was initially motivated by the sight of a concussed Hugo Lloris, playing for Tottenham, staying on the field with a concussion in 2013. At first he wondered whether his mission might be akin to inviting a big tobacco company to do more lung cancer research. Now after the Thompson film \u2013 \u201cMaybe it was some sort of watershed\u201d \u2013 he hopes more people will listen. The Drake Foundation, he adds, is branching out from sport and looking to extend their head injury focus to abusive domestic situations and the prison population. Just let that sink in. Rugby players are increasingly sharing a similar ball park to battered partners and violent inmates. Risky business or not, that is a perception no self-respecting sport can afford to ignore.

                    "body": "Good morning. If you have been struck down by a particularly gnarly cold recently, you are not alone. Two years of social distancing, masking and lockdowns has meant that many of us were able to avoid getting the usual, seasonal respiratory infections. But now that it\u2019s becoming normal to go into the office or socialise with a tickle in your throat or a congested nose, a lot of people are continually catching colds and flus. Since September, the bacterial infection known as Strep A has been on the rise and the deaths of 15 children in the UK has caused widespread concern, especially as the spread of the disease is happening far earlier than usual, meaning that the number could rise. However, Strep A is not Covid 19: it\u2019s not a new infection, it is well researched and it is treatable \u2026 with the right antibiotics. But with reports of antibiotic shortages pharmacists have been warning that people will not be able to access treatment unless action is taken. I spoke to Dr Leyla Hannbeck, the chief executive of the Association of Independent Multiple Pharmacies, about the supply shortage and its impacts. That\u2019s right after the headlines. Five big stories  Channel crossings | Warnings that a boat carrying asylum seekers had capsized in the Channel were first raised in a call to a French NGO. The Guardian obtained a recording from an unidentified man on the sinking vessel, calling for help. Four people died and more than 40 were rescued in the accident. Fire service | London fire brigade has been placed into special measures after a report revealed incidents of misogyny, racism and bullying. The industry watchdog made the move saying that behavioural problems were \u201cdeep-seated and have not improved\u201d. Nurse Strike | Tens of thousands of nurses will strike across England, Wales and Northern Ireland today in the first such action in NHS history. It\u2019s the first of two days of scheduled walkouts over pay claims. Police | A damning report into how police forces tackle rape cases has exposed persistent failings in the criminal justice system, including a failure to track repeat suspects, \u201cexplicit victim-blaming\u201d and botched investigations. The official examination was launched by the government after a catastrophic fall in rape prosecutions. Wealth | Elon Musk has lost his status as the world\u2019s richest person, after further falls in the value of shares in his electric car company Tesla. Forbes and Bloomberg reported that Musk had lost the top spot to France\u2019s Bernard Arnault, the chief executive of the luxury group LVMH.  In depth: \u2018My concern is what it will take for the government to listen\u2019  If it is caught and treated early, Strep A is nothing to panic about. However, people are struggling to get appointments at overstretched GPs \u2013 making it hard to administer medicine soon enough. This problem is only exacerbated by a chronic shortage of antibiotics that has been on the horizon for months. Pharmacies are being pushed to the brink and parents are unable to access the right treatment for their children \u2013 with some resorting to crushing adult tablets and mixing them with Ribena to make it palatable for young children. How has this happened? *** What is Strep A? Group A streptococcus (GAS), otherwise known as Strep A, is a bacterium found in the throat and on the skin and is spread through coughs and sneezes. For many people it can live in the body without causing any illnesses and generally when it does cause symptoms, they are fairly mild \u2013 a fever, sore throat and headache that can be treated at home. The infection is commonly associated with strep throat (tonsillitis) but in a few cases, the symptoms can be more aggressive, especially if they turn into scarlet fever, which can be identified through skin rashes and \u201cstrawberry tongue\u201d. At this point people are encouraged to go to the GP or the hospital to get antibiotics, to stop the infection progressing and becoming worse. Some experts have suggested the uptick in cases is because people are socialising far more this winter than they have in the previous two because of the pandemic, but others have said that it is too early to suggest that this is the main cause behind the surge \u2013 for example, there was a surge in 2018, pre-pandemic, which resulted in 32,000 cases, although the rise in numbers started earlier this year than then. *** An antibiotic shortage Ten days ago Leyla Hannbeck raised concerns about the supply of antibiotics in the country \u2013 her comments were reported all over the national media. Since then she says the problem has gone from \u201cbad to worse\u201d. The cause is more fundamental than just a surge in demand \u2013 Hannbeck says that the supply chain problems that were caused by the pandemic are still affecting the pharmaceutical industry: \u201cWe know that it now takes on average about six months longer for a product to be manufactured. This antibiotic shortage is not the first time that we\u2019ve experienced this problem.\u201d Pointing to the HRT shortage in the spring, Hannbeck says that this has been an ongoing issue that has been ignored. The government has insisted that there is no such shortage: \u201cAs long as they want to be in denial, it\u2019s very difficult to move forward\u201d. Not only has it been difficult to obtain the medicine in the first place, pharmacies have been dispensing antibiotics at a steep loss because wholesale prices for amoxicillin or penicillin liquid solutions have been rocketing. In recent weeks the cost of antibiotics that could treat Strep A have risen more than tenfold in the UK but, regardless of how much they are forking out to get the supplies, the NHS will not reimburse pharmacies above the tariff that has been set.  *** The impacts Millions of people need pharmacies to access their medicine, however 670 pharmacies have had to close since 2015. \u201cThis is going to accelerate a lot in 2023 and 2024 because people simply cannot pay the money to wholesalers and investors,\u201d Hannbeck says of the impact of the NHS paying under cost for common treatments. It comes at the same time that other costs such as staff, business rates and energy bills have all gone up. Most retailers can add the cost on to their products and pass it on to the consumer, but pharmacists can\u2019t, \u201cbecause it\u2019s medicine and we don\u2019t want to deprive people from having essential medicines just because they can\u2019t afford it\u201d, Hannbeck says. There is little that pharmacies can do to help, the guidelines at the moment say that they should send patients to other pharmacies if they can\u2019t supply treatment. Patients can also go back to the GP to ask for a different prescription, for another antibiotic for example \u2013 but both options are long-winded and stressful and leave more time for the infection to get worse. After first denying that there were any supply issues, the government has put an export ban on Strep A antibiotics to stabilise stock in the country \u2013 but this is a short-term solution for a longstanding problem that healthcare experts and professionals have been warning about. \u201cIt\u2019s become a constant battle to try to manage the situation,\u201d Hannbeck says. \u201cMy concern is what will it take for the government to listen and take action since we\u2019ve been bringing this to them since the beginning of this year.\u201d A lack of forward planning has meant that a problem that could have been anticipated and mitigated, could become a crisis. Hannbeck says that until the government talks to pharmacies, manufacturers and wholesalers to create a cohesive solution, the shortage will continue and likely get worse, adding to the concern felt by already worried parents. If there is some small solace, it is that while more children have been affected, the mortality rate for the disease so far this year is no higher than normal (though that will be of little comfort to grieving families). The real worry is what will happen if the spread continues unabated \u2013 could already stretched supplies of vital drugs cope with a spike on the scale of 2018? What else we\u2019ve been reading  After Rishi Sunak\u2019s plan to clear the asylum backlog and the dreadful news of more deaths in the Channel yesterday, this piece by Enver Solomon is a necessary corrective to a discourse around the small boats crisis that tends to forget the human beings at the centre of it. Archie Gordon Brown has called for a moratorium on debt collection by the government. \u201cThere is no huge cost to the government in suspending deductions, for it will get its money back later\u201d, Brown writes in the Guardian. \u201c[But] this could be a lifesaver for millions now suffering under a regime that seems vindictive beyond austerity\u201d. Nimo Nearly 20 years of the hot priest calendar, and only now do I learn that some of them are not actually priests! Morwenna Ferrier\u2019s interview with photographer Piero Pazzi contains several other bombshells, including the fact that some of them are repeated year to year. I\u2019m so naive. Archie In the Guardian\u2019s Top 50 shows of 2022 at number six comes a personal favourite of mine: the Channel 4 comedy, Big Boys. Hollie Richardson unpacks the significance of this special series that chronicled a minefield of self-discovery, mental health and male friendship in the early 2000s. Nimo Lots of interesting things in this New Yorker interview with James Acaster, especially his view of heckling: \u201cSometimes, as a comedian, you can feel like they\u2019re not treating you like a human being, if you get really upset about it. But we don\u2019t always treat the audience like they\u2019re human beings, either.\u201d Archie  World Cup An early goal from Th\u00e9o Hernandez and a second half strike from Randal Kolo Muani was enough to see France progress to a World Cup Final against Argentina on Sunday. But the broad brushstrokes of this match do little to take in just how much Morocco made the title holders sweat. The first African team to reach a World Cup semi-final were a 200-1 shot at the beginning of the tournament, but have proved themselves more than able to upset some of the biggest teams in the competition. The Guardian\u2019s Jacob Steinberg was watching the match in Qatar. Looking ahead to Sunday\u2019s final his assessment of France is that, \u201cbarring another Messi masterclass, they are about to become the first country since Brazil in 1962 to successfully defend the World Cup.\u201d --- For all the latest on Qatar, from the scandal to the scores, sign up to Football Daily \u2013 our free, sometimes funny, newsletter The front pages  The Guardian leads with \u201cScathing report condemns police for \u2018victim blaming\u2019 in rape cases\u201d, with newly released analysis finding persistent failings and forces struggling to cope with case loads.

Andrew Gregory, the Guardian\u2019s health editor, and his colleagues spent hours on the frontline of the NHS to find out how doctors, nurses, paramedics \u2013 and the patients they treat \u2013 were coping. Cartoon of the day | Steve Bell  The Upside  A bit of good news to remind you that the world\u2019s not all bad When Sarah Ann Harris\u2019s grandmother died unexpectedly in 2016, her absence made Christmas brutal: \u201cEverywhere I looked, there were holes where Grandma should have been,\u201d she writes. One of the sharpest reminders was the absence of the festive fruit tart that she always used to bake on Christmas Eve. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t find the recipe anywhere. We scoured her kitchen, flicking through cookbooks and notes, but there was no sign of it. Her recipe, it seemed, had died with her.\u201d Five years later, Sarah tried to recreate the dish. After racking her brains for a few ingredients that might be clues, she found the missing recipe in a genuinely unexpected place.

                    "body": "The City watchdog could fine Barclays up to \u00a350m for failing to disclose a deal struck with Qatar at the height of the financial crisis, reviving a controversial episode that failed to gain traction in UK courts. The provisional fine \u2013 which Barclays is in the process of appealing against \u2013 relates to the \u00a3322m the bank paid to Qatar in 2008, allegedly in exchange for the gas-rich Gulf state investing \u00a34bn, helping save the lender from a UK government bailout. The fees were seen by critics as a way for Qatar to effectively purchase Barclays shares at a heavily discounted price that was not offered to other investors. The findings from an investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) released on Friday has determined that those fees, which were paid in two tranches in 2008, were not properly disclosed. \u201cBarclays\u2019 failure to disclose these matters was reckless and lacked integrity, and followed an earlier failure to disclose fees paid to Qatari investors in June 2008,\u201d Mark Steward, a director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said. \u201cThere was no legitimate reason or excuse for failing to disclose these matters, certainly no basis for doing so because of the financial crisis. Due transparency is always critical to financial markets, especially in times of market or financial stress,\u201d Steward added. While the FCA provisionally plans to fine Barclays \u00a350m, that sum will hinge on the outcome of the bank\u2019s appeal to the FCA\u2019s upper tribunal. Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, the Qatar Investment Authority, still holds a 6.3% stake in Barclays. The FCA originally revealed it was investigating the controversial fee arrangements back in 2013, but paused its investigation during a criminal trial launched by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO). However, the SFO failed to win a trial against Barclays over the Qatar deal, and the case collapsed in 2018. The SFO later lost a case against a trio of Barclays executives \u2013 who were accused of devising fraudulent advisory services agreements in order to disguise the payments to Qatar \u2013 following a five-month trial. It was the only criminal case brought against banking bosses for their actions during the financial crisis, but all three were found not guilty of fraud by a UK jury in February 2020. The case cost the taxpayer \u00a39m-\u00a310m. A Barclays spokesperson said: \u201cBarclays has referred the findings of the regulatory decisions committee to the upper tribunal for reconsideration.\u201d"

                    "body": "Courtney Lawes has revealed he was not consulted by the Rugby Football Union over the decision to sack Eddie Jones and was not aware that any players had been, admitting he was shocked and saddened by the former head coach\u2019s departure. The 33-year-old captained England to their series victory in Australia over the summer and was set to continue in the role in the autumn until he suffered nerve damage in his neck. He was sorely missed with England recording just one win in four matches, ending the year with five victories from 12 Tests including the dreadful defeat by South Africa to close the campaign.  The RFU chief executive, Bill Sweeney, led a review into England\u2019s performance, assisted by anonymous panel members, and despite Jones fighting for his job at a meeting at Twickenham last week, he was shown the door after seven years in the role. Asked if was invited to contribute, Lawes said: \u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t. I don\u2019t think any players were. \u201cI heard the news last Tuesday and just gave [Eddie] a text thanking him for his service and what he had done for my career. That\u2019s all I could really do. I was quite surprised because it\u2019s so close to the World Cup. Eddie has got a pretty good track record at World Cups. The last couple of years haven\u2019t really gone our way but the World Cups are different for us because we get to spend so long together, we get to be a proper team for three or four months. \u201cI know I\u2019m one of the lucky ones, he didn\u2019t give me much stick or anything like that and he was ultimately really good for my career. I know that\u2019s not the case for everyone so people may have different opinions but for me, personally, I was sad to see him go. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see. Because you\u2019re removed from the last camp and you don\u2019t know what has happened, what has gone on or how the players were really feeling, the staff, there\u2019s not much you can say about it. From the Australia tour we were going in the right direction, I thought we had made a lot of strides towards the World Cup and to not be able to make progress on that this autumn for whatever reason.\u201d  Lawes made his first appearance in 11 weeks off the bench last week in Northampton\u2019s heavy defeat by La Rochelle and starts Sunday\u2019s match against Munster. While Lawes initially believed his injury was a concussion \u2013 due to a blow to the back of the head \u2013 a setback in training three weeks later led to further investigation, including a brain scan, and the conclusion that he had suffered further problems with his vestibular system \u2013 an issue that sidelined him for six weeks at the start of the year. Lawes admits that having a recurring problem made him concerned about his long-term future but was given reassurance by the specialist before making his return. \u201cI suppose it is quite worrying,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time, because I\u2019d had a similar thing before and he explained to me that your vestibular system is to do with your eyes, your eyes and the back of your neck \u2013 it\u2019s not to do with brain damage \u2026 to be honest I was more worried about what it means for the future because you hear a lot of stories but I spoke to the specialist again and said: \u2018What does it mean for the future?\u2019 and he reassured me and said it can increase your chances but not by much. \u201cGenerally it\u2019s your genetics which will determine if you get things like dementia and stuff like how much you\u2019re drinking, other recreational things, and how healthy you keep yourself in later life. Because I\u2019m pretty good on that stuff anyway that reassured me.\u201d"

                    "body": "Can soccer change the world? Mahmood Ebrahimzadeh, an Iranian international who played for his country in the Fifa World Cup, believes it can. Ebrahimzadeh is one of a network of retired Iranian soccer players now living in exile and urging global support for the uprising currently rocking the country\u2019s theocratic regime. The group is preparing a joint letter to Joe Biden calling for the president and the US to help the Iranian people just as they are helping the people of Ukraine. \u201cA lot of actors, a lot of singers, a lot of soccer players in the world are supporting the movement in Iran right now,\u201d said the 69-year-old, who lives in Woodbine, Maryland. \u201cThe only people that need to come to the same line are the governments, European and American.\u201d Spontaneous protests have erupted in Iran over the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish woman detained by the country\u2019s morality police for allegedly wearing a hijab headscarf in an \u201cimproper\u201d way. Scores of people have been killed and hundreds arrested over three weeks.  The upheaval vibrates within Ebrahimzadeh, whose political activism disrupted his soccer career in Iran in the 1970s. He played as a striker for the national team \u2013 \u201cI think it was 15 times,\u201d he says \u2013 including World Cup and Olympic qualifying matches. But after the 1979 Islamic Revolution brought chaos and oppression, he felt his dissident views froze him out of the national team. Finally, in 1982, when the team\u2019s coach invited Ebrahimzadeh back to play in the Asian Cup, the regime saw an opportunity to seize him along with two other players. \u201cThey captured those two,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThey put them in the jail and then they killed one of them. \u201cI had the chance to run away in the night-time and go and meet my wife and my son Maboud, who was nine months old. We left through Kurdistan and we left the country. It was hard, 10 days and nights walking through the mountains in snow, 20 degrees minus, and we were not familiar with the roads. No passport or nothing.\u201d The family crossed the border into Turkey, then went on to Germany, which \u2013 despite a language barrier \u2013 Ebrahimzadeh recalls as \u201cheaven\u201d compared with the freezing Zagros Mountains.  He said Germans\u2019 learning he was a soccer pro \u201cwas the key to open all the doors\u201d for him. He went on to play for renowned German club VfL Wolfsburg and proved a prolific goalscorer. He moved to the US in 1986 and joined a Chicago indoor team but a broken leg forced him into premature retirement. He ran a US-based soccer school for AC Milan before becoming a travelling representative for the Italian club, then directed Olympic development programmes in Maryland.  Ebrahimzadeh is still in touch with at least 20 Iranian former soccer players living in America and Europe who, like other prominent figures, are showing solidarity with the protesters in Iran. Ali Karimi, an ex-Iranian captain and Bayern Munich player now based in Dubai, was charged in absentia by Iran over social media posts supporting the protests, including on Instagram, where he has nearly 12 million followers. Ebrahimzadeh reflected: \u201cThey\u2019re supporting the young generation in the streets. They\u2019re supporting human rights. They\u2019re supporting the movement right now.\u201d The political potency of soccer was evident last year when England\u2019s players took the knee during the European championships to express support for racial justice after the 2020 murder of George Floyd, a Black man, by a white police officer in the US. Ebrahimzadeh noted that some current members of the Iranian national team have also spoken out at great personal risk. \u201cOn social media they said this is not way to treat the people, this is their right, this is their choice. The government has to respect them and killing is not the solution. You have to open up democracy further.\u201d But the government crackdown under the hardline president, Ebrahim Raisi, has been draconian. Ebrahimzadeh continued: \u201cAnybody that speaks out against the government and supports the woman\u2019s movement right now, they capture them, they put them in the jail. \u201cOf course non-soccer players, regular people, they can kill easier. They can hardly kill soccer players or singers or actors but they put them in a jail and that\u2019s happened to a couple of the national team players.\u201d Ebrahimzadeh said reports of a 16-year-old soccer player being jailed were enough to bring him to tears. The Iranian government seeks to restrict TV coverage of European soccer leagues in Iran but the big clubs still have a following. Ebrahimzadeh called on Fifa, the sport\u2019s world governing body, to play its part by barring Iran from the World Cup finals in Qatar. The team\u2019s campaign is to begin against England on 21 November. He likened the move to sporting organizations suspending Russia from competition after the country\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. \u201cFifa knows that the federation of Iran and all the clubs [there] are controlled by military generals,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cA bunch of terrorists is running a federation that is part of Fifa.\u201d Leaderless, protean and durable, the protests go on, largely fuelled by the middle and upper classes. They pose the biggest threat to the authoritarian government since the 2009 green movement brought millions to the streets. Ebrahimzadeh, who last visited his homeland five years ago, said he dreams of an Iran free from Ayatollah Ali Khamenei\u2019s regime. In order to realise that dream, he wants America to focus on human rights in Iran rather than negotiations to restore a nuclear deal struck under President Barack Obama which, he fears, would release tens of millions of dollars to Tehran. \u201cDon\u2019t pay them,\u201d Ebrahimzadeh said. \u201cThe money that they release from here is going to be weapons, bullets and killing our young kids over there.\u201d Instead he wants to see the US rally the international community and \u201csupport the people\u201d by pressuring Iran\u2019s regime through boycotts. \u201cWe need action,\u201d Ebrahimzadeh said. \u201cWe need them to stand up for us.\u201d"

                    "body": "\u201cKevin De Bruyne has played against Wales nine times throughout his international career. Has any player earned more caps against the same opposition?\u201d asks Joran.\nDe Bruyne may be bored of facing Joe Allen and friends, but he\u2019s got a long way to go before he beats the record for most caps against a single country.\n\u201cThe Danish international Per R\u00f8ntved featured 11 times against Sweden between 1970 and 1982,\u201d writes Troels Milo Knudsen. Unsurprisingly, geographical rivalries provide most of the answers to this question.\n\u201cBilly Wright played 13 times versus Scotland between 1947 and 1959,\u201d notes Michael Haughey, \u201cBobby Moore made 12 appearances against the Scots from 1963 to 1973.\u201d Wright also played 13 times, an England record, against Northern Ireland.\n\u201cThere must be several players in teams that play in smaller confederations,\u201d writes Will Van der Byl. \u201cThe most obvious one I can think of is Canada\u2019s captain Atiba Hutchinson, who has won 14 of his 98 caps playing against Honduras in a mixture of World Cup qualifiers, Gold Cup, Nations League and friendlies.\u201d\n\nIn the same part of the world, Ben Cordes points out that Landon Donovan won 17 of his USA caps against Mexico, including the celebrated victory at the 2002 World Cup.\nBack to Britain, where the Home International Championship, which ran until 1984, provided plenty of opportunities to rack up appearances against the same opponent. Especially if you were the best goalkeeper in your country, arguably the world. \u201cPat Jennings (Northern Ireland 1964\u201386, 119 caps) played 20 times against England, and 19 times against Scotland,\u201d writes John Curry. Those 20 caps include the famous night at Wembley when Jennings kept England at bay and ensured Northern Ireland\u2019s qualification for Mexico 86 ahead of Romania.\nAccording to the 11v11 site, the great Argentina winger Pedro Calomino, who played for his country between 1912-24, won 25 of his 41 caps against Uruguay. (There\u2019s a bit of doubt about the official status of games at either end of his career, but we can safely say he played against Uruguay a helluva lot.)\n\u201cI suspect the record holder is the US legend Kristine Lilly,\u201d suggests Tim Dockery. \u201cSadly, I can\u2019t find a full list of all her matches, but looking at just the first 225 of her 354 caps, she faced Canada 19 times, China 24 times and Norway 25 times.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re sure Lilly will hold the record, but we also can\u2019t find a list of her 354 caps. If anyone can, please send it. Otherwise for now, the best we can do is the Malaysian legend Soh Chin Ann. According to RSSSF, he faced South Korea 28 times between 1969-84.\nManagers in music videos (2)\nIn last week\u2019s Knowledge, we used Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and Stormzy as an excuse to look at managers in music videos. Turns out we missed a number of classics. Some are official club/country videos, which probably isn\u2019t in the spirit of the original question, but they\u2019re too good to leave out.\n\nThree Lions (Geoff Hurst, David Platt, etc)\nSpent the Day in Bed (Joey Barton)\nRevelation Time (Ruud Gullit)\nLet\u2019s Dance (Bryan Robson)\n\n\nAnd finally, the video that came this close to redeeming 2020.\n\nBig money in lower divisions\n\u201cI have memories of Hermann Hreidarsson being signed from Crystal Palace by Brentford for \u00a3750,000 during the 1998-99 season when they were in the third division (fourth tier),\u201d writes Rob Davies. \u201cIs that the highest transfer fee paid for that division? Even by today\u2019s standards it seems enormous.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a whopping fee, but it\u2019s not the record. In 2009, when they were celebrating life under Sven-Goran Eriksson, Notts County signed Kasper Schmeichel from Manchester City. The fee was officially undisclosed but widely reported as being around \u00a31.5m. He was worth it: County won the league at a canter. Things didn\u2019t end so well, mind.\n\nA double-barrelled quandary\n\nYes. Next!\nKnowledge archive\n\u201cI know teams these days tend to wear even a new away kit at the first opportunity at home as a form of advertising,\u201d wrote Simon Horner in 2012, \u201cbut has there ever been a kit that, due to a lack of colour clashes, has never been worn?\u201d\nWhile there were a whole multitude of shirts produced in the 90s that should never have seen the light of day due to their eyeball-bleeding ugliness, Fiorentina\u2019s was perhaps the only one banned on political grounds. It took until December of the 1992-93 season before anyone noticed that the club\u2019s away kit included (presumably unintentional) swastikas. The kit was quickly withdrawn. \u201cFiorentina and the manufacturers, Lotto, would like to underline that the optical effect [of a swastika image] is purely a matter of chance,\u201d culpa mea-ed the club in a statement.\nOf course, Fiorentina actually played in that kit \u2013 which didn\u2019t answer Simon\u2019s question \u2013 but Jon Waite brought us news of kits that never saw competitive action beyond a seven year-old winger down the park. \u201cThe FA produced a sky-blue version of the 1990 World Cup shirt (as famously modelled by Bernard Sumner in the World in Motion video) that was never worn in a fixture,\u201d explained Jon. \u201cA different sky-blue third kit was worn once in a qualifier in Turkey a year later when Dennis Wise scored the winner.\u201d\nJon also nominated QPR\u2019s third kit from the 1989-90 season, which was a jazzy black and orange number \u2013 their away kit was red and black and the lack of colour clashes meant it was left mouldering on the dressing room shelves. They also had an unused third kit in 1991-92. \u201cIt has been long rumoured that this kit was nixed by two senior professionals at the club, Ray Wilkins and Alan McDonald,\u201d reckoned Jon. \u201cWilkins was still revered at Rangers from his time as a player there and McDonald was an east Belfast boy, long time Rangers fan and Northern Ireland captain. Both allegedly refused to wear the shirt for fear of upsetting friends in high places.\u201d\n\nCan you help?\n\u201cHave there been any examples of a player hitting the crossbar and both goalposts with three separate shots/headers in the same match?\u201d asks Graham Clayton.\n\n\u201cSwitzerland\u2019s goalkeeper Yann Sommer recently saved his fifth penalty in a row in international matches (shoot-outs excluded). Is this a record and if no, what are the longest penalty-saving streaks in football\u2019s history?\u201d wonders Thomas Loser.\n\n\u201cDue to the pitch fiasco for Coventry, City are playing five home games in October 2022,\u201d explains Larry Johnson. \u201cHas this ever happened before to a league club? Weather and Cup buildups excepted.\u201d\n\nMail us your questions or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU."

                    "body": "  9.37pm    That\u2019s it from me for tonight. Two quality games to kick off the long awaited tournament. They were both one-sided but showcased just how dangerous some of the heavy hitters will be over the next few weeks. Australia are favourites for a reason. They barely got out of third gear against Fiji and cantered to an easy win. Immense on defence and clinical, for the most part, in the red zone. A few kinks ti iron out, but they\u2019ll surely get that sorted. I hope you enjoyed the coverage today. Til next time.       9.31pm    Here\u2019s the Aussie coach, Mal Meninga:  I\u2019m happy with that. We got through it pretty well. Really happy with the defence. A few things to fix up with the ball, but overall, very happy. The effort around our defence was spot on. All the things we asked of our players [they did really well].  We\u2019ve got some competition in the team. We\u2019ll rest a few guys next week and play some others who can put their foot forward. We talked about how it would be clunky from our point of view. We\u2019ve only been here for a week. We\u2019ll improve as the tournament goes on.      9.27pm    I\u2019m with the pundits on the Beeb. I thought Harry Grant should have been player of the match. He was so good off the bench. Every time he got his hands on it the Aussies looked like doing something. But you know what, credit to Munster. He was class as well. It could have been anyone, to be fair. If we\u2019re honest, the real player of the match was the Kangaroos\u2019 defence coach.      9.25pm    Here\u2019s the player of the match, Cameron Munster  There was a bit [of rustiness]. We should have scored a lot more points but didn\u2019t execute. We go back to the drawing board and can hopefully be a bit better. But happy with the performance. Fiji are a really good side. They have a lot of talent, a lot of heart. It didn\u2019t surprise me that they scored first. Hopefully the go well in this tournament. I\u2019m very luck to be in the middle and have [all the very fast wingers and outside backs] who make me look good.      9.21pm   FULL TIME: Australia 42-8 Fiji  Clinical. Efficient. Ruthless. Australia were all those things. They were also rusty, which is why this dominant display didn\u2019t have an even greater margin of victory. But they won\u2019t care. Grant was great, pulling string and stabbing through kicks. Addo-Carr\u2019s 80 solo try was a joy to watch and Tedesco showed his class. The real triumph was the Australian defence. Wave after wave of white Fijian attacks crashed on green rocks. Immovable. That\u2019s the best word to use. The champions are up and running.   Updated at 9.43pm BST    9.19pm    80 mins: Even with the game well and truly buried, Australia are defending as if they have a title on the line. That is what makes them champions. Fiji can\u2019t get anywhere and their attack ends with them losing the ball on the left. Game over.      9.17pm    79 mins: There are bodies everywhere. Australia knock on inside Fiji\u2019s territory. Fizzling out slightly. One more set for Fiji I reckon before we hear the final whistle.      9.15pm   TRY! Australia 42-8 Fiji (Turuva, 26)  That\u2019s a rugby league try but it started with a soccer move. One kick through was met by another kick by Turuva who then gathers the bouncing ball and dots down over the line. That was almost tiki-taka. Fiji deserve that consolation. They\u2019d been hammering the line with busting runs through the middle. Wakeham misses the conversion. Not that it matters too much. He\u2019ll be annoyed with himself, mind.     9.12pm    75 mins: Nanai has tip-tackled Wakeham. No malice, but that was dicey. They shake hands after and the Fijian isn\u2019t hurt so it\u2019s no card. Just a pen.     9.11pm    73 mis: Valemei is nailed in the tackle. The ball is recycled though and finds its way left. The bal goes right. Quick hands. They\u2019ve got an overlap but cut back in field. Wrong decision. There was a man on the flank and Australia have it back. Not for long. Fiji have it again after Cherry-Evans coughs it up. Becoming a little messy now.     9.09pm    71 mins: Mitchell does brilliantly to find a hole in midfield but his pass left isn\u2019t gathered. Addo-Carr, chasing a hat-trick, punches the ball in frustration. Australia want more.     9.06pm   TRY! Australia 42-4 Fijie (Addo-Carr, 68)  Another aimless kick from Fiji means Australia can canter up field. They advance it upfield. Grant busts a tackle and grubs a kick forward and Addo-Carr, with nitroglycerin in his shoes, runs on to it and makes the points safe. Lovely try. Grant is having a stunner of a game. Holmes, again, makes no mistake from the tee.   Updated at 9.17pm BST    9.02pm    65 mins: Fiji aren\u2019t giving up. They\u2019re charging into the green wall with gusto but are hardly making dents. They\u2019ve got no choice but to hoof the ball into Aussie territory. It\u2019s mopped bu and Mitchell takes it back up field. Crichton also involved with a ploughing carry. Nanai pops a back of the hand off-load that gets the crowd\u2019s attention. Fiji earn the handover 20m from their own line.     8.59pm   TRY! Australia 36-4 Fiji (Tredesco, 61)  Of course he was going to score tonight. The skipper takes the ball in front of him, steps off his right foot while throwing a dummy pass and shaking off Koroisau. Tredesco shifts back in field and rides the challenge of two Fijians. He needs to twist in the tackle and dot down, making it look so simple. Brilliant fullback play. He had front foot ball but that was hardly a gimme. Holmes kicks his sixth kick to maintain his 100% record tonight.   Updated at 9.18pm BST    8.55pm    59 mins: Oh no! That was the chance and they make a mess of it. Valemei spills the ball under pressure after his teammates work a slick move down the left. All he needed to do was gather and pass and the man on the overlap had an easy score, but couldn\u2019t do either.      8.53pm    58 mins: Fiji are so close but just can\u2019t find the space. Such tenacious defence from Australia. Fiji are direct but lack the innovation to work a gap. When they send it wide and give the ball air rush defence from Australia snuffs out the danger.  Fiji have the ball back after an Aussie knock-on. 20m out.     8.51pm    Big head clash! Cotter was knocked out there for a second. His head makes sickening contact with Kamikamica\u2019s but it\u2019s the Aussie who comes out worse. His eyes roll back momentarily and he goes limp as his body heads to the ground. He walks of the field but that was nasty.     8.49pm   TRY! Australia 30-4 Fiji (Grant, 54)  Australia have the ball in the red zone because of Grant\u2019s 40-20 so it\u2019s only fitting he has the final say on this move. The ball goes right and then comes back left. Grant runs a wonderful line across the Fijians and gets the ball at pace. He keeps moving left before straightening and darting for the line. No one can lay a hand on him and scores the try that\u2019s subsequently converted.   Updated at 9.05pm BST    8.46pm    53 mins: Better from Fiji. Wong involved in this charge up field. Naiqama as well. They get into Aussie territory and hoist a cross field kick. They can\u2019t come away with the ball but that looks the most likely chance of them working the space. Australia get up the field and win a 40-20 from Grant with a raking kick. Excellent punt.     8.43pm    50 mins: Fijian ball deep in their own territory from a scrum in midfield. Ball goes right. Then left. Wherever it goes there\u2019s at least two Aussies to close down the runner. Fiji going nowhere. Carrigan impressive on defence as well. Fiji have to kick.  Addo-Carr takes it back up field. Holmes moves it pat the 50m line. Carrigan knocks on in the challenge.      8.41pm    Kikau has copped a blow to his head so will go off for some treatment and a check. He does look groggy. Hope he\u2019s OK.     8.40pm    48 mins: How did Australia not score there? Munster is all over this pitch. He gets it on the chrage within striking distance and plays it left to Addo-Carr. You\u2019d have bet the farm on the winger making a dart for the corner but he plays an odd grubber back in field. It almost works as three men in green are waiting but it misses them all and bounces beyond the dead ball line.     8.37pm   TRY! Australia 24-4 Fiji (Mitchell, 45)  Another scorcher of a try with Addo-Carr heavily involved. Munster starts the move and spots space down the blindside. He frees his hands and unleashes Addo-Carr down the wing. The winger screams down the flank and has the vision to play it back inside to Munster who stays in support. Mitchell is on his inside and gets the ball to slide under the posts. Brilliant footy from the champions. So clinical. Two more points from the conversion opens a 20 point gap.   Updated at 9.05pm BST    8.35pm    44 mins: Carrigan, again. My goodness, he\u2019s a battering ram. Australia targeting the middle of the park. They then kick to the corner and put heaps of pressure on the Fijians cleaning up. Moceidreke kicks but doesn\u2019t have any support runners. Australia counter\u2026.     8.33pm    42 mins: Australia get the ball but make an error on the ground. Wighton doesn\u2019t play the ball correctly on the ground so it\u2019s Fiji\u2019s to use. Sadrugu takes it close to the red zone. Turuva, who had a quiet first half, gets on the ball. Koroisau pops it right for Wakeham who kicks through but it catches an Aussie knee and now the ball is with green.  Updated at 8.33pm BST    8.31pm    Right then. They players are back out. Fiji have to score first but even then, Australia just looked so comfortable, they probably have two more gears they could reach. let\u2019s see how they get on.     8.19pm   HALF TIME: Australia 18-4 Fiji  It was a dream start for Fiji who scored a wonderful try with less than five minutes on the clock. But the Kangaroos are the footy kings for a reason. Once they gained their composure they drove it through the middle, kept their defence water tight and found half gaps as they emerged.  Addo-Carr\u2019s blistering 80m try was the standout, but it was more a case of ruthless efficiency that sees the reigning champions take a healthy lead to the break. I\u2019m off to make a quick cuppa. See you in a few.     8.16pm    40 mins: Australia get the ball back after a collision off the ball. Mitchell things he\u2019s scored. But it\u2019s a knock on. Scrappy end to the half.     8.15pm    38 mins: Carrigan is relentless. He\u2019s won just about every collision he\u2019s been involved in. Grant also busting it up through the midfield. Australia handover 10m out on the left. Fiji take it back up through the middle. They can\u2019t find any space out there. The Aussies seem to be defending with an extra man.      8.13pm   TRY! Australian 18-4 Fiji (Crichton, 36)  Carrigan, Micthell, relentless running from Australia. They inch it forward. Mitchell picks it up and plays a wonderfully weighted short ball to Crichton running on the angle. He\u2019s too strong from the tackler on the line and gets over with a stretch of his meaty arm. Just ruthless from the \u2018Roos. Holmes adds the extra two points.     8.10pm    35 mins: Cherry Evans lifts a teasing kick and Munster is underneath it. All he has to do is catch and fall over the line. He gets up but can\u2019t hold it, spilling it as he lands. Another missed opportunity. Great kick from Cherry Evans. It\u2019s slippery out there, that would be his only defence. That and a Fijian proving a legal obstacle.     8.08pm    33 mins: ValemeiSivo gets it in space on the left but can\u2019t punch through the half gap. Tye ball goes right and then left again. Sadrugu is strong in the tacjle. Kikau collects a short flat pass. Wakeham is so close to collecting the kick through, what a poke that was off the toe, but he spills it over the line. Big moment in the game.     8.07pm    31 mins: Valemei does really well collecting a flat pass on the right. A good kick that follows puts Australia under pressure on the right. The kick chasing has been solid from the Fijians. It\u2019s an arm wrestle. Carrigan has the ball after being tackled but spills it as he rolls it through his legs. Knock on. Fijian ball from a great platform.      8.05pm    28 mins: Fiji back on the ball. They look ragged already. But they\u2019re charging into contact with enthusiasm. They reach Aussie territory before hoisting a high kick. Sivo can\u2019t haul it down as Australia gather well under pressure. They launch a counter from deep. Send the ball left and then right, taking to the halfway line before kicking. Fiji run it back into the maw.      8.02pm   TRY! Australia 12-4 Fiji (Addo-Carr, 25)  Coast to coast! Blistering pace from Addo-Carr. He\u2019s been dubbed the fastest man in the game and he\u2019s proved that with a scorching solo effort that began with his heels on his own try line and ended with him dotting down beyond Fiji\u2019s. A poked kick from Fiji was mopped up and swiftly shovelled left where Addo-Carr had a sliver of space. That\u2019s all he needed. He hit the nitro-boosters and screamed up field. What a score. Holmes\u2019 conversion stretches the lead.     Updated at 8.16pm BST    8.00pm    24 mins: Australia\u2019s defensive line speed is so impressive. They\u2019re suffocating Fijian runners before they\u2019ve had time to think. Still, Fiji get up past the halfway line with strong runs. Nakubuwai shakes his man. Tghere\u2019s a great kick through but Tedesco mops up after it bounces off the post.     7.58pm    No try. Nanai did ground the ball over the line but he had already been tackled so the ball was effectively dead already.      7.57pm    21 mins: A good counter run from Wong gets Fiji going forward but they lose the ball again. Cherry-Evans crucial there in the tackle. Tedesco does brilliantly to keep the ball alive by wrestling it away from the Fijians. He offloads and its recycled. Nanai collects against the grain and busts over the line. Has he got it down? he arrived onto that with great pace. Would be a heck of a finish, behind the back, if he has.     7.55pm    19 mins: The restart doesn\u2019t work well for Fiji. They give up a penalty and then get docked a further 10m for arguing with the ref. Australia have the ball back in Fijian territory. Tedesco jinks, Holmes looks for a gap. There\u2019s a cross-kick from right to left. It hangs up in their air, Mitchell is underneath it can\u2019t get hold of it. Australia have the feed to the scrum right in front of the poles. All very scrappy though as Faasuamaleaui can\u2019t collect the pass.     7.52pm   TRY! Australia 6-4 Fiji (Nanai, 16)  That\u2019s more like it. Nanai is a try machine in the NRL ane he gets one here. Collects a flat early pass from Cherry-Evans and steps off his right foot, working a half gap. He accelerates and charges to the poles. It looked simple, but it was anything but. High quality footy made simple. Holmes slots the extras as the \u2018Roos nudge ahead.   Updated at 8.13pm BST    7.49pm    15 mins: Munster sends it left. Faasuamaleaui gets it on the run through the middle. Munster pops a short pass but Australia knock on in the red zone. Mitche;; stepping but can\u2019t offload as he loses his patience.  Fiji slow things down with some short balls in midfield. Kamikamica gets through the challenge. Koroisau makes an error, though, and possession changes again. Both teams a little sloppy.      7.47pm    13 mins: Faasuamaleaui is everywhere. Cherry-Evans is dictating play. The ball goes right. There are numbers and space but, oh, a Fijian, (who was that?) sticks a hand out and steals an intercept. They survive the onslaught. But they cough it up again. Aussie ball. The green wave will be back after this scrum.     7.45pm    No card, but a pen for Australia 1m out in the right corner.     7.44pm    11 mins: A good run back in field from Murray gives the \u2018Roos go fofward. A spinning wide pass from Cherry-Evans finds space on the right. It bcomes back in field and they have a new set og six to play with 5m out. A pass left and then a pass right creates an overlap left. Munster straightens but can\u2019t fund a gap. They\u2019re so close. Taulagi gets it from a Tedesco pass. He\u2019s diving for the line but two Fijians prevent him from dotting down. Great scrambling defence. Could be a card, though, for a high hit.     7.41pm    9 mins: Australia have kick and it\u2019s a good one in the corner. The chase is good too so Fiji scramble to escape. But they do so with composure. Australia are ramping up the tempo. Trbojevic involved in a few heavy charges. Penalty Australia who kick it into touch 10m into Fijian territory. They seem to be waking up.     7.40pm    7 mins: A strong carry from Wakeham from the restart. Fiji take it to the edge of their own territory before they kick. The chase is a good one and the mop up the Aussie counter before it gets going. In fact, Fiji are tackling really well, driving the men in green back in the collision.      7.38pm   TRY! Australia 0-4 Fiji (Valemi, 4)  Sensational! What a start. That is exactly what Fiji needed if they had any hope of winning this one. Fiji drive the ball up and get within striking distance. The shape to go down the open side but it goes left to the blindside instead. Tedesco doesn\u2019t read it and the stabbed kick behind the line by Moceidreke is perfectly mopped up by a diving Valemei who dots down. The conversion is missed. Still, the Aussies look shellshocked.    Updated at 8.06pm BST    7.35pm    2 mins: A decent start for Fiji who get their hands on the ball first. They take it to the half way line and then kick. Australia bring it back to the middle of the field but the phase ends with a Fijian penalty. Impressive tackling as well as from the men in white. They hoof the penalty 10m in to Aussie territory and get things going once again.     7.31pm    Right then. Here. We. GO!     7.29pm    Oh wow! I don\u2019t know what this is called (please someone let me know) but rather than a war dance, the Fijians are standing in a circle, shoulder to shoulder, their eyes are closed, and they\u2019re singing. It\u2019s so moving. Beautiful. It sounds like a hymn but unmistakably from the South Pacific. \u201cHallelujah\u201d they sing. If they play as well as they hold a note they\u2019re steamroll the Kangaroos.   Updated at 7.49pm BST    7.24pm    Not long to go now. Fiji not given much hope by the Beeb pundits. Their head coach Joe Rabele has been hospitalised with illness and there have been some later injury blows. Could be a long, cold night for the Fijians. The teams are coming out the tunnel. The Anthems are underway. Not long to go now.    Updated at 7.51pm BST    7.16pm    Reckon he can do it tonight? Either way, that record will fall over the next five weeks. No doubt about that.      7.12pm    1, 078 days. That\u2019s how long it\u2019s been since the Kangaroos last played a competitive match. That\u2019s partly why they\u2019ve got 13 debutants today. It\u2019s an astounding spell without any action. Could the be rusty?      7.07pm    There are Aussies all over the place in the World Cup. Victor Radley, born in Sydney, was awarded the player of the match award earlier today. France are steered by an Aussie, a man responsible for doing likewise at the Sydney is Roosters. Nick Tedeschi chatted with Trent Robinson this week. Have a gander:      6.55pm    Did you catch the opening ceremony? It was a shambles. The PA system at St James\u2019 Park had packed up. The folks dignitaries responsible for bringing the sizeable trophies onto the pitch were left looking a bit awkward and the Kaiser Chiefs were reduced to just one song.  But these things happen sometimes and it really isn\u2019t the end of the world. Still, the tournament organisers have issued an apology. Fair play to \u2018em.      6.53pm   Fiji hoping to cause an upset  It\u2019s not going to happen. I mean, it really isn\u2019t. Fiji were swatted aside 50-0 by England in a warm-up earlier this month. But hey, stranger things have happened. I\u2019m sure of it. Fiji: Sunia Turuva, Mitieli Vulikijapani, Kevin Naiqama, Semi Valemei, Maika Sivo, Siti Moceidreke, Brandon Wakeham, King Vuniyayawa, Apisai Koroisau, Tui Kamikamica, Viliame Kikau, Siua Wong, Lamar Manuel-Liolevave. Interchanges: Penioni Tagituimua, Jowasa Drodrolagi, Ben Nakubuwai, Taniela Sadrugu, Netane Masima.     6.46pm   Australia name team for title defence  Captain James Tedesco has said that this World Cup will be his team\u2019s \u201ctoughest test\u201d yet. They\u2019re expected to run out comfortable winners against Fiji and have named a formidable outfit to get things underway: Australia: James Tedesco, Josh Addo-Carr, Latrell Mitchell, Valentine Holmes, Murray Taulagi, Cameron Munster, Daly Cherry-Evans, Tino Fa\u2019asuamaleaui, Ben Hunt, Jake Trobojevic, Angus Crichton, Jeremiah Nanai, Cameron Murray. Interchanges: Harry Grant, Reuben Cotter, Patrick Carrigan, Jack Wighton, Matt Burton.   Updated at 7.31pm BST    6.39pm    Did you catch England\u2019s demolition of Samoa earlier? Worth revisiting if you did. The hosts were imperious. Just so, so good.  Here\u2019s Aaron Bower\u2019s report from Newcastle:      6.36pm    Who knew the biggest bugbear would be found on the players\u2019 back? Don\u2019t believe me, go ask the Kangaroos legend Steve Renouf, who wore the No 3 jersey 30 years ago when Australia beat Great Britain in the final in Brisbane, said he was \u201cshattered\u201d (yes, really) that the players would wear squad numbers, rather than the numbers that directly correlated to the match-day starting positions. \u201cImagine starting in the team and getting 24. People would always think you were a reserve,\u201d he told AAP this week. Seems a bit overblown to me. Tell me, what am I missing here? It\u2019s not just Renouf. Even Kangaroos coach Mal Meninga is upset. Wonder if he\u2019ll actually care once the opening whistle sounds.     6.30pm   Preamble  It\u2019s been billed as the most competitive Rugby World Cup in living memory. England are resurgent. New Zealand are a force on the rise. Tonga have shown they can mix it with the big boys and Samoa, despite the events of a few hours ago, have enough stars to cause an upset along the way. The Kangaroos, the defending champions, will be eager to squash all that talk and underline their status as the most successful rugby league team in the world. They\u2019re without some players who might have been with them but they\u2019re still the side to beat. Fiji won\u2019t be a pushover, physically at least, and should provide a stern test of Mal Meninga\u2019s charges. My name is Daniel and it\u2019d be great if you dropped me an email or shot me a tweet. Kick off is at 7:30pm local time.   "

                    "body": "England\u2019s advance to the T20 World Cup final is evidence that in an era of data-driven decisions, when eagle-eyed analysts search for even the most distant statistical advantage, there is still a place for simple intuition. And that Jos Buttler\u2019s tends to be on point. \u201cYou can look at numbers till the cows come home really, in this day and age,\u201d England\u2019s captain says. \u201cBut I think \u2018the feel\u2019 on the day is a really important part of it.\u201d Buttler\u2019s instincts are proving well honed and, though England\u2019s performances have not always been as overwhelming as in the semi-final against India, his success rate has been impressive.  Against New Zealand, for example, he ripped up England\u2019s bowling plans on a hunch. \u201cI came off having batted and thought Moeen Ali should bowl the first over. I didn\u2019t think that leading into the game,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to see what\u2019s in front of you and then trust your instincts.\u201d Moeen had not bowled at all in the tournament; his over went for just four. England\u2019s last three games, all won, have seen more regular, and more surprising, bowling changes. Moeen says that a key difference between Buttler and his predecessor is that \u201cunder Morgs [Eoin Morgan] you had more of a set plan about who was going to bowl\u201d. Chris Woakes says that as a bowler under Buttler \u201cyou never know what\u2019s going to happen\u201d. After a look at the Adelaide Oval pitch before that semi-final Buttler upended England\u2019s plan to bat first if they won the toss. \u201cI think the majority of us were thinking: \u2018It\u2019s a great wicket, let\u2019s go out and put a statement out there,\u2019\u201d said England\u2019s coach, Matthew Mott. \u201cAnd he was really clear. He consulted and then he said: \u2018No, I think this is our best chance of winning.\u2019 And it proved a masterstroke.\u201d  Except when he has a bat in his hands, Buttler does not seem an obvious leader. He speaks quietly and lacks the fiery charisma that is evident in Morgan, his close friend and predecessor as white-ball captain. His first weeks in the role, which coincided with a downturn in results and performances, were not exactly encouraging. \u201cThe team lost a bit of its mojo and a little bit of its swagger \u2013 and that happens when you have changes of leadership at times,\u201d Mott admitted. But over the course of this tournament, in games and in conversations with those in and around the team, a picture of Buttler\u2019s leadership has started to emerge. It is a combination of match-day improvisation and methodical attention to detail in preparation. Ben Stokes came into the squad for the World Cup having not played a T20 for England in 18 months and feeling some uncertainty about his position in a very settled side. \u201cWhen we got here, before we\u2019d even had a training session, he sat me down for five or 10 minutes and just said: \u2018This is your role, this is what I want you to do,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat 10-minute chat just made me really understand the way in which I can affect the game.\u201d Chris Jordan\u2019s problem was precisely the opposite: he had played in 72 of England\u2019s 75 T20s between the start of 2016 and the end of this summer, but as the World Cup started \u2013 and until Mark Wood\u2019s injury thrust him back into the side for the semi-finals \u2013 he found himself on the sidelines.  \u201cThe communication was always crystal clear,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen guys come on as a sub fielder and really have an impact on the game, that goes to show the headspace everyone\u2019s been in. I think one of his greatest strengths is really being in the moment, and thinking outside the box.\u201d Mott said: \u201cHe does a lot of talking to players, one-on-one or in and around training, so there\u2019s clarity on their individual role. Yes, he is very softly spoken, but I think one of the things about Jos is when he speaks, people listen. He doesn\u2019t waste his words, he saves his messages and he\u2019s on point most of the time.\u201d Buttler may have nearly 20 years of captaincy experience, going back to his days in Somerset\u2019s under-13s, but that still amounts to only 55 games. Morgan, almost exactly four years older, has captained 363 times. The team\u2019s run to Sunday\u2019s final against Pakistan at Melbourne\u2019s MCG, suggests that for all the lost experience there has been no long-term loss of momentum. \u201cI certainly feel more comfortable in the role as it goes on,\u201d Buttler says. \u201cAs frustrating as the summer was in terms of results, I actually learned a lot through that period, with the benefit of having a few months to kind of reflect on things I probably would have done differently. I feel I\u2019m growing into the role day by day.\u201d"

                    "body": "  5.32pm    That\u2019s all from Clockwatch until after Christmas, when the Premier League resumes. A reminder that Will Magee is following Newcastle United v Chelsea right now, just for you, while I\u2019ll be back later for Wolves v Arsenal, a match that has serious consequences at both ends of the table. Thanks for reading!      5.30pm    Nottingham Forest 1-0 Crystal Palace. Forest won\u2019t be bottom at Christmas thanks to another narrow win at the City Ground.      5.29pm    On Sky, Everton defender Conor Coady is asked about Bournemouth\u2019s second goal, about which he wasn\u2019t particularly happy at the time. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it \u2026 we speak about referees every game, but I\u2019m certainly not going to do that when we\u2019ve just put on a performance like that against Bournemouth \u2026 our performance was nowhere near good enough, nothing that represents Everton Football Club \u2026 one hard look in the mirror for every single one of us \u2026 we have to set standards \u2026 it can\u2019t be anything to do with the manager, it\u2019s up to us as players to set standards and have personal pride in what we do every day \u2026 we don\u2019t have that at the minute \u2026 we have to be better \u2026 we can\u2019t go into the second half of the season like that.\u201d     5.23pm    Bournemouth 3-0 Everton. According to Sue Smith on Sky Sports, the brouhaha between fans and players began when Alex Iwobi handed his shirt to somebody in the crowd, only for it to be thrown back. Cue unpleasantness. The relationship between players, manager and fans not ideal at the moment.      5.16pm    West Ham United 0-2 Leicester City. James Maddison limped off, while West Ham were booed off. Jacob Steinberg was there.      5.12pm    Liverpool 3-1 Southampton. Andy Hunter watched both teams play well, Liverpool\u2019s two World Cup-bound South Americans, Uruguay\u2019s Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez and Brazil\u2019s Alisson, making the difference.      5.11pm    Tottenham Hotspur 4-3 Leeds United. Nick Ames was in north London for the match of the day.      5.10pm    Post-match postbag. \u201cFully expect Lampard and Moyes to swap clubs over the World Cup break. Would make much more sense for both of them\u201d \u2013 Alexander Lewis \u201cThey may as well give Celtic the league trophy already, so it\u2019s all about the other end of the table in the Scottish Premier League. Talking of which, it\u2019s a six o\u2019clock kick off at Pittodrie tonight where Dundee United will need all three points to avoid going into the World Cup break propping up the table. A win would actually take United above both Kilmarnock and Ross County and into tenth place on goal difference, having been rooted to the bottom all season. If that\u2019s not an incentive I don\u2019t know what is. Come on you Terrors!\u201d \u2013 Simon McMahon \u201cMilly is on for his 600th Premier League appearance. Why are you writing about anything else?\u201d \u2013 Marie Meyer     5.07pm   Scottish Premiership full-times   Celtic 2-1 Ross County Heart of Midlothian 1-1 Livingston Kilmarnock 1-0 Hibernian St Johnstone 1-1 Motherwell St Mirren 1-1 Rangers      5.06pm   Championship full-times   Bristol City 0-0 Watford Cardiff City 0-1 Sheffield United Coventry City 2-0 QPR Huddersfield Town 0-0 Swansea City Hull City 1-2 Reading Luton Town 1-1 Rotherham United Norwich City 1-2 Middlesbrough Preston North End 2-4 Millwall West Bromwich Albion 2-0 Stoke City Wigan Athletic 2-1 Blackpool      5.05pm   Premier League full-times   Bournemouth 3-0 Everton Liverpool 3-1 Southampton Manchester City 1-2 Brentford Nottingham Forest 1-0 Crystal Palace Tottenham Hotspur 4-3 Leeds United West Ham United 0-2 Leicester City      5.04pm    A rare old brouhaha at Dean Court! Everton\u2019s defeated players go over to applaud what remains of the travelling support. The Evertonians in the stand tell them what\u2019s what, in the full and (yes) frank style. Seamus Coleman doesn\u2019t look happy with them. Neither does Jordan Pickford. More shock at the level and ferocity of the abuse they\u2019re copping, rather than anger \u2026 at least by the looks of it. Both are ushered away by Frank Lampard, desperately trying to pour oil on troubled waters. An Everton shirt is flung onto the pitch in disgust. Jeers. It\u2019s going to be a long journey home for both team and fans.     5.00pm    FULL TIME: Celtic 2-1 Ross County. Celtic tear nine points clear of Rangers at the top, and it looks very ominous for Giovanni van Bronckhorst.     4.58pm   FULL TIME: Bournemouth 3-0 Everton  It\u2019s 7-1 to the Cherries if you fold in the midweek League Cup result. Real danger for Frank Lampard now, with Everton fourth from bottom and just one point outside the relegation zone.     4.56pm   FULL TIME: West Ham United 0-2 Leicester City  Big problems now for David Moyes. Leicester by contrast have totally recovered from their cold start to the season, sitting comfortably in mid-table. Also sitting comfortably: James Maddison, who was spotted in the dugout laughing and smiling, so hopefully his injury scare is nothing serious. Fingers crossed for England.     4.55pm   FULL TIME: Nottingham Forest 1-0 Crystal Palace  Forest hang on, and they\u2019re off the bottom of the table, leapfrogging Wolves and Southampton into 18th place!     4.54pm   FULL TIME: Liverpool 3-1 Southampton  Darwin Nunez leaves for the World Cup with a standing ovation ringing in his ears. Nathan Jones knows he\u2019s got plenty of work to do.     4.53pm   FULL TIME: Tottenham Hotspur 4-3 Leeds United  Another fantastic second-half showing from Spurs. \u201cThis Tottenham team walks perfectly the fine line between being truly pathetic to utter delirium with glorious chaos,\u201d writes Yash Gupta. \u201cThis team might just be the most Tottenham team of this century.\u201d     4.51pm    Fans of West Ham and Everton are streaming out of their respective stadiums in huge numbers. A lot of pressure on David Moyes and Frank Lampard now. The World Cup break coming up at exactly the wrong or right time, depending on which way you look at it.     4.46pm   RED CARD! Tyler Adams (Leeds United)  A second bookable offence for the Qatar-bound USA international, and an extremely promising afternoon for Leeds has turned sour very quickly.     4.43pm   GOAL! Tottenham Hotspur 4-3 Leeds United (Bentancur 83)  Two in two minutes for Bentancur! Dejan Kulusevski with the elegant assist, drawing the keeper and teeing up his teammate. Leeds \u2013 who won 4-3 last weekend \u2013 are nothing if not entertaining.     4.40pm   GOAL! Tottenham Hotspur 3-3 Leeds United (Bentancur 81)  \u201cLeeds take the lead for the third time this afternoon! Can they hold onto it this time?\u201d No.   Updated at 4.43pm GMT    4.39pm   GOAL! West Ham United 0-2 Leicester City (Barnes 78)  Harvey Barnes doubles Leicester\u2019s lead at the London Stadium, and add David Moyes to the list of managers who have a bit of work on their hands.   Updated at 4.46pm GMT    4.38pm    Bournemouth have had the ball in the net again. Dominic Solanke sends a forensic shot into the bottom corner, but he was flagged offside. Everton are a rabble, and for the second time in four days, their fans are fuming in the Dean Court stands.     4.37pm   GOAL! Tottenham Hotspur 2-3 Leeds United (Rodrigo 76)  It\u2019s five in four games for Rodrigo, who finishes a counter by flashing a shot past Hugo Lloris. There\u2019s a VAR check for a foul on Rodrigo Bentancur on the halfway line, but nothing doing. Leeds take the lead for the third time this afternoon! Can they hold onto it this time?     4.35pm    Speaking of troubled managers, here\u2019s Giovanni van Bronckhorst in the wake of Rangers\u2019 1-1 draw at St Mirren: \u201cWe are going to sit down [with the board], that is for sure, and speak about the last couple of months and which way to go forward.\u201d Oh dear. You know how these things so often pan out.     4.34pm   GOAL! Bournemouth 3-0 Everton (Anthony 69)  A free kick slung into the Everton box. Jaidon Anthony is totally, completely, utterly unmarked. In goes the header, and out pumps the steam from Jordan Pickford\u2019s lugs. Everton are in trouble. Frank Lampard is in trouble.     4.32pm    James Milner comes on for Liverpool at Anfield. It\u2019s his 600th Premier League appearance.      4.28pm    GOAL! Celtic 2-1 Ross County (Haksabanovic 68). Sead Haksabanovic one-twos with Reo Hatate and Ange Postecoglu\u2019s side will go nine points clear tonight if things stay the same. Gio\u2019s Peg-o-meter\u2122 rating: super shoogly.     4.24pm    GOAL! Celtic 1-1 Ross County (Turnbull 62). The Scottish champions are back on terms at Parkhead thanks to David Turnbull. Big 30 minutes coming up. Should Celtic find a winner, the nine-point lead at the top could prove problematic for the career prospects of Rangers boss Giovanni van Bronckhorst.     4.18pm    Another Leicester midfielder goes off under a World Cup injury cloud. Youri Tielemans is replaced by Wilfred Ndidi, and that\u2019s a worry for Belgium.     4.15pm   GOAL! Nottingham Forest 1-0 Crystal Palace (Gibbs-White 54)  Morgan Gibbs-White trundles home from close range. He celebrates. He stops. There\u2019s a long VAR check for offside \u2026 an interminable wait \u2026 finally the green line is drawn \u2026 the referee takes another minute to notice \u2026 and eventually the goal is awarded. Forest lead! They\u2019ll be off the bottom tonight as things stand!   Updated at 4.22pm GMT    4.11pm   GOAL! Tottenham Hotspur 2-2 Leeds United (Davies 51)  Another game, another Spurs second-half comeback? Ben Davies levels in short order. Not a great start to the second half for Leeds, though it could have been worse, Marc Roca fortunate not to walk after studding Eric Dier with a late one.   Updated at 4.14pm GMT    4.10pm    GOAL! Celtic 0-1 Ross County (Cancola 50 pen). A shock lead for the Staggies at Celtic Park! Matt O\u2019Riley penalised for handball in the area. David Cancola converts from 12 yards.     4.05pm    Here\u2019s how the Premier League table looks at half-time. Take it very seriously.      3.59pm   Scottish Premiership half-times   Celtic 0-0 Ross County Heart of Midlothian 0-0 Livingston Kilmarnock 0-0 Hibernian St Johnstone 1-1 Motherwell St Mirren 1-1 Rangers (FT)      3.58pm   Championship half-times   Bristol City 0-0 Watford Cardiff City 0-0 Sheffield United Coventry City 1-0 QPR Huddersfield Town 0-0 Swansea City Hull City 1-1 Reading Luton Town 0-1 Rotherham United Norwich City 1-0 Middlesbrough Preston North End 2-2 Millwall West Bromwich Albion 1-0 Stoke City Wigan Athletic 0-1 Blackpool      3.53pm   Premier League half-times   Bournemouth 2-0 Everton Liverpool 3-1 Southampton Nottingham Forest 0-0 Crystal Palace Tottenham Hotspur 1-2 Leeds United West Ham United 0-1 Leicester City      3.47pm   GOAL! Liverpool 3-1 Southampton (Nunez 42)  A second goal for Darwin Nunez, who slides in an Andy Robertson cross. A ninth goal of the season for the big Uruguayan.   Updated at 3.50pm GMT    3.45pm   GOAL! Tottenham Hotspur 1-2 Leeds United (Rodrigo 43)  Spurs would appear addicted to falling behind. Rodrigo slams an unstoppable volley home, and yet another big half-time teamtalk is coming up for Antonio Conte.   Updated at 3.49pm GMT    3.43pm    A couple of penalties! And they\u2019re both missed! Forest\u2019s Joe Worrall brings down Palace\u2019s Wilfried Zaha at the City Ground, while West Ham\u2019s Craig Dawson slides in on Leicester\u2019s Patson Daka at the London Stadium. Zaha steps up and \u2026 hits the post and misses! Can Youri Tielemans score his spot kick? Nope! Fabianski saves! What a business!     3.40pm    West Ham get the ball into the net at the London Stadium \u2026 but it won\u2019t count. Tomas Soucek whistles a shot into the bottom corner, but Jarrod Bowen was miles off earlier in the move.     3.38pm    It\u2019s also still goalless at Parkhead between Celtic and Ross County. The Staggies could do under-pressure Giovanni van Bronckhorst a solid if they get anything this afternoon, limiting the damage of Rangers\u2019 draw at St Mirren. A long, long way to go for that. Celtic will go nine points clear at the top if they win as expected.     3.35pm    A lucky break for Tyrick Mitchell at the City Ground? The Palace full back takes down Forest\u2019s Jesse Lingard just outside the box. Last man? Perhaps. But Joachim Anderson was in the immediate environs, and his presence limits the damage to yellow. Nothing comes of the resulting free kick. It\u2019s still goalless.     3.33pm    Worrying news for England at the London Stadium. James Maddison feels something at the back of his knee, and he\u2019s replaced by Dennis Praet. Hopefully that\u2019s precautionary, else it\u2019s World Cup heartbreak for Maddison, who has been in sensational form of late.      3.31pm   GOAL! Tottenham Hotspur 1-1 Leeds United (Kane 25)  They were so close to going two down again, for the fifth Premier League match in a row \u2026 but Spurs have snapped that miserable sequence! Harry Kane predictably is your man. But there\u2019s some controversy: was Illan Meslier fouled as he attempted to punch clear? There was contact, but referee and VAR agree: not enough. Level in N17!   Updated at 3.36pm GMT    3.28pm   GOAL! Bournemouth 2-0 Everton (Moore 25)  Kieffer Moore powers home a header \u2013 great news for Wales going into the World Cup \u2013 and the way things are going, Everton are slipping towards another relegation battle.   Updated at 3.35pm GMT    3.26pm   GOAL! Liverpool 2-1 Southampton (Nunez 21)  Harvey Elliott dinks. Darwin Nunez volleys. Liverpool retake the lead at Anfield.   Updated at 3.32pm GMT    3.25pm    Spurs have gone 2-0 down in each of their last four Premier League matches. For the record, that\u2019s against Manchester United, Newcastle United, Bournemouth and Liverpool. Throw in a 2-0 midweek loss at Nottingham Forest, and it\u2019s quite absurd really. Anyway, they nearly make it five matches on the bounce, but Hugo Lloris stays big to foil Crysencio Summerville. It remains just 1-0 to Leeds.     3.20pm   GOAL! Bournemouth 1-0 Everton (Tavernier 18)   Dominic Solanke shoots! Jordan Pickford parries! Marcus Tavernier scores! Trouble for Frank Lampard continues to pile up.  Updated at 3.25pm GMT    3.16pm    There was a problem for West Ham defender Kurt Zouma during the warm-up. He was pressed into action anyway, but has just gone down with nobody around him, and won\u2019t be able to continue. A knee problem. Nayef Aguerd comes on for his debut.  Updated at 3.17pm GMT    3.13pm   GOAL! Tottenham Hotspur 0-1 Leeds United (Summerville 10)  The hero of the Bournemouth comeback strikes again. Also to be filed under \u2018again\u2019\u2019: Spurs starting slowly. This is becoming a big problem, isn\u2019t it.   Updated at 3.19pm GMT    3.11pm   GOAL! Liverpool 1-1 Southampton (Adams 9)  The first goal of the Nathan Jones era at Saints has been scored by Che Adams! He heads home as Alisson comes out to claim a ball he doesn\u2019t reach. Saints on terms in double-quick time!   Updated at 3.15pm GMT    3.10pm   GOAL! West Ham United 0-1 Leicester City (Maddison 8)  James Maddison starts an attack and finishes it, roofing from close range. The man\u2019s on fire at the moment.   Updated at 3.17pm GMT    3.07pm   GOAL! Liverpool 1-0 Southampton (Firmino 6)  \u2026 so having said that, Roberto Firmino flicks a header into the far corner, and Nathan Jones has a job on all right.   Updated at 3.13pm GMT    3.06pm    No significant early action \u2026 but there are reports of fast starts by no less than four of the five Premier League away sides. Southampton, Leeds, Leicester and Everton all on the front foot early doors.     3.02pm    A pause to commemorate the fallen. The Last Post. Solemn reflection. Then the 3pm matches kick off around the country.     2.59pm    Brentford\u2019s unexpected win hasn\u2019t just affected the title race. It\u2019s also sent the Bees into the top half, for a couple of hours at the very least. Crystal Palace can leapfrog back into the top ten themselves with a point at Nottingham Forest, but the bigger point for Brentford would stand: they go into the World Cup break full of confidence, a comfortable mid-table concern rather than one nervously looking over their shoulder at the relegation places. Here\u2019s how the full Premier League table looks as the 3pm kick-offs heave into view.      2.51pm    More on that shock 2-1 win for Brentford at the home of champions Manchester City. Jamie Jackson was at the Etihad, and his report is in. Here you go!      2.49pm    Jurgen Klopp won\u2019t be in the dugout at Anfield against Southampton today, having been handed a one-game touchline ban for his linesman-bothering antics against Manchester City. He\u2019s had a word to say about the timing of the decision, telling Sky: \u201cMy situation is clear since yesterday afternoon, which is really late. It is not cool, let me say it like this. I expected the outcome, but to say then \u2018for tomorrow\u2019 is a bit harsh, but it\u2019s how it is.\u201d A calm and measured fume, at the risk of sounding contradictory.     2.42pm    Well, well, well. Well, well, well, well, well, well, well.     2.39pm   FULL TIME: Manchester City 1-2 Brentford  Ivan Toney didn\u2019t get the nod from Gareth Southgate. So having been told he\u2019s not going to Qatar with England, there was only one way to respond. Look what he\u2019s done to the title race! David Tindall has the details.  Arsenal will go into the World Cup break five clear if they win at Wolves this evening. No pressure, Mikel.   Updated at 3.03pm GMT    2.35pm    Giovanni van Bronckhorst\u2019s blazer was already hanging on a shoogly peg, but now look: FULL TIME: St Mirren 1-1 Rangers. It could have been worse for the Light Blues, too; they needed VAR to intervene to award a late penalty that James Tavernier converted with seven minutes to go. Jonah Ayunga had given the Saints the lead just after the break by slotting from close range, Rangers failing to deal with a garden-variety long throw. Two-in-a-row for Ange Postecoglu\u2019s side looks in the bag already. Oh Gio.      2.27pm    Liverpool make ten changes to the team selected for the League Cup win over Derby. Joe Gomez is the only player to retain his place. He deputises for Ibrahima Konate, who has picked up a minor knock. Exciting wing prospect Ben Doak, 17 yesterday, is on the bench, while Jordan Henderson misses out for personal reasons. Southampton are under new management. Nathan Jones makes three changes from the 4-1 defeat to Newcastle, calling up Duje Caleta-Car, Romeo Lavia and Adam Armstrong. Theo Walcott and Ainsley Maitland-Niles drop to the bench.     2.22pm    West Ham name the same starting XI selected for the 2-1 home defeat to Crystal Palace. Declan Rice, rested for the Carabao Cup defeat by Blackburn Rovers, returns to the midfield. Leicester make one change to the XI sent out at Goodison Park last weekend, and it\u2019s enforced. Luke Thomas comes in for poor James Justin, who picked up another long-term injury in the League Cup tie against Newport.     2.17pm    Tottenham welcome back the fully fit pair of Dejan Kulusevski and Richarlison to their starting XI. Hugo Lloris, Emerson Royal, Ben Davies and Rodrigo Bentancur are also recalled in the wake of the League Cup defeat at Forest. Leeds give Wilfried Gnonto his full debut. Liam Cooper, Rodrigo and Crysencio Summerville are recalled, but Jack Harrison is missing.     2.14pm    Nottingham Forest make five changes after their successful midweek Carabao Cup caper against Spurs. Dean Henderson, Morgan Gibbs-White, Brennan Johnson, Cheikhou Kouyate and Remo Freuler return. Crystal Palace name the same starting XI that did for West Ham United at the London Stadium last Sunday. Odsonne Edouard returns from injury and takes up a place on the bench.     2.10pm    Bournemouth make a couple of changes to the starting XI named for the 4-3 defeat at Leeds last Saturday. Chris Mepham is suspended so Jack Stephens takes his place, while Jordan Zemura steps up as Ryan Fredericks drops to the bench. Everton also make two changes after losing 2-0 at home to Leicester. Nathan Patterson replaces benched club captain Seamus Coleman at right back, while up front Neal Maupay stands in for the injured Dominic Calvert-Lewin.

                    "body": "\u201cLa Roja ejected, Regragui\u2019s Lions are definite legends,\u201d read the headline in Le Matin, while L\u2019Opinion spoke of a night of \u201cimmense joy in the streets of Rabat\u201d, both Morocco-based newspapers perfectly summing up the country\u2019s stunning victory over Spain in the last-16 of the World Cup.\nAs was the case in the group stages, Morocco\u2019s defensive line held firm on Tuesday and ultimately the fixture against the 2010 world champions at Education City Stadium became an intriguing and enthralling chess match between the head coaches, Luis Enrique and Walid Regragui. The latter ended the day victorious, taking the Atlas Lions to the quarter-finals of the World Cup for the first time, a feat greeted with emphatically enthusiastic and congratulatory media reaction.\n\u201cRegragui and the Lions have trained the Spanish Toro,\u201d said ElBotola.com, while Hespress.com singled out Morocco\u2019s goalkeeper, Yassine Bounou, describing him as \u201cthe one who broke the tactic of a thousand penalty kicks\u201d in reference to Luis Enrique\u2019s words about the need necessity for every Spanish player to have practised \u201cat least 1,000 penalties\u201d before joining La Roja\u2019s squad in Doha.\n\nLe360.ma, meanwhile, tracked the movements of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation president, Fouzi Lekjaa, as he watched on at Education City, noting that he had kicked every ball and reacted to every game phase. He celebrated victory by embracing his neighbouring spectator, Patrice Motsepe, the Confederation of African Football president.\nThe US-based MoroccoWorldNews.com reported on how \u201csome fans chose to celebrate the Atlas Lions by beeping car horns, while others were shouting \u2018Morocco\u2019 through their windows and balconies to share their excitement\u201d. There were also tales of King Mohammed VI leading celebrations in the streets of Rabat, wearing a national team jersey and waving to passers-by through his car\u2019s window. \u201cKing Mohammed VI held a phone call with Fouzi Lekjaa and head coach Walid Regragui, expressing his sincere congratulations to the national team and technical staff.\u201d\n\nMake no mistake, the game inspired a level of joy that Moroccans have not felt for a long time. But it is also a joy that came after plenty of sacrifices and suffering. Le Matin quoted the midfielder Sofyan Amrabat, who endured back pain the entire night before the game. \u201cI was up until three in the morning with the physiologist. I didn\u2019t know if I was going to play,\u201d he said. \u201cI just knew I couldn\u2019t let the boys and my country down.\u201d This was also a success forged in humility, summed up by Bounou\u2019s reaction after he had been awarded the man of the match trophy. \u201cThe penalties, it\u2019s a bit of intuition, a bit of luck,\u201d the Sevilla goalkeeper was quoted as saying by the Casablanca-based newspaper. \u201cWe won and that\u2019s the most important.\u201d\nPerhaps the most memorable quote from Morocco\u2019s entire World Cup campaign has come from Regragui. Before playing Belgium in the group stages, the head coach asked for \u201cnational unity\u201d, asking all Moroccans to have \u201cniya\u201d (good faith). \u201cThe energy plays a role in football,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen people are in good faith, the ball will hit the bar and enter. And vice versa, if some are saying: \u2018Look at this avocado head, he talks too much,\u2019 and show bad faith, the ball would hit the bar and go out.\u201d\nThe message has been widely shared on social media and, on Tuesday, was attached to images of Pablo Sarabia\u2019s last-gasp chance for Spain that hit the post and deflected out. Good faith, indeed."

                    "body": "People don\u2019t generally attend the AGMs of international sporting bodies if they are looking for drama. Consensus, backslapping and forelock tugging are usually the order of the day. But Fifa\u2019s Congress in Doha this week took place in a period of unique political volatility and disruption duly followed. On Thursday Lise Klaveness, the president of the Norwegian Football Federation, stood in front of Gianni Infantino, the president of Fifa, the head of Qatar\u2019s Supreme Committee, Hassan al-Thawadi, and more than 250 other \u2013 almost entirely male \u2013 football bigwigs and told them they needed to do more. More to help migrant workers in Qatar, more to protect LGBTQ+ supporters at the World Cup, more to make the global game welcoming to all.  Immediately she was told her remarks were \u201cnot football\u201d by the speaker who followed her, and Thawadi suggested she needed to \u201ceducate\u201d herself better on the progress made in Qatar. But Klaveness says she is clear on what has been achieved before the World Cup and what needs to be done. \u201cWe have met [Thawadi], we have educated ourselves, we\u2019ve had very good meetings,\u201d she tells the Guardian. \u201cThey are welcoming, they try to inform us, they try to show us how many changes they\u2019ve made and we believe them. But it\u2019s our job to push further. \u201cOur members [in the Norwegian FA] have asked that we follow up, that we should pressure for real implementation. The kafala system going away, minimum pay, acts that protect against heat stress and give a break in the day, all these are very good legislative changes, but we hear from Amnesty, from Building and Wood Workers\u2019 International, from many organisations, that they can still be improved. Now it\u2019s our task to push more because the spotlight from the World Cup can be effective and we have to use it.\u201d Norway has been perhaps the most outspoken of all football nations about concerns over hosting the World Cup in Qatar. But in a vote, federation members stopped short of calling for a boycott. Instead they chose to participate and push for change. The country is not as radical in its ambitions as some of its critics (or supporters) paint it and Klaveness insists it involves accepting limitations on what football can and should hope to achieve. \u201cOf course we have an ethical responsibility,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I do think that the biggest strength of football is that it can be played anywhere by anyone. So it should be a place where both left- and right-wing players can play, both politically and literally. I do think it\u2019s very important that we do not become activists ourselves.\u201d  Making demands of Qatar is further complicated by the fact that no human rights considerations were made in awarding the World Cup. \u201cWe are very firm about having our own values at the core of whatever we do but it requires a due-diligence process about awarding championships,\u201d Klaveness says. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to judge any country; I think it\u2019s very important to have football everywhere. I also think it\u2019s important that Fifa and all the federations speak to the values, that we speak about the game being for all.\u201d A female leader in men\u2019s football, and one who is also gay, Klaveness is a rarity and she is serious about change. In her speech she spoke about her \u201cdream\u201d of football where \u201cboys and girls of all colours, straights and queers, are treated with equal respect and recognitions\u201d. But she also observes that this equality should mean the freedom to be treated as just another participant in the game. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that your daughter can see professional women at the top of the pyramid, because if we want to have girls who really dream and have ambition in football then they need to see role models,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it\u2019s also true that if the structure is such that there are so few exceptions they will most often speak in the newspaper about equality issues and not about football. I imagine half the interviews with women footballers will be done on equality matters and not on the football itself. This is no one\u2019s fault, it\u2019s how it\u2019s always been, but little girls will see this and it will not engage them in the same way. We should try to address that.\u201d  Norway\u2019s men\u2019s team did not qualify for the World Cup but the country\u2019s prospects are improving on the pitch and in Erling Haaland and Ada Hegerberg they have two of the leading stars in the world game. Klaveness is hopeful that they can point a way to a brighter future where ethics in sport need not be an afterthought. \u201cIn Norway we should not hit our chests with our football performances,\u201d she says. \u201cOn the men\u2019s side we have not been in a championship for 20 years [since Euro 2000] and on the women\u2019s side there are so many countries coming up that we should have a humble approach. But I\u2019m very proud of Ada Martine Stolsmo Hegerberg and Erling Braut Haaland because they are excellent players but also very good people. I\u2019m very proud of the generation that we have now.\u201d"

                    "body": "OH RANGERS!\nIbrox is full of history. You only have to look at the intricate red-brick facade of the Bill Struth Main Stand to realise that the place is steeped in the stuff. The first match was played there in 1899 for goodness sake \u2013 which makes it even older than TikTok, kids. Fans have witnessed more than 100 domestic trophies paraded around the place in the time since and some might even have been lucky enough to see Frank Sinatra and Billy Joel warble their way into the grand old ground\u2019s rich tapestry of momentous events in the 1990s. Everybody loves a bit of history. Unless it\u2019s the bad stuff.\nWhich brings us to Tuesday night and the 50,000 or so hardy folk who trooped out to see their side handed a sixth Big Cup group-stage shoeing in a row (OK they only lost 2-0 at Anfield but we\u2019ve set off on this path now and we\u2019re sticking to it). The 3-1 loss to Ajax confirmed Giovanni van Bronkhorst\u2019s side as the worst-ever in Big Cup group-stage history. Yep, even worse than Blackburn Rovers in 1995-96 \u2013 and they were mostly fighting each other. Rangers\u2019 results read: 0-4, 0-3, 0-2, 1-7, 0-3, 1-3. That\u2019s 22 goals against! Thirteen at home! In three matches! It took them 38 league games of the 2020-21 season to concede 13 at home and away \u2013 and defensive mastermind Steven Gerrard was in charge back then.\nIt says a fair bit about the state of the Scottish Premiership. It\u2019s hard to expect Rangers to rise up from facing \u2013 sorry, St Mirren \u2013 St Mirren one week to Napoli the next and handle it well. It also makes their Big Vase run last season seem like a fever dream. There weren\u2019t many of the 50,000 or so left at Ibrox to witness the final whistle being blown on this stain in the record books. Most of them had already sent their jeers cascading down the steep stands before heading for home. Perhaps they could have been saved the infamy of being given six consecutive wedgies had Antonio Colak hoiked his shot at the crossbar, Ronny Rosenthal-style, instead of into the empty net when they beat PSV in the playoffs back in August. \u201cIt has been a difficult learning curve for us,\u201d sighed midfielder Steven Davis with spectacular understatement. \u201cBut we need to try to learn from it and improve, but also park it and concentrate on our domestic competitions now.\u201d\nIf Rangers fans want a quick pick-me-up they could start by watching Celtic (P5 W0 D2 L3 F3 A10) take on Real Madrid at the Bernab\u00e9u later on. Madrid haven\u2019t yet won the group so will be hungry to get the job done. The last time Celtic played there (March 1980), Madrid waltzed to a 3-0 win. Celtic might take that given they played well and lost by the same scoreline at home in August. Whatever happens, though, Celtic will finish bottom and Scottish football will continue to wear Big Cup like an oversized coat that it keeps getting tangled in.\nRIP RONNIE RADFORD\nRonnie Radford, whose thunderous strike for Hereford on the quagmire of Edgar Street against Newcastle remains one of the greatest FA Cup moments, has died aged 79. Television footage of Radford\u2019s equaliser in the 2-1 third-round win in February 1972 has become one of the competition\u2019s most treasured and repeated scenes. \u201cWe are devastated to hear of Ronnie\u2019s passing, and wish to extend our deepest condolences to his family and friends at this very sad time,\u201d read a Hereford statement. \u201cRonnie is not just a part of Hereford United folklore, he is a part of football history and has kept Hereford on the football map since 1972.\u201d\n\n\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\n\u201cWe realise now that a link can be made between this advertisement and the appalling working conditions in Qatar and that was never our intention. We deeply regret this and offer our sincere apologies\u201d \u2013 the penny finally drops for Dutch supermarket chain Jumbo, who have scrapped a tone-deaf TV advert linked to the Human Rights World Cup that included scenes showing people dancing on scaffolding at a building site. In case they need further reminding.\n\nLIVE ON BIG WEBSITE\nDaniel Harris is on deck for all of the evening\u2019s Big Cup action at 8pm GMT, while Scott Murray will also have Real Madrid 4-0 Celtic MBM updates from 5.45pm.\nFIVER LETTERS\n\u201cI have admiration and respect for all your correspondents who are willing to boycott the HR World Cup (Fiver letters passim). But I also have to acknowledge that, as a signed up Fiver reader, I am a shiftless, indolent, half-hearted-at-all-times kind of older bloke (just ask my long-suffering boss). So the idea that I am going to be principled enough to ignore wall-to-wall football during the grimy winter months when the cost of living is reducing me to penury is utterly absurd. Still, if it wasn\u2019t so much effort, I would take my hat off to the more principled members of our community\u201d \u2013 Colin Reed.\n\u201cWith all the concern by Fiver readers and other concerned members of society about watching the HRWC, here\u2019s a suggestion that allows us to watch the beautiful game, assuage some guilt, and support a good cause. Keep track of how many matches you watch during the tournament and for each match you watch, donate an amount you\u2019re comfortable with to a human rights charity (suggestions welcome). For example, if you watch 10 matches and you decide to commit to \u20ac5/$5/\u00a35 per match (or pick your local currency) then at the end donate more to the charity of your choice\u201d \u2013 Jason Loeb.\n\u201cRe: \u2018Who throws focaccia?\u2019 (yesterday\u2019s bun-fight-related ticking off of the day, on the full email edition). It seems bread throwing is not uncommon and Roberto Malotti\u2019s mini-focaccia lob is not really that bizarre. Indeed you referenced the Battle of the Buffet, while this which, although its title is rudely deceptive, also relates to bread hurling. Perhaps a fill-in bread-throwing sport can be undertaken while we all studiously ignore the upcoming sourdough-funded tournament\u201d \u2013 Rod de Lisle.\n\u201cThe long nights are drawing in, our Fisher-Price VAR system is now in place, and both Big Cup representatives have been suitably humbled by our gifted friends on the continent. Can The Fiver please reassure us Scots that there\u2019ll be regionalised content to get us through the winter? Perhaps you could get Pat Nevin in to talk about LPs, or review old Scotch &amp; Wry episodes\u201d \u2013 Johnny Connelly.\nSend your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport.

                    "body": "Gareth Bale needed a new home. This has been true for a while, even when he was still under contract at Real Madrid, where the Welshman became something of an unwanted figure towards the end of a nine-year spell in Spain. Los Angeles should be a more welcoming environment for Bale, not least because California boasts some of the best golf courses in the United States. The jokes write themselves about a player who once famously waved a flag that read \u2018Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order\u2019, but there are solid reasons for Bale to be in LA. The 32-year-old is counting on Los Angeles FC to help him prepare for the 2022 World Cup, a potentially career-defining tournament for a player who has already won five Champions League titles, three La Liga titles and scored more than 100 goals for Real Madrid. Wales need Bale to be fit and firing by November (when they open their World Cup campaign against, appropriately enough, the US). There\u2019s history to be made.  It\u2019s also easy to make assumptions about a club, and a league, that has attracted an ageing European star whose professional commitment has been recently questioned. MLS has been stung in the past by players that see the league as one final pay check before calling it a day. News of LAFC\u2019s latest signing generated fresh \u2018retirement league\u2019 jibes.  But Bale isn\u2019t a typical \u2018retirement league\u2019 signing. LAFC haven\u2019t acquired him to be the beating heart of their team. Their fortunes aren\u2019t tied to the success or failure of the transfer. In fact, Steve Cherundolo\u2019s team are currently the best in MLS, sitting top of the Western Conference. They don\u2019t necessarily need Bale.  Bale isn\u2019t even a Designated Player, joining LAFC on a Targeted Allocation Money (TAM) deal instead. The front office mechanics of this have yet to be truly revealed, with former Juventus defender Giorgio Chiellini also joining the club on a similar deal this summer, but it\u2019s clear LAFC have found a way to fit Bale into their existing strategy without any drastic alterations. This is in stark contrast to Toronto FC\u2019s capture of Lorenzo Insigne, for instance. The Italy international agreed to join the club on a four-year deal worth a mammoth $60m earlier this year, but only arrived in Toronto last week. He isn\u2019t expected to play a match for his new team until 9 July. Meanwhile, TFC have just 18 points from 16 games this season. They are waiting for Insigne to turn things around almost single-handedly. Their place in the playoffs depends on it. Memories of players like Steven Gerrard, who never fully committed to MLS and added to the \u2018retirement league\u2019 image, linger. But David Beckham, Robbie Keane, Wayne Rooney, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, David Villa and many others prove there can still be a place for veteran figures. In the right team and in the right circumstances, they can offer plenty. This is the bet LAFC have placed on Bale. Depending on how much freedom Bale has to regulate his own game time, it\u2019s possible he could be a peripheral figure for LAFC in the build-up to the 2022 World Cup. Not only will he have to acclimatise to a new team, league and country, he will be cautious about picking up any injuries that could impact him in Qatar. It would be unsurprising if Bale opted to skip road games on artificial turf. His knees could do without that sort of strain. Cherundolo\u2019s 4-3-3 formation will give Bale the option of playing on the left or right. It\u2019s even possible he could operate through the middle to give LAFC a different dimension. Between Bale and Carlos Vela, Cherundolo will have one of the most fluid attacks in the league. This is daunting enough without even mentioning Cristian Arango and Brian Rodriguez. Off the ball, though, there are questions over how Bale will fare. LAFC are an aggressive defensive side and Bale isn\u2019t exactly known for his tracking back. Only three of Real Madrid\u2019s 26-man squad registered fewer tackles and interceptions per 90 minutes than Bale last season. His new LAFC teammates may have to compensate for this inability, or unwillingness, to press. In many ways, Bale needs MLS more than it needs him, which says something about the development of the league over the last 15 years or so. The Welshman requires first-team football at a high enough level to will keep him sharp, but not break him, before the World Cup this winter. Bale needs to get his club career back on track. The stakes aren\u2019t so high for MLS.  It may not be until 2023 that LAFC see the best of Bale, and even then he could struggle to build consistency with the season starting in February and the Welshman\u2019s initial 12-month contract, which is believed to have an option for an extension, up in July. But even if Bale only offers a glimpse of his brilliance during a short stint in MLS, LAFC will benefit. If that happens, and Bale arrives in Qatar in peak physical condition, both parties will have got what they wanted. "

                    "body": "Heating has been fully restored to Kyiv, the city\u2019s mayor has said, after one of the most intense Russian bombardments of the capital last week robbed it of key civilian energy supplies and forced the national government to implement rolling blackouts. Vitali Klitschko said on Sunday morning the capital was successfully \u201crestoring all services after the latest shelling\u201d and that \u201cin particular, the capital\u2019s heating supply system is fully restored. All sources of heat supply work normally.\u201d Temperatures in Kyiv and across the country were below freezing on Sunday and forecast to fall to -6C (21.2F) by evening. Up to a third of the capital\u2019s population of 3 million had still been without electricity overnight in what officials called a \u201cdifficult and critical\u201d situation. A wave of Russian drone and missile attacks since October has caused severe damage to Ukraine\u2019s civilian energy and electricity infrastructure as it enters the cold winter months. Russia fired more than 70 missiles targeting Ukraine\u2019s water and energy infrastructure on Friday in one of its heaviest barrages since the beginning of its invasion on 24 February, causing power blackouts and removing access to heat and water.  Four people in the southern Russian border region of Belgorod were meanwhile wounded by shelling on Sunday, the governor said, and witnesses reported loud blasts in the regional capital. In Ukraine, shelling was also reported in the centre of Kherson, the major city from which Russian soldiers retreated last month in one of Moscow\u2019s biggest battlefield setbacks since its invasion. Britain\u2019s defence ministry said in its intelligence assessment on Sunday that low morale continued to be a \u201csignificant vulnerability\u201d for Russia\u2019s forces, highlighting Moscow\u2019s plans for a creative brigade in a bid to use \u201cmilitary music and organised entertainment\u201d to boost morale. The ministry in London said it doubted the new brigade would compensate for \u201cvery high casualty rates, poor leadership, pay problems, lack of equipment and ammunition, and lack of clarity about the war\u2019s objectives\u201d. Moscow said the Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, visited troops involved in what it calls its special military operation in Ukraine after the defence ministry this week announced the formation of a \u201cfrontline creative brigade\u201d, including vocalists and musicians, to raise morale. RBC news in Russia cited officials as saying the brigade would feature conscripted and volunteer professional artists tasked with maintaining \u201ca high moral, political and psychological state [among] the participants of the special military operation\u201d. The ministry said Shoigu \u201cflew around the areas of troop deployment and checked the advanced positions of Russian units in the zone of the special military operation\u201d, adding that he spoke with frontline troops. It is not clear where.  Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Sunday proposed holding a global peace summit this winter, in a video message Kyiv had hoped would be broadcast ahead of the World Cup final in Qatar. In an interview published on Sunday, the veteran US diplomat Henry Kissinger said the time was approaching for a negotiated peace to reduce the risk of a devastating world war, but warned that dreams of breaking up Russia could unleash nuclear chaos. Kissinger, 99, was secretary of state under the Republican presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford and an architect of the cold war policy of detente towards the former Soviet Union. He has met the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, on several occasions. \u201cThe time is approaching to build on the strategic changes which have already been accomplished and to integrate them into a new structure towards achieving peace through negotiation,\u201d Kissinger wrote in an article for the Spectator magazine. \u201cA peace process should link Ukraine to Nato, however expressed. The alternative of neutrality is no longer meaningful,\u201d he wrote, adding that desires to render Russia \u201cimpotent\u201d, or even seek its dissolution \u2013 which neither the west nor Ukraine has advocated \u2013 could unleash mayhem. William Burns, the director of the CIA, said in an interview published on Saturday that while most conflicts ended in negotiation, the agency\u2019s assessment was that Russia was not serious yet about a real negotiation to end the war. The archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said on Sunday that Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine had \u201copened the gates of hell\u201d, unleashing \u201cevery evil\u201d force worldwide from murder and rape in occupied territory to famine and debt in Africa and Europe. He said after a visit to Ukraine last month he had been struck by the \u201csize of the mass graves in Bucha, the photos of what had been done to the people there, the rape, the massacres, the torture by the occupying Russian forces\u201d."

                    "body": "Mikel Arteta has backed Ben White to step in for England if Kyle Walker is ruled out of the World Cup through injury and believes he could slot comfortably into Gareth Southgate\u2019s back three. Walker\u2019s groin injury leaves him with an uphill battle to be fit for Qatar 2022, where England begin against Iran on 21 November, and White would hold genuine hope of a recall if the Manchester City player does not make it.  White shone in the middle for Arsenal last season but has been a revelation at right-back in their strong start this time around. He has proved highly adaptable and Arteta believes he can excel in the right-sided centre-back role Walker has occupied. Asked whether White could push for inclusion and if that position would suit him, he said: \u201cBoth. Ben would be very comfortable playing on the right side of a back three as well as in the middle, or as a full-back. If you ask me if he is ready to make that step then the answer is yes, because he is a very confident boy. He gives you absolutely everything, he is always available and he has the courage to play under real pressure.\u201d White won the most recent of his four caps in March, starting at right-back when England beat Ivory Coast 3-0 with a largely experimental side. He has fallen behind Fikayo Tomori and Marc Gu\u00e9hi in the pecking order at centre-back since then and, where Walker\u2019s spot in particular is concerned, would be deemed unlikely to start ahead of John Stones this winter even if called up. But Arteta believes his form as an attacking full-back speaks of an invaluable versatility. \u201cWe all believed he had the qualities to do that and the most important step, probably, was for him to believe he could do it and to feel comfortable in that position \u2013 and that the position could maximise his potential and give him another dimension as a player,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that now he can play in various positions will make him a more complete player and I think he\u2019s very happy with that.\u201d White is expected to start for Arsenal against Liverpool. His repurposing to the flank has partly been brought about by the exceptional form in central defence of Gabriel Magalh\u00e3es and William Saliba. The latter, in particular, has been compared in favourable terms to the visitors\u2019 Virgil van Dijk but Arteta rejected any resemblances to the Dutchman or his potential partner Jo\u00ebl Matip. \u201cThe moment they win everything the other two have is the right moment [to compare],\u201d he said."

The vote of confidence comes despite a woeful recent run of results that has put his team\u2019s chances of reaching the tournament in Qatar in the balance. FA on Thursday confirmed Arnold will remain in his position for the upcoming Asian confederation play-off against UAE on 7 June, and the potential intercontinental play-off with Peru that would follow the week after.  FA said it would continue to work closely with Arnold ahead of the crucial game in Doha, where the Socceroos will attempt to arrest a run of two defeats and a draw, and a total of just six points claimed from their last seven qualifying matches. \u201cThe board of Football Australia believed it was important that we provided a stable environment and to get on with planning for the play-off phase given the very short turn-around,\u201d said FA chair Chris Nikou. \u201cBy confirming that Graham will remain head coach of the Socceroos until the completion of our Fifa World Cup Qatar 2022 campaign, it enables Graham, his support staff and the playing group to move forward with certainty, and without delay, to ensure the best possible preparation for the next phase of qualification.\u201d Australia\u2019s hopes of automatically qualifying for the 2022 World Cup were ended with a 2-0 home defeat to Japan last week, rendering their final Group B match against Saudi Arabia on Wednesday a dead rubber. An experimental side fell 1-0 in Jeddah, leaving the Socceroos with a record of four wins, three draws and three losses from the third stage of Asian qualifying, and prompting speculation about Arnold\u2019s future. The Saudis and Japan claimed the two direct qualification spots available. FA chief executive James Johnson said Arnold had the governing body\u2019s full support and that the coach still has the opportunity to \u201cfinish the job he was appointed to in 2018 and see through his commitment to the national team\u201d. \u201cAs we have done throughout the campaign, we will work closely with Graham to ensure the team has the necessary resources, support and the approach required to achieve the best possible outcome and ultimately qualification to our fifth consecutive Fifth World Cup.\u201d"

                    "body": "Harry Kane put it as the pros tend to put it: heavy on understatement, a disappointing lack of drama. \u201cThere were a few words said by a few people,\u201d the Tottenham striker said as he reflected on what went on during half-time as his team trailed 1-0 at Marseille, their Champions League hopes in the balance. As ever, it was easy to read between the lines, to feel the emotion of the moment, the frustration, possibly even the anger. Because yet again, for the sixth game in a row, Spurs had not turned up in the first half.  Kane said the gist of the messaging on Tuesday night was that greater aggression and intensity was needed. With Antonio Conte stuck in the stands serving a ban for his red card against Sporting last week \u2013 the manager went through all manner of internal agonies \u2013 it was left to his assistants, Cristian Stellini and Ryan Mason, to provide the direction. The captain, Hugo Lloris, too. Over a season there are always turning points, or at least the desire to locate them, and this certainly felt like one. Spurs brought the aggression after the restart, pushing higher, making runs ahead of the ball, taking responsibility and playing as if they meant it. The game swung when Cl\u00e9ment Lenglet glanced in Ivan Perisic\u2019s 54th-minute free-kick, and despite a couple of late scares Spurs were value for their win and progress as group leaders, which was secured by Pierre-Emile H\u00f8jbjerg\u2019s last-gasp breakaway goal. Had they lost they would have been pressed into the Europa League.  Radical turnarounds after focused half-time chats have become the new normal at Spurs. They beat Everton in the middle of last month after going in at 0-0 and after blowing out entirely at Manchester United they almost got something against Newcastle after trailing 2-0 at the interval. They came back to draw against Sporting, having been 1-0 down at half-time, and were unlucky not to win before they stormed back to beat Bournemouth on Saturday, having trailed 1-0 at the break and then 2-0. The problem has been an inability to balance caution with risk and Spurs found it particularly difficult on a wild night in Marseille when they knew that a draw would have been enough to qualify, most likely as runners-up. It is often said that the end of the first half is the worst time to concede but Chancel Mbemba\u2019s 45th-minute header might weirdly have been a good thing for Spurs. \u201cIt\u2019s always hard to come away from home in a tough atmosphere, knowing that a draw gets you through,\u201d Kane said. \u201cIt\u2019s never easy to come out and go full throttle because you could end up being 2-0 down in 10 minutes and then you\u2019re in a hole.  \u201cWe\u2019ve got to find a balance between dropping and pressing. At the moment, we\u2019re just dropping and sitting too deep. In the second half, we went man-for-man and took a bit more risk. We need to just find a little more patience when we are dropping and then being able to get out of that deep block and press. It is what we try to do but we\u2019re just not quite executing it well enough.\u201d Kane talked about how there was no panic at half-time, partly because the team had been there before and more frequently than they would like. He stressed it was vital not to go 2-0 down as they had against Newcastle \u2013 lessons were learned from that, he said \u2013 and there was a point about Spurs\u2019 excellent stamina, a legacy of the late, much-loved fitness coach Gian Piero Ventrone. \u201cWe\u2019re a team that always feels like we\u2019re going to get chances, especially in the second half of games when teams get tired,\u201d Kane said. \u201cFitness-wise we\u2019re a really strong team so we feel like we can always come strong in the second-half.\u201d It sounded a little reductive on one level and it even evoked memories of Muhammad Ali\u2019s rope-a-dope strategy. Are Spurs lulling opponents into a false sense of security, luring them in to punch themselves out? It is game management but not as we know it. The main thing was that it worked against Marseille and Kane can feel a spring in his step before the World Cup in Qatar, which kicks off on 20 November. He will carry England\u2019s hopes as captain and talisman. Kane was brilliant in the second half against Marseille, even though he knew he should have put away one of his chances. You could feel that from his rueful smiles. But he was a strong outlet, getting his team up the pitch, linking the play with lovely passes and driving into the box.  \u201cIt was really important [to reach the last 16] just before the World Cup,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we\u2019d have gone out, it would have been a real sting because you know you\u2019re coming back from the World Cup and playing Europa League and it\u2019s just not the same feeling.\u201d Kane returned to the night before the Marseille tie when local ultras set off fireworks over the Spurs hotel, trying to disrupt them. They exploded at 1.30am and 4.30am. \u201cWe expected it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were told the fireworks might happen. I woke up on the first lot but the second lot \u2013 I was fast asleep thankfully.\u201d Rivals have been warned. If they are going to take shots at Kane, they had better make them count. Because he will be back. Spurs will be back."

                    "body": "The road to Qatar will end in Qatar for either Australia or the United Arab Emirates this week. One team will return home and start preparations for the 2023 Asian Cup; the other will stay in Doha to take on Peru in an intercontinental play-off six days later, with the winner of that game returning in November for games against France, Denmark and Tunisia. Roel Coumans will be watching Tuesday\u2019s game (early Wednesday AEST) with more interest than most neutrals and has had a foot in both camps. The Dutchman joined the Socceroos set-up in January 2018 as Bert van Marwijk\u2019s No 2 and the pair left the UAE national team in February this year following disappointing results in World Cup qualification.  The Socceroos have been here before \u2013 they secured a 2018 berth with play-off victories over Syria and then Honduras \u2013 but Coumans believes things are different this time. \u201cCompared to the past, Australia just don\u2019t have any players at the top level of Europe,\u201d he says. \u201cLook at Mat Ryan. He was at Brighton, went to Arsenal, then Spain where he does not play many matches at the top level any more. Four years ago, when we were preparing for the World Cup, we didn\u2019t have that many at a high level. Now there are even fewer and that is a bit worrying.\u201d The UAE, 180 minutes away from a first World Cup appearance since their 1990 debut, have an entirely domestic-based squad and while this causes concerns at home, there are benefits. \u201cAt least in the UAE, the players play all through the season and the biggest advantage is that they can pause the league to create extra training time with the team,\u201d Coumans says. By kick-off, the Whites will have been together, first in Dubai and then in Doha, for two weeks. Another major difference between this playoff and previous ones is the format. The game is still between the third-placed teams from Asia\u2019s Group A and B but rather than the home and away epics of the past, it is a one-off. There is good news for Socceroos coach Graham Arnold as Coumans does not see the June heat as a major factor at the Ahmad bin Ali Stadium. \u201cWhile it is hot everywhere, they will play in an air-conditioned stadium. I was there not long ago. On the pitch, it will be 17-18C and very comfortable. The disadvantage for Australia is they would have had their fans at home cheering them on.\u201d There are expected to be more than 5,000 UAE supporters though Coumans does not think they will be treated to a feast of attacking football. Rodolfo Arruabarrena, Arnold\u2019s opposite number and Van Marwijk\u2019s successor, has had little time in charge but in the unlikely home win in March over South Korea that clinched third place, the team completely surrendered possession, having around a fifth of the ball. Somehow they kept a clean sheet and managed a breakaway goal. \u201cWhen I look at the style of the coaches, they will not take risks but Australia should play with the Australian spirit, be aggressive and try to get into one-v-one situations.\u201d UAE need a different approach, says Coumans. \u201cThey should play football, try to control the midfield and avoid physical battles.\u201d The return of Omar Abdulrahman, 2016 Asian Player of the Year, from injury is potentially significant. \u201cHe can make a difference but hasn\u2019t played many games. He still has the touch, his left foot is extremely good.\u201d If the one-time Manchester City target can re-establish his partnership with striker Ali Mabkhout, who tops the scoring charts for this qualifying tournament with 14 goals and is looking to add to his international tally of 80, then the Socceroos are going to have problems. \u201cMabkhout is phenomenal, a killer in and outside the box and his stats are at a very high level,\u2019 Coumans says. \u201cHe has suffered a little bit with his form last year but he is getting back on track at the right time.\u201d Yet even if the UAE stars shine, Coumans knows that Australia cannot be counted out, even after winning just two of their last eight games, which included a 2-1 warm-up victory against Jordan on Wednesday. \u201cTheir spirit can make a huge difference. That is something about Aussie players, they can create this extra mentality to win the match as a team and this game is about being the best team, not having the best players.\u201d Despite, or because of, his extensive experience with both teams, Coumans finds it hard to call the result. \u201cIn this one match everything is possible. It will be a close call, history shows that. I think they are equal. The question is now, do you just want to go to the World Cup or do you really really want to go? The team that really wants to suffer, sacrifice and play as a team will win.\u201d"

                    "body": "At the final whistle Leon Bailey lay face down, his head buried in the turf, doubtless replaying his stoppage-time miss over in his mind. Danny Ings rushed over to drag his distraught Aston Villa teammate to his feet but Bailey pulled his shirt over his eyes and headed down the tunnel in tears. With 15 minutes to play Ings, thrown on as part of a triple substitution, cancelled out Daniel Podence\u2019s classy opener and in the third of four added second-half minutes Bailey rounded the Wolves goalkeeper, Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1, but somehow failed to apply the most simple of finishes. Bailey will not need reminding about the opportunity and Unai Emery was never going to castigate his player. \u201cHe was crying but it\u2019s good because he was feeling,\u201d Emery said. \u201cHe was taking responsibility to score and he didn\u2019t do it. I\u2019m very happy with his commitment and performances. It was good to learn more with him.\u201d Bailey said on Instagram: \u201cI feel at blame for not coming away with all 3 points tonight. It\u2019s really hard to take and I\u2019m very disappointed in myself. Surely will be very difficult to sleep tonight but I\u2019ll try to keep my head up.\u201d  When Emery and Julen Lopetegui last duelled on the touchline, in La Liga in September, their respective Villarreal and Sevilla sides could not be pulled apart and here the managers had to settle for another point. Emery and Lopetegui both hail from the Basque Country and were appointed to rescue missions in cooler climes at these Midlands rivals within 10 days of each other. Both Emery and Lopetegui have given their clubs a lift but they recognise the need for improvements, with both clubs hopeful of being busy in the January transfer window. \u201cWe\u2019re a little bit disappointed but it\u2019s a good thing for us,\u201d Lopetegui said. \u201cWe are believing more in ourselves and ready for a long, hard race.\u201d Five minutes before kick-off Emiliano Mart\u00ednez took to the pitch parading the Golden Glove award last seen covering his crotch on the winners\u2019 podium in Qatar and soaked up the adulation from the Villa support after becoming the club\u2019s first player to lift the World Cup. The Argentina goalkeeper made few friends in the final and his antics, notably throwing the ball away for Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni to fetch before the midfielder missed his penalty in the shootout, prompted the French Football Federation to lodge a formal complaint. Mart\u00ednez is adored in these parts, though.  He returned to Emery\u2019s starting lineup and had only a couple of touches by the time he was fishing the ball out of his net on 12 minutes. Podence and Jo\u00e3o Moutinho exchanged passes down the right flank and the latter released the former into the 18-yard box. Podence powered into the Villa area, sashayed past Douglas Luiz with ease and lashed a left-foot shot into the far corner. Goals have been hard to come by for Wolves this season \u2013 only Gillingham have scored fewer in English football\u2019s top four tiers \u2013 but this was a beauty to cherish. Emery knew he had to change something at half-time and introduced Philippe Coutinho in place of Ashley Young. Lopetegui, too, made a change and Adama Traor\u00e9 entered in place of Podence. Villa kept plugging away but Emery was kicking his heels as his side struggled to test S\u00e1 in the Wolves goal. Traor\u00e9 wasted Wolves\u2019s best chance of the second period; after easily chopping inside the Villa centre-back Tyrone Mings he wellied his shot over the bar.  Lopetegui is animated at the best of times and flew off down touchline after the Villa midfielder Boubacar Kamara was presented with a half-chance from the edge of the box. Lopetegui made plain his unhappiness at Traor\u00e9\u2019s reticence to track back. Perhaps the winger could learn a thing or two from Diego Costa, who raced back to dispossess Coutinho 20 yards from the Wolves goal. At times Costa, who hurtled after Villa defenders all evening, was like a man possessed. Emery made a triple change a minute after Matheus Cunha, the Atl\u00e9tico Madrid loanee, replaced Costa for his Wolves debut, and how it worked. Ludwig Augustinsson, on in place of Lucas Digne, would have volleyed in but for a heroic clearance by Max Kilman and three minutes later Ings struck his leveller. Mings looped a simple ball down the middle of the pitch and Ings feasted on some slack defending to stroke a shot past S\u00e1 and in to earn a point."

                    "body": "In the space of four hours and eight minutes on Tuesday, Manchester United put out two statements that will surely go down in the club\u2019s history. First, the mutual termination of Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s contract was announced at 5.30pm and it was later confirmed the Glazer family were open to selling up. Most United fans welcomed the news. Their ageing prima donna was heading for the exit and there was renewed hope the unpopular American owners might pack up.\nIt had taken fewer than 10 days from Ronaldo\u2019s melodramatic broadside at United, delivered via Piers Morgan\u2019s knockabout questioning, to the No 7 shirt being vacated. Those in the firing line included the owners, coaches past and present and the club\u2019s training facilities. There was no way back for Ronaldo, not that he wanted one. When his contract was ripped up, the club and player got what they desired.\n\nWhereas the writing was on the wall from the moment the first interview snippet was released, the announcement that the Glazers were seeking a buyer for the club came out of the blue. It has taken 17 years for the Glazers \u2013 who bought United in a controversial \u00a3790m leveraged buyout in 2005 \u2013 to accept the turning of the tide at Old Trafford but it will be a little while before they hand over the keys.\nDue to the coincidental timings, fans will hope the sale of the club might follow in the same speedy manner as Ronaldo\u2019s shooing out the door or the collapse of the European Super League. That, however, is unlikely to be the case.\nThe confirmation that the Glazers are willing to depart in exchange for billions was day one of a lengthy process. When it became public knowledge that Fenway Sports Group was, at minimum, seeking outside investment at Liverpool, it was eight months into the process. Raine Group, which brokered the Chelsea sale and has the same role at United, had the mandate for three years before Roman Abramovich was forced to sell up. Takeovers are a complicated business and the sale of Manchester United will be the biggest in football history.\n\nAmericans are showing the most interest in Liverpool and we can expect the same at Old Trafford, although the British billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe is widely reported be keen to acquire the club. Ratcliffe\u2019s Ineos group already owns Nice in France and the Swiss club Lausanne. There is also Saudi Arabia\u2019s sports minister, Abdulaziz bin Turki al-Faisal, saying his country would support any private sector bids.\nWhere the problems lie, unsurprisingly, are the costs involved in buying such an entity. The asking price is around \u00a33.7bn, which rules out most homegrown investors and others will be put off by the poor state of Old Trafford. It could cost up to \u00a31bn to renovate the stadium and that is a hefty add-on.\nFollowing an unsuccessful bid to buy Chelsea Ratcliffe has said he had a meeting with the Glazers in the summer and they told him the club was not for sale, but months later it is on the market. It is not an overnight decision to sell a business of this size. Did Ratcliffe\u2019s interest make the Glazers contemplate the sale or were their minds already made up and they prefer to not sell to the Ineos founder?\n\nThere will need to be in-depth due diligence and that will just be working through the list of Ronaldo\u2019s gripes. There is plenty to be done at United to modernise a club built on Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s foundations. From business to football, if they want to continue as the behemoth created alongside the Premier League, changes will have to be made on many levels. A new training ground would be one necessity and an overhaul of the commercial operations another.\nAn optimistic scenario would see a takeover completed next summer in time for the opening of the transfer window. Any incoming owners would want to spend on new players for an early popularity boost, although purely by not being the Glazers they would be one step ahead.\n\nMeanwhile, Ronaldo\u2019s departure will have both a short- and long-term impact. His absence at Fulham allowed Alejandro Garnacho more minutes, before he scored the late winner. If United decide against signing a replacement in January, it would be a boost for youngsters such as the Argentinian.\nWhile most of the first team squad are away at the World Cup in Qatar, the remaining players are training with the under-21s, allowing Erik ten Hag the chance to evaluate his young charges and see who could be worthy of a chance when the Premier League season restarts. The head coach now has the opportunity to look forward, no longer forced to deal with Ronaldo\u2019s disruptive presence.\nThanks to the World Cup, there will be time for the dust to settle at Old Trafford. Fans will not attend a home match until late December, allowing them to absorb the shifting of the sands at United.\nThere is reason for optimism at United after frustration with owners and a club legend but it will take time for the impact of the past seven days to fully take hold. Good things, hopefully, come to those who wait."

                    "body": "Australia have put their Women\u2019s Rugby World Cup hopes back on track with an Ashley Marsters try in the 73rd minute, securing a thrilling comeback win in their second match of the campaign against Scotland in Whangarei, New Zealand. After their heartbreaking implosion against New Zealand\u2019s Black Ferns in the opening round, the Wallaroos trailed all game against Scotland only to cross twice in the final 20 minutes of game time to post a crucial first victory of the campaign. Australia\u2019s Eva Karpani, Grace Hamilton and Sharni Williams were standouts in the triumph. Wallaroos skipper Shannon Parry said it \u201cwasn\u2019t pretty\u201d but lauded her players for the way they stayed in the fight. \u201cIt was nerve-wracking. It was a real tough battle against Scotland, they really showed us how to play some footy there today,\u201d Parry told Stan Sport. \u201cI\u2019m immensely proud. We gutted it out all the way to the end \u2013 an 80-minute performance \u2013 and to come away with that victory, it\u2019s a really good reward.  \u201cWe didn\u2019t play as good, as clinical as we wanted to but we\u2019ll take the points. We\u2019re still alive in this tournament, and that\u2019s what matters.\u201d The Wallaroos\u2019 win consigned the Scots to consecutive last-gasp defeats. Taking part in their first Rugby World Cup in 12 years, Scotland last week lost a heartbreaker in the opening round against Wales, kicked from what might have been a famous comeback victory into a narrow 85th-minute 18-15 defeat by a Keira Bevan\u2019s post-siren penalty. Scotland showed they were chasing revenge when they started with gusto, rocking the Wallaroos by jumping to an early lead when veteran front-rower Lana Skeldon charged over in the ninth minute from the maul for the opening five-pointer, 11 years after making her Test debut for Scotland against the Netherlands. In the 18th minute, dominant Scottish flier Rhona Lloyd scooted away for what seemed a certain try. Somehow recovering from the bone-rattling tackle of Iliseva Batibasaga to retrieve the lost ball behind her, Lloyd then ducked under a pack of gold defenders into yawning space, then flew into a yawning gap with the line wide open. But, in desperate scenes, Wallaroos winger Maya Stewart then fullback Lori Cramer swooped from left and right to hit Lloyd from either side and spilled the ball free just before she crossed. It was a massive save and proved crucial to the final result. Especially when the Scots extended their lead in the 27th minute with a penalty try, after a forward drive to the line was collapsed by Adiana Talakai who compounded the seven-point gift by being sent to the bin with a yellow card. It took Scotland\u2019s lead to 12-0 at half time and left Australia\u2019s World Cup hanging by a thread. In their first pool match at Eden Park, the Wallaroos had defended stoutly and taken their chances in attack and counterattack, to seize on New Zealand mistakes and go 17-0 at half time. But before over 40,000 Kiwi fans, the Wallaroos had let that lead slip, conceding 41 unanswered points to the Black Ferns in the second stanza. Against Scotland at half time, they found themselves similarly flummoxed but for very different reasons. Australia had made 239-metres to Scotland\u2019s 142 with 110 passes to Scotland\u2019s 32, as 19-year-old Bienne Terita, in just her third Test, caused havoc and veteran Sharni Williams tore up the midfield in her fourth World Cup.  Despite 63% possession in the first half the Wallaroos had given up 65% of territory to the Scots in the opening 4o minutes. The other remarkable stat was the Australians had made just 22 of 28 tackles whereas their rivals had executed a massive 81 of 97 tackles. Despite making all the running, the Wallaroos were still trailing. Twenty minutes into the second stanza, Australia still hadn\u2019t bothered the scorers. But with the strong Whangarei wind at their back they were finishing fast. Arabella McKenzie was stopped just short of the stripe, then Eva Karpani was held up as Australia hammered beyond 10-phases under a penalty advantage. Finally, the blue wall cracked as Scotland ran out of numbers and a cutout ball from McKenzie found Terita for a simple finish to make it 12-7 with the conversion. In the 71st minute Australia knocked Scotland off the ball to win a new penalty and spurned three points for an attacking scrum 30-metres out. A fantastic carry off the scrum win from Terita took it the 22 before Scotland infringed in front of the posts. Australia opted for another scrum and went left, eventually finding Marsters charging in on an angled run at first receiver to split the line and crash over. Cramer added the extras to put Australia 14-12 in front with eight minutes to play. But when Marsters was red-carded for head-on-head contact with Sarah Law in the 76th minutes, the game took another twist as Australia were asked to hang on with 14 players. There was another red card in the closing stages as Talakai\u2019s tackle took her yellow into the red zone and saw Australia down to 13. Although the Scots launched fresh waves of attack, the gold line held firm to the end to secure a brave Wallaroos victory. Although those late red cards to both hookers leave Australia vulnerable going forward, they now prepare to face Wales at Northland Events Centre in Whangarei next Saturday knowing that a win should ensure progression to the quarter-finals. Scotland\u2019s task just gets harder, as they face New Zealand in their final pool game."

                    "body": "Gareth Southgate has warned his missing Manchester United contingent that they face a battle to regain their places for the World Cup as he looked ahead to the challenges of an unprecedented mid-season tournament, which begins on 21 November. The England manager is preparing for the fourth and last game of the end-of-season Nations League programme against Hungary at Molineux on Tuesday night. But his thoughts are increasingly focused on fine-tuning his squad for Qatar \u2013 expected to number 26 players rather than the usual 23 \u2013 and how he will manage what he called the \u201cstrange lead-in\u201d to the finals. During a look through the potential marginal gains, Southgate was asked whether United\u2019s lack of Champions League football next season might leave their England players a little bit fresher. \u201cWe\u2019ve only got one with us,\u201d Southgate shot back, with a nod towards Harry Maguire. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a lot to do to get back in the squad.\u201d Southgate was referring to Luke Shaw, Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho \u2013 the former out of the picture because of injury, the latter pair omitted because of poor form. Shaw, too, has had a disappointing season, although with Southgate without a recognised left-back \u2013 Chelsea\u2019s Ben Chilwell only returned on the final day of the season for his club after a six-month cruciate knee ligament injury \u2013 Shaw would appear to have a clearer route back.  Southgate was surprisingly unsympathetic towards Rashford when he dropped him for the March get-together, noting pointedly that the forward had withdrawn from six of the previous eight squads. He called the decision to exclude him and continue to overlook Sancho as \u201cfairly straightforward.\u201d It is not a phrase that Southgate would use in relation to the World Cup countdown. After the Hungary game, his players will mostly have only three weeks off before reporting to their clubs for pre-season and the matches will come thick and fast once the new campaign starts. The Champions League group phase, for example, will be squeezed in from 6 September to 2 November. Southgate said there would be \u201cmidweek fixtures every week, whether that\u2019s a couple of League Cup weeks, definitely six European weeks and midweeks with Premier League games.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s manageable but the demands on the players are huge and we are all conscious that we can\u2019t keep adding to the calendar. \u201cWe are still paying the price of Covid, really \u2026 having three games in international windows, four games now [in the Nations League], partly due to the timing of the World Cup because we lose the October camp so everything\u2019s condensed. I am sure players are gaining more of a voice in this and understandably so.\u201d  England have only one more camp before they depart for Qatar on 15 November \u2013 they play Italy (away) and Germany (home) in the Nations League on 23 and 26 September. The Premier League will pause after the fixtures on the weekend of 12-13 November. Southgate brought up a potential issue before the World Cup when he wondered what would happen if a club had an England player with an injury. Would they want to keep the information in-house, rather than tell the Football Association, for fear of it leaking to their upcoming opponents? Southgate will submit a long list of players to Fifa on 21 October, although it does not need to be made public. He is expected to announce his final squad on 9 or 10 November. The Fifa deadline is Monday 14 November, when England are scheduled to meet up. Southgate admitted he would have no control over the players in the weeks leading up to the Premier League pause. \u201cInformation sharing is pretty good medically and we get the performance data from the Premier League so you\u2019ve got some markers,\u201d he said. \u201cBut equally there\u2019s always an understanding that clubs that have big games might not want to share certain things too early if they\u2019ve got players that might miss games. In general we have decent relationships with the clubs on that stuff but there\u2019s always going to be a bit of an element of the unknown in that period.\u201d  The Premier League fixtures for next season are to be released on Thursday \u2013 the first game will be on Friday, 5 August \u2013 and Southgate hopes that there will be no massive games on the weekend of 12-13 November. Indeed, the FA have made that specific request. \u201cWe have asked the Premier League to have a think about things but we also understand that the fixture programme is very complicated,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cWe\u2019d have a preference for none of those big games [on 12-13 November] but to be honest the difference it\u2019s going to make is fairly marginal. \u201cIt could help us, perhaps, with a medical report. If a team played Saturday, it would give us an extra day to assess. Because we\u2019re going to have to meet on the Monday and fly on the Tuesday. We\u2019re going to have to make really quick decisions on medical situations, in particular. So that\u2019s the only thing that we\u2019re looking at that might help us. We understand the landscape but we\u2019d be stupid not to ask the question if it could make a difference.\u201d"

                    "body": "J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann has pledged to call Carlos Queiroz in an effort to smooth things over after his contentious comments on the Iran coach and his team.\nAfter Friday\u2019s 2-0 win over Wales, the BBC presenter Gabby Logan talked about Iran\u2019s \u201cgamesmanship\u201d and said they just stayed on the right side of the law before handing over to Klinsmann. \u201cYes, that\u2019s their culture,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir way of doing it, and that is why Carlos Queiroz fits really well [with] the Iranian national team.\u201d\n\nThe former Germany international added: \u201c[Queiroz] struggled in South America, he failed to qualify with Colombia and then he failed with Egypt to qualify and then he went back and guided Iran, who he worked already with for a long, long time. So this is not by coincidence, this is done on purpose.\n\n\u201cThis is just part of their culture and how they play, then they work the referee, you saw the bench always jumping up, working the fourth official and the linesman, constantly in their ears, constantly in your face. Kieffer Moore will probably tell you more after the game about little incidents that we didn\u2019t see.\u201d Queiroz demanded Klinsmann resign from his role on Fifa\u2019s technical study group after calling his comments \u201ca disgrace to football\u201d.\n\u201cThere was stuff really taken out of context,\u201d Klinsmann said in an interview with BBC Breakfast on Sunday. \u201cI will try to give him a call and calm things down.\n\u201cI have never criticised Carlos or the Iranian bench. Some even thought I was criticising the referee because he didn\u2019t do anything about the way they were behaving on the bench. All I described was their emotional way of doing things, which is actually admirable in a certain way.\n\u201cThe whole bench lives the game. They\u2019re jumping up and down and Carlos is a very emotional coach, he\u2019s constantly on the sidelines trying to give his players all his energy and direction.\u201d\nQueiroz was moved to respond to Klinsmann\u2019s initial comments in a series of tweets on Saturday evening in which it was clear the Iran manager was furious. \u201cNo matter how much I can respect what you did inside the pitch, those remarks about Iran Culture, Iran National Team and my Players are a disgrace to football,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNobody can hurt our integrity if it is not at our level, of course. Even saying so, we would like to invite you as our guest, to come to our national team camp, socialise with Iran players and learn from them about the country, the people of Iran, the poets and art, the algebra, all the millennial Persian culture. And also listen from our players how much they love and respect football.\n\n\u201cAs [an] American/German, we understand you\u2019re no supporter. No problem. And despite your outrageous remarks on BBC trying to undermine our efforts, sacrifices and skills, we promise you that we will not produce any judgments regarding your culture, roots and background and that you will always be welcome to our family.\u201d\nQueiroz then called into question Klinsmann\u2019s official role with Fifa. \u201cAt the same time, we just want to follow with full attention what will be the decision of Fifa regarding your position as a member of Qatar 2022 Technical Study Group. Because, obviously, we expect you to resign before you visit our camp.\u201d\nIran\u2019s players have faced huge pressure because of political unrest at home and face the USA in their final group game on Tuesday knowing a win will ensure qualification to the World Cup knockout stage for the first time in their history."

                    "body": "Keira Walsh sidestepped questions about her club future as she prepares to win a 50th senior England cap against Luxembourg in front of a sell-out crowd at Stoke on Tuesday night. The Manchester City midfielder has been the subject of an intense pursuit by Barcelona this summer and, addressing the media at St George\u2019s Park, did little to quash suggestions that she could spend the coming season in Spain.  \u201cMy focus is on England right now,\u201d was all Walsh would say on the matter as she looked forward to the Lionesses\u2019 first match on home soil since winning Euro 2022 at Wembley in July. With Sarina Wiegman\u2019s side having already qualified for next summer\u2019s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand thanks to Saturday\u2019s 2-0 win in Austria, the result of Tuesday\u2019s concluding qualifier is academic but it would be a major shock if the Lionesses were to lose for the first time on Wiegman\u2019s watch. The ruthless efficiency which has seen England win all of their nine World Cup qualifying Group D games to date, scoring 70 goals and conceding none, has been mirrored by Walsh\u2019s own personal performances and she believes Wiegman should take the credit. \u201cI\u2019ve found a bit of consistency under Sarina,\u201d said the 25-year-old. \u201cI probably struggled with that a little bit before she came in. \u201cShe\u2019s given me the confidence to go and play my game. I think it\u2019s just about carrying on this consistency and the form I found at the Euros now.\u201d  Wiegman resisted rotating her first XI during Euro 2022 but, well aware of the perils of potential burnout, is likely to make some alterations against a Luxembourg side ranked 117th in the world and beaten 10-0 by England last September. \u201cYou might expect some changes,\u201d said England\u2019s manager. \u201cBut 30,000 people are coming to watch us so we really want to show again our [best] game and make a little celebration. \u201cI expect again a very energetic team that really wants to score lots of goals and \u2013 of course \u2013 concede none. We want to be in possession as much as possible because Luxembourg\u2019s level compared to ours, there\u2019s a big difference, so we should show that. We want to get a good win.\u201d England registered their record competitive victory \u2013 20-0 \u2013 against Latvia last November and Wiegman admitted to harbouring slightly mixed feelings about such one-sided outcomes in the currently still imbalanced international women\u2019s football sphere. \u201cI think sometimes a bigger score is OK, but when that\u2019s all the time, you must question yourself: \u2018Is that good for the team that loses that much, and for the team that wins that much?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if it\u2019s not an exception but more a rule then you might want to make some changes [to the format of qualifying competitions] for the benefit of the game in both countries. That discussion\u2019s been going on for a while with Fifa and Uefa, so we\u2019ll see where it brings us.\u201d"

                    "body": "\u201cHere for the weather! We\u2019re only here for the weather!\u201d chanted the band of travelling Wales fans on Thursday night, in wry acknowledgment at the sheer magnitude of the fixture. It wasn\u2019t a classic, but it didn\u2019t need to be. After a 1-0 win over Greece in hot, thundery Volos, Wales need only a point from their game against Slovenia in Cardiff on Tuesday to secure a playoff place for the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. Having lost only to Euros semi-finalists France so far in this campaign, the momentum is with Gemma Grainger\u2019s squad.  Almost three months to the day after the Welsh men qualified for their World Cup in Qatar, the Cardiff City Stadium is set for another emotional occasion. With 10,000 tickets having been sold already, doubling the previous record attendance for a women\u2019s fixture, Tuesday feels like a defining moment for this team. The players will have spent the summer feeling that Welsh\u2011est of emotions, the unique disappointment that comes from watching as spectators a tournament they came agonisingly close to qualifying for. With all the inevitability of an exercise bike purchased in lockdown being used as a clothes horse, Wales missed out on Euro 2022 in the most heart-breaking of circumstances. Finishing third in the group on equal points with Northern Ireland and with a far superior goal difference, they lost out by virtue of having a worse head-to-head record, as the away goals rule favoured Northern Ireland after a 2-2 draw in Newport before a 0-0 stalemate in the return fixture in Belfast.  Having lost narrowly to France in both fixtures in this World Cup campaign, this team know they can compete with some of Europe\u2019s best sides. For a fanbase that is so hungry for success, Welsh supporters could be forgiven for staring at the final table for Women\u2019s Euro 2022 qualifying Group C with disbelief as the eyes of the world focused on England this summer. Failing to qualify by virtue of the away goals rule in a head-to-head. We go again. Much has changed since that disappointment. Grainger was appointed Wales manager in March 2021, having spent 11 years working with the England age group setup. She was part of England\u2019s coaching staff for the Women\u2019s Euros in 2017, where England reached the semi-finals. Grainger can call upon a squad that has a healthy blend of youth and experience, with a talented core of senior players for whom this campaign offers a final chance of World Cup qualification. Carrie Jones \u2013 the scorer of Thursday night\u2019s winner \u2013 is only 19, and her place in the starting lineup might not have come if Jess Fishlock, who has a record 119 caps, had not taken a knock in training.  It was Jones\u2019s first goal for her country and capped a fine display from a very exciting young prospect. But a slice of reality tempered the elation she felt at scoring Thursday\u2019s winner as her heartbroken mother tweeted to say she\u2019d missed seeing it because she had to work a late shift for the NHS. There\u2019s no way the person in charge of that rota doesn\u2019t understand the magnitude of the game against Slovenia. One person who will be there on Tuesday night is Laura McAllister. She is deputy chair of the Uefa women\u2019s football committee, and was one of the three women who in 1993 successfully lobbied the Football Association of Wales to establish the women\u2019s team officially (an unofficial team, entirely organised and funded by the players already existed), before going on to captain the side. As much as McAllister would love to see established stars such as Sophie Ingle, Fishlock and Natasha Harding play at the highest level, McAllister\u2019s experience in sports governance makes her more aware than most of the potential benefits World Cup qualification could provide. \u201cIt\u2019s a total gamechanging moment,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s what we do with the funding and attention to grow the game for all girls. Every single stage needs proper investment, and the only way we\u2019ll do that is if we have the platform of the World Cup, and the funding and attention that comes with it.\u201d  With so many of the Welsh team playing across the border in the Women\u2019s Super League, the English success this summer has given even more impetus to the players. McAllister thinks England\u2019s tournament win will help Wales. The Bristol City and Wales defender Ffion Morgan described the Lionesses\u2019 Euros victory as \u201cbittersweet\u201d \u2013 a sentiment McAllister can appreciate. \u201cI understand Ffion\u2019s comments entirely. Because for me as well, there was disappointment at not seeing Cymru on the European stage. \u201cBut on the other hand, the success of the tournament has reverberations for all of us in the national associations across Europe. But I\u2019d say particularly for those of us like Wales where we already have a very clear strategy for how we develop the game. In a way, this just adds incentive and added pressure, but in a good way,to get there sooner.\u201d But Tuesday comes first. Slovenia are third in the group and two points behind Wales following a 1-1 draw in October. Wales will be roared on by an expectant, record crowd, the demographics of which are changing \u2013 something that interests McAllister. \u201cYes you have the children, we\u2019ve really pushed that, clubs and schools are buying blocks of tickets, but there\u2019s lots of men going to the games now, who are just members of the Red Wall \u2013 for them, it\u2019s just another Cymru game. And I like that normalisation. \u201cI think that\u2019s really important, that the two teams are seen as one in the fans\u2019 eyes. I think it\u2019s a breakthrough moment on Tuesday whatever happens, because the fanbase will be representative of what we\u2019ve wanted it to be for a long time.\u201d"

                    "body": "Jes\u00fas Ferreira tied the United States\u2019 international record with four goals and the Americans beat Grenada 5-0 on Friday night in a World Cup sendoff, a Concacaf Nations League match 164 days before their opener in Qatar. After an array of misfires, Ferreira put the US ahead in the 43rd minute, then added goals in the 54th, 56th and 78th to give him seven in 12 international matches. His four goals matched Landon Donovan (2003), Joe-Max Moore (1993), Buff Donelli (1934) and Archie Stark (1925). Paul Arriola added a goal in the 62nd as the Americans stretched their home unbeaten streak to 26 games since a September 2019 loss to Mexico, matching the team record set from 2013-15. On a 96F evening, stars Christian Pulisic and Tyler Adams didn\u2019t dress for the No 15-ranked US, playing a Spice Boys team ranked just 170th and winless since beating the US Virgin Islands in March 2021. Ferreira got the first goal when Arriola crossed and the ball deflected off Kayden Harrack to the 21-year-old, who cut to the center and beat goalkeeper Jason Belfon inside the far post with a left-foot shot from eight yards. The US entered with just one goal from the run of play by a forward in 13 games. Ferreira doubled the lead with a right-footed shot inside the far post when he sprinted behind the defense as Arriola fed him, then beat Belfon to the far post with a 14-yard right foot shot after Kellyn Acosta played a corner kick on the ground. Second-half sub Brenden Aaronson pulled Belfon off his line for Ferreira\u2019s fourth, leaving him a six-yard tap with his left foot into an open goal. Arriola, Ferreira\u2019s Dallas teammate, scored from inside the six-yard box from Luca de la Torre\u2019s pass, his 10th international goal. Cameron Carter-Vickers started in his international competitive debut and joined Aaron Long to become the 20th center back pairing in 53 games since coach Gregg Berhalter was hired in December 2018. The US made eight changes from Sunday\u2019s 0-0 exhibition draw against Uruguay, Malik Tillman, a 20-year old who switched to the Americans from Germany last month, made his competitive debut at the start of the second half when he replaced Weston McKennie. The unusual prep schedule was caused by Fifa\u2019s 2010 decision to stage the tournament in Qatar, a vote the US Justice Department said was impacted by bribes paid to executive committee members of soccer\u2019s governing body. In 2015, Fifa moved the tournament to winter from its traditional June/July slot, a shift into the middle of the European club season that will limit pre-tournament training to one week and eliminated the possibility of the US Soccer Federation\u2019s usual sendoff series. The Americans have just three more warmup matches, at El Salvador on Tuesday in the Nations League and exhibitions in Europe on 23 and 27 September, likely against Asian opponents. The 15th-ranked US open the World Cup against No 18 Wales on 21 November, face No 5 England in a Black Friday matchup four days later and finish the first round against No 21 Iran on 29 November."

                    "body": "Steven Taylor felt quietly optimistic. His team, Gulf United, were on a winning run and he was rather proud of the tactical trap he had set for their high-profile English opponents. The consequent realisation that there would be no ambush in the warm desert air proved suitably brutal. \u201cI remember thinking: \u2018We\u2019ll give Newcastle a good run for their money,\u2019\u201d he says from Dubai. \u201cBut we were 3-0 down after 20 minutes. Newcastle won 5-0 and put on a show. They were special. My boys were: \u2018Wow.\u2019\u201d  Admittedly it was only a friendly but, after spending time with Eddie Howe and his squad in the United Arab Emirates last March, Taylor became convinced his old club were renascent. Sure enough, Newcastle now sit third in the Premier League and on Tuesday night visit Southampton for the opening leg of an eagerly anticipated Carabao Cup tie. It is their first domestic semi-final since 2005 in the FA Cup. Now Taylor is a highly regarded young manager whose achievement in leading Gulf United to promotion from the UAE\u2019s third tier last season has not gone unnoticed in elite coaching circles but, 18 years ago, he was 19 and impressing in central defence under Graeme Souness. Despite the presence of Alan Shearer and Patrick Kluivert in black and white stripes, a meeting with Manchester United at Cardiff\u2019s Millennium Stadium proved too much for a Newcastle side unsettled by Sir Bobby Robson\u2019s sacking the previous August. \u201cManchester United were at a different level,\u201d says Taylor, who spent 13 years at Newcastle, making more than 200 appearances. \u201cCristiano Ronaldo, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Wayne Rooney, Paul Scholes, Roy Keane and Nemanja Vidic were just exceptional.\u201d  By the final whistle Van Nistelrooy had scored twice and Scholes and Ronaldo had registered a goal apiece in a 4-1 victory, with Shola Ameobi\u2019s consolation offering Souness little solace. Taylor prefers to remember the preamble. \u201cGoing down to Cardiff the atmosphere was incredible,\u201d he says. \u201cOur support was phenomenal: everywhere you looked it was all black and white. In the coach going to the game I saw our fans standing on top of a bus stop pouring beer over each other, kind of celebrating.\u201d Three days earlier Newcastle had returned from Portugal, where they lost a Uefa Cup quarter-final to Sporting 4-2 on aggregate. After Shearer\u2019s solitary goal won the first leg on Tyneside, plans for the return were derailed by an altercation between Souness and Laurent Robert in the hours before kick-off. \u201cThe Uefa Cup\u2019s the competition I still think we should have won that season,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cWe\u2019d looked in cruise control early on but then Kieron Dyer and Titus Bramble went off injured and Graeme Souness\u2019s fallout with Laurent Robert didn\u2019t help. If all that hadn\u2019t happened I honestly believe we\u2019d have won.\u201d Two years later Mike Ashley became Newcastle\u2019s owner, precipitating an era of underachievement until a Saudi Arabian-led takeover followed by Howe\u2019s appointment in late 2021 transformed the narrative. \u201cA lot of people mention the money [\u00a3200m-plus] the owners have spent,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cBut Eddie Howe\u2019s got the best out of the players he\u2019s inherited. He\u2019s enabled some of them to rediscover their love for the game. He\u2019s given the whole group confidence. His man-management\u2019s so good you can see everyone\u2019s fighting for each other. \u201cAfter leaving Bournemouth he knew he had to change his style and Newcastle are horrible to play against. I\u2019d say they\u2019re the Premier League\u2019s fittest team. Because of their intensity, it\u2019s very difficult to plan how to set up against them. Alongside that, you\u2019ve got St James\u2019 Park. It\u2019s a fortress. The crowd\u2019s absolutely phenomenal. Trust me, teams don\u2019t want to go there. It\u2019s a totally different environment from London or Manchester.\u201d  After Taylor left Newcastle in 2016 \u2013 his last game was a \u201can incredible\u201d 5-1 win over Tottenham on the afternoon Rafael Ben\u00edtez resolved to remain in charge on Tyneside \u2013 he headed to Turkey but decided against joining Fenerbahce after being caught in the middle of a failed military coup. Undeterred, a defender whose England ambitions were thwarted by a series of serious injuries, remained intent on seeing the world. Stints followed in the US playing for Portland Timbers, New Zealand (Wellington Phoenix) and India (Odisha). \u201cTravelling\u2019s opened my eyes to certain things and involved some crazy plane journeys,\u201d says Taylor, who took charge at Gulf United early last year. \u201cBut now I\u2019m enjoying being settled in Dubai and trying to take this club to the next level.  \u201cI think about what my successful ex-managers did. They didn\u2019t tend to take work home and overthink. They didn\u2019t panic. Or overcomplicate things. Players need to buy into what you\u2019re doing; top coaches like Brendan Rodgers and Eddie Howe are so clever at making emotional connections with players. \u201cThere were some big names at Newcastle in the past but they couldn\u2019t handle the pressure. When things aren\u2019t going well it sometimes brings out people\u2019s true characters and, so many times, I saw players sulking, telling their agents they wanted to get away. \u201cA big reason why Newcastle have an opportunity to do something special this season is that no one in Eddie Howe\u2019s squad wants to leave. I\u2019d loved to have had him as my manager.\u201d"

                    "body": "They\u2019d done the hard part without him. Not just hard. Historically hard. When the Canadian men sealed a place at the World Cup for the first time in a lifetime in March, the most remarkable part of this most remarkable journey was that it had been sealed without the country\u2019s talisman. Alphonso Davies had missed the entirety of the second half of Concacaf qualification as John Herdman\u2019s unlikely, unheralded men from the north topped the continent to book their spot in Qatar. The party? That should have been the easy bit. Instead, Canada begin their first post-qualification window in Vancouver on Sunday in dire need of some Davies magic.  In a damaging debacle that started out in slow motion before picking up speed and rapidly running away from them, Canada Soccer managed to sour at worst some of the feel-good factor that the team had worked so hard to build up. Twelve months of positivity and light shadowed in just two weeks of bumbling bureaucracy. Having left it particularly late to book just a single opponent for the current window (rivals Mexico and USA by comparison both had two friendlies confirmed weeks before), Canada Soccer unveiled Iran in mid-May as opposition for the first home game since qualification. It sparked an immediate firestorm. In January 2020, 85 Canadian citizens and permanent resident were among 176 killed when Ukraine Airlines flight PS752 was shot down by Iranian missiles shortly after take-off from Tehran. Inviting the country\u2019s national team, which has been reported to have close ties to members of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard, was a major misjudgement. Prime minister Justin Trudeau immediately labelled the match \u201ca bad idea\u201d. Families of the victims of PS752 lashed Canada Soccer, who initially tried to stand their ground, arguing that the \u201cpower of sport\u201d meant this was all a good thing. When Iranian officials revealed they would be paid C$400,000 for the game, making a profit on a friendly for the first time in 22 years, things snowballed further. The government\u2019s former special advisor to Canada\u2019s response to the tragedy and current High Commission to the UK, Ralph Goodale excoriated the national association. \u201cThis behavior by Canada Soccer is repugnant,\u201d he said. \u201cIt calls into question both the competence and the values of the organization.\u201d Herdman and his players, so recently heralded from all corners of a country that jumped on board as qualification dream became reality, were now bombarded with pleas of protest and anger. Canada Soccer relented and cancelled the game with midfielder Jonathan Osorio later confirming the players had left the association in no doubt about their discomfort and opposition to the game. The 30,000-plus tickets already sold were refunded but the mess didn\u2019t simply end with one right decision finally being made. There was a fresh scramble to find someone, anyone to fill the slot, with Panama, an all-too familiar foe, stepping in. Iran, who will face both the US and England in Qatar, aren\u2019t going away quietly, with officials there saying they\u2019ll sue Canada Soccer for C$10m over the cancellation. An unholy mess. And a wholly unnecessary one too. \u201cNot ideal \u2026 at all,\u201d Craig Forrest, the former Canada and West Ham goalkeeper told the Guardian this week \u201cYou look at this group of players who have done so much to build up excitement and good will. They\u2019re a young, diverse side who stand for so many good things and then you\u2019re going to put them into a position where they\u2019re going to have protestors outside their bus when they arrive for their first game after qualifying? You just didn\u2019t need to do that to them.\u201d Mitigating but minor factors hadn\u2019t helped. Canada Soccer had first focused on securing Tunisia. With Morocco, as well as Belgium and Croatia, in their World Cup group, that would have been a good fit and test but didn\u2019t materialize. The turf field in Vancouver didn\u2019t help attract teams either. But none of this justified all that followed. On the back of the Canadian women\u2019s Olympic glory in Tokyo, the men had helped fulfil Herdman\u2019s prophecy that Canada could become \u201ca football nation\u201d. Their efficiency and execution had helped imbue a sense that after decades of dysfunction, Canada Soccer had its house in order and was able to move in step with two modern, ambitious national teams. The Iran affair has been the record scratch to so much of that. In a country where the battle for sporting hearts and minds, not to mention marketing dollars and media space, is ferocious, its damage may not yet be fully realized. \u201cYears ago if we were playing Iran, it wouldn\u2019t have even got noticed. But suddenly these flawed or wrong decisions are getting noticed big time. You\u2019re under the magnifying glass now. I think there\u2019s a lot of things the CSA aren\u2019t ready for,\u201d added Forrest, who played through so many of the dark times, on and off the pitch. \u201cThe only difference between now and then has been John Herdman who has managed to guide the players through all of the challenges. I don\u2019t think enough has changed.\u201d To emphasize that point, on the Canada Soccer website both the general secretary and deputy general secretary roles are listed as \u201cvacant\u201d. But it has to change \u2013 and fast. The September international window will see Herdman take his team to Europe where Canada could really do with facing some quality opposition. In the longer run, with the 2026 World Cup coming to Canada, the chaos of recent weeks has hardly inspired confidence at Fifa HQ. Both the short and long term are constantly on Herdman\u2019s mind. Being left with Panama and Concacaf Nations League games against Curacao and Honduras in this window is far from ideal. Of the 29 teams qualified for Qatar, 23 have at least one match against fellow World Cup opposition in this window. The US and Mexico arranged two each. Forrest said one of Herdman\u2019s mantras to his players is that they \u201clive in this world of the unexpected and it\u2019s on us to expect it \u2026 and roll with it\u201d. On Sunday in Vancouver they\u2019ll try to do that. There may be a first Canadian cap for teenage attacker Luca Koleosho, who recently made his La Liga debut for Espanyol. But it is Davies who offers the best chance to flip the script. The Bayern Munich star missed the final seven qualifiers due to myocarditis. But it was he who truly sparked the campaign in the first place \u2013 against Panama. An electrifying solo goal against them in Toronto in October was the moment that lit the feel-good fuse in the first place. Back in the fold, and back in the city where he began his professional career as a 16-year-old, a little bit of the same suddenly feels badly needed."

                    "body": "Moeen Ali has admitted England have not played well at the T20 World Cup and challenged the team to establish themselves as a genuinely great white-ball side by adding another trophy to the 50-over World Cup they won at home in 2019. England also reached the final of the 2016 T20 World Cup and the semi-finals of last year\u2019s competition, but Moeen does not believe their previous success is enough for them to be considered a top-level team. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about us being a great white-ball side and the England team has been really good, but we\u2019ve only won one tournament and it\u2019s important we start winning more as a team and as a country,\u201d he said. \u201cThen we can really call ourselves a top side. We are a really good side. I get that, and we have been over a long period, but if we\u2019re going to be a great side we need to win more trophies, and when I look back I want to say: \u2018Yes, I was part of a great side.\u2019\u201d  England have not often looked like that in this tournament so far, having progressed through the Super 12s by beating New Zealand and squeaking past Afghanistan and Sri Lanka after nervous run chases, and despite losing to Ireland. On Thursday they face India in the semi-finals, aware that a significant improvement will be required if they are to reach another final. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve played well in the whole tournament,\u201d Moeen said. \u201cBut we got the job done. We wanted to get to the semis. In the past we\u2019ve played well and got through. This time I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve played well but we\u2019ve got through and the best is yet to come with this side. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve been near where we want to be, but now\u2019s a great opportunity to put that right. You always talk about peaking at the right time and if you just about scrape through it means you can get better. If we play our best cricket in the next two games I believe we win the World Cup.\u201d England are very likely to be forced to change their starting XI for the semi-final, with Dawid Malan having suffered a groin strain against Sri Lanka on Saturday. Team doctors have decided that he does not require a scan but, while he continues to receive treatment, Moeen admitted: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look great.\u201d Early indications are that Phil Salt will come in as a direct replacement, though different options are being discussed. \u201cMala\u2019s obviously a big miss because he\u2019s a brilliant player in T20 cricket and he has been over a long period of time,\u201d Moeen said. \u201cThe great thing with this side is there\u2019s so many options. You can put Ben Stokes at three, you can put Phil Salt at three, myself or whoever, there\u2019s so many options.\u201d Stokes\u2019s innings against Sri Lanka, when he kept his head while all around him were losing their wickets, guiding the team calmly to victory, has confirmed his importance to the side, having previously struggled to make an impact with the bat in Australia. \u201cWe should [all] have played like Stokesy, just get the job done,\u201d Moeen said. \u201cBe ugly and don\u2019t worry what it looks like. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what we should have done as batters \u2013 it was the pressure of the situation, but that\u2019s when you need someone like Stokesy. We need him because he can win you a game like that. He\u2019s calm, he\u2019s been there before and he\u2019s done it \u2013 as long as he was there everybody was fine.\u201d India will represent a much greater challenge. Virat Kohli is the tournament\u2019s leading run-scorer with 246 \u2013 almost double England\u2019s best, Alex Hales\u2019s 125 \u2013 while Suryakumar Yadav is not far behind with 225, scored at the ludicrous strike rate of 193.96.  The 32-year-old Yadav\u2019s 25-ball 61 against Zimbabwe in their final game of the Super 12s was jaw-dropping at times. \u201cHe\u2019s an amazing player,\u201d Moeen said. \u201cI do feel like he\u2019s the best in the world, and he\u2019s one of many good players they have. He\u2019s probably taken T20 cricket to another level \u2013 he\u2019s the first player to come through where you can\u2019t bowl at him when he\u2019s playing well.\u201d Moeen may be able to help England come up with a plan for Kohli, having played with him for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League and bowled him while playing for Chennai Super Kings this year. \u201cI\u2019ve played against these guys quite a lot now so you know a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a team we prepare for everything the day will bring. We\u2019ll know how we\u2019re going to bowl at him, but if we have to change and adapt we\u2019ve got the players to do it. That for me is really important.\u201d"

                    "body": "A proud footballing nation on a lean run of just one win in six games. A humiliating defeat at home against Hungary. And above all, a sense of stasis and frustration, a lack of creativity, the suspicion that for all the talent and trophies in this team, it remains considerably less than the sum of its parts. Germany and England may share a common predicament, but as they prepare to meet on Monday night only one of these nations is currently racked by existential crisis. And curiously, it\u2019s not the one that has bombed out of its last two international tournaments. As Germany slipped to defeat in Leipzig on Friday night, the mood was defined more by indifference than insurrection. The few pockets of boos were drowned out by the sizeable Hungarian contingent, celebrating their first competitive win over Germany since 1985. Nobody was calling for Hansi Flick\u2019s head on a platter. Nobody was writing off the World Cup. Instead, an implacable calm reigned, a sense that whatever their travails, this team will inevitably come good when it matters. \u201cThe coach has it under control,\u201d Joshua Kimmich insisted.  Not that there wasn\u2019t a certain disgruntlement at the defeat, Germany\u2019s first under Flick. It took 37 minutes to register a shot on target, and even if they improved later on, chances remained cherishably rare. \u201cThe first half was just shit,\u201d admitted Jonas Hofmann with impressive bluntness. Flick, for his part, was prepared to take his share of the blame for a bold tactical experiment in which Hoffman \u2013 normally an attacking midfielder \u2013 played at right-back. \u201cIt didn\u2019t work that well,\u201d Flick conceded. But the most telling comment of all came from the stand-in captain Thomas M\u00fcller. \u201cYou notice that many of us are not going through the easiest phase at our club,\u201d the veteran forward said. \u201cWe did not bring our power on to the pitch.\u201d All of which essentially confirmed what many outside the camp have long suspected: that when Bayern Munich sneezes, Germany gets a cold. Were he minded to do so, Flick could draw his entire front six from the current champions: M\u00fcller, Serge Gnabry, Leroy San\u00e9 and Jamal Musiala in the forward positions, Kimmich and Leon Goretzka behind them, with Manuel Neuer in goal. In practice Musiala is more likely to be an impact substitute. Neuer and Goretzka were absent on Friday with Covid issues. But the Bayern influence is indelible, not least in the form of Flick himself, who coached the club to their most recent Champions League in 2020.  M\u00fcller\u2019s words were the first real admission of what many outside the camp have long suspected: that the problems at Bayern under Julian Nagelsmann, where the champions have gone four games without a win, are beginning to bleed into the national team. The lack of a focal point up front. The inability of wingers San\u00e9 and Gnabry to hit a consistent run of form. A certain slowness in the build-up. An imbalance between defence and attack, with Kimmich often the man caught out. And with just two months until Germany begin their World Cup campaign against Japan, perhaps the most pressing question remains unanswered: who starts up front? Timo Werner? Kai Havertz? Nobody? Werner is currently the man in possession \u2013 Flick is a fan of his speed, his work-rate and aggression off the ball \u2013 but has scored in just one of his last six games. Lukas Nmecha of Wolfsburg is highly rated but not (yet) a consistent scoring threat. Which is why there is increasing speculation that there may still be time for a late bolter such as Niclas F\u00fcllkrug of Werder Bremen or Nils Petersen at Freiburg to make the plane.  None of which, curiously enough, seems to have made the slightest dent in Germany\u2019s confidence. There appears to be a broad assumption that once the minor issues have been tweaked and the tournament mentality kicks in, Germany will be fine. \u201cThey are all competitive players, all winners,\u201d trilled Oliver Bierhoff, now the team director at the German FA. Flick was of a similar mind: \u201cMaybe the defeat came at the right time, rather than at the World Cup,\u201d he observed. There is a stark contrast here to England\u2019s wall of wailing, and perhaps it is one that speaks to the respective footballing maturity of these two nations. In England we remain essentially incapable of analysing the national team without resorting to the register of crisis, hyperbole and ultimacy: he\u2019s done, she\u2019s finished, they\u2019ll never win a thing, it\u2019s coming home. Imagine if it were Southgate who had failed to reach the quarter-finals in 2018 and 2021, who had been drawn in a group with Spain, who still didn\u2019t have a recognised striker, who was dangerously beholden to a single struggling club. By contrast, you sense Germany are perfectly happy to leave the worrying to others."

Of course we will because even when his involvement is increasingly, almost comically peripheral, everything ultimately ends up being about Him. But first a nod to the players and supporters of Morocco, to whom Tuesday really belonged. Following the north African side\u2019s win against the throwback tiki-taka scamperers of Spain (possession: 77%, passes: 1,019, goals: 0), scarcely a U2 pun went unpunished as shootout hero Bono and chums celebrated a dogged, obdurate and thoroughly deserved victory. On a truly Beautiful Day for Moroccan football, it was One in which their fans in Qatar, at home and elsewhere took understandably immense Pride. Scarcely a car horn went unparped on the streets of Casablanca by fans who will be hoping their team, who have conceded just one goal \u2013 an own goal \u2013 in their past eight matches can play it again in such fine style against Portugal, whose impressive demolition job on the Switzerland has been predictably overshadowed by the most conspicuous absence of the name \u201cRonaldo\u201d from an official team sheet since the temporary omission of a certain Brazilian prior to the final in 1998.  While it has since emerged that the Brazilian Ronaldo was ill and almost certainly should have sat that game out, his Portuguese namesake has been suffering from nothing more serious than an inflated sense of self-regard, a form of pyromania that has led him to incinerate a couple of big bridges in under a month. No longer the footballing force he once was, Cristiano Ronaldo remains an intimidating presence on the pitch but for some time now it has looked like it is only his own teammates, rather than opponents, who are cowed by him. \u201cI\u2019m quite surprised but not overly shocked,\u201d said the great Ally McCoist on ITV. \u201cHaving said that, I must say I am slightly shocked, of that there is no doubt.\u201d Not for the first time in this tournament, Coisty succinctly captured the global mood in a nutshell. While Fernando Santos\u2019s decision to bench his show pony in favour of starting the young Benfica striker Gon\u00e7alo Ramos was a Big Call, it quickly proved the right one. Within 17 minutes the fresh-faced 21-year-old had passed Ronaldo\u2019s career tally of zero World Cup knockout stage goals and missed a couple of presentable chances but finished the game with this tournament\u2019s first hat-trick. And while the man he replaced joined in the goal celebrations before helping to close out the game ahead of an abrupt post-match scuttle down the tunnel, we can but guess what he made of what was ultimately a very public and brutal humiliation. \u201cWe wanted a team that played with a lot of fluidity,\u201d said Santos, when asked about his decision to drop Ronaldo, among other big but not quite so stellar names. \u201cCristiano is more fixed, he stays in a more determined role towards the box. Gon\u00e7alo has different characteristics: he is very dynamic and that\u2019s what he ended up showing us.\u201d With Morocco to come, Ramos seems to have made himself undroppable, while on the other hand his forlorn and beleaguered captain increasingly seems unpickable.

I was with a few friends in Puerto Escondido in Mexico when we celeb-spotted our Max, who was an absolute delight. We were living in Cambridge at the time, and Max, being a local, was keen to send our custom to the Salisbury Arms, not far from the station. Great beers (not just for those in the royal boxes) and artisan pizzas. Don\u2019t thank me, thank Max\u201d \u2013 Theo B-P.   As a Cambridge resident, may I suggest the Free Press or the Panton Arms (five and 10 minutes out of the centre, respectively). Or the Elm Tree (the Hobbit pub) and The Champion of the Thames if they just want beer. \u2018Proper\u2019 pubs, all. In the centre of town, though, especially for USA! USA!!

Fiba has opened an investigation after the players were filmed physically fighting one another following their World Cup loss to Serbia in Sydney. The scuffle between Salimatou Kourouma and Kamite Elisabeth Dabou broke out during a post-match interview with Serbia\u2019s Sasa Cado in the mixed zone and was captured by a Serbian news camera. Kourouma is contracted with Stade Malien, a professional team based in Mali\u2018s capital city Bamako, while Dabou plays for Centre Dorinthie Basket.  After the 88-65 loss to Canada (4-1) at the Sydney Olympic Park Sports Centre, Kourouma and Dabou fronted the media to express contrition. \u201cWe were frustrated because of the loss so we are here to apologise to the world of basketball, Fiba, the World Cup,\u201d Kourouma said on the pair\u2019s behalf. \u201cWe\u2019re here to apologise for the image that was put on social media. It was not our intention.\u201d As the world governing body deliberates on whether to impose sanctions, Mali coach Joaquin Brizuela Carrion said he did not consider dropping the pair. \u201cThese were two of our key players so even though it was a sad incident, it was more about that they wanted to play basketball,\u201d Brizuela said. \u201cWe wanted to play at a higher level, and they did show that today.\u201d As one of only two sides to have lost all five games in the group stage, Mali did not progress to the quarter-finals so any sanctions will not affect their World Cup campaign. \u201cFIBA acknowledged today that there was an altercation between Mali players in the mixed zone following the Group B game Serbia-Mali at the FIBA Women\u2019s Basketball World Cup 2022,\u201d FIBA said in a statement.  \u201cFollowing the incident, FIBA has opened an investigation. Once the investigation is concluded, FIBA will decide on any applicable disciplinary measures.\u201d Mali qualified for their second World Cup as a late replacement for Nigeria, who pulled out citing administrative difficulties around the sport in their country. The lowest-ranked side at the tournament at No 37 in the world, Mali have been somewhat competitive in patches but a 118-58 loss to Australia was a low point. They are still to play Group B co-leaders Canada, who were undefeated until Monday night\u2019s thrilling three-point defeat to the Opals."

                    "body": "Like many of those similarly afflicted, I don\u2019t know West Ham without my dad, or my dad without West Ham. My earliest memories of Saturday afternoons are of crackling football commentary on a transistor radio, as his tea cooled in a 70s brown and orange mug \u2013 a familiar place of safety and happiness. Like our shared big noses, my support for West Ham wasn\u2019t something I could really choose of my own free will. As a teenager I was still listening to matches on the radio while I did my homework, but gradually the emotional pull of football waned. The son of one of mum\u2019s best friends, who was the same age as me, was murdered in an incident connected to Scottish football sectarianism. I rolled my eyes at the naff jingoism surrounding the 1996 European Championships. Above all, the sport seemed at odds with my growing confusion about my sexuality. During the 1990s, it was a pillar of the homophobic lad culture that I encountered at school, in the media, on the stands when dad and I went to Upton Park, and in the brutal treatment of the gay footballer Justin Fashanu, who died by suicide in 1998. I felt excluded from football, and music took over as my life\u2019s passion. Over the years, however, I couldn\u2019t keep my love of West Ham down. I kept track of the Hammers\u2019 (mis)fortunes and watched the occasional game. I was an out bisexual male and closet football fan. This all changed when, a few years ago, I found West Ham\u2019s LGBT+ fan group, Pride of Irons. Made up of members who are gay, lesbian, trans, bisexual, non-binary and straight too, it provides a space that offers the rest of society a lesson in how to get through thorny issues with dialogue, humour and acceptance. Whether or not people have boycotted the Qatar World Cup, for instance, has been approached without judgment. I don\u2019t get to go to pre-and-post match meet-ups as often as I\u2019d like, but the 2019 Pride march in London, riding in a bus accompanied by West Ham\u2019s Hammerhead mascot, was a total hoot, and the Pride of Irons WhatsApp group is the only one I haven\u2019t left. When my son was born in late January 2022, I was surprised that for the first time in years I felt confused about my identity. I was a new dad in a monogamous relationship with a member of the opposite sex. What could be \u201cstraighter\u201d than that? Was I letting everyone else down? Bisexual people are frequently erased from the LGBT+ community and I\u2019d grown up with prejudice from gay men as much as I had from the straight world. Would Pride of Irons be accepting? On a Saturday morning in February I left my boy snuffling in his mum\u2019s arms to go and stand in the cold outside the London Stadium as part of a Pride of Irons protest in light of the new Saudi owners of Newcastle United, who West Ham were playing that afternoon. We practised unfurling banners for the cameras as we kept our eyes open for the arrival of the Newcastle team, with a few false alarms as their supporter coaches drove past in a blur of \u201cwanker\u201d fists. One of the other POI members congratulated me on having a baby, asked how it was all going, and why I hadn\u2019t mentioned anything to the rest of the group. I explained my insecurities. He told me I was being daft, spoke about his own kids, and said that I was as welcome or valid as anyone else. Of all the pieces of encouragement anyone has given me over the past 10 months since my son was born, this has meant the most. The next week, when my mate Grant gave me his spare birthday present ticket to the fancy seats for a solid 1-0 win over Wolves, he took this photo of me in front of the Pride of Irons banner at the London Stadium, feeling as sure of who I am as I have ever been. I often croon the club song, I\u2019m Forever Blowing Bubbles, to my boy as a soothing lullaby: \u201c\u2026 fortune\u2019s always hiding, I\u2019ve looked everywhere\u201d. It\u2019s probably for the best to get him used to it early. If his dad and grandad have now endured over a half century of disappointment then I am afraid it\u2019s his destiny too, whoever he turns out to be.

                    "body": "1) Marsch hopes Anfield can relaunch Leeds\u2019 season Inconceivable. That could apply to the decline of a team who were challenging on all fronts six months ago, have reached the knockout stage of the Champions League, yet find themselves adrift in the title race having dropped points in eight of 12 matches this season. But it was the word Jesse Marsch used to describe Leeds\u2019 first win over Liverpool since April 2001 \u2013 prefixed by \u201calmost\u201d, admittedly \u2013 as the under-pressure manager savoured the release of a dramatic late victory at Anfield. The emotional celebrations were understandable but did not cloud Marsch\u2019s assessment that Leeds cannot waste the chance to launch their season. With three of the current top four to play after Bournemouth\u2019s visit to Elland Road next Saturday, his realism made sense. \u201cWe should not be in this position, we should not be suffering the way we are,\u201d said Marsch. \u201cBut we haven\u2019t found ways to reward ourselves. Part of it is we are a young team. We needed a moment in our season to stop the bleeding and to get it here is almost inconceivable. But we can\u2019t just rely on one game. We need to build momentum in our season.\u201d Andy Hunter  Match report: Liverpool 1-2 Leeds   2) Cucurella makes torrid return to Brighton Marc Cucurella is struggling. The Spanish defender has had a difficult start to life at Chelsea and it did not get any better for him when he returned to Brighton on Saturday. Brighton\u2019s fans had not forgotten how Cucurella forced his way out of the club last summer and they delighted in watching him fail to contain Solly March, who had the freedom of the right flank because of Graham Potter\u2019s cavalier decision to field Raheem Sterling at left wing-back for Chelsea. Sterling offered Cucurella, who was at left centre-back, zero protection and the home side duly ran riot. Nothing went right for Chelsea. They were comfortably outplayed and the individual concerns over Cucurella are growing. His defending has been ragged, his distribution iffy, and he has been substituted early in four of his last five starts; not the best look for a player who cost \u00a362.5m. Jacob Steinberg  Match report: Brighton 4-1 Chelsea   3) Nelson makes his case from the bench Reiss Nelson has had to wait patiently for his chance but the Arsenal attacker took full advantage during their dismantling of Nottingham Forest. Nelson was brought on for Bukayo Saka in the first half and played a huge role in the rout. Two goals at the start of the second half and an assist added up to an outstanding return that suggests he can play a valuable role in their squad this season. \u201cNot only me but all his staff and teammates are so happy for him, because he\u2019s really evolving and maturing,\u201d said Mikel Arteta. \u201cHe\u2019s showing every day how much he wants it. Today he had that opportunity and he did extremely well.\u201d It was only Nelson\u2019s fourth appearance of the season and his first in the Premier League but he played with the confidence and touch of a first-team regular. It will surely not be his last meaningful contribution. Simon Mail  Match report: Arsenal 5-0 Nottingham Forest   4) Guardiola looks ahead to City\u2019s home comforts \u201cI know the calendar,\u201d Pep Guardiola said a little menacingly a half-hour or so after victory at Leicester, proceeding to rattle off how Chelsea host Arsenal and Tottenham entertain Liverpool before the World Cup break. Chelsea also travel to Newcastle before the Premier League halts. The point Guardiola was making was that his Manchester City side must try to make the most of a relatively kind schedule. They have four successive home games before eyeballs turn to Qatar, including a Carabao Cup tie with Chelsea and league matches against Fulham and Brentford. Rivals are likely to drop points and City will hope to avoid fatigue and defeat. \u201cWe can arrive after the World Cup being there on top of the league,\u201d Guardiola said. Ben Fisher  Match report: Leicester 0-1 Manchester City  5) Mart\u00ednez\u2019s injury points to concussion concerns It is a measure of Newcastle\u2019s progress that two national coaches, England\u2019s Gareth Southgate and Brazil\u2019s Tite, watched Eddie Howe\u2019s side shred Aston Villa, scoring four fine goals. In scoring two and helping create both of the others, Wilson emphasised that he should be nailed on as Harry Kane\u2019s international understudy. He has surely booked a place in Southgate\u2019s Qatar-bound World Cup squad. While Howe\u2019s impressive team seem genuinetop-four contenders, Aston Villa\u2019s incoming manager, Unai Emery, has much to do when he begins work on Tuesday. One priority must be reviewing the club\u2019s concussion protocols. Despite requiring prolonged treatment after his teammate, Tyrone Mings, accidentally drove a knee into his head, Emiliano Mart\u00ednez continued for a further 12 minutes before collapsing unchallenged after collecting a cross and finally being helped off the pitch. Why did Villa not replace their goalkeeper immediately after the Mings collision? Louise Taylor  Match report: Newcastle 4-0 Aston Villa   6) Antonio has a future as a West Ham supersub Michail Antonio last started a Premier League game in mid-September but he has a potential future as a supersub. At Old Trafford, he was called for after 57 fruitless minutes for Gianluca Scamacca. Antonio offering variety could be important for David Moyes, who has lacked a backup option of note for a long time. Antonio went on and made Lisandro Mart\u00ednez know of his presence immediately, producing the sort of shoulder barge that would leave a lesser player requiring a month in bed. Manchester United knew they were in a battle and had to adapt to the new challenge, doing so successfully \u2013 but only just. He lost out to defenders on a couple of headers but the pressure was certainly increased on the opposing backline and he forced David de Gea into a fine tip over the bar with a rising drive. Antonio can continue to have similar impacts and in modern football there is no great shame in being a very effective substitute. Will Unwin   Match report: Manchester United 1-0 West Ham  7) Moore\u2019s strength vital for Cherries and Wales Kieffer Moore is non-conventional. His route to the Premier League \u2013 signed by Yeovil Town from non-league Dorchester only to endure back-to-back relegations; a brief stint with Norway\u2019s Viking FK; a whistle-stop UK tour taking in Ipswich, Barnsley, Wigan, and finally Bournemouth \u2013 was non-conventional. His playing style \u2013 6ft 5in battering ram centre-forward \u2013 is, by modern standards, non-conventional. But against Tottenham on Saturday, Moore was too much for the visitors to handle. A goal in each half came through a pair of differing first-time finishes. He steered the opener home with his right foot, before later stooping for a header of strength and bravery. He did not deserve to finish on the losing side. Still, there were signs of promise for both Bournemouth and Wales. Sam Dalling  Match report: Bournemouth 2-3 Tottenham  8) Lampard and Silva are at clubs that suit them \u201cI have to remind you that in our first season [at] Everton we finished in eighth,\u201d said Marco Silva. \u201cUntil the last game we were competing for the Europa League.\u201d Silva was standing his ground determinedly, just as Fulham had been denied victory by the brilliance of Jordan Pickford, and some prime defending by Conor Coady and James Tarkowski. His sacking in December 2019 clearly still rankles but at Fulham his attacking style of play is highly appreciated. Frank Lampard, meanwhile, suits Everton\u2019s current needs well, and deserves credit for reviving his career and reputation by saving the club from relegation before making them hard to beat this season. \u201cLast year we would lose that game so there is progress, but I want more,\u201d he said. Everton remain blunt in attack but Lampard\u2019s relative success and Fulham\u2019s excellent season so far under Silva reminds us certain clubs suit certain managers. Finding those combinations is the difficult bit. John Brewin  Match report: Fulham 0-0 Everton   9) Palace continue to lack a top finisher Patrick Vieira\u2019s tenure at Crystal Palace has been quietly impressive so far, the manager having succeeded in transforming an uncomplicated counterpunching side into one that attacks with far more imagination, all without sacrificing any resilience at the back. The one glaring absence, though, is a goalscoring striker \u2013 a situation compounded by Conor Gallagher\u2019s return to Chelsea and mitigated only partly by Wilfried Zaha\u2019s output. With 88 goals in four seasons for Celtic, Odsonne \u00c9douard was signed to fill that gap but a piddling total of six last term did not befit an attack featuring two of the country\u2019s most fearsome wingers. The Frenchman\u2019s record is little improved much this season but his three goals so far \u2013 close-range conversions to cap passages of smart buildup play \u2013 at least offer a decent blueprint for the type of striker Palace need. If \u00c9douard doesn\u2019t improve soon, Vieira should be on the lookout for a more predatory centre-forward capable of spearheading a charge for Europe. Ivan Toney perhaps? Alex Hess  Match report: Crystal Palace 1-0 Southampton  10) Costa\u2019s red card so wasteful for Wolves There were signs that Diego Costa was finding sharpness in the draw with Brentford. A neat feint and drag past Ben Mee in the second half left the impressive centre-back flailing and the former Spain international\u2019s vicious low shot was well stopped by David Raya. His link-up play and movement looked to be improving, too. Having scored only six Premier League goals this season, Wolves desperately needed the veteran striker to quickly find fitness and form to help lift them away from the relegation zone. The hard work on getting up to speed was wasted when the forward headbutted Mee over absolutely nothing. It was an astonishing lack of discipline and the straight red card \u2013 Costa\u2019s first in the Premier League, surprisingly \u2013 means the 34-year-old is now suspended until Boxing Day. Another extended break will mean Costa has to work again to find match fitness. Wolves might be wondering whether signing him was worth it. Gregg Bakowski  Match report: Brentford 1-1 Wolves  "

To receive the full version once a week, just pop your email in below:  When England welcome the USA to Wembley on Friday night we are in for a treat. It is a great match-up and a great opportunity for England to get a measure of where they are, even if everything doesn\u2019t go to plan against the world champions. They\u2019ll want to win, but draw or lose and there is time, before the World Cup kicks off next summer, to say: \u201cOK, we\u2019ve got time, let\u2019s work on this.\u201d I\u2019m fortunate enough to have played against the USA at international level with England and to have played alongside many brilliant members of the US women\u2019s national team at club level in the States. When I played against them there was 100% a fear factor. There was such a high level of respect for what they\u2019d achieved as a nation. They were the elite. They were the pioneers. In our game, they were the ones leading the charge and everyone else had to try to catch up and match it. In the quarter-final of the 2007 World Cup in China we lost 3-0. It was always a really tough game against the USA. They had so many good internationals and such a wide pool of talent. We were competing against players who had more resources available to them while we were amateurs, working hard to try to compete on a physical level. That was always our priority, trying to get as fit as we could to match the intensity of their game.  Even then they were household names. Heather O\u2019Reilly, Carli Lloyd, Christie Rampone, Kristine Lilly \u2013 the media would reference them and that built the intimidation. They had so much more exposure than us and they reached the latter stages of major competitions time and time again. What\u2019s exciting now is that the fear factor has gone. England\u2019s Euro 2022 win \u2013 and the team having proved they can compete against the best in the world \u2013 has given a sense of belief that is shifting that mentality. English football has gone from amateurism to a professional game. These players experience pressure and expectation in a way many in past generations, in my generation, didn\u2019t. Now we have an England team that is fully supported in their bid to be complete professionals. In 2009, I swapped Chelsea for Sky Blue in New Jersey. I stayed in the US for three years and I got to understand the American psyche, culture and mentality that has become synonymous with the women\u2019s national team. When you experience that you really begin to understand why they are a dominant force in women\u2019s football and why they are winners. The biggest learning was that it\u2019s OK to be yourself. Everyone\u2019s aware of their social surroundings to some extent but there were players who just didn\u2019t care what people thought of them. It was: \u201cThis is me, take it or leave it, I believe I\u2019m the best, I\u2019m good enough and I\u2019m not afraid to express that.\u201d They had that aura about them that, to those on the outside, could be perceived as arrogance but it\u2019s a cultural difference. We\u2019re so inward in the UK \u2013 don\u2019t show you\u2019re confident, don\u2019t show you believe in yourself \u2013 whereas they just outwardly project that belief and that helps create that fear factor and intimidates the opposition. It also meant I always had the feeling I couldn\u2019t rest. You go to training and it\u2019s not like you could just chill out, because there\u2019s someone right on your shoulder going: \u201cI\u2019m going to take your spot because I\u2019m doing more than you in this area, that area, this area.\u201d That\u2019s the part I really respected and admired.  So much of football is in the mind. Everyone can physically do things, they wouldn\u2019t be there otherwise, every player can probably technically execute most things, but the belief and that autopilot mode, that\u2019s what you want to see from players. That only comes if you give them space and you cultivate the environment that allows them to feel free, to make mistakes and to be creative. That\u2019s what Sarina Wiegman has instilled in this England team: they know who they are, they know what they\u2019re about and they know how to play in and out of possession. They\u2019re almost like: \u201cCome on, we\u2019re England, we\u2019re going to take the game to the opposition, you try to stop us.\u201d To have that kind of feeling is so powerful. Talking points \u201cSystemic abuse\u201d: A year-long investigation has found abuse and sexual misconduct in the NWSL \u201chad become systematic\u201d and US Soccer has said it will immediately implement reforms as a result. The former deputy US attorney general Sally Yates was appointed by US Soccer after allegations against the former North Carolina Courage manager Paul Riley triggered waves of further allegations across the sport. \u201cOur investigation has revealed a league in which abuse and misconduct \u2013 verbal and emotional abuse and sexual misconduct \u2013 had become systemic, spanning multiple teams, coaches, and victims,\u201d the report said. \u201cAbuse in the NWSL is rooted in a deeper culture in women\u2019s soccer that normalises verbally abusive coaching and blurs boundaries between coaches and players.\u201d Spanish chaos: Spain manager Jorge Vilda has left the 15 players who staged a mutiny against his tenure out of the squad for the games against Sweden and the USA. They had declared themselves unavailable for selection and alleged that playing under Vilda was affecting their \u201cemotional state\u201d and \u201chealth\u201d. The national federation responded with a statement that said the players would not be able to return to the fold unless they \u201cadmit their error and apologise\u201d.

                    "body": "\nMain event\nAfrica spans 30.37m square kilometres, taking in more than 1.2 billion people, who speak between 1,000 and 2,000 languages across 54 countries. These are aspects not always obvious from the monolithic way a continent of wondrous diversity is written about and discussed, something the World Cup has brought into even sharper focus.\nOf course, it remains true and significant that Morocco \u2013 who face France in this evening\u2019s second semi-final \u2013 are the first African side to reach this stage of the competition. But, though Walid Regragui\u2019s men no doubt feel the honour of that joyous achievement, what is also evident is the extent to which it is particular and specific.\n\nMorocco is a Muslim country, and before the last-16 penalty shootout against Spain, the players recited Surah al-Fatiha, the first chapter of the Qur\u2019an. Then, after securing passage to the quarter-final and also after winning it, the squad ran to their fans and prostrated themselves in prayer \u2013 in the process, declaring to the planet not only their pride in being Moroccan but their pride in Islam, inspiring ecstatic celebrations throughout the Muslim world.\nWith good reason. There is no World Cup of discrimination nor should there be \u2013 every minority and every ethnic group has its challenges, and the way these are overcome is with unity not rivalry. But anyone whose eyes are prepared to see knows that Muslims are persecuted in many nations, whether by discrimination when seeking employment, backhanded insults and equivocations in news reports, or outright violence. And as with many forms of prejudice, it is women who often bear the brunt.\nSo to see Moroccan players paying homage to Allah before applying Allah\u2019s teaching to pay homage to their mothers \u2013 who were wearing hijab! At the game! On global television! \u2013 was not only beautiful, moving and uplifting, but important, crystallising the crux of international competition: to learn about different cultures; to share love by celebrating difference; to make the world a better place. Amin. DH\nTalking points\n\u00c1lvarez creating space for Messi to express his geniusLionel Messi is good at football \u2013 you may have noticed \u2013 and in his brilliance over the last week, there\u2019s been something reminiscent of Zinedine Zidane \u2013 also good at football \u2013 who, at the 2006 World Cup, dredged up the display of his dotage when France beat Brazil in the quarter-final, then scored the winner as they eliminated Portugal in the semi. What these efforts have in common is, of course, ridiculous genius \u2013 but there\u2019s more to it than that. Just as Zidane had the intelligent, tenacious running of Thierry Henry, Florent Malouda and Franck Rib\u00e9ry ahead of him, so Messi\u2019s influence is intensified by the exuberance and aggression of Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez stretching the play, which gives him space in which to work and a target to hit. Consequently, whoever Argentina meet in the final will need a plan \u2013 not just to combat the respective individuals, but their burgeoning partnership. DH\nShould the England manager always be English?When Jamie Carragher tweeted \u201cThe @England manager should always be English!\u201d he started a discourse which then escalated rapidly. Anyone who\u2019s looking to irreparably damage their wellbeing: by all means, read the quote tweets. On the one hand, Englishness is an arbitrary characteristic which does not make someone good or bad at being a football manager, in the same way as once having had red hair does not make someone a good Fifa president. On the other, it may well have helped Gareth Southgate, for instance, that he was already deeply familiar with the internal workings of the FA and the wider context of English football when he stepped up from managing the under-21s in 2016. Every manager who has won the men\u2019s World Cup has been the same nationality as the team they coached to victory. Does that mean a foreign manager could never win the tournament? The obvious answer is: no, it does not, but that would be a great question to ask on Twitter if you wanted your mentions to be an absolute bin fire. WM\n\nBeyond the football\nFifpro, the global professional footballers\u2019 union, says it is \u201cshocked and sickened\u201d by reports emerging from Iran that Amir Nasr-Azadani is facing execution after \u201ccampaigning for women\u2019s rights and basic freedom in his country\u201d. Fifpro added that it \u201cstands in solidarity with Amir and call for the immediate removal of his punishment\u201d.\nNasr-Azadani, a 26-year-old defender who last played for Tractor in Iran\u2019s Pro League, is one of six people Amnesty have said could be awaiting or undergoing trial on charges carrying the death penalty. On Tuesday, courts in Tehran sentenced more than 400 people to prison terms for charges related to recent protests in the country.\n\nGlobal media-watch\nBefore France\u2019s clash with Morocco, some focus in the French press was on the gulf in status between the squad. In Lib\u00e9ration one data exercise looked at their comparable transfer values, claiming Les Bleus are valued at nearly \u20ac1bn while Morocco\u2019s players are worth less than \u20ac250m. The paper also took a more historical view of the links between the nations, reviving the memory of Larbi Ben Barek. The Moroccan-born player appeared for France 17 times, but the gap between his debut in December 1938 and his final cap in October 1954 made him not only one of the most successful French-African players of the era, but the longest-serving French international of all-time.\nThe historian Yvan Gastaut explored the colonial history between the two nations in Le Monde. \u201cEven today, the French championship is still more prestigious and players will always choose to play for the French team rather than the Moroccan team if they have the choice,\u201d he wrote. This may come as some news to French-born Romain Sa\u00efss, who has excelled in Qatar. He chose Morocco over France, and has plied his club trade in England and Turkey rather than Ligue 1.\n\nIn Morocco\u2019s French-language Le Matin, Abderrahmane Ichi predicted a tactical battle on Wednesday night, saying \u201ceven if coach Walid Regragui is, as usual, showing modesty \u2026 he has been able to respond to the tactical patterns of his opponents and has managed to outsmart them. Roberto Mart\u00ednez, Luis Enrique and Fernando Santos know all about it.\u201d\nIn another Le Matin piece, Youssef Moutmaine recalled that in 2016, Marco van Basten lambasted one of Morocco\u2019s stars for opting to play for the Atlas Lions. \u201cThese are stupid choices, they are stupid boys who should have had a little patience. Hakim Ziyech is a great player but how can you be stupid enough to opt for Morocco when you are eligible for the Dutch team?\u201d Moutmaine writes that Ziyech said he had chosen with his heart, and notes: \u201cWhen it comes down to it, Mr Van Basten, the choice of the heart has not turned out so stupid after all\u201d. MBe\nThe internet reacts\nThis clip of the football reporter Carrie Brown has warmed hearts on social media, as she explains how Raheem Sterling and Kieran Trippier took the time to join a video call with her parents, who both have dementia. The two England players also chatted online with staff at their care home, and Brown said: \u201cThat will stay with me longer than any goal at this tournament.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, USA fans wonder if Gio Reyna\u2019s growing war of words with his head coach, Gregg Berhalter, might mean their team are finally in the big leagues:\n\nThroughout the tournament, ITV viewers have tweeted their love for Ally McCoist while being less enthusiastic about some of the channel\u2019s other commentators. And they were quick to notice when McCoist was added to the mix for Argentina v Croatia:\n\nBrazil may have watched Argentina\u2019s march to the final with some regret but at least they have found their next great striker, even if if Richarlison says it himself:\n\nToday\u2019s match\nFrance v Morocco (Semi-final, 7pm GMT, BBC One) When it comes to football matches with deep historical significance, it doesn\u2019t get much bigger than a World Cup semi-final between France and Morocco. With a relationship which is inextricably tied up in the story of French colonialism but also shaped by close linguistic, social and cultural links, there is a political dimension to the game which is impossible to overlook. As the first African and Arab representative to reach the semi-finals, Morocco will draw widespread support from countries with shared heritage as well as the Moroccan diaspora in Europe. \u201cWe have made our people and our continent so happy and proud,\u201d said Walid Regragui. \u201cWhen you watch Rocky, you want to support Rocky Balboa and I think we are the Rocky of this World Cup.\u201d France are firm favourites, but then so were Spain and Portugal. WM\n\nPlayer to watch\nAchraf Hakimi On Saturday, it was Kyle Walker\u2019s turn. Now, it\u2019s Achraf Hakimi\u2019s. Walker, to his credit, did an excellent job of keeping Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 quiet even as England lost their quarter-final against France, but Hakimi needs no lessons in how to contain the Paris Saint-Germain forward. Teammates at club level, the pair will have faced off countless times in training and should know each other inside out. As much as Morocco need to stifle Mbapp\u00e9, France will need to keep an eye on his opposite man. One of the best attacking right-backs in world football, Hakimi is crucial to Morocco\u2019s counterattacking game and could be extremely dangerous. WM\nAnd finally \u2026\nThe France captain, Hugo Lloris, has revealed that he texted Harry Kane after the 2-1 win over England but \u201cit was not easy to find the words\u201d after his Tottenham teammate\u2019s heartbreaking penalty miss. Judging by these supportive words, Lloris didn\u2019t just send him a row of laughing emojis. \u201cI think he can be proud of what he has done for the national team,\u201d he told reporters at France\u2019s press conference to preview the Morocco match.\n\n\u201cIn football history, many top players have missed penalties in their career \u2013 Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo \u2013 but I have no doubt Harry will keep his chin up and help Tottenham and the national team to shine.\u201d GB"

Thanks all for your company and comments \u2013 sorry I couldn\u2019t use them all \u2013 and enjoy the three more games we\u2019ve got for you over the next eight or so hours. Peace out!      12.47pm    Here\u2019s Andy Hunter\u2019s report on a match of devastating unreality.       12.40pm    \u201cVAR gives penalties and cancels open play goals,\u201d says Robert. Just what everyone was clamouring for before its introduction.\u201d And he then returns with a plan: \u201cHere is a penalty kick law that enhances the proportionality of the sanction while still providing extra punishment for fouls in the penalty area. \u200eOne does not wish to encourage defensive fouls near their own goal, and direct free kicks (with walls etc) are generally an underwhelming and timewasting spectacle. Instead we get an interesting contest between kicker and keeper from a variety of places in the penalty area.  have the penalty kick for most offences taken from the place of the offence however, penalty kicks awarded for DOGSO offences (anywhere on the field), and deliberate offences in the penalty area against an opponent which are not an attempt to play/challenge for the ball, are taken from the penalty mark attacking team can elect to take an indirect free kick instead of a penalty kick from the place of the offence offences in the goal area are deemed to occur on the nearest point on the long line of the goal area the goalkeeper can always elect to defend a penalty kick from the penalty mark no follow-on play from penalty kicks - the only outcome is a goal or goal kick\u201d  There\u2019s a lot to digest there. One thing I would say is that part of football\u2019s charm is its simplicity, so I\u2019d want any solution to be as clear as possible, not just for elite level but for every level, playground included. But I see a lot of the rationale.  Updated at 12.41pm GMT    12.32pm    \u201cIn the queue for the Denmark v Tunisia game,\u201demails Hugh Molloy, \u201cand a massive cheer went up on the final whistle.\u201d I\u2019ll bet. There\u2019s nothing like the World Cup for simultaneously making the world bigger and smaller. Enjoy!   Updated at 12.36pm GMT    12.29pm    And here\u2019s our majestic cartoonist\u2019s take on things\u2026      12.28pm    I mentioned this at the time, but I loved how Roy Keane crystallised things, beautiful even by his standards: \u201cTreat people with decency.\u201d       12.26pm    Hello, Billy Buzzkill back again, but what can we do. Football always wins \u2026 which is exactly what the bad people are relying on, so.   Updated at 12.27pm GMT    12.22pm    As Jimmy Cricket once said, \u201cAnd there\u2019s more\u2026\u201d      12.20pm    \u201cBrazil fans are rejoicing at the humiliation of their arch rival Argentina,\u201d emails Tom Phillips, our Latin America correspondent. \u201cAs the final whistle went in Qatar on Tuesday, Brazilians shared the following tearful version of Argentina\u2019s flag on social media.\u201d Oh man, this is exactly it: you simply cannot beat football.       12.18pm    And I guess we also need to remove ourselves from the moment for a second to note that some things are more important than football; to make sure we\u2019re not narcotised by amazing, uplifting, affirming football into forgetting all of what\u2019s going on around it. I\u2019m sorry, I hate to do it, but I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s my job and all of our social, moral responsibility.      12.16pm    I guess we need to remove ourselves from the moment for a second, to note that Argentina still have a decent chance of escaping the group, so still have a chance of winning the thing \u2013 in 1990, they lost their first game to Cameroon and still made the final. But they\u2019ll need to play a lot better than today, with more intensity, aggression and intelligence \u2013 I\u2019m not surprised they lost from 2-1 down, I am surprised by how little they created following their second concession.   Updated at 12.25pm GMT    12.13pm    It\u2019s not even that Saudi won \u2013 well it is \u2013 but to do some from behind is even more astoundingly astonishing. And in a sense they beat Argentina at their own game, two brilliant goals backed up with every possible kind of physical intervention, every possible kind of law-manipulation, and the mental fortitude of the Gods.   Updated at 12.34pm GMT    12.11pm    The Saudi players run to their end in the most ecstatic glee anyone in the world has ever experienced, while on Argentinian faces we see a mixture of confusion, dismay and humiliation. Saudi were tremendous in every aspect; Argentina were wan, and when they needed to step it up, they looked in the larder and found nothing.   Updated at 12.13pm GMT    12.09pm    USA 1950, North Korea 1966, Cameroon 1990, Senegal 2002 \u2026 AND SAUDI ARABIA 2022! Football is unmatched, unrivalled, undefeated, and the greatest thing on the face of the earth!    Updated at 12.52pm GMT    12.08pm   FULL-TIME: Argentina 1-2 Saudi Arabia  OH MY ABSOLUTE COMPLETE AND UTTER EVERLASTING DAYS!   Updated at 12.10pm GMT    12.07pm    90+13 min Lisandro puts a ball into the box but it\u2019s scuffed and Saudi clear yet again! This is desperate, unreal, exhausting, mystifying stuff! This is World Cup football!      12.06pm    90+13 min There can\u2019t be long left now. Hang onto your souls, people!      12.06pm    90+11 min Messi to D Maria \u2026 whose cross is useless, scuttling behind. Argentina\u2019s first loss in 36 games is imminent, and Saudi have earned the absolute arse out of this. They\u2019ve been brave, tenacious, wild and composed \u2013 it\u2019s been a brilliant effort, and they\u2019re on the verge of one of the great World Cup moments, results and feelings!      12.04pm    90+10 min Argentina win successive corners, both cleared, but the second allows a ball back in and it pick out Alvarez! But he can\u2019t impart requisite power, and Alowais flies across his goal to save comfortably.      12.03pm    90+9 min We go again, Alsharani giving thumbs-up from his stretcher.   Updated at 12.05pm GMT    12.02pm    90+8 min Alsharani still receives treatment and is now on a stretcher being carried off. on the touchline, Alburayk prepares to replace him for what I guess will be enough four or five minutes.  Updated at 12.03pm GMT    12.01pm    90+6 min Alsharani is conscious, I think, while, sat in his six-yard box, Alowais decompresses. He looked upset by what happened but is composed now, complaining of knee-knack.   Updated at 12.08pm GMT    12.00pm    90+5 min Alowais charges way out of his goal to punch clear and oh my days, he absolutely annihilates Alsharani, kneeing him full in the phizog with the full force of the moment. The ref, though allows play to proceed before the ball goes dead; godspeed, old mate.   Updated at 12.44pm GMT    11.58am    90+4 min Saudi win a corner down the right and try to keep the ball down there, but soon give away a free-kick. Argentina haven\u2019t looked like scoring really, and that\u2019s testament to how well Saudi have defended and also disappeared time. They\u2019ve made these last 20 a real mess.      11.57am    90+2 min When the ball\u2019s cleared, Di Maria curls back in, Otamendi goes up with the keeper and does enough to disturb him, enabling Alvarez to thrash goalwards \u2026 but on the line, Al-Amri heads clear brilliantly, Alowais is booked for protesting Otamendi\u2019s challenge, and Saudi still have their lead! My word!     11.55am    90+1 min There\u2019ll be eight added minutes and Messi\u2019s poor free-kick achieves nothing, then another monstrous challenge from Altambakti robs Alvarez and hands Argentina another corner. He celebrates like he\u2019s scored again, and what a match he\u2019s had!   Updated at 11.59am GMT    11.54am    90 min Di Maria weaves at the Ssaudi defence and Asiri welcomes himself to the game by administering the trip. Free-kick Argentina, 25 yards out, level with the left edge of the box\u2026     11.53am    88 min Alabid, the first-half sub, is subbed, with the ref chasing him to the touchline to award a yellow card; Asiri replaces him, while Haitham is on for Albrikan.  Updated at 11.53am GMT    11.51am    87 min Di Maria again goes down the right, picks out Lautaro, and again, Altambakti, my man of the match, makes a fine challenge.      11.51am    87 min Er, there\u2019s another game kicking off in 70 minutes\u2019 time.      11.50am    86 min I can\u2019t help but think the removal of Paredes harmed Argentina. He was helping them set their tempo, and the game\u2019s got a bit messier since he departed; weight of numbers should override structure only at the very end.      11.48am    84 min Argentina haven\u2019t lost a World cup game in which they\u2019ve scored first since West Germany beat them 3-1 in 1958, but excuse me while I interrupt myself! Di Maria picks out Big Leo Messi at the back stick, he\u2019s up early \u2026 too early, I think, and can\u2019t impart any power on his header aimed for the far corner, so again, Alowais collects. Since going behind, Argentina have created almost nothing.  Updated at 11.48am GMT    11.46am    83 min Acuna bursts down the left and crosses, but no one hits the near post so Alowais collects under nae pressure.      11.46am    82 min Argentina are being Argentinad now, Abdulhamid clattering someone \u2013 Fernandez I think \u2013 and taking a card while stopping momentum.   Updated at 11.51am GMT    11.44am    81 min And Messi lofts high over the bar!    Updated at 12.46pm GMT    11.44am    80 min The Saudi wall isn\u2019t keen to retreat, the tension ratcheting up a few more levels above stratospheric.   Updated at 12.10pm GMT    11.43am    79 min Argentina win a free-kick in Messi Territory after a foul on De Paul and Aldawsari is booked for appealing it\u2019s award. Here he comes, 25 yards out, just left of centre\u2026  Updated at 11.43am GMT    11.42am    78 min Change for Saudi, Alghannam for Alshehri, scorer of their first goal.      11.42am    77 min The ground is bouncing, jumping, and every other cliche we use to describe the greatest communal experience that exists in the world. Argentina have roughly 20minutes to save themselves \u2013 though in a sense, this result would be as bad for Poland and Mexico, both of whom will fancy making the knockouts.   Updated at 12.12pm GMT    11.39am    75 min Albulaihi is booked for timewasting. I daresay his won\u2019t be the last, and it\u2019s interesting that this is a risk he was prepared to take, England, Wales and the rest.      11.39am    74 min Tremendous keeping from Alowais, who\u2019s been great so far. A ball in behind and for a second it looks like Lautaro is in, but the keeper slides out and makes a brilliant, goal-saving challenge. I\u2019ve smoke coming off my fingers, this is wondrous, wonderful stuff.   Updated at 11.48am GMT    11.38am    74 min \u201cNot just third-choice keeper,\u201d says Jerry Spring. \u201cHow about from the kick-off the captain wear the armband, gets booked, passes to another player, gets booked, passes on...back to the captain, gets second yellow and off, onto the next player, etc. No players left on the pitch and it hasn\u2019t even kicked off ... and if all the main teams do that in consecutive games then Fifa won\u2019t have a competition to sell ... let\u2019s see who backs down first.\u201d     11.37am    73 min Fernandez slams a low cross that Alvarez might\u2019ve got had he not been on his heels, then Messi used the outside of his left boot to curve a ball into Di Maria, down the right of the box, but a poor low shot was easily gobbled by Alowais.      11.36am    72 min I wonder, by he way, if Scaloni will get grief for picking Romero, who\u2019d not played for a bit, when he had Lisandro, in great form. He likes the former and with good reason, but he had an alernative.      11.35am    71 min Another change for Argentina, Tagliafico departing and Acuna arriving.      11.34am    70 min \u201cHow about a second penalty spot on the 18-yard line for fouls in the box not deemed a goal scoring opportunity?\u201d asks Charles Howgego. I\u2019d be fine with that; I\u2019m sure there are a few solutions that are better than the status qo.      11.33am    69 min Saudi are sitting deeper now, Messi sliding a ball inside Albrikan for Fernandez \u2026 and the defender does really well to get it behind.      11.31am    67 min Almaki slides into a fifty-fifty with Otamendi, there\u2019s a mincing of limbs, and the Saudi man is booked.      11.31am    66 min Argentina have played much better today than they did in losing their first game of Italia 90 to Cameroon. But they\u2019re paying the price for eagerness \u2013 on reflection, those times they were caught offside in the first half, they had no business being caught offside because the passes were good and there was so much space into which they could run.   Updated at 11.36am GMT    11.29am    65 min Another ball over the top finds Messi, but Altambakti does really well to intercede \u2013 again \u2013 as he looks for Lautaro.      11.28am    64 min Argentina win a corner, someone \u2013 I\u2019m not certain who \u2013 swipes it across the face, and Lisandro knees goalwards form a few yards \u2026 but Alowais does brilliantly to scramble across his line and shovel around the post for a further corner that comes to nowt.      11.27am    62 min Herve Renard is living this match now, right up on the touchline. I wonder, though, about Scaloni\u2019s changes \u2013 I\u2019m not yet sure on Argentina\u2019s shape, but generally I\u2019d say it\u2019s too early to sacrifice that for eight of attacking numbers. Anyhow, Di Maria swerves over a fine cross that Lautaro is slightly longer spikes away from glancing home.   Updated at 11.54am GMT    11.25am    61 min Saudi are still persevering with that high line and amazingly, in co-comms, Lee Dixon is dubious rather than envious. \u201cLino!\u201d     11.24am    61 min Back to the armband thing for a second, a bit of creativity and the problem is easily solved. Bring on your third keeper at the end, make him captain, he gets booked, whatevz.     11.24am    60 min It\u2019s a long time since I\u2019ve experienced as wild a 10 minutes as that. Football!      11.23am    59 min Ch ch ch changes, Lisandro Martinez, Alvarez and Fernandez replacing Romero, Gomez and Paredes. Argentina are going for it.  Updated at 11.23am GMT    11.22am    56 min Immediately, Messi skates forward, but have a look! Altambakti slides in and executes a sensational sliding challenge inside the box, celebrating like he\u2019s just scored. We could be witnessing something historic here \u2013 dig in mates, this is real, the intensity and extremes that real life can\u2019t give us right here in our faces.      11.20am    54 min Phew! This is why the worst people around want a piece of football. There is nothing, nothing like it.    Updated at 1.02pm GMT    11.19am   GOAL! Argentina 1-2 Saudi Arabia (Aldawsari 53)  GOAL GOAL GOAL GOAL! Aldawsari pinches a yard, dipping infield off the left, and unfurls a gloooooorious curler that Martinez can only palm into the top corner. THAT IS ONE OF THE GREAT WOLRD CUP MOMENTS! THE GROUND IS IN DISBELIEF, A NATION GOES WILD! CAN SAUDI HANG ON?     Updated at 12.57pm GMT    11.17am    53 min Saudi are on it! Abdulhamid finds Alabid down the right, who tries a curler from the right \u2013 it looks goalbound but it\u2019s heading clear. Saudi, though, maintain the pressure\u2026.     11.16am    51 min This is now also a good test for Argentina, who have to regain composure and try and prise apart a well-drilled side on a buzz.      11.15am    49 min There is a row in the ground! These next 41+543 minutes are going to be intense!     11.13am   GOAL! Argentina 1-1 Saudi Arabia (Alshehri 48)  GOODNESS ME! Saudi win it in midfield, a long ball sends Alshehri in, his first touch is excellent and he\u2019s got the legs to escape Romero, who\u2019s not played in a minute. At speed, he deftly guides a finish into the ground, through the defender\u2019s legs, and past Martinez right into the corner, racing over to the Saudi fans and getting to his knees in prayer! What a moment!     Updated at 11.33am GMT    11.11am    46 min \u201cI think this short video of Nicky Bandini commenting on how the teams who were going to wear One Love armbands backed down is worth putting on the liveblog,\u201d returns K\u00e1ri Tulinius. \u201cI honestly thought that I had become too jaded to be surprised by the cravenness of footballers and football authorities towards authoritarians, but even I\u2019ve been shocked how little it took, a yellow card.\u201d  Yes, I agree. \u201cIt\u2019s important to stand up for injustice.\u201d \u201cHow important?\u201d \u201cA bit less important than getting a yellow card.\u201d     11.09am    46 min We go again.      11.08am    Bubbling testosterone in the studio: Roy Keane doesn\u2019t think it was penalty and Graeme Souness thinks it doesn\u2019t matter what Roy Keane thinks because the refs have been told to give them for those kinds of things. \u201cI\u2019m here to give my opinion,\u201d says Roy, many times; \u201cGive someone else a chance to speak, you might learn something,\u201d says Graeme; \u201cSnigger,\u201dsays Joe Cole.   Updated at 11.12am GMT    11.02am         11.02am    Eyeball:sweat interface.       11.01am    DO IT, DO IT, DO IT!       11.01am    Half-time emails: \u201cThe first thought when a corner is given is now \u2018ooh, might get a cheap penalty here\u2019 rather than \u2018might score an actual goal here\u2019,\u201d says Tom Hopkins. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how to change that without putting the VAR genie back in its box, but it doesn\u2019t seem like an ideal state of affairs?\u201d On the other hand, David Sweet disagrees with me saying \u201cI think I preferred it when refs could turn a blind eye because I don\u2019t think that kind of thing should result in an almost definite goal,\u201d replaying as follows: \u201cBut a foul is a foul and I think 99 fans out of 100 would prefer that \u2018tussles\u2019 did not happen - NO use of hands/arms on an opponent: ever. That would be in the spirit and laws of the game from the start.\u201d I\u2019m not sure. David, I like the physical aspect of the game, so would always err on the side of preservation; Tom, I\u2019d have binned VAR before it came in because of how it compromises goal celebrations, the greatest feeling known to mankind, but I\u2019d always thought that penalties are too harsh a punishment for many of the offences for which they\u2019re given and this has intensified that.        10.54am   HALF-TIME: Argentina 1-0 Saudi Arabia  That was a pretty enjoyable half of football, and not just because it\u2019s 10.52am UK time nor because we\u2019re all hopeless marks totally narcotised by the majesty of football. Argentina played some nice stuff, Saudi were enterprising too, and we\u2019ve still got 315 minutes, (plus 692 of added time) awaiting us today.      10.51am    45+3 min Ach, I was wrong about Alfaraj. The Saudi captain departs grimacing and on the verge of tears, poor bloke \u2013 he must be hurt if he can\u2019t last until the break \u2013 and Alabid replaces him.   Updated at 10.55am GMT    10.49am    45+1 min We\u2019ll have five added minutes, and I\u2019m going to sound like a total clown saying this, but the timekeeping is probably my favourite aspect of this competition so far \u2013 though I yesterday also enjoyed Christian Pulisic telling the ref to \u201crelax\u201d and Jude Bellingham calling Luke Shaw \u201cShawy\u201d, in flagrant abuse of football\u2019s nickname rules.  Updated at 10.50am GMT    10.48am    45 min Paredes snaps a lovely ball out to Molina, disguising his intention to find his mate in space. But with men in the box at which to aim, instead he clips backwards and Saudi counter before running into traffic.      10.46am    44 min Aldawasari skips between two challenges like someone nipping onto the Tube as the doors close, then falls as Molina closes in to challenge; there\u2019s a minor call for a penalty, but it\u2019s not actually close.      10.45am    42 min Messi swings out towards Paredes and the ball\u2019s cleared towards De Paul, advancing to the edge. He\u2019s got time and space \u2013 lots of both \u2013 so back goes the head and up goes the shot, sailing way over the bar.      10.43am    40 min But as I type that, a ball over the top finds him down the side of the box, only for a poor touch to allow the defender in. Corner to Argentina, which yields a free-kick in a better position when Almaki clatters Gomez for no benefit other than the sheer pleasure of inflicting pain      10.42am    39 min \u201cWhen I sat down to watch this match,\u201d emails K\u00e1ri Tulinius, \u201cI was suddenly struck by the melancholy thought that I\u2019ll probably only see Messi play two or three dozen times again before he retires. I can remember him as a long-haired scamp tearing through defenses in dour era of football, like a Prometheus stealing joy from the football gods and bringing it to humanity. How lucky to have witnessed it.\u201d Yes, his and Ronaldo\u2019s consistency is unlike anything we\u2019ve ever seen before. For years, I wasn\u2019t sure of who he reminded me, but I got there in the end.       10.40am    38 min Alfaraj, the Saudi captain, is down with some kind of shin situation. He\u2019s being sprayed, which suggests it\u2019s impact rather than muscular and that he\u2019s going to be fine.      10.39am    37 min Have Saudi got George Graham in as defensive coach? Their offside trap has been superb so far.      10.38am    36 min I cringe when I write this, but when I was at university, Nicolas Anelka scored a goal like that for Madrid, so I tried it in a game and scored \u2026 but twisted my ankle.      10.37am    35 min Oh man, again Lautaro gets in one-on-one, this time he steps over to commit the keeper before rolling in, and again the flag goes up.   Updated at 10.51am GMT    10.36am    33 min \u201cDearest Daniel,\u201d begins my latest email \u2013 which long-time readers will know means MBM and OBO legend, Mac Millings. \u201cThe idea that the refs got told to give those kinds of penalties after the Maguire incident makes sense, but only in a world where we trust Fifa to learn from their mistakes.\u201d I\u2019m trying to work out which tune to sing this to, or which rhyme-scheme I\u2019m missing, but one thing on that: it seems like, despite the ludicrousness of this competition, that during it, football has finally decided to take timekeeping seriously. I\u2019d still love to see the working for the added time we\u2019ve been getting, and the clock displayed for all to see, but being dreadful at important tuff doesn\u2019t necessarily preclude competence at the peripheral stuff. Maybe.      10.33am    32 min The ball comes in, and Martinez collects.      10.33am    30 min \u2026they send men up; watch for the counter if this goes wrong, but Argentina clear at the near post, then Saudi, who sustain the attack, find Kanno down the left, so De Paul crunches him. Another chance to put a ball into the box, prior to which Otamendi and Albulaihi shove each other.      10.31am    30 min Saudi win a corner down the right\u2026     10.31am   GOAL DISALLOWED FOR OFFSIDE!  We\u2019ve not seen the replay, but a fair while after Martinez celebrated inking his name into the annals of humanity, his goal was confiscated.   Updated at 10.34am GMT    10.30am   GOAL! Argentina 2-0 Saudi Arabia (Martinez 28)  And there it is. That high line is punished again, a straight pass from De Paul into the chasm behind the Saudi defence, Alowais comes out, and Martinez has a cup of mat\u00e9 then lifts over his dive. Lovely finish.   Updated at 10.33am GMT    10.28am    26 min \u201cA question regarding your proposed rule changes for penalties,\u201d emails Ben Roylance. \u201cWould you have awarded a penalty to Wales yesterday when Bale was fouled near the halfway line?\u201d I\u2019d need another look, but I don\u2019t think so, because the chances of him hitting a lob from there that went in were less likely than him not doing so. But I\u2019d prefer to see one given for that than for the foul on Paredes.      10.26am    24 min \u201cWho\u2019s to say that the ball being played into the box, from a free kick or corner, wasn\u2019t aimed for the man being fouled?\u201d asks Sam Naden. \u201cAs such, I think a penalty should be given rather than a direct free kick.\u201d I\u2019m happy for the ref to decide based on the flight of the ball and position of the player fouled.      10.25am    22 min Eeesh, there\u2019s that space in behind again, a ball over the top \u2013 from Gomez I think \u2013 puts Messi in! This time, he doesn\u2019t bottle it \u2013(that\u2019s a joke, @MessiSZN) \u2013 opening body to roll home. But the flag goes up and he was indeed offside, though not by much. I daresay he\u2019ll score from a situation such as this before the morning/afternoon/evening/night is out.   Updated at 10.28am GMT    10.23am    21 min Argentina get it wide to Gomez, who has a look then thrashes a shot miles over and somewhere towards Selhurst Park.      10.22am    20 min \u201cSure, money is the blocker now,\u201d returns Dom Jones on the topic of an equatorial African World Cup. \u201cOne hopes that won\u2019t always be the case. I assume a competition in that part of the world would be played in winter, same as Afcon. I guess it\u2019s less about temperature and more about rain.\u201d Yes, which I think depends \u2013 not everywhere round that way is hit too hard by the wt stuff such that a June/July edition would be impossible, I don\u2019t think.       10.20am    18 min Now Argentina counter and Messi turns a lovely ball over the top for Martinez \u2026 who\u2019s gone way too early. Still, the space in behind will have been lost on neither of them.      10.20am    18 min Argentina give it away in midfield and Aldawsari collects. He can\u2019t pick a pass, but Saudi are also committing men forward, and this is brewing into a really enjoyable game.      10.18am    16 min Alshehri clatters into Tagliafico, who doesn\u2019t like it, but it fine. Saudi, by the way, have been better these last few minutes, a nice interchange down the right allowing Abdulhamid to cross from the right; Martinez dives to collect.      10.17am    15 min Whatever one\u2019s thoughts about the penalty, though, credit to Argentina for not mucking about. Men forward, well-spaced \u2013 and a big chance followed by a goal inside 10 minutes.      10.16am    13 min \u201cThe quote from Paredes on Messi,\u201d tweets Avik, \u201creminded me of this from Yuvraj: \u2018The whole team wanted to win the World Cup so badly, especially for Sachin because we knew it was his last World Cup.\u2019\u201d The reverence of brilliant for genius is a beautiful thing.  Updated at 10.16am GMT    10.14am    11 min I wonder if that goal came about because the refs were told about not letting fouls of that ilk go, following the yank on Harrance Maguire yesterday. It\u2019s a real problem, I think, with the game, because of how hard it is to defend corners without getting physical. I think I preferred it when refs could turn a blind eye because I don\u2019t think that kind of thing should result in an almost definite goal, which brings me back to the point I always make: any denial of a goalscoring opportunity, anywhere on the pitch, should be a penalty; any foul in the box that does not deny a goalscoring opportunity should be a direct free-kick.      10.12am   GOAL! Argentina 1-0 Saudi Arabia (Messi pen 10)  Messi pigeon steps then hops, the keeper commits early and goes down right, so Messi rolls left and that\u2019s the start Argentina wanted!    Updated at 10.37am GMT    10.10am   PENALTY TO ARGENTINA!  9 min Yes, that\u2019s a penalty; I wonder who\u2019ll take it?!   Updated at 10.13am GMT    10.10am    8 min Messi looks for De Paul on the edge, he shoots into a defender, and then the ref goes to consult VAR because Abdulhamid might\u2019ve hauled down Paredes!   Updated at 10.43am GMT    10.08am    7 min There\u2019s shoving inside the box before the ball is headed a decent distance away \u2026 though it comes straight back, and a foul on De Paul means Messi will now swerve in a cross with a better angle so to do.      10.08am    6 min Argentina win a corner down the left; Messi will take\u2026     10.07am    5 min \u201cTo those objecting to the schedule,\u201d says Dom Jones, \u201care you ruling out the possibility of the World Cup ever being held in equatorial Africa? Seems a shame.\u201d The difficulty of those countries hosting sadly begins with money \u2013 though would it not be hotter there this time of year than in June and July? That\u2019s certainly the case in Ghana, which is my experience of that part of the world.      10.06am    3 min That move did, though, give us a decent insight into how Argentina are going to play: loads of men up, with one on each touchline.      10.05am    2 min And they\u2019ve got six players up front when a big switch finds Di Maria keeping the width down the right. He pokes infield to Martinez, the ball runs loose \u2026 and onto the left peg of the onrushing Messi! He should score, the route opening for him to bend inside the far corner, but he shoots too near to Alowais, who dives to shove away! What a start that should\u2019ve been!     10.03am    1 min Argentina knock it about with all the swagger of a side not beaten in 36 games, with Saudi engaging when they reach the centre-circle.      10.02am    1 min Away we go! Late, with the countdown missed; I don\u2019t know what to think anymore!   Updated at 10.07am GMT    9.59am    Saudi have more fans here than anyone else and they give it loads, right as the coverage cuts out. But it returns in time for the ads, after which we\u2019ll have the first of today\u2019s four matches.      9.57am    By the way, if you didn\u2019t see Wales\u2019 last evening, here it is. If you did see Wales\u2019 last evening, here it is. NSFW warning: your eyeballs may sweat.       9.56am    Anthem time.      9.55am    The flamethrowers are active and the PA is booming. It can only mean one thing: World Cup football! Here come our teams!   Updated at 9.59am GMT    9.53am      We just want to play football. I would have loved to play with that band, but not at the expense of a yellow card\u201d.      9.51am    More important than the football, which of these two has the best scran? Argentina\u2019s asado v Saudi\u2019s kabsa feels like a local derby of food.      9.50am    And Argentina gen here:      9.47am    Saudi gen here:      9.44am    On which point, what\u2019s the optimal World Cup experience for players returning in shape? Presumably those who don\u2019t go or go and don\u2019t play won\u2019t be match-fit; those who go out in the groups and last 16 will also have too much time off; and those who depart the semis and final will have played too many emotionally demanding games. So I\u2019m going for a quarter-final exit, which would be good news for teams with lots of English players, etc etc.      9.42am    Keane also said the World Cup has no business being in Qatar, with which it\u2019s hard to argue. Aside from the human rights aspect, I can\u2019t get my head around the footballing aspects: players who\u2019ve slogged their entire lives to earn the right to play, but can\u2019t because they\u2019ve had no time to recover from injuries, and then those who reach the final will have no time to assimilate the greatest and worst moment of their lives, but will instead have to hike back to the European winter and Leeds away, or whatever.      9.37am    Back to the serious stuff, \u201cWe\u2019re talking about common decency \u2013 how you treat people,\u201d says Roy Keane, absolutely nailing how to respond to anyone who uses \u201cwoke\u201d or \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d as an insult. Things can be difficult, different and complex, but compassion, especially for the vulnerable, should be at the centre of everything.      9.34am    Decent player imo.      9.33am    Email! \u201cIrish Saudi fan here in Jeddah,\u201d says Ger Clancy. \u201cThe whole country has just been given a half-day to watch the game and there\u2019s an epic stampede to get home. Thankfully I left even earlier and am eating some dates on my couch watching the build up on ITV bootleg. Watch out for Kanno, Al Shehri and Al Dawsari. Dont know much about the other crowd....!\u201d     9.32am    ITV are running a piece on sportswashing and Saudi, which is harrowing to say the least. I actually wonder if that\u2019s what we\u2019re really seeing, or if their involvement in football is more about ego, money and power. I\u2019d also not seen the clip of Eddie Howe being asked about human rights abuses and responding that he was \u201cbitterly disappointed\u201d about that day\u2019s defeat. It really puts football out of perspective.      9.26am    Something to read while I scrawl the teams onto some paper: what makes the perfect World Cup, and what\u2019s our responsibility when enjoying this one?       9.24am    Wondering about Argentina as potential winners, I wonder if they\u2019ll have the midfield control in the biggest games, and if the better sides might exploit the space behind their full-backs. But here\u2019s one reason to hope they make it, from RDP on his tatts:  A lot of them have a specific meaning: the names of my daughter, wife and mother \u2026 I think I\u2019m going to stop. Unless I become world champion, in which case I\u2019ll get a tattoo of the World Cup on my chest.\u201d      9.22am    This, from Paredes on Messi, was also good:   If we win the World Cup, I\u2019d be happier for him than I would be for myself.\u201d  I love the reverence players have for the best of them \u2013 listening to Stephen Hendry commentate on Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan is one of my favourite joys \u2013 and am reminded that there used to be a tradition in Argentina that you sent your top from your debut to Maradona where it was stored in what was known as \u201cthe room\u201d, containing all his memorabilia. I know this because my best mate has been in it. I am sat in a box room in north London.      9.18am    Talking of Fernandez, I loved this from his Guardian profile:  Former Primeira Liga coach Jose Peseiro told A Bola: \u201cWith his passing and vision he\u2019s a bit like Zidane. Enzo is only 21 years old? Either that\u2019s a lie, or he\u2019s a genius.\u201d    Updated at 9.18am GMT    9.15am    So Lionel Scaloni goes for Otamendi and Romero at centre-back, which tells us how highly he rates them given Martinez is also available. In midfield, he\u2019s got a really interested mix of solidity, with Paredes, general purpose activity in De Paul, and unpredictability in Gomez \u2013 though I wonder if Fernandez might force his way into the reckoning at some point. I hope so, because he is very special. Meanwhile it\u2019s as expected in attack \u2013 though I\u2019d not be surprised to see Julian Alvarez affect this tournament from the bench.      9.04am    I make it six minutes of coverage before ITV started banging on about England.   Updated at 9.26am GMT    9.03am   Our teams!  Argentina (4-3-3): Martinez; Molina, Romero, Otamendi, Tagliafico; De Paul, Paredes, Gomez; Messi, Martinez, Di Maria. Subs: Armani, Rulli, Foyth, Montiel, Pezzella, Acuna, Palacios, Rodriguez, Mac Allister, Fernandez, Alvarez, Correa, Almada, Dybala. Saudi Arabia (4-3-3): Alowais; Abdulhamid, Altambakti, Albulaihi, Alshahrani; Kanno, Almalki, Alfaraj; Albrikan, Alshehri, Aldawsari.

Referee: Slavko Vincic (Slovenia)  Updated at 9.27am GMT    9.00am    Good news for all the preamble writers out there: Lionel Messi starts for Argentina.      8.30am   Preamble  It was once put to Juca Kfouri, the Brazilian football writer, that Zico never won the World Cup. \u201cWell,\u201d he retorted, \u201cthat\u2019s the World Cup\u2019s bad luck\u201d. And in a way, Brazil\u2019s failure to lift the trophy in 1982 \u2013 and 1986 \u2013 actually elevates their standing, cementing them in our hearts because it\u2019s easier to identify with tragic heroes than heroic heroes. Or, put another way, because \u2013 as we always are when we think we\u2019re thinking about someone or something else \u2013 we\u2019re really thinking about ourselves. But it\u2019s also easier to identify with them because they stood for something important: \u201cBeauty comes first, victory is secondary \u2013 what matters is joy,\u201d was how Socrates put it. Which brings us onto Lionel Messi. Our relationship to him is different partly because Argentinian football culture is different to Brazilian football culture, its focus on winning by whatever means necessary. But it\u2019s a personal thing, too \u2013 though Messi is perhaps the greatest player there\u2019s ever been, he\u2019s been so adept at concealing his essence that all we know of him is the genius we see on the pitch, meaning there\u2019s no personal connection. So from our perspective \u2013 there we are again, punkt in the centre of things \u2013 he could do with inspiring a famous win here, so that people he neither knows nor cares for don\u2019t think less of a bloke who\u2019s 487 goals in 559 club games and 91 in 165 at international level; been awarded seven Ballon d\u2019Ors; and won 10 La Liga titles, plus four Champions Leagues. Really, though, it\u2019s nothing to do with us whatsoever: Messi needs to win this for himself, so he ends his career with no regrets. And the good news for him is that he\u2019s got a decent chance: Argentina have a strong defence, solidity and creativity in midfield, and serious firepower up front. The bad news for him is that he might be carrying a knock, but reports suggest he\u2019ll be fine. Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, were good in qualifying but have been less so since. They are, though solid at the back: in 12 games this calendar year they\u2019ve conceded just six times, keeping clean sheets against Australia, USA and Ecuador, limiting Colombia and Croatia to just a single goal, and only letting in more than that once. Here we go! Kick-off: 1pm local, 10am GMT  "

                    "body": "  5.00pm    But yes, it\u2019s hard not to think that, this time next week, we\u2019ll be coming towards the end of an Argentina v France final. Or not! Thanks all for your company and comments \u2013 ta-ra!      4.56pm    We\u2019re getting to the end of this blog now, so let\u2019s throw it forward to the semis. I\u2019d not be shocked to see Croatia pilfer a goal against Argentina, or schlep them to penalties, but I think France will have too much for Morocco because Varane and Upamecano will make it very difficult for Morocco to score. Obviously France v Argentina looks the likely final and that\u2019d be jam-packed with narrative: the holders looking to retain their title v Messi looked to cap his career. But picking winners in this competition feels like a fool\u2019s errand.      4.46pm    Absolutely tremendous \u201cyou know\u201ding here from Luke Shaw. The subtitles are such a great wrinkle.       4.41pm    Back to the WSL, Villa lead third-placed Arsenal 1-0 after 27 minutes; leaders Chelsea then take on Reading in the late game.      4.37pm    \u201cHmm,\u201d begins Scott Blair. \u201cI couldn\u2019t watch the game live as it turned out, but saw the highlights such as they were. Foden hardly got a mention. And when I caught up with the full match, it didn\u2019t seem to be all that different. Everyone (everyone) was raving about him beforehand \u2013 and he\u2019s a fine player \u2013 but was it an off night? Or is he not quite what folk think he is?\u201d The first time I saw Foden it was playing for an age-group side, and I immediately messaged the lads I go Man United with, saying \u201cproblem\u201d. I\u2019ve not seen anything to change my mind since then, much as I wish I had \u2013 he\u2019s a brilliant player and will get even better. His contribution last night, I think, was in his positioning, which helped England get the squeeze on France \u2013 though I\u2019d have taken him off after an hour to try Rashford, who is a brilliant sub and has the ability to make things happen.      4.29pm    \u201cAs a proud Hoosier,\u201d returns Joe Pearson, \u201cI don\u2019t have much of an opinion on Southgate, although I do think Berhalter should get the axe. \u201cOh, and on your recommendation, I have started reading The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle. Does Murakami always write about cats?\u201d This is great news, enjoy! Cats, and also ears.       4.22pm    I agree with David Hytner here too \u2013 and might add that most players pass through an entire career without making an error so cataclysmic. You\u2019ve got to credit Kane for putting himself in harm\u2019s way, but he\u2019ll know better than any of us, he let the situation get to him. If you look at his body-position as he takes the penalty, he\u2019s almost crouching, rather than standing tall, and the head going up and back is a classic sign of nerves. Just ask Michael Platini about his penalty in the 1986 France v Brazil quarter-final shoot-out, or Roberto Baggio and Franco Baresi about the 1994 World Cup final \u2013 players far greater than Kane who buckled under the pressure.       4.13pm    I\u2019ve criticised Southgate a fair bit over the last few years \u2013 he made big errors against Croatia in 2018 and more generally in 2021, when he was, I think, unduly cautious. But Jacob is spot-on here, I think, because he\u2019s made big strides these last few weeks.    Updated at 4.13pm GMT    4.05pm    \u201cThe question here is how do England get better?\u201d asks Shaun Lawson. \u201cThat was the unluckiest defeat I\u2019ve ever seen us experience at a major tournament, and I go back as far as Euro 88. But the thing is: we\u2019ve still not quite resolved the back four/back three debate (it didn\u2019t work in the first half - we were way too deep for the first half-hour or so), the central defence isn\u2019t *quite* good enough, we\u2019re maybe one central midfielder short against the very best, and up front? We are wasting Phil Foden. Completely wasting him.  When you think about it, none of the semi-finalists seem to have any doubts over their tactical setups. We still do, even though we\u2019re clearly improving. And I agree with you fully about the lack of chances created. I think Southgate should\u2019ve brought Rashford on earlier; but the conundrum for me is Foden. He\u2019s exactly the kind of player who, utilised correctly, turns very good sides into tournament-winning ones. But he\u2019s so peripheral so often. I love Southgate to bits and want him to stay - but I\u2019m not sure he knows how to get the best out of players like him? See also, Maddison, whose treatment throughout the tournament was plain weird, and really the only thing I\u2019d really criticise Gareth for. Why he wasn\u2019t brought on against Wales and/or Senegal, I can\u2019t fathom. Historically, England have wasted so many terrific creative players \u2013 Hoddle, Barnes and Scholes spring to mind. The Foden dilemma is heading in the same direction. There must be a way of prioritising both him and Bellingham; not just the latter, surely?\u201d On Maddison, he went because squad-sized was increased from 24 to 26; Southgate had been clear he preferred the former. As for Foden, I thought he was instrumental in England\u2019s improved second-half display, pressing and helping them to win the ball high up the park. I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve always trusted Southgate to get the most of his attackers because he\u2019s never managed a side with riches of this ilk. I do, though, think he\u2019s improving, even if yesterday, I didn\u2019t think his side attacked as cohesively as they should\u2019ve done \u2013 they struggled to create chances and did, I think, often have too few men attacking the box when the ball came into it. Perhaps they need to find an attacking coach with particular expertise in that area.      3.56pm    \u201cThe first rule in football is not to concede,\u201d reckons Krishna Moorthy, \u201cand Morocco are the only team that seems to have understood this. I really want them to win not out of any romantic reasons but for purely football reasons.\u201d  I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s necessarily the first rule \u2013 it\u2019s possible to outscore the opposition \u2013 but I agree that Morocco have defended superbly, with just one (own) goal conceded against Canada. Or, put another way, they\u2019ve shut out Croatia, Belgium, Spain and Portugal, which is a seriously phenomenal performance.      3.50pm    I daresay there\u2019s disappointment in Brazil too.I fancied them both for this competition and 2018 because they looked to me like the most settled side. In 2018, they ran into a near-perfect performance from Belgium\u2019s golden generation, but they\u2019ve no excuses for losing to Croatia.       3.45pm    \u201cI am 46 and I have never, ever seen any other English team play half as good as this England did,\u201d emails Luciano from Brazil. \u201cTo be honest with you guys, England always looked like a bad joke to me in all the previous World Cups I had the chance to watch. I was never able to understand how on earth you guys could hail players like Lampard, Terry, etc, let alone call them a \u201cgolden generation\u201d. BUT this team, oh man, this is a completely different story. These guys can play, they can attack, they like doing it, they are born to it, it is actually great to watch. They could have won yesterday and they kinda deserved to if you ask me. Your coach seems to be OK, much better than all those expensive fools like Capello that you used to hire in the past. Hopefully he can keep it up. I was rooting for England yesterday and I will keep doing so at Euro 2024. I think you guys are centimetres away from having a great time watching Jude, Foden and Saka becoming champions for England.\u201d If this England side had any two of the Golden Generation\u2019s centre-backs \u2013 Terry, Ferdinand, King, Campbell \u2013 or Carragher \u2013 there\u2019s a strong chance they\u2019d have beaten France, and Lampard instead of Henderson would also have given them a better shot. But oI agree, they\u2019re getting there.      3.41pm    \u201cThat cat adoption story may seem like a nice fuzzy happy little footnote,\u201d says Robert Heath, \u201cbut the reality is that it shines a little light on yet another very unsavoury aspect of Qatar. I lived there for three years and as an animal lover I was appalled at the number of abandoned animals everywhere around Doha. These are mostly cats and dogs, and very often the magnificent Saluki breed of hunting dog. It is not just the rights of \u2018lesser\u2019 humans (as they see it) that many Qataris have no respect for. Salukis are bred to work during their hunting trips in the desert (very often involving shooting or capturing endangered falcons), and if they don\u2019t come up to scratch they are unceremoniously dumped.\u201d      3.37pm    \u201cOn the discussion regarding France\u2019s first goal, which is likely to last for three and a bit years/the duration of Pickford\u2019s career,\u201d begins Neil Mackie. \u201cBeing unsighted is fine and understandable but his footwork led to him not being able to explode to his right and get to the shot, well-placed and as quick as it was. You can see Pickford\u2019s right foot makes a couple of movements, both of which seem to bring it closer to his left foot rather than going out to the right and widening his base. This then leads to him being imbalanced and unable to push off and out from that lead leg. I\u2019m part of the goalkeeper\u2019s union and so I\u2019m unsurprised that many people miss this (TV punditry and commentary regarding keeping is woeful) so that leads on to the \u2018hur hur small arms\u2019 takes on several internet disgraces. Just my tuppence worth on that.\u201d Yeah, I wondered about this at the time; just a step to his right when it looks like the ball\u2019s going in that direction, and I think he collapses the leg and saves it.      3.35pm    \u201cGreat\u201d is strong, I\u2019d say, but I agree with the sentiment that progress has been made.       3.30pm    I enjoyed this.       3.28pm         3.24pm    But is it just me who calls him Tony Rocky Horror?       3.23pm    Griezmann has had a good tournament so far, it\u2019s true.       3.19pm    \u201cI have to say I don\u2019t agree with you at all regarding the vilification of some members of the Argentina team,\u201d says Joe Sampson. \u201cFor your first reaction to a moment of pure joy to be to revel in the desolation of your vanquished opponent shows a real lack of humanity. I found it really unpleasant, to be honest.\u201d There\u2019s no humanity in schadenfreude? I couldn\u2019t agree less. But also, had the Holland players acted with dignity and class through the shoot-out, fair enough, but they didn\u2019t, and I\u2019m not remotely surprised that when Argentina went through, they reminded their opponents of their behaviour through the previous 10 minutes. While they were perpetrating it, the Netherlands will have known how things would go were they to lose, they just took the chance that they wouldn\u2019t.  Updated at 3.22pm GMT    3.13pm    And here\u2019s Suzy Wrack\u2019s match report.       3.11pm    Honours even in the WSL Manchester derby\u2026      3.09pm    Hi again and thanks Michael.      3.05pm    Going to hand back to Daniel Harris now. Enjoy the rest of your day.      3.02pm    HE\u2019S COMING HOME, etc.       2.56pm    The Golden Boot is looking like a straight shootout between Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 (5), Olivier Giroud (4) and Lionel Messi (4). There are no other players left in the tournament that have more than two goals, so seems very unlikely that the winner will not be someone in that trio. For a deep dive on this subject, check our very snazzy interactive.       2.43pm    \u201cI know it\u2019s not over yet, but how do you think this World Cup might influence club football? I\u2019ve not noticed any significant new tactical ideas, though perhaps we might see a bit more imagination on free kicks after what was possibly to moment of the tournament by the Dutch. Other than that, I wonder if it will embolden referees to add a more realistic amount of time for stoppages in regular games.\u201d I think the last point is a good one. Ten minutes of stoppage time has not been unusual in this World Cup, so it would be now odd to return to the Premier League and see just a couple of minutes added on for the Boxing Day fixtures back here in the UK. Not many can complain about more time being added and if it\u2019s good enough for the World Cup, it\u2019s good enough for Brentford v Tottenham.  In terms of tactical ideas, it\u2019s not a new one but I think we can all agree that the Dutch proved that Total Football is dead. Long live Route One. Get it launched!      2.30pm    Thought Henderson really grew into the game against France. Gave the ball away cheaply a few times in the first half but gave France a real problem with his positioning, often moonlighting as a second right winger. It meant Walker could stay back and keep Mbapp\u00e9 quiet, and gave support/options to Saka, helping him to be England\u2019s best player on the night. Southgate deserves as much credit as Henderson for that tactical tweak, in my book. And this is not exactly a surprise, but Henderson\u2019s stamina was relentless. Geezer was tearing about like a madman before he was hooked in the closing stages.  There was also this moment, in the tunnel before kick-off, which presumably means Mbapp\u00e9 is definitely not going to Liverpool now.   No doubt it had Gary Neville purring in the studio. We all remember his moment.       2.11pm    Hello everyone. How are we feeling? The canteen at Guardian HQ is serving Christmas dinners today. Multiple pigs in blankets are making me feel: a) more philosophical about England\u2019s defeat b) full     2.03pm    Righto, I\u2019m away for a breather; here\u2019s Michael Butler to coax youse through the next hour.  Updated at 2.05pm GMT    2.00pm    \u201cSouthgate might be a lovely bloke with great man-management skills but it takes more than that to win a World Cup,\u201d says Oliver Forrest. \u201cI don\u2019t recall many players talking up Deschamps\u2019 personal skills but he knows how to make the right calls to win tournaments. Southgate inexplicably substituted our best player (Saka) for one of our most out of form players (Sterling), took off our best midfielder (Henderson) and gave France the initiative by sitting deep throughout the first half. We did play well in some ways but we should do, on paper we\u2019re a top side and a quarter-final is the minimum these players should achieve. To go from a good team to a cup-winning team, the margins are very fine, and unfortunately the difference last night was the manager.\u201d I can\u2019t agree with that; the difference was Kane banging a penalty over the bar. I\u2019m also dubious that Deschamps compares favourably to Southgate \u2013 his team are good in spite of him, and with the talent they have and have had, they should be much better than they are.  Updated at 3.20pm GMT    1.58pm    I cannot get enough of this. There aren\u2019t many good things to be said for a Qatar World Cup, but I daresay the ease of travel for the Moroccan players\u2019 mums is one of them.      1.53pm    Terrible news from Qatar came overnight on Friday/Saturday.      1.50pm    Back at the Etihad, Laura Coombs has equalised for City in the Manchester derby. United had looked in control, but with just under an hour gone, there\u2019s scope for pretty much anything to happen in the time that\u2019s left.       1.48pm    I wonder how the England players will be when the domestic games get under way again. Luke Shaw and Harry Maguire in particular seemed to have trouble readjusting after the Euros, and what I hear coming out of the squad is they really, really believed they were going to do something special. Normally, they get to go on holiday and assimilate the disappointment into their psyches, but this time they\u2019re coming back to an English winter to go again immediately \u2013 the League Cup quarters get going a week Tuesday. At least the German players have had a couple of weeks to accept their failure.      1.43pm    \u201cYou could say it was a Maguire error for their goal,\u201d says Francis Mead, \u201cbut I think this was a case of a superb cross that was extremely hard to defend against. I haven\u2019t watched it again, but I think there was a bit more misfortune with it since I think it deflected off Maguire in a different direction \u2013 it might have been saved without him \u2013but that\u2019s a distraction. The game was clearly partly lost since Kane missed the penalty. I think also you are far too harsh on Pickford for the first goal \u2013 he couldn\u2019t dive earlier as the ball came through Bellingham\u2019s legs \u2013 and it was a slightly freakish long-shot that was unsaveable. It was an even game in which England had a slight superiority in chances, but France had Griezemann who provided the key cross. We are a different England team, much better than almost any team we\u2019ve had before \u2013 you can\u2019t legislate for a loss on very fine margins in a knockout tournament. If the World Cup was a league played every year, I\u2019d give us a chance of winning that league \u2013 alas it\u2019s not. I agree, it was a good cross, but this was the last eight of the World Cup so excellent crosses are expected; it remains Maguire\u2019s job to track his man and he didn\u2019t. On Pickford, I felt he should\u2019ve gambled because we could see where the ball was going, and it flicks Bellingham and goes somewhere else, fair enough. But I agree it was a very fine hit.      1.39pm    Oh, Harry. I can\u2019t say I agree that a late penalty smashed over the bar constitutes a \u201csmall detail,\u201d but he seems like a very sound citizen and though England aren\u2019t my team, I\u2019d enjoy him finding redemption because I fear this is one he\u2019ll never quite get over unless he does.       1.35pm    \u201cSome of the comments I\u2019ve read are crazy,\u201d says Finlay Fletcher. \u201cWhat more realistically could we have done last night? Saka had a half-chance, Kane misses a crucial penalty. We went toe-to-toe with the world champions and their experience and management of the key moments was the difference. Some people seem to forget that there is another team trying to win as well, who happens to posses some of the best players around.\u201d Southgate was clear pre-match that prior to the France game, England knew that if they played well, they\u2019d win, but also knew they could play well against France and still lose. This tournament felt like a big step forward from the Euros \u201cfor me\u201d and what has to happen next is that England need to find a way of translating territorial control into chances created.      1.28pm    \u201cSometimes it\u2019s pretty difficult to understand the European moral double-standard,\u201d reckons Axel Gonzalez Bruenner. \u201cIf Netherlands\u2019 players are bringing [redacted]housery it\u2019s because they\u2019re a confident and smart team. If Argentina\u2019s players do some of that then they\u2019re a bunch of classless, idiotic, and whatever-you-want-to-say guys. Let\u2019s remember that the Copa Am\u00e9rica final between Brazil and Argentina was played at the Maracan\u00e1 stadium, and nothing happened there, everybody started giving hugs to each other at the end. So, what\u2019s the narrative behind all these awful things you read out there about the Argentinian team? Are the Dutch free of guilt about being the instigators?\u201d I\u2019ve not read that stuff, though I\u2019d not be surprised if it existed. For mine, I enjoy any needle brought by any team, and the Dutch wrote cheques their penalties couldn\u2019t cash.      1.25pm    Here\u2019s today\u2019s World Cup briefing.       1.20pm    \u201cEngland should include players who are comfortable on the ball, such as Grealish,\u201d says Stefan Grima. \u201cIt\u2019s a more \u2018continental\u2019 style of football, allowing them more possession.\u201d I don\u2019t think possession was England\u2019s problem, and I\u2019m not sure who Grealish plays instead of. England are at their best when playing quickly, and he slows things down \u2013 plus Pep Guardiola tends not to pick him for the biggest games, and I\u2019d pay close attention to what he thinks.      1.15pm    \u201cI think Southgate and Santos made the exact same mistake in their quarter-finals yesterday,\u201d says K\u00e1ri Tulinius. \u201cBoth decided to go with the team that did so well in the round of 16, Southgate not changing a single player, and Santos taking Carvalho out for Neves. But France and Morocco offered very different problems to Senegal and Switzerland. Southgate bet that his forwards could outscore Deschamps\u2019, but that seemed a bet he was likely to lose. And Ronaldo was much better suited to leading the line against Morocco than Ramos. That said, if Kane scores that second penalty, and Fernandes\u2019 Van Basten impression comes off, it might\u2019ve been a different story. Fine margins, and all that.\u201d Well yes \u2013I thought Southgate was in good shape to pick what he thought was his best team and take France on \u2013 and the evidence showed he was right, the execution was just off at crucial moments. Ronaldo just isn\u2019t good anymore, so leaving him out made perfect sense to me; \u2018m not sure if he starts, we see a different game because his finishing is now unreliable.      1.09pm    On which point, is Varane the dishiest centre-back ever to be that good in the air? How on earth does he even manage it?      1.08pm    \u201cThe key thing for me for last night was that England, without playing outstandingly, at least matched the best team in the World,\u201d writes Victor Rushden. \u201cIn previous World Cups (such as the 1990 SF), in such games you felt England needed to play outstandingly, the opposition have an off-day, and England would need a bit of fortune to win. As England are getting better, it feels a matter of time.\u201d Part of me wonders if this was their biggest chance, just because by the next World Cup they might need to have found a new centre-forward \u2013 though I guess Kane never had much gas so perhaps he won\u2019t drop off. They could, though use a better pair of centre-backs than the two they\u2019ve got, and I\u2019m not sure I see any obvious candidates coming through. Ultimately, France\u2019s winner came because Maguire made an error while, at the other end, Upamecano and Varane didn\u2019t make that kind of error.  Updated at 1.18pm GMT    1.00pm    Leah Galton has put United ahead at City in the WSL Manchester derby \u2013 and it\u2019s a really nice goal too.      12.58pm         12.52pm    \u201cThank you for the World Cup coverage, you\u2019re all doing fantastic work at the Guardian!\u201d says Santiago. \u201cI just wanted to point out, since the Argentinian team has been vilified to no end for their less-than-gracious celebration after defeating Netherlands, to this bird\u2019s eye view of Lautaro Martinez\u2019s penalty. As you\u2019ll see, as Lautaro walks towards the penalty spot, four Dutch players surround him and leave the designated area (rule 3 of penalty shoot-outs determines all players except goalies and kicker must stay in the centre circle), presumably to intimidate him \u2013 and apparently that was the case throughout the shoot out. Of course, this doesn\u2019t necessarily justify the behaviour of the Argentinian players (when they go low we go high, etc.), but might help understand it \u2013 especially after such a tense game, which included what might be the worst refereeing in this tournament, between two teams who\u2019ve always enjoyed provoking each other (Van der Saar insulting Ortega\u2019s mum and Ortega headbutting him in \u201898 comes to mind).\u201d   No vilification here. That entire farrago was an absolute joy; as Ricky Hatton used to say of boxing, it\u2019s not a tickling contest, and the more needle and edge, the better. Netherlands did what they did to try and get an advantage, didn\u2019t, and I\u2019d be staggered if they thought Argentinas retaliation at the moment of victory was not one they\u2019d more than earned.      12.48pm    \u201cIt pains me as a Welshman to say this,\u201d emails Huw Swanborough, \u201cbut I think it\u2019s beyond unfair to say that England underperformed or were outclassed last night. I do think the defending wasn\u2019t good enough on Giroud\u2019s goal, but Tchoumeni\u2019s was just one of those goals that you can\u2019t keep out.nEngland created the same quality and quantity of non-penalty chances I think, and played well overall, particularly limiting Mbapp\u00e9 and restricting the French game to counter-attacks even before they took the lead. Non-penalty finishing could have been better, but Lloris also made some good stops, and there were 2-4 occasions where the ball was bouncing without any control between players in the French box that would have been tap-ins on another day. You make your own luck, sure \u2026 but even without Kane\u2019s penalty miss, it was a fine margins defeat.\u201d I\u2019m still not sure about the Tchouameni goal. It was a tremendous hit, sure, but it felt like it was obvious where it was going to go even as he was hitting it, but Pickford didn\u2019t dive until the ball was past the last line of defenders. Had he backed himself and gone early, I think he\u2019d have saved it.      12.43pm    \u201cI just wanted to react about the Argentina v Netherlands game,\u201d says Alexandre. \u201cI think it will be remembered as a classic. I agree that for 80 minutes it was not great, with Argentina totally in control and the Netherlands utterly clueless and impotent in attack. But these last 20 (with the added time) minutes were too great, and the extra time was also decent enough (where\u2019s the \u2018extra time is useless\u2019 crowd after these QFs?), before a great penalty shootout. With time we\u2019ll forget the not great parts and focus on this drama. So it\u2019ll be a classic. Also wanted to quickly weigh in about Southgate. As a Frenchman I was extremely surprised by how good England was last night. I didn\u2019t expect them to be this good. Sure, Southgate has his limitations (taking off Saka? Underusing the bench which was an area where England had a clear edge over France?). But I think what he brings to England in terms of building a team is underrated. To have a better coach you need to find an equally good team builder who\u2019s also great tactically and using his bench - in other words the perfect coach. Good luck with that. Think Southgate will learn and wouldn\u2019t be surprised at all if England were to win the next Euros taking place - guess where ? - in Germany.\u201d Southgate\u2019s role in fostering a compelling, contagious atmosphere should not be underestimated. The players love playing for him and hanging out as a group, and the atmosphere isn\u2019t confined to the squad but has, to an extent, permeated through the country. I didn\u2019t mind him waiting to make changes because England were on top, but as I said below, Sterling for Saka made little sense to me \u2013 though I doubt it was decisive.  Updated at 12.43pm GMT    12.37pm    More live football for you, and it\u2019s a biggie!      12.35pm    ITV have sent out last night\u2019s viewing figures:  England v France watched by 23 million on ITV Biggest audience of 2022 saw England World Cup Quarter-final showdown with France England\u2019s World Cup Quarter Final match was watched by a peak audience of 23 million across ITV and ITVX last night as the Three Lions were narrowly defeated by France. The game drew the biggest audience of the tournament and the highest peak on any channel this year (biggest since the final of last year\u2019s European Championship between England and Italy). It was the most watched programme on television on any channel this year for all viewers (15.1m) and 16-34s (2.5m) ITV had its best Saturday night on record ( ecords go back to 2002). Across all viewing on all devices, an average audience of 20.4 million viewers watched the match - with an average of close to 16 million viewers [15.8m] watching the full live and exclusive coverage. Last night\u2019s England v France match was streamed 15.3m times and Morocco\u2019s win over Portugal, shown live on ITV earlier on Saturday, was streamed 8.2m times. In total there were 30m streams on ITVX yesterday, which is the best ever for the Hub or ITVX.\u201d   Updated at 12.35pm GMT    12.34pm    On the subject of Neves, though, I\u2019ve not a clue why Fernando Santos, right when he\u2019d hit on a formula that worked, brought the Wolves man back into the team when Otavio and William Carvalho looked a decent combination.      12.31pm    A few things I loved at full-time of Morocco v Portugal: Hakim Ziyech just laughing hysterically, unable to believe what was happening; R\u00faben Neves and Roman Sa\u00efss enjoying a hug; and Zakaria Aboukhlal\u2019s teammates whacking him on the head after he missed a one-on-one to finish the game in the tamest fashion imaginable.      12.28pm    I don\u2019t get this. I think Bruno is right, it probably doesn\u2019t make sense to appoint an Argentinian ref for a match the winners of which might play Argentina at some point, and if anyone was going to haul Portugal back into the game, it was him. But his team lost because they played poorly, and the ref was not part of proceedings in the way he was in the Netherlands v Argentina and England v France games.   Updated at 12.45pm GMT    12.24pm         12.23pm    And as for the players celebrating with their mums, oh my days! My eyeballs are sweating watching this again.       12.22pm    We\u2019ve not mentioned Morocco v Portugal yet, so what about that one? Portugal, like England, will know they\u2019ve missed a golden opportunity here. Which is not to denigrate Morocco, not at all \u2013 in Sofyan Amrabat they might just have the player of the tournament, and they\u2019ve defended brilliantly in every game. I\u2019m also enjoying the historical revenge of them beating Spain and Portugal \u2013 with France to come \u2013 and watching them express their cultural and religious imperatives in victory is so affirming.      12.17pm    \u201cPresumably Kane practises penalties against Lloris all through the season,\u201d says Garry Smith. \u201cYou\u2019d want your best penalty taker to practise against your best keeper, and vice versa. They must both, therefore, know the other\u2019s capabilities very well, and also know the approximate chances of Kane scoring.So perhaps, having already scored one, at the second penalty Kane\u2019s mind may well have been churning with all the options, and also reminding him what his chances were of scoring another. In which case, ballooning the ball way over the bar was perhaps no great surprise?\u201d In comms, they said he\u2019d not practised many against Lloris \u2013 which sounded strange. But I guess the emphatic way he despatched the first made one think he\u2019d sort out the second too \u2013 though, if we\u2019re being real, Kane properly bottled one against Denmark in the semis of the Euros, he just got lucky that the ball came back out to him.      12.07pm    Gosh, godspeed old mate.       12.06pm     \u201cGareth has been amazing with myself,\u201d Maguire said.\u201d  I do love a bit of reflexive pronoun abuse.      12.05pm         12.03pm    \u201cI thought J Liew\u2019s article today hit the nail on the head,\u201d returns John Trolan. \u201cThose who have been there before bring a calmness and confidence to the occasion. Giroud looked rubbish for 10 minutes before he hit the winner. Out of position, couldn\u2019t keep up with the pace and I was surprised he was still on the pitch. But then one chance and he doesn\u2019t blink.\u201d I think that\u2019s a little generous. Giroud missed a great chance before he scored, the best of the half, and Tchouameni and Hernandez both gave away penalties unnecessarily. Football is a chaotic game, and last night, that worked for France, but it could just as easily not have done.     11.56am    \u201cArg v Ned was undoubtedly a dull game,\u201d says Brendan Large. \u201cIf you said this was a great game and then showed the first 82 mins to someone they\u2019d think you had lost all grip on reality. The only thing \u2018good\u2019 was the excitement at the end. Even extra time was rubbish.\u201d I referred my mate to Brazil v France from 1986 \u2013 and that was played on an unhelpful pitch in the heat of the day. You can watch the full match here and you won\u2019t regret it, I promise.       11.52am    \u201cSomehow like a poor film, you still remember the one great line years later \u2026 the Netherlands free-kick at the end\u2026\u201d says Richard Potter.  That was the goal of the tournament by miles, for mine. The daring to try it under pressure \u2013 though I guess if it doesn\u2019t come off, maybe the players can blame managment.      11.50am    I wrote a little about that here:      11.49am    \u201cEngland are like Man City in the Champions League,\u201d says Ian Macpherson. \u201cThey have the players, the manager, the resources, can put breathtaking moves together and score great goals \u2026 but when the chips are down are outwitted by more savvy teams. They gave it a great shot, but came short at crucial moments, no disgrace in that, especially as the young stars need to learn a bit more cunning I feel. Something France had in their greater experience and nous. They will come good.On the subject of Southgate, it is crazy to knee-jerk call for his dismissal. There is nobody who could take over and do better, and starting all over with a new man will just disrupt everything he has patiently built around the squad. Let us remember he has detoxified the atmosphere around playing for England, and has created a positive team culture with a raft of young talent. He has addressed the nasty undercurrent of nationalism which has bedevilled the England support for decades, and for that alone should be honoured. To throw that away in the pursuit of a quick fix which will probably set them back is short sighted in the extreme. There is no saviour waiting in the wings. People will remember this match as a classic of its kind, so close it could have gone either way, full of incident and drama. For that alone let us be thankful and enjoy it.\u201d I agree that it was the best last-eight tie by far, but disagree a little on City. They keep getting caught, as Munich under Guardiola did, because they don\u2019t have the back five to handle it when, as is almost inevitable at that level, a side with serious attackers gets it together. When he had Messi and the greatest midfield ever, he could get away with it, but not otherwise.     11.41am    \u201cGreat football matches don\u2019t always equate to great football,\u201d says John Toolan. \u201cThat match between Argentina and Netherlands had everything you want from a classic. Argentina odds on to win until \u2026 and the rest is history. You couldn\u2019t take your eyes off it \u2013 even when it was over!\u201d The needle was tremendous, I agree, but I found the game fairly disappointing until the last 10minutes. What I will say is that both that game and Brazil Croatia delivered pretty decent extra-time, which is extremely unusual.      11.39am    \u201cSouthgate did a \u2018much better job\u2019 by what metric?\u201d emails Nathaniel Byrne. \u201cGoing out sooner in the tournament? Or because they beat an Iranian team without their concussed goalkeeper, an already eliminated Wales and a Senegal team who were missing Mane and just about qualified from a group with their worst team in a World Cup in decades. The soft soap that everyone is applying to Southgate is sickening to an outsider. No critical opinion is being put into his terrible subs, the insipid play throughout the game but particularly the last 10 minutes and the cowardice his teams have always played with. Relegated in Nations league but still doing \"\u2018a much better job\u2019 than what?! Mike Bassett?!\u201d The metric of what my eyes tell me. The England team at the Euros were better than the England team in the 2018 World Cup, and the England team at this World Cup were better than the England team at the Euros. I don\u2019t really care too much about the Nations League; I criticised his subs below; but I think you can lose a World Cup quarter to the holders, narrowly, and it not mean the manager is rubbish.      11.34am    \u201cThere\u2019s a parallel universe where, Kane having scored the first penalty against his Spurs team mate, reckons the second just seems too risky to try it again, so he hands the ball to Ivan Toney\u2026\u201d There is no universe, parallel or otherwise, where a killer and team captain like Harry Kane passes on that responsibility. And Ivan Toney has never taken penalties under pressure anywhere near as intense, which is something to which we don\u2019t pay enough heed. We think what separates sportsfolk from the rest of us is talent, and it is, but what also differentiates them from us is the desire to embrace fear.      11.30am    Settle an argument: I was saying to mate yesterday that the Argentina v Netherlands game wasn\u2019t a classic, it just got a bit exciting at the end; he insisted it was a terrific game of football and a World Cup classic. Which of us is right?      11.25am    Away from England for a moment, this is incredible.      11.24am    What we need to accept, I think, is that at the top level, it\u2019s possible to play well and lose because the opposition have good players and lots of experience. That\u2019ll be hard for the players to tolerate because a semi-final against Morocco was there for the taking, while Kane and Maguire, who\u2019ll be 33 next time round, might feel this was the chance of their lifetimes.      11.19am    \u201cIt is not enough to set up a team and send them out with the mindset \u2018not lose\u2019,\u201d says Anthony Trent. \u201cWe have to be brave, we have to have the courage to dare to win.\u201d I think England did try to win last night. The issue was execution not ideology.      11.18am    \u201cSouthgate is not anywhere near good enough for the job,\u201d emails Patrick Cox. \u201cHe has flattered to deceive in every tournament he\u2019s played in thus far. Losing to Croatia in a semi-final? Four million people? Losing to Italy in a final when they can\u2019t qualify for the World Cup is subpar, to be kind about it. The qualifying and friendlies haven\u2019t been a roaring success either. It is sad to lose a great generation of talent like Roberto Martinez with Belgium being poorly managed but it seems to be a theme in international soccer. Those two victories would have set this team up for a title run this tournament but only with a good manager. This England team are fragile mentally, failure is accepted and we should have eaten France up.\u201d I don\u2019t think it matters how many people live in Croatia if among them are Modric, Kovacic, Rakitic, Mandzukic and so on. I do think Southgate\u2019s tactics were poor against Italy in the Euros final, but in this tournament he did a much better job and ultimately, his players didn\u2019t execute at the big moments. That\u2019s their fault, not his, I\u2019d say      11.12am    From PA: \u201cFootball Association chief executive Mark Bullingham has expressed his pride for Gareth Southgate and the England squad after their World Cup exit. A 2-1 defeat by France in the quarter-finals ended what had been a positive tournament for the national side. \u2018Like all England fans we feel the pain of losing a quarter-final, along with the coaches, players and support team who are hurting this morning,\u2019 he said in a statement. \u201cGareth and Steve (Holland) prepared the team exceptionally well throughout the tournament. The players were committed to winning the trophy and were very well led by Harry Kane. \u2018But sport can have fine margins and on the day, against the current world champions, it was not to be. \u2018This is a very exciting young English squad and, despite the intense disappointment of last night, they should be very proud of their performances in Qatar. \u2018We are incredibly proud of Gareth, the players, the coaches and the support team and appreciate all the hard work they put in.\u2019\u201d     11.09am    \u201cRegarding Southgate,\u201d says TS Ahmad, I think his team is mature enough to win without him. I don\u2019t know if fans want to see him in for the Euros; time must be spent efficiently and you have a fantastic squad but that are growing too so if England doesn\u2019t win it wouldn\u2019t fans think back and say: he should have gone by the end of the World Cup, he only took us to the quarter finals? (even it is hard to do it, as the sentiment is that the boys played well). Hard to see a capable manager (e.g.Eddie Howe) leave their jobs and pursue the England one.\u201d Yup, I don\u2019t see that there are loads of alternative options should Southgate turn it in.      11.06am    And here are Barney Ronay\u2019s thoughts (apologies, I\u2019ve had some connectivity issues).    Updated at 11.35am GMT    10.12am    \u201cLack of chances?\u201d says Ed Bayling. \u201cThink you\u2019re being a bit harsh there. Bellingham drew a great save from Lloris with that fiery volley, and Maguire nicked the woodwork with a back post header from about four yards. And one could argue the penalties would have been good chances, but for a timely foul...\u201d I wouldn\u2019t class Bellingham\u2019s dig as a chance created \u2013 the ball fell to him and he had a dig, but it was almost impossible to score from there given the height and pressure. Which leaves us with one header from a corner; I don\u2019t think Mount was getting near the pass prior to the penalty he won, nor do I think Saka was on the cusp of creating something but for Tcouameni\u2019s foul.      10.07am    Email! \u201cWhen a French fan was asked who they feared about England, he said, \u2018Rashford\u2019,\u201d muses Peter Gartner, \u201cRashford, given more of a chance, could be as good as Mbapp\u00e9. We might have done better if Rashford had started, instead of putting him on with about five minutes left. I don\u2019t understand Southgate under-using Rashford.\u201d I don\u2019t think Rashford could be as good as Mbapp\u00e9, but I do think he\u2019s got more talent than Sterling \u2013 Sterling has just played in better teams and for better managers and coaches. My guess on his usage by Southgate is that he\u2019s a really good sub \u2013 a better one than three other wide attackers \u2013 and I thought oden and Saka did well in the second half yesterday.   Updated at 10.07am GMT    9.56am         9.55am    One thought that\u2019s nagging at me: even when England were dominant in the game, they still failed to create any serious chances, and the best one of the second half was wasted by Giroud.      9.51am    Here are Jonathan Liew\u2019s thoughts on last night.       9.45am    Ouch dept:      9.43am    The story of last night, in photo form.       9.37am    There\u2019s live sport for our delectation going on right now, the Testvangelists at it again.      9.29am    I\u2019d be fairly surprised if Southgate goes. I think he husbanded his resources far more wisely than in the Euros, and England now have a team able to go up against yer Frances and try to dominate. Previously, they\u2019d have planned to defend deep while hoping for a counter or a moment of magic. Now, though, they\u2019ve the ability to dominate in midfield, and if Kalvin Phillips were to replace Jordan Henderson, you\u2019d have three absolute physical brutes, which some very serious technical ability. England and Southgate will know they were good enough to win this tournament, but that they\u2019ll be better two years from now.       9.22am    On which point, I\u2019ll tell you what I absolutely loved: Giroud\u2019s celebration. When France won the World Cup in 2018, he not only failed to score but didn\u2019t even record a shot on target. He won\u2019t mind too much because he did his job for the team, but it\u2019d be foolish to think that didn\u2019t bother his pride, and he\u2019s making amends this time round.      9.19am    In similar vein, I agree with Maguire that the ref was poor. But you almost never lose a game because of the officials; they make mistakes and it\u2019s up to the players to be good enough in spite of that. It wasn\u2019t the ref who, to take a random example, allowed Giroud in front of them to score the winning goal.       9.17am    I\u2019m afraid, though, that was not a game settled on \u2018small details\u201d, because wellying a late penalty over the bar is, I\u2019m afraid, a colossal happening.       9.10am    I agree with Jacob that Saka and Rice were England\u2019s best players, but I thought Bellingham looked a little leggy in the second half. On which point, Sterling for Saka was a very strange sub, I thought. It was, of course, possible that Sterling might\u2019ve scored, but it was hard to see him having as much influence on the game and the player he replaced.      9.07am    And here are Jacob Steinberg\u2019s player ratings.       9.02am    Here\u2019s David Hytner\u2019s match report from the Al Bayt Stadium.       9.00am   Preamble  Every now and again \u2013 really not often \u2013 a misfortune befalls a sportsperson that has you wincing because you know they\u2019ll be lugging it about them for the rest of their days. John Terry slipping in the 2008 Champions League final, Steven Gerrard saying this doesn\u2019t slip then slipping before Demba Ba scored for Chelsea \u2026 and poor old Harry Kane missing a penalty when England looked in with a chance of becoming world champions.  So we\u2019ll be spending today looking back at that and the rest of the quarter-finals, while looking forward to the semis and beyond. Send us in your thoughts, and we\u2019ll see where we get to.

                    "body": "  12.46pm   Geoff Lemon's match report       11.53am   Summary  Thanks for joining me tonight on a superb occasion for New Zealand, and a result that jump-starts this T20 World Cup. Stay tuned for all the reaction from Geoff Lemon, Simon Burnton, and the rest of the team.  There\u2019ll be plenty more OBOs like this to keep an eye on as the tournament progresses and I look forward to catching you back here when I\u2019m on the tools.     11.47am    The action isn\u2019t over just yet. The context of Australia\u2019s thrashing will become clearer after group rivals England take on Afghanistan in Perth. That one gets underway shortly and you can follow all the action here:      11.46am    Kane Williamson was chill:  It was one of those days, an outstanding day. Finn Allen at the top set the tone and another class innings from Devon and a lot of contributions throughout to get to a very good total. And I thought the fielding and the bowling was outstanding. The boys showed a lot of technical ability and held the catches. It\u2019s a funny game\u2026 It was a really clinical performance and something to build on for our next ones.      11.44am    The skippers have had their say. Aaron Finch was magnanimous in defeat:  They were in front of the game the whole way and we were chasing the whole way. We were totally outplayed in all aspects\u2026 You have to plan to win the next four games and get a bit of luck along the way. We\u2019ve got belief in our group, that we got this right team in the right place to be able to do that. Tonight was just a disappointing one.      11.40am    Peter Ashby is understandably thrilled. \u201cThis is big,\u201d he emails. \u201cIn tournaments and on home soil they usually do a number on us. NZ beat Aus in a tournament on home soil. That is a huge hoodoo beaten.\u201d   Updated at 11.40am BST    11.39am    Devon Conway has spoken about New Zealand\u2019s performance.  Special performance by the boys tonight. Credit has to go Finn [Allen], to how he started, he got that momentum for us, then it was a good performance from everyone. It was pretty special. I\u2019ve seen him do it time and time again. Quite a young guy in his career but he is very exposed, is fearless. Credit to the way he played. Certainly, the way Finn Allen plays his game complements my game. I know I batted around him. The surface was really good to bat on so I just felt timing the ball was probably going to give us the chance of success. It means a lot to us. Especially at the SCG. To beat Australia on any occasion is a big up for us. We will take this momentum into the next game.      11.34am   Devon Conway Player of the Match  The opener\u2019s 92 was 50 more than any other batter. He started strongly then went on to anchor the innings, hitting boundaries at crucial moments to keep the momentum flowing New Zealand\u2019s way.      11.32am    While Australia\u2019s disappointment will take the headlines, New Zealand deserve all the credit. They did the small things well all night \u2013 running between the wickets, holding their catches, executing smart bowling changes \u2013 in a very polished performance. In Finn Allen they could have the star of the tournament, while in Devon Conway, Trent Boult, and Tim Southee they have T20 performers of the highest order.      11.30am    That really was a humiliating night from start to finish for Australia. They batted for just 103 legal deliveries. 28 top-scored. 25 was the highest partnership.  And that came after their much vaunted bowling attack was put to the sword by Finn Allen and Devon Conway.      11.25am   New Zealand win by 89 runs  That was a statement victory from the Black Caps, one that all-but guarantees them a spot in the semi-finals, and simultaneously means Australia need results to go their way for them to get out of the group.      11.24am   WICKET! Cummins c Conway b Southee 21 (Australia 111)  Tim Southee returns to finish the job. Cummins tries to go big but can only sky a top edge that Conway pouches comfortably. What a rout.      11.22am    17th over: Australia 111-9 (Cummins 21, Hazlewood 1) Trent Boult ends with 2/24. He has played his part, as he always does.      11.19am   WICKET! Zampa b Boult 0 (Australia 109-9)  Zampa lasts two balls, the second of which is a Boult knuckleball that\u2019s much too good for the Australian tailender and smacks into leg stump.      11.18am   WICKET! Starc b Boult 4 (Australia 109-8)  Starc misses, Boult hits. New Zealand\u2019s premier paceman belatedly gets in on the act with as simple a dismissal as you can imagine, hitting a full length and crashing into the middle of middle. The SCG raises barely a murmur.   Updated at 11.20am BST    11.16am    16th over: Australia 109-7 (Cummins 20, Starc 4) Cummins somehow forces Ferguson over the offside ring and away for four, a manufactured stroke quickly forgotten when the Test skipper stands his ground and plucks a half-volley off his stumps and deposits it into the pavilion. 12 from a rare successful over for the hosts.      11.12am    15th over: Australia 97-7 (Cummins 9, Starc 3) New Zealand have dominated so far without Trent Boult landing a blow. The star left-armer returns for his third over but he remains wicketless for the time being.  \u201cMorning Jonathan,\u201d greetings Adam Hirst. \u201cAll very enjoyable so far. With seven down, NZ should try and bowl as many dots as possible, not bother with wickets. Try and get the Australian net RR as low as possible, they might need it on countback later.\u201d Excellent strategy. That Boult over just now suggests that may well be the tactic.      11.07am    14th over: Australia 91-7 (Cummins 7, Starc 1) Sodhi finishes with 1/29. Already discussion of the context of this match is around how the net run rate damage Australia will suffer could already all-but rule them out of the semi-finals. A catastrophic night for the hosts.     11.05am   WICKET! Maxwell b Sodhi 28 (Australia 89-7)  Maxwell\u2019s vigil at the non-striker\u2019s end continues to the midpoint of Sodhi\u2019s over. His frustration is writ large when he aims yet another massive switch hit only to miss the ball and hear the dreaded death rattle behind him. Brave from Sodhi. Brilliant from New Zealand. This is a night to remember for the Black Caps.      11.02am    13th over: Australia 87-6 (Maxwell 28, Cummins 5) After three deliveries without a run to begin the over, Ferguson concedes a boundary when Cummins swings him to leg off an inside edge. A beautifully disguised slower ball almost exacts revenge but Williamson will be happy with a single from the last delivery that sees Cummins farm the strike \u2013 to end an over that saw Maxwell marooned at the non-striker\u2019s end throughout.       10.59am   WICKET! Wade c Conway b Ferguson 2 (Australia 82-6)  Back to the pace of Lockie Ferguson, and immediately he hurries up Wade with one that skids off the dewy deck. He backs that up with a scorcher that kisses the deck, pecks the outside edge, and snuggles into Conway\u2019s gloves. Superb seam bowling. Australia are in all sorts.      10.57am    12th over: Australia 82-5 (Maxwell 28, Wade 2) MAXWELLBALL continues at the SCG! A switch-hit slog sweep sends Sodhi 95m over cover/midwicket. That was a ridiculous hit. Sodhit doesn\u2019t lose his cool though and around that maximum there\u2019s three dot balls before a single brings Wade on strike. The wicket keeper punches a single to farm the strike.       10.53am    11th over: Australia 74-5 (Maxwell 21, Wade 1) Where there\u2019s a Maxi there\u2019s a way, and the virtuoso Victorian peels off another reverse hit for four, this time a bottom edged reverse sweep to third/fine leg. If Australia win then we\u2019ll have witnessed one of the all-time great innings. Santner ends with 3/30.      10.50am   WICKET! David c Neesham b Santner 11 (Australia 68-5)  The wheels are coming off now. Tim David comes out after drinks and slog sweeps Santner for six with strong forearms. He tries agin next delivery but Santner saw him coming, dragged it down, and the ball flew in Neesham\u2019s direction who held onto his second excellent catch of the night, low diving forward.  Updated at 10.51am BST    10.47am    WinViz has New Zealand a 93% chance to win. Still no rain. The SCG must be the only dry square metres in the entirety of New South Wales.      10.46am    10th over: Australia 62-4 (Maxwell 16, David 5) Maxwell again goes to the switch-hit to Sodhi, but there\u2019s a sweeper on that cover/midwicket boundary in preparation. David is far less assured against the Kiwi tweaker, only just surviving a legspinner that clips the merest outside edge to avoid an LBW. Maxwell shows his junior partner how it\u2019s done, stepping to leg and carving a muscular boundary over extra cover. Australia are miles behind with a quarter of the match still to go, but with Glenn Maxwell at the crease they can\u2019t be written off.      10.42am    9th over: Australia 54-4 (Maxwell 10, David 3) Santner has 2/19 from his three overs. Australia need a miracle. Every replay makes Phillips\u2019s catch to dismiss Santner look even better. Full length, mid-air, hitting the ball on the run, just incredible.   Updated at 10.44am BST    10.40am   WICKET! Stoinis c Phillips b Santner 7 (Australia 50-4)  Mark Howard reckons we\u2019ve already seen the shot of the tournament, well that might genuinely be the catch of the tournament. Take a bow Glenn Phillips. Stoinis tried to carve a loopy Santner delivery over the covers but didn\u2019t get all of the shot. Phillips tore in from his station at deep point and flew full length to hold on to an absolute screamer at full length. New Zealand are on fire tonight.      10.37am    8th over: Australia 49-3 (Maxwell 9, Stoinis 6) Ish Sodhi\u2019s turn to make something happen, from the Paddington end. Williamson looking to capitalise on Stoinis\u2019s slow start. Sodhi turns the ball into the right-handers from over the wicket, going for a run-a-ball for five deliveries before MAXWELLBALL arrives and the maverick switch hits for four with the dexterity of Victorian seamstress stitching the monogram of a minor royal onto some shirt cuffs.      10.33am    7th over: Australia 41-3 (Maxwell 4, Stoinis 3) With WinViz favouring New Zealand 81/19% Santner gets another whirl. He starts with some fortune as Maxwell slips turning for a second, and then almost does for Stoinis, beating the outside edge, then inducing an inside-edge that almost plays on. Stoinis is treading water and does not look like he\u2019s reading the pace of the pitch just yet. He\u2019s three from eight as New Zealand continue to turn the screw.  Updated at 10.34am BST    10.28am    6th over: Australia 37-3 (Maxwell 2, Stoinis 1) Santner\u2019s spin is replaced by the raw pace of Lockie Ferguson, and the speedster hits his marks conceding just three singles as Australia\u2019s right-handers consolidate.      10.24am    5th over: Australia 34-3 (Maxwell 0, Stoinis 0) Southee has 2/6 from his two overs. The run-rate is above 11. If the rain ever does come, the points are New Zealand\u2019s.   Updated at 10.25am BST    10.23am   WICKET! Marsh c Neesham b Southee 16 (Australia 34-3)  The good news is Glenn Maxwell is in early. The bad news is Glenn Maxwell is in early. Will we see the usual freedom from the most entertaining batter in the game? Southee continues his good form, going for four from four and howling for an LBW appeal that\u2019s declined on-field and not reviewed.  No bother, next ball Marsh tries to slog his way into rhythm but he doesn\u2019t pick the slower off-cutter and can only sky a drive into the safe hands of Jimmy Neesham at cow corner. That was not an easy catch under the lights, but it continues New Zealand\u2019s dream night.      10.20am   WICKET! Finch c Williamson b Santner 13 (Australia 30-2)  A surprising move from Williamson, bringing Mitchell Santner into the attack early, perhaps goading Marsh to take the spinner on before he\u2019s set. And that\u2019s exactly what the No 3 does, fetching a sweep from outside off and whipping it behind square leg for four. He doesn\u2019t look to be reading the ball out of Santner\u2019s left hand though, nervously prodding at a couple of dots before making Australia\u2019s Mark Howard on commentary declare he\u2019s already seen the shot of the tournament when he opens his shoulders and hits a massive high drive over square cover. It was good, but, um, yeah, 23 overs into the tournament proper\u2026 Anyway, Finch tries to do the same but can only drill the ball straight to extra-cover. A great over for Australia turns into a disaster. Finch\u2019s poor run continues. 4th over: Australia 30-2 (Marsh 12)       10.13am    3rd over: Australia 19-1 (Finch 13, Marsh 1) BOSH! Who\u2019s out of form? Not Aaron Finch. He absolutely belts the cover off a length Southee delivery and it flies 102m into the cheap seats. The follow up is a classical straight drive for four. He, and his country, needed that. Boult replies with a couple of deck-hitting dot balls then finds Finch\u2019s outside edge but it trickles wide of the cordon for runs \u2013 only two \u2013 with Australia labouring between the wickets.      10.09am    2nd over: Australia 7-1 (Finch 1, Marsh 1) Southee hits his marks to Mitchell Marsh and Aaron Finch, nipping the ball back into the two right-handers from over the wicket. Finch tries to fight fire with fire, advancing down the pitch, but he can only find mid-off with a mistimed drive. New Zealand well on top.       10.07am   WICKET! Warner b Southee 5 (Australia 5-1)  Light night follows day Southee follows Boult \u2013 and he gets the breakthrough! That was one heck of an ugly wicket. Not a great delivery, on a length around leg stump, Warner drops to one knee to larrup a mow over midwicket, only to bottom edge onto his pad, the ball lobbing up and catching another under-edge in his follow through and down onto the stumps. Plenty of luck two deliveries ago edging through second slip, then the absolute worst luck imaginable. He has the wherewithal to smile at his misfortune.      10.04am    1st over: Australia 5-0 (Warner 5, Finch 0) Trent Boult opens with a trio of dots, the second of which nips off the seam and induces a play and miss from David Warner. Then there\u2019s a huge let-off for the Australian opener. He\u2019s squared up by Boult and edges straight to where second slip was standing for the first three balls and away for a boundary. A single rotates the strike allowing Boult to rip one past the out-of-touch Finch\u2019s backfoot prod. Not the forceful start the home side were looking for. It is now pitch black above the SCG, with the ground bathed in floodlight. It\u2019s still dry.      9.59am    Australia\u2019s chase will begin in two shakes of a lamb\u2019s tail.      9.56am    It is still dry at the SCG, and may well remain dry long enough to force a DLS outcome. However, the radar reveals the Sydney metro area being encircled by storm clouds, so it\u2019s a matter of when, not if, there\u2019s a downpour.      9.52am   New Zealand 200-3  The Black Caps will be delighted with that total after being inserted by Aaron Finch. Finn Allen set the tone with a blistering opening, Devon Conway anchored the innings superbly, and Jimmy Neesham added the gloss with some late biff. The rain has held off long enough to suggest a result is in sight, and with a round 200 on the board New Zealand will be favourites to secure an early win.   Updated at 9.52am BST    9.49am    20th over: New Zealand 200-3 (Conway 92, Nessham 26) Hazlewood to bowl the final over, and he begins with a perfectly executed wide yorker. He follows that up with a tighter yorker that Neesham does well to engineer two from. The big allrounder then gets under a length delivery but he doesn\u2019t get all of it and has to settle for a single. Ball four is a long-read all by itself as Conway moves to the offside, Hazlewood follows him, the batter flinches and somehow edge-scoops a loopy two over gully. A hard run two keeps Neesham on strike for the final delivery \u2013 and he smites it for six over cow corner! Brilliant finish to a brilliant innings for the Black Caps! Hazlewood, by some margin the pick of the attack ends with 2/41.   Updated at 9.53am BST    9.44am    19th over: New Zealand 186-3 (Conway 89, Nessham 15) Starc pounds in over the wicket to the pair of lefties, getting the ball to tail in towards leg stump. Two singles precede a loopy top-edge from Conway that lands just short of the diving Stoinis in the deep. Another single follows as Starc\u2019s length proves impossible to lever away. He then benefits from Neesham failing to time a full toss, but then feels the wrath of fate when Conway creams his final delivery through the covers. Starc ends with 0/36, a good comeback of sorts after being taken to the cleaners by Allen in the opening over.     9.40am    18th over: New Zealand 176-3 (Conway 81, Nessham 13) New Zealand are on the tonk now. Neesham starts by clouting Cummins over cow corner for six, then slices behind point but it\u2019s worth only one. The bowler tries to limit the damage using width but ends up flinging down two wides. Neesham continues his aggressive approach but again hits the field, this time long-off, but he runs hard for two. New Zealand\u2019s running has been a feature of the night. Neesham picks up another two, this time in more fortunate fashion as a miscued slap lands safely where a standard midwicket would usually patrol. Cummins ends with the unfamiliar figures of 0/46.  Updated at 9.41am BST    9.35am    17th over: New Zealand 161-3 (Conway 79, Nessham 2) Not for the first time tonight Conway sets up a cruise of an over by stroking the opening delivery for a boundary, this time a classical off drive just wide of the diving mid-off. Jimmy Neesham, promoted to No 5, tries to loft his first delivery from Stoinis over the sight-screen but can only get enough on it to earn a single, one of five to see off the over. Stoinis 0/38 from his four.   Updated at 9.37am BST    9.30am   WICKET! Phillips c&amp;b Hazlewood 12 (New Zealand 152-3)  Hazlewood tears into his third over, hitting the deck hard, and he beats Phillips for pace with a back-of-length delivery. He reckons Phillips actually feathered that through to the nonplussed Wade \u2013 and if Wade is nonplussed, you know you\u2019re on thin ice \u2013 and it\u2019s no surprise when the third umpire confirms on review there was daylight between bat and ball. Phillips rubs salt into the wound with a baseball-style straight slap to the sight-screen for four from a near identical delivery. Hazlewood is nothing if not consistent though, persisting with the strategy until he gets his reward! Phillips is late onto another bunt, lobbing a simple return catch to the fast bowler.  16th over: New Zealand 152-3 (Conway 72)     9.23am    15th over: New Zealand 144-2 (Conway 70, Phillips 7) Zampa beats the outside edge of Conway\u2019s bat with a wrong\u2019un but the opener\u2019s back foot remains grounded as Wade removes the bails. Next up the Kiwi lefty finds the middle of the blade to send the ball back over the bowler\u2019s head for a one bounce four.  Ten from Zampa\u2019s final over. He finishes with 1/39.     9.17am    14th over: New Zealand 134-2 (Conway 62, Phillips 6) Conway ignores the dismissal and welcomes Cummins to the attack with a crisp cover drive for three. Glenn Phillips defends his first two deliveries from the crease, then times a gentle square drive that skips away for an unexpected boundary. Phillips\u2019s arrival continues the right-left combination that has allowed Australia\u2019s bowlers no opportunity to settle into a line and length.       9.13am   WICKET! Williamson LBW Zampa 23 (New Zealand 125-2)  Finch turns to Zampa and in turn Conway turns to the visiting balcony to raise his bat after slapping with his arc for a six over cow corner. Five more unfussy runs follow before Williamson unfurls a reverse sweep from nowhere, misses the ball, and is given out LBW. The Kiwi skipper reviews, but it\u2019s to no avail. A stodgy innings ends in innocuous fashion. Not a great start to the tournament from one of New Zealand\u2019s key players. 13th over: New Zealand 125-2 (Conway 59)   Updated at 9.18am BST    9.08am    12th over: New Zealand 112-1 (Conway 48, Williamson 21) Starc remains in the attack as the floodlights take full effect and it\u2019s a superb over full of pace and swing, keeping the Black Caps honest and threatening the stumps with every delivery. That was the first time tonight ball looked on top of bat with the length deliveries coming off the pitch hard. Williamson is really chewing up some time now, he needs to motor.     9.03am    11th over: New Zealand 109-1 (Conway 46, Williamson 20) Immediately after the mid-innings drinks break Williamson carts a Stoinis legside delivery over the square-leg fence in a statement of intent. The Aussie allrounder mixes up the remainder of his over and the variability makes him hard to line up and despite plenty of aggression the Kiwis have to settle for ones and twos.      8.59am    It\u2019s still dry as we hit the 7pm mark when the rain was due.      8.57am    10th over: New Zealand 97-1 (Conway 42, Williamson 12) Starc returns after his opening over savaging, and does not concede a boundary. He almost does for Conway with a trademark heatseeking in-swinging toe-crusher, but the opener survives. At the halfway mark New Zealand are well set for a healthy total but they need to be careful they don\u2019t lose too much momentum.     8.51am    9th over: New Zealand 90-1 (Conway 37, Williamson 10) Zampa continues and his first four deliveries go for just three runs as this partnership hits the doldrums, only for Conway to seize the initiative and hammer a long straight handsome six. Zampa follows up with one that just clips the pad before bat with Conway pressing forward. He appeals with gusto, to no avail, but Finch reviews! Pitching in line\u2026 struck in line\u2026 bouncing over! Conway survives, but that was a narrow escape.       8.46am    8th over: New Zealand 81-1 (Conway 30, Williamson 8) Zampa\u2019s great mate Stoinis is thrown the ball again as the weather radar shows the rain cloouds reaching urban Sydney. Conway and Williamson are happy to deal in ones and twos with the latter (eight from 12) still yet to find his timing, especially to the off-pace deliveries. I wonder if New Zealand might reflect later on that another dasher might have been the order to replace Finn to maintain the ascendancy?     8.40am    7th over: New Zealand 74-1 (Conway 26, Williamson 6) As the field spreads, Conway welcomes Adam Zampa to the attack by carving a sumptuous cover drive for four. The left-right partnership are then happy to deal in singles to keep the scoreboard moving.       8.36am    6th over: New Zealand 65-1 (Conway 19, Williamson 4) Cummins begins his second over with a dot but Conway responds with an inventive bunt for four down to third, stepping to leg, then reaching to deflect a delivery barely on the cut strip. But without Allen at the other end the Black Caps are less explosive and Williamson is happy to soak up a couple of dots as the run-rate returns to something more realistic. It is still New Zealand\u2019s highest ever World Cup powerplay total.      8.31am    5th over: New Zealand 60-1 (Conway 14, Williamson 4) There\u2019s a delay after the wicket as some glitchy signage is dealt with, robbing the match of some momentum, and increasing the potential damage of rain later-on. Eventually Hazlewood backs up his wicket with three dots to Williamson, hitting the deck hard and cramping the Kiwi skipper for room. Williamson doesn\u2019t panic and guides some width behind point for four.  Australia\u2019s best over of the night by a mile. Will it significantly shift the momentum?     8.25am   WICKET! Allen b Hazlewood 42 (New Zealand 56-1)  Hazlewood returns. Allen advances. Ball beats bat. Stumps rearranged. Finn Allen\u2019s magnificent innings ends on 42 from 16 deliveries. Excellent \u201cif he misses you hit\u201d comeback from the top-ranked bowler in T20 cricket.     8.23am    4th over: New Zealand 56-0 (Allen 42, Conway 14) Marcus Stoinis is called on much earlier than he imagined, and after Conway strokes a couple through the covers there\u2019s a shout for a catch behind but the ball clipped the batter\u2019s grille, not his gloves, as a loopy bouncer arced through to Matthew Wade. Another dot follows, after a break in play for the bowler\u2019s footholes to be repaired. Conway recognises he needs to rotate the strike, which he does, allowing Allen to sashay down the pitch and calmly loft a six-iron over the sight-screen. Majestic batting.       8.17am    3rd over: New Zealand 46-0 (Allen 35, Conway 11) Can Pat Cummins change the momentum? Almost! After Conway gets off strike Allen fails to get all of a hook to a slower bouncer and it\u2019s straight IN AND OUT of Zampa\u2019s grasp at backward square leg. The ball trickles away for four and is subsequently belted to the opposite segment of the boundary with a glorious lofted cover drive. And now a classical pull for six, waiting back in his crease! This is Australia\u2019s first choice pace attack, in Sydney, and Finn Allen is making them look village.  Robert Speed, who is definitely not from Perth, is not happy with Australia\u2019s uniform. \u201cDid Western Australia take the place of Australia in this tournament?\u201d he asks with scorn. \u201cIs green and gold not good enough for the Australian cricket team? They look like the sandgropers. It\u2019s a disgrace.\u201d  Australia have been in mostly black throughout the T-20 era, haven\u2019t they? Baggy green caps in Tests, gold and green in ODIs, black and yellow in T20s.     8.12am    2nd over: New Zealand 29-0 (Allen 19, Conway 10) The boundaries keep acoming for the Kiwis! Josh Hazlewood begins on Devon Conway\u2019s pads and the number 88 (one of the all-time bingo calling numbers) tickles the delivery to fine-leg for four. Conway, a left-hander, then tips and runs to bring the right-handed Allen on strike. As he has all match so far Allen goes the tonk to length, but he can only skew a bottom edge to midwicket for another single. No bother, Conway skips down the track and checks an off drive to the long-off fence. Another single rotates the left-right strike and Allen capitalises on Hazlewood dropping a touch short and a smidgen wide with a punishing square cut that leaves the SCG turf blistered.  This is proactive, forceful, brilliant batting.     8.06am    1st over: New Zealand 14-0 (Allen 14, Conway 0) Starc begins on a good line and length over the wicket to the right-handed Allen for a dot. The wicket is straw coloured and dry, and Allen believes it\u2019s going to play truly, swatting the second ball for a one-bounce four over wide long-on, then a third ball six with an even cleaner smite. That was a beautiful clackety whack. A slower ball yorker denies a hat-trick of boundaries, but the SCG rope is bruised a delivery later with a straight drive that almost decapitated Conway at the non-striker\u2019s end. A slower-ball bouncer ends the over with a dot that had a hint of a wide, but not called. Superb start for the Black Caps!     8.02am    The teams are out in the middle. Mitchell Starc has the new white ball in his hand. Finn Allen is on strike. Here we go!     7.59am    Your umpires tonight are Adrian Holdstock from South Africa and Kumar Dharmasena from Sri Lanka.      7.58am    The teams are out for the anthems. New Zealand lock arms in a retro-themed grey and black uniform. Australia stand side-by-side in a First Nations-inspired yellow top and black pants, the material of which is rustling as the wind howls across the SCG.     7.54am    I\u2019m here for commemorative tankards. New Zealand continuing to set the standards for off-field culture.      7.52am    One of Australia\u2019s key performers early on with the ball will be the accurate paceman Josh Hazlewood. He spoke to Simon Burnton recently about his long career on the fringes of T20 before his sudden ascendancy.  One thing that makes his explosive return to T20s all the more remarkable is that during his time in the wilderness he not only did not train specifically for it, he did not even watch the shorter-form games. \u201cI don\u2019t watch much cricket in general, to be honest,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we\u2019re coming up against Sri Lanka down the track I might watch a little bit of their games but usually there\u2019s enough footage to watch in bowling meetings. So yeah, I hardly watch any cricket.\u201d       7.46am    James Wallace has picked out some names to pay close attention to over the next few weeks, and of those, Australia\u2019s Tim David, is the one to watch tonight.  Born in Singapore but raised in Australia, David had a spluttering start to his career \u2013 a so-so stint with Perth Scorchers in the Big Bash and a handful of games for his birth country didn\u2019t mark him out as anything special. All that changed in 2020-21 when he signed for Hobart Hurricanes and in modern cricketing parlance \u201cstarted pulling up trees\u201d.       7.42am   New Zealand XI  Finn Allen gets the nod over Martin Guptill, and Mark Chapman has been favoured over Michael Bracewell. It is a less familiar XI for the Kiwis, reflecting the start of a changing of the guard for the Black Caps.      7.40am   Australia XI  As expected, Steve Smith has been left out of the Australian XI in favour of Tim David. Cameron Green has yet to do enough to force his way into the line-up, but he is knocking on the door. It is a powerful batting order and fearsome bowling attack. 1. Aaron Finch (c)2. David Warner3.

Josh Hazlewood      7.35am   Australia won the toss and will bowl first  Aaron Finch is mindful of the weather and made the obvious choice to chase. He also reckons the pitch will improve later on. A phlegmatic Kane Williamson concurred with Finch\u2019s logic.  Updated at 7.52am BST    7.32am   Weather  Bands of heavy rain are drenching swathes of Australia\u2019s east coast but Sydney\u2019s inner-east has somehow managed to stay dry\u2026 for now. We should start on time but thunderstorms are predicted from around 7pm, helped along by a gale that\u2019s blowing across the SCG. It\u2019ll then be in the lap of the gods whether a result can be reached. Hopefully there\u2019s enough play to entertain the sell-out crowd.      7.31am    If you like tactics and strategy, Freddie Wilde from CricViz has everything you need in one handy Twitter thread.      7.30am    The Australian perspective is, as ever, provided by Geoff Lemon, and true to form he reckons the defending champions will opt not to try and fix something that isn\u2019t broken.  \u2026 for the T20 World Cup about to start, Bailey doesn\u2019t have to do much other than press copy and paste from last year\u2019s corresponding tournament. He can do so in the confidence that home conditions should, in theory, suit them and their style of play far better than the surfaces of the Arabian Gulf, where Australia\u2019s quick bowlers went against orthodoxy and odds to take the tournament.       7.27am    If you\u2019ve yet to get your head around this event, fear not, because Simon Burnton has put down everything you need to know right here:      7.12am   Preamble  Hello everybody and welcome to the opening match of the Super 12 stage of the 2022 ICC Men\u2019s T20 World Cup. Weather permitting, Australia vs New Zealand begins at the Sydney Cricket Ground at 6pm local time (8pm NZDT/8am BST). The trans-Tasman rivals have been paired in Group 1, and will expect to compete for the two semi-final spots on offer with fellow heavyweights England. Afghanistan, Ireland, and Sri Lanka, will hope to have something to say on the matter as well, albeit with less expectation. Ireland and Sri Lanka have already played three times this World Cup, successfully navigating the first round of group matches. Ireland prospered at the expense of West Indies, the two-time champions having been humiliated by both the Irish and Scotland.  Tonight\u2019s match is a repeat of last year\u2019s World Cup final when Mitchell Marsh, supported by David Warner and Glenn Maxwell, steered Australia to a comfortable victory. Both countries should again be among the favourites to reach the business end of the competition. The Black Caps won three of six warm-up fixtures, the hosts three of eight, indicating neither have hit top form, and also that the top tier of international T20 is pretty even. Tonight\u2019s winner will gain not only an important advantage in the group, but also a major psychological boost at the start of a wide-open tournament.  As always, you can contribute by sending me an email or directing any tweets to @JPHowcroft. With La Ni\u00f1a continuing to wreak havoc on Australia\u2019s east coast, I might need your help getting through some rain breaks.    "

                    "body": "Beer food, they said, for when you\u2019ve got people over to watch the World Cup and stuff \u2026 But what is beer food, beyond nuts, crisps and calling in a meat feast pizza with extra jalape\u00f1os? It\u2019s what my friend Alejandro calls \u201cnibblings\u201d and my dad \u201csnackettes\u201d.  A good nibbling is a well-seasoned, often potato-based thing. It is pick-up-able, dunkable and, sometimes, slatherable with something nice and punchy, allowing for kick-back against (my) horrible habits such as smoking out of the window and other such abominations. These recipes deliver all those things and are mostly doable well in advance. There is only a little work involved in getting them ready, the shopping is one fell swoop of a large, high-street retailer-type thing and, vitally, there is very little effort required when it comes to eating them. Which frees up time and, indeed, a hand for holding a beer or waving about in the air when someone scores, or doesn\u2019t, or whatever it is. Curried egg mayonnaise If crisps aren\u2019t your bag, though I hope they are, use chopped raw veg such as cucumber sticks, chicory or baby gem leaves instead. Prep 10 minCook 12 minServes 4 4 eggs, boiled for 7 minutes and peeled4 spring onions, trimmed and finely sliced (both white and green bits)1 heaped tsp mild madras curry powder2 heaped tbsp mayonnaise \u2013 Hellmann\u2019s is my go-to1 tbsp malt or white-wine vinegarSalt and black pepper 1 big bag of crisps of your choosing, for dunking \u2013 check the ingredients if you need them to be gluten-free (a surprising number aren\u2019t) Put the eggs in a bowl and mash the hell out of them with a fork. Add the onions, curry powder, mayo, vinegar, a big pinch of salt and some black pepper, and stir thoroughly. Serve with the crisps for dunking. Baked new potatoes with soured cream and rose harissa I don\u2019t want to teach my granny to suck eggs here \u2013 I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all baked a potato \u2013 but this is how I do it and these ones are little. Prep 5 minCook 40 minMakes 20  10 new potatoes, all of a similar size150ml full-fat soured cream1 x 170g jar rose harissa \u2013 I like Belazu, which all the supermarkets now sell Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Hold a fork in one hand and cradle a potato in the palm of your other hand. Tack, tack, tack the fork firmly all over the potato, turning it around as you go, so perforating it all over \u2013 this will allow for an even evaporation of the water inside it and therefore result in a better baked potato. (This is the same thing I do with big baked potatoes.) If their width allows, arrange the little spuds on an oven rack; if not, put them on a dry, heated baking tray. They\u2019ll take about 35 minutes until they look exactly like a normal baked potato, but in miniature! (Squeeze one in a tea towel to make sure it\u2019s completely soft.) Remove from the oven and drop them one by one \u2013 do not throw them! \u2013 from a height of a foot or so on to a work surface, to break up their lovely insides. Once the potatoes are cool enough to handle, cut them in half, arrange them on a platter, then spoon on some soured cream followed by some rose harissa; I also like these topped with that lumpfish caviar you get in little \u00a32 jars from the supermarket, in which case ditch the harissa. You\u2019ll probably have soured cream left over, and harissa, and some raw potatoes from the bag you bought, so do the same thing tomorrow, when that other match is on. R\u00f6sti with lime pickle yoghurt, peas and mint Prep 5 minCook 30 min Makes 1 big r\u00f6sti, to cut into at least 8 slices 2 medium-sized waxy potatoes 2 tbsp olive oil2 tbsp vegetable oil10 mint leaves, to finish, or 1 tbsp mint sauce or jelly For the yoghurt3 heaped tbsp thick, full-fat yoghurt1 heaped tbsp of your favourite lime pickle, chopped up small or blitzed smooth1 handful frozen peas, defrosted (petit pois are always best)At least three hours in advance, boil the potatoes in their skins until the moment a skewer goes all the way through with little resistance, then drain and leave to cool. Once cool, grate the potatoes, skin and all, on the coarse side of a box grater and season heavy-handedly. Get a frying pan on the heat, add a tablespoon of each oil and get it hot. Put the heap of grated potato in the middle of the pan and, using the back of a spoon, gently press it down into a rough circle about 1cm thick. A little messy is fine \u2013 it\u2019s a potato cake, not a tax return. Leave the thing to sizzle and cook for a few minutes, then shake (or, if necessary, use a spatula) to get it loose. Keep cooking the r\u00f6sti, moving it about occasionally (but not turning it over), for another 10 minutes, then slide out of the pan and on to a plate. Put the remaining oil in the pan and let it heat up. Pop a second plate on top of the r\u00f6sti plate and flip over so that, when you lift the top plate, it\u2019s now fried side up (you may well be able to flip it on the plate with a spatula, but do that only if you don\u2019t think it will fall apart). Slide the r\u00f6sti back into the hot pan and cook for another 10 minutes. While the second side sizzles and turns golden (you could also have done this hours ago), roll up the mint leaves, if using, and shred finely (poncy chefs call this a chiffonade); alternatively, dig out the mint sauce/jelly. Combine all the yoghurt ingredients in a bowl and mix thoroughly. Once the r\u00f6sti is cooked through and beautifully golden on both sides, slide it out of the pan, leave it to cool a bit, then cut into at least eight slices, like a pizza. Dunk the r\u00f6sti in the yoghurt (or slather it all over it) and top with your mint of choice. Then get everyone another beer.

                    "body": "Gregg Berhalter has made his first big tactical move of the World Cup \u2013 a reverse Landon. Remember the shocking 2014 squad, when Jurgen Klinsmann picked Aron J\u00f3hannsson but not Landon Donovan? For 2022, the US men\u2019s head coach suppressed his preference for youthful dynamism by picking old-timer and apparent international has-been Tim Ream rather than a younger option.  While Klinsmann appeared to be a tactician inspired by the Beach Boys \u2013 his impulsive process based on picking up good vibrations \u2013 Berhalter is a more deliberate, cautious and cerebral character. So welcoming Ream in from the wilderness only 12 days before the Group B opener against Wales is about as bold as he gets. And this less than two months after telling reporters exactly why Ream was a bad fit for the system. Given the overall youth of the roster, adding a veteran can\u2019t hurt. Berhalter has repeatedly stressed that he\u2019d be influenced by form as well as how players fit into his tactics. And stale displays against Japan and Saudi Arabia in September\u2019s final warm-ups must also have weighed on his mind and motivated him to shake up the squad around the edges. The other dramatic moves from Wednesday\u2019s announcement were Berhalter dropping goalkeeper Zack Steffen and striker Ricardo Pepi, who had featured prominently in qualifying. Two highly contentious omissions, even if neither player was likely to start. And if the Americans struggle to score, taking only three strikers might look questionable. Predicted starting line-up v Wales (4-3-3): Turner; Dest, Zimmerman, Long, Robinson; Adams, Musah, McKennie; Aaronson, Ferreira, Pulisic Goalkeepers \u2022 Matt Turner (Arsenal, 20 caps)\u2022 Ethan Horvath (Luton Town, 8)\u2022 Sean Johnson (New York City, 10) It\u2019s pretty clear that Turner is Berhalter\u2019s first choice and has been for a few months, so we\u2019re debating here about shuffling between reserves. But stranding Steffen was still a ruthless move that leaves the coach open to criticism. Turner recently missed three games with a groin injury and was on the bench on Wednesday when Arsenal lost to Brighton in the Carabao Cup. His absence is a particular setback since he\u2019s short of first-team action, having only played in the Europa League since joining Arsenal from the New England Revolution in the summer. Should Turner flop, expect the word \u201crusty\u201d to be on the lips of critics as he\u2019s played only six times all season. Steffen, meanwhile \u2013 who was coached by Berhalter when they were at the Columbus Crew \u2013 has made 16 appearances for Middlesbrough on loan from Manchester City. That said, Turner went the full 90 against Japan and Saudi Arabia and looked solid while Steffen has been shaky in his recent US games. All the same, he\u2019s slipped from being the number one early in World Cup qualifying to not making the top three. Addressing the issue in a curiously vague manner at the made-for-TV squad reveal event in Brooklyn, Berhalter said that Horvath is \u201ccompeting at a good level at Luton in the Championship\u201d \u2013 but that\u2019s equally applicable to Steffen. The 33-year-old Johnson is a known quantity: an all-round capable goalkeeper who made his senior international debut back in 2011, even if he\u2019s only accrued ten caps to date. Defenders \u2022 Cameron Carter-Vickers (Celtic, 11 caps)\u2022 Sergi\u00f1o Dest (AC Milan, 19)\u2022 Aaron Long (New York Red Bulls, 29)\u2022 Shaq Moore (Nashville, 15)\u2022 Tim Ream (Fulham, 46)\u2022 Antonee Robinson (Fulham, 29)\u2022 Joe Scally (Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, 3)\u2022 DeAndre Yedlin (Inter Miami, 75)\u2022 Walker Zimmerman (Nashville, 33) Berhalter turned to the 35-year-old Fulham defender after the hamstrung Crystal Palace center back Chris Richards confirmed he won\u2019t recover in time for the tournament. Aging, sedate and unexceptional on set pieces, Ream doesn\u2019t fit the Berhalter mold. He hasn\u2019t played for the national team since September 2021. But his experience, passing and decent form for a mid-table English Premier League team \u2013 where he usefully plays alongside Robinson, the first-choice US left back \u2013 made him a prudent choice. Given Ream\u2019s lack of recent international caps and call-ups, Berhalter may still prefer that Long partners Zimmerman in the opener against Wales. If that goes south he could bring in Ream for the England game, where his experience and familiarity with the opponents should be handy. Although Ream has 46 caps, Yedlin, the 29-year-old understudy to Dest at right back, is the only player on the roster with prior World Cup experience. Sam Vines suffered a broken tibia last week, eliminating him from contention as reserve left back. Full backs Moore of Nashville and Borussia\u2019s Scally were selected ahead of Boavista\u2019s Reggie Cannon but aren\u2019t likely to see any action in Qatar. Midfielders \u2022 Brenden Aaronson (Leeds, 24 caps)\u2022 Kellyn Acosta (LAFC, 53)\u2022 Tyler Adams (Leeds, 32)\u2022 Luca de la Torre (Celta Vigo, 12)\u2022 Weston McKennie (Juventus, 37)\u2022 Yunus Musah (Valencia, 19)\u2022 Cristian Roldan (Seattle, 32) The easiest outfield group for Berhalter, since he already knows his first-choice trio: Adams, Musah and McKennie. So the intrigue, such as it was, surrounded who he\u2019d pick as back-up options. Acosta, fresh from winning MLS Cup with Los Angeles FC, was an obvious choice and is most likely to slot in if one of the above trio gets injured. Roldan is versatile, while De La Torre, a playmaker, suffered a leg muscle injury last month that clearly isn\u2019t serious. Students of Berhalter\u2019s often subtle hints about his plans (Greggologists?) might want to note that Aaronson was named in midfield for this roster though he\u2019s previously been grouped in with the forwards. Berhalter didn\u2019t draw his wild card, the exciting, if raw, 20-year-old Rangers attacking midfielder, Malik Tillman. Forwards \u2022 Jes\u00fas Ferreira (Dallas, 15 caps)\u2022 Jordan Morris (Seattle, 49)\u2022 Christian Pulisic (Chelsea, 52)\u2022 Gio Reyna (Borussia Dortmund, 14)\u2022 Josh Sargent (Norwich, 20)\u2022 Tim Weah (Lille, 25)\u2022 Haji Wright (Antalyaspor, 3) Berhalter is blessed with an abundance of exciting options on the wings but saddled with a dearth of high-caliber choices at striker. He\u2019s made a pragmatic choice by opting for Wright ahead of last year\u2019s emergent hope, Pepi, who\u2019s back in goalscoring form but with Groningen but similar to the likely starter, Ferreira (who last scored on 10 September). That\u2019s to say, young, lively and busy off the ball, but inconsistent and not a conventional center forward. Wright is a selection with plan B in mind. After September\u2019s two discouraging friendlies, perhaps Berhalter\u2019s accepted that the US will spend periods chasing games and struggling for possession so it\u2019s smart to have the option of banging the ball to a target man, uncouth though it may be. At 6ft 3in, Wright can be effective in the air, act as an outlet and hold the ball up. The 24-year-old has long been viewed as a promising prospect but didn\u2019t make his senior debut until June. He scored a penalty against Morocco in a friendly that month. Berhalter cited his \u201cgreat form\u201d and Wright is indeed a prolific scorer for Antalyaspor in the Turkish league, with nine goals this season. The experience and terrier-like tenacity of the 28-year-old Morris could make him useful off the bench, though Paul Arriola of FC Dallas offers many of the same scampering qualities but misses out. With eight goals this season for Norwich City - albeit in the second tier \u2013 Berhalter clearly views Sargent as a hot hand, while Jordan Pefok of the Bundesliga\u2019s Union Berlin is overlooked. He started the campaign well but hasn\u2019t found the net in 10 matches."
